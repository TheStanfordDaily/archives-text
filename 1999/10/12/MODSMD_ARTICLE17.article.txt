## Men's squad overcomes Denver, plays USAF to 1-1 tie Soccer survives Rocky weekend 
### Meghan O'Connor Staff writer 
Playing a team on the road that
you've never played before, a team
with an intimidating 5-1 record at
home, is hard enough. Throw in an al
titude of 7,5(X) leet, a larger-than-av
erage field and long grass and the test
becomes that much more challeng
ing.
But it was a test that the Stanford
men's soccer team (6-2-2, 1-0-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
survived Sunday against the Air
Force Academy (7-4-1,0-1-1).
The Cardinal took to the field with
the confidence of a four-game win
ning streak behind it. It left 120 min
utes later with neither the elation of a
victory nor the frustration of a loss.
The two teams battled through two
overtimes before settling on a I-1 tie.

MEN'S SOCCER

■ Friday: Stanford (6-2-2, 1-0-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
5, Denver (3-8,0-1) 2.

■ Sunday: Stanford 1, Air Force
Academy (7-4-1.0-1-1) 1.

The tie added to a Stanford victo
ry Friday during its first conference
game against Denver (3-8, 0-1).
About the only thing wrong with the
game was that it tarnished the streak
of shutouts by senior keeper Adam
Zapala, and was only the second Car
dinal victory this season ncjt won in a
shutout.
Against Air Force, the team was
forced to play most of the game from
behind after junior defender Don
avon Kneuer scored for the Falcons
just six minutes into the game.
"The last thing you want to do is
chase a game in altitude, especially
when your opponent is used to it. We
had to in the beginning of the second
half," said head coach Bobby Clark,
"but by the end we were carrying the
game and on another day, another
field; we could've put the game
away."
Stanford waited until just 19 min
utes remained in the game to make its
move. Sophomore defender Lee
Morrison kept the Cardinal in the
game with a shot off a cross from se
nior co-captain Gerard Davis that
sent the game into overtime.
While neither team was successful
at putting the game away, the Cardi
nal almost saw the tie disappear be

fore its eyes as an Air Force shot ric
ocheted off Stanford's goalpost with
10 seconds to go in overtime play.
"I was disappointed because I felt
we did enough in the game, that we
should'vc won. hut it could have been
worse," ( lark said, citing the Falcon's
last-minute charge. "That one shot
really could have made it a long trip
home."
Against Denver, Stanford started
off strong, scoring two goals in the
first 21 minutes. Junior forward Luke
Rust got his fifth goal of the season
off a joint effort from junior defender
Ryan Nelsen and junior forward
Corey Woolfolk. The second goal
went to Stanford from a deflection off
one of Denver's defenders.
Thirteen minutes into the second
half, Woolfolk capitalized on a pass
from junior midfielder Scott Leber
and Stanford went up 3-0. Denver an
swered two minutes later when se
nior midfielder Chad Watts scored
on an assist from senior forward
Brian I'odd. Undaunted, Stanford
came back two minutes later with an
other from Rust, this time off an assist
from senior defender Andy Hem
merich.
Denver's final attempt to curb the
Cardinal attack came from Todd off
an assist from sophomore forward
Matt Harrell. Freshman forward
Roger Levesque snuck in Stanford's
final goal from freshman midfielder
I odd Dunivant with two minutes left
to play.
"We got goals easily without hav
ing to play particularly well." Clark

said. "We didn't keep the ball well as
a team and we didn't defend well."
"The game was a hit of a mess."
Rust said. "The altitude made it a lit
tie difficult to judge incoming halls,
and everyone's touch was a little off.
making it hard to play together. They
weren't a team that should have
scored two goals on us."
Regardless of what the scores may
indicate, the team thought Sunday's
game was its better performance. It
was in Sunday's game, however,
where the team felt the greatest ef
fects from the altitude. Because the
team flew into Denver late Thursday
night, the altitude was not an over
whelming factor in its game the fol
lowing afternoon. Two days later and
a couple thousand feet higher, the ;il
titude made its presence known.
"[The altitude| forced us to use
substitutes more often, which I
thought was beneficial to our team."
Hemmerich said. "It gave some of
the younger guys a chance to play an
important role, which will become
even more important later in the
year."
Clark adjusted his lineup for the
altitude by keeping his defense on the
field as a strong base, but split time
evenly between his substitutes and
starters on the midfield and offensive
lines.
"We adapted well and that's part
of being a successful team." Clark
said, "you've got to take whatever the
opposition gives you. Il showed a lot

showed me that they've got a lot of
character and grit."
For a team that dominated 16-9 in
shots on net, the draw was no doubt
disappointing, but the team can not
ignore some good that came out of
the game.
"I thought the performance by
our team was incredible considering
the altitude and size of the field,"
I lemmerich said. "Every player gave
all they could on the field, which is al
most more important, in a funny way,
than a victory."
"I was very proud of the way the
team played," ('lark agreed. "It was a
real team performance."
The tic has not shaken the confi
dence of the Cardinal as it anticipates
the rest of its conference games. Ten
games into the season last year the
future NCAA finalists held a similar
record of (7-3,0-1-0).
"Now is when it all starts to hap
pen." Clark said. "This is the part of
the season when real teams step up
and start to win games. We're in a
good position, so it's up to us to fol
low through."

Clark adjusted his lineup for the

lines.

For a team that dominated 16-9 in
shots on net, the draw was no doubt
disappointing, but the team can not
ignore some good that came out of
the game.
"I thought the performance by
our team was incredible considering
the altitude and size of the field,"
I lemmerich said. "Every player gave
all they could on the field, which is al
most more important, in a funny way,

team played," ('lark agreed. "It was a
real team performance."
The tic has not shaken the confi
dence of the Cardinal as it anticipates
the rest of its conference games. Ten
games into the season last year the
future NCAA finalists held a similar
record of (7-3,0-1-0).
"Now is when it all starts to hap
pen." Clark said. "This is the part of
the season when real teams step up
and start to win games. We're in a
good position, so it's up to us to fol

Playing a team on the road that
you've never played before, a team
with an intimidating 5-1 record at
home, is hard enough. Throw in an al
titude of 7,5(X) leet, a larger-than-av
erage field and long grass and the test
becomes that much more challeng
ing.
But it was a test that the Stanford
men's soccer team (6-2-2, 1-0-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
survived Sunday against the Air
Force Academy (7-4-1,0-1-1).
The Cardinal took to the field with
the confidence of a four-game win
ning streak behind it. It left 120 min
utes later with neither the elation of a
victory nor the frustration of a loss.
The two teams battled through two
overtimes before settling on a I-1 tie.

■ Sunday: Stanford 1, Air Force
Academy (7-4-1.0-1-1) 1.

The tie added to a Stanford victo
ry Friday during its first conference
game against Denver (3-8, 0-1).
About the only thing wrong with the
game was that it tarnished the streak
of shutouts by senior keeper Adam
Zapala, and was only the second Car
dinal victory this season ncjt won in a
shutout.
Against Air Force, the team was
forced to play most of the game from
behind after junior defender Don
avon Kneuer scored for the Falcons
just six minutes into the game.
"The last thing you want to do is
chase a game in altitude, especially
when your opponent is used to it. We
had to in the beginning of the second
half," said head coach Bobby Clark,
"but by the end we were carrying the
game and on another day, another
field; we could've put the game
away."
Stanford waited until just 19 min
utes remained in the game to make its
move. Sophomore defender Lee
Morrison kept the Cardinal in the
game with a shot off a cross from se
nior co-captain Gerard Davis that
sent the game into overtime.
While neither team was successful
at putting the game away, the Cardi
nal almost saw the tie disappear be

fore its eyes as an Air Force shot ric
ocheted off Stanford's goalpost with
10 seconds to go in overtime play.
"I was disappointed because I felt
we did enough in the game, that we
should'vc won. hut it could have been
worse," ( lark said, citing the Falcon's
last-minute charge. "That one shot
really could have made it a long trip
home."
Against Denver, Stanford started
off strong, scoring two goals in the
first 21 minutes. Junior forward Luke
Rust got his fifth goal of the season
off a joint effort from junior defender
Ryan Nelsen and junior forward
Corey Woolfolk. The second goal
went to Stanford from a deflection off
one of Denver's defenders.
Thirteen minutes into the second
half, Woolfolk capitalized on a pass
from junior midfielder Scott Leber
and Stanford went up 3-0. Denver an
swered two minutes later when se
nior midfielder Chad Watts scored
on an assist from senior forward
Brian I'odd. Undaunted, Stanford
came back two minutes later with an
other from Rust, this time off an assist
from senior defender Andy Hem
merich.
Denver's final attempt to curb the
Cardinal attack came from Todd off
an assist from sophomore forward
Matt Harrell. Freshman forward
Roger Levesque snuck in Stanford's
final goal from freshman midfielder
I odd Dunivant with two minutes left
to play.
"We got goals easily without hav
ing to play particularly well." Clark

said. "We didn't keep the ball well as
a team and we didn't defend well."
"The game was a hit of a mess."
Rust said. "The altitude made it a lit
tie difficult to judge incoming halls,
and everyone's touch was a little off.
making it hard to play together. They
weren't a team that should have
scored two goals on us."
Regardless of what the scores may
indicate, the team thought Sunday's
game was its better performance. It
was in Sunday's game, however,
where the team felt the greatest ef
fects from the altitude. Because the
team flew into Denver late Thursday
night, the altitude was not an over
whelming factor in its game the fol
lowing afternoon. Two days later and
a couple thousand feet higher, the ;il
titude made its presence known.
"[The altitude| forced us to use
substitutes more often, which I
thought was beneficial to our team."
Hemmerich said. "It gave some of
the younger guys a chance to play an
important role, which will become
even more important later in the
year."
