The No. 16 Stanford women's soc
cer team launched into Pacific 10
Conference play last weekend with
wins over ()regon and ()regon State.
I he Cardinal's play showcased the
strength of the squad relative to its
Pac-10 opponents and confirmed the
team's status as a competitive con
tender for the conference title.
But the wins did much more than
that.
To accomplish the goal of winning
a national championship this year,
Stanford needs more than just a cou
ple of wins against Pac-10 teams, it
needs strength of character. With
questionable calls leaving the offi
cials stammering to explain and un
lucky misses, this weekend revealed
that the Cardinal has got what it takes
to overcome adversity and win.
"It was a great weekend to show
what kind of character we have," said
head coach Steve Swanson. "We rose
above all of that, and you have to.
You have to keep your discipline and
be confident."
In Friday's game, Stanford (9-3,2-
0 Pacific 10 Conference) claimed a
narrow 1-0 victory over a veteran
()regon {4-8,0-2) squad stacked with
13 seniors.

win. It was just a matter of going out
there and doing it."

not a great call."
In the second half, the Cardinal

We were hungry for another one."
