### Juliana Liu Contributing writer 
The first president of the compa
ny that manages Stanford's endow
ment will step down later this year
after nine years of service.
Standing behind his belief that
"10 years and out is a good deal for
most organizational institutions."
Faurance Hoagland. Stanford's
highest paid employee, will step
down from his position as the presi
dent and CF() of Stanford Manage
ment ( ompanv.
Hoagland arrived as the presi
dent in 1991 at the founding of
SMC.
SMC is responsible for the Uni
versity's financial investments, in
cluding endowment investments,
and its real estate holdings. Total as
sets under SMC management are
worth about $7.5 billion. Hoagland
said.
"Having the opportunity to be
the founding (TO of SMC was a
dream come true for me."
Hoagland said. "Both the board of
directors and the other members of
the management team have been
extraordinary to work with. How
ever. by the time 1 depart, I will
have been here nine years. It's time
for fresh ideals and fresh leader
ship."
Since 1991. the University's
Merged Endowment Pool, which
includes most of Stanford's endow
ment. has grown from $1.87 billion
to approximately $6 billion, accord
ing to a press release. In addition,
about $1.4 billion has flowed from
the endowment into the University
general budget.
The release also said factors such

as strong investment markets, out
standing performance by managers
and substantial gifts have driven
growth in the endowment pool.
In the past eight years, SMC has
focused investments in non-tradi
tional assets such as venture capital
and real estate. Hoagland said.
â– 'Returns by venture firms are
truly staggering." Hoagland said,
citing a return of 150 percent as of
last June,
Gregor Peterson, chair of the
SMC board of directors, said
1 ioagland "has done a superb job as
president and CEO of SMC."
Peterson said Hoagland has ex
ceeded the goals that were estab
lished when I ioagland arrived.
"The incremental dollars earned
on the endowment over the bench
mark return during Laurie's tenure
total $500 million, which is a re
markable and very meaningful con
tribution to Stanford University,"
Peterson said.
Mariann Byerwalter. vice-presi
dent for business affairs and the uni
versity's chief financial officer, said
Hoagland's leadership has been dis
tinctive for reasons other than fi
nancial gain.
"1 le is very intelligent with a gra
cious personal style." she said. "He
has a quiet, effective way of inspir
ing everyone who works with him to
achieve common goals."
Having previously worked in
m t) n e y - m a n a g e m en t firms,
Hoagland said there is definitely
something special about working
for the University.
"The group [of professionals]
we're able to attract here, because
