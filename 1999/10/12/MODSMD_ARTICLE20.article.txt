# Junior Kagawa sets a higher standard
## 
### Ellie Ritch Contributing writer 
Lindsay Kagawa started her vol
leyball career in second grade with :i
Nerf volleyball.
Her father was a chaperone for
the girl's volleyball team at the high
school, and on game days he would
bring his daughter along to help him.
I let babysitter w;is a setter for the
team, and she taught Lindsay the
ropes instead of letting her watch
TV.
Lveryone who said that little sec
ond-grader setting with a Nerf ball
was headed for greatness was right
on.
Now a junior setter for Stanford.
Kagawa has graduated to real volley
balls and plays ;t ke\ role for the Car
dinal women's volleyball team. She
frequents the starting lineup for the
C ardinal and represents her squad as
a co-captain.
Kagawa moved into the starting
lineup late last season when Robyn
I .ewis. the primary setter and fellow
co-captain, was out with a knee in
jury. Ever since, Kagawa has been
able to step up and fill Lewis' role
confidently.
The setter can be seen as the un
sung hero. While the position often
lacks the drama of huge kills and high
blocks, setters run the offense and
are a key part of the chain that cre
ates these highlights.
Many team members praise Ka

gawa's setting. Freshman outside hit
ler Logan Tom partially attributed
her 26 kills in the Oregon State game
last Friday to Kagawa's fine efforts.
The Stanford squad prides itself on
its abilities to set the middle quickly
and to keep its opponents guessing.
Kagawa noted that her team
mates exceptional abilities simplify
her job as well. "It is a lot easier to set
with such good hitters on the team."
she said.
Kagawa said the extra playing
time she gained in both games and
practice as a result of I .ewis' injury is
a key to her success this year. "More
time always helps. It's a difference of
increased reps versus splitting reps.
Playing 1(K) percent ol the time is ex
hausting but has huge benefits." Ka
gawa said.
Kagawa spent the off-season get
ting stronger and increasing her ver
tical leap. She made a conscious ef
fort to improve her performance at
the net by working on blocking and
defensive tactics.
Increased consistency and accura
cy in passing are Kagawa s current
goals. " The more confident a team is
in their setter, the less time they have
to spend worrying about it while on
the court." she said.
Kagawa stressed how g(xxl it has
been to have Lewis back in action.
Both Ixwis and Kagawa were re
cruited as high-profile players for the
same position in the same year. This
constant competition has obviously
worked out positively, and the two
setters now act as training partners.
As Kagawa put it, "We push each
other, make each other better, and
are the best psychologists for each
other because we understand the role
we are both supposed to play."
Kagawa hails from Albany, Calif.,
and is currently pursuing a major in
political science. Her well rounded
lifestyle shows through immediately,
as she is also working toward a minor
in studio art and is learning sign lan
guage this year.
After her second-grade experi
ence as a bench member of the high
school traveling team, Kagawa
joined the Golden Bear volleyball
club in fifth grade, attending a volley
bull camp that year as well. She
played for the C iolden Bears through
her sophomore year and then joined
a more competitive club team that
held practices at San Jose State.
Kagawa's family was always very
supportive of her commitment to the
sport, and they would constantly
make the three-hour round trip from

Albany to San Jose and back in order
for her to practice.
Most collegiate women's volley
ball players were brought up through
the club team league that Kagawa
played for. The league ran from De
cember to July, and ended its season
with a national championship.
Kagawa's club coach was actually
Dick Montgomery, brother of Mike
Montgomery, the Stanford men's
basketball coach. Kagawa also at
tended Stanford volleyball camp
since she was a freshman in high
school along with other current team
members such as Kerri Walsh.
Michelle Chambers, Tara Conrad
and Ashley Ivy.
Walsh and Sara Clark were also a
part of Team Mizuno with Kagawa
before they joined the Stanford line
up together. Kagawa described the
old Mi/uno squad as, "A type of
hired-gun team." In this way, Kagawa
has been setting for some of her Car
dinal teammates for longer than just
the past three years.
As a captain this year, Kagawa
finds herself faced with new chal
lenges and is able to see new mental
aspects of the game. "We have a
group a vastly different personalities
on our team. Integrating these differ
ences into a compatible team can be a

challenge, hut so far it's working out
well," Kagawa said.
The role of the captain is an essen
tial and mainly off the court position
for the women's volleyball team.
Both Kagawa and Lewis work to
communicate with their teammates,
and to fulfill various administrative
duties and obligations.
Coach Don Shaw described Ka
gawa as. "A good leader, logical
thinker and very creative too. Lind
say adds her own personality to the
team."
The Cardinal squad has had to
count on Kagawa day in and day out
for the past few months, and has ob
viously found favorable results.
"She's done.a great job running
the team on her own. Ever since
Robyn has been out it has been Lind
say, or else," Shaw said.
Kagawa wrapped up last week
end's competition in Los Angeles by
playing the entire game against USC
(No. 17) on Friday night. With 41 as
sists and ;i hitting percentage of .4(H).
Kagawa showed once again that she
is a major force to be reckoned with.
Although the volleyballs have be
come harder and the competition
stiller than in the second grade. Ka
gawa's setting remains a highlight for
audiences.
