Lindsay Kagawa started her vol
leyball career in second grade with :i
Nerf volleyball.
Her father was a chaperone for
the girl's volleyball team at the high
school, and on game days he would
bring his daughter along to help him.
I let babysitter w;is a setter for the
team, and she taught Lindsay the
ropes instead of letting her watch
TV.
Lveryone who said that little sec
ond-grader setting with a Nerf ball
was headed for greatness was right
on.
Now a junior setter for Stanford.
Kagawa has graduated to real volley
balls and plays ;t ke\ role for the Car
dinal women's volleyball team. She
frequents the starting lineup for the
C ardinal and represents her squad as
a co-captain.
Kagawa moved into the starting
lineup late last season when Robyn
I .ewis. the primary setter and fellow
co-captain, was out with a knee in
jury. Ever since, Kagawa has been
able to step up and fill Lewis' role
confidently.
The setter can be seen as the un
sung hero. While the position often
lacks the drama of huge kills and high
blocks, setters run the offense and
are a key part of the chain that cre
ates these highlights.
Many team members praise Ka

gawa's setting. Freshman outside hit
ler Logan Tom partially attributed
her 26 kills in the Oregon State game
last Friday to Kagawa's fine efforts.
The Stanford squad prides itself on
its abilities to set the middle quickly
and to keep its opponents guessing.
Kagawa noted that her team
mates exceptional abilities simplify
her job as well. "It is a lot easier to set
with such good hitters on the team."
she said.
Kagawa said the extra playing
time she gained in both games and
practice as a result of I .ewis' injury is
a key to her success this year. "More
time always helps. It's a difference of
increased reps versus splitting reps.
Playing 1(K) percent ol the time is ex
hausting but has huge benefits." Ka
gawa said.
Kagawa spent the off-season get
ting stronger and increasing her ver
tical leap. She made a conscious ef
fort to improve her performance at
the net by working on blocking and
defensive tactics.
Increased consistency and accura
cy in passing are Kagawa s current
goals. " The more confident a team is
in their setter, the less time they have
to spend worrying about it while on
the court." she said.
Kagawa stressed how g(xxl it has
been to have Lewis back in action.
Both Ixwis and Kagawa were re
cruited as high-profile players for the
