# Rescomp adds to clusters
## Tresidder and Meyer updated with new software 
### Sameer Ahmed 
Have you ever walked into the
computer clusters in your dorms
and have been blinded by the new,
neon-blue Apple computers?
Thank the Residential Computing
Program.
Since 1984, when Stanford es
tablished its first microcomputer
cluster in Roble Hall, Rescomp
has attempted to provide every
housed student with the most ef
fective computer resources.
This year, Rescomp has added
new hardware, updated its soft
ware and upgraded in-room con
nections to make the campus com
puters easier to use and more ac
cessible.
In addition to the neon-bluc
Apple computers, the Apple Pow
erMac G3/350 minitowers, in the
residence clusters, Rescomp has
added new HP LaserJet printers
and some new Apple 17-inch mon
itors.
Furthermore, Rescomp has uni
fied the computer clusters in
Meyer Library, Tresidder Union
and the residences.
"The most important change
this year is that the software in the
public computer clusters at Tresid
der and Meyer has been updated
to match the software in the resi
dences around campus," said
Jamey Frank, assistant director of
program operations at Residential
Computing.

Before this year, the software in
Meyer and Tresidder was different
than the software in the residence
computer clusters, making it more
difficult for students to use both
sets of computers.
The union of the software in
Tresidder, Meyer and the residen
tial clusters was made possible be
cause of the merger between
Rescomp and Research Instruc
tional Technology Services in
1998.
Most of these changes are part
of standard equipment replace
ment cycles, conducted by
Rescomp. Right now, Rescomp is
working on a three-year replace
ment cycle for residential cluster
computers and a four-year cycle
for the active equipment that sup
ports the in-room network connec
tions.
These cycles are needed to keep
the computers updated with newer
technology that comes out every
year.
"The processor-intensive soft
ware people use for techie classes
makes older computers with slow
er processors, smaller hard drives
and less memory inadequate," said
Ethan Rikleen, network and sys
tems administrator at Rescomp.
"Software companies update and
modify applications constantly,
and they just keep getting bigger
and bigger, albeit more powerful.
"After about three years, our
computers seem to need more and

more maintenance — they get a
huge amount of use — making it fi
nancially impractical to maintain
them."
Yet with all of the new addi
tions. Rescomp has had surprising
ly few problems.
"The database that stores our
info went down a couple times
right at the start of the year, but the
outages were relatively short and
unrelated to our updates," Rikleen
said.
Rescomp has also been having
some problems with the MacLe
land required log-in feature, used
to secure the computers in Tresid
der and Meyer.
Errors occur when the log-in
feature interacts with Assimilator,
used in the residence clusters to
keep up-to-date software on the
Macs. Officials hope to solve the
problems soon.
In the future, Rescomp will con
tinue to work to make computing
at Stanford more efficient.
It plans to add new mini-clus
ters in Potter and Robinson, so the
students there no longer have to
use the main Sterling Quad cluster.
At the same time, the Sterling
Quad cluster will also be re
designed with new furniture.
Also, the old Apple PowerMac
7600 computers in Meyer 260 will
be replaced with new iMacs.
And hopefully, by midyear, at
least one PC will be provided in
each large dorm cluster.
