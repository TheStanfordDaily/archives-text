### Shannon M. Ashford Contributing writer 
Sanskriti, a student organization
promoting awareness of South
Asian culture, is expanding its orga
nization's mission to include com
munity service.
Under the leadership of co-chairs
Raj Duvvuri, a junior, senior
Kaushik Mukherjee and community
service chair Amit Chadha, a junior,
the group will coordinate service ac
tivities with organizations in the Bay
Area and at Stanford, as well as de
velop some of its own service pro
jects within the coming year.

"In the future we hope to estab
lish a tradition and focus on commu
nity service within Sanskriti because
we feel this can only benefit our or
ganization. our members and the
community at large," said Mukher
jee.
Ciroup members will participate
in projects such as ones that promote
service in India and advocate health
outreach in the South Asian Bay
Area community. Other projects
will focus on education in the com
munity. One of the group's own ser
vice activities will include a day ol
service dedicated to Mohandas
Gandhi.

While community service will be
an additional focus of Sanskriti. the
organization, however, will not lose
sight of its overall mission of expos
ing the Stanford community to
South Asian culture.
"We wanted to emphasize com
munity service this year in an at
tempt to give back something to the
community that has given so much
to us by supporting our cultural pro
grams. issues, conferences and other
events," said Mukherjee.
" This effort adds a new dimen
sion to our mission, but does not
change our focus on the South Asian
community."
