### Peter Stair 
Justice Frank Richardson, a
Stanford graduate and former Cali
fornia Supreme Court judge, died
Oct. 5 of Parkinson's Disease in
Sacramento. He was 85.
Frequently a dissenter on the lib
eral courts between 1974 and 1983,
colleagues respected his tough, open
mind and principled, respectful per
sonality.
"Justice Richardson was known
for his thoughtful and insightful
legal skills and his kind and always
courteous demeanor," California
Supreme Court Chief Justice
Ronald M. George said in a state
ment last week. "He embodied the
concept of the judicial tempera
ment."
During his tenure in the Court,

Richardson strongly supported de
mocratic ballot initiatives, writing
opinions upholding 1978's Proposi
tion 13, which cut property taxes,
and 1983's Proposition 8. which stip
ulated restitution from criminals to
victims and increased sentences for
repeat offenders.
He also wrote the opinion that
upheld the right of UC-Davis' law
school to prefer minority applicants
for admission.
Yet. far more often, he was the
conservative dissenter. Of the 129
cases the court heard in 1982. he
voted in the minority 36 times, more
that twice as frequently as the next
most dissenting justice.
Saying that he was "more inter
ested in the brakes than the acceler
ator." he voted against majorities
that mandated state-paid abortions

for low-income women, disallowed
apartment owners the right to refuse
rental to families with children and
narrowed the scope of the death
penalty.
Describing his lonely dissents as
"wholesome," he once said "a dis
sent can cause the majority to be
perhaps a little more careful in their
study and phrasing of an opinion
Today's dissent may be tomorrow's
majority opinion."
Richardson graduated from
Stanford in 1935 and from the Law
School in 1938. After retiring from
the Court in 1983, he went to work
briefly as chief lawyer for the De
partment of the Interior, before re
tiring to Sacramento in 1986, where
he spent some time as a visiting pro
lessor at the Pepperdine Law School
and the Whittier Law School.
