## Attorneys begin jury selection for Matthew Shepard case 
### 
LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) —
Aaron McKinney beat gay college
student Matthew Shepard on the
windswept Wyoming prairie, but his
judgment was clouded by drugs and
alcohol. McKinnev's attorney said
yesterday as jury selection began in
his murder trial.
"We're not going to contest the
cause of death or that he died as a
result of a beating from Aaron McK
inney along with Russell Hender
son," attorney Dion Custis told
prospective jurors. "We're not going
to point the finger at Russell I len
derson.
"This is not a case where we're
going to contend that Aaron McKin

ney was insane. However, his mental
state will certainly be a crucial ques
tion for you to answer."
C'ustis' comments marked the
first time he has unveiled a strategy
for defending McKinney. who is fac
ing the death sentence if convicted of
first-degree murder in the beating
last year.
Henderson, 22. received two life
sentences after pleading guilty in
April to felony murder and kidnap
ping.
C'ustis told the prospects he was
concerned about the widespread
attention stemming from the case,
which brought gay-rights issues to
the forefront. '"I don't think anyone

here is going to suggest this is a hate
crime," he said.
Prosecutor Cal Rerucha warned
the candidates that they must treat
both sides fairly, regardless of their
prejudices. "Whether you're
Catholic or Muslim, if you are
straight or gay. everyone is treated
equal," he said.
The two attorneys addressed 59
prospective jurors as the process
began to select a panel to hear the
case.
McKinney, 22, chatted quietly
with his attorneys, looked at his
notes and smiled occasionally as the
attorneys spoke.
By the end of Monday. 21

prospective jurors had been dis
missed. including one man whom
reporters saw pass a note to Shep
ard's mother. Judy, during the lunch
break. The man indicated the note
expressed his condolences.
State District Judge Barton Voigt
sent the juror home when court
reconvened, and said he was consid
ering placing him in contempt.
The process began with a pool of
25(t candidates, which is about the
average si/e for a murder case in
Albany County District Court.
McKinney's father. William, sat
near the back of the room just in
front of a row of news reporters,
keeping his eyes downcast most of

the time. He was accompanied by
three friends or family members.
Shepard's parents were in a back
row of the spectator section, across
the aisle from McKinney. At one
point, Mrs. Shepard put her arm
around her husband's shoulders.
As the trial began, small groups
of anti-gay protesters and people
dressed as angels demonstrated out
side the courthouse.
Seventeen members of Angel
Action, wearing golden halos and
costumes made of while bedsheets,
stood silently in the street to send a
message of love, said spokeswoman
Romaine Patterson, 21, of State Col
lege. Pa.

In an area blocked off for
protesters, six followers of the Rev.
Fred Phelps. 69. of Topeka, Kan.,
waved signs bearing anti-gay slo
gans. Both groups left the court
house area by late morning.
Although several news satellite
trucks were parked near the build
ing. the trial drew little interest from
residents.
"You know, maybe the town just
wants it over." said Ben Rashford,
23. a University of Wyoming gradu
ate student. *'It took on a surreal
aspect at the first trial, but then real
ity set in. Laramie is not that differ
ent than any place else. People like
to think that but it's not."
