A Daily editor wonders
if she will ever find
direction

Once upon a time, I had direc
tion. My whole family works
in the medical field, and I
decided that I must continue the tra
dition by becoming a doctor. During
four years of high school my decision
never wavered, and when I
exchanged good-byes with my teach
ers, some of them addressed me as
Dr. Downs.
I tuned out President C asper and
other administrators during Orienta
tion weekend when they spoke about
"finding your academic passion." My
passion was medicine, and I'd major
in Humßio in preparation for medi
cal school. Let other people explore
their academic interests, mine were
already found.
At least I thought they were. My
first quarter consisted of chemistry,
calculus, and mv Introduction to the
Humanities class: Freedom and Eros
in Philosophy and Art. Once I began
to prefer writing papers on what pur
pose art serves in society over com
pleting problem sets, I knew I'd soon
be joining the ranks of the direction
less at Stanford
I he horror! At first, I contemplat
ed stopping out until I discovered
what else 1 could major in. Hut then I
realized that Stanford would be a
more conducive atmosphere for this
than home would be.
I decided to sample classes in dif
ferent areas that had always interest
ed me until I happened upon my aca
demic passion. 1 thought this could
be done by the end of freshman year
and am currently forced to concede

that that was too lofty a goal.
Now I'm in the lirsl quarter of my
sophomore year and remain not only
undeclared hut undecided as well as
to what I want to major in. My feel
ings about this are in a constant state
of fluctuation.
At times, I feel guilty that my
mom pays an ever-increasing tuition
to enable me to take classes that may
not even contribute to either my
major or fulfilling my CJERs.
She assures me not to fret, that
there is no other way I could find
what I want to major in and that I
have plenty of time before the Uni
versity requires me to declare.
Sure, Stanford is pretty lenient
about letting students declare at the
end of their sophomore year and
even letting them register for classes
at the beginning of their junior year
if they remain undeclared.
But students who have taken very
few classes in the area they finally
decide to major in face the challenge
of fulfilling its requirements in a lim
ited period of time if they want to
graduate with their class.
Then there is the issue of passion
versus practicality. 1 debate whether
I should major in something 1 love
even if it means having no assurance
of job offerings upon graduation, or
if I should major in something 1 can
tolerate in hopes of having a source
of income to pay off my student
loans.
I anxiously await the class that
decides my major for me. And if I
don't find it soon, I'll be looking for
the booth at the Career Fair advertis
ing "professional student" as a viable
career choice.
