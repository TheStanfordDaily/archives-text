Relaxed fit.
At Deloitte Consulting, we offer challenging and rewarding opportunities to work beside the best and the brightest
people in order to help solve complex business problems. We work in concert with companies to help create change at the
highest levels. Yet our atmosphere is relaxed and confident, never arrogant.This flexible, collaborative approach prompted
Computerworld to rate us as the "most user-friendly" among the major consulting players.
We're looking for top performers to participate in either our Systems Analyst or Business Analyst Program.
As a Systems Analyst at Deloitte Consulting, you will work with seasoned professionals on high-profile assignments, as
well as take part in technical and management consulting training courses offered around the country. After training, you
will hit the ground running - and take on meaningful responsibilities and tackle significant business problems leveraging
state-of-the-art technologies.
The Business Analyst Program is designed for individuals wishing to pursue an MBA from a top business school.
As part of a client engagement team, you'll develop both consulting and business competencies.
If you want to work hard and work with the best, and be part of a firm that puts cooperation and
collaboration ahead of hierarchies and individual agendas, relax...you'll fit in perfectly.
