# Gearing for a succesfull year
## ASSU execs vow to reach students 
### Alice Brown Editorial staff 
Full of energy and confidence
and fueled by what they see as a suc
cessful start to the school year,
ASSU President Mike Levin, a ju
nior, and Vice President John Mills,
a doctoral student in genetics, are
now aiming to increase the ASSU's
partnership with the Stanford's stu
dent body.
Last week University President
Gerhard Casper officially approved
the division of the ASSU Senate
into separate graduate and under
graduate bodies, enabling the
ASSU to "more effectively address
issues relating to each [group of stu
dents]," Mills said.
Both groups meet weekly and
less formally than last years' highly
structured and more infrequent
meetings, according to Levin.
"Either group is [now] stronger
than the old senate," he said.

There are weekly meeting for the
ASSU's executive committee, a
group made up of Levin. Mills, the
leadership of the undergraduate
and graduate senates and the finan
cial manager.
The amendment to split the sen
ate, passed in last spring's elections,
has "forced communication" be
tween the groups, and each is more
aware of the issues facing both
groups than ever before, according
to Levin.
In their smaller and more effi
cient formats, the two separate
groups are "beneficial for us inter
nally. as well as for our relationship
to the administration." Levin added.
Levin and Mills mentioned that
last year was an important year for
building credibility between the ex
ecutive ASSU and the administra
tion.
Now the pair has its sights set on
promoting awareness of the ASSU
and involvement with the student
body.
"We've convinced the adminis
tration that we re a usetul resource
lor them. Now we need to convince
the students of the same â€” to get
them to come to us," Mills said.
Much, if not most, of what the
ASSU does is "driven by conversa
tions with students," Levin said.
"We're here as a resource for the
students. We need to work together
to get things accomplished," Mills
added.
Levin and Mills have already
begun the process of meeting with
all .SO student representatives on
University committees in order to
ensure that each one is being heard.
A good working relationship
with both senates has set in motion
all aspects ol the platform they an
nounced when they ran for office
last spring. "Everything we said was
going to happen is. and then some."
Levin said.
One of the new issues that has
arisen is whether new 1 oyon Eating
Clubs should be built alter the exist
ing ones are torn down.
"Its been an honor to serve on
the eating clubs working group,"
Levin said, "and I'm pleased that the
administration has listened to stu
dent voice on whether new eating
clubs should be built."
In terms of issues that were part
of their platform. Levin and Mills
have been working to accomplish

what tlicv promised.
Their projects include making
Tresidder more student-friendly,
finding solutions for transportation
problems, increasing student safety
by improving the lighting in poorly
lit areas of campus and continuing to
improve the course guide.
In addition, they hope to increase
awareness of their Stanford Savers
program, one which provides stu
dent discounts at a number of area
restaurants and stores.

The undergraduate senate and
graduate student council each have
their separate agendas, but Levin
and Mills say they help hold the two
together.
The undergraduate senate is pri
marily focused on improving stu
dent space and maximizing the ben
efits of land use. finding solutions to
any problems that may arise when
parking for freshmen is prohibited
next year and enhancing communi
cation between the ASSU and the

student body.
The GSC is involved with the
general use permit issue, improving
health care and health insurance for
graduate students' spouses and chil
dren and working to improve child
care for graduate students.
Levin and Mills see the months
ahead as an "exciting challenge,"
and look forward to "more fully in
volving the undergraduate senate
and the GSC to accomplish expo
nentially more," Mills said.
