## Military coup in Pakistan challenges new democracy 
### 
ISLAMABAD. Pakistan (AP) — Pak
istani troops staged a coup against the
democratically elected government l ues
day, seizing state-run media and confining
the prime minister to his home in a lightning
move that raised tensions in the world's
newest nuclear region.
In a televised address. Army Chief Gen.
Pervaiz Musharraf accused the democrati
cally elected government of "systematically
destroying" state institutions and driving
the economy toward collapse.
"You are all well aware of the kind of
turmoil and uncertainty that our country
has gone through in recent times." Mushar
raf said. "Not only have all the institutions
been played around with and systematically
destroyed, the economy too is in a state of
collapse."
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was under
apparent house arrest in Islamabad hours
after he tried to fire Musharraf as army
chief and replace him with his ally. Gen. Zia
IJddin. former head of Pakistan's secret ser
vice.
As troops moved through the main
cities, many Pakistanis danced in the streets
and waved flags, celebrating the ousting of a
prime minister who has become increasing
ly unpopular.

Sharif has been accused of trying to con
solidate his power by weakening institu
tions such as the judiciary, provincial gov
ernments and the opposition, and of using
heavy-handed tactics to quell opposition
protests in recent weeks.
Word of the coup led the army of nucle
ar rival India to go on high alert along the
border between the two countries, a senior
officer in India's northern command in
Kashmir said.
In New Delhi, Indian Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee held a crisis meeting
with his top security and foreign policy
advisers. The reports from Pakistan "are
causing grave concern." said Vajpayee's
spokesman. Ashok Tandon.
In an apparent warning to India.
Musharraf said "no outside forces" should
try to take advantage of the "prevailing sit
uation in Pakistan .... We shall preserve
the integrity and sovereignty of our country
to the last drop of blood."
Tuesday's developments followed
reports in recent weeks of a yawning rift
between the military and the civilian gov
ernment in this impoverished and over
whelmingly Muslim country of 140 million
people.
fhe army has ruled Pakistan for 25 of its

52-year history, and army takeovers have
happened repeatedly. But democratically
elected governments have been in place
since 1985.
Sharif tired Musharraf while the military
leader was on a visit to Sri Lanka. Mushar
raf Hew back to Pakistan and was met by a
large contingent of soldiers at the airport in
the southern city of Karachi.
The conflict between the two men devel
oped this summer after the prime minister
ordered militants to withdraw from Indian
territory in the Kashmir region, ending two
months of bitter fighting with India.
Musharraf reportedly orchestrated the
incursion into Kashmir, and the withdrawal
of the militants was considered humiliating
to Pakistan's military.
President Clinton had negotiated the
withdrawal with Sharif amid fears the bor
der dispute would escalate into an all-out
war between the world's two newest nucle
ar powers.
Pakistan carried out its first nuclear tests
in May last year, and has insisted it will
maintain a nuclear arsenal to defend itself
against India, which also conducted its first
nuclear tests last year. Pakistan has fought
and lost three wars with India.
A senior State Department official said

the United States wants to see "the earliest
possible restoration" of democracy in Pak
istan. But the administration withheld an
official statement on the situation as it
awaited a formal announcement from
Islamabad.
The senior official, asking not to be iden
tified, said that during the first hours after
Sharif was deposed, no U.S. embassy offi
cial had been in contact with any official of
the replacement regime.
At the Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth
Bacon noted that Pakistan's nuclear pro
gram has been in the hands of the military
so the seizure of power by the Army left
that situation unchanged.
Before the televised announcement of a
military takeover. U.S. State Department
spokesman James Rubin said: "If there has
been a coup we would obviously seek the
earliest possible restoration of democracy in
Pakistan."
Former Pakistani Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto, speaking with BBC World
TV in London, said she doesn't support
coups but was sympathetic to the army's
desire to get rid of Sharif.
"My message to the army is that if you
were provoked into this action the world
will understand, if you give a firm date for

fair elections and go hack to the barracks."
Musharraf's address, which he delivered
in English, was brief. He accused Sharif of
imposing "self-serving policies ... that
rocked the very foundation of the federa
tion of Pakistan," and said the army
takeover was a response to public demand.
The military takeover came after Sharif
announced Musharraf's removal and
appeared on national television shaking the
hand of his named replacement. Gen. Zia
Uddin. head of the secret service.
Within hours, the army was fanning out
in the capital and other cities. Soldiers
jumped the fence around the central TV
building in Islamabad and seized it. witness
es said.
Troops surrounded and closed Islam
abad International Airport, while others
were seen taking over the houses of several
top ministers — including Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz and Information Minister
Mushahid Hussein.
International phone lines out of the cap
ital were cut. while television began broad
casting nationalistic songs and footage of
Pakistani troops and heavy armor in
parades. A bank holiday was declared for
Wednesday, apparently to prevent a run on
the currency.
