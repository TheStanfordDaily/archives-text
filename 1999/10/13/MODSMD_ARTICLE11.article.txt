# Clinton urges Senate to postpone vote on test ban treaty
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —The battle over the nucle
ar test ban treaty turned into a political minefield of
brinksmanship and miscalculation, ending with Presi
dent Clinton in full retreat and trying to stave off a
humiliating defeat.
Lacking enough support to win after demanding that
Republicans hold a vote, Clinton was forced into an
eleventh-hour about-face, pleading with the Senate to
delay the treaty rather than defeat it.
Analysts began talking about a lame-duck president.
Republicans, seething from failed battles on every
thing from tax cuts to Clinton's impeachment, refused
to let the president off the hook easily. They toyed with
him over whether to defeat the treaty outright or post

pone it until after he leaves office in 2(K) 1.
All that aside, some Republicans — led John Warn
er of Virginia — felt that a vote now to reject the treaty
would be a mistake for both sides and contrary to
America's national interests.
It was an embarrassing outcome for an agreement
that Clinton once had hailed as "the longest sought,
hardest fought prize in arms control history." with roots
in the Eisenhower administration.
Arms control experts faulted Clinton for failing to
wage an effective campaign for the treaty after signing it
with great fanfare at the U.N. General Assembly in 19%.
"The administration got caught Hat-footed." said
Michael Mandelbaum of the Council on Foreign Rela

tions. "They thought they were going to be in a position
to beat (Senate Majority Leader Trent) Lott over the
head with this because he would never bring it up. But
suddenly ho turned around and decided to bring it up,
which put them in an awkward position."
"If this is as important as the administration says it is,
you wonder why is this the first time we've heard about
it." said Mandelbaum. a onetime foreign policy adviser
to Clinton. "For most people ... it's seen as a partisan
issue and not a national security issue."
Clinton has mentioned the treaty from time to time
but did not make a sustained effort until Republicans
suddenly accepted his challenge to hold a vote. They
scheduled it in less than two weeks, even before the

Foreign Relations Committee had devoted a single
hearing to it.
It became "this game of political chicken. And this
could be the moment that signals the start of the lame
duck period of Clinton's presidency," said John Parachi
ni. a national security expert at the Monterey Institute of
International Studies. "It's a mistake that's unfortunate
not only for foreign and defense policy reasons. It's also
unfortunate for the power of this presidency."
The administration appeared lulled by signs that
pointed to victory. Clinton collected testimonials for the
treaty from military leaders. Nobel laureates and the
directors of the nation's nuclear labs. A poll said that K2
percent of Americans supported a nuclear test ban.
