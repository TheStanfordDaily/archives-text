A Daily editor
rethinks the way we
look at college

Well, the career fair has come
and gone, resumes have
been passed out like scripts
in a trendy Hollywood restaurant,
and students can feel a little more at
peace in their search for a career.
I guess I got lucky. I spent a lot of
time ignoring my true passions about
my future. I came to Stanford think
ing I'd major in Mechanical Engi
neering (actually, I almost went to
MI T to do the same, but that's a ter
rifying tale for another time).
But ME was not for me. I had
some major issues and ideological
differences with the topic. Actually, I
just don't enjoy physics enough to
make it a major part of my life. I lon
estlv, I really don't enjoy physics
much at all.
So I wandered into the wonderful
world of Computer Science. This is
what almost caught me. I enjoy the
topic. I actually like coding and trying
to figure out why my recursive loop
elicits a reaction from my computer
that is tantamount to I lal's revolution
in 2001: A Space Odyssey.
Hut there's a fine line between
enjoying something and making it a
major part of your life. Sure, 1 could
have majored in CS — if I had,
maybe I would have actually gotten
out of here in four years — but I
know I couldn't have woken up
every morning and been happy with
what my work day would have
looked like.
There's a scene early in Jerry
Maguire where Tom Cruise has a
middle-of-the-night epiphany and
realizes he must change his empty,
ideal-less ways.
[A <inick note: I don't think CS
majors are have no ideals, I'm just try-

ing to draw a small parallel. Please
<lon V send tetters, bombs or computer
viruses. |
Hut I knew programming was not
my calling. Alter tossing and turning
for hours, I realized one night that
writing is my future.
ITie only question I have now is,
why did it take me so long to realize
this?
Some people think Stanford cre
ates this hyper-competitive environ
ment where some students will do
anything to keep up with everyone
else.
I think the real problem can he
even worse. Irving to be "better"
than the next student is one thing, but
blinding yourself to what you love is
the real wrong.
1 know I'm not going to be curing
cancer or ending world hunger. I find
my passion in observing how people
interact with regards to their pas
sions, their dreams and with each
other. I want to write about that so
hopefully others can see what I see.
I stopped worrying a long time ago
about what the guy next to me was
achieving. Sometimes 1 wish every
one could do that. Sometimes I think
too many of us scratched and clawed
our way into this school. It's time to
put an end to that competition.
I know I'm not leaving school
without a degree, but I won't be grad
uating sigma cum laude. Why should
I care?
Iliey say college is the best four
or five — years of your life. If that's
really true, then it's all downhill from
here.
Don't get me wrong. II you love
the path you've chosen, don't second
guess yourself. But there's a long,
long road after this. Someone once
told me that success in college doesn't
necessarily translate into happiness in
life.
If that's true, maybe it's time to
reassess what we consider success.
