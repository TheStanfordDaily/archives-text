Facts are facts
It is ironic that Hossam Fahmy's
chargcs Madeline Albright with duplici
tous intentions regarding the test ban
treaty while at the same time manipulating
"facts" to support a different position than
that which he states.
What begins as a letter legitimately
questioning America's commitment to
world peace rapidly degenerates into a
thinly veiled and unrelated attack against
America, and its Middle Eastern policy.
In the first place, Fahmy declares
unsupported opinions to be facts. "Japan
declared that it would surrender in WWII
and yet the U.S. used atomic bombs."
When did this happen? The only official
Japanese offer to surrender occurred after
the atomic bombs were dropped. This sup
posed declaration of surrender before the
atomic bombs were dropped can't even be
dignified as a myth.
Similarly, the Sudanese factory, which
might or might not have been a chemical
weapons plant, becomes conclusively,
without any supporting evidence, "the fac
tory that produced almost half of the coun
try's supply of children's medications."
The passage about Israel makes
Fahmy's intentions clear. If the U.S. were
really concerned about "preventing others
from acquiring the same power it has,"
than it would want Israel to sign the non
proliferation treaty. But in fact, what both
ers Fahmv is the Israeli occupation of

Palestinian land and the fact that since
Israel has nuclear weapons, it's going to be
more difficult for the Arab countries to ful
fill their avowed goal of destroying Israel
as they've tried to do on numerous occa
sions, some facts which Fahmy decided not
to mention.
The United States, unlike many of the
fine Middle Fasten nations which Fahmy
undoubtedly supports, provides specific
rights to free expression. II Fahmy is going
to address American foriegn policy, how
ever, he should use actual facts, not unsup
ported rhetoric. Or maybe he should just
"tame the ferocious American (and Israeli
beast)" by blowing up some barracks,
hijacking a plane, or killing some Olympic
atheletes. Those are actual facts from his
tory, but we wouldn't want to let the truth
get in the way of a compelling rant, would
we, Mr. Fahmy?

The Issue at stake
Fahmy's statement criticizing American
foreign policy in yesterday's Daily made
some valid points. It is true that American
policy cannot be characterized as that of a
"peaceful dove." However, this is beside
the point. The issue at stake is whether the
United States will join a worldwide effort
to ban nuclear testing or not.
The United States is indeed the only

nation to ever have used nuclear weapons
upon a civilian population. I grew up in
Japan where anti-nuclear sentiment is
understandably very strong. I had a chance
to visit the Peace Memorial in Hiroshima.
Any justification of what happened there
on Aug. 6, 1945 verges on frivolity.
Following the same stream of logic used
in the U.S. to justify dropping the bombs
on Japan, Hitler would have been justified
in incarcerating 5,7()(),(M)() Jews if it would
have brought a swift end to the ongoing
war and saved German lives. Japan would
have been justified in bombing Pearl Har
bor to save Japanese lives from the
formidable U.S. Pacific fleet.
However, focusing ourselves on a nar
row-minded criticism of U.S. policy misses
the point entirely. Japan would most cer
tainly have had no qualms about using a
nuclear weapon on a U.S. city. How could
we speak differently about a Germany
under Nazi rule?
The issue is not about who but about
what. The lessons to be learned from
Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not that the
United States is a "ferocious beast" but
that nuclear arms are immoral, disgusting
and intolerable weapons.
Fahmy suggests that we should "tame
the ferocious beast and take its killing
weapons away." Hut why allow so many
other nations to retain their "killing
weapons?" Is the Russian invasion of
Chechnya somehow more moral than the
U.S. intervention in Kosovo? Did Iraq

have a stronger moral case than the United
States during the Gulf War? I agree with
Fahmy that weapons must be taken away.
However, the effort must he multilateral
and universal.
The nuclear test treaty being discussed
today contains some key problems. How
ever, a comprehensive, worldwide ban on
nuclear testing will discourage further
nuclear proliferation and make disarma
ment among the current nuclear powers a
less complex issue. This is far from a solu
tion, but it is a step in the right direction.
The end of the Cold War has brought
about an era of diminished international
antagonism, but let us not forget that the
possibility of nuclear holocaust continues
to face us daily. If the Republican majority
in Congress chooses to reject the treaty,
the U.S. will aggravate international prolif
eration and forfeit its credibility to deal
with potential nuclear powers.
To help achieve the higher cause of
peace and international prosperity, we
must stop pointing fingers and continue
working toward reducing the terror of
weapons of mass destruction.
The test ban treaty is a constructive step
in shifting international norms away from
reliance on nuclear weapons. Partisanship
should not be tolerated under these cir
cumstances.
