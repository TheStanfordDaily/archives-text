# Fight the good fight
## Not your typical column

Corey Griffin

Apathy.
Who cares?
Between classes,
being treasurer of (enter
your student group here)
and spending time with
my friends in (enter your
house here), I'm hardly

what you'd call apathetic.
I keep myself busy. 1 care about my house,
my activities and my grades, so don't talk
to me about apathy.
I think we all get a little defensive when
someone mentions the word apathy, but
everything about Stanford makes it so easy
to be complacent.
We overall have great housing
(although I'm sure the upperclassmen
squished in Wilbur doubles would disagree
with me). We have much better food than
other universities (even if you can't call
what we eat at Stern dining "food" all the
time). We have famous (and in some cases
infamous) professors. We have student
groups for absolutely anything you would
be interested in (and if there isn't one you
like, you can start one).
Our lives are so comfortable that we
tend to care little about the bigger issues
that might not seem to affect our own little
world that much. That's the problem. The
"bigger" issues do affect our lives and the
lives of the Stanford students to come. It's
that apathy which has seen the loss of tra
ditions. houses and many of the things we
love about Stanford.
Anyone remember a little Cowell house
called Alpha Sig? I vaguely remember
signing a petition and hearing about a
protest in White Plaza after ResEd and
Housing and Dining services decided to
convert the old "co-ed frat" into a sorority.
Did anyone protest for more than an hour?

Was anyone willing to camp outside Old
Union until the administration did some
thing, anything to console the residents of
Alpha Sig?
Even worse is how little we care about
what's going on outside the übiquitous
"Stanford bubble." When is the last time
someone on the Stanford campus was will
ing to be arrested for standing up for what
they believe in?
If Stanford is supposed to be preparing
us for the "real world." then it's far past
time to kick apathy in the butt. Being com
placent and giving up because you don't
think your actions make a difference isn't
going to get any of us very far.
Fortunately, this isn't going to turn into
a sermon about the power of one. I am far
from a preacher, and I know my friends are
already thinking, "Oh great, there goes
Corey ranting again."
I know first hand that it sometimes feels
like we can't do much against a faceless
"administration" that hides behind
bureaucracy. I know you're frustrated
when it feels like you're not being heard. I
know it's easy to be content here at Stan
ford and just give up fighting what you
know is a good fight.
I for one am tired of being a bystander.
I could have easily not applied to write this
column. I, like the rest of you. have many
activities on top of my four classes, but I
felt like I've seen a lot of things that I'm
really happy about and a few things that
have really gotten under my skin. I wanted
the opportunity to lift up those things,
good and bad, to see if they don't strike a
chord with some of you.
I have a feeling that I might upset some
people. In fact, I hope I upset some people.
I decided it would be too easy for me to
leave Stanford without at least trying to

make some difference, and that's why I'm
writing.
Consequently, this isn't going to be your
typical Daily column. Of course, hv saying
that I have actually doomed myself to ho
like every other Daily column, hut I am
going to try and keep up my promise
longer than most. To start, here is a short
list of things 1 wont write about:
The Post Office — Just too easy.
Dating — You're either with someone
or you're not. Deal.
California — I am not Garry Grundy.
The Meaning of Life — There's no one
answer. You need to figure it out for your
self. Anyone who says otherwise is trying
to sell you something.
Dead Week — I will be physically ill if I
have to read another column about study
ing / procrastinating during dead week.
Our time at Stanford is too short (and
my time as a columnist is even shorter) to
gripe about some of the more mundane
and, in the end, inconsequential parts of
student life. It is time that we all stepped
out of own little worlds for a while to
change the things we're concerned about.
Just the other day my suitemate said.
"Change cannot occur until there is unrest
and until that unrest is voiced." I couldn't
agree more. Hopefully, this column will
both cause a little unrest and voice some as
well.
That is my column; read at your own
risk.
