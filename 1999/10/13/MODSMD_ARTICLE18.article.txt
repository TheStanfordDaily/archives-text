£ ■ xcuse me, where are the infor-
I i mation tables for martyrdom?"
I m sitting under a tree at a picnie table
in front of I residder, surveying the after
math of today's Career Fair.
I wo or three times per year, legions of
corporations sweep into the heart of our
otherwise bucolic campus. With the pick
up line of logo-emblazoned Frisbees and
the loaded small talk of stock options,
earnest young recruiters seduce us into the
9-to-5 working world.
It's the red light district of Corporate
America.
"You walk in there and immediately
think that these are the only jobs there
are," said a reporter friend.
Another journalist was more succinct.
"I avoided it like the plague," he said.
1 rode into the plaza at 1 p.m. yester

day, headed to class. Investment banking
firms lined the paths to my left. Software
companies huddled under their umbrellas
ahead. I was suddenly in the midst of a sea
of management consultants, talking sign
ing bonuses like NFL draft picks.
I wandered to the headquarters table.
Now. my interests lie in the loosely con
nected fields of politics, journalism and
law. To the professional career placement
specialist, these fall under the loosely
defined category of "public service."
At this career fair at Stanford, a univer
sity that supplied a number of leaders to
the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1%4,
these fall under the loosely defined cate
gory of "Huh?"
"Hi! Where's the public service area?"
I ask.
I get a blank look.
"Well, everyone over there" — gestur
ing to 90 percent of the tables — "is look

ing for technical majors. The all-majors
tables are kind of scattered around." he
says.
Thanks.
I shuftle through the crowds on my
bicycle to discover, yes. a smattering of
booths without words such as "program
mer" or "venture capital" splashed over
them.
And hallelujah, quite a few fellow
fuzzies were investigating the offerings of
the City of San Jose, the Inner-City Teach
ing Corps, assorted environmental groups
and other professional do-gooders.
Hut those tables were the islands in the
stream of source code and straight-laced
corporate culture.
Now. I'm not opposed to money. I like
money. T he newspaper pays me, and I pay
I lelming's Auto Repair to get my car back.
But 1 wonder about those students who,
drawn by dollar signs, suppress their inter-

ests in the humanities, arts, theoretical sci
ences or public service.
Sure, all those companies are happy it)
pay you a lot of money right out of school,
but do you think Einstein's parents were
thrilled when he quit the Swiss patent office?
1 spoke with my history adviser after
one career fair last spring. She said that
every one of her advisees she had seen
that day was suffering from acute career
anxiety. "No one's going to hire me — I
can't program." one told her.
A friend, who is on the fuzzy side of
fuzzy, told me recently that he had just
been to his first CSIO6A section, "and it's
already kicking my ass."
Pointing out that he is by all accounts
destined to be a starving liberal arts major
like myself. I suggested that perhaps he
select a different course of study.
"It's something that everyone should
take." he said.

The poor guv has been brainwashed,
but I'll keep working on him. I suppose 1
should applaud his choice to broaden him
self. hut I'll do it from my beach chair in
the sunshine, history text in hand.
In short, being on a first-name basis
with all the Sweet Hall consultants isn't all
it's cracked up to be.
Resist the temptation. At the career
fair, mooch the free stuff from the techni
cal booths — hey. I've gotten a CD holder,
and yes. a couple of Frisbees — and go do
your American Studies seminar reading.
Do what you want to do. Someone will
pay you to do it.

livan Noriihy, a senior majoring in history
and American studies, doesn't have Shak
fleas hnt can kick field goals. I lis column
will appear here when Kim and David want
it to.
