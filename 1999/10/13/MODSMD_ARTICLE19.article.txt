# Company spearheads merit-based ticketing
## Justarrive aims for solution 
### Jim Tankersley Senior staff writer 
Like a lot of Cardinal basketball
junkies, Dan Levy dragged himself
out of bed at 7 a.m. Feb. to stand in
line for the Stanford-Connecticut
game. And, like most of the fans wait
ing outside Maples Pavilion, he grew
impatient when the doors opened but
the line didn't move.
Unlike the rest of the crowd. Levy
did something about it.
"I saw how long it took them to
punch tickets and return them," he
said. 'I thought, 'there's got to be a

better way to do this.' "
That better way, a "swipe-card"
system that Levy and three friends
developed over the next few months
and pitched to the Athletics Depart
ment late in the spring, will turn gold
today when the department officially
announces it as its new ticketing sys
tem for men's basketball games.
Fhe designers call it the first merit
based ticketing system in the country
"I think that's pretty pioneering."
I ,evy said, "at least for college athlet
ics, and for ticketing in general."
Basketball marketing officials
love the system, which eliminates

pie-season ticket campouts and re
winds loyal fans with tickets to high
demand games. But adopting it was a
risk lor both the department and the
four men who invented it.
Stanford took a chance on new
technology and entrepeneurs work
ing on their liist project together.
For their part, I cvv. now a senior,
and his friends senior Matt Koidin
and IW9 graduates Jared Kopf and
Jonathan Bruck -all gave up jobs or
internships to form Justarrive, Inc.
I.cv\ left Merrill Lynch in the sum
mer to concentrate on the project and
Koidin passed up Microsoft.
