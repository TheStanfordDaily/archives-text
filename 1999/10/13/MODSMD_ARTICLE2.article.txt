Fans hoping to see the Stanford
men's basketball team battle confer
ence powerhouses such as IJCLA
and Arizona this season will have to
"earn" their way into Maples Pavil
ion by watching teams such as
Marathon Oil and Sacramento
State.
The new ticketing system, which
the Athletics Department will an
nounce today, will sell an unlimited
number of unguaranteed student
season tickets. It tracks students'
game attendance — including
games over winter break — and re
wards loyal fans with seats at the
season's most popular contests.
Designers of the system — two
Stanford seniors and two recent

students to camp out for more than

unlimited number of students to
sign up for passes online at

$25 for a Sixth Man membership,
which gives them a chance to sit in
the sideline student section. Neither
membership guarantees access to
any game.
What the membership does buy
is a Justarrive Card, which acts as a
game ticket when officials scan it at
the Maples entrance. For most of
the season's games — those desig
