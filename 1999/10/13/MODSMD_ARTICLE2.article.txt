# Basketball ticket plan unveiled
## 
### Jim Tankersley Senior staff writer 
Fans hoping to see the Stanford
men's basketball team battle confer
ence powerhouses such as IJCLA
and Arizona this season will have to
"earn" their way into Maples Pavil
ion by watching teams such as
Marathon Oil and Sacramento
State.
The new ticketing system, which
the Athletics Department will an
nounce today, will sell an unlimited
number of unguaranteed student
season tickets. It tracks students'
game attendance — including
games over winter break — and re
wards loyal fans with seats at the
season's most popular contests.
Designers of the system — two
Stanford seniors and two recent
graduates who founded Justarrive.
Inc., last spring (Please see story on
page 6) — say it is the first merit
based ticketing system in the nation.
Athletics Department officials say
it's the best way to allocate a scarce,
high-demand commodity.
"It is fair," said John Hopkins,
the men's basketball marketing co

ordinator who oversees the Sixth
Man Club, 'it serves the entire stu
dent population as more of a game
by-game operation. It opens it up to
anyone on campus."
A ticket-buying frenzy that drove
students to camp out for more than
a week in front of Maples last year
prompted the changes. The new sys
tem eliminates lines by allowing an
unlimited number of students to
sign up for passes online at

Oct. 18 to 21.
Students who register will pay
$10 for a regular membership allow
ing them into upper-level seats, or
$25 for a Sixth Man membership,
which gives them a chance to sit in
the sideline student section. Neither
membership guarantees access to
any game.
What the membership does buy
is a Justarrive Card, which acts as a
game ticket when officials scan it at
the Maples entrance. For most of
the season's games — those desig
nated "non-priority" — only the
first 1,200 students to arrive at
Fans pay for tickets on a game
by-game basis, either bv check or
credit card. The maximum price any
student can pay for the season is $55.
the same as last year.
For each non-priority game they
attend, students earn 10 Fanaddict
points, which a database will record.
When the opponents traditionally
most popular with fans — a list that
this year includes Arizona, UCLA
and California — come to town, fans
with the most points earn guaran
teed seating.
Before each "priority" game,
Hopkins will examine the database
and set a cut-offline, with the goal of
granting guaranteed seating to the
6(H) to l.(KK) fans with the most
points from games attended.
Students can grab the rest of the
seats on a first-come, first-serve
basis, but the Athletics Department
won't allow fans to begin lining up
before f> a.m. on any game day. 1 lop
kins said.
The need for points to guarantee
seating will motivate fans to attend
early season games, where student
presence is usually small. Hopkins
said.
Team members agreed. "I think
it's great." said redshirt sophomore
forward Jason Collins. "The more
fans the better, especially for the
early season games."
Student supporters said the sys
tem should pay off for basketball

die-hards.
"Last year. I felt that some of the
hard-core fans were not necessarily
inside Maples where they belong."
said senior Doug Mooney. a mem
ber of the Sixth Man executive com
mittee. "The strength of this system
is that it should reward the most en
thusiastic and hard-core members of
the Sixth Man."
It will also reward those who live
near campus. Stanford plays at
home four times over winter break.
Those games are not usually well-at
tended by students away from the
Bay Area for the holidays, but the
fans who do show up will still earn 10
points each game.
The system replaces a tentative
plan announced last year that would
have allowed a five-day ticket line,
preference for past Sixth Man mem
bers and oversight by the ASSIJ.
Hopkins said his office worked
closely with University administra
tors. who denounced the week-long
campout last year because it took
students away from coursework. to
design an acceptable plan.
Dean of Students Marc Wais said
yesterday that he had not fully re
viewed the plan, but that he would
support anything that would mini
mize or eliminate camping out for
tickets.
Hopkins agreed. "Being a die
hard student doesn't necessarily
mean camping out for two weeks or
two days." he said. "I'd rather they
bring that energy on game day."
