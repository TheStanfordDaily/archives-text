# Walk-ons happy for housing
## 
### Peter Stair 
In the Old Wild West it was not
often that one had the chance to draw
late or more than once, but 85 Stan
ford undergraduates did just that as
"walk-ins" in the fall housing draw.
According to Kathleen Brans
field, manager of Housing Assign
ment Services, many entered the
pool from the summer waiting list
after refusing a spring housing assign
ment. not listing enough housing op
tions or drawing below the housing
cutoff number during their unpre
ferred year.
Others simply showed up hoping
for a place to live on the Stanford
campus. 1 lappily, most found one.
Senior Sonali Maitra, after
months of not knowing where she
would end up. said flatly. "I'm happy
1 was housed."
Maitra ended up in the former
Delta Kappa Lpsilon house at 5 C )2
Mayfield.
Maitra, who lived in a similar
house last winter after the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity lost their house at
6801 .omita, said that people who use
the walk in draw are moving in under
different circumstances.
Since most were coming from a se

mester abroad the previous quarter,
she joked, "each had a spirit of ad
venture."
Others were not so happy with
their assignment and chose to move
off campus instead.
Present at the draw was nearly
every member of DKL. which lost its
house during the summer.
I hough the fraternity nearl\ Inst
ils house last spring, members left for
the summer expecting to return itÂ»
their old house. Junior Peter Don
glas, a DKL member, said, "l ast
spring we said, "please let lis know |il
we're going to lose the house| so we
can get good housing.' and they told
lis we were fine."
None of the members ol Dkl
were allowed to live in their old
house, leaving their house entirely
for other walk-ins.
Douglas, a junior living this year in
mostly sophomore lovon Hall, did
not object to his housing, he said, but
he was perturbed with the process.
"I got stuck |with | Uie most expen
sive meal plan on campus." he said.
"Since I (.lid not have a chance to
draw |in the spring], that adds to my
annoyance."
Branslield, who runs the draws,
said that many students not in Dou

glas' circumstance were quite pleased
with their eventual housing assign
ment, largely because it was very
clear where there was room for them
to slip in.
"It does create more anxiety to
come to school not knowing where
you're going to live," she said, "but to
some extent you can do better with a
numbci at the beginning ol the walk
in draw because you can really see
what's there."
Branslicld told a stor\ about a stu
dent who received the worst possible
spiing draw number, 3,000, who
nonetheless ended up getting into his
first choice house as a walk-in.
Still, she said. "Housing for the
last couple of years has been very
tight."
Last year, in part to deal with the
housing crunch caused bv the high
matriculation rate of this year's fresh
men, Housing Assignment Services
moved from July to April the dead
line for students to affirm they will ac
cept any assignment.
Because this affirmation is neces
sary for an undergraduate to receive
guaranteed housing, the move al-
lowed Housing Assignment Services
to see "the true demand" for housing,
Bransfield said.
