### Andrew Curry 
Recently returned from her third
trip to space, Dr. Ellen Ochoa, a Stan
ford alumna, ( lass of '81, and Board
of Trustees member, spoke about her
experiences as an astronaut to a
packed El Centro C hieano last night.
Ochoa, who returned from her
third space shuttle flight in June, is
the first Latina astronaut and a
NASA veteran, having started there
in IWI. El Centro named her to its
hall of fame last year, but last night
was the first chance she had to accept
her award.
I ler speech focused on her most
recent space shuttle flight, from May
27 to June 6, during which she served
as flight engineer and coordinated
many of the mission's goals. I ler pre
vious flights dealt mainly with scien
tific experiments, but this summer's
voyage was a change of pace.
" I he latest llight was different
we were gearing up for the Interna
tional Space Station," Ochoa said.
"We took up 4,(MK) pounds of sup
plies and spent several days transfer
ling them to the station [modules] so
they'd be ready for the first crew to
arrive at the station."
I he presentation, held in El Cen
tro and attended by about SO Stan
ford students, staff and even an inter
ested group of high school students
from San Jose, was accompanied by a
slide presentation illustrating the dif
ficulties and wonders of working in
space. Ochoa. who received a Ph.D.
in electrical engineering from Stan
ford in l l )S5. performed many of the
complex technical tasks needed to
make the transfer go well.
One of the most important was
operating a 50-foot robot arm that
moved fellow Stanford alumna
Tamara Jcrnigan. Class of 'SI who
has logged more hours on the space
shuttle than anyone else on earth
around the space-station in progress
during one of the mission's space
walks.
Audience members were im
pressed by Ochoa's achievements.

"It's good to know about the
progress of the space station first
hand, from an astronaut." said
sophomore Antonio Mora. "I think
she's a real inspiration. I'm real proud
of her, and this community's real
proud of her. She's a I .atina and came
from Stanford. That shows the doors
are open, that you can come out of
here and do something great."
I I ( entro officials have been wait
ing a while for this event. They
named her to their hall of fame last
year, but she couldn't accept the
award in person because she was in
Russia negotiating the future of the
space station. F.I Centro Director
fiances Morales presented her with

flowers and a plaque after her speech
last night.
"We wanted to celebrate her ac
complishments as a community. A
lot of people didn't even realize we
had a Latina astronaut, and we want
ed the whole community to get to
know her." Morales said.
After her speech. Ochoa encour
aged others to work toward their
goals.
"I laving a Stanford education was
important â€” not just the education
hut the experiences I had as a stu
dent." she said. "I lopefully, knowing
other Latinas have gone on and had
exciting careers will help keep some
people going."
