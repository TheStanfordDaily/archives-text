# LGBCC reaches out to freshmen

Gay and lesbian freshmen look
ing for an opportunity to diseuss is
sues ranging from coming out to a
roommate to race and religion with
their peers are in luck.
The Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center is sponsoring
for the first time this year a discus
sion group for gay, lesbian and bi
sexual freshmen, titled Equality at
the Farm: A Discussion on Sexuali
ty at Stanford.
"1 remember coming out to my
roommate and having no one else
to compare my experience with,"
said sophomore Alvaro Arce. a
staff member at the center.
Arce organized the group be
cause he said he noticed the need
for it when he found no opportuni
ties to meet solely with other gay
and lesbian freshmen.
Ming Wong, a freshman who
participated in the forum's first
meeting last Tuesday, was pleased
to have found such a group to meet
his needs so precisely.
"We're still adapting," Wong
said. "It's providing a social support
system.
"It's less intimidating to be
around other freshmen."
The first session last week went
well, according to Arce. Eleven
freshmen attended, and the discus
sion had a life of its own, he said.

"I was initially concerned with
how well it would go," he said, "but
though I originally thought it would
last an hour, it ended up going for
two. They just took the ball and ran
with it."
The group serves an ever-grow
ing population of freshmen who are
openly gay from the beginning of
their time at Stanford.
"Increasingly in recent years,
we're seeing more students coming
to Stanford who identify them
selves as lesbian or gay as opposed
to questioning," said Benjamin
Davidson, assistant dean of stu
dents and director of the LGBCC.
"This group of freshmen [in the dis
cussion group] is particularly dy
namic and sophisticated."
The center hosts programs for
students of all classes, including a
"coming out" discussion group.
This year, the LGBCC is initiating
programs with other organizations,
including all the ethnic organiza
tions, the Disability Resource Cen
ter and particularly the Women's
Center.
In working with the Women's
Center, Arce hopes to involve more
women in the LGBCC.

the Farm, which meets every Tues
day night at 9 p.m. in the LGBCC,
