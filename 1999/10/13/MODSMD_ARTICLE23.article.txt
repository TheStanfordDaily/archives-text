## West Nile virus on the rise 
### Susanna Fryer Contributing writer 
Chalk one up for the bugs. This
back to school season, those who live
in the New York area have more to
worry about than traffic jams and
crowded malls. An outbreak of
mosquito-borne encephalitis, which
began in New York City in late
August, continues to threaten the
residents of New York. New Jersey
and Connecticut.
So far several dozen cases of
encephalitis have been reported, all
of which are believed to have been
caused bv the West Nile-like virus.
Five of these cases have been fatal.
The virus is part of a family of dis
eases, including malaria, Lyme dis
ease and yellow fever. According to
the Center for Disease Control, this
viral group is responsible for more
deaths in the last 3(X) years than all
other causes of death combined.
Encephalitis is essentially an
inflammation of the brain usually
caused by a bacterial or viral infec
tion. The particular strain of virus
causing encephalitis in the New York
area has been termed '"West Nile
like" due to its genetic similarity to a
flavivirus commonly found in Africa,
Eastern Europe. West Asia and the
Middle East. The New York virus is
possibly a subtype of the West Nile

virus.
I he actual West Nile virus has
never been documented in the West
ern hemisphere. Exactly how long
the new virus has been in the U.S.
and where it may have come from
remain unknown to public health
officials, who are working hard to
contain the outbreak. Officials at the
CDC believe that the virus could
have arrived through imported
infected birds, air cargo or an infect
ed person.
The transmission cycle of the
virus begins when a mosquito feeds
on a bird that is infected with the
virus. The mosquito then becomes
infected and can transmit the virus to
humans and animals through a bite;
the incubation period from mosquito
to human is usually between five and
15 days. There is no evidence that a
human can contract the virus direct
ly from a bird, nor can humans trans
mit the virus to each other.
The severity of encephalitis
caused by the virus ranges in intensi
ty. Most infections are mild, resulting
in fever, aches, skin rashes and
swollen lymph nodes. More severe
infections can occur, causing high
fevers, neck stiffness, stupor,
tremors, paralysis and in rare cases,
death. The mortality rate of West
Nile encephalitis ranges from three
percent to 15 percent, with elderly

people having a higher risk of death
than the rest of the population.
There are no specific therapies yet
developed to combat the virus.
For the average person the likeli
hood of contracting the disease is
minimal. According to Tom Skinner,
a spokesman for the CDC, "a very
small proportion of those who get
bitten by mosquitoes will actually
become ill. with the majority of those
who become infected with the virus
experiencing mild, flu-like symp
toms."
While there is no vaccine to
reduce the risk of West Nile
encephalitis, there are several pre
cautionary measures that residents
living in infected areas can take.
These measures include staying in
at dusk and dawn, when mosquitoes
are feeding. Or if you must venture
out. health officials suggest wearing
long shirts and pants and spraying
any exposed skin with insect repel
lent.
The outbreak of this disease has
been significantly curtailed by the
efforts of local and federal public
health officials working in tandem
with the CDC. By controlling the
mosquito population and through
public education programs the risk
of infection has diminished. Skinner
explained that, "the CDC will con
tinue to monitor populations in the

spring to learn where the infected
insects may be circulating."
Until fall's first frost, when
mosquito season ends, infection is
still a possiblity for New York area

residents. 1 lopefully, surveillance of
infected mosquitoes and bird flocks
over the next year will prevent a
perennial outbreak of the West Nile
like virus. At the very least, surveil

lance of these populations will allow
state and local officials to bolster
their ability to detect the virus at an
earlier stage in its transmission cycle,
before it reaches humans.
