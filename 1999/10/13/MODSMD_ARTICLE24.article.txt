# Better genes for a better living
## 
### Monya De Contributing writer 
This summer, science's front
page news was a strain of geneti
cally altered mice proven in
memory tests to be smarter than
their home-grown counterparts.
The breakthrough spawned
immediate worry, and a host of
biomedical ethics editorials that
focused on the possibility of the
findings being used to justify
improved human beings, as well.
But amidst the brouhaha, a pair
of hands could be heard applaud
ing at the Hoover Institution.
Dr. Henry Miller, a Hoover
fellow writing on biotechnology
policy, would like to see the pop
ular attitude toward accomplish
ments in genetic technology
change. In a recent interview, he
stated that "most of what we see
written [about genetic technolo
gy] comes from those who
haven't thought about (the sci
ence] very long."
Miller calls this the "Chicken
Little" approach to science,
chastising those who prematurely
burden genetics with moral impli
cations.
Miller's professional life is a
testament to this belief. As the
first genetic engineering expert at
the Food and Drug Administra
tion. his employer for 15 years, lie
was instrumental,in the speedy
approval of two now-Ã¼biquitous
recombinant hormones. Insulin
and human growth hormone
have greatly increased the quality
of life for countless Americans.
The FDA's policy, says Miller,
is to treat genetic technology no
differently from a new drug. This
is in direct contrast to federal
agencies such as the Department
of Agriculture and Environmen
tal Protection Agency, which
applv special restrictions and red
tape to it.
However, the FDA's approval
process is "burdensome and
expensive." meaning that break
throughs by small companies can
not easily reach the mass market,
slowing the pace of medical
application of technology.
After receiving a master's and
M.D. degrees from the Universi
ty of California San Diego. Miller
completed his training at Har

vard and headed for the National
Institutes of Health, set on a
career in medical research.
Finding that he did not care
for the administrative hassles of
large laboratories, he signed on
with the FDA. After serving in
several positions, including Spe
cial Assistant to the FDA Com
missioner. he became involved in
the policy aspects of the agency,
writing about regulatory policy in
science and technology.
Miller left the FDA for the
Hoover Institution in 1993, the
start of the Clinton Administra
tion.
Miller stressed the importance
of giving credit to recombinant
DNA technology. "If a child with
normal parents is only going to
grow to three feet tall without
therapy," he stated, "intervention
is warranted."
While he claims to be as
uncertain as anyone else as to the
definition of necessity in medical
treatment and the limits of
acceptable enhancement, he does
not reject the idea of that
enhancement, as some groups do.
Discussion of the genetic
advances in an ethical frame
work. Miller said, is more appro
priate when the procedure of
interest is germ-line gene thera
py-
Introducing new DNA before
a cell has differentiated means in
theory that the DNA can be
propagated through the individu
al's descendants. The implica
tions of advantaged populations,
whether in health or in memory
capacity, gives the researcher
more pause.
Yet. he says, in some future
instances, it will be irresponsible
not to do germ-line gene therapy.
For example, gene therapy could
allow two individuals recessive
for sickle-cell anemia trait to
thwart destiny and have a healthy
child.
For now. though, testing gene
therapy on humans will mainly be
limited to medically necessary
therapy, such as the insertion of a
healthy gene in a cystic fibrosis
patient. The recipients of these
treatments will typically be those
who have exhausted other
options and are ready to try a
new approach.
