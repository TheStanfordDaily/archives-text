# Glowing mice boon for drug testing

Mice that glow when affected
with active cancer cells may help
researchers pinpoint effective anti
cancer drugs.
Stanford scientists Christopher
Contag, associate professor of pedi
atries. and Robert Negrin, associate
professor of medicine, have devel
oped a technique using a firefly
gene where mice light up when their
cancer cells are multiplying and dim
when the cancerous cells are
reduced hv drugs.
The researchers inserted the fire
fly gene into human tumor cells.
When the tumor cells are healthy
and multiplying, the firefly gene is
active and glows.
Contag and Negrin then injected
these modified tumor cells into
mice. Using an ultra-sensitive video
camera, they can detect the glow
from the firefly gene through the
skin and tissue of the injected mice
as colored blotches.
The researchers tracked the
growth of the tumor cells in the
mice over time. What they found
was that as the tumor spread to cer
tain areas of the body, those areas
glowed more intensely. For exam
ple. when the tumor spread to the
mouse's abdomen, the light emitted

from the abdomen became more
intense and spread over a larger
area, allowing the researchers to see
the tumor growing before their
eyes.
Within days of treating the
mouse to a chemotherapeutic drug,
the glowing dimmed and receded,
indicating a reduction of cancer
cells.
Two months after the glowing
had disappeared, testing by an alter
native method proved that all
remaining cancer cells had been
killed by the drug and the mouse
was free from cancer.
Contag and Negrin believe that
the new technique will be useful for
testing drugs to treat minimal dis
ease —the small number of cancer
cells found early in disease or fol
lowing removal of a large tumor.
Better diagnostic methods have
allowed detection of minimal dis
ease at an early stage, meaning new
drugs that can rapidly kill cancerous
cells have a better chance of fighting
the disease.
The new technique provides a
fast and easy way of testing for the
efficacy of new anti-cancer drugs.
So far, Contag and Negrin have
tested three standards chemothera
py drugs against human cervical
tumor cells. All three tests show
that their new method is a reliable

predictor of the drug's effective
ness.
Besides allowing for faster drug
testing, the new method will also
reduce the number of mice sacri
ficed during medical research. Nei
ther the firefly gene nor the ultra
sensitive camera harms the mouse.
Since the firefly gene allows
researchers to see the cancer cells
through the animal's body, there is
also no need to kill the mouse and
dissect it to ascertain what is hap
pening within its tissues.
"There is no other method that
can detect so few human cells non
invasivelv," said Negrin.
The glowing mouse was first
developed hv Contag and col
leagues in 1995 to track the progres
sion of infectious diseases. They
injected the bacteria Salmonella
labeled with the firefly gene into
mice to see where the Salmonella
bacteria settled in the mouse's gut
and how the bacteria responded to
various antibiotics.
That method has since been
licensed to a biotechnology compa
ny. Xenogen. started by Contag and
his colleagues.
The new technique will help sci
entists develop more non-toxic
drugs that kill relatively small num
bers of cancer cells before they
grow into life-threatening tumors.

According to Contag, drugs used to
treat late-stage disease are usually
very toxic and can cause many
unpleasant side-effects such as nau
sea and loss of body hair. Coupled
with earlier detection methods, the
non-toxic drugs will significantly
improve the chances of survival
against cancer.
Besides testing new pharmaceu
ticals. the researchers are also using
the firefly gene to assess a new anti
cancer therapy developed by
Negrin.
The new therapy collects
immune system cells called
cytokine-induced killer (CIK) T
cells from humans or mice and
primes them against tumor cells in
the laboratory. These CIK cells are
then returned to the body, where
they embark on a search-and
destroy mission against tumor cells.
So far. the CIK therapy has suc
cessfully removed cancer cells in
mice and is now being tested, using
human CIK cells, in a clinical trial
for lymphoma patients.
Negrin, who is also the associate
director of Stanford's Division of
Bone Marrow Transplantation,
hopes that the CIK therapy will
help in destroying cancerous cells,
such as malignant cells lingering
after a bone marrow transplant pro
cedure.
