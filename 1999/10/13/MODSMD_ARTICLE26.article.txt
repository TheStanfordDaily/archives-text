# Magma responsible for ground uplift
## 
### Bruce Wang Editorial staff 
The underground movement of molten rock
is lifting the floor of a volcanic valley in eastern
California, according to research that confirms
magma is behind more than 20 years of geolog
ic unrest in the area.
The study was reported by Stanford Geo
physics Professor Paul Segall and his colleagues.
It supports the theory that pressure from
magma and not hot water or gases caused the
two-foot high bulge in the Long Valley caldera.
Differentiating between magma intrusion and
thermal expansion of the hydrothernial system
is critical for accurate assessment of volcanic
hazards.
Located in the eastern Sierra Nevada, about
250 miles north of Los Angeles, the Long Valley
caldera is a collapsed structure that is the rem
nants of an ancient volcano that exploded
760.000 years ago. The explosion spewed ash all
the way to what is now Nebraska and created a
20-mile by 10-mile crater.
In the last S.(MK) years, there have been 20
smaller eruptions in the area, the most recent
about 250 years ago. The Mammoth Mountain

ski resort, which sits on the edge of the caldera,
is the nation's second-largest ski resort behind
Vail. Colorado.
Since 1978. the area lias been experiencing a
number of seismic and other geological activi
ties. including a swarm of smaller earthquakes
and several niagnitude-6 tremors. Scientists also
began noticing that a 100-square-mile section of
the ground was rising.
In 1982. the USGS issued a "notice of poten
tial volcanic hazard" to the Long Valley area in
response to the increased geological activities
and continues to monitor the area closely.
According to their study, uplifting in the
ground at shield volcanoes are usually associat
ed with magma accumulating in the shallow
crust. However, whether or not deformation at
calderas is caused by magma is less certain.
Scientists had proposed that the uplifting at
Long Viillev was due to perturbations to the
caldera's hydrothermal systems rather than
intrusion of magma. This study dispels that the
ory.
"The significance [of this study) is that there
has always been some uncertainty in whether
ground deformation has been due to magma
intrusion." Seuall said. "There are other wavs

you can imagine the ground bulging up [with
out! magma."
Some calderas, such as the one at Yellow
stone. produce an uplift without magma. Pres
sure from hydrothermal activity or gases cooling
molten rock are likely the causes in those cases.
Scientists studying the Long Valley area,
however, had little doubt that magma four to
seven miles beneath the surface was behind the
thousands of usually minor quakes in the area as
well as the lift over a six-mile diameter area.
In their study, conducted in July of 1998,
Segall and colleagues monitored minuscule
changes in the acceleration of gravity at 34 grav
ity stations on the raised portion of the crater
floor. They deduced that mass was added below
the surface and that the new substance was
molten rock.
According to David Mill, the United States
Geological Survey scientist in charge of the
Long Valley Caldcra Observatory, the study
"provides important information and tells us
whether or not mass has been transferred,
which is a crucial thing to know."
According to Segall. the new study doesn't
suggest that the sparsely populated area is at an
increased risk of eruption.
