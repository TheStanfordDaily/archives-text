## Field hockey loses narrow battle with visiting Davidson Despite close loss, Cardinal squad heads east with renewed enthusiasm 
### Ashley Rich Contributing writer 
After two weeks ol relaxed competition against
California club-level teams. Monday's 2-1 loss to
Davidson (8-5) proved to be a wake-up call lor the
women's field hockey team (4-6,3-0 Northern Pacific
Conference).
I he game looked promising when it opened up
with a quick goal by Stanford as freshman forward
Dalinda Banuclos's shot skipped past a defender's
stick only 98 seconds into the game.

But the Davidson Wildcats didn't let down and
came hack to score on a penalty corner 10 minutes
later.
Penalty corners for Stanford weren't as successful.
Although given the opportunity several times, the
Cardinal's hesitation on several corner options al
lowed the Davidson defense to get to the ball at the
top of the scoring circle before anyone could get a
shot off.
Requiring accuracy and communication, the
missed penalty corners were perhaps an indication
that things weren't clicking for the Cardinal.
"It's not like we didn't practice them this week, we
just couldn't get them in." said senior co-captain
Sarah Medeiros.
After Davidson tied the game. Stanford still man
aged to dominate for the remainder of the first half
and out-shot the Wildcats 20-7.
But an unlucky breakaway brought the ball past
the Cardinal defense and a quick shot slipped by
sophomore goalie Rebecca Shapiro with five minutes
left in the first half.
After halftime. Stanford came out to dominate
again.
The driving midfield line of Medeiros. senior Mal
lory Cambers and junior Michelle Scott rarely al
lowed the ball to fall back into the Cardinal defensive
end. and when it did. senior halfback Julie Gwozdz,
was able to efficiently get them out of trouble.
The Wildcats were unable to pull off a shot during
the entire second half, but it wasn't enough to save the
game when several close attempts on Davidson's goal
were unable to find their way in.
"We would get down the field and get close, but
things just weren't clicking for us today," said
Medeiros. "We were just never able to hit the right
opportunity at the right time."
The missed opportunities were perhaps the result
of a two week vacation as the Cardinal breezed past
UC- Santa Barbara and Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo in
the last two weeks.
When it came to a late afternoon close match
against an unfamiliar team, the Cardinal had trouble
getting it together to find the communication re
quired to get the ball in the goal.

"It was really frustrating. Wc came close several
times, but weren't working together to get things in"
said Gwozdz.
The Wildcats, who visited the west coast for a week
of competition against area teams, were clearly
pumped up for this last game of their trip.
Despite Stanford's ability to keep the ball on the
other side of the field. Davidson never let down and

remained one step ahead to the ball.
Although Stanford now slips to 4-6 for the season,
one positive aspect of the loss can be found in the
team's frustration and eagerness to redeem itself as it
heads east for four games in Philadelphia.
"Today didn't hurt our confidence," said
Medeiros. "It's just a reminder of what we need to do
in order to win. If anything, we're fired up to play

those teams later this week"
Hopefully, that frustration will provide enough en
ergy to last through the week when Thursday begins
an exhausting Eastern road trip of four games in four
days.
Back-to-back competition with so little recovery
time will put the young team's depth and concentra
tion to the test.
