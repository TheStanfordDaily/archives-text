## High-tech firm seeks new QB

Ben Jones

The endless rows of tables. The fuzzy smily
face yellow keychains. The techie majors all show
ered and snazzed up. printing out endless copies
of their resumes.
It could mean only one thing — it was that time
of year again, time for the career fair. The out
stretched hand of corporate America descended
on the Farm yesterday, taking over White Plaza
like the Jacksonville offensive line at an all-you
can-eat buffet.
Walking down the endless rows of dot-coms
and straietic technology management consultants
amidst the free pens, T-shirts and frisbees, I
couldn't help but wonder why there's no alterna
tive in the world of sports. If an environmental
NGOcan find a hum-bio major looking to do con
sulting work on rainforest preservation projects in
southe: tern Madagascar, why shouldn't football
teams' allowed to search for a guy who runs the
40 in I ur-three and isn't afraid to go across the
middk n the same fashion.
You never know, it might just change the way
things work.
In 1%7 St. Louis Cardinal's outfielder Curt
Flood won a landmark lawsuit that began the era
of free-agency in professional sports. Flayers
whose mtracts ended were now free to offer
their si ices to the highest bidder on the open
market ither than resigning with their current
teams.; was tradition.
Tod; free-agencv is pervasive throughout the
four ma sports and is taking root as far away as
NASC'A racing. The effects on the world of
sports h. been far-reaching
In the a of free-agency, much of the player
team lo\ which defined previous eras of sport
has erod 1 the face of the almighty dollar.
Rather tl being rare for players to jump from
team tot luring their careers, it is now almost

unheard of for players to remain with the same
team over long careers.
Players sucah as Tony Gwynn and Karl Mal
one. who choose to stay with the same club their
entire career, have become the exception rather
than the rule.
Can anyone imagine Lou Gehrig trading in his
Yankee pinstripes for Detroit Tigers navy and or
ange just for a few more dollars a year? Maybe the
same people who could never imagine Roger
Clemens in anything but Red Sox colors.
Wayne Gretzkv as a King? A .Blue? A
Ranger? Joe Montana a Chief? Michael Jordan in
Charlotte I lornets teal? Thank goodness that one
was only speculation.
The ever-shifting teams and lineups makes it
difficult for fans to ally not only with teams but
with the great individuals who make sports what
they are.
Teams are forced to sign only mediocre players
for exorbitant salaries just to prevent them from
shuffling off to another team who can pay them
more. Can anyone say Joe Mcllvaine?
Another pernicious by-product of the free
agent market is the increasing polarization be
tween large-market and small-market teams. It is
often only those major-market teams with high
capital reserves who can afford to match the sky
rocketing salaries of top-notch free agents.
This divide has led many to speculate about the
inability of small market teams to compete with
the major markets on an equal playing field and
even engendered speculations of creating sepa
rate leagues for different-sized market teams.
Such a move would strike at the foundation of
sports founded not only on the Los Angelesesand
New Yorks but also the Utahs. the San Diegos
and the Portlands.
'This problem needs a solution. Mere's a wild

idea. The sports career fair. The event could be
held in one of the nation's premiere sporting
venues — Madison Square Garden, perhaps.
All of the free agents and unsigned rookies
would come, resumes and workout statistics in
hand, and the teams would set up booths, search
ing for the players they need.
Like any career fair this one would have to
have lots of freebies to give away, but, come on,
it's professional sports teams. They're all about
gear.
You can just see the sales pitches now.
The Browns: "Recently formed startup seaks
experienced veterans and talented newcomers to
industry."
The Bulls: "Venerable corporation seeks CEO
to replace departed former chief excecutive.
Clutch fall-away jumper a plus. Full Benefits."
The Indians: "Talented organization seeks de
pendable pitcher and/or closer to prevent recur
ring fourth-quarter earnings drop."
The Clippers: "We'll take anyone. Anyone.
We're the Clippers for the love of God. I ley. kid,
you got game?"
Think negotiation with an elite agent is tough?
Try a General Manager holding a stuffed Ten
nessee Titans mascot trying to negotiate a salary
extension.
Who knows, chances are it'd never work, but
anything would be better than the current dog
eat-dog. high stakes world of free agency.
If fuzziescan get jobs with startups, you'd think
the Broncos could find someone to replace
Elwav.

lien Jones is a junior majoring in International Re
lations. He went now here near the career fair this
afternoon, hut rumor has it the Clippers offered
him a trxout.
