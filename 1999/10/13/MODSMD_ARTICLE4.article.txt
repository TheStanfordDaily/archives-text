After a decade of renovation
following the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake, the formal dedica
tion of the Bine Wing took place
Tuesday on the front steps of the
newlv reconstructed building.
The wing, which has been open
since August, was formerly
known as Green Library West. It
was dedicated to Peter and I Iclen
Bing for their generous donations
of time and money to Stanford
over the years.
In a fusion of the electronic
and print worlds, the Bing Wing
has been constructed not only to
serve the original purpose of a li
brary but to provide its users with
access to the Internet and Stan
ford's collection of electronic
texts and publications.
In his speech at the ceremony.

University President Gerhard
Casper questioned whether, given
the "dizzying speed" at which
"the electronic medium" has ex
panded. libraries would retain
their status as necessary institu
tions.
But he concluded. "Even the
most futuristic of thinkers would
have to admit that we are likely to
have physical libraries and paper
books for decades to come. We
are far from the point where
everything we need is on the
Web."
"You will be much relieved to
learn that we do, indeed, need the
Bing Wing." he said.
Other speakers recounted sto
ries of their time in the old library
and lauded the new facility.
Michael Kellar. University li
brarian. praised the merits of a li
brary as "a physical and virtual
space" to "confront sources of all
media from all periods."
