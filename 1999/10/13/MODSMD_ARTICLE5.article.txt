# Land Use discussed
## Palo Alto council a tough audience 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
Over 100 people attended a spe
cial joint meeting with the Santa
Clara County Planning Commis
sion and the Palo Alto City Coun
cil. designed as a forum for public
comment on Stanford's draft plan,
submitted to the Planning Com
mission on Sept. 20.
The plan is intended to govern
Stanford's land use for at least the
next 10 years, and contains provi
sions for additional housing, acad
emic facilities, open space and con
servation and transportation.
While questions of open space
and overcrowding in schools were
raised by many in attendance last
night, academic resources and fa
cilities emerged as the key issue.
The new General Use Permit pro
vides for 1.7 million square feet of
academic and support facilities, with
an additional 332,(XX) square feet for
new athletic and cultural facilities.
Stanford faculty members ex
pressed concerns that without per
mission for additional facilities,
Stanford would have difficulty
maintaining its place as a cutting
edge research university. Many
mentioned the deteriorating Stan

ford hospital.
"We are beginning not to be able
to attract the students," Medical
School Prof. Helen Blau, chair of
molecular pharmacology, told the
crowd.
According to Asst. Molecular
Pharmacology Prof. Garry Nolan,
additional facilities are crucial. "It's
space for people's ideas, space for
innovation, space to bring in some
of the best and brightest grad stu
dents."
Many community members ex
pressed a desire for Stanford to
make its overall plans more explicit.

On the issue of open space, the plan
states that more than 99 percent of
the undeveloped Stanford land in
Santa Clara county south of Ju
nipero Serra Boulevard, including
the Dish area, will remain undevel
oped for at least the next 10 years.
"We really have to make sure
things are written in stone," said
Peter Dreckmeyer of the Stanford
Open Space Alliance.
The undeveloped area is classi
fied as "academic reserve" on the
draft plan's map of future land use.
Edie Keating, a local resident, stat
ed that there is "zero" open space

protected in the foothills. "It's all
one great hig blob of "academic re
serve.' "
"The plan needs to concentrate
on where Stanford is going not for
the next five years, not for the next
10 years, but ultimately." said Palo
Alto City Manager Hd Goff.
According to Larry Horton,
Stanford's Director of Community
and Government Relations, the
University's plan requires a certain
degree of flexibility because the fu
ture is difficult to anticipate. "Ten
years ago, the words 'dot-com' did
not exist." said I lorton.

Another key issue, housing, was
of particular concern to the gradu
ate students at the meeting last
night. The plan provides new hous
ing for up to 2,(XX) single students.
"We're at a very critical juncture
for the University," said graduate
student Chris Stromberg, a member
of the Graduate Student Council.
"II this plan fails, nothing is going to
get built."
Goff asked that special attention
be paid to the possibility of building
a new middle school. I iorton point
ed out the unique relationship be
tween Stanford and area public

schools, noting that five schools are
situated on Stanford land.
Stanford's choice to hold a public
forum on a draft plan was unique,
according to. Sarah Jones of the
Santa Clara County Planning Of
fice. because such forums are typi
cally held only upon completion of a
final draft. " This is a very unusual
time for public review of a project."
she said.
According to Morton, no other
university in California has a com
munity plan resembling Stanford's.
"It's a learning process for all of us."
he added.
