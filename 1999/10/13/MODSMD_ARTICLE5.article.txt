## Palo Alto council a tough audience 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
Over 100 people attended a spe
cial joint meeting with the Santa
Clara County Planning Commis
sion and the Palo Alto City Coun
cil. designed as a forum for public
comment on Stanford's draft plan,
submitted to the Planning Com
mission on Sept. 20.
The plan is intended to govern
Stanford's land use for at least the
next 10 years, and contains provi
sions for additional housing, acad
emic facilities, open space and con
servation and transportation.
While questions of open space
and overcrowding in schools were
raised by many in attendance last
night, academic resources and fa
cilities emerged as the key issue.
