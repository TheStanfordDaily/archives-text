# Menlo citizens warm to draft
## 
### Virginia Yang Contributing writer 
Last night, the Menlo Park City
Council and Community Develop
ment Agency considered the Draft
Community Plan and General Use
Permit that would govern future de
velopment and activities on the por
tion of Stanford lands located in un
incorporated Santa Clara County.
Recently, this subject has been ;i
hot topic of debate for residents of
surrounding cities and within the
Stanford community.
The meeting started out with a
staff report on the land use plan, in
which the staff pronounced the plan
to be too general in nature.
Next. Andy Coe. Stanford direc
tor of community relations, and
Charles Carter. Stanford assistant
director of planning, presented the
draft plan. Coe said he "rccogni/ed
that more work is needed on the
plan." but said that will come with
the second draft of the plan, sched
uled to be released on Nov. 15.
Then, the board opened up for
public comment. Residents present
at the meeting, most of whom came
from Menlo Park, were largely in
support of Stan lord 's Land Use Plan,
acknowledging Stanford's need for
flexibility in planning for an uncer
tain future and their confidence in
Stanford's policies, judging from the
University's history.
Most agreed with resident Don
Sweet when he said that "it is unrea
sonable to make Stanford University
permanently promise to leave open

space."
John Hunter Tart, a member of
the Ciraduate Student Council, rep
resented the interests of graduate
students. He wanted to "emphasize
the importance and timeliness of the
proposal."
"I would like to see the towns
work together to get plans approved
on time before Stanford loses its lus
ter to the. brightest minds," Tart said.
Tart was the only Stanford stu
dent there who voiced his opinions
regarding the plan. Reginald Rice, a
retired financial consultant from
Menlo Park, commented, "I'd like to
see more [students] come out to help
support [Coe]. This is a very impor

tant time and politicians respond to
people who are there in person."
Of the eight residents that came
out to speak on the Land Use Plan,
only one spoke against the plan,
while the rest were largely in support
of Stanford.
The council members, on the
other hand, were not as supportive of
the plan.
Council member Steve Schmidt
cited the "reluctance of the Universi
ty to make any commitment" in
terms of open space and said he is
"not clear why the trustees are so re
luctant to extend a commitment be
yond 10 years."
Schmidt also said that he has been

"frustrated for a number of years
with Menlo Park's relationship with
Stanford University."
Fellow Council member Chuck
Kinney cited the lack of land zoning
specificity.
Menlo Park Mayor Paul Collac
chi called the 10-year cycles of the
land use permits an "all-you-can-eat
developers' license," and empha
sized the difference between public
benefit and private benefit. He said
that "the county's job is to play for
team public, not to look out for the
interests of a private institution such
as Stanford."
Collacchi said that "the public
stated clearly what the public bene

fits are open space, appropriate
housing and road systems. This is a
real opportunity for the county to get
public benefits by demanding these
public benefits in exchange for pri
vate growth."
I le said, 'instead of just endlessly
swallowing until we can't take it any
more. it's better if we just limited it
ourselves." commenting on Stan
ford's cyclical requests lor develop
ment rights.
Council member Mary Jo Borak
wanted the members to examine not
just the form of the proposal but.
more importantly, the substance.
She said. "Stanford should com
mit to open space in the same time

frame as the buildings in the per
mit."
Borak said she believes that land
south of Junipero Serra should be
preserved, and that "land use should
be unique to that part of the world,"
citing examples such as the Dish and
the reservoir as appropriate uses of
the land there.
In terms of housing, Borak said
that "everybody is so enamored with
the idea of housing that they don't
speak in terms of square footage"
and urged everyone to look at the
real impact of the proposed develop
ment. which adds up to nearly 4.5
million square feet of development
