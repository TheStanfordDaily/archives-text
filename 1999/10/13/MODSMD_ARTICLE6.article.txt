### Virginia Yang Contributing writer 
Last night, the Menlo Park City
Council and Community Develop
ment Agency considered the Draft
Community Plan and General Use
Permit that would govern future de
velopment and activities on the por
tion of Stanford lands located in un
incorporated Santa Clara County.
Recently, this subject has been ;i
hot topic of debate for residents of
surrounding cities and within the
Stanford community.
The meeting started out with a
staff report on the land use plan, in
which the staff pronounced the plan
to be too general in nature.
Next. Andy Coe. Stanford direc
tor of community relations, and
Charles Carter. Stanford assistant
director of planning, presented the
draft plan. Coe said he "rccogni/ed
that more work is needed on the
plan." but said that will come with
the second draft of the plan, sched
uled to be released on Nov. 15.
