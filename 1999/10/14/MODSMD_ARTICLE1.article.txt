# Some in "Sixth Man" sense unfairness
## Mixed reviews for hoops plan 
### Anuj Gupta Editorial staff 
On the day he announced a re
vamped ticketing system for Stan
ford men's basketball games, Men's
Basketball Marketing Coordinator
John Hopkins' inbox was Hooded
with over 30 e-mails from students.
Much to his delight. Hopkins
said, "I have not had a single person
that has said the new system is the
wrong way to go."
However, not all students are re
acting to the plan with such enthusi
asm; some have said they feel the
system is unfair to students, while
others expressed their belief that it
will only increase the frequency of
long lines outside Maples Pavilion.

Reviewing the plans
The plan, devised by two Stan

ford seniors and two recent gradu
ates, offers all students the opportu
nity to sign up for either upper-deck
season-ticket membership or floor
level Sixth Man Club membership
from Oct. 18 to 21.
Member students will be given
electronic swipe cards but will not be
guaranteed admission into any
game. For all but three of the games,
only the first 1,2(X) students with
cards will be admitted to Maples.
However, students can not begin
lining up for admission to any game
before 6 a.m. on game day.
This rule is in response to the
University administration's displea
sure with the extended camp-outs
which preceded the initial sales of
season and Sixth Man tickets in pre
vious years that sometimes lasted
several nights.
For the three so-called premium
games this year — against UCLA.

Arizona, and California — only the
600 to I,(XX) students who have accu
mulated the most "points" by going
to non-premium games will be able
to get in.
The points system is an attempt
to reward the most dedicated fans
and increase attendance at early
season games, which normally draw
fewer students.
Points system calls winter break
games into question
Many initial student complaints
surrounded the perceived unfair
ness of the points system.
Several basketball games tall
during the winter break period,
when all University residences are
closed.
"One major flaw in the system is
that vcrv few people are going to be
here over winter break." s;iid sopho
more Dan Sehaefer, who was a Sixth
Man member last year.
I his could potentially help stu
dents who live in the Bay Area earn
more points by coming to games
during the break.
I lopkins downplayed the signifi
cance of the winter break games in
the points system.
"112 ive games out of the eight be
fore the first premium game [Ari

zona! are not before winter break,
but from years past, not many stu
dents come to [the winter break]
games," I lopkins said.
"If we have more than 1(H) stu
dents. I'll be shocked ... if we have
50 or KM) people that get ahead on
points it won't change the field." he
added.
Discouraging camp-outs
The online sign ups and rule pro
hibiting lining up before 6 a.m. on
game days has been greeted with ap
proval bv University administration.
"I'm supportive of any plan

whieh minimizes students having to
camp out, the concern being that
[camping out] would distract from
students focusing on their academic
course of study," said Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais.
Much of the University's opposi
tion to the camp-outs stems from the
debacle surrounding last year's tick
et distribution.
Last October, a line that would
eventually grow as large as 1.600 stu
dents began forming two weeks be
fore tickets were to go on sale. I low
ever. the Athletics Department dis
missed the crowds after eight days
and a lottery system was implement

ed instead.
Sophomore Erika Soto said this
year's system represents a marked
improvement.
"It's got to be better than last
year. Last year was a big mess be
cause they made us all camp out and
it was all for nothing in the end," she
said.
Sophomore Stan Smith dis
agreed. pointing out that this system
could in fact increase the number of
lines outside Maples.
"I think [the plan] is pretty miser
able. ... I don't so much like that you
have to line up every time just so the
first 1,200 people can get in. That will

just create more lines," Smith said.
'Open to anybody around the
world'
According to Hopkins, a major
improvement of the new system is
that the online sign-ups have no limit
on membership numbers.
"I think the Internet is open to
anybody around the world. Students
overseas, med students ... clearly
these people want to go see games,
and they should have the opportuni
ty." I lopkins said.
"It shouldn't be predicated on
them giving up so much of their valu

able time to stand out in line."
Hopkins pointed out that last
year's initial system unfairly favored
freshman dorms and Greek groups,
who were able to field large parties
to reserve spots in line, calling the
new plan "definitely much fairer."
Sehaefer, however, whose fresh
man dorm Cedro last year had been
second in line at Maples, said he was
"extremely disappointed" with the
elimination of the camp-outs.
"It takes a little bit away from the
prestige and the honor of being in
Sixth Man since it's open to every
one ... and not just the diehards
who camp out."
