The new proposal
isn't necessarily good
for the fans

This week, the Stanford Athletics
Department and Justarrive, Inc.
of San Francisco announced a
revamped ticketing system for the Sixth
Man Club, the student fan section for
men's basketball games.
Last year, people had to camp out in
front of Maples Pavilion for up to two
weeks in order to lay down their $55 for a
Sixth Man shirt and season ticket. With
the Justarrive system, students will join
the Sixth Man Club via the Web. and by
attending early games they will earn
"Fanaddict" points toward guaranteed
admission to the most popular regular
season games.
The advantage of the new system is
plain to see: we no longer have to ask our
selves, "Who gets to be in the Sixth Man
Club?" With an unlimited number of
memberships, there will be no more two
week lines and no more complaints about
mass dorm organization. All the fans
should be happy, right?
Wrong. The new thing that we must
ask ourselves is, "Who are the most die
hard people in the Sixth Man ( lub?" And
| as usual with the Sixth Man Club, fairness
I of policy comes into question.
The new measure of "die-hardness"
seems simple enough. I he 6(H) to 1.0(H)
people who attend the most games are
worthy of going to the Arizona, UCLA
and California games. The liist 1,2(H) peo
ple to show up to each individual game
are worthy of getting into Maples.
To see the flaws in (his system, first
consider the home basketball games that
take place during the month of Decem
ber. These games have understandably
low attendance from the Sixth Man Club
because they happen during winter
break, when the I Jniversity forces under
graduate students to leave their dorm
rooms. Consequently, the only people
who will earn "Fanaddict" points for the

Nevada, Sacramento State and Stanford
Invitational games will he those who
remain in the Bay Area. In effect, people
will be penalized for living somewhere
else.
On its Web site, Justarrive claims that
"most games will likely not attract more
than 1.2(H) fans." They might be horribly
underestimating the "die-hardness" of
Stanford students. Saying that the
Marathon Oil game won't fill up under
the new system is like saying that Lamb
da Nu wouldn't become more popular
after remodeling through the Capital
Improvement Program.
Instead of a two-week period of long
lines, worries over getting in and com
plaints about line-hopping and line-hold
ing. we potentially have lfi such day-long
crises. And restricting lines from forming
before (i a.m. might not stop the tents; a
few months ago, when Century Theatres
made a similar policy regarding "Star
Wars" tickets, people just camped across
the street.
Plus, this new system increases laziness
and apathy among Sixth Man (Tub mem
bers. There's a certain level of excitement
and camaraderie that takes place during
camp-outs. Web sign-tips, line restrictions
and electronic cards make part of that go
away.
And it's easy to imagine a few fans,
discouraged after being turned away from
a game or two, will give up on the whole
thing. They walk awav with a $25 Sixth
Man T-shirt â€” not such a great loss. Hut
in the grand scheme of things, it seems a
shame because the Athletics Department
and Justarrive stand to make this $25
from every student on campus. Who is
the real benefactor of this ticket plan?
You know, it's starting to look like the
only people who truly know how to test a
person's "die-hardness" are the folks in
the Stanford Hand. Look at what people
do during I'ree tryouts every year. Until
the day that we join the Sixth Man Club
by getting naked in front of a Human
Biology class or lighting ourselves on fire
in White Pla/a, there will probably never
be a system that we can really call "fair."
