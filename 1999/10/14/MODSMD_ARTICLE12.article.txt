Fahmy should have consid
ered all perspectives
Mr. Ilnssnm Fahmy's recent letter to
The Daily addresses some interesting
issues in the history of U.S. diplomacy,
hut, regrettably, oversimplifies many ol
them, 112 irst, the military leaders of Japan
did not simply "declare their intent to sin
render" in the months preceding the
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In
June 1943, Emperor llirohito asked the
military leaders at the head of his govern
ment to surrender to the Allies. I lowever.
General Tojo and Ins colleagues refused
to accept the inevitability of defeat or the
prospect of unconditional surrender;
rather than approaching the United
States, their principal opponent for the
duration of the war. the Japanese military
junta attempted to broker a conditional
peace through the Soviet Union, which
would have allowed them to retain con
trol of the Japanese state.
The Allies had insisted upon uncondi
tional surrender to prevent I ojo and his
fellow war hawks, who had started the
war in China and the Pacific, who had
committed many atrocities in the interest
of imperialism, from remaining in power.
When the United States and Britain
would not countenance any conditional
surrender, Tojo's government decided to
take their chances fighting. Even after
President Truman threatened "prompt
and utter destruction" should Japan per
sist with hostilities. Tojo remained entire
ly recalcitrant. While the decision to use
atomic weapons lies entirely on the con
science of the United States, the stub

bornness ol the Japanese military leader
ship certainly contributed to the failure of
diplomacy that led to Hiroshima and
Nagasaki.
Second, Mr. Fahmy emphasizes the
United States' role in supporting Israeli
aggression. However, neighboring Arab
states have played the aggressor in the
Near Fast as often and as reprehensibly as
Israel, it with less success. In November
11>47,l l >47, Arab states in the Near East reject
ed a U.N. proposal to split Palestine into
separate Jewish and Palestinian states, a
potentially manageable compromise
between Zionism and Pan Arabism. Then
in l l )4N, they invaded the newly created
state of Israel. Egypt's saber-rattling insti
gated the Six Day War in June 1%7. In
October 1973, over the Jewish holiday of
Yom Kippur, Egypt and Syria attempted
a surprise invasion of Israel.
Admittedly, Israel has contributed
much to tension in the Near East by its
systematic discrimination of Palestinians
and military designs in the Sinai, Eebanon
and West Bank. However, the difficult sit
uation in the Near East has resulted from
both Israeli and Arab aggression, not sim
ply the former. The United States would
do no better, according to Mr. Fahmy's
criteria, in supporting Arab states against
Israel.
Finally, the United States has inter
vened militarily in Kosovo and economi
cally in Iraq to prevent maniacal dictators
from senselessly murdering innocent peo
ple. The bombing of Serbia convinced Mr.
Milosevic to withdraw his brute squads
from Kosovo. The international peace
keeping force has attempted to disarm the

KLA to circumvent reprisals against
Kosovar Serbs. The United States main
tains its sanctions against Iraq because
Mr. Hussein insists on carrying out geno
cide against his nation's Kurdish minority.
Mr. Hussein's reluctance to govern with
any sense of morality or rationality con
tributes as much to the starving of Iraqi
children as U.S. stubbornness.
Mr. Fahmy challenges The Daily and
its readers to look at the flip side of
American diplomacy; however, 1 believe a
balanced, accurate perspective requires
objective consideration of both the Amer
ican and foreign perspectives.

Try to keep the facts
straight
How can people assert so many facts
obviously exaggerated, if not false, just to
support their opinion that American poli
cy is that of "a ferocious beast"? I come
from France, and it's a French national
spoil to criticize Americans and Ameri
can policy. But we never play with the
number of deaths, and we always avoid
hateful claims.
Hossani Fahmy's letter of Tuesday,
"The United States is a ferocious beast
and not a peaceful dove," clearly goes
beyond all bounds. I was shocked reading
its five claims, which are obviously mis
leading.
1. It's obviously misleading to assert
that "Japan declared that it would surren

der in WWII and yet the United States
used atomic bombs in Hiroshima and
Nagasaki." In fact, the Encyclopedia Bri
tannica (which 1 suppose is objective
enough) states that "on July 26 an ultima
tum was issued from the [Potsdam] con
ference to Japan demanding uncondition
al surrender and threatening heavier air
attacks otherwise. After Japan had reject
ed this ultimatum, the United States
dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki."
2. (a) It's obviously misleading to
assert that Israel refuses to abide by U.N.
Security Council resolutions. The peace
process is not yet finished, but Israel will
probably withdraw from some "occupied
territories" (declaration 242), and has
already accepted to withdraw from
Lebanon if "international peace and secu
rity" are guaranteed as defined by decla
ration 425. By the way, when did Syria
accept to abide by U.N. Security Council
resolutions and start immediate negotia
tions "aimed at establishing a just and
durable peace in the Middle Fast" (beau
tiful sentence taken from declaration
425), as Israel did?
(b) It's obviously misleading to assert
that the United States is the only member
to veto the propositions of the Arab
League at the U.N. Security Council.
Where have the United Kingdom or
France disappeared to?
3.) It's obviously misleading to assert
that "the United States gives itself the
right to enter other countries in order to
bomb pharmaceutical factories." Why
don't vou add that "U.S. officials have
said a soil sample taken from the factory
Hile contained evidence of Empta, a pre
cursor of the deadly VX nerve agent?"
4.) Its obviously misleading to assert
that the sanctions arc "killing millions of
children in Iraq." Did you know that the
sanctions have always exempted food and
medicine? Did you know that when a
French television crew went to Iraq to
film the lack of drugs in the hospitals, it
lound that the hospital was hiding the
needed drugs in the cellar? Did you know
that in Northern Iraq, where the U.N.
administers humanitarian assistance, child
mortality rates have fallen below pre-Gulf

War levels, whereas they have doubled
where Iraqi government controls the pro
gram (UNICEF figures)?
5.) It's obviously misleading to assert
that "the Kosovar refugees on their way
back to Kosovo were denied any potential
weapons while the Serbs still kept their
forces armed." The KFOR tries to disarm
the Serbs as well as the Kosovars, and up
to now the reports denounce more the
KFA than the Serbs for detaining arms.
The conclusion: defend your theory,
but keep the facts.

Clarifying SURE Escort's
policy
As shown by recent media coverage,
there has been some confusion regarding
SURE's policy of taking riders.
As a University funded service, SURE
will continue to give rides to anyone,
either female or male, who calls with a
concern for their personal safety. This
policy was stated in the original article by
Meagan Lindo on Friday. Oct. K ("SURE
introduces new cart, approach"). Gener
ally. this means SURE makes it a priority
to transport people traveling from the
outskirts of campus, people traveling

alone and women.
So, what's new then? What's new is
that SURE Escort is calling for individu
als traveling in groups or after a campus
party, when they can easily find someone
to accompany them, to stop using the
SURE Escort service for rides. SURE's
staff has found simply that too many peo
ple are using the SURF carts to transport
them home after a party, not because they
are concerned for their personal safety,
hut simply that they are too lethargic to
walk home.
We ask that all members of the Stan
ford community remember that the pur
pose of SURF Escort is to provide safe

escorts for individuals traveling alone at
night, and to help us make protection of
personal safety a top priority. SURE is
not intended to be a taxi service. If there
is student support for a taxi service then
by all means someone should create one.
Hut SURE Escort is not that service.

Clarifying SURE Escort's
policy
As shown by recent media coverage,
there has been some confusion regarding
SURE's policy of taking riders.
As a University funded service, SURE
will continue to give rides to anyone,
either female or male, who calls with a
concern for their personal safety. This
policy was stated in the original article by
Meagan Lindo on Friday. Oct. K ("SURE
introduces new cart, approach"). Gener
ally. this means SURE makes it a priority
to transport people traveling from the
outskirts of campus, people traveling

alone and women.
So, what's new then? What's new is
that SURE Escort is calling for individu
als traveling in groups or after a campus
party, when they can easily find someone
to accompany them, to stop using the
SURE Escort service for rides. SURE's
staff has found simply that too many peo
ple are using the SURF carts to transport
them home after a party, not because they
are concerned for their personal safety,
hut simply that they are too lethargic to
walk home.
We ask that all members of the Stan
ford community remember that the pur
pose of SURF Escort is to provide safe

escorts for individuals traveling alone at
night, and to help us make protection of
personal safety a top priority. SURE is
not intended to be a taxi service. If there
is student support for a taxi service then
by all means someone should create one.
Hut SURE Escort is not that service.

Fahmy should have consid
ered all perspectives
Mr. Ilnssnm Fahmy's recent letter to
The Daily addresses some interesting
issues in the history of U.S. diplomacy,
hut, regrettably, oversimplifies many ol
them, 112 irst, the military leaders of Japan
did not simply "declare their intent to sin
render" in the months preceding the
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In
June 1943, Emperor llirohito asked the
military leaders at the head of his govern
ment to surrender to the Allies. I lowever.
General Tojo and Ins colleagues refused
to accept the inevitability of defeat or the
prospect of unconditional surrender;
rather than approaching the United
States, their principal opponent for the
duration of the war. the Japanese military
junta attempted to broker a conditional
peace through the Soviet Union, which
would have allowed them to retain con
trol of the Japanese state.
The Allies had insisted upon uncondi
tional surrender to prevent I ojo and his
fellow war hawks, who had started the
war in China and the Pacific, who had
committed many atrocities in the interest
of imperialism, from remaining in power.
When the United States and Britain
would not countenance any conditional
surrender, Tojo's government decided to
take their chances fighting. Even after
President Truman threatened "prompt
and utter destruction" should Japan per
sist with hostilities. Tojo remained entire
ly recalcitrant. While the decision to use
atomic weapons lies entirely on the con
science of the United States, the stub

bornness ol the Japanese military leader
ship certainly contributed to the failure of
diplomacy that led to Hiroshima and
Nagasaki.
Second, Mr. Fahmy emphasizes the
United States' role in supporting Israeli
aggression. However, neighboring Arab
states have played the aggressor in the
Near Fast as often and as reprehensibly as
Israel, it with less success. In November
11>47,l l >47, Arab states in the Near East reject
ed a U.N. proposal to split Palestine into
separate Jewish and Palestinian states, a
potentially manageable compromise
between Zionism and Pan Arabism. Then
in l l )4N, they invaded the newly created
state of Israel. Egypt's saber-rattling insti
gated the Six Day War in June 1%7. In
October 1973, over the Jewish holiday of
Yom Kippur, Egypt and Syria attempted
a surprise invasion of Israel.
Admittedly, Israel has contributed
much to tension in the Near East by its
systematic discrimination of Palestinians
and military designs in the Sinai, Eebanon
and West Bank. However, the difficult sit
uation in the Near East has resulted from
both Israeli and Arab aggression, not sim
ply the former. The United States would
do no better, according to Mr. Fahmy's
criteria, in supporting Arab states against
Israel.
Finally, the United States has inter
vened militarily in Kosovo and economi
cally in Iraq to prevent maniacal dictators
from senselessly murdering innocent peo
ple. The bombing of Serbia convinced Mr.
Milosevic to withdraw his brute squads
from Kosovo. The international peace
keeping force has attempted to disarm the

KLA to circumvent reprisals against
Kosovar Serbs. The United States main
tains its sanctions against Iraq because
Mr. Hussein insists on carrying out geno
cide against his nation's Kurdish minority.
Mr. Hussein's reluctance to govern with
any sense of morality or rationality con
tributes as much to the starving of Iraqi
children as U.S. stubbornness.
Mr. Fahmy challenges The Daily and
its readers to look at the flip side of
American diplomacy; however, 1 believe a
balanced, accurate perspective requires
objective consideration of both the Amer
ican and foreign perspectives.

Try to keep the facts
straight
How can people assert so many facts
obviously exaggerated, if not false, just to
support their opinion that American poli
cy is that of "a ferocious beast"? I come
from France, and it's a French national
spoil to criticize Americans and Ameri
can policy. But we never play with the
number of deaths, and we always avoid
hateful claims.
Hossani Fahmy's letter of Tuesday,
"The United States is a ferocious beast
and not a peaceful dove," clearly goes
beyond all bounds. I was shocked reading
its five claims, which are obviously mis
leading.
1. It's obviously misleading to assert
that "Japan declared that it would surren

der in WWII and yet the United States
used atomic bombs in Hiroshima and
Nagasaki." In fact, the Encyclopedia Bri
tannica (which 1 suppose is objective
enough) states that "on July 26 an ultima
tum was issued from the [Potsdam] con
ference to Japan demanding uncondition
al surrender and threatening heavier air
attacks otherwise. After Japan had reject
ed this ultimatum, the United States
dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki."
2. (a) It's obviously misleading to
assert that Israel refuses to abide by U.N.
Security Council resolutions. The peace
process is not yet finished, but Israel will
probably withdraw from some "occupied
territories" (declaration 242), and has
already accepted to withdraw from
Lebanon if "international peace and secu
rity" are guaranteed as defined by decla
ration 425. By the way, when did Syria
accept to abide by U.N. Security Council
resolutions and start immediate negotia
tions "aimed at establishing a just and
durable peace in the Middle Fast" (beau
tiful sentence taken from declaration
425), as Israel did?
(b) It's obviously misleading to assert
that the United States is the only member
to veto the propositions of the Arab
League at the U.N. Security Council.
Where have the United Kingdom or
France disappeared to?
3.) It's obviously misleading to assert
that "the United States gives itself the
right to enter other countries in order to
bomb pharmaceutical factories." Why
don't vou add that "U.S. officials have
said a soil sample taken from the factory
Hile contained evidence of Empta, a pre
cursor of the deadly VX nerve agent?"
4.) Its obviously misleading to assert
that the sanctions arc "killing millions of
children in Iraq." Did you know that the
sanctions have always exempted food and
medicine? Did you know that when a
French television crew went to Iraq to
film the lack of drugs in the hospitals, it
lound that the hospital was hiding the
needed drugs in the cellar? Did you know
that in Northern Iraq, where the U.N.
administers humanitarian assistance, child
mortality rates have fallen below pre-Gulf

War levels, whereas they have doubled
where Iraqi government controls the pro
gram (UNICEF figures)?
5.) It's obviously misleading to assert
that "the Kosovar refugees on their way
back to Kosovo were denied any potential
weapons while the Serbs still kept their
forces armed." The KFOR tries to disarm
the Serbs as well as the Kosovars, and up
to now the reports denounce more the
KFA than the Serbs for detaining arms.
