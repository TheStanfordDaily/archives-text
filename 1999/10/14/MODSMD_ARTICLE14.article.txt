### 
£ « ack tt) School"
the phrase I
Jreme m b c r
dreading in elementary
school mid-summers,
always threatening to turn
August at the beach into
September in the class
room. The words brought

both warning and a sense of imminence, a
knowing feeling that after Labor Day the
lazy homework-free days would dissipate
into a faint memory. It was as it the trendy
new Trapper-Keepers and colorful pencil
cases could ameliorate the transition back
into seven-hour days in class. I used to hate
the first day back.
At Stanford, we generally look forward to
the return to campus. We flock back from
summer internships, lab research, trips
abroad and summers at the beach with a
renewed sense of hope and expectation.
Another chance at the dating scene, we won
der? Will this be the year I finally score?
I lopes at romantic success accompany reso
lutions of doing things right academically
once and for all. No more procrastination,
we tell ourselves, until we reach the Sunday
after the first week without a single book to
show for it.
The post-summer greetings are one of
September's true highlights: those moments
when we see someone in line at the Book
store, the post office, paying our bills or fight
ing for academic credit in a department
office. Sometimes there is instant recogni
tion, the well-known shriek followed by a
lunge and embrace, often exaggerated in
hopes of spectator attention. Ami then there
are those uncomfortable moments when our
minds register blanks on names that have
faded during two and a half long months of
brain rot.

There are those situations when we are 99
percent sure we are correct, but still don't
want to risk embarrassment by putting forth
"I Icy Chris!" and getting slapped in the face
with an, "it's Dan, remember?!" reply. So we
try the generic approach.
"Oh hcyl How are you'? How was your
summer? Where are you living this year?"
Sometimes it works line. Hut there's
always the chance that a third party arrives
on the scene and needs to be introduced. We
try to skirt it: we say, "Do you two know each
other?" hoping self-introductions will follow.
Often people are less than merciful. "No."
Where does this leave us? Scrambling, des
perate for clues, desperate for some sympa
thy in the process of trying to save face. We
strategi/e to avoid the name we forgot. " This
is Chris," we say, pointing to the third party.
"Chris and I lived in Branner together fresh
man year." We hope that this introduction
will inspire Sam to comment and then intro
duce himself. Sam says nothing. "Oh, cool."
An awkward moment passes.
Sometimes we strategi/e further. In some
cases, we might ask the elusive Sam for his
vital stats (phone/e-mail address) so we can
hang out sometime soon, hoping that will
yield some helpful clue into a name. In a per
fect world, Sam would jot down his full
name, followed by e-mail address, something
like sammy@leland, maybe even followed by
a "call me!" But no. Instead all he volunteers
is or joyboy@leland.
Sometimes the memory lapses are mutu
al; we see someone we sat next to in CIV sec
tion for a year, or someone we always say hi
to in Jamba Juice. These situations are past
the point where it is OK to ask. "I'm sorry,
could you tell me your name again?" The
only viable option is to smile and nod, discuss
the generic, "How's everything? Where are
you living? How was your summer? Do you

have plans for next year?"
There are also the people we don't espe
cially want to say hi to; the guy on our hall
from freshman year who always tried to bum
cough syrup off other residents to give him a;
better buzz, the girl from Hum Bio lecture;
who*always sat in the front row and asked a
question at 30-second intervals. We have to
acknowledge a mutual recognition when we
see each other, but this usually goes no fur
ther than, "Hey, how was your summer?
Any plans for next year?" (which you've got
to imagine she has).
There's also academic forgetfulness; the
dreaded first paper. We sit in front of our
computer and realize that our creativity has
evaporated and our essay-writing technique
has been noticeably retarded. In the midst of
constant hellos and spontaneous reunions
spilling into three-hour hang-outs, problem
sets and daily lectures seem like chores we
have to slot into busy schedules.
Fall re-integration into campus life is
tedious. We find ourselves wishing thai
September would just turn into October so
we could be free of schedule traumas, and wl
wish that October midterms wouldn't turn
fast into November midterms and December
finals, preceding another long break and
return to campus in January. This year may
be more exciting, what with Y2K. but the l;rll
quarter uptake will remain unchanged.
The ball is already rolling. As much as we
try to control its speed and inertia, we carpi
stop or slow its plunge into the year. Thic
"Back to School" sense of angst and desper
ation from elementary school still haunts us.
