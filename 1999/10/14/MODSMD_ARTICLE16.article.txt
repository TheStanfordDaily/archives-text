# Soph offerings hit 40 percent
## Seminar options rise for pre-meds 
### Jed Rose Contributing writer 
Undergraduates have praised
the close student faculty interaction
of Stanford Introductory Seminars.
But this quarter, sophomore pre
meds may have been especially
pleased as they perused their semi
nar course catalogs.
This fall, approximately 40 per
cent of all sophomore seminars are
geared toward pre-med students,
about double the percentage for
freshman seminars.
Sophomore offerings are deter
mined partly by faculty interest, as
professors must take the initiative to
create and lead classes. Shari
Palmer, director of Freshman/
Sophomore Programs, attributes
the large number of pre-med semi
nars to faculty initiative.
"Freshman seminars involve a
departmental commitment, while
sophomore seminars are individual
and thus more flexible," said
Palmer. "More School of Medicine
faculty have chosen to oiler sopho
more seminars, in large part because
of this flexibility."

Students are also quick to point
out that pre-med classes are in high
demand.
"There is a large percent of our
class pursuing pre-med. I n one of my
seminars more than 70 people ap
plied and only 12 were accepted."
said sophomore Alan Chen.
" The problem isn't that there are
too few pre-med ones; there just
should be more offered in the other
fields," Chen added.
This winter and spring, about
one-third of the sophomore semi
nars will be directed toward pre
med students.
"We aim for a wide variety of
courses offered to both freshmen
and sophomores each quarter, but
there is no way to be absolutely com
prehensive or rigidly balanced from
term to term." said Palmer.
She added that close interaction
with medical faculty is not limited to
SIS.
"I also would encourage [stu
dents! to contact the pre-med advi
sor at the Undergraduate Advising
C enter for other resources available
to undergraduates interested in a
medical career," Palmer said.
