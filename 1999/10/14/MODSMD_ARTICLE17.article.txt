# Assault group heightens awareness
## Self-defense lessons combat complacency and draw praise 
### Chris Drake 
Sexual assault is a threat at most
colleges and universities, and Stan
ford is no exception. To help
heighten community awareness
and strengthen assault prevention
skills, the Stanford Sexual Assault
Prevention Program offers general
counseling, self-defense classes,
and a bi-weekly newsletter.
Run entirely bv students, the
SSAPP plans to expand its services
this year.
The SSAPP, founded five years
ago, responds to student interests
and implements programs based
on community input.

Students concede that although
sexual assault is a pressing issue at
Stanford, community awareness of
the problem is low.
"[Awareness is] not that good,"
senior Tung Tran said. "People
don't take it too seriously."
"Most people think that (as
saults) don't happen at Stanford,
hut they really do," said senior
Shelley Tadaki.
According to Self-Defense Pro
gram Coordinator Kym Solheim. a
senior, students are most suscepti
ble to sexual assault during their
first three months on campus. She
said the primary risk factors in
clude alcohol, drugs and other

"dangerous situations" in which
younger students more frequently
find themselves.
Freshman Rachel Spitzer said
that she often questions her safety.
"[You] constantly think of how
your safety is being impaired.
Sometimes it's very scary."
"At night, I feel more vulnera
ble," freshman F.niily Chang said.
"You want to be ready for things."
Both Spitzer and Chang partici
pated in an SSAPP self-defense
class to learn more about assault
prevention.
The SSAPP's self-defense class
es teach immediate prevention of
assault. Students learn about both

non-physical techniques, such as**
awareness and assertiveness, and
physical techniques, such as how to2|
repel attackers. The classes are free £
and open to everyone in the Stan-" *
ford community.
After last night's presentation in">
Okada, class participants were;i
overwhelmingly enthusiastic about j
what they learned.
"I thought the class was cool. Itrf
was fun. Everybody was really
it." Tran said after last night's class., J
Senior Holly Kim helped orga- 112
nize the program at Okada. "1 -
think the messages were really pos- >
itive. [The material covered]
just what to do in an assault, but [it J*
also| emphasized the sociological *
and psychological factors leading *
up to an assault. It [is] a very sup-«J
portive environment," she said. *
While women are the primary
victims of sexual assault and use *
the SSAPP's resources most fre
quently, the SSAPP strongly urges
men to join its programs.
"We work under the belief that
men and women have to work to
gether," Solheim said. One of the
SSAPP's major goals, she added, is
"not to distance the men. Men are
encouraged to participate."
Last night's class included
roughly equal numbers of men and
women.
In addition to teaching self-de
fense classes, the SSAPP distrib
utes an e-mail newsletter with pre
vention tips and upcoming events.
Solheim said that more re->
sources are in the works this fall, in
cluding a more advanced self-de
fense class and a special class for
graduate students.
