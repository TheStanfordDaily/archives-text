# Task force welcomes millennium
## Stanford systems look OK for Y2K 
### Kristin Rose 
As January 1 approaches,
should the Stanford community be
concerned about the Y2K bug?
According to Stanford Y2K Pro
ject Manager Karl Heins, "Life on
the Stanford campus during the
first week of the year 2(MK) should
be business as usual."
In a letter to students, faculty
and staff. Provost John Hennessy
and Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs James Montoya said they do
not expect Y2K delays at the be
ginning of winter quarter. Under
graduate residences are expected
to open on Sunday, Jan. 2, and
classes will begin the following
Tuesday.
On Oct. 1 the Y2K Task Force
declared all of Stanford's adminis
trative and medical systems ready
lor the millennium.
The Y2K Task Force will con
tinue testing critical systems up to
and beyond the Jan. 1 deadline.
Heins described this testing as
"very thorough" and said the Y2K
Task Force will continuously mon
itor new developments.
"I am proud of what the Y2K
Task Force has been able to ac
complish for Y2K readiness,"
Heins said.
According to the electronic
newsletter Stanford Y2K News, in
dividual schools and departments
are still working with Y2K Task
Force members to finalize prepara
tions.

Heins said he believes that
"Stanford University systems are
within a scope we can control." In
addition to maintaining Stanford's
critical systems, Heins and the
Y2K Task Force monitor Y2K
readiness in the outside world.
Heins said he is satisfied with
the Y2K readiness of major hank
ing, power and travel companies.
But he acknowledged that some
conditions are beyond University
control.
In their letter, Hennessy and
Montoya wrote, "Although we feel
confident in Stanford's Y2K readi
ness, we cannot and do not vouch
for the Y2K readiness of systems
and services outside of Stanford â€”
for example, transportation and
communication systems."
In response to this concern,
deadlines for University bill pay
ments and University housing
check-in have been extended to
Friday, Jan. 7.
The Overseas Studies Program
has delayed the starting dates of
winter quarter so that no students
will have to fly before Jan. 3.
Freshman David Scheurl, who
will be spending winter break in
Munich, Germany, said he does
not anticipate travel difficulties.
"I am confident that my travel
plans will not be disturbed when I
return to Stanford from Germany
on Jan. 3. I would like to think that
the airlines will be prepared for any
disruptions that may be caused by
the Y2K bug," Schuerl said.
