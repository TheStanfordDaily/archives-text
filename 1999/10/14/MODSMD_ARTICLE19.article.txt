# Experts learn from Turkey quake
## 
### Jonathan Dunn 
Concerned about the possibility
of a large-magnitude earthquake in
the Bay Area, three engineers who
traveled to Turkey to study the
damage from the Aug. 17 Izmit
earthquake spoke on campus yes
terday.
Stanford's Blume Earthquake

Center has sent teams to study
earthquakes in the past, but this in
vestigation was unique because of
the similarities between the fault in
Turkey and faults in California.
"The North Anatalian Fault is
about the same as the Hayward
Fault. At this moment, we are wor
ried that the Hayward Fault could
exhibit behavior such like the North

Anatalian Fault," said Menlo Park
structural engineer Mehmet Qelebi.
"You can imagine the impact on
the Bay Area. We are very, very
worried."
The Izmit earthquake, which
registered 7.4 on the Richter Scale,
was felt for S,(XX) square miles and
killed between 15,(XX) and 35,(XX)
people.

Qelebi, along with two other
structural engineers — Stanford
graduates Nesrin Basoz and Piotr
D. Moneacz — presented their find
ings on the seismology, life effects
and industrial facility damage of the
Izmit quake.
£elebi said that Turkish building
codes were not implemented, and
that lax enforcement was the chief
cause of damage in the Izmit quake.
Basoz, a structural engineer at K2
Technologies, said much of the dam
age in Turkey occurred because of
poor engineering. While Istanbul's
modern buildings suffered little
structural damage, buildings and
bridges in some remote towns were
destroyed, so that "rescue efforts
could not pass to villages for weeks."
Along with major structural
damage, refineries caught fire and
water pipes were destroyed. In the
largest refinery fire, "temperatures
rose so high fire engines melted
under the 100-degree centigrade ex
tremes," said Moneacz, president of
the earthquake research group Ex
ponent-Failure Analysis.
The three engineers agreed that
the lesson learned from the Izmit
earthquake is one of planning.
Moneacz explained that govern
ments "should plan structures to
avoid a collapse, or study the risk as
sociated with a collapse" in order to
remain earthquake-safe.
Otherwise, the danger future
earthquakes pose to large urban
areas could be much greater than
the devastation seen in Turkey this
summer. Moneacz said.
