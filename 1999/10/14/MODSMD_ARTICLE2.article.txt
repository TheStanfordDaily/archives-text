Stanford has raised a record
amount for the 1998-99 fiscal year,
with gifts totaling $319.6 million, ac
cording to an announcement made
Tuesday by Vice President for De
velopment John Ford.
Although only a slight increase

from last year's $319.4-million figure, the results signi -
fy the fourth consecutive year that the University has
exceeded $300 million in cash receipts.
In comparison with other elite universities, such as
I larvard. Princeton and MI T, Stanford ranked second
in contributions, surpassed only by Harvard's $452
million.
A combination of factors has contributed to the
continued growth of gifts to Stanford, lord said.
"I think the emphasis [University] President [Ger
hard] Casper has made on annual giving, our efforts to
organize The Stanford Fund around class giving and
the healthy economy are the three elements that have
worked very well for us." Ford said in a press release.
In his announcement. Ford highlighted the 15 per
cent increase in the total number of gifts to the Uni
versity and the 11-percent growth of donors.
The Stanford Fund, created five years ago to raise

money for undergraduate education, colleeted a
record $8,699,178 last year, an increase of 26 percent.
Stanford Fund Director Chris Ponce said the rise in
gifts was driven by the success of reunion fundraising
and the increase in alumni contributions.
"Alumni contributions often are not more than
$1(X)." Ponce said.
"In fact, 86 percent of gifts from undergraduate
alumni are $ 10(3 or less. From these numbers, you can
really see the power of collective giving."
" The percentage of undergraduate alumni giving to
Stanford is going up faster than any percentage in the
country," Ford said.
Last year, alumni participation increased from 35
percent to a record 39 percent.
While many elite universities' alumni participation
levels have plateaued. Ponce said he is optimistic
about The Stanford Fund's future.
To sustain last year's growth. The Stanford Fund
will maintain general communication with alumni and
will keep up with requests for annual gifts, according
to Ponce.
"The more informed Stanford alumni are about the
good things going on around campus, the more recep
tive they are to requests for support." he said.
