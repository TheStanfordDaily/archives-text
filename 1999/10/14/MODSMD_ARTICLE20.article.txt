WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL

■ Tonight: No. 6 Stanford (12-2,6-1 Pacific 10 Con
ference) vs. Arizona State (9-4,5-2). 7 p.m.. Maples
Pavilion

■ Tomorrow: Stanford vs. No. IS Arizona (11-4,5
2), 7 p.m.. Maples Pavilion

For Stanford (12-2. 6-1 Pacific 10 Conference),
it would be easy to dwell on a disappointing loss to
UCLA last week or look ahead to a huge show
down against No. 3 University of Pacific next Tues
day, but Arizona (11-4.5-2) and Arizona State (9-
4.5-2) should certainly not be overlooked.
Although the Cardinal has a combined record
of 70-4 against the Wildcats and Sun Devils, head
coach Don Shaw will be the first to point out that
fact far from guarantees a victory against either
team.
"None of that stuff means anything in regards to
these matches." he said.
He stresses that because these teams are on the
bad end of this impressive compilation of victories,
"they will be hungry" to knock off Stanford, a team
that has dominated them for so lone.

Indeed, the story line is much the same for both
Arizona State and Arizona.
The Cardinal has beaten the Sun Devils in 11
straight matches dating back to 1993, including
both matches last year. These numbers nearly mir
ror those for the Wildcats, a team the Cardinal has
vanquished in the past 10 matches and defeated in
four games in both meetings last season.
In general, the Cardinal has been especially im
posing at home, where it has a 49-game winning
streak against Pac-10 opponents. The Cardinal is
looking to extend its current 33-game string of vic
tories at Maples.
I iowever, the Cardinal's numbers take on a de
cidedly less rosy glow when one considers the cur
rent Pac-10 standings. Stanford resides in second
place, half of a game behind UCLA as a result of
last week's loss to the Bruins. Only a game behind
the Cardinal are Arizona and Arizona State.
Suddenly, the history between Stanford and
these teams seems irrelevant, as the Cardinal must
win these games to stay on the heels of the Bruins
and in contention for the Pac-10 title. Coach Shaw
sums up the situation, saying, "In this conference,
you've got to take it one match at a time."
In preparation its faceoff with two Pac-10 rivals,
the Cardinal has been focusing on polishing its own
play instead of addressing the style of play of its op
ponents.
"We're trying to get our basic defense down."
Shaw said. "Before last week, the schedule had
been relatively easy and we'd gotten away with
some things that we can't anymore."

The loss to UCLA brought some of these prob
lems to light, and Stanford will definitely need to
take the lessons learned from its match against the
Bruins into its games this week.
In Arizona State and Arizona. Stanford will find
two worthy opponents who have endured tough
schedules and. as Shaw says, "are used to playing
good teams."
The Cardinal will have to contend with Sun
Devil junior outside hitter Amanda Burbridge.
With 788 career kills. Burbridge ranks fifth among
active Pac-10 leaders.
Senior defensive specialist Dai ice Smith and
sophomore Jami Coughlin also are expected it) be
important contributors for Arizona State.
The Wildcats will be led by junior middle block
er Marisa DaLee. She has been on fire of late, hit
ting an Arizona season-best .fi67 against Washing
ton last Thursday. She followed up the feat the next
night against Washington State with her third con
secutive match hitting .6(H) or better.
Both teams will have a little extra motivation in
gunning for Stanford this week: Arizona State be
cause the team's game will be televised live on Fox
Sports Net. and Arizona due to the fact that head
coach David Rubio. in his eighth year with the
Wildcats, will be coaching his 4(K)th career match.
The Cardinal will be happy to commence its
four-game homestand Thursday night, but the
schedule only looks to get tougher from there with
back-to-back matches against the Arizona schools
and then games against Pacific and rival California
the following week.
