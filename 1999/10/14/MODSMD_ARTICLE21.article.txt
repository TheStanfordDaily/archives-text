### Ben Allen Staff writer 
At this point in the cross country
season, the No. 2 Stanford Machine
has yet to have been really chal
lenged by any team it has faced. The
team also has yet to have run at full
capacity.

■ Saturday: Stanford competes in
the Pre-NCAA tournament in
Bloomington, Ind.

All of that is about to change.
This Saturday, the Cardinal will
travel to Bloomington. Ind.. the site
of this year's NCAA Championship
meet, to participate in the annual
Pre-NCAA meet. Joined by No. 5
Colorado. No. 6 Arizona. No. 7
BYU. No. Northern Arizona and
No. 10 Oregon, among others. Stan

"I don't think we've really had a
true test as to where we are yet."
head coach Vin Lananna said. "All

season I've been putting our team in
vulnerable positions to see who will
step up. This time, I think it will be
the most representative team that we
can run.
"The outcome will be important
here — we'll see how we end up
doing against Colorado, who is sup
posedly pretty good." Lananna said.
Bloomington's eight-kilometer
course differs only slightly from the
l()k course which will be run at the
national meet. Though Lananna
thinks it will give Stanford a feel for
the Bloomington racing atmosphere,
he does not believe that the way the
race plays out will be indicative of
w hat to expect in November.
" This race will give us a feel for
the terrain, a feel for the turns, a feel
for w hat the elevations of the course
really are," Lananna said. "But the
pre-nationals for the men has not
been anything like the nationals. The
race doesn't go out the same way.

couple of years, and it's not been

And though Lananna plans to fi
nally unleash his top returner, junior
Jonathon Riley, there remains a de
gree of uncertainty as to where the
chips may fall after the starter's gun
fires.
"Jonathon has been working out
very well, but no matter how much
you train, it's not the same as racing,"
Lananna said. "This will be an oppor
tunity for him to get the cobwebs
out."
Riley has not raced on the trails
since last year's ninth-place finish at
the NC A A meet, but Lananna iscon

fldent he will be able to hold his own.
"Jonathon is a pretty heads-up
runner. I'm not worried about him
being successful. But I'm not expect
ing him to be fantastic — he's still run
ning 90 miles per week," Lananna
said.
Aside from Riley, top individual
contenders include Oregon's Steve
Fein and Stanford Invitational champ
Mieheil Jones of Arizona.
Lananna will select six others to
join Riley from a talent pool includ

"I think that the country is a little
more even this year than it has been
in the past," Lananna said. "In the
past, it's been Arkansas, Stanford,
then everybody else. This year, I
think it's Arkansas, and then every
body else.
"And I think that everyone else —
Wisconsin, North Carolina State,
Colorado and Stanford — is pretty

lead, but they just haven't run against
