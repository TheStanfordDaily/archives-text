Past performance is not indica

Stanford women's cross country
coach Vin Lananna is well aware of
this Wall Street investing dis
claimer. As his top-ranked team
heads to Indiana University for the
Pre-NCAA meet Saturday, Lanan
na knows his team's performance
will not guarantee anything come
NCAAs on Nov. 22.

WOMEN'S
CROSS COUNTRY

■ Saturday: Stanford competes in
the Pre-NCAA tournament in
Bloomington. Ind.

Over the past three years, begin
ning with the Cardinal's first and
only national title in 19%. the win
ner of the Pre-NCAA meet has
never gone on to win the national
title. In fact, in that first year, the

Stanford women didn't even both
er making the trip toTuscon, Ariz.
In 1997. the defending champi
ons did participate at Pre-NCAAs
in Furman, S.C.. where they de
stroyed their nearest competitor by
50 points. There was no repeat in
November, however, where the
Brigham Young Cougars — absent
at Pre-NCAAs — edged the Cardi
nal by a slim two points.
Last year. Stanford again won
easily in Lawrence. Kan., heating
second-place Arizona by NO and
third-place Villanova by 87. Vil
lanova regrouped, got its No. 1 run
ner back from injury and went on
to edge BYU and Stanford at the
real deal on Nov. 23.
"This weekend is going to have
absolutely no impact in terms of
race outcome or on how we race at
NCAAs." Lananna said. "This is a
good opportunity for us to have a
hard race and a good competitive
effort on the NCAA course. And
we'll be able to refine what we're
going to need to do at NCAAs in

terms of strategy."
With eight of the top nine teams
in the country participating in Sat
urday's version of Pre-NCAAs,
Lananna's squad should get a
strong sense of how the NCAAs
will develop over the Bloomington
terrain.
The already tested Stanford will
face third-ranked rival BYU and
defending national champion and
No. 9 Villanova as well as No. 4
Arizona State. No. 5 Wisconsin,
No. (i Cieorgetown. No. 7 ( olorado
and No. >S Kansas State. Among the
top nine, only No. 2 Arkansas will
he absent.
"We'll go out and try to win the
meet, but make no delusions that
this outcome will be indicative of
the final score at NCAAs," Lanan
na said. "But how we run it. where
we move, how it feels going
through two miles and getting into
the position where we know what
to expect are all important."
The top eight Stanford runners
from the Cardinal's impressive win

over Arkansas, BYU. Wisconsin
and Kansas State at the Stanford
Invitational on Oct. 2 will all travel
to Bloomington. That group in
cludes junior Julia Stamps, senior
Sally Glynn, freshmen Lauren
Fleshman. Katie Hotchkiss, Erin
Sullivan and Mariel Ettinger and
sophomores Laura Turner and
Caroline Annis.
"We'll employ the same strate
gy we've been employing all sea
son." Lananna said. "Our goal is to
tighten up the gap between our No.
1 and No. 7 runners [which was I
minute. 2 seconds at the Stanford
Invitational] and to put ourselves
into a position where we can see
each other," Lananna said. "We'll
pay closer attention to where we
are as opposed to where anybody
else is. I think that's what we have
to do in all of our championship
meets."
While Stanford is the favorite to
take the team title, who will run
