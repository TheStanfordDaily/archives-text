■ Tomorrow: Stanford vs. Pennsyl

■ Saturday: Stanford vs. Columbia
(3-6). 3 p.m.

■ Sunday: Stanford (4-6,3-0 North

There, Stanford (4-6, 3-0 North
ern Pacific Conference) will en
counter one NorPac competitor,
Davis & Elkins. The three remain
ing teams — Temple, Pennsylvania
and Columbia — are newcomers to
the Cardinal's schedule, but they still
pose considerable threats because of
their exposure to the top-ranked
teams on the East Coast.
For co-captain Sarah Medieros. a
redshirt senior who was sidelined
much of the past two years with knee
injuries, this is her 13th field hockey

road trip. Experience, she says, does
make the trips seem a little easier.
"I almost take trips for granted
now." Medieros said. "Once you
begin to know how things go and
what to expect, going all the way to
Philadelphia seems like any other

weekend lull of games. It helps to
make the string of games less daunt
ing."
I'he Cardinal hopes that this
short trip will allow the team to es
tablish itself as a competitive threat
to teams in the Hast. The top-ranked

teams consistently come from that
part of the country, where field
hockey is a more visible sport and
players tend to start learning the
game earlier in life. As the Cardinal

gains more exposure to these East
Coast teams, it continues to build on
its experience, which brings it one
step closer to top-ranked caliber
competition.
The first game of the series will be
held today at Temple (4-8). Temple
has tested its skills against tough
teams so far this season — five of its
opponents were ranked in the top
20. and two of them in the top three.
One of the four victories the Owls
have posted is against Louisville,
which defeated Stanford 2-1 in Sep
tember.
The following evening, the Cardi
nal plays its first night game of the
season under the lights in the stadi
um at Penn.The Ouakers (2-7) don't
have an impressive record to show,
but have seen tough competition so
far and will challenge the Cardinal
with an experienced forward line.
Five players deep, that line will be

facing the Stanford players as they
recover from a game the previous
day.
Columbia (3-6), like Penn, has
faced tough competition from teams
in the East. The game should be an
even matchup. But again, the Cardi
nal will be recovering, this time from
two days of playing.
The five-day trip ends against
conference competitor Davis &
Elkins (1-9, 0-3 NorPac). The team
hopes that the game will allow it to
remain undefeated in the NorPac.
In addition to the mental chal
lenges posed by a five-day road trip,
Stanford will encounter the physical
challenge of playing four games in
four days. Although the team is
young, the talented troupe of six
freshmen will provide the depth re
quired for such an exhausting feat.
"The freshmen this year aren't
your typical freshmen. Three of
them already start," said Medieros,
referring to Amrit Chima, Dalinda
Banuelos and Amanda Billmyer.
"All six freshmen are talented and

hard enough workers to really have
made a presence on the team."
This trip, the second one of the
season, will seem a lot different from
the team's first trip to St. Louis in
early September.
"That trip was early in the season
and we were still getting to know
each other — on and off the field."
sophomore defender Sarah Herman
said. "This week's emphasis will be
more on working together and im
proving communication."
This week's trip also comes after
a 2-1 loss to Davidson. That game
left the players frustrated by the
number of scoring opportunities
that never quite followed through,
and it has acted as an incentive for
the team to play the kind of game it
knows it is capable of.
"Monday's loss frustrated us to
the point where we all want to get
out there now and win." senior co
captain Mallory Chambers said.
" The teams we face this week are
good, but they're beatable and we
know it."
