# Writer speaks of struggles with disability, culture
## 
### Sarah Mearon 
Last night, the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center was the site for a reading
by Oregon-born poet, essayist and activist
Eli Clare.
"Exile and Pride: Disability, Queerness,
and Liberation," a collection of essays, is
Clare's first book.
In the deeply personal and political es
says, she draws on her experiences as a les
bian with cerebral palsy.
"It was really important for us to have an
event that would speak to the intersection
between sexual identity and disability," said
Ben Davidson, LGBCC director.
The LGBCC co-hosted the event with the
Women's Center and the Disability Re
source Center.
Growing up in a working class community
in the backwoods of Oregon, Clare was
deeply affected by the conflict between the
logging and fishing industries that supported
her community and the industries' negative
environmental impact.
"When I left, I found that place stayed
with me in a significant way," she said.
When Clare moved to Michigan, she was
again exposed to what she calls "the tragedy
of industrial forestry," which spurred her to
draw on her childhood experiences and write
about environmental policy.
Clare draws on her experience as a dis

abled gay woman in an essay called "Freaks
and Queers," exploring the use of words such
as "disabled." "cripple," "gimp," "retard"
and "freak."
"I had heard disabled people call them
selves 'freaks.' It bothered me. It made me
uncomfortable. And I thought about the
word "queer.' It's a really good description of
my relationship to the dominant culture,"
Clare said.
Much of Clare's writing involves an at
tempt to understand the development of self
identity and pride, which she describes as a
tool to end self-hatred and create social
change.
Monica Goracke, a Stanford law student
who grew up in the same area as Clare, at
tended the reading and said she strongly
identified with many of the essays in "Exile
and Pride."
"I thought she had amazing things to say
about different facets of identity. I thought it
was very empowering," Goracke said.
Clare said she feels her writing "lives at
the intersection between privacy and the
public, the personal and the political."
"I think that this book fills a real hole. Dis
ability has not been woven into the conversa
tion about progressive social change," she
added.
She said she wrote the book with a firm
goal in mind. "I want dialogue. I want people
talking about this stuff," she said.
