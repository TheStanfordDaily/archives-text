## 
### Valentine Ding Contributing writer 
Members of the newlv-formed
Graduate Student Council met last
night in the dining room of the Bech
tel International Center. The meet
ing, led by GSC chair and physics
doctoral student Kaleb Michaud, fo
ctfsed on graduate student housing,
health insurance and appointments
on the Nominations Commission.
One highlight of the meeting was
the discussion of graduate student
housing. With the increase of off
campus rent outpacing the increase
of graduate student stipends, the
housing v market fir tfftiatn ■source of
discontent among graduate stu
dents. According to the GSC hous
ing report, off-campus rents "have
increased 20 percent in the last year.
. . . On-campus rents are being
raised 6.2 percent next year on aver
age."
Stanford is petitioning for a Gen
eral Land Use Permit from the
counties that oversee Stanford
lands, in hopes of building housing
and academic facilities. A series of
council meetings are being held this
week by the Palo Alto City Council
Chambers, Menlo Park City Coun
cil Chambers, Palo Alto Planning
Commission and the Portola Valley
Town Council to debate the issue.
'.The University is expecting an
evaluation of its land-use proposal
by Nov. 15. Without approval, the
plan for building 1,900 housing spots
for graduate students will not mate
rialize.
"1 really encourage you to go the
meetings, talk to people there and
(make them know] the situation."

Michaud said yesterday to members
of the GSC.
Leaders of the meeting also en
couraged GSC members to volun
teer for NoniCom, spots.
The NomCom selects Stanford
students to work on University poli
cy-making committees such as the
Graduate Housing Advisory Com
mittee.
The NomCom conducts surveys
and interviews among students, and
is composed of a chair, three under
graduate representatives and three
graduate representatives.
After the GSC split from the
ASSU Senate this year, the Nom-
Com had several spots open for
graduate representatives.
"NomCom is an important op
portunity for students to directly im
pact the operation of the Universi
ty," said electrical engineering mas
ter's student Paul Hartke, a member
of the GSC.
Three GSC members volun
teered to serve on the NomCom last
night.
The health insurance report also
attracted the members' attention.
"The biggest issue is that the cost
[of the health insurance] is getting
higher and higher," said Michaud.
"Regularly, the insurance goes up at
the rate of $10 a year. But if you have
a spouse or parents, that rate
changes to $50 a year."
Many graduate students have
spouses, children or parents — the
"dependents" who raise the insur
ance cost disproportionately.

ment can't afford the insurance
And if they don't have an insurance

Phis is a critical issue."
Many members called for the
University to support graduate stu
dents with spouses and families and
thus reduce the extra fee for the de
pendents.
