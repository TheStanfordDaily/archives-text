Welcome to the San Francisco Bay Area. Hope you brought your CD collection
because Bay Area radio sucks. There, I've said it. Now I'll say why: The
Telecommunications Act of 1996.
The same act that promised lower phone bills and brought higher cable bills is also re
sponsible for the homogenization of broadcast radio in this great country of ours.
Here begins a brief history of the last 10 years of FM radio rock in the Bay Area. Once
upon a time, there was a radio station for every type of rock and roll you could ever
want — Regular (98.5, KOME); Hard (92.3, KSJO); Modern (105.3, KITS, a.k.a. Live

105); Classic (97.3, KRQR); and so on. There was (and is)
also a station that featured roughly equal parts of Mellow
and Classic Rock (104.5 KFOG) — along with tons of easy
listening — but it was never really my type, so I'll restrict my
attention to the more interesting stations. (Editor's note: We
happen to like KFOG in light of the sameness of most rock
stations, but for argument's sake, we'll keep quiet.)
Of course, there's still oldies and easy listening, as well as
country and R&B. I can't say I listen to any of them too
often, either.
The Telecommunications Act, among other things,
eased restrictions on radio ownership, so one company
could own far more radio stations in one area than was pre
viously allowed. In rock, that company is CBS / Infinity
Broadcasting, which has obtained ownership of 97.3, 98.5
and 105.3 (among other stations). I'm not sure who owns
92.3, but whoever they are, they can also afford to buy fre
quencies 92.1 and 92.7. Anyway, 97.3 was converted to the
growing "Adult At-Work Alternative" format — pretty
much a nice way of saying "Easy Listening for Those Who
Want to Keep Up" — and dubbed with the market-tested
name,." Alice." (Editor's note: Mix 106.5, Z 95.7 and Chan
nel 104.9 are also lurking in the rock genre.)

Sadly, it's the best thing out there, because Infinity created "the New KOME," giving
the old KOME an "alternative" and yet unmistakably corporate spin. It was actually pret
ty decent, as long as you never escaped puberty and realized that there must be more out
there.
However, not content to rehaul the formats and fire the DJs from two of its three rock
stations. Infinity started to tinker with KITS, firing the morning DJ and mainstreaming
operations in general. When this didn't work, it decided to transfer the KOME style to
KITS, including Howard Stern, Loveline and the type of music you expect to go along
with such "cutting-edge" programming. KOME is gone, at least unofficially; its staff has

moved to KITS, whose current playlist is topped by Bush, Korn, Kid Rock and Blink 182.
Now, I don't follow the radio rating system, but I do know that friends who once lis
tened to these ransacked Bay Area institutions now go elsewhere for radio, or at least for
music. I pretty much listen to NPR (88.5, KQED), and when I feel like music, I flip around
until I get impatient enough to put on a CD.
There's Stanford's own 90.1 (KZSU), but as I write this, they are playing beat poet
ry — not exactly what I had in mind. As admirable as it may be, cutting-edge hodgepodge
radio does not suit my lifestyle. This is unfortunate, because my only other choice is ho-

mogeneity. What happened to listenable eclecticism? Hell,
what ever happened to Top 40?
I learn about new bands from friends, from reviews
or from the UK charts, where taste still has some say in what
succeeds. When I travel, I take time to listen to the radio sta
tions of where I go, and although things are a bit better else
where, the Telecommunications Act is homogenizing radio
all over the country. (Editor's note: Fun fact for you all —
country music still commands the most radio station playing
formats in the U.S.)
Seeing perfectly good radio stations being destroyed
by greedy, tone-deaf corporate Pointy-Haired-Bosses-in-
Pin-Striped-Suits is frustrating, to say the least. They are
people who think that focus groups work the same way as a
radio market and that San Francisco listeners have similar
tastes to those in Fargo.
Radio is the aspect of the law which bugs me the
most, but there are more wide-reaching effects of the
Telecommunications Act. So extensive is the act that ac
claimed media watchdog, Project Censored
(http://www.sonoma.edu/ProjectCensored/pasttopten/
Storiesl99s.html) called it the most censored story of 1995
(the year of the bill's proposal).
The reasons? The potential for Internet regulation,

corporate welfare, corporate-controlled "censorship" and TV-cable-Internet oligopolies
and monopolies. Any good liberal will know all about it, and any good conservative will
staunchly defend some parts of it while vehemently disavowing others.

Or just listen to the radio and hear for yourself.
