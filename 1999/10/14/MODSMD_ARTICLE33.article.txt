# New SFMOMA exhibit focuses on cameras
## Art / comedy 
### 
A Kodak moment may trigger thoughts of poppy fields and couples embracing,
but rarely does it remind one of Edgar Degas' pastel dancers or of Pablo Pi
casso's Blue Period. "Degas to Picasso: Painters, Sculptors and the Camera,"
a new exhibit at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, can change that. On view
until Jan. 2,2000, this clever display challenges the modern conception of the camera
by turning the lens onto 14 turn-of-the-century artists.

"This exhibition explores how photography, in
its role as art object, document, scientific innovation
and marketing tool, served as a powerful agent for
change," explained Dr. Dorothy Kosinski. Curator
of European Art at the Dallas Museum of Art and
organizer of the exhibit.
Dating from 1885 to 1915, the 364 paintings,
drawings, sculptures and photographs on view
demonstrate the vast influence of photography on

the work of prominent Modernist artists. Arranged chronologically, the show begins
with Degas and ends with Picasso. Other featured artists are Pierre Bonnard, Con
stantin Brancusi, Paul Gauguin, Edward Munch, Auguste Rodin and Edouard Vuil
lard.
"The role played by the camera in the work of the 14 artists is distinct in each case,"
said Kosinski. "For Moreau and Von Stuck, photographs, orchestrated in the studio

with great care, functioned as a kind of 112
preparatory 'sketch 1 for the finished I
work in oil. Some artists, such as the
sculptor Rodin, never took their own
photographs, while others, such as Degas
or Rosso, took great pleasure in manipu
lating the new medium themselves."
While the exhibition centers around
the dialogue between specific artists and
the photography that influenced them, it
also focuses on the unique role the inven
tion of photography played during the
late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Whereas the camera currently func- j
tions as a common household tool, it was
anything but common one century ago.
In some cases, in fact, the medium of
photography was shunned for its me
chanical and realistic representation.
Many of the artists included in the ex
hibition denied their reliance on photo
graphic equipment, while others con
demned the photographer's artistic legit
imacy and insisted on taking all of their
pictures themselves. Belgian artist Fer
nand Khnopff, best known for his myste
rious Symbolist paintings, went so far as to

publicly deny his use of photography. However, this rejection was contradicted by
the sophisticated photographic equipment found in his studio following his death.
.Whether it be the juxtaposition of Colonial photographs from Tahiti and Gau
guin's exotic canvases, or the blue-tinted cyanotype next to Picasso's melancholy
"Portrait of a Man," the exhibit explores a powerful relationship between modern art
and formative technological innovation.
In an age where technology is quickly displacing traditional forms of art, "Degas
to Picasso" is an important reminder of the immense power of multi-media. By ex
amining the roots of Modernism, this exhibition reveals the interdependence between
man's creative expression and his undeniable reliance on machinery. Though much
has changed since the advent of the Kodak camera, art and technology continue to re
flect the growing complexity of contemporary society.
