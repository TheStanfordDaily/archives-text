# World's Greatest Mime Comes to San Francisco
## 
### 
Marcel Marceau has certainly earned his title as "The
World's Greatest Mime." His career, which began
before many of our parents were born (in 1944), has
brought Marceau worldwide acclaim and has made him the
icon for the art of mime. He has returned to San Francisco
after performing a highly acclaimed series of sold-out shows in
July, and he will be performing until Oct. 24.
Mime performances bring out the essence of human inter
action and must draw from the core activities that make us
human, for it is difficult for an old man in a white unitard to
play hundreds of people of varying ages, genders and disposi
tions. As one critic describes, Marceau "accomplishes in less
than five minutes what most novelists cannot do in volumes."
The tightly packed and chattering audience at San Francis
co's Theater on the Square was silenced by his presence as
Marceau began the show with "The Creation of the World," a
mime recreating the Biblical tale. He finished the first half of
the show with "Youth, Maturity, Old Age and Death," a well
known sketch encapsulating the entire walk of life within the
amount of time it takes to walk to class.
Marceau's performances balanced the weight of human
suffering with pure joy and humor, and they brought the audi
ence into varying states of wonder, uncontrollable laughter

and deep thought. Serious sketches on
human nature and suffering, such as
"The Hands" and"The Bird Keeper,"
were balanced out by hysterically
funny sketches such as "The Public
Garden" and "Bip as a lion tamer."

Perhaps the most delightful (and
certainly the most famous) of

Marceau's characters is his alter-ego, the Chaplin-esque char-

acter Bip. The second half of the
show was entirely devoted to
Bip sketches, which are what
most of the audience had proba
bly come to see. Much like
Chaplin's "little tramp" charac
ter, Bip innocently and humor
ously stumbles through life and

has adventures that, as the program describes, "can be likened
to Don Quixote's struggle against the windmills of life." Bip
was definitely a joy to see in person.
What is perhaps the most amazing aspect of Marceau's per
formance is his age — at 76, he still keeps audiences laughing
and eagerly observing.
It is difficult to watch a mime performance, because mim
ing requires very active audience attention and astute percep
tion. There were several frustrating moments of the show that
were difficult to understand, and if you cannot figure out what
is going on from the start, it is easy to give up and wait until the
next sketch.
Marceau is so expressive, however, that even without a
grasp of the story, the audience can enjoy observing his facial
gestures, exquisite hand movements and articulately demon
strative body. I spent much of the performance wondering
how someone who is the same age as my grandmother could
be more agile and expressive than someone my age.
While the tickets are not priced for the starving student
(ranging from $30 to $45), Marceau's performance was price
less. After being forced to watch videotapes of his perfor
mances in drama classes for years, it was an amazingly differ
ent experience to see such a legend in person and up close.
