## Widespread Panic in San Francisco! An interview with guitarist and vocalist Michael Houser Music 
### Ryan Blitstein 
Athens, Ga., rockers Widespread Panic's hard-driving,
experimental sound has kept their grass-roots fan-base
excited for over 13 years. On tour to support their criti
cally acclaimed album, "'Til The Medicine Takes,"
Widespread rolls into San Francisco for a sold-out, three
night run at the Warfield Theater this Thursday, Friday
and Saturday, Oct. 14-16. Ever the baseball fanatic, lead
guitarist / vocalist Michael Houser was persuaded to turn
down the volume on the Atlanta Braves game for a chat.
Intermission: Thanks for talking with us, Mike. Unlike
many bands that get lumped together in the jam-band
category, you guys are famous for writing great songs.
Do you have a favorite Panic song? Is there a song that

you really like playing on
stage?

Michael liousen That is a pret
ty tough question. I think my
favorite song to play is proba
bly "Fishwater" because it's
mostly just a jam, but it's got a
good groove and I've always
enjoyed that one a lot. But I
have a new favorite song every
month.
I: Is there one you've written
that you are most proud of?
Mil: That's another tough
one. I really don't have one. I
enjoy writing songs, and I
enjoy playing the other guys'
songs. We've got everybody in
the band writing songs now.
It's fun to work on your own
music and it's fun to have other
people bring in songs, too.
We've got a good groove going
as far as our songwriting goes.
There's a lot of different influ
ences within the band, and it all
comes out in the songs.
I: Who were your personal in
fluences growing up?
Mil: I guess my first rock and
roll records were Deep Purple
— "Machine Head" — and
Edgar Winter — " They Only
Come Out at Night." I remem
ber buying those two records
when I was 15 or so, and I real
ly got into rock and roll at that
point. My favorite band was al
ways Yes, and after them, I lis
tened to a lot of Black Sab
bath. I learned a lot of guitar
listening to Black Sabbath
records.
I: You just played along?
Mil: That's how I learned to
play. I just played along with
records. I liked all the rock and
roll in the '70s. My influences
were all the great '60s and '70s
rock and rollers.

I: Is there anyone in particular that you tried to play like
early on?
MH: Well, I would always try to learn stuff off the
records. But then when you're making up your own
music, you're really on your own at that point. And I
don't think anybody goes very far in trying to play like
somebody else. You certainly learn from other people.

but then you have to try to come up with your own ideas.
I: I've read a few interviews in which you said that you
don't use scales or theory, that all of your playing is
strictly ear-based.
MH: I learned how to play off of records, so I never
learned scales on the guitar. The way I learned was by
the sort of patterns on the neck. I can sit down and play
a scale on the guitar, but I really have to think about it.
When we're playing on stage, the best thing that can
happen to you is to not be thinking. When I'm on stage,
I have a pattern on the guitar that I know where every
thing is. I don't play proper scales. It works out fine in a

band like ours, because we have our own sound that we
kind of go for. But I'd be in trouble somewhere else. I
just can't play anything besides Widespread Panic. We
learn some cover songs for Halloween and New Year's,
and I learn those songs, and I play 'em, but really I don't
know anything except what we do. And it's just that old
"learn-by-ear" thing as opposed to learning by the
books. You come out at the same place, because you

know what sounds good. Whether you learn by ear or
some other way, most people end up in the same place:
where it sounds good. That's really what I try to do; I try
to make each note sound good. I don't really worry
about whether it's in the right mode or the right key or
the right scale or anything like that. That probably
doesn't make much sense, [laughs]
I: It does make sense, especially in the context of the
way the band sounds. Even when you do covers, it
seems to sound like Widespread Panic, because of the
way the band approaches music. When did you say to
yourself, "I'm going to play music forever. This is what
I'm going to do with the rest of my life?"

IMH: I started playing guitar at 15 and then went to col
lege in Athens [at the University of Georgia] where I
met [lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Bell] in about 19K1.
We had a mutual friend who knew that we both played
guitar and hooked us up, and we started doing gigs
around 1982. JB had actually been doing solo shows
around Athens, for a long time before I even started

And so a priest and a rabbi walk into a bar...
playing with him. So we started doing solo stuff, and we
were both still in college. I got out of college in 1985,
and JB had moved into a house on the other side of
Athens. Once I got done with school, I got a job at
Domino's and moved in with him, and that's when it
pretty much all came together. [Bass player and vocal
ist] Dave [Schools] moved in shortly after that, and
[drummer] Todd [Nance] soon after that, so we were
all living in the same house. This was around 1985 or
'86, and I was doing job interviews because I'd gotten a
degree in chemistry. 1 was going to these chemical
plants, and it just made me sick going and thinking
about spending my life in those chemical factories. One
day I just didn't go to my next interview. That was the
turning point for me, when I gave up the crazy idea that
I was going to go to work in a chemical plant. After
that, everything else was pretty easy. You play the gigs
when the gigs come up and look for food and try to find
a place to sleep. Everything else sort of fell together
after that.
I: Whose idea was it to get out on the road, tour a little
bit and leave the Athens scene for a few days or weeks
at a time?
MH: JB was probably the first one to organize any
thing. He was the one who had it the most together out
of all of us. We were sort of living an underground ex
perience for a while. We didn't have a phone. We
didn't have water or electricity or anything. We were
just "out there." I think our first road trip was to Clem
son, which is only 60 miles away. We had enough intel
ligence to get that far. And we started going to Macon,
then Alabama, then Tennessee. We made a small circle
at first around Athens, then the next time we would
make a little bigger circle. It kept going after that, and
we're still doing it today. We're trying to make a circle
now that encompasses more than just the United
States.
I: Is JB still the one who does a lot of the organization
al stuff, or is it all managers who do it?
MH: We've got managers, and booking agents, and a
secretary, and a record company and all that stuff. But
we pretty much make decisions as a band. Somebody
will call us and say, "What do you think about this?"
And we'll say, "Some of us like it; some of us don't."
And if we have to, we'll vote on it. But usually we're all
in the same mindset as far as what sort of career deci
sions we have to make.
I: Do you ever get sick of life on the road, being out
there for so long?
MH: I think you get tired of being on the road, but it's
like anything else. You get tired of just about every
thing every now and then, but for us, this is our life re
ally. You can't just say, "Well, I don't wanna do that
anymore." Of course, any time you're pursuing some
thing, there are times when you wake up and you feel
horrible. But then, the show must go on, and we are the
show, so we have to do what we do. But for the most
part we love what we do. I'm in San Diego today, the
sun's shining and everything's cool.
I: Do you guys ever listen to your own shows?
MH: Well, only if we're working on a project. For in
stance, right now they want a song from a show we did
in Alabama to put on a compilation CD, so we have to
listen and pick a song. But for the most part, we don't
really just listen, not unless there's something that
we're listening for. Sometimes, somebody will say,
"That was a cool jam that we did," and we go back and
listen.
1: So you record all your shows?
MH: We record every night, 64 channels, digital. With

that, you can do anything. That's how we made our live
record.
I: Which really sounds great from a recording stand
point.
MH: Well, it's funny. We have this state-of-the-art
recording system, and we've always known that we
were going to make a live record. So we put audience
mikes out in front of the stage so we could get the am
biance of the room, in order to mix that in whenever we
did make a live record. It turned out that when we went
to mix the live record, those mics were very direction
al. All you could hear out of those mics was the three
people they were pointed at talking. We completely
lost the sound of the room, which if you don't include
that, it almost sounds like a studio record. So we had to
seek out some fans who recorded all the shows, and
they had to send in the songs that we were going to use
so we could take their ambiance and mix it in with the
live record. So it was really a cooperative effort be
tween us and the fans.
I: Do tapers ever send you recordings of your shows
and say, "Listen to this?"
MH: That's how we got the song "Fishwater." We did
a jam at a show at Cornell in Ithaca, NY. A friend sent
us a tape and said, "Listen to this jam." We put it on and
listened to it, and it was basically "Fishwater," and then
JB added the words.
I: Jamming and improvisation are a big part of your live
sound. Do you practice jamming before you get out on
tour?
MH: We don't practice jamming. I don't think you can.
Jamming is really improvisation, and if you practice it,
it's not improv anymore. We have things that we do,
and musical codes that we know, clues that we can send
out between each other in a jam. They're just sort of
signposts or whatever, but other than that, it's all free
for-all.
I: Is it usually one guy leading the jam, or everyone
doing their own thing and listening to the others?
MH: Well, it's everybody doing their thing, but at dif
ferent times it's different people that are in the fore
ground, but everybody else is still "there." And then
that person will come back into the mix, and somebody
else will come out into the foreground. It's sort of a fol
low-the-leader kind of thing, except we have a rotating
leader.
I: Do you think that having such a strong rhythm sec
tion and a bass-driven group changes the way you im
provise?
MH: Yeah. If you're comparing us to other bands, we
have a really heavy rhythm section, and it's obviously
what drives the band.
I: Is there a show you can think of where you reached
"nirvana" and thought, "Wow, I'm playing better than
I've ever played?"
MH: Well, like I said before, that's my favorite thing:
when you're not thinking. Every night that's what I
strive for, and I think everyone else in the band does as
well. It's that state where time seems to stand still, and
you wake up, and the set's over. You're basically un
conscious for a while. You hope to get there every
night, at least for a few minutes. But we've played thou
sands of shows, so we try to go out there and reach that
peak every night. And obviously some nights we climb
higher than others, and luckily we have an audience
who accepts that.
I: Do you guys get time to listen to music on the road?

MH: We've got some CDs out here. They always kid
me because the only music I listen to is 25 to 30 years
old. "Oh no, we're going back to the '705." Luckily,
they listen to newer music, so that's how I find out
what's "hip."
I: So, you're still listening to the same Deep Purple and
Black Sabbath albums from your teenage years?
MH: No, I don't really listen to — actually, I did bring
a Deep Purple CD out on the road this time, just for
fun. I still listen to Yes, though. And some Athens
bands like Bloodkin and White Buffalo. And Todd's
got a CD, this Steve Earle album, not the newest one,
but the one he put out about two years ago. Dave keeps
us up to date on the acid jazz and hip-hop.
I: Did you find it hard to reconcile your musical differ
ences, especially during the early period?
MH: We all grew up listening to that great rock and
roll. I know that Dave was really influenced by the
Dead. He saw a lot of Dead shows when he was grow
ing up, and JB had listened to the Dead. It all fit in to
gether pretty well. There's awkward moments trying to
reconcile styles sometimes, but I think that's part of the
beauty of it: putting stuff together that doesn't usually
go together.
I: Do you ever get a chance to see concerts?
MH: Well, we don't have a lot of time on the road, be
cause we're always playing five or six nights a week, so
we don't get to see a lot on the road. And then when
we're at home, we have stuff we do at home, too. I've
got a family, a wife and an 8-year-old boy, so when I'm
at home, I'm doing regular stuff. We like to go out to
shows, though. We just went to see Bloodkin in Athens
the other night, which was great.
I: You all still live in Athens?
MH: In or about, yes.
I: What do you think of the jam scene that's developed
during the past decade?
MH: I think it's great. I like bands that experiment on
stage. I don't really know too much about what's hap
pening on the jam scene right now. Obviously, Left
over Salmon and String Cheese Incident are out there,
and Government Mule. I'm happy about it. I realize
that not everybody's into improvisational jam music,
but that's what I like to see when I go to a show, people
getting out there and experimenting, as opposed to just
playing the record.
I: A lot of critics and tans are really excited about your
new album. How do you as a band feel it compares to
the others?
MH: We take each album very seriously, and we put
everything we have into the records. We're very excit
ed about it. We obviously experimented with "studio"
things more than usual. And we all love it; we were
hoping that everybody else would like it too. It is a lit
tle bit of a departure, but I don't think it's really radi
cal.
I: What was your goal for the album?
MH: What we were after was to do something new, but
still be Widespread Panic. We had a great time making
it. We're all happy about it, and happy that everybody
else is happy about it.
I: Well, thanks for talking with Intermission.
MH: Good luck, and we will see you at the Warfield.
