## Widespread Panic in San Francisco! An interview with guitarist and vocalist Michael Houser Music 
### Ryan Blitstein 
Athens, Ga., rockers Widespread Panic's hard-driving,
experimental sound has kept their grass-roots fan-base
excited for over 13 years. On tour to support their criti
cally acclaimed album, "'Til The Medicine Takes,"
Widespread rolls into San Francisco for a sold-out, three
night run at the Warfield Theater this Thursday, Friday
and Saturday, Oct. 14-16. Ever the baseball fanatic, lead
guitarist / vocalist Michael Houser was persuaded to turn
down the volume on the Atlanta Braves game for a chat.
Intermission: Thanks for talking with us, Mike. Unlike
many bands that get lumped together in the jam-band
category, you guys are famous for writing great songs.
Do you have a favorite Panic song? Is there a song that

you really like playing on
stage?

Michael liousen That is a pret
ty tough question. I think my
favorite song to play is proba
bly "Fishwater" because it's
mostly just a jam, but it's got a
good groove and I've always
enjoyed that one a lot. But I
have a new favorite song every
month.
I: Is there one you've written
that you are most proud of?
Mil: That's another tough
one. I really don't have one. I
enjoy writing songs, and I
enjoy playing the other guys'
songs. We've got everybody in
the band writing songs now.
It's fun to work on your own
music and it's fun to have other
people bring in songs, too.
We've got a good groove going
as far as our songwriting goes.
There's a lot of different influ
ences within the band, and it all
comes out in the songs.
I: Who were your personal in
fluences growing up?
Mil: I guess my first rock and
roll records were Deep Purple
— "Machine Head" — and
Edgar Winter — " They Only
Come Out at Night." I remem
ber buying those two records
when I was 15 or so, and I real
ly got into rock and roll at that
point. My favorite band was al
ways Yes, and after them, I lis
tened to a lot of Black Sab
bath. I learned a lot of guitar
listening to Black Sabbath
records.
I: You just played along?
Mil: That's how I learned to
play. I just played along with
records. I liked all the rock and
roll in the '70s. My influences
were all the great '60s and '70s
rock and rollers.

I: Is there anyone in particular that you tried to play like
early on?
MH: Well, I would always try to learn stuff off the
records. But then when you're making up your own
music, you're really on your own at that point. And I
don't think anybody goes very far in trying to play like
somebody else. You certainly learn from other people.

but then you have to try to come up with your own ideas.
I: I've read a few interviews in which you said that you
don't use scales or theory, that all of your playing is
strictly ear-based.
MH: I learned how to play off of records, so I never
learned scales on the guitar. The way I learned was by
the sort of patterns on the neck. I can sit down and play
a scale on the guitar, but I really have to think about it.
When we're playing on stage, the best thing that can
happen to you is to not be thinking. When I'm on stage,
I have a pattern on the guitar that I know where every
thing is. I don't play proper scales. It works out fine in a

band like ours, because we have our own sound that we
kind of go for. But I'd be in trouble somewhere else. I
just can't play anything besides Widespread Panic. We
learn some cover songs for Halloween and New Year's,
and I learn those songs, and I play 'em, but really I don't
know anything except what we do. And it's just that old
"learn-by-ear" thing as opposed to learning by the
books. You come out at the same place, because you

know what sounds good. Whether you learn by ear or
some other way, most people end up in the same place:
where it sounds good. That's really what I try to do; I try
to make each note sound good. I don't really worry
about whether it's in the right mode or the right key or
the right scale or anything like that. That probably
doesn't make much sense, [laughs]
I: It does make sense, especially in the context of the
way the band sounds. Even when you do covers, it
seems to sound like Widespread Panic, because of the
way the band approaches music. When did you say to
yourself, "I'm going to play music forever. This is what
I'm going to do with the rest of my life?"

IMH: I started playing guitar at 15 and then went to col
lege in Athens [at the University of Georgia] where I
met [lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Bell] in about 19K1.
We had a mutual friend who knew that we both played
guitar and hooked us up, and we started doing gigs
around 1982. JB had actually been doing solo shows
around Athens, for a long time before I even started
