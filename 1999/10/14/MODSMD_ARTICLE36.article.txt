## An interview with the Van Cliburn winner and Stanford graduate cover 
### David Arulanantham 
It's been a long time in the making, but seven years after
graduating from Stanford, pianist Jon Nakamatsu will be
performing at Dinkelspiel Auditorium this Sunday
evening. The perfomance is the Jirst in a series of three
Chopin Celebration Concerts to be held this year by Stan
ford Lively Arts. Nakamatsu, a Gold Medalist at the 1997
Van Cliburn competition and the first American to win
since 19X1, will be playing works by Bach, Chopin and
Field.
Though he has since received wide acclaim for his per
formances throughout the world, what makes his initial
success so intriguing is perhaps his lack of conservatory
training or a music degree. After he received his A.B. in
German studies in 1991, and an A.M. in Education the
following year, Nakamatsu had been working as a Ger
man teacher at St. Francis High School in Mountain View
until his victory in the competition. Intermission recently
spoke with Jon Nakamatsu to better understand how he
has arrived at this point and his thoughts as a pianist on
the music industry.
Intermission: Could you tell mc how you were first in
troduced to music and at what age?
Jon: I started formally when I was 6, with private piano
lessons. Prior to that, when 1 was four, I saw my first
piano at a pre-school — 1 don't come from a musical
family, so 1 wasn't exposed to classical music at home —
hut when my mother took me to the pre-school, I saw
this old, enormous run-down piano and was immediate
ly drawn to the sound and amazed at the instrument. I
really wanted to play, but my parents weren't quite
ready to invest in a piano for a 4-year-old, who might just
give it up a month later. So they gave me a little toy organ

which I had for two years, and when they noticed that I
was very interested even after that time and was able to
do a little bit more than the play-by-numbers books,
they said,"lf you take formal lessons, we'll buy the piano
and see where it goes."
1:1 know a problem with a lot of young people starting
out on the piano is that they don't like to practice. How
did you overcome that barrier and what drove your pas
sion in music, especially since you didn't come from a
very musical family?

JN: Well, that in itself [not coming from a musical fami
ly] was probably the reason why I kept up with it. It was
something that was uniquely mine, it wasn't something
that was being forced upon me, and actually, 1 had to
kind of fight for the right to do it in the beginning. My
parents were very supportive and really encouraged me
to do it if it made me happy — which it definitely did.
Even as a little kid, I really loved to play and I would
spend hours at the piano playing, but not always wanti
ng to practice. There's a difference between playing and
actually working on the things you're supposed to be
doing. I think that's a natural reaction for all children,
and my parents were careful to say, "You can play as
long as you like once you get your everything else done
first Do what the teacher says and make sure you
learn everything." That's really where the structure
comes in when dealing with the hardships of practice
and discipline. I knew that when I was very young, this
was what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. But lit
tle by little, my teacher made sure that I was exposed to
all the different aspects of the profession very early, in
cluding performances and competitions. I had a pretty
normal life. My parents, being non-musical, wanted me
to be grounded and educated, not just focused on music
for the rest of my life.
I: Were your parents, teachers or other adults surround
ing you concerned that you would suffer from the "child
prodigy phenomenon?" That is to say, the potentially
negative impacts of too much success at too early an
age?
JN: Absolutely, I think that's always one consideration
when you look at so many of those who are so focused

on things that are so esoteric. They get a distorted pic
ture of the world that has little or no basis in reality, and
that's the danger because I think the most interesting in
terpretations [of music] come from those who really un
derstand the human condition and are not just in their
own bubble. And my parents — as well as my teacher —
knew that education was going to help that a lot. It
wasn't going to give me everything, but it would give me
a more rounded view of the world. And 1 think having
grown up as a fairly regular kid like everybody else has
helped me not become this isolated "flash in the pan."
I: Who, if anyone, motivated you at that early stage?

JN: I definitely would say that it was my piano
teacher who really opened the door to this new
world that I had no idea about. It wasn't just what
we did at the piano, but it was a whole immersion in
music and something completely different than
what I did in school or what I experienced at
home — listening to records, going to concerts,
talking to other musicians and being able to express
yourself in that way. That alone is a great gift to dis
cover so early on in life, and it really motivated me
to want to do it for the rest of my life and eventual
ly share it with others.
I: When you were finishing up high school and get
ting ready to apply to college, did you consider ap
plying to a conservatory or a music school?
JN: We had considered going all the traditional
routes. In fact, we had talked to people in conser
vatories, a great many musicians, other students,
but ultimately what I found was that I had such a
great support system here. From my teacher who
was willing not only to give me the educational in
formation that 1 needed but also support me in
terms of almost being like a manager and an agent
and really backing me up and showing me the busi
ness and ultimately finding other people for me to
study with. When that happened, I decided that
maybe I don't have to go to a music school, maybe
I can get it elsewhere and then follow other inter
ests I have, which were academics and things that
were separate from what I did musically.
I: What made you choose Stanford and decide to
major in German Studies?

JN: When I got into Stanford, I was really excited and
thought "if I get in, it's the place for academics anyway."
It seems like I could do whatever I wanted to do, it didn't
have to just be music, it could be anything. But I really
felt the kind of liberating freedom that comes with the
territory. So I really had a wonderful time and ended up
choosing a language major because I felt that in a way it
would help me in terms of music as a career — you see
all these musicians who come speaking five or six differ
ent languages fluently, and we Americans speak just one
language. I also thought German would help broaden
my interpretive skills, especially with the Central Euro
pean composers and being able to read the literature
that inspired them would also give me a greater under
standing of their music.
I: Could you explain the effect that being able to under
stand German has had on your work as an artist?
JN: It's obvious that all art is inter-connected in some
way, and so much of what inspired the great composers
grew out of the thought of the time; it wasn't just that
they were good in music, they understood the kind of
movements that were happening in literature — for ex
ample, German romanticism had a great effect on
Beethoven and reading Gerger and this whole idea of
expression beyond the formulaic grew out of the notion
that was basically in literature and current thought. And
I think knowing that and being able to read those kinds
of things in the original language, being able to read
what the composer wrote himself and all the secondary
literature, a lot of which has not been translated into

English, gives a different perspective on musical inter
pretation. Being able to do that in any language, for any
culture, for any group of composers is really important.
It's not just learning how to play the piece.
I: What composer do you really enjoy playing and why?
JN: That's a hard question. The composer I'm playing at
the time has to become my favorite. I would not take
anything to the stage that I didn't feel a strong connec
tion to and for which I didn't think that I had a good,
solid message. And I think that at certain times there has

to be one composer that I'm really drawn to and at other
times somebody else. At this point, I could not see my
self focusing on one group of composers or even one
major period of composers. It's more for me a little bit of
everything; it has to be an eclectic mix for me to be real
ly comfortable.
I: Getting back to your life, how did you decide to pur
sue teaching after graduating from Stanford?
JN: I actually did the STEP [teacher training) program
here at Stanford. I took a couple of courses in the edu
cation department while still an undergrad and did some
work with high school and decided I might like to ex
plore that area because I got interested in language ac
quisition and then secondary language instruction. I first
interned and then ended up working at St. Francis High
School in Mountain View. It worked really well because
I needed the job in order to support myself, but the
school also let me go away to travel as they knew I was
pursuing a career in music and really needed time dur
ing the year to get away and compete and travel. As
much as they could, they let me go. In fact, I worked until
the day I entered the Van Cliburn competition.
I: Was it difficult to balance the two worlds (music and
teaching)?
JN: It was extremely hard. I think teaching is a full-time
profession in and of itself if you want to do it really well.

I was taking home stuff every single night. I was even
working summers to develop the coming year. When I
went away to perform and compete, I had all of my pa
pers in my suitcase to grade and to deal with. It was non
stop. 1 knew that 1 had a few years to try and establish
myself as a pianist through competitions, and this was
the only way I could do this to fund my performing.
I: I'd like to ask a question related to the selection of
your repertoire. As a musician in today's world, do you
constantly feel the tug between the artistic value of a
piece and its market or audience value? How do you rec
oncile these two conflicting pulls?

JN: Well, that's a great question. Even
within the classical world, you have a lot of
orchestras wanting you to play a
Beethoven concerto or a Rachmaninov
concerto because these are the works that
draw in the biggest audiences. 1 really think
the only way to reconcile that is to know
what you really play well first of all, to com
mit to not performing something about
which you don't have any strong convic
tions. If somebody asked me to play some
thing that I felt I couldn't do, or I didn't
have a lot to say about it, I wouldn't do it. If
they really want you to play it, they'll ask
you to play something else, and if they
don't, they'll go find somebody to play the
work that they need. You have to do some
thing you enjoy. I think of Beethoven or
Rachmaninov, but I really enjoy
Beethoven or Rachmaninov. I think it's
something that you have to want to do as
an artist yourself and make sure you have
something interesting to say about it. I
don't know how far you'll get, on the other
hand, if you are only going to play the Bach
concertos, for example. You might be
making a statement, and certainly you'll
have a specific audience, but it'll be more
and more difficult to get into the main
stream circuit of promoters who are asking
for a standard body of work.
I: Do you feel that the classical music in
dustry is driven more by business consider
ations than anything else?

JN: Absolutely, I think that is probably the

uglier side of the whole thing, that this is a busi
ness today. People have this perception of the classical
music industry as a wondrous, beautiful world where
everyone spends their time making music and walks out
on stage, and there's all this kind of grandeur— that is
the farthest possible picture from the truth. When it
comes down to it, this is a business, and there are so
many people trying to do it, and certain people make it
for certain reasons. At the point I won the competition,
I had looked at all kinds of ways to break into the busi
ness. I had talked to different managers who had heard
me play, who met with me, spoke with me at length and
eventually said, "You know the sad part about this is
that it doesn't matter how you play — it only matters if
you can sell the house." And if you do, the people will
engage you, and if you don't, they won't. That doesn't
speak for your talent or your work ethic or how much
you have to say necessarily. The proof is that I am the
same pianist that I was two days before I won the award;
however, two days before I won the award, I would not
have had 1 (X) conceits in a year, and two days after, I did.
I: After having won the Gold Medal at the Van Cliburn
competition in 1997, what are your plans for the future?
Will you be returning to St. Francis at all?
JN: I plan on continuing to tour and pursue a profes
sional career in music. I won't be returning to my teach
ing job.
