## An interview with the Van Cliburn winner and Stanford graduate cover 
### David Arulanantham 
It's been a long time in the making, but seven years after
graduating from Stanford, pianist Jon Nakamatsu will be
performing at Dinkelspiel Auditorium this Sunday
evening. The perfomance is the Jirst in a series of three
Chopin Celebration Concerts to be held this year by Stan
ford Lively Arts. Nakamatsu, a Gold Medalist at the 1997
Van Cliburn competition and the first American to win
since 19X1, will be playing works by Bach, Chopin and
Field.
Though he has since received wide acclaim for his per
formances throughout the world, what makes his initial
success so intriguing is perhaps his lack of conservatory
training or a music degree. After he received his A.B. in
German studies in 1991, and an A.M. in Education the
following year, Nakamatsu had been working as a Ger
man teacher at St. Francis High School in Mountain View
until his victory in the competition. Intermission recently
spoke with Jon Nakamatsu to better understand how he
has arrived at this point and his thoughts as a pianist on
the music industry.
Intermission: Could you tell mc how you were first in
troduced to music and at what age?
Jon: I started formally when I was 6, with private piano
lessons. Prior to that, when 1 was four, I saw my first
piano at a pre-school — 1 don't come from a musical
family, so 1 wasn't exposed to classical music at home —
hut when my mother took me to the pre-school, I saw
this old, enormous run-down piano and was immediate
ly drawn to the sound and amazed at the instrument. I
really wanted to play, but my parents weren't quite
ready to invest in a piano for a 4-year-old, who might just
give it up a month later. So they gave me a little toy organ

which I had for two years, and when they noticed that I
was very interested even after that time and was able to
do a little bit more than the play-by-numbers books,
they said,"lf you take formal lessons, we'll buy the piano
and see where it goes."
1:1 know a problem with a lot of young people starting
out on the piano is that they don't like to practice. How
did you overcome that barrier and what drove your pas
sion in music, especially since you didn't come from a
very musical family?

JN: Well, that in itself [not coming from a musical fami
ly] was probably the reason why I kept up with it. It was
something that was uniquely mine, it wasn't something
that was being forced upon me, and actually, 1 had to
kind of fight for the right to do it in the beginning. My
parents were very supportive and really encouraged me
to do it if it made me happy — which it definitely did.
Even as a little kid, I really loved to play and I would
spend hours at the piano playing, but not always wanti
ng to practice. There's a difference between playing and
actually working on the things you're supposed to be
doing. I think that's a natural reaction for all children,
and my parents were careful to say, "You can play as
long as you like once you get your everything else done
first Do what the teacher says and make sure you
learn everything." That's really where the structure
comes in when dealing with the hardships of practice
and discipline. I knew that when I was very young, this
was what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. But lit
tle by little, my teacher made sure that I was exposed to
all the different aspects of the profession very early, in
cluding performances and competitions. I had a pretty
normal life. My parents, being non-musical, wanted me
to be grounded and educated, not just focused on music
for the rest of my life.
I: Were your parents, teachers or other adults surround
ing you concerned that you would suffer from the "child
prodigy phenomenon?" That is to say, the potentially
negative impacts of too much success at too early an
age?
JN: Absolutely, I think that's always one consideration
when you look at so many of those who are so focused
