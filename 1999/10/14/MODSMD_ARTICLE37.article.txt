## 'Stan and Judy's Kid' 
### 
Adam Sandler's new album,
"Stan and Judy's Kid," is al
most a manifesto of every
thing that is wrong with the world
today. This is apparent even from the
cover — with its parental advisory
warning and depiction of Adam San
dler with clenched fists.
And this album is certainly an
epitome of the low-brow, toilet-trash
humor that has become increasingly
popular today. There are 11 skits with
new characters and six songs, more
than 9() percent of which contain ei
ther curse words or jokes about a cer
tain part of the male anatomy.
For example, during a skit called
"Cool Guy," a man named Shawn
finds himself in a variety of compro
mising positions after calling his
member a variety of ridiculous
names. These names — which in
clude jammer jam, pud, wet weiner,
tallywacker and sweetmeat — earn
him laughs and abrupt exits from the
girls whom he takes home. At one
point, a sex phone operator hangs up
on him after laughing at him with the
other operators.
This preoccupation does not end
with the skits, as evidenced by the
song "7-foot man," on which the
punchline is that the seven-foot man
has a seven-foot thing.
Almost everything that does not
deal with sex or human anatomy re
lies on either gruesome images or the
actions of perverts ("The Peeper") to

squeeze out laughs from the audience.
You find yourself cracking up at
some of the dirty jokes, but for the
most part they are overdone. Adam
Sandler is definitely the master of toi
let humor. However, it often seems as
if he is cursing just for the sake of it or
because he is expected to, which de
tracts from the album's funniness.
Further, Sandler's over-reliance on
offensive humor seems counterintu
itive. Consider that Sandler's largest
musical hit was the immensely popu
lar "Chanukah Song," which contains
not one profane word but plenty of
singular, libelous declarations. Need
less to say, the follow-up, "Chanukah
Part II," is the funniest song on the
album.
The bottom line is that while those
who require extremely offensive
humor will be more than pleased with
"Stan and Judy's Kid," the rest of us
will just have to pass.
