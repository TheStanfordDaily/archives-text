# 'Industrial Strength Machine Music'
## various artists 
### 
Rhino records has released its latest "his
torical compilation" or "genre chronicle,"
this time researching industrial rock. The
release begins with the nihilistic experimentation
of Throbbing Gristle and concludes with the emo
tionally dark, electronic and eventually main
stream sound of Nine Inch Nails.
"Industrial Strength Machine Music" un
doubtedly presents the legendary artists and
tracks contributing to the development of the in
dustrial genre. The album ranges from the more
avant-industrial experimental leanings of artists
such as Non, Coil and Einsturzende Neubauten to
the heavier, dancier programmed beats akin to
My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult and the Revolt
ing Cocks. Industrial favorites such as Clock
DVA's "The Hacker" and Skinny Puppy's "Dig
It" also contribute to this collection of integral in
dustrial tracks.
The album is certainly a collection of the
greats, a nice mix of hits for any industrial enthu

siast. Yet it also presents the earlier, more inac
cessible bands to those listeners unfamiliar with
industrial's roots. The insert also provides a de
cent chronology, citing figures such as Genesis P-
Orridge, Chris Carter and Rhys Fulber, who
evolved the industrial sound. These artists knew
how to harness the power of imploding factories
and develop their politics amidst dark sonic waste
lands.
The tracks chosen to represent the '90s may be
the only potential weakness of the album, al
though they do expose the more cyber-guitar.
techno-related sound found later in the decade.
For the most part, "Industrial Strength Ma
chine Music" is a solid overview of industrial evo
lution and progression over time, including some
unreleased material and live edits. So if you
thought industrial started with Marilyn Manson,
listen and think again.
