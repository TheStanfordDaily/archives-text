# 'Amen'
## The
						Paula Cole Band Music 
### 
Paula Cole isn't the type of artist that the
critically elite will fall for. Precious and
precocious, her music is an easy target
for cynics and for those who took her first
hit — the tongue-in-cheek "Where Have All
the Cowboys Gone?" — at face value.
However, there is a simple power to her
music that has attracted many fans of female
singer-songwriters. Through several years of
touring, she rode on the coattails of Sarah
McLachlan and others. Ultimately, she rose
into the upper echelon, and her popularity is
now in the same league with former mentor
McLachlan and contemporary Jewel.
Like Jewel, the very adolescence of her
music explains her mass appeal, from the
MTV / Dawson's Creek crowd on up. Both de
buted in 1994 but only broke through two
years later after excessive touring and word
of-mouth. Now, in 1999, each has served up an
album of unexpected and unabashed social
and religious reflection — Jewel's "Spirit" and
Cole's "Amen."
With "Amen," Cole's singing style has mel
lowed out a bit. However, that's the least of the
changes on this album, which is a topical and
musical departure from her previous work.
The previous albums did not foreshadow the
lush strings, hip-hop beats and general

rhythm-and-blues feel to "Amen." Guests in
clude Gang Starr's DJ Premier and Tionne "T-
Boz" Watkins of TLC, and Cole even does her
own rapping on "Rhythm of Life."
The results aren't a train wreck, but they
aren't as inspiring as they should be. The senti
mentality, audaciousness and awkwardness of
much of her previous albums' lyrics remain on
the new album. In fact, if you cringed at "This
Fire," stay away from "Amen." The ideas she
espouses are admirable — love each other, be
thankful — but they've been said more elo
quently by countless others.
Still, some songs ring true; Cole has always
been better at introspection than observation
and social criticism, as songs such as "Pearl"
prove. Her self-production is, the second time
around, still above par, but the album is a bit
skimpy, having only nine songs, some of which
could be made shorter.
Despite all its faults, the album has its mo
ments, and Cole's guileless and powerful de
livery transforms even the most trite lyrics into
beautiful songs. Further, "Amen" does not
shake my belief in Paula Cole as one of the bet
ter artists in popular music today, nor does it
diminish my interest in what she'll do next.
