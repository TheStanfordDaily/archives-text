# Stanford, Yale join forces for law program
## 
### Roger Kim 
Thanks to a new joint program established by
Stanford and Yale Law Schools, young legal
academies can now interact with leading schol
ars in the field.
The Stanford / Yale Junior Faculty Forum
aims to encourage scholarly interchange and
conversation between veteran and newly-hired
law faculty.
The program was developed collaboratively
between Stanford Law Prof. Ron Gilson and
Yale Law Prof. Alan Schwartz.
The professors, who are friends, will serve as
directors.
■ "We both recognized the need and thought
that a joint venture of the two schools, one on ei
ther coast, made a great deal of sense," said
Gjlson.
»'* Schwart/ said the forum was developed out
of "the belief that a lot of schools don't provide
sufficient time and interest to their younger law

scholars. Many [scholars] must go through sell
learning, which takes a long time."
Through paper presentations and seminar
discussions, the forum will provide young facul
ty with constructive criticism and a sense of
mentorship from the senior faculty.
The forum will be held annually and will al
ternate between the Stanford and Yale campus
es. The inaugural forum will be held at Yale next
May.
Each session will focus on a different topic,
alternating between public law one year and pri
vate and dispute-resolution law the next.
Law professors within their first seven years
of teaching at schools around the country will be
invited to submit papers. Each year, six to nine
papers will be chosen by a blind jury of leading
scholars in the field.
Gilson said the two-day forum will emphasize
"commentary on the papers by senior scholars
and the opportunity for the sustained exchange
between the presenter and the audience."

I hc selection committee will be chosen next
week and submissions will be accepted through
December. Papers will be chosen between Feb
ruary and March.
" I he project grows out of a recognition of the
paucity of institutions that help young legal aca
demics learn what it means to do serious schol
arship." (iilson said.
"New faculty at elite law schools have the
benefit of guidance Ironi senior faculty ... but
the great majority ol young legal academics who
begin their careers at schools with tewer re
sources. lack these opportunities. I he torum is
designed to take a step in filling this void," he
added.
Law School Dean Kathleen Sullivan de
scribed the program as "an innovative tirst in
legal education, a great credit to (iilson and
Schwartz."
Tony kronman. Dean ol Yale Law School, is
also enthusiastic ahout the pro
gram.
" This is a new venture for both
schools involved, and it is motivat
ed by the belief that it can and
should be done," he said.
"Stanford and Yale Law
Schools are similar in that they
have very scholarly faculty who ac

tually teach and write.... There is
a lot of mutual respect between the
two schools," Schwartz said.
Gilson has spent time at Yale
and Schwartz at Stanford. This is
the first formal collaboration be
tween the two schools.
