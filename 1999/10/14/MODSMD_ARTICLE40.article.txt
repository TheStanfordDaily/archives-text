## THIS IS ONE TESTOSTERONE-LADEN CLUB YOU HAVE TO JOIN FIGHT CLUB 
### 
There's a scene in "Fight Club"in which Edward Norton literally beats "Angel
Face" Jared Leto to a bloody pulp. We watch as blood sprays all over Norton's
bare chest, and then we're treated to a horrifying close-up of Leto's smashed
up nose and teeth.
"Fight Club" is a movie that revolves around fistfights, and there are some mo
ments where the violence gets so intense that you start reeling from the punches. On
the other hand, it spins some terrific plot and character yarns that will leave you won
dering and talking.
Norton portrays the movie's nameless narrator, a dried-up corporate drone who
suffers from insomnia and pre-mid-life despair. His misery over his dead-end life

"As appealing as Pitt may be to the
ladies, he ain't so pretty when his
face looks like mashed potatoes with
gravy, so this isn't what you'd call a
date movie."

a trail of fight clubs across the country, things really get interesting.
The plot, when summarized, seems too weird to be successful. But it's presented in
such a whirlwind manner that the audience has no choice but to follow along. Director
David Fincher is particularly good with frenetic plots; he gave us similarly disturbing
thrill rides in "Seven" and"The Game." Fincher's films tend to have a darkness and
unyielding brutality that are involved with a deeper meaning, and "Fight Club" is no
exception.
The only problem is that much of this movie's punch-till-you-bleed brand of vio
lence does nothing to advance the story or entertain the audience. There was a point
toward the middle of the movie where I was becoming bored and sickened by the
fights.
People should also understand that "Fight Club" is most certainly a man's movie.
Things are way too brutal and confusing for children, and women might find the sub
ject matter appalling. There's only one supporting female role — Durden's tweaked
out lover Maria (Helena Bonham Carter) — and she only shows up to move the plot
along and make animalistic noises during sex.
And as appealing as Pitt may be to the ladies, he ain't so pretty when his face looks
like mashed potatoes with gravy, so this isn't what you'd call a date movie. • •• • v

Increasing numbers of people get caught up in
the club and Durden's prophetic outlook on society.
Durden forms an army, sending people out on missions
of general mischief. Meanwhile, Norton's character be

rection things are taking. Then Durden disappears, and as Norton's character follows
