# PITT, NORTON AND LETO HEADLINE THIS GRITTY DRAMA

So why, in light of all the blood and pain, would I recommend this movie? Well,
for one, Durden's seemingly maniacal exploits actually serve as good social com
mentary on materialism and self-motivation.
But what really got me was the great job that the director, writers (Jim Uhls,
adapting a novel by Chuck Palahniuk) and actors did in laying a current of psycho
logical complexity beneath the straight-and-simple story. The characters are sharp
and unpredictable, and even though the plot is wrapped up cleanly at the end,
you're left with a few puzzles that won't besolved until you play the earlier scenes
back in your head ... or watch the movie again. Like Fincher's previous movies,
"Fight Club" is one of those movies you won't see the same way during a second
viewing.
