Rated R

The way in which
they do this — in the con
text of their professional,
personal and romantic
lives — is the subject of
this film. The congress
woman, Kay Chandler
(Kristin Scott Thomas),
would just as soon forget

about it. She wants to move on to her new life and shel
ter her daughter, her political campaign and herself from
the implications of what is now only a memory.

Contrarily, Dutch Van Den Broeck (Harrison Ford)
obsesses over the fact that what he thought was a perfect
marriage has been revealed as a facade. An investigator
in Internal Affairs, he scarcely believes he could notice
nothing indicating his wife's straying. He goes on a per
sonal investigation to find out exactly what happened, to
determine exactly what his life with his wife actually was.
This starts to affect how he does his work, which
could have adverse results for his well-being, not to men
tion the safety of those he protects and investigates. This
subplot reveals more about Dutch, but it neither adds to
nor detracts from the movie.
Kay steadfastly refuses Dutch's attempts to bring her
along on his investigation — at first. She eventually ac
quiesces to follow him around, but she never becomes as
obsessed. The portrayal of Kay as a woman who repeat
edly says "no" then eventually says "yes" is rather trite,
and it's the best early indication that "Random Hearts"
may not be all that it's cracked up to be.
If you've seen the previews (which pretty much tell

the story) you know that Kay and Dutch eventually be
come romantically involved. This development — two
shattered souls finding each other when they need to —
is a promising subject, one previously explored in 1988's
superb "The Accidental Tourist." In "Random Hearts,"
it is not handled in a paint-by-the-numbers fashion, but
other parts of the movie are. Thus, the overall story
makes it difficult to sustain our caring about the main
characters through to the end.
During "Random Hearts," however, there are many
insights about the world of extramarital affairs, how the
other spouses deal with them and how politicians must
handle their personal lives in the late '90s. It is a decent
character study, but the film is neither satisfying nor rev
elatory. It is good enough to sustain interest to the end;
unlike many movies, in this one, I didn't look at my
watch until the last scene ended. But that's not enough
to recommend it.
