# 'Superstar' tries too hard to shine: Snl skit joins backlog of flops
## 
### 
You'd think that by now "Saturday Night Live" producer
Lome Michaels would have figured out that turning five
minute sketches into big screen comedies doesn't quite
work. For every successful "Wayne's World," there's a series of flops
such as "It's Pat!," "Coneheads," "Stuart Saves His Family" or
worse — "A Night at the Roxbury." And "Superstar," Molly Shan
non's film vehicle for the awkward and irresistibly funny Catholic
schoolgirl Mary Catherine Gallagher, is no exception.

'Superstar'
Molly Shannon
Will Ferrell
82 minutes
Rated PG-13

The mess of lines called a
screenplay here by Steven Wayne
Koren begs an audience to swallow this
plot: Mary wants a kiss. But not just any
kiss. She wants a big-time Holywood
screen kiss as an extra in a film with
strong moral values.
When "Catholic Teen Maga-

zine" comes to her school with a talent contest to help fight venere
al disease and the promise of that extra role, Mary gets excited. Not
to mention nervous — which of course makes her stick her hands
under her armpits and sniff.
Will Ferrell plays Mary's crush, an egotistical dance maniac
named Sky Corrigan who's dating the bratty Evian (Elaine Hen
drix). After Mary is caught making out with a tree near the school
(for practice), she is sent to special ed, where she meets her new spas
tic best friend, Helen (Emmy Laybourne). Together they are deter
mined to win the talent show, fight VD and break into Hollywood.
Parts of the film do have their moments. Mary, for instance, is a
rewind girl at a local video store, where she studies "Made for Tele-

vision" films during work. When she quotes from them at in-

appropriate times (such as in confession), the results are

hilarious. There's also a riotously funny bit where

Helen and Mary dream they're supermodels in a
r l_ • I A. J ! V T 1 . ft A

fashion documentary during mass. Nods to films
such as "Carrie," "Armageddon" and"The Boy l

in the Plastic Bubble" are nice touches as well.
At home with her grandmother (Glynis

Johns), Mary studies etiquette records and en
courages her breasts to grow in the mirror. We

learn about Mary's intimate feelings through
voice-over, a misplaced touch that feels more

like Molly Shannon than her eccentric char
acter. There's also only so many times Mary

can fall over and sniff her armpits.
Mary has repeated attributes that we find

funny in "SNL" segments, but in a movie, it's
dangerously unfulfilling not to have fleshed-

out development of a lead character — even
in broad comedy of this sort.

Shannon is, no doubt, a rising talent. It's sim- u
ply ridiculous to assume that her sketches that al- \
ready feel a bit too long could possibly sustain 82

minutes. Please, Mr. Michaels, for the love of God, N
spare us a Will Ferrell / Cheri Oteri cheerleader flick.
It won't work. I promise.
