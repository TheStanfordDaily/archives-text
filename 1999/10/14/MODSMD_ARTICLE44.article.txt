Gimmicky movies such as
"Happy, Texas" can go one of
three ways. No. 1: The gimmick

and touching. No. 2: The gimmick is ab-

hored, and the
movie bombs. No.
3: The gimmick
works, but the
sense of con
trivance never real
ly disappears.

"Happy, Texas" falls under door No.
3 primarily because the small-town card
is played a bit too often. But laughs are
abundant in this story about a couple of
escaped convicts disguised as gay beauty
pageant operators.

Steve Zahn, previously seen in "Out
of Sight" and "SubUrbia," picked up a
Special Jury Award at the Sundance Film
Festival for his inspired comedic acting in
"Happy, Texas." As Wayne Wayne
Wayne Jr., Zahn has to perform ballet
maneuvers as if he were Baryshnikov.
The character name is a tad ridiculous,
but Zahn makes the situational comedy
often work better than expected.
Jeremy Northam is the other partner
in crime. Northam's Harry Sawyer is the
flip side to the George Hanson character
in"The Object of My Affection." Harry
must also play the part of pageant direc
tor, and his feelings for a local woman are
played off as merely "girlfriend talks."
All this being said, there are some

problems. "Happy, Texas" takes a while
to get started with the comedy — expect
ing a bizarre comedy, I was initially hit
with an extended action sequence and
then a meandering introduction to all the
important citizens.
Another issue comes from the atmos
phere of Happy as a town. Characteriza
tions of its ignorance of accepted norms,
its apparent tolerance of a gay couple,
and its knack for being wide-eyed and
stupid don't always fit well with the
movie. For example, a sequence involv
ing a live auction concludes with a char
acter bidding on his own giant tires. Is
that supposed to be funny?
One notable side character is Sheriff
Chappy Dent, played with empathy by

William H. Macy. Macy has excelled in
challenging roles as a sorry used car
salesman in "Fargo" and as a traditional
father in "Pleasantville." Here, Macy has
the difficult task of balancing his own
personal battles with those of being the
town's lone law enforcement officer.
To be fair, "Happy, Texas" is, indeed,
a happy movie. It's really hard to hate
such clean and carefree characters. But
ultimately, this is only a floating bauble, a
whim which will disappear from memory
in a few days (or hours). The low-budget
"Happy, Texas" makes for a fun and
light-hearted outing — just don't go ex
pecting this to be the comedy of the year.
