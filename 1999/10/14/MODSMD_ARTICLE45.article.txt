## An Orgasmic Performance: A Woman's Guide to Faking It 
### Roxy Sass Staff writer 
Miss Sass knows that most of her sexually active female readers periodically fake
orgasms, and that most of her sexually active male readers have slept with women who
have faked orgasms.
For a variety of reasons, women fake orgasms much more often than men. For a
man, faking it entails simulating ejaculation, a more or less impossible feat. Because
women have no such telltale signs of orgasm, they can give phenomenally believable
performances, right down to the vaginal contractions. In addition, women are much
more likely to experience anorgasmia during sexual activity, so they confront this op
tion more often.
Over 70 percent of women will fake an orgasm at least once. These women cite
many reasons for simulating ecstasy. Most commonly, a woman believes that her part
ner will feel unfulfilled if she doesn't orgasm, so she generously fakes one to enhance
his sexual experience. She may also resort to dramatics to valiantly protect his ego or,
on non-erotic nights, to simply end the encounter quickly.
In all cases, the woman believes that her performance benefits either herself or her
partner. Ironically, she is usually wrong. First of all, if he believes her, he will continue
doing what he has been doing instead of adapting his sexual style to meet her needs.
Consequently, he will never fulfill her sexually. And chances are that if he discovers her
charade, he will feel deceived and deeply hurt.
In a recent study, 14 percent of men said they would feel inadequate if their partner
faked an orgasm, and another 33 percent would feel bad about themselves. A whop
ping 92 percent said that they would not want their partner to fake an orgasm under
any circumstances.
When a woman fakes it, she undermines the trust that necessarily must exist in a
healthy relationship. She never fully explores her body sexually and she never learns
to enjoy anorgasmic sex, a useful skill considering that most women don't orgasm
every time. If she has sexual problems, she never solves them. If her partner is inept or
simply doesn't have a feel for her body, he never improves. And he and she never share
earth-shattering sex.
Now, that said. Miss Sass knows that most women occasionally find themselves in
situations where faking an orgasm really seems like the best option. Such a decision is
personal and every woman must decide for herself when a fake orgasm is better than
no orgasm. Hut if she chooses to fake it, she'd better do it right.
For a woman to put on a truly orgasmic performance, she must understand what her
body does when it orgasms. Every woman's body is different, so ideally, every woman
should masturbate and then study her own orgasmic responses.
However, there are basic sexual phases that all women go through, some that can
be faked and others that a man won't notice.
When a woman becomes excited, blood flows to the pelvic region and vaginal lu
brication begins. The vagina expands and lengthens, and the outer lips, inner lips, cli
toris and sometimes the breasts become swollen or enlarged.
As she nears orgasm, her vaginal lips continue to swell and her breathing and pulse
rate quicken. When she finally climaxes, her vaginal walls contract rhythmically at ap
proximately 0.8-second intervals. Orgasmic contractions in the uterus occur simulta
neously but are less distinct and more irregular. In addition, her skin temperature rises,
and her heart rate peaks to between l(X)and 180 beats per minute. Her respiratory rate
rises to about 40 breaths per minute, and her breathing becomes irregular.
A woman orgasms for 13 to 51 seconds, though she may feel that the orgasm lasts
up to nearly two minutes. As her orgasm subsides, her contractions lose strength and
regularity. She may descend from her orgasm rapidly or gradually. As she does so, her
muscles relax and her vital signs return to normal. Swollen tissues resume their normal
size and appearance and the sexual Hush disappears.

And the curtain descends on a spectacu
lar performance.
Miss Sass pities her male readers who are
wondering in horror how they will ever
know whether their lady fair is indeed in
the throes of passion. A good actress is in
credibly convincing. So men, the best way
to know is to ask. If you suspect that she's
performing, choose a quiet, intimate mo
ment and ask her. Be gentle and compas
sionate because you are asking her to con
fess a deeply guarded secret.
For a man and woman to share a sexual
ly wholesome relationship, her orgasms
need to be as real as his, and neither part
ner should settle for anything less.
