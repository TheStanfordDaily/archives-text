It seems only fair that a random sample of the diners at Higashi West be
represented alongside our own opinion of the restaurant.
Q & A with a Higashi West diner
Intermission: Why did you choose Higashi West? Was it the exotic decor re
splendent with giant plastic bamboo columns (installed down the middle of

the room)? Or was the main draw actually the
food, an advertised blend of European / Asian
Cuisine and Sushi Bar?
Diner: Hi there, little ladies. I work for CYBLON,
the only joint manufacturer of cordless vacuums
and children's war-themed video games in the

Higashi West
636 Emerson Street.

county. This our vice-chair, here in the khakis.
I: (repeated) So, why did you choose Higashi West?
I): (struggling) Here's a business card. One for each of you.
I: When you were reading through the menu, what struck you as the most ex
emplary combination of the Euro-Asian cuisine? The San Francisco Niner
Roll or the Carpaccio Roll (a seared Angus New York steak rolled with
shiso, garlic and kaiware, served with Japanese salsa)?
D: Well, we're technology professionals, but in this day and age, even the
more common man — say a man who likes football — can be decked out in
a polo shirt with the company cyber-logo and a couple of sturdy, white Spald
ing tennis shoes. Don't you go and think we don't know about sports! Per
sonally, I love the Niners.
I: What did you have for dinner?
D: 1 had the Roasted Sake Chicken, and my partner in crime had the Pork
Chop.
Now here's a breakdown of the Wendy and Shirley dining experience ...
Step One — Enter Higashi West and ponder over the menu
Step Two — Order dinner
Step Three — Skip dessert
Step Four — Walk out of Higashi West and discuss the dinner:
"So Wendy, what did you think about the food?"
"I'd rather have eaten glass. What did you think about the ambiance?"
"Well, I kept getting kind of headachy because it was really loud. And I
kept getting confused by the dry-wall waterfall and the people around me. I
felt like 1 was at an office Christmas party, but then 1 saw sushi in front of me,
and I thought, maybe they don't have sushi at Christmas."
"Shirley, off the top of your head, pick three of the possible inspirations
for the owners of Higashi West. Was it the success of other "California
combo cuisine" establishments such as Spago? The new money and unedu
cated tastes of up-and-coming Silicon Valley professionals? The enthusiasm
portrayed in the 198()'s cross-cultural comedy smash, 'Gung Ho?"'
"Does it really matter, Wendy? What really matters is that, as a vegetari
an, this place lacked equally attractive non-meat options for me. But what's
worse is that the place was tacky, and the vegetarian rolls were sad dinner
fare — neither innovative nor exquisitely traditional."
"Yes, I agree on all counts — I can't believe that they had the audacity to
take a pile of poorly-cooked spinach, squish it into a ball, put a little rice
around it and call that 'sushi!' Thanks a lot, Higashi West!"
And a final thought from the both of us regarding Higashi West —
"Don't bother." Because, from the options on the Susty, Cold "Tsunami"
and Hot "Tsunami" menus, you can fill up on a meal and drink for $15 to $30.
But, whether your tastes draw you to the Caesar salad, the Wasabi Whipped
Potatoes or to the E.L.T. roll (grilled eel, lettuce, tomato, avocado and cream
cheese topped with special sauce), you're sure to leave either unsatisfied or
worse, unaware of having had a tragic dinner.
