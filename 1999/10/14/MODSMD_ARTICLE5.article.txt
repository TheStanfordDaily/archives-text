# Planners raise new questions
## Conflict continues over Land Use Plan 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
Members of the Palo Alto Plan
ning Commission met last night to
discuss Stanford's draft community
Land Use Plan.
While the draft plan continues to
cause controversy within the com
munity, last night's proceedings fo
cused on clarifying the connection
between the draft plan and Stan
ford's General Use Permit.
Several city commissioners ques
tioned whether the community plan
would be legally binding. According
to Santa Clara County Planning Of
fice official Sarah Jones, the General
Use Permit, which will govern the
management of all of Stanford's
land, must be in line with the content
of the community plan.
Jones compared Stanford's land
use policies in the l%()s. when devel
opment was generally governed by
blanket permits, with the numerous
zoning requirements required bv
current procedures.
Currently, all Stanford land is

zoned as A-l, which means that a
permit is required for development.
According to Jones, however, there
is a strong likelihood that new zoning
districts will be created at Stanford,
and each will require a separate per
mit.
The meeting, attended by ap
proximately 20 individuals, followed
Tuesday evening's public hearing, in
which members of the community
expressed their opinions on aspects
of the plan ranging from manage
ment of open space to transportation
and parking problems.
The planning commission direct
ed specific inquiries about the com
munity plan, particularly in the area
of housing, toward Stanford officials.
"We don't believe that we are
solving the regional housing prob
lem," said Larry Horton. director of
Government and Community Rela
tions for Stanford. "We believe we
are making a contribution [to the so
lution]."
Horton reviewed Stanford's cur
rent housing situation, providing in
formation on the housing shortage
for graduate students and post-doc
toral fellows. Over 1 .(KK) graduate
students and approximately 1.2(H)
post doctoral fellows were not able
to obtain on-campus housing this
year, according to I lorton.
Commissioners questioned
whether new development could
locus on higher-story housing facili
ties and buildings. Norton respond
ed that constructing low-rise housing
was the cheapest option.
Another significant issue for the
Planning Commission was the po
tential to locate a new Palo Alto
middle school on Stanford land. ('it
ing both demographic trends and the

large proportion of children in the
district who reside on campus. Com
missioner Jon Schink said that Palo
Alto has "made a very compelling
case" for building a new junior high
school for the city on the University
campus..
The planning commission contin
ued to voice concerns about preser
vation of open space. Several com
missioners felt that the provision for
no new development in the foothills
for 10 years should be extended to at
least 20 years.
"The 1.7 million new square feet
[of proposed development for hous
ing and academic facilities] seems
like an unsustainable rate of expan
sion," said senior Marisha Banister,
an Earth Systems major in atten
dance. "Stanford needs to deal with
growth and urban sprawl in the long
term."
