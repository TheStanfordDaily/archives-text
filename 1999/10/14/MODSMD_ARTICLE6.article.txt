### Ben Alexander-Bloch 
An armed robber entered the
Wells Fargo Bank adjacent to the
Stanford Shopping Center last Satur
day morning, taking a Stanford pro
lessor hostage before he lied, accord
ing to an anonymous eyewitness.
Stanford Police describe the sus
pect. who is still at large, as a 5-foot
l()-inch, white male.
At approximately 9 a.m.. he en
tered the bank and walked up to a
teller, a Stanford freshman. The sus
pect then allegedly took a Stanford
professor hostage before taking off in
his getaway car, according to the eye
witness.
The teller, after being held at gun
point, ran after the assailant's car to
record the license plate number. But
the vehicle, a dark blue hatchback,
was unmarked.
Ron Watson, an investigative
agent with the Stanford police, said
the assailant wore a ski mask. Au
thorities estimate that he is between
45 and 55 years old.
The Stanford police are presently

working in a joint investigation with
the FBI to apprehend the suspect.
The police declined to reveal the
amount of money stolen and the
identities of those involved.
Bystanders said they were im
pressed by the tellers' composure.
" The customers' and employees' re
markable calm, despite their obvious
inner fright, allowed this tragic event
to pass relatively smoothly." said the
eyewitness.
Saturday's incident is the first rob
bery at this branch in over 10 years.
During the last hold-up, the robber
took all of the customers hostage.
The Stanford police currently
have no leads on Saturday's crime,
but Watson said they are watching
other banks more closely.
"Bank robbery is generally one of
the crimes in which a higher percent
of the offenders are apprehended."
Watson said.
This is due in large part to the
technology in today's banks, which
includes video monitoring and the
use of marked bills, the serial num
bers of which have been recorded.
