## U.S. Senate rejects treaty banning nuclear testing 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Senate rejected a landmark treaty to
ban nuclear testing Wednesday,
handing President Clinton a humili
ating foreign policy defeat.
The vote was 48 to 51. far short of
the 67 votes — or two-thirds of the
w Senate — needed for ratification. As
expected, the final vote closely fol
lowed party lines, with only four
Republicans voting for it and Sen.
Robert C. Bvrd. D-W.Va., voting
present.
The showdown followed a bruis
ing partisan battle. Democrats
vowed to make the rejection a prime
2(XK) campaign issue, claiming polls

show most Americans favor such a
ban — first proposed by President
Dwight Eisenhower in 1458.
Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott. R-Miss.. called the pact "fatally
flawed."
The clock ran out after three days
of debate and futile negotiations for
a postponement among Senate
Democrats, the White House and
Republican Senate leaders.
Republicans who voted for the
treaty were Sens. John Chafee of
Rhode Island, James Jeffords of
Vermont, Gordon Smith of Oregon
and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.
The treaty has been signed by 154

nations, hut must be ratified by all 44
of the world's nuclear-capable coun
tries to take effect. Thus, the Senate
vote was an enormous blow.
Supporters warned the price of
outright rejection would be certain
international condemnation — and
could even increase pressure on
emerging nuclear powers like Pak
istan and India to conduct more
tests.
"With this vote tonight, the world
becomes a more dangerous place,"
declared Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.
Specter pointed to the military
coup in Pakistan as one more reason
why treaty is important. "The events

of the past 24 hours in Pakistan show
the undesirahility of having Pakistan
test," he said.
America's top European allies
Britain, France and Germany — had
called on the Senate late last week
not to reject the pact. And China
earlier this week said U.S. ratifica
tion would lead other countries to
follow suit.
But opponents claimed the com
pliance with the treaty could not he
verified and argued that it would do
little to stop terrorist organizations
or dictators from developing nuclear
weapons.
"It cannot accomplish its highlv

exaggerated stated goal of halting
the spread of nuclear weapons," said
Senate Foreign Relations Commit
tee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
He also said the would undermine
conlidence in the U.S. nuclear arse
nal.
Clinton had made ratification a
top second-term priority and was the
lirst world leader to sign the pact in
September 1996.
Of the 44 nuclear-capable coun
tries, 26 had signed the treaty as of
I hursday. Bui of the world's seven
declared nuclear powers,. only
Britain and France have done so.
Although many Republicans

favored a delay, a small band of con
servatives, including Helms, blocked
every overture made by either Clin
ton or Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.C.
Helms had bottled up the treaty
in his Foreign Relations Committee
for a full two years before Senate
GOP leaders, knowing they had the
votes to kill the pact, suddenly
brought it up for a vote.
Sens. John Warner, R-Va., and
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
said more than half of the Senate had
signed a bipartisan letter supporting
a delay in principle. Warner opposed
the pact and Moynihan favored it.
