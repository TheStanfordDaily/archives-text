Don't criticize Corporate
America without thinking
I applaud I van Nordby's tongue-in
check critique ol the dearth of public ser
vice opportunities at Tuesday's career fair.
However. Ins characterization of the event
as "the red light district of Corporate Amer
ica" only highlights the spiteful anti-corpo
rate undercurrent that exists at Stanford.
Stanford is arguably the premier pre
protcssional and technical university in the
world Ihe fact cannot be ignored: for many
prospective students, the allure of Silicon
Valley is irresistible. The "pioneering,
entrepreneurial spirit" runs so deeply here
that President Casper includes it as one of
I he University's fundamental virtues.
I cannot help but agree. I chose Stanford
in part because it would allow me to pursue
;i career in high-tech. For others who did
likew isc. the notion of creating the "next big
thing" is incredibly powerful. Producing
and marketing revolutionary products can
be |list as invigorating and fulfilling as work
ing for a non-profit. Has this occurred to
those who decry aspiring business people?
Money and passion are not mutually exclu
sive don't cry for me as if I'm some lost
soul who has prostituted himself to an evil
organization.
Vlv intent is not to incite another

"techies" vs. "fuzzies" debate. Stanford's
prowess in technological and business-relat
ed fields is certainly ;i double edged sword.
The same drive that propels students
towards innovation can be perverted into a
relentless pursuit of money. For evidence of
this, look 110 further than recent cover sto
ries in Fortune and Time. However, there
are those til us who value Silicon Valley for
its original virtues: creativity and excellence
in technology.
Corporations can change people's lives
for the better. They can also change peo
ple's lives for the worse. Hut let's not glob
ally apply the latter assumption to all corpo
rations and to all businesspeople. Instead of
lamenting the ills that some corporations
have perpetrated, why don't we focus on
their potential for good? In their visit last
week, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield
demonstrated the power of business to gen
erate huge sums of money for social better
ment.
Accordingly, please realize that students
who choose to enter the business world are
not relegated to a life of social irresponsibil
ity. I, for one, hope to parlay business suc
cess into creating opportunities for young
people.
I refuse to be characterized as a hapless
lemming joining the doomed ranks of cor
porate America. If I am dissatisfied with the

business world, I would have no qualms
about pursuing other options. So. Mr. Nord
by, as you noted, I will do what I want to.
And someone will pay me for it.

New ticket policy helps the
team
The attitude that The Daily and many
Stanford students in general are taking
towards the new ticket policy is very disap
pointing and un-fanlike.
It seems to me almost like everyone at
Stanford got up yesterday morning, picked
up The Daily and read the announcement
about the new plan with the same thing
running through thbir head: "How will this
affect me?" The question that no one seems
to be asking is. "How will this affect the
team?" That is what a real fan would care
about.
What people are forgetting here is that
while early interest was so high last year,
attendance was downright bad. For the non
big. non-winter break games, the Sixth Man
section was rarely full, and the student sec
tion was never full.
I helped coordinate ticket distribution
for one of the niostlv-freshman dorms last

year, and I am sorry to say that more often
then not, our tickets went unused. At the
beginning of the year, everyone was very
gung-ho about basketball. It was the"in"
thing at the freshman dorms to love the Car
dinal. But when it came time to actually go
to the games, the class of 2(X)2 collectively
flaked out.
The goal of the new system is and should
be to put people in the seats. It provides an
incentive for people to go to the less popu
lar games and even to get friends to borrow
their ticket and shirt when they can't make
it. It also greatly increases the base of peo
ple eligible to go to those games. All this,
and it still provides a guarantee for the real
die-hards to go to every game.
Every single complaint The Daily has
about the system is based on one worry:
"What if too many people show up for the
games?" I say great! If 12(K) people show
up for the Marathon game then the system
is a outstanding success — even if a few
people who show up late have to be turned
away. As more people come to each game,
the die-hards have to put in an effort to
prove themselves. However, this is a trade
off that any real fan would be willing to
make.
