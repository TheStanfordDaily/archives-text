## Travis Kopp How unbridled greed drove me back to Stanford 
### 
Well, it's been
about four
weeks and
you've probably already
noticed how much this
year is the same as last
year. Granted, you've
moved all your stuff into a

different room, you have different classes
and you've met more people. Basically,
though, you're doing all the same things a
little different in the same place. Hut I guess
that is growing up, as they say.
I myself wasn't here last year. I took the
entire year off, and to tell the truth, it actu
ally did feel a little strange to come back.
I'm glad I am, though; it's good to be here.
As far as my year went: I have to say that I
think stopping out is great. I would recom
mend it.
Take some time off, see the world, and
gain some perspective outside of this B.ISO
acres we call Stanford. I would especially
recommend it if you have in mind some
thing cool to do like working as a cook
aboard ;\ ship in the South Pacific, starting
an Internet company or the old classic —
interning in Washington. D.C.
Myself, 1 spent almost the whole time
hanging out in my hometown with my
friend, drinking coffee, meeting a few (very
lew) girls and working goofy jobs. I wasn't
living with my parents, which I hear can
drive a person insane (and 1 believe it), but
still I was quite unproductive.
It bothers me sometimes to think about
all the time I've lost without accomplishing
much. I have the vague worry that if I don't
start leading an interesting life sooner or

later. I'll be visited late some night by an
ominous black-robed spirit who will club
me over the head and dump my body in the
East river, which is a long drive from here,
even for a spirit.
More than that, though, I think I fear
facing 40 or more years of dull tedium with
out any hope of an exit. I think that's what
life becomes if a person stops fighting to be
interesting. So I wonder if getting away
from Stanford only to do nothing was really
the best idea.
I am older than I was when I left: older
and wiser, as they say: though I'm not
entirely sure about the second part. I did
learn one thing from my time off. I learned
that I don't want to work for nine dollars an
hour. My hope is that if I get a degree from
Stanford, I'll be able to find someone will
ing to pay me a little more.
Even with this motivation, though, I still
can't give up my attachment to essentially
useless thought, in particular abstract math
ematics. It's better than English or history,
but all the same, I'm not sure if there's a
large market for people who can do compli
cated calculus problems while drunk or
even people who can find the 17th root of
unity.
I suppose a better way to come out of
here with a large earning potential would be
to study engineering, or perhaps to marry a
cute computer science major. Unfortunate
ly, I believe there's a rather low ratio of girls
in the CS department, and the cute ones are
probably already taken.
At any rate, I've decided to stick with
what 1 know, take some more math classes,
and when it's over I'll at least have a Stan-

ford diploma to frame and put on my dress
er. Majoring in math may not be the best
way to become rich quick, but it is a plan.
And one thing that I've realized is that it is
imperative to want something — anything
and to pursue that. Because, in the end,
people are only what they want, and only so
much as they want it. It may be cliche, but
without that, they are left blind to be
swirled around by whatever random forces
bump into them.
My friend tells me over e-mail that she
believes there is a How to life that carries
everything in the right direction and that if
you go against the current, it feels wrong.
Perhaps that is true, but on the other hand,
perhaps if you follow the current, life traps
you in an eddy and spits you out in exactly
the same place 20 years later. It seems to me
that left to the How alone, people would still
be cold, hungry and bloodthirsty. Every
achievement of merit has resulted from
unflinching purpose and not from a submis
sion to the "life force."
At least that's my working hypothesis
for the moment. I hope it is true, but if
anyone has any substantial evidence to the
contrary, please e-mail me at
tkopp@leland. Until then, enjoy your time
here. You don't have that long before
your parents' money runs out and you
have to make some of your own. Good
Luck.
