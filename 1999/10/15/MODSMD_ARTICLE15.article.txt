# Bike club propels youngsters down new course

It doesn't take that much to im
press 8-year-olds, but Stanford
mountain bike club racer Rebecca
Van Hazinga was trying extra hard
to drive her message home.
"I'm a downhill mountain-bike
racer, and I go really fast over rocks
and branches and stull. 1 fall down
all the time, so I always wear my
helmet, because I only have one
brain," Van Hazinga told an atten
tive group of Fairmeadow Elemen
tary school students gathered
Tuesday morning to learn how to
wear their helmets properly.
Clad in lull mountain bike gear
gloves, cleats, tights, red- and
white-striped Stanford jersey and,
of course, a properly fitted white
helmet — the second-year MBA
student was there with two other
members of the Stanford Cycling
("ILib to help Palo Alto parents, fire
fighters and police demonstrate
safe riding skills to about 50 kids as
part of the Palo Alto School Dis
trict's Bicycling Life Skills pro
gram.
Stanford students have helped
with the program for several years.
"We know more about cycling than
anyone else there, so we're sort of
the example cyclists," said
Matthew Hills, a doctoral student
in electrical engineering and the cy
cling club's sports representative
and unofficial community liaison.
"We send at least two club mem
bers to every elementary school
within the Palo Alto school district.
The idea is to teach kids how to
look over their shoulders [before
moving into traffic], how to lit hel
mets properly, stull like that."
Program organizers said basic
skills such as these were especially
important for third graders, who
are often still learning to ride bikes.

"It seems like third grade is
when the majority of kids have
mastered not falling down, but the
vast majority have had no instruc
tion in 'driving' a bike. If you can
reach them at this stage, they're not
as set in their habits," explained
Kathy Durham, a Palo Alto parent
who chairs the PTA's traffic safety
commission and organizes the dis
trict-wide program. "At the sta
tions where they're riding through
you can see them visibly improv
ing."
At yesterday's Fairmeadow El
ementary event, groups of about a
dozen kids cycled through stations
designed to teach them how to be
safe on the road.

While Van I la/inga and another
club member explained how hel
mets should lit and adjusted loose
straps, sophomore Josh Kadis, a
member ol the road racing team,
clipped into his pedals to show the
young riders how to look left to
check for oncoming traffic and
safely avoid obstacles such as trash
cans.
"I wanted to set a good example
for the kids and represent the uni
versity and the team in the commu
nity." Kadis said. "I thought the
kids were learning something."
Elsewhere, strips of duct tape
and tiny orange cones turned the
school's basketball courts into busy
imaginary intersections as volun

teers from the PTA, fire depart
ment and police department
helped kids learn to make eye con
tact with drivers and look both
ways when leaving a driveway.
Van I lazinga, who lives near the
school, had practical reasons for
helping out.
"I see kids riding near my house
all the time, and they look like
they're doing unsafe stuff," she
said. "It's also nice to give kids ex
perience as far as cycling being a se
rious sport, as opposed to the team
sports that get more exposure in
schools. I'lus, I always forget how
fun it is to be around little kids, and
it seemed like they liked to see peo
ple here in Stanford uniforms."
