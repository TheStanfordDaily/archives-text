### Anitha Reddy Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate clarified stu
dents' intellectual property rights on
Thursday.
The Senate unanimously ap
proved a new policy regulating stu
dents' relationships with outside enti
ties.
These relationships may "range
from student internships that are part
of a formal educational program es
tablished by the student's depart
ment to the actual conduct of a stu
dent's research or scholarship project
at the outside entity." said Electrical
Engineering Prof. Umran Inan. chair
of the Committee on Research.
The report comes at time when
the question of who owns the intel
lectual property created with the aid
of Stanford resources, whether they
be laboratories or students, is becom
ing increasingly complex.
Prof. Craig Heller posed a hypo
thetical question to Inan that placed
the abstract issue of student relation
ships with "outside entities'" into a fa
miliar context for students.
"Let's say we have an undergrad
uate or graduate student studying
[computer science) and in the course
of that student's coursework he has
developed patentable software.
Does that belong to Stanford or to
the student?"
Both Inan and Associate Dean of
Research Patricia Jones responded
by emphasizing that a student was
the sole owner of any intellectual
property he or she created in the
course of his or her university re
sponsibilities. as long as the student
did not make more than incidental
use of Stanford resources.
Jones clarified that using the Stan
ford libraries or a desktop computer
were considered incidental uses, but
that performing research in a univer

sity laboratory was considerered a
significant use of university re
sources, entitling the University to a
portion of the resultant intellectual
property rights.
"In respect to inventions,students
are treated exactly like faculty," Pres
ident Gerhard Casper said.
"It's important for students to re
alize that their scholarship at Stan
ford should not be influenced by fi
nancial or personal gain," Inan re
marked. A few Senate members
dipped their chins in agreement.
Yet even this simple statement
became problematic when juxta
posed with routine occurrences.
"At least five times a year 1 have
students come to me and ask toenroll
in directed-reading units to work on
developing ;i business plan with me,"
Economics Prof. Roger Noll said.
"Should I not be doing that?"
Jones reiterated since that work
was being done in the course of the
student's university responsibilities,'
it did not reflect a conflict of interest,
even il ;i student went on to found a
company based on the business plan.
Provost John Hennessy agreed
the scenario was not problematic.
Students are. however, complete
ly within their rights to establish start
ups with only an incidental use of
I Jniversity resources.
{Jniversity Registrar Roger Print
lip expressed concern over entrepre
neurial students forming companies
who expected assistance from pro
lessors. "We've had two instances
lately that are interesting."
The Committee on Research, in
conjunction with the I Jndergraduate
Research ()pportunities office, is de
veloping a "Student's Guide to Re
search at Stanford," that will explain
sonic of the approved policies and list
additional resources to help students
understand the legal implications of
various wavs of conducting research.
