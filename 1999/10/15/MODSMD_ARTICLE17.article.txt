The dinners will be an opportuni

recognize the contributions these
leaders make to the University. Stu
dent leaders will have the opportuni
ty to exchange ideas with other lead
ers and senators from the ASSU.
"This is a great chance for us to
hear from people on campus who

are making things happen. 1 am ex
cited to find out what the ASSU can
do to make things easier for these
leaders." stated Undergraduate Sen
ate Chair Steven Aronowitz, in a

press release.
This quarter the Un
dergraduate Senate will
be hosting dinners for
groups concerned about
how the University allo
cates space and money to

student organizations and resi
dences. These groups include the co
ops and non-varsity athletic organi
zations.
One of the Undergraduate Sen
ate's main priorities this year is to
discuss land use at Stanford. The
senators will be attending the Gen

eral Use Permits meeting next
1 hursday in Santa Clara at 7:30 p.m.
Both ASSU President Mike
Levin and ASSU Vice President
John Mills will be meeting with Vice

Provost for Student Af
fairs James Montoya to
discuss space issues at
Stanford next week, and
following that meeting
Montoya will be speaking
with the Undergraduate

Senate.
Senators also discussed the up
coming Oct. 21 hearing on the Draft
Community Plan. The plan deals
with concerns about Stanford's cur
rent housing and facilities develop
ment and preservation of open
space.

The Undergraduate Senate
wants to ensure that undergraduates
understand the implications of the
plan and its influence on the future
of the University.
"Stanford needs more housing
for graduate students and faculty if
we are to remain a premiere re
search university. It is becoming
more and more difficult to recruit
grad students and faculty," Under
graduate Senate Deputy Chair Ben
Liu stated in a press release.
Students will have an opportunity
to raise their concerns and give feed
hack to the ASSU at a student forum
in November. This forum will be
open to any concerns, not just con
cerns dealing with space issues at
Stanford.
