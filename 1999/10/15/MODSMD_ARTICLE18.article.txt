# University condemns Roble party moniker
## 
### Marisa Taylor 
The question of where to draw
the line between good clean fun
and offensive stereotypes came
into play when the theme of Roble
1 fall's upcoming party was changed
from "Pimps and 1 Iocs" to "Flashy
Trash" at the request of university
residential staff.
Roble had publicized its Satur
day-scheduled all-campus party by
posting fliers in Wilbur Hall and
Branner Hall reading. "Pimps and
I foes (in a P.C. way)."
After the fliers were posted,
Roble dorm government was in
formed by Lisa Webb, the resident
dean of Roble. Yost and Suites,
that the title of the party would
have to be changed or it could not
be held as planned.
Roble Resident Fellow Sam
Leßaron said that students need to
be aware of specific guidelines in

volved with planning a dorm party
as sanctioned by the administra
tion. such as the manner in which
alcohol is'served. how the party will
be managed and controlled and es
pecially how the party is advertised
and presented to the community.
Leßaron said. "We need to be
cautious and avoid references to
stereotypes or gender and racial is
sues that are shown in a way that
people could reasonably take of
fense.
"I think that the concern of [the
administration! is that a whore is
literally meant to be a woman who
sells her body. | I he students] need
to realize that there are a lot of
women who have felt really uncom
fortable with issues of sexual ex
ploitation or assault."
Ill members of Roble dorm
government were quick to accept
the administration's decision and
made new fliers that advertised

"Flashy Trash" to convey the same
message of festive dress minus the
possibility of offensive innuendoes.
However, some students felt
that the administration's actions
contradicted what they had previ
ously told students.
Roble treasurer Christophe
Larroque. a sophomore who was
involved with the party planning
process, said the administration
had suggested that a "Pimps and
Hoes" theme would not be appro
priate for a party but that little
could be done to stop it.
The students took this as an ap
proval of their theme, posted fliers
accordingly, only to later en
counter the request to change the
theme.
"You can make anything out to
be offensive if you look at it from a
suggestive angle." said Larroque.
"1 can understand why people
wouldn't want to come dressed as a

pimp or ho. But the point is that
you don't have to if you don't want
to. It's like Halloween, and two
thirds of the fun of Halloween is
getting dressed up."
Leßarron said there needs to be
discussion among students and ad
ministrators in order to strike a
common agreement about what is
appropriate in the way of parties.
He commented that "both the
students and administration have
wanted to get a better definition of
guidelines for parties so as to have
a good time but not to violate any
laws or offend anyone. But if the
advertising for the party suggests
some sort of stereotype, what does
that say when we're inviting our
friends to be part of that?"
Johnnie Madrid, a freshman and
president of Roble, said, "I think
there is some confusion about the
amount of freedom that students
are allowed to have."
