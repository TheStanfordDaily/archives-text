# Warm crowd gathers for first evening of award-winning writing
## Bookstore launches Steger / Jones series 
### Josh Samberg 
I lie Stegner Fellows / Jones Lec
turers Reading series kicked off last
night with a reading at the Stanford
Hookstore. A eozy gathering of
about 35 settled into the rear of the
store to hear two poets and one fic
tion writer present some of their
work. I his was the first of several
readings planned for this year to
showcase the participants in this
coveted program.
Lach year Stanford awards It)
Stegner fellowships for post-grad
uate work in creative writing: live
lot fiction and live for poetry. The
recipients receive two years of
funding as they write and discuss
their creations in workshops with
the othei Stegner I-'el lows. Almost
all of them will read at the Rook

store sometime during their tenure
in the program.
"Reading here is very different
than in the workshops." said Monica
Youn, a second-year fellow in poet
ry and one of the presenters. "Usu
ally [in the workshops], the audience
has copies of the poem and they
have all read it before. The Book
store readings are a good chance to
see a poet have a nervous break
down." she joked.
Fiction writer Doug Dorst said
participating in the readings, al
though nerve-wracking, was a good
experience In fact, all three presen
ters felt that this public reading wasa
chance to find out what was good
and bad in their writing. Inch re
ceived some kind of endorsement
Irom the audience. In Youn'scase it
was a mixture of laughter and head

scratching as she read her work "Po
laroid." a series of five poems about
a nude photo she found on her wind
shield.
The other poet, Joshua Corey,
recognized the potential for confu
sion about his poems and attempted
to head it off. I le explained that his
poems were taken from News of the
Blazing World, a collection he
wrote.
"Inspiration and our sense of the
larger world is purely physical," he
said. Smiling, he concluded, "which I
guess explains absolutely nothing, so
I'll just read my next poem."
Dorst, who received his under
graduate degree from Stanford, was
the final member of the trio. His
story detailed the exploits of a
flower delivery man who finds him
self hearing flowers that will spell

doom for two relationships.
. "1 liked having the chance to get a
sense of which lines were working
and which ones weren't," said Dorst.
" The chance to read to someone
other than my friends, many of
whom are also writers, gave me a dif
ferent perspective to see what needs
changing."
Audience members enjoyed the
program, leading some to remark
that a series such as this deserves
more promotion.
"The only place you could find
out about this was the creative writ
ing mailing list," said sophomore
Daniel Moreau. "It was really great.
I hope they find a way to let more
people know about it."
The next Stegner Fellows reading
will be Nov. 3 at 7 p.m. at the Book
store.
