### Marisa Pavlik Staff writer 
Former White House Chief ol
Stall Leon Panetta addressed "the
age ol paradoxes," the idea that de
spite our nation's prosperity, gov
ernment is doing little to improve
quality of American life, before a
crowd of 500 in Kresge Auditori
um.
Panetta, who spent three
decades in government service,
spoke last night about the current
gridlock in Congress, the repercus
sions of President Hill ( linton's im
peachment and the great need for
young people to engage in public
service.
Panetta's speech was sponsored
by Stanford in Government.
Piinetta said the problem in pol
itics today is the unwillingness of
politicians to compromise.
"[Our forefathers] truly be
lieved that people of good will, re
gardless of background, beliefs,
philosophies, could come together
and roll up their sleeves and argue
and ultimately work together."
Panetta said.
However, he felt that today
politicians are not reaching com
promises due to bad feelings stem
ming from Clinton's impeachment
In particular, the Senate's re
cent veto of the Nuclear Disarma
ment Treaty dismayed Panetta.
"There was no reason in the world
that they had to vote that treaty
down," he said, suggesting a delay
would have been more prudent.
He said the vote Wednesday
"sent the message that we've

He attributed the gridlock in
Congress to the impact of Clinton's
impeachment, saying the Republi

give him a win so we won't negoti

"accuse the Republicans of being a
do-nothing Congress."
"Neither [party] wants to give
anything because they're afraid the
other side will say they've won," he
said.
Panetta recalled his time as a
legislative assistant in Congress in
the 19705, saying that those sena
tors. "when they thought the na
tional interest was involved, were
willing to roll up their sleeves and
do what had lo be done It) resolve
this issue."
He expressed disappointment
that, despite advances in technolo
gy and the current healthy econo
my. the country was not making
progress in areas such as educa
tion, Social Security and Medicare.
Another consequence of the
impeachment, he said, is the grow
ing public apathy toward politics.
"It's understandable but danger
ous in a democracy," he said.
"I urge all of you. in some ca
pacity. to get involved." he said.
"Our forefathers intended for
everyone lo get involved."
"li s the best way to ensure that
the American Dream remains real.
It's the best way to ensure that we
always have a government of. by
and for all people." Panetta said.
Panetta also said that he
