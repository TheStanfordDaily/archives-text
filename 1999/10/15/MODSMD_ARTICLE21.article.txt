## Moonlit java cafe grows in popularity 
### Katie Leonberger 
The Coffee House is closed, so
where can one go if the stomach is
growling or the throat is parched?
Try Moonßean's Cafe, located
in front of Green Library. Cus
tomers frequent this outdoor cafe
during all seasons, but this fall has
witnessed increased foot traffic
from both students and faculty.
Plans are in the works for two small
er Moonßean's locations on cam
pus.
"They have good coffee and spe
cialty drinks not available at stan
dard coffee shops like Starbucks,"
explains sophomore Carolyn Starr.
Jackie Carr, who visits Moon-
Bean's about twice a week, says her
favorite drink is the white mocha
freeze. But Carr points out that the
cate has more than just coffee for
sale.
"There is an excellent selection
of different coffees, teas and juices,
as well as delicious and healthy
snacks," says Carr.
Employees at the store identify
Margo's Marvels (a specialty cook
ie) as the sort of snack that brings
customers back. Sarah Ham, a cur
rent employee at Moon Bean's, has
been working there since the end of
fall quarter last year. Ham also raves
about the specialty items, such as
freezes, that draw in customers.
Senior Jennifer Williams, a fan of
their iced coffee, adds that "They
have amazing soup and it's cheap...
a different soup of the day every
day."
But don't stop by the cafe just be
cause the food and drink is ru
moured to be good. More important
is the atmosphere — a quality this
friendly cafe seems to understand.

Moonßean's customers enjoy
the quick service it offers and the
opportunity to sit at the outdoor ta
bles and savor their purchase over
studying or conversation with a
friend.
One of Moonßean's two owners.
Jennie Reynolds, emphasizes the
difference between the CoHo and
Moon Bean's Cafe.
In addition to being different
types of business, "the two are far
enough apart that a customer would
not be choosing one over the other,"
explains Reynolds. Rather, it seems
more of a situation of current loca
tion and need, rather than prefer
ence, when the urge for coffee or a
snack hits. "There's enough busi

ness on this campus for all of us,"
comments Reynolds.
Ham adds that she believes the
cafe will continue to prosper once
the CoHo re-opens. "The two
[cafes] have different clientele and
serve different University purpos
es." says Ham.
And what about weather? Does
a winter filled with rain slow down
business for the cafe?
"The weather in past years has
not made a big difference. Cus
tomers do not seem to be too both
ered with rainy, cold days," says
Reynolds.
The only drawback of being lo
cated on campus, directly in front of
the librarv. is that the cafe is not al

lowed to put up a sign with its name
on it. The University does not allow
outer signage for fear of looking too
commercial in an area that is sup
posed to promote only academic oc
curences. according to Reynolds.
Reynolds indicates that while she
understands this, she hopes for a
compromise.
As Moonßean's continues to
succeed as a popular cafe and stop
ping ground for students and faculty
alike, Reynolds stresses that she
wants to thank all of the customers
for patronizing the cafe.
"We really have some of the
nicest customers at Stanford. It is
definitely the nicest place to work,"
says Reynolds.
