# Centre Yannick Pompidou: Frenchman on the Farm
## 
### Heather Wax 
Last September, French Instuc
tor Yannick Pompidou, the 26-
year-old grandson of former
French President Georges Pompi
dou, left behind both the bon chic
and the not-so-bon dispositions of
Paris to come to Stanford for a 16-
month teaching stint.
"It's not like here. If they're in a
bad mood, they'll be rude to you,"
Pompidou said of the Parisian pre
tension.
But since coming to Stanford
last September, Pompidou's been
met with nothing but invitations. In
addition to his teaching responsi
bilities, he is the faculty liaison to
La Maison and is in
volved in the Institute for French
Studies.
"He does a million things at
once," said Ruxandra Dorobantu,
a resident and head associate at La
Maison Fransaise. "I've only
known him since June, but I want to
stress that he's very energetic, re
sourceful and passionate. He in
volves himself in whatever he docs
and he gets things done."
As the faculty liaison to La Mai
son Pompidou keeps the
department up-to-date with what's
going on in the residence on the
Row and plans public French cul
tural events. He's also running six
seminars on humanities and sci
ences this quarter with French and
Drama Prof. Jean-Marie Apos
tolides, bringing in people from San
Francisco to discuss French culture
and thought with an informal
group.
"It's been busy, but he has
shown a lot of responsibility."
Apostolides said. "He's constantly
on my back to make sure things are
done in the proper way. And when
he says he'll do something, he does
it. In spite of our age difference — I
am exactly the age of his father —
we have a friendship and mutual re
spect for our differences."
But Pompidou is definitely from
a younger generation, not at all
akin to what graduate student
Stephanie Hein discerns is the
French tradition of having profes
sors authoritatively dictate to stu
dents what to think.
"He encourages discussions and
a sharing of ideas. And he's willing

to work with you." said Hein. who
took 2()th century French Poetry,
taught by Pompidou last spring.
"But you don't feel like you're
being experimented on by some
young kid. He knows what he's
talking about."
Maybe that's because Pompidou
had to beat out close to 900 other
applicants in IW4 to gain one of 32
spots at the Ecole Normal Su
perieure. Four years later, he had a
teaching degree from the elite Paris
training college and had made it
through the aggregation, France's
highest competitive examination
for University teachers, in Modern
Literature.
"I learned to share the experi
ence of a text — to know it. feel it,
see its differences," he said.
And in his Introduction to
French Culture and Civilization
class, Pompidou incorporates
much of the eclectic charm that
comes with his broad knowledge of
politics, art and literature. He
wants his students to understand
where he's coming from, although
he realizes it may not always be
easy.
"It's difficult to discuss French
culture. You cannot understand it if
you know nothing of French social
ism, World War II or May 1%8," he
said. "Students here are tolerant to
different cultures and ways of dis
cussing political issues."
But despite his penchant for
portraying French history, he's not
merely a connoisseur of the past.
Not only has he stressed the impor
tance of the Institute for French
Studies, which lets students be
come "French specialists in up-to
date subjects such as business, engi
neering, politics and the media."
but he's also tried to awaken "new
ideals in culture and art."
"You have to know contempo
rary creation. You have to go on
from classics studies to what's
going on now." he said. "And that's
why it's a pleasure to work with the
students who choose French.
They're hard-working, curious and
open to do anything new."
When he leaves Stanford at the
end of the quarter, Pompidou plans
to try some novel things of his own.
He's preparing to work for a
French and German television
channel and to spend some time in

Paris with his fiancee, Maude. He
also hopes to be involved with
modern art, perhaps even at the
museum his grandfather initiated
over 20 years ago.
And while Georges Pompidou
himself was both a professor and
promoter of French culture, the
younger Pompidou eschews the
idea that his interests come almost
genetically.
"I don't see the point in being
like somebody else," he said. "It
just feels normal to help modern art

and artists and to teach it and de
fend it. I don't think two people liv
ing 30 years apart can feel the same
way at the age of 26."
And Pompidou seems wise on
the ways of time, or at least pretty
sure of how to savor it.
"I've been close to creative peo
ple so I want to experience modern
art as a researcher and teacher. But
more than all that, I want a normal
life. I'm not that interested in
money, and I don't want two weeks
of vacation a year."
