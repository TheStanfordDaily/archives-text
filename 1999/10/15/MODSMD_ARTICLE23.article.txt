# Grads 'Peace' out
## Stanford students active in relief program 
### Christina Harvey 
After sophomore Julia
Goodnogh graduates from Stan
ford, she hopes to join the list of
1,280 Stanford alumni since 1961
who have served in the Peace Corps.
"I plan to go to medical school
eventually, but 1 want to take those
two years off and do something pro
ductive while 1 prepare for the long
haul," Goodnogh said. "I want to
get a greater perspective on helping
people before I immerse myself
again in academia. 1 know 1 want to
do something health-related,
maybe with education as well. They
have programs in Third World
countries to teach pregnant women
about nutrition."
Kirsten Firing, a recruiter from
the Peace Corps, spent this past
Tuesday and Wednesday seeking
individuals like Goodnogh to fight
hunger, bring clean water to com
munities, teach children, start new
businesses and stop the spread of
HIV/AIDS in the 78 countries cur
rently served.
"Stanford historically has been
one of the top producers of Peace
Corps volunteers of all universities
nationwide," said Peace Corps rep
resentative Heidi Thorn. "That's
pretty impressive, considering Stan
ford is not the biggest school.
"Stanford students seem to have
a commitment to service and to
making the world a better place, and
we know that a number of students
on campus are involved in a number
of service opportunities on campus.
It's a natural extension for students
to take their volunteer experience
and translate it into Peace Corps
service."
Stanford ranks tenth on the all
time list of colleges nationwide for
producing Peace Corps volunteers.
It ranks third in California, beaten
by the UC-Berkeley, the number
one producer, and UCLA.
Ines Barbosa, Class of 1998, is
one of 30 Stanford graduates over
seas with the Peace Corps today.
Barbosa is using her Stanford coter
minal degree in sociology to work as
a youth development volunteer in
Costa Rica.
Barbosa, who is currently in
Costa Rica participating in a three
month training session, said she is
looking forward to two years of ser
vice.
"I wanted more experience
working with urban youth," Bar
bosa said. "1 did my thesis on street
children in Peru and did research
there.
"I eventually want to work on
policy aspects at the international
level, so I wanted to go ahead and
get a different perspective on youth
issues. I worked with street children

when I was in America, but in the
Peace Corps, you get the opportuni
ty to work with government agen
cies and see how they handle prob
lems."
Barbosa is part of the last Peace
Corps group in Costa Rica. The
Peace Corps will be leaving Costa
Rica in 2002 because the Peace
Corps said its service is no longer
necessary, Barbosa said.
Though Barbosa is already
working at a children's shelter in
San Jose, Costa Rica because of her
language proficiency, she said she is
excited about branching out and
leaving the city.
"We'll be working with schools,
non-profit organizations, communi
ty groups, social workers and the
ministry to promote youth pro
grams," she said.
The Peace Corps also offers pro
grams in education, health, civil en
gineering, environmental aware
ness and conservation, business de
velopment, agriculture and forestry,
said Thorn.
"We're looking to fill 3,500 posi
tions for the year 2000," said Thorn.
"We're looking for students with a
college degree from any major and
some volunteer or community ser
vice experience.
"Students should have a desire to
work overseas for two years in cross
cultural environment and use a new
language, work with people differ
ent from them, and hopefully make
a difference in other people's lives."
Thorn said the Peace Corps is
competitive — one volunteer is ac
cepted for every three applicants.
"But if someone is motivated
and demonstrates commitment and
enthusiasm about going overseas, I
want to talk to that person," she
said. "We're looking for students
with flexibility, courage, the ability
to live independently, take initiative
and overcome challenges."
Thorn said that while students
exchange cultures and help coun
tries in need around the world, they
also gain job experience.
After working in the Peace
Corps, many get law degrees or go
to medical school, and the experi
ence as a Peace Corps volunteer
strengthens their applications, she
said.
"The Peace Corps really gives
students the opportunity to work
independently and with a tremen
dous amount of responsibility — far
more than you could ever get in an
entry-level position job in the
U. 5.," Thorn said. "It's really a
great stepping stone for interna
tional jobs, too. Our students do it
for many reasons. They want to get
job skills, but they also want to trav
el and get cross-cultural experi
ence."
