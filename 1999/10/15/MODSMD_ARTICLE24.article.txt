"///', you've reached Dan
Schwartz, Dan McClaskey, Jake
Doll, J.J. McKeever and Frank Du
binsky. No, that's not a joke. So
leave a message."
The five members of the Kairos
House two-room quint, all sopho
mores, have an excellent sense of
humor about their living arrange
ment.
Then again, perhaps they have
to.
"I usually wake up to five differ
ent alarm clocks," said light sleep
er Doll, a sophomore.
Every year, hundreds of stu
dents seeking more flexibility in
their housing options, draw into
Stanford's cooperatives.
"It's a lot of fun and a different
atmosphere," said Doll.
Doll and his crew were the last
to draw into Kairos and were per
suaded by their housemates to live
in the quint. Despite the crowded
arrangement and potential lack of
privacy, the unanimous sentiment
to date is "so far so good."

Bui it lakes some effort to make
the room work.
"In the morning, you have to be
quiet and considerate if someone's
sleeping." said Doll. Dubinsky
added that "sometimes we don't
branch out to meet other people
because we're already surrounded
by good friends."
According to Brvnnen San
doval. a sophomore living in a one
room quad in Columbae. her room
this year is not exactly conducive to
studying.
"When you live in a double, if
you want to talk to your roommate
but she wants study, you have no
one to talk to." said Sandoval. "But
here, there is always someone to
talk to."
But the benefits of group living
appear to outweigh the drawbacks.
"There's always a party if you
want one." said Doll.
Doll said that some members of
Kairos may have initially been in
timidated by the group because
thev thought the quint was always
throwing parties.
I he Kairos five keep their home
cleaner than one would imagine.
"There's just lots of stuff
around," said Dubinsky.
In the category of electrical ap
pliances. the Kairos roommates
have tour stereos, three televisions,
tour computers, two video-game
systems, five alarm clocks and one
video camera. Unfortunately for
their parents and all of their
friends, they only have one tele
phone.
Sandoval and her roommates
have designated one of their closets
as a "phone booth ... because it's
nice to have some privacy."
A policy for more complex mat
ters of privacy, however, is vet to be
determined by the roommates.

The members of Synergy House
have come up with a creative solu
tion to the problem of romantic pri
vacy.
The house's "nookie room" pro
vides residents with an option more
favorable than either "sexiling" a
roommate or celibacy.
Every quarter at Synergy,
rooms are chosen by consensus.
"The system has its ups and
downs," said Rob Baesman. a
coterminal student in computer sci
ence.
The meeting this fall took
"only" three hours and 45 minutes.
Seniors David Ahril and
Thomas Murley chose to live in one
of Synergy's doubles because it "is
kind of indicative of the communi
ty ideal here as far as shared living
space."
As one of the live members of
the Kairos quint said. "In the end
it's not the room. It's the people."
