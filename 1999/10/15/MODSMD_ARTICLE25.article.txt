## Card hosts Arizona squads Soccer team looks to weekend showdown with 'Devils, 'Cats 
### Becky Blanchard Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's soccer
team has been playing on the road for
nearly a month now, but, boasting a
five-game winning streak, the team
isn't showing anv signs of homesick
ness yet.

WOMEN'S SOCCER
■ Today: No. I(> Stanford {11-3,2-0
Pacific 10 Conference) at Arizona
(6-6.0-3), 7 p.m.
■ Sunday: Stanford at Arizona State
7-4,0-2), 1 p.m.

Instead, the No. l6Cardinal(l 1-3.
2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) opened
conference play last weekend with
solid victories over ()regon and Ore
gon State. The squad will travel to
Arizona (6-6.0-3) on today and Ari
zona State (7-4.0-2) on Sunday, hop
ing to earn two more wins and con
tinue on the road to a closer destina
tion — the Final Four in San Jose.
Although the Cardinal looks like
a contender for the conference title,
both Arizona and Arizona State
could pose a threat to Stanford's un
tarnished Pac-10 record. The 'Cats

have suffered three severe losses so
far in Pac-10 play, facing two ranked
teams No. 5 UCLA and No. 14
USC — already. Despite being on a
16-game Pac-10 losing streak, Ari
zona could get a boost from stellar in
dividual play.
Containing the Wildcat duo of
forwards Chrissy Sanford and
Tiffany Sabado could be a challenge
to the ( ardinal defense. Sanford and
Sabado have combined to spark the
majority of the 'Cats' offense
throughout the season.
1 lowever, the Wildcat defense,
which has been its main weakness
this season, will have to be on its toes
as well. Stanford's offense, led by se
nior Kcllv Adamson, has been bom
barding its opponents with shots on
goal, and is currently second in the
Pac-10 in team points.
Adamson, who has six goals and
13 points already this season, should
play a big role in the Cardinal attack.
She will likely have help from fresh
men Becky Myers and Marcia Wal
lis. who have already proven to be in
tegral parts of Stanford's offense.
The Cardinal has a promising 4-0
record against Arizona, having deci
sively beaten the Wildcats in their
last matchup. 8-1.

The fledgling Arizona State pro
gram has proven to be a jagged pill
for the Cardinal to swallow in the'
past. Although the Sun Devils have
struggled in conference play, they
have remained undefeated against
the Cardinal, with a 1-0-1 record
against Stanford in past matches.
Stanford junior goalkeeper Carly
Smolak and the rest of the Cardinal
defense, which turned in an impres
sive performance against the Ore
gon schools last week, should have
their work cut out for them this
weekend in trying to contain Ari
zona State's Stacey Tullock. Tul
lock, a two-time under-21 national
team member, currently leads the
conference in points (26), goals (10)
and assists (six) this season. But the
Sun Devils have lacked offensive
depth, an area where the Cardinal
hopes to shine.
Stanford's front line will face one
of the conference's top goalkeepers
this season in Arizona State's Erin
Reinke. Reinke has a mere 1.37
goals-against average. In order to
score, Stanford will likely try to out
shoot its opponent, a strategy that has
led to great success so far this season
and placed the Cardinal second in the
conference in team offense.
