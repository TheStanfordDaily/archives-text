# Looking for a bit of sweet revenge
## Men's soccer takes on SLO, Sac State 
### Meghan O'Connor Staff writer 
Last season it may have been just
one goal that kept the Stanford
men's soccer team from claiming
the Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation title. That goal came from Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo, and tonight
the Cardinal hopes to make it pay
back time.

MEN'S SOCCER
■ Tonight: Stanford (2-2, 1-0-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) vs. Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
(3-6-2, 0-0-1). 7:30 p.m. New Mal
oney Field
■ Sunday: Stanford vs. Sacramento
State (2-9,0-0), 2 p.m. New Maloney
Field

The rematch is the first of two
home games for the Cardinal (6-2-2,
1-0-1 MPSF) this weekend. The
men also take on Sacramento State
(2-9.0-0) Sunday afternoon.
This weekend marks the second
weekend of conference play for
Stanford, which started in Colorado
last week.
Although frustrated hy a I -I tie
with Air Force last weekend, the
Cardinal's current league tally is
nothing to worry about. The men
are secure with a record that closely
mirrors last year's record (7-3, 0-1-
0) at this point in the season.
"Obviously we would have liked
a win at Air Force, but we're still in
a good position in conference play,"
junior forward Corey Woolfolk
said. "Spirits are up in the locker
room and we're anxious to get back
at Cal Poly for last year's match."
A successful preseason and the

growth of the team so far this season
indicates the potential of a strong
team that should be able to deliver
as conference play continues.
"I feel our forwards have per
formed superbly and now need to
turn a few more of the opportunities
they are creating into goals," head
coach Bobby Clark said. "Also, our
flank players, both defenders and
wide midfielders are linking nice
ly."
And that's just the kind of team
effort Stanford will be trying to re
peat tonight when it faces the Mus
tangs. Despite a disappointing pre
season for Cal Poly (3-6-2, 0-0-1),
the Cardinal can't discount the po
tential force of its opponent.
"1 saw Cal Poly tie with Cal-
Berkelcy earlier this year," Clark
said. "I felt they had a very solid
team and should have won that
game. They have some very good
players and will provide stout oppo
sition."
Cal Poly returns eight starters
from last year's squad that boasted
a school-record number of wins
with its 11-7-2 record. Among the
returnees is last season's top scorer,
sophomore midfielder Johnny
Cummins, and senior midfielder
Brian Lange, whose game-winner
last year against Stanford was one
of four game-ending goals that he
scored during the season.
Sophomore goalkeeper Brenton
Junge brings with him a school
record of 97 saves and five shutouts
from last season. A 1.54 goals
against-averagc for Junge, howev
er, is tough to compare with Stan
ford senior Adam Zapala's .57
