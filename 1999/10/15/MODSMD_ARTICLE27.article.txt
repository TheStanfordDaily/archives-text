# Football looks to return to winning form
## Stanford hosts Beavers in homecoming battle 
### Ben Freda Editorial staff 
Against Oregon State on Saturday, Stanford's up
and-down football team will be looking to answer a
nagging question: is it Dr. Jekyll, or is it Mr. Hyde?
Most recently, Stanford (3-2, 3-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) looked distinctively Hyde-ish, turning in a
forgettable 44-39 loss to San Jose State two weeks
ago.

FOOTBALL
■ Saturday: Stanford (3-2,3-0 Pacific 10 Conference) vs.
Oregon State 3-2,0-2), 2 p.m. Stanford Stadium

The loss came after three straight conference vic
tories that put the Cardinal in sole possession of the
Pac-10 lead.
Against Washington State, Arizona and UCLA,
Stanford's potent offense came out pumping, eating
up yards like candy and scoring feverishly. In those
three games, the Cardinal outscored opponents by a
total of 146-71. Even without senior quarterback
I'odd Husak, Stanford was able to rally behind red
shirt sophomore backup Joe Borchard to stun then-
No. 19 UCLA 42-32.
But a week later, the Cardinal looked sluggish on
offense and sloppy on defense, falling 44-39 to the
Spartans despite the fact that San Jose State was with
out standout running back Deonce Whittaker, who
led the NCAA in most running categories.
Given the nature of this season, does head coach
Tyrone Willingham wonder whether it will be Dr.
Jekyll or Mr. Hyde each week?
"It has nothing to do with the nature of the sea
son." Willingham said. "I always wonder what we're
going to get. And I think probably every coach
around the country would probably tell you the same
thing, that they're always wondering what's going to
show up."
Saturday, Stanford has another chance to be Dr.
Jekyll. Oregon State (3-2,0-2), which started the sea
son with three straight wins against nonconference
opponents, is coming off of a two-game losing streak

in which the team looked less than
brilliant.
Last weekend, the Beavers
weathered the team's first home
loss of the season. It didn't take
long for the game to turn ugly, as
Oregon State's seven turnovers in
the first half led to a 45-0 halftime
lead for Washington.
But the lopsided score belied
Oregon State's true strength: a po
tent offense. Despite losing 47-21
to Washington, the Beavers were
able to outgain the Huskies 434
yards to 347.
"1 think what has been their
[Oregon State's] Achilles' heel the
last two ballgames is the fact that
they've made some turnovers,"
Willingham said. "Other than that,
their offense has basically been un
stoppable.
"They're up in the high 400 sin
terms of total offense, so they have
been very, very good," Willingham
said.
Willingham's squad will have to

watch out for sophomore tailback
Ken Simonton, who had 24 carries
for 104 yards against the Huskies.
With 790 yards and 12 touchdowns,
Simonton ranks among the coun
try's top rushers.
"1 think you have to put this
young man in that great category
because what he's done in the year
and a half that he's been in that pro
gram has just been outstanding,"
Willingham said. "He's a bona fide
big-time player who makes things
happen."
Oregon State's potent rushing
game will be a serious concern for
the Cardinal defense, which ceded
1 IS yards on 46 rushes to San Jose
State two weeks ago.
But what must have worried
Willingham more was the porous
ness of Stanford's pass defense,
which allowed Spartan quarter
back Chris Kasteler to complete 24
of 43 passes for 36K yards and a
touchdown.
One bright spot on the Cardinal
defense was the impressive pres
sure the team was able to put on
Kasteler. Senior cornerback Frank
Primus, in particular, sacked

Kasteler three times. All told, the
Cardinal defense got to Kasteler
seven times for a total loss of 54
yards.
The good news for the Cardinal
is that its potent offense will he
baek in full form following last
week's hye. The break gave I lusak
a chance to fully recuperate from
bruised rihs suffered against
UCLA. He missed the Cardinal s
game against San Jose State.
Add I lusak to senior wideout
Troy Walters — who broke the
Pac-10 career receiving record two
weeks ago with lKfi yards against
San Jose State, putting him at 3,340
for his career — and Stanford s air
attack becomes nearly unstop
pable.
The return of a consistent
ground game, the largest oltensive
question mark before the season,
has been a pleasant surprise this
season. Due in part to the emer
gence of freshman Kerry Carter as
a strong force in the back field, the
Cardinal has averaged 161.8 yards
per game on the ground, up from
the 75 yards-per-game average the
team posted last season.

One bright spot on the Cardinal
defense was the impressive pres
sure the team was able to put on
Kasteler. Senior cornerback Frank
Primus, in particular, sacked

Kasteler three times. All told, the
Cardinal defense got to Kasteler
seven times for a total loss of 54
yards.
The good news for the Cardinal
is that its potent offense will he
baek in full form following last
week's hye. The break gave I lusak
a chance to fully recuperate from
bruised rihs suffered against
UCLA. He missed the Cardinal s
game against San Jose State.
Add I lusak to senior wideout
Troy Walters — who broke the
Pac-10 career receiving record two
weeks ago with lKfi yards against
San Jose State, putting him at 3,340
for his career — and Stanford s air
attack becomes nearly unstop
pable.
The return of a consistent
ground game, the largest oltensive
question mark before the season,
has been a pleasant surprise this
season. Due in part to the emer
gence of freshman Kerry Carter as
a strong force in the back field, the
Cardinal has averaged 161.8 yards
per game on the ground, up from
the 75 yards-per-game average the
team posted last season.
