# Football looks to return to winning form
## Stanford hosts Beavers in homecoming battle 
### Ben Freda Editorial staff 
Against Oregon State on Saturday, Stanford's up
and-down football team will be looking to answer a
nagging question: is it Dr. Jekyll, or is it Mr. Hyde?
Most recently, Stanford (3-2, 3-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) looked distinctively Hyde-ish, turning in a
forgettable 44-39 loss to San Jose State two weeks
ago.

FOOTBALL
â–  Saturday: Stanford (3-2,3-0 Pacific 10 Conference) vs.
Oregon State 3-2,0-2), 2 p.m. Stanford Stadium

The loss came after three straight conference vic
tories that put the Cardinal in sole possession of the
Pac-10 lead.
Against Washington State, Arizona and UCLA,
Stanford's potent offense came out pumping, eating
up yards like candy and scoring feverishly. In those
three games, the Cardinal outscored opponents by a
total of 146-71. Even without senior quarterback
I'odd Husak, Stanford was able to rally behind red
shirt sophomore backup Joe Borchard to stun then-
No. 19 UCLA 42-32.
But a week later, the Cardinal looked sluggish on
offense and sloppy on defense, falling 44-39 to the
Spartans despite the fact that San Jose State was with
out standout running back Deonce Whittaker, who
led the NCAA in most running categories.
Given the nature of this season, does head coach
Tyrone Willingham wonder whether it will be Dr.
Jekyll or Mr. Hyde each week?
"It has nothing to do with the nature of the sea
son." Willingham said. "I always wonder what we're
going to get. And I think probably every coach
around the country would probably tell you the same
thing, that they're always wondering what's going to
show up."
Saturday, Stanford has another chance to be Dr.
Jekyll. Oregon State (3-2,0-2), which started the sea
son with three straight wins against nonconference
opponents, is coming off of a two-game losing streak
