West Valley is the nation's top
ranked team among community
colleges, and fans will he treated to
a fairly competitive scrimmage.

Stanford coach Dante Dettamanti
said players who usually see less
time in games should get the op
portunity for significant playing
time against West Valley.
The opening scrimmage will be
follwed by the featured match
against the IJC-Davis Aggies at 10
a.m. While the game will count to
ward the Cardinal's overall season
record, Davis is not a member of
the Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation.
This "isn't a pressure game,"
Dettamanti said.
On a downward slide in the
rankings, Davis has slipped from a

No. 17 ranking to No. 20, suggest
ing a fairly easy match for the Car
dinal. While Stanford should win,
Dcttamanti warns that Davis, his
alma mater, can not be overlooked.
The Aggies played a very strong
first half against the Cardinal in the
squads' one previous meeting this
season before Stanford pulled
away to a 17-6 victory. In Satur
day's game, Dettamanti would like
to see a quick start for the Cardinal.
After the Aggies, Stanford will
make an encore performance
against a team of stand-out alumni
