Stanford's second test comes
Sunday from Sacramento State.
The Cardinal boasted a 3-0 victory
over the Hornets last year and is
hoping for similar results Sunday.
The Hornets, however, are hardly
recognizable from last year's squad,
welcoming 15 newcomers, including
seven junior college transfers. One
newcomer, sophomore forward
Sean Luigs, has already made his
presence known and was named
MPS!' Player of the Week following
his performance at the Santa Clara
Soccer Classic at the end of Septem-

her.
Although Sacramento State has
posted only two wins this season, one
was a 2-1 overtime victory over San
Francisco during the Santa Clara
Soccer Classic, a team that defeated
Stanford 3-1 earlier this season.
Clark is confident that the team
can put together two full games and
come out with a successful week
end.
"Our biggest single asset is our
team spirit and team work. The lads
have come together very well as a
unit in spite of graduating seven
starters," Clark said. "As always, we
need to be prepared mentally and
physically for the hardest games of
the season. If we take this mental
approach we will play well."
