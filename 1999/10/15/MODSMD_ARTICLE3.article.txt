Complete with three-layered
chocolate raspberry cake, two choic
es of sun-ripened tomatoes and Stan
ford-labeled wine, last night's Alum
ni Dinner on the Quad kicked off the
much anticipated Reunion Hume
coming Weekend '99.
For the next three days, thousands
of Stanford alumni, dating back to the
Class of 1939, will be back on The
Farm to take part in numerous social
and intellectual activities.
With the help of a full-time staff of
eight people and over I,(XX) volun
teers, Leslie (iasner spent one year
coordinating activities for these ne\t
three days.
This year, members of each class
were invited to send in a page about
their experiences to create a class
book. According to (iasner, the new
idea of sending the class book to
every member of every class made
people feel closer to Stanford and
succeeded in making them want to
come back.
"This is the biggest program we've
ever taken a shot at." (iasner said.
"Every year it seems to get bigger and
bigger. This year, 40 percent of the
C lass of '89 attended."

The weekend's activities com
menced with an elaborate, live
course dinner in the cool night air. It
featured an address bv University

President Gerhard Casper and an
awards presentation to alumni who
have given generoush to the Univer
sity.
