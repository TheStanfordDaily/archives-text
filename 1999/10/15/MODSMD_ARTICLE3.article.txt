Complete with three-layered
chocolate raspberry cake, two choic
es of sun-ripened tomatoes and Stan
ford-labeled wine, last night's Alum
ni Dinner on the Quad kicked off the
much anticipated Reunion Hume
coming Weekend '99.
For the next three days, thousands
of Stanford alumni, dating back to the
Class of 1939, will be back on The
Farm to take part in numerous social
and intellectual activities.
With the help of a full-time staff of
eight people and over I,(XX) volun
teers, Leslie (iasner spent one year
coordinating activities for these ne\t
three days.
This year, members of each class
were invited to send in a page about
their experiences to create a class
book. According to (iasner, the new
idea of sending the class book to
every member of every class made
people feel closer to Stanford and
succeeded in making them want to
come back.
"This is the biggest program we've
ever taken a shot at." (iasner said.
"Every year it seems to get bigger and
bigger. This year, 40 percent of the
C lass of '89 attended."

The weekend's activities com
menced with an elaborate, live
course dinner in the cool night air. It
featured an address bv University

President Gerhard Casper and an
awards presentation to alumni who
have given generoush to the Univer
sity.

world, only a fraction of the 5,500
projected to attend this weekend.
"Being able to sit out on the Quad
with candles under the stars is just
magnificent," said Director of Donor
Relations Donna Robertson, who
coordinated the dinner. "But the din
ner is only the start. There is a myriad
of things planned for everyone to
have a great time — it only gets bet
ter as the week goes on."
Included in the weekend's events
are "Classes without Quizzes;" a
Convocation on Business moderat
ed by Charles Schwab (Class of '59)
and featuring Carly Fiorina (Class
of '76), the new CFO of Hewlett-
Packard; a Convocation on Law
moderated by three Stanford alum
ni currently serving as Supreme
Court Justices; a lunch with keynote
speaker California Governor Gray
Davis (Class of '64); and "All Right
Now." a swing dance that will be
held on the Quad on Saturday night.
The dance is open to all members of
the Stanford community.
Class meals, when each class will
go to separate tents to eat, will offer a
chance for alumni to catch up on old
times with old friends.
"One of the really nice things
about the mix of activity is that some
are just for your class," said Ann
Bender, Law School Class of '70.
1 iowever, she also expressed that the
mix of different classes in some
events allowed whole families who
went to Stanford to be together.
"There are activities for families
and people you've met through the
years," she said.

In a previous homecoming event.
Bender participated in "Classes
without Quizzes," lectures taught by
Stanford professors. Offered again
this year, these lectures provide the
opportunity for alumni to return to
the campus and gain knowledge
without having the stress of tests. Ac
cording to Bender, this experience
was very intriguing.
"Classes without Quizzes" isn't
the only event some look forward
to this weekend. Alumni have
come with all sorts of plans. Some
anticipate listening to great speak
ers.
Robert Austin from the Class of
'49 hopes to attend the Convocation
on Law. "1 want to see the Supreme
Court people," he said. "They're
conservative, they're my age — I like
them!"
Others look forward to a relaxing
weekend to catch up on old times.
With new structures and the re
opening of the museum and the Bing
Wing of Green Library, Stanford has
changed a great deal since the last
time many alumni visited. Coming
again has given them a very different
impression of the school.
"1 didn't even recognize it!"
Austin said. "None of these buildings
were here when 1 was."
However additions to the institu
tion have come with praise.
Clay MacLeod (Class of '79) and
Elizabeth Wohlford MacLeod
(Class of '80) visited the Cantor Cen
ter for the Visual Arts and said they
thought it was beautiful.
"It's great to appreciate how in
credible a place this is," Elizabeth
MacLeod said. "We took it for grant
ed when we were here, so when we
come back, it's just awesome."
