## Washington looking to restore civilian rule in Pakistan 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)
Despite declining U.S. influence in
Pakistan, the Clinton administration
is leaning on leaders of a military
coup in the South Asian country to
find a way to restore civilian rule.
Lacking a clear sign from Army
Gen. Parvaiz Musharraf of his inten
tions. President Bill Clinton directed
U.S. Ambassador William Milam to
confront the coup leader directly and
insist on civilian rule.
"We don't like it when military
leaders forcibly displace elected gov
ernments," Clinton said Thursday at
a White House news conference.
But within hours of the statement,
Pakistan's state-run news agency

said Musharraf had declared a state
of emergency, named himself chief
executive and dissolved Parliament.
Still, after meeting with the gener
al. Pakistani President Rafiq Tarar
said through a spokesman that the
general was seeking to restore civil
ian rule.
State Department spokesman
Jim Foley would not comment on
Musharraf's declaration, saying
Milam was to arrive in Pakistan in
the next few hours and would be
meeting with the general on Friday.
"He will be passing the message
that the United States continues to
believe that there should be a
prompt return to civilian rule and a

restoration of the democratic process
in Pakistan," Foley said.
Clinton acknowledged the Unit
ed States and Pakistan have had
their differences since the former
Cold War ally began pursuing its
nuclear ambitions in the 1970. That
ultimately led to a halt in U.S. arms
sales and other sanctions in 1990.
State Department spokesman
James Rubin said steps were being
taken to halt the small U.S. econom
ic assistance program of about $2
million a year. Funds for undelivered
jet fighter planes were released last
year.
But with Pakistan gaining nuclear
capability and Islamic fundamental

ism on the rise, the Clinton adminis
tration has limited leverage with
Musharraf, a 56-year-old army ehiel
said to be concerned about his coun
try's deteriorating economy.
I he International Monetary
Fund, however, could block loans to
Pakistan if it does not restore democ
racy. Release of $2SO million of a
$1.6-billion loan approved in IW 7
hangs in the balance.
In the meantime, Musharrai, who
ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
in a bloodless coup on Tuesday, has
not sent a clear signal of his inten
tions. I le declared a state of emer
gency Friday and named himself
chief executive, Pakistan's state-run

news agency announced.
( linton h; is sent a message
through Milam that Musharraf
should form a new constitutional
government.
Mindful ol tensions with India,
which have produced three wars in
the last half-century, Clinton also
said I hursday: "I would hope that
nothing would be done at this time to
aggravate those strained relations.
Contributing to the administra
tion's concern \\;is the Senate's rejec
tion Wednesday ol a treats to ban
nuclear weapons lesis.
Pakistan had promised to sign the
treaty il India did. But with the treaty
defeated, main analysts are eon

corned that the two countries could
decide to resume nuclear weapons
tests.
"Do not take yesterday's vote as a
sign that America doesn't care
whether you resume nuclear testing
and build up your nuclear arsenals."
Clinton said. "We do care. You
shouldn't do it. It's not necessary. It
will hurt your economy and endan
ger your future."
The administration inadvertently
may have contributed to the prime
minister's downfall when, in July,
Clinton pressured Sharif to have
Musharraf withdraw his forces from
the Indian-held side of the cease-fire
line in Kashmir.
