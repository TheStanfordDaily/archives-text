Some of the changes
alumni can expect in
the Stanford landscape

To Stanford alumni, family and
friends: welcome. I lomecom
ing Weekend is a special time
for all. Especially for our older alum
ni. it can he a time to revisit the old
haunts on campus.
Rut change is never a stranger to
the Farm; in fact, construction seems
like a permanent facet of the Stan
lord landscape. As you tour the cam
pus. you may notice some of the dif
ferences. 1 lere are some of the things
lo expect.
The Science and Engineering
Quad on the west side of the Main
Quad is on its way to completion, with
three of its four buildings in full use
now. ITie new Sequoia Hall was com
pleted in February 1998, returning the
statistics department to its home
across from the Math Corner of the
Main Quad. A month later, spring
classes were able to take advantage of
the state-of-the-art Teaching Center,
which oilers the Stanford community
two spacious lecture halls to replace
those lost when the Physics Tank was
torn down in 1997.
The most recent addition is the
David Packard Electrical Engineer
ing Building, which was completed at
the end of June. Visitors will appreci
ate the large windows and the natural
light that tills the hallways. ITie lobby
will be home to a new cafe and a set of
historical displays detailing the devel
opment of the electrical engineering
deaprtment and its relationship to Sil
icon Valley.
After four years of construction,
the Stanford Museum reopened this
January, rechristened the Iris and B.
(ierald ('antor ( enter for Visual Arts.

Renovated from damage incurred
during the Loma Prieta earthquake in
1989, the center now includes a
42,(XX)-square-foot wing that houses
additional galleries as well as the
McMurtry Family Terrace, an outdoor
sculpture garden on the second level.
As always, the statue of Athena greets
visitors as they enter the center; she
has survived both major earthquakes
of the 20th century. And as before,
admission to the museum is free.
This week, the 80-year-old west
wing of Green Library also officially
reopened its doors. Now known as the
Bing Wing, the five-story structure
displaced nearly a million volumes
when it was damaged by the 1989
earthquake. The renovations repre
sent a melding of the old architecture
with modern facilities. The Bing Wing
now conforms to current building
safety codes and includes extensive
electronic resources, including Inter
net access at nearly every seat in the
library. At the same time, much of the
library still looks as it did when it first
opened in 1919.
In the wake of these openings,
however, you will find that one famil
iar locale is temporarily closed. 'ITie
Coffee House, after 30 years of pro
viding music, caffeine and a study spot
for the Stanford community, is also
being rennovated. Apart from new
furniture, flooring and carpets, the
serving counter will be reoriented to
better distribute the How of traffic.
We have yet to discover to what
extent the new Collo will retain the
feel of the old one.
So between the Homecoming
football game and the Classes With
out Quizzes, the reunion barbecues
and the "All Right Now!" annual
swing dance, stop and take a minute
to tour the old and new sections of
the University.
