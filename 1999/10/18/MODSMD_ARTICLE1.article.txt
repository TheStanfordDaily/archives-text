Some things have changed at
Stanford since the early l%()s. ac
cording to California Governor
Gray Davis.
" The football team was 0-10,"
Davis. Class of 1964, told several
thousand fellow alumni at a Reunion
Homecoming Weekend luncheon in
Frost Amphitheater Friday. "My
diet consisted mostly of pizza and
beer."
But some things haven't changed.
"I'm glad to see that pizza and
beer is still a part of the diet of Stan
ford freshmen." the governor added
later, apparently forgetting Califor
nia's legal drinking age of 21 for a
moment.
Davis shed some of his trademark
wooden demeanor before the enthu
siastic visor-clad crowd.
"My wife said, 'You'll be speak
ing in front of a very sophisticated
crowd."' he said. "She said, 'Don't
try to be charming, witty or intellec
tual —just be yourself.' "
The governor ran through his
philosophy of government and his
accomplishments after 10 months in
office, with particular attention to
education.
"Californians are interested in
practical solutions, not adherence to
rigid ideology," he said.
Davis pointed to his recently
passed education reform package,
which includes peer reviews of
teachers and bonus money for
schools that improve standardized
test scores by five percent per year.

California Gov. Gray Davis came to Frost Amphitheater Friday to
speak on the state of education in California and in the nation. Last
spring, he delivered a speech titled "California and Asia: Partners
for the Future" in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
pie in education, he said, including
fellow Democrats.
Students suffer from a "culture of
lowered expectations," he said.
"Kids are talked out of taking alge
bra in Past Palo Alto, I lunters Point
and Watts."
As a result. they can't attend Stan
lord or the University of California.
"I don't care if you're the valedictori
an — algebra is a required class."
"I want to restore a rigorous acad
emic environment," Davis said.
Davis challenged his fellow alum
ni to tutor or mentor young people.
"Nothing matters more," he said.
"To those to whom much is given,
much is asked."
University President Gerhard
C 'asper introduced Davis, saying that
"another California governor. Ice
land Stanford, would applaud the
public service accomplishments of
this Stanford graduate."
Davis was scheduled to speak
shortly after 11:15 a.m., hut did not
take the stage until well after noon.
"The governor couldn't find a
parking space either," joked Bill
Stone, president of the Stanford
Alumni Association, while introduc
ing Casper.
Davis headed from Frost Am
phitheater to Gates Computer Sci
ence Building, where he signed an
executive order barring California
uovcrnmental agencies, state con

tractors or grant recipients from pur
chasing or using pirated software.
"We should be a moral exem
plar." Davis said, flanked by comput
er industry representatives as he
signed the order.
The state spends over $2 billion
on computing annually, while indus
try representatives said more than
$2.8 billion is lost to software piracy
each year in wages, sales and tax rev
enues in California.
Dan Bross, a state government af
fairs manager for Microsoft, ex
plained that state agencies can end
up purchasing pirated software un
wittingly, if the low bidder on a soft
ware contract is in business illegally.
Companies are not as worried
about one person sharing a program
as they are about mass counterfeiters
of software. Bross said.
"This is a huge organized crime
effort — unsavory characters making
millions per year," he said.
California is the second state to
have such an order, behind Nevada.
Davis wasn't the only famous
alumnus on campus for Reunion
I lomecoming Weekend.

Day O'Connor. Anthony Kennedy
and Stephen Breyer look part in a
