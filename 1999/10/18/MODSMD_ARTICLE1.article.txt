Some things have changed at
Stanford since the early l%()s. ac
cording to California Governor
Gray Davis.
" The football team was 0-10,"
Davis. Class of 1964, told several
thousand fellow alumni at a Reunion
Homecoming Weekend luncheon in
Frost Amphitheater Friday. "My
diet consisted mostly of pizza and
beer."
But some things haven't changed.
"I'm glad to see that pizza and
beer is still a part of the diet of Stan
ford freshmen." the governor added
later, apparently forgetting Califor
nia's legal drinking age of 21 for a
moment.
Davis shed some of his trademark
wooden demeanor before the enthu
siastic visor-clad crowd.
"My wife said, 'You'll be speak
ing in front of a very sophisticated
crowd."' he said. "She said, 'Don't
try to be charming, witty or intellec
tual â€”just be yourself.' "
The governor ran through his
philosophy of government and his
accomplishments after 10 months in
office, with particular attention to
education.
"Californians are interested in
practical solutions, not adherence to
rigid ideology," he said.
Davis pointed to his recently
passed education reform package,
which includes peer reviews of
teachers and bonus money for
schools that improve standardized
test scores by five percent per year.
