## Editorial Incidental or significant? 
### 
University must clearly
define policy regarding
intellectual property rights

ETTm week, ilie* faculty Senate
approved a new policy that regu
lates intellectual property rights
between the University and students.
Specifically, the Senate is concerned
about student work being applied to
outside entities lor financial gain. They
feel that when a patentable invention is
developed with a "significant use of
University resources," Stanford should
be entitled to part of the intellectual
property rights.
This is an understandable move for the
University. According to Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Umran Inan, chair of the
Committee on Research, the Senate wants
students to perform research without par
ticular regard for profit. The new policy
also keeps startup companies and large
corporations from taking unfair advantage
of Stanford's laboratories and faculty.
Now the Senate has to contend with
the problem of disseminating this policy
in a way that is accomodating to both
students and faculty. I here is a question
of where to draw the line between "inci
dental" and "significant" use of the Uni
versity's resources.
For example. Associate Dean of
Research Patricia Jones stated that the
use of a Stanford desktop computer qual
ifies as "incidental," whereas the use of a
laboratory is considered "significant."
However, computers at Stanford
range from the Macintosh computers in
Meyer Library to the powerful public
domain Silicon Graphics workstations
in Sweet Hall to the multiprocessor
mainframes in the Computer Science
Department's laboratories. At what
point does a computer's power cross the
line for the new policy?
We must also wonder about the role
of Stanford courses with regard to
entrepreneurism and intellectual prop
erty. Jones' and Provost John llen
nessy's position 011 things such as the
Stanford I echnology Ventures Program
and business-related dirccted-readiim

units with Economics professors is that
such work is "in the course of the stu
dent's University responsibilities" and
docs not reflect a conflict of interest.
However, STVP students will
undoubtedly make "significant" use of
Stanford's resources within their
coursework, and the program intends
for them to apply their ideas in the busi
ness world. This is certainly a conflict of
interest for the University if STVP stu
dents use Jones' statement as a loophole
for the new policy.
(iiven Stanford's location in the
startup culture that constitutes Silicon
Valley, it is only to be expected that the
number of cases of entrepeneurial inter
action will increase in the future.
In this context, it seems imperative
that the idea of "incidental resources"
should be more concretely defined by
the University. Unless the extent of
such resource usage is concretely
defined, it does not seem reasonable to
expect students to adhere to it.
In fact, beyond just laying down the
guidelines, the Senate should heavily
utilize the offices of Undergraduate
Research Opportunities (IJRO) and
Graduate Research to appropriately
inform students of the fine-print in the
new policies.
The proposed "Student's (iuidc to
Research at Stanford" is a good first
step. However, the Senate might want
to consider more thorough measures,
such as focused meetings with individu
al research groups that have
en t re pre ne uri a I pot enti a I.
Without such an initiative, students
will continue to have problems under
standing where they are crossing the
line in their projects, and legal battles
might end up being an inevitability.
In enforcing these intellectual proper
ty regulations, however, Stanford should
exercise cautious optimism. II such regu
lations become too restrictive, it may
cause students to have second thoughts
in openly sharing and nurturing their
ideas at the Farm. It would defeat the
purpose of a research university such as
Stanford if University citizens shy away
from utilizing its resources to transform
their ideas into reality.
