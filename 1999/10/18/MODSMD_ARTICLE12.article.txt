Facts are in the eyes of the
beholder
I lossam Hihmy's letter of Oct. 12 criticiz
ing U.S. foreign policy as "ferocious" cov
ered a broad range of items, but his charges
were closer to the facts than some of the
responses.
Michael Buckley's letter on 0ct.14
attempted to justify, though not deny,
Israel's aggressiveness by saying the Arab
nations were equally aggressive, starting with
their opposition to the I Inited Nations parti
tion plan of IIM7.l l M7.
However, what Buckley calls a "poten
tially manageable compromise between
Zionism and Pan-Arabism" was regarded by
Palestinians as the theft of land they had
inhabited for centuries. The partition plan
gave 53 percent of the land to the future Jew
ish state and 47 percent to the Palestinians,
even though the population was one-third
Jewish and two-thirds Palestinian.
In the ensuing fighting, a well-organized
Jewish army seized more of the territory, and
according to Israeli historians such as Benny
Morris and Hon Pappe, some 4(X).(XX) Pales
tinians were either terrorized or forced at
gunpoint to leave. A disorganized Arab
army invaded Israel in IIM<Nl l M<N in an effort to
win back the land seized by Israel beyond the
partition lines. The result was that Israel cap
tured almost all of the territory originally
granted to the Palestinians except for the
West Bank, which Jordan occupied until
Israel captured it in 1%7.
Contrary to Buckley. Egypt did not "insti
gate" the 1%7 war; Israel did. The Egyptians
did blockade the Straits of Tiran from Israeli
shipping, but even former Prime Minister

Mcnachcm Begin later admitted they did not
intend to go to war.
Nevertheless, on June ft Israel launched a
surprise attack, destroying the ligyptian posi
tions in the Gaza Strip and the Sinai. On
June X, Israel captured Syria's Golan
I Icights. According to a report by the Jewish
Telegraph Agency in the May 30 issue of the
Northern California Jewish Bulletin, Moshe
Davan, the commanding general of the time,
later said that invading Syria was one of the
most serious errors of his life.
The Bulletin article quotes an interview
published in the Israeli newspaper Yediot
Achronot in which Dayan says that .SO per
cent of the cross-border clashes between
Israel and Syria in the years before the war
were due to Israeli provocation. According
to Dayan, Kibbutz leaders pressured the
Israeli government to attack because they
hoped to annex the farmlands on the Golan.
Buckley's statement that the United
States maintains sanctions on Iraq because
Saddam Hussein "insists on carrying out
genocide against his nation's Kurdish minor
ity" is mind boggling. Iraq did attack the
Kurds when they sided with Iran in the war
between the two countries, but today it is
Turkey, a NATO ally and recipient of mili
tary aid, that persecutes its Kurdish minority.
The Turkish army has destroyed 3,(XX)
Turkish villages in the past 15 years, killed
more than 35.1 XX) Kurds and uprooted some
3 million of them, which is three times the
number of Kosovar Albanians expelled by
Serbia last spring. In any case, the sanctions
on Iraq are not hurting Saddam Hussein but
are killing the most vulnerable Iraqi people
the very young, the old and the pt*)r.
The UN oil-for-food program dies not

provide enough food because only 53 per
cent of the oil revenue goes for humanitarian
supplies, with the rest going to war repara
tions. Iraq is not allowed to import agricul
tural machinery, fertilizer or equipment to
repair its water treatment and sewage facili
ties. so hunger and disease are rampant in a
country that once had one of the highest
standards of living in the Middle East.
Last week the European Union agreed to
send $5 million worth of heating oil to two
Serb cities to help make up for the fact that
NATO bombing last spring destroyed
almost all of Serbia's power plants and
refineries. The United States strenuously
opposed the relief effort, just as it opposes
any easing pleasing of the plight of the Serb
people until they manage to overthrow Slo
bodan Milosevic.
U.S. policy in both Iraq and Serbia is
based on the cruel notion that cold, sick and
hungry people are able to overthrow power
ful leaders and should be punished indefi
nitely if thcv don't. Hossam Fahmy may have
overstated the case when he called the Unit
ed States a "ferocious beast," but he surely
had a point.

Online lecture notes harm
student-teacher relationships
In response to the article and editorial you
recently published about online lecture notes
companies. I have a few comments. Online
lecture notes provided by private companies
intrude in the relationships between students
and their teachers. Violations of copyrights

are not an argument here.
The case involving the I Iniversitv of Flori
da. which you mentioned, did not involve
copyright infringements but violations of the
Lanham Act pursuant Title 15 of the U.S.
Code on patents. The court in that case had
denied the University of Florida's motion for
summary judgment as to copyright infringe
ment. so that issue still remains undecided.
Your editorial stated that copyrighting of
lectures would be misguided because scien
tific nature is not meant to be kept secret.
True enough, but copyrighting does not per
tain to the substance but only the form in
which knowledge is transmitted.
In fact, the U.S. Constitution mentions
copyright explicitly in order to "promote the
progress of science" (art. 1. K). Professors
want to spread their knowledge as much as
they can. but only in w;iys they judge to be
appropriate. Clearly, the fact that lectures
are posted without permission violates a seri
ous sine qua non of academic freedom.
Additionally, students are negatively
affected because the notes companies lack
any kind of accountability in providing edu
cational materials. The most serious problem
with online notes is not copyright infringe
ment. but the loss of the autonomy and dig
nity that marks student-teacher relationship.
Copyrighting lectures is never an argu
ment. but it can be an instrument to safe
guard these rights, as could other constitu
tional ways. It is up to everybody concerned
to start testing those issues before the courts
and in the market of ideas.
