# The 						upward spiral
## You are not Adonis, but are you close? 
### 
Govind Dandekar

You're fat and out of
shape. Don't even
try to deny it. You
couldn't propel yourself
around Campus Loop in
less than an hour even it
you were assisted by I) a
pair of rollerblades 2)

Mario Andretti or 3) a rope tied to the back
bumper of a Ferrari Tcsterossa.
Your dietary habits can be described as
poor at best. The only substantial source
of fiber you've had recently is a cardboard
diorama of the food pyramid that your
Peer Health Educator shoved down your
esophagus at last Wednesday's house
meeting.
"What kind of idiot are you, Govind?
I low dare you impugn my unimpeachable
reputation?" you think as you examine your
self: a veritable picture of Adonis. You step
outside of I ressider Fitness, hastily discard
this useless article and walk into Jamba Juice
to order a Mark McGwire Madness! smooth
ie, complete with creatine and andro juice
boosts.
The cashier asks you for your name.
You snicker and respond with "Roscoe."
Of course, this isn't your real name, but
the ignorant plebian Jamba Juice worker
is too slow to figure out your clever little
ruse. While you wait for your smoothie,
you decide that in addition to being fit,
you also have a keen, nay, rapier wit. A
proud, Adonis-like smile crosses your
face.
We will now determine which one of us
has a more accurate image of your present
condition. I have constructed the following
scoring system in order to evaluate your gen
eral health practices (eating, sleeping, study

ing. etc.). You are expected to abide by the
Honor Code and Fundamental Standard.
You have 15 minutes to finish this qui/ (or
until the conclusion of the lecture you're in
right now. whichever comes first). Good
luck.
You eat three homemade meals a day
(+3O). You eat three square meals a day pre
pared by University Dining Services ( + 10).
You eat three square meals a day at Stern
Fate Nile (-10).
You have arranged your class schedule so
you can sleep through breakfast everyday
(+5). You have arranged your class schedule
so you can sleep through breakfast and lunch
everyday (-5). You have arranged your class
schedule so you can sleep through breakfast,
lunch and fall quarter (-20).
You often wake up at (+JS) and
quickly hop out of bed (+20") because vour
sheets are soaked with urine (-50).
You are hungry, and you have to pull an
all-nighter to study for tomorrow morning's
killer final. You head to Lyon's to study and
eat some toast (+10). You head to Happy
Donuts for its big tables and quiet atmo
sphere (-5). You head to Ernie's Liquor for
its big tables and quiet atmosphere (-15).
You head to the Meyer Library 24-hour
study room (-1 (K)).
You often consume more than 2.0(H) calo
ries a day because: you are training to quali
fy for the ()lympic swim team (+35). You are
training to qualify for the Ultimate Frisbee
Men's "B" Squad (+5). You are training to
"really kick some ass" in Dorm Assassins
(-10). You are training to "really kick some
ass" in your dormitory's next Goldencyc
tournament (you lost 100 points on the last
question, didn't you?)
Because of your verve and excitability:

you arc often mistaken for a run-through
of Big Game Gaieties ( + 100). You are
often mistaken for Mark Madsen ( + 15).
You are often mistaken for Tresidder
Union (-20).
You're often seen sprinting down Escon
dido Road (+2O) because you're two-and-a
half hours late to an academic activity (-5)
and it's finals week (1.0 GPA).
It's Friday, and you want to burn off some
stress. You drive to Tahoe and roar down
some double-blacks (+25). You head to a
party to dance the night away (+5). You
forcefully tap your foot to the nine gigabytes
of MP3s that you spent the week download
ing (-10).
You have a mysterious illness (-15). You
go to Cowell Student Health Center for
treatment (-35). The you
with "nothingmore than a case ofaCute ton
sillitis." prescribes you some antibiotics and
tells you to skip classes and take the day oil
(+5). Your tonsils were removed when you
were four ($1,000,000 malpractice settle
ment).
Scoring:
200+: You are indeed Adonis.
101-200: You are a more minor figure
from Greek mythology.
1-100: You are a Hardy Boy.
-100-0: You are a minor villain from a
I lardy Boys novel.
Anything else: You are Chet. the fat and
out-of-shape friend of the I lardy Boys.
