# Reality in small doses
## The 						trials and tribulations of an International student

Mariam Ali

Here at Stanford, the typical dinner
small talk invariably follows this
pattern:
"Hi, my name is Over-eager Freshman,"
says Over-eager Freshman a little nervous
ly-
"Mariam," I respond over a forkful of
overcooked pasta.
"So where are you from. Mariam?"
1 breathe deeply and respond, "Kuwait."
"Hold on, where?" Over-eager Fresh
man asks brightly.
"Kuwait."
Over-eager Freshman stares at me
blankly for a few minutes.
"Middle East. Gulf War." I prod him
from pity.
When Over-eager Freshman realizes at
long last that Kuwait is not in California, I
get a beaming grin and a stammered.
"Wow. Like, that is cool. Like, um, exotic!"
Then I am generally asked if I go to
school on a camel.

To be a "FOP" (Fresh Off the Plane) at
Stanford requires a lot of patience. The
price of being "exotic" is dumb questions,
long plane rides and intense culture shock.
I remember that Stanford seemed like an
alternate reality when I first showed up for
freshman orientation. First of all, everyone
was so friendly. I come from a culture where
one does not ever speak to a stranger unless
formally introduced, and here, people in
lines at the grocery store began conversa
tions. It took me weeks to realize that peo
ple were not trying to distract me in order to
steal my wallet.
My dorm social life also came as a sur
prise to my conservative sensibilities. The
incessant keg parties and vodka slurping
soirees were bad enough, but when 1 tried
to make hot chocolate in the kitchenette to
console myself and was kicked out because
marijuana cookies were being made, I
called home and begged to leave Stanford.
In retrospect, of course, I am glad my

parents categorically refused to let me bail
on college because Stanford turned out to
be a lot of fun.
One factor of Stanford life I have never
become reconciled to, however, is the long
plane rides that come with the territory. 1
mean the really long plane rides. The kind
that takes over 24 hours.
To return to my lovely desert home, for
example, I first have to fly to New York and
try to make my way through the gloomy
corridors of JFK airport with my two allot
ted pieces of checkable luggage.
A sprained back and five hours later, I
will be sitting on a plane to Germany.
Although 1 always have visions of sitting
next to some handsome, international hunk.
I invariably sit next to a chatty international
7-year-old instead. Billy or Francois or
whomever will sneeze on my food, steal my
dessert and try to snap my bra while 1 sleep.
1 assure you it is a delightful cultural experi
ence.

Once we international travelers arrive
safely at the Munich airport, we are locked
into a small room patrolled by troopers with
machine guns. Variations of this scenario
occur in all major European airports
because naturally anyone flying to the Mid
dle East is armed and dangerous.
One is not even allowed to leave the
"international lounge" for water or the
bathroom.
Finally, on board the plane for the last
10-hour stretch to Kuwait, I am generally
trapped in my seat by a drunken expatriate
worker who knows that once we fly into
Kuwaiti airspace, alcohol will cease to be
legal. By this time, my contact lenses have
super-glued themselves to my eyeballs and
my back is agonizingly achy.
I always cry when I get home. My par
ents think it is because I am glad to see
them.
So after my tirade you may be wondering
why I even bother returning to school at all.

Well, 1 do enjoy refuting damaging cul
tural stereotypes and informing my peers
that not all Arabs live in tents. It also
comes as a shock to many people that ski
ing down the pyramids is not actually a
vacation option for most normal human
beings.
The academics are far superior to what I
can find at home, and my friends are the
most amazing people 1 have ever met, in
any country. Then, of course, the weather is
far better than what I would be stuck with
anywhere else.
