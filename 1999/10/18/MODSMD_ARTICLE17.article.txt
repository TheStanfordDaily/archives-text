# First part of pool facility nears completion
## 
### Anthony Chiu Contributing writer 
This spring, recreational swim
mers and Stanford's powerhouse
aquatic sports teams hope to make
their homes in the new Avery
Aquatic Center.
The new Center will be an ex
pansion and renovation of the cur
rent deGuerre complex.
"The new pool will add flexibili
ty for training, recreational space
and the potential for hosting major
or international competitions," said
Dave Schinski, facilities project
manager for Stanford athletics.
Construction is currently in the
first of two phases. Phase One in
cludes the addition of a 50-meter
pool as well as the Maas Family
Diving Facility, a diving pool with
four springboards and a 10-meter
platform. Phase One should be
completed by spring quarter.
Phase Two will feature an en
larged competition pool to provide
a stadium-like facility for water
polo matches. Additional exterior
lighting will also allow for the possi
bility of night matches. It should be
completed seven to nine months
after the end of Phase One.
"It's going to be one of the best,
if not the best, facilities in the Unit
ed States," said men's water polo
coach Dante Dettamanti. "It will
definitely help with recruiting, but
the main thing is the competition fa
cility. No more portable bleachers
now we'll be able to lit 2,700 peo
ple in the stands."

The new aquatic center may
soon be the focus of national atten
tion. Dettamanti said the NCAA
has already contacted Stanford
about the possibility of hosting the
men's water polo national champi
onship. However, that will depend
on how soon the complex is com
pleted.
In addition to the changes in

aquatic facilities, the renovation
will also satisfy the needs of other
athletes. The deGuerre courts are
set to re-open in mid-November
with a vastly different look. Two of
the old racquetball courts have
been converted to International
squash courts, while one of the old
squash courts is set to become the
home of an indoor climbing wall fa-

cility, more than two years after its
approval by Stanford students in
the 1997 Spring General Election.
"It's cool that it's finally here for
people on campus to use, but it's
pretty sad that most of the people
who actually voted on it are not,"
said senior Michael Waldo, who
voted to approve the climbing wall
in IW.
