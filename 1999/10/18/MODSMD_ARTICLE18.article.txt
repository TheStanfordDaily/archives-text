# Play offers a fresh look at Gandhi's private life
## 
### Sameer Ahmed 
He is known as the apostle of
non-violence and as one of the most
influential people in the 20th centu
ry. Yet Mahatma Mohandas Gand
hi's family and personal life was as
turbulent as his struggle for Indian
independence. Banished in a drunk
en stupor from his mother's
deathbed, Gandhi's son, Harilal,
lived through chronic alcoholism
and philandering in the red-light dis
tricts of Delhi and Bombay.
This was the theme of Feroz
Khan's play, "Mahatma vs. Gand
hi," shown last Saturday night at
Memorial Auditorium. Breaking
new ground, "Mahatma vs. Gandhi"
gave people a glimpse into the pri
vate life and struggles of one of his
tory's most poignant figures.
Based on the novel Prakashno
Padcchayo, newspaper articles, let
ters exchanged between Harilal and
his father and the writings of Gand
hi family biographers, Harilal's story
and Gandhi's inability to transform
his son surprised audiences.
"The play offers a really new per
spective on Gandhi. Many Indians
haven't seen such a strong person
manifest himself in this different
light," said senior N. Raju Duvvuri.
"It definitely opened the eyes of
many people."
Presented to the Bay Area by In
dians for Collective Action (ICA), a
group dedicated to the "pursuit of a
secure life for every Indian," the
play served as a fund-raiser for the
Rejuvenate India Movement
(RIM).
"Feroz Khan, the play's director,
wanted to work with a non-profit or
ganization (ICA)," said Poonam
Kuruganti, one of three national co
ordinators for RIM. "Members of
ICA decided to use the proceeds
from the play to help RIM and
spread its awareness throughout the
Bay Area."

Founded in April 1999 by Dr.
B. V. Parameswara Rao, a social en
trepreneur from India, RlM's mis
sion is to create a more developed,
educated and prosperous India.
"RlM's major goal is to bring
about a change in India at the na
tional level," Kuruganti said. "Other
organizations are doing wonderful
work in India. But many people be
lieve this work is not manifesting
into a change on a national level."
Aimed at Indians in the United
States and others willing to help
their cause, the movement plans to
accomplish its goal by discussing the
problems of India, exploring possi
ble solutions for the regeneration of
India and enabling Indians to imple
ment those solutions.
Over the past four months, RIM
has held meetings in over 30 cities
across the United States. These con
ferences culminated in RlM's first
national meeting, which took place
in Ganges, Mich., from Aug. 21 -23.
RIM members initiated two pro
grams as a part of their movement,
the Cleanliness Campaign and the
Stimulated Volunteerism Program.
"As a part of the Cleanliness
Campaign, RIM is attempting to
bridge the gap between volunteers
in India who are evaluating its hy
giene problems and U.S.-based or
ganizations interested in imple
menting the program," said Kuru
ganti.
In addition, RIM created the
Stimulated Volunteerism Program
to help the full-time volunteers who
are already working in the slums and
villages of India.
"These volunteers need financial
support to make sure their basic
needs are taken care of," said Kuru
ganti. "With the support, they are
then able to give us a better insight
into the problems in India, because
our knowledge and vision of India is
limited by living in the United
States."
