Winning an NCAA title is some
thing that speaks of the strength
(both mental and physical),
courage, desire and talent of a
team.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING
â–  Friday: No. 3 Stanford 173. No. 13
Texas 127.

What does winning six NCAA
titles in nine years say about a
team? Perhaps something about
the devotion to a vision that each
member must have. A devotion
that is passed down from class to
class, so that eventually every
member of the team understands
what the team is striving for, and
what each member must contribute
to make this dream come true.
Perhaps this is what makes the
Stanford women's swimming and
Diving team one of the most suc
cessful and respected swimming
teams ever, producing swimmers
that go on to win Olympic gold
medals and set world records.
While the women have found

success in the past, they all know
that no new season comes with
guarantees for future success.
Thus, when the No. 3 Stanford
women's swim team opened its sea
son this past Friday with a dual
meet against No. 13 Texas, there
were more than likely a few pairs of
eyes watching to see how the
women would look in their season
debut; eager fans waiting to see
how their favorite athletes would
be faring after a whole year gone
by, and doubtful skeptics wanting
to see the smallest slip that would
mean the beginning of the end of
the Stanford swimming dynasty.
As sophmore Jessica Foschi ex
plained, "it is the first idea of where
you are." So. does the dynasty still
stand?
The answer is a resounding 'yes'.
The Stanford women beat the
Longhorns at deGuerre Pool this
past weekend, 173-127. Yet. they
did more than just win this meet,
thereby increasing their dual meet
home winning streak to 40. a tally
which dates back to the 1987-KK
season. They won all but three
events, and had eight provisional
NCAA qualifying marks made. All

this in the first meet.
All-American junior Misty
Hyman, who burst onto the Stan
ford scene two years ago, posted
the only automatic qualifying mark
for the Stanford team, winning the
200 butterfly in one minute, 58.2K
seconds.
Of course, she also met the pro
visional mark for the 100 butterfly
with a time of 55.16 en route to her
victory in this event.
Senior Catherine Fox. the
American record-holder in the 100
backstroke and the three-time
NCAA champion in the 50
freestyle, opened her senior year
with a win in both events, with
times of 55.03 in the backstroke and
23.65 in the free.
She also helped Stanford down
the Horns by almost 12 seconds in
the 400 freestyle relay. Senior
Gabrielle Rose joined I lyman and
Fox in the upperclassnian contin
gent. winning her two events, the
100 freestyle with a time of 51.12
and the 100 breaststroke with a
time of 1:04.79.
However, the "little" ones on
the team contributed to the win as
well. Foschi. who had been "a little

nervous to see where I was", fear
lessly stormed onto the scene, win
ning the 1.650 free with a time of
16:42.41 and the 50() freestyle with
a time of 4:54.12, both NCAA pro
visional qualifying marks.
Foschi was happy with her wins.
"I thought I swam really well. I was
ahead of where I expected to be."
she said.
Joining Foschi was another
sophomore. Sherry Ripple, who
won the 200 backstroke with a time
of 2:01.21 and the 400 individual
medley with a time of 4:23.41. both
of which were NCAA provisional
qualifying times.
Adding to the Stanford domina
tion was diver Kim Powers, a ju
nior. who won the three-meter
dive, and sophomore Siobhan
Cropper, who placed second be
hind Hyman in the 100 butterfly
and swam on the winning 400
freestyle relay team.
Yes, it is only one meet, and
NCAAs are still very far away. But,
after this weekend, it should be
clear that the Stanford women
swimmers are poised for the chal
lenge of proving to the nation that
they can still hold the crown.
