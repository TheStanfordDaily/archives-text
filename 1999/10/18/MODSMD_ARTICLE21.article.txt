dwelling on last week's unfortu
nate loss to UCLA, the women
came out ready to dominate this
week.

Oregon on Friday.
Not much time was needed for
the Stanford women to knock off
Arizona State (9-5. 5-3) on Thurs
day night in three games. 15-4. 15-
10. 15-6. Stanford hit .383 as a
team for the match, thereby never
allowing the Sun Devils to chal
lenge for control of the game.
Friday night was expected to he
the bigger challenge, as the Wild
cats are known for coming out
strong. Stanford freshmen fans
came out well equipped with face
and body paint, posters and rowdy
cheers for the nationally televised
event against the Arizona Wild
cats (11-5. 5-3). Fox Sports Net
caught the freshman class going
wild on tape as they rallied for the
spirit competition while watching
the women's squad overtake Ari
zona. 16-14. 15-4. 15-2.
The Wildcats maintained a lead
through most of game one before
Stanford was able to take control
of the match. The Cardinal kept its
new-found composure through
the second and third games in
order to sweep Arizona.
Senior middle blocker Kerri
Walsh kept moving up in the
record books on Thursday and
stepped into fifth place in the Stan
ford career record books for total
number of blocks (4()«S) and digs
(1,094). Walsh produced a fine dis
play of her multi-faceted game
against Arizona State, capping off

her performance with a triple
double of 10 kills. 11 digs and 12
blocks.
Freshman outside hitter Logan
Tom kept pace with Arizona
State's junior outside hitter
Amanda Burbridge with 17 kills.
Burbridge currently ranks fifth for
kills among the leaders of the Pac
-10. Stanford freshman outside hit
ter Lindsey Yamasaki posted a ca
reer-high 10 kills.
Middle blockers Sara Sandrik,
a sophomore, and Jennifer Det
mer, a junior, each racked up 10
kills for the evening as well. Det
mer was warmly received for her
outstanding efforts in her first
game back after being out the past
five weeks with a stomach injury.
Detmer tore and strained some
of her abdominal muscles while
competing earlier this season in
Texas.
Junior Lindsay Kagawa had an
other solid performance to add to
her consistent play with 58 assists,
her second-highest tally this sea
son.
The multitude of cheers on Fri

women dig deep and pull out a 16-
14 win with two consecutive big hits
at the end of game one.
As the cameras soaked up the
elated fans, the Stanford women's
volleyball team maintained its
composure and came out firing for
the last two games. The Cardinal
shut down the Wildcats 8-0 before
allowing them a point or even a
sideout.
"Arizona is an emotionally dri
ven team, and once we brought
them down, it was all over," said
Detmer.
Game three became increasing
ly one-sided as Stanford only let up
two points to Arizona the entire
game. Stanford's wall of defenders
nailed Arizona in game three with
five blocks.
Strong defense on Stanford's

part took the Wildcats apart and
forced them to scrap for an unat
tractive attack hitting percentage
of minus-.129. Stanford's consis
tently high attack percentage once
again scaled the .300 mark at .327.
Tom led the Cardinal with an
other outstanding show, including
16 kills. Walsh contributed 11 kills,
10 digs and five blocks.
After the trying first game, head
coach Don Shaw pointed out to his
players that the Wildcats lacked va
riety in their repertoire and consis
tently relied on their setter's
prowess. Detmer explained, "We
focused on serving tough in order
to get their setter out of the game.
By forcing other people on their

14 win with two consecutive big hits
at the end of game one.
As the cameras soaked up the
elated fans, the Stanford women's
volleyball team maintained its
composure and came out firing for
the last two games. The Cardinal
shut down the Wildcats 8-0 before
allowing them a point or even a
sideout.
"Arizona is an emotionally dri
ven team, and once we brought
them down, it was all over," said
Detmer.

two points to Arizona the entire
game. Stanford's wall of defenders
nailed Arizona in game three with
five blocks.
Strong defense on Stanford's

part took the Wildcats apart and
forced them to scrap for an unat
tractive attack hitting percentage
of minus-.129. Stanford's consis
tently high attack percentage once
again scaled the .300 mark at .327.
Tom led the Cardinal with an
other outstanding show, including
16 kills. Walsh contributed 11 kills,
10 digs and five blocks.
After the trying first game, head
coach Don Shaw pointed out to his
players that the Wildcats lacked va

tently relied on their setter's
prowess. Detmer explained, "We
focused on serving tough in order
to get their setter out of the game.
By forcing other people on their
team to set. we eliminated their of

Next week's performances will
be paramount for the Cardinal, as
it faces No. 3 Pacific and sentimen
