Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
3, Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo (3-7-2,
0-1-1)2.
■ Sunday: Stanford 1, Sacramento
State (2-11,0-2)0.

"It fell great." Rust said on his
game-winner. "I had a couple of
chances early on and I knew if 1 was
going to get another chance it was
going into the back of the net."
The victory over Sacramento
State (2-11. 0-2) followed a 3-2 win
by the Cardinal on Friday over Cal
Polv-San I.uis Obispo (3-7-2.0-1 -1).
Against Sacramento State, the
Cardinal dominated the game, out
shooting its opponent 15-4, but it
couldn't seem to finish. Threats
came early on as junior midfielder
Scott Leber bounced a shot off the
crossbar and the explosive duo of

Rust.and junior forward Corey
Woolfolk kept the 1 lornet defense
busy.
The most notable and controver
sial of Stanford's opportunities
eame 2N minutes into the first half as
a shot off the head of sophomore de
fender Lee Morrison found its way
into the back of the net, but an off
sides call on Rust kept the goal off
the scoreboard.
While the offense was doing their
job up front, the solid defense of
Morrison, Davis, redshirt junior
Chris Gores and senior Andy 1 ledi
me rich did its in the back, shutting
down the Hornet attack.
"We were winning a lot of air
balls and we weren't giving up much
in the back, which is important, be
cause you can't give up goals if
you're going to win," said Rust.
So what took the Cardinal so long
to pul the game away?
"l! was just a mattei of settling
down," head coach Bobby Clark
said. Before overtime play began,
Clark tried to spark the final charge
the men would need to secure the
victory by reminding his team. "If
we don't win this game, we don't de
serve to win the MPSF."
Apparently the pep talk worked,
and a minute later the game was
over.
"Soccer is a game of patience."
junior defender Ryan Nelsen said.
"You can dominate the whole game
and still not score. You have to dig in
and keep battling. All the 50/50
balls we won and the dirty work we
did finally made the difference."

It was a different game Friday
night as Stanford struggled to domi
nate the Mustangs.
"It was an intense, aggressive,
fast-paced game." redshirt freshman
defender Taylor Graham said.
"We're not pleased with our perfor
mance. but we're pleased with our
result."
Again Stanford created opportu
nities. led by Leber with five shots
and an assist, but it was Cal Poly who
made it on the scoreboard first.
Eighteen minutes into the game, se
nior midfielder Rob Helm found
sophomore forward Anthony
Dimcch who shot in his team-lead
ing fifth goal of the season.
Stanford answered 13 minutes
later as Morrison set up a cross from
senior midfielder T.K. Inbody that
deflected off a Mustang defender
and put Stanford on the scoreboard
for a I - I tie at halftime.
At the beginning ol ihe second
half. Stanford came ou' firing, i';
redshirt junior Brandon Garinger
popped in his fourth and fifth goals
of the season within the first two
minutes. Assists came from Davis
and Leber.
"[At halftime J in the locker
room, coach said we'll get three or
four more chances and we've got to
put them away." Garinger said.
"[The two goals] took the pressure
off. but we got too content and we
got outworked, so it was a positive
and a negative wrapped up into
one."
Sure enough, !7 minutes later,
comfortable in its two-goal lead, the
Stanford men let a shot by senior
forward David Yosso slip by senior
keeper Adam Zapala.
"We played very well in the first
half, and when we opened the sec
ond half, things looked really rosy,"
Clark said. "But after our two goals
they either stepped up or we lost it a
bit. They carried the momentum
and the goal they got was deserved."
Luckily for the Cardinal, any
other Mustang attempts were
thwarted by its strong defense. Al
though Gores was forced to sit out
after suffering a facial injury in the
first half, Graham came in and kept
the Cardinal powerful in the back.
Garinger noted the solid perfor
mances of Graham, Hemmerich,
Nelsen and Zapala as crucial to
Stanford success.
The Stanford men will take the
win, but hope to improve their per
formance as conference play contin
ues.
As Clark said, "It was an exciting
game, but I felt we could've made it
less exciting. We've got to learn
from it and apply it to similar situa
tions."
