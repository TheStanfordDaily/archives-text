### Erin Bouchier Contributing writer 
The No. 3 men's water polo team
performed an iron man of sorts this
Saturday, playing three consecutive
games in a little over three hours.

MEW'S WATER POLO
■ Saturday: No. 3 Stanford (14-2) 11.
West Valley Community College 10.
■ Saturday: Stanford 17, UC-Davis
(6-13) K.

In the day's only official game,
the Cardinal took on the No. 20 Ag
gies of UC-Davis. The Aggies
proved no match for the Cardinal as
Stanford earned a 17-8 victory be
hind the firepower of the squad's
five seniors: Sean Joy (four goals),
Brian Heifferon (two). Andy Wal

burger (two). Mike Lipinski (two)
and John Skaalen (one).
Unlike its previous showing
against the Aggies. Stanford put the
game out of reach early, taking a 4-0
lead after just three minutes of play.
Davis was able to close the gap to
three points three different times, at
4-1 in the first and 7-4 and in the
second.
But in the third quarter, Stanford
silenced any Aggie hopes for a
comeback, blanking Davis 5-0 off
three points from junior Peter C)s
born, one from redshirt sophomore
Pasi Dutton and one from Joy.
In all. eight different Cardinal
players scored while 16 (everyone
except for redshirt sophomore Mark
Aniott. who did not play due to ill
ness) enjoyed some playing time.
While Stanford coach Dante
Dettamanti was particularly happy

lei see all of the healthy members of
the squad play, he was a little frus
trated with team defense. "We
played well enough to win it."he
said, "but I was disappointed that we
allowed too many goals, especially
allowing six in the first half."
However. Dettamanti admitted
that the high number of goals al
lowed might "just be a matter of us
being tired not resting this week
and playing three games in one
day."
Indeed, the Stanford squad was
tired after playing an early morning
scrimmage against the nation's top
junior-college team. West Valley
College of Saratoga. Calif. The West
Valley squad may have been
stronger than the Aggies, giving the
Cardinal a much tougher match.
