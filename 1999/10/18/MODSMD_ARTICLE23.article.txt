# Polo breezes through weekend
## Stanford picks up wins over West Valley, UC-Davis 
### Erin Bouchier Contributing writer 
The No. 3 men's water polo team
performed an iron man of sorts this
Saturday, playing three consecutive
games in a little over three hours.

MEW'S WATER POLO
■ Saturday: No. 3 Stanford (14-2) 11.
West Valley Community College 10.
■ Saturday: Stanford 17, UC-Davis
(6-13) K.

In the day's only official game,
the Cardinal took on the No. 20 Ag
gies of UC-Davis. The Aggies
proved no match for the Cardinal as
Stanford earned a 17-8 victory be
hind the firepower of the squad's
five seniors: Sean Joy (four goals),
Brian Heifferon (two). Andy Wal

burger (two). Mike Lipinski (two)
and John Skaalen (one).
Unlike its previous showing
against the Aggies. Stanford put the
game out of reach early, taking a 4-0
lead after just three minutes of play.
Davis was able to close the gap to
three points three different times, at
4-1 in the first and 7-4 and in the
second.
But in the third quarter, Stanford
silenced any Aggie hopes for a
comeback, blanking Davis 5-0 off
three points from junior Peter C)s
born, one from redshirt sophomore
Pasi Dutton and one from Joy.
In all. eight different Cardinal
players scored while 16 (everyone
except for redshirt sophomore Mark
Aniott. who did not play due to ill
ness) enjoyed some playing time.
While Stanford coach Dante
Dettamanti was particularly happy

lei see all of the healthy members of
the squad play, he was a little frus
trated with team defense. "We
played well enough to win it."he
said, "but I was disappointed that we
allowed too many goals, especially
allowing six in the first half."
However. Dettamanti admitted
that the high number of goals al
lowed might "just be a matter of us
being tired not resting this week
and playing three games in one
day."
Indeed, the Stanford squad was
tired after playing an early morning
scrimmage against the nation's top
junior-college team. West Valley
College of Saratoga. Calif. The West
Valley squad may have been
stronger than the Aggies, giving the
Cardinal a much tougher match.
Playing without the five seniors,
Stanford prevailed 11-10. The scrim
mage provided an ideal opportunity
for playing time for some of Stan
ford's non-starters. Redshirt fresh
men Brian Darrow and Nathan All
dredge and redshirt sophomore
Kendall Benson got a great deal of
playing time "and played very well,"
according to Dettamanti.
After playing West Valley and
Davis, Stanford took on an alumni
team of about 30 players with "guys
from just about every team since
I've been at Stanford," according to
Dettamanti, who has been has been
coaching at Stanford since 1977. In
an entertaining and certainly not
very closely refereed game, the
alumni "beat" the varsity 13-10.
The competition was stiff, and
the taunting began early. Starting
for the alumni were five members of

the 1993 NCAA Championship
squad, including Olympians Wolf
Wigo and Jeremy Laster. Also on
the alumni squad were the four best
goalkeepers in the history of Stan
ford water polo, John Gansell, Todd
Kemp, Larry Bercutt and Chris
Aguilera, who all came in at once to
play defense against the varsity in a
man-down situation.
Highlights from the game includ
ed a two-point goal from behind
mid-pool by sophomore Onno
Koclman, cameo appearances in the
goal by I leifferon and in the field by
redshirt sophomore Arik Goodman
and Aguilera, alumni attempts to
boost their chances by putting eight
or nine players in the pool at once,
and announcing by redshirt fresh
man Jaison Robinson, at the ex
pense of the resting Amott.
The day's three games proved an
ample test for the Cardinal's stami
na and depth and served as good
tuneup before Saturday's game
against No. 1 I ISC.
