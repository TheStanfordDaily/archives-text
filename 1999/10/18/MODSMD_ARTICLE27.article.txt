FOOTBALL
■ Saturday: Stanford (4-2.4-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) 21 Oregon State
(3-3,0-3) 17.

But despite a messy day, things
cleared up for Stanford, the Cardinal
winning 21-17 in a game that went
down to the last 24 seconds.
I he Cardinal's 4-0 conference
record means that the team is in the
driver's seat for the league title —
and the unmentionable bowl-game
berth that goes with that honor.
"I think this was a critical game for
us," head coach Tyrone Willingham
said. "I think that if you can get to 4-0
in the conference, it could give you
some distance between other peo
ple."
In fact, the win means that the
Cardinal is out in front of the rest of
the Pac-10 by a full game and a half,
which is heartening to a Stanford
team that embarks next week on a
three-game road swing to USC.
Washington and Arizona State.
The fact that the Cardinal used
Saturday's game to establish domi
nance in the conference is a touch
ironic, given the way the team barely
escaped Oregon State, a squad that
lias seen the last 2 l ) seasons go by
without earning a winning record.
Before the game, Willingham re
marked that the Beavers had trouble
with turnovers early in the season,
and the Cardinal hoped to capitalize
on that. I lowever, ii was the ('ardinal
who looked clumsy, giving up two in
terceptions and two fumbles in the
first half.

It Icll to third-string sophomore
running back Brian Allen to put the
team back into the game late in the
fourth quarter with touchdown runs
of 20 and M yards. I le finished the
game with nine carries for W yards.
And in the end. a gutsy intercep
tion by senior corncrback Frank
Primus was necessary to seal the vic
tory with 24 seconds left. Primus
pieked off a pass by Beavers quarter
back Jonathan Smith at the five-yard
line and weaved his way up the side
line to the 34 before he was pushed
out of bounds.
"It |the win | means the world."
Primus said. "It gives us added confi
dence and momentum continuing
through the season. It's what's sup
posed to happen."

For Ihc Cardinal, the first half was
utterly forgettable. Kerry Carter, a
true freshman who has become the
anchor of this season's running game,
fumbled twice inside the 10.
Senior quarterback Todd I lusak
threw two interceptions. And as if
fate conspired to doom all three of
the Cardinal's offensive leaders, se
nior wideout Troy Walters was
slowed by a stomach virus that kept
him out for most of the game. Wal
ters finished the game with only three
receptions.
The result: the ( ardinal was down
7-0 by halftime.
And in the second half, it was the
defense that first got the fires burning
under the Stanford team. ()n ()regon
State's first possession, the team

threatened to break the game open,
driving towards the end /one and
earning a first down on the Stanford
eight-yard line.
After a loss of one yard on a run
and then an incomplete pass, the
Beavers completed an eight-yard
pass, falling just short of the end/one.
setting up a fourth-and-one at the
goal line.
But they were' stuffed.
"We were definitely excited."
linebacker Sharcus Stcen said. "I
think when (we] get in that situation,
we feel like it's our play to make. It's
just another proving ground for us."
Then, the two touchdown runs by
Allen, the last one with 3 minutes. 45
seconds left on the clock, put the Car
dinal in the win column.

Beavers. Allen averaged 11 yards per carry on the day, including the game-winning touchdown run.

Redshirt sophomore punter Sean Tolpinrud rears back to send the ball into orbit, an action he has not
performed often as the Cardinal's offense has rarely needed him.

Wide receiver Deßonnie Pitts blows past the Oregon State secondary, a feat he accomplished effectively
on more than one occasion against the Beavers. Pitts scored early in the second half as he and senior
quarterback Todd Husak connected for a touchdown pass of 41 yards.
