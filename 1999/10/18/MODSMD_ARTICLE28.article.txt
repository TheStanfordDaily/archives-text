# Allen stands out in crowded backfield
## Running back makes presence felt with performance against OSU 
### Tim Kane 
Brian Who?
People won't be saying that for
much longer if Brian Allen, the
sophomore running back wearing
jersey No. 34, has more games like
he did on Saturday.
Running with an explosive style
that contrasts with his low-key de
meanor, Allen has emerged to give
the Cardinal another threat to com
plement the offense's powerful
passing attack. In limited duty,
Allen has shown in recent weeks
that he posseses the necessary speed
and agility to be a successful tail
back in the PacificlO Conference.
With Stanford trailing 10-7 in the
fourth quarter, Allen ripped off a
20-yard touchdown run through the
right side to put the Cardinal up 14-
10 with 6:33 left in the game. After
Oregon State struck back seconds
later with a 69-yard touchdown
pass, Allen took off on a 37-yard
scoring run nearly identical to the
first, putting Stanford up for good.
21-17.
"1 thought it was spectacular the
way he stepped up and made the big
play, and the way he ran with great
physical determination, and also
quickness and speed," Stanford
head coach Tyrone Willingham
said.
The Cardinal running game
hadn't exactly beaten the Beavers
into submission when Allen made
his impact in the final quarter.
Freshman Kerry Carter, the starter,
had two fumbles inside the OSU 10-
yard line, and after a couple of good
runs early had not been able to pen
etrate the Beaver defense. Coy
Wire met with similar luck in his at
tempts, a prime reason Stanford
scored only once through three
quarters of play — its one touch

down coming on a long pass play to
Deßonnic Pitts.
Enter Allen. After two carries in
the first quarter, he did not see any
action at running back until the be
ginning of the fourth quarter be
cause the other backs had failed to
establish a presence on the ground.
Allen came into the game and ran
for six and 14 yards before taking off
on his first touchdown. After Ore
gon State's drive stalled. Allen ran
the ball two more times prior to the
37-yard run that put Stanford on
top. Allen finished with nine carries
on the day for 99 yards, not a bad
day's work considering he only
played significantly in one quarter.
Stanford quarterback Todd
Husak certainly came away im
pressed. "That's one of the best per
formances by a running back since
I've been here. For him to step up
like that, in crunch time, shows
everyone that he can be that type of
player for us," said Husak. "I think
it's good for his confidence, and it
helped our team win today, so it was
nice to see."
Lest anyone think Allen's per
formance came completely out of
nowhere, the sophomore had de
cent showings in the previous two
games against UCLA and San Jose
State, gaining 89 yards on just 10
carries in those two contests. Un
doubtedly, Willingham and offen
sive coordinator Bill Diedrick will
design the game plan to take advan
tage of Allen's speed up the middle
and off tackle.
When asked about getting Allen
more carries in the next game, Will
ingham appeared to crack a grin as
he said nonchalantly, "There's a
chance."
If Saturday was any indication,
Allen will make sure everyone
knows his name next time.
