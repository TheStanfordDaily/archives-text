Members of the graduate stu
dent eating club Breakers ex
pressed concern in a meeting on
Friday night about a possible in
crease in their dining fees with the
hiring of a cook.
General Manager of the Eating
Clubs Aaron Williamson an
nounced last week that a profes
sional cook may be hired, which
would change the cooperative
club into a self-operated club. Al
though a cook will increase fees,
Williamson hopes it will also at
tract new students to the club's
lagging membership.
"[Breakers' Business Manag
er! Alberto [Makino] approached
me and said he needed help in
providing for Breakers,"
Williamson said. "There aren't

enough students to run the club,
so he said he needed to hire a cook
to help out."
However, Makino, who works
at Breakers on a volunteer basis
and is a lecturer in the Depart
ment of Mechanical Engineering,
said he thought a cook would
"completely change the co-op at
mosphere that many students
enjoy."
Graduate students comprise 40
percent of the Toyon eating clubs'
membership. While Williamson
has had to deny a meal plan to
over 40 graduate students seeking
membership in the other eating
clubs, which are packed with ap
proximately 130 members each.
Breakers' low membership of
only 20 students is a financial
strain on the business, according
to Williamson.
"We're a non-profit business. I
don't want it to come down to

money, hut I still have to watch
the numbers," said Williamson.
"Breakers has lost money or
broken even for the past 10 years,
at the very least," he said. "Break
ers is not a good business opportu
nity and that's not due to misman
agement. It has to do with trying
to give the cheapest price to stu
dents. But we are very sensitive to
graduate students' needs, espe
cially those coming in internation
ally, so we try to keep food costs
down. The price of Breakers,
however, is ridiculously rock-bot
tom, and it's not paying for its
overhead. The VS75 bill per stu
dent pays for the food manager's
salary and the cost of food."
Williamson originally planned
to have a cook instated in the club
by today; however, due to student
reactions. Williamson has
