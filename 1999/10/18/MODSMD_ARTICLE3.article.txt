# Breakers co-op may hire cook
## Budget, membership crunch could force fee increase 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Sarah Rapawy Editorial staff 
Members of the graduate stu
dent eating club Breakers ex
pressed concern in a meeting on
Friday night about a possible in
crease in their dining fees with the
hiring of a cook.
General Manager of the Eating
Clubs Aaron Williamson an
nounced last week that a profes
sional cook may be hired, which
would change the cooperative
club into a self-operated club. Al
though a cook will increase fees,
Williamson hopes it will also at
tract new students to the club's
lagging membership.
"[Breakers' Business Manag
er! Alberto [Makino] approached
me and said he needed help in
providing for Breakers,"
Williamson said. "There aren't

enough students to run the club,
so he said he needed to hire a cook
to help out."
However, Makino, who works
at Breakers on a volunteer basis
and is a lecturer in the Depart
ment of Mechanical Engineering,
said he thought a cook would
"completely change the co-op at
mosphere that many students
enjoy."
Graduate students comprise 40
percent of the Toyon eating clubs'
membership. While Williamson
has had to deny a meal plan to
over 40 graduate students seeking
membership in the other eating
clubs, which are packed with ap
proximately 130 members each.
Breakers' low membership of
only 20 students is a financial
strain on the business, according
to Williamson.
"We're a non-profit business. I
don't want it to come down to

money, hut I still have to watch
the numbers," said Williamson.
"Breakers has lost money or
broken even for the past 10 years,
at the very least," he said. "Break
ers is not a good business opportu
nity and that's not due to misman
agement. It has to do with trying
to give the cheapest price to stu
dents. But we are very sensitive to
graduate students' needs, espe
cially those coming in internation
ally, so we try to keep food costs
down. The price of Breakers,
however, is ridiculously rock-bot
tom, and it's not paying for its
overhead. The VS75 bill per stu
dent pays for the food manager's
salary and the cost of food."
Williamson originally planned
to have a cook instated in the club
by today; however, due to student
reactions. Williamson has
planned future discussions with
students before a final decision is
reached. Williamson's proposal to
hire a cook for Breakers was ap
proved by the Eating Clubs Board
of Directors.
However, he did not consult
Breakers' members before making
the decision.
"I thought people would appre
ciate less work." he said. "If I had
known the reaction would have
been negative, I wouldn't have
acted on it. 1 felt there was a sense
of urgency in alleviating Alberto's
workload as immediately as possi
ble."
While Stanford Eating Clubs
Inc. would pay for the added cost
of a cook this quarter, board fees
would increase during winter and
spring quarters.
II Breakers increased member
ship to 50 students, fees would in
crease by $K0; this fee would cover
the traditional 24-hour kitchen ac
cess.
Current members questioned
why their membership is so low at
the Friday meeting.
Makino said that there is a great
deal of competition among clubs to
attract members, which partly ac
counts for Breakers' low numbers.
"Other eating clubs have eating
associates who may buy half-meal
plans for $300. less than Breakers'
full meal plan (at $575)," Makino
said. "Our club is structured as
such that we don't target the usual
eating club membership."
Williamson also said, "Breakers
has a reputation ol food being so
so. and you have to cook. It's the
only club we send out livers and
advertise exclusively for."
John Montgomery-Brown, a
master's student in civil and envi
ronmental engineering, however,
said the "meals have been fine,"
and that the "small groups making
food have created a friendly at
mosphere."
Williamson said that Stanford's

"limited supply" of on-campus din
ing options for graduate students
puts "pressure on the eating clubs
to provide for their needs."
Montgomery-Brown said that if
the Breakers' price increase is too
much for his budget, he is at this
point unsure of what other options
to consider.
"I live in Crothers Memorial,
where we already had our kitchen
lottery, which allots 50 spaces to
students," Montgomery-Brown
said.
"I didn't apply because I
thought I would be eating at
Breakers. I can't cook at Crothers'
kitchen now if I decide to leave
Breakers, and there aren't many
other cheap options around," he
added.
As well as the price increase,
members worry that they will lose
the social environment of the club.
"I think bringing in a profes
sional cook will change the atmos
phere. We're more than 75 percent
international students; there's a
homey appeal of nice people who
cook for each other.
"The other clubs are filled with
small groups of friends who don't
want to talk to anyone," said Jessi
ca Tom. a master's student in Me
chanical Engineering.
"A huge part of Breakers is
putting in work to reduce costs,"
she said.
Williamson said that il mem
bers do not want a cook, then the
club will be left as a co-op this
quarter, but action must be taken
in the future to increase member
ship.
"Historically, Breakers begins
the year with around 5(1 members,
and enrollment drops to around 40
winter and 30 spring," said
Williamson.
Students cite dissatisfaction
with food quality and cooking and
hashing responsibilities as reasons
for leaving, according to
Williamson.
Williamson also told members
that plans are not definite, and the
group discussed other possible
ways to increase membership.
