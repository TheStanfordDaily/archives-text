Kartar Singh Duggal. renowned Sikh poet, playwright
and author, presented the inaugural talk ol'Sanskriti's Re
ligions of South Asia Lecture Series to a crowd of about
>0 last Friday.
His lecture, entitled "Sikhism and Indian History,"
covered the fundamentals of Sikh religion and gave an in
depth look at the history of Sikhism and its ties to the more
general topic of Indian history.
Duggal's lecture was arranged by the C onsulate (Jen
eral of India, in conjunction with Rafiq Dossani. a con
sulting professor at the Institute for International Studies.
Duggal was scheduled to speak at the Asian Art Museum
of San Francisco on Oct. 17 as part ol the museum's "I he
Arts of the Sikh Kingdoms" exhibit.
Many students were unfamiliar with the Sikh religion
and appreciated Duggal's focus on the basics of the reli
gion.

"I admit, most of what I've known of Sikhism centers
on its connection to the Indira Gandhi assassination." said
Rajen Desai. a sophomore. "I knew nothing of its religion
or history. Duggal not only explained his faith clearly, but
confirmed the unity of I lindus and Sikhs. And. honestl\
that was comforting to know."
Kaushik Mukhcrjec, one of Sanskriti's co-chairs, said
he agreed.
"I found meeting Prof. Duggal and listening to his
speech to be very enlightening. I think that the audience
definitely gained something from their attendance," he
said.
During the i|uestion-and-answer period directly fol
lowing his talk. Duggal spoke more about his own work
and addressed the religious conflict that has plagued India
through much of this century.
"We are all one." Duggal said. " There is no I lindu. no
Muslim. That culture has to be brought back."
