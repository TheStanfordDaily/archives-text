# Sanskriti brings Sikh poet to Stanford
## Lecture touches on religion and strife, politics and peace 
### Nadira Hira Contributing writer 
Kartar Singh Duggal. renowned Sikh poet, playwright
and author, presented the inaugural talk ol'Sanskriti's Re
ligions of South Asia Lecture Series to a crowd of about
>0 last Friday.
His lecture, entitled "Sikhism and Indian History,"
covered the fundamentals of Sikh religion and gave an in
depth look at the history of Sikhism and its ties to the more
general topic of Indian history.
Duggal's lecture was arranged by the C onsulate (Jen
eral of India, in conjunction with Rafiq Dossani. a con
sulting professor at the Institute for International Studies.
Duggal was scheduled to speak at the Asian Art Museum
of San Francisco on Oct. 17 as part ol the museum's "I he
Arts of the Sikh Kingdoms" exhibit.
Many students were unfamiliar with the Sikh religion
and appreciated Duggal's focus on the basics of the reli
gion.

"I admit, most of what I've known of Sikhism centers
on its connection to the Indira Gandhi assassination." said
Rajen Desai. a sophomore. "I knew nothing of its religion
or history. Duggal not only explained his faith clearly, but
confirmed the unity of I lindus and Sikhs. And. honestl\
that was comforting to know."
Kaushik Mukhcrjec, one of Sanskriti's co-chairs, said
he agreed.
"I found meeting Prof. Duggal and listening to his
speech to be very enlightening. I think that the audience
definitely gained something from their attendance," he
said.
During the i|uestion-and-answer period directly fol
lowing his talk. Duggal spoke more about his own work
and addressed the religious conflict that has plagued India
through much of this century.
"We are all one." Duggal said. " There is no I lindu. no
Muslim. That culture has to be brought back."

Specilically, Duggal discussed the
Hindu-Muslim riots in 19X4 and the
continuing presence of such riots,
which were particularly fierce in the
mid-'KOs and early '90s.
"Duggal argued, using his own ex
periences of partition and the 1984

riots, that such problems were not
fundamental to the people of any
faith hut caused by politicians using
riots to gain power," Dossani said. "I
found his description of events during
Partition — when fellow-townsmen
protected the Sikhs — and his subse
quent reunion with old friends in
Pakistan in 1966 a moving testimony
to his pacific vision."
Some, such as junior Amit Chad

ha. found Duggal's comments on
these political issues superficial.
"Duggal evasively skirted all the
questions relating to modern politics,
but these were the questions most
pressing our minds," he said. "1 sup
pose that he is a poet and not a politi
cian. though from his heavy focus on
history during his talk, one hoped he
would say something of the history
being made today," Chadha added.

Sanskriti also held an informal
lunch with Duggal for those interest
ed earlier in the day. This was con
ducted as an open conversation that
included Duggal's wife, Dossani and
two diplomats from the Indian Con
sulate in San Francisco.
"At lunch with him. I was spell
bound bv his conversation. For him
everything is a story," said Mukher
jee. "Many of the same themes that
were so important in his lecture, such
as unity, religious freedom and the
righting of wrongs, were also re
vealed on a more personal level dur
ing the day."
The two consulate officials ac
companied Duggal on his visit to
Stanford and attended his lunch and
lecture.
"I think there was a good re
sponse in terms of the presence of
students," said Consul Abhijit
Haider. "It was great to see young
people, students, asking questions
that are very valid with respect to In
dian issues today."
Born in 1917. Duggal began writ
ingat the age of 12. Since then, he has
published some S(X) short stories in
25 collections, three collections of
poetry, 10 novels, seven full-length
plays and 75 short plays. Duggal also
served as station director of All India
Radio, having worked for the station
from IIM2l l M2 to 1966.
Duggal writes in his mother
tongue. Punjabi, and translates some
works into 1 lindi. English and Urdu,
languages in which he is also fluent.
I lis readership has extended even
beyond the boundaries of these four
languages. Many of his works have
been independently translated into
other languages and now enjoy a
wide audience in Europe, Asia and

the United States.
Duggal's accolades are many.
Most recently, the Guru Gobind
Singh Foundation in 1992 honored
him for his distinguished contribu
tion to Sikh studies. In 1993, the
Chief Minister of Punjab recognized
him with the "Parman Patra" for his
outstanding contribution to Punjabi
literature. Also in 1993. he was pre
sented the Ganga Saran Hindi
Sansthan Award by the president ol
India for his contribution to Hindi
writing.
Although Duggal has made sig
nificant contributions to his art. there
is still great concern about the de
creased significance placed on the
creative arts in Punjab.
"Poetry and music were once con
sidered hallmarks of Sikh culture."
said Dossani. "Every one of the ten
Gurus, the spiritual leaders who de
veloped the Sikh religion.. .was a
highly developed poet and musician.
Yet one of the puzzles has been the
apparent decline of this tradition
since India's independence."
Duggal explained this phenome
non as a result of the partition of the
province of Punjab, when Sikhs who
lived in West Punjab were forced to
move into East Punjab with the for
mation of Pakistan.
In an attempt to combat this de
cline of the creative arts, Duggal
plans to begin institutes for the arts in
different cities in Punjab and in
India's capital city. New Delhi, with
the $4 million available to him
through his position in Parliament.
