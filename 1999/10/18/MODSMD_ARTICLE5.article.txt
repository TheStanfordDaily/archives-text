### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
Leading European dancer and choreog
rapher Fina Bausch will conduct a public
dance rehearsal and give an on-stage inter
view tonight at 7 p.m. at the Roble Dance
Studio.
As the first Presidential Lecturer of the
1999-2000 academic year, Bausch's visit
marks a shift in the focus of the series from
topics in philosophy to the fine and per
forming arts.
Other artists featured this term include
pianist Charles Rosen, art historian Svct
lana Alpcrs and Chinese poet Bei Dao.

According to Comparative Literature
doctoral student Matthew Tiews, who is or
ganizing the series, this particular grouping
of artists was coincidental, but the focus on
the arts is a welcome result.
"[ This group] represents one particular
constellation of this question of the future
of the humanities in an academic setting. It
has more programmatic coherence," Tiews
said.
The series, which was created three
years ago to explore the future of the hu
manities in academia, has brought top hu
manists to Stanford for lectures and sym
posia.
Bausch in particular, Tiews said, is at the

center of the world of the performing arts.
Bausch's work in new types of concep
tions of performance since the 1970s has
"proved to be incredibly influential," he
said.
Mailed by some dance critics as the
"voice of Germany," Bausch is renowned
for her work in "tan/theater," the German
word for dance-theater. Tan/theater is a
genre of performance art that employs vi
sual art. music, theater and dance.
Bausch began directing the Tan/theater
Wuppertal in Germany in the 1973-1974
season and has since established herself as
the premier contributor to tan/theater in
both North America and Europe.

Trained in the Folkwang Institute in
Essen, Germany, and Julliard in New
York, Bausch said in interviews that she
began choreographing in response to what
she saw as excessive formalism in modern
dance.
Much of Bausch's work presents grand
themes through personal responses, taking
dance beyond formalist concerns for tech
nique alone.
In an essay titled "Difficult Dances."

site (http://www.prelectur.stanford.edu).
Janice Ross, member of the dance faculty
of the Drama Department, writes that in
Bausch's work, "the invisible divide be

tween the real person and the stage charac
ter seems to collapse."
Some of Bausch's work addresses
themes of love and loss, relationships be
tween men and women and the brutality
and indifference common to the world.
()ne example is her work "Kontakthof,"
which depicts a woman being touched first
by one man and then mauled repeatedly by
several men.
Dance Maga/ine critic Rita Felciano
writes of Bausch. "She scratches into the
soil of human nature and assembles her ar
tifacts. shards and all."
Bausch's performance is open to the
public, and will be followed by a reception.
