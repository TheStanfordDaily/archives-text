ISLAMABAD. Pakistan (AP)
— The head of Pakistan's new mili
tary regime announced Sunday a
unilateral reduction of troops on the
Indian border, the establishment of a
military-technocrat ruling council
and an eventual return to civilian
rule.
In a speech to the nation, Cien.
Pervaiz Musharraf announced the
formation of a six-member National
Security Council to govern the coun
try. The council would be made of
army officers and experts in legal,
foreign and national affairs, and it
would be assisted by "a think tank of
experts."
Musharraf made the speech dur

ing his first public appearance since
he announced the ouster of the civil
ian government last Tuesday on
national television.
"This is not martial law." Mushar
raf said, but rather "another path
toward democracy."
The constitution was not
scrapped — only temporarily sus
pended. he said. He gave no indica
tion of when civilian rule would be
restored, but said "the armed forces
have no intention to stay in charge
longer than necessary."
Musharraf said he would wel
come the resumption of "result-ori
ented" talks with nuclear rival India,
which has fought three wars with

Pakistan since both countries won
their independence from Britain in
IIM7.l l M7. Pakistan is overwhelmingly
Muslim, while India is predominant
ly I lindu.
But Musharraf made it clear that
Pakistan would continue giving
moral and political support to Kash
miri militants, who have been fight
ing Indian troops for the indepen
dence of Kashmir.
Musharrafs announcement that
he would thin troops on the Indian
border was unexpected. 1 le said it
was intended as a gesture to rebuild
confidence with New Delhi.
India's reaction was cautious.
National Security Adviser Brajesh

Mishra said the troop reduction
applied only to the international bor
ders. and not the volatile Kashmir
border.
"They say they will pull back
from the international border ...
tension was not on the international
border. It was on the Line of Con
trol" in Kashmir. Mishra told the pri
vate STAR Television network.
The Line of Control is a
cease-fire line that divides the
Himalayan territory between the
two nations.
Musharraf was the commander
who ordered fighters to seize moun
tain heights in the region last sum
mer. leading to the worst fighting in

three decades.
New Delhi was suspicious when
Musharraf seized power in Islam
abad last week, and ordered its
troops on high alert.
Nevertheless. Musharraf also
promised Sunday a "policy of nucle
ar and missile restraint."
Pakistan and India exploded
nuclear devices last year, declaring
themselves nuclear weapons powers
and raising fears of a South Asian
arms race.
U.S. officials said Sunday they
were pleased by several points
Musharraf made in his address, par
ticularly that he wanted to reduce
tensions with India and return Pak

istan to democratic rule. But they
said they were disappointed he had
offered no timetable for the return to
democracy.
"As General Musharraf told his
nation, actions speak louder than
words," State Department spokes
man James Rubin said. "Our own
actions toward Pakistan in the days
ahead will be guided by the steps
taken by the new authorities."
The promise to restore democra
cy needed "to be accompanied by a
credible and clear timetable," British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said
in a statement. "Pakistan's social and
economic problems cannot be solved
by decree."
