# Dancing with Pina Bausch
## Renowned performance artist hits Roble Studio 
### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
Pina Bausch, world-renowned
performance artist, and four
dancers from the Tan/theater
Wuppertal perfected their move
ments on the Roble Dance Studio
floor last night in front of an over
flowing crowd.
As the first Presidential Lectur

er of the autumn quarter, Bausch
guided a public rehearsal before
answering questions in an on-stage
interview with French and Italian
Professor Jeffcry Schnapp and
members of the audience.
The dancers performing with-
Bausch came from France.
Venezuela. Brazil and Australia.
The group rehearsed "Rite of
Spring." which has been part of

Bausch's repertoire for decades.
The piece depicts a girl who dances
until she dies.
In one part of the dance, dancers
splayed their fingers, paused and
then darted to one corner of Ihe
floor before retreating, clasping
their chests.
In "Rite of Spring." the dancers
fall to the floor repeatedly, and
Bausch said they usually perform
the piece on an earth floor instead
of harder surfaces such as the hard
wood of Roble Dance Studio.
Schnapp asked Bausch and her
dancers a series of questions in the
first part of the on-stage interview.
Questions from the audience fol
lowed.
Bausch emphasized that her
dances draw on music and visual
art. in addition to taking into ac
count the personalities of the indi
vidual dancers.
"Each dancer is in a different
way important. [They have] their
own way of dancing â€” it's compli
cated," she said.
Bausch said that when she crafts
a new dance, she asks her dancers a
number of questions in order to
generate new ideas about how to
use different media.
She also gives them words
which they then represent in a
movement.
"1 always forget all my ques
tions," Bausch quipped. "|Some
times! I say nothing ... hopefully
something arises," she said.
SeppGumbrecht. a comparative
literature professor, asked Bausch
whether or not her dances should
be "deciphered" for their social
messages.
Bausch rejected the idea, saying
that the images in her dances are
very "open."
"[The images] are never closed
into one [meaning]." she said.
" There is nothing that you can pin
point, 'This means this.' "
