## Clinton plans budget talks after foreign aid veto 
### 
WASHING I ON (AP) â€” Amid
rising tension marked by President
Clinton's veto of a $ 12.7-billion-for
eign-aid hill lie said smacks of "a
new American isolationism," the
president and Republican congres
sional leaders agreed Monday to
hold budget talks at the White
House.
The meeting was set for today
after Republican leaders accepted
Clinton's invitation. They said they
would insist that no taxes are raised
and that using Social Security's sur
pluses to pay for remaining spend
ing bills is ruled out. House Majori
ty Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas,
said Republicans consider the sur
pluses issue "the highest goal of our
budget season."
"If it's to try and get congression
al Republicans to join an irresponsi
ble scheme to spend Social Security
and raise taxes, I don't think the
president will find us a receptive
audience," Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., said of the
meeting.
Clinton said he wants to talk
about the two sides' differences
over education, anti-crime and envi
ronmental programs and how the
measures would be paid for.
"If we're going to make these
critical investments and maintain
our fiscal discipline to keep our
economy strong, we're going to

have to make tough choices, and
we're going to have to make them
together," the president said.
The session was arranged three
days before Thursday's expiration
of stopgap legislation that has kept
federal agencies functioning since
fiscal year 2(HM) began Oct. 1. Clin
ton said he would sign a short-term
extension, and OOP leaders said
they would send him one that will
last about a week.
Relations between the White
House and Congress, already
soured by Clinton's impeachment
trial, have worsened in recent
weeks.
Last week's Senate rejection of
the nuclear test ban treaty, a top
administration foreign policy goal,
has prompted bitter accusations of
partisanship from both sides. Both
stood to gain by holding a meeting
that would afford chances to appear
reasonable as they address the
year's highest-profile remaining
issue: the budget.
It was unclear what today's
meeting would achieve. There were
some hopes on both sides that it
would lead to a series of lower-level
meetings where specific remaining
differences could be resolved. But
clearly, both face political risks.
Many rank-and-file Republicans
loathed the omnibus spending hill
the White House and OOP leaders

wrote last fall, which contained bil
lions in spending that conservatives
attacked as excessive. Top Republi
cans said anew they would not
repeat that process, but they risk
GOP disaffection if things seem
similar.
Looking ahead to next year's
election campaigns. many
Democrats have been happy to see
Republicans struggle to write
spending hills. They would react
negatively if a quick agreement
were struck that blurred partisan
differences.
Just five of the 13 spending bills
for fiscal 20(H) have been enacted.
Two have been vetoed, and three
face veto threats.
On the five most controversial
bills, Clinton wants less than $10 bil
lion over what Republicans have
offered, a tiny portion of the near
s6(K) billion that the annual spend
ing bills control. But the two sides
have philosophical differences, such
as how extensive state control over
federal education aid should be and
(i()P provisions to help oil and min
ing industries that the administra
tion considers anti-environmental.
The vetoed foreign aid bill fell $2
billion below Clinton's request. It
omitted any of the $500 million he
wants for Israel and the Palestinians
to implement the accord they struck
last year at Wye River. Md. It also

provided less than he wanted for
international debt relief, the Peace
Corps and efforts to reduce the
nuclear threat from Russia, North
Korea and other countries.
"It seems to me to be the next
big chapter in the new American
isolationism" following the Senate's
defeat of the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty last week, Clinton said.

As they have for weeks. Repub
licans sought to cast Clinton as
demanding to use Social Security's
surpluses for extra spending, in this
case for a program that has little
public support.
"The president wants to increase
foreign aid by 30 percent, and he
knows that the money will come out
of the Social Security trust fund. We

will not raid the Social Security trust
fund to pay for more foreign aid,"
said House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-111.
The White House rejects that
argument and cites projections by
the nonpartisan Congressional Bud
get Office and others that GOP
spending plans would eat into the
Social Security surplus.
