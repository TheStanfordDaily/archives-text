# Hurricane Irene storms into North
## 
### 
TARBORO. N.C. (AP) — The
nearly one foot of rain dropped by
Hurricane Irene is all but guaran
teed to bring another round of
flooding to North Carolina later
this week, demoralizing people still
reeling from Hurricane Floyd a
month ago.
"You gut lifted up and the next
thing you know, something else
happens," said Karen Mabry, who
was flooded out of her mobile
home by Floyd and was kept out
by Irene on Monday. She has been
staying in an apartment supplied
by the Red Cross but has had trou
ble sleeping.
"I keep waking up and looking
out the window to make sure noth
ing else is happening," she said.
"It's just terrible. It's horrible."
Barely hurricane strength. Irene
soaked North Carolina's soggy
coastal plain Sunday with up to 11
inches of rain before veering out
into the Atlantic without ever com
ing ashore. At 5 p.m. EDI", Irene
was 2(X) miles south-southeast of
Cape Sable, Nova Scotia, moving
northeast at 4<S mph.
Irene was blamed for one death
in North Carolina, a motorist
whose vehicle skidded into a tree.
At least eight other people died as

a result of the storm, five of them in
Florida.
The rains once again sent
streams from their banks and
promised to produce more serious
flooding later this week as runoff
drains into the Tar, Neuse and
Cape Fear rivers.
For the past two months, it has
been one thing after another in
eastern North Carolina.
First there was Hurricane Den
nis. which battered the coast for a
week before coming inland and
dumping up to 8 inches of rain.
Two weeks later. Floyd poured 20
inches of rain on the region, caus
ing 49 deaths there and the worst
flooding instate history. Eight
more inches fell less than two
weeks after that. Irene came next.
To help flood victims cope, the
Red Cross has sent 244 mental
health workers to eastern North
Carolina — more than for any
other disaster except the Okla
homa City bombing.
"People are overwhelmed right
now by the fact that they have to
clean up after the storms and be a
mom and a dad and an employee,"
Red Cross spokeswoman Gina
Giarronardo said.
Judy Farrar, a Red Cross men

tal health counselor in Tarboro,
said Monday that many people
have become "hypervigilant"
nervously mindful of every change
of weather, every rainfall.
In Tarboro, at the center of
Floyd's flooding Sept. I(). the Tar
River is expected to crest Wednes
day 4 feet above its 19-foot flood
Stage.
"I just hope that it gets better
soon." said Casheila Draughn. 43.
who was at a Red Cross recovery
center with her 88-year-old grand
mother. Liza Staton, and her
daughter Tawanna. 22. "Obvious
ly, it can't be as bad as it was the
last time, but I'm just hoping for
life to get close to normal."
Near Pinetops. which was dev
astated by Floyd's floodwaters,
Leroy Johnson watched the waters
rising on a Tar River tributary and
said it didn't worry him much:
"People are at ease now because
this time they have nothing to
lose," he noted.
In the town of Seven Springs,
which saw record flooding from
Flovd, the Neuse is expected to
crest Wednesday, 9 feet above its
14-foot flood stage.
Town Commissioner Elizabeth
Quinn. who has been living in a

camper since F loyd Hooded her
home, said she and the lour other
town commissioners decided to
proceed with the annual ( hristmas
parade, whatever comes.
"We might not have pretty
houses and pretty yards, hut we've
got to keep our spirits up." she
said.
Still, she said, all the rain was
"enough to keep you worried to
death all the time. The ground is
saturated, and it wouldn't take
much to blow a tree down."
A signed taped to the front of
the trailer that now serves as the
town hall read: "Remember the
Alamo. Remember Seven
Springs."
In Florida, more than 370,(MM)
people were still without power,
three da\s after Irene drenched the
stale.
Some people were already
keeping watch on the next poten
tial menace: hopieal Storm Jose,
far away in the Atlantic. Jose was
more than 2(M) miles east of Barba
dos but was strengthening and
expected to become a hurricane in
the next few days.
forecasters were uncertain of
its track but said it could threaten
the I nitcd States.
