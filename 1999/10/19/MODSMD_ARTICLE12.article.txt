PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP)
— It was an unusual sight in Koso
vo: Serbs and ethnic Albanians
joining together to pursue a com
mon goal — training to handle
civil security and crisis manage
ment.
A 16-man team of members of
the new Kosovo Protection Corps
and a handful of Serbs boarded a
plane Monday lor a NATO-orga
nized 3 1/2-week study trip to
France.
The alliance hoped that train
ing the multiethnic group would
dispel doubts among the Serbs
that the corps is merely the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army in a new
guise.
The group, made up of 10 eth
nic Albanians, three Serbs, two
Bosnian Muslims and a Kosovo
lurk, will participate in firefight
ing. emergency rescue and other
training provided by the French
Civil Securities, said Maj. Gen.
Jean-Claude Thomann of the
NATO-led peacekeeping force.
I he training is a "trust-building
exercise," Thomann said. "We
want to encourage them to talk to
each other."
Representatives of Kosovo's
dwindling Serb minority, mean
while. decided on Monday to form
their own protection force, the
independent Beta news agency
reported.
Serb leaders meeting Monday
at the Gracanica monastery, some
three miles south of the capital,
Pristina, also said they would
impose self-rule in enclaves of the
province where Serbs are predom
inant. the agency said.
The actions indicated that
Serbs continue to feel threatened
in Kosovo despite NATO promis
es to protect them and safeguard
their property.
International officials in Koso
vo have rejected earlier Serb pro
posals for establishment of the
enclaves and a separate force,
arguing that such moves would
violate multiethnic principles
intended for the region.
Thomann said the Serbs within
the group that left for France had
been picked by the Serb leader
ship in Kosovska Mitrovica. a bit
terly divided city in northern
Kosovo. More than 100 people
were hurt there last week after
ethnic Albanians attacked NATO
troops and French and Italian

police in an attempt to cross into
the Serb-held side of the commu
nity.
Thomann said the idea was to
provide the Serbs in the group
with "information on our real and
true intent when we created the
Kosovo Protection Corps."
Since most prospective mem
bers of the corps are former KLA
fighters, the Serbs are suspicious
of the new organization. NATO
and the United Nations, however,
say the corps is only meant to
assist in civil emergencies and
other nonmilitary duties.
Thomann conceded that it
would be difficult for Serbs and
ethnic Albanians to serve together
in the aftermath of the 18-month
Serb crackdown on ethnic A Ibani
ans and the NATO bombing cam
paign that forced Serb troops to
leave Kosovo in June.
Miodrag Ralic, one of the three
Serbs boarding a French military
transport for the flight to France,
agreed it was unrealistic to talk of
a joint ethnic Albanian-Serb
Kosovo protection force.
"The tensions are just too big."
he told reporters. "Maybe in the
future, if the hatred and tension
becomes much, much lower, and
we can work together."
Meanwhile, in Kosovo on Mon
day. a Norwegian junior officer
received superficial thigh wounds
when shots were fired toward a
patrol of peacekeepers in south
western Kosovo Polje, said Maj.
Roland Lavoie, a NATO
spokesman.
He said the patrol located two
men in brown camouflage clothes
and returned fire, probably injur
ing one. The men managed to
escape. The officer was taken to a
Norwegian field hospital.
Elsewhere, two children were
killed and one was seriously
injured Sunday in a field in Mala
Krusa, six miles north of the
southern city of Prizren, Lavoie
said. It appeared that one of the
children set off a small bomb. No
other details were immediately
available.
In Pristina. a pre dawn fire
broke out Monday in a compound
used by NATO peacekeepers,
destroying Kosovo's television
building. Three NATO soldiers
were slightly injured. NATO
spokesmen said. The fire's cause
was apparently electrical.
