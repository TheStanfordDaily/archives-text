GRADE point average, num
ber of AP classes taken, num
ber of leaderships positions
held: I always thought their numerical
values were most important to Stan
ford's admission office when deciding
whom to accept. Yet all these factors,
along with personal essays and rec
ommendations. conveyed a character
istic that all, or at least most, Stanford
students possess: ambition and the
desire to succeed in ;ill that they do.
Ilius Stanford students are future
oriented. The majority of their actions
are made only after considering the
implications they will have on their
future. Most people would consider
this an advantageous characteristic,
but it has its disadvantages as well. 1
think many of the chronic problems
we complain about at Stanford are a
result of being future-oriented.
Example one: grades. I happened
upon a fellow freshman last year
stressed out and practically in tears
because he felt scoring below the
mean on his first I'.con qui/ would
preclude him from being accepted to
liivv school in four years. He had no
time to enjoy the material he learned
because he was more concerned with
memorizing it in order to apply il on
an exam.
Example two: selecting a major.
My Sophomore College professor
noted that the biggest difference
between being a college student in the
"60s and being a student in the " l H)s is
that students now select their major
according to what career it will earn
them as opposed to selecting it
according to their actual interests.
Mow true that is. A good friend of
mine here loves nothing more than

art but decided to be premed because

it is more practical.
Example three: social lives. It is oft
noted that dating at Stanford consists
of either random hook-ups or couples
together so often that they might as
well be married. Both options are effi
cient. Option one allows for minimal
time commitment and option two
requires commitment to your signifi
cant other and no one else.
How often do students do what
they want to do as opposed to what
they think they should be doing? I still
regret not venturing to Yosemite last
year to go camping with my dorm
because I had a paper to write. I don't
even remember what class the paper
was for or what grade I received on it.
And thus I am left wondering what
the advantages of being future-orient
ed are. Many speakers came into Psy
chology I last year, and the person
who left the biggest impression on me
was a Stanford graduate. He had
majored in engineering here and then
landed the job he wanted. I le became
so enveloped in succeeding, however,
that he left himself no time to enjoy
his family or his life. He suffered a
nervous breakdown and remains
unemployed.
I don't want to suffer through a
nervous breakdown or a mid-life cri
sis. I don't want to be part of the
statistic noting that the majority of
deaths today are attributable to
stress-induced diseases.
Many people informed me that the
key to success in college was manag
ing my time effectively. I think the
most important thing to learn for life
is how to strike a balance between
being future-oriented and present
oriented. Why should people work
today and say that they will enjoy
tomorrow? What if tomorrow never
comes?
