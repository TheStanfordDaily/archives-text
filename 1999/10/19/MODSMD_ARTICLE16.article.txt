# Outside the box
## Living the typical American lifestyle

HOW materialis
tic are you?
How long could
you go without stepping
into Wal-Mart or the 50-
aisle supermarket down
the street? After being
away from these beauti

ful edifices of consumerism for over five
months because of a trip to Germany, I
had really begun to miss these excessive
displays of American products. So after a
Polish guy I met in an Alp town hostel told
me about an American store in the area. I
had to check it out, even though I wholly
expected a poor German rip-off of the
obviously superior American original.
I was utterly shocked when I got inside;
it was America in a store: Levi's jeans.
Rusty Hawaiian shirts, I lanes — and this
was just the clothing part! Into the grocery
store I went: Hud Ice, Ritz Crackers, Chips
Ahoy, a whole aisle of junk food! I didn't
think it was that odd that everything was
priced in American dollars and that every
one in the store was American; it was a
touristy area, right?
I wandered around the store for about
a half hour (I'm sure with the most awe
struck look on my face) just absorbing the
atmosphere, hearing American English,
and finding more and more items that I
never realized how much I craved. Need
less to say. I accumulated quite a bit of,
well. crap.
I brought my stuff up to the checker,
and started chatting it up with her as she
checked through my items. About halfway

through, she said, "Oh yeah, I just need to
see your military ID." My eyes sank as 1
told her that I didn't have one. I begged
her just to let me slip by and buy my prod
ucts, but she wouldn't budge and took all
of my beautiful items behind the counter.
I mourned the loss all the way back to the
train station. I felt as if I had lost my brief
grip on the America that was slowly fading
into a vague memory of the past.
As I was sitting at the train station more
than a bit disappointed. I realized that per
haps it was really a good thing that I
couldn't buy anything. In the store, I con
veniently forgot about all of my extreme
budgetary problems that had all begun in
Amsterdam three weeks earlier. For some
reason, that city makes all of your worries
go away. And it wasn't as if there was any
thing in that basket that I absolutely need
ed (except for the two containers of origi
nal Kraft Macaroni and Cheese).
I got by just fine with German markets.
I also realized that I hadn't really seen
America in the store, just American stuff.
This stuff, however, made me feel more
like I was in America and made me happi
er than if I had been dropped in the mid
dle of San Francisco, I imagine, for the
same amount of time. Why would just
clutching American items make me feel
more at home than wandering through an
American city would?
I pondered this for a while, and eventu
ally caine to an answer. American culture
is movies, music, television, but mostly
material things. American culture is mate
rialistic. Everything we are taught trains us

to want more. More what? Vacation time?
Happiness? No. Nice cars. Big houses.
Gap Khakis. The new cookies in aisle 10.
And we cat it up. I take trips to Costco
with my dad just to check out the new
stereo equipment and the aisles and aisles
of oversized things I don't need. It gives
me a rush.
And though my consumerism might be
extreme, I don't think 1 am alone on this.
American culture is built upon always
wanting more, accumulating more things
— this will make you satisfied. After a cer
tain point a little past minimalism. 1 don't
think it does.
So how can we move away from this
materialism, you ask? I am trying to
decide that myself. Recognize it, and real
ize that the new Twice As Expensive
Cleans Your Teeth As You Eat Raw
Sugar Toothpaste probably doesn't clean
your teeth better than the stuff you are
used to, and know that the answer to your
pursuit for ultimate happiness does not
rest between the Banana Republic and the
Gap. I am working on this too, and per
haps we can all find satisfaction in the
things that truly make us happy. What that
is, is up to you.
