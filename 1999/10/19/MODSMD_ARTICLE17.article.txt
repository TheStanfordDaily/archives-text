Union member seeks settle
ment with management
As iill employee of UCSI'-Stanford
I lealtheare, I read with great interest
Human Resources Vice President I'elix
Uartheleinv's recent letter to your news
paper on Oct <S. After reading it, I felt
strongly that ;i response to what he said,
and did not say, was necessary.
lie wrote that "some issues" are still
unresolved in negotiations hut failed to
mention what those issues are. This omis
sion is especially puzzling because the
remaining major issues have been made
very clear to management by the employ
ees and our union, Local 715 of the Ser
vice I mployees International Union
(Sill')- I he two major issues are:

1. A fair wage. Management has only
offered employees a guaranteed increase
of 4 percent over three years. That breaks
down to a little more than I percent a
year! Many of my co-workers have to
work two, or even three jobs in order to
make ends meet. With the high cost of liv
ing in the Hay Area, we deserve a fair raise
that we can count on each year. Hospital
management has had no problems shelling
out millions of dollars to the consultant
firm Ihe Hunter Group (who are paid
over $35(K) per day, per consultant, plus
expenses). Why won't management give
its workers a fair wage?
2. Right to organize. In IW<S, when we
were organizing our Union, management
spent well over $1 million interfering with
us by forcing us to listen to anti-union

speeches on work time and by making our
supervisors talk to us to discourage us
Irom voting for the union. Our proposal in
negotiations is very simple: allow the
remaining (about 2.000) employees who
do not yet have union representation at
the hospital have the freedom to choose
whether or not they want a union without
interference form management. Why
won't management agree to this simple
principle of allowing employees to make
up their own mind about voting for the
union without interference from supervi
sors?
Mr. Barthelemy concluded his letter by
saying. "We strongly believe that the only
place to resolve these issues is at the bar
gaining table." Why is Mr. Barthelemy
against the public, and students, being

informed and involved in these negotia
tions? The fact is, Mr. Barthelemy knows
how important the support of the commu
nity and students is to workers involved in
a labor dispute. Wouldn't you prefer to
keep everything behind closed doors if you
were offering workers 1 percent raises?
Hospital workers and Local 715 are
also confident that a settlement can be
reached quickly. However, for this to hap
pen, management must demonstrate its
commitment to reaching a fair settlement.
Otherwise, management is simply inviting
protracted poor labor relations and low
employee morale at the hospital.
