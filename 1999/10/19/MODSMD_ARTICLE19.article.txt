# ASSU program offers discounts
## 
### Rebecca Whitehurst 
A new program has local busi
nesses lining up to offer discounts
to Stanford students. But few stu
dents are taking advantage.
The Stanford Savers Program,
established last summer by the
ASSU, seeks to build better rela
tionships with local businesses in
Palo Alto, Menlo Park. Mountain
View, Los Altos and Redwood
City, while granting rebates to
members of the Stanford commu
nity.

ASSU President Mike Levin
said the program has enjoyed a
"very positive" response thus far.
Hut an informal Daily poll of 50
students yesterday found only one
who knew of the program.
"I've never heard of it." fresh
man Rachel Seeligsaid. But "stores
and restaurants in this area can he
really expensive, so getting dis
counts would he a major plus."
Through Stanford Savers, stu
dents can get 15 percent off in par
ticipating stores such as Books Inc.
and Kepler's, as well as Pizza

Chicago, Denny's and other popu
lar restaurants by showing a stu
dent ID card.
"By creating ASSU Stanford-
Savers, we're hoping to expand the
number of businesses providing
discounts as well as create a re
source for the Stanford community
to see which businesses are partici
pating in discount programs,"
Levin said.
Levin said the ASSU is still
looking to expand the list, which
currently includes 74 businesses.

Weekly and having a Stanford-
Savers Web site (http://assu.stan
ford.edu/saver/) will hopefully get
more local vendors involved and
make more students aware of the
program. Students can also access
this Web site for a list of Stanford-
Savers locations.
ASSU Vice President John
Mills advised students to "keep in
mind that it is up to the members of
the Stanford community to ask for
discounts at these businesses, and
up to the various employees of the
businesses to uphold the offers."
