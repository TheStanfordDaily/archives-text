### Alice Brown Editorial staff 
Recognized for their talent and promise as young
faculty members. IS assistant professors have been
named this year's Terman Fellows.
The award is specifically for faculty in the sciences
and engineering, and a total of 52 Stanford professors
are now Terman Fellows.
Terman Fellows receive up to $ I ()().()()() annually,
money that can be instrumental in helping faculty with
their research.
The deans of the Schools til Engineering and Hu
manities and Sciences make nominations, and the
nominees are then approved by Provost John Hen
nessy.
Awards are given to faculty in the School ol Medi
cine and the School of Earth Sciences on a rotating
basis.
This is the first year that awards have been given to
professors in the School of Earth Sciences, a fact that
delights Lynn Orr. the dean of the school.
"When the program was established. Earth Sci
ences was in ;i period where we were not hiring at any
level. That has now changed, and we have a wonderful
crop of new young faculty." she said.
We are very fortunate that three of them have been
awarded Terman Fellowships this year. Each of them
is building an extensive lab program, so the I'erman
funding will give them a substantial boost as they get
their labs up and running."
Christopher Garcia, an assistant professor in the
Department of Microbiology and Immunology, said
being named a Terman Fellow was "definitely good
news. It allows me to breathe a bit easier."

He plans to use the money for supplies and for the
salaries of students helping him with his research,
which focuses on immune recognition and receptor/
ligand interactions.
The award "permits you to do more of what you're
interested in — it lets you spend more time doing sci
ence," he said.
Andrea Goldsmith, an assistant professor in the
Department of Engineering, was "thrilled to get the
award," and called it a "nice boost." Her work is in the
area of wireless communications, and she plans to use
her award money to "support one or two graduate stu
dents."
In addition to the three fellows in the School of
Earth Sciences, there are six from the School of Engi
neering. two from the Computer Science Department,
two from the Physics Department, and one each from
the Biological Sciences Department, Chemistry De
partment. the Department of Genetics and the De
partment of Pathology, the Department of Dermatol
ogy and the Department of Microbiology and Im
munology.
Anthony Oro, an assistant professor in the Derma
tology Department, called being granted a Terman
Fellowship an "outstanding honor.
"It's incredible for Stanford to support young fac
ulty." he added. "This is the most crucial time for
young faculty, when they're getting their labs started."
The Terman Fellowship program was started in
1994 with a $25-million grant from William Hewlett
and David Packard.
According to Orr, " These young faculty will con
tribute substantially to our understanding of how this
planet works, a contribution that the donors of the
Terman Fellowships would certainly applaud."
