# Former professor wins econ Nobel

### Peter Stair Contributing writer 
Robert Mundell, the 1999
Nobel Laureate for economics, is
clearly an international man. Born
in a small Ottawa town centered
around a cheese factory, he was
schooled in the United States and
England, teaches at New York's
Columbia University and lives in
an Italian mansion.
Not surprisingly, the work that
likely led to his prize, the theory of
"optimal currency areas," led to
the adoption of a single, interna*
tional currency in Europe.
The so-called "godfather of the
euro" also taught briefly at Stan
ford. -
In a post-Nobel tribute in the
Ottawa Citizen, Mundell's friend
William Watson described him as
"a bit of a strange bird" who
"mumbles and circles and rambles
off on tangents," and whose clum
sy presentations give pne the
sense each is his "first encounter
with an overhead projector."
Some colleagues also say
Mundell has been equally clumsy
with economics, citing his support
for "supply-side economics" and
President Reagan's marginal tax
cuts in the early 1980s.
"Voodoo economics," as can
didate George Bush called them
at the time, may have fallen out of
favor with many economists, but
Mundell still stands by his belief
that marginal tax cuts are the best
means of economic stimulus, say
ing, "How many people believed
in electricity before Edison?"
But on most other accounts,
economists strongly agree with
Mundell, particularly his studies
on the effects of international cur
rency exchanges.
flje is the first economist to

show how the flow of capital
across international borders can
affect a country's ability to man
age its economy. Hie "Mendell-
Fleming" model, discovered with
the help of International Mone
tary Fund economist Marcus
Fleming, accurately predicts how
fiscal and monetary policies work
under fixed and floating currency
exchange rates.
And his theory of "optimal cur
. rency areas" stated that economi
cally similar regions, not necessar
ily nations, should share a curren
cy: when economic growth is not
uniform across a country, the gov
ernment cannot tailor interest
rates best for different regions.
Often, nationatinoiietary poli
cy requires slowing the growth in
poorer regions to prevent infla
tion in wealthier ones. Converse
ly, when economic growth is uni
form across several countries, a
single currency cuts down on
transaction costs and uncertainty
as currencies fluctuate against
each other.
The transition, with its chal*
lenge to patriotic sentiments,
would not be easy, Mundell ac
knowledged. It would cause "an
emotional trauma akin to the loss
of national heritage," he said. But,
he claimed, the benefits would far
outstrip the costs.
Europeans believed him and
established the euro as its shared
form of currency in the beginning
of 1999, bringing in what may be a
new global millenium.
After accepting the prize in
Stockholm, Sweden, on Dec. 10,
Mundell will return to teaching at
Columbia.
He announced that he would
invest the $976,000 (900,202
euros) into his 65-roora palazzo in
Siena.
