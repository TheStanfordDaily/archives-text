MEN S CROSS COUNTRY
■ Saturday: No. 2 Stanford wins Pre-NCAA meet in
Bloomington, Ind.

"We won the meet, so I guess we measured up just
fine," head coach Vin Lananna said. "But I think that we
can run better and tighten up the gap between our run
ners."
Stanford was led by the third-place effort of junior
Jonathon Riley in his season debut. Riley's 24-minute.
f0.31 -second clocking over the eight-kilometer course
was bettered only by Oregon's Steve Fein, who finished
with a time of24:06.31. and William & Mary's Matt I ane
with a time of 24:08.37.
Following closely behind Riley, junior Thomas Mm -
Icy (24:25.03) and senior captain Jake Maas (24:35.29)
placed ninth and 16th. respectively.
"Both Thomas and Jake have been getting better and
better each week." Lananna said. "1 think each of our top
six guys really ran well. They are a little bit inexperienced
in that kind of competition, but they handled it well."
Sophomore Gabe Jennings came in 48th (25:08.53),
freshman Jesse Thomas took 56th (25:12.19) and sopho
more Jamey Clifford finished 64th (25:17.53).
Stanford ran well as a pack at the beginning of the
race, holding five of the top 25 spots through the first
couple of miles. But pushing the pace near the head of
the pack took its toll.
"I think we made a little bit of a strategic error in
pressing a little too long," Lananna said. "We didn't run
the last part of the race as well as I'd hoped we'd be able
4©ron it. I would have liked for our gap tobe a lot tighter,
and I think it could have been."
The meet did not merely act as a mid-season gauge for
the Cardinal. Because the NCAA Championship meet
will be raced over the same terrain, plu:* two kilometers,
the meet also serv'edXo familiarize the team with the site
of the Nov. 22 seqson'finale.
Lananna was at pleased with the
opportunity that Saturday's pieet afforded the team.
"The race set up asta'better simulation of the *N< A A
meet ttyan I've seen yt any of the othef Pre-NCAA
meets," 1 Lailannasaid "Tthink that there were enough
gefod individuals in the rat£ lots ol teahis. lots of traffic,
for a good run through."
Lananna was equally encouraged by the racing ol
Riley, who looks to lead the team through the remainder
of the season.

"Certainly, we were bolstered by the debut ol
Jonathon - lie ran quite well." I ananna said. I lis sne
eßss bodes well, and the extra two kilometers [ol the
N( AA meet) will help him."
I he remainder ol the season is solek eomprised ol
championship races, so 1 .ananna is now laced with the
task ol selecting just who will represent the ( ardinal in
the Pacific 10 (onference. Region Sand N( A A ( ham
pionship meets.
