Stanford trounced its nearest

competitor, third-ranked BYU, by
29 points (77-116). Freshman Erin
Sullivan led the way with a strong
second-place finish.
Fourth-ranked Colorado was
third in the team standings with
123 points.
For Sullivan, it was her second
race of the season and her first as
the No. 1 Cardinal runner.
Battling it out with Colorado
senior Kara Wheeler, the runner
up at last year's 3,000 meters at
NCAA outdoors, Sullivan lost out
by a little more than a second, fin
ishing in a time of 17 minutes, 8
seconds.
"Erin had a great race," said
Stanford head coach Vin Lananna.
"She set herself up nicely, moved
up the whole way and had a great
finish."
Working with teammates Lau

ren Fleshnian. a freshman, and
Sally Glynn, a senior, who finished
in seventh and 13th. respectively,
Sullivan stayed composed
throughout.
"I just tried to keep contact
with the lead pack," Sullivan said.
"I was still running with Sally and
Lauren through the halfway point.
Eventually, in the fourth kilome
ter, I worked my way up into the
top five and in the end Kara
Wheeler and 1 were just sprinting
it out."
After Glynn, the next Cardinal
runner across the line was fresh

Freshman Erin Sullivan, seen here in action at the Stanford Invitational, set the pace for the Cardinal
with a second-place finish at the Pre-NCAA cross country meet on Saturday. Sullivan helped her team
collect 77 points and first-place honors.
43 seconds, a five-second improve
ment from the Stanford Invitation
al Oct 2.
"We got everything we needed
to get out of the meet." Lananna
said. " The least of our concerns
was the score. I was even tempted
to run our women in the second
race so there would be no out
come. I just wanted to get on the
horse and 1 think we were able to
do that."
While this meet has no bearing
on what will happen at the N( AAs
on Nov 22. it certainly bodes well
for the Stanford squad that it can
continually defeat the best compe
tition out there, even without its
top team.
Junior Julia Stamps, the Cardi
nal's top runner in two races this
year, was given the day oil b\
Lananna to rest, as was Sharolyn
Shields, BYU'sNo. 1.
"The only assessment and eval
uation of which is the best team in
the country conies tin Nov 22."
Lananna said. "Are we a great
team? Yes. an excellent team.
"The three championship
meets are very important to our
team. All three of our meets have a
great deal of significance. We want
to win the [Pacific 10 Conference],
we want to come out of the region
al qualified and we want to go into
the NCAAs with our best seven on
the starting line."
But according to Sullivan, there
is still much work to be done.
"I think we're looking really
good, but we always have room to
improve," Sullivan said, "We're
still doing more miles and work
ing really hard. I think everyone
will be feeling a lot better when
we cut back and get our legs back
for the championship portion ol
the season. We still do have a
month."
Stanford has two weeks off be
fore Pac-lOs on Oct. 30 in Long
Beach. Calif.
