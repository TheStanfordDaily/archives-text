■ Tonight: No. 7 Stanford (14-2) vs.
No 31 Iniversit) ol the Pacific (1*7-1).
7 p.m.. Maples Pavilion.

I hat 35-match home winning
streak that has been such a symbol
of Stanford's dominance during
the past two years suddenly seem?

a little precarious as the No. 7 Stan
ford women's volleyball team (14-
2) prepares to host No. 3 I 'niversi
tv of the Pacific (17-1) in a non
conference match tonight.
The Cardinal, coming off hack
to-back victories over Arizona
State and Arizona this past Thurs
day and I riday. is looking to prove
itself against one of the elite teams
in the nation this year and brush
away any doubts provoked b\ its
loss to UCLA.
The match against Pacific repre
sents a measuring stick by which
Stanford can judge whether it is on

track to make a run for the nation
al championship.
As the Cardinal advances deep
er and deeper into the season, it be
comes more essential that it not
only compete with, but defeat
teams on the level of Pacific in
preparation for NCAA tourna

ment play.
And the Pacific Tigers will cer
tainly provide Stanford with one of
its stiffest challenges all season.
With a core of six seniors and
two juniors, UOP has gone up
against — and beaten — some of
the top schools in the country this
season, its only loss coming against
No. 9 UC-Santa Barbara.
The Tigers, gunning for their
third national championship, are
led by senior outside hitter Elsa
Stegeman, who currently ranks
12th in the nation in kills-per-game
average.
Last week against Idaho she had
an impressive 17 kills with two er
rors in 25 attacks and also recently
became Pacific's career kills leader
with 1,507.
Other contributors for the
Tigers include senior middle block
er Tracy Chambers and junior out
side hitter / middle blocker
Danielle Shinn.
The Cardinal will need its play
ers to build on their solid perfor
mances against Arizona State and
Arizona if it hopes to emerge victo
rious fromtonight's match.
Senior middle blocker Kerri
Walsh and freshman outside hitter
1 -ogan Tom both had strong perfor
mances last week, totalling 21 and
33 kills, respectively, in two games.
Tom is also currently ranked
20th in kills in the NCAA with a
5.07 kills-per-game average.
Both players, as well as junior
setter Lindsay Kagawa, and junior
middle blocker Jennifer Detmer,
who just returned to action follow
ing a stomach injury that has side
lined her for much of the season,
will be asked to step up their play
from last week to go against the
Tigers.
No matter what the outcome,
the Stanford-Pacific matchup
promises to be a true clash of titans,
and should showcase some out
standing play on both sides.
