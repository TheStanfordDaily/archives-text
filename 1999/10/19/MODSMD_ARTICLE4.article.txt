# Language study hits record high
## 
### Juliana Liu Contributing writer 
In an era of increasing global consciousness, multi
national companies and technological diffusion, college
students studying a second or even a third language are
no longer just International Relations majors.
Pre-med, engineering, anthropology and art history
students often study a second language related to their
field of expertise. Language Center Director Elizabeth
Bernhardt said.
Bernhardt cited as examples the trend of many engi
neering students pursuing Japanese, anthropology stu
dents studying Spanish and art students learning Italian.
"It's a general recognition of how important an in
ternational perspective is." Bernhardt said. "Another
tool that students have is a foreign language."
A Modern Language Association report released in
The Chronicle of I ligher Education last week said that
enrollment in foreign language courses in two- and
four-vear institutions in the I LS. is at a record high, hav-

ing increased 4.8 percent since
1995.
Spanish remains the biggest
draw.
"These new numbers are good
news for those of us who believe in
the value of language study," Hxec
utive Director of the MLA Phyllis
Franklin told the Chronicle. "In ad
dition to giving students a practical
advantage in a global economy,
language study provides an inside
look at other cultures."
The new figures reverse findings
from the most recent survey con
ducted in 1995, concluding that lan
guage enrollment had actually de
clined by 3.X percent in the previ

ous five years.
According to the report, Span
ish. which attracts6s6,s9o students,
continues to claim three times as
many students as the next most
popular language, French.
With an increase of 8.3 percent
since the 1995 survey, Spanish ac
counts for 55 percent of all students
studying foreign languages, the re
port said.
Bernhardt said that Stanford
mirrors this national trend.
"We have experienced a 20-per
cent increase in the number of stu
dents enrolled in first-year lan
guages and also a 20-percent in
crease in second-year enrollment
[this year]," Bernhardt said.
Because the University requires
all undergraduates to demonstrate
proficiency in a foreign language

equivalent to one year of instruc
tion, the increase in the number of
students studying second-year lan
guages was more significant, she
said.
"I interpret the figures as Stan
ford students committed to the lan
guage that they know." Bernhardt
said.
But some languages not tradi
tionally taught in high schools are
also on the rise.
The MLA survey said enroll
ment in Arabic and Korean has in
creased 23.9 percent and 34 per
cent, respectively. American Sign
Language has experienced the
biggest growth at 165 percent from
4,304 students in 1995 to 11.420 last
year.
Bernhard said Stanford's ASL
program has become more popu

lar.
"We've always had a popular
ASL program," she said. "It has ex
perienced increases, just like Slavic
languages has."
Berhardt said the Language
Center has been offering language
classes with a more practical com
ponent.
"We offer a Spanish conversa
tion course that is linked to the
feminist program so that students
are more familiar with the issues in
their courses," she said.
Students can also take Por
tuguese, Spanish, German, Japan
ese and Chinese courses with a
focus on business.
"We have a much more sophisti
cated curriculum and a much more
sophisticated set of offerings,"
Bernhardt said.
