### Kelly Donoghue 
Stanford gay. lesbian and bisexual stu
dents looking to share their experiences
have a new forum â€” the University's first
"Queer Essay C ontest."
The contest, sponsored by the Bisexual,
Ciav and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford, is an
attempt to raise awareness within the
queer community and beyond.
The contest will accept submissions
until Oct. 30 and by the end of November,
the winner's piece, along with other sub
missions. will be posted online at
www.stanford.edu/group/QR. I he winner
will also earn a S.'sO to $I(H) prize.

I ssays should present a creative, honest
expression of what it is like to be queer at
Stanford, said junior Jason Kirk, who is ac
cepting the submissions.
"There are so many personalities within
the queer community that it is difficult to
choose one that encapsulates the whole ex
perience." he said. "For those within the
queer community it will help them to gain a
broader perspective and enable them to
think about things they haven't thought
about."
BCiLAS is a student association that
formed as the social component of the Les
bian. Ciay and Bisexual Community Cen
ter. It sponsors events, such as the annual

dance Genderfiik, that University policy
prohibits the LGBCC from hosting.
The essay contest is a BCiLAS attempt
to go beyond social events to raise aware
ness, Kirk said.
"The purpose of this essay contest."
said Arturo Diaz, a sophomore and former
BCiLAS president, "is to raise awareness
not only about the gay, lesbian and bisexu
al presence on campus, but also about the
issues we face."
Diaz said he hopes the contest will raise
awareness on a national level, by adding
personal accounts of queer life at Stanford
to a Web site that already includes infor
mation about campus support systems.
