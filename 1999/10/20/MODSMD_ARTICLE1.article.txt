# A 						kidnapping, criminals and the suburban dream
## Scribner reads from 1st novel 
### Zachary Dillon 
Last night, Keith Scribner, a
Jones Lecturer in creative writing,
read from his first novel, "The
Good Life," at the Stanford Book
store.
Scribner, who has been awarded
the Wallace Stegner and John
L'Heureux Fellowships, teaches be
ginning and intermediate fiction
writing classes in the English De
partment.
His novel is based on the true
story of the 1992 kidnapping of an
Exxon executive in suburban New
Jersey. Scribner tells the story from
five perspectives, including those of
the criminals, Theo and Colleen, a
middle-aged, middle-class couple
deeply in debt.
"It's a commentary on feelings of
entitlement, conflicting interpreta
tions of the American Dream, and
materialism and social class in
America," said Scribner.
Scribner read two selections from
his novel. The first is written from

the point of view of the kidnapped
man's wife and paints a picture of
their very real, very average married
life. Their days are filled with the rit
uals and routines of a happily mar
ried couple, as well as a sense of con
tentment that is destroyed when the
wife realizes that her husband's car
is running, the door is open and he is
gone.
The second selection Scribner
read is written from the perspective
of Colleen, reminiscing about a time
two years earlier when she and Theo
lived in Vail with their children.
Colleen had visions of selling
Good Life products (the novel's
equivalent of Amway), and this ex
cerpt tells of when she was taken in
by the charm of the Good Life sales
man and the golden promise of the
American Dream.
"She had lived her life waiting for
life to begin," the narrator says.
Colleen and Theo, tired of their
passing dreams of the good life, de
cide to enact a plan to win back what
they believe is their share of the

American Dream.
The novel explores how easy it
can be to rationalize decisions, and
how doing so can slowly and insidi
ously unravel a person's perceptions
of right and wrong. With its multiple
perspectives, "The Good Life" in
vites readers to identify not only
with the victim, but also with the
criminals, who appear to be ordinary
middle-class Americans.
The reading was funny and seri
ous at the same time," said Owen El
lickson, a senior majoring in English.
"There was humor, but it didn't get
in the way of the legitimate emo
tions."
"[Scribner's intermediate fiction
writing class] is one of my favorite
classes," Ellickson said. "It's great to
hear other people's stories and to get
some advice from a pro."
Scribner is currently working on
his next novel, "Miracle Girl," a
story of a real-estate salesman for
the Catholic church, set in upstate
New York. He hopes to finish the
novel within the next year.
