## East Timor to become world's newest nation 
### 
JAKARTA. Indonesia (AP)
Indonesia's top legislative body dealt
what appeared to he a crushing blow
Wednesday to President H.J. Habi
bie's hopes of staying in office in a
session that also recognized F.ast
Timor's independence.
The 7(X)-member People's Con
sultative Assembly was to vote later
Wednesday on who will lead the
world's fourth most-populous coun
try in its continuing transition lrom
authoritarian rule to democracy.
The legislators voted 355-322 to
reject Habibie's speech defending his
controversial lb months in office.
That could prompt the ruling Golkar
Party to replace him as its nominee

in the presidential vote later
Wednesday.
Soon after the vote against I labi
bie, the special assembly endorsed
East Timor's independence referen
dum. paving the way for the half
island territory to become the
world's newest nation.
The decision brought some clo
sure to an emotional issue, although
the threat of attacks by pro-Indone
sia militias remains a serious concern
for the international peacekeeping
force in East Timor.
The actual handover of the terri
tory to a United Nations transitional
team is expected by the year's end.
Habibie was appointed to take

over the presidency when President
Suharto, his mentor, stepped down
in the face of violent protests after 32
years of iron-fisted rule.
In an emotional speech Monday,
Habibie urged Indonesians to let
him stay in office to continue demo
cratic reforms.
"I don't want to say goodbye. I
don't want to bid farewell," he told
several hundred soldiers and police
in central Jakarta.
Even before the assembly vote,
Habibie's chances of staying in office
were in serious doubt after Gen.
Wiranto, the defense minister and
commander of Indonesia's powerful
military, refused an invitation to be

his vice presidential candidate.
In his short time in office, 1 labibie
introduced some democratic chan
ges to Indonesia, but his popularity
has sunk because of his close ties to
Suharto and his inability to end
human rights abuses and corruption.
He also has been criticized for the
East Timor crisis, a banking corrup
tion scandal linked to his inner circle
and Indonesia's huge economic
problems.
Habibie had been expected to
stand as Golkar's candidate against
Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daugh
ter of the country's first president,
and Abdurrahman Wahid, the
founder of the Muslim-oriented

National Awakening Party.
The special assembly spent today
in speeches and statements before
finally bringing up the secret ballot
vote on 1 labibie.
The vote count went on past mid
night. and when it became clear
I labibie would lose, cheers erupted
from some in the hall.
The assembly then endorsed East
Timor's Aug. 30 vote to split from
Indonesia, which took control of the
former Portuguese colony in 1975.
Habibie agreed earlier this year
to allow East Timor's NSO.(XX) people
choose between independence or
autonomy within Indonesia.
East Timor's overwhelming vote

for independence led to a wave of
killing, looting and arson by pro-
Indonesian militias and their
Indonesian military allies that only
ended with the deployment of an
Australian-led multinational peace
keeping force.
While the assembly debated, as
many as S,(XX) Habibie supporters
marched from the central business
district toward parliament demand
ing the legislature not elect
Megawati, whose party won the
most of seats in parliament in a June
election but failed to win a majority.
Members will return later
Wednesday for the scheduled presi
dential selection.
