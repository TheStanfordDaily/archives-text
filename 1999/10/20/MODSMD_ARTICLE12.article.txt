## Editor's Notebook Changing directions 
### 
It's never too late to
do what you want

In a previous installment of the Edi
tor's notebook ("Undecided and
undeclared," Oct. 12, 1999), my col
league Kimherly Downs related her
quest to find direction in the form of a
major. Realizing during her freshman
year that her passion for medicine had
fizzled and died, she resigned herself to
spending more time sampling classes in
an attempt to find direction.
I feel that as a senior (read: "been
there, done that"), I might offer a little
reassurance and insight.
I too arrived at Stanford with very
clear academic goals in mind. I was dead
set on majoring in biology (though, for
those of you who care about these sorts
of things, I was most certainly not pre
med), a fact which established very clear
ly what classes I was going to take fall
quarter.
Unlike Kim, 1 derived little joy in writ
ing my CIV papers (CIV = I HUM with a
different name, for those of you who
weren't around when it still existed).
Mind you, I didn't exactly jump for joy at
the thought of doing chemistry problem
sets either. My eleetives freshman year
were always far more interesting and
accessible than the chemistry, but I still
stuck with biology.
I think I considered chemistry as some
thing of a necessary evil I had to endure
before 1 could take biology courses — the
broccoli before the ice cream, except I like
broccoli... but you get the point.
By the time I was in the middle of the
biology core my sophomore year, 1 was
feeling as though I was holding out for
the upper-division classes, since what 1
was doing at the time certainly wasn't ter
ribly stimulating. I trusted the fact that 1
still loved the subject as I always had. But
as it would turn out, the upper-division
classes weren't fun either.
It was the end of my fall quarter of
junior year that I found enough strength to
ask myself why I was doing this. I realized
it was pointless to keep holding out for the
next class to be better when I wasn't enjoy

ing any of them in the present.
With live courses left fora biology
major, I decided to switch to symbolic
systems, essentially starting completely
from scratch. It is a decision that I have
never regretted.
So what's the moral of the story? Well,
I think the "go with your heart" message
is pretty clear. Hut there's more.
First, it's never too late. I am graduat
ing on time, despite my late start, and
while I realize that there are some majors
that do demand a lot of units, it's not usu
ally the case that failing to start a major
during your freshman or even your
sophomore year will shut you out. If you
need the time to explore, by all means,
take it.
Second, I think that many people need
to remember that having started a major
is not necessarily a compelling reason to
continue it. It's pretty obvious to drop a
major if you absolutely loathe it, but
what if you're only lukewarm toward it?
Rather than resigning yourself to it, try
something new.
And finally, here's the scandalous bit:
your major does not have to define who
you are and what you're interested in.
Maybe at a given moment I'd be more
concerned about robot motion planning
than ecology. Hut that doesn't mean you
won't be able to find me on my hands
and knees watching ants forage, or with
my nose in a paleontology book. I am still
interested in biology. But it turned out
not to be the right major for me.
Find "direction" because the Univer
sity requires you to graduate with a
major. But remember that it's OK to con
tinue to be directionless throughout your
career with respect to your interests.
Switch majors midway through your
junior year if you want to, or bite the bul
let, take those last few classes and instead
go cra/.y with the electives, bearing in
mind that the AB or BS you end up get
ting does not doom you to one path for
the rest of your life.
To Kim and other aimless souls: it'll
probably work out in the end. Just have a
good time getting there.
