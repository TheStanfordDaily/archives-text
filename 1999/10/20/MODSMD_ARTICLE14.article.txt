# Fighting the good fight
## Corey Griffin The 						fallacy of student input 
### 
The Toyon Eating
Clubs. That refuge
of every sopho
more looking to get away
from the horrors of Uni
versity dining. That great
haven for graduate stu
dents who want a decent

meal.
Much has been said and speculated
about the fate of the Eating Clubs. The
people behind the Eating Clubs have
passed out surveys, and even the ASSU has
stepped in to create a Web-based survey to
see what the students think about them.
Student input has been sent en masse to the
administration, so that when the Eating
Clubs' lease expires, the University will
hopefully help them renew and renovate
the shanties now housing them.
How do we know that the fate of the
Eating Clubs wasn't decided long ago? I low
do we know that this student input will be
taken seriously? How do we know that the
designs for the new Branner / Toyon dining
hall aren't all ready to go? We don't, and
the track record so far doesn't make me too
optimistic.
Let's take the example of the impending
loss of parking for next year's freshmen.
The administration had meetings with resi
dent fellows and even students, and many at
these meetings came to the same conclu
sion: denying the freshman parking is not a
good idea.
The list of reasons against the no-frosh
parking policy is long. Gone will be the
bonding trips to the movies or Denny's late
at night. The lives of the residence staff
become even harder, especially in all-frosh
dorms. And in the end, it's not going to

solve the problem of parking on campus.
The two most important decisions hav
ing to do with residential life — the all
sophomore Toyon project and the Fresh
man-Sophomore College — received little
support from the student body at the time
they were announced. In fact, I'm sure the
upperclassmen in Wilbur are still a little
upset that freshmen are living in two-room
doubles (in Sterling Quad) while they sit
uncomfortably in one-room doubles.
Of course, students sat on the committee
that implemented these programs, but the
overwhelming wave of disapproval from the
student body makes you wonder how in
touch those students were with their peers
— or more likely, how much the other
members of the committee listened to the
students.
Of course, the administration (who 1
refer to as a collective, but is really just a
few individuals making the decisions) will
rattle off the reasons why these decisions
were made and then of course tell us that
they took "student input."
Really? Student input? That could range
from asking a student working in the Office
of Student Activities what they think to the
way to the surveys were conducted for the
Eating Clubs. In the end it seems like our
voice gets lost in the middle of administrators
trying to balance issues of money, pleasing
faculty and boosting Stanford's reputation.
As it stands now, it seems the adminis
tration only listens when someone goes on a
hunger strike (and now we get to live with
the "Grapes Vote" every year). I hate to
think that the only way to get your voice
really heard on this campus is to do some
thing that extreme.
So. who can be our voice? The only thing

the ASSU can seem to do is give us 24-hour
shuttles to downtown Palo Alto. The Daily
can help students he heard but is not the
same as a dialog with the administrators
who arc making decisions. A few students
on a committee can only speak for so many
people, but it is a step in the right direction
Surveys are inherently flawed, as only
the students that enjoyed a given experi
ence are going to fill out a survey. Would
you be willing to spend the time to fill out a
lengthy survey about something you were
indifferent about or outright disliked?
Town meetings might work if they were
actually publicized across the entire campus
and not just to specific groups such as resi
dent assistants.
Even if there is some ideal mechanism
for gauging student input, the problem still
exists: the students feel ignored. Only when
student concerns line up with the adminis
tration's desires does something get done.
Notice that the University has been tak
ing action to deal with the shortage of grad
uate student housing. More graduate stu
dent housing increases the quality of stu
dents recruited, which in turn raises the
level of research thus bringing the Universi
ty more prestige and money. Otherwise, the
administration might as well put all the sur
veys, e-mails and town meeting minutes in a
file marked "purge."
So, the question stands: when and how
will the students be heard? It's about time
we started talking about it.
