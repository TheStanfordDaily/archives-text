# Stanford program sings with innovation, outreach in 30th year
## For Lively Arts, all the Farm's a stage 
### Christina R. Stansell 
Stanford Lively Arts is known for
bringing big-name performers to
campus each year, but the program is
also seeking to engage performers
and audiences more closely with each
other and bringing nontraditional
artists and art forms into its mix.
This year, the program includes
Stanford community outreach efforts
such as the artist residency program,
a variety of non-traditional perfor
mances and discussion groups follow
ing performances.
In addition to its range of perfor
mances, Lively Arts also coordinates
educational events with artists. For
example, artists often participate in

residencies, which might include
master classes or workshops for Stan
ford students.
Public Relations Coordinator
Peter Cieply said he hopes that
through such educational activities.
Lively Arts can "reach out beyond
(the Stanford! eampus."
The program is celebrating its
30th anniversary this year with a line
up of music, dance and drama that il
luminates international culture. In
addition, chamber music, always a
"core" of the program, remains
strong tins year, according to ( ieplv.
This season began with the
Chopin Celebration, a performance
of Mozart's Don Giovanni and a
chamber music show by the Kronos

Quartet. The season continues
through mid-May.
Although early performances
have shown a classical influence,
Cieply said that future shows will in
clude more non-traditional music
and dance. A highlight of the season.
Artists fora Landmine Free World,

ris, Bruce Cockburn, Steve Earle,
Patty Griffin and Nanci Griffith. On
Dec. 1. the artists will collaborate for
