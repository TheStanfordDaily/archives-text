# Web-based Stanford. Who makes Whois private, fast
## 
### Mary Crisham 
In response to efficiency and pri
vacy concerns, Stanford's Informa
tion Technology Systems and Ser
vices has replaced the online directo
ry service Whois with the web-based
Stanford.Who. Sandy Senti, director
of Distributed Computing, said the
new system allows faster transmis
sion of updated entries and restricts
some information to the Stanford
community by requiring a login
name and password.
Stanford.Who is already in use
this quarter. The process of entering
and changing directory information
and finding others' information re
mains the same, but the efficiency
with which the information feeds
into Axess has improved, according
to Senti. The Whois program, with its
delayed filtering of changes through
the system, often resulted in out-of
date information.

Erika Soto, a sophomore, said the
faster updates would be more conve
nient. 'This year, I needed a friend's
phone number, and it gave me the
phone number from last year."
"Another reason for the new sys
tem is concern for privacy," Senti
said. Stanford.Who increases the
ability to control access to informa
tion. Although the new directory is
still available in its complete form to
the Stanford community, those with
out SUNet IDs can only access regis
tered e-mail addresses.
Junior Sayra Khandekar said she
was pleased with the new system.
"Students value their privacy, and
it's important that only members o!
the Stanford community access that
information," she said.
The site offers many new search
options, such as SUNet ID and de
partment or organization affiliation.
The new Web site can be accessed at
