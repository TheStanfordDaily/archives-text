# Surgery saves teen's leg

In the first reported case of its kind in North
America, Stanford surgeons have successfully
a new technique that gradually restores
flow to the limbs, to save a 16-year-old
patient from the prospect of amputation.
> Blood clots in limb arteries often occur dur
ing surgery, resulting in reduced blood flow
;imd ischemia, or lack of oxygen, to either the
iieart or legs. The process of restoring oxygen
•Jk> the ischemic tissue is called reperfusion.
tlnjury commonly results during reperfusion
Vhen blood flow is suddenly restored to tissues
buffering from prolonged lack of oxygen.
$ ITie new surgical technique, called con
trolled reperfusion, uses a special solution that
[Jnixes with the patient's blood. According to
Ihnken, a general surgery resident at Stan
ford Medical School, this mixture serves to
gradually restore blood flow to deoxygenated
thus avoiding injury.
The technique was first used in North
'"America on December 1997 at Stanford when
vi 16-year-old San Jose youth suffered compli
cations during surgery to correct a heart
•JJefect. During the surgery, the youth devel
oped a clot in a leg artery and showed signs of
losing all function in the limb, Ihnken said.
I* Fearing they would have to amputate the
Himb, the surgical team decided to apply con
trolled reperfusion. Doctors clamped the
blocked artery and inserted a tube just above
ihe arterial clot to withdraw some of the
blood. They then mixed the patient's
•JiUxkJ in a 6-to-l ratio with a buffered solution
salt, glucose, protein and other pro
jective elements.
> The mixture was slowly infused back into
the leg with a pump under relatively low pres
4jJ*re. The clamp was then removed, allowing
fflSc blood to flow freely. The entire procedure
Aok about 30 minutes, which is the critical
Sriod during reperfusion. "The initial 30 min
ims of reperfusion has to be controlled if you
He to avoid injury," Ihnken said.
SjThe procedure was successful, and the
walked out of the hospital in good

shape and has continued to do well, Ihnken
said.
According to Christopher Zarins, professor
of vascular surgery, when blood clots occur
that cut off blood supply to extremities, sur
geons thought that the best strategy was to try
and restore as much blood flow to the area as
possible.
"It's taken some research and investigation
to discover that the concept, which makes
empiric sense, isn't actually true," Zarins said.
"If the extremity has been deprived of blood
fora period of time, you should restore that
flow gradually, not with one big burst. There is
an adjustment to the ischemia and an adjust
ment back to health and if it's done in a con
trolled way to deal with the toxic products that
have accumulated, it allows the cells to recov
er."
The technique of controlled reperfusion
was first devised by Gerald Buckberg at
UCLA in the early 19905. It was initially
designed as a way to rescuing oxygen-starved
tissue in cardiac patients and preventing tissue
death that could lead to a heart attack.
Ihnken, who studied under Buckberg, took
the technique to Europe, where he applied the
technique to patients with oxygen-starved
limbs at the University of Frankfurt.
The method of controlled reperfusion has
since been used in more than 40 patients in
Europe who were found to have reduced
blood flow to either the heart or legs for as
much as 24 hours.
According to Ihnken, only those patients
who received controlled reperfusion for pro
longed lack of oxygen were able to avoid a
heart attack or systemic damage to other
organs, including the heart.
The new procedure could benefit thou
sands of patients each year that develop blood
clots in the leg. Historically, as many as half of
the patients who have these clots surgically
removed may die from complications, and as
many as 22 percent may undergo limb ampu
tation, according to Ihnken. The use of con
trolled reperfusion could prevent any possible
organ damage and spare the patients from the
ordeal of amputation.
