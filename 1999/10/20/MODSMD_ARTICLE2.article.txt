# Grads want meal choices

Stanford graduate students are
voicing anxiety about what they con
sider to be limited and problematic
eating options.
Although they do have the option
ofjoiningaself-operatedToyon Eat
ing Club, space for graduate students
is limited, and many are turned down
each year. Graduate students may
also apply to be eating associates at
Row houses.
The kitchen at Crothers Hall and
Breakers — a cooperative eating
£lub — are other alternatives. But
the Crothers Hall kitchen can pro
vide service to only 50students, forc
ing many residents to find food else
where.
Breakers is made up entirely of
graduate students, 90 percent of
whom are international. Members of
Breakers say that they enjoy the
privilege of cooking their own food
in the company of other graduate
students.
"Out of the eating clubs, Break
ers is the only one more or less
geared toward the lifestyle of a grad
uate student," said Jessica Tom, a
master's student in Mechanical En
gineering.
Despite the enthusiasm of its
members, the popularity of Breakers
lias recently declined, even as mem
bership in other eating clubs has in
creased. Meredyth krych. a psychol
ogy graduate student and a Breakers
member, said she believes the struc
ture of Breakers has to change.
"To accommodate more graduate
students and better run the business,
they need to make it an eating club
not a co-op." she said.
Kaleb Michaud. chair of the Grad
uate Student Council, said he has
heard a lot of complaints from stu

dents who would be affected by the
transformation of Breakers into a
self-operated club.
Proponents of the eating clubs will
face another obstacle soon, as the
Toyon I fall eating clubs may be de
molished in the next few years to
make room for academic buildings.
Keith (iuy of Stanford Dining Ser
vices said that in renovating the eat
ing clubs, it would make sense to
focus on graduate student needs.
"Given this current demand, it's
something we will look into — but
it's costly," said Guv. "There hasn't
been a graduate student group trying
to organize a place that would serve
graduate students exclusively."
