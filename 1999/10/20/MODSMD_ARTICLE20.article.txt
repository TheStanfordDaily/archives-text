# Sonic hedgehog for your hair
## 
### Jane Morril Contributing writer 
To all those who have found them
selves gawking unabashedly at the bald
spot on their professor's head, hoping that
they would not be so unfortunate as to fall
prey to nature's cruel male-pattern bald
ness, and to all those who have been the
victims of these stares, fear no more. New
hope may rest not in chemicals or wigs, but
in the rapidly growing field of gene thera
py-
In a recent issue of The Journal of Clin
ical Investigation, Dr. Ronald G. Crystal,
from the Weill Medical College of Cornell
University, reported that he and a team of
gene therapists had forced resting hair fol
licles of mice into growth by exposing the
cells to the activity of a gene known as
Sonic hedgehog, or SHH.
The versatile functions of SHH include
its role in patterning human organs such as
the pancreas, its segmentation of the brain
of the human embryo and its role in skin
development. In particular, SHH is
responsible for instructing each hair how
and when to form.
Crystal and his colleagues used an ade
novirus, a virus that causes the common
cold, to inject SHH into the hair follicle
cells of a mouse. They replaced the virus's
own self-replication genes with the SHH
gene.
Viruses are useful agents to distribute
genes to cells. They can invade a specific
cell and force it to make the products of
the genes they carry. "A virus delivers, like
a mailman, certain genes to certain
places," said Dr. Anthony Oro, a derma
tologist at Stanford Medical School.
The virus was injected into mice whose
hair follicles were in their resting phase. In
order to assure that they could distinguish
between existing and newly-grown hair.
Crystal bleached the mice with Clairol hair
dye. Sure enough, a few days later, sprouts
of black hair began to form at the sites
where the virus had been inserted. Further

analysis of these follicle cells showed SHI 1
activity in injected areas of the skin but
nowhere else.
So far. no experiments have been per
formed in humans, but it is very possible
that Sonic hedgehog or related genes
might trigger resting human hair follicles
into their growth phase. If the therapy did
work in humans, it would have to induce
enough thick hairs to be significant, and
would most likely require multiple injec
tions over the scalp. Oro said that it was
unclear how long it would be before this
therapy might be applied to human sub
jects.
Several factors may inhibit the intro
duction of the gene therapy to humans.
"When Sonic hedgehog goes bad it can
cause basal-cell carcinoma. We are trying
to look at how the same thing can cause
both hair growth and tumors," Oro said.
The gene would have to be delivered at
the right time and to the right cell in order
to fulfill all its functions. The challenge,
Oro specified, is to figure out how that

might work.
This is where Oro's research comes in.
I lis research focuses on the role of SHH in
skin development, how tumors arc formed
and what particular time is the best to
deliver the gene.
Research into skin development could
also lead to greater knowledge of how
SHH causes other organs to develop.
"The goal of our research is to try to
understand the development of skin and
hair growth. Hair is a microcosm of other
organs. If we understand how hair grows,
we may be able to understand how other
organs normally develop." said Oro.
Oro began his work with the SHH gene
when he was looking for genes which
played an important role in skin develop
ment. He now works in his own lab at
Stanford Medical School.
"This is an exciting area. If we can
understand and control Sonic hedgehog's
role in both tumors and hair growth, the
implications are leaps and bounds," said
Oro.

growth.
