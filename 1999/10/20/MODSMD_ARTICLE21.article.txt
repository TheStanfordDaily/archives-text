The first day of Orientation
freshman year seems a blur of
new faces, new acronyms and very
new dreadlocked RA's who myste
riously knew my name the moment
I stepped wide-eyed into the pande
monium of Alondra move-in.
But one memory that stands out
among the rest and will be with me
for many years to come was the mo
ment I met my roommate.
Trudging up to my door with
suitcases in hand and my mom in
tow. 1 craned my neck to read the
name next to mine On my door
the name of the roommate 1 would
spend the next year with. Being a
sports nut, you can imagine the ex
citement when I read off the name
of one of Stanford's most prized
athletic recruits. Little did I know
that this excitement could, in no
way. prepare me for the shock that
was to come.
The first ones to arrive at my
room, my mom and 1 set to work
putting clothes on hangars and
sheets on the bed.
That's when my roommate's
parents, both over six feet tall, came
walking into the room, followed by
my 6-foot, 9-inch roommate and
then his 6-10 twin brother.
An important aside here. I am, in
no way, the tallest person in the
world, measuring in at let's just say
a few inches shy of six feet. My
mom, on the other hand, is a few
inches shy of five feet.
All of a sudden, that seemingly
spacious Alondra double got just a
tad bit smaller. It was like being a
Liliputian trapped in the land of the
Amazon people (never mind the
fact that our room was book-ended
by the rooms of a member of the
women's volleyball team at 6-3 and
a member of the men's volleyball
team at 6-4).
My mom spent the entire after
noon with her neck craned, talking
to my roommate and his family. I
have a feeling she needed a visit to
the chiropractor to have her neck
realigned by the time she got back
to Texas.
Despite the obvious physical dis
similarities, Jarron Collins, my
roommate, and I became good
friends over the course of the year
and have stayed together into what
is now our junior year.
A great example of the differ
ences between us was the configura
tion of our room freshman year.
Above our closets near the ceiling
was a shelf that I used to store boxes
and my suitcase — items 1 wouldn't
need on a daily basis. Jarron kept
his shoes, toothbrush and cologne
in that same spot.
I have, of course, endured the
ribbing from friends at Stanford and
elsewhere about the slight differ
ence in size between the two ol us.
It's just not every day that you see
people of such diametrically opposed
heights in the same frame — Jarron
and Jason don't seem near as tall
standing on the basketball court next
to Tim Young and Mark Madsen.
The Parent's Weekend dinners
with our respective families are al
ways quality comedy. Last year, the
whole dining crowd at McArthur
Park seemed to turn their heads and
chuckle in unison when my mom

hugged Jason goodbye, somewhere
between his hip and his knee.
I find myself constantly fighting
an uphill battle against the great ex
aggerations in Jarron and my
heights.
Even the folks at Stanford Mag
azine couldn't quite get the height
difference right. This summer they
ran an extensive feature on the re
cent success of Stanford athletics.
One section of the story centered
around the unique situation here at
Stanford in which athletes are only
a part of the group of amazingly tal
ented students here on campus.
The author expounded on one
roommate pairing, dubbed the
"odd couple," where the room
mates were separated in height by
an astounding 17 inches. Who could
that be? You guessed it.
A good friend of mine and for
mer Daily sports editor who was
Jason Collins* roommate for two
years is noted in the article for his
academic talents and high SAT
scores. I called him after 1 saw a
copy of the story and remarked,
"great. I guess you're the genius and
I'm just the midget."
The article was a great piece, but
they missed one extremely impor
tant fact — Jarron and I are sepa
rated by only 13 inches. Jarron is 6-
9 and I measure in at 5-8. Okay, re
ally only 5-7. but 5-8 in the right
shoes . . . with my hair sticking
straight up.
Living with Jarron and Jason has
definitely changed my perspective
about just what exactly "tall" is. Be
fore meeting the twins. 1 would
have said someone 6-3 or 6-4 was
definitely in the tall category. Now.
it takes someone in the high six-foot
range just to get my attention.
All joking aside. I feel living with
Jarron has been one of the high
lights of my time here at Stanford.
I cannot speak more highly of
the university policy that does not
separate athletes into special dorms
cordoned off from the rest of the
students. Stanford Magazine's arti
cle was right on track in describing
Stanford's immensely talented ath
letes as just a part of the group of
students here, all of whom bring
some special attribute to the univer
sity community.
Talking with friends at other
schools, many have never met a sin
gle varsity athlete. In just three
years. I've had the opportunity to
live with student-athletes who have
starred on the collegiate playing
fields, will certainly win Olympic
medals in the years to come and
may join the ranks of the profes
sionals in their various sports.
Fora sports enthusiast such as
myself. I can only think of the joy
that will come as I enjoy sporting
events in the future with my chil
dren or grandchildren and can tell
them of the times I spent with the
very athletes they are watching
compete. The midnight runs to Jack
in the Box. The friendships. These
are the things I will remember.

Hen Jones is a junior majoring in in
ternational relations. He and his
roommate will take on any two
room double in basketball, any time,
any plaee.
