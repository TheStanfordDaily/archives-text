# Hockey wins battle of East vs. West
## Stanford squad brings home three key victories from East-Coast road trip 
### Ashley Rich Contributing writer 
After a whirlwind trip to Philadel
phia to play four games in four days,
the Stanford field hockey team (7-7.
4-0 Northern Pacific Conference) re
turns with three wins and one loss
under its belt.
The trip didn't start off too well.
When the shuttle showed an hour
late the team missed its (light by 10
minutes and arrived in Philadelphia
five hours later than expected. But
luckily, the team was riding on an
adrenaline surge that began last
Monday when the Cardinal lost a
game it could have won.
The sting of that loss didn't die as
the team prepared for the five-day
roadtrip. Instead, it festered until the
team was able to hit the field again
and prove itself.
The team's energy was almost vis
ible upon entering the field for the
first game at Temple I Jniversity. The
Cardinal was intense and focused,
but relaxed enough to enjoy the game
the same time.
Stanford began the game with au
thority when senior defender Julie
Ciwo/dz scored a solid shot in a
penalty corner, and several break
aways later, a cross ball from fresh
man Amanda Billmyer was passed
from senior forward Lindsey Duna
gan to junior Michelle Scott for the
second Cardinal goal. Temple came
back to score in the second half, but it

didn't threaten the Cardinal and the
pace kept steady as Temple barely
posed another threat.
The confidence from that game
carried over to Friday when Stanford
faced Ivy League competitor Penn
sylvania in the Penn stadium at night.

That excitement from playing under
the lights hit both teams as the pace of
the game was quick and intense from
the beginning. Penn scored within the
first 10 minutes, but the Cardinal
never slowed down, as if it didn't re
alize that Penn had scored. There

were several breakaways by the Car
dinal attack, but several were lost due
to unclean passes that were picked up
by the other team and none of them
made it to the goal.
