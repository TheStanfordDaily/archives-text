# Hockey wins battle of East vs. West
## Stanford squad brings home three key victories from East-Coast road trip 
### Ashley Rich Contributing writer 
After a whirlwind trip to Philadel
phia to play four games in four days,
the Stanford field hockey team (7-7.
4-0 Northern Pacific Conference) re
turns with three wins and one loss
under its belt.
The trip didn't start off too well.
When the shuttle showed an hour
late the team missed its (light by 10
minutes and arrived in Philadelphia
five hours later than expected. But
luckily, the team was riding on an
adrenaline surge that began last
Monday when the Cardinal lost a
game it could have won.
The sting of that loss didn't die as
the team prepared for the five-day
roadtrip. Instead, it festered until the
team was able to hit the field again
and prove itself.
The team's energy was almost vis
ible upon entering the field for the
first game at Temple I Jniversity. The
Cardinal was intense and focused,
but relaxed enough to enjoy the game
the same time.
Stanford began the game with au
thority when senior defender Julie
Ciwo/dz scored a solid shot in a
penalty corner, and several break
aways later, a cross ball from fresh
man Amanda Billmyer was passed
from senior forward Lindsey Duna
gan to junior Michelle Scott for the
second Cardinal goal. Temple came
back to score in the second half, but it

didn't threaten the Cardinal and the
pace kept steady as Temple barely
posed another threat.
The confidence from that game
carried over to Friday when Stanford
faced Ivy League competitor Penn
sylvania in the Penn stadium at night.

That excitement from playing under
the lights hit both teams as the pace of
the game was quick and intense from
the beginning. Penn scored within the
first 10 minutes, but the Cardinal
never slowed down, as if it didn't re
alize that Penn had scored. There

were several breakaways by the Car
dinal attack, but several were lost due
to unclean passes that were picked up
by the other team and none of them
made it to the goal.


Rosaleen O'Gara â€” Daily file
Freshman midfielder / defender Liz Ott, seen here against UC-Santa Barbara, played a key role on the
Stanford field hockey team that went 3-1 on its four-game, East Coast road trip last weekend.
"We were a hit frantic out there at
first. I was a hit frantic out there,"
Amanda Billmver. a Pennsylvania
native who was one of the many who
was playing in front of family, friends,
former coaches and teammates, said.
"Julie |( iwo/d/| had to tell me to

relax, calm down. Then I was able to
focus a little more. We all did. That
changed the tone of the game. We
kept telling each other 'this is our
game.'"
After that second half, it did be
come their game. The passes became
cleaner, their shots more threatening,
their battle to tie the match more seri
ous. With seven minutes left in the
game, the Cardinal was awarded a

penalty stroke when a Penn defender
illegally blocked a shot on goal with
her foot.
Star shooter Gwo/dz, who is now
3 for 3 in penalty strokes in games,
stepped up to the cage and launched
one into the left corner of the goal to
tie the game.
Now tied, both teams kept up the
intensely quick pace. Penn threat
ened to score several times, earning

one penalty corner after another.
With two minutes remaining in the
game, one sloppy corner play slipped
past the receiver at the top of the
shooting circle, where Gwozdz sent
the ball 50 yards to Billmyer, who was
waiting at Penn's circle. Dodging
Penn defenders, she crossed the hall
to Scott, who tipped the hall in just
past the keeper, who was sliding out
to tackle her. Penn. exhausted, was

unable to regain its lead.
Saturday's game against NorPac
contender Davis & Elkins turned into
a blowout as Stanford outshot its op
ponent 35-3 en route to a 9-0 win.
Eight different Stanford players con
tributed to the victory with either a
goal or an assist in the game. Fresh
man Dalinda Banuelos opened the
game early with a goal only 85 sec
onds into the game. Bv halftime.

three goals from Banuelos and two by
fellow freshman Amanda Billmyer
combined fora 5-0 lead.
After halftime, the Cardinal ex
panded that lead to nine as sopho
more Melissa Stai and senior I .indsey
Dunagan added to the scoreboard,
and sophomore Erica Swesey put in
two.
The last game of the trip was
against Ivy League-member Colum
bia University. Although Stanford
dominated the game and outshot Co
lumbia 12-4. one goal, eoming on a
penalty corner within the first five
minutes of the game, gave the Lions
the lead a they wouldn't relinquish.
The Cardinal stepped up to the
fast pace of the game and provided
great passing and several close
breakaways, but had trouble finish
ing the plays to goal. Stanford had
ample chance to score with 18 penal
ty shots compared to Columbia's
three, but could never find the net
"That's the nature of this game,"
said head coach Sheryl Johnson.
"1 think we dominated the game
and had some really, close plays. But
it only takes one shot, one goal and it
was Columbia's lucky day."
This trip was not the first time the
team has seen teams from back East,
but it was evident that this weekend
was crucial in improving the team's
poise under pressure.
One reason is that, now near the
end of the season, the young team is
playing more as a cohesive unit.
"The team is playing really well
together now. We have more expe
rience under our belts." Said John
son.
Another key to Stanford's success
was the strength in the midfield. In
those close games where the ball
changed possession often, it helped
to have effective midfield players
who were able to transition between
calmly defending the goal and posing
as scoring threats.
Senior captains Mallory Cham
bers and Sarah Medeiros led the mid
lield line with consistent control of
incoming breakaways. They were
able to step up and intercept passes
and effectively pass them to the wait
ing forwards.
"Their possession skills and pass
ing in the midfield have set up some
key goals for us this season." Johnson
said.
