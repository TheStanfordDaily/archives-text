# Volleyball tames Tigers at Maples
## 
### Ellie Ritch Contributing writer 
The No. 7 Stanford women's
volleyball team wanted to show the
world it has what it takes to play
with the big guys.
Now it's a fact that the Cardinal
not only has what it takes to plav.
but also the stuff to win.
Stanford (15-2) toppled No. 3
Pacific (17-2) in five games last
night at Maples Pavilion in a fist
clenching, emotionally-charged
match.
This key, nonconfere nee victory
extended the Cardinal's home win
streak to an incredible 36 matches
and showcased the immense ability
of the 1999 Cardinal squad.
The women's squad squared off
against the Tigers expecting a tight
match. What it got was more of a
battle.
The women's squad dominated
most of the first two games despite
the fact that Pacific was able to
bring the match to 14 all in the first
game after the Cardinal had
jumped out to an early 14-7 lead.
The fire which carried the squad
through the first two games
seemed to have been temporarily
extinguished as the Tigers took the
third and fourth games.
The tension on the floor was un
bearable as the fifth game com
menced. and Stanford leaped
ahead to an N-4 lead. This tempo
rary buffer was slowly chipped
away until Pacific found itself
ahead 11-9.
At this stage, Stanford buckled
down, and never lost the lead
again. Exuberant Stanford fans lit

crally danced in celebration of
each Stanford point.
The increased momentum of
the Pacific squad in the latter
stages of the match can be attrib
uted in part to Elsa Stegemann. the
Tigers' star senior outside hitter.
Stegemann was rather quiet the
first two games, but finished with
29 kills for the night.
Stanford countered with the
tandem of senior middle blocker
Keri Walsh and freshman outside
hitter Logan Tom, who combined
fora total of 41 kills on the night.
Walsh added a strong defensive
performance, racking up a season
high 2b digs to compliment her of
fensive presence.
Redshirt freshman outside hit
ter Lindsey Yamasaki also chipped
in 10 kills for the Cardinal, and ju
nior setter Lindsay Kagawa tallied
a match-high 49 assists.
Tom noted that Stegemann was
a major force to reckon with, espe
cially her coined angle shots and
jump serves. "Our middles played
hard and did their best to stop her
shot," said Tom.
The Stanford women's volley
ball team is now in a much different
position than it was after a disap
pointing loss to IJCLA less than
two weeks ago.
The win over the Tigers sends a
message that the Cardinal is a force
to be reckoned with, not only in the
Pacific 10 Conference, but on the
national scene.
"We made a strong point
tonight that we are a big team out
there. And winning at Maples al
lows us to continue our home win
streak as well," said Tom.
