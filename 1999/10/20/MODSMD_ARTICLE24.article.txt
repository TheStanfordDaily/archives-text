# Men's squad looks to avenge last year's early exit from NCAA tourney
## Tennis seeks to regain championship form 
### Sameer Ahmed Contributing writer 
After winning an unprecedented four national
championships in a row from 1995-98. last year's
first-round loss to Baylor in the final 16 of the
NCAA Championships seemed to be devastating
for the Stanford men's tennis team, who finished
the season ranked eighth in the country.
Although last year's defeat was the earliest exit
from the final 16 for the Cardinal since 1977. with
five starters returning and four outstanding Iresh
men, this year's team is definitely ready to compete
for another national championship in May.
The team has already demonstrated its domi
nating form this past week at the 11 A Men s I en
nis All-American Championship in Austin. Texas.

Sophomore K.J. Hippenstcel. ranked 26th in the
country, captured the singles title, while teammates
senior Geoff Abrams and junior Alex Kim, ranked
fifth in the country, won the doubles title. Also,
freshman David Martin won the consolation sin
gles title.
" This tournament is one of the four Grand
Slams in collegiate tennis," assistant coach John
Whitlinger said. " The team's accomplishments
demonstrate that we are headed in the right direc
tion after our loss to Baylor last year. The victories
were a great confidence-builder, but it is still w;iv to
early to predict any future results."
In addition to the ITA Men's Tennis All-Amer
ican Championship, the team participated in the
W IT National Collegiate Tennis Championship ;»t
Stanford's Taube Family Tennis Stadium from

Oct. I -3. Although this tournament was a coed ex
hibition. the team performed very well, rebound
ing from a first-round loss to capture the consola
tion title.
While Hippensteel, Abrams and Kim automat
ically qualify for another collegiate Grand Slam,
the 11A Individual Indoor Championship in Dal
las. Texas, from Feb. 3-6. their teammates will at
tempt to qualify for the championship with other
West-Coast schools at the lIA Indoor Qualifying
Tournament in Seattle from Nov. f>-9.
Although these tournaments in the fall are ex
tremely important to the individual rankings of the
players, the team competition doesn't begin until
winter quarter when Stanford plays I lawaii on Jan.
26th. That is when the men's tennis
team will begin to find out how well it
needs to play to win another national
championship.
"It would he rare if we weren't one
of the teams that has a good chance at
winning the NCAA tournament,"
head coach Dick Gould said. "But
because of the number of foreigners,
transfers and players who take the
fall semester off at other schools, we

won't know how good we will be until
the winter when everyone is at full
strength."
One of the team's most important
advantages is its depth and experi
ence. The only player the team lost
from last year was captain and No. 1
player Ryan Wolters. To make up for
the loss of Wolters, who finished last
season ranked No. 4 in the country,
the team has added four extremely
talented freshmen. The freshmen.
Martin, Carter Morris, Scott Lipsky
and Ryan Haviland. were all ranked
in the top seven in the country some

time during high school.
"The freshmen bring tremendous
depth to the team." Gould said.
"There will be a lot of competition for
starting positions this year. I his com
petition within the team should make
everyone better during the crucial
part of the season."
The coaches-plan to evaluate the
players' performances during the fall
tournaments and inner-squad match
es to determine individual seeds.
Gould wants to.lind the most advan
tageous lineup*to put the top six
players in the sfjots that will help the
team win. bv Feb. 24, the start of the
National Team Indoor Champi
onship in Louisville, Kv.
"While our one-two-three [seed
ed] matches will always be tough no
matter who we play against. I think
our strength lies down below with our
four, five and six players, potentially
all freshmen." Hitlingcr said. "To be
successful this year, they all have to
play extremely well."
With their experience and talent,
Gould cannot find any major weak
ness in this year's team so far.
"Last year 1 thought our doubles
teams might have been a problem,
but our No. 1 team. Wolters and I lip
pensteel, won the NCAA champi
onship and our No. 2 and No. 3 dou
bles played extremely well also."
Gould said. "The only question this
year is putting the right players to
gether."
But at the same time, the coaches
are taking nothing for granted.
"Our players need to get better
every day," Hitlingcr said. "There is
not a question in my mind that we
have a chance to contend for the na
tional championship."
