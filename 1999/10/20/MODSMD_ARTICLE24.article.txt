## Tennis seeks to regain championship form 
### Sameer Ahmed Contributing writer 
After winning an unprecedented four national
championships in a row from 1995-98. last year's
first-round loss to Baylor in the final 16 of the
NCAA Championships seemed to be devastating
for the Stanford men's tennis team, who finished
the season ranked eighth in the country.
Although last year's defeat was the earliest exit
from the final 16 for the Cardinal since 1977. with
five starters returning and four outstanding Iresh
men, this year's team is definitely ready to compete
for another national championship in May.
The team has already demonstrated its domi
nating form this past week at the 11 A Men s I en
nis All-American Championship in Austin. Texas.

Sophomore K.J. Hippenstcel. ranked 26th in the
country, captured the singles title, while teammates
senior Geoff Abrams and junior Alex Kim, ranked
fifth in the country, won the doubles title. Also,
freshman David Martin won the consolation sin
gles title.
" This tournament is one of the four Grand
Slams in collegiate tennis," assistant coach John
Whitlinger said. " The team's accomplishments
demonstrate that we are headed in the right direc
tion after our loss to Baylor last year. The victories
were a great confidence-builder, but it is still w;iv to
early to predict any future results."
In addition to the ITA Men's Tennis All-Amer
ican Championship, the team participated in the
W IT National Collegiate Tennis Championship ;Â»t
Stanford's Taube Family Tennis Stadium from

Oct. I -3. Although this tournament was a coed ex
hibition. the team performed very well, rebound
ing from a first-round loss to capture the consola
tion title.
While Hippensteel, Abrams and Kim automat
ically qualify for another collegiate Grand Slam,
the 11A Individual Indoor Championship in Dal
las. Texas, from Feb. 3-6. their teammates will at
tempt to qualify for the championship with other
West-Coast schools at the lIA Indoor Qualifying
Tournament in Seattle from Nov. f>-9.
Although these tournaments in the fall are ex
tremely important to the individual rankings of the
players, the team competition doesn't begin until
winter quarter when Stanford plays I lawaii on Jan.
