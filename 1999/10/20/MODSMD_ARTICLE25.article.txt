### Brett Kaufman 
Wednesday signals the start of a
busy two weeks for the No. Stan
ford men's golf team as it hosts IJC-
Davis for an 18-hole dual match at
the Stanford Golf Course.
It continues through the weekend
with team qualifying at the Stanford
Golf Course, then hosts an impres
sive field at the Nelson Invitational
the following weekend.
Hut head coach Wally Goodwin
understands that before he worries
about winning a tournament, he
must first know who will be playing

in it.
"The match against Davis is a
double-whammy for us," Goodwin
said. "It gives us a chance to play in a
competitive environment and a
chance to qualify."
The Cardinal will play eight team
members and count the Itest seven
scores against the Aggies.
The dual match is doubly impor
tant to Stanford â€” it is not only a
chance to compete against an in-state
rival, but serves as the first round of
team qualifying for the upcoming
