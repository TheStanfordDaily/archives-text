# Men's golf set to tee it up against Aggies
## 
### Brett Kaufman 
Wednesday signals the start of a
busy two weeks for the No. Stan
ford men's golf team as it hosts IJC-
Davis for an 18-hole dual match at
the Stanford Golf Course.
It continues through the weekend
with team qualifying at the Stanford
Golf Course, then hosts an impres
sive field at the Nelson Invitational
the following weekend.
Hut head coach Wally Goodwin
understands that before he worries
about winning a tournament, he
must first know who will be playing

in it.
"The match against Davis is a
double-whammy for us," Goodwin
said. "It gives us a chance to play in a
competitive environment and a
chance to qualify."
The Cardinal will play eight team
members and count the Itest seven
scores against the Aggies.
The dual match is doubly impor
tant to Stanford — it is not only a
chance to compete against an in-state
rival, but serves as the first round of
team qualifying for the upcoming
tournament at the Stanford Golf
Course.
The Cardinal's Nelson Invitation
al lineup will include only five team

members. With captain Dusty Brett
exempt from qualifying, only four
spots remain with seven players vying
for them.
In Wednesday's match, Gcx)dwin
will pair Brett and junior Alex
Aragon, whose impressive play thus
far has earned him the No. 35 ranking
in the country.
Brett and Aragon have been the
team's most consistent players during
the fall season and hope to find out
exactly where their individual games
stand on Wednesday.
" This match is simply a gauge on
where we are since the last tourna
ment," Aragon said.
Aragon and freshman George-
Downing are just two of the seven
players with roster spots on the line
Wednesday.
Juniors lx*e and Eric Dahlberg,
sophomore transfer Philip Rowe and
freshmen Jim Seki and Ron Won will
also attempt to qualify for the Nelson
as part of the UC-Davis dual match.
Qualifying for the Cardinal will
continue on Saturday and Sunday at
SC i(' as well.
UC-Davis is a Division 11-A pro
gram, but the Aggies have been im
pressive so far this fall.
They won the Pacific Invitational
in late September with many Division
1-A teams attending and finished in
the top 15 in two other tournaments.
Davis features a young, talented
group, similar to the Cardinal. The
top three qualifiers for the Aggies,
Jason Boyd, Matt Lashua and Will
Johnson, are all sophomores.
"Our sophomores have led the
way so far." head coach Cy Williams
said. " They have been very impres
sive."
