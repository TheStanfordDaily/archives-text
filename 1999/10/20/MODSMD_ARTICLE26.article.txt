l or many athletes, participating in
, \arsity sport adds fun. challenge
..iid support from teammates to their
Stanford experience.
I or Mary Huang, competing on
i women's cross country team has
i (.led .1 strength and ability to deal
with challenges that has helped her
i t only athletically, hut also in her
... idemic pursuits.
I luaiig is a fourth-year undergrad
n te majoring in Human Biology,
d a co-terminal student in Biologi
i I sciences. Originally from Provo.
I ah. she feels her athletic pursuits
I ve enhanced her academic pur
suits, and vice-versa.
I don't think I can ever describe
i Stanford experience'without the
ii lusion of running cross country. I
i member when I was struggling with
|i human biology core. I decided to
i studying every day instead of
•.ramming the night before the
l uns. It's ;i simple thing, I knew that
T principle of daily practice worked
v II for running. You can't run your
i. udest the night before a big race
and expect to do well.
I think running also provides a
11 <>! laboratory to think about
•me of the stuff I learn in biology.
\ lien learning about how the body
.esses energy in one of mv biology
isses. per sc. I immediately try to
lire out how that works when I'm
i lining," saicl I luang.
( ioing into her fourth year com
I ling for Stanford, I luang brings ex
; licnce at both Pacific lOChampi
< iships and NCAA championships.
She led the Stanford women at the
< I. Ml .ong Beach Invitational.
Running was a way of life for her
i cn before arriving at Stanford.
\s a citizen ol Taiwan she holds
II ii national records there for the
live kilometer and 10 kilometer
11 1 ns. She wants to compete profes

sionally for them fora year or two
after she graduates.
Her biggest assets in the cross
country world boil down to two vital
things: her attitude and her love of the
sport.
One major challenge for Huang
reaffirmed her love of the sport and
changed the way she felt with the
frustrations that are bound to come
along.
"I think one of the best experi
ences that have helped me was when
I went through a period in my life
when I didn't want to run anymore. I
even stopped going to practice fora
few weeks. When challenges arose, I
started to make them reasons for why
I should let up and quit. But I realized
after that, and have affirmed it since
then, that I want to be a runner and
that I want to run and run competi
tively for at least a few more years
down the road," she said.
The mental strength that pulls a
runner through the tough stretches of
a race can also be applied to other
areas of life. That strength has given
II Liang a new ability to deal with chal
lenges athletic and academic.
"Now, when challenges arise, I
look at them as something to defeat. I
find myself'saying stuff like 'nothing's
going to stop me,' or 'no one is going
to stop me.' I know that I want to run
and to run fast.
"Running is one of those types of
sports in which you are in total con
trol of your body and how fast it can
go. so essentially, no one can stop
me," said I luang.
While many people come back
huffing and puffing from a Campus
Drive loop complaining bitterly
about the pain of running, Huang's
favorite thing both about the sport of
cross country and about running in
general is the feeling she gets while
she's doing it.
" The feeling is everywhere — my
body feels exhausted, yet full of ener
gy. My mind feels refreshed, focused

and alive. So my favorite thing about
running is the actual feeling itself. I
also love being outdoors, breathing
fresh air, and breathing side by side
with my teammates," she said.
Although she competes because
she loves the sport. Huang also ap
preciates the friendships and bonds
she has made with other girls on the
team. I ler teammates play an integral
part of her life.
"It's so special to have 25 or so
other friends who are all just as pas
sionate about running as you are
pursuing similar goals, going through
similar struggles and victories togeth
er.
•'I don't expect there to be any
thing like this when I graduate. Plus, I
have also developed some of my
strongest friendship bonds with my

teammates," said I luang.
Although she doesn't see the team
bonds as being something she will be
able to find after graduation, she
plans on continuing to run competi
tively for the next few years, and for
enjoyment for the rest of her life.
"I definitely want to continue run
ning. that's for sure. I have this tradi
tion that I started with my high school
running mate Tara Rohatinsky.
Every birthday I have, I run my age
[in miles].
"I've been doing it since I was 15
or so. When I turn 50,1 plan todivide
my age by two. This is one tradition I
am definitely keeping when I gradu
ate.
"I was also thinking about running
some marathons. I think I have a lot
of endurance, and would love to see

how I would do in marathons," said
Huang.
The role she plavs on the team is
integrally connected to the strong
connections she feels with other indi
viduals on the team.
"I think the best way 1 can con
tribute to the team is to run as fast as
1 can. In the end, we're a team that
wants to run well and win.
"But I think on the day-to-day
basis, I think I play a positive role on
the team. I don't think I'm the most
social person on the team, nor do I
take the lead or center of attention.
But I don't think I'm a complete out
sider either. I do feel a connection to
the team, but I think I feel an even
stronger one with individuals on the
team — more so than the idea of the
team itself," I luang said.
