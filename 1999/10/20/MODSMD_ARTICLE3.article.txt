This weekend, the second annual
United Nations Association Film
Festival will bring award-winning
documentaries from around the
world to Stanford.
Organized by the Stanford Film
Society and the UNA Midpeninsula
Chapter, the festival starts Thursday
at 6:30 p.m. and continues through
Sunday. It consists of 26 documen
taries on the theme of "Building a
Society for All Ages." The films
range from two to 9() minutes in
length and are set in Russia, Canada,
Taiwan, Colombia, Italy, Israel and
other countries.
The main goal of the film festival,
according to festival director Jasmi
na Bojic, a lecturer in the depart
ment of Slavic Languages and Liter
ature, is for people "to be inspired to
get more information about the facts
that they see on the screen and learn
from the filmmakers — to get in
spired to go search for the real
truth."
Bojic, a board member for both
the UN Midpeninsula Chapter and
the Stanford Film Society, said she
and others developed the idea of
bringing international documentary
filmmakers to Stanford last year.
The result was a film festival — the
only one of its kind in the country —
consisting of documentaries on top
ics related to the UN: human rights.
