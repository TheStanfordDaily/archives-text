Before leaving their homes be
hind. students hoping to attend
Stanford beginning in the year 2(M)()
will be asked to take a look back and
reflect on what has made them who
they are. Two new essay questions
on the undergraduate application
focus on students' background and
sense of tradition.
Prospective students choose be
tween two questions. The first ques
tion asks applicants to consider how
the place in which they live has in
fluenced them. The second asks stu
dents to explain a tradition which is
currently a part of their lives or a tra
dition they would like to create.
"1 think they're good questions,
but they seem to be a bit exclusive,"
said freshman Jon Glassman. (ilass
man said he thought students who
have a background that is not rich in
tradition could be alienated by a
question that centers on tradition as
an integral part of life.
Last year, applicants were asked
to either attach and explain a small
photograph of an object of personal
importance or reflect on the subject
of a book they would like to write.
According to Robert Kinnally,
dean of Admissions, the admissions

staff made the changes to stimulate
deep thinking in prospective stu
dents.
"The book question didn't work
at all." said Kinnally. "We want to
really get students thinking."
Freshman Suzanne Mikawa said
she felt both questions were better
than last year's choices.
"1 like [the new questions] much
better," said Mikawa. "For me, tra-

"We want to be sure that we give
students enough opportunities to
tell us as much information about
themselves as possible, " said Kin
nally. "The important part is to get

students thinking."
Kinnally said that although it is
still early in the application process,
reactions to the new questions have
been positive. The undergraduate
admissions staff meets every year to
review the admissions process, so ;i
decision on whether to keep the new
questions or change them will be
made then.
"Maybe we'll keep them, maybe
we'll change them again," Kinnallv
said.
