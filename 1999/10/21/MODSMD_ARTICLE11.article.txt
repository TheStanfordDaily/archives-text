New application questions
will induce critical thinking
by potential students

In order to stimulate deeper think
ing in prospective students, new
essay questions will be introduced
in the application for the Class of
2(X)4.
The first of the two new questions
asks applicants to explain how the
place in which they lived influenced
the person that they are, and the sec
ond asks them to talk about a tradi
tion (either one they observe or
would like to observe) and talk about
why it is or would be important to
them. In the past, students could
either attach a small photograph of
something important to them and
explain its significance, or they could
explain what the theme or subject
matter of a book they might write
would be and why it would have that
particular focus.
The new questions hit the mark in
making a student think deeply about
who he or she really is. ITie main ben

ty, it w()3klsoem, would be to makiTf
easier to recognize people who are
able to think critically, which is what a
research university such as this one
should strive for.
However, these questions have the
potential to serve another purpose,
which may or may not help Stanford.
In general, students in high school
have no idea what to truly excpect
from college. Can any student on
campus think back to high school and
claim that they've gotten what they
expected?
Many students spend their applica
tion processes worried over less-pcr
sonal matters: Who will take me? Can
I get into a top-notch university?

In this confusion, the bigger picture
can get lost. Students may forget to
look for the institution that would
give them the best lit. Prestige can
often overshadow practicality, which
is readily seen when students interest
ed in one area of study are disap
pointed with the structure or quality
of that specific department.
Students often look at the colleges
and universities as a whole, some
times forgetting that the whole is a
sum of its parts.
One problem with the new ques
tions is that they are both set primari
ly in the past. They do a poor job of
asking a prospective student to evalu
ate goals and desires for the future.
The lack of opportunity lor applicants
to address the future limits creativity,
an aspect that the questions on last
year's applications encouraged, albeit
a little too much.
Addressing the past, present and
future in one question is a difficult
task which could easily lead to less
focused answers, and as the format
stands now, high-school students are
only required to answer one of two
proposed questions.
The university would benefit from
requiring its applicants to answer both
questions and focusing the second on
future aspirations and expectations.
The application's essay questions
would then cover a wider variety of
topics without forcing students to fit
too many varying themes into one
short piece, leading to a generic
answer. It may be a little more work,
but what student is going to complain
when his or her academic future is
what's being considered?
Stanford University prides itself
on the diversity of its student body,
ethnically, socially, theologically and
culturally. These new application
questions are a strong step in the
right direction for reinforcing that
pride.
