A long-awaited Daily dose
of humor
It has always been my habit to accompa
ny my morning bowl of Chocolate-Frosted
Sugar Bombs with the morning paper. The
comics, especially, seem to assist in the
digestive process.
Unfortunately, The Daily has never been
able to satisfy this particular need for me, as
I have never found any of its "comics"
remotely humorous. Happily, this changed

about a week ago when, while doing the
crossword puzzle, I chanced to notice a sin
gle panel depicting two rabbits holding a
conversation, hidden away in the classified
ads. It sounds bizarre, I realize, but it was
quite funny. I laughed loudly enough to
wake up the person sitting beside me in lec
ture.
The next day I eagerly turned to the
same page and was rewarded with another
cartoon — actually the same panel but with
different words. In addition, next to the

panel was another humor hit in the guise of
a want-ad but advertising for a prosthetic
surgeon to "create lifelike replacement for
tragic paw loss. Original attached to key
chain of some bastard who will be less lucky
when I catch up to him with my shotgun."
Once again. 1 woke up my neighbor.
Since then, all manner of random
humorous hits have turned up in the classi
fied section. I do not know who is responsi
ble for this interjection of humor into the
previously laugh-less pages of The Daily,

but I would like to laud him for his work. 1
would suggest that the person or persons
responsible for this take the place of The
Daily's current feature, "Piled Higher &
Deeper," and provide us with some actual
humor in the morning.
