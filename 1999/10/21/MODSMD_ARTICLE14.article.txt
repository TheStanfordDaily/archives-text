# Meaning in the macro
## Sasha Polansky Wanting to kick some ass 
### 
At 9 a.m., an
obnoxious car
horn's crow-call
pierced through my sleep,
even more painful than my
alarm clock. I began to
fantasize about marching
outside with an aluminum

bat and whacking the screech to a tri
umphant silence. 1 could sense glass break
ing, and it made me smile. I could imagine
denting metal, and it made me laugh.
Suddenly I was disturbed. What was driv
ing this excessive outpour of aggression?
The need for sleep was a probable cause.
Yet I wondered whether something else was
behind the ecstasy elicited in my abusive
role-play. Is there perhaps an inherent force
that urges us all to occasionally crave kicking
some ass? 1
1 feci Js?b!a certain sales clerk at Macy's
would tend to say yes. I met this charming
woman last week when I entered the store
hoping to return two pairs of pants. She
responded to my request as if I had asked
her to dry-clean each pair personally and
drive them to my house in Boston. Not a
smile. Not a "Yes, I'll be right with you."
Not even a "Sure, did you want to exchange
those for anything?"
"Did you get them HERE?" she asked.
Yes.
"In THIS store?" Yes.
"In THIS department? You SURE?" Oh
yes.
"Well do you have the receipt?" Indeed.
Yet, there was a tag missing from one pair of
pants. (iod help me when she figured it out.
"You can't return these without the tag."
she proclaimed indignantly, as if she had
really caught me, reallv called "You're it!"

in a game of tag. So 1 was"it."
I fought with her and the manager long
enough to hear a "We'll do it this time, but
in the future ..." as if every time 1 come into
Macy's in the future, the two of them will be
standing guard making sure I carry out my
part of the bargain.
My turn to be "it." Something had made
this woman angry enough to direct her rage
to an unassuming customer, and now it was
my turn to be pissed. 1 walked next door to
the salon where two friends were getting
haircuts. The receptionist made the mistake
of asking if we "kids" were waiting for our
parents.
"Um, are you kidding?" I snapped.
"No."
"Well, NO." I countered. "We're waiting
for our friend." Yes, good comeback, Sasha!
"Do I really look that implausibly
beyond high school?" I asked my friend in a
very obvious loud voice. "Jeez, some peo
ple."
I am not unaware of the Shoppers'
Aggression phenomenon. Having worked in
retail in the illustrious world of The Gap, I
am used to seeing trivial fury manifest itself
on the shop-floor all too often. Yet in my
case, it always began with the customers
who felt they had some score to settle when
they came in to buy a turtleneck. Either that
or they would assume entitlement to Henri
Bendel-style service in a world of relaxed fit,
low-rise jeans and khakis.
"Bring me all the black pants you have in
a 12. I'll be in the dressing room." At your
service, 1 would salute.
"Why do you have so many kinds of
jeans? It's really confusing!" Yeah, reallv. I
did this personally just to make your shop
ping experience a challenge.

"Dammit! Why arc all the medium-sized
jackets too big for my husband? He usually
wears a large." Oh, yes, it's my fault that he's
a skinny wuss.
"What do you mean you don't have this
in an eight? Can't you check in the back?"
The much-acclaimed "back" that in reality
only housed our staff bathroom and a really
old computer No, no more eights in the
back.
Through the property of transitivity, their
aggression made me silently or often pas
sively aggressive, and just maybe I passed
that on to the next crowd I encountered
after work hours. This phenomenon is übiq
uitous, a vicious cycle with no apparent con
clusion. I see people every day who I specu
late must have had a dose of this aggression
bug.
Take, for example, the man at the post
office who needs no more description. The
woman at the library who can't help you
without your I.D. The disgruntled pedestri
ans and bikers when you're driving and the
belligerent drivers when you're walking or
biking. I'he American tourists in a Mexican
bar trying to order a drink. They've all
caught the virus, and they pass it on to us.
Let's admit, kicking ass feels good. Even
fantasizing about it. So go out there and kick
some ass today — choose your battles and
light them well. And I will do my part when
it comes around to me again, when my time
returns to be "it."
