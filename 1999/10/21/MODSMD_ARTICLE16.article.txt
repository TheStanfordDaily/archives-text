# Reality in small doses
## Miriam Ali A 						few thoughts on needing to overcome cynicism 
### 
I will never forget an incident thai
occurred a few years ago when my family
and I were visiting the Valley of Kings in
Egypt. It was a glaringly hot day, and we
were meandering aimlessly through the
Pharaohs' tombs when the children attacked
us.
1 here were U) of them, dark from the sun
and painfully skinny. "Give us money," they
wailed in Arabic. "Please, uncle." they
beseeched my father, "give us money."
I was terrified by the commotion and hid
behind my dad's back as he dispensed Egyp
tian pounds to the children. They clawed for
the money, literally fighting each other off.
Clutching the bills in their hands, the children
disappeared as quickly as they came. Except
for one girl about my age who lingered
behind long enough to shoot me a stare of
pure hatred before running after the others.
Those children were my first real glimpse

of poverty, and they opened my eyes to an
alternate universe. The irony is that their
reality is shared by 80 percent of the world
population. It was me who was the anomaly,
not them.
I came to Stanford thinking that I would
find crusaders against global problems like
poverty. Although I have found a few people
who really care about constructive change,
for the most part I have found cynics.
I think about that little girl in Egypt,
standing immobile as Hies crawl over her
face, staring at me with desperation flashing
from her eyes, and 1 wonder: what happened
to idealism?
II we, bright college kids, do not care
enough about such horrifying problems like
global poverty lo discuss it over ice cream,
who ever will?
Admittedly, the problem of global pover
ty is overwhelming. I understand that hear

ing about 1.3 billion people who live without
nutritious food, clean water and basic ser
vices can be hard to relate to. I understand
why it is easier to ignore the issue or decide
that poverty is too large of a problem to deal
with.
I understand cynicism, but at the same
time 1 think that we employ it as a convenient
excuse to absolve ourselves of social respon
sibility.
Even if only 1 percent of 1 percent of the
world's poor could be rescued from the mis
ery of starvation, we would measure success
in human lives. As college students, we may
not be able to change the face of poverty, but
we can make small dents.
1 fundamentally believe that humans are
not expendable, and it does not make sense
to decline to help one just because there are
thousands of others with the same problem.
Another factor that many of us overlook

is that the solutions to poverty are not always
complicated. For example, dysentery kills
hundreds of thousands of children annually,
but with healthy food, clean water and three
days of tablets it would pass as a minor child
hood illness.
Although none of us would want our child
to die of what is essentially a bad case of diar
rhea, we are willing to let it happen to other
people's children. Worse still, we shrug it off
as an inevitable part of life.
Yet when 1 consider the resources that
can be mustered so quickly for a bombing
effort, a bottle of vodka or the premier week
end of the Phantom Menace, I wonder
whether poverty really is undefeatable.
Maybe all we need is some effort.
The United Nations estimated that our
generation is the first that has the means to
eliminate poverty. Are we going to be the
first generation that chooses not to do so?

We need an attitude shift. No one is ask
ing us to give up lucrative consulting jobs to
work among the lepers, hut each of us can
help end this global scourge in small ways.
We need to remember that even if our
contribution is tiny, it may be vital to some
nameless person in some country we proba
bly don't even recognize.
We need to believe that in this age of
technological breakthroughs and widespread
social change, we can eliminate an ancient
problem.
Cynicism may be as fashionable as diet
Snapple, but action based on hope is a lot
more refreshing.
