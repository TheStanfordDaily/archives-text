# Tibet series initiated for rights awareness
## 
### Margaux Hall 
The Stanford Friends of Tibet
launched a bi-weekly speaker series
yesterday to promote awareness of
the Tibetan human rights move
ment.
Last night's discussion featured
Fred Shcpardson, a former Stanford
business professor who worked in a
Tibetan refugee settlement in the
197()5. and his wife Julie Shcpardson,
who conducted a health survey of
the settlement.
As the two worked toward enact
ing medical, economic and political
reforms in the Tashi Ling settle
ment, they said they also formed a
strong attachment to the spirituality
of the Tibetans.
"They don't think of punishment
in Western terms; they try to heal for
reincarnation," Fred Shcpardson
said.
Stanford Friends of Tibet's pro
grams, which will take place period
ically throughout the year, will aim
to inform students of political, social
and economic issues within Tibet,
according to Stanford Law student
Peter Suen, a member of the group
who organized the series.
Suen added that Stanford stu
dents' vocal support for the Tibetan
resistance against the People's Re
public of China has waned in the
past couple of years, as many in
volved upperclassmen have gradu
ated.
" The goal is to get the campus
and community at large to realize
what's going on," Suen said.
He added that the new students
on campus have demonstrated an in
terest in learning more about 'Tibet,
but they need additional informa

lion about the issues.
To inelude these students in the
programs, Suen said he intends to
plan the series as interactive discus
sions rather than lectures.
With speakers such as Ten/in
Telthong, a former government
leader of Tibet, scheduled to address
the students, Suen said he has tried
to include a variety of speakers.
"They show the students a kind of
view that w hat you do in our organi
zation can really help," he added.
Fred Shepardson said the lag in
Stanford support for the Tibetan

movement parallels an international
slowing of support.
I le added that the movement ne
cessitates student participation in
order to be successful.
"When the students grab |a polit
ical movement j, they can make it go
somewhere," he said. "They have a
huge voice. We listen to them."
Students who attended last
night's discussion agreed that groups
such as Stanford Friends of Tibet
and other grassroots organizations
can have a positive influence on po
litical movements.

"Groups like this raise aware
ness, and people can he aware of po
litical struggle," said I lolly Telerant.
a law student. "With concerts ... the
movement now has a lot of power it
never had before."
Suen said Stanford 112 riends of
libel hopes to promote such aware
ness and generate support for Tibet
by hosting other events on campus,
including a spring concert series.
"Historically, (Stanford] and
Berkeley were a large center for the
movement." Suen said. "We want to
rebuild a base before spring."
