# The
						Stanford Fund revises program
## Groups to work fewer hours for lower wages 
### Amit Garg 
Student groups arc concerned
about changes to Ilie Stanford Fund
Student Group Partnership that cut
their earnings, but applaud the
greater flexibility in working hours
allowed by the new rules.
All work is now given to group
leaders, who are responsible for
scheduling and completing the tasks
by a deadline. The wage has been
fixed at a rate of $25 per hour per stu
dent.
"My group members are much
happier writing thank-you letters on
their own time at a location of their
choosing." said senior John Reuter,
chairman of the Viennese Ball,
"rather than during a scheduled two
and-a-half hour shift in the basement
of Encina 1 lall."
But Reuter added, "I wish they
had retained the bonus system. Last
year, student groups were paid a min
imum of $20 per hour for writing
thank-you letters this year, the
lack of bonus means that potential in
come has been cut by 17 percent."
Previously, work hours were
scheduled in two-hour shifts at $20
per hour per student, which could be
increased to $30 per hour depending

on efficiency.
Chris Ponce, director ofThe Stan
ford Fund, said the changes are high
ly beneficial.
"(The earlier process] was compli
cated. Student groups would come in
at night, or not at all, and the work
would not get done. I think the work
is now easier, he said.
However, junior Miranda Ip, a co
ordinator for the Alternative Spring
Break program, expressed concern
that the changes could put a serious
dent in her program's funding.
"We aren't going to be able to rely
on The Stanford Fund as much as we
have in the past," Ip said. "The cur
rent changes mean that ASB is going
to look into alternative methods for
fundraising."
"As of now, we can't say what ex
actly is going to happen," she added.
Reuter said that the changes will
mean higher-priced tickets for the
Viennese Ball.
Ponce defended the new system.
"1 think [University President
Gerhard] Casper is being very wise in
allowing these alterations," he said.
"It gives students flexibility, while
showing them they need to work and
honor the alumni. [Alumni] are, after
all, what keep Stanford alive."
