### Kristin Rose 
Fatoumata Batta, World Neigh
bors Representative from West
Africa, gave a presentation last
night on a grass-roots development
program that she has helped to im
plement in poor rural areas of her
native nation of Burkina Faso.
Batta's presentation at Bechtel
International Center was titled
"Building Community Capacity and
Links to Civil Society."
The World Neighbors Organiza
tion is a non-profit charity group
that believes in promoting self-suffi
ciency in developing countries
rather than a dependence on tempo
rary aid. Batta said the group is ad
dressing the root causes of hunger,
disease and poverty in Burkina
Faso.
Burkina Faso is the fifth-poorest
country in the world and has an illit
eracy rate of over 95 percent.
According to Jethro Pettit,
World Neighbors' director of inter
national programs, "World Neigh
bors is based upon the idea of the in
herent dignity of all people. It is
about the development of human
potential through the strengthening
of civil societies and people-to-peo
ple association."
Batta explained that this is
achieved through "training, capaci
ty building, community organiza

tion and strengthening of local lead
ers."
Batta worked with Burkinabe
villagers to identify their most press
ing problems and set a community
agenda.
Batta helps the community cre
ate and develop programs that are
maintained by the villagers them
selves.
By promoting self-reliance,
Batta and World Neighbors facili
tate programs that integrate and im
prove food production, agriculture,
family planning, health, sanitation
and income generation.
"World Neighbors is unique. It is
a non-denominational develop
ment organization, not a relief orga
nization," said Stanford Law School
graduate Dan 1 loffman, a four-year
World Neighbors volunteer.
Hoffman said he has found the
process of constructing a plan and
implementing evolutionary changes
with villagers in West and East
African communities very reward
ing.
World Neighbors, formed in
1951, is currently active in 18 coun
tries worldwide.
Pettit said World Neighbors'
goal for Burkina Faso and all spon
sored program nations is "long-last
ing improvements that will change
people's lives: not quick fixes that do
not last."
