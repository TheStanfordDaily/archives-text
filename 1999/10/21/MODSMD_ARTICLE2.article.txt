A 42-year-old female University employee was attacked
at knifepoint by a man while hiking in the Stanford foothills
Sunday afternoon. The suspect has not yet been appre
hended and police are urging people in the area to take pre
cautions.
The attack occurred around 4:30 p.m. near the Dish, west
of the intersection of Stanford Avenue and Junipero Serra
Boulevard. The suspect allegedly grabbed the victim from
behind and tried to pull her down.
In an interview with the San Jose Mercury News, Stan
ford Police l.t. Del Bandy said that the woman managed to
break free and get back to her car, suffering only minor cuts
on her neck
Stanford Sgt. Rick Tipton described this kind of event as
"very infrequent." According to Bandy, the only report of a
serious attack in the area was a series of rapes a decade ago.
The alleged suspect of those crimes. Robert Christy, killed
himself in 1 W() while attempting to escape from police.
Despite the relatively low rate of crime in the area, many
students were stunned by the attack.
"Just two days ago, 1 went up to the Dish with some
friends," said freshman Helen Hwang. "The thought that
someone could have threatened us with a weapon makes me
really scared."
Junior Wallace Adelman. a Women's Center coordina
tor. said she felt uneasy about the occurrence. She said it was
a frightening echo of the attack on Roble Field last year,
where a woman was forced to give up her undergarments.
"It was a total shock. I've heard of people in uncomfort
able situations at the Dish, but I've never heard of an actual
attack," Adelman said. "It's a reminder that... women still
need to take precautions."
The Stanford community is taking steps to help prevent
such incidents from occurring in the future.
The Graduate Women's Network plans to host a self-de
fense course next month, while the Women's Center hopes
to offer more self-defense classes and a program to pair
women up for night running, according to Adelman.
"We had a [running! program last year and it seems like
there will be a high demand for this program again now,"
Adelman said.
Stanford Police have posted warnings around the
foothills, cautioning hikers and joggers to be on the lookout.
"It's a remote area and we tell people that if they are
going in there to walk or jog. they should go with a friend,"
Bandy told the Mercury News.
According to Tipton, more patrols are being dispatched

to ensure maximum safety, he said he
believes that people should also take
their own preventive actions.
"Look up 011 the path to see
what's ahead; il it looks suspicious,
lake another route." Tipton said.
"That's |ust a basic safety precau
tion."
However, some students ex
pressed disappointment that they

even have to he afraid at all.
"it is unfortunate that women
have to feel unsafe even in broad
daylight," said junior Sayra Khan
dekar. "I think that its unfair that
without the Dish being policed,
women will still feel unsafe."
