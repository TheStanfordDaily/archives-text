# Mambo for the next millennium
## Friends of Dance plan for the future 
### Sarah Mearon 
As Stanford waltzes its way into a
new millennium, it can rest assured
knowing that the future of dance
here is swingin' in good hands.
The Friends of Dance at Stanford,
a volunteer organization committed
to the vitality of dance on campus,
held its annual meeting last night at
the Roble Dance Studio lounge.
The meeting was an open discus
sion on where dance might be head
ed in the next century.
"Since this is the last gasp of this
century. I thought it would be inter
esting to look at the 'century effect,'
said Richard Powers, Dance Divi
sion liaison for the group.
The "century effect" is a term
Powers uses to describe a change in
the landscape of dance that occurs
every IOC) years.
"We're not talking about a swing
revolution or the Macarena. We're
talking about a new paradigm for the
next century," he said.
Powers said that the change in
dance that occurs every century is
closely linked to popular culture. "A
new culture tends to be defined by
the young people," he said. "It in
volves changes in fashion, sports,

music, values and new gender roles."
Much of the discussion at last
night's meeting involved the link be
tween technology and movement, as
well as the role of electronica music
and the rave scene in shaping the di
rection of mainstream culture.
According to Powers, only over
the last six years has dance become
an integral part of the social culture
at Stanford. Powers estimated that
he has had over 1,1(H) people, mostly
Stanford students, in his dance class
es during each of the last three quar
ters.
"(Dance is] a balance against the
left brain, which is verbal, analytical,
intellectual and is the focus that most
people that get into Stanford have
experienced. They haven't really got
ten into the right brain," Powers said.
"Dance is not a new-age theory. It
involves connecting to other peo
ple," he said.
Luke Nosek, a vice president of
marketing at an Internet startup in
Palo Alto who has attended dance
classes at Stanford, agreed.
"I think it's the most basic form of
communication. It's two people
being in sync, being on the same
level. If communication is done right,
it's a dance," he said.
