## Women's tennis holds court Squad looks for a repeat of 1998 NCAA championship season 
### Bill Hanson Staff writer 
After last year's thrilling vietor\
over rival Florida at the NCAA
Team Championships, it seems as i!
the Stanford women's tennis team
is destined for a letdown. I low can
the Cardinal women possiblv repli
cate such a successful season?
Every starter from last year's
championship squad, however, is
back for another season. Moreover,
the Cardinal now boasts a preco
cious newcomer: freshman Laura
Granville, two-time national junior
champion.
Currently, the sole Concern fac
ing the squad is how to select six
starters from a pool of eight com
petitive and talented women.
"It'll be hard because we have
our six starters from last year and
we have Granville who is so good."

there's [junior] Sarah Pestieau, who
always steps up to the plate when
she's needed."
Head coach Frank Brennan.
however, relishes the team's depth.
"I never worrv about that stuff,"

ho said. "I'm sure we'll have one in
jury or another and everyone will
get to play."
Brennan is far more worried that
the team's veterans will relax after
last year's performance and bask in
their triumph.
"We had a championship sea
son. and we have everybody back."
lie said. "Once those freshmen
grew up last year, that was it. they
had a great year. Hut I don't want
them to be too cocky heading into
this season."
"I hope last year's freshmen
don't think it's too easy to have an
incredible season like that." Ashley
said. "Everyone's going to be gun
ning for us this year."
Ashley will lead the team in its
efforts to capture another champi
onship this season. After a persis
tent wrist in jury kept her out of sev
eral matches at the end of last sea
son, Ashley is back with a
vengeance.
"It's frustrating because 1 was
playing so well last year." she said.
"I did well in every tournament, but
then 1 had to miss the NCAA Indi
viduals. which I had been building

toward. But this summer, I've taken
three months off and I hope the ten
dinitis is going away. I'm back, and
I'm re-energized."
Ashley heads into the preseason
ranked sixth in the nation hv the In
tercollegiate Tennis Association.
She hopes to conclude her college
career with an individual title, but
she knows her injury is a continuing
concern.
Sophomore Marissa Irvin en
joyed a tremendous college debut
last season, reaching the NCAA fi
nals before falling to the nation's
top-ranked player in three sets.
Irvin heads into the season as the
nation's second-ranked player, one
spot below University of San Diego
star Zuzana Lesenarova.
This summer. Irvin competed in
several satellite tournaments, gar
nering a winning record and attain
ing a professional world ranking of
171. Irvin's ranking is especially im
pressive considering she has played
in only 10 professional tourna
ments. Most of the players on the
professional tour have competed

year-round, playing in over 20 tour
naments. They have thus had many
more opportunities to amass
points.
Irvin will continue to pursue her
professional ambitions during the
year, skipping some of the less com
petitive dual matches in order to play
professional tournaments. Nonethe
less, she hopes to further both her
personal goals and her team's goals
by competing in the most crucial
matches. Irvin remains an enthusias
tic member of the varsity squad.
Some worry, however, that she
is spreading herself too thin.
"It's kind of tough when one
person isn't there all the time,"
Ashley said. "It's hard because
she's trying to do so much."
The rest of last year's freshmen,
Gabriela Lastra, Lauren Kalvaria
and Keiko Tokuda, will be devot
ing all of their energies to the team.
Last season, all three's results were
erratic as they made the transition
from junior tennis to collegiate
competition. Now, however, they
possess the maturity required to
consistently challenge the nation's
top players.
"They have a lot of confidence,"
Brennan said. "Gabby's a different
person, Lauren's a different per
son, Keiko's a different person."

Rounding out the team are se
nior Jennifer Heiser, junior Sarah
Pestieau and Granville.
Granville, who ousted the
world's top-ranked junior, Virginie
Razzano, in reaching the quarterli
nalsof the 1999 junior U.S. Open, is
already mature enough to worry
the nation's elite. Granville, a
counter-puncher who roves the
baseline, wears down her oppo
nents with her consistency.
"Her game is not flashy, her per
sonality is not tlashy, but she's so
mature and focused, Brennan
said. "She's a solid competitor. She
bears down and has that little extra
edge. When it's a tight match, the
other girl knows that Laura has
played in the U.S. Open, Laura has
won two national championship ti
tles — she's Laura Granville, and
her opponents know that."
As usual, the team will be
coached by Brennan and assistant
coach Lele Forood.
"They're both excellent." Ash
ley said. "Lele does a lot ot techni
cal work with our games and a lot of
behind-the-scenes work. She's so
knowledgeable; if we need a fourth
for doubles, she comes on the court
and usually beats us. Coach Bren
nan really helps us with the mental
side."
This week, the team is in Pacific
Palisades, Calif., for the 1999 Riv
iera All-American Championships,
an individual tournament.
