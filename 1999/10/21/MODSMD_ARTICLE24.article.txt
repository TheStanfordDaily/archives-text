# Senior Smith a big hit in the secondary
## Veteran safety has recovered from knee injury to energize defensive backfield 
### Tim Kane Contributing writer 
There's a reason opposing wide receivers
dread running routes through the middle of
Stanford's secondary every Saturday.
That reason's name is Tim Smith.
Combining brute strength with agility and
quickness, Smith, a fifth-year senior who is one
of the best safeties in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. is the heart and soul of the Cardinal sec
ondary.
Not many people would have guessed
Smith would be in that position five years ago,
when he was one of the top quarterbacks in
California. While at Coalinga High School,
Smith played on both sides of the ball, stepping
in as a safety on defense. But quarterback is
where he made his name at the small Central
Valley high school.
Stanford eventually recruited him, but not
for football — if things had turned out the way
the Stanford basketball staff had planned, you
might have seen Tim Smith running the floor
with Art Lee and Mark Madsen during March
Madness.
"It was really funny. I was getting recruited
to play basketball here, and while I was visit
ing, the football coaches came and watched a
game and asked for a film." Smith said. "1
wasn't getting a lot of attention, and all of a
sudden I just started getting ridiculous letters
for football. I always thought I was going to
play basketball somewhere."
Once he decided to play football. Smith
briefly considered IJCLA, Washington and

Arizona before settling on the Farm. What
made the decision for him?
"The academics. It's world-renowned for
athletics as well, plus it's not too far from
home, but just far enough away," Smith said.
"Kind of hard to beat getting that Stanford ed
ucation."
Smith's parents were not unhappy with his
choice, which was made partly with family in
mind. The Smith clan has attended all of his
games — even the away ones — except for one
at Wisconsin. They also helped him get
through a period when he injured his knee in
1997.
Once arriving at Stanford, which is known
for its stellar quarterback tradition. Smith
found three other quarterbacks ahead of him
on the depth chart. This led him to redshirt his
freshman year while he reassessed his situa
tion.
"I didn't feel like 1 could beat those other
guys out, so I went to the coaches and said *1
just want to play.' They moved me to receiver
for a while, but two or three days before the
spring game they moved me to safety and I've
been there ever since." Smith said.
As a redshirt freshman in 1996, Smith
played in nickel defenses, typically coming in
on passing downs. During the time he was on
the field, he made enough of an impression to
be named the starter for the next season.
Tragedy struck in the second game of the
1997 season when Smith tore the anterior
cruicate ligament in his left knee, sidelining

him for the remainder of the season.
Alter a significant rehabilitation,
along with encouragement and sup
port from his family. Smith was able
lo fully recover, although he still
wears a brace on the knee.
"There were times I thought,
What il I never played again?'"
Smith said. "But I stayed positive
and my family and friends were pos
itive and helped me bounce back."
After a year of relative frustra
tion. IWN proved to be a monster

year for Smith. I le was a huge pres
ence in the secondary, often leveling
big hits on hapless receivers while
helping the front seven of the de
fense stuff the run. For the year, he
ended up leading the team with 109
tackles and led the Pac-10 with six in
terceptions, putting him fifth in the
nation.
Now that Smith is a fifth-year se
nior and one of the leaders on the
team, he is looking to impart some of
his wisdom into the new faces within
the Cardinal secondary.
"The thing that 1 try to do is play
as hard as I can, and so the freshmen
see that, and it uives them an idea of

what's expected," he said. "1 want
them to look at me and say 'I want to
play as hard as that guy did.'"
Based on this year so far, it would
appear that Smith is living up to his
end of the bargain. After a less-than
auspicious start against Texas, fol
lowed by a good performance versus
Washington State, he exploded
against Arizona, intercepting three
passes, making nine tackles and
recording a sack. Not surprisingly, he
was named Pac-10 Defensive Player
of the Week for the first time in his
career.
"The Arizona game was probably
the most fun game I think I've ever

played in,"he said. "It was just like
there was this glow around the team.
We were just very confident. There
was no thought of losing whatsoever,
even when it seemed like they were
coming back in the third quarter."
"He has helped the secondary im
mensely, and has emerged as a
leader in the backfield. ...He's an in
credible football player." Stanford
defensive coordinator Kent Baer
said.
After six games this season. Smith
leads the team with three intercep
tions and is third on the team in tack
les with 43, including three tackles
for loss and two sacks. While his ef

fort at Arizona was clearly the high
light of this year, Smith has definite
ly been the most solid and consistent
performer in the somewhat ma
ligned Cardinal secondary.
"[After the Texas game] we've
been alright against Pac-10 teams,"
Smith said. "If we're giving up the
yards and we're winning, then we're
getting the job done."
Smith knows this year is special.
"There's a different kind of cama
raderie between the players," Smith
said. "We just have to keep capitial
izing and winning, and maybe we'll
find ourselves in the Rose Bowl."
For all the intensity and mayhem

he brings to the field. Smith is sur
prisingly down-to-earth and laid
back off of it. He is finishing up a de
gree in history this year, and will be
the first person in his family to grad
uate from college.
As for plans after Stanford, "I just
want to get that degree, and then go
with the flow. If there's a chance to
go pro, I'll definitely take it. wherev
er the wind takes me. I've thought
about eventually coaching and
teaching people."
Maybe then the middle of the
field will be safe for opposing re
ceivers. In the meantime, Tim Smith
rules the field.

After six games this season. Smith
leads the team with three intercep
tions and is third on the team in tack
les with 43, including three tackles
for loss and two sacks. While his ef

fort at Arizona was clearly the high
light of this year, Smith has definite
ly been the most solid and consistent
performer in the somewhat ma
ligned Cardinal secondary.
"[After the Texas game] we've
been alright against Pac-10 teams,"
Smith said. "If we're giving up the
yards and we're winning, then we're
getting the job done."
Smith knows this year is special.
"There's a different kind of cama
raderie between the players," Smith
said. "We just have to keep capitial
izing and winning, and maybe we'll
find ourselves in the Rose Bowl."
For all the intensity and mayhem

he brings to the field. Smith is sur
prisingly down-to-earth and laid
back off of it. He is finishing up a de
gree in history this year, and will be
the first person in his family to grad
uate from college.
As for plans after Stanford, "I just
want to get that degree, and then go
with the flow. If there's a chance to
go pro, I'll definitely take it. wherev

about eventually coaching and
teaching people."
Maybe then the middle of the
field will be safe for opposing re
ceivers. In the meantime, Tim Smith
rules the field.
There's a reason opposing wide receivers
dread running routes through the middle of
Stanford's secondary every Saturday.
That reason's name is Tim Smith.
Combining brute strength with agility and
quickness, Smith, a fifth-year senior who is one
of the best safeties in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. is the heart and soul of the Cardinal sec
ondary.
Not many people would have guessed
Smith would be in that position five years ago,
when he was one of the top quarterbacks in
California. While at Coalinga High School,
Smith played on both sides of the ball, stepping
in as a safety on defense. But quarterback is
where he made his name at the small Central
Valley high school.
Stanford eventually recruited him, but not
for football — if things had turned out the way
the Stanford basketball staff had planned, you
might have seen Tim Smith running the floor
with Art Lee and Mark Madsen during March
Madness.
"It was really funny. I was getting recruited
to play basketball here, and while I was visit
ing, the football coaches came and watched a
game and asked for a film." Smith said. "1
wasn't getting a lot of attention, and all of a
sudden I just started getting ridiculous letters
for football. I always thought I was going to
play basketball somewhere."
Once he decided to play football. Smith
briefly considered IJCLA, Washington and

Arizona before settling on the Farm. What
made the decision for him?
"The academics. It's world-renowned for
athletics as well, plus it's not too far from
home, but just far enough away," Smith said.
"Kind of hard to beat getting that Stanford ed
ucation."
Smith's parents were not unhappy with his
choice, which was made partly with family in
mind. The Smith clan has attended all of his
games — even the away ones — except for one
at Wisconsin. They also helped him get
through a period when he injured his knee in
1997.
Once arriving at Stanford, which is known
for its stellar quarterback tradition. Smith
found three other quarterbacks ahead of him
on the depth chart. This led him to redshirt his
freshman year while he reassessed his situa
tion.
"I didn't feel like 1 could beat those other
guys out, so I went to the coaches and said *1
just want to play.' They moved me to receiver
for a while, but two or three days before the
spring game they moved me to safety and I've
been there ever since." Smith said.
As a redshirt freshman in 1996, Smith
played in nickel defenses, typically coming in
on passing downs. During the time he was on
the field, he made enough of an impression to
be named the starter for the next season.
Tragedy struck in the second game of the
1997 season when Smith tore the anterior
cruicate ligament in his left knee, sidelining

him for the remainder of the season.
Alter a significant rehabilitation,
along with encouragement and sup
port from his family. Smith was able
lo fully recover, although he still
wears a brace on the knee.
"There were times I thought,
What il I never played again?'"
Smith said. "But I stayed positive
and my family and friends were pos
itive and helped me bounce back."
After a year of relative frustra
tion. IWN proved to be a monster

year for Smith. I le was a huge pres
ence in the secondary, often leveling
big hits on hapless receivers while
helping the front seven of the de
fense stuff the run. For the year, he
ended up leading the team with 109
tackles and led the Pac-10 with six in
terceptions, putting him fifth in the
nation.
Now that Smith is a fifth-year se
nior and one of the leaders on the
team, he is looking to impart some of
his wisdom into the new faces within
the Cardinal secondary.
"The thing that 1 try to do is play
as hard as I can, and so the freshmen
see that, and it uives them an idea of

what's expected," he said. "1 want
them to look at me and say 'I want to
play as hard as that guy did.'"
Based on this year so far, it would
appear that Smith is living up to his
end of the bargain. After a less-than
auspicious start against Texas, fol
lowed by a good performance versus
Washington State, he exploded
against Arizona, intercepting three
passes, making nine tackles and
recording a sack. Not surprisingly, he
was named Pac-10 Defensive Player
of the Week for the first time in his
career.
"The Arizona game was probably
the most fun game I think I've ever

played in,"he said. "It was just like
there was this glow around the team.
We were just very confident. There
was no thought of losing whatsoever,
even when it seemed like they were
coming back in the third quarter."
"He has helped the secondary im
mensely, and has emerged as a
leader in the backfield. ...He's an in
credible football player." Stanford
