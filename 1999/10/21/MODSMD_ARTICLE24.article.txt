# Senior Smith a big hit in the secondary
## Veteran safety has recovered from knee injury to energize defensive backfield 
### Tim Kane Contributing writer 
There's a reason opposing wide receivers
dread running routes through the middle of
Stanford's secondary every Saturday.
That reason's name is Tim Smith.
Combining brute strength with agility and
quickness, Smith, a fifth-year senior who is one
of the best safeties in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. is the heart and soul of the Cardinal sec
ondary.
Not many people would have guessed
Smith would be in that position five years ago,
when he was one of the top quarterbacks in
California. While at Coalinga High School,
Smith played on both sides of the ball, stepping
in as a safety on defense. But quarterback is
where he made his name at the small Central
Valley high school.
Stanford eventually recruited him, but not
for football — if things had turned out the way
the Stanford basketball staff had planned, you
might have seen Tim Smith running the floor
with Art Lee and Mark Madsen during March
Madness.
"It was really funny. I was getting recruited
to play basketball here, and while I was visit
ing, the football coaches came and watched a
game and asked for a film." Smith said. "1
wasn't getting a lot of attention, and all of a
sudden I just started getting ridiculous letters
for football. I always thought I was going to
play basketball somewhere."
Once he decided to play football. Smith
briefly considered IJCLA, Washington and

Arizona before settling on the Farm. What
made the decision for him?
"The academics. It's world-renowned for
athletics as well, plus it's not too far from
home, but just far enough away," Smith said.
"Kind of hard to beat getting that Stanford ed
ucation."
Smith's parents were not unhappy with his
choice, which was made partly with family in
mind. The Smith clan has attended all of his
games — even the away ones — except for one
at Wisconsin. They also helped him get
through a period when he injured his knee in
1997.
Once arriving at Stanford, which is known
for its stellar quarterback tradition. Smith
found three other quarterbacks ahead of him
on the depth chart. This led him to redshirt his
freshman year while he reassessed his situa
tion.
"I didn't feel like 1 could beat those other
guys out, so I went to the coaches and said *1
just want to play.' They moved me to receiver
for a while, but two or three days before the
spring game they moved me to safety and I've
been there ever since." Smith said.
As a redshirt freshman in 1996, Smith
played in nickel defenses, typically coming in
on passing downs. During the time he was on
the field, he made enough of an impression to
be named the starter for the next season.
Tragedy struck in the second game of the
1997 season when Smith tore the anterior
cruicate ligament in his left knee, sidelining
