# Crew kicks off regatta season
## Stanford's women rowers look to contend with Eastern teams 
### Sarah Heim 
Fall training is in full force lor
Stanford women's crew.
Although the competitive sea
son does not begin until the spring,
this year's team is already working
hard.
"In this sport, you train for
seven months for six individual six
and-a-half minute races in the
spring," women's head coach
Aimee Baker said.
In preparation, the team prac
tices six days a week, rowing two
mornings on the water and spend
ing the remaining days indoors
training on rowing machines and
running stairs.
Both Baker and assistant coach
Kristine Franson stressed the im
portance of working together as a
team this fall.
"With young crews you look to
surprise people." Baker said.
"We're not going to the big races
this fall. We're going to stay at
home and train so we can do some
thing big in the spring."

As a learn, Ihe women's crew
decided not to row at the Head of
the Charles regatta this fall. How
ever. the team will row against
crews that raced at the prestigious
Boston race at the Head of the
American in Sacramento in late
()ctohcr.
Competing against these teams
will be a good gauge for where the
Stanford team stands, Baker said.
The women's team will also
compete in two other regattas this
fall. Early races give coaches the
opportunity to test out new combi
nations of rowers and help coaches
determine the fastest squads for
the spring.
Fall events also serve as an early
indicator of/iow well training is
going.
This year's 20-member team
consists mainly of freshman and
sophomores. After graduating 11
seniors last year, the team is now
focusing on goals for the future.
Ihe Athletic Department is
helping to fulfill these goals. Re
centlv. there has been an increase

in support for the women's team.
Part of the support includes a
step up in recruiting, which has
helped attract junior world team
athletes to Stanford's program.
They arc also in the process of
rebuilding the 30-year-old
boathouse at Port of Redwood
City, where the team practices. The
$4.5-million project should be com
pleted next fall.
"The Athletic Department is
truly supporting us and helping us
reach our goal of being one of the
top crews in the country," Baker
said.
It's not just the Stanford
women's crew that has seen an in
crease in aid.
Over the past decade, women's
crew has really taken off. Baker
said. Due to gender equity con
cerns, there has been a nationwide
increase in support for women's
collegiate sports.
However, according to Baker,
"this also means the competition
has become steeper because more
schools have more money to put
into training and recruiting."
Last year, Stanford women's
crew finished sixth in the Pac-10.
This year, they aim to place in the
top four, which would secure them
a bid at the NCAA Champi
onships in Camden, N.J., this
spring.
"I 'm really excited to work with
the team this year. And, I'm excit
ed to win." Baker said.
Stanford travels to the Head of
the American in Sacramento on
Oct. 30 and to the Head of the
Lake in Seattle on Nov. 14. The
crew also hosts the Stanford Fall
Regatta on Sunday, Nov. 21.
