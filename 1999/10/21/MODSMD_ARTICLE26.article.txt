time in the tournament's 21-year history that both the
singles and doubles champions came from the same
school.
The tournament is the second leg of the IT As four
grand slam events, and as the team's first major tourna
ment, it can be seen as a preview of the 1999-2(XX) season.
"This is a pretty major tournament for us," assistant
coach John Whitlinger said. "At this point we just want
to see where the players are. where we have to go. and
what we have to work on."
Even though the most important aspect of the tour
nament was in assessing the progress and development of
the team, coaches admitted that a good performance was
an added plus.
"It's definitely a nice confidence-builder to play a
tournament of that caliber and come out on top,"
Whitlinger said. "We wanted to go in and play hard, but
doing well is definitely icing on the cake."
Hippensteel swept through the 64-player main draw
to become the fifth Cardinal ever — the fourth this
decade — to win the title. Hippensteel. who dominated
throughout the competition, upset four seeded players,
posted six victories over opponents in the top 40 and did
not lose a set the entire tournament.
Hippensteel, who was unseeded in the tournament,
got a much-desired win in a critical first-round matchup
against the No. 7 seed, Justin O'Neal of Florida. He won

The third-seeded doubles team of
Abrams and Kim also dominated
throughout the tournament, losing
only one set in the 32-team competi

The pair became only the second
Cardinal duo to win the doubles title,
joining Jared Palmer and Jonathan
Stark, who won the title in 1990.
The second Cardinal doubles

team, Hippensteel and Freshman
David Martin, suffered a close loss in
the quarterfinals but ultimately did
not serve well enough win.
Abrams was upset in the first
round of singles competition in a dis
heartening match against Eduardo
Gordilho. His 6-4, 6-3 loss was his
third early defeat in the tournament
in as many years.
However, Abrams overcame the
early loss and ended up winning the
consolation title without giving up a
single set.
