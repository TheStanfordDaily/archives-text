# Kiwi stars for Cardinal soccer
## Transfer Nelsen brings experience, skill to squad 
### Meghan O'Connor Staff writer 
Before joining the Cardinal, most of the players on
the Stanford men's soccer team were battling rival high
schools and representing their respective states on state
or club teams.
But junior Ryan Nelsen was playing against such
soccer powerhouses as Brazil and Germany, represent
ing New Zealand on various Kiwi national teams.
As the majority of the Cardinal squad was marking
boys their own age on the field, Nelsen was pitted
against grown men with years of international experi
ence behind them. And as his Stanford peers typically
played for friends and family, Nelsen performed in
front of thousands of fans and appeared on televisions
worldwide.
Nelsen, a first-year transfer from Greensboro Col
lege. brings a whole new meaning of the word "experi
ence" to the Stanford men's soccer team.
"He's got the most playing experience on the team,"
Stanford head coach Bobby Clark said. "After playing
in front of 6().(KK) fans against Brazil, there's no way
you're ever going to be intimidated. He brings that

Junior Ryan Nelsen — a transfer from Greens
boro College — is the only member of the men's
soccer team to have played against Brazil, Ger
many and the United States.
strength to the team."
Clark is referring to the climax of
Nelsen's long list of soccer achieve
ments. This past July, Nelsen joined
the New Zealand Senior National
Team at the Confederation Cup in
Guadalajara, Mexico, where the
team played Brazil, Germany and
the United States.
"In Mexico, soccer is the No. 1
sport, so wherever we went, people
were following us," Nelsen said. "We
were mobbed by people wanting au
tographs. or just wanting to shake
our hands. It was a pretty awesome
experience being thrust up there
from the laid-back New Zealand
lifestyle."
Nelsen. the nephew of four New
Zealand national team players and
grandson of the National Team
Manager in the '60s. seemed des
tined to reach such a high level of
soccer. His step up this summer as
one of the youngest players on the
Senior National Team completes
Nelsen's climb to the top of New
Zealand soccer. Unlike in America,
promising New Zealand soccer play
ers focus on club play rather than
high school or collegiate competi
tion. At age 15. Nelsen joined the
club circuit, which placed him among
men twice his age.
"It's the best way to learn because
all the players are so experienced."
Nelsen said of his club play. "Being
in this experienced environment is
the biggest advantage I have over
American players who mostly just
play within their own age group."
At age 19. Nelsen began playing
for New Zealand's under-20 nation
al squad with fellow Cardinal and se
nior co-captain Gerard Davis.
"Ryan and I grew up playing
against each other and every time it
was a competitive game." Davis said.
"Since then I've always known him
as a really tough competitor. That's
definitely been one of the biggest as
sets he's brought to the [Stanford]
team this year."
Both Nelsen and Davis are now

on the under-23 National Team and
hope to qualify for the Olympics this
December. {
With such ap impressive resume,
including being honored as the
Royal Sun and Alliance Young Play
er of the Year in New Zealand soc
cer, Nelsen turned down offers to
play professionally lor England,
France and Belgium in favor of play
ing for the Cardinal. Nelsen becomes
the second N6w Zealand Young
Player of the Year recipient to play
at Stanford, following last season's
captain, Simon Elliott.
As coach of the New Zealand
under-20 national team, ( lark tirst
met Nelsen in 1995 and it is Clark
who is responsible for getting Nelsen
interested in university soccer in
America.
"I noted him as the best player on
the squad and I liked his positive at
titude," Clark said. "His warm, out
going, strong personality together
with his ability as a soccer player
made him a spectacular player."
Before donning a Cardinal jersey,
however, Nelsen made a stop at
Greensboro College in North Car
olina. In two seasons, Nelsen collect
ed such honors as NSC A A Third
Team All-American, two-time First
Team All-Dixie Conference player,
Dixie Conference Rookie of the
Year, and team MVP. Last season he
led his team to the Division 111 Final
Four with a season tally of 12 goals
and eight assists, including the game
winner against Rowan at the Nation
al Semifinals. He was named to the
Final Four All-Tournament team.
Despite his success, Stanford's
reputation lured Nelsen out west.
"From what I knew of Stanford
and Bobby Clark, it was a no-brainer
that I would transfer if I could."
Nelsen said.
And now that he's here, the only
problem may be getting him to stay.
The 22-year-old who gave up profes
sional offers in favor of his education
and hopes of a degree in Political Sci
ence will be faced with another diffi
cult decision of whether or not to
tour China with the New Zealand
-trtjnior National Team this January.

vironment at Stanford allows you to
improve and enjoy soccer."
Despite the stigma that Ameri
cans can't measure up with the rest of
the world in soccer, Nelsen has en
joyed the quality of player that he has
encountered on the Cardinal squad.

"People don't realize how good
the players are here." Nelsen said.
"Skillfully and physically, you won't
get a better player, they just haven't
had enough experience."
Similarly, the Stanford men have
been impressed with Nelsen s level of
play, and his contributions to the
team so far have had an impact on the
Cardinal's impressive record (8-2-2.
3-0-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Feder

ation) that currently leads the Moun
tain Division of the MPSF.
"After losing Shan [Gawj and
Simon [Elliott], we were a bit con
cerned about how the midfield would
shape up. hut Ryan and Scott Leber
have developed into a very good mid
field pairing," Davis said. "[Nelsen]
doesn't have any weaknesses. He's
experienced and extremely competi
tive, which overall is a pretty tough

combination."
With Stanford, Nelsen has already
begun adding to his already extensive
list of soccer honors. At the Fresno
Tournament in early September,
Nelsen was named defensive player
of the tournament and included on
the All-Tournament team. Three
weeks later, Nelsen was named to the
All-Tournament team of the Stan
ford/Nike Tournament. So far this

season, the midfielder has con
tributed one goal and two assists to
the Cardinal effort, including the
game-winner over Bradley.
"In spite of his achievements, his
modesty and quiet demeanor are a
tremendous example to the rest of
the team," Clark said. "When a gifted
player can remain gifted and remain
a team player, it's a win-win situa
tion."
