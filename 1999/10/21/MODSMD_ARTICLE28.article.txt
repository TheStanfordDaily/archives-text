MEN S CREW

â–  Saturday-Sunday: Men's erew
competes ;it the I lead of the ( harles
Regatta in Boston.

This competition is the world's
largest two-day rowing event with
5.4(H) athletes from around the world
competing in l ( > different racing
events. I'he competitors include col
lege crew teams, national teams and
l uropcan crews.
"It's too early in the season to tell
how we're going to do." Stanford
men's head coach Wicslaw Kudja
said. *i or the [regatta] we just have a
lineup depending on how people per

form. because it's long distance.
We're trying to incorporate new guys
into the first boat. It'sa longhaul until
April and this is one out of many."
The Cardinal team is at a disad
vantage because it lacks training time
due to Stanford's quarter system. Ad
ditional obstacles include the lack of
a boat house and open boat racks.
Despite similar circumstances last
year, the team managed to finish
strong, taking 10th place at nationals.
"We definitely have a chance to
do even better this year than last
year." said Nate Matter, a coterminal
student in electrical engineering.
"We have a larger varsity team this
year. With more rowers to practice
with, we can put more boats out on
the water, making us more solid in
competition against other schools."
In addition to having a larger
team, there are many returning mem
bers.

"Our strength lies in our experi
ence," said senior co-captain Michael
English. "We have six rowers and a
coxswain returning from the national
boat. We know what to expect."
Currently, the team is training for
fall regattas, which are generally
longer than regattas in the spring. Fall
competitions are "Head" races, a
class of regattas that are 5,(X)() meters
in length, while regattas in the spring
are 2,(XX) meters long.
In preparing for the fall regattas,
the focus is on increasing strength.
"The difference between the
workouts last year and this year is
more emphasis on weight lifting."
Kujda said. "[The crew members] are
on a program specifically designed by
one of the trainers. We need to im
prove our strength because it's the
most important thing in the first part
of the race. That was the problem last
year. We're trying to work on that."

In addition to working on
strength, the team is trying to im
prove consistency throughout the
year.
"We peaked at the right time last
year," senior co-captain Bryan Hoff
man said. "I lowever. we'd like to get
some consistency rather than being
fast at one point, then slowing down
in the middle of the season. We'd like
to he fast all year."
kujda is using the Head of the
Charles regatta to evaluate the com
petition and see where the Stanford
crew team stands in relation to other
crews across the country.
"They look pretty good and have
good intensity," Kudja said. "I'll be
really happy if we end up in the top 10
overall in terms of crew teams and
maybe even break the ranks into the
top seventh or eighth place. The most
important thing is to see how close we
are to the No. 1 college crew team.
