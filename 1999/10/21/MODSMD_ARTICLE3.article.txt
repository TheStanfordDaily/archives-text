### Mills Schenck Contributing writer 
In their weekly meetingat Bech
tel International Center, the Grad
uate Student Council discussed
amendments to the I Jniversity con
stitution and housing concerns and
formalized an appointment to the
Nominations ('ommittee.
I he bulk of the meeting was
spent debating the wording of
amendments to the ASSU Consti
tution. which required the ap
proval of the council.
I lie amendments concerned
University President Gerhard
Casper's comments, which were

added to the original document
that split the ASSI! Senate into the
(ISC and the Undergraduate Sen
ate.
The amendments passed after
much debate. I hey are expected to
he ratified by the Undergraduate
Senate lor incorporation into the
ASSI I ( onstitution.
(iS(" chair and physics doctoral
student Kaleb Michaud said. "It is
nice to have this process complete;
now we need to get back to our job
representing graduate students."
I hc council also named gradu
ate students Lawrence Neeley (me
chanical engineering). Max
kamenctsky (electrical engineer

ing) and Use Sedrez (history) to
the Nominations Committee.
The Nominations Committee is
composed of a chair, three under
graduates and three graduate rep
resentatives. It selects Stanford
students to sit on University policy
making committees.
"NomCom is an important op
portunity for students to directly
impact the operation of the Uni
versity," said Electrical Engineer
ing master's student Paul Hartke.a
member of the CiSC, in an earlier
interview with the Daily.
The meeting also addressed
graduate student housing, an issue
which has become very important
to the council. Stanford, in the draft

of the new Land Use Plan, has allo
cated space which would be used to
build housing for an additional
l .9(H) graduate students.
The plan must gain approval
from the Palo Alto Planning Com
mission. however, if it is to become

a reality.
Many members of the (JSC will
be present at a Palo Alto city coun
cil meeting devoted primarily to
the Land Use Plan tonight at the
city council's chambers at 7 p.m.
They hope to voice their support

of the plan and emphasize the need
for additional graduate student
housing.
The (iSC also approved a plan
to have a graduate student I licks
screening of the hit movie "Nutting
I lill" in November.
