## Don't buy into the SuperDisc gimmick 
### 
A couple of weeks ago I wrote to inform you, niy loyal public, about the resur
gence of vinyl LP records. The response was resounding, with many people
writing to the Daily offices, contacting my fan club and even stopping me in the
streets to say, "Who cares?"
It seems most people see CDs as the end of music reproduction evolution. (Editor's
note: Well, actually, the MP3 and Liquid Audio technology may be the next step for
music sales.) So I've decided to take you guys to school and tell you something about
how these little aluminum discs came about and why your children may collect CDs as

retro-ironic totems akin to cocktail shakers or lava lamps.
In 1948,33-1/3 rpm LPs were introduced, and they were as
neat as a new Studebaker. The following year, 45 rpm singles
began production, and in 1957, stereo records became avail
able, and they were as keen as a new Packard with fins. These
vinyl records remained the status quo for nearly 40 years
after their introduction.
Sure, the wax became thinner when petroleum products
were rationed in the '70s, and record companies invented
such things as "microgroove" and "full-dimensional sound"
to both improve the sound and impress the buyer, but in gen
eral the technology remained the same. Stereo cassettes were
introduced in 1966 and Dolby in 1970, but records remained
the backbone of the music industry.
Finally, in 1983 the compact disc was unveiled, and it was
as awesome as a new Yugo. I can remember the first time I
saw one of the new-fangled things. My folks were at Sears,

shopping for a new lawnmower or something, and I wandered over to the stereo de
partment.
This guy was demonstrating the miracle of CD technology. He took the disc,
stomped on it, threw it against the wall, held it inside a lion's mouth... maybe a couple
of other things too, for it was a long time ago and I don't remember so well.
Anyway, he eventually put it in the player, and indeed the stereo blasted out "Great
Balls of Fire" and sounded as good as or better than the original Sun single.
"See?" the salesman said with a Barnum-and-Bailey smile, "Compact discs are vir
tually indestructible and will not skip!" Which was all true. Compact discs never skip,

they can hold an unlimited amount of music, if you cut one up and eat it, then you
can fly. So with all these amazing powers, CDs quickly surpassed LPs as the premier
music medium. It was also helped along by the fact that since CDs are a lot cheaper to
make than LPs and yet are priced at twice as much, record companies were very keen
to switch over production.
And so it has been decreed and so it shall remain until Heimdall blows his horn.
Minidisc and DAT have come and gone faster than you can say "8-track," and the com
pact disc remains king of the hill.

The only trouble is that CD technology is not all that any
more. It was made with a 16-bit technology and a 44 kHz
sampling rate. In simple terms, if the world were stuck in CD
level technology, then an IBM 286 and the Clapper would be
amazing innovations.(TVow, don't overlook the Smart Clap
per — what a breakthrough that was!)
With DVD technology having pushed the borders of what
you can do with a CD, record companies have begun intro
ducing what they hope will be the next generation of sound
reproduction technology: the Super Disc (a.k.a. High Densi
ty Audio Disc). Basically, they upgraded the sampling rate
and all the other technology. Why shouldn't this go the way
of the minidisc? Because even though it requires an expen
sive (around $2000 right now) Super Disc player to take ad
vantage of the new technology, it will also sound as good as a
normal CD in a normal CD player.
So this is good, right? Everything getting better all the time

forever through the onward march of progress.
However, I'm less than enthusiastic. I'm not ready to upgrade my collection (espe
cially since every couple of years a new digitally remastered and bonus-track-contain
ing upgrade of every album I own seems to be re-issued). I'm not ready to see my siz
able CD collection go the way of the 8-track.
I'm especially not ready to pay $30 or more, the current price of a Super Disc, for
every album I want. Right now, I'm trying to figure out what country is responsible for
servicing my Yugo.
