# UN
						Film Festival comes to Stanford
## BEARING A VISIONARY MESSAGE Movies 
### 
Do not be fooled by the name. The United Nations Association
Film Festival (UNAFF), held through Saturday in Cubberley and
Annenburg Auditoriums, is not a dreary look at the world's cur
rent problems. Many problems are explored, but the festival itself is an ex
citing collection of 26 documentaries from around the world (including
some world premieres) exploring where we are — the good, the bad and
the ugly — and how we look at the past, the present and the future.
A reception opens the festival, presented by the UNA Midpeninsula

U.N. Association Film Festival
Cubberley / Annenberg Auditoriums
Through Oct. 24

Chapter and the Stanford Film
Society, at 6:30 tonight at Cubber
ley Auditorium in the School of
Education. After the reception, a
montage of photos taken within
our borders entitled "What Does
a Person Deserve?" will be pre-

sented as a way to ask what a human right actually is, and whether we are
fulfilling those rights for our people.
The first full-length feature is "Genghis Blues," an awesome film in
every meaning of the word. With numerous film festival awards and criti-

cal acclaim, "Genghis" is about a blind bluesman, Paul
Pena, who travels to Tuva, a little-known autonomous
region in southern Siberia. Geographically and politi
cally isolated for centuries, Tuva came to Pena's at
tention over Radio Moscow, where the unique talent
of Tuvan throatsinging was demonstrated.
If you haven't heard throatsinging, that alone is
worth the price of admission — Tuvans actually ma
nipulate their vocal chords to sing multiple notes at
once. This, and the amazing mix of cultures and com
monalities, makes this film a don't miss. To top it off,
the filmmakers will be at the festival.
The first night's films continue with more about un
usual cultures, far and near, and the political violence
that still echoes through "civilized" Europe in the '90s.

The next two days, which begin at 4 p.m. and 1 p.m., respectively, take
place at Annenburg Auditorium in the Cummings Art Building. Friday's
films explore savagery within and without, from cancer to civil war, and
from African female circumcision to American involvement in Vietnam.
Several films in the festival confront the Vietnam War and its effects
from several thought-provoking perspectives. One of them, shown Friday
night, is the world-premiere of "Riding the Tiger," about the War itself.
This documentary was produced and directed by Stanford professor Krisj
Samuelson and her husband, John Haptas.
Another film of note is "Cancer in Two Voices," by Bay Area film-

maker Lucy Massie Fhenix, who will present two other films at the festival. "Voic
es" deals with the lives of a Jewish lesbian couple after one is diagnosed with ter
minal breast cancer. The couple talks about their identity as Jews, women and les
bians, and the trials of dealing with cancer, as a sufferer and a loved one.
Saturday continues showing the havoc wreaked by various world conflicts, from
South America to the Far and Middle East. "Borders" explores the difficulties of
having a cold war among neighbors, as families and societies are torn apart in Is
rael and the surrounding area, having to cope with demarcation on a daily basis.
Echoing "What Does a Person Deserve?" are the questions raised by the films
shown on Saturday night, regarding what may or may not be human rights abuses,
from China to Chicago. Is the Clinton-spurred movement for the release of Puer
to Rican revolutionaries too soon or long overdue? Is it considered a human rights
abuse to give families an alternative to war-torn Chechnya in the fall-out shadow
of Chernobyl?
Sunday begins at 1 p.m. in Cubberley Auditorium with examinations of Cau
casians in China and Chinese in Taiwan, as well as personal narrations from the

fate of wandering for Gypsies (Roma) and Indians (Native Americans) in the Unit
ed States.
The festival closes with 1999 Academy Award Nominee for Best Feature Doc
umentary, "Regret to Inform." This film was edited by Lucy Massie Phenix and
written and produced by Barbara Sonneborn. Sonneborn, a widow of the Vietnam
War, delves into the past and present of the War by taking a pilgrimage to Vietnam,
finding out about her husband and several other men who have left behind women
in America and Vietnam.
Many of the filmmakers will be at the festival to discuss their films after the
screenings. What's better, it's free for undergrads, $4 per day for other students, $6
per day for the general public and $20 for a four-day pass, so take a break and think
about the world outside our bubble.
