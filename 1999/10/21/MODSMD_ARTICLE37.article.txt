## A 						small glimpse into the lives of two rising stars ... and how they're dealing with fame. Live at Intermission: malcolm Lee and Taye Diggs 
### 
Intermission had not one, but two interviews this pust
week. First is a chut with Mulcolm Lee, director of "The
Best Mun" und cousin of Spike Lee. Luter comes u tulk
with the unmarried star of "The Best Man," Taye Diggs.
Intermission: The ensemble group had a really good
chemistry. Was that pretty much the feeling on the set?
Malcolm Lee: it was. We were really blessed, and we all
gelled really quickly. There was a lot of love and mutual
respect on the set. You know, it was challenging at times,
but they all trusted me to make this film what it was. For
trusting a first-time director, it was good to have the kind
of chemistry we all did.

I: Did you go into this confidently?
ML: I didn't quite know what it was like to direct
a feature picture. I had assisted Spike [Lee] a few
times and made short films myself, but that is not
this level. At times, it was a little overwhelming, |
especially during the pre-production part. They
want to know the color palette, or the kind of bag |
this character carries, or is this location okay? —
all kinds of things like that which were really *-

overwhelming and nervewracking. And during the pro
duction itself it was fine until we got to the big scenes, like
the wedding scene. You have all your talent, plus extras.
The makeup, especially for women, takes hours.
I: Is it difficult to cast a black movie with a major Hol
lywood studio? I would imagine that they probably
wanted big names, like a rapper or a basketball star, to
give it glamour. Did you run into that?
ML I"here were some really outlandish suggestions, like
Babyface, Jermaine Dupree, Michael Jordan, Magic
Johnson. I think it's almost more of a business than an
art, because there's a lot of money going in to produce
and direct the film at a big studio level. But I think that by
making this film and exposing the mainstream to these
actors, they will become more mainstream. People are
starting to get to know Taye Diggs more. All of the actors
in this film have had roles in black film or television, and
this is their chance to really break out, see what they can
do. I hope it will get them more serious work, not just as

"the black friend," "the thief," "the rapist" or what have
you.
I: Hopefully they are on their way to "Denzel-dom."
ML: Yeah! At the same time, there are so many black ac
tors. New stars are being made all the time, but rarely are
they black. I saw an article in "Entertainment Weekly" a
few weeks ago about new hot young talent. There were
maybe like 50 or 60 of them, and three of them were
black, and two of the black ones were singers — you
know, Brandy and Usher. I mean. Usher is an okay actor,
but there are people who have studied the craft who de
serve to be seen.

Lauren Russell talks with the
director and star of the black
wedding comedy 'The Best man'

I: The black community has not recently come out to
support black films, such as "The Wood," "Summer of
Sam " and "Beloved," that are not outrageous comedies.
Why do you think those movies, which probably de
served more than they got in recognition, bombed?
ML: That's hard to say. I think black folks do come out
on the opening day. "Beloved" is an exception because it
is a very painful depiction of black America that black
folks don't want to deal with.
I: They want to look forward and not back.
ML: Not only that, but they don't want a history lesson.
They want to be entertained. And I think the perception
was that they were not going to be entertained by
"Beloved," which I think was a pretty good film. I think
audiences are starving for alternatives to the sex comedy
or the shoot-'em-up genre. There are so many different
interests in the black community. I think a movie like
"The Best Man," which is a real comedy, unlike "Booty

Call" or "How to Be a Player," is something people can
relate to. This is a movie that people can look at the
screen and say, "Wow, this is something I am, or some
thing 1 aspire to be." And hopefully that's what is going
to happen. The response from black audiences has been
tremendous. They have really taken to this film.
I: But I think "The Best Man" definitely has crossover
potential.
ML: Yes, it doesn't just cater to one audience. I mean,
yeah, the language might have a few barriers. But it's not
like when I go see a Woody Allen film, it's totally out of
the realm of my sense of humor or experience. So it's
something that I am hoping [white audiences] will

come to.
I: / would say that there is a huge humanistic as
pect to this film. I could really relate to the actors
on a deeper level.
ML: That's what I really wanted to accomplish. A
lot of African-American directors are about being
black or are so overwrought with issues that over
shadow the film itself. But I think with this movie.

we have distinctly black dialogue and culture, but it's not
so specific that it isn't universal. We are dealing with very
universal themes, and 1 really wanted to get that across.
Deep down inside we all are people, we go through the
same kinds of issues and feelings that everybody else
does.
I: It reminds me of "Friends," and the only difference is
that the actors are black.
ML: We are going to run commericals during "Ally
Mcßeal" and "Friends" to try and get people to come out
to the theater. The problem is, I think black people and
white people don't necessarily socialize in the same
areas. When you leave work, you might have a beer, but
on the weekend you are going to different clubs and bars.
So I think coming together for a film that is not an Eddie
Murphy or a Will Smith movie could be somewhat diffi
cult for people to feel like they will be accepted in that
kind of an environment. Everybody can enjoy these
characters on the screen. At one time, the number one


Lauren Russell — Dally
show in America was"The Cosby Show." And that
wasn't about being black; it was about a family where
the mother was a lawyer and the father was a doctor, and
you wanted to know what happened with the kids every
week. You expected them to finish high school and go to
college, it wasn't a big deal, and they were just profes
sional people. It was good writing, and it doesn't hurt to
have Bill Cosby as your leading man.
I: It also is a lot like "My Best Friend's Wedding." Did
that film influence you at all?
ML: Certainly, that was a big influence on this film. A lot
of wedding pictures, including "Four Weddings and a
Funeral," which is one of my favorite films, had influ
ence on this picture. People like wedding films, and
there haven't been any African-American versions of
wedding films to date. And that's one of the reasons I
started to write it. On one hand, my purpose was to get
the script sold. On the other hand, this was something I
was very passionate about — doing a wedding story
with African-American characters at the center of the
story.
I: The card table scene was tome the most po werjul part
of the movie. You did a great job with the camera. How
did you film it?
ML: In the original screenplay, that scene was about 10
pages long, and I cut it down a lot. This was my chance
to show black men bonding on the screen, without them
bonding over gun play or shooting up drugs.
I: Or a 40 in a brown bag.
ML: Right. These guys are bonding as friends, coming
together, talking about women and relationships. And
for men, I think it was a good opportunity to show that
camaraderie on the screen, and for women, I thought it

would be like a fly on the wall scene for them. "Oh, that's
what they talk about." The guys did a tremendous job on
that. When we got to each of their close-ups, they were
really battling one another. I would go up to Harold or
Taye, and I would be like "Morris really did a fabulous
job on that. You gotta step up!" It was a very friendly
competition. They wanted to do well, and they wanted
each other to do well. It was very exausting. We did each
angle two times, and we had two cameras on each angle.
We had to make it dynamic, so we decided to give it a lot
of energy.
I: Lance is super-religious, and Harper is exactly the
opposite. Where do you fall on this scale?
ML: You know, I am not a churchgoer, but I do believe
in God as a higher power and 1 do pray. Blacks are very
churchgoing and faithful people. That whole scene in
the wedding is trying to break stereotypes. You know,
whenever you see blacks in church in the movies, there's
a fat woman fanning herself in the pew as she is catching
the Holy Ghost, "Praise Jesus!" And you see the fire
and-brimstone preacher shouting "You got to pray!" I
think there are a lot of people in this country who take
religion seriously, and I don't think Hollywood has done
a good job at showing that. When we shot that scene
with Harper and Lance, 1 was told we have to keep that
because that has never been done before — two black
man praying together. It was brought in a comedic way
with Lance grabbing his penis, holding the Bible in the
flashback and saying "What is wrong with you?" but
that's a way to make people feel more comfortable.
I: Are you thinking of making a sequel?
ML: No, not at all. Maybe way down the line. But I want
this movie to stand on its own just as " The Best Man." 1
want it to be a classic.

Now Intermission gets to Mr. Diggs.
Intermission: So far, in films anyway, you have been
playing a stand-up, trustworthy guy. Do you have any
compulsion to play a bad guy?
Taye Diggs: In 'The Way of the Gun" [which has yet to
be released], I play a bad guy, a bodyguard, and I can't
imagine anyone I would want to be a bad guy for more
than Chris McQuarry, because of his writing. He did
"The Usual Suspects." His writing is just so on top of it
that I will be a bad guy, a good guy, whatever. Any day.
I: / was especially impressed by your character in "Go."
How did you get that role?
TD: I was proud, because that was before ["How Stella
Got Her Groove Back"] came out. In Hollywood it's all
about buzz, so any auditions were because of the buzz
before "Stella." But for that movie, I would have gotten
that whether "Stella" had existed. [The director] was
that kind a cat. We were all pretty gritty actors at that
point. The average [Hollywood] person doesn't know
much about stage work, and when you don't have any
screen, you are not worth anything. Unless, like in my
case, they want a no-name. Like in "Stella." That type of
role in the "real world" would have gone to somebody
like Wesley Snipes.
I: Is your upcoming "The House on Haunted Hill"
going to be scary?
TD: I think that it will be disturbing. I saw the trailer a
few days ago. It's kind of freaky. I mean, there is some
camp in it because it's a remake of the original, this ter
rible film. Some of that is added, but there are some
terrifying moments. (cont.)
I: h always seems like you are taking your clothes off in
your movies, not that it is a bad thing at all.
TD: They have never added that in after I came on. You
know, it was always part of the role. It's been the role of
the romantic lead. Brad Pitt anctTom Cruise have to do
it too. It has been refreshing lately in my recent roles not
to be so blatantly sexual or being put on that pedestal:
"Oooh, this is the scene where he takes off his shirt."
I: How have you dealt with becoming a sex symbol
overnight? How do you deal on a day-to-day basis?
TD: I only get bits and pieces of it. Here and there, peo
ple on the street. Publicity really hypes it up the most.
Maybe after this movie comes out, it will be a little
rougher, but it really hasn't been that rough. I went out to
a predominantly black club last night, and nobody said
anything. I was kind a wishing someone would! Nobody
said a thing! I haven't really crossed over into ladies
throwing their panties at me or anything. But when I read
about it or get asked these questions, it tickles me be
cause I was not like this in high school. 1 was much thin
ner and nerdier. I didn't have as much confidence. I was
insecure. Deep down, that person still remains. I get a
kick out of all this with me all studded out in magazine ar
ticles.
I: / read that you also were shy as a child How did you
get into acting?

TD: It was my mother. And certain TV shows like
"Fame" made me want to act. My mother was going to
school at a rather late age, and she got me into drama
when she was doing it, and she got me to go to this per
forming arts magnet school.
I: Was acting a way to get over your shyness?
TD: Definitely. At some point, I was so shy that I couldn't
even act. It got in the way of my performance. Then one
drama teacher, Mr. Schneider, turned a little key, and I
found out what I could do.
I: / know that you also have a lot of theater experience
in the past. You starred in "Rent, "for example. Do you
plan to return to that in the future?
TD: Actually, until April, I am not going to be doing any
other film work. I am going to be working on a show
called "The Wild Party." It's a piece based on a poem; I
am very excited about it. I jump at any chance to go back
to theater. That's what acting is to me. That is how I
learned my craft. Whenever I act in film, there is a certain
amount of altering I have to do to my style because it is
so different.
I: There has been a lot of on-again, ojf-again talk about
a "Rent" movie. I am sure as soon as that happens, they
will be talking to you.
TD: I have not heard of making a movie version of

["Rent"] since we were on Broadway. Spike Lee came to
the show like eight times. DeNiro's company bought it. I
don't know that I would be up for it now. It's about those
specific characters, and at the time it was so magical. But
they might have to find some new people to have that
magic again. I am not the same person I was then. We
were all at different places; we don't have that rawness of
struggling artists. I have been in limos to premieres. It
doesn't have that newness.
I: Let's see, you haven't been married in real life, have
you?
TD: No.
I: But you have had two wedding movies in the past year.
How do they compare?
TD: I guess that to me, one of them is more about young
people, and the other is about grown people. I like that
"The Best Man" is a movie that can be referred to as a
black film, but the subject is not only appealing to black
people.
I: There were some really great scenes in"The Best
Man." Can you describe any memorable shooting mo
ments?
TD: Well, in the bachelor party, it was like a party every
day. The scene took a couple of days. When they rolled it
was really like a bachelor party. We got to be guys.
