## A
						small glimpse into the lives of two rising stars ... and how they're dealing with fame. Live at Intermission: malcolm Lee and Taye Diggs 
### 
Intermission had not one, but two interviews this pust
week. First is a chut with Mulcolm Lee, director of "The
Best Mun" und cousin of Spike Lee. Luter comes u tulk
with the unmarried star of "The Best Man," Taye Diggs.
Intermission: The ensemble group had a really good
chemistry. Was that pretty much the feeling on the set?
Malcolm Lee: it was. We were really blessed, and we all
gelled really quickly. There was a lot of love and mutual
respect on the set. You know, it was challenging at times,
but they all trusted me to make this film what it was. For
trusting a first-time director, it was good to have the kind
of chemistry we all did.

I: Did you go into this confidently?
ML: I didn't quite know what it was like to direct
a feature picture. I had assisted Spike [Lee] a few
times and made short films myself, but that is not
this level. At times, it was a little overwhelming, |
especially during the pre-production part. They
want to know the color palette, or the kind of bag |
this character carries, or is this location okay? —
all kinds of things like that which were really *-

overwhelming and nervewracking. And during the pro
duction itself it was fine until we got to the big scenes, like
the wedding scene. You have all your talent, plus extras.
The makeup, especially for women, takes hours.
I: Is it difficult to cast a black movie with a major Hol
lywood studio? I would imagine that they probably
wanted big names, like a rapper or a basketball star, to
give it glamour. Did you run into that?
ML I"here were some really outlandish suggestions, like
Babyface, Jermaine Dupree, Michael Jordan, Magic
Johnson. I think it's almost more of a business than an
art, because there's a lot of money going in to produce
and direct the film at a big studio level. But I think that by
making this film and exposing the mainstream to these
actors, they will become more mainstream. People are
starting to get to know Taye Diggs more. All of the actors
in this film have had roles in black film or television, and
this is their chance to really break out, see what they can
do. I hope it will get them more serious work, not just as

"the black friend," "the thief," "the rapist" or what have
you.
I: Hopefully they are on their way to "Denzel-dom."
ML: Yeah! At the same time, there are so many black ac
tors. New stars are being made all the time, but rarely are
they black. I saw an article in "Entertainment Weekly" a
few weeks ago about new hot young talent. There were
maybe like 50 or 60 of them, and three of them were
black, and two of the black ones were singers — you
know, Brandy and Usher. I mean. Usher is an okay actor,
but there are people who have studied the craft who de
serve to be seen.

Lauren Russell talks with the
director and star of the black
wedding comedy 'The Best man'

I: The black community has not recently come out to
support black films, such as "The Wood," "Summer of
Sam " and "Beloved," that are not outrageous comedies.
Why do you think those movies, which probably de
served more than they got in recognition, bombed?
ML: That's hard to say. I think black folks do come out
on the opening day. "Beloved" is an exception because it
is a very painful depiction of black America that black
folks don't want to deal with.
I: They want to look forward and not back.
ML: Not only that, but they don't want a history lesson.
They want to be entertained. And I think the perception
was that they were not going to be entertained by
"Beloved," which I think was a pretty good film. I think
audiences are starving for alternatives to the sex comedy
or the shoot-'em-up genre. There are so many different
interests in the black community. I think a movie like
"The Best Man," which is a real comedy, unlike "Booty

Call" or "How to Be a Player," is something people can
relate to. This is a movie that people can look at the
screen and say, "Wow, this is something I am, or some
thing 1 aspire to be." And hopefully that's what is going
to happen. The response from black audiences has been
tremendous. They have really taken to this film.
I: But I think "The Best Man" definitely has crossover
potential.
ML: Yes, it doesn't just cater to one audience. I mean,
yeah, the language might have a few barriers. But it's not
like when I go see a Woody Allen film, it's totally out of
the realm of my sense of humor or experience. So it's
something that I am hoping [white audiences] will

come to.
I: / would say that there is a huge humanistic as
pect to this film. I could really relate to the actors
on a deeper level.
ML: That's what I really wanted to accomplish. A
lot of African-American directors are about being
black or are so overwrought with issues that over
shadow the film itself. But I think with this movie.

we have distinctly black dialogue and culture, but it's not
so specific that it isn't universal. We are dealing with very
universal themes, and 1 really wanted to get that across.
Deep down inside we all are people, we go through the
same kinds of issues and feelings that everybody else
does.
I: It reminds me of "Friends," and the only difference is
that the actors are black.
ML: We are going to run commericals during "Ally
Mcßeal" and "Friends" to try and get people to come out
to the theater. The problem is, I think black people and
white people don't necessarily socialize in the same
areas. When you leave work, you might have a beer, but
on the weekend you are going to different clubs and bars.
So I think coming together for a film that is not an Eddie
Murphy or a Will Smith movie could be somewhat diffi
cult for people to feel like they will be accepted in that
kind of an environment. Everybody can enjoy these
characters on the screen. At one time, the number one
