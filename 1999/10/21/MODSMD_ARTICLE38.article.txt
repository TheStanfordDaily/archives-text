# A 						wedding with invitations for everyone
## 'The Best Man' has definite cross-over appeal 
### 
I would hesitate to put "The Best Man" in the mold of "black film," because
being non-black did not prevent me from enjoying this movie. However, the
fact that there are not even non-black extras walking around in the back
ground gives the film a somewhat unnatural Hollywood feel.

"The Best Man" is a hearty drama that un
folds when a group of close college friends are re
united because of Mia (Monica Calhoun) and
Lance's (Morris Chesnut) wedding. Harper, played
by the buff and brilliant Taye Diggs, has become a
successful writer since graduating from college and
has written a-soon-to-be-released novel which remi
nisces about his college days.

The characters in the book all have different
names than his real-life friends, but as the weekend goes on it becomes more and

more obvious that
these characters are
really his friends. Se
crets are spilled, the
marriage is almost
spoiled and old flames
burn brightly as new
wood is thrown into
the fire.
In Malcolm Lee's
(Spike's cousin) di
recting debut, an ex
cellent ensemble cast
comes together for a
story which has been
described as "an
African-American
'The Big Chill.' " "The
Best Man" wisely cen
ters around this ensem-

blc cast, moving be
tween humorous
flashbacks to the
good ol' college
days and the ner
vous and compli
cated events which
occur before the
wedding.
The sexual ener
gy between Harper
and Jordan (Nia
Long) is never
quenched, and the
tension explodes as
Jordan seduces him
to give in to pas-

sion. Harper has left his serious girlfriend at home and is not having too hard of a
time resisting the thought of spending quality time in bed with Jordan.
This fantasy is interrupted when some of the wedding guests realize (by analyz
ing the book) that Harper (Lance's best man) slept with Mia in college. When
Lance comes to this realization, all hell breaks loose, and the wedding is called off.
Harper loses both his best friend (over Mia) and his girlfriend (over Jordan), and
he now faces the task of reconciling Lance and getting him to walk down the aisle
on wedding day. The final scene creates the nervewracking momentum also found
in other wedding films such as "My Best Friend's Wedding" and "Four Weddings
and a Funeral."
While this film is not quite as classic as "The Big Chill," it is both moving and
hysterically funny, with painted characters anyone could relate to or understand.
"The Best Man" is worth a watch because of its mix of humor and intensity. There
are times when stereotypes leave a bland Hollywood taste in the mouth, but this is
an entertaining romp through the chaos of love and friendship.
