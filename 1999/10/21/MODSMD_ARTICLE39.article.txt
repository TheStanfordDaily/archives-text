Hubbard Street Dance Chicago's 20 diverse dancers
ardently embrace the visions of such luminary choreo
graphers as David Parsons, Nacho Duato, and Jiri
Kylian. The Son Francisco Chronicle roves, "Humor and
sensuality, classical aplomb, and show-biz pizzazz....
A national treasure." Post-performance discussion
with artists follows (Friday only).

with the spontaneity and excitement of jazz. The
String Trio of New York—inspired by works of
Ellington, Monk, and Mingus—blasts through the
parameters of chamber music with a marriage of com
position and improvisation dubbed "comprovisation."

conductor, and arranger, has achieved heights unlike
