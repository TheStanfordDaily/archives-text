A delicious blend of sounds, spo
ken and synthesized, a savory
layering of synthesized spoken
sounds, a funky mix of sounds synthe
sized to be spoken — this must be the in
tention of IQU and Miranda July on the

IQU with Miranda July
Girls On Dates
★★☆ ☆ ☆

release "Girls On Dates."
The EP consists of four tracks —
"Girls On Dates," "Kida Co-Coma,"
"Girls On Dates (K.O. Love Mix)" and
"Kida Co-Coma (DJ Swiggs Mix)." The
first of the two original tracks, "Girls On
Dates," starts off with slightly goofy
beats and a bouncy bass-line.
Miranda July's spoken stuff is first
mixed over the initial sounds, but then
the music breaks and the spotlight
shines on Miss July alone — or rather on
"both" of her as she performs a sort of
interview-dialogue. The beats aren't
gone for long, however, and they even
manage to regain center stage with a ca
cophonous blend of sounds that peter
out at the very end.
"Kida Co-Coma" starts as a mother
speaks to her comatose daughter's
friend — "And, there! She's dressed.
Oh, 1 like to put her hair up in a little clip
like this. Isn't that a cute look for her?"
"She would never wear her hair up in a
thing like that." "Well, she doesn't know
the difference."
The rest of the track details the

friend's attempt to revive the girl
friend in a coma, and the mother's
frustration and defensive attitude in
regard to her daughter's care.
The second half of the EP, con
sisting of the two re-mixes, is not as
heavy on the Miranda July. Further,
the beats are sparser; their bare
bones quality makes the songs im
mensely more interesting, or at least
less grating.
You might be tired of discover
ing independent music groups only
to be told, "The stranger the better"
and "If it has any musical value, it
loses its integrity." Well, you won't
have to deal with that if you listen to
"Girls On Dates." The music isn't
all that weird, and neither are Miss
July's contributions.
The danger of most raw, inde
pendent music is that it tries to say
too much, to be too damn "raw."
The trouble with techno, electroni
ca, etc., is that they don't seem to be
saying anything, although one could
say that a message would be unnec
cessary or even obsolete. But when
indie beat teams up with indie spo
ken word and manages not to say
anything of importance, something
has gone seriously wrong.
Thus, IQU and Miranda July
collaborate on "Girls On Dates"
without producing an exciting syn
thesis of sounds. The styles end up
more at odds with each other in an
unfortunately rather unimpressive
way.
