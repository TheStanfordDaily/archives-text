# Kenny Wayne Shephard with 'Live On'
## 
### 
When Kenny Wayne Shephard was a little boy,
Stevie Ray Vaughn set Shephard on top of an
amplifier during a concert. There, he was first
exposed to what would become his passion — the blues.
Hailed as the next Stevie Ray, his first album was a solid
blues record, despite sounding similar to his inspiration.
Two albums later, Shephard seems to have lost his way.

The new
album, "Live
On," is a great
disappoint
ment. As an
album, it just
doesn't hold

together. Shephard seems to be trying too hard to create a
unique musical identity for himself, and this effort leads to
a potpourri of unrealated music.
The album opens with a song which approximates
heavy metal. The band doesn't seem to be together, and
it's hard to hear exactly what is going on. The next song
features vocals accompanied by a bluesy acoustic slide
guitar. Then, a dance beat comes in behind the chorus.
The third song sounds like a cross between "Dancing in
the Street" and Peter Gabriel's "Steam."
In addition to simply sounding bad, Shephard's exper
iments highlight his limitations as a musician. His solos
sound exactly the same as solos he played on his first
album. The same licks which sounded so good back then
are beginning to seem a little stale.
It seems that regardless of the type of music he is trying

to play, Shephard has a limited repertoire of blues licks
from which to choose. His solos on some of the less bluesy
songs feel out of place, while his best solos feel like at
tempts to duplicate the sound of his first album.
Even when he does play the blues, it feels boring and
generic. At best, the blues on this album seem like a poor
imitation of Shephard's earlier work.
Since the blues are based on such a standard and sim
ple form, they often turn into mundane repetitions of
generic blues lyrics and licks. On his first album, Shephard
was somehow able to add something that allowed his
music to rise above this form. On "Live On," he resorts
back to standard blues that seem no better than what you
could hear in any local bar.
To make it even worse, on many songs, the guitar solos
are simply mixed too low. As the song moves into the solo,
the guitar is the driving force behind the song. Then sud
denly it gets lost behind the rest of the band. If you listen
really hard, you can hear that Shephard is still playing his
solo. Either not enough care was put into the mixing, or
Shephard was ashamed of his solos and tried to bury them
behind his band.
Overall, this is a horrible album; I would not recom
mend it to anyone. If you really want to buy a Kenny
Wayne Shepherd CD, check out his first album. If you are
just looking for some blues, take Shephard's advice and
"Always listen to the masters." But definitely take my ad
vice and stay away from "Live On."
