# Why YOU need to make time for
## the 						Kramlich Collection at the MOMA Art/Food 
### 
£ £1 eeing Time: Selections from the Pamela and Richard Kramlich Collection of
Media Art contains a number of time-based video and film installations
demonstrating how new technologies transform social and intellectual life
— and consequently art. Their point is to elevate the status of art from merely tangi
ble, distinct objects to something of "temporal human experience."
Well, that s what I got out of the big glossy book they gave me, but from my artis
tically unenlightened perspective, it is a floor of the San Francisco Museum of Mod
ern Art filled with simply really cool and often quite bizarre pieces of art.
I know it's not very appropriate to describe art as "cool," but given the predomi-

nance of now-mundane technologies such as televisions as the medium for many of
the pieces, I feel it only fitting to refer to video pieces like Matthew Barney's vague
ly "Clockwork Orange"-esque "Cremaster I" as "rad."
Many of the pieces walk the thin line between being short experimental films and
art pieces using a film medium. However you refer to it, there's plenty of bizarre eye
candy to engage one's attention.

Oddly enough, I'd say my favorite piece, or at least the one
I still think about the most, was Bruce Nauman's aggressively
irritating "Raw Material — OK, OK, OK," which consists of
one large screen and two adjacent smaller televisions project
ing Nauman's spinning head while he perpetually blurts out
"OK," ad nauseum. Supposedly meant to portray Nauman's
own anger and frustration at an uncaring world, 1 found my
self staring at his spinning noggin far longer than I expected,

fully mesmerized.
Another favorite, due perhaps to the piece's explanation by its creator, was Keith
Tyson's "Artmachine Iteration AMCHII-XLII: Angelmaker Part II Quadruped." It
was refreshing to meet a young artist who was willing to graciously talk with two un

derdressed college reviewers.
Tyson's enormous piece consists of four separate-but-connected stages repre
senting separate death scenarios. The number of people involved increases with
each. It begins with a British politician asphyxiating himself with a Hoover vacuum
cleaner as he masturbates, and then it progresses to a family dining room table cont
aminated with multiplying bacteria, a Titanic mock-up and finally a model Chinese
village awaiting an earthquake.
Tyson explained that his apparently non-tech-related work is actually co-created
by the " Artmachine," a computer he has programmed with thousands of separate in-

formation sites. The program randomly generates an artistic task for
him to see to fruition, completely removing him from the decision
making process of his work's subject matter.
Bob Viola, who recently had an exceptional exhibit of his own at
the MOMA, is again represented, this time with a film entitled "The
Greeting." It is a 45-second film of two women meeting a third,
slowed down to an excruciating 10 minutes, allowing full exposure
to every painful moment of social inadequacy.
Further highlights are collaborators Stephanie Smith and Edward
Stewart's pieces, "Sustain" and "Intercourse," both of which incor
porate split-screen films and demonstrate a bit of an oral fixation on
the part of the artists.
"Sustain" consists of an underwater headshot of Stewart — who
relies on Smith to breath into his mouth — atop a simultaneous body
shot of Stewart as Smith completely covers his body with hickeys.

"Intercourse" utilizes a technique prevalent with several of the works: films are
projected onto adjacent or opposite walls as a means to appreciate the eponymous
subject matter. Vito Acconci's "Pornography in the Classroom" and Jane and Louise
Wilson's eerie, claustrophobic "Stasi City" are good examples of this same format.
Other compelling films include Barney's "Scabation," a sickening piece. I'll sim
ply describe this as a masochist's barber shop — I was so revolted I had to watch the
whole thing, so don't miss this one. The French pair Gilbert and George's two films
are similar, substituting Barney's gore with French-New-Wave-inspired monotony.
The piece that actually worked the least for me is perhaps the most indicative of
the exhibit as a whole. Mariko Mori's "Miko no Inori" is an insultingly insipid Japan
ese fairy-tale-esque portrait of the artist with several lame "hi-tech" effects that
aren't very special. As a piece that relies predominantly on the technological tricks of
its time, its effectiveness shows that technology is only a means and not an end.
Overall, "Seeing Time" is a highly engaging and visually stunning collection of
pieces best representative of our time, simultaneously mocking and glorifying the
technology enabling their creation.

Mori's "Mikono Inori" (1996) makes you wonder about modern technology.
