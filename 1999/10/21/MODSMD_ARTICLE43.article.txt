# Cuisine benefits from a fresh breath of simplicity at new India Palace

### 
A newcomer to the bustling restaurant scene on University Ave., New India
Palace's simple decor and traditional Indian cuisine provides a relaxing con
trast to Palo Alto's otherwise yuppie culture.
My roommate and 1 stopped in on a Saturday night around 7 p.m., and the small
restaurant was full except for one table for two. The crowd was diverse but consisted
mainly of small parties — couples, students and a few lone diners.

New India Palace
448 University Ave.
Palo Alto
(650) 327-3455

Perhaps it is impossible not to attract a crowd on a
Saturday night on University Ave., so we did not automat
ically assume that the full house meant quality food.
But we were pleasantly surprised by the no-non
sense menu and wine list, the attentive service and very

calm atmosphere. The menu included both meat and vege
tarian entries and gives the choice of ordering a full dinner or the individual entrees.
With vindaloo, curry and tandoori dishes, the restaurant remains true to Indian cui
sine while offering a large array of entree choices and combination dinners.
We ordered full dinners, which come with nan bread, basmati rice and a bowl of yo

gurt, all Indian staples. The Aloo Palak. a spinach and potato dish cooked with season
ings and spices, was very rich but didn't drown out the natural flavors of the vegetables.
Our other dish, the Chicken Korma, is described on the menu as "boneless and ten
der pieces of chicken cooked in mildly spiced cream sauce." We agreed that this dish
was also excellent and true to its description.
Satisfied by our meal, I finished up my mango lassi and ordered the traditional In
dian dessert, Gulab Jamcn, which are cottage cheese balls deep fried and then dipped
in syrup and rose water. While it sounds strangely foreign, the result is a sweet melt-in
your mouth dessert.
However, the Gulab Jamcn was served cold, and depending on your taste you may
prefer hot Gulab Jamcn, which is softer to the bite.
My roommate and I decided over a full stomach that the New India Palace made us
happy, and we will probably go back for its seven-day-a-week $6.99 lunch buffet.
The restaurant takes reservations and is located next to Borders Bookstore.
