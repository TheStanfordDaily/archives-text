## A
						TASTe Of The South: Semen and Vaginal Secretions 
### Roxy Sass Staff writer 
Miss Sass thinks the mouth is a wonderful organ. Warm, moist and muscular, it re
ally lends itself to sexual activity. Unfortunately, humans generally aren't flexible
enough to take their own genitalia into their mouths. Because of this anatomical mis
construction, humans don't know what their sexual fluids taste and smell like. Ironi
cally, most enjoy oral sex, which puts their beloved in contact with these mysterious
secretions.
• If you have either given or received oral sex, you probably wonder about these flu
ids. When you are giving, you wonder about cleanliness and content. When you re
ceive, you wonder what you can do to taste and smell your best.
Before going into this. Miss Sass must talk about risk. A person receiving unpro
tected oral sex has an extremely low risk of contracting STDs, but the giver is at a sig
nificant risk for a number of diseases, including AIDS.
Condoms and dental dams provide the best defense against these diseases. They
also allow the giver to use a flavored lubricant.
If you decide to forego the latex, you can reduce your risk in a number of ways.
During oral sex, bacteria and viruses typically enter the body through small cuts or
sores in the mouth. Brushing your teeth lacerates the gums, so don't brush or floss for
two hours before giving oral sex. If you want fresh breath, try a breath mint. Mints
have the added benefit of giving your partner some pretty remarkable tingles as the
mint penetrates the mucous membranes around his or her genitals.
If you are giving fellatio, you are safest if the man does not ejaculate in your
mquth. If he does, then spitting is much better than swallowing, but either way, spit
or swallow immediately. Don't hold the semen in your mouth longer than necessary.
If your partner pressures you to do something that makes you feel unsafe or un
comfortable, you should reconsider having oral sex with this person. Oral sex com
bines the pleasure of giving with the pleasure of receiving. Consequently, Miss Sass
recommends that people who are comfortable with one half but not the other should
wait until they are willing to both give and receive before doing either.
Now, that said. Miss Sass would like to explore the wondrous solutions that peo
ple produce.
Semen, which is mostly fluid emitted from the prostate gland, contains sugars to
nourish sperm, proteins, citric acid and alkalines.
Surprisingly, only 1 to 5 percent of semen is actually sperm, though there may be
millions of sperm in a single ejaculate. Semen's nutritional value is pretty low for a
person, although it's great for sperm. Luckily, it's also low in calories — just five per
teaspoon.
A man typically ejaculates one to three teaspoons of semen, and its viscosity
ranges from watery to clumpy. Both quantity and consistency reflect genetics, the du
ration of foreplay, the amount of prostate stimulation and the length of time since the
last orgasm.
Vaginal secretions lubricate and neutralize the vagina and consist mostly of alka
lines. The liquid seeps through the vaginal walls from surrounding blood vessels. The
amount produced by a woman depends on her genetics and age. One in five women
produce very little lubrication, even when fully aroused. On the other hand, some
women are capable of female ejaculation. During orgasm, they emit up to a table
spoon of a milky fluid from the Skene's gland that is compositionally similar to the
prostatic fluids of a man.
If semen and vaginal secretions are STD-free, then they are hygienically clean.
Soaping the outer genitalia is sufficient preparation for receiving oral sex. If you are
a woman, avoid douches because they increase your risk of infection and STDs.
Sexual fluids are generally salty and sour, though the exact taste varies from per
son to person. As with coffee, some people like the taste, some hate the taste and
some acquire the taste.
Although no conclusive studies have been done, diet probably affects the taste,
just as it affects the bodily aroma. Fruits most likely sweeten your fluids, and red
meat, onions, garlic and dairy products might make them more offensive.
As a giver, you have some control over the quality of your experience. Before
going down on your partner, wait until you are fully aroused. This dulls your prima
ry senses.
If you are performing fellatio and you don't want to taste the semen at all, you may
consider deep-throating. To do this, you learn to control your gag reflex. Then take
the penis into your throat. When a man orgasms in your throat, you don't taste his
semen because it never touches your tongue. However, the man's penis could lacer
ate the back of your throat, increasing your risk of acquiring an STD. As a side note,
the benefits for the receiver of deep-throating are minimal because a man's penis is
most sensitive near the head, not the base.
Sexual fluids lubricate intercourse and sustain sperm, those inventive cells with
tails. These natural fluids reflect the human body from which they came, and they
contain nothing that you shouldn't consume. You may not have a natural affinity for
these fluids, but never fear. Tastes change.
