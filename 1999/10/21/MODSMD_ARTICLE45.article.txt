# Take a Peep info this Underworld

### 
I think that going to a sleazy theater in the Mission to watch a bunch of
naked men gyrate live before your eyes is a very valid experience for the
average Stanford student. Heck, I do it all the time, and it's always a
valid experience,
Just kidding. Sort of.
Anyway, Ronnie Larsen's "All Mate Peep Show," the latest installment
from the creator of "Malting Porn" and '10 Naked Men." is a peep show
guisedas a play — or vice-versa.
The show, starring both well-known porn stars and {professional stage ac
tors, chronicles four main storylines, all within the context of rampant nudi
ty and naughtiness.
A shy kid from Oklahoma tries his hand atpeep-showdancing and even
tually learns to love it Another peep-show dancer, a heroin addict, falls in
love with a significantly older customer. A tortured businessman can't de
cide between his monogamous relationship and his obsession with the peep
show underworld.
The story's most gratuitous plot element arrives in the guise of Marco
Rossi, international porn star and professional body builder — Mr. New
York City, Mr. New Jersey, Mr. America.
inevitably, the shew culminates with a live performance from Rossi, and
his antics don't disappoint He — along with the other porn stars in the
cast — crawls through the audience and flexes his muscles. Writhing to
Madonna's dance mixes, the torn grind against salivating onlookers and
even whip out a sex toy or two for everyone to play with.
Of course, most of the show is far less explicit. The peep show boys' char
acters are drawn with sensitivity, thereby complicating stereotypes. The au
dience gains insight into how a "normal" guy can find himself dancing be
hind a glass barrier for money. The peep show dancers are not only objecti
fied others — they are human.
Ironically, the peep show boys long for love and commitment, yet they
perform for men who are desperately trying to forget their painful domes
tic realities and monogamous lifestyles. I guess the grass is always greener
on the other side.
I doubt, however, that the show's creators would want me to get to lost
in thematic explorations. The best parts of the show are those that don't re
quire too much thought. The actors have strong coraedic timing and bene
fit from a witty script, and the show features a lot of innovative, no-holds
barred dialogue.
Especially strong performances are delivered by OctavioSaez de Ibarra,
who plays a cross-dressing peep-show addict, and Paul Tena, who is hilari
ous as the Pakistani manager of the theatre.
Even theporn stars'acting isn't that bad. Granted, porn stars are not usu
al ly headed for Tony nominations, but aside from a few ugly hiccups, they
are competent on Mage. Chad Donovan in particular shines with a mono
logue about growing up with a single mother in Birmingham, Ala. at the be-
Some times, heavy dramatic efforts fall flat because porn stars mas
querading as actors are generally unequipped to handle sophisticated
scenes. That's understandable, though; they are certainly equipped in other
What's not unde*staa<Jatolft,however, are missed lines, technical mishaps
and occasional slow pacing. Occasionally—but only occasionally — the
actors seem unrehearsed.
Overall, however, {fee show is excellent, and most importantly, it's a lot
of fun. There's nudity, there's dancing and, if you turn your brain on, the
showoffers profound statements abcrnt peep show culture. It features a pul
sating soundtrack and a lap dance to Bonnie Tyler's "Total Eclipse of the
Heart." Who could ask for anything more?
