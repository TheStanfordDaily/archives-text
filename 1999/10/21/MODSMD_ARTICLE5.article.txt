# Faculty, students weigh merits of I-Hum in its first full year
## Frosh approve of increased options, decry pace of reading 
### Derek Fears 
In its first year as the sole option
for freshmen to fulfill the Area ()ne
requirement, the Introduction to
the I iunianities program is drawing
positive reviews from faculty, hut
mixed reactions from students.
The 1-Hum program has now
been in place for two years. I lowev
er. last year, students had I lie choice
between two remaining Cultures.
Ideas and Values tracks and several
I-I lum options.
According to Drama Dept. Prof.
Harry Elam. I-Hum director, the
program is meeting its objectives.
"Things are going pretty well."
Elam said. "Student feedback is
positive. One of the purposes of the
course is to get students to appreci
ate the importance of the humani
ties. We want to get students to
think about the processes of critical
writing and thinking."
According to English Prof. To
bias Wolff, who teaches an I-Hum
class titled "Self, Sacred, and the
I luman Good," a lot of compromis
es have been made with the new
curriculum.

"It was difficult to negotiate be
tween reading things closely and
covering a certain reach of materi
al." Wolff said.
C )neof the goals of 1-1 luni was to
reduce the amount of reading that
was required of students in the ( IV
program, hut discuss the readings in
greater depth.
However, sophomore Ada
Chen, who participated in the ( IV
program last year, said that the elim
ination of CIV was a mistake.
"'I veil though (IV was a ton of
reading. I learned a lot and enjoyed
it. From what I've heard. I think it
was a better program, as it was more
substantial than I I luni." ( hen said.
Some feel that the pace in l-Hum
is still too last to adequately cover
all of the material.
â€¢The material is interesting, but
the wide scope of curriculum makes
it difficult to cover the works suffi
ciently," said freshman Colin
Miller.
()thers praised I I lum's breadth.
"I enjoy the class because it
broadens my horizons to new areas
of study." said freshman James
Muldrow.
Though the tension over aims
was a difficult obstacle to surmount.
Wolff said that I Hum represents a
definite improvement over ( IV.
"It definitely seems to be work
ing out." he said.
This year, freshmen have seven
autumn 1-1 luni autumn courses and
10 Winter-Spring sequences to

choose from.
Edam said the program is plan
ning further expansions.
"We are building off the old
courses and curriculum." he said.
"Hv next year, we hope to add three
to four more new classes."
"The goal with the new classes is
to find courses that bridge the gap
between science and humanities,"
1:1 am said.
At Stanford, where relatively
few freshmen are interested in the
humanities at first, many students
have expressed a belief that 1-1 lum
places an unnecessary burden on
their freshman schedule.
Freshman Mark Gebhard said.
"As an avowed 'techic.' I don't feel
the material is necessary to my field
of study."
Most students do seem to agree,
however, that l-Hum improves
upon problems with the CIV pro
gram. such as the lack of flexibility
that arose from ClV's three-quarter
structure.
In 1995 the Faculty Senate rec
ommended a review and reform of
CIV. which was a mandatory, year
long humanities course that satis
fied the Area One requirement for
freshmen.
After much debate, the l-Hum
program was adopted. The new
program for Area One was de
signed to pair a one quarter intro
ductory course in the autumn with a
two-quarter thematic sequence in
the winter and spring quarters.
According to the I-Hum guide,
the objective of the autumn courses
is to "hone skills in humanistic disci
plines through close reading and
critical investigation of a limited
number of works in preparation for
further study in humanities, and
specifically for any of the Winter-
Spring sequences."
