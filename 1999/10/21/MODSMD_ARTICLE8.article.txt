## Muslim leader wins presidency in Indonesia 
### 
JAKARTA. Indonesia (AP) —
A revered but frail Islamic party
leader won the first open presiden
tial election in Indonesia's troubled
history Wednesday, defeating the
popular daughter of the country's
founding father and setting off a
wave of violent protests bv her disil
lusioned supporters.
Abdurrahman Wahid comes to
power as Indonesia grapples with its
worst economic crisis in 30 years and
continuing communal and separatist
violence across this ethnically
diverse archipelago of 210 million
people. His election gives Islam
unprecedented influence in the
world's largest Muslim nation.
In the wake of the vote, gunshots
rang throughout the capital. Jakarta.
About 10,000 supporters of
Wahid's rival. Megawati Sukarnopu
tri, tried to march on Parliament,
throwing rocks and gasoline bombs
at police who stopped them with tear
gas and warning shots. The clashes
continued into the night before
protesters drifted away.
Gangs also roamed some streets
and tried to hijack cars. At least one
man was killed when a car exploded,
injuring IS. A separate homemade
bomb, in a 11 ower pot. injured five
people at the city's main traffic cir
cle. A third bomb went off harmless
ly in a street after Jakarta's huge
convention center was set on fire.
Inside the heavily guarded Parlia
ment, Wahid — who has suffered
two strokes, is nearly blind and can
barely walk — was supported by two
aides as he shuffled to a podium to
make his inaugural speech calling for
national unity.
Although Wahid. 59, heads
Indonesia's largest Muslim organiza
tion, he has long supported coopera
tion among faiths and continuing the
separation between religion and

government. Wahid, better known
by his nickname. Gus Dur. is regard
ed as a voice of tolerance and demo
cratic reform.
"It will be a heavy task to create a
peaceful and prosperous society in
the future," Wahid said in his first
speech as president.
Until Wednesday. Megawati, the
daughter of Indonesia's first presi
dent. had been regarded as the pres
idential frontrunner. I ler Indonesian
Democratic Party for Struggle won
34 percent of the vote in June elec
tions. more than any other party.
Wahid's National Awakening Party
won only 12 percent.
However. Megawati's candidacy
failed because some conservative
Muslims rejected the idea of a
female president and others claimed
she lacked the vision and political
savvy to build alliances with rivals.
Initially, Wahid supported her cam
paign but later decided to go it alone
after the two fell out over strategy.
During Wednesday's vote, thou
sands of Megawati's hopeful sup
porters clogged the streets. The
mood turned dark with news of her
defeat. Some cried; others resorted
to violence.
"The people wanted Mega. Now
there must be a revolution." said one
supporter, who identified himself
only as Ita.
In Washington. President Clinton
welcomed Indonesia's presidential
selection and the decision to end a
quarter-century of rule in East
Timor, where a multinational force
is trying to restore order after
paramilitary forces went tin a spree
of burning, looting and intimidation
throughout the territory last month.
" The events of the last two days
should give us all hope that a very
great country that the world needs
verv much is on the way back, and

that's what I'm hoping will happen."
Clinton said Wednesday.
With Wahid sworn in as Indone
sia's fourth head of state in 54 years
of independence, the focus turned to
whom the assembly v ill choose
Thursday as vice president. Officials
in Wahid's party say he may well
offer the office to Megawati, a cru
cial post if lie's can't fulfill his term.
Another possible choice is Akbar
Tanjung. leader of I labibie's (iolkar
Party, who reportedly made a deal to
support Wahid's presidential bid.
Military commander Gen.
Wiranto is also expected to run for
vice president. Wiranto would have
to resign as head of the armed forces
and defense minister if lie becomes
vice president, officials said.
Wahid has built a working rela
tionship with Wiranto in recent
months. While he has criticized the
military for human rights abuses, lie
also lias taken a conciliatory line
with the armed forces.

He has called lor phasing out
their involvement in politics, a pro
posal that falls short of student
protesters' demands for an immedi
ate ban. The military controls 38
seats in the assembly and has
pledged to support Wahid.
Wahid's election capped a dra
matic day of political maneuvering
that began when incumbent Presi
dent B.J. Habibie withdrew his can
didacy after the assembly essentially
censured him by rejecting a speech
he gave defending his 16-month rule.
Habibie instituted wide demo
crat ic reforms but was castigated for
Ins links to former President Suhar
to. who ruled for 32 and was forced
from office in May 1998.
I he country's financial markets
skyrocketed after Habibie dropped
out of the race, then fell sharply
when Wahid was elected. Some ana
lysts said they were concerned about
his poor health and lack of specific
economic policies.
