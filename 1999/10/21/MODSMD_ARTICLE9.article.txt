## President may again veto bill for ban 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Senate began an emotional debate
Wednesday on a bill that would ban
some late-term abortions, reopening
a volatile political issue and setting
the stage for another presidential
veto.
Democrats denounced the legis
lation as unconstitutional and
designed to boost GOP election
prospects at the expense of women.
"We all know ... this is the third
time the president will veto this bill,"
said its chief opponent, Sen. Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif. "Why go through
this if not for politics?"
Republicans shot back that they
were trying to protect fetuses from a
medical practice that brutalizes "the
most vulnerable members of our
society."
"This is about infanticide," said
Sen. Rick Santorum. R-Pa., chief
sponsor of the bill. "This is a baby
who is all but born and then killed."
The debate almost immediately
focused on the argument over the
definition of viable life and at which
point a fetus should be considered
born.
The procedure in question
involves the partial, feet-first deliv
ery of a fetus and the draining of its
skull contents.
Santorum's bill, the "Partial
Birth Abortion Act of 1999," would
make it a felony punishable by a fine
and / or a two-year prison term
unless it the procedure is "necessary
to save the lite of a mother whose
life is endangered by a physical dis
order. illness or injury." The mother
could not be prosecuted under the
measure.
Additionally, the legislation pro
vides for lawsuits against the physi
cian bv the father of the fetus and by
the mother's parents, in certain cir

cumstances.
Sen. Dick Durbin, D-111., pro
posed an alternative supported by
some Democrats and Republicans
that would not ban a specific abor
tion procedure. It would stop all
abortions after fetuses can survive
outside the womb except in cases
where doctors certify that a woman's
life was at risk or she faced "grievous
injury" to physical health. Similar
language has been defeated in the
past.
Republicans called the amend
ment a broadly worded attempt to
permit abortions in almost all cases,
since pregnancy can easily be con
sidered a threat to a woman's health.
The bill has little chance of
becoming law. Senior Senate
Republican aides who spoke on con
dition of anonymity acknowledged
that even if Santorum's bill passes, it
would probably fall short of the two
thirds majority required to override
Clinton's expected veto.
It has sparse support in the
courts. Thirty states have passed
late-term abortion bans, but lower
courts in two-thirds of those states
have struck down or prevented the
activation of those laws.
Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., planned to have a
final vote on the bill Thursday. But
angered by his decision to bring up
the legislation a few days shy of the
anniversary of the unsolved murder
of abortion provider Barnett Slepian
near Buffalo, N.Y., Democrats
threatened to extend debate into an
array of women's issues.
"We could be on this bill for a
couple of weeks," said Sen. Demo
cratic leader Torn Daschle of South
Dakota, a time frame that would
take it well beyond current plans to
wind up the session for the vear.
