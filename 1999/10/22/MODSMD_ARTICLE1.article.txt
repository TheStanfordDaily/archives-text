### Scott Dorfman Contributing writer 
A first-hand account of the horror
of anti-Semitism in Nii/i Germany
was given at the Stanford Bookstore
yesterday, as Nazi resistance fighter
Ciad Beck discussed his new book,
"An Underground Life: Memoirs of
a Gay Jew in Nazi Berlin."
The 90-minute talk highlighted

much of the suffering Beck experi
enced as a Jewish homosexual living
in Germany during World W;ir 11.
Beck also discussed the numerous in
dividuals. both gay and straight. Jew
ish and Christian, who aided him in
his resistance efforts.
Before Hitler came to power.
Beck described his life as "a very
happy time. My father was rich, and
we were satisfied. I was in the college

track high school, and I sang in the
chorus and played the violin."
However, after 1933. Beck soon
began to feel much more isolated,
and his status as the only Jew in his
high school made him an outcast.
"I was pulled away from all the
other kids in the schoolyard one day.

their arms in a salute to the Nazi
Hag." Beck said.
Beck shared many other instances
of enduring Nazi intolerance in the
pre-war period. I le recalled being
forbidden to stand on the winner's
podium after finishing first in a track
meet and the experience of finding
the men's clothing shop he worked at
filled with "piles of human (feces]."
Beck went on to describe the out
break of the war, during which his
family was forced to work for "slave
wages" — often less than 4 cents an
hour — at large firms such as
Siemens.
After Beck's boyfriend and other
friends were sent awav to "the East,"
a euphemism for death camps such as
Auschwitz, he determined lie "had to
fight" the Nazis. I le formed an un
derground resistance network of
Jewish families living in Berlin.
"Living underground means you
have absolutely nothing," Beck said.
"No name, no identity and no
money."
Beck maintained a list in his head
of the names and addresses of all
Jewish families involved in the un
derground resistance effort.
"We would hold meetings every
morning during the allied bombing,"
Beck said, "in order to make sure
each family's housing had not been

destroyed the previous night."
Beck recounted stories of two in
dividuals living in Berlin during the
war. The stories contrasted the cow
ardice exhibited by some people and
the courage of others.
Beck's first story concerned a
Jewish girl named Stella, who gave
information to the Gestapo about
the whereabouts of Jewish families
involved in the resistance effort.
"Stella and her friends," said Beck,
"were responsible for turning over at
least 300 Jewish families to the
Gestapo."
To contrast the story of Stella,
Beck relayed a story about Frauline
Schmidt, a prostitute told by German
military authorities that she was "too
old" to service German soldiers. In
retaliation, Schmidt determined to
aid the Jewish cause, and she "imme
diately alerted 13 families that the
Gestapo had obtained a list of their
addresses, saving the lives of 36 peo
ple," Beck said.
Beck closed his speech with the
Jewish Russian soldier who set him
free.
"He asked aloud in Yiddish 'Is
there anyone here named Gad
Beck?' the first time I had heard my
real name since the beginning of the
war," Beck said. "1 raised my hand
and the soldier then said. 'Brother,
you are free!'"
"An Underground Life" is now
available in hardcover at the Book
store.
