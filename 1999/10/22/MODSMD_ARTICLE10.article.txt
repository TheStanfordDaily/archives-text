# Students offer open hands and friendship to homeless
## Program reaches out to those on street 
### Nathaniel Tulloch 
Recently some Stanford students have been
spending their nights in the street. They are part
of a new student organization called Night Out
reach, which is trying to build bonds between
students and the Palo Alto homeless.
Unlike the now-defunct Stanford Homeless
Advocacy Coalition, Night Outreach concen
trates on personal interaction with the homeless
rather than on the political issues affecting
them.
"We work to build friendships, listen to prob
lems and offer respect [to the homeless of Palo
Alto]," said junior Dorcas ('lieng. the organiza
tion's president.
The group also tries to provide food, soap,
shampoo and razors when they have sufficient
supplies. Having recently gained official Uni
versity organization status. Night Outreach is
now applying for ASSU funds to expand its sup
plies program.

The group, currently about 15 members,
sends out two to three volunteers each night to
walk University Avenue for about two hours.
The volunteers give away what supplies they
have and talk with the people residing on the
street. They have been interacting with 15 to 20
homeless a night this month, up from last year's
norm of five to 10.
The Night Outreach program was started last
spring by sophmore Angela Kang, but was the
vision of Dona Smith-Powers, Director of Faith,
Community and Volunteer Services at Urban
Ministries. Urban Ministries of Palo Alto is a
nonprofit organization that serves meals to the
homeless.
This year Night Outreach is setting off on its
own as an on-campus Stanford organization. It
is in search of additional volunteers and it is
planning an orientation meeting sometime
soon. The group is also hoping to invite guest
speakers such as Jim Burklo from the United
Campus Christian Ministry (formerly from

Urban Ministries) to talk about the program,
the Palo Alto Poliee Department to talk about
safety, and perhaps others to talk on ways to
make a friendly connection.
The future goals of Night Outreach include
obtaining food donations from area restaurants
and donations of rain gear and / or blankets as
the winter approaches.
The group hopes, as well, to eventually have
enough members to expand the Outreach range
not only to the University Avenue side streets
but also along California Avenue.
"I feel that they appreciate us." said Cheng,
when asked if she thinks that Night Outreach is
making a difference. " Their faces just light up
when they see us."
To get involved in any area of the program,
interested students and faculty should e-mail
Dorcas ( heng at dcheng@stanford.edu.
"We are developing trusting relationships
between the Stanford students and the un
housed community of Palo Alto," Kang added.
