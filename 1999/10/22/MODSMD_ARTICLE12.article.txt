GROZNY, Russia (AP) â€”
Salvos of rockets slammed into a
crowded open air market and other
parts of Grozny, including a mater
nity hospital, yesterday, killing at
least 1 IK people and injuring up to
400, a Chechen official said.
Chechen officials said the rock
ets were fired by Russian forces
moving in on the capital. The Rus
sian Defense Ministry in Moscow
denied responsibility.
Bodies, severed body parts and
pools of blood were scattered
throughout the market after six
rockets exploded in the stalls,
which were crowded with shoppers
during the early evening attack.

At least four other rockets
slammed into other parts of the
city, including one that hit a mater
nity hospital. Magomed Mago
madov, a senior government offi
cial. said.
He said I IS people were killed
and between 300 and 400 people
were injured. Many of the injured
were in critical condition, he said.
Russian forces moved in to
Chechnya in late September to
impose a security zone around the
breakaway republic and to wipe
out Islamic militants. Russian
forces were devastated by street
lighting with guerrillas in the capi
tal during the 1994-% war. which

left Chechnya with de facto inde
pendence.
At the market yesterday, hun
dreds of terrified people, many
screaming and crying, ran for cover
as the rockets exploded. Surround
ing streets were jammed with peo
ple trying to escape. Some onlook
ers tried to help the wounded.
"It was dark and then all of a
sudden, the place was illuminated
and something was sparkling in the
air. Then we heard the explosions,"
said Umar Madayev.
Grozny's already overcrowded
and poorly equipped hospitals
were packed with the injured. A
few doctors, working with almost

no medications, operated on some
of the wounded under the glare of
kerosene lamps because the elec
tricity was out.
Badly wounded people lay in
pools of blood in the dirty, dark
corridors of the central hospital,
where there were no beds for them.
Russian troops meanwhile
closed in on the Chechen capital,
with advance tanks and armored
personnel carriers reportedly less
than eight miles outside Grozny.
Chechen officials said some Rus
sian soldiers had been spotted even
closer.
Russia sent troops back into
Chechnya at the end of September.

following weeks of airstrikes to
eliminate Islamic militants who
invaded neighboring Dagestan this
summer. The militants have also
been blamed for a series of
September apartment explosions
in Russia that killed some 300 peo
ple. although Chechen warlords
have denied responsibility for the
blasts.
Witnesses told The Associated
Press that they saw Russian war
planes drop bombs that exploded
around the city's clothing market.
Hut the Interfax news agency
quoted Chechen armed forces
operations chief Mumadi Saidayev
as saying that five Russian surface

to-surface missiles hit the market
area.
Russian military leaders have
sent mixed signals about whether
they intend to send troops into
Gro/ny.
Grozny might he attacked, but
only it it helps achieve the larger
goal of eliminating Chechen mili
tants. Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said, according to Inter
fax.
Sergeyev's deputy. Gen.
Vladimir Toporov. struck a slightly
different note, saying, "sooner or
later, the troops will enter Grozny.
If not troops, then the (Russian)
authorities will."
