Issues of ethnicity

THREE CHEERS to Hoover
Fellow Dinesh D'Souza for at
least attempting to revive the
ever-controversial subject of multi
culturalism the other day. D'Sou/a s
witty one-liners and carefully rea
soned arguments aside, I'm still
unconvinced by his arguments
against affirmative action and that
we've reached the "end of racism." as
he would put it. Hopefully, however,
he will provoke some well-needed
debate on this campus.
As a young and impressionable
freshman I still remember watching
D'Souza as he debated — and sound
ly defeated — the venerable elder
statesman of civil rights, Jesse Jack
son, jlist a few weeks before the vote
on Prop. 2(W (the California Civil
Rights Initiative).
Now a senior, I lament the fact that
we rarely ever see public debates or
discussions on these types of issues
anymore. Race, ethnicity, diversity
and multiculturalism are all issues
that have broad implications for this
University (and ultimately our lives)
and I'm afraid that we have done
very little to address them beyond
anything more than a superficial
level.
lake the concept of employing
affirmative action in the process of
faculty hiring and the granting of
tenure. Those who support such a
policy point it) the low level of
minorities 111 tenure track positions.
I'he University, on the other hand,
while committed to affirmative action
in hiring, seems unwilling to intro
duce that into the tenure process. For

an issue as crucial as this affecting our
campus, there has been little public
discussion.
Even if this is a matter to be decid
ed by the administration, there
should be some input from the Uni
versity at large. This is not something
to be decided by the courts or the
administration by themselves.
When we do have a discussion
about race or ethnicity on this cam
pus it seems to lack any real com
plexity. Last spring, a well-inten
tioned group called Leadership 2000
constructed a wall in White Plaza
where students could write their
responses to questions posed about
ethnicity.
A common answer was to wish
the problem away. "Wouldn't it be
wonderful if we lived in a color-blind
society?" wrote some of the respon
dents. Another writer attacked the
presence of ethnic community cen
ters and student organizations on
campus, citing them as bastions of
segregation.
While the hope of a color-blind
society may be a dream for some, it
does little to address the reality of
those who are confronted with the
issue of race day in and day out, even
at Stanford.
As for the ethnic centers and stu
dent groups, they maybe a by-prod
uct of the problem rather than a
cause.
I his discussion, carried out on a
board, should have been continued in
the dorms.
While there is so much exposure to
the issues surrounding diversity in a
student's first few weeks on this cam
pus. there is not enough when it mat
ters later 011 in college life.
