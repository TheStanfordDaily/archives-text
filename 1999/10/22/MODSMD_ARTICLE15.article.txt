Science does not truly mea
sure 44 progress."
In m\ view, ;iikl that of the humanistic
colleagues whom I consulted, the
announcement of the talk on "Realism vs.
Pragmatism" (the first in the Dept. of Com
parative literature's I all Lecture series]
represents a skewed perspective on the
basic issue before lis.
I lie flier refers to "scientific theories"
and a "fiercely authoritative father-figure"
who underpins scientific claims to truth or
objective Reality, which may constitute "an
advance toward a more mature self-reliant
view of our relation to the universe."
Although this is presented as an open
question for debate, we know where our

speaker stands and we see his bias in the
framing of the issue, which should be about
life as a whole, not just science or pragmat
ic doings. Science relies heavily on rational
ity. linear and progressive mindsets, mea
surement. analysis, fragmentation, calcula
tion, digitation and in sum. Jakobson's
"metonomy." Hut you can't measure a
human life or great work of art or even the
most ordinarly spontaneous daily experi
ence.
By the same token, our deepest sense of
Reality is based not on a lather figure but
on a sacred fountainhead of life preceding
this obviously anthromorphic and male
dominated construct which goes with a
male priesthood, largely male science and
technology and the whole secular realm of

the busy-body and dynamic and pragmatic.
Profoundly honest creators dealing with
life as a whole from Goethe through Mal
larme, Proust, Joyce and Camus have put
the mother at the core of their universe,
despite their awareness that originally
there was no gender, a fact borne out by
modern biology.
But anthropology documents the
immemorial power of the birth-giver in.for
example, the primitive ritual of the cou
vade. The writers, in worshipping the
mother, arc atoning for their macho striv
ing. like the old doctor in Bergmann's
"Wild Strawberries" and all the preten
tions of male-dominated mind and will
since the advent of the symbolic "subtle
serpeant" in Eden.

Mankind generally has a lot to atone for
in the way of macho bungling, especially in
this rotten century of "progress" toward
World War I, the Gulag and Auschwitz
(granting some genuine advances in mod
ern medicine, etc.) Feminine sociability.
Edenic sense of becoming, intuition and
wisdom are sorely needed. The crushingly
prganiatic, money-minded, careerist, tech
nical and scientific bent of our era goes with
an alarming decline in civilization, visible
all around in the raw children and graceless
male-imitating women as well as uninspired
and clueless hordes of modern males, glued
to their computers and market reports.
