## Reflecting on a real suburbia 
### 
Travis Kopp

AS I SAID LAST
week, 1 spent the
good majority of
last year in my hometown.
I happen to he from Den
ver— actually Littleton
the now world-infamous
home of deranged pipe

bomb-making high school students.
It was interesting to be there at the time
of the shooting. That single event captivat
ed the psyche of the entire city for a good
five months. The big question everyone had
apparently was "Why did this happen?," a
question I don't quite understand. "Why
does anything happen?," "Who knows?" If
anything, it seems to me that the shooting
was easier to explain than most other things
that happen. Two boys felt oppressed and
offended by some other boys, so they decid
ed to kill them. That's the way young men
are supposed to act, right? There are exam
ples of it throughout history. Look at the
Trojan W;ir: one guy steals another guy's
girlfriend, so they each get a bunch of their
friends together to kill one another. Untold
numbers of wars were started by a person
feeling oppressed or offended by someone
else and deciding to kill him. It's entirely
natural and. yet. in the particular case of
Littleton, we are told, it was horrifically out
of place.
I think what was so disturbing was not
that it was inexplicable, but that it was so

real. I was fascinated by the story, myself.
Many people are quick to point out that
people are being slaughtered everyday in
Eastern Europe and Asia and other places
I've never been. But there is something
altogether shocking about the thought that
this happened at Columbine, exactly the
kind of place I've spent all of my life. At 1 1
in the morning, while 1 was taking a shower
or maybe eating cereal (I woke up late that
day), and while people were buying lattes at
Starbuck's within half a mile, these two boys
walked into .in upper-middle-class high
school, permeated with pep rallies and
prom and everything else, with trench coats
and AK47s and coldly took out 40-some
people amid screams and blaring fire
alarms. It's mind-boggling — like a movie
or a video game, and yet it is exactly what
happened. It is precisely real.
Suburbia is supposed to be "safe." It rep
resents some eternal norm buffered from
the chaos of reality. Thus it seems incredible
that in this space of controlled non-events,
these two boys quite literally made history.
After Columbine and other similar shoot
ings, it is becoming increasingly apparent
that it is impossible to escape real life even
in suburbia. And I think people are realiz
ing this. Even popular culture is beginning
to play with the idea. For example. 1 saw
"American Beauty" a lew weeks ago. In
that film, among other things, a middle
aged man in suburbia with an absurd mid

die class job falls in love with his high school
daughter's friend and eventually gets her to
agree to sleep with him. Does that fit the
framework of possibilities of suburbia? No.
Is it real? Conceivably.
I mentioned that the popular question to
ask about Columbine was "Why?" The
implication being: "Why was this allowed to
happen?" As though there were some sys
tem responsible for molding everyone and
everything into forms which follow the pre
cise laws of reality under which people want
to live. This is the notion that people have
of suburbia: that it safeguards reality. But in
the end there is no omnipotent system. Peo
ple are forever undeniably free agents.
Those two boys alone are responsible for
what happened, because they did it. They
were still able to. As John Lennon and Paul
McCartney said, "There's nothing you can
do that can't be done."
The point of this all. I think, is that life is
cra/y weird. There's nothing inherently
stopping a madman from shooting you in
the back of the head tomorrow at lunch.
There's an amazing freedom in every
moment, and if you forget that forever, then
(as many have feared) when you come to
die you may find that you have not lived.
