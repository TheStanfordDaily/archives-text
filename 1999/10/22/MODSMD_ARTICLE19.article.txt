A RECENT ARTICLE in The Daily
highlighted the Stanford Cycling
C luh tor teaching bicycle safety to
elementary school children. I applaud them
lor recognizing the importance of educating
youth about bicycle safety. However, after
several years of witnessing accidents and
near-accidents here on campus. I'd surmise
that, generally, the student population of
Stanford needs to take a course in bicycle
safety as well. As someone who never regu
larly biked until I came to Stanford. I am well
aware that lew of us really know what is
meant by being a responsible and safe cyclist.
Before someone can legally get behind
the wheel ot a car. states require that drivers
educate themselves about the rules of the
road, learning such practical information as
who turns first at a stop sign and learning
how to handle a car when one gets caught on
an ice patch. Admittedly, often what is
learned in Driver's Education gets thrown
out the window once one gets behind the
wheel; to which anyone who has waited at
the intersections of Campus and Palm Drives

can attest. However, many accidents can be
prevented when people follow the major
guidelines for safe driving. I've begun to
wonder why there isn't a similar emphasis on
bicycle safety, especially on college campuses
where cycling is the main method of trans
portation.
Cyclists aren't the only parties involved in
bike safety, however. I'm sure I'm not the
only one who has experienced the chaotic
mass of cyclists and pedestrians during "rush
hours" by the Main Quad and White Plaza.
I've almost run down numerous pedestrians
as they've jumped in front of me at the last
minute. I've felt the frustrations of having to
come to a complete hall behind a four-per
son-wide lane of friends blocking the path
ways. Even more dangerous are the streets,
where drivers often seem oblivious to
cyclists, particularly at intersections. After
recently witnessing the aftermath of a car
and bike accident. I am increasingly con
cerned about promoting bicycle safety and
awareness on campus.
Well, welcome to mv Bicycle Safety 101:

1. Wear a helmet. Admittedly, I never
wear a helmet. My logie tends to rest on the
idea that I never frequent areas of high traf
fic, so I'm relatively safe without one. Fash
ion-wise, I also have the kind of hair that
tends to mold to whatever shape in which it's
contained. Last time 1 checked, helmet head
still wasn't in style. However. I still encour
age you to wear a helmet when you hike,
especially when you travel near any busy
streets such as El Camino. It literally can save
your life if you do get into an accident.
2. Pretend that hikes are cars. It sounds
ridiculous to pretend your Diamondback
Parkway is a Toyota 4-Runner for many rea
sons. but for safety purposes. I think it is a
good idea to do so while you're on the road.
In the first place, cyclists must follow similar
traffic rules as cars when they are on roads:
halt at a red light and stop sign, signal to turn
and follow the chain of command at intersec
tions. In addition, if drivers treat cyclists as
fellow drivers, I predict there will be less
near-hits and drivers and cyclists will com
municate more while on the road.

3. Drive on the right, pass on the left.
Relating to rule No. 2, just as when I'm driv
ing. I ride my bike on the right side of a path,
then I pass on the left. Trouble occurs when
everyone else on the path is totally oblivious
to my traffic rules. One particular incident
comes to mind where I went to pass on the
left and the driver going opposite me passed
on his right, meaning he rammed right into
my wheel, bending it in half. I recognize the
large population of international students at
Stanford may instinctually want to do the
opposite, but 1 hope we all can agree on a
protocol for cycling.
4. Don't be an idiot. Simply put. even at a
university lull of some of the most brilliant
people in the world, there are going to be
idiots. There will be Macho Idiot, who thinks
riding his bike with no hands is the ultimate
test of being "cool" until he fumbles to stop
when a car jumps out in front of him. There
will be "In-a-llurrv" Idiot, who attempts to
pass everyone in one full swoop, driving on
the wrong side of Escondido Road and get
ting in the way of everyone else going in the

opposite direction. And I'm sure you have
seen those cyclists smoking their cigarettes,
talking on a cell phone and the latest — try
ing to hold hands with their loved one, also
on bike. The best advice I can give is to stay
as far away from these accidents-waiting-to
happen, and to not become one yourself.
5. Be prepared, be safe and have fun. My
most important rule for biking is to be pre
pared. Keep your tires full, and test your
brakes before stepping to the pedal. Make
sure your bike is fitted to your height. Ride at
a speed where you feel in total control, and
use a light for night riding. Always keep
aware, so you'll be ready to make those split
second decisions. And finally, have fun!
Cycling, when it's done right, can be great
exercise and an enjoyable, easy way to get
wherever you need to go.

she realizes that walking is immensely slower
than hiking. Is anyone trying to sell a scooter?

pass everyone in one full swoop, driving on
the wrong side of Escondido Road and get
ting in the way of everyone else going in the

opposite direction. And I'm sure you have
seen those cyclists smoking their cigarettes,
talking on a cell phone and the latest — try
ing to hold hands with their loved one, also
on bike. The best advice I can give is to stay
as far away from these accidents-waiting-to
happen, and to not become one yourself.
5. Be prepared, be safe and have fun. My
most important rule for biking is to be pre
pared. Keep your tires full, and test your
brakes before stepping to the pedal. Make
sure your bike is fitted to your height. Ride at
a speed where you feel in total control, and
use a light for night riding. Always keep
aware, so you'll be ready to make those split
second decisions. And finally, have fun!
Cycling, when it's done right, can be great
exercise and an enjoyable, easy way to get
wherever you need to go.
