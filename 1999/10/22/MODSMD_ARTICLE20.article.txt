### Erin Bouchier Staff writer 
Turning for a moment from the
action in deGuerre pool Wednesday
afternoon, Stanford men's water
polo coach Dante Dettamanti
smiled.
"It's a big weekend," he said.
Big is an understatement.

MEN'S WATER POLO
■ Tomorrow: No. 3 Stanford (12-2.
2-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) at No. 1 USC (14-1,3-0).
■ Sunday: Stanford at No. 4 Long
Beach State (8-9, 1-3).

This weekend. No. 3 Stanford
(12-2, 2-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) embarks on the season's
toughest road trip as the squad trav
els south to take on No. 1 USC (14-1,
3-0) and No. 4 Long Beach State (8-
9, 1-3) in two important league
games.
Stanford stands third in the
league with a 2-1 record, just one
game behind UCLA and USC. both
of whom are undefeated in confer
ence play.
The Cardinal renews its very
heated rivalry with the top-ranked
Trojans on Saturday. The two teams
are so evenly matched that their last
four meetings have gone into over
time, with each team claiming two
victories.
Last season. Stanford won the
first overtime game, 7-6, in the semi
finals of the MPSF tournament. Two
weeks later, the Trojans avenged
that loss, beating the Cardinal in the

NCAA Championship match 9-8.
This season, Stanford again took
the first overtime victory, overcom
ing USC, 11-10, in the Trojans' home
pool in the SoCal Tournament final
and claiming the nation's No. 1 rank
ing. In the NorCal Tournament at
deGuerre three weeks later, the Tro
jans beat the Cardinal 12-10 on their
way to retaking the No. 1 spot.
So. it will come as little surprise if
Saturday's game takes a little longer
than the standard four quarters.
The Trojans are led by senior
Allen Basso, who has 36 points on
the season, topping the MPSF. Basso
played particularly well in the Tro
jans' win over the Cardinal at the
NorCal tournament, scoring the
final two-pointer that lifted USC to
the win.
"We need to take away their two
point shots on Saturday. Two-point
shots really killed us in that game,"
Dettamanti said.
The Cardinal plans to shut down
Trojan scoring by playing a pressing
defense.
"If we press them, we can take
away most of their shots." Detta
manti said.
Stanford will also need to focus
on its man-down defense.
"Where USC is really good is on
the counterattack and on the 6-on-5.
They're the best in the country on 6-
on-5," Dettamanti said. Further
more, the heavily European squad
uses a lot of trick plays not usually
seen in U.S. water polo.
Stanford players will have to be
disciplined and hold their positions
