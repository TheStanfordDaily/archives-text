## Polo embarks on critical road trip 
### Erin Bouchier Staff writer 
Turning for a moment from the
action in deGuerre pool Wednesday
afternoon, Stanford men's water
polo coach Dante Dettamanti
smiled.
"It's a big weekend," he said.
Big is an understatement.

MEN'S WATER POLO
■ Tomorrow: No. 3 Stanford (12-2.
2-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) at No. 1 USC (14-1,3-0).
■ Sunday: Stanford at No. 4 Long
Beach State (8-9, 1-3).

This weekend. No. 3 Stanford
(12-2, 2-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) embarks on the season's
toughest road trip as the squad trav
els south to take on No. 1 USC (14-1,
3-0) and No. 4 Long Beach State (8-
9, 1-3) in two important league
games.
Stanford stands third in the
league with a 2-1 record, just one
game behind UCLA and USC. both
of whom are undefeated in confer
ence play.
The Cardinal renews its very
heated rivalry with the top-ranked
Trojans on Saturday. The two teams
are so evenly matched that their last
four meetings have gone into over
time, with each team claiming two
victories.
Last season. Stanford won the
first overtime game, 7-6, in the semi
finals of the MPSF tournament. Two
weeks later, the Trojans avenged
that loss, beating the Cardinal in the

NCAA Championship match 9-8.
This season, Stanford again took
the first overtime victory, overcom
ing USC, 11-10, in the Trojans' home
pool in the SoCal Tournament final
and claiming the nation's No. 1 rank
ing. In the NorCal Tournament at
deGuerre three weeks later, the Tro
jans beat the Cardinal 12-10 on their
way to retaking the No. 1 spot.
So. it will come as little surprise if
Saturday's game takes a little longer
than the standard four quarters.
The Trojans are led by senior
Allen Basso, who has 36 points on
the season, topping the MPSF. Basso
played particularly well in the Tro
jans' win over the Cardinal at the
NorCal tournament, scoring the
final two-pointer that lifted USC to
the win.
"We need to take away their two
point shots on Saturday. Two-point
shots really killed us in that game,"
Dettamanti said.
The Cardinal plans to shut down
Trojan scoring by playing a pressing
defense.
"If we press them, we can take
away most of their shots." Detta
manti said.
Stanford will also need to focus
on its man-down defense.
"Where USC is really good is on
the counterattack and on the 6-on-5.
They're the best in the country on 6-
on-5," Dettamanti said. Further
more, the heavily European squad
uses a lot of trick plays not usually
seen in U.S. water polo.
Stanford players will have to be
disciplined and hold their positions
against the Trojans' 6-on-5 to shut
them down and prevent scores off
the trick plays.
On offense. Dettamanti said the
team "will be a little better prepared
for their defense. We basically know
what they're going to do. and we've
been practicing for that all week."
Stanford will have to shoot well to
get any goals past IJSC goalie
Richard McEvoy, who leads the
league with 141 saves in 15 games.
However, the Trojans will like
wise have a lough time scoring
against Stanford's goalie, redshirt
freshman Nick 1 His. who is second in
the MPSF with I IS saves in 14
games.
On Sunday, the Cardinal takes on
the 4 c )ers of Long Beach State. Like
Stanford, Long Beach will be a bit
tired after a Saturday match with No.
6 University of the Pacific.
While Long Beach is ranked No.
4. "they can beat anyone in the top
four or they can lose to anyone

ranked below them" according to
Dettamanti. For example, they lost
to No. <•) UC Irvine just last Tuesday.
"We just don't know which team
is going to show up," Dettamanti
said. "But if they get hot and start
scoring from the outside, we're going
to have a tough game."
Long Beach certainly has players
capable of scoring from outside. The
49ers have some great shooters in
Corey Dolley. Patrick Cochran,
Chris Segesman and Shane Lind
strom. who all rank in the top 10 in
scoring in the MPSF. I lowever. after
those four, "they have virtually no
body [scoring)." Dettamanti said.
The Cardinal, on the other hand,
has a very balanced scoring attack.
While senior Brian I lei Heron leads
the team with 25 points, good for
ninth in the MPSF. eight players
have 10 points or more, including the
only two true freshmen. Jeff Ne
smith and Peter 1 ludnut.
As the C "ardinal heads into one of
the season's toughest weekends, it
will look for contributions from each
player so that the team is running on
all cylinders.

and will hope to continue his ways this weekend as the Cardinal take

On Sunday, the Cardinal takes on
the 4 c )ers of Long Beach State. Like
Stanford, Long Beach will be a bit
tired after a Saturday match with No.
6 University of the Pacific.
While Long Beach is ranked No.
4. "they can beat anyone in the top
four or they can lose to anyone

ranked below them" according to
Dettamanti. For example, they lost
to No. <•) UC Irvine just last Tuesday.
"We just don't know which team
is going to show up," Dettamanti
said. "But if they get hot and start
scoring from the outside, we're going
to have a tough game."
Long Beach certainly has players
capable of scoring from outside. The
49ers have some great shooters in
Corey Dolley. Patrick Cochran,
Chris Segesman and Shane Lind
strom. who all rank in the top 10 in
scoring in the MPSF. I lowever. after
those four, "they have virtually no
body [scoring)." Dettamanti said.
The Cardinal, on the other hand,
has a very balanced scoring attack.
While senior Brian I lei Heron leads
the team with 25 points, good for
ninth in the MPSF. eight players
have 10 points or more, including the
only two true freshmen. Jeff Ne
smith and Peter 1 ludnut.
As the C "ardinal heads into one of
the season's toughest weekends, it
will look for contributions from each
player so that the team is running on
all cylinders.

Cocking his arm back, senior Sean Joy prepares to let the ball fly at
the UC-Davis Aggies. Joy had a career high four goals last Saturday,
and will hope to continue his ways this weekend as the Cardinal take
on the No. 1 USC Trojans.
