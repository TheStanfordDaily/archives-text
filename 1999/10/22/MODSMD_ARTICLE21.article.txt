### Tim Kane Contributing writer 
In describing Stanford's football
season so far, one could make use ot
nearly every adjective and sports
cliche in the book. Week in and week
out, the Cardinal fluctuates from one
extreme to the other, leaving its fans
da/ed and confused.

FOOTBALL

It's time for Cardinal to show
what it really is.
Is it the powerful offensive jug
gernaut and solid defensive unit that
dispatched two conference fa
vorites?
Or is it the confused, vulnerable
squad that got blasted in I'exas and
humiliated at home by San Jose
State?
Tomorrow at the University of
Southern California (3-3, 1-2 Pacific
10Conference), the Cardinal (4-2.4-
0) take on the Trojans in the first
game of a three-game road trip, all
against conference opponents. Stan
ford hits the road for the first time
since its impressive victory at Ari
zona a month ago. looking to build
on their strong defensive perfor
mance versus Oregon State, while
hopefulb regaining some of the
rhythm the offense seems to have
lost in previous weeks. I 'S('. mean
while. will be looking to forget their

second-half collapse at Notre Dame,
a game they eventually lost 25-24.
" I hey have overall great talent."
said Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham. "and we have great re
spect for their coaching. You look at
|the first half against Notre Dame
last Saturday| and you say. wow. this
football team can really get after it
and really dominate."
Fortunately for the Cardinal.
I'S( "s starting quarterback, sopho
more Carson Palmer, is out with a

broken collarbone, leaving junior
Mike Van Raaphorst to face the
shaky Stanford secondary. Van
Raaphorst's primary target is the
Trojans' most explosive player, se
nior wideout R. Jay Soward. who is
coming off an impressive perfor
mance in South Bend. Soward
caught 10 passes for 101 yards and
one touchdown while gaining 82 ad
ditional yards on runs, punts and
kick returns.
()f course. Stanford is no slouch

when it comes to explosiveness.
Even though he missed part of the
Oregon State game and practice this
week due to illness and assorted in
juries. senior Hanker Troy Walters
looks to be ready for Saturday's
game. Senior Deßonnie Pitts will
line up opposite Walters and should
cause trouble for the Trojans' pass
defense, which is ranked sixth in the
conference. Pitts is coming off a big

game last week, stepping up during
Walters' absence in the second half
last Saturday and catching eight balls
for 123 yards and a touchdown pass.
USC head coach Paul Hackett is
well aware of Stanford's receiving
prowess. "When you think Stanford,
you think offense and you certainly
do that with receivers Walters and
Pitts. They've been sensational. They
have beaten everyone they've gone
against. I think the toughest thing
about those guys is you can't double
one of them because the other one
will kill you."
Sophomore running back Brian
Allen, who saved Stanford with two
touchdown runs in the fourth quarter
against Oregon State, looks to get
more carries this week. Willingham
alluded to this in his weekly press
conference, saying, "There may be a
change in the rotation there. We'll go
through the week and look and see
how that plays out. But the plav of
our backs has been, I think, solid and
good. Brian went in early and had a
couple of nice runs and later in the
ballgame came back [and got hot]."

Meanwhile, on the defensive side.
Stanford junior Willie Howard will
play after hyperextending his elbow
and cramping up last weekend.
Howard's presence is essential it the
Cardinal is to continue stopping the
run as it did against Oregon State, al
though USC's running game is
ranked ninth in the conference.
Third-string quarterback Randy
Fasani might make his defensive
debut at linebacker for the Cardinal
this week after convincing Willing
ham to let him make the move. As
suming he plays, Fasani will give
Stanford another athletic option in
the linebacking core, backing up
Riall Johnson. Sharcus Steen and
Marc Stockbauer.
Currently, Stanford leads the Pac
-10 with a 4-0 record and a 1.5 game
lead on four teams that are lied for
second place. With four conference
games left, the Cardinal's fate is still
up in the air. To remain atop the con
ference. Stanford must win at least
two of the next three road games.
This is not an easy task, given that
Stanford hasn't won in Los Angeles
since 1991 and at Washington since
1975.
Who are the Stanford Cardinal?
We'll find out this Saturday.
