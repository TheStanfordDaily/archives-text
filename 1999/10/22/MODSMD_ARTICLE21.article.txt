It's time for Cardinal to show
what it really is.
Is it the powerful offensive jug
gernaut and solid defensive unit that

Or is it the confused, vulnerable
squad that got blasted in I'exas and

one touchdown while gaining 82 ad
ditional yards on runs, punts and
kick returns.
()f course. Stanford is no slouch

when it comes to explosiveness.
