The three teams were the presea
son conference favorites and, now.
USC (11-3, 4-0 Pac-10) and Stan
ford (11-3, 4-0) lead the competi
tion, while UCLA (11-3-1, 3-0-1)
ranks second in the conference after
its tie against Washington on Sun
day.
Although the games this week
end will not determine a Pac-10
champion, the outcomes will likely
serve as a harbinger of things to
come and, at the very least, an indi
cation of the strength of the confer
ence.

this weekend in critical matches against UCLA and USC.
said head coach Steve Swanson.
"Right now. we are preparing care
fully tor UCLA and then USC on
Sunday. We want to he rested and
ready, and I am very confident that
we will he."
Stanford will enter the weekend
with a lot in its favor. Coming off of a
seven-game winning streak on the
road, the Cardinal returns to the fa
miliarity of a home field and the com
fort of a home crowd.
"The nice thing for us is to be at
home," Swanson said. "It is hard to
play on the road in the Pac-IO he
cause there arc so many more factors
involved."
However, the six consecutive
weeks the ( 'ardinal has played (>n the
road has worked to the team's ad
vantage in some regards. It has tested
the strength of the team under vari
ous conditions and against teams that
play with different styles.
"We've learned a lot," Swanson
said. "We know we can come back
from behind to win and that we can
win on the road. Every team has to
know that."
The Cardinal will, nonetheless,
continue to face some stiff competi
tion at home. In their last two en
counters. the Bruins and the Trojans

have both defeated the Cardinal.
"They are definitely solid teams."
said senior co-captain Jennifer
O'Sullivan. who will return to the
Cardinal lineup tonight after sitting
out last week's game for a leg injury.
"We have to be ready to play hard
and to work hard in order to win."
IJCLA, the two-time defending
conference champion, will fight to
defend its title by threatening the
Cardinal with a strong forward line.
I'he Bruins lead the Pac-10 in team
points, with 41 goals and 30 assists.
Forward Jessica Winton leads the
team's scoring campaign with nine
goals and three assists, ranking third
in the conference's individual points
race.
" They do have some good for
wards. but we try to look at them as
an entire team," O'Sullivan said.
"We don't specifically mark any
players harder than the others. All of
ns play hard against every one of
their players."
(Jffensively, USC' is just as strong.
A deep, experienced squad, the Tro
jans boast two-time All-Americans,
Isabelle I larvey and Kim ( lark. I lar
vey competed for the Canadian na
tional team this summer in the
Women's World ( up.
In addition to these two stand
outs, I JS( "s leaders in points are two
newcomers, freshmen Ali l ennell
and Jennifer I'rigmorc.
