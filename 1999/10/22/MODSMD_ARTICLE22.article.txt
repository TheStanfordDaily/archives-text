### Lori Maund Contributing writer 
Three of the 10 teams in the Pa
cific 10 Conference are undefeated.
Two of them are coming to Stanford
this weekend.
The third gets to play host.
The No. 10 Stanford women's
soccer team returns home this week
end to face No. 7 USC and No. 15
UCLA in a weekend of intense com
petition that promises to define the
leader in the battle for the Pacific 10.

WOMEN'S SOCCER

■ Today: No. 10 Stanford (11-3. 4-0
Pacific 10 Conference) vs. No. 15
UCLA (11-3-1. 3-0-1). 7:30 p.m..
New Maloney Field.

■ Sunday: Stanford vs. No. 7 USC
(11-3,4-0). 1:00 p.m.. New Maloney
Field.

The three teams were the presea
son conference favorites and, now.
USC (11-3, 4-0 Pac-10) and Stan
ford (11-3, 4-0) lead the competi
tion, while UCLA (11-3-1, 3-0-1)
ranks second in the conference after
its tie against Washington on Sun
day.
Although the games this week
end will not determine a Pac-10
champion, the outcomes will likely
serve as a harbinger of things to
come and, at the very least, an indi
cation of the strength of the confer
ence.
"These are strong opponents and
we have respect for both ol them.
