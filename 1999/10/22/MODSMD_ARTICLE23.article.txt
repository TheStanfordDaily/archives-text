■ Wednesday: No. 9 Stanford 4W
UC-Davis 533.

After the No. 9 Cardinal defeated
the UC-Davis Aggies by 35 strokes
in Wednesday's dual match, head
coach Wally Goodwin was all smiles.
"We killed 'em," he said as here

viewed the day's scoring statistics.
Only the top seven of the eight
players' rounds were scored, and
Stanford easily came out on top.
shooting an impressive 49H (+1) to
UC-Davis' 533 (+36). The entire
team played well and posted low
scores to hand the Aggies a convinc
ing loss.
The match primarily served as the
first-round qualifier for the Nelson
Invitational Tournament at Stanford
next weekend. Five members of the

Cardinal will make the team, while
lour others will play as individuals
not scored in the team competition.
After Wednesday's round, the top
five golfers heading into the week
end qualifying rounds are senior cap
tain Dusty Hrett (69), junior Alex
Aragon (69). junior trie Dahlberg
(71). sophomore Philip Kowc (71)
and junior Jimmy I ee (72.)
Individually. Brett and Aragon
led the way with under-par rounds.
Despite tying for the day's best
round. Aragon believes that his
score could have realistically been
two or three shots lower.
"1 was hitting the ball great." he
said. "I was playing my irons well all
day. I*m not upset, but had a few
putts fallen like they should have. I
could have done better."
The most exciting moment of the
day came when Lee holed a 176-yard
tee shot on the 14th hole with his six
iron. Hie hole-in-one never hit the
ground but found the bottom of the
cup on the fly.
"It just disappeared and I knew it
right away," Lee said. "I was playing
bad to that point, about three over
par. and it just got me going the rest
of the way."
Goodwin was most enthused
about Wednesday's match because
of his team's overall performance,
top to bottom. The team scoring av
erage was just above par at 71.1.
"We have more depth on this
team than we've ever had bv a con

sidcrablc margin," he said.
Only two Aggies managed to fin
ish ahead of freshman Jim Seki (74),
who carded Stanford's eighth-best
score and was therefore not factored
into the results. UC-Davis sopho
mores Jason Boyd (72) and Will
Johnson (73) were the top Aggies of
the day.
Before using Friday as an off
day. the Cardinal practiced at the
nearby Olympic C lub on Thursday.
It now heads into weekend qualify
ing rounds in anticipation of the
Nelson. Goodwin's lineup for the
Nelson will be set on Sunday, after
the qualifying rounds are complet
ed.
"It's really nice to have this tour
nament at home because we can slip
in four extra players as individuals,"
he said. "It gives more players a
chance to play and lets their friends
and families see them in competi
tion."
Goodwin will have his players
focus on their short games leading up
to the Nelson Invitational opening
round. The Cardinal must sharpen
its putting accuracy, as the greens
will be faster than usual for the tour
nament.
