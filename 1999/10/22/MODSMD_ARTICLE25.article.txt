### Kellie Wiginton 
Alter an extremely successful, yet
slightly disappointing second-place
finish in last year's NCAA meet, the
men's swim team is anticipating an
exciting season for 1999-2(KX). Al
though second place in the nation is
considered a strong finish at most
schools, the Stanford swim team
strives for nothing less than perfec
tion.

MEN'S SWIMMING

■ Sunday: No. I Stanford competes
in the University of the Pacific Invi
tational at Stockton.

All eyes will he on the top-ranked
( ardinal men's swim team this Satur
day as it competes in the University of
the Pacific Invitational in Stockton,
Stanford's first meet of the year.
Among the competition will be UOP,
Pacific 10 Conference rival Califor
nia, as well as Division II schools.
Hie team is comprised of an ex
ceptionally strong nucleus, as well as
a talented and enthusiastic crop of
freshmen.
Key returners include senior
Glenn Counts and juniors Adam
Mcssner. Anthony Robinson, Steven
Brown and Rob Canales — all re
ceiving All-American honors last
season.
While the past accomplishments
of the returners speak for themselves,
the team and coaches are eager to see
how the enthusiasm of the newcom
ers carry over into competition.
"We lost some good seniors last
year, and got some good recruits for
this year." Robinson said. '"But it's

hard to put that into perspective* until
you see [the newcomers] in meets."
"The team is looking great."
Canales said. "We have a great class
ol incoming freshmen — eight guys
working hard and adjusting to college
really well."
Messner agrees that lhe freshmen
are a critical part of the team's
morale. "It's clear that every fresh
man on the team has that winning at
titude. They expect nothing less than
to win everything, and that kind of

enthusiasm is contagious."
While the Cardinal acknowledges
the No. I ranking in the Coaches' Poll
as an honor, it knows that a ranking
alone does not win a championship.
Continued perseverance and im
provement upon the individuals'
strengths will be two of the main in
gredients needed for a successful sea
son. The team is looking at this week
end as a starting-off point for the rest
of the season.
"It'll be interesting to see how we

stack up," said assistant coach Ted
Knapp. "We know that we can con
tend. but [the No. 1 ranking] may be a
bit presumptuous on the part of the
people who voted."
Messner adds that this weekend
will not necessarily be indicative of
what the rest of the season will hold,
due to the different format of this
meet. "It'll be sort of like an extreme
ly intense practice. We'll be swim
ming a lot more events than at a usual
meet."
