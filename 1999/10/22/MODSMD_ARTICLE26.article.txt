### Meghan O'Connor Staff writer 
I he Stanford men's soccer team
(S-2-2, 3-0-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) is hoping that
experience w ill be the name of the
game this weekend, as the Cardinal
squad, which returned 15 players
from last year, challenges the rela
tively young squads from Oregon
State (4-8-0, 0-2-0) and Washing
ton (7-4-2.2-0-0).
"They will both be tough
games," co-captain T.K. Inbody
said. "We need to work hard, out
work our opponents and stay disci
plined. It can be hard to focus on
both, we'll need to take them one at
a time."
112 irst up is Oregon State. The
Cardinal, the current leaders
among the eight Mountain Divi
sion schools in the MPSF. will face
off against the seventh-place
Beavers today.
Fourteen new players and two
new coaches have given the
Beavers, who finished (7-10-1) last
year, a lot to work with this season.
Although the Beavers have only
notched four wins thus far. their 2-
1 victory over Gon/aga, following a
2-0 defeat, marks an accomplish
ment that the Cardinal have failed
to match, bowing 3-1 to Gon/aga in
early September.

The Beavers' close 4-3 game
with Air Force resulted in a defeat
for Oregon State, but serves as an
other sign of the Beaver's potential
force as the Cardinal only managed
a I-I tie with Air Force earlier this

On Sunday, the Cardinal will
face the Huskies. Washington, like
Stanford, is unbeaten in the MPSF
and is currently No. 3 in the MPSF
Mountain Division, below Stan
ford and California. Although
Stanford beat Washington last sea

Huskies went on to capture the
MPSF title, making them the team
to beat this season.
The Huskies, however, have a
new and younger look this year,
boasting 17 freshmen and sopho

trouble adjusting to the new squad,
already posting a 2-0 win over Air

Stanford will have to focus and
try to take the success it's been hav

secure two victories this weekend.
"We've got ourselves into a
great position," head coach Bobby
Clark said. "I could almost bet my
bottom dollar that with two wins
this weekend we could win the
Mountain Division of the MPSF.
The exciting thing is that the team
keeps growing. [Two victories this
weekend) won't be easy, but I think
we're ready."
