# Big Turf: field hockey takes on rival Bears
## Bay-Area rivals battle it out out for control of NorPac conference lead 
### Ashley Rich Contributing writer 
After four days back East on a
road trip, the field hockey team (7-7.
4-0 Northern Pacific Conference) re
turns to take on a longtime NorPac
rival a little closer to home.
The Cardinal prepares to play
California ( I M. 4-0) on Sunday at
Berkeley in a game that will decide
the NorPac-regular season champi
on. The Bears have already defeated
Stanford earlier in the season in a
match that went through two over
times and was finally decided by
penalty strokes.
The game didn't count toward the
conference record, and now both
teams are 4-0 in the NorPac — the
only undefeated conference con
tenders. If they can keep their leading
status, the two teams will probably
meet again at the conference champi
onship at Stanford in November.
Because Stanford and Oil have al
ready competed. both teams have the

advantage of knowing what to expect
on Sunday. ()ne of Stanford's goals is
to shut down Oil's aggressive and
successful attack. The Bears have
outshot opponents 47-16 so far this
season en route to posting six
shutouts.
