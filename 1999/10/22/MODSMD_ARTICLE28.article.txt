## Farm scribe enjoys 'Good Life' 
### Sarah Heim 
Keith Scribner's new novel,"The
Good Life," isn't an autobiography.
But with a title like that, it could be.
When Scribner arrived at Stan
ford University in 1994. he had writ
ten only a few chapters of his book.
However, when he leaves Stanford
this spring, he won't be just packing
up a copy of his first published novel.
He'll also be taking along a new and
inspiring chapter in his own life.
Originally from the Northeast,
Scribner graduated from Vassar
College in 19K4 with a bachelor's de
gree in economics.
After teaching English in Japan
for a year, he returned to the United
States and worked in Boston as a
carpenter, a job that he would return
to often in years to come.
"If you're getting writing done in
your life, there's no need to get a
Masters of Fine Arts, hut I wasn't,"
Scribner said about his post-college
experience.
"As an economics major. I hadn't
taken any fiction writing classes in
college. I knew there had to be some
secrets out there that someone else
could teach me."
With that in mind, he applied to
and was accepted at the University
of Montana. Graduating in 1991
with an MFA in creative writing, he
again taught abroad, this time in
Turkey.
He traveled extensively in the
Middle East before returning to
Boston, where he worked as a
Checker Cab driver.
But Scribner's heart wasn't in
carpentry or cab driving. He was a
writer.
Following his passion, he applied
for the Stanford Creative Writing
Program's Stegner Fellowship in
1994 and received one of five two
year fellowships in fiction that are
awarded annually.
Scribner already knew he wanted
to write when he arrived at Stanford.
What he didn't know was that lie
would also become a husband, a la
ther, and an acclaimed teacher and
writer before his chapter at the I Jni
versity came to an end.
"I met Jen [Richter] playing
poker with some Stegners one of my
first nights in town." Scribner said,
holding up a snapshot of himself
with his wife and their two-month
old son. Luke.
Scribner and Richter. a former
Stegner Fellow in poetry, married in
1998. At the end of their fellowships,
they were both appointed Jones
Lecturers, an honor awarded to a se
lect number of departing Fellows
each year.
Although their three-year (cach
ing appointments will end this

spring. Scribner remains optimistic
about their teaching possibilities for
next year.
"We'd like to get a joint teaching
position somewhere. We hope that
applying as a team works to our ad
vantage." he said.
Senior Vanessa Heming. one of
Scribner's former students, said she
thinks Scribner and Richter make a
great team.
"When I met |Scribner] m\ fresh
man year. I still wasn't comfortable
at Stanford. He introduced to me
| Richter]. I he\ were great role
models for me. I hey showed me
what it was like to be young and cre
ative and in love." she said.
While Scribner said he will be sad
to lose the view from his shared of
fice in the English department, it is
not onl\ the campus he'll miss. It's
the students, too.
"I have no complaints about the
students. They are sophisticated
readers of published literature and
critical thinkers." Scribner said.
With a nostalgic smile, he added.
"I'm inspired by them, lhev are a
reminder to me that i! you jList start
typing, it is that much better than not
writing at all."
And he is a reminder to them that
not all writers follow the same path
to success.
"A lot of us came into [Scribner's

fiction] class feeling like we had to
be great writers at age 20. but he
made me reali/e you have to have a
life to have something to write
about." Fleming said. "My room
mates get mad at me because I al
ways say [Scribner] had a real life
before coming to Stanford."
Students say his "real-life" expe
rience makes it easy for them to feel
comfortable in his class.
"I le's a down-to-earth and dedi
cated teacher." said senior Jenny
I.eidner. "I Ie inspires me."
Scribner's colleagues in the Eng
lish department confirm the acco
lades of his students.
" l hev love him." said Jones Lec
turer Ryan I larty. "I lis students are
energized. I le's gotten them excited
about fiction and writing."
I nglish professor and author To
bias Wolff agrees. "[Scribner] has a
wonderful reputation as a teacher."
he said.
"I really liked 'The Good Life.'
It's an extraordinary book." Wolff
said. "It's a difficult and daring novel
that keeps surprising you."
("hances are good that there will
be some surprises in the next chap
ter of Scribner's life, too.
"I see big things for him in the fu
ture." 1 larty said. "I believe he'll be
one of the important writers of our
neneration."
