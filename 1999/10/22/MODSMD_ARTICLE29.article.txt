Most people change a Hat tire on their own. hut il
the transmission on their car goes, they head to a me
chanic. When it comes to seeing their Freshman Ad
visers. not a lot of Stanford students seem to be lol
lowing the same principle.
Sophomore Abby Shaw decided to stay in the dri
ver's seat when working out the bigger decisions, leav
ing only the more basic things to her adviser.
"She's nice but she didn't really have any advice for
me," said Shaw. "She said to do what I lei I was right
and I did. Then I realized that I could do that without
her and so I just get my approval codes and that's it."
While sophomore Valentina Velcz-Rocha said that
her FA did research in a field that interested her and
had a good sense of a lour year plan, she s quick to
admit that she too "didn't ask much ol him —just my
access codes."
And sophomore Erika Soto also wasn l driven to
seek her adviser's opinion on academic goals or litid
ing the right courses. I ler "bad. bad situation with her
FA only got worse when he sent her an e-mail saying
that he no longer had a job at Stanford. Now Soto has
to use online communication to get her approval code
from someone who isn't on campus.
"I'd like to have an adviser who works on campus
and has contacts and not a retired Palo Alto commu
nity member. I think they need to be more carelul
about who they pick to be advisers, she said
To qualify to be an adviser, an applicant must have
at least a bachelor's degree, worked at Stanford for
one year, and have some affiliation with academics on
campus.
The freshman advising program then matches these
volunteers with five to eight entering students whose
stated academic interests are in the same as the ones
the FA wants to advise.

And this is the student s adviser until a major is de
clared. unless a "( hange of Adviser" form is filled out
at the Undergraduate Advising Center. Hut the
process of switching advisers is not an easy one. and
usually not permitted unless there's a change in the
field of interest or a real incompatibility. Associate Di
rector of Undergraduate Advising Dandre DeSandies
said. Even then, the center contacts the student about
who the new adviser is going to be.
The Freshman and Sophomore Programs of lice
began shifting the gears a little this year, introducing
an experimental sophomore mentoring program in
conjunction with the UAC.
"We invited some faculty who taught a freshman
seminar or Sophomore College class to formalize the
mentoring relationship they had already established
with their students by serving as an adviser during the
student's sophomore year, until they decided majors."
said Shari Palmer, the new director of Freshman /
Sophomore Programs.
Although the initiative already has more than 30
faculty members participating and 130 students with
re-assigned advisers, it's not vet ready to go full-speed
ahead. Palmer said that the program's impact will be
assessed in the coming year, and there is no decision
yet about its future.
But there seems to be a number of Freshman Ad
visers who arc already using such mechanisms on their
own. Nanci I lovve. a stall member with 15 years of FA
experience, offers more than just the general academ
ic advice and direction that the UAC requires.
"My goals are to establish a personal relationship
with each advisee and encourage them to think broad
ly about their academic goals." said Howe.
"The success of the relationship." she said, "is ulti
mately dependent upon the adviser and the advisee
reaching out to cultivate an effective advising relation
ship."
