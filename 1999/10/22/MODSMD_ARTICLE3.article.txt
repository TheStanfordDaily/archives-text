# Housing, open space debated
## 
### Chris Crowell 
Housing shortages, open space
and the University's right to expand
were all debated in a well-attended
meeting held yesterday evening in
the Palo Alto City Council Cham
bers.
Santa Clara County Supervisor
Joseph Simitian mediated an open
forum discussion of the Stanford
Draft Development Plan and Gen
eral Use Permit Application. To
gether. these documents lay out
Stanford's plans for expansion, and
are subject to approval by the ('oun
ty.
In the next 10 years. Stanford in
tends to add 4 million square feet of
academic, athletic and housing facil
ities to its current 12 million. Most
agree that Stanford needs to grow to
maintain its premier status, but crit
ics worry that Stanford is expanding
in the wrong way and for the wrong
reasons.
Peter Drekmeier of the Stanford
Open Space Alliance feels that ex
pansion plans are being orchestrat
ed not by the administration but by
the Stanford Management Co..
whose "mandate is (not education
hut) to turn real estate into profit."
Drekmeier pointed out that only
seven of Stanford's 34 Trustees live
in San Mateo or Santa Clara Coun
ties, and accused the Board of
Trustees of being "absentee
landowners" who were uninformed
and unwilling to listen to community
input regarding land use issues.
Trustee T. Robert Burke, who
serves on the Land and Buildings
Committee, agreed that trustees
could not be equally informed about
all issues. But Burke rejected the no
tion that Stanford's Trustees, who

represent such a diverse community
of students and alumni, could be ex
pected to live locally.
Larry Horton, Director of Gov
ernment and Community Relations
lor Stanford, also disputed Drek
meier's contentions. "We think we
are good neighbors." Horton said,
"and we will continue to be one of
the best preservers of open space in
Northern California." Norton also
cited Stanford's victory in a l 997 vote
over the Sand Hill Road building
project as evidence that the public is
behind Stanford.
Drekmeier is unconvinced. He
wants a permanent guarantee that
Stanford will not expand into the
foothills, a development strategy fo
cused on increasing the density of the
existing core campus, and an empha

sis on building housing before com
mercial structures.
Students and faculty were divided
on the issue. ASSU President Mike
Levin, a junior, spoke at the meeting
to "defend Stanford's right to pros
per."
History Prof. Paul Robinson
identified housing shortages as an
impediment to recruiting junior fac
ulty, but supported efforts to in
crease density within existing faculty
neighborhoods.
Cancel Fraser, a sophomore, ar
gued that Stanford's decisions set a
precedent for urban sprawl issues
and urged more students to educate
themselves about land-use issues. "I
love Stanford and I want Stanford to
expand. But it's not if we expand, it's
how we expand." she said.
