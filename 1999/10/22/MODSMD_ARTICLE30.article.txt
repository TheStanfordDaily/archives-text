# Dorm life: more than just a black-and-white issue
## Do ethnic houses alienate or enlighten? 
### Gloria Huang 
In remembering his reaction to
his freshman housing assignment to
Okada. sophomore Lonnie IJso
replies. "In some ways, you feel
kind of like you're just there to di
lute something."
His roommate, sophomore
Noah Sorscher. agrees: "[You feel a
little] like leftovers. It's not the im
pression you get from living there,
just from being put there. It's like,
don't I have a purpose, too?"
Uso and Sorscher had been
placed in Okada their freshman
year. Their reactions mirrored the
reflections of many other non-mi
nority students who had been as
signed to live in Ethnic Theme
houses during their freshman year.
Sophomore Niek Davis remem
bers that his first reaction to being
placed in Ujamaa had been fairly
neutral, although he did think. "Oh.
great. 1 got a theme dorm." Similar
ly. sophomore Karen Brunton was
also assigned to live in I Jjamaa, and
she had wondered if someone had
made a mistake.
"I was a little bit nervous. I
mean. I was already nervous about
going to college, and then here's my
freshman experience," Brunton
said.
She adds. "I was afraid that an
Ethnic Theme house meant that
the minority students who chose to
live there wanted to live away from
white people, from Stanford. It
added to the stress [of going to col
lege)."
Eric Tribbett and Lex Bayer,
both juniors and roommates who
had been assigned to Casa Zapata
their freshman year, express senti
ments similar to Brunton's.
"I was a little apprehensive. 1
was all excited to go to college for
the first time, and I was looking lot
ward to a typical dorm life," said
Tribbett.
"I didn't quite know what to ex
pect. to be honest. I was definitely a
bit nervous and you never want to
go into something you didn't pick,"
said Bayer.
Housing Assignment Services
explain the rationale behind assign
ing non-minority students to live in
Ethnic Theme dorms bv stating,
"The populations of the houses ...
encourage cross-cultural learning
and exchange among all residents."
Residential Education elabo
rates on this concept: "The houses
provide an informal opportunity
for students of different back
grounds to learn from and about
each other.
Part of the learning that should
be taking place in all residences is
the recognition that each of lis has a
distinctive identity drawn from our
family, regional, religious, racial,
gender, socio-economic and ethnic
background... Awareness of racial
heritage on the part of one group in
the house can promote a sharing of
backgrounds of all residents."
Such goals were met in certain
eases more than others. For exam
ple. Brunton passionately declares.
"I had an absolutely great experi
ence. It was a meat vear that started

off with a wonderful welcoming
and my fears were erased within the
first week, possibly the first hour, of
meeting everyone. It was a unique
experience that I wouldn't have
traded for the world and I only wish
everyone had been so lucky."
Brunton is careful to point out
that not everyone had been so
lucky. Even she knew several non
minority friends who had negative
experiences in their Ethnic Theme
dorms.
"Things can sometimes break
down into race." she said.
Junior Celina Ramirez did not
live in an Ethnic Theme house her
freshman year, but the all-freshman
Wilbur dorm. Rinconada. Ramirez
said, "I think it is important to real
ize that the situation of many ethnic
minority students in non-theme
dorms is similar to that of students
that are placed in ethnic theme
dorms that are not of their ethnici
ty."
"People often want to consider
white identity as neutral or non-po
litical. but as an ethnic minority liv
ing in a non-ethnic freshman dorm,
I definitely felt the presence of
white culture." Ramirez added.
Davis asserts that living in an
Ethnic Theme house was an "inter
esting experience" that was "great"
but "would have been a lot cooler if
I was black." adding that Ujamaa
had been a big center of black cul
ture.
"There were times when I felt
that my experience would have
been better in a normal dorm,"
Bayer said.
"In a social way. you meet more
people in a normal dorm, whereas
there are times in theme dorms
where you definitely felt separate.
Little things like signs in Spanish
become issues when you don't
speak the language. For example. 1
was the only person in the dorm
who had "Happy Birthday' written
on my door in English," he added.
"You're always welcome to be a
part of things, but feelings of alien
ation just happen," Bayer said.
Iribbett agrees, adding. "People
already had friends through differ
ent ethnic organizations and maybe
they were a little closer that way. It
was probably not the most con
ducive to [freshmen making
friends)."
Bayer and Tribbett are adamant
in stating, however, that both had
an extremely positive experience.
Despite her similarly positive expe
rience. Brunton concedes ;i surpris
ing result: "At the beginning, I had
a diverse mixture of friends, more
black than white. By the second
quarter, it became divided and
most of my [African-American]
roommate's friends were black, but
mine were white and Asian."
Along the same lines, Uso and
Sorschcr said that "at the end of the
year, the Draw groups that formed
were more or less homogeneous,
with all Asians in one, all non-
Asians in the other. I here were ex
ceptions. of course, but generally,
the Draw groups resegregated."
Many students still expressed
the opinion that the Ethnic Theme

dorms should be continued.
Both Davis and Brunton assert
that the Ethnic Theme dorms are a
good idea and important to main
tain. Brunton adds that "it im
proves the Stanford experience."
Sorschcr maintains that the Eth
nic Theme dorms are still 50 percent
non-minority, pointing out that "in
a normal dorm, people are still from
different countries and it's just that
in Okada, a lot more are from the
same country. But no matter where
you are, different people will be
speaking different languages."
The other students seem to
agree, but expressed certain
caveats as well. All the students
were adamant in asserting that it is
essential that il the Ethnic Theme
houses are to continue, at least 50
percent of the houses must be non
minority students, for the benefit of
both the non-minority and the mi
nority students.
Non-Ethnic Theme houses can
also present points of improvement
for some students.
"When issues of the grape vote
came up. it was clear to me that my
experiences as an ethnic minority
had been very different from most
of the white persons in my dorm,"
Ramirez said.
Several of the students men
tioned that despite positive experi
ences, had they been given the
choice, they would have opted for a
more "typical" freshman experi
ence.
Bayer states, "I don't think it's a
good thing to do freshman year.
[Freshmen) should be meeting
other people, from a variety of eth
nicities. 1! the only way to maintain
a 50 / 50 ratio in an Ethnic theme
house is to include freshmen, so be
it. But if there is another way. per
haps that would be better.
"Although, coming from a back
ground of segregation (Bayer is
from South Africa). I feel that hav
ing separate groups does not help
destroy segregation, but only en
courages a separatist view of that
group of people."
ResEd addresses such concerns
bv stating that "directly acknowl
edging the differences [between
ethnicities) and seeking to under
stand them... can improve residen
tial experience. . . . Theme houses
have [an essential role] in building
bonds and supporting members of
the group who are the focus of the
theme."
There will still be some non-mi
nority students (as well as minority
students) who will want to petition
their Ethnic Theme housing assign
ment. However. Housing Assign
ments only offers considerations of
reassignment to uppcrclassmen.
The reigning opinion of the vet
erans of Ethnic theme housing sug
gests that the experience is more
positive than one might expect.
Bayer notes. "Not many people
feel comfortable in a room where
they are the minority, whether it is
non-minorities in an Ethnic Theme
house, or minorities in a Caucasian
dorm. But those things are not nec
essarily bad and those things make
you grow."

Bayer and Tribbett are adamant
in stating, however, that both had
an extremely positive experience.
Despite her similarly positive expe
rience. Brunton concedes ;i surpris
ing result: "At the beginning, I had
a diverse mixture of friends, more
black than white. By the second
quarter, it became divided and
most of my [African-American]
roommate's friends were black, but
mine were white and Asian."
Along the same lines, Uso and
Sorschcr said that "at the end of the
year, the Draw groups that formed
were more or less homogeneous,
with all Asians in one, all non-
Asians in the other. I here were ex
ceptions. of course, but generally,
the Draw groups resegregated."
Many students still expressed
the opinion that the Ethnic Theme

dorms should be continued.
Both Davis and Brunton assert
that the Ethnic Theme dorms are a
good idea and important to main
tain. Brunton adds that "it im
proves the Stanford experience."
Sorschcr maintains that the Eth
nic Theme dorms are still 50 percent
non-minority, pointing out that "in
a normal dorm, people are still from
different countries and it's just that
in Okada, a lot more are from the
same country. But no matter where
you are, different people will be
speaking different languages."
The other students seem to
agree, but expressed certain
caveats as well. All the students
were adamant in asserting that it is
essential that il the Ethnic Theme
houses are to continue, at least 50
percent of the houses must be non
minority students, for the benefit of
both the non-minority and the mi
nority students.
Non-Ethnic Theme houses can
also present points of improvement
for some students.
"When issues of the grape vote
came up. it was clear to me that my
experiences as an ethnic minority
had been very different from most
of the white persons in my dorm,"
Ramirez said.
Several of the students men
tioned that despite positive experi
ences, had they been given the
choice, they would have opted for a
more "typical" freshman experi
ence.
Bayer states, "I don't think it's a
good thing to do freshman year.
[Freshmen) should be meeting
other people, from a variety of eth
nicities. 1! the only way to maintain
a 50 / 50 ratio in an Ethnic theme
house is to include freshmen, so be
it. But if there is another way. per
haps that would be better.
"Although, coming from a back
ground of segregation (Bayer is
from South Africa). I feel that hav
ing separate groups does not help
destroy segregation, but only en
courages a separatist view of that
group of people."
ResEd addresses such concerns
bv stating that "directly acknowl
edging the differences [between
ethnicities) and seeking to under
stand them... can improve residen
tial experience. . . . Theme houses
have [an essential role] in building
bonds and supporting members of
the group who are the focus of the
theme."
There will still be some non-mi
nority students (as well as minority
students) who will want to petition
their Ethnic Theme housing assign
ment. However. Housing Assign
ments only offers considerations of
reassignment to uppcrclassmen.
The reigning opinion of the vet
erans of Ethnic theme housing sug
gests that the experience is more
positive than one might expect.
Bayer notes. "Not many people
feel comfortable in a room where
they are the minority, whether it is
non-minorities in an Ethnic Theme
house, or minorities in a Caucasian
dorm. But those things are not nec
essarily bad and those things make
you grow."


Joanna Hiatt - Daily
Ujamaa, the African-American theme dorm on campus, has freshmen living there both by choice and
by assignment.
In remembering his reaction to
his freshman housing assignment to
Okada. sophomore Lonnie IJso
replies. "In some ways, you feel
kind of like you're just there to di
lute something."
His roommate, sophomore
Noah Sorscher. agrees: "[You feel a
little] like leftovers. It's not the im
pression you get from living there,
just from being put there. It's like,
don't I have a purpose, too?"
Uso and Sorscher had been
placed in Okada their freshman
year. Their reactions mirrored the
reflections of many other non-mi
nority students who had been as
signed to live in Ethnic Theme
houses during their freshman year.
Sophomore Niek Davis remem
bers that his first reaction to being
placed in Ujamaa had been fairly
neutral, although he did think. "Oh.
great. 1 got a theme dorm." Similar
ly. sophomore Karen Brunton was
also assigned to live in I Jjamaa, and
she had wondered if someone had
made a mistake.
"I was a little bit nervous. I
mean. I was already nervous about
going to college, and then here's my
freshman experience," Brunton
said.
She adds. "I was afraid that an
Ethnic Theme house meant that
the minority students who chose to
live there wanted to live away from
white people, from Stanford. It
added to the stress [of going to col
lege)."
Eric Tribbett and Lex Bayer,
both juniors and roommates who
had been assigned to Casa Zapata
their freshman year, express senti
ments similar to Brunton's.
"I was a little apprehensive. 1
was all excited to go to college for
the first time, and I was looking lot
ward to a typical dorm life," said
Tribbett.
"I didn't quite know what to ex
pect. to be honest. I was definitely a
bit nervous and you never want to
go into something you didn't pick,"
said Bayer.
Housing Assignment Services
explain the rationale behind assign
ing non-minority students to live in
Ethnic Theme dorms bv stating,
"The populations of the houses ...
encourage cross-cultural learning
and exchange among all residents."
Residential Education elabo
rates on this concept: "The houses
provide an informal opportunity
for students of different back
grounds to learn from and about
each other.
Part of the learning that should
be taking place in all residences is
the recognition that each of lis has a
distinctive identity drawn from our
family, regional, religious, racial,
gender, socio-economic and ethnic
background... Awareness of racial
heritage on the part of one group in
the house can promote a sharing of
backgrounds of all residents."
Such goals were met in certain
eases more than others. For exam
ple. Brunton passionately declares.
"I had an absolutely great experi
ence. It was a meat vear that started

off with a wonderful welcoming
and my fears were erased within the
first week, possibly the first hour, of
meeting everyone. It was a unique
experience that I wouldn't have
traded for the world and I only wish
everyone had been so lucky."
Brunton is careful to point out
that not everyone had been so
lucky. Even she knew several non
minority friends who had negative
experiences in their Ethnic Theme
dorms.
"Things can sometimes break
down into race." she said.
Junior Celina Ramirez did not
live in an Ethnic Theme house her
freshman year, but the all-freshman
Wilbur dorm. Rinconada. Ramirez
said, "I think it is important to real
ize that the situation of many ethnic
minority students in non-theme
dorms is similar to that of students
that are placed in ethnic theme
dorms that are not of their ethnici
ty."
"People often want to consider
white identity as neutral or non-po
litical. but as an ethnic minority liv
ing in a non-ethnic freshman dorm,
I definitely felt the presence of
white culture." Ramirez added.
Davis asserts that living in an
Ethnic Theme house was an "inter
esting experience" that was "great"
but "would have been a lot cooler if
I was black." adding that Ujamaa
had been a big center of black cul
ture.
"There were times when I felt
that my experience would have
been better in a normal dorm,"
Bayer said.
"In a social way. you meet more
people in a normal dorm, whereas
there are times in theme dorms
where you definitely felt separate.
Little things like signs in Spanish
become issues when you don't
speak the language. For example. 1
was the only person in the dorm
who had "Happy Birthday' written
on my door in English," he added.
"You're always welcome to be a
part of things, but feelings of alien
ation just happen," Bayer said.
Iribbett agrees, adding. "People
already had friends through differ
ent ethnic organizations and maybe
they were a little closer that way. It
was probably not the most con
ducive to [freshmen making
friends)."
Bayer and Tribbett are adamant
in stating, however, that both had
an extremely positive experience.
Despite her similarly positive expe
rience. Brunton concedes ;i surpris
