# HUMAN DIVINITY and THE SCIENTIFIC PROOF OF GOD
## 
### 
1 • THE SCIENTIFIC PROOF OF GOD. Atoms exist throughout the universe & within them electrons, protons & other subatomic parts. These parts move with spin-like "angular momen
tum"—ceaselessly, perpetually. Quantum physics has shown that all electrons & other such particles have a truly astounding property called 1/2 spin, which is conceptualized or described as
follows: get a coffee mug or a cup with 1 handle. Sit down with it at a table; place the mug in front of you, with the handle toward you. Now rotate the handle until it goes around 1 complete
turn & has returned to its position toward you. The handle has turned 1 complete rotation or 360°. Now this time IMAGINE the mug is an electron & the handle goes around 360°. Quantum
physics proves that in this case wherein the electron turns 360°, moving exactly like electrons everywhere in the universe, that electron has only made 1/2 a turn - only 1/2 a complete spin.
For electrons & other subatomic parts it takes additional movement or spin, another 360° for a total of 720°, in order to complete one full rotation. This, then, is the 1/2 Spin, and I contend
that this essential, central element of quantum physics, which appears in physics textbooks throughout the world, is as deeply, profoundly mysterious, supernatural & divine as any sacred,
holy knowledge or text of any world religion. The 1/2 Spin in explicit, scientific terms describes the existence of a mysterious dimension within the atom, inextricably fixed within the core of the
entire material universe. Such movement is impossible for objects as we commonly know & perceive them. How could part of us, our electrons for example, spin partly in some other dimen
sion without driving us & the universe completely out of control? No matter what convoluted explanations one might concoct in coping with such a vast, completely incredible state of affairs, it
offers persuasive proof of some wonderful Grace merely for the universe TO BE & for US to live. I contend that the 1/2 Spin proves the existence of this State of Grace, a dimension of God or
of the Soul, if you will. Scientists will say (and have said) that one should not conceive of the subatomic world as having little chunks of matter spinning around like tops and that such a con
ceptual model is just that—a conceptual model and not to be confused with sub-atomic reality itself. Well, OK. The way of Zen or Zen itself one must not confuse with the thing itself—one's
own deepest experience of that which is commonly called Zen. However, electrons do have discrete, separately identifiable properties like charge, mass & movement. We Qfi live in an
Electronic Age, with abundant tangible manifestations. If any part of me—my protons, my electrons, or Anything Else exists EVEN REMOTELY in ANY SENSE as 1 complete revolution
requiring 720°-then to me, make no mistake, this fact definitively describes & defines an amazing State of Grace. This unfathomable quality, this central paradox & profound mystery lies
embedded at the center of that one crucial, timeless point where faith, science & all else, too, must finally come together, to intersect —here in the time & place (all around us, throughout the
universe wherein one complete rotation takes 720° -here in eternal Soul. The whole really is greater than the sum of its parts. Such is God's country. GOD IS in the details. All things are
indeed possible with God. (See, Matthew 1C126, Mark 10:27, Luke 18:27.)

2. HUMAN DIVINITY rM . "Whenever a true theory appears, it will be its own evidence." Emerson, "Nature," 1844. Hydrogen exists in all parts of the universe. Materially, numerically, statisti
cally, hydrogen -by a truly overwhelming margin—lS THE UNIVERSE. Hydrogen, made up of just 1 little proton & 1 little electron (proton, electron, hydrogen =3 in one, interwoven for all
time in divine symmetry/asymmetry, is it not?) is, by an astronomically wide margin the most common component of the universe. Stars everywhere are almost entirely composed of
hydrogen, burning in thermonuclear reactions for billions & billions of years. Similarly, the instellar gas—even vaster in scale & quantity than all the stars put together—is mostly all hydro
gen. The overwhelming preponderance of hydrogen structures our universe. In short, as far as we can ascertain, the universe is a very big place & almost all the matter in it is hydrogen,
floating in space & burning in stars. This is common scientific knowledge. See, e.g., Sir Fred Hoyle, The Nature of the Universe (1950). All rightee, then, now hold up your hand & what
do you see? Gaze into a mirror & what appears there? Look in the corner of a room & see the three dimensions there AND THEN look within to REVEAL THERE the prior Fourth Dimen
sion of mind/perception necessary to appreciate the OTHER 3 dimensions. The Kingdom of God IS within. Luke 17:21 Admire the leaves of grass in the meadow, the roses in the gar
den, the waves upon the sea . . . What you find there is divinity. The entire material universe, to repeat myself, is virtually all HYDROGEN, burning in stars or floating in space. All else —
the planets, comets, moons & you, too —all other matter is so RARE as to be almost unbelievable. Everything on earth, including you & the earth, is so rare as to be miraculous —divine.
The odds are enormously great against YOU (or me) existing at all. By awesome, ASTRONOMICALLY OVERWHELMING ODDS you should not exist as matter at all, & if you did exist it
should be as a hydrogen atom burning in some distant star or floating in space. The fact you (we) are here at all is so astoundingly, astonishingly unlikely as to be a Miracle Divine. Just
as fish don't see the water in which they swim & as it is often impossible to see the forest for the tree(s), so with HUMAN DIVINITY were it not for you & me.
I hope these ideas help you in some way, in many ways. They are not based on idle beliefs or wishes, but on objective, scientific fact. Otherwise, create your own paradigm(s) or subvert some. At least, EXAMINE YOUR PARADIGMS
& act on your own critical analysis. This can facilitate real evolution. Such freedoms of thought & action are well worth using & preserving. If consumerism, religionism, academics & all the other things that busy you should sometime
leave an empty feeling, try looking within & consider what you find. Divinity is the General Theory, though the Special Theory indicates that many have not actually discovered or specially experienced their own unique Human Divinity
1 M , but lam confident that seek & you'll find. E = mc 2 is very persuasive of the remarkable, divine-like energy embodied in matter, including, of course, your own body. The energy (E) of even a 30-lb. child (m =30 lbs.) inexorably
expands to an enormous number (c 2 = 186,(KM) miles/second x 186,(KM) miles/sec ). In his childhood development, Teilhard de Chardin, the great Catholic theologian and philosopher, relates his early worship of plain matter in various
forms, which I take as a magnificent intuitive insight. We are, indeed, extraordinary bodies of matter and light. Our mass not only holds vast stores of energy, but our image constantly travels at lightspeed; that's how we see & are seen by
others. Einstein reveals to us a source of great and mysterious power, within even small amounts of mass. If we ever seriously seek a ready source of power to explain psychokinesis, remote viewing, telepathy, etc., such a source seems
close al hand (that is, if you believe Einstein).
We live in a world of iinages traveling at lightspeed (typically taken for granted, I might add), not to mention all the electronic transmissions which pervade our lives. These very words reach your eyes at the speed of light. Eastern
spiritual philosophies have for millenia asserted the co-existence of the sacred & divine in the midst of the ordinary, commonplace & everyday. I think Human Divinity™ and the Scientific Proof of God uses Western science rather
convincingly to support the dazzling, ravishing truth of these ancient Eastern beliefs. All the hydrogen throughout the universe, not to mention the &Spin, is profoundly meaningful, if we will only pay attention. Once you truly, deeply
look directly at the (act of hydrogen & its enormous preponderance, you will find it hard to deny your own remarkable existence as someone (thing) quite different than a hydrogen atom burning in a distant star or floating in space. Of
course, it's your choice, but I guess you will find this fact difficult to ignore. Once you've got the idea, it's like a virus and hard to forget. Science tells us all these hydrogen atoms account for over 99% of the matter in the universe.
Hence, I believe you will never be able to look at a starry night again without hearing those stars whisper back to you, "You are incredibly, astonishingly special, miraculous and divine because and simply because - you exist NOT as a
hydrogen atom burning in a star or floating in space. You are a true miracle of the universe because you exist as you are." Such a very simple idea, but only simple after the thought, not before - rather like fire and the wheel. Just such an
idea can fuel and enfiame the whirling fires which blaze deep within each heart and give hope for better yet to come.
Stanford University, through the Stanford Research Institute, has given strong experimental validity to a truly remarkable human capability indicating Human Divinity™, abilities which conventional science & wisdom claim to be impos
sible. Iwo laser physicists named Harold Puthoff and Russell Targ performed many experiments which recorded various subjects' ability to describe with considerable accuracy events and distant locations when all normal means of
perception were completely unavailable. Lacking space here to detail their findings, I invite you to read for yourself, as I did, in Beyond the Quantum by Michael Talbot, Bantam (paperback), 1988, pp. 165-69. They studied individuals
who could accomplish "remote viewing" of people, places & events in distant locations under scientifically-controlled laboratory conditions. They even found occasions when a subject could "view" locations and events before they had
been randomly chosen Irom multiple scaled envelopes out in the field. Also see, Russell Targ and Harold PuthofT, Reach Mind: Scientists Look at Psychic Ability (NY, Delacorte Press, 1977), p. 51; WGBH Television Station. Nova
I ranscript, "I he Case of ESP," Boston, Mass., Jan. 17, 1984, p. 16. Personally, I think Beyond the (Quantum is one of the most startling, important books ever written; unfortunately, it is out of print but can be found in used bookstores.
Ihe example cited here is only one piece of important information from a book filled with revelatory facts, data, and ideas. It can open doors of perception about human ability and potential examined by respected scientific researchers.
Human I)i vinity' M , like life itself, is pretty much what we make of it. To be bom into this world entails making lots of choices, often among many confusing ideas. We do the best we can. Some of you have heard of Seth, reported to be a
larger-than-life psychic entity/personality which no longer resides in physical reality but nevertheless decided to speak to humanity through a young writer named Jane Roberts. Talbot devoted Chapter 8 of his book to this phenomenon.
Seth spoke volumes through Ms. Roberts from the autumn of 1963 until her death in 1984, with her husband, Robert, transcribing Seth's words spoken during Jane's trances. Seth claimed his ultimate goal was akin to reassurance. As he
put it,"I am telling you that you are not a cosmic bag of bones and flesh, thrown together through some mixture of chemicals and elements. I am telling you that your consciousness is not some fiery product, formed merely accidentally
through the interworkings of chemical components. You are not a forsaken offshoot of physical matter, nor is your consciousness meant to vanish like a pufT of smoke." Jane Roberts, Seth Speaks, p. 10. He encourages us to "forget the
cringing selves that you sometimes are and remember, instead, the magic essence of your own being that sings even now through your fingertips. That is the reality which you are seeking. Experience it fully." Ibid., p. 486, quoted in
Jivyoild lllV Qmmtmn, p 216. You may not have heard of Seth before, but you've probably heard of the Bible. So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. Genesis 1:27.
I said, You are gods, And all of you are children of the Most High. Psalm 82:6 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, You are gods? John 10:34.
I guess like Jane Roberts and her husband Robert who transcribed, I'm another Robert who sends you a similar idea but with a scientific spin. Almost everything is hydrogen atoms, floating in space and burning in stars. The stars
themselves speak to us it we will only listen. We are true miracles of the universe because we exist as we are. We have the means and ability to create the world we desire. We also have within us the conscious ability to evolve. Human
I )ivinity 1 M is a powerlul key which you can use in unlocking your own miraculous inner doors. It can help you understand yourself and who you want to be. History has offered such basic paradigms before —worldviews or frameworks
through which we look out into the world and universe we inhabit. The Ptolemaic system long held that the earth was the fixed center of the entire universe and all the heavenly bodies moved around the earth. The Christian worldview
held that a patriarchal god took pity on us, sending one son, alone, into this world as a human/divine sacrifice to pay for all our alleged sins through a bloody & brutal death, nailed to a cross. The Copernican paradigm repositioned the
basic physical structure of the universe, showing the planets revolving around the sun and thus removing the earth from the center of the universe.
Human Divinity IM gives a new paradigm. The universe, although unimaginably vast in a way we can think about but cannot yet truly fathom and experience, has nevertheless brought us forth. We are here. The stuff, the very raw
material ol our sacred earth and, indeed, our sacred bodies, is so remarkably, unbelievably rare as to be miraculous/divine. Our very bodies are primarily water, II 2 0, which again shows we are an integral part of the universe. We, too, are
predominantly hydrogen, yet something more in the bargain. God and we are interrelated. God does not rule us; God does not own us. Similarly, we do not own God. We must accept responsibility -yes, responsibility—for the human
condition il we wish to change it. This is not a master/slave situation, no matter what anyone may say. God helps those who help themselves (and others).
II all things are possible with God, il God is infinite and eternal, it seems plausible there are infinities of gods (all aspects of God) deserving some measure of reverence, although many aggressive, hysterically self-centered religions won't
warm to this open-minded attitude of spirit infused with loving respect. As always, many powerful forces will attempt to intervene, obscuring your direct experience and understanding of divinity. Families, friends, teachers, bosses,
corporations, religions, governments, all may (typically) prefer you enthralled and dependent History shows us how social organizations almost always jealously guard secular and spiritual power, claiming it for entrenched authority,
usually their own. Nevertheless, relief from alienation and cynicism is possible. If we believe that we and our world/universe are divine gifts, we can consciously evolve. We can find love in perhaps its highest form —respect and deep,
honest consideration for ourselves, others, and our world. Such a love, based on encompassing respect, will enhance our possibilities of self-realization & achievement, enabling us to leap into a new age with renewed purpose & spirit.
3. lUN IIME A EINSTEIN" NOW hold on to your seatbelts for a bumpy ride,/I bring you the future .. . where can you hide?/ Beware, though it scare - not as "Scream" "Halloween'VStill, you'll abide, because grace is the means,/
yes, then, and like it /yes, then, and use it/ to color your dreams.
I will sing for you and summon forth Destiny. (Remember, in physics the symbol c = the speed of light, 186,000 miles per second; E =mc 2 means energy = mass x 186,000 miles/sec. X 186,000 miles/second. The ultimate meaning, so I
believe goes way far beyond the mere numbers.) Here it is now, the future, coming at you from the past. I've known it for a long time now - vaguely, in a cool, distant, opaque sort of way. About 2:30, Saturday afternoon, October 9,
1999, I finished a brief conversation with my friend, Alysia Duckler, a Portland art dealer who runs her own gallery in The Pearl district. I went outside to work and weed in the garden and it just suddenly came to me how entirely possible
viewing the future is for some people (and maybe for many people if they really just try). E = mc 2 means that the energy encased in matter moves very mysteriously, at the incredible rate of 186,000 mi./sec. X 186,000 mil/sec. That
speed, obviously, goes remarkably beyond the speed of light it is way, way fast, indeed. No wonder certain visionaries in touch with that energy can reach and read the future; their energy (or their inner connectedness thereto) makes the
mere speed of light part of the past. Look, if you send a light signal to Alysia standing 10 miles away, the energy within her body (and yours, too) is travelling at the rate of c 2 and so she might well know (or you might signal her) the
precise moment of the light sent well before the much slower bit of actual light crosses 10 miles. In fact, it just occurs to me the possibility of synergy here, with both your energy and Alysia's travelling at c 2 —an absolutely astotinding
combined quantity emanating from each party, meeting to form a greater sum I also wonder if c 2 may relate in some subtle way to the speed tread by (ok, traversed by - I'm a painter & poet; I get poetic license) protons and electrons
revolving so quickly, so oddly, at 720 "per one revolution. Thus, c 2 in pertinent part certainly travels faster/beyond the future. That is, if you believe Einstein and the most famous equation of the 20 lh century. See 7 I told you, "I bring
you the future .. ." c?
Oh, don t be so surprised. All things really are possible with God, n'est-ce pas? The ancients and pagans weren't so dim after all. You will recall, of course, that Etruscan soothsayers held official posts in ALL Roman armies as late as the
time of Julian, about 360 AD. See, Will Durant, Caesar and Christ. 1944 (Simon & Schuster, NY), p. 18. The truth is that history and human experience of all kinds is replete with examples & proof of extraordinary, awesome human
ability; religion, science, and government have all discounted and denied same, primarily from selfish motives fearing loss of power to themselves (as authorities) and to the social organization. This historic denial was all the more assisted
by the only apparenUack of objective, scientific foundation which on this page I have just supplied. Well, OK . . . "which I have just revealed." I think Einstein supplied it, without intending to do so. Sometimes it takes an artist to put on
the finishing touch(cs).
4 "FAST TIMES WITH EINSTEIN"
Newton believed in a traditional, commonplace, linear notion of time as a sort of river, always constant, always moving the same way onward flowing into "the future." Einstein differed in this, postulating that time, like space, is relative
to the situation/frame of reference of the viewer. Einstein based his 1905 Special Theory of Relativity on two postulates: that the laws of physics assume the same shape and form in all inertial frames of reference throughout the universe
and that the speed of light is constant for any observer regardless of how fast & in what direction they are moving. I, however, believe there are legitimate qualms about this constancy of lightspeed. Einstein, himself, appears to have had
no scruple in playing fast & loose with the notion, since c 2 doesn't scan very constant to me. If one subscribes to the possibility of c J , one finds a bit of light travelling a much greater distance in a second than Einstein's 1905 postulate
presages. Additionally, time, being relative, then affects the speed of light; since a second of time is relative, 186,(XH) miles per second reveals itself as a relative statement through its intimate involvement with time. I suppose I think,
then, that light and the speed of light is relative, not constant, because a second of (what we call) time is a relative statement. Yes, that is what I believe, and I think that sort of makes sense because, after all, it's not exactly written down in
stone somewhere just what a second of time is. It's a human invention like shoes or chopsticks. In that 1905 Special Theory of Relativity, the crux of the argument and all the conclusions depend upon a thought experiment involving a
hypothetical human observer moving away from a clock tower at the speed of light. However, the astute, observant & perceptive critic will note the complete extent to which the element of time here depends upon human eyes & percep
tions plus the fact that the clock tower and the face of the clock all derive from human invention and construction. Time is a human construct of the senses, perceptions, needs, brain and consciousness, not an absolute, objective entity. It
is invention and convention. There arc, of course, many different kinds of time. If you arc at a demarcation of time zone, walk across a street or cross a certain river, by convention it's a different time. Various times and seasons are vitally
important for sowing, harvesting, etc. Different times of our lives typically have varied meanings a time to live and a time to die, a time to sow and a time to reap. Time has organic meaning beyond the mechanics of viewing the hands
and face of some clock tower. Time, like beauty, may reside in the eye (the conscious, knowing eye) of the beholder. Time is an extremely useful convenience, but not necessarily an objective quantity or quality.
If time, then, slips & skips away, losing its independent, objective quality, this may modify Einstein's General Theory, which at it's simplest meaning suggests that space is time and that space-time equals matter/energy Thus, we are left
with a triumvirate, that old trinity. SpaceMatterEnergy. It just is immortally. In all this, is light the one constant, unchanging element or aspect throughout the universe, as Einstein claims? I don't think so for reasons shown above. I
also thought black holes in deep space trap A hold light. Moreover, at the subatomic level with particles travelling at 720 0 per one revolution, how would such rates affect light? Even at our ordinary sensory level, the speed of light is
subject to change. When a light ray passes through a material, its speed changes according to the angle of entry; it refracts or bends. A refractive index involving calculations from the light angles A using an equation called Snell's Law
will show how much a given material CHANGES THE SPEED OF LIGHT. All nghtee, then, if light is out as grand vizier A head honcho in charge of unchanging, unvarying constancy everywhere, what have we got? What's left to hold
us all together? Where's the glue that binds? You must know 1 wouldn't leave you guessing without throwing in my two cents.
And the winner in the great unchanging, unvarying constancy category is . . . (the tension palpably rises as the envelope is slowly opened). . . and the winner is (gasp!). . . hot, buttered popcorn. NO, NO, NO, wrong category, wrong
envelope. And the winner is ... boo/e. Ach, no!! What is this? It's all wrong. Who is responsible for these screw-ups? What a bunch of nincompoops. Finally the correct envelope. My vote for what truly characterizes the endless,
magical, cverchanging parade of waves upon the sea the eternal glue that binds, births, and energizes the universe, the Great Chain of Being from the subatomic _ Spin to the life & death of whole galaxies & star systems is — (the right
envelope, phleaze) MOTION. Change, movement, movement springing from Grace (doesn't it all?). Our world and, indeed, the whole universe is alive with motion. It's all a dance; God in Love with God's Inf i n i t e Self. La
Musique, the Dance is everywhere & involves everything. Plus change, plus la meme chose. La Danse, e'est toute.

soon moved to Bridal Veil, Oregon & our house is 1 of the few still standing in that old, abandoned mill town. Corbett Grade School, Madison High School, Portland, 1965 graduate. Reed College, BA '69, MA '70. I am represented by

My work is in various collections, like Union Bank, Phil Bronstein (editor, SF Examiner), and my friend Barbara Rockefeller (Reed '68). Speaking of Barbara, she is prodigously gifted at world currencies and invests her & clients'
money, earning 73% return for 1998 & 97% for 1997. As Rockefeller Treasury Services (Stamford, Connecticut), she arises at 4 a.m. in order to issue three newsletters daily on enigmatic, profusely technical foreign exchange issues/
international finance which I find primarily unintelligible, but if you're so inclined you can call her at w w>y : woi-ldlyinvcstor.com or bar bara@rts-forex.com. I hope my own work will prove investment-worthy, possibly resulting from my
varied authorship as much as from my visual images. Van Gogh (or Einstein, for that matter) didn't start out with a lot of recognition either. 1 like to think my art career is on on upward trajectory, but who knows? Perhaps someone out
there can read my future for me.
Well, I think I'm getting long-winded so I'll try to wrap all this up. I was relieved to hear the AFL-CIO has come to their senses this early in the game and endorsed A 1 Gore for President. With the strength of this economy and many
sound choices made by the Clinton-Gore administration, not to mention his proven experience, leadership & governing skills, I cannot help thinking he's our next President. Of course, the national media, somewhat owned & operated by
& for the rich, seems to lean toward G. Bush, as do many very wealthy Republicans. 1 hope Benjamin Franklin's timing was off when he predicted our form of government would only last about 200 years. Caveat emptor. Just ask the
Germans. For the rich to buy an election is one thing, but how annoying a shill is someone who shoots themselves in the foot via the mouth & doesn't even know it. In case you didn't notice. Bush, through labored attempts at evasion &
effusive hedging of cocain use date, inadvertently let us all know perfectly well the approximate time period when he was a user, thereby joining the legions of unconvicted felons. No other plausible explanation arises for all his fussing
over the dates except that he did, indeed, use these drugs before such & such date no wonder he's now clammed up on that topic. You know, there's really no special category YET, ANYWAY, for youthful offender exemption among
political aspirants, so if this country wants an unconvicted felon for president, let's have it consciously. At least Nixon waited until after the election. It's a short, slippery route down to the pond for us all with George professing he'd like
to go fishing with Pat Buchanan, who in his recent book stands out in stark relief as the Hitler apologist he is. The Germans might ofTer the advice of experience here, too. More tnily helpful advice is found in Agatha Christie's brilliantly
spellbinding WW II mystery-thriller, Nor M (1 941), which features the Fifth Column the enemy within as a central theme and which timely reminds us we do ourselves a grave disservice if we forget the price of freedom is constant
vigilance. Let's not wait to be surprised at Final Solutions to problems we never even considered. We have no dearth of streetcomer hucksters who for political gain will sell out freedom of expression, the First Amendment, which erects a
sacred wall between churches (and their business) and the state. See, Hugo L. Black, Majority Opinion, Everson v. fid. Of Education, 330 U.S. 1 (1947): "The First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state. That wall
must be kept high and impregnable. We could not approve the slightest breach." For a few more minutes of fame , I have no doubt, they'd throw in (or throw out) due proccss, too. The folks at the Brooklyn Museum of Art may have
more insight to add on this. I'd listen most carefully of all to what a politician leaves unspoken. 1 also conclude from all this the vicissitudes of Human Divinity ™ are strange, obscure, difficult & multi-dimensional (cryptic, elleptic &
telcological), but still worthwhile.
As for the recently-attempted partisan coup d'etat in Washington, it had all the (clap Wrappings of ersatz legalism. You may read about this attempt between the lines in a partisan vote, well supplied with pious rhetoric and conservative
church-corporate dollars, lying in the Congressional Record or fruitlessly seek references in a wilfully ignorant media studiously ignoring a misnamed witchhunt/coup, nevertheless perceived by shopkeepers & common public opinion.
American presidents have met with monumental troubles & wars, but only the best, in large measure alone, has met the Fifth Column & won; had they moved beforehand much more swiftly & employed legions of attorneys & armies
effectively to cut ofT the enemy at the knees, even Lincoln & Roosevelt had no more greatness, a quality usually undetected (or presciently discovered) when newly-minted. (See, again., Caesar & Christ ) Mr. Clinton certainly has it
right —'"Thank God for public opinion,"which I take not as an idle comment, but direct, serious & honest. I do thank God for same, and think one might do much worse than a Gore/Clinton ticket-just look at the Republicans. Yikes.
Jesse, Donald & Cybill look better & better, especially considering all the convicted/jailed felons, as Jesse Jackson points out, languishing in Texas prisons & elsewhere. How about a Cybill/Oprah or Oprah/Cybill ticket? Please don't
think I'm kidding lam not, though I thoroughly expect to vote for Mr. Gore. As an artist I must commend difficult artistry when I find it. In The Last Picture Show Ms. Shepherd bared her chest in a scene that required true courage at a
very tender age when conventional wisdom would suggest she was destroying a future career. Most Washington politicians never have to draw upon or exhibit this level of courage, yet it seems like an important qualification or at least
talisman for success in office. At the least I'd tnist her honesty much sooner than many seasoned pros I could name; that opinion doesn't even begin to credit all Oprah has overcome and done to get where she is today.
I think I really must finish, the dog needs a walk. Rough Dog previously claimed to be a corgi and now declares for pug ancestry, despite my sceptical laughter. However, if all members of the human species are at least 1/50 cousins, as
anthropologists assure, maybe I'd better take the dog more seriously. 1 think he's a pug roughly the same way Schrodinger's cat, a fixture in physics, is a cat. But speaking of the blond Ms. Shepherd, I'd like to mention I stumbled upon
what I really think is a sensational 21" century idea/carcer move for some of my favorite blonds. This moneymaker is just waiting to be scooped up by those ambitious/talented enough to enliven/expand film careers. It's fascinating/
ingenious, something akin to the scene in Singin' in the Rain when Donald O'Connor invents talking pictures. I've tried to compose a list of ladies I'd love to tell this idea: Elizabeth Taylor (didn't she wear some big blond wig in
Hammersmith is Out or other odd movie?), Mia Farrow, Annette Bening, Cybill Shepherd, Sharon Stone, Farrah Fawcctt, Faye Dunaway, Elizabeth Shuc, Olivia Newton-John, & Oprah (well, poetic license) & others who want to enhance
established film careers. I think Oprah, of this group, already has that which one needs to begin using this particular idea effectively. Though my # is not 415/206.0231, just call there & I'll get the message soon enough. This is a Valu
able, bona fide, useful, forcsighted idea, requiring business sense & ambition.
The movies often offer much enjoyment, don't they? Like the Internet, kind of a whole parallel universe. I've long felt Kim Novak was about the most underrated blond in Hollywood history. I vote her as Most Mysterious Actress
(imagery <& role) in Vertigo for her timeless portrait at once icy & passionate, filled with pathos, distant, poignant, enigmatic & ethereal. She forms a character who lives and breathes quite an unreal, unexpected reality. She & Hitchcock
create a haunting, mesmerizing movie-within-a-movie apart from the other mundane characters, like a dream or the unconscious. I doubt it was as easy as it sounds. Her uncanny ability to create other, alternate reality probably helped her
later decide to leave Hollywood & make a new life elsewhere. Amazing artistry. She's also a painter, you know. (Guilty secret: I've taken to fast-forwarding through Vertigo, watching only Kim's scenes to enjoy the movie's hypnotic,
poetic core.) I also think another blond, Mia Farrow, deserves top honor for Reckless, a bizarre/quirky comedy mix of strange humor and deep terror, set in a world all its own, where each character & situation presents its own fonnula for
learning, discovery, therapy & transcendence (including the non sequiturs). Perfect casting/quintessential acting. Maybe not my personal favorite, but I think it's the best movie, hers all-around the best acting, and Rene Norman, best
director. (Otherwise. Casablanca.) It's just my opinion & I'm eccentric, even by my own loose standards. Will Julia Roberts win Best Actress for Netting Hill? I thought maybe she did in that one scene where she stands in front of Hugh
Grant, simply asking for his love & later leaving the original Chagall. I also thought Tori Spelling won at least a supporting nomination for her scene at the end of Trick where she throws both arms around Christian Campbell's neck,
crying. Maybe it's just me, but in 2 seconds she telegraphed a rare depth suggesting personal grief & loss. I'm not much drawn to sorrow, but somehow I cannot forget Ms. Spelling's tears.
To repeat myself before going, I am an artist. I will not be squashed & nice & silent. Call me non-compliant, disruptive, subversive. I won't be quiet and I won't go quietly. I will use my gift, my divine blessing, as best I can to come to
you, to stay with you a little while and then go, leaving as much love, hope, and inspiration as I can manage. The most I want to leave is not me but you - your best self, the holy, the sacred, the poetic, the blessed, the divine you. You and
I both are some of the grand poetry and mingled elements Hawthorne writes of at the end of Chap. II in The 1 louse of Seven Gables. "Nevertheless, if we look through all the heroic fortunes of mankind, we shall find this same entangle
ment of something mean and trivial with whatever is noblest in joy or sorrow. Life is made up of marble and mud And, without all the deeper trust in a comprehensive sympathy above us, we might hence be led to suspect the insult of a
sneer, as well as an immitigable frown, on the iron countenance of fate. What is called poetic insight is the gift of discerning, in this sphere of strangely mingled elements, the beauty and the majesty which are compelled to assume a garb
so sordid." If E_mc 2 .and if the universe is filled with hydrogen composed of 1 little electron & 1 little proton both eternally spinning at the very odd rate of 720 0 per ONE Revolution then perhaps (just as likely) we are all angels who
have forgotten some heroic vow to come to earth & spread invisible wings with word & deed, our lives to live as though some god decreed. I will speak and sing and rant to urge you continue wth hope & love amidst the marble
and the mud. Please recall that sweet, iron countenance of fate has presented you your chance, your minute on the stage, your moment at the gate, the many lives and dance of worlds your living likely will enhance with gilded resonance.
OH, oh. Rough Dog! Where's the dog what about the dog? We'd better go outside now for that walk before it's too late. Be sure to look both ways before crossing the street or entering intersections (what with the way people are
driving now). And remember who owns these intellectual property rights ... I'm sending some prints of my paintings to the Storke Publications Bldg., where I hope The Daily will set them out, should you like one. They may appeal to
you as collectible who knows? If you have a cat, this paper (1 of 13,500 printed) may come in handy, or, alternatively, if music be the food of love, employ it as you like it.
