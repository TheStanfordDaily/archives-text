up and sewage got into the dining area," said freshman Jolene Muneno. "Staff was cleaning up the mess,
so they didn t let people in for about 15 minutes." However, West Lagunita Resident Fellow Richard Schup
bach said that there was now "no sense of urgency" and that the water had been cleaned up. Lagunita Din
ing Hall was also temporarily closed last year due to sewage backflow problems.
