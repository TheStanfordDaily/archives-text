# Full house in winter
## Unassigned roll dice with walk-in draw

Senior Amilia Piimji considers
herself lucky. Last year, after study
ing abroad fall quarter, she walked
into a single in Hammerskjold
House. Hut this year, Primji's story
may he a thing of the past.
With a larger than expected ma
triculation rate for the Class of 2003,
housing on campus will he tight
when students return for winter
quarter.
"We're always at peak occupancy
for winter," said Kathleen Brans
field. manager of Housing Assign
ment Services. " The deadline for fil
ing for housing is Oct. 2V. and that's
also the deadline for declaring termi
nation of residency."
Bransfield said she currently has
212 spaces available in undergradu
ate housing, hut she isn't sure how
many students won't he living in res
idences winter quarter.
"A lot of students wait until the
last minute before they fill out termi
nancy of residence cards," she said.
Those students who aren't as

signed to housing will participate in
the walk-on Draw.
"Walking is sometimes a better
option. You don't choose from the
open spots, which are sometimes in
awful places," Primji said. "You get
to choose from good spots that peo
ple dropped out from."
Bransfield agrees."Walking is
not necessarily the worst you can
do." Bransfield said. "You could
very likely get a spot in Bob. Your
best shot is at the beginning of walk
in." She hopes there will be enough
"good spots" for everyone this year.
"We don't have a lot of extra
space." Bransfield said. "But I do
want to get a huge number of termi
nation of occupancy cards," she
quipped.
She believes one reason for the
winter quarter crunch is that there is
a greater demand for women than
there is for men. Sometimes, rooms
are converted from male to female
rooms to accommodate students.
Bransfield doesn't think the pos
sibility of upperclassmen living in
Toyon Hall or Freshman / Sopho-

more College is very likely, either.
"We do have to give students pri
ority in houses such as those, but if it
came down to using them, we might
have to," Bransfield said. She and
her staff are committed to resolving
the housing crunch as quickly and
smoothly as possible.
"No one who walks on will have
to figure out where to sleep that
night," Bransfield said. "We just
want to get students settled in."
As of now, there are 12 more va
cancies this year than there were last
year.
"Last year I drew into Muhekma
Tah-Ruk. It was fine," said Laurie
Wilson, who walked on spring quar
ter. "The people who were assigned
to housing got awful places. People
walking on felt lucky."
For Wilson, knowing early on
that she would be a walk-on helped.
"You accept it. My whole draw
group went to Oxford, so we just
joked about it together. Pretty much
everyone abroad complains about it,
but I guess it's not that bad." Wilson
said.
