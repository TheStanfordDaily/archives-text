# V'ball says 'aloha' to Bears, Wahine
## Cardinal takes on Cal at home on Friday, travels to Hawaii on Sunday 
### Emily Cadei Contributing writer 
It seems the Stanford women's
volleyball team has its work cut-out
for it this weekend — after working
to defend its own impressive home
winning streak, it will goon the road
trying to put a stop to someone
else's.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL

■ Today: No. 7 Stanford (15-2, 8-1
Pacific 10 Conference) vs. Califor
nia (8-10, 3-6 Pac-10). 7 p.m.,
Maples Pavilion. RADIO: K.ZSIJ
(90.1 FM).

■ Sunday: Stanford at llniversity of
I lawaii (16-0,5-0 WA(').

In a busy three days, the No. 7
Cardinal (15-2. 8-1 Pacific 10 Con
ference) will look to add to its 36-
match home winning streak against
the California Golden Bears (8-10,
3-6) this Friday at Maples before
traveling to Hawaii on Sunday to
take on No. 2 University of Hawaii
(16-0. 5-0). a team that has won 31
straight home matches.
Coming off an enormous non
conference win against the No. 3
I Jniversity of the Pacific, Stanford
has made the statement that the Car
dinal is once again a force to be reck
oned with on the national scene.
I he upset victory gives the team a
surge of momentum as it wraps up its
four-game homestand and heads out
on the road.
As senior outside hitter Sarah
( lark explained, " I he win — being
able to pull it out in five gives us a
10l ol confidence. I leading into this
weekend, we feel we can beat any
lit >dv."
It is unsure whether the Cal team

will give Stanford much of a test.
The Bears have struggled of late,
losing eight of their last 12 after a 4-2
start. However, their upset of San
Jose State Tuesday proves they are
not to he overlooked, especially with
the extra motivation of the om
nipresent Stanford-Cal rivalry.
Cal will also be spurred on by the
chance to end its abysmal 32-match
game losing streak to Stanford, its
last victory over the Card coming in
1982.
Leading the way for the Bears
will be junior outside hitter Alicia
Perry and senior outside hitter
Brook Coulter. The two players are
averaging a respectable 3.59 and
3.44 kills per game and carry much of
the offensive load for the Bears.
The match against Hawaii
promises to be a much stiller chal
lenge. After enjoying the friendly
confines of Maples Pavilion for
nearly two weeks, it will be a rude
shock for the Cardinal to have the
home-court advantage turned
against it.
The Wahine, like the Cardinal,
defend their home turf with a
vengeance. Home court or not,
I lawaii is tough to play anywhere,
being one of only two major Divi
sion I teams still unbeaten in 1999.
The Wahine have ploughed
through most of the competition,
with only Loyola Marymount ex
tending them to five games.
Playing at Stan Sheriff Stadium,
the site of this year's NCAA Final
Four, should serve as a mini postsea
son preview for the Cardinal, whet
ting their appetites for the real thing.
But first they must get through a
team whom they are 8-15 all-time
against. The Wahine will look to se
nior middle blocker I leather Brown

to set the tone defensively, but have
strong players at every position. The
team as a whole will be motivated to
exact revenge on the Cardinal for
defeating them the past four times
the teams have met.

Stanford, however, is not the
least bit intimidated. After its last
victory, the Cardinal feels ready for
anything, as Clark sums up by ex
claiming confidently. "We'll be able
to keep this momentum going."
