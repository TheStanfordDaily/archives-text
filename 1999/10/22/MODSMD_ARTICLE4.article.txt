# Students urge Casper to intervene in dispute
## Protest supports workers 
### Jennifer Stewart Staff writer 
Bike traffic slowed to a halt, and
students exiting Green Library's
Bing Wing stopped to stare as over 50
students and union members
marched toward University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper's office, as part
of a lunchtime rally held yesterday.
The march was part of a protest
organized by the Stanford Labor Ac
tion Coalition over the continuing
contract negotiations between
UCSF-Stanford Hospitals and Ser
vice Employees International Union
715.
Protesters hoped to deliver a let
ter to Casper, in which they urged
him to use his influence to end the 10-
month-old contract dispute.
Casper was not in his office when
protesters convened outside. Stu
dents gave his representative their
prepared letter and listened to a
statement prepared by Casper. In his
statement, Casper said management
of Stanford University is "wholly sep
arate" from management of UCSF-
Stanford Health Care.
Protesters argued that Casper has
more power over the negotiations
than he will admit.
"The hospital and the University
are separate, but Casper is on the
Board of Directors of the hospital
this is part of the same community,"
Eli Naduris-Weissman, a coalition
member, said.

Senior Brooke Atherton. a mem
ber of SLAC, concurred. "1 le is one
of 16 on the board of directors; he is
one of three on the executive board.
Doesn't that translate into a right to
comment?" Atherton said.
The protest began at noon in
White Plaza, where students and
union members fired up the crowd
before marching to Casper's office in
the quad.
Robert Valenzuela, an SEIU 715
union representative, warned the
crowd of the effects of the prolonged
contract negotiation.
"1 can tell you patient care is af
fected. I have up to 50 patients my
self. Y our mother, your sister | may be
a patient] — God forbid— and then
you will see how care is affected."
He then urged students to stand
up for workers' rights. "Thanks to
your support; the fight is not over
yet."
Protesters were led to Casper's of
fice by six women wearing bandan
nas over their faces and red-cloth an
arch) symbols pinned to their shirts.
Continuing Negotiations
The contract dispute between
Union 715 and UCSF-Stanford is 10
months old. Union officials allege
that UCSF-Stanford has not cooper
ated during the bargaining process.
"Hospital administrators are not
negotiating fairly and are drawing the
process out and trying to squeeze

everything out of workers they can
get," said Naduris-Weissman.
The bargaining process is not
easy, said Valenzuela. "Stanford
University does not want us to have a
fair contract. They don't want to see
the union succeed," he said.
"We voted to be a union ... and
they fought us tooth and nail." Valen
zuela said. "They dragged Cesar
Chavez through coals."
Fe Zaragoza, a member of the ne
gotiating committee and a certified
nursing assistant and a unit secretary,
said workers are demanding relative
ly little in the negotiations.
"What we want is a fair contract,"
she said. "We have three main issues:
wages, non-interference in unioniza
tion efforts and a union shop."
UCSF Stanford Hospital
spokesman Mike Lassiter said
[UCSF-Stanford] has offered Union
715 members salaries equal to what it
has offered to other employees.
"UCSF-Stanford Health Care has
successfully negotiated contracts
with each of its four other unions,"
said Casper, "contracts that were rec
ommended by the unions' negotiat
ing teams and ratified by their mem
bers."
Lassiter agreed that negotiations
have continued for "some time."
"We are hopeful a contract can be
reached as soon as possible," he said.
Student support
Students said they attended the
rally to show their support of the
workers.
"Something had to be done." said
Jenice Wilson, a sophomore.
"This is a simple step, and it didn't
cost much on our part and hopefully,
it will bring about change," said
Edjah Nduom, also a sophomore.
Workers in turn said they appreci
ated the student's actions.
"Support is great," Zaragonaz
said. "For students to come out and
show support is a nice gesture. It is
special. It shows students understand
our needs."

The next step
The continuing contract negoti
ations between UCSF-Stanford
and the union are only one area of
trouble for the hospital systems.
The merger's future remains un
certain. while the presidents of the
UC system and Stanford decide its
fate.
" These workers have been try
ing to get a contract before the
merger became a crisis," Naduris-
Weissman said. "What the workers
have been asking for — the work
ers' right for a fair contract
should not be a causality of the
merger."
RayChicano Docena.a hospital
worker and a union member, said
the merger likely played a role in
Casper's lack of intervention in the

contract negotiation.
"The merger has turned into a
nightmare, and he is trying to wash
his hands," he said. "As a member
of the Board, he has accountabili
ty"
Protesters say the next move is
up to Casper.
"We gave him the letter and
asked for response. Now we are
waiting for Casper to respond in
some form," Naduris-Weissman
said.
"We have to see how negotia
tions go," he said. "We feel that
Casper has to take some action in
trying to get the contract settled."
"We don't want student input to
be disregarded. We will not let
Casper forget our message," said
Atherton.
