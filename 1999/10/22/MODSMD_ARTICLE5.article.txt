# Prestigious science grant has ties to Stanford
## Granting help with research 
### Carolyn Liu 
Dan Boneh. assistant professor of Computer Science,
and I longjue Dai, assistant professor of Chemistry, were
each awarded $625,000 from the David and Lucile
Packard Foundation on Oct. 13.
The Packard Fellowship, highly regarded within the
national scientific community, is given annually to out
standing university faculty across the country. It pro
vides award-winners with a budget of $125,000 a year for
five years to study any area of science or engineering
they choose.
"Freedom is the key word here," said Franklin Orr,
dean of the School of Harth Sciences at Stanford and
chairman of the advisory panel that selected the winners.
"The whole program was designed from the very be
ginning to find excellent young faculty and to give them
support to pursue the direction they feel is most impor
tant," Orr said. "We did our best to choose out of KM)
nominees 24 of the best young faculty in the nation in sci
ence and engineering, and give them support with free
dom [to choose their own area of research]."
Dai. who is currently researching nanoscale materi
als. appreciates the flexibility the grant offers.
"With this grant I can go into new topics, because it's
unrestricted. I actually have a few other grants on the
$100,000 order, but they're restricted to more specific
projects." he said.
Dai plans on allocating a large part of the award to his
research team. "The money will be mostly used to sup
port graduate students and postdoctoral associates. The
people are the most important part of our research." he
said. "If we have extra money we might buy some equip
ment. like chemicals, accessories for the lab. electron
ics." Dai added.
I lis research team is studying the properties of "very
small wires made out of carbon-carbon nanowires," Dai
said.
"We're synthesizing and categorizing small particles

and small wires, for the purpose of fundamental sci
ence." he said. But it is very possible that society will also
benefit from these studies. According to Dai. this re
search may be used in conjunction with microelectronics
devices and chemical sensors.
Dai said the grant's biggest impact is the extra finan
cial boost it has given him for his research.
"This grant is definitely encouraging and very gener
ous. 1 think the normal amount [of a science / engineer
ing research grant is) on the order of $1(K),(KK) for two or
three years, typically. It's very difficult to get a grant this
si/e by other means."
Boneh's area of research is computer security and
cryptography. Boneh was unavailable for comment.
The large size of the grant obviously correlates with
the selection process the winners undergo, which, ac
cording to Orr, is rigorous and lengthy. Each year, the
foundation asks approximately 50 universities to nomi
nate as many as two faculty members each. About 1(K)
names are submitted to the advisory panel, which con
sists of nationally renowned scientists and engineers.
They rank the candidates to organize the review process,
then discusses each candidate's two-page statement de
scribing his research and the letters of recommendation.
"I feel (the statement of research] is actually hard to
write because it's only two pages," Orr said.
The actual process often requires making difficult
choices based on fine lines, Orr said.
"We try to decide if the award will make a difference
and il the work proposed is of absolutely the highest
level." he said. "You can imagine what kind of process it
is if you're trying to compare a molecular biologist with
a computer scientist with a condensed matter physicist."
However, despite the tough decision-making in
volved. Orr strongly feels that the selection discussion is
"the best meeting I go to all year, because it has a scien
tific range that goes from the evolution of the dinosaurs
to the origin of the world to RNA and how it makes us
all tick."
