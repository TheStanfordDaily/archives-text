### Marisa Pavlik Staff writer 
The six-month process of approving the
ASSU Constitutional Amendment conclud
ed last night at the Undergraduate Senate
meeting. The Senate ratified President Ger
hard Casper's interpretations to last spring's
amendment, the final step after the Graduate
Student Council ratification on Wednesday.

"l'm happy to see the will of the students
enacted." Senate chair Steven Aronowitz, se
nior. said, referring to the SO percent under
graduate vote and 97 percent graduate vote
that the amendment received last spring.
"This makes the US and the GSC the offi
cial representative bodies of the ASSU."
ASSU President Mike Levin, a junior, said.
"After months of discussion regarding our
new structure, it is our firm belief that the

ASSU now has the ability to serve both un
dergraduate and graduate students like never
before."
The University President has the right to
reject the amendment, accept it outright or
accept it with conditions. Aronowitz said.
Casper, a constitutional scholar, made
clarifications to the amendment in his Letter
of Acceptance, such as explicitly stating what
consensus was and correcting ballot mis

prints.
"We liked his conditions," Aronowitz said.
"I lis letters are very thorough. ... I respect
the logic behind his ideas; they're well thought
out."
"President Casper's interpretations and
conditions did not change the meaning of the
amendment, nor did they limit our ability to
best serve students. I le only wanted our stu
dent constitution to be clear and consistent,"

ASSU Vice President John Mills, a doctoral
student in genetics, said.
"Basically, we now have the structure in
place to best serve the student body," Levin
added.
Aronowitz said that the Undergraduate
Senate has been acting in anticipation of the
ratification all year. "We've already been act
ing as il it was going into effect," he said."' ITiis
was a technicality, but an important [one]."
