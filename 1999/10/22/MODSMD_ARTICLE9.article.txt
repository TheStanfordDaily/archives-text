With applications for Alterna
tive Spring Break 2(KM) hitting cam
pus Monday, Stanford's largest
community-service organization is
gearing up for another year.
Four brand-new trips, progres
sive in nature, have been added,
and participants will now be re
quired to complete a one-unit
preparatory class winter quarter.
New to the Alternative Spring
Break agenda are trips dealing with
HIV / AIDS, the U.S.-Mexico bor
der, rural issues and the media.
In San Francisco, students will
be examining how the media af
fects modern society and culture.
Students traveling to the Cali
fornia-Mexico border will analyze
the influx of immigration into the
state and its societal effects.
HIV/AIDS awareness will be
the focus of those traveling to New
York City. Students will be work
ing with different groups in the Big

Apple that deal with AIDS educa
tion.
The Willamette Valley of Ore
gon will be the setting for the study
of rural issues. Poverty, the envi
ronment and rural-urban conflict
will be focus of the week-long re
treat.
The new trips were selected by
Alternative Spring Break Coordina
tors based on proposals submitted by
prospective trip leaders. The coordi
nators themselves were chosen by
application to serve two-year terms.
This year, the program is ensur
ing that students are fully aware of
the issues they will deal with during
their trips. While in the past, only
some programs have offered a
preparatory course during winter
quarter, this year, a one-unit class
will be mandatory for all trips.
The course "builds a basic
knowledge base ... [since] these
are complex issues," said co-Coor
dinator Tammy Lee, a senior.
"(The class J makes the experience

a lot more meaningful," she added.
Facilitated by the trip leaders, the
pre-trip course will include a small
course reader, speakers and inter
action with faculty sponsors.
Alternative Spring Break de
fines itself as a "community service
/ learning" organization and is an
established program that continues
to evolve.
" The focus is still very much on
education and learning... but [this
year's trips| do invite political
thinking," said co-Coordinator Mi
randa I p. a junior.
While Ipsaid, "we want to keep
the angle mostly on service issues,"
she did state that some of the new
trips "do have more of an activist
stance."
Goals for this year'include main
taining a balance between "tradi
tional" service projects and the
newer, more progressive ones.
The purpose of Alternative
Spring Break. Ip said, is not "to at
tempt to save the world in one

week," but rather to help students
"educate themselves."
Co-Coordinator Rahul Hate, a
senior, added, "These experiences
do change one's perspective."
"(Our ideal participant is] some
body who is eager to learn," said
Hate.
A total of 12 trips will be taken
this spring, and the costs will be
largely subsidized. All Stanford
students, including students in the
graduate and professional schools,
can apply.
The out-of-pocket cost for stu
dents is $95. along with a commit
ment to work one Stanford Fund
shift.
Ten students will be allowed per
trip, and applications for Spring
2000 Alternative Spring Break will
be available starting Oct. 25. They
may be picked up at the I iaas Cen
ter, and the deadline to submit ap
plications is Nov. 10.
"It really is a week that lasts a
lifetime," stated I late.
