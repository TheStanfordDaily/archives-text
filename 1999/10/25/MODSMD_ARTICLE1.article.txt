# Season tix sold on line; 2,000 buy from home

### Jim Tankersley Senior staff writer 
No one pitched a tent or slept in
line, but a record number of Stan
ford students bought men's basket
ball season tickets last week.
From the comfort of their home
computers. 2,000 students bought
$10 "Justarrive Cards" — unguar
anteed tickets that only allow the
first 1,200 fans into most home
games— for the 1999-2000 season.
More than 90 percent of them paid
an extra $15 to join the Sixth Man
Club.
Last year. 1.600 students slept
for a week in the Maples Pavilion
ticket line, a campout that Athlet
ics Department officials ended by
awarding tickets to 75 percent of
each group in line. Earlier this
month, the department announced
a new ticketing system that elimi
nates lines and puts no cap on the
number of students who can buy
unguaranteed season tickets.
Men's Basketball Marketing
Coordinator John Hopkins said
the high number of students with
season passes should increase at

tendance at early season games,
which are traditionally less popu
lar. and benefit students in the
process.
"1 want to protect our student
seats by getting people in there,"
he said. When students skip early
games, "there's more pressure for
us to sell those seats to the general
public."
Under the new system, students
pay for tickets on a game-by-game
basis, either by check or credit card
deductions. The maximum price
any student can pay for the season
is $55. the same as last year.
For each game they attend, stu
dents earn 10 Fanaddict points,
which a database will record.
When the opponents traditionally
most popular with fans — a list that
this year includes Arizona. UCLA
and California — come to town,
fans with the most points earn
guaranteed seating.
Before each of those games.
I lopkins will examine the database
and set a cut-off line, with the goal
of granting guaranteed seating to
the 600 to 1,000 fans with the most
points from games attended.
Students can grab the rest of the
seats on a first-come, first-served
basis.
Hopkins said the fact that 1,850
students bought Sixth Man mem
berships, which give fans access to a
courtside cheering section, sur
prised him.
The large number could mean

more devoted fans willing to arrive
early for games, he said.
Athletics officials will allow stu
dents to start lining up at 6 a.m. on
game days, and I lopkins said some
fans might show up that early for
the season-opening exhibition Oct.
31 against Marathon Oil.
The department originally an
nounced it would only sell student
season passes from Oct. 18-21.
However, Hopkins said Friday
sales will continue throughout the
year on the Web at www.gostan
