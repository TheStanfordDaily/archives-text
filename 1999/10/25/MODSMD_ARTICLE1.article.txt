No one pitched a tent or slept in
line, but a record number of Stan
ford students bought men's basket
ball season tickets last week.
From the comfort of their home
computers. 2,000 students bought
$10 "Justarrive Cards" — unguar
anteed tickets that only allow the
first 1,200 fans into most home
games— for the 1999-2000 season.
More than 90 percent of them paid
an extra $15 to join the Sixth Man
Club.
Last year. 1.600 students slept
for a week in the Maples Pavilion
ticket line, a campout that Athlet
ics Department officials ended by
awarding tickets to 75 percent of
each group in line. Earlier this

number of students who can buy
unguaranteed season tickets.
Men's Basketball Marketing
Coordinator John Hopkins said

process.
"1 want to protect our student
seats by getting people in there,"
he said. When students skip early
games, "there's more pressure for
us to sell those seats to the general
public."
Under the new system, students
pay for tickets on a game-by-game
basis, either by check or credit card
deductions. The maximum price
any student can pay for the season
is $55. the same as last year.
For each game they attend, stu
dents earn 10 Fanaddict points,
which a database will record.
When the opponents traditionally
most popular with fans — a list that
this year includes Arizona. UCLA
and California — come to town,
fans with the most points earn
guaranteed seating.
Before each of those games.
I lopkins will examine the database
and set a cut-off line, with the goal
of granting guaranteed seating to
