### 
GROZNY. Russia (AP) â€” Rus
sian warplanes and artillery pum
meled towns around Grozny and
other parts of Chechnya on Sunday,
and Chechen officials claimed at
least 39 people had been killed and
dozens more injured in the attacks.
The Russian military acknowl
edged it fired missiles at targets
around the towns of Bamut and
Achkoi-Martan, but said they were
aimed at rebel military positions.
Chechen leaders again called for
peace talks with Russia, demanding
they be held on neutral territory
with international mediation.
"The conditions for the peace
talks are a cease-fire and the with

drawal of Russian troops from
Chechnya, or Russia's complete
capitulation," Chechen Vice Presi
dent Vakha Arsanov told The
Associated Press.
The Chechen military reported
that the Russians "heavily pound
ed" villages to the north and east of
the capital, Grozny. It said that a
pre-dawn Russian rocket attack on
the town of Vedeno, 18 miles south
east of the capital, had killed 23 peo
ple and wounded 58.
Russian artillery also targeted
the village of Samashki, near
Chechnya's western border, killing
16 people and wounding 41 others,
the Chechens said.

The casualty figures could not be
confirmed, and the Russian com
mand did not offer any estimates of
its own. It stressed that the attacks
were aimed at militants rather than
civilians.
The Chechens did not say if the
casualties included rebel fighters.
"The militants are strengthening
their positions," said Col. Gennady
Alyokhin, a Russian military
spokesman, and Russian troops are
responding with "some artillery
strikes against the rebels' bases."
The Chechen military command
claimed its fighters downed an 11-20
Russian reconnaissance plane
overnight with a Stinger missile.

after shooting down two warplanes
Saturday. The Russian air force
vehemently denied losing any of its
planes in recent days.
Grozny was calm Sunday,
though most people ventured out of
basement bomb shelters only to
cook food on campfires in the
streets. Electricity and gas in the city
have been shut off.
Some residents shopped for food
at the city's central open-air market,
which reopened Sunday after a
Thursday night bombing that killed
at least 143 people. But they didn't
linger, fearing Russian attacks.
A group of Russian leaders from
regions surrounding Chechnya

pressed for negotiations to end the
fighting.
Ruslan Aushev. the president of
neighboring Ingushetia, said that
the leaders had met Saturday and
called for Asian Maskhadov, the
Chechen president, to meet with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin or
with Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin, the Interfax news agency
reported.
Russian officials have repeatedly
balked at suggestions for negotia
tions. saying the war is aimed
against terrorists. Russia sent troops
into Chechnya at the end of
September, ostensibly to wipe out
militants who invaded neighboring

Dagestan this summer and were
blamed for a series of apartment
explosions in Russia that killed
some 3(H) people.
But the Russian offensive
increasingly appears aimed at
restoring Russian control over
Chechnya.
Aushev said that some 169,7(X)
Chechens had taken shelter in
Ingushetia, and that the republic
was "suffocating under such a tide
of refugees," Interfax reported.
Still, he said he would protest the
Russian military's closing of a road
linking Chechnya with Ingushetia
on Saturday, saying it was the "main
corridor for refugees."
