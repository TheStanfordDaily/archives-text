Improved guidance for
new students starts with
faculty participation

For the 1,750 freshmen who have
begun their intellectual journeys at
Stanford this fall, receiving the
right academic advice at the right time
can he crucial. However, the current
freshman advising system — restricted to
one-time quarterly advising dinners and
frantic calls the night before the approval
code for filing study list is due — does not
truly cater to the needs of new students.
The matter is of concern especially
because the guidance that incoming stu
dents receive during their first year can be
instrumental in formulating future aca
demic paths. The lack of an appropriate
form of personal mentorship during this
formative period could cause freshmen to
lose a sense of direction, leading their
future academic experience at Stanford to
go awry.
The disparity in the level of advising is
particularly noticeable by the varying lev
els (academic or otherwise) which the
advisers represent. While a lew advisers
are indeed departmental professors, a
large proportion of "faculty" advisers
actually are graduate students, members
of the administration and other members
of the community.
If the purpose of advisers is to serve as
intellectual role-models and provide guid
ance regarding long-range academic
paths, having such students and adminis
trators serve as "faculty advisers" might
detract from the educational experiences
that impressionable freshmen look for
ward to.
Why is this the case? With Stanford
having such a large contingency of some
of the world's best faculty, it seems ironic
that there is a dearth of actual faculty
advisers, and incoming students continue
to get genetically clubbed together in
large advising groups, reducing their
chances of personalized contact with aca
demics who are at the cutting edge of
their intellectual fields.

It seems that while some faculty readi
ly volunteer, others are unwilling to
advise freshmen on the pretext of the
research and teaching commmitments
that they already have. But such an apa
thetic attitude on the part of faculty does
not take into consideration the greater
intellectual merits of undergraduate
advising.
Advising and mentoring are essential
(and often some of the most rewarding)
ingredients of the teaching process and
should be viewed as such. Mentoring an
undergraduate does not necessarily rep
resent an extraordinary amount of time
commitment.
Being an advisor for new students can
also pay off in the longer run. For exam
pic, the academic connections that are
built between students and faculty can
also help faculty members spot potential
research assistants for their ongoing pro
jects.
The Undergraduate Advising Center
(IJAC) should make the effort to take a
greater role in this process by actively
recruiting faculty members who have yet
to serve as undergraduate advisors. Cur
rent faculty who serve as freshman advis
ers should also play their part to encour
age their colleagues to consider serving as
advisers. Such experiences have the
potential to only further complement
Stanford's new undergraduate initiatives
— be they the Introductory Seminars or
Sophomore College.
Forming such mentoring relationships,
along with the greater interaction that it
involves, is ultimately the only way to
realize the pedagogical ideology that
Stanford has been striving to achieve. Stu
dents and faculty at Stanford are here to
learn together rather than by themselves
faculty stand to gain from the new per
spectives that incoming students repre
sent as much as students do from the col
lective wisdom of their mentors.
II each faculty member at Stanford can
take on the onus of mentoring an under
graduate, we would have taken that first
important step in imbibing within our
selves the "love of learning" that we are
here for.
