Don 7 preach bike safety
Renee Canada's bike safety column
reminded me why I spent my undergradu
ate and currently my graduate school years
far from my hometown — to be away from
Mommy.
Not only does the advice given seem to
speak down to even those not old enough to
be in college (i.e "And finally, have fun!"),
but she admits early that she doesn't even
follow her own advice. Are we supposed to
all don helmets now, while our Safety 101
professor flaunts her shiny hair as she care
fully coasts through White Plaza?
Let's reserve the space on the Opinions
page for writing that is thoughful and cre
ative rather than instructive. I take enough
classes already.
