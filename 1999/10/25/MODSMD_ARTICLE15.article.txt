# The 						upward spiral
## Govind Dandekar U.S. News is a big fat idiot 
### 
U.S. News and
World Report is
a second-rate
news publication that
lacks the substance of the
Economist, the circula
tion of Newsweek and the
free gift watch of Time.

Yet every September, college administra
tors, alumni, current collegians and high
school seniors collectively hold their
breath until U.S. News releases its much
publicized university rankings.
These administrators, alumni, students
and seniors then descend upon their local
Barnes and Noble like a Biblical pestilence
and purchase every copy of U.S. News in
sight. They return home to revel in or
decry their beloved school's rank, or in the
case of the seniors, fire off applications to
the top five or six schools and one safety
school (Duke). Sadly, this behavior rein
forces U.S. News' commitment to its mis
leading ranking survey.
Stanford President Gerhard Casper has
been a harsh critic of the U.S. News rank
ings. In September of 1996, Casper sent an
open letter to James Fallows, former edi
tor of U.S. News. The letter points out the
many suspicious aspects of the rankings.
Casper notes that universities "change
very slowly," but the year-to-year variabil
ity of the rankings cause readers to
"believe that university quality pops up
and down like politicians in a poll." He
points out that Columbia's rank was No. 9
in 1994, No. 15 in 1995 and No. 11 in 1996.
A logical question arises: which one of
these ranks is correct? This dramatic vari
ance severely undermines the credibility of

the system.
Casper concludes his letter by imploring
Fallows to do away with the "football
ranking mentality and ... inform rather
than mislead your readers."
U.S. News has not only continued its
dubious ranking system, but it is now mili
tantly defending its methodology. In last
year's college rankings issue. Nicholas
Lemann defends U.S. News by stating
"American higher education itself regular
ly uses numerical rankings, especially of
potential students, as a basic tool."
Lemann's argument is simple: i! universi
ties rank students, why can't U.S. News
rank universities?
U.S. News' reductionist counter-argu
ment is as inept and inaccurate as the mag
azine's ranking methodology. It is true that
universities rank potential applicants.
However, most universities rank appli
cants in broad groups.
For example, Stanford ranks applicants
in one of three groups: accepted, wait-list
ed or rejected. No admissions officer
would attempt to comment on the relative
talent and ability of students within each
group.
U.S. News fails to realize that universi
ties, like students, cannot be discretely
ranked. Perhaps the 25 schools that U.S.
News deems "first-tier" school do consti
tute America's 25 best undergraduate insti
tutions. However, the subtle differences
and intangibles that differentiate these
schools are statistically immeasurable.
Furthermore, no sane individual,
including any editor of U.S. News, would
suggest that there should be some national
ranking of all college-bound high school

seniors available for public perusal. Yet.
this is exactly how U.S. News treats Amer
ica's post-secondary institutions.
It is clear that U.S. News does a great
disservice to its readers and the colleges
and universities which it ranks. Unfortu
nately, it does not appear that U.S. News
will discontinue its practices any time soon.
Here is how Stanford University and its
students should respond.
The University: Stanford has already
created a Web site that offers data identi
cal to the statistics presented in U.S. News.
Stanford should better publicize this site
and collaborate with other universities in
the construction of a site that offers rele
vant statistics not just for Stanford but all
comparable American universities.
The Students: Students should stop pur
chasing the U.S. News rankings issue. This
issue is perennially U.S. News' best-selling
issue of the year. Last year you probably
contributed to the sales by sprinting to the
nearest newsstand, buying the magazine,
flipping to the proper page and exclaiming.
"Number six? We should be No. 1, but
thank God those morons didn't rank us
behind Duke again!" or "What the ?
Caltech is No. 1!?"
Who knows how far U.S. News will go
to increase circulation and make a profit?
Next year the magazine could begin rank
ing "Major World Religions and Regional
Cults." How upset will you be when you
find out that your regional cult is ranked
sixth (behind Duke)?
