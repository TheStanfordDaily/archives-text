# Student consultants trained to offer advice
## New lab helps students master speaking skills

Stanford's Oral Communication
Program, established by the Oral
Communications Lab last winter, is
starting its first full year of offering
students assistance with public
speaking.
The lab. which is designed to aid
students with presentations and
communication skills, for the first
time placed Oral Communication
Consultants in dorms during this
year's Sophomore College and in
Freshman / Sophomore College.
Dr. Doree Allen, the head of the
Oral Communication Program, has
trained numerous students in her
course, "Teaching Public Speaking,"
to work as consultants.
Fhe main purpose of the course is
to teach consultants how to share
speaking techniques with students
that need their help.
Those who complete the course
are also eligible to work with specific
seminars or classes on campus which
include an integral public-speaking
component.
Consultants are available in the
lab during hours that are announced
in a Daily advertisement every week.
However, personal appointments

can also be scheduled.
Consultants are trained to listen
to and observe student presentations
and provide feedback. They offer
suggestions on how to control anxi
ety and help students develop visual
aids, provide handouts andean even
videotape a student's presentation.
John Bilderbeck, the coordinator
of the lab, said the most important
role a consultant can play is "giving
students at Stanford a place to go
when they need an objective ear for
feedback on a presentation."
The lab is open to people of all
public-speaking abilities. Though
consultants are trained to give basic
advice on aspects such as eye contact
and volume, they can also help with
the overall structure of a presenta
tion.
Improving speaking skills is a goal
of the University, according to
Bilderbeck. He said students might
soon find a Speaking in the Major
component, required for certain ma
jors, similar to the Writing in the
Major requirement.
Bilderbeck said there will be an
increased emphasis on public speak
ing on campus, as public speaking
skills have become just as important
as writing skills in the job market.
