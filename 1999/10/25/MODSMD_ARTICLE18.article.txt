### Elizabeth Cha 
For the fifth year in a row, the
Stanford Gay and Lesbian Alumni
Club is accepting applications for two
summer internships at public service
organizations, with a focus on issues
affecting the gay, lesbian and bisexu
al community.
Students who will return to Stan
ford for one or more years are eligi
ble, and the interns are each given a
$2,500 stipend.
"I really believe that the GALA
internship is an exciting extension of
the positive changes in undergradu
ate education at Stanford," said Rob
Burrington, a GALA board member
and a member of the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Center ad
visory board, which has helped coor
dinate this program.
"They provide an opportunity
that was not available when I was
here in the '60s for a student to go out
into the 'real world' to explore, to
question, to get excited about the fu
ture and then bring that energy back
to Stanford in the fall," he said.
GALA started the internship pro

gram five years ago to serve the les
bian, gay, bisexual, transgender and
questioning ('L(iBTQ') community.
That first year, the Stanford Alumni
Association selected interns to ex
plore a career in public service by
working at the Community United
Against Violence in San Francisco.
Previously, students interested in
working for public organizations that
dealt with issues affecting the gay and
lesbian community had to volunteer,
as there were very few paid opportu
nities during the summer.
When GALA took over the selec
tion process in 19%, it began to ask
applicants to include their own pro
posals to work at any organization
that would serve the LGBTQ com
munity. The following year, GALA
had raised enough money to fund
two such internships.
As all financial support for the in
ternships comes from alumni, many
GALA fundraisers throughout the
year are designed for this goal.
Past interns have spent the sum
mer all over the world, including edu
cating on HIV prevention in Santa
Clara County and encouraging

schools to provide a safe environ
ment for lesbian, gay and bisexual
students with Democrat Speaker Pro
Tem Sheila Kuehl, the first openly
lesbian member of the California
State Assembly.
One of last year's recipients, ju
nior Sarah Guy, was an intern at NE
PAIDS. the AIDS Prevention Stud
ies Nucleus in Sao Paulo, Brazil,
where she worked on a prevention
project for gay men. She provided
street outreach at gay bars and taught
about sexual identity and health is
sues at community centers.
"The different cultural and politi
cal climate of Brazil truly deepened
my understanding of marginalized
sexualities and enhanced my vision of
what working for sexual empower
ment should be about." Guv said.
Junior Emilie Eagan returned to
her hometown of Salt Lake City to
lead educational programs such as
National HIV Testing Day and
Chlamydia Testing and Education
Month to promote awareness
through the Gay and Lesbian Com
munity Center of Utah.
Eagan said she was grateful to

learn about the management behind
small, non-profit organizations.
"I was able to see how queer orga
nizing in a culturally eonservative and
sometimes hostile environment can
be sustained and successful," she
said.
Selected interns relate their expe
riences at the annual GALA home
coming dinner the October following
the summer of their internships.
They are also asked to compose a
write-up of their experience which
will be printed in the GALA newslet
ter and may be posted on the GALA
Web site.
The GALA board members who
review the applications said they look
closely at the particular assignment
proposed by the application to see if
it indicates a definite purpose that
serves the LGBTQ community.
Applications are currently avail
able at the Lesbian Gay Bisexual
Community Center or online at
http://www.stanfordclub.org/stan
fordclub/GALA.
Applications should be submitted
at the LGBCC or the Dean of Stu
dent's Office by March I, 2000.
