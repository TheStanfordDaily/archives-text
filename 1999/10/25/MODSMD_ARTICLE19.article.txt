### Meredith Rowe Editorial staff 
Martha Press, a longtime Stanford sports
booster and unofficial "mother" to professional
journalists involved in the John S. Knight Fellow
ship Program, passed away Oct. 6 due to lung can
cer. She was 81.
Press, a San Diego native, grew up in Colum
bus, Ohio, and graduated from Ohio State Uni
versity with a degree in journalism. From there,
she edited a weekly newspaper for a year, taught
at an elementary school and eventually joined the
Women's Army Corps at the outbreak of World
War 11.
She met her husband, I iarry Press, at an Army
administration school in Maryland. The two mar
ried in 1944 and moved to the Bay Area, where
Harry Press worked at the San Francisco News
(no longer in print) and Martha Press raised their

three children.
When Harry Press became managing director
of the Knight Fellowship Program, which pro
vides year-long study grunts to professional jour
nalists, Martha Press began helping fellows and
their families adjust to life in the Bay Area.
In an Oct. 22 San Jose Mercury News article,
David Early, one of those fellows in 1979-80, said
Martha Press was warm and welcoming to his
family.
"One of the real happy memories was when
Martha would have an ice-cream social," he said.
"My daughter is now 28, and she has a vivid mem
ory of eating at those ice-cream socials."
Martha Press also worked part-time in book
keeping and writing advertisements for a real es
tate company.
Daughter Lindi Press described her mother as
someone always eager to lend a hand.
"She was active with the PTA, she was substi

lute teaching, she worked with the Little League,"
Lindi Press said in the Mercury News article. "She
wasn't a big mover and shaker, but she was always
helping."
In addition to helping out Knight fellows.
Martha Press was an avid Stanford sports fan. She
and her husband attended nearly every Stanford
baseball game for the past 15 years.
Also, the Presses held season tickets for Stan
ford football and women's volleyball and basket
ball.
They traveled often, visiting the fellows as well
as undergraduate students who they called their
"spare kids."
Friends and family described Martha Press as
"a soft touch with an iron will." Nearly 40 years
ago, she defeated thyroid cancer and six years ago
underwent a bout of breast cancer.
Martha Press is survived by her husband, chil
dren and other family members.
