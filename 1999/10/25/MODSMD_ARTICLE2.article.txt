Stanford is not alone in its

search for a new
president, in
light of Presi

Casper's Sep

ilounc e m en t
that he will be
resigning his
position, effective

August of 2000.
This year, three other major uni
versities find themselves in the
same position â€” in search of a
leader for the new millennium.
According to an article in the
Sept. 24 issue of The Chronicle of
Higher Education, these universi
ties may find themselves compet
ing for the same candidates as each
begins their search.
The University of Chicago will
lose its president. Hugo F. Sonnen

With the top positions at four
major universities open, many
wonder if Stanford's search for a
new president will be affected by

competition.
Competition may he still
According to the Chronicle of
Higher Education, executive
search consultants say that, given
the number of spots open, "the
competition for candidates may be
stiff"
This does not seem to be a major
concern for Stanford, however.
"Each institution has its own

special qualities, und a well con
ducted search tries to match those
with the experience and the abili
ties of the candidates," said Prof, of
Biological Sciences and former
University President Donald
Kennedy.
"Knowledge of the institution
matters," Kennedy continued, re
ferring to the practice of choosing
candidates who have some degree
of familiarity with the university
considering them. "Thus, although
there might be some overlap in the
pools, it's unlikely that it would be
extensive."
Casper concurred.
"While universities are clearly
competing for presidential talent,
the historical situation and the
needs at any particular institution
at any given point in time tend to
differ, never mind differences be
tween public and private institu
tions," he said.
Kennedy, too. noted the impor
tance of the distinction between
public and private institutions.
