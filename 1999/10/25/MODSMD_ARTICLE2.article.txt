Stanford is not alone in its

search for a new
president, in
light of Presi
dent Gerhard
Casper's Sep
tember an
ilounc e m en t
that he will be
resigning his
position, effective

August of 2000.
This year, three other major uni
versities find themselves in the
same position â€” in search of a
leader for the new millennium.
According to an article in the
Sept. 24 issue of The Chronicle of
Higher Education, these universi
ties may find themselves compet
ing for the same candidates as each
begins their search.
The University of Chicago will
lose its president. Hugo F. Sonnen

Vanderbilt University will also

With the top positions at four
major universities open, many
wonder if Stanford's search for a
new president will be affected by

competition.
Competition may he still
According to the Chronicle of
Higher Education, executive
search consultants say that, given
the number of spots open, "the
competition for candidates may be
stiff"
This does not seem to be a major
concern for Stanford, however.
"Each institution has its own

special qualities, und a well con
ducted search tries to match those
with the experience and the abili
ties of the candidates," said Prof, of
Biological Sciences and former
University President Donald
Kennedy.
"Knowledge of the institution
matters," Kennedy continued, re
ferring to the practice of choosing
candidates who have some degree
of familiarity with the university
considering them. "Thus, although
there might be some overlap in the
pools, it's unlikely that it would be
extensive."
Casper concurred.
"While universities are clearly
competing for presidential talent,
the historical situation and the
needs at any particular institution
at any given point in time tend to
differ, never mind differences be
tween public and private institu
tions," he said.
Kennedy, too. noted the impor
tance of the distinction between
public and private institutions.


Casper
"Public institutions tend to look
for different kinds of leaders: they
are more apt to bring presidents in
from outside," he said. "Partly be
cause of the increasingly political
nature of state governing boards,
there has been a general How of
presidents away from publics to pri
vates: in recent years. Princeton,
Dartmouth, Brown, IJSC and Cor
nell have recruited presidents away
from larger public universities."
'An unusually attractive job'
Although Stanford's new presi
dent could potentially begin his or
her new term facing a number of
difficult situations, such as the Stan
ford-UCSF Hospitals merger,
many hold that the Stanford presi
dency is one of the best positions

available.
Because of the University's spe
cific needs, Kennedy said, "Not
only will Stanford he looking at a
subset of the possible candidates, it
offers an unusually attractive job."
Shelly Weiss Storbeck, a manag
ing director of college-presidential
searches at A.T.

Kearney Execu
tive Search,said
in the Chroni
cle, "Stanford is
one of the best
opportunities
out there, but it
will be a com
petitive mar
ket."

Based on such predictions, some
also believe that the issue of time
will play a central role in the presi
dential searches.
According to the Chronicle, var
ious other news sources and

Casper, the University of Chicago
began its presidential search sever
al months ago, but it is unclear how
much progress they have made.
By contrast, the Stanford Board
will soon complete the formation of
a presidential search committee,
placing the University in the earli
est stages of its search.
"Stanford is just getting started,
but we're certainly not late,"
Kennedy said.
Similarly, although sources
quoted in the Chronicle assert that
Chicago's head start may give them
the upper hand, Casper points out
that the progress of Stanford's cur
rent search is in keeping with the
timeline established in the 1991
search that ended with his appoint
ment to the presidency.
"If there is one thing I am certain
about." he said, "it is that Stanford
need not feel any particular time
pressure."

Possible candidates
In addition to spurring concern
about competition, Casper's an
nouncement has also led to much
speculation about possible candi
dates for his position.
Provost John Hennessy, largely
because of his position, appears to
be the first possibility to many.
Robert Rosenzweig. a former
head of the Association of Ameri
can Universities and a former vice
president of Stanford, noted in the
Chronicle that, "Stanford's pattern
has been to choose a provost or
strong academic scholar."
Kennedy, however, does not see
this as a deciding factor.
"The Provost obviously will re
ceive strong consideration." he
said, "but the committee will cast a
wide net. because it will be an ad
vantage to any selectee that the
search is seen as thorough. Call him
a Iront-runner it you wish, but

there is certainly no line of succes
sion.' "
Nannerl Keohane, the president
of Duke University, has also been
mentioned as a possible candidate.
Keohane was a Stanford faculty
member and chair of the Faculty
Senate before going to Wellesley as
president in 19K1 and then to Duke
in IW.
John F. Burness, senior vice
president of Duke, commented on
Keohane's possible candidacy.
"She and I discussed this very
issue at lunch a few weeks ago." he
said. "Apparently, a few days be
fore our lunch, an old friend in
North Carolina asked her whether
she was interested in being a candi
date at Stanford. She told that per
son that while she had great admi
ration for Stanford, she was very
happv at and committed to Duke
and was not interested in the Stan
lord presidency. She told me the

same thing."
Condoleezza Rice, a former
provost long-considered a possible
successor to Casper, is now serving
as an adviser to Presidential candi
date George W. Bush.
Rice has also made it clear that
she does not wish to he considered
for the position.
Former Business School Dean
Michael Spence and Richard
Shavelson, who is in his last year as
dean of t lie School of Education,
may also be possible candidates.
Still, most agree it is too early to
speculate on candidates for Stan
lord's presidency.
Hennessy said that though talk
of his candidacy was simultaneous
ly flattering and annoying, any
speculation at this point was idle.
"I find it best to ignore the spec
ulation and not to comment." he
said. "The provost's job is keeping
me plenty busy."
