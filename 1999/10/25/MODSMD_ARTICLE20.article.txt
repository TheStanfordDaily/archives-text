## Soccer beats out UCLA, USC Women sweep weekend to solidify conference lead 
### Lori Maund Contributing writer 
The response of head coach Steve
Swanson to his squad's crucial wins this
weekend reveals a lot about the attitude
of this year's Stanford women's soccer
team and its drive to the top of the Pacific
10 Conference.

WOMEN'S SOCCER
■ Saturday: No. 10 Stanford (13-3,b-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) 6, No. 14 UCLA
4-1-1)0
■ Yesterday: Stanford 3, No. 7 USC (12-4 v
1)2

When asked how it felt to beat the two
best teams in the Pac-1() — USC and
UCLA — Swanson responded, "They
were the two best teams. Not any more.
All the teams are good this year, and next
weekend we've got [California] at home."
Like its coach, this Cardinal team is
not satisfied with a few wins. The winning
this year is partly due to the depth of qual

ity players on the squad. Hut the winning
spirit is, more importantly, in the team's
fighting attitude.
And he's right. All the teams in the
Pac-10 are good this year. In fact, some
argue that this is the strongest the Pac-10
has ever been in the history of women's
soccer. While all of the teams might be
good, only one team, Swanson's team, is
undefeated.
After a scoreless half on Friday night,
the No. 10 Cardinal (13-3, 6-0 Pac-10)
came back to beat the No. 14 Bruins (12-
3-1,4-1-1) by a whopping score of 6-0.
On Sunday afternoon, Stanford fought
back from 1-0 and 2-1 deficits to beat the
No. 7 USC Trojans 3-2.
"It was phenomenal," said senior de
lender Natalie Kim. "It was just plain
phenomenal."
In front of a crowd of 1,23b, the Cardi
nal beat the only other undefeated team
in the Pac-10 to move into the No. 1 spot
in the conference by itself.
Despite giving up an early goal to the
Trojans, Stanford battled back to even
the score at 1-1.

"It didn't phase us," said senior co
captain Jennifer O'Sullivan. "We knew
that we wanted to win. We knew that we
needed to win. We had to fight back to
win."
Senior co-captain Shauna Itri respond
ed less than 10 minutes after the Trojan
goal with a goal of her own. As the ball
tumbled around outside the 18-yard line,
Itri struck it one-touch, settling it into the
back of the net.
The Cardinal fell behind again, this
time just 30 seconds into the second half.
The second goal for USC came on a ques
tionable call that awarded USC a penalty
kick. Other teams might let falling behind
this early in the second half on a ques
tionable call frustrate them and take them
out of their game.
Other teams, but not this team.
"I had complete confidence in our
team," said senior midfielder Ronnie
Fair. "1 had no question that we would
score again."
The Cardinal mounted a counterat-

tack, with the outside players re
peatedly pounding USC. O'Sulli
van, an outside defender, penetrat
ed the Trojan defense numerous
times with her dribbling skills. At
one point, she dribbled through
three defenders, but failed to hit
the back of the net.
"Our outside players — Ali
[MarquandJ, Jen [O'Sullivan],
Beckv [Myers], Kelsey [Carlson]
and [Erin| Maurer did a really
good job getting in their half,"
Swanson said. "They did a great
job of putting pressure on the other
team."
'I have never been more
proud of a team. We came
back from behind twice
today. Everyone worked so
hard — it was a total team
effort;
— Steve Swanson
The penetration of the outside
players combined with the hard
work of the center midlilders. Id i
and Fair.
"Ronnie and Shauna really
worked hard." Swanson said.
" They were our engines, working
hard and creating chances."
Fifteen minutes after the second
Trojan goal, the two of them would
combine for ;i goal to even the
score. Ilri was fouled just outside
the goal box. Fair stepped up to
take the kick. Her shot curved
around the wall, into the upper

right corner of the goal.
"The keeper was cheating to
ward the near post," Fair said. "1
could tell that she was leaning that
way, and as I hit it, she took a few
steps that way. The far post was
pretty much open and that's where
I hit it."
Fair has consistently hit free
kicks this season, often converting
them into goals. •
"I really believe that when a
player believes she is going to
make it, and the other players be
lieve in her too, then she's going to
do it." Swanson said. "Ronnie has
got her confidence and she's
putting them away."
The final goal for the Cardinal
came off the foot of freshman mid
fielder Becky Myers. Sophomore
Amy Sauer received the ball in the
Cardinal's half of the field and hit a
long ball to Myers, who collected it
under pressure just outside the
USC goal box. Beating one player,
she looked to score and hit it into
the side netting across from the
keeper.
"It was a nice touch," O'Sulli
van said. "Becky aimed not direct
ly at [the IJSC goalkeeper], but hit
it right in the open netting on the
side."
Although the Cardinal is al
ready looking to next weekend's
home game against Cal, the team
did take time to reflect on what it
accomplished over the weekend.
"I have never been more proud
of a team," Swanson said. "We
came back from behind twice
today.
"Everyone worked so hard — it
was a total team effort," he said.
I laving knocked off the top two
teams in the conference, the Cardi
nal will face the next-best team in
the Pac-10, the Cal Bears, at Stan
lord's New Maloney Field next
weekend.
