## Soccer beats out UCLA, USC Women sweep weekend to solidify conference lead 
### Lori Maund Contributing writer 
The response of head coach Steve
Swanson to his squad's crucial wins this
weekend reveals a lot about the attitude
of this year's Stanford women's soccer
team and its drive to the top of the Pacific
10 Conference.

WOMEN'S SOCCER
■ Saturday: No. 10 Stanford (13-3,b-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) 6, No. 14 UCLA
4-1-1)0
■ Yesterday: Stanford 3, No. 7 USC (12-4 v
1)2

When asked how it felt to beat the two
best teams in the Pac-1() — USC and
UCLA — Swanson responded, "They
were the two best teams. Not any more.
All the teams are good this year, and next
weekend we've got [California] at home."
Like its coach, this Cardinal team is
not satisfied with a few wins. The winning
this year is partly due to the depth of qual

ity players on the squad. Hut the winning
spirit is, more importantly, in the team's
fighting attitude.
And he's right. All the teams in the
Pac-10 are good this year. In fact, some
argue that this is the strongest the Pac-10
has ever been in the history of women's
soccer. While all of the teams might be
good, only one team, Swanson's team, is
undefeated.
After a scoreless half on Friday night,
the No. 10 Cardinal (13-3, 6-0 Pac-10)
came back to beat the No. 14 Bruins (12-
3-1,4-1-1) by a whopping score of 6-0.
On Sunday afternoon, Stanford fought
back from 1-0 and 2-1 deficits to beat the
No. 7 USC Trojans 3-2.
"It was phenomenal," said senior de
lender Natalie Kim. "It was just plain
phenomenal."
In front of a crowd of 1,23b, the Cardi
nal beat the only other undefeated team
in the Pac-10 to move into the No. 1 spot
in the conference by itself.
Despite giving up an early goal to the
Trojans, Stanford battled back to even
the score at 1-1.

"It didn't phase us," said senior co
captain Jennifer O'Sullivan. "We knew
that we wanted to win. We knew that we
needed to win. We had to fight back to
win."
Senior co-captain Shauna Itri respond
ed less than 10 minutes after the Trojan
goal with a goal of her own. As the ball
tumbled around outside the 18-yard line,
Itri struck it one-touch, settling it into the
back of the net.
The Cardinal fell behind again, this
time just 30 seconds into the second half.
The second goal for USC came on a ques
tionable call that awarded USC a penalty
kick. Other teams might let falling behind
this early in the second half on a ques
tionable call frustrate them and take them
out of their game.
Other teams, but not this team.
"I had complete confidence in our
team," said senior midfielder Ronnie
Fair. "1 had no question that we would
score again."
The Cardinal mounted a counterat-

In Sunday's game against No. 7 USC, senior Jennifer O'Sullivan was able to penetrate
deep into Trojan territory. The Cardinal prevailed 3-2 and preserved the team's unde
feated Pac-10 record.
