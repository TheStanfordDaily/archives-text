## Stanford 5-0 in conference for first time since 1970 Rose Bowl year 
### Tim Kane Contributing writer 
Another week, another victory
sealed by an interception with sec
onds left. Some might say it's get
ting to be routine.
In front of a hostile, screaming
crowd of 57,294 at the Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum, the Stanford
football team managed to pull out
an anything-but-routine 35-31 vic-

Tory over USC. Senior Tim Smith
sealed the victory by intercepting a
Mike Van Raaphorst pass with five
seconds left as the Trojans were
threatening to score and win the
game.
The Cardinal (5-2.5-0 Pacific 10
Conference) erased a 21-point
deficit that I JSC (3-4.1 -3) had built
in the first quarter and used a com
bination of timely sacks, intercep
tions and big plays at opportune

times to send the Trojans down to
defeat. The win was the first time
Stanford had won in the Coliseum
since 1991.

Stanford now has a 5-0 record in
the Pac-10. and the team can actu

next Saturday if Arizona State
loses.
"At the moment [the victory
over USC] is awful big." head
coach Tyrone Willingham said.
"This is a great victory — I mean a
lot of old-time Stanford people can
tell you there's a lot of disappoint
ment and heartbreak. This is
huge."
USC got its final chance to score
when Willingham decided to go for
a first down on fourth and inches at
the Cardinal 45-yard line and se
nior quarterback Todd llusak's
sneak failed. Stanford's defense,
which struggled in the first quarter
but played well afterward, man
aged to hold off the Trojans long
enough to bring up a crucial
fourth-down play, which ended
with Smith's interception.
"I am so proud of this football
team for hanging in there," said
Kent Baer, Stanford defensive co
ordinator. "To be down 21-0 at the
Coliseum and to come back and
beat a football team that is awfully
talented is a real credit to our
kids."
The first quarter brought back
unpleasant memories of the Texas
game from earlier this year, when
the Cardinal fell behind big early
on. Saturday, Stanford gave up
touchdowns on three successive
drives by the Trojans to go down
21-0 while gaining a measly 52
yards on offense for the entire
quarter.
