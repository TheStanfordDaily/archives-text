MEN'S SWIMMING
â–  Saturday: No. I Stanford took
third place at the University of the
Pacific Invitational

Along with the collegiate swim
mers competing in the meet were
also a number of graduated competi
tors from other schools.
Physically worn out and broken
down from a rigorous week of in
and out-of-pool training, four Stan
ford swimmers still managed to win
five events on Saturday.
Junior Adam Messner recorded
two of the five wins himself, finishing
first among the collegiate competi
tors in both the 100-meter fly and the
200 freestyle. Juniors Rob Canales
and Steven Brown also performed
well, winning the 200 backstroke and
the 200 fly. respectively. Freshman
Randall Hal made a strong impres
sion in his first collegiate meet, div
ing straight into a first-place finish in
the 1(K) backstroke.
The Cardinal clearly had inten
tions other than simply winning this
meet.
After a grueling week of work
outs. including stadium runs, weight
lifting and many repetitions in the
pool, the team wanted to see how it
would hold up with tired bodies. The
philosophy was that if the team could
perform decently in such a fatigued
state, just imagine what it could do
when well-rested.
"The team did pretty well."

Canalcs, a co-captain, said. "But we
weren't going to this meet to win it."
"The whole idea was to see how
we could do when we were com
pletely broken down," Bal added.
"We weren't well rested at all. but we
all have great attitudes and are ready
to keep working hard to win the
NC'AAs at the end of the season.
That's our goal."
The type of training that preced
ed this meet is not typical prepara
tion for the rest of the meets.
" This probably won't happen for
the rest of the year." Bal said. "We'll
probably be getting a little more rest
than that before meets."
Messner emphasized that this
meet should not indicate what the
rest of the season will hold, as far as
point totals and individual perfor
mances go.
" The [workouts] made it tough to
do as well as we wanted." he said.
"The only thing that was really indi
cated to ns was that we were very
beat up from an extremely hard pre
meet workout."
I lead coach Skip kenne\ w as out
of town on recruiting business for
next year's team and unable to be at
the meet, leaving the coaching and
evaluating duties to assistant coach
Ted Knapp. Knapp also realized that
Saturday's meet was not a reflection
of the Cardinal's capabilities, but
rather a reflection of how hard the
team has been working to improve
itself.
"Knapp wasn't happy with our
times, but he was very happy with
our hard work." Messner said.
"Even though our times weren't the
best, they showed him that we've
been putting 100 percent into our
workouts in and out of the water."
The Cardinal will have another
chance to gauge itself as it travels to
Vancouver this weekend to compete
in the College Cup on Friday and
Saturday.
