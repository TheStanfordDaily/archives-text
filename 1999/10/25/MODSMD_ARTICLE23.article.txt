# Field hockey falls to Bears again
## Card drops another to Cal, must wait for NorPac tournament 
### Ashley Rich Contributing writer 
Amid songs from a spirited band and
shouts from enthusiastic California fans,
Stanford's field hockey team (7-8, 4-1
Northern Pacific Conference) faced its
biggest rival for the second time this sea
son. This time the game was played on
Cal's turf, but the result was the same:
close competition, but the Bears came out
on top.
Cal (10-4, 5-0), ranked Ifrth in the na
tion, snuck in two breakaway goals on
Sunday — one in each half of the game —
to become the sole leader of the NorPac.
The Bears opened up the match with

aggressive determination. Within the first
three minutes of the game, a breakaway
pass was deflected into the top corner of
the cage for a goal.

"It took us a while to rev up to the
game," senior Julie Gwozdz said. "After
that goal, we woke up and I thought il was
only a matter of time before we would
score to even up the game."
After that scare, Stanford picked up
the pace and the battle between the two

teams intensified.
"That first part of the game w as played
mostly between our 25-yard line and
theirs." senior captain Mallory Chambers
said.
Control changed sides frequently as
possession became a matter of stepping
up to the ball. The Cardinal stayed poised
and was able to win several free hits on
Cal pushing fouls.
But things never really seemed to click
for the Cardinal in the shooting circle. Im
pressive and accurate passing between
forwards and midfielders got the ball
down the field, but many plays ended past
