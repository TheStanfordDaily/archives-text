# Field hockey falls to Bears again
## Card drops another to Cal, must wait for NorPac tournament 
### Ashley Rich Contributing writer 
Amid songs from a spirited band and
shouts from enthusiastic California fans,
Stanford's field hockey team (7-8, 4-1
Northern Pacific Conference) faced its
biggest rival for the second time this sea
son. This time the game was played on
Cal's turf, but the result was the same:
close competition, but the Bears came out
on top.
Cal (10-4, 5-0), ranked Ifrth in the na
tion, snuck in two breakaway goals on
Sunday — one in each half of the game —
to become the sole leader of the NorPac.
The Bears opened up the match with

aggressive determination. Within the first
three minutes of the game, a breakaway
pass was deflected into the top corner of
the cage for a goal.

"It took us a while to rev up to the
game," senior Julie Gwozdz said. "After
that goal, we woke up and I thought il was
only a matter of time before we would
score to even up the game."
After that scare, Stanford picked up
the pace and the battle between the two

teams intensified.
"That first part of the game w as played
mostly between our 25-yard line and
theirs." senior captain Mallory Chambers
said.
Control changed sides frequently as
possession became a matter of stepping
up to the ball. The Cardinal stayed poised
and was able to win several free hits on
Cal pushing fouls.
But things never really seemed to click
for the Cardinal in the shooting circle. Im
pressive and accurate passing between
forwards and midfielders got the ball
down the field, but many plays ended past

the endline and out of bounds.
Missed opportunities seemed
to prevail in Stanford's last two
games.
Against Columbia and Cal, the
Cardinal managed to keep the ball
in the offensive end of the field for
the majority of the game, but a
couple of shots by the opponent
have turned the tide of the game
against Stanford.
Chalk it up to inexperience,
perhaps. This year's lineup is full
of new starters, and although great
team chemistry has been apparent
in several games, often the chal
lenge of exhausting matches can
provoke even the smallest mis
communications that can be dan
gerous.
With 12 minutes left in the
game, another Cal breakaway
passed through several defenders
and ended up in Stanford's goal to
put the Bears up by two.
"That one was deflating,"
CJwozdz said.
The disappointment was al
most visible on the field.
Not being able to come back
from those two goals was a painful
reality check for the Cardinal after
the team came from a successful 3-
1 road trip last week.
"It was frustrating to lose, espe
cially after being ready for this
game for so long." senior Lindsey
Dunagan said.
But some consolation comes in
knowing that in only two weeks,
all teams in the NorPac will com
pete for the conference title. As
the top-seeded teams, Stanford
and Cal will most likely meet yet
again in the championship game.
The tournament will be held on
