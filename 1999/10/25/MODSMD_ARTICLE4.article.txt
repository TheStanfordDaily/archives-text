Hundreds of people celebrated the new $120-million Science and Engineering Quad Thursday in Stone
Pine Plaza, listening to speakers, dancing to live jazz music and eating catered food.
and revamped plans for the area
many times.
Thursday's event celebrated the
SEQ, considered the capstone of
the Near West Campus.
In 192K Stanford had the south
sideofSerra Mall mapped out for a
science quad. Casper said, howev
er. that the real inspiration for the
SEQ stemmed from the spring
1980 dedication of Cecil H. Green
Library.
He said he was sitting next to
David Packard (Class of '34). a
founder of Hewlett-Packard and
donor to the University, looking at
the "uninspired setting" that
"cried out for renewal."
Subsequently, Casper and
Packard agreed that the dismal
buildings were not lit for the 21st
century. Packard donated $75 mil
lion toward the renewal and of
fered more in hopes that the pro
ject would be finished during his

lifetime.
I lowever. Packard passed away
in March 1996 and was unable to
see the finished project.
Casper said he is proud of the
SEQ and that he counts it as one of
his greatest satisfactions.
Casper played a large role in the
construction of the quad and
helped launch the competition to
find the architect for the whole
project.
James Ingo Freed was chosen as
the primary architect and was in
charge of the overall construction.
Boyd, who joked about his role
as half of the EE Building Commit
tee, explained the ideals of the new
building during the celebration.
"Fundamentally, science and engi
neering are social sciences."
1 le said that the inner quad area
is crucial for the development of
new ideas since "bumping into
each other and exchanging ideas is
critical."
The grassy lawn and new cafe
create areas for interaction and
uive graduate students and re

searchers chances to meet their
neighbors.
Guests at the reception had
mixed feelings on the courtyard's
atmosphere.
"Truthfully, I think it's very
uninspiring, and I'm scared that it
may look dated in 20 years," said
I luck Dorn. a mechanical engi
neering master's student.
However, I raccy Harris, the
event coordinator for the Engi
neering Department. s;tid she has
received positive responses about
the SEQ and is enthusiastic about
the new addition to the Stanford
campus.
The four areas that make up the
Near West campus â€” the new Sta
tistics building, the Teaching Cen
ter. the Packard Electrical Engi
neering Building and the McCul
lough Annex are all equipped
with the latest tools of technology.
The auditoriums have larger ca
pacities than previously, and the
Stanford Instructional Television
Network has been installed in each
classroom.
