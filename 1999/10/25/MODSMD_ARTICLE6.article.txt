As part of the African and
African-American Studies Program
fall lecture series. University of
( hicago English Prof. Kenneth War
ren spoke last Friday.
Warren, author of several works,
presented a speech open to all stu
dents entitled, "African Diaspora
and the Decline and Fall of I listorv."
Diaspora, a term for the breaking
up and scattering of a people, as War
ren told several dozen students and
faculty, represents "a mode of con
ceptualizing identity."
Instead of focusing on traditional
archival-based history. Warren dis
cussed how the history of the African
Diaspora acts as a "challenge to his
torical method itself."
By allowing for the diasporic story
to be told from the standpoint of
Africans and African Americans.

Warren argued that a new type of his
torian. one who has "an intimate re
lation with the subject," emerges. In
essence, he said, "truth demands be
lief* on the part of the historian.
Speaking specifically from a his
toric standpoint. Warren talked
about how diasporic fiction can
sometimes offer more insights into
histofV than traditional archival re
search. Ile said this was especially
true in situations where many facts
are missing, such as the African-
A me rica n expe rie nee.
One example Warren cited was
the ongoing debate as to whether the
idea of slaves choosing death over
bondage truly goes against historical
evidence.
On another level. Warren also
talked about how current historical
ideas of "place and time are put into
question with diasporic analysis."
I le said that the language need
ed to describe such historical experi
ences can often be poetic or non-lin
ear in nature.
Warren also offered challenging
questions about popular ideas of
community, culture and sacrifice.
I lis speech was followed by a
question-and-answer period, dur
ing which the points made in the
speech were further elaborated
upon by questions.
Shirley Delaleu, a sophomore,
said that she thoroughly enjoyed the
guest speaker's presentation, which
was "open to everybody."
She added that Warren dealt
with ideas that she "never really
went into before in my classes."
Warren's works include "Black
and White Strangers: Race and
American Literary Realism." He is
currently working on a book enti
tled "Where Are We Free?"
