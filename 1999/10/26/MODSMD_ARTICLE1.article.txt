# Journalist decribes terror in Timor
## 
### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
Only one foreign journalist re
mained in East Timor when the In
donesian military cracked down
after the historic Aug. 30 East Tim
orese vote for independence from
Indonesia.
Allan Nairn, investigative re
porter and founder of "Multina
tional Monitor" magazine, ad
dressed an audience of over 200 at
the Little Theater in Old Union
yesterday on his experiences as a
foreign journalist amid the carnage
and destruction that followed the
vote for independence.
Nairn, who has written for The
Nation, The Washington Post and
The New Yorker, was not new to
Indonesia.
He survived the 1991 Dili Mas
sacre, in which at least 271 East
Timorese were killed.
Although his skull was cracked
by an M-16 rifle, paid for by the
United States for the Indonesian
military, Nairn said he received
"privileged treatment."
"The East Timorese were being
shot." he said. "They live at the
other end of the M-16."
"It is difficult to convey what it
is like [in places such as Guatemala
and East Timor]. It is not really
possible," Nairn said.
Life is life — most people in
most places have to make similar
choices, although the terms of their
choices are different."
In the United States, the choice
is whether or not to take a few
hours a week to write letters, speak
to people, inspire the apathetic or
attend "boring meetings," Nairn

said.
In East Timor, the choice is to
risk one's life to defend one's fami
ly-
Nairn said he was first exposed
to the brutalities faced by citizens
under military regimes when he
was on assignment in Guatemala.
While there, he saw a man
bleeding to death on a sidewalk of
the main banking street right in
front of a row of stoic soldiers.
Nairn said he later found out
that the man had worked at the
post office and had been shot for
trying to organize a union.
Adding to violence directly in
stigated by the military in both
Guatemala and East Timor is the
violence perpetrated by local mili
tias. Nairn said.
Militia members are "plucked"
by the military from soccer fields,
movie theaters and the streets and
trained to kill, he said.
As a rite of passage, young re
cruits are forced to commit atroci
ties such as rape, murder and ab
duction.
Nairn said civilians have to deal
with the disappearance of their
family members, which spreads a
pall of uncertainty over the rest of
their days. They are gone, but their
bodies are missing.
"Imagine a whole country like
this — occupied East Timor.
Guatemala, El Salvador, the north
ern part of Nicaragua, parts of
I londuras," Nairn said.
According to Nairn, one espe
cially relevant fact is that the forces
creating this uncertainty are
armed, trained and financed by the
