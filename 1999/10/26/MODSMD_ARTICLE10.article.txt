Cross-cultural
residences should
accomodate all

The existence- of "cross-cultural
theme houses" at Stanford Univer
sity has long been a source of con
troversy antl dispute. Opponents of the
ethnically based houses argue that these
residences are bastions of segregation, fos
tering an environment contrary to the
principles of this school and current-day
standards of race relations.
Supporters of the houses contend, how
ever. that they serve as a gathering point
and an environment of support and famil
iarity for the various minority communi
ties. According to Residential Education,
part of the mission of these houses is to
"provide an informal opportunity for stu
dents of different backgrounds to learn
from and about each other."
Though these residences do not always
seem to fit this mission and certainly have
their drawbacks, their benefit to the Uni
versity as a whole is tremendous. The
administration must work to maintain and
strengthen them.
At the very least, ethnic houses (apart
from the community centers) serve as the
only center of education about the culture
of a particular ethnic group. I heir impor
tance is heightened by the absence of any
deep-seated ethnic studies program at this
I Inivcrsity.
In this regard, ethnic houses can give
the entire Stanford community an insight
into the culture of a particular group. The
residence environment is especially cru
cial for non-ethnic students in creating an
open sense of community that can't be
found through the ethnic centers.
Additionally, because of the familiar
atmosphere that they offer, ethnic resi
dences can make the sometimes-difficult
process of adjustment to college life easier
for minority students.
l urthermore, as places where race and
ethnicity are more visible at the surface
(especially in the dorm events), cross-cul
tural theme houses explore issues such as
race, ethnicity, identity and multicultural
ism with a level of frankness that would

not necessarily he discussed elsewhere on
this campus.
Whether we like to admit it or not, the
values reflected in this University are
those of the dominant Anglo-American
culture, and this is evidenced in many of
the residences and organizations else
where on campus. Hthnically-based resi
dence for minority communities affirm the
values of that group and provide an inter
esting counter-balance to the bias.
This is not to say that these residences
are without their problems, however.
I'hey can certainly make the adjustment
process to college life more difficult for
freshmen who are not of a particular eth
nicity.
The solution, however, is not to do
away with the idea of cross-cultural educa
tion altogether. Housing Assignment Ser
vices should look into the preferences of
students when making housing assign
ments. If. after being fully educated about
the different options, incoming students
make an explicit request not to be
assigned to an ethnic theme house, HAS
should be open to idea of accomodating
that request.
This is not a matter of racism; substan
tially different experiences can be had in
cross-cultural theme houses versus else
where, and the student should have more
control over that. Staff in the ethnic theme
dorms should also go out of their way to
make non-ethnic freshmen feel more com
fortable and include them in community
events.
Organizers of events at ethnic houses
should also be careful to actively bridge
the cultural gap by advertising and orga
nizing events with a broad audience in
mind. These theme events should not
simply be targeted for a particular com
munity but the University at large; that is
their purpose. Doing this will not neces
sarily translate into a loss of "cultural fla
vor," it simply requires extra effort and
attention on the part of the event orga
nizers.
With some effort and open-mindedness
on the part of students, residential staff
and the University, the mission of Stan
ford's ethnic theme houses can be sup
ported and strengthened, and the benefits
can be observed bv all.
