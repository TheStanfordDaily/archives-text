## Hey baby, what's your major? 
### 
Mike Rosenbluth

Friction is to abrasion
as ... being a senior
who is probably
going to stick around
another year to coterm. I
get to take the Graduate
Record Exam in about a
month. Instead of taking a

Ci RE: course for the very low price of $ 1 .(KM).
I decided to buy a book, and this was the first
analogy to come up.
Remembering my snappy skills from
SAT prep. I created a relationship with the
words. Friction causes an abrasion. Good
enough. Now to the answers: Sterility causes
cleanliness? Nope. A dam causes a flood?
Maybe in China. A laceration causes a
wound? Sure. 1 leat causes evaporation?
Well, based on the many, many heat transfer
classes I have to take, this is not true in most
cases. Literacy causes ignorance? So Jesse
I ielms would like us to believe. So choice I)
it is. As I turn the page, I am ready for the
book to congratulate me on my good think
ing.
It apparently didn't agree with me. It
chose heat:evaporation. And the book's
explanation was simply lame. I went on a
mission to my friends to see what they would
answer. I figured that because most of us
found a way to scam through the SAT sur
prisingly well in high school, if my friends
answered the same as 1 did, I would feel
appeased that we were right and the book
was wrong.
My Mechanical Engineering study group
was right there next to me working on a lab

write-up, so I started with them. They all
agreed with me. Good. But just to check up.
I asked whoever entered my room in the
next hour. My roommate and a'couple of my
draw mates answered correctly, and a pair of
sophomores and another draw mate (a ver
bal SAT tutor) answered sterility:cleanliness.
My ME buddies and I were perplexed:
how could no one else give the answer that
was so obviously correct? Judging by the fact
that all of us got at least a 7(X) on our SAT
verbal, this range of answers could only
mean a few things: No. 1: The GRE sucks
(probable). No. 2: This book purposely put a
hard ambiguous question first to get every
one to buy it (also probable). No. 3: Perhaps
our majors and our concentration of classes
have influenced the way we think. For argu
ment's sake, and to make a mildly thoughtful
column, let's look at choice No. 3.
This idea has actually come up a few too
many times this week, first in a letter sent to
me about my last column and second from
one of my professors.
Initially, I am very resistant to the idea
that my thought patterns are that of a
mechanical engineer. Though I did choose it
as a major and am interested in the subject, I
do not want to label myself in or define
myself by a class of people simply by what I
take my classes in. But we do it all the time
when talking about other people.
I low many times have you asked some
one the "What's your major?" question?
And the answer invariably brings up certain
stereotypes of what kind of personality type
this person is: Biology brings up the "over

competitive pre-med" stereotype. Eco
nomics brings up the "I'm going to he an
investment hanker" stereotype, and Chemi
cal Engineering just brings up the question,
"Why?"
These personality stereotypes come up in
other areas as well. When I tell people I
come from Orange County, people immedi
ately think that 1 am politically conservative.
And when someone tells you they are from
New York, you think that they're insane.
The main crux of one's intellectual stimu
lation during college is one's major. I, like
most other MEs, look at a toy and wonder
how it was injection molded — something
which I guarantee most other majors would
not do. If I concede the fact that one's major
influences what one often thinks about, it
does not influence how one thinks.
When I work on problem sets with my
classmates, we often find the solution in com
pletely different methods. And when we
look at our interests in non-ME stuff, they
are most of the time completely different.
While one of my friends sews big pants in his
free time; another one goes swing dancing. 1
see a knowledge base as a toolbox: though
many people have many of the same tools at
hand, they use different tools in different
ways to find a solution.
