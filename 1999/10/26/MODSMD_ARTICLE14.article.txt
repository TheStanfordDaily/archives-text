High school students are
ranked
(iovind Dandekar decries the U.S. News
and World Report ranking of colleges and
argues (hat "no sane individual, including
any editor ol I I.S. News, would suggest that
there should be some national ranking of all
college-bound high school seniors available
for public perusal."
Well, it may not be available for public
perusal, but isn't it interesting that there is an
organization that does rank all college
bound students and offers that list to col
leges'.' Isn't it even more interesting that col
leges require applicants to PAY to make
sure they are on this ranking?
Ihe organization I am referring to is
fiducational Testing Service (ETS), which
ranks all college bound students by a
method commonly referred to as the SAT.
While I'm sure the U.S. News method of
ranking colleges is ;i bit arbitrary. I find it
hard to believe it is significantly more arbi
trary then the SAT.
When I taught SA I prep, I saw students
improve their scores as much as 250 points. I
do not believe that these students suddenly
got smarter, anymore then Columbia sud
denly became a worse schix>l when its rank
ing fell from ninth to 15th.
As long as college admissions offices use
the SAT ranking as one factor out of many

for choosing which students to admit, it is
reasonable for students likewise to use col
lege rankings, as one factor out of many, as
they decide where to apply and attend.
After all. hopefully Stanford is able to rec
ognize while that a 1600 is different from a
12(H). a 1550 might not be so different from
a 1490.
Can't we then expect that students who
will one day attend Stanford are capable or
recognizing that while a first-place ranking is
different from a 50th-place ranking, a fifth
place ranking and a ninth-place ranking
might not be all that different?

We're here to advise you
ITiank you for your editorial encouraging
faculty to participate as advisers to freshmen.
Ihe Undergraduate Advising Center wel
comes all faculty as well as staff and graduate
students who are committed to helping first
year students identify and pursue their aca
demic interests and goals to apply to be
Freshman Advisers.
To ensure that no freshman adviser has
more than eight advisees, in addition to fac
ulty. Stanford has a tradition of inviting other
members of Stanford's educational commu
nity — graduate students and staff members

like the Dean of Admission, the Director of
the Career Development Center, the Associ
ate Vice Provost for Undergraduate educa
tion and others — to serve as Freshman advi
sors.
Please note that because we now offer 240
small-group courses for freshmen and sopho
more students through the Stanford Intro
ductory Studies program, there are many,
many faculty who serve as intellectual men
tors to first- and second-year students. Some
choose to do so by serving as Freshman
Advisers, others as professors in the Stanford
Introductory Studies program.
I encourage all freshman students who
want to develop an intellectual mentoring
relationship with a faculty member to take at
least one Freshman Seminar this year.
Additionally, your editorial was absolute
ly right that the relationship between an
adviser and advisee should be mor than
meeting once a quarter for an approval
code. I challenge all students to take the
time to talk with their adviser about their
academic and intellectual interests and to
take the initiative to get together with their
adviser more frequently than just around
approval code time. Our 1999 adviser evalu
ation survey completed by students last
Winter Quarter indicated that the majority
of freshmen students seldom contacted their
adviser but waited for their adviser to con
tact them.

In addition to the intellectual mentorship
that a faculty adviser can provide, you may
find that because your graduate student
adviser is involved in developing an indepen
dent research project, he or she can help you
figure how to get started exploring your own
research interests, or that your staff adviser
has a Ph.D. in a field that you are considering
for graduate study.
Also, please feci free to stop by the
Undergraduate Advising Center for addi
tional advising assistance or to let us know
what wc can do to improve your advising
experience.

2) Since when docs teaching thievery to
