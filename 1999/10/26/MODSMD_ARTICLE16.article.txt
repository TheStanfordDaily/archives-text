# Band goes 'Live' with Regis
## 
### Daily staff report 
Thursday morning's episode of
"Live with Regis and Kathie Lee"
will feature Danny Glover, Carrot
Top ... and the Stanford Band.
About 60 band members trav
eled to the San Francisco water
front Monday to play at the
episode's taping.
This was a large turnout consid
ering that the Band just got back
Sunday from the lISC football
game, according to drum major
Elizabeth Beaux.
"Playing on 'Regis and Kathie

Lee' is a once-in-a-lifetime oppor
tunity," Beaux said.
The show taped four episodes in
San Francisco on Sunday and Mon
day, all of which are scheduled to
air this week.
"They called and said, 'Hey,
would you like to come be on our
show?"" Beaux said.
Other hand members were sur
prised at the invitation, noting that
host Regis Philbin is a devout
Notre Dame fan and might remem
ber the Band's lampooning of the
Fighting Irish in 1997.
The show's other guests enjoyed

the colorful musicians.
"They're great, man," said
Glover, co-star of the four "Lethal
Weapon" films and a voice in the
recent animated feature "Antz."
"They're unconventional, no
doubt about that."
Delia Reese, star of the televi
sion series "Touched by an Angel,"
agreed.
"I want to be in the Band," she
said. "I want to dress up and play."
The episode with the Band will
air Thursday at 9 a.m. on KGO,
channel 7, or channel 27 on Stan
ford Television.
