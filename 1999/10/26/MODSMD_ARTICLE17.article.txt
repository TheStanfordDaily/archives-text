# Alleged scam targets Wilbur
## Woman walks through Junipero, seeks credit card into 
### Greg Page 
Around 3:30 p.m. on Friday, an unidentified woman,
claiming to represent a women's organization, walked
through Junipero in Wilbur Hall asking for student
credit card numbers.
According to Junipero Resident Assistant Jennifer
Chou. the woman approached residents in their dorm
rooms, and after delivering a short speech about a sin
gle mothers' group, she asked for their credit card in
formation.
The woman is described as I lispanic and aged IK-25.
According to residents, she wore overalls, a t-shirt and
had brown hair with red and blonde streaks. She left
after a Junipero RA informed her that the house did not
permit solicitations.
Later that afternoon, Chou reported this suspicious
behavior to Wilbur Residence Dean Andy 1 lernandez.
Hernandez feels confident that the woman was a con
artist.
"Basically, anyone asking lor a credit card number

from a 'charity organization' is suspicious," said Her
nandez. "Most charity organizations wouldn't have
someone walking through a dorm, into rooms. To me,
that sounds like strange behavior."
Court Chillingworth, another RAin Junipero, said
that he knew "of at least two rooms in which she en
tered. Fortunately, to my knowledge, no residents gave
her their numbers."
Some students said that the woman's solicitations
probably would not have been successful.
"Who would just give away their number to anyone?
You'd have to be an idiot to fall for that," said junior
James Sung. "I would wonder how anyone who fell for
that got in here in the first place."
Other students shared Sung's opinion about the na
ture of the scam.
"I'd feel uncomfortable giving my credit card num
ber to some random person." said sophomore Matt
Garr.
I'he Stanford Police Department received no report
of the incident.
