deans told the approximately 70
pre-law students that attended last
night's "Meet the Deans" event at

more.

Center and promoted by the Stan
ford Pre-Law Society, featured ad
missions representatives from the

Deans from the law schools of NYU, Yale, Harvard and Cornell advised pre-law students last night at the
Law School,
"Hopefully, pre-law students
who are juniors and seniors [gained]
a greater understanding of the ad
missions process for law school and
in the process learned about [lour]
great law schools." he said.
"freshmen and sophomores who
|chose] to attend probably learned
quite a bit about law school in gener
al and furthered their understanding
of the law 'life-track,' " he added.
One of the most important ideas
when considering law school is
whether or not it is the best option
lor the individual student, said Jean
Webb of Yale 1 aw School.

"The first question should be.
Do you really want to go to law
school?.' " she said. "For some peo
ple, law school is a default option,
but that's a very expensive default
option. You need to do a self-assess
ment and determine if law school is
really right for you.
"You need to start doing some
research."
Most of the deans' discussion
centered around positive and nega
tive things to do while applying to
law school.
"Some of the big questions we get
concern the undergraduate CiPA,"
said Kick Geiger, associate dean of
admissions at Cornell Law School.
"Hut not all 3.5s are created
equal," he said. "One thing you need

to know about the 3.5 is what under
graduate school did it come from? In
determining this we don't use U.S.
News and World Report."
Concerning the range of ex
tracurricular activities and outside
involvement students should display
on an application, Kenneth Kline
rock of NYIJ Law School stressed
that depth, not breadth, was most
important.
"What we are asking you to do is
give us information about you," he
said. "We'd rather see you do some
thing extremely well than partici
pate in 12 one-hour-a-week activi
ties."
Additionally, each law school
representative described the loca
tion, academics and surrounding at

mosphere of their respective cam
puses.
"It's really important that you
visit schools you might have some in
terest in," said Joyce C'urll of Har
vard Law School.
Following the representatives'
speeches was a question-and-answer
period, providing a chance for stu
dents to discuss their concerns
the goal of the event, according to
Larson.
"Since there is no pre-law track'
of classes," he said, "this [was]
mainly a great opportunity to get
together, in a forum of sorts, with
other pre law students on campus
and discuss similar ideas and inter
ests, exactly what the SPLS pro
motes."
