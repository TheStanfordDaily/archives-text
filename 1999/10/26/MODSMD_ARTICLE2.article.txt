# Council requests major changes
## P.A. to critique Stanford's plan 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
The Palo Alto City Council voted
last night to issue a set of recommen
dations to the Santa Clara County
Planning Commission, critiquing
Stanford's draft community plan.
The council's recommendations
requested several major changes to
the draft plan in the areas of open
space, housing, schools, parking and
circulation, land use and long-term
vision.
These recommendations are the
result of several weeks of public
input and fact-finding by the council
members.
Included in the set of recommen
dations is a new provision increasing
the preservation of open space areas
from the 10 years stated in the cur
rent draft plan to 25 years.
"Palo Alto has dedicated over
4.0(H) acres of open space," said Palo
Alto Mayor Gary Fazzino. "Stanford
has not dedicated one."
Fazzino called the 25-year open
space commitment a "very reason
able compromise."
Stanford's Director of Govern
ment and Community Relations,
Larry Horton, said that while Stan
ford would consider the council's
recommendations in drafting the
final plan, "planning goes in a 10-
year cycle."
The council also requested that
plans for a middle school be included

in the final draft of the plan. The rec
ommendations identified the ideal
location as west of Alma Street and
El Camino Real.
Currently, four schools in the Palo
Alto Unified School District and one
in Menlo Park exist on Stanford land.
The draft plan states that Stanford
will make every effort to work with
the school district to find a solution to
overcrowding.
"[Stanford) and the school dis
tricts are engaged in an ongoing dis
cussion," said Horton. He stated that
the final version of the community
plan will address the school issue.
The recommendations in the area
of parking and circulation were led
by the goal of "no new net commute
trips," originally a part of the 1989
General Use Permit.
Fazzino stated that Stanford "has
done more with respect to trans
portation management disincentives
than has the city of Palo Alto."
However, according to Ed Gawf,
the Palo Alto planning director, "this
standard [of no new net trips] is very
tough." The council members also
emphasized the difficulties associat
ed in measuring the number of com
mute trips generated by the Univer
sity.
The council supported the draft
plan's emphasis on creating addition
al campus housing, but suggested
that the unit types and development
standards for the proposed housing
were too general. The council also
recommended that the affordability
of the proposed housing be consid
ered.
Palo Alto resident Mary Davey
spoke of the need to incorporate low
and moderate-income housing on
campus, for both students and sup
port stall, mirroring the concerns of
the council.
C ouncil members emphasized

that the community plan should in
clude a long-term vision, beyond the
10-year scope of the plan. "We ought
to encourage Stanford to include ...
that vision in their community plan."
said Vice Mayor Lanic Wheeler.
I'he next step toward Stanford's
General Use Permit is the final com
munity plan, to be issued on Nov. 15.
In the meantime, the Santa Clara
County Planning Commission will
look at the draft plan and the Palo
Altocity council's recommendations.
"We look forward to what the
county comes up with," said council
member Joseph Huber.
