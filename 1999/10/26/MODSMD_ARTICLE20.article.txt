## Volleyball comes away with key wins over Cal, Hawaii Card downs mighty Wahine 
### Ellie Ritch Contributing writer 
The No. 7 Stanford women's
volleyball team traveled to Hawaii
Sunday night, and left the previ
ously unbeaten Wahine with their
first loss as a parting gift.
Stanford (17-2, 9-1 Pacific 10
Conference) dominated No. 2
Hawaii (17-1 )in straight games, 15-
9, 15-12, 15-10, in front of a packed

crowd of 10,252 at the Stan Sheriff
Center.
The Cardinal terminated both
of Hawaii's winning streaks over
the weekend, cutting off the
Wahine's consecutive win and
home-win streaks at 17 and 32, re
spectively. Stanford has won 16 of
its last 17 matchups.
The Stanford squad may be
ranked No. 7 for now, but the up
dated USA Today / AVCA poll is

sure to tell another story: The Car
dinal has beaten two of the nation's
top three teams in the last seven
days.
The Cardinal defeated No. 3 Pa
cific last Tuesday night at home in a
five-game fist-clencher. Stanford is
locking in on the top spots in the
national polls, and must continue
working hard to claim a Final Four
birth and a postseason return trip
to the Stan Sheriff Center.

never a cakewalk. The fans are bel

wave green leaves for good luck.

floor to cover their favorite home
team players in leis and other exot

crowd-inflated momentum going,
it is often near impossible to stop.
The Stanford women's volleyball
team showed that it had the power.

straight points for the Wahine, but
the Cardinal was able to maintain
its cool and battle back despite all
the commotion created by the
Hawaii fans.
Stanford steadied to score nine
of the next 11 points, taking the
lead for the first time. The women's
squad allowed Hawaii to catch up
at 9-9. but then stepped into high
gear and pulled off the first game

The Cardinal controlled game
two from its start, aside from a mo
mentary lapse at 7-7. Stanford
dominated the remainder of games
two and three.
According to many team mem
bers, Stanford has been struggling
to avoid having temporary "let
downs" during its competitions this
season. But this weekend, the Car
dinal stopped this trend by playing
with consistency.
