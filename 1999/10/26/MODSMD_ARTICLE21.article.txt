minutes to defeat the Trojans 5-3,
snapping I S( s nine-game winning
streak and limiting the nation's top
scoring team to just three goals.
In the week leading up to the
game, Stanford focused on defense.
After losing its last game to l)S("on
a two-point goal by Allen Basso, the
Stanford squad "decided we
wouldn't let two-point goals beat us
an\more," I)cttamanti said.
To minimi/e Trojan outside

plemented a press defense. Ideally,
the press would give ('ardinal goalie
Nick Tll is a better idea of when
shots were coming. At the same
time, the strategy aimed to throw off
the heavih European Trojan squad
that was used to the /one defense
predominant in international play.
The plan worked to perfection.
Stanford opened the scoring in
the In st quarter off a backhand shot
by senior holeman Mike I ipinski.
Just seconds later, the Trojans
evened the score oil a shot by Adam
(iuerrero which drifted back into
the goal after a block by l\llis. The
score was 2-1 in favor of I JSC' at the

The Cardinal offense erupted in
the third quarter, netting three goals
while team defense held the Trojans
scoreless. The first goal came on a
shot by senior Andy Walburger
from the hole as he exploited the
weak defense of Csaszar.
Moments later sophomore ()nno
Koelman scored the next goal off a
pass from double-teamed senior
Brian I Icifleron. Kedshirt sopho

In the final quarter, the Trojans
were awarded three man-up oppor
tunites. ()n the first. I JSC closed the
gap with a goal by Basso. Stanford
senior Jonathan Skaalen responded
with a goal from outside with three
minutes to go.
I JSC' received its two other 6-on

I lowever. the ( ardinal defense held
its position against the shifting IJS('
offense and secured the win.
After the game. Deltamanti
couldn't say enough about the Car
dinal defense.
Impressive individual perfor
mances, such as Skaalen's defense
against Trojan holeman James Cas
tle. contributed to the win. But most
impressive was the total team effort.
"This is the best defense we've
played all season. It's just amazing
to hold I JSC' lo three goals in their
home pool when they arc averaging
around It) a game." Dettamanti
said.

On Sunday, Stanford rode the
momentum of its victory over I JSC
to another league win over Long
Beach State (9-10,2-4).

Patrick Cochran, Stanford took
control in the second period.

that had met with so much success
against the Trojans, Stanford held
the 49crs scoreless while exploding
for live points.

/one defense for four of these points
off two-point goals by Skaalen and
freshman Peter Hudnut. The final
point came off a goal by freshman
Jeff Nesmith on a 6-on-5, making
the score 6-1 at halltimc.
In the second half. Long Beach
continued to play /one defense, al
lowing Stanford to take many shots,
Init the Cardinal players, tired from
Saturday's game, could not find the
net. However, the strong Cardinal
press preserved the victory, limiting
Long Beach to just two more goals,
one in each remaining quarter, to
make the final score 6-3.
Stanford left Southern Califor
nia with the nation's best overall
record, along with UCLA and
IJSC. With the two wins, Stanford
also improved to second place in the
