matched Washington in shots on
goal, it was the Huskies who found

the hack of the net and took sole
possession of first place.
The loss to Washington followed
a 3-1 Cardinal victory against Ore
gon State (4-9,0-3) on Friday.
Despite Friday's win. the loss to
Washington puts the Cardinal in a
vulnerable position. Stanford head
ed into Sunday's match as leader of
the MPSF division: now Washing
ton (9-4-2.4-0) remains the only un
defeated team.
Although the Huskies fell to
Stanford 2-1 in overtime last season,
the team went on to win the MPSF
and its (lawless record puts Wash
ington in good position to defend its
title this season.
Though disappointed with its
loss, the Cardinal is not disappoint
ed with its play
"In the first half we played as
good as we can play," head coach
Hobby Clark said. "We dominated
in almost every aspect. We con
trolled the back and the midfield

and Corey [Woolfolk] and Luke
[Rust) were keeping their backfield
busy."
As a result, the Cardinal created
opportunities and had its chances,
but luck seemed to be on the side of
the Huskies.
Junior midfielder Scott Leber
had a team-leading four shots that
all skirted past the goal posts, one
even clanging off the crossbar.
Just eight minutes into the sec
ond half. Husky senior midfielder
Wes I lart knocked in the game-win
ner, a rebound off a shot from
sophomore Bryn Ritchie. Hart's
goal was his second of the weekend
and led to his title of MPS! Player of
the Week.
"In the second half we started off
with the same intensity, but they
started settling in, and in the blink of

an eye they got a chance and got
lucky." sophomore defender Lee
Morrison said. "We had a lot of
chances, but we were unlucky."
"[The game] gave us a clear les
son that when it comes to big games
it all boils down to a few plays.
You've got to take the chances,"
Clark said. "Once you take chances,
the whole game changes and
they've got to come to us.
While Sunday's first half may
have been the best soccer the Cardi
nal has put together, Friday's first
half may have been the worst, Clark
said.
Stanford let in an early score as
Oregon State's Alex Close shot in
his first career goal off a joint effort
from Ben Roth and Greg Howes,
whose assist marks the 12th ol his
career, placing him in a tie for third
in the Oregon State record books.
"We really didn't respond all that
well |to their goal]," freshman mid
fielder Todd Dunivant said. "We
tried to finesse our way around
them when we needed to dig in and
fight."
Just before the end of the half,
Dunivant scored the equalizer with
his first career goal, off a cross from
redshirt junior Brandon Garinger.
Then, the second half seemed to
he a different game. Whereas the
Beavers outshot Stanford 4-2 in the
first half, Stanford turned around
and outshot Oregon State 16-2 in
the second.
"We just didn't play in the first
half," Clark said. "In the second, we
absolutely took over the game. It's
very odd how a game can change
that drastically."
Twelve minutes into the first
half, co-captain T.K. Inbody
popped in the game-winning shot
off a penalty kick.
Just three minutes later. Inbody
sent junior forward Woolfolk a pass
that Woolfolk hit in with a bicycle
kick to round out the scoring.
"[The weekend| is a good lead in
for us for our upcoming games."
Clark said. "Our remaining games
are against good competition and
this weekend highlighted the impor
tance of finishing things."
"We have to win the rest of our
games," Morrison said. "We have to
take them one game at a time and
have the attitude that we're not tak
ing any crap from anyone."
