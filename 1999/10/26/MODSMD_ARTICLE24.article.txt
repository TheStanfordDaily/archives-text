MEN'S CREW
â–  Saturday: Stanford places 16th
among collegiate teams at the I lead
of the Charles regatta in Boston,
Mass.

The Cardinal team came in 25th
out of 46 teams and placed 16th
among collegiate teams.
"For us. it's the beginning of the
fall season." said men's crew coach
Wieslaw Kujda. "For everyone
else, it's the end. Looking at how
competitive we were under the cir
cumstances. I was pretty impressed
by the level of competition by
everybody. We set many goals and
are near the range of where we
want to be."
Although at a great disadvan
tage due to Stanford's quarter sys
tem. the crew team was less than
happy about its performance at
Boston.
"We were kind of disappointed
at not rowing our best after travel
ing all the way to Boston," said se
nior co-captain Bryan Hoffman. "If
we had rowed what we were capa

hie of doing, we would have heen
one of the top 10 college crews.
"It's early in the season, and
everyone was a little hit nervous.
... We have to come hack and per
form a little hit better or at a level
more in line with our capabilities."
The crew team was troubled
with problems from the beginning.
Starting 22nd. one place in front
of the U.S. national team, the Car
dinal team was quickly outpaced.
The crew raced three boats to a nar
row bridge that only fits two, but
the team was behind and the
coxswain was forced to back off.
"Basically we didn't have luck."
Kujda said. "We got caught in the
traffic jam, which cost us a few sec
onds."
Midway through the race, the
Cardinal boat had a collision with
the boat from the Rochester Insti
tute of Technology.
"In this kind of race, passing
boats are supposed to be let by right
away," Kujda said. "The other crew
didn't oblige, so we had to park on
the outside lane, and (that] put us in
a situation where we were unable
to take a turn. The other boat
couldn't take a sharp turn and we
hit them."
"The fans loved it," Hoffman
said.
The team also had some difficul
ties because it was rowing in the
