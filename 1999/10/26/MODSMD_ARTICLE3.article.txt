# Cart thefts anger students

Janice Ta's parents promised her this year would he
different.
Ta. a sophomore who contracted polio as an infant,
found her mobility and social life severely limited after
the the theft of her golf cart last year.
She rented another golf cart this year, but on Oct. 16
at about 1:45 a.m., just as students were beginning to fil
ter back from the nearby Casino Night party, la's
boyfriend noticed her golf cart was missing.
They immediately reported it to the Stanford Police,
who found her stolen cart Friday in the Mirrelees park
ing lot.
l a's case was not unique. Stanford Police say thieves
stole seven carts in the first month of classes, six more
than last year. And the locations of the thefts suggest
Stanford students were involved.
Golf-cart theft is no joyride. Stanford Police I t. Del
Bandy said the crime carries the same penalties as steal
ing a car — both are considered grand theft auto felonies
under the law.
But the crime's greatest consequences rest with vic
tims such as Fa. Since an operation two-and-a-half years
ago to straighten out a limp. Ta has been unable to walk
without crutches. I .ast year, besides having to adjust to a

new environment and college level classes, l a had U>
learn to cope with her new limited mobility. I o make the
situation more manageable, her parents rented her a golf
cart for $150 a month.
After only ;i few weeks at Stanford, l a walked out
side one morning only to discover that her golf cart
her only way to class — had disappeared.
She had left it locked up outside of Alondra. the site
of a campus-wide party the night before.
Police found the golf cart wrecked in Palo Alto a
week later. Though the I Jniversitv was sympathetic and
offered Ta $%() to cover some of the damages. Ta didn't
buy a new golf cart, not wanting her parents to have to
pay the rest of the $2,500 cost for a cart that could be
stolen again.
Last year, the loss of I a s carl forced her to walk to
classes on crutches. Walking across campus with a hcaw
bag on her shoulders put pressure on her already weak
legs and back, leading to two stress fractures during the
course of the year. She believes the use of a golf cart
would have prevented the injuries.
Ta said her limited mobility "took away a huge part
of me," as she was unable to be as social or join the clubs
she wanted. Walking left her constantly tired.
