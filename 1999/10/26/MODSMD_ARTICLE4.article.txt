## 
### Uri Pomerantz 
A series of campus wallet thefts
seem to he the continuation of a
spring crime spree. Stanford Police
say.
A thief hit I heta Delta Chi. Serra
and l.arkin this year in robberies that
mirror those of last May and June at
the Chi Theta Chi and Sigma Chi
houses. Police believe a single man is
responsible for the thefts.
I .ast Friday, at approximately 1:3()
p.m., the burglar was allowed in by a
student at l.arkin and swiftly preced
ed to enter two open dorm rooms and
steal two wallets.
In one room, a student was sleep
ing during the robbery. In the follow
ing three hours, before the students
had time to cancel their credit cards,
the thief ran up $ 1.7(H) worth of

charges on the combined cards.
Later, a resident identified a pic
ture of the suspect as the same man
who had entered the residence hall.
The suspect is a 20-year-old white
male, who is 5 foot, (S inches tall with
medium build and short, slightly
wavy blond hair.
Police say the suspect seems to be
someone extremely familiar with the
campus, and the robberies never last
more than a few minutes.
Soon after each theft, he promptly
checks the stolen credit cards at a gas
station nearby. If the cards are active,
he proceeds to purchase large quanti
ties of goods that have ranged in the
past from home furnishings to a
leather jacket. 1 le does not. however,
return twice to a house that has been
previously hit.
Police say that he could be a stu

dent, a former student or a friend of a
student who may have noticed that
many students leave their doors
open.
I he suspect also appears to be
fairly young and unwary. Students
may mistake him for another student
and let him in. Sgt. Rick Tipton, a
member of the Stanford Dept. of
Public Safety Investigation Unit,
urged students to "keep all dorms
rooms locked. If the suspect is sight
ed, call l )l 1 immediately."
In an effort to end the ongoing
crime spree. Alex Newell, a residence
assistant in l.arkin. has been distrib
uting flyers with the suspect's picture
as well as e-niailing many students
with information about the thefts.
"My guess is that lie's targeting
the new frosh who don't recogni/e
him" she said.
