Sherman Alexie has ;i message
lor young Native Americans: It's
cool to he a I'reak.
"When I \v;is seven years old
on the [reservation]. I thought I
was the only Indian freak out
there." the writer and poet told a
packed house in Building 320 last
night. "Now I want all the little In
dian freaks like me to see this big
major Indian freak and say, 'Hey,
freakdom is cool!' "
Alexie. a Spokane / Coeur
d'Alene Indian, is the author of
collections of poetry and short
stories, including "The Lone
Ranger and lonto Fistfight in
Heaven" (on which the award
winning film "Smoke Signals"
was based) and"The Business of
Fancydancing."
He also wrote the novels
"Reservation Blues" and "Indian
Killer."
In his writing. Alexie said, "I
try to make the distance between
my art and my life as close as pos
sible." because "the more I write
about my own experiences, the
more honest I can be."
Performing his newly-written
poem "Why Indian Men Fall in
Love With While Women" and
his story "1 el's I)o It. I .et's Fall in
love." both with humorous
tones. Alexie focused on the
"huge sociological phenomenon"
of Native American men marry
ing white women.
Yet. Alexie warned audience
members not to confuse his
humor with "un-seriousness," as
suring them that what he was
speaking about was indeed seri
ous.
Native American men marry
ing white women, he said, "are
running away from their commu
nity and their tribe ... and they
think they escape being political

jList because they say, 'I love
you.'"
Alexie also warned his audi
ence not to take the vocal perfor
mance of his writings to mean that
his stories and poems are based in
oral tradition, which he considers
a stereotype of Indian culture.
"Quit calling it [oral tradi
tion]!" he implored, "because it

diminishes Ihe quality of what wc
do; it makes us sound primitive,
and implies a lack of complexity,"
as it "only points to one source of
our storytelling impulse, and
there are many."
He does want to see true Indi
an culture more universally dis

played, however. "I want to see In
dians everywhere," he said, "Indi
ans with jobs ... drunk Indians ...
Indians on TV." This exposure, he
hopes, will "open the world for
kids."
In a question-and-answer ses
sion. Alexie advised prospective
writers to "Read. Read hooks. Buy
books. Read a thousand pages for
every one you write."
Alexie's new storv collection.

"The Toughest Indian of the
World," comes out next May.
He is also planning for his
newest collection of poetry, enti
tled "One Stick Song," to come out
next spring.
He said he hopes to "create a re
sponse, a passion" in the world
through writing and also through
filmmaking, his newest undertak
ing.
"The way we change the world
the only way — is art." he said,
"because we're always going to
have more imagination than our
oppressors."
