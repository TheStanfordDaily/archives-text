## Israel opens land link between West Bank and Gaza 
### 
ERF.7. CROSSING. Gaza Strip
(AP) — Hundreds of eager Pales
tinians shouldering duffel bags and
suitcases traveled 2K miles across
Israel on Monday — inaugurating a
"sale passage" that for the first time
links the areas under their control
and takes them a step closer to state
hood.
For some, the passage by bus or
taxi between the Ga/a Strip and the
West Bank was their first glimpse
inside the country they had strug
gled against for years.
From the window of his taxi.
Sami Ahmed, a 19-year-old who had
never before left Ga/a. intently
observed the Israeli landscapes fly

ing by: communal farms pine forests
and the occasional military jeep
guarding the route.
"What are those?" he asked,
pointing to some ruins.
Fellow passenger Saber Abu
Lehieh, 70. who knew the area from
the time before Israel's creation in
1948. said they were the remains of
Beit Jibrin, an Arab village
destroyed in the 1948 Mideast war.
The safe passage between the
Ere/ Crossing in Gaza toTarkumiya
in the West Bank takes the Pales
tinians a step closer to statehood by
linking the two autonomous areas
on either side of Israel that they
hope will eventually make up their

state. The opening helped boost
Palestinian support for peacemak
ing and also enabled residents of
crowded Gaza to seek jobs in the
more prosperous West Bank.
In all, some 132,(XX) Palestinians
are so far eligible to use the route —
13(),(XX) workers and business peo
ple who have had permission to
enter Israel in the past, and 2,(XX)
who were granted special passage
permits in recent days. In the past,
those with permits could go to Israel,
but not to the other Palestinian ter
ritory.
More safe passage permits are to
be issued in coming days. Israeli offi
cials said they expected about I.(XX)

daily travelers on the route, which is
open from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.
"Careful with those travel per
mits, they are your tickets to free
dom." taxi driver Ali Mohammed
admonished his six eager passen
gers.
Arabic music blasting from his
taxi radio, Mohammed was busy
making calls on his mobile phone to
tell friends the safe passage was
open.
Abu Lehieh said he hadn't left
Gaza since the 1993 signing of the
first Israeli-Palestinian peace agree
ment. In the past six years, Israel
imposed more and more restrictions
on Palestinian travel, including blan

ket security closures, to prevent
Islamic militants from carrying out
attacks.
"The peace agreement was
signed, and the doors of Erez (cross
ing) swung shut," Abu Lehieh
recalled. However, on Monday, he
was upbeat. "Step by step, we are
getting closer to peace."
The taxi completed the trip in
about half an hour. Israel allows up
to two hours for the trip, and travel
ers are clocked upon departure and
arrival.
Those who are late can expect to
be questioned by Israeli security
forces.
On Monday the mood was pleas

ant, with Israeli officers shaking
hands with sonic travelers,
Shadi Abu Arab. 20, an unem
ployed Gaza resident who arrived in
the West Bank by bus. said he was
headed to the town of Tulkarcm to
look for a job.
"All the doors were closed to me
in Gaza, and I couldn't wait until this
door, the safe passage, opened up."
Abu Arab said, smiling broadly.
The safe passage was first negoti
ated as part of 1995 interim peace
accord. However. Israel repeatedly
delayed the opening, citing fears
that Palestinian militants would use
the route to enter Israel and carry
out terror attacks.
