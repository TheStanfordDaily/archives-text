# Netscape founder gives $150 million to Stanford
## Silicon Valley kind to Clark 
### T.J. Babbitt Editorial staff 
When journalist Michael Lewis
was looking for a unifying theme for
his new book about Silicon Valley,
something or someone who cap
tured the essence of this place at this
moment in time, he chose new Stan
ford donor Jim Clark.
According to Lewis, Clark is a
man constantly in hot pursuit of
"The New New ITiing," the title of
his book. Lewis says that "the new
new thing [is| the idea that is mo
ments from gaining general accep
tance, and, when it does, it will
change the world."
Clark has been present at the cre
ation of more than one technologi
cal watershed of the past two
decades, from the Netscape Web
browser to Silicon Graphics' three
dimensional graphics chip, which he
worked on while he was a professor
at Stanford. He has also been in
volved in new ventures such as
Healtheon, in which Clark hopes fo
radically alter data collection and

field, using the Internet as a spring
hoard. When Clark decides to invest
time, energy and money in a project,

ing to Ix'wis.
That means that Clark's decision
to embrace Stanford's interdiscipli
nary Program in Biomedical Kngi
neeing and Science is about a good
deal more than the $150 million. It's
also about having Clark 's imprimatur
on the new program.
"This is the new new thing on the
research front," said Provost John
Hennessy. I lennessy and others in
volved with the program see Bio-X as
a way to keep Stanford research on
the forefront in areas where biology
intersects with other disciplines, cou
pling biology reseach with advances
in computation, miniaturized tech
nology, engineering, chemistry and
physics.

Like Clark, supporters of the Bio-
X program do not have modest am
bitions.
"I think the Bio-X concept is so
big that we'll need another $1(X) mil
lion in the end," said Biochemistry
Prof. Jim Spudich, the head of the
Bio-X steering committee.
But while Clark's donation to
Stanford, with all that it entails, may
bring huge benefits to the University,
the relationship is not one-sided.
Clark, an associate professor in com
puter science at Stanford from 1979
to 19K2, launched his Silicon Graph
ics idea during his time here, a project
which later turned him into a multi
millionaire. That was the spring
board for his later success in Silicon
Valley, which turned him into a
multibillionaire.
"If you're allowed to be in an
academic setting and create the
springboard ol a business effective
ly without undue impediments,
then you have an obligation to re
spond in kind," Clark said in a press
release.
Clark is best known for his work
promoting the Netscape Web brows

er, so it might seem odd that he is in
volved in a biology field. But one of
Clark's latest projects is nlso related
to health sciences, albeit in a different
way than Bio-X. His new company,
Healtheon, is gambling that the In
ternet will be a good platform to
streamline healthcare recordkeeping
and data processing, eliminating
cumbersome steps in the way that pa
tients, doctors and insurance compa
nies interact.
Lewis's biography of Clark por
trays him as a restless maverick al
ways on the lookout for a way that
things need to change and new tech
nological revolutions that need to
take place. Lewis also sees him as a
man who is never satisfied with the
way things are.
In his own way. Clark agrees with
the description: "Every major change
that occurred to me in moving to a
new plateau of accomplishment —
whether in academia or business —
happened when 1 made changes. 1
think you need to mix disciplines to
create an environment that brings
about innovations and advances,"
Clark said.
