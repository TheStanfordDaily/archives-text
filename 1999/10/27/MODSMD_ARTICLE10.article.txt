## Floods continue to reak havoc throughout Mexico

VILLAHERMOSA. Mexico (AP) —
One o! Mexico's largest rivers rose to the
top ot a waist-high wall of sandbags Tues
day, threatening to inundate the heart of
this city of 475,000 people.
More water was pouring through a dam
upstream, further endangering the 22-
mile-long temporary dike. A national
emergency official said on condition of
anonymity that all of Villahermosa, a city
410 miles east of Mexico City, may have to
he evacuated.
Soldiers and workers from the National
Water Commission were doubling and in
some places tripling the height of the 4-
foot wall of sandbags holding back the
bloated Grijalva River, which passes
through Villahermosa's commercial dis
trict.
The river has risen six feet in the last
three days since authorities opened the
floodgates of Las Penitas Dam upstream,
releasing four times the amount of water
normally discharged. The dam was beyond
capacity and in danger of breaking.
"If this river goes over, it could sweep

away half the businesses in the city." said
Noe Orti/ Gonzalez, general director of
the local Chamber of Commerce.
Silt and trash slowed the flow of water
out of the floodgates, but officials, fearful
the dam could burst, cleaned the ducts
early Tuesday, sending a faster stream of
water down toward Villahermosa.
It was unclear how much that would
raise the river's level downstream.
Steady rains over the past month have
caused Hooding across the region, leaving
more than 227.0(H) people homeless in
Tabasco state alone. Local and state offi
cials across southeastern Mexico have
reported at least 404 deaths. Many bodies
have not been recovered, so the toll could
be much higher.
Officials warn that if steady ryins
resume, they may be forced to open the
floodgates of three other dams upstream
from Villahermosa. Even if that doesn't
happen, water levels at Las Penitas still
need to drop five feet before officials can
close the gates.
"We could be looking at a major disas

ter," said Jose Luis Adame. regional man
ager of the southern border for the
National Water Commission.
This week's water release pushed water
to the rooftops of already-flooded homes
and businesses and caused 60.000 people
who had stayed behind to flee their homes.
On the river, water gurgles out from
beneath the wall of sandbags. More than
60 percent of the city's businesses have
closed their doors. Dozens of merchants
along the riverwalk. the city's prime com
mercial property, have put their businesses
up for sale. Those that remain open have
blocked their entrances with knee-high
cement walls.
"It's hard to sleep at night living next to
this. It's very tense." said Raul Ramos, 30.
who moved his refrigerator, television and
other valuables to the second floor of his
home. "I've already seen the wall break
twice yesterday, but the soldiers were able
to run over and block it in time."
Once a tourist attraction, Villaher
mosa's riverwalk has turned into a silent
menace.
