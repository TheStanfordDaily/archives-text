GROZNY, Russia (AP)
Exploding artillery shells rattled
windows and spread fear in the
Chechen capital yesterday, as the
heaviest fighting in weeks brought
Russian tanks and soldiers near
the city limits. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright called the situ
ation ominous and expressed con
cern with civilian casualties.
Chechen fighters battled the
Russians within two milos of
Grozny's northern edge, while
more fighting raged to the east of
the city. There were unconfirmed
reports that elite Russian recon
naissance troops had entered

Grozny.
Russian jets and artillery else
where bombarded at least seven
towns and settlements across
Chechnya on Tuesday, officers on
both sides said.
Up to 2l)() Russian tanks and
self-propelled artillery pieces led
the fiercest assaults in the Terek
Ridge area, the strategic heights
northwest of Grozny's airport, said
Gen. Mumadi Saidayev. a top
Chechen military official.
T he Chechens claimed they had
knocked out several tanks and
inflicted heavy losses on a Russian
column advancing from the south
-P..

east, but no independent confirma
tion was available.
Residents of the battered
Chechen capital were gripped with
fear and hopelessness ahead of the
region harsh winter season.
"Many of those who have
stayed in Grozny feel doomed,"
said resident Asva Lalayeva, com
plaining that officials in both the
Russian and Chechen govern
ments "see them as raw material."
Russian officials have given
mixed signals about whether they
plan to storm Grozny in their cam
paign to wipe out Islamic militants
based in Chechnya. After early

successes, the Russian military
now appears to be trying lo occupy
all of the republic and end its de
fact o i n d e pen den ce.
Speaking in Washington.
Albright urged Russia "not to
repeat the mistakes of the past in
Chechnya, and instead lo open a
dialogue toward a peaceful resolu
tion with legitimate Chechen part
ners."
Casualties in the latest fighting
are unknown. The Russians say
they have lost some 200 soldiers
and killed 2.000 militants overall,
while the Chechens claim lo have
lost far fewer fighters and killed

many Russians.
Chechen officials reported that
Russian troops seized the town of
Sernovodsk, 27 miles west of
Grozny, and that heavy fighting
was continuing in Gudermes. a city
20 miles east of Grozny.
Chechen President Asian
Maskhadov told reporters that
there was heavy fighting in Tol
stoy-Yurt. north of Grozny, but
admitted that Chechen fighters
could do little against the numeri
cally superior Russians in the rela
tively open region.
Saidayev said his fighters warn
ed the Russians to enter Grozny,

where Chechen guerrillas inflicted
severe losses on them in street
fighting during the 1994-96
Chechen war.
"But they won't do it because
they know that they would be
crushed," he said.
Chechen commanders said
Tuesday they believe the Russians
want to take Grozny's airport and
set up a headquarters.
"The airport is a very conve
nient place to stay during the win
ter," said Saidayev. "Because they
would feel very uncomfortable
staying on the Terek Ridge for a
long time."
