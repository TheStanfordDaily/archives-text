Creation of a true student
union would enhance
quality of life on campus

GIVFN THAT the center of
campus is not within short
walking distance of areas
such as downtown Palo Alto or the
California Avenue neighborhood,
why doesn't the University have a
recreational center on campus with
a more satisfactory selection of eat
ing establishments and retail
stores?
Student unions are staples at
other universities. DC-Berkeley's,
for example, contains a large food
court, an array of shops and a pool
hall / arcade, even though the cam
pus sils on the edge of Telegraph
Avenue, giving the Cal student even
more choices for food and recre
ation.
Stanford students, however, must
make do with the services offered
by Tresidder Union, which current
ly leaves something to be desired.
There are two concerns that the
University must address when deal
ing with this problem. The first is
variety of service. For food, stu
dents may choose between the
Tresidder cafeteria, small cafes in
department buildings and Polio Rey
during daytime hours.
But during the evening, with the
perpetual unavailability of the Cof
fee House, only Polio Rev and the
Corner Pocket remain open, so for
the hungry student at K p.m. who is
not in llie mood for grease or over
priced Mexican food, the choices
are essentially limited to snack
foods.
For other necessities, the only
places to go are the Bookstore and
Tresidder Express, neither of which
can offer much in the way of selec

tion when you run out of your
brand of soap (unless you use Clin
ique, in which case the Bookstore is
your perfect source).
The oilier concern is that the
resources on campus should he
compatible with a student's
lifestyle. Days that end at 10 or 11
p.m. are almost unheard of among
most students. Rather, there are
essays to write, computer programs
to code and activities to participate
in that will keep a student up well
into the early hours of the morning.
For students who do not live in
residences with open kitchens and
do not have access to vehicular
transportation, food after 1 a.m. is
nearly impossible to obtain conve
niently, with the exception of deliv
ered pizza.
Stanford is primarily an institu
tion of learning. However, with the
number of students living on cam
pus, the University has a responsi
bility to provide for students' needs
outside of the academic domain by
doing its best to offer services con
ducive to comfortable day-to-day
living at a cost that fits the students
budget. Especially in light of the
decision to disallow freshmen to
have cars on campus, effective next
year, the University needs to make
up for the pedestrian's relative iso
lation from urban centers and
resources.
Granted, real estate is not cheap.
Perhaps building another facility is
not the answer. But as space is
vacated in Tresidder, as it has in the
past and will continue to do so, the
University should consider careful
ly how to reallocate the space in a
way that provides the most benefit
to the student community. As usual,
student input will prove indispens
able in shaping what could poten
tially become a more complete and
convenient student union.
