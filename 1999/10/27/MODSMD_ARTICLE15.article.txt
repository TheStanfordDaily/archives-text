## So you want to be a yell leader?

IT SEEMS all it takes
to be a Stanford yell
leader these days is a
red Hawaiian shirt and a
goofy Stanford hat.
Don't get me wrong: I
think having yell leaders is
the best thing since the

student body voted to change the mascot in
the '70s from the Stanford Indians to the
Stanford Robberbarrons (with the Stan
ford Steaming Manhole Covers coming in a
close second, until then-lJniversity Presi
dent Richard Lyman decided that Cardinal
would be more appropriate).
And for those seniors who remember
the Stanford cheerleaders, you know the
yell leaders are a welcome change. (No, I'm
not talking about the Dollies. We actually
had cheerleaders my freshman year, and all
I remember is that they had a "NOISE"
sign.)
We now, finally, have a huge, red Stan
ford flag to rival the flags from any other
school that might or might not happen to
be across the Bay. For the first time in a
long while, there is a group of yell leaders
who actually know how to do the Axe yell
correctly. But most importantly, the first of
this new generation of yell leaders helped
make the Stanford student section look and
sound good.
Unfortunately something has gone
astray this year.
More than once I've watched the stu
dent section start a cheer, and a few

moments later the veil leaders turn around,
realize the students were cheering and then
"lead" the cheer. Many have pointed out
the "yell faux pas" when the yell leaders
encouraged the Stanford students to cheer
on our own third down earlier this year
(and now it's still hard to keep everyone
quiet when we have the ball and it's third
and goal).
Fear not. I just happen to he in the mid
dle of writing a book on how to support
Stanford Athletics, and decided I'd use my
column this week to give you a preview of
the "How to he a Yell Leader" section.
Chapter 8: Know Who You're Leading
Despite what the current yell leaders
seem to think, the average Stanford stu
dent's vocabulary does not solely consist of
"let's", "go" and a variations of "Stanford"
or "Cardinal." Take the stunning "Go Card
one-time on three" cheer for example.
Stanford students actually like to think
they are smarter than the average bear (or
at least the average Weenie). Consequent
ly, we'd rather yell something clever
instead of "Here we go Stanford ... here
we go" any day of the week. What ever
happened to the Fibonacci yell or "Tra
verse the field, traverse the field, increase
the aggregate yardage" that was so popular
at the UCLA game?
Something is definitely not right when
we chant "high school band" at the goose
stepping antics of the USC or California
bands. But it smacks of hypocrisy when we
use cheers that bring back foggy memories

of high school football games.
Chapter 9: Never a Dull Moment
The yell leaders are responsible for
keeping the students engaged in the game.
You can't expect the students to be making
noise during every one of our opponent's
third downs if you let them sit down and
lose interest in between those crucial third
downs.
1 know as committed fans of Stanford
Athletics (why else would you be a yell
leader?) the yell leaders want to watch the
game. 1 sympathize with them, but their job
is to make sure that the team feels our sup
port throughout every minute of the game,
not just the last few.
In the end. the yell leaders are the cata
lyst for getting the Stanford students on
their feet and screaming, which is a more
powerful weapon against an opposing
offense than many of us think. Our yelling
during the last few minutes of the Oregon
State game forced them to take a precious
timeout because their quarterback couldn't
hear a thing. Just imagine the havoc we, the
students, can wreak on the Cal offense dur
ing Big Game.
For now, the yell leaders need to get
their act together or be prepared to suffer
the same fate as the Stanford cheerleaders.
