Warnings against misguided
charity
While I applaud Murium Ali for her
stance on "fashionable cynicism," ("A few
thoughts on needing to overcome cyni
cism.") I'd like to caution against misguid
ed charity.
I've seen the beggar children she
describes. When I walked out into the
streets of I ima. Peru, they were shocking
to me. I had never seen such poverty in the
face of children, and I tried to give some
thing to every single one.
Hut after talking with the kids and
meeting their counterparts in Belize, Hon
duras and Mexico, my perspective
changed. Many of them were employed by
adults, waiting and watching from the
street corners to tuke the money that their
adorable, unhappy faces could elicit from
the guilt and sympathy of Western
tourists. Effectively pimps, these adults
might be family members or strangers —
the kids might be willing participants or
not. I started substituting food for money,
but that doesn't solve the problem either.
Interestingly, you won't find any beg
gars in the highlands of Peru except ut
Mucchu Picchu, though people there are
equally poor. In Niger, West Africa, the
poorest country in the world (and not a
very popular tourist destination). I didn't
see a single beggar who wasn't either a
Koranic student or disabled in some way.
Begging follows tourism, and poverty is
only poverty when the gap between rich
and poor is wide, as in Lima or the Car
ribean const. Hundouts only exacerbate

the problem.
For example: a friend of mine is a soil
scientist and Peace Corps volunteer in a
village of 300 people in Niger. I've met
them and they're good people — fun.
happy, despite the often dirty faces that, if
seen on a TV commercial with sad music
might make you think they were miser
able. Sometimes they do get hungry
though, and this comes largely from the
fact that although Western medicine has
lowered the infant mortality rate to 10 per
cent. they're still having as many babies as
when only 10 percent lived. In the last 20
years, this explosion in population has led
to massive deforestation and the Sahara
creeps closer every year, sweeping away
their soil with the annual Harmattan
winds. The land doesn't produce as much
millet, yet there are more people to feed,
so sometimes they get hungry.
This year, a Western relief organization
didn't make it to my friend's village, but
two years ago it did. When the village
elders heard the organization was coming,
they cut down all their millet crops early,
abandoning the harvest so they could tell
the relief organization they had no food.
Relief should be a supplement, not a sub
stitute. but I'm not sure it should even be
that. The solution to poverty takes much
more than a casual, guilt-driven commit
ment. Throwing money at a problem from
the outside only makes the recipients
dependent on the handouts, when what
they really need is a viuble source of
income for themselves. The real solutions
lie in grassroots-based education and job
training (especially for women), invest

ment in third-world business and dissemi
nation of birth control.
Our generation is in a position to end
poverty. That doesn't mean putting bush
kids in suburbia, but it does mean giving
them the opportunity to go there, via edu
cation and responsible financial decisions.
I still feel terrible when kids approach
me with those big sorry eyes, but 1 remind
myself that although it's not fair that I was
born in America, it's not my fault either.

Freshman advising system
functioning well
Monday's editorial, "A sound bit of
advice," does a disservice to the Stanford
community by discounting the valuable
contributions of the many University staff
members, alumni, graduate students, and
postdoctoral fellows who serve as fresh
man advisers.
The editorial states that freshman
advising at Stanford is inadequate, and
goes on to blame that on the fact that most
freshman advisers are not actually faculty
members.
However, the notion that non-faculty
advisers "detract from the educational
experiences" of freshman, or fail to "serve
as intellectual role-models and provide
guidance regarding long-range academic
paths" is at best misguided, at worst an
outright insult to the experience and dedi
cation of most advisers.
Does The Daily believe that a staff

member or graduate student lacks the
intellectual or academic experience to
serve as a role model to a student barely
out of high school? Why does it take an
advanced degree and a faculty position at
Stanford to provide perspective and guid
ance on the first year of an undergradu
ate's career? Freshman advisers are edu
cated people who are putting their educa
tion to use in ways that include but are not
restricted to academia. Are there not valu
able perspectives to be had in all their
experiences?
Further, the assumption that a fresh
man adviser's academic status is the sole
measure of their usefulness is a shortsight
ed one. As an advising associate last year,
I had the privilege of working with an FA
who was a valuable resource for the fresh
men in our group not because she was a
faculty member (although she was) but
because of her interest in and dedication
to advising. My own freshman advisor, an
administrative staff member, was a simi
larly valuable resource for the same rea
sons.
Good advising comes out of a desire to
get to know the advisees and their inter
ests and needs, and a willingness to share
the wisdom acquired through one's own
academic experiences. The Daily's care
less dismissal of so many people who pos
sess these characteristics and apply them
as freshman advisers is an affront to them
and to all the students who have benefit
ted from their guidance.

poverty. That doesn't mean putting bush
kids in suburbia, but it does mean giving
them the opportunity to go there, via edu
cation and responsible financial decisions.
I still feel terrible when kids approach
me with those big sorry eyes, but 1 remind
myself that although it's not fair that I was
born in America, it's not my fault either.

Freshman advising system
functioning well
Monday's editorial, "A sound bit of
advice," does a disservice to the Stanford
community by discounting the valuable
contributions of the many University staff
members, alumni, graduate students, and
postdoctoral fellows who serve as fresh
man advisers.
The editorial states that freshman
advising at Stanford is inadequate, and
goes on to blame that on the fact that most
freshman advisers are not actually faculty
members.
However, the notion that non-faculty
advisers "detract from the educational
experiences" of freshman, or fail to "serve
as intellectual role-models and provide
guidance regarding long-range academic
paths" is at best misguided, at worst an
outright insult to the experience and dedi
cation of most advisers.
Does The Daily believe that a staff

member or graduate student lacks the
intellectual or academic experience to
serve as a role model to a student barely
out of high school? Why does it take an
advanced degree and a faculty position at
Stanford to provide perspective and guid
ance on the first year of an undergradu
ate's career? Freshman advisers are edu
cated people who are putting their educa
tion to use in ways that include but are not
restricted to academia. Are there not valu
able perspectives to be had in all their
experiences?
Further, the assumption that a fresh
man adviser's academic status is the sole
measure of their usefulness is a shortsight
ed one. As an advising associate last year,
I had the privilege of working with an FA
who was a valuable resource for the fresh
men in our group not because she was a
faculty member (although she was) but
because of her interest in and dedication
to advising. My own freshman advisor, an
administrative staff member, was a simi
larly valuable resource for the same rea
sons.
Good advising comes out of a desire to
get to know the advisees and their inter
ests and needs, and a willingness to share
the wisdom acquired through one's own
academic experiences. The Daily's care
less dismissal of so many people who pos
sess these characteristics and apply them
as freshman advisers is an affront to them
and to all the students who have benefit
ted from their guidance.
