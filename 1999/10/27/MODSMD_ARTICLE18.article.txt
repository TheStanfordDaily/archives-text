## 
### Susan Cameron 
Margaret Neale, a professor and
associate dean for academic affairs
in the Graduate School of Business,
was recently selected to receive the
1999 Jaedicke Silver Apple Award,
given annually by the Stanford
Business School Alumni Associa
tion in recognition of outstanding
service to Business School gradu
ates.
Neale gave continuing-educa
tion lectures about resource alloca
tion and collaboration to alumni
chapters across the United States

and abroad, including several pre
sentations over the years to the
alumni association's annual
Women's Conferences.
Neale joked that she had "to go
to Paris and give a talk to a room
filled with people who thought what
I had to say was interesting," to get
the award.
Trips to places such as France
and Australia are just one of the
perks of Neale's job.
Cathy Castillo, director of news
and publications at the Business
School, said that another benefit of
the job is that "it gives Business

School professors the opportunity
to talk with alumni and learn what
issues are important to them in
today's business world, and then
relay this perspective to the current
students of the school."
These aspects of her job have left
Nealy feeling "a little guilty for tak
ing an award for doing things that
make me feci really good."
The award is named for Robert
K. Jaedicke, an emeritus dean of the
Business School.
Neale accepted the award on
Oct. 16 during the Reunion Home
coming Weekend activities.
