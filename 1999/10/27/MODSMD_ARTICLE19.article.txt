# Late night workouts might soon be possible
## Tresidder gym may extend hours 
### Nathaniel Tulloch 
The ASSU and Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais are working to ex
tend Tresidder Fitness Center
hours later into the night. However,
it may not happen for a while.
More than 4(X) students per day
find time to work out in the 3,(X)0-
square-foot fitness center between
7 a.m. and 10 p.m. on weekdays and
K a.m. and 10 p.m. on weekends.
As students try to fit workout
time into their schedules, they end
up in the fitness center at pre
dictable times each day. The facility
is most crowded, according to se
nior Ann Thananopavarn, who
works in the fitness center, between
4 and 6 p.m. and 7 and 9 p.m. on
weekdays, and also on weekend af
ternoons.

There are enough people that, at
peak hours, some may have to wait
a couple of minutes to use the ma
chines, especially the bikes, tread
mills and stair-climbing machines.
Facility manager Fred Stevens is
not sure if the hours can be expand
ed much more because it is a stu
dent-run facility.
"It's sometimes hard to schedule
students for late nights and week
end hours," Stevens said.
But some students said they
would work out late at night if the
gym was open.
"I definitely would." said fresh
man Trevor Martin. "It's easier for
me to go to bed late than get up ear
lier."
ASSU president Mike Levin
said, "Somewhere along the line,
the hours will be opened further at

night, perhaps to 12 or 2 [a.m.],
maybe with the beginning of winter
quarter."
In the meantime, the weight
room in the Arrillaga Family Sports
Center is open to all students from
11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. to 11
p.m. weekdays, and noon to S p.m.
on weekends.
Farther across campus for most
students. Arrillaga is more spacious
and generally less crowded. Unlike
Tresidder, Arrillaga has more free
weights, but lacks stair-climbing
machines and treadmills.
Many students prefer to work
out on these aerobic-exercise ma
chines.
According to Stevens, some
bikes at Tresidder Fitness Center
have racked upwards of 42,000
miles in the center's two years.
