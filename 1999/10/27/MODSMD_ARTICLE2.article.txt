### Anuj Gupta Editorial staff 
AT# press confidence in
tion's capital yesterday, Law Prof.
Tom Campbell, a Republican Con
gressman from California's 15th dis
trict, announced his intention to run
for the U.S. Senate in 20(H). placing
his tenured status at Stanford in peril.
Campbell, who hopes to defeat
popular Democratic incumbent Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, has formed an ex
ploratory committee that he said will
almost definitely become a full-
Hedged candidacy for the seat. He
will give up his seat in the House in
order to campaign for the Senate.

"I'm attempting a very important
step. Being a good enough [senator)
is not good enough. I hope It) he the
bcit; California Reserves no less."
Campbell said.
Campbell's future at Stanford
A professor at Stanford Law
Sehool since 1983, Campbell said he
hopes his decision to run for the Sen
ate will not affect his abilities to teach
here.
"I hope to continue as a teacher at
Stanford whatever my future holds.
I've taught at least one class every
year since I've been in Congress;
teaching is a very important part of

my life," he said.
Remaining a tenured faculty
member at Stanford may not he so
easy, however. According lu tbii San
Francisco Chronicle, Law School
Dean Kathleen Sullivan has told
Campbell he must either return to
Stanford full time or lose his tenured
status.
The Chronicle reported that
Campbell has been promised he can
return to his position at the Law
School if his campaign is unsuccess
ful. Sullivan was not available for
comment, but in a statement last
month, said, "We are involved in on
going discussions about how he
might possibly integrate his future
political and academic careers."
Campbell said he has had discus
sions with the University about his
tenure but did not disclose their con
tents. "I am going to keep some mat
ters of discussion private," he said.
Campbell has held public office
since IW. when he was first elected
to the 1 louse. I le served a term in the
State Senate beginning in 1993, and
then returned to Congress in 1995.
Despite his other commitments,
Campbell maintains that he has been
able to remain involved with his
teaching duties. "I've been in the
classroom every year since 1983," he
said.
1 le currently teaches a Constitu
tional Law seminar to undergradu
ates at the Stanford in Washington
program, which is held weekly at 7:30
a.m.
"1 love teaching; 1 don't know any

Rep. Tom Campbell, a professor in the law school, has announced
that he is almost certainly going to run for Sen. Dianne Feinstein's
(D-Calif.) Senate seat next year, if he were to win, he could lose his
tenured position at Stanford.
better way to say that than that I
teach a class at 7:30 in the morning."
Campbell remarked.
The Congressman's views
In the press conference, Camp
bell described himself as a "fiscal
conservative but social moderate.'
touting his distinction as the Con
gressman whose office spent the least
money for two years in a row.
However, on social issues, many
of Campbell's positions tend toward
traditionally Democratic views. I le
supports gun-control laws and abor
tion rights, as well as domestic part
nership registration for same-sex
partners.

According to Campbell, the Sen
ate is especially hospitable to "inde
pendent" legislators, as he described
himself. " The atmosphere in the Sen
ate is much to my liking. Senators
seem to operate with a lot more inde
pendence." he said.
Campbell aroused anger among
many constituents in his majority-
Democratic district by voting to im
peach President Bill Clinton last
year.
( ampbell said he would continue
his efforts to eliminate affirmative
action if elected senator. He was a
strong supporter of the Proposition
209 ballot initiative that was passed
by voters in 1996, which banned af
firmative action in all state govern
ment institutions, including admis
sions at University of California
schools.
"It's wrong for the government to

separate us on the basis of our race. I
believe it's unconstitutional as well as
wrong, and that's why I"will fight
against it,"he said.
An underdog effort
Feinstein is considered a heavy
favorite to retain her Senate seat in
the general election next November.
The latest Field Poll places Fein
stein as the strong leader in the race,
showing her receiving 55 percent of
the vote among likely voters in Cali
fornia's open primary.
Campbell was in second place in
the poll, but with a mere 11 percent
of the vote. In a hypothetical gener
al election match-up, the poll shows
Feinstein defeating Campbell 55
percent to 30 percent.
Campbell declined to comment
on Feinstein, saying he wanted to

focus on his own campaign for the
time being.
"1 need to tell people of Califor
nia who 1 am. what I believe in and
why I believe in it. We'll get to [dis
tinctions between myself and Fein
stein]." he said.
Campbell did. however, express
confidence in his own prospects as a
senator. "Sen. Feinstein has been a
good senator, but I believe 1 could be
a better senator," he said.
In his previous bid for statewide
election — a 1992 Senate race —
Campbell lost the Republican pri
mary to conservative commentator
Bruce 1 lerschensohn, who was de
feated in the general election by De
mocrat Barbara Boxer.
This time around, Silicon Valley
entrepreneur Ron Unz, a Palo Alto
resident, is thought to be Campbell's
chief rival for the Republican nomi

nation.
Campbell said he hopes Stanford
students will use their knowledge of
technology and the Internet to get
involved with his campaign, which
he plans to use extensively. I lis Web
site was named by The Wall Street
Journal as California's best political
site.
Beyond the Senate?
During his press conference,
Campbell joked that his aspirations
at Stanford may lie higher than a
tenured professorship.
When asked by a San Jose disc
jockey via conference call whether
his Senate run was a warmup for an
eventual run for President. Camp
bell fired back, "Was that [for Presi
dent] of the U.S. or of Stanford Uni
versity?"
