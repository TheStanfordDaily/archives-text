Stanford whatever my future holds.
I've taught at least one class every
year since I've been in Congress;
teaching is a very important part of

my life," he said.

member at Stanford may not he so
easy, however. According lu tbii San

Dean Kathleen Sullivan has told
Campbell he must either return to
Stanford full time or lose his tenured
status.
The Chronicle reported that
Campbell has been promised he can
return to his position at the Law
School if his campaign is unsuccess
ful. Sullivan was not available for
comment, but in a statement last
month, said, "We are involved in on
going discussions about how he
might possibly integrate his future
political and academic careers."
Campbell said he has had discus
sions with the University about his
tenure but did not disclose their con
tents. "I am going to keep some mat
ters of discussion private," he said.
Campbell has held public office
since IW. when he was first elected
to the 1 louse. I le served a term in the
State Senate beginning in 1993, and
then returned to Congress in 1995.
Despite his other commitments,
Campbell maintains that he has been
able to remain involved with his
teaching duties. "I've been in the
classroom every year since 1983," he
said.
