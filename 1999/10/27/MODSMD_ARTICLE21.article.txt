# Prehistoric Man Read on Toilet
## 
### 
In an eCircle that archeolo
gist David Parkens uses to keep
in touch with follow archeolo
gists, Parkens shared liis recent
discovery that cave etchings
were created for the purpose
of providing Neanderthal men
with reading material while
they sat on rock toilets.
The buffaloes, clouds, and
depictions of people were also
created while the men were
seated, Parkens believes. The
discovery was made after an
assistant remarked on the odd
height of the etchings, which
looked like they were made

"from a crouched" position.
"We were always so distracted
by the masterpieces that lined the
walls," Parkens said, "we never
gave much thought to the odd
shaped rocks lining the floor."
Typing on his laptop from a site
122 miles west of Nairobi, Kenya,
Parkens said the mish-mash of
styles has led his team to conclude
that the etchings were the work of
a number of artists.
The artists probably worked on
their pieces, Parkens theorizes,
before moving to another "seat"
and allowing the next Neanderthal
to read and respond to his work

from the now-empty seat, in a
perverse game of musical toilets.
The scene in the cave following
a large meal, David Parkens
conceded, "must have been a
curious one, indeed."
While Parkens considers the
find "enlightening", lie worries
about the change that may occur
in how we view cave paintings all
over the world, especially after the
responses from other et'irclers
"So we should no longer view
the caves as galleries where club
toting Michelangelos unburdened
their souls," archeologist Jane
Finey asked in the discussion area,

"but perhaps more like a rest
room where middle-schoolers
trade notes while they poop?"
"Judging by the long time
needed to etch them," typed
Bill Thomas "should we infer
that Neanderthals were often
constipated?"
"The thing we MUST keep
in mind," David implored his
fellow archeologists "is that
cave etchings are STILL won
drous works of beauty, and
contain a wealth of information
about Stone Age life. Regardless
of the circumstances in which
they were made."
