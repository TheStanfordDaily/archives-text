While chatting with a couple of
friends in his eCircle, Jake Ashkins,
a student at Rambling University,
in Michigan, told how he more or
less stumbled onto a great way to
lose weight.
"As you know, I've always been
one large fellow," he wrote his two
best friends.
"You can say that again," typed
back Tom Sherman, from Sasquatch
University.
"You take tip space," replied Jim
Peters at Mile High College in
Illinois. "You're a house."
"Well,'' continued Jake, "as it
happens, I spent all my money at
the local greasy spoon, arid all I
had left over was a pile of change
for the candy machine at the end of
the hall."

For a week, Jake subsisted on
devil's food cake, jellybeans, and
jawbreakers, washing each down
with a 20 oz bottle of cola.
"At the end of the week," Jake
continued, "my pants kept falling
down on the way to class. I began
to realize my rolls were rolling
back. I was feeling more alive and
invigorated, like how you feel after
a long hard run, though I don't
know what that feels like first
hand. Soon, my days were spent
playing games in the sunshine, and
I quit sobbing over trashy romance
novels with the blinds drawn. Life
has become worth living again."
Tom and Jim's first reaction
Wits disbelief. When Jake posted
pictures of his new lithe self
in their eCircle, Jim and Tom
chided Jake that maybe he was
onto something.
"Maybe you could write down
your experiences in a health manu
al," Tom said.
"The Jellybean Zone," suggested
Jim Peters.
Jake documented his findings,
and put them into a book form,
which he later sold to Leo Press.
After some editing, the book was
released, entitled: "The Ash kins
Diet Rebellion." Jake's book is
currently outselling all other diet
books, and has remained at the
top of the best-seller list for the last
L3 weeks.
