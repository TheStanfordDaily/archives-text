# Study Reveals Ping Pong Players Have Most Sex
## 
### 
Members of an eCircle dedicated
to tin 1 study of human sexuality are
about to release a report claiming
that ping pong players have seven
teen times as much sex as non-ping
pongers. "It's fascinating," said
Heidi Bryant, Professor of Sexuality
at Dunkirk Tech, "Simply put, ping
pong enthusiasts "do it" more than
the rest of us."
Professor Bryant's eCircle
includes sexuality experts from all
fifty states, as well as Madagascar.
Over the past 27 months, the schol
ars have been sharing scads of data
in their eCircle, including statistics,
one-on-one interviews and photos.
"When the results of our study
came in, we ;U1 just kind of slapped
our hands on our foreheads
and said 'dull"', Bryant recalled.
"Traditionally, the Chinese have
dominated international ping pong
competitions, and look at the
birthrate in that country!"

Professor Bryant went on to say
that the group still doesn't know
what it is about ping pong that
promotes copious amounts ol sex.
"We suspect the fast-paced frenzy
of the game gets the old blood
pumping, and players need an
outlet. But some of the experts
in our eCircle believe it has more
to do with gripping the small
wooden paddles for hours at a
time." A few awkward moments of
silence followed.
Thee Circle group now fac<\s the
daunting challenge of figuring out
if people can jumpstart their sex
lives by taking up ping pong, or
whether there has to be some type
of genetic predisposition for the
game. A study is currently planned,
where players will compete in a
large tent outside a motel.
Other indicators of highly sexod
individuals included sparkling and
bug collecting.
