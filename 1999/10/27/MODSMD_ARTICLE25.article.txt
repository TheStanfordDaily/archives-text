La Nina and El Nino's Angst-Ridden
Illegitimate Son Slams Tiny Pacific
Island With 34-Day Blizzard
Typing from a portable computer to friends in
her eCircle yesterday, M;iry Simpson described the
dire situation at Kokcna, a tiny island just off
the Western coast of New Guinea. Ms. Simpson
also used her eCircle to share photos of the storm
damage, which her friends described as "super,
super scary." Mary Simpson is studying in Kokena

a.s pari of a biology program run by Tidewater
State, a small college in Florida.
"We've had to make long-sleeved winter clothing
out of palm fronds," wrote Mary. "The natives have
smashed our microscopes, sunken our boat, and
make us crawl around for our food because they
think it's our fault. I don't know how much longer
we can hold out." Her eCircle friends, along
with her university and one member of the U.S.
Government, are arranging a relief operation for
the island as quickly as possible.
