## Controversy over patenting of genes 
### Bruce Wang Editorial staff 
Should genes be patented? This
question is at the center of a recent
controversy ignited by biotech
firms racing to patent a type of
gene fragments called expressed
sequence tags.

A gene is a region of DNA that
controls a discrete hereditary char
acteristic. Genes govern inherited
traits such as eye color, blood type
and influence our susceptibility to
many diseases. More than 1 ()().()()()
genes reside in the nucleus of every
cell in our body.
Scientists have known for a long
time that genes are involved in the
development of human maladies.
Much research is being performed
on finding the genes responsible
for these illnesses, but results have
been slow to come by.
Now, scientists believe that
ESTs can be used as beacons for
identifying those genes important
for diseases such as heart disease,
cancer and other maladies.
ESTs are short sequences of
DNA that are expressed in a given
cell. Although each cell contains
the entire set of genes in a person,
not all of those genes are needed in
each cell.
Studies have shown that cells
use only a small fraction of their
lull complement of genes, the rest
simply sit dormant in the nucleus.
I he genes that are used are said to
be expressed in the cell.
Since only a small set of genes
are expressed in each cell, scientists
reasoned that those genes
expressed in a heart or a prostate
cell must be important, and thus
likely to be involved in causing dis
ease.
Once identified, these
be used as markers for drug devel
opers to zero in on those genes
that may be involved in causing
heart disease or cancer. This in
turn will help scientists better
understand the cause of many
human diseases.
With this in mind. Bay Area
biotech firms such as Incyte Phar
maceuticals and Hyseq are vying
with East Coast rivals such as Mil
lennium Pharmaceuticals, Celera
Genomics and Human Genome
Sciences to identify—and patent —
ESTs as fast as they can. The com
panies can then develop diagnostic
marker kits that they could sell to
drug developers.
Hut some influential scientists
think that ESTs should not be
patentable. David Botstein, profes
sor and cfiair of the genetics
department and former scientific
director at Genentech, is one of

them.
Botstein believes that instead of
quickening the procedure for find
ing new drugs. EST patents could
retard drug development. By
patenting ESTs, biotech firms
could demand royalties from drug
discovery firms. This might dis
courage drug developers from per
forming the research needed to
understand a gene's function and
produce a drug.
"It is dangerous to go into a sit
uation where you have these
potential blocking patents hanging
over you," Botstein said.
Other scientists argue that the
way ESTs are discovered goes
against the spirit of scientific dis
covery and thus ESTs should not
be patentable. Companies in the
EST race run genetic samples
through DNA-sequencing ma
chines. The machines automatical
ly identify expressed genes in each
cell. However, this process doesn't
reveal what a gene does —only that
it does something.
Bruce Alberts, president of the
National Academy of Sciences and
one of the opponents of patenting
ESTs, believes that the method of
discovering ESTs "involves very
little effort and almost no originali
ty," and thus should not count as a
scientific discovery worthy of a
patent.
Even some of the biotech firms
involved in the EST race question
whether these fragmentary strands
should be patented. Lewis Gruber,
chief executive of Hyseq. said he
only applied for EST patents after
the Patent Office said it would look
favorably upon such applications.
Most in the biotech industry
however, scoff at the objections.
Incyte's Whitfield, for example,
said that it is the self-interest of the
patent-holders to license broadly
their findings.
So far. about 1 ().()()() EST patent
applications have reached the
Patent Office. However, according
to Todd Dickinson, acting commis
sioner of patents and trademarks,
only three EST patents have been
issued.
The low rate of approval is sur
prising. especially given that the
first applications were filed in the
early '90s. The recent controversy
surrounding ES'Fs has prompted
the Patent Office to move even
more slowly than usual to issue
these patents.
The slow pace of patent
approval doesn't mean that the
Patent Office is against patenting
ESTs.
According to Dickinson, no
negative effects of patenting ESTs
has been brought to his attention.
"Other than speculative concern,
no one has shown any harm," he
said.
Some experts, however, believe
that concerns may arise when the
backlogged patents begin to issue.
For one thing, it is possible for two
companies to have filed patents for
different fragments of the same
gene and win competing patents.
These companies will not know
that they have conflicting claims
until they both try to enforce their
own patents on the same gene.
Despite these issues, the biotech
firms continue to increase their
bids for EST stakes. "The more
claims, the better,'" said Hyseq's
Gruber. "At the end of the day,
they may be valuable as bargaining
chips."
