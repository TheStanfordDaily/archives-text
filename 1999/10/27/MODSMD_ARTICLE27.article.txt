# Ticking population clock hits 6 billion

### Monya De Contributing writer 
Every New Year's Day, newspapers aeross
America run a feature story on the birth of that
town's first baby of the new year. It's a joyous
event, symbolic of hope and renewal. A little boy
born recently received a similar anointing—but
this time, a title heavy with grim implications.
World population watchdogs had declared
Tuesday, Oct. 12, as the day the world's popula
tion would reach six billion. Adrian Nevic. 15
days old today, was named Baby Six Billion at a
Sarajevo hospital by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
While the true Baby Six Billion is statistically
likely to have been born to a poor woman in
India, the United Nations decided to bestow the
title in the city Annan was scheduled to visit on
the designated day.
In an age of greater life expectancy and
decreased infant mortality across the globe, offi
cials in international development and popula
tion control have expressed grave concern about
the sustainability of such eye-popping growth.
The statistics are hard to believe: in 40 years,
the population of the globe has doubled, and
one-sixth of the world lives in poverty.
Such numbers call into question the world's
potential for providing food, clean water, health
care and other necessities for so many people.
Even more ominous is the fact that there were
only three million Earth inhabitants a short thou
sand years ago.
The success of human endeavors in trans
portation. agriculture and health have raised the
question of how much success is a good thing.
Often cited by experts is the relative lack of mod
em plagues and famines, the natural checks on
population.
The purpose of nearly all human effort is
development or improvement, but population
control may be a measure necessary to fully real

ize the benefits of those endeavors.
A report by the United-Nations Population
Fund estimates a world population of 8.9 billion
by the year 2050. I he population explosion of the
last 12 years occurred principally in sub-Saharan
Africa and South and West Asia.
Today, India and China tend to be principal
targets in efforts to control population with glob
al consequences in mind, as India is scheduled to
exceed China's population. 1.25 billion, accord
ing to the CIA. in a matter of years.
Their respective governments have been
actively involved in family planning: India has
reinvented its family planning action plan seven
times over the last 50 years, while China is known
for its enforced one-child policy.
It is economically beneficial for individual
countries to control their population growth, but
the action, according to Stanford researchers, has
positive consequences for the entire planet.
According to conservation biologist Ciretchen
Daily, a former Stanford Biological Sciences
major, human activity is on its way to degrading
50-percent of the land surface. She criticizes
industrialized nations for overuse and waste of
natural resources and exerting "twice the impact
on the planet's life support" than poorer areas.
Yet. as the IJNFP reports, population growth
in the United States. Western Europe and Japan
is at a standstill. Unlike many developing coun
tries. these industrialized countries can success
fully support their current populations.
Paul Ehrlich. Bing Professor of Population
Studies, claims also that the countries considered
to comprise the Third World are rapidly advanc
ing in technology, with access to the Internet and
television.
With a window into rich countries, their citi
zens develop the desire to adopt the American
consumer lifestyle. The result could be pressure
on governments to tap into precious nonrenew
able natural resources for short-term economic
gains.

Although environmental damage and food
scarcity are sound reasons to control population,
the curbing of births is easier said than done.
It is extremely difficult to mandate birth con
trol without appearing undemocratic. Access to
education and contraceptives are frequent barri
ers to intervention in isolated villages. Long
standing cultural traditions, such as the correla
tion of family size to wealth, are difficult to dis
solve as well.
Another concern is the role of women in the
issue. A paradox exists with women in the center;
population control is often touted as a way to
advance women's rights by freeing them of some
familial duties, but birth-control programs tend
to implicate women as the holders of ultimate
responsibility.
Some, like China's policy, encourage sex pref
erence in society and even female infanticide, by
giving couples only tine chance to produce their
means of support in old age.
The implicit notion of reproductive rights
within women's rights and the disregard of both
have angered feminist groups in developing
countries and added more conflict to the situa
tion.
When asked what the earth can reasonably
sustain in the long term. Daily said "Of course,
there's no simple answer to this question—it all
depends on how we want to live and on the inge
nuity we apply to reducing the environmental
impact of our lifestyle."
She added, "If we want everyone to be able to
live the way the average American does today,
then we'd need about two additional Earths to
support the global population of 6 billion sustain
ably."
Thus, Adrian's birth is a bittersweet event
heralded not only by Annan and CNN cameras,
but by the ever-ticking Population Clock at the
United Nations Headquarters in Geneva.
