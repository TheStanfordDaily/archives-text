# Discovering the art of formation flying

Formation flying, a new frontier
in aerospace navigation made pos
sible by the Global Positioning Sys
tem (CiPS). has become a revolu
tionary technique in aerospace
engineering.
Formation flying in space entails
enabling a fleet of spacecraft to
maneuver themselves, keeping con
stant the relative position of each
satellite with respect to others, to
ensure that the fleet is navigating in
formation.
The National Aeronautics and
Space Administration hopes that
this technique will allow scientists
to combine the measurements from
several spacecrafts to create tele
scopes and sensors of unparalleled
size and power and most impor
tantly. at an affordable price.
A pioneer in formation flying
research. Professor of Aerospace
Engineering Jonathan How has
made significant progress in model
ing formation flying and making
satellites of unprecedented si/e.
How conducts his research at
End Station 3. a large hangar sunk
half underground located across
from the Science and Engineering
Quad.
Once a terminal point in a linear
particle accelerator, the hangar,
roughly the size of an indoor track,
now becomes a test fly zone for for
mation living.
How's objective is to successful
ly apply the computer algorithms
that are tested through physical
modeling in the hangar to the satel
lites.
"Blimps are perfect for testing
the control problems in formation
flying," explains I low. who uses
two blimps, one green and one red.
with the red blimp mimicking the
movement of the green blimp to
simulate formation living.

Although the sight of two blimps
floating through the hangar may
appear ordinary, the blimps are
performing a complex task. What is
noteworthy about this simulated
formation flying is that the red
blimp is precisely following the
movement of the green blimp with
out human control.
"In space, precision becomes an
important issue as even a slight
variation in the satellite's move
ment can send it off the orbit." I low
comments.
In I low's lab. formation flying of
the blimps is made possible by a
mini-CiPS. (ilobally. CiPS can
locate the position of the receiver,
which picks up signals transmitted
by the satellites, within a few cen
timeters with the aid of the 24
NAVSTAR satellites that circle
20.200 kilometers above the 1 arth.
Since the NAVSI AR satellite

signal cannot be received indoors.
How's colleague have mounted
their own (il'S transmitters high up
on the hangar walls. The wooden
frame below each blimp contains a
(IPS receiver, a circuit board, bat
teries and motors that crank the
blimp's propellers.
Each blimp monitors the signal
from the (IPS transmitters and for
wards its position and altitude to a
central computer. I lie computer
monitors changes in the green
blimp's position, mathematically
determines how the red blimp
should move to maintain the
required formation and sends the
direction to the red blimp.
I lie data from the blimps is inte
gral to applying formation flying
into space. How and his students
are now working on a project to
build three satellites the si/e of milk
crates that will fly in formation

sometime in 2001.
The three satellites, each con
taining onboard CiPS transmitters,
receivers and nitrogen propellers,
are now undergoing the testing
stage.
Formation flying brings excite
ment to future astrophysical
research as well. NASA's next pro
ject called Space Technology 3
(Sl3). is due for launch in 2003.
ST3 will combine the images
Irom two small telescopes Hying in
formation to produce images with
resolution almost as good as those
of expensive giant telescopes such
as the Hubble telescope.
How's research shadows a new
era of space exploration that will
replace the cumbersome and costly
instrument with the smaller and
inexpensive yet equally powerful
spacecraft made possible by
autonomous formation flying.

These three fully autonomous nanosatellites designed in How's lab will be ready to launched in 2001.
