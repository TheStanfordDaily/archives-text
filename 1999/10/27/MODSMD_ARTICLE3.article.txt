The recent increase in alcohol
related incidents on college cam
puses hasn't left Stanford un-
touched.
Recently, Michael Riemen
schneider, a freshman in Eucalipto
was found unconscious in the Lagu

nita Court parking lot and taken to
Stanford Hospital.
Dean of Students Marc Wais said
that the injury was alcohol-related,
but that "the exact cause of the in
jury is unknown."
Residence Dean Lisa Webb de
clined to discuss the incident, "out
of respect for the family and the stu

dent involved."
Riemensehneider remains in
Stanford I iospital in fair and stable
condition, according to hospital
staff.
The recent incident is the third
severe alcohol-related injury in less
than a year on the Stanford campus.
In ()etober IWB, Phi Delta 1 heta se
nior Michael Howard fell from the
balcony of the house and was hospi
talized in intensive care for one
week. Asa result of that incident and
an alcohol-related light on their
IWB Rush weekend trip, the Phi
Delts lost their charter last spring.
During Admit Weekend in
April, for the first time ever, a
prospective freshman was taken to
the hospital for alcohol poisoning
and another was nursed hack to
consciousness after passing out in
the Rinconada lounge.
"I am very, very concerned,"
Wais said in April. "Stanford is not
insulated. Surveys that we have
done through Cowell show that al

cohol abuse at Stanford is clearly
below the national level, but it is still
a subject that we are very concerned
about."
I Jnivcrsity policy prohibits alco
hol consumption by minors. But
rather than use residence staff to en
force the policy, Stanford empha
sizes education, especially in resi
dences, to discourage irresponsible
drinking.
"It is important that students
don't see us as enforcers so that they
feel comfortable coming to us," said
Larkin Resident Fellow Steve Sted
man last year in response to the al
cohol-related incidents.
"If students view us as en
forcers." Stedman said, "there will
be no trust, no confidence and no
basis for RAs and RFs to be men
tors. The relationship with students
would become antagonistic and ad
versarial."
