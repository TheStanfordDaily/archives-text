## From the Cheap Seats Ben Jones Remembering Stewart 
### 
Over the past few weeks, my
columns have taken on a
markedly humorous tone. That
wasn't exactly hard work. I mean,
Texas high school football and the
fact that my roommate is four and a
half meters taller than I am are funny
in and of themselves.
I'm going to take a bit of a depar
ture from the sarcastic commentary
on the world of sports this week to
talk about a more serious, and fiir
more important subject: the death of
professional golfer Payne Stewart.

Yesterday's tragic plane crash
that claimed the lives of Stewart and
reportedly five others was a blow not
only to the world of golf but to the
sporting community as a whole. Fans
of the sport and non-fans alike in
stantly recognized Stewart for his
flamboyant dress — knickers and
colorful tam-o'shanter hats — and
his play won the envy of fellow pro
fessionals and amateurs.
This year Stewart punctuated a
comeback from a career mid-life cri
sis of sorts with a dramatic win at the
U.S. Open in June. Stewart clinched
his victory with a 15-foot putt on the
final hole of regulation to edge Phil
Mickelson by one stroke and secure
his second Open title.
Later in the year he helped lead
the U.S. Rvdcr Cup team to an un
precedented come-from-behind vic
tory over the European squad on the
last day of the event. I le won acco
lades not only for his play but also for
his strength of character.
He criticized the American
team's jubilant celebration after
Justin Leonard made what appeared
to be the cup-clinching putt on the
17th hole in his match against Jose
Maria Olazabal.aswell as the merci
less heckling that Scottish golfer
Colin Montgomerie endured from
the crowd during their match.
In a career that saw 18 wins world
wide and three major tournament
victories (the IIASyl l ASy PGA Champi

unship in addition to U.S. Open wins
in 1991 and 1999), Stewart was un
questionably known as one of the
stars of the PGA Tour.
Yet to hear his peers and friends
speak of him. he was far more than
just a great golfer. I le was a great per
son as well. P( iA Tour players in
cluding Mark O'Meara. Peter Jacob
sen and Ben Crenshaw all spoke last
night tin the talent and refreshing op
timism that Stewart brought to the
game of golf. His personality seemed
to match his style of dress — colorful,
upbeat and unexpected.
Stewart's death struck an espe
cially strong chord with me. Learning
to play golf at a young age in the few
spare moments I could find from soc
cer. basketball and baseball seasons,
1 can remember that Stewart was my
first "favorite" golfer. At that time he
wore his outfits coordinated with
NIL teams, and for an avid sports
fan, he was easy to identify with.
I can remember those hot sum
mer afternoons spent on the driving
range trying to emulate Stewart's
flowing, effortless swing — mine was
rarely flowing, and never effortless. I
followed Stewart's career through
out its ups and downs and was elated
to see him regain his championship
form at this year's Open.
I lis death reminds lis that profes
sional athletes are caught in a deli
cate conundrum. On one hand, ath
letes are heroes, if not to millions
than maybe just to one person, and in
many instances role models.
Yet on the other hand, profes
sional athletes are no different than
you or I. Stewart, like any person
who may die at a young age. leaves
behind a wife and two young chil
dren. For them, the major titles, the
millions of'dollars that Payne Stewart
won mean very little, if anything at
this point. They must learn to live
without a husband, without a father.
I think very often we forget that
athletes are realK no different from
you and I, save their exceptional tal
ents. In the professional ranks — and
to a much smaller degree here at
Stanford — it can sometimes be diffi
cult to see the faces behind the play
