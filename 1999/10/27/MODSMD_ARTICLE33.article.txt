# Making the decision of a lifetime
## Sarah Medeiros, back from two knee operations, anchors the Cardinal squad 
### Ashley Rich Contributing writer 
Sarah Medeiros, or "Sars" as she
is affectionately known to her field
hockey teammates and friends, was
faced with a serious decision two
years ago when a debilitating knee
injury left her sidelined from the
sport she loves.
Should she undergo surgery, take
a medical redshirt for her junior
year, and plan on returning for a fifth
year of play after all her classmates
have graduated? Or should she con
tinue trying to power through the
pain, hoping for improvement be
fore the end of the season?
Since day one. Medeiros has
proved to be an integral part of the
field hockey squad. As a part of a
large recruiting class of eight strong
players, she burst onto the Stanford
program with an energy and dedica
tion that earned her a starting spot as
a freshman. She made a name lor
herself as a tough player who never
gave up in the face of pain or adver
sity, and that year, she led the team's
scoring with six goals and live assists.
"She's always been a tenacious
player who leads by example and
plays with all her heart." said head
coach Sheryl Johnson. "She is a
dominant force on the field."
11 was her junior year when the
injuries started. After a summer trip
to Korea to play with the Junior
World Cup team. Medeiros re
lumed to Stanford lo begin the sea
son. but only a few games later, knee
pain sent her to the training room.
There was no sudden snap, no
painful fall that began the problem,
but despite how quietly it came, il
was here lo stick around for a while.
Doctors tried steroids to calm the
swelling, but the problem wasn't
fixed and so they recommended
surgery.
Now came the decision that
would affect her Stanford experi
ence forever. It wasn't one that
could be made easily. She consulted
friends, her parents, doctors, John
son. athletes who had rcdshirted and
others who had decided not to.
I veryone was helpful and support
ive. but ultimately left the decision
up to her.
"1 kind of wanted someone to
say. "you should do this,' but every
one knew that I had to decide for

myself. So I wanted whatever was
wrong to be fixed before 1 hurt it
[any] more."
October's surgery was supposed
to be simple, hut the six weeks of ex
pected rehabilitation came and
went, and it still wasn't getting bet
ter. After the season, she still wasn't
better and missed the national team
tryouts for which she had been se
lected the preceding summer.
After almost a year of pain and
difficulty, Medeiros managed to
bounce back to her spunky self in
time for preseason of what should
have been her stellar senior field
hockey season. Much to her frustra
tion. the third game into the season
her knee gave way again and left her
facing another four weeks of recov
ery and rehabilitation.
" The second injury was really
hard. I had been so excited to return
and play with my class for the last
time. 1 knew the injury was worse,
but had no redshirt opportunity. 1
was just impatient to get back, to feel
OK after worrying about it for so
long."
Returning to the field with a re
strictive knee brace. Medeiross
didn't feel quite back at 1(X) percent,
but teammates still saw the same
dedication that she had become
known for. She managed to still con
tribute much to the remainder of the
season.
"To the rest of us she still looked
like her fast, aggressive, determined
self on the field. Whenever she is in
the game, knee brace and injury or
not, she goes all out and always man
ages to make something happen out
there." said senior Lindsey Duna
gan.
Medeiros finished the remaining
10 games that season and traveled
with a Bay Area all-star team to
India to play over winter break. But
when the pain still wasn't improving,
she had to undergo another exten
sive surgery, staying completely off
her knee for six weeks.
Now a fifth-year senior, she's
back on the field and giving every
thing she has to the team. Unani
mously voted captain by her team
mates. it is obvious that Medeiros
has continued to be a leader on and
off the field. Always a friendly face
to turn to, for Medeiros, this position
comes naturally — although, with
her characteristic modesty, she sites

the team dynamics as aiding her in
her role.
"The team gets along so well,
and I think we all are equal leaders
on and off the field. We have a
young team this year, but everyone
looks out for each other.
Medeiros's role as a team leader
can be exemplified in her shift in po
sition on the field as well. Formerly a
forward shooter, she now plays mid
field — the link between the for
wards and the defense. When suc
cess in a game used to be measured
in goals and assists, it is now based
on successfully orchestrating team
communication through the transi
tion of the game.
"It requires a different mentality,
and that's a challenge," Medeiros
said.
Hut according to Johnson, she
plays the position well.

"Sars is the impact player who
dominates the transition game —
she is a constant threat on attack, a
great play-maker, as well as a solid
defender."
Mcdeiros's all-out style of play
hasn't changed much despite the
shift in position. With an extensive
defensive reach, she rarely lets the
hall get past her and she can turn the
pace of the game around with one
quick steal of the hall from an unsus
pecting opponent.
A lot can change in five years,
and things certainly have with the
field hockey program. During
Medeiros's freshman year, there
was no mandatory strength training,
in) practice uniforms and hardly any
press. With the momentum that was
initiated bv her recruiting class, in

Fifth-year senior Sarah Medeiros has returned from two knee surg
eries to add valuable experience and leadership to the Cardinal
field hockey squad this season.
tensity took off and the team has
maintained a solid winning record
while playing tougher teams ever
since.
"It's almost a different program
now," Medeiros savs. "We played on
grass up to last year. Now we have a
world-class Astro Turf field, and the
funds to bring very talented players
out here. The team has grown into a
group of very committed players."
livery year brings different dy
namics to the team, but this year's
mix of young and returning players
brings a fresh aura of determination.
"This year's incoming class re
minds me of mine. They're enthusi
astic, hard workers and very close."
One might think that after so
many years of her life committed to
playing top-level field hockey.
Medeiros would be ready for a
change of pace. I lowever. even now

she is not eager for it to end.
"I love the team, and have en
countered a lot of talent and fun per
sonalities. I'm definitely going to
miss it."
A solid relationship with John
son, a former Olympian and long
time member of the national team,
has been a key factor in this positive
experience.
"I was in awe as a freshman, but
she was always helpful to talk to. I've
learned so much from her and really
respect her," Medeiros said. "She's
helped me as a player, as a captain
and through my injuries by being
completely supportive."
With her classmates and room
mates graduated. Medeiros has in a
sense found herself between two
worlds.
"It's a nice transition year for me.
Most of my friends are working, so I
get to observe that side of life while
still in college."
Medeiros has used her extra time
to try a variety of classes and to fig

ure out exactly what she wants to do
when graduation comes around. A
Psychology major, she is almost
done with all her pre-medical re
quirements and w ill have a little time
to sit back and think about where
she wants to go from here.
Current considerations include
pediatrics or sports medicine and her
personal experience has added a dif
ferent perspective — exploring the
psychological side to injuries.
"It's an area that hasn't been ex
plored all that much — the emotion
al effects, long-term results. Not
many people understand some of the
problems and feelings associated
with injury, which can last longer
than expected"
She certainly has enough first
hand experience to contribute as
data for this research question. But
for Medeiros, who has cruised
through this academic quarter with
enthusiastic success and this hockey
season with poise and courage, the
diagnosis looks good.

on and off the field. We have a
young team this year, but everyone
looks out for each other.
Medeiros's role as a team leader
can be exemplified in her shift in po
sition on the field as well. Formerly a
forward shooter, she now plays mid
field — the link between the for
wards and the defense. When suc
cess in a game used to be measured
in goals and assists, it is now based
on successfully orchestrating team
communication through the transi
tion of the game.
"It requires a different mentality,
and that's a challenge," Medeiros
said.
Hut according to Johnson, she
plays the position well.

"Sars is the impact player who
dominates the transition game —
she is a constant threat on attack, a
great play-maker, as well as a solid
defender."
Mcdeiros's all-out style of play
hasn't changed much despite the
shift in position. With an extensive
defensive reach, she rarely lets the
hall get past her and she can turn the
pace of the game around with one
quick steal of the hall from an unsus
pecting opponent.
A lot can change in five years,
and things certainly have with the
field hockey program. During
Medeiros's freshman year, there
was no mandatory strength training,

Fifth-year senior Sarah Medeiros has returned from two knee surg
eries to add valuable experience and leadership to the Cardinal
field hockey squad this season.
tensity took off and the team has
maintained a solid winning record
while playing tougher teams ever
since.
"It's almost a different program
now," Medeiros savs. "We played on
grass up to last year. Now we have a
world-class Astro Turf field, and the
funds to bring very talented players
out here. The team has grown into a
group of very committed players."
livery year brings different dy
namics to the team, but this year's
mix of young and returning players
brings a fresh aura of determination.
"This year's incoming class re
minds me of mine. They're enthusi
astic, hard workers and very close."
One might think that after so
many years of her life committed to
playing top-level field hockey.
Medeiros would be ready for a
change of pace. I lowever. even now

she is not eager for it to end.
"I love the team, and have en
countered a lot of talent and fun per
sonalities. I'm definitely going to
miss it."
A solid relationship with John
son, a former Olympian and long
time member of the national team,
has been a key factor in this positive
experience.
"I was in awe as a freshman, but
she was always helpful to talk to. I've
learned so much from her and really
respect her," Medeiros said. "She's
helped me as a player, as a captain
and through my injuries by being
completely supportive."
With her classmates and room
mates graduated. Medeiros has in a
sense found herself between two
worlds.
"It's a nice transition year for me.
Most of my friends are working, so I
get to observe that side of life while
still in college."
Medeiros has used her extra time
to try a variety of classes and to fig

ure out exactly what she wants to do
when graduation comes around. A
Psychology major, she is almost
done with all her pre-medical re
quirements and w ill have a little time
to sit back and think about where
she wants to go from here.
Current considerations include
pediatrics or sports medicine and her
personal experience has added a dif
ferent perspective — exploring the
psychological side to injuries.
"It's an area that hasn't been ex
plored all that much — the emotion
al effects, long-term results. Not
many people understand some of the
problems and feelings associated
with injury, which can last longer
than expected"
She certainly has enough first
hand experience to contribute as
data for this research question. But
for Medeiros, who has cruised
through this academic quarter with
enthusiastic success and this hockey
season with poise and courage, the
diagnosis looks good.
Sarah Medeiros, or "Sars" as she
is affectionately known to her field
hockey teammates and friends, was
faced with a serious decision two
years ago when a debilitating knee
injury left her sidelined from the
sport she loves.
Should she undergo surgery, take
a medical redshirt for her junior
year, and plan on returning for a fifth
year of play after all her classmates
have graduated? Or should she con
tinue trying to power through the
pain, hoping for improvement be
fore the end of the season?
Since day one. Medeiros has
proved to be an integral part of the
field hockey squad. As a part of a
large recruiting class of eight strong
players, she burst onto the Stanford
program with an energy and dedica
tion that earned her a starting spot as
a freshman. She made a name lor
herself as a tough player who never
gave up in the face of pain or adver
sity, and that year, she led the team's
scoring with six goals and live assists.
"She's always been a tenacious
player who leads by example and
plays with all her heart." said head
coach Sheryl Johnson. "She is a
dominant force on the field."
11 was her junior year when the
injuries started. After a summer trip
to Korea to play with the Junior
World Cup team. Medeiros re
lumed to Stanford lo begin the sea
son. but only a few games later, knee
pain sent her to the training room.
There was no sudden snap, no
painful fall that began the problem,
but despite how quietly it came, il
was here lo stick around for a while.
Doctors tried steroids to calm the
swelling, but the problem wasn't
fixed and so they recommended
surgery.
Now came the decision that
would affect her Stanford experi
ence forever. It wasn't one that
could be made easily. She consulted
friends, her parents, doctors, John
son. athletes who had rcdshirted and
others who had decided not to.
I veryone was helpful and support
ive. but ultimately left the decision
up to her.
"1 kind of wanted someone to
say. "you should do this,' but every
one knew that I had to decide for

myself. So I wanted whatever was
wrong to be fixed before 1 hurt it
[any] more."
October's surgery was supposed
to be simple, hut the six weeks of ex
pected rehabilitation came and
went, and it still wasn't getting bet
ter. After the season, she still wasn't
better and missed the national team
tryouts for which she had been se
lected the preceding summer.
After almost a year of pain and
difficulty, Medeiros managed to
bounce back to her spunky self in
time for preseason of what should
have been her stellar senior field
hockey season. Much to her frustra
tion. the third game into the season
her knee gave way again and left her
facing another four weeks of recov
ery and rehabilitation.
" The second injury was really
hard. I had been so excited to return
and play with my class for the last
time. 1 knew the injury was worse,
but had no redshirt opportunity. 1
was just impatient to get back, to feel
OK after worrying about it for so
long."
Returning to the field with a re
strictive knee brace. Medeiross
didn't feel quite back at 1(X) percent,
but teammates still saw the same
dedication that she had become
known for. She managed to still con
tribute much to the remainder of the
season.
"To the rest of us she still looked
like her fast, aggressive, determined
self on the field. Whenever she is in
the game, knee brace and injury or
not, she goes all out and always man
ages to make something happen out
there." said senior Lindsey Duna
gan.
Medeiros finished the remaining
10 games that season and traveled
with a Bay Area all-star team to
India to play over winter break. But
when the pain still wasn't improving,
she had to undergo another exten
sive surgery, staying completely off
her knee for six weeks.
Now a fifth-year senior, she's
back on the field and giving every
thing she has to the team. Unani
mously voted captain by her team
mates. it is obvious that Medeiros
has continued to be a leader on and
off the field. Always a friendly face
to turn to, for Medeiros, this position
comes naturally — although, with
her characteristic modesty, she sites

the team dynamics as aiding her in
her role.
"The team gets along so well,
and I think we all are equal leaders
on and off the field. We have a
young team this year, but everyone
looks out for each other.
Medeiros's role as a team leader
can be exemplified in her shift in po
