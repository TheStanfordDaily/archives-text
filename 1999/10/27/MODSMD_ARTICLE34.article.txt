# Rugby tackles season-opening tourney

### Jonathan Cohen 
The story may sound familiar. A
Stanford men's team makes a run
all the way to the national Final
Four in 1998. The next year, they
are shockingly upset in regionals.

Despite losing some key seniors,
they return a strong core of players,
and appear ready to make another
run at the national title. The sport,
however, is not basketball, but
rugby.
The last time the Stanford men's

rugby team took the field, Oregon
State handed the Cardinal a heart
breaking overtime loss to knock
Stanford out of the Pacific Coast
Playoffs and prematurely end its
season.
Coming off back-to-back Final

Four appearances, including a sec
ond-place finish nationally in 1997-
ytf, the team's failure to reach the
Sweet Sixteen was especially ago
nizing for last year's upperclass
men.
But while those seniors, led by
All-Amcrican captain Steve Pre
onas, are now gone, 12 starters
have returned, eager to bring Stan
ford back to the top echelon of col
lege rugby.
The long road to another cham
pionship berth begins Saturday
when Fresno State, Pacific and an
assortment of other area schools
come to Stanford for an eight- team
exhibition tournament.
The games this weekend will be
seven-on-seven, as opposed to the
standard 15 players to a side, in
order to emphasize the finesse as
pects of the sport and to allow
everyone to get some game experi
ence.
Leading the way for the Cardi
nal will be senior captain Fli
Frankel. Frankel, along with fellow
seniors Mike Ceballos, Jackson
Wagener and Borut Grgic. and ju
niors Jesse Cuevas and John
Shenk, will form the core of this
year's team.
"Last year was definitely a re
building year," said Frankel, "we
had a very young team."
But now. youth has turned into
experience.
And this solid returning nucle
us, along with what Frankel called
a "solid group of freshman that
could have an impact," should

weekend.
bring the Cardinal back to the lofty
position it occupied only two years
ago.
Ceballos, as well, is encouraged
by what he has seen in some new
comers.
"Our rookie class, which is the
freshman and ex-varsity athletes
who are now playing rugby, is look
ing good," he said.
Relying on first-year players can
be tricky, however, because most
collegiate rugby players — Cebal
los and I rankcl included — were
never exposed to the sport in high
school. That means that freshman
must learn the rules as they go
along, making the adjustment to
college athletics even more diffi
cult.
I rankcl. Ceballos and several
other seniors led fall practice lor
the first few weeks this year as the

team awaited the arrival of coach
Franck Boivert.
Boivert, Stanford's coach since
19K9, has been in Fiji since the
school year began, but as of Satur
day he was back in Palo Alto and
on Monday was leading practices
once again.
In addition to this weekend's
games, the Cardinal has an array of
other exhibition matches sched
uled before the real season starts
winter quarter.
In two weeks, the Cardinal will
host a l()-on-10 tournament, and
on the Sunday following Big
Ciame, it will have its annual alum
ni match.
The biggest test, however, will
take place on Nov. 16 when Stan
ford matches up with Australia's
Sydney University. Since rugby's
popularity is far greater in Aus
tralia than in America, Sydney's
players should have quite an edge
in experience, meaning Stanford
will really have to be at the top of

its game to compete.
Once the season starts, the Car
dinal will be battling California.
UC-Davis, St. Mary's, Chico State
and Humboldt State for the cham
pionship of the Pacific Coast
League. As always, the biggest ob
stacle for Stanford will be Cal,
which has won the last nine nation
al championships.
While the players believe they
can beat their rivals from Berkeley
this year, they know it's not going
to be easy.
"They have some great players
coming back," Frankel said, "and
they have arguably the best colle
giate player in the country in Kirk
Khasigian. If we can contain him.
we've got a shot."
There is still a lot of time before
that match, however, and the play
ers will not allow themselves to
look too far ahead.
"I expect us to prepare for each
game to the best of our abilities,"
Ceballos said. "And to win."
