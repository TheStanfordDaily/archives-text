Silicon Valley businessman and
former Stanford Computer Science
Professor Jim Clark is giving Stan
ford $150 million, the largest single
donation to the University since its
founding. ITie donation funds the
new interdisciplinary Program in
Biomedical Engineering and Sci
ences, also known as Bio-X.
Funding for Bio-X
Clark's gift provides a huge finan
cial boost to a program which is still
in its infancy.
"Bio-X was a grass-roots effort
that came from the faculty. This ef
fort started literally only a little more
than a year ago," said Biochemistry
Prof. Jim Spudich, who heads the
Bio-X steering committee.
Bio-X seeks to incorporate re
search on biology and medicine with
other efforts in the fields of engineer
ing, chemistry and physics. Provost
John Hennessy says the program
builds on the "notion of biology be
coming this foundational science for

lots of different disciplines" in the
near future.
The $150 million will fund the cre
ation of new, endowed professor
ships in the departments involved in
Bio-X and the construction of a large
new center to house the program, to
be named the James H. Clark Center
for Biomedical Engineering and Sci
ences.
The new center
The building will be located on
what is now a parking lot southeast of
the Fairchild Center of the Medical
School and near the Gates Comput
er Science Building. Spudich says the
building will form a strategic physical
and symbolic link between the Med
ical School and the Science and Engi
neering Quad.
Spudich said that the location
seemed tailor-made for the new cen
ter. "We needed to have this new
center to serve as a hub for these de
partments. and they're all in a big cir
cle, with an empty spot in the mid
dle." he said.
