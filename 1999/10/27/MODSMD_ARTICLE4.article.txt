# Bio-X program to endow professorships, build center
## 
### T.J. Babbitt Editorial staff 
Silicon Valley businessman and
former Stanford Computer Science
Professor Jim Clark is giving Stan
ford $150 million, the largest single
donation to the University since its
founding. ITie donation funds the
new interdisciplinary Program in
Biomedical Engineering and Sci
ences, also known as Bio-X.
Funding for Bio-X
Clark's gift provides a huge finan
cial boost to a program which is still
in its infancy.
"Bio-X was a grass-roots effort
that came from the faculty. This ef
fort started literally only a little more
than a year ago," said Biochemistry
Prof. Jim Spudich, who heads the
Bio-X steering committee.
Bio-X seeks to incorporate re
search on biology and medicine with
other efforts in the fields of engineer
ing, chemistry and physics. Provost
John Hennessy says the program
builds on the "notion of biology be
coming this foundational science for

lots of different disciplines" in the
near future.
The $150 million will fund the cre
ation of new, endowed professor
ships in the departments involved in
Bio-X and the construction of a large
new center to house the program, to
be named the James H. Clark Center
for Biomedical Engineering and Sci
ences.
The new center
The building will be located on
what is now a parking lot southeast of
the Fairchild Center of the Medical
School and near the Gates Comput
er Science Building. Spudich says the
building will form a strategic physical
and symbolic link between the Med
ical School and the Science and Engi
neering Quad.
Spudich said that the location
seemed tailor-made for the new cen
ter. "We needed to have this new
center to serve as a hub for these de
partments. and they're all in a big cir
cle, with an empty spot in the mid
dle." he said.
Approximately 50 faculty mem
bers and 4(H) scientists and techni
cians will work ai the facility, with
about 30 percent of the faculty mem
bers newly recruited from outside of
Stanford. It is hoped that more than
200 other faculty members from the
Schools of I lumanities and Sciences,
Medicine and Engineering will par
ticipate in teaching and research at
the Center.
Clark's reasons
Clark, a towering figure in the Sil
icon Valley who founded Silicon
Graphics. Netscape. Healtheon and
mvCFO. was ;i professor at Stanford
in the early 19N0sand had been in dis
cussions with Stanford about being a
benefactor since 19%.
"I chose to do this because of my
academic roots, and Stanford is a
great place to do it.l or me. it's im
portant to know that a gift is going to
get the best leverage it possibly can."
(lark said in a press release.
UCSPs new lul>
Neither llennessy nor Spudich
felt thiil the Bio-X initiative or the
Clark Center were directly compa
rable to the new UCSI campus in

Mission Bay in San Francisco,
which broke ground yesterday. A
new $222-million biological science
laboratory is being built and is the
first building of a new 43-acre cam
pus dedicated to biological re
search.
"I'm very excited about what's
happening at Mission Bay," said Spu
dich. "But in a way, what they're
doing is separating the clinical faculty
from the basic science faculty," he
said, which is the opposite of the Bio-

X plans for more synergy between
schools and departments.
Groundbreaking for the Clark
Center is currently scheduled for
June 20(H). though the final form of
the building is not yet certain.
The Center falls under the Uni
versity's current General Use Per
mit and is not affected by current
discussion of Stanford's new Land
Use Plan. Construction is sched
uled to last through the summer of
2002.

For $150 million you can:
■ buy a Big Mac, fries, and a Coke for everyone in South Africa
■ pay full 1999-2(KX) tuition for every member of the freshman, sopho
more, and junior cla^s
■ purchase every ticket for every home game the 49ers will play at 3Com
Park during the next 4 seasons
■ endow chairs for 37 Stanford faculty members
■ buy 12 months of health insurance for 250,(XK) Americans
■ run for the United States Senate from the State of California 11 times
■ add 2.25 million volumes to the collection of the Stanford University Li
brary system
■ buy twice the weight in gold of the Stanford football team
■ purchase a 1999 Mercedes SL 500 for every member of the Stanford fac
ulty
