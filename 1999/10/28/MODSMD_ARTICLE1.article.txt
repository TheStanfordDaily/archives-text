The Stanford University Post-
Docs' Political Action Committee
has published the results of a sur
vey of postdoctoral fellows, reveal
ing postdocs' dissatisfaction with
their treatment at Stanford.
SUPD sponsors events to give
Stanford postdoctoral students a
chance to interact in a social set
ting. The Political Action Commit
tee (PAC) is a subgroup of SUPD
that works toward improving the
professional lives of postdoctoral
students at Stanford.
In August, the SUPD-PAC
sponsored a town hall meeting at
which students were given the op
portunity to voice concerns about
salaries, their student status and
the lack of clear conflict resolution
procedures.
SUPD-PAC distributed a sur
vey at the meeting and has since
analyzed the results.
More than 140 students com

pleted the survey, which represents
12 percent of the approximately
1.200 postdoctoral students at
Stanford.
The survey inquired about vari
ous postdoctoral concerns, includ
ing salary, the percent of income
spent on rent and relationships be
tween students and their advisors.
Monica Torres, a postdoctoral
student at the Medical Center and
a member of SUPD-PAC, said she
felt that one of the survey's most
significant findings was "that out
general impressions about the
salaries being low and the dissatis
faction being high with Stanford's
treatment of postdocs' issues were
validated abundantly by the sur
vey."
According to the survey, 24 per
cent of Stanford's postdoctoral stu
dents were being paid below the of
ficial Stanford minimum level as of
Sept. 1. Sixty-four percent of those
surveyed were "less than satisfied"
