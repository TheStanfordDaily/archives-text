# Survey reveals dissatisfaction
## Salaries, benefits top list of postdoc woes 
### Gargi Talukder Contributing writer 
The Stanford University Post-
Docs' Political Action Committee
has published the results of a sur
vey of postdoctoral fellows, reveal
ing postdocs' dissatisfaction with
their treatment at Stanford.
SUPD sponsors events to give
Stanford postdoctoral students a
chance to interact in a social set
ting. The Political Action Commit
tee (PAC) is a subgroup of SUPD
that works toward improving the
professional lives of postdoctoral
students at Stanford.
In August, the SUPD-PAC
sponsored a town hall meeting at
which students were given the op
portunity to voice concerns about
salaries, their student status and
the lack of clear conflict resolution
procedures.
SUPD-PAC distributed a sur
vey at the meeting and has since
analyzed the results.
More than 140 students com

pleted the survey, which represents
12 percent of the approximately
1.200 postdoctoral students at
Stanford.
The survey inquired about vari
ous postdoctoral concerns, includ
ing salary, the percent of income
spent on rent and relationships be
tween students and their advisors.
Monica Torres, a postdoctoral
student at the Medical Center and
a member of SUPD-PAC, said she
felt that one of the survey's most
significant findings was "that out
general impressions about the
salaries being low and the dissatis
faction being high with Stanford's
treatment of postdocs' issues were
validated abundantly by the sur
vey."
According to the survey, 24 per
cent of Stanford's postdoctoral stu
dents were being paid below the of
ficial Stanford minimum level as of
Sept. 1. Sixty-four percent of those
surveyed were "less than satisfied"
with their benefits package, which
is usually a minimal package due to
the postdoctoral' official status as
students. Eighty to 90 percent lack
dental, vision and life insurance.
Although the average starting
age of postdoctoral students is 30,

retirement plans are usually not of
fered. Paying for an extended in
surance or retirement plan can be a
struggle for many students.
In addition to concerns over
salary, respondents expressed dis
satisfaction over the lack of clear
procedures for conflict resolution.
Although only 13 percent reported
a serious conflict with a faculty
mentor, 96 percent felt Stanford

does not provide adequate re
sources for resolving disputes in
volving postdoctoral students.
SUPD-PAC is lobbying admin
istrators to support improvements
in postdoctoral salaries, benefits
and student status, and is beginning
to see some changes.
"The administration's response
to the survey and the town hall
meeting has primarily been more

accessibility," Torres commented.
Michael Cowan, associate dean
of graduate affairs, said. "I think we
|the administration] were accessi
ble before, but the postdocs may
not have known that we were ac
cessible. I have always been avail
able for the postdocs.... We have
a great working relationship with
SUPD, and a lot of good things
have come out of this interaction."

Kent Grindstaff, a Medical Cen
ter postdoctoral student in SUPD
PAC, said he agreed with Cowan's
assessment.
"1 think that the town hall meet
ing and the survey has served to
make the administration pay more
attention to our concerns," he said.
SUPD-PAC plans to meet with
Provost John Hennessy by the end
of the year to present a proposal

outlining its recommendations for
improving status and benefits.
Cowan and Tom Wasow, associ
ate dean of graduate policy, are
working with SUPD-PAC to gath
er information for the proposal.
Postdoctoral students can now
make academic complaints, which
ensures that their concerns will re
ceive attention through current
academic grievance procedures
