### 
Law prof. Tom Campbell
must choose between
\r
and politics

- A T A PRESS conference
/ \ held in the nation's capital
-JL JLon Tuesday, Law Prof. Tom
Campbell, a Republican Congress
man from California's 15th district,
announced his intention to run for
ahe U.S. Senate in 2(HM).
His decision to do so places his
'tenured status at Stanford in peril.
to The San Francisco
jChronicle, Law School Dean Kath
leen Sullivan has told Campbell that
'-he must either return to Stanford full
'time or lose his tenured status. The
Chronicle also reported that Camp
bell has been promised that he can
return to his position at the Law
School if his campaign is unsuccess
ful.
Campbell has ,held public office
since 1989, when he was first elected
-to the House. He served a term in
the State Senate beginning in 1993,
and then returned to Congress in
1995.
Up until now, Campbell has man
aged to hold onto his Stanford affili
ation throughout his political career.
He began teaching antitrust law at
the University in 1983 and received
tenure in 1987. He currently teaches
a Constitutional Law seminar to
undergraduates at the Stanford in
Washington program, which is held
weekly at 7:30 a.m.
Campbell maintains that he has
taught at least one class every year
since he began teaching in 1983 and
that he hopes to remain a teacher at
Stanford no matter what his future
holds.

These hopes are reminiscent of
the person who wants to have his
cake and eat it too. Campbell must
decide if an academic or a political
career is more important to him.
During his press conference, he
said that being a good enough sena
tor isn't good enough, and that he
hopes to be the best. Being the best
at anything, however, requires com
plete dedication, something that
Campbell would not be able to give
to both the U.S. Senate and Stanford
at the same time.
As such, should Campbell manage
to beat Democratic incumbent Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, he should relin
quish his tenured status at Stanford.
Being granted tenure here is both
a privilege and a responsibility.
When Campbell received tenure in
he received a guaranteed life
long teaching position from the Uni
versity provided that he continue to
fulfill the duties that such a position
entailed. It seems irresponsible that
he is now seeking another full-time
position.
Doing so will hinder him from ful
filling the job the University granted
him tenure to do: dedicate himself to
teaching and the other related
responsibilities of a tenured Stanford
professor. He is fortunate that the
University has allowed him to follow
dual career paths thus far.
If Campbell tried to both teach
and perform the duties of a Senator,
both his constituents and students
would suffer from his divided atten
tion.
His tenured position should be
passed on to a successor who is will
ing to fully devote either his or her
attention and abilities to teaching
Stanford students.
