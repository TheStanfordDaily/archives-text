# Meaning in the macro
## My summer as the office geisha 
### 
4 O IT SOUNDS
you were
their Geisha."
Sharp and poignant, this
comment brought a new
transparency to the mean
ing of my abroad experi
ence in Japan. Suddenly I.

the little white Jewish girl who seemed to lit
in so well with her Japanese co-workers dur
ing a summer in Nagano, had to reassess my
role in the company as (at least partially) a
form of after-hours entertainment and levity.
A geisha.
It occurred to me to wonder why no com
pany women were ever invited to thescafter
hours festivities when the salarymen would
lose their inhibitions faster than their sobri
ety. Nomikai parties are standard fare in
after-work Japanese culture, but these
events are conspicuously male-attended.
With ignorance and passivity, I passed off my
inclusion and elevated status as a testament
to my delightful personality and irresistible
charm.
Looking at it from a different angle, how
ever, it seems only natural that I was the tem
porary geisha, used much like the dying
breed of women entertainers from a long
Japanese tradition emphasizing arts, perfor
mance and flirtatious conversation fora
wealthy clientele. 1 was there for the jokes,
for the cultural nuance I brought, and for my
willingness to sing karaoke duets for hours
on end. Above all. I was their personal per
former.
While 'my spotlight-starved character
hardly minded filling the role of the after
hours "act," I gradually came to realize the
disparity in standard cultural norms. I
laughed off the jokes about my body, the
immature and ignorant sexual harassment
and the entreaties to join co-workers at "love
hotels" because I felt privileged with the spe
cial "male" status of being able to drink with
co-workers (and surpass them in many

eases).
But I was not male. I was not Japanese,
and the fallacy of my instant inclusion tricked
me into thinking I was an anomaly in being
"accepted."
So much of my Japan experience fol
lowed the same trend of blurry perspective.
So much of what I thought to be natural and
absolute became fundamentally subverted. I
recognized a natural susceptibility to mea
suring everything I observed against the
American, or "correct" standard. My inter
pretation of relationships and marriage fits
into that category.
Our society places so much weight on
love, romance, passion: focusing your life
around personal fulfillment and happiness.
It's even written into the Declaration of
Independence: we are entitled to the funda
mental right of "liberty and the pursuit of
happiness." We know enough to expect
romance to evolve into companionship and
marriage.
My co-Workers informed me that
Japanese people know nothing about love,
that they think of it only as a trend, a fashion.
The goal in marriage is to continue the fami
ly and create a home. As such, practicality
very effectively dictates gender roles. Hus
bands slave all day to earn the cash: wives
keep the house, cook the meals and raise the
kids in the meantime.
It's simple. Practical. It's why the
Japanese tell us that the divorce rate in
America is so high. We place too much
emphasis on the ephemeral. Passion is fleet
ing and is no solid foundation fora marriage.
The same edicts for this society offer a
picture of a nation that is not so preoccupied
with gender equality and "progress" by our
terms. As such, we marvel at the gender
imbalance in the workforce, the fact that
there are conspicuously few career opportu
nities for the modern Japanese woman.
Before spending time in Japan, I would
have said I he nation has a long way to go, a

Sasha Polonsky

long journey toward gender equity, and
change has to happen soon. 1 now see I was
naive and short-sighted to measure a social
circumstance based simply on personally
biased cultural norms. Although 1 have
always lauded myself for my open-minded
ness. 1 suddenly was ashamed of my inability
to see beyond the American perspective.
I saw couples who were not affectionate,
and I assumed their marriage was Hawed. I
watched school children making pained
efforts to stay awake on the afternoon train,
and I was sad to think about how they are so
overworked. 1 bowed silently as office ladies
served me coffee at a meeting and wondered
how they could bear putting up with such
degrading tasks. After a while. 1 realized the
Haw was with me, not with the people I
observed. The flaw was in my perspective.
Different does not necessarily mean wrong.
The couples who do not hug or touch in
public represent a different style of marriage
arrangement. The overworked school chil
dren who study so hard for university exams
and memorize every date from ancient histo
ry to current events simply take a different
path of education. And the office ladies in
the workforce have a different understand
ing of their roles. Very often, they remain
with the company only long enough to find a
husband and quit. These trends were differ
ent. strange to me. but not wrong.
Japan schooled me not only in the ancie'V,
arts of flower arrangement and tea ceremo
ny. but also urged me to appreciate how nat
ural inclinations can bias perspective.
of drawing comparisons to point out short
comings, we need to keep in mind that there
are many ways to interpret the world. In that
sense, my role as a geisha served me well.
