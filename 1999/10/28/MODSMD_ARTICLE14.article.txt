Defending The Yell Squad
We'd like to respond to Corey Griffin's
Wednesday column. "So You Want To Be
A Yell Leader," by defining a term we use
in the industry. One of the yell leaders
coined a phrase we like to use to describe
our job, and that's "love funnel."
We are catalysts, and we're coordinators.
What we do is take the enthusiasm of the
crowd, focus it. line it up. unify it, organize
it and funnel that stream of excitement
down to the field. And the wonderful thing
about the job is that if we do it right, the
enthusiasm comes right back to the fans —
it feeds on itself. We're there to make that
happen.
What we are not there to do is be in your
faces every second of the game. We're not
there to keep you entertained between
downs. In our ideal world, we would get the
fans yelling and screaming in unison at the
right times without them ever knowing we
were there.
ITiis is an amazing, amazing football sea
son for everyone involved — primarily the
team, but also the fans, the Band, the sup
port staff, everyone. And we want to apolo
gize for and acknowledge our own shortfalls
in a season where everyone needs to step it
up. We haven't had gtxnl new cheers in a
while. We've overused the old chestnuts.
Like anyone, we've been caught with our
pants around our ankles.
But we think Mr. Griffin has gone wrong
in his questioning of our drive and the very
nature of our student section, and we want
ed to respond to his two "Chapters" with
two points of our own.
First: The Witty Cheer.

We've got to respond to what we feel
from the crowd. What happened to "Tra
verse the field!" or the Fibonacci rah? I'hey
were not well received. More than once. By
more than one person. So we don't do 'em.
That's our right — when we think people
don't dig it, we're not going to force it on
them.
But this isn't arbitrary — there's a rea
son people don't like those, and there's a
reason we're not doing more of them. We
apologize for our failure in filling the void
left by the absence of "Punish them!" and
"Pursue them!"
We'd like to think, though, that the void
can be filled with something other than
clever little puns and big words.
Yes, we're Stanford students. But center
ing the spirit of our students around the big
words we know feels like a slap in the face
to the real excitement of the great fans out
there, the ones who are more interested in
showing off how pumped they are about the
team than how funny they can be, the ones
who are more interested in the plays on the
field than the guys on the sidelines in the
funny shirts.
This idea is the reason why we're starting
cheers like the one-time "Go Card!" — it's
short, it's punchy, and everyone, but every
one does it.
When we start "Traverse the field!" and
half the fans join in, our team — the reason
for us being there — hears garbled syllables
and blurry vowels and thinks: What the hell
are they yelling?
When the whole student section yells
"Go Card!" at once, our team hears "Go
Card!" And the other team thinks: Jeez, I'm
far, far away from home.

We want to rock out as much as anyone.
We want to capture the screw-you-whitc
sweater-embroidered-name-marching-
band-people spirit that the Band brings to
the student section more than anyone. But
wittyonly takes you so far.
Second: The Dull Moment.
The crucial point that we ask every spec
tator to realize is that we cannot do it all.
The yell leaders do not operate in a vacuum;
we're part of a very dynamic and very far
reaching spirit network which includes, and
must include, ourselves, the Band, the Dol
lies, the Tree, the Axe Committee, the ath
letic department and most crucially the fans
themselves. We as a squad will accept
responsibility for any flagging of energy,
any lulls of action, any failure of enthusiasm
— but we won't accept it all.
We aren't hypnotists, and we're not out
on the field making the stupendous plays. If
you can't get fired up — at least a little bit
— about the football team and show it, then
we can't make you. If you can't get fired up
about this football team, probably nothing
can get you that way.
Return to the "love funnel." We've all
been fans: we know we don't want someone
on a great big mike yelling in our cars every
second. When your average fan watches a
two-yard run from the 50 on first and 10,
they're probably not going to start bleeding
from the cars. We understand that it's very
easy to yell on big plays, and part of our job
is to maintain excitement between them. At
the same time, we can only work with what
we're given; we can only catalyze people
who want to make their voices heard. We
are not here to yell at you. We're here to
yell with you, and get you excited about

yelling when you should.
And yes, when the student section starts
a cheer spontaneously, we're going to cheer
with them — are we supposed to watch the
game in silence? This isn't an issue of "tak
ing credit" for something — there's no one
scoring us on how many cheers we lead ver
sus how many the section starts. The only
score that matters is up on the scoreboard.
The only credit that should be given is to the
team and all the fans.
To close: as Mr. Griffin points out, we're
a young, young institution, and there are
some growing pains to work through. We
encourage anyone and everyone who has an
idea fora cheer, a yell, an obscene gesture
(at the other team, mind you) to come talk
to one of us at the game or outside, in the
real world (you can contact me at jcoop
er@leland). We have a mission to support
Stanford athletics, and we love all the help
we can get — that's the nature of the job.
Tell us what you want to hear. In a season
like this one. it's time to get crazy together.

Implications of Clark's dona
tion should be considered
The donation of $150 million to Stanford
by Silicon Valley magnate Jim Clark is
mind-boggling. To give a sense of its magni
tude. it represents more than half the assets
of the 40,000-member-strong Stanford
Credit Union
The sheer power of the amount is
enough to set anybody's mind in firing
activity. For example, is Hennessy's swift
jump to the Stanford presidency already
secured? If he can bring in $150 million as a
first-year Provost, how much more could he
raise as Stanford's president, as young, pop
ular and well-networked in Silicon Valley as
he is?
But fora poor cousin in the humanities,
the question is "how will it affect my life and
research?" It won't. It has become a
monotony these days to see all big dona
tions feeding the ever-insatiable monster of
Science-cum-Technology (the "Bio-X" pro

ject in this case). Why not? Profit is notori
ously apolitical. No minority whining, agen
da conflict and factional misery here. Only
the brilliant smile of personal success and
Godless innovation. But let me escape
resentment and make a few common-sensi
cal points.
If cutting-edge scientific research gets
increasingly expensive, does this mean we
enter into a period of research monopoly?
For how else can you fund projects if not by
harnessing your research goals into a lucra
tive industry? You provide them with man
power and ideas, and they reward you with
beefy donations.
Not that simple anyway, but certainly
along the serpentine line of "mutual bene

fit." The protagonists may, in charming
democratic fashion, change, but the onset
of monopoly in strategic knowledge is
here.
It appears to be a historical necessity that
revolutions occur when least expected.
What are we supposed to think then about
a field / industry whose main product is
technological innovation? Has revolution
been at last tamed? I think gargantuan gifts
like Clark's and the media attention they
attract help us confuse the meaning of revo
lution.
Simply put, to make a car faster,
stronger, lighter, etc., is to innovate. To
bring a revolution, however, you need to
make the car obsolete, either by discovering

another way of traveling or by rendering
traveling unnecessary altogether.
Let's not forget that revolutions occur
inside human minds, when a whole way of
thinking, as the one currently demonstrated
by Stanford scientists and donors alike,
becomes obsolete. So, what happens if by
the time "Bio-X" reaches full swing it sud
denly collapses into "X-Bio"? For "cutting
edge" research can become truly "self-cut
ting" and have millions of dollars wasted
and careers emergency-landing. Beware of
human consciousness, dear colleagues in
the north side of campus, for I suspect this
will be the field of the next revolution. And
it may entail so modest research costs that
the lofty research towers of technology may

eventually be left unoccupied.
Here is one final thought: in a fit of putvi
lie-relations euphoria, the Stanford Repori
informs us that this is "the largest single girt
in Stanford's history since the founding
grant" [10/27]. Now we talk business! Is
how Stanford escaped the temptation of
being renamed "Silicon
Polytechnic" or even "SilTech"? If so, let's
put a price on the table, get rid of the old
family's name once and for all, and split the
amount of the highest bid equally across
campus. Fora just present weighs more
than a justifiable past. ,
