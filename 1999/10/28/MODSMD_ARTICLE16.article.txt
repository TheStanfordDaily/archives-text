# Reality in small doses
## Fuzzies need to take back some of the power 
### 
I WAS GOING to the theater with a
friend a couple of weeks ago, and we
did not know how to get there. So I
looked up the theater address on the
Yahoo Yellow Pages and then e-mailed
him the map.
" I his is great. I love this. Isn't technolo
gy wonderful?" he enthused on the way.
My dad writes me e-mails lauding com
puters tor saving his pocket from hefty
phone bills. "This sure beats paying $2
minute to talk to my daughters studying in
America,"he informs me gleefully.
Everywhere I turn, someone is praising
the glory of computers. Half of this campus
has already moved into Sweet Hall, and the
other half is trying to discover how a Histo
ry degree can translate into a job at a start
up.
I, however, think computers are overrat
ed.
Technologists claim that computers are
more timely and efficient. This may be true,
but we now spend so much time being time
ly and efficient by working on our computers

that we don't have time for anything else.
For example, I came to college happily
"computer illiterate." At first, 1 could not
even remember my e-mail address. Consid
ering that my e-mail address is my name,
Mariam, at stanford.edu, 1 think this ade
quately indicates how far removed I was
from the world of technological advances.
Soon, however, 1 was checking my e
mail once a day. Then twice a day. By the
end of freshman year I would wake up to
get water at 4 a.m. and check my mail on
the way. By the end of sophomore year, 1
would wake up at 4 a.m. just to check e
mail and bypass the water altogether.
E-mail became my study break, my
solace when I was down, my company
when I was lonely. I would even e-mail my
roommate when she was sitting in the same
room because a conversation took too
much effort. 1 was having a love affair with
my screen and a grand passion with my key
board.
Computers not only warp our allocation
of time, they also hold infinite humiliation

potential. I am still trying to live down an e
mail disaster that struck in the first few
months of my freshman year.
I had received an e-mail from a friend of
mine via a religious society's list. As she
was one of my best friends in high school, I
responded to her e-mail with some very off
color inside jokes. I even included a few
unflattering characterizations of some
mutual acquaintances.
My friend was used to receiving this type
of mail from me, and 1 knew she would find
it amusing. The only problem was that in
my technological innocence and purity, I
did not understand what the prompt
"respond to all recipients?" meant. Every
single member of the organization got my
e-mail.
We live in an age ruled by technocrats. I
personally am frightened to be a part of a
world in which Bill Gates reigns as king and
Stanford grads fight to be his heir.
I resent the fact that my Fuzzy Inferiori
ty Complex and fear of unemployment
compelled me to take CS 105 this quarter.

The truth is that the magical world of the
Internet is not all that magical. My CS
assignments make my head hurt, my eyes
sting and my spine curve. A misplaced dash
buried in five pages of HTML code brings
on a crying spree and Java Script makes me
suicidal.
Something is rotten in an atmosphere in
which being a Communications major is a
source of shame and ridicule.
My final complaint about the Internet is
that everyone praises it for making the
world smaller, while ignoring the fact that it
also creates new categories of "haves" and
"have nots."
Let us not conveniently ignore the fact
that global Internet access is divided along
racial and economic lines. According to
U.N. statistics, the average Internet user is
a 35-year-old, English-speaking male with a
college education and a high income.
Even among U.S. college students, 80
percent of students enrolled at private insti
tutions use the Internet regularly, while
only 40 percent of students in public uni-

Mariam Ali

versities do the same.
The United Nations further points out
that in America, computers cost an average
person one month's salary. For an average
person in Bangladesh, the same computet
would cost them eight year's income.
I am sure that the Silicon Valley diej
hards are gnashing their teeth in rage if
they have read this far. I can hear the per}
sistent hum of protest in Sweet Hall now, af
half the Stanford campus prepares to e-mail
me hate messages.
Well, 1 have a three-letter word for all
people who object to this column: Y2K!
"Revenge of the Nerds" may have been
an appropriate movie in the 1980s, but in
our present digital world, someone desperr
ately needs to produce "Revenge of th 4
Fuzzies."

week of school before her in-room connect
