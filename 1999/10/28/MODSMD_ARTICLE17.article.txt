# Cruisin' Through the SEO

To say that Stanford University is a center
for technological excellence and scientific
research is nothing new — one has only to re
call the numerous alumni who founded high
tech companies after leaving the Farm.
However, creative scientific minds are at
work even within the campus gates.
The recently completed Science and En
gineering Quad on the Near West Campus
promises to be a nexus for scientific minds.
The SEQ was christened last ITiursday as
hundreds of people joined University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper, Provost John Hen
nessy and electrical engineering Prof.
Stephen Boyd at Stone Pine Plaza to cele
brate the completion of the $120-million
quad.
With the new additions of the David
Packard Electrical Engineering Building,
the SEQ Teaching Center, the Sequoia Hall
statistics building and the renovated McCul
lough Annex, the Stanford science and engi
neering community is well-equipped for the
next centurv.

"The faculty and students requested to
have better communication with the rest of
campus, and if they had better facilities, they
could foster better communication, interac
tion and collaboration," said Judy Chan, as
sociate director of the University Architect
and Planning Office.
James Plummer, dean of the School of
Engineering, emphasized the functionality
of the new buildings.
"[The SEQ| provides modern facilities
for better teaching and research fora set of
departments that are very important for the
School of Engineering. [The facilities] en
able the departments to do better research
and therefore provide a better link with in
dustry," he said.
For example, the SEQ Teaching Center is
connected to the Stanford Instructional
Television Network and is equipped with ro
tating stages in the lecture halls.
The seed for the Near West Campus,
which includes the SEQ as well as the future
Bio-Chcm Quad, was sown in the mid-19M()s.
when faculty and staff started deliberating
on the future of Stanford's science and engi

neering facilities.
"Wc asked, 'What are the classrooms of
the future?' and 'What are the facilities of
the future?'" said Chan.
The need for more space and modern fa
cilities. coupled with a desire to make better
use of the space occupied hy old buildings,
was addressed in planning.
"It was at the opening of the Green Earth
Sciences building in IIWIl l WI when Gerhard
Casper was standing with Mr. |David|
Packard and Mr. Packard was looking out at
these one- and two-story buildings and
asked what the plans were for this area."
Chan said.
Soon after. Packard and his associate Bill
Hewlett donated $77 million toward the re
vitali/ation of the engineering quad, con
tributing the single largest gift in Stanford
history at the time.
The rest of the project's funding came
from other University funds, according to
Chan.
"(The new quad] lets interdisciplinary re
search occur because it places science and
engineering together. It goes great with the

Stanford tradition, in that the walls are per
meable." said Noe Lozano, associate dean of
student affairs for the School of Engineer
ing.
Max Kamenetsky, a doctoral student in
electrical engineering, agreed. "I think it
contributes positively to research. You need
to interact with people. You have to talk to
people about ideas."
In the new quad, both the electrical engi
neering and computer science departments
have their own buildings. Prior to the con
struction of the Packard Building and the
Bill Gates Information Science Building, the
two departments were spread out over sev
eral buildings.
Mark Chavira, a master's student in com
puter science, commented on the impor
tance of the Gates Building in particular.
"It represents the growing importance of
computer science, which has only recently
emerged as a discipline." he said.
All of the SEO buildings were designed in
the spirit of the Main Quad, but with several
notable differences. For example, they all
have the familiar red-tile roofs, but have

French limestone exterior walls, in contrast
to the sandstone walls seen in the Main
Quad.
"Ihere's a competency with the struc
tures in terms of scale and massing," said
( han. "But as you move away from the Main
Quad, you have more liberties to make the
buildings more functional," she said.
"From the outside. I like (the Main Quad
buildings] better. They look classic. I like
that," Chavira said.
Plummer had a different opinion. "I like
(the SEQ buildings] a lot," he said. "They
make a pretty spectacular statement about
Stanford."
Plummer noted the importance of the
outdoor areas, as well as the new cafe in the
Packard building, as places that will foster in
teraction among students in various depart
ments.
A lot of the really interesting research is
interdisciplinary. Having meeting places is
important. I hat's a really important part of
the new quad." said Plummer.
Its a magical opportunity for things to
happen," he added.
