## Best in the west? Runners head to Pac-10 meet 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
I here are two ways to look at Saturday's Pacific 10
Conference championship meet in Long Beach, Calif.
On one hand, it's one more practice, one final run
through at H.(KX) meters and one last tune up before the
real championship season starts.

MEW'S CROSS COUNTRY
■ Saturday: No. Stanford at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, Long Beach, Calif., 11 a.m.

Then there's the way that the No. 2 Stanford men look
at the race: it's the title meet for the best conference in the
nation, a chance to seize bragging rights for the next year
and an opportunity to extend a league win streak that
currently spans three years.
True, Stanford could finish last at Pac- l()s and still go
to the NCAA meet, and maybe even win it. And with No.
6 Arizona, No. 9 Arizona State and No. 12 Oregon all in
attendance, a win on Saturday is by no means a sure
thing.
But if the Cardinal continues to
perform as it has all season, the
chance to run away with the confer
ence title is within its grasp.
"The conference meet is an op
portunity to have your conference
bragging rights, and the Pac-1() has
one of the richest traditions in cross
country of any conference in the na
tion," said head coach Vin Lananna.
"We'd certainly like to be in a po
sition to win the meet — we've won
three in a row. and we'd like to see if
we can extend that streak," he said.
Long Beach's El Dorado Region
al Park will be the site of the confer
ence showdown, though both Ore
gon State and host USC will not field
men's teams.

This is only the second time in 26
years that the conference meet has
not been held at the Stanford golf
course. According to Lananna, no
real "home-course advantage" has
been lost, though.
"The best team wins. I don't think
it makes any difference what course
you run,"he said. "From my perspec
tive. it's actually easier. I don't have to
organi/e the whole meet. We just get
on a plane and go."
Last year, Stanford beat Oregon
in Eugene, 48-50, for the Champi
onship. That meet's top two returners
Stanford junior Jonathon Riley
(sixth) and Oregon's Steve Fein (sev
enth) — appear ready fora rematch
at the head of the pack.
Though Lananna has not yet set
tled on a starting lineup, any combi
nation of senior Jake Maas, juniors
Thomas Murlev. Michael Stember

and Riley, sophomores Gabe Jen
nings and Jamey Gilford and fresh
men Seth Hejny, Adam Tenforde,
Jesse Thomas and Joe Urbanski
could make an appearance for Stan
ford.
Lananna agrees that Fein and
Riley will likely duke it out, but he is
prepared for other Cardinal runners
to bang heads with the leaders.
"1 think any of four or five of our
guys will contend for the conference
title," he said.
Running with that lead pack
should be Arizona's Mieheil Jones,
Washington's David Bazzi and Cal's
Bolota Asmerom.
Lananna is still facing the task of
solidifying his lineup for the regional
and national championship meets,
which are run over 10 kilometers and
will be in Portland, Ore., on Nov. 13
and Bloomington, Ind., on Nov. 22.

Sophomore Jamey Gifford, freshman Seth Hejny and junior Thomas Murley might all make appearances
this weekend in Long Beach at the Pacific 10 Conference championship meet. Regardless of what hap
pens at this weekend's meet, the No. 2 Cardinal is in a strong position for the upcoming NCAA meet.
