## Best in the west? Runners head to Pac-10 meet 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
I here are two ways to look at Saturday's Pacific 10
Conference championship meet in Long Beach, Calif.
On one hand, it's one more practice, one final run
through at H.(KX) meters and one last tune up before the
real championship season starts.

MEW'S CROSS COUNTRY
â–  Saturday: No. Stanford at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, Long Beach, Calif., 11 a.m.

Then there's the way that the No. 2 Stanford men look
at the race: it's the title meet for the best conference in the
nation, a chance to seize bragging rights for the next year
and an opportunity to extend a league win streak that
currently spans three years.
True, Stanford could finish last at Pac- l()s and still go
to the NCAA meet, and maybe even win it. And with No.
6 Arizona, No. 9 Arizona State and No. 12 Oregon all in
attendance, a win on Saturday is by no means a sure
thing.
