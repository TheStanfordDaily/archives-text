WOMEN'S CROSSCOUNTRY
■ Saturday: No. 1 Stanford at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, Long Beach, Calif., noon

While five top-25 teams will toe the line, including No.
9 Washington, No. 11 Arizona State and No. 14 UCLA,
Stanford is the favorite to capture its sixth title in seven
years, as no team has come close to toppling the Cardinal
this season.
Overconfidence — or perhaps a miracle — are the
only things standing in Stanford's way. Stanford head
coach Vin Lananna. who has driven the (Cardinal to con
ference dominance since arriving in 1992 from Dart
mouth. thinks the former is unlikely to occur.
"I think all of our women will approach this meet the
same way we've approached every meet all season,"
Lananna said. "It could have been very easy for us to go
into everything we did all season with an overconfidence.
But, I think when you get to the conference champi
onships, it's a cool thing to be able to win."
As fora miracle, Lananna's protection against that
occurrence is to not hold back his best talent. With the
West Regional Championships and NCAAs upcoming,
resting some runners this week might seem like an at
tractive option.
"1 think you always go into a competition prepared
fora group to have the best day of their lives and that's
the way we'll go in," Lannana said. "For us to be beaten,
somebody has to have a phenomenal day."
