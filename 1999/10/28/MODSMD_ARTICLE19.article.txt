WOMEN'S CROSSCOUNTRY
■ Saturday: No. 1 Stanford at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, Long Beach, Calif., noon

While five top-25 teams will toe the line, including No.
9 Washington, No. 11 Arizona State and No. 14 UCLA,
Stanford is the favorite to capture its sixth title in seven
years, as no team has come close to toppling the Cardinal
this season.
Overconfidence — or perhaps a miracle — are the
only things standing in Stanford's way. Stanford head
coach Vin Lananna. who has driven the (Cardinal to con
ference dominance since arriving in 1992 from Dart
mouth. thinks the former is unlikely to occur.
"I think all of our women will approach this meet the
same way we've approached every meet all season,"
Lananna said. "It could have been very easy for us to go
into everything we did all season with an overconfidence.
But, I think when you get to the conference champi
onships, it's a cool thing to be able to win."
As fora miracle, Lananna's protection against that
occurrence is to not hold back his best talent. With the
West Regional Championships and NCAAs upcoming,
resting some runners this week might seem like an at
tractive option.
"1 think you always go into a competition prepared
fora group to have the best day of their lives and that's
the way we'll go in," Lannana said. "For us to be beaten,
somebody has to have a phenomenal day."
Among the likely to suit up for the
Cardinal are freshmen Mariel Et
tinger, Lauren Fleshman, Erin Sulli
van and Katie Hotchkiss, sophomore
Caroline Annis, junior Julia Stamps
and seniors Mary Huang and Sally
Glynn. With former Arizona harrier
and four-time Pac-10 champion Amy
Skieresz not in the picture this year,
Stamps and Glynn — the second
and third-place finishers last year —
are favorites for the individual title,
as are Fleshman and Sullivan.
Other top returnees from last
year's meet in Eugene, Ore., are
Washington's Jennifer Smith (fourth

last year) and Kara Syrdal (l()th),
(JSC's Grazyna Penc (seventh) and
Anna Lopaciuch (eighth), Arizona
State's Kelly Mac Donald (15th) and
Arizona's Tara Chaplin (12th).
Chaplin led for much of the race at
the Oct. 16 Pre-NCAA meet in
Bloomington, Ind.. before being
overcome by a group including Stan
ford's Sullivan. If she has a break
through race, Chaplin may have a
chance to give Arizona five straight
individual titles.
But the Cardinal women may be
competing more against each other
than the competition.
"I think we'll prepare all of our
women who have a chance to win to
be in a position to do that," Lananna
said.
