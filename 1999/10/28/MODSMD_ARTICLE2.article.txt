## 
### Pannyun Yiu 
A forum of Stanford religious
community leaders and students
met yesterday evening to discuss the
Knight Initiative and its potential
impact on the gay and lesbian com
munity.
Named after its chief sponsor,
California State Senator Pete
Knight, the initiative declares that
only marriage between a man and a
woman would be legally recognized
in California. It will appear on the
California primary ballot on March
7,2000.
The forum, organized by the
United Campus Christian Ministry
at Stanford, featured Associate
Dean of Religious Life Rev. Mau
rice Charles, First Presbyterian
Church of Palo Alto member Bruce
Hahne and representatives from a
support group called Parents, Fami
lies and Friends of Lesbians and
Gays (PFLAG).
"This is an opportunity for us to
hear some different perspectives
and honor each perspective," said
PFLAG member Bob Carter.
Hahne opened the evening's pro

position exists toward same-sex mar
riage. According to Hanna, much of
it stems from the "fear of having to
redefine what it means to be male or
female, of being dirty in a cultural
sense, of having to look at the Bible in
a different way."
He mentioned the struggle with
long-held stereotypes of how men
and women should think and behave,
and the illusion many people have
that sanctifying same-sex relation
ships would somehow pollute the in
stitution of marriage.
Despite those difficulties, Hahne
said he is optimistic. "The victory is in
sight," he said of the fight for same
sex marriage to be recognized in Cal
ifornia.
He stressed Christianity is not the
enemy many might think. According
to I lahnc, every major denomination
of the Christian church in the United
States now has a group trying to offer
ai) "open and affirming" environ
ment for gays and lesbians.
( arter. who has a lesbian daughter

considering marriage in England,
brought a personal tone to the issue.
"When your child conies out. as a par
ent. you do the opposite. You go into
the closet. It's not an easy road." he
admitted.
Carter mentioned the many chal
lenges his daughter and others in her
situation face, including pending im
migration. adoption, insurance and

hospital-visitation rights.
Charles said that the implications
of the Knight Initiative go beyond
marriage. "II [the Knight initiative]
passes, it can be used as a legal prece
dent for undercutting issues about
domestic partnership in the future,"
he explained.
Student response to the discussion
was spirited. Several students voiced

concerns about reconciling faith with
personal opinions.
Senior Cathy Rion stressed the
importance of students taking a
stand.
"It's problematic that [studentsj
don't vote much." she said. "It's im
portant for us to pay attention and
vote, mobilize, talk to our friends ...
to use our citizenship well."
