# Stanford hoops: a whole new ballgame
## Men's season kicks off amidst questions, promise 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
After losing four senior starters from a team that
went to the Final Four two seasons ago and won a Pa
cific 10 Conference championship last spring, Stan
ford is in trouble, buffeted by questions that provide
no easy answers.
Foremost among them: what will head coach Mike
Montgomery do with the team's overwhelming tal
ent, depth and experience?
Of course, Stanford is not good enough yet to ask
such a question. It wasn't good enough last year ei
ther, even as Art Lee's growling face stared down
from a Sports Illustrated cover proclaiming Stanford
No. 1. However, for all that Stanford lost with the
graduation of Lee, Pete Sauer. Kris Weems and Tim
Young, head coach Mike Montgomery is quite en
thusiastic. And for good reason.

"We have a chance to be real good," he said. "We
still have the talent and guys who know how to win.
We just need to see how they react to tough situations
like tight games in the closing minutes."
Though Montgomery will not get to see the team
in a pressure situation until Stanford opens its season
against Duke Nov. 11 at Madison Square Garden,
Sunday's opening exhibition game against Marathon
Oil will give him a chance to see how the team reacts
when it doesn't know what plays are coming.
"Normally we have five weeks to get ready for our
first game," Montgomery said. "Now we just have
three weeks to get ready. We need to try to get the
best basketball team on the floor [by the Duke game].
We're just trying to get quality time for our guys [this
weekend]."
Though Stanford will probably field an experi
enced starting lineup of two seniors, All-America
candidate Mark Madsen at power forward and David
Moseley at shooting guard, and three juniors, center
Jarron Collins, point guard Mike McDonald and
fourth-year small forward Kvan Mendez, depth is the
team's main problem.
Sophomore point guard Tony Giovacchini and
redshirt freshman Jason Collins, who has missed sub
stantial parts of the last two seasons due to injury, are
the only reserves with significant game experience.
Senior Alex Gelbard, a walk-on, is the only other
non-freshman on the roster.
"We need to develop depth," Montgomery said.
"We need to get clear-cut rotations of three guys at
each position."
While a few freshmen frountcourt players will not
see playing time Sunday so they can retain the possi
bility of taking a redshirt year, everyone else should
sec action.
With the loss of Lee, the Cardinal's best clutch
player in recent memory, one of the bigger question
marks for Stanford lies at point guard. When Brevin
Knight left Stanford in 1997 for the wonders of NBA
mini-stardom, no one was sure whether Lee could
step up to his level. Since Lee established his own
lofty legacy, McDonald now has the unenviable task
of replacing Lee.

Senior shooting guard David Mosely drives at Arizona's Richard Jefferson last season. This year, he
will be one of only three seniors in the Cardinal's relatively inexperienced starting lineup.
While McDonald has, at times,
shown that he can play with the best
in the nation, his development has
been slowed by injuries. His most
important value might lie in replac
ing the leadership Lee provided.
Even when Lee was not playing
well, his intensity helped fuel the
team.
"I hope Mike can do the job that
Art did his junior year," Mont
gomery said. "But Art had started
at shooting guard his sophomore
year and Mike has had some in
juries. We're going to need Mike to
step up, but we're also going to need
Tony [Giovacchini] and [freshman
point guard] Julius Barnes to play."
The frontcourt, though more
solid and experienced, will also
need to develop depth in order to
be effective.
While Madsen and Jarron
Collins form a formidable duo, the
Cardinal will need someone else to
complement Jason Collins off the
bench, especially if, or more likely
when, injury hits.
Freshman Justin Davis, an ath
letic power forward who was heavi
ly recruited around the Pac-10, and
Curtis Borchardt, a skinny but sur
prisingly effective center, will prob
ably end up getting significant time.
Jason Collins, whose injuries

have left holes in Stanford's post
play in the past, is finally healthy
and playing well. While he offered a
glimpse of his talent at the begin
ning of last season, a wrist in jury rel
egated him to the bench fora sec
ond-straight year.

We have a chance to be
real good. We still have the
talent and guys who know
how to win.'
— Mike Montgomery

"Jason's going to get better, he
just doesn't have much game time,"
Montgomery said. "But, there's still
times that he does something that
makes you say. 'Wow. he's going to
be good.' It's critical for us to get a
healthy rotation of Jason, Jarron
and Madsen out there."
While depth is a question both at
point guard and in the low post,
Stanford will have some flexibility
at the shooting guard and small for
ward positions.
While Moseley is excitable and
has been known to throw up a bad
shot or two. he has a knack for hit
ting from outside when it is least ex
pected. Mendcz. meanwhile, was a
model of consistency when he led
the Pac-10 in three-point shooting
percentage two years ago before sit
ting out last season because of a
knee injury.

Redshirt freshman Kyle Logan
and freshman Casey Jacobsen,
probably Stanford's most accom
plished rccruit ever, can fill in at ei
ther position.
Jacobsen, who played for the
1999 U.S. Junior World Champi
onship Team after putting up im
pressive numbers in numerous high
school All-Star games, is a deadly
outside shooter with great funda
mentals. Fie is the No. 2 all-time
scorer in California state high
school history.
Jacobsen will not be starting at
the beginning of the season, but
Montgomery said, "We're going to
put our five best players on the
floor. You'll see a lot of Casey Ja
cobsen."
While past Stanford teams have
been criticized for their often plod
ding pace, Montgomery would like
to get this quicker, more mobile
squad out on the break.
"We don't run on made bas
kets," he said, "but we want to get
out there off of good defense. If you
want to run, you have to play de
fense. And if you want to run, you
gotta push it. If there's no one
ahead of the ball, you can't push it."
This is not the usual Stanford
basketball team, especially not the
one students and fans have gotten
used to the past two years. But as
the Cardinal hopes to show for the
first time this weekend, that is not
necessarily a bad thing.

see playing time Sunday so they can retain the possi
bility of taking a redshirt year, everyone else should
sec action.
With the loss of Lee, the Cardinal's best clutch
player in recent memory, one of the bigger question
marks for Stanford lies at point guard. When Brevin
Knight left Stanford in 1997 for the wonders of NBA
mini-stardom, no one was sure whether Lee could
step up to his level. Since Lee established his own
lofty legacy, McDonald now has the unenviable task
of replacing Lee.

Senior shooting guard David Mosely drives at Arizona's Richard Jefferson last season. This year, he
will be one of only three seniors in the Cardinal's relatively inexperienced starting lineup.
While McDonald has, at times,
shown that he can play with the best
in the nation, his development has
been slowed by injuries. His most
important value might lie in replac
ing the leadership Lee provided.
Even when Lee was not playing
well, his intensity helped fuel the
team.
"I hope Mike can do the job that
Art did his junior year," Mont
gomery said. "But Art had started
at shooting guard his sophomore
year and Mike has had some in
juries. We're going to need Mike to
step up, but we're also going to need
Tony [Giovacchini] and [freshman
point guard] Julius Barnes to play."
The frontcourt, though more
solid and experienced, will also
need to develop depth in order to
be effective.
While Madsen and Jarron
Collins form a formidable duo, the
Cardinal will need someone else to
complement Jason Collins off the
bench, especially if, or more likely
when, injury hits.
Freshman Justin Davis, an ath
letic power forward who was heavi
ly recruited around the Pac-10, and
Curtis Borchardt, a skinny but sur
prisingly effective center, will prob
ably end up getting significant time.
Jason Collins, whose injuries

have left holes in Stanford's post
play in the past, is finally healthy
and playing well. While he offered a
glimpse of his talent at the begin
ning of last season, a wrist in jury rel
egated him to the bench fora sec
ond-straight year.

We have a chance to be
real good. We still have the
talent and guys who know
how to win.'
— Mike Montgomery

"Jason's going to get better, he
just doesn't have much game time,"
Montgomery said. "But, there's still
times that he does something that
makes you say. 'Wow. he's going to
be good.' It's critical for us to get a
healthy rotation of Jason, Jarron
and Madsen out there."
While depth is a question both at
point guard and in the low post,
Stanford will have some flexibility
at the shooting guard and small for
ward positions.
While Moseley is excitable and
has been known to throw up a bad
shot or two. he has a knack for hit
ting from outside when it is least ex
pected. Mendcz. meanwhile, was a
model of consistency when he led
the Pac-10 in three-point shooting
percentage two years ago before sit
ting out last season because of a
knee injury.

Redshirt freshman Kyle Logan
and freshman Casey Jacobsen,
probably Stanford's most accom
plished rccruit ever, can fill in at ei
ther position.
Jacobsen, who played for the
1999 U.S. Junior World Champi
onship Team after putting up im
pressive numbers in numerous high
school All-Star games, is a deadly
outside shooter with great funda
mentals. Fie is the No. 2 all-time
scorer in California state high
school history.
Jacobsen will not be starting at
the beginning of the season, but
Montgomery said, "We're going to
put our five best players on the
floor. You'll see a lot of Casey Ja
cobsen."
While past Stanford teams have
been criticized for their often plod
ding pace, Montgomery would like
to get this quicker, more mobile
squad out on the break.
"We don't run on made bas
kets," he said, "but we want to get
out there off of good defense. If you
want to run, you have to play de
fense. And if you want to run, you
gotta push it. If there's no one
ahead of the ball, you can't push it."
This is not the usual Stanford
basketball team, especially not the
one students and fans have gotten
used to the past two years. But as
the Cardinal hopes to show for the
first time this weekend, that is not
necessarily a bad thing.

Senior Mark Madsen will start at power forward for the Cardinal.
Madsen dominated in the frontcourt last season and is a preseason
All-America candidate.
After losing four senior starters from a team that
went to the Final Four two seasons ago and won a Pa
cific 10 Conference championship last spring, Stan
ford is in trouble, buffeted by questions that provide
no easy answers.
Foremost among them: what will head coach Mike
Montgomery do with the team's overwhelming tal
ent, depth and experience?
Of course, Stanford is not good enough yet to ask
such a question. It wasn't good enough last year ei
ther, even as Art Lee's growling face stared down
from a Sports Illustrated cover proclaiming Stanford
No. 1. However, for all that Stanford lost with the
graduation of Lee, Pete Sauer. Kris Weems and Tim
Young, head coach Mike Montgomery is quite en
thusiastic. And for good reason.

"We have a chance to be real good," he said. "We
still have the talent and guys who know how to win.
We just need to see how they react to tough situations
like tight games in the closing minutes."
Though Montgomery will not get to see the team
in a pressure situation until Stanford opens its season
against Duke Nov. 11 at Madison Square Garden,
Sunday's opening exhibition game against Marathon
Oil will give him a chance to see how the team reacts
when it doesn't know what plays are coming.
"Normally we have five weeks to get ready for our
first game," Montgomery said. "Now we just have
three weeks to get ready. We need to try to get the
best basketball team on the floor [by the Duke game].
We're just trying to get quality time for our guys [this
weekend]."
Though Stanford will probably field an experi
enced starting lineup of two seniors, All-America
candidate Mark Madsen at power forward and David
Moseley at shooting guard, and three juniors, center
Jarron Collins, point guard Mike McDonald and
fourth-year small forward Kvan Mendez, depth is the
team's main problem.
Sophomore point guard Tony Giovacchini and
redshirt freshman Jason Collins, who has missed sub
stantial parts of the last two seasons due to injury, are
the only reserves with significant game experience.
Senior Alex Gelbard, a walk-on, is the only other
non-freshman on the roster.
"We need to develop depth," Montgomery said.
"We need to get clear-cut rotations of three guys at
each position."
