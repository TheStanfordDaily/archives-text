# Stanford hoops: a whole new ballgame
## Men's season kicks off amidst questions, promise 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
After losing four senior starters from a team that
went to the Final Four two seasons ago and won a Pa
cific 10 Conference championship last spring, Stan
ford is in trouble, buffeted by questions that provide
no easy answers.
Foremost among them: what will head coach Mike
Montgomery do with the team's overwhelming tal
ent, depth and experience?
Of course, Stanford is not good enough yet to ask
such a question. It wasn't good enough last year ei
ther, even as Art Lee's growling face stared down
from a Sports Illustrated cover proclaiming Stanford
No. 1. However, for all that Stanford lost with the
graduation of Lee, Pete Sauer. Kris Weems and Tim
Young, head coach Mike Montgomery is quite en
thusiastic. And for good reason.

"We have a chance to be real good," he said. "We
still have the talent and guys who know how to win.
We just need to see how they react to tough situations
like tight games in the closing minutes."
Though Montgomery will not get to see the team
in a pressure situation until Stanford opens its season
against Duke Nov. 11 at Madison Square Garden,
Sunday's opening exhibition game against Marathon
Oil will give him a chance to see how the team reacts
when it doesn't know what plays are coming.
"Normally we have five weeks to get ready for our
first game," Montgomery said. "Now we just have
three weeks to get ready. We need to try to get the
best basketball team on the floor [by the Duke game].
We're just trying to get quality time for our guys [this
weekend]."
Though Stanford will probably field an experi
enced starting lineup of two seniors, All-America
candidate Mark Madsen at power forward and David
Moseley at shooting guard, and three juniors, center
Jarron Collins, point guard Mike McDonald and
fourth-year small forward Kvan Mendez, depth is the
team's main problem.
Sophomore point guard Tony Giovacchini and
redshirt freshman Jason Collins, who has missed sub
stantial parts of the last two seasons due to injury, are
the only reserves with significant game experience.
Senior Alex Gelbard, a walk-on, is the only other
non-freshman on the roster.
"We need to develop depth," Montgomery said.
"We need to get clear-cut rotations of three guys at
each position."
While a few freshmen frountcourt players will not
see playing time Sunday so they can retain the possi
bility of taking a redshirt year, everyone else should
sec action.
With the loss of Lee, the Cardinal's best clutch
player in recent memory, one of the bigger question
marks for Stanford lies at point guard. When Brevin
Knight left Stanford in 1997 for the wonders of NBA
mini-stardom, no one was sure whether Lee could
step up to his level. Since Lee established his own
lofty legacy, McDonald now has the unenviable task
of replacing Lee.

Senior shooting guard David Mosely drives at Arizona's Richard Jefferson last season. This year, he
will be one of only three seniors in the Cardinal's relatively inexperienced starting lineup.
