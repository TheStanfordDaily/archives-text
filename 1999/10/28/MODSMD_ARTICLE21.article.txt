# Card aims for un'chaotic' week
## Men's practice begins without fanfare of last year's event 
### Jim Tankersley Senior staff writer 
Men's basketball season at Michi
gan State began at midnight Oct. 16
when Spartan head coach Tom Izzo
rode his 1 larley-Davidson onto the
Breslin Center hardwood. At The
Pit in New Mexico, players wowed
fans with high-flying late-night
dunks.
Hut there were no alley-oops or
motorcycles in Stanford's Maples
Pavilion, which sat quietly through
the night until players and coaches
filed in early the next morning for the
season's first practice.
A year after Midnight Madness
came to Maples, the Cardinal
opened its 1999-2(XX) men's basket
ball campaign with windsprints,
passing drills and all the fanfare of an
Expos-Pirates series in September.
Head coach Mike Montgomery
said the move was purely functional:

with only three weeks from the start
of the season to Stanford's first game
— a Nov. 11 Coaches' Classic contest
against Duke in New York's Madi
son Square Garden — the Cardinal
needs all the practice time it can get.
But doing away with Cardinal
Chaos, a midnight tradition that last
ed all of one year, also signals a key
difference between this year's Stan
ford squad and the team that Sports
Illustrated ranked No. 1 in the nation
at the beginning of last season.
Arthur Lee, Kris Weems, Peter
Sauer and Tim Young—the Class of
'99 backbone of Stanford's Sweet
Sixteen, Final Four and Pacific 10
Conference champion teams — are
gone. And so is the hype.
"We needed to take a more busi
ness-like approach this year," Mont
gomery said of his decision to cancel
the Chaos. "We have to have a dif
ferent approach — we have a differ
ent team."

Stanford's lineup this year in
cludes six new players, members of
what could be one of the best recruit
ing classes in school history. In the
next three weeks. Montgomery and
his staff face the daunting task of in
tegrating the newcomers with a tal
ented group of juniors and seniors
who now form the team's core.
The veterans aren't the only ones
getting used to the new faces. Stan
ford fans, after two years of falling in
love with Art and the Gang, will rely
on their programs this season to dis
cern who's who on the floor for the
Cardinal.
Fans' preseason moods seem to
have shifted accordingly. Mark
Thompson, a former Stanford point
guard and a co-director of the team's
marketing office, said the hype of '98
has turned to the curiosity of '99.
"Last year, vou knew exactly
what was coming," Thompson said.
"This year, everybody is curious and
wanting to come to practice."
Student fans have extra cause for
confusion. Stanford changed its stu
dent ticketing policy this year, scrap
ping week-long campouts in line fora
merit-based system that sells an un
limited number of unguaranteed sea
son tickets and rewards the best-at
tending fans with seats at the biggest
games of the year.
Because only the first 1,200 stu
dents at Maples will get into most
games, athletics department officials
will allow fans to begin lining up at 6
a.m. on game days. Basketball mar
keting director John Hopkins said
last week that he expects some stu

dents will turn out that early for Sun
day's season-opening exhibition
against Marathon Oil.
Once inside, students will find
their courtside cheering section
shrunk by 50 seats, Hopkins con
firmed this week, because the depart
ment moved the Stanford Band from
under the south basket into the stu
dent section. The move sits the Band
next to Sixth Man Club members and
frees up 50 more spots for alumni.
Despite all the changes, some
things will stay the same. Senior All-
American candidate Mark Madscn
returns to anchor the club. Maples
Pavilion, with its near-elastic floor
panels and a still-large student sec
tion on the sideline, remains one of
the toughest venues in the Pac-1().
And you can bet Mike Mont
gomery won't ever ride in on a
Harlev.
