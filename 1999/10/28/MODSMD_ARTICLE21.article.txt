# Card aims for un'chaotic' week
## Men's practice begins without fanfare of last year's event 
### Jim Tankersley Senior staff writer 
Men's basketball season at Michi
gan State began at midnight Oct. 16
when Spartan head coach Tom Izzo
rode his 1 larley-Davidson onto the
Breslin Center hardwood. At The
Pit in New Mexico, players wowed
fans with high-flying late-night
dunks.
Hut there were no alley-oops or
motorcycles in Stanford's Maples
Pavilion, which sat quietly through
the night until players and coaches
filed in early the next morning for the
season's first practice.
A year after Midnight Madness
came to Maples, the Cardinal
opened its 1999-2(XX) men's basket
ball campaign with windsprints,
passing drills and all the fanfare of an
Expos-Pirates series in September.
Head coach Mike Montgomery
said the move was purely functional:

with only three weeks from the start
of the season to Stanford's first game
— a Nov. 11 Coaches' Classic contest
against Duke in New York's Madi
son Square Garden — the Cardinal
needs all the practice time it can get.
But doing away with Cardinal
Chaos, a midnight tradition that last
ed all of one year, also signals a key
difference between this year's Stan
ford squad and the team that Sports
Illustrated ranked No. 1 in the nation
at the beginning of last season.
Arthur Lee, Kris Weems, Peter
Sauer and Tim Young—the Class of
'99 backbone of Stanford's Sweet
Sixteen, Final Four and Pacific 10
Conference champion teams — are
gone. And so is the hype.
"We needed to take a more busi
ness-like approach this year," Mont
gomery said of his decision to cancel
the Chaos. "We have to have a dif
ferent approach — we have a differ
ent team."

Stanford's lineup this year in
cludes six new players, members of
what could be one of the best recruit
ing classes in school history. In the
next three weeks. Montgomery and
his staff face the daunting task of in
tegrating the newcomers with a tal
ented group of juniors and seniors
who now form the team's core.
The veterans aren't the only ones
getting used to the new faces. Stan
ford fans, after two years of falling in
love with Art and the Gang, will rely
on their programs this season to dis
cern who's who on the floor for the
Cardinal.
Fans' preseason moods seem to
have shifted accordingly. Mark
Thompson, a former Stanford point
guard and a co-director of the team's
marketing office, said the hype of '98
has turned to the curiosity of '99.
