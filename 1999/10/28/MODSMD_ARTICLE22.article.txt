# Gregory stands out among the rest
## Defensive specialist extordinaire has emerged from the shadow of her dad and her teammates

Only on the Stanford women's volleyball
team can a high school Ail-American, two
time NCAA champion and team leader in
digs in 1997 get lost in the shuffle.
On a team of superstars, it is easy to over
look the contributions of senior defensive
specialist Jaimi Gregory while being dazzled
by the likes of senior Kerri Walsh and fresh
man Logan Tom.
But despite playing in the shadow of
Walsh, a three-time Ail-American, Gregory
has been able to make quite a name for her
self with her spectacular defense, energy and
enthusiastic attitude. But what matters more
to the team than any of her acrobatic digs or
service aces is her unselfishness and willing
ness to sacrifice personal glory for the sake of
the team.
In a prime example, Gregory, an outside
hitter during her first three years as a Cardi
nal, willingly gave up that position for her
final year and has instead assumed the role of
defensive specialist extraordinaire.
"There are so many good outside hitters
on the team now," she said.

Although she lias a somewhat diminished
role as far as time on the court, Gregory's
play at her new position is equally indispens
able, as she dominates the back row and has
helped keep the Cardinal in the game on
many occasions.
A self-described "gym rat'* as a kid grow
ing up in Eiugene. Ore., Jaimi Gregory has
been around the sport of volleyball for as
long as she can remember. I let father. Gerry
Gregory, was a member of the men's volley
ball U.S. National Team from 1978-1979,
along with present Stanford women's volley
ball coach Don Shaw. Her mother played
volleyball in college, and continued to play
while pregnant with Jaimi, even going so far
as to dive for loose balls. This no doubt had
some effect on the next Gregory volleyball
prodigy, who has been known to dive fora
few balls in her time, as well.
Jaimi began learning the skills necessary
for volleyball as soon as physically possible,
which for her was around four years of age.
She would attend volleyball practices at the
University of Oregon, where her dad
coached from 1986 to 1994, and would beg
