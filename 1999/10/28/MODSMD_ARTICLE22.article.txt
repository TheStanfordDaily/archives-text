# Gregory stands out among the rest
## Defensive specialist extordinaire has emerged from the shadow of her dad and her teammates 
### Emily Cadei Contributing writer 
Only on the Stanford women's volleyball
team can a high school Ail-American, two
time NCAA champion and team leader in
digs in 1997 get lost in the shuffle.
On a team of superstars, it is easy to over
look the contributions of senior defensive
specialist Jaimi Gregory while being dazzled
by the likes of senior Kerri Walsh and fresh
man Logan Tom.
But despite playing in the shadow of
Walsh, a three-time Ail-American, Gregory
has been able to make quite a name for her
self with her spectacular defense, energy and
enthusiastic attitude. But what matters more
to the team than any of her acrobatic digs or
service aces is her unselfishness and willing
ness to sacrifice personal glory for the sake of
the team.
In a prime example, Gregory, an outside
hitter during her first three years as a Cardi
nal, willingly gave up that position for her
final year and has instead assumed the role of
defensive specialist extraordinaire.
"There are so many good outside hitters
on the team now," she said.

Although she lias a somewhat diminished
role as far as time on the court, Gregory's
play at her new position is equally indispens
able, as she dominates the back row and has
helped keep the Cardinal in the game on
many occasions.
A self-described "gym rat'* as a kid grow
ing up in Eiugene. Ore., Jaimi Gregory has
been around the sport of volleyball for as
long as she can remember. I let father. Gerry
Gregory, was a member of the men's volley
ball U.S. National Team from 1978-1979,
along with present Stanford women's volley
ball coach Don Shaw. Her mother played
volleyball in college, and continued to play
while pregnant with Jaimi, even going so far
as to dive for loose balls. This no doubt had
some effect on the next Gregory volleyball
prodigy, who has been known to dive fora
few balls in her time, as well.
Jaimi began learning the skills necessary
for volleyball as soon as physically possible,
which for her was around four years of age.
She would attend volleyball practices at the
University of Oregon, where her dad
coached from 1986 to 1994, and would beg

the team to play with her.
I was a rascal," she
says with a laugh, "always chasing
vdfleyballs, running around under
bljwchers."
*4n fifth grade, Gregory began
playing on her first volleyball club
team, and in seventh grade joined
the team that she would play for
until her senior year of high school,
and which both her parents
coached. In this way, volleyball be
came both a sport and a family
bonding experience. However,
Jaimi is quick to point out that "my
dad was extra hard on me because I
was the coach's daughter."
All the volleyball experience at
such a young age, not to mention
tin;great genes, started paying div
idends as soon as Jaimi reached
high school.
Attending Sheldon High
School, Gregory received many ac
cedes, including the highlight of
hefng named Oregon State player
of the year her junior year. A dedi
cated student as well as athlete, she
describes her life in high school as
"volleyball, my friends, and school
- I never really dated."
It seemed that Gregory had
everything together going into her
seijior year, until her world was
turned upside down by her family's
division to move to Southern Cali
l()Phia when her dad received a new
coaching position. Although it was
hard leaving behind a core group of
friends in Oregon and having to
start all over at a new place — Long
Beach Wilson High School — for
her senior year, Jaimi believes the
experience taught her a great deal
about herself and helped her pre
pare for the leap to college.
Gregory's decision to attend

Stanford hinged on her desire to
have the best of both worlds, a first
tier academic and athletic institu
tion. It didn't hurt that the Stanford
women's volleyball team is, in her
words, "the premier team to be
on."
Indeed, when Gregory joined
the team as a freshman in 19%, it
was stacked with such superstars as
outside hitter Kristin Folkl and set
ter Lisa Sharpley, both juniors at
the time, as well as fellow freshman
Kcrri Walsh. However, having
been used to a high level of compe
tition after playing on the youth na
tional team and being named MVP
of the Junior Olympics the summer
before, Gregory was able to come
right in and make a contribution,
no mean feat considering who she
was battling for playing time. Gre
gory summed up her lack of intimi
dation by stating simply, "I knew
that a player that's recruited be
longs there."
Despite being one of the small
est outside hitters in the conference
at 5 feet. <S inches, Jaimi ranked
fourth on the team in digs, earned
Honorable Mention Pac-10 All-
Freshman recognition and helped
the Cardinal win a national title in
1996, proving it's not how big you
are, it's how big you play.
Gregory followed up a stellar
freshman year by earning a starting
spot at outside hitter in 1997. Con
tinuing to impress with her amazing
digs and on-court enthusiasm,
Jaimi established herself as one of
the Cardinal's go-to players. She
also played a significant role in the
postseason, as Stanford topped off
its year with a second consecutive
NCAA championship, an unprece
dented feat.
After the excitement and suc
cess of her first two seasons, an in
jury-riddled junior year brought
Gregory back down to earth.

Slowed by torn cartilage in her
knee, Jaimi missed several match
es, hut continued to prove herself
invaluable to the team in the limit
ed amount of games she was able to
play.
Now, in her final campaign with
the Cardinal, Gregory has made
the transition from outside hitter to
defensive specialist nearly seam
lessly. Seeing major action all sea
son, Gregory has continued to pro
vide a spark for the team while
ranking third in number of service
aces with 11 and in number of digs
with 136. In addition, Gregory has
provided leadership and guidance
that only a senior and two-time na
tional champion can have.
Now, with post-Stanford choices
looming before her, Jaimi can fully
appreciate all that she will be able
take with her from being a Stanford
student-athlete. She cites such
skills as "level of organization,
work ethic, ability to deal with a
team atmosphere," as lessons she
has learned from her time as a Stan
ford Cardinal. In her immediate fu
ture, Gregory anticipates training
to become a chiropractor and mar
rying her boyfriend of a year and a
half this July.
"Enthusiastic," "competitive,"
and"a hard worker" are ways that
Jaimi's teammates and coach have
repeatedly described her, and Gre
gory has definitely proven worthy
of such descriptions throughout her
career at Stanford. Gregory will
look to ride off into the sunset of
her final season by helping the No.
2 Cardinal claim another national
championship this December, but
no matter what the outcome, she
will always have the pride of her fa
ther in her.
As she explains, "My whole life
I've been know as Gerry Gregory's
daughter, but now he says he's
known as Jaimi Gregory's dad."
