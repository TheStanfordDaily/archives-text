The tournament, held at the Stan
ford Golf Course every year, pro
vides an alternative competition to
those teams in the upper echelon of
college golf not attending the Golf
World Invitational at Hilton Head,
S.C., next weekend.
"It's the party that 1 throw every
fall." said head coach Wally Good
win. "It gives evervone a chance to

play with people from across the na
tion and outside of their districts."
Stanford's team will have,five
team members card scores for it,
while four others will play as individ
uals. After last Wednesday's dual
match victory against UC-Davis and
a weekend of qualifying rounds, the
Cardinal will field senior captain
Dusty Brett (208 through 52 holes),
juniors Eric Dahlberg (206). Jimmy
Lee (207). Alex Aragon (212) and
sophomore transfer Philip Rowc
(205). The last of three qualifying
rounds was shortened to 16 holes due
to darkness.
Aragon won his spot on the tour
nament roster in a 14-hole playoff
Tuesday afternoon at Stanford Golt
Course against freshman Jim Seki.
Aragon"s solid play down the stretch
helped him hold on fora one-stroke
victory.
The week is not over for Seki.
however. He will play as an individ
ual in the Nelson, along with junior
Rudy Barreto, sophomore Ned Yet
ten and freshman Ron Won.
If the Cardinal intends to hold
court at home, it will need to over
come the imposing presence of
Northwestern's Luke Donald, the
Nelson Invitational's defending
champion and the No. 2 individual
player in men's college golf.
Donald and the No. 1 Wildcats
will leave the cold of Evanston for
Stanford to play on one of the great
courses in the nation.
"We come every year," said
Northwestern head coach Pat Goss.
"It's one of our favorite events on a
wonderful golf course."
Brett admits that having a player
such as Donald at the Nelson does
motivate him to play better, but he
knows that he has no control over
other players.
"All you can do is use [Donald's]
play as a measuring stick," he said.
While some may consider it an ad
vantage to play on one's own course,
Goodwin believes that it is actually
more difficult to win at home.
"There are so many unnatural
things at home that are unlike every
other tournament we attend, like not
staying in a hotel and getting solid
rest," he said. "Plus, we're expected
to win."
In addition, the groundskeepers
at the golf course will introduce un
common tee and pin placements that
will not be disclosed to Stanford or
any other team until play begins.
