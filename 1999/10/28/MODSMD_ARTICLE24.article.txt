The Public Management Program at the Grad
uate Sch(x)l of Business received a national award
for its extraordinary work in social stewardship
eariier this month.
The World Resources Institute and the Aspen
Institute's Initiative for Social Innovation through
Business presented the award in New York on Oct.
7. This is the first time business schools have been
nationally recognized for addressing social issues.
Stanford's Business School was one of 10
schools in a national pool of 313 that were recog
nized for their programs in social issues.
"Stanford will be a benchmark for other institu
tions to follow suit in addressing complex social

problems," said Julie Juergens, director of the
Business School's Public Management Program.
Arjay Miller, former dean of the Business
School, founded the Public Management Program
in 1971 to facilitate the relationship between busi
ness and government leaders.
According to Juergens, the program has since
expanded to help Stanford's MBA students be
come effective leaders in the social sector. The pro
gram focuses on academic, extra-curricular and co
curricular areas.
"It is a comprehensive approach to public man
agement education. It recognizes that effective
leadership is crucial... and helps students become
effective leaders in all sectors who can influence the
social issues," Juergens said.

The award honored two of the Business
School's Public Management Programs, MB Aid
and Start Up. MB Aid is a nonprofit organization
run hy students that facilitates development in
countries such as Bangladesh. Brazil, Cameroon,
Central America and Vietnam.
Public Management Program students founded
Start Up. a micro-lending program, to foster entre
preneurship in and around East Palo Alto. Start
IJp's members act as business consultants, review
ing business plans for East Palo Alto entrepre
neurs.
The Public Management Program sponsors
other direct community service, such as tutoring,
mentoring and volunteering as board members for
local nonprofits.
