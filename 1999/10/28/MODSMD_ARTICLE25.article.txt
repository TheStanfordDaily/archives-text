# Nye discusses solutions for U.S.-Asia policy

### Greg Page 
Yesterday afternoon, Joseph Nye,
dean of the Kennedy School of Gov
ernment at Harvard University,
spoke on American diplomacy in
northeast Asia, stressing the need for
close relations with Japan, communi
cation with North Korea and caution
in handling tension between China
and Taiwan.
Speaking to a packed house in
I. : .ncina Hall, Nye outlined several
possible courses of action the United
States could take toward China.
The first option Nye discussed
was complete American withdrawal
from the region which he dismissed
as "almost impossible" and"a had
idea."
"We're talking about one of the
most vibrant parts of the world econ

omy," he said. "And the rising influ
ence of Asian-Americans in the Unit
ed States [ties us even closer]."
Nye also discussed the possibility
of creating regional security alliances,
which would allow the United States
to reduce its presence while main
taining stability in the region. Nye
warned that one danger with such a
proposal is that the United States
might not be prepared to handle
problems during the transition peri
od.
Some foreign policy strategists ad
vocate another option, the creation
of a coalition to contain China. Pro
ponents argue that the I Jnited States
successfully used a similar strategy in
containing the Soviet Union.
Nye, however, does not endorse
that strategy. "Other Asian nations
don't see China the way [the West

sawj the Russians during the Cold
War," he said. "This would just exac
erbate current problems. If you treat
China as an enemy, you are guaran
teeing yourself an enemy."
A better idea, Nye suggested,
would be to form a strong alliance
with Japan. Then, he said. "China
could not hold the Japan card against
us. We could afford to engage China
as a normal country."
Regarding Taiwan, Nye reminded
the audience that the United States
must "walk a tightrope," as it "faces
the dual challenges of supporting the
Taiwanese people and [not antago
nizing the Chinese]."
C urrently. some Congressmen are
pushing for legislation that would re
quire the United States to aid Taiwan
should any problems with China
arise. Nye said he believes such a pro-

posal is dangerous.
Nye credited Stanford Prof, and
former Defense Secretary William
Perry for his efforts to maintain peace
with North Korea. Ideally, according
to a report Perry recently drafted,
North Korea would agree to stop
missile tests and freeze nuclear devel
opment. In exchange, the United
States would remove sanctions and
give diplomatic recognition to North
Korea.
Despite the recent news of a pend
ing nuclear development freeze, Nye
cautioned, "We're by no means out
of the woods yet."
Nye. the Don K. Price Professor of
Public Policy, returned to Harvard in
1995 after serving as assistant secre
tary of defense for International Se
curity Affairs and winning two Dis
tinguished Service medals.
