# Linking health and consciousness
## Expert touts methods of alternative medicine 
### Amy Christeson 
Dr. Marilyn Schlitz, director of
research for the Institute of Noetic
Sciences, spoke yesterday on the
advancement of alternative medi
cine and the relationship between
consciousness and healing.
"This is an incredible time to be
alive," Schlitz began.
The audience included various
alternative practitioners such as en
ergy healers, massage therapists
and touch therapists.
Schlitz explained that "noetic" is
an old Greek concept cqming from
a word meaning "direct knowing."
According to Schlitz, noetic science
provides a context for questioning
"the interface between conscious
ness and health."
In other words, Schlitz studies
the healing powers of the mind, in
cluding prayer, meditation and en
ergy distribution. Schlitz and her
colleagues investigate "the healer
within" and strive to find ways to
incorporate alternative health care
into mainstream science and medi
cine.
"Alternative medicine has gone
from granola-eating hippies in
Northern California to Stanford,"
she said.
She expressed optimism for the
future of noetic sciences and for the
reconciliation of Western science
and ancient wisdom through the
addition of noetic beliefs to medical
school curriculums.
Those beliefs include spending
more time with patients and per
sonalizing individual cases. "We
have knowledge, but do we have

the wisdom to make the right deci
sions with our technology?" she
asked.
Schlitz earned her doctorate
from the University of Texas at
Austin and completed her postdoc
toral fellowship at Stanford Uni
versity's psychology department.
She told the story of Edward
Mitchell, an Apollo 14 astronaut,
whose epiphany on his return to
earth launched a new age in noetic
studies.
In a video shown at the presen
tation, Mitchell said, "Our stories
of ourselves told by science and re
ligious cosmology [are] incomplete
and flawed. We [need] a new way."
Mitchell said he saw the need for
reconciling scientific and emotional
worlds, and so he founded the Insti
tute of Noetic Sciences in 1973.
Twenty-seven years later, the
Institute runs cross-cultural re
search. studies spiritual and inten
tional health healing and investi
gates subtle energies and energy
medicine.
The institute focuses mainly on
consciousness, body and society
and on the questions "Who arc
we?" and "What are we capable of
becoming?"
Schlitz said that society's current
"profound state of transformation"
challenges the standard Western
medicine paradigm.
"Science emphasizes replicabili
ty, and objectivity is a corner
stone." She said the post-modern
movement, in contrast, "is mainly a
self-reflcction on what is going on
in scientific studies and relation
ships."
