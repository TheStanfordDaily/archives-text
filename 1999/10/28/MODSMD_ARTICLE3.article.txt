# Prof affirms Bradley's merits as a candidate, roommate

Prof. Dan Okimoto has kept in touch
with his old college roommate more
than the average student. Perhaps
that is because his roommate at
Princeton was Bill Bradley, who is

currently running for the Democratic
Presidential nomination.
Okimoto discussed Bradley's
moral integrity and emotional lire
during a talk sponsored by the Stan
ford Democrats at the Law School
last night.
Race, health care and welfare

were the main issues discussed in
both last night's New Hampshire
town-hall debate between Bradley
and Vice President Al Gore and the
talk by Okimoto, who is serving as a
senior policy advisor for Bradley.
