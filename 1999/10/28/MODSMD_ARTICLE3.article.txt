Prof. Dan Okimoto has kept in touch
with his old college roommate more
than the average student. Perhaps
that is because his roommate at
Princeton was Bill Bradley, who is

currently running for the Democratic
Presidential nomination.
Okimoto discussed Bradley's
moral integrity and emotional lire
during a talk sponsored by the Stan
ford Democrats at the Law School
last night.
Race, health care and welfare

were the main issues discussed in
both last night's New Hampshire
town-hall debate between Bradley
and Vice President Al Gore and the
talk by Okimoto, who is serving as a
senior policy advisor for Bradley.

Last night, Bradley (left) debated Vice President Al Gore in a town-hall style event at New Hampshire,
the first of a series of debates as the candidates compete for the Democratic Presidential nomination.
Okimoto commented on clips of the debate at his talk.
Bradley, a Rhodes scholar at
Princeton, was a star forward for the
NBA's New York Knicks from 1%7
to 1977 and New Jersey's U.S. Sena
tor from 1978 to 1996.
In 1996, he resigned his seat to
start a grassroots movement for
fundamental campaign finance re
form.
Bradley also spent 1997-98 at
Stanford as a visiting professor at the
Institute for International Studies,

giving several public lectures over the
course of the year.
"I have never met a person with
such integrity," Okimoto said.
Okimoto told a story from their
college days that he said showed
Bradley's high character.
"In college, girls used to follow
him everywhere," Okimoto said. He
went on to describe how an unknown
girl once waited naked in Bradley's
bed. When Bradley discovered her
upon returning from the library, he
convinced her to put on her clothes
and go back home.
Okimoto said Bradley's moral

code can also be seen in his decision
not to approach special-interest
groups to help finance his cam
paign.
Despite this decision, Bradley was
able to raise $7.2 million last quarter,
compared to Gore's $6.5 million.
Okimoto praised Bradley's health
care plan for its incorporation of tech
nology.
"Bradley believes there is enor
mous inefficiency in current health
care and that introducing Internet
technology into this equation could
save hundreds of billions of dollars
for the American public." he said.

During the debate, Gore attacked
Bradley on his health care plan.
Bradley countered by saying that the
figures that Gore cited were incor
rect.
Students who attended the talk
said they were impressed by
Bradley's performance during the
televised debate.
"Bradley sparked interest be
cause he is in such stark contrast to
the other candidates running. Even
if he doesn't win, he is at least set
ting a good example. 1 le is showing
people the right way to win," said
KC George, a sophomore who

served as the liaison between Oki
moto and the Stanford Democrats.
"My first impressions are that he
is an admirable guy, but the way
Prof. Okimoto framed him seemed
too good to be true. ... Everything
seemed too perfect, but I was defi
nitely convinced to vote for
Bradley," said Erik Wong, a fresh
man.
"I think that his politics are mov
ing left with the [coming of] the De
mocratic primaries, whereas Gore
seems very centrist," said freshman
Brendan Burke, a member of the
Stanford Democrats.

Okimoto also commented on
Bradley's understanding that the
United States is the lone superpow
er in the world, and that many other
nations believe that power is
abused.
He said Bradley hopes to create a
stable new international order
through the formation of global
power, where the United States does
not hold the main influence.
"The American public is sick and
tired of politics as usual.... Bradley
would like to focus on what can be
done, not on what can not," conclud
ed Okimoto.
