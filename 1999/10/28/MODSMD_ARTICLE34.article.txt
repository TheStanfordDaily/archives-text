# Kennedy plays Milt Jackson and Brahms
## Music/Dance 
### 
Kennedy, formerly known as Nigel Kennedy, showed what he is capable of when
he followed the Brahms Violin Concerto with a duet version of "Bags' Groove,"
a piece by the late jazz vibraphonist Milt Jackson. Michael Burr played bass with
Kennedy, and the two played joyfully, like old chums.
Kennedy's improvisations in the upper register sounded like they could go on forev
er, even though they only lasted a couple seconds in real time. Indeed, the most endear
ing thing about his performance was his enthusiasm for everything — the music, the or
chestra and the audience.
Unfortunately, it took a bit of time before the Symphony and Kennedy got in sync.

After a lovely opening, the tone of the concerto became
hard. The first two movements suffered from sudden
swings between sweetness and harshness. Throughout
the first two movements, Kennedy and the Symphony
lacked a coherent sense of purpose.

The third movement, however, was right on target. The Symphony and Kennedy
played fast and boisterously, complementing each other well in the exchanges between
orchestra and vio'in. Every note the Symphony played had direction and each section of
the orchestra played as one unified instrument. William Bennett's oboe solo beginning
the second movement was particularly moving.
Kennedy did not disappoint for lack of new ideas. Rather than being locked in by the
formal structure of the concerto, he played extremely freely throughout the entire dance.
Enough cannot be said for the lyricism and sheer beauty of Kennedy's upper register. It
seemed that the higher Kennedy played, the more beautiful and the more at ease the
music became.
Still, not everything about his playing was beautiful. Some sections were downright
dirty, featuring series of notes that were out of tune, underlined by Kennedy's shoes
stomping on the stage floor. If one wonders how much influence Kennedy's outreach
into jazz has had on his performance of classical music, this concert may be enlightening.
Kennedy's playing is not bound by convention, and seen when he walked onto the stage
wearing different colored socks.
John Corigliano's "Three Hallucinations" was based on the film score for Ken Rus
sell's 1980 film "Altered States." The film score earned Corigliano a nomination for an
Academy Award in 1981. The three hallucinations are titled, "Sacrifice," "Hymn" and
"Ritual." This is a difficult piece, and Andreas Delfs did an admirable job keeping the
group together. In this piece, each section of the orchestra plays a sketch which is abrupt
ly replaced by a different section of the orchestra playing a different sketch. All parts
were played so convincingly that I thought I was listening not to an orchestra but rather
to a chorus of wild insects and screaming goats.

The Symphony finished with the Suite from "Der Rosenkavalier" by Richard Strauss.
Here, the Symphony played grandly. The winds sang beautiful lines, and the strings
sounded lush and full. The waltz section of the overture was simply delightful.
This concert was part of the San Francisco Symphony's half-price student series. This
deal is a steal, so contact the box office fora season of Symphony concerts at 50 to 60 per
cent off before the offer expires October 30th.
