# Without Flatley, 'Riverdance' still moves audiences

### 
Although "Riverdance — The Show" would have been even more impressive
had I not been exposed beforehand to the years of hype it has gotten, I
walked (actually, I danced) out of the Orpheum Theatre in San Francisco
with the strong pulsing beat of feet and drums loudly pounding in my head.
Even for those of us who have two left feet, this show really does create an urge to
do an Irish jig. I actually attempted this several times in the lobby during intermis-

sion, much to my boyfriend's embarrassment.
"Riverdance" also has a deep emotional effect on the viewer,

and not because it attempts to tell a
complex story or be philosophical
and avant-garde. Critics have had a
hard time putting into words the
artistic simplicity of "Riverdance"
since it was first released in Ireland in
the early '90s.
There is something universally

transmitted when dance and music are performed well. "River
dance," a fine modern example, has been wildly successful in every
country that it has been staged in over the past five years, and even
its soundtrack has been a best-seller worldwide.
The synthesis of a moving musical performance with a dance
performance that has a reverberating effect on the mind like noth
ing else, and the soundtrack itself, or even a videotape, cannot
recreate the magic of "Riverdance."
It is often difficult to tell whether the dancers or the musicians

are creating the music because of the echoing nature of the drums and stomping feet.
"Riverdance" seems to tap into a very primal appreciation for rhythm, movement
and sound. Those elements, pulled off with outstanding precision and talent, com
bine with the extremely effective visual aid of a colorful and awe-inspiring set to
make for an amazing show.
The set itself encapsulates the wordless communication that "Riverdance" con

veys, as well. The colors and lights on stage are generally blue and red and the show
moves between simple night scenes with powerful watery blues and an enormous
moon to bright red and orange scenes that shock with light and sound. There is a
memorable flamenco performance entitled "Firedance" in the show set to music and
a stage that seem to be enveloped in fire.
The performers themselves are top quality. The two leads, Michael Patrick Gal-

lagher and Niamh Roddy, are good, but they are almost upstaged
by a cast of dancers who are equally as coordinated and who move
in perfect unison during the famous chorus-line-esque scenes.
A Russian group of dancers also steal the show with their
acrobatic folk-dancing that draws patterns all over the stage and
makes jaws drop at their combination of dance and gymnastics.
The most memorable performers — Channing Holmes,
Martin Dumas and Charon Aldredge —do not follow an Irish
repertoire at all. This Jazz-tap ensemble, who received more ap
plause than even the leads, perform a funky show on their own and
then have a competition with three Irish dancers, which starts off as
a seemingly indignant cultural confrontation and ends up as more
of a philosophical statement that dance is universal and that it
forms a bridge between language barriers of all kinds. This is a
unique aspect of the show and serves not only as a humorous, en
tertaining skit, but also as a breather from the Irish dancing, which
was wonderfully intense but it can be overwhelming in large doses.
I highly recommend taking in "Riverdance." Like other
critics in my shoes, I have not been able to do justice to the impact

that the show had on me, but the fact that the audience gave a double standing ova
tion speaks at least for the quality of the show and the impression it left on a large
mass of people. No matter how much hype you have heard, "Riverdance" is a trip you
cannot imagine until you have taken it.
