## America's favorite teenie-boppers move... out of the 'Backstreet' and into San Jose 
### 
Now stop laughing. I
know fora fact many of
you — noble, sage Stan
ford readers — were there. I also
know that there was this group
called New Kids on the Block
earlier this decade, and while I
was grunging to Nirvana and the
like, Joey, Jordan and the others
were wowing young Americans.
So 1 missed out on that experi
ence.
Yes, for one night, I was
clearly in the minority twice
fold. Not only was I the wrong
gender, but I also fell out of the
target age group by five years.
The heart of the matter is this:
I have finally gotten over my
misplaced embarassment for my
tolerance in Backstreet Boys, or
BSB to their fans. From the con
cert, I saw middle-aged fathers
singing with their children, 20-
something couples grooving in
t he aisles and throngs of pre-teen
girls cheering with their moms
every time they saw their fa
vorite on the gigantic big screen
above the concert floor.
You all know the songs, and
so what if they're a bit cheesy,
repetitive or familiar? A.J.,
Howie, Brian, Kevin and Nick
began their eye-opening, 18- I
song set with a smoke-filled

cruise onio me stadium Moor via snowboaru-type saucers
from the ceiling. The fans never stopped screaming from
that moment on, and thankfully the female reviewer next
to me had some extra earplugs.
"Larger Than Life," which had played courtesv of
Sears just moments before on the overhead monitor, was
the first song. BSB tried to carry over the futuristic theme
in their current No. 1 MTV video to a live staged version.

Backstreet Boys — Into the Millennium Tour
October 21 and 22
The San Jose Arena
525 W. Santa Clara St.
San Jose
(4()8) 297-7070

The fivesome, dressed in plastic-coated, futuristic-look
ing protective suits, moved around with a montage of
dancers, who had marched in to the stadium carrying
fiery torches to the ominous beat of Darth Vader chords.
What was cool about the whole event was the number

of eye-candy gimmicks. Suspended BSB members tossed
stuffed animals to the audience, a variety of props (chairs,
poles, red blinkers, top hats) cleverly enlivened the ac
tion, and pyrotechnic flames, colored lasers and sparkler
fireworks often closed out song sets.
Kevin showed off his piano technique with a pair of
songs, the second one being "Back to Your Heart," off of
their weaker second album, "Millennium."
In general, the second album's songs, of which they
played all but one, sounded much weaker in terms of
lyrics and rhythms than "Backstreet Boys." One excep
tion, "Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely," is BSB's
newest single and was dedicated to one of their produc
ers, who had succumbed to cancer in the midst of finish
ing the album.
The most touching (or manipulative) moment of the
concert came when BSB invited five mother-daughter
pairs to the stage to play out "The Perfect Fan." I can
imagine how much the five girls looked up to their heroes,
and when each singer walked around the open pentago
nal stage ever so slowly, I think that moment will remain

emblazened at the top of their
short list of memories for quite
some time.
Another nice nod to the di
verse audience was the bilingual
"I'll Never Break Your Heart." I'd
heard this version during my sum
mer in Costa Rica.
I have never liked the sound
of concerts in closed arenas. I went
to a concert at the San Jose Arena
with Garbage and Alanis Moris
sette, and that time in particular
the acoustics sounded like a gar
bled roar because of the set design.
At least with the BSB concert, the
stage sat in the middle of the arena
floor, and everyone could see in.
The percussion and guitarists,
wisely used during a multitude of
costume changes, remained in the
middle of the pentagon, and sound
artists worked below while the
light crew sat up above.
After two tiring hours of
chaotic dancing, BSB left follow
ing one curtain call. Confetti sprin
kled around the stage and sur
rounding seats as the final song, "I
Want It That Way," closed.

Two opening bands were mainly there as filler for the
entire batch of crazed fans still waiting outside the arena.
EYC, or Express Yourself Clean, should have kept their
full name secret. Apparently, as my friend from Taiwan
told me, they're big overseas, but I've never heard of
them. The three teenage boys danced around and sang
mostly R&B and light rap, including partial covers to
"Where My Girls At?" and Eminem's hit single "My
Name Is."
The other opener featured a 15-year-old girl named
Mandy Moore, an unfortunate cross between Britney
Spears and Gwen Stefani, and four backup male dancers.
I'm just glad both opening acts lasted about 20 minutes
each, or else I would have had problems staying awake
the whole night.
But stay awake I did, in light of the energy exhibited by
the pop culture phenomenon, Backstreet Boys. I know
the parents in the audience bought into the whole concept
because they remembered their own fever for '60s groups
like the Beatles. I'm not comparing the two here, but for
the older folks, they can at least excuse their children's
often-psychotic behavior, whether it's for BSB, Ricky
Martin or 'N Sync.
BSB is here to stay, at least through this millennium.
And their fans want it that way.
