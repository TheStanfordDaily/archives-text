Will hip-hop artists harness the power of the Internet to
obtain more control over their music? /112 the past is any in
dication of the future, the answer has to be a strong yes.
Hip-hop artists have always bent existing technology to
shape their art form — including pulling out the wires
from lamp posts in the park and hooking them up to their
sound systems and digital sampling. Intermission caught
up with Chuck D after Public Enemy's show at the Mar
itime Hall in San Francisco to discuss the past, present and
future of hip-hop.

Intermission: How would you describe
hip-hop values?
Chuck D: You could either be positive,
negative or transparent. If you're just
doing a lot of transparent things, at least
then it would be for fun. But there's a lot
of things that have been attached to hip
hop— and I've been involved in hip
hop since '76— that don't necessarily
deserve that attachment. For example,
gun culture and jail culture are not hip
hop. They're just results of white su
premacy. Hip-hop is basically the ere-

ativity of a people spawning out of the creative environ
ment in which we live. You can reflect on some of those
things, but it doesn't become part of the culture just be
cause that's what everybody knows. We're going into the
next century and millenium, and people only know what
they're told. Black folks are religious to radio stations. If
it doesn't come through radio stations, and if it doesn't
come through the television stations most importantly
Black Entertainment Television; somebody called it
Black Entertainment Thieves—, black folk don't know
it. So that's just one of the reasons why we've tried to
place an emphasis and importance on the Internet, be
cause there's a lot of things being done in hip-hop. Eight
five to Eight-eight percent of it is being underexposed or
underserviced or unknown to the masses. And those are
some of the things we are working on.

I: You said you began in 1976. It's 1999 now, ap
proaching Y2K. What do you feel has allowed Public
Enemy and you to have that longevity?
CD: Using the whole world. Being able to go to six con
tinents and 41) countries. Most of the artists in the United
States have been taught and told and taken advantage of
at a young age to understand that there's only about
3,(XX) miles they can take advantage of, although you do
have exceptions to the rule when some people have gone
to Europe. But we as Public Enemy have paved many

roads. To be able to use the world is to pave the road for
hip-hop. Hip-hop's a world global culture: Asia, Aus
tralia, Africa, South America.
1: How often have you been to Africa?
CD: I 've been to Africa a few times. West Africa. You're
talking Ghana. And Nigeria. And you got Liberia.
I: What were the responses to you over there?
CD: The responses were big. The audiences were black.
"Yo! Go!" I mean, it's just like here. There's no differ
ence between an African audience and an Oakland or a
San Francisco audience, other than they're a little more
conscious of the fact that they understand that they're
African. Here, it's confusion whether we're American or
African-American or whatever the {***. So there, you'll

see somebody who looks just like you, and they can be an
architect but be in hip-hop, whereas there might be that
confusion here. And the stereotype usually is like some
body is trying to come up as an architect, they usually
look like suit-and-tie and things like that. It's a different
thing there. It's like wherever Public Enemy has gone in
the world, it's been some Michael Jackson shit. But
Americans have not known because America controls its
people by mass communication through the airwaves. So
if they don't hear a record on 106.1 FM KM EL, then
Public Enemy don't exist. And the masses of black peo-

pie here are controlled by white corpora
tions and white guys sitting around with
suits determining what should be
spanned out to the marketplace. Its not a
white-person-type thing. It's a mentality
that says, "We ain't letting you get what
you need, nigger, unless we tell you
what's cool." And that mentality has
been the same poison that has separated
people across the planet.
I: What was the Chuck D mentality com
ing into this new album, before recording

it?
CD: My mentality was to create a whole new way to con
tinue the exposure of the 85 percent of hip-hop that's not
being exposed. I began learning about the Internet as
early as '91 from Harry Allen. '94 from Harry Allen to
Dave Cook over there. In '95 I realized that there was
enough in-roads set up that we could probably enhance
the vehicles to expose the art. The problem was. there
was a waiting period. Knowing that you hit on a waiting
period, it didn't matter what your vehicle was like. You
had to build the roads for yourself to ride on and for oth
ers to follow. So, from '95 to '98 — other than taking my
kids to Brownies and school everyday — I was planning
for 1999. If you check out the 20th track of "Muse Sick In
Our Mess Age," Harry Allen's super-interactive-high
way phone call to Chuck D tells you exactly what we've

done this year. So, it's quite prophetic that there has
to be a new way for more art and more knowledge
to be learned for the masses. So we were waiting for
people out there to really catch up.
1: Public Enemy throughout the years has been ed
ucating in a different sort of way. What do you feel
is the relationship between hip-hop and education?
CD: Well, if you have a song, you should say some
thing. You can do three things with a song. You can
build and enlighten. You could be negative and take
down. Or you can be transparent and not say a
muthaf***kin' thing. That's acceptable, too. What 1
don't like is that the major corporations have un
dermined and co-opted young minds to think that
they can't do it any other way than what satisfies the
bottom line at the end of the day. And the bottom
line is the only thing that the music people are con
cerned about, because they're lawyers and accoun
tants. So they don't give a fuck about what the music

does or what it sounds
like. The only thing
they care about is the
bottom line. But the
bottom line is that
when you have no ac
countability to the
faces that belong to the
community that you
sell and promote and
package to, you have a
side effect. Side effects
that come out in the
Trench Coat Mafia. So
there has to be some
navigation by people
that live in the commu
nities that spawn the
same faces that are on
the packages that go
out across the world.

For the first time on the Internet, we are able to
touch the world without a middleman involved. The
music business or any other industry is always de
pendent on the public being naive as f*** and the
artist being naive as f***. So you have the artist and
the public both naive, and the art coming from the
artist to the public, but you've got to go through the
middlemen. The middlemen say, "Hey, you need
me. I'm important. You can't do s*** without me."
And they have emphasized their importance to such
a degree that nothing else counts unless it goes
through them. And it's so lopsided right now that
somebody might say, [Exaggerated speech] "Well,
you know what I'm saying, I ain't never really, you
know what I'm saying, really got it from a rap song
to, you know, knock the muthaf***a off." But real
ly, straight up and down, we're in a period where it's
a thin line between art and reality. And we're in a
situation where not only art imitates life, but life im
itates art — when you don't have control of your sit
uation.
So we're in a tentative situation where mind con
trol and robotic function by the masses is not stud
ied by the masses. These are studied by people who
understand subliminal seduction, communication
by broadcasting at a higher level; psychology. But if
you just say, [Exaggerated speech] "Aww, man,
f*** that. You know, that s*** ain't real, you know
what I'm saying? That s*** ain't real." And you
don't know that the only reason you knows*** is
because you're told about s***! So, broadcasting,
that's why it's controlled by the FCC — Federal
Communications Commission. And that's a gov
ernment type of thing. That's why most Americans
are taught that nothing else exists past the 2,(XX)-,
3,0(X)-mile cage that they live in. Americans are
world-dumb. We don't know anything that's going
on. If anything, people of color know what's going

on because we're descendants of people of color. Or
even immigrants that have moved here have a little
bit of the story of their immigration and family line.
Jewish people that have come here say, "Well, hey,
we got out of Poland before Hitler ransacked that
muthaf***a'!" You know what I'm saying? People
understand that. It's just that the W.A.S.P. way of
living in America is, "F*** all that! You're Ameri
can and nothing else counts." And that has terribly
blemished the existence of us as black people and
people of color.
I: How can Atomic Pop combat that?
CD: Atomic Pop is a company. Atomic Pop is a
company that 1 use as a record distributor to use
downloadable music. And 1 thought it was the best
combination of music business savvy and down
loadable technology that 1 thought could line up
with my philosophies.

I: I'm looking at the
artwork on the cover of
your new album. What
are you portraying in
this picture?
CD: I did it right on the
laptop. Actually, the
child in the middle is
the black child. It's ba
sically saying that we as
a race are unprepared
for the millenium.
Somebody's looking
out for everybody else
except for us. We're
not even looking out
for ourselves.
I: Why is the milleni
um the wall that sepa
rates people?

CD: Because there are talents and skills that you're
going to need in the next century just to be able to
survive. And if you just stick to the talents and skills
of the 1900s, they might not be applicable. And
you'll be outside looking in. So, you're going to
have to figure out what you can do to fit into the
template of the next century. And many of us in our
community, we respond to technology from a con
suming standpoint but not from a controlling stand
point. And we'll be definitely subservient to lower
positions. Even young kids are working computers
when they go to Burger King and touch that button
to get the order through, but it doesn't mean that
they're running the system. So that's where we're at.
•I: Why did you choose, "Do You Wanna Go Our
Way???" as the first single off of "There's a Poison
Coin On?"
CD: Because I love its weirdness. And perfor
mance-wise, it embodies what Public Enemy is
about. If people heard it, number one, they're like,
"What the f*** is that?" But once people see it,
they're like, "Okay, 1 get it." And as opposed to
picking something that makes people feel good,
we're going to pick something that will make people
understand that this is us.
I: You're not just asking, "Do You Wanna Go Our
Way???"
CD: Well, "Our Way" is talking about the new way
that we're trying to propose to people — that the
option is catching their music through the Internet.
I: You've expressed similar things on "Crayola."
Have you received any feedback from the industry?
CD: Yeah, right, they ain't going to talk to me. S***,
if you want to talk about cowards! [ Laughter] They
won't dare challenge me.
