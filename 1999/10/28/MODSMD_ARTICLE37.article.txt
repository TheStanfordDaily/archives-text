Will hip-hop artists harness the power of the Internet to
obtain more control over their music? /112 the past is any in
dication of the future, the answer has to be a strong yes.
Hip-hop artists have always bent existing technology to
shape their art form — including pulling out the wires
from lamp posts in the park and hooking them up to their
sound systems and digital sampling. Intermission caught
up with Chuck D after Public Enemy's show at the Mar
itime Hall in San Francisco to discuss the past, present and
future of hip-hop.

Intermission: How would you describe
hip-hop values?
Chuck D: You could either be positive,
negative or transparent. If you're just
doing a lot of transparent things, at least
then it would be for fun. But there's a lot
of things that have been attached to hip
hop— and I've been involved in hip
hop since '76— that don't necessarily
deserve that attachment. For example,
gun culture and jail culture are not hip
hop. They're just results of white su
premacy. Hip-hop is basically the ere-

ativity of a people spawning out of the creative environ
ment in which we live. You can reflect on some of those
things, but it doesn't become part of the culture just be
cause that's what everybody knows. We're going into the
next century and millenium, and people only know what
they're told. Black folks are religious to radio stations. If
it doesn't come through radio stations, and if it doesn't
come through the television stations most importantly
Black Entertainment Television; somebody called it
Black Entertainment Thieves—, black folk don't know
it. So that's just one of the reasons why we've tried to
place an emphasis and importance on the Internet, be
cause there's a lot of things being done in hip-hop. Eight
five to Eight-eight percent of it is being underexposed or
underserviced or unknown to the masses. And those are
some of the things we are working on.

I: You said you began in 1976. It's 1999 now, ap
proaching Y2K. What do you feel has allowed Public
Enemy and you to have that longevity?
CD: Using the whole world. Being able to go to six con
tinents and 41) countries. Most of the artists in the United
States have been taught and told and taken advantage of
at a young age to understand that there's only about
3,(XX) miles they can take advantage of, although you do
have exceptions to the rule when some people have gone
to Europe. But we as Public Enemy have paved many

roads. To be able to use the world is to pave the road for
hip-hop. Hip-hop's a world global culture: Asia, Aus
tralia, Africa, South America.
1: How often have you been to Africa?
CD: I 've been to Africa a few times. West Africa. You're
talking Ghana. And Nigeria. And you got Liberia.
I: What were the responses to you over there?
CD: The responses were big. The audiences were black.
"Yo! Go!" I mean, it's just like here. There's no differ
ence between an African audience and an Oakland or a
San Francisco audience, other than they're a little more
conscious of the fact that they understand that they're
African. Here, it's confusion whether we're American or
African-American or whatever the {***. So there, you'll

see somebody who looks just like you, and they can be an
architect but be in hip-hop, whereas there might be that
confusion here. And the stereotype usually is like some
body is trying to come up as an architect, they usually
look like suit-and-tie and things like that. It's a different
thing there. It's like wherever Public Enemy has gone in
the world, it's been some Michael Jackson shit. But
Americans have not known because America controls its
people by mass communication through the airwaves. So
if they don't hear a record on 106.1 FM KM EL, then
Public Enemy don't exist. And the masses of black peo-

pie here are controlled by white corpora
tions and white guys sitting around with
suits determining what should be
spanned out to the marketplace. Its not a
white-person-type thing. It's a mentality
that says, "We ain't letting you get what
you need, nigger, unless we tell you
what's cool." And that mentality has
been the same poison that has separated
people across the planet.
I: What was the Chuck D mentality com
ing into this new album, before recording

it?
CD: My mentality was to create a whole new way to con
tinue the exposure of the 85 percent of hip-hop that's not
being exposed. I began learning about the Internet as
early as '91 from Harry Allen. '94 from Harry Allen to
Dave Cook over there. In '95 I realized that there was
enough in-roads set up that we could probably enhance
the vehicles to expose the art. The problem was. there
was a waiting period. Knowing that you hit on a waiting
period, it didn't matter what your vehicle was like. You
had to build the roads for yourself to ride on and for oth
ers to follow. So, from '95 to '98 — other than taking my
kids to Brownies and school everyday — I was planning
for 1999. If you check out the 20th track of "Muse Sick In
Our Mess Age," Harry Allen's super-interactive-high
way phone call to Chuck D tells you exactly what we've
