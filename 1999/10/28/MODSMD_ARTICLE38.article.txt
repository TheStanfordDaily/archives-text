# TEARING THE ROOF OFF...
## Cover 
### 
Waiting for Public Enemy, one can feel the energy
and excitement in the air. Brothers from the (Fruit
of Islam stand alert and at attention, their eyes
scanning the venue. We're at the Maritime Hall in San Fran
cisco for Public Enemy's 4()th Tour.
The lights turn down and the hush falls over all those in at
tendance. Sirens are whaling in the background, and sudden
ly, the bass drops. Professor Griff and the Security of the Ist
World command the stage and display their acrobatic and
martial arts skills. Flavor Flav runs out on the stage wearing a
golden Viking hat and spits the phrase that has been heard in
nearly every corner of the globe: "Yeah, boyeeeee!" .
Chuck D begins the conversation with his audience by
claiming, "This is Public Enemy and I ain't afraid to say s***!
We love to come into your house Bay Area. This is the birth
place of the Black Panthers. Oakland in the Bay Area. They
say Oakland is known for pimpin' and ballin'. I say it's known
for the Black Panthers. After the Panthers, it's like this." And
in Chuck D's well-known tone, he adds, "Hip-hop is about
fixing that s*** and bringing it back together."
The group runs through their classics, "Can't Truss It,"
"911 Is a Joke," "I Got Game," "Public Enemy #1" and
"Give It Up." Juxtaposing the old with the new, they also per
form cuts from their new album, "There's a Poison Goin On,"
such as, "Crayola," "Crash," "Here I Go" and "First the
Sheep Next the Shepherd?"
The climax of the show comes from two strong jams back
to back, "Rebel Without a Pause" and "Fight the Power!"
Black, Latino, Asian and White fists pump through the air. It
is no doubt that Public Enemy's strong Nation-conscious
message has had universal appeal.
Flavor Flav takes control of the mic. A listen to "There's
A Poison Goin On" will tell you that Flav is a multi-dimen
sional artist. "41:19" is a solo track that references and re
sponds to the 41 shots that the NYPD fired at African immi
grant Amadou Diallo last summer. Flav shows the audience
that he can master the ceremonies as he performs a couple of
acapella verses from his new solo album entitled, "It's About
Time ..." Flav adds these words to his performance: "I want
us to build a wall of unity so strong that nobody can tear it
down!"
The intimacy between the audience and P.E. adds a spe
cial flavor to the show. Chuck often ran up to the front of the
stage and gave a round of hi-fives, while Flav and Professor
Griff held the mics out for the crowd to participate. The two
hour show concludes with the first single from the new album,
"Do You Wanna Go Our Way???" Chuck adds, "This new
album made history with the Internet. I want to make sure
that my community makes sure we get on technology before
technology gets on our a**! We didn't have no cell phones in
our community 12 years ago either."
