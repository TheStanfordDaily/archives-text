## Scorsese holds our attention with scenes of the 'Dead' 
### 
Martin Scorsese's latest New
York story is at times both
spellbinding and repulsive,
shifting from delicate sadness to jar
ring brutality in the blink of an eye. In
the end, like the lives of the night
shift ambulance drivers it depicts,
"Bringing Out the Dead" gets really
messy. But somehow throughout, it
just barely keeps hold of its sanity and
our attention as well.
Nicolas Cage stars as an insomni-

atic, hallu
cinating,
strained
to-the-
bone am
bulance
medic
ready to
crack at

any moment. Also featured are John
Goodman and Thinking-Man's-Ac
tion-Flick stalwart Tom Sizemore as
two of Cage's ambulance partners.
Actual wife Patricia Arquette
plays Cage's doomed love interest
and ex-junkie, while Ving Rhames

provides a hilarious turn as a gospel-spouting, hooker-spying, endlessly optimistic
co-driver. The scene where he and Cage "resurrect" an OD is "Bringing Out the
Dead" at its best: implausible, shocking, desperate and hilarious.
Working from a screenplay adapted by long-time Scorsese collaborator Paul

Schrader, "Bringing Out the Dead"
comes from all angles at every moment.
The plot, like the drivers, is at the mercy
of the almighty dispatch. A night begin
ning with helping a passed-out drunk
might end with a cardiac arrest, an at
tempted suicide or a gunshot victim, de
pending on chance and how cruel New
York feels like being to the medics.
The possibilities of the completely
unexpected are the film's strength as
well as its weakness. Though it is un
flinchingly honest in describing the in
jured, dismembered and nonsensical
lives of these men and women, these dis
parate elements make fora less than co
hesive whole. While always compelling,
"Bringing Out the Dead" never quite
achieves its potential.
As usual for Scorsese, the soundtrack
for "Bringing Out the Dead" remains
eclectic and interesting. But the mix of
rock and pop songs here doesn't serve
up quite the power and freshness of
"Goodfellas," or even "Casino."
Likewise, the scenery is oddly nostal
gic — we haven't seen New York
streets like this since "Taxi Driver" and

"Mean Streets." Listen for voice cameos from Queen Latifah and Scorsese.
To sum up: "Bringing Out the Dead" is worth your while.
