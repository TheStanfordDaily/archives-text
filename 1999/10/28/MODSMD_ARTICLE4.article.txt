# Scholars review impact of military coup in Pakistan
## 
### Nadira Hira Contributing writer 
Two experts spoke at Encina Hall yester
day on the recent political instability in Pak
istan, which came to a climax two weeks ago
when the Pakistani military overthrew Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Thomas Simons, consulting professor of
international history, and Sumit Ganguly,
visiting scholar at the Center for Internation
al Security and Cooperation, outlined the
Pakistani situation in a two-part lecture fol
lowed by a question-and-answer period.
Stanford University's Asia / Pacific Re
search Center and CISAC sponsored the
seminar, which was titled "The Pakistani
Coup: Causes and Consequences."
About 50 people attended the lecture, in
cluding Rajcndra Adhyankar, consul general
of India based at the Indian Consulate of San

Francisco, and several Stanford professors
with interests or specialties in South Asia.
Simons, who most recently served as U.S.
ambassador to Pakistan, opened the lecture
by outlining the events leading up to the
coup. He pointed out specific actions by
Sharif that aggravated the already tenuous
political situation in Pakistan and culminated
in this summer's Kargil crisis, the border con
flict between India and Pakistan.
"fSharif's) odd shambling regime could
have carried on through its full term —that is,
until 2002—if it hadn't been for Kargil and its
aftermath," said Simons.
"What makes Pakistan dangerous is not
politics... but the rudimentary and feudal
mode in which decisions are made."
Simons concluded with his belief that the
coup will change relations between India,
Pakistan and the rest of the world. "India
looks much better to the rest of the world

now because of Kargil and the coup. They
need to take advantage of that and, if they
do, Pakistan will have to follow suit," he said.
Ganguly, who teaches political science at
Hunter College, the City University of New
York and Columbia University, conducted
the second half of the lecture.
He began by saying that the Pakistanis de
served more credit for their planning in the
Kargil matter, despite their eventual with
drawal. "This should all be looked at as a
flowing stream in which Nawaz Sharif found
himself swimming, which eventually became
an eddy," he said.
Cianguly outlined the consequences of the
coup, beginning with the massive blow to
Indo-Pakistani relations. "The man whom
[India] will have to deal with is the man who
orchestrated Kargil," he said.
Ganguly stressed that the coup was only a
"short-term fix" to Pakistan's problems.

"The coup in no way addresses the funda
mental debility of every institution within
Pakistan."
Simons expanded on this idea of institu
tional decrepitude with respect to the mili
tary. "Pakistan's military is no bargain, but it
is the institution with the best sense of na
tion."
Neither speaker emphasized the recent
nuclear-testing controversy.
Consul General Adhvankar said he felt
the seminar was valuable, but focused too
much on Indo-Pakistani relations rather than
the implications of the coup itself.
"It's important to note that this coup is
Pakistan's search fora system of government
that will work for them."
Consulting Prof, at the Institute for Inter
national Studies Rafiq Dossani also said he
would have liked to hear more
about Pakistan and its future, but
he was pleased at the turnout.
"The lecture was one of the
best I've attended on South Asia
this year. . . . The size of the
turnout was pretty heartening for
supporters of South Asian studies
at Stanford," he said.
Assoc. Prof, of Political Sci
ence Scott Sagan, one of the co-di
rectors of CISAC, concurred.
"Stanford is making a concerted
effort to ensure that South Asian
economic and political issues re
ceive more attention on campus,"
he said.
"South Asia is a region of in
creasing international importance
and it is most appropriate that
Stanford is devoting more time
and effort in South Asian stud
ies."
