# 'Body Shots'
## 
### 
Twenty-something Trent (Ron Livingston,
"Swingers") lists the headlined attributes in his de
scription of a good blow job; they might also be
used to describe the fatal flaw of New Line Cinema's new
film, "Body Shots." No teeth, indeed.
'Hie film follows eight characters through the events

and repercussions of one
night of wild partying in
L.A., aiming to present the
audience with a gritty pic
ture of sex and dating in the
late 'y()s. Instead, it proves
that Hollywood-manufac
tured bodies cannot make
a social statement without

destroying its meaning in the process. This film deals with
drunkenness and date rape, and it wants you to be turned
on by them.
Body shots and Jello shots ... the frat-party mentality
pervades the first 45 minutes of the movie, in which we are
introduced to four women and four men, all entirely su
perficial. We get to know them by listening to their opin
ions on blow jobs and money.
Everybody lives for the vapid L.A. club scene: the
women wear too much makeup and too little clothing; the
men have the usual '90s-man neuroses, such as conflicting
inferiority complexes and egotism. And they all drink too
much. The movie might have redeemed itself as a light sex
comedy if it had followed their shallow exploits and let the
audience interpret their actions as social commentary.
Unfortunately, as the evening wears on, the violence
escalates with a bar fight and finally an ambiguous event
which may or may not have been date rape. It is definite
ly not healthy sex, since both of the characters are too
drunk to remember exactly what happened. Not that the
aodience knows this at first: their drunken blackouts are
supposed to shock, since both have previously invented
the events of the evening and have provided the audience
with a double shot of erotic recollection.
Meanwhile, the other characters have had their own

has
a

tongue,
lips

and hands...

but no teeth

little sexual dramas: parking lot quickies, S&M action
with a Cat Woman dominatrix ... oh, and a kiss that
slows down the pulsating club scene because it represents
L-O-V-E.
ITie film makes use of several grating cinematic tech
niques, such as altering speeds and super-imposing text

(a not-so-subtle "Swim at your own risk" flashes

on the screen during the club scene), but its fa-

vorite technique is breaking the fourth
i wall.

The characters address the
audience directly, providing what is

supposed to be insight into their per
sonalities. But their soliloquies are
just as empty as their actions: they

say things such as "Sex without
love equals violence" and "Some
times you just want to lose con
trol." Do not be fooled by the

' earnest talk; this film is about titilla
tion. Every message-oriented word

112 is subverted by the presence of erotic
bodies on the screen, a juxtaposition

without a hint of conscious irony.
The film's unwillingness to judge is

supposed to prove that it understands how com-

plex sexual relations are in the '90s, but its lack of un
derstanding is obvious in its inability to present any round
characters or thought-provoking insights. It is an R-rated
after-school special without an issue.
None of us needs to be told that date rape is a difficult
problem. The gum-smacking dialogue and drooling lack
of intelligence ought to keep any one away. "Body Shots"
is one of the worst movies I've seen this year, and it would
be offensive if anyone was actually going to see it. Fortu
. nately, it has the look of a straight-to-video film.
