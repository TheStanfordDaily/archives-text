# 'Bats' doesn't scare audiences at all
## 
### 
£ ■ ats" has been released just in time
for the Halloween weekend, and
JLr with any luck, it will be pulled
from theaters before it can disappoint too
many people wanting to see a scary flick.
The movie suffers from a poor plot, bland
actors and mediocre effects. Three strikes
and this film is out.
The dialogue is some of the worst 1 have
heard for quite some time. Nothing about it
is natural, interesting or funny. The movie's
length could have been cut in half if the char
acters didn't always repeat what the others
just said. If "Bats" had actually been scary,
the tired, redundant dialogue wouldn't have
been needed in the first place.
The characters try to convince the audi
ence how scary the situation is by repeating
over and over again that these bats are very
dangerous. The worst part is that the charac-

ters are stand
ing over the
half-devoured
body of the
bats' victim
while saying
this. It's funny
that the pro
ducers didn't

even find their visual effects strong enough
to stand on their own.
The entire plot is so loose that it all falls
apart somewhere in the first 30 minutes. The
basic premise of "Bats" is that two genetical
ly enhanced bats, courtesy of Lou Diamond
Phillips as a mad scientist, escape a govern

ment laboratory, infect at least another mil
lion bats with the virus and take up residence
in a small Texas town where they terrorize
the locals. The enhanced bats have an in
creased intelligence and hunt cooperatively
as omnivores.
After killing and eating their first human
victims, the bats seem to have decided that
human meat is not worth eating, yet killing
humans is so much fun that they can't get
enough of it. In the movie's most interesting
scene, the entire bat colony swoops down on
the town and starts attacking humans. By the
morning, half the town is wiped out, and the
Army is called in to contain the perilous
threat before it spreads to the rest of the
country.
But zoologists Sheila (Dina Meyer) and
Jimmy (Leon Robinson) are brought to the
poor town to help stop the bats. Some of
their lines — such as Jimmy's statement that
he likes bats best when they're at least an
arm's length away and sound asleep — made
me feel sorry for the screenwriters. The film
futilely tries to redeem itself with humor, but
the attempts fail miserably. Jimmy is Jar Jar
Binks multiplied by 10, his only function
being to overstate the obvious in a joking
manner.
"Bats" is neither scary nor fun to watch. If
it weren't for my obligation as a critic to stay
until the end of the movie, 1 would have left
this bat to flutter on its own long before its
welcomed end.

That plastic bat looks mighty scary.
