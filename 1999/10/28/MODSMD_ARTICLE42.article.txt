# Eye candy now at the San Jose IMAX
## IMAX/TV 
### 
IMAX movies are known
for emphasizing incredible
camerawork and visual ef
fects at the expense of just
about everything else, and the
new "Thrill Ride: The Science

of Fun" is no exception. It
takes this philosophy to the ex
treme; at times, the film seems
more like a stock footage festi
val than a history of thrill
rides. However, that being
said, the footage that is shown
is absolutely mind-blowing,
and the computer-generated
scenes are fantastic.

The IMAX format is designed to be
for movie theaters what Mercedes is for
cars. It uses a special kind of film that is
much larger than regular film, allowing
the picture quality to be much better
and sharper.
More importantly, some IMAX the
aters (including the one at the Tech)
have a curved screen so large that it cov
ers your entire visual field, which means
that when you are looking at the screen,
you see nothing but the screen. Finally,
the sound system would be better de
scribed as an arsenal. It has 44 speakers,
including a subwoofer the size of a
truck.
This highly immersive experience is a
perfect medium fora movie that show
cases roller coasters and other thrill
rides. The film begins with sequences
shot from the front seats of various
roller coasters. Although I realized I
wasn't actually moving, I found the ride

scenes surprisingly good. I could almost
feel the wind on my face while my brain
struggled to figure out if I really was
rocketing through the air upside down.
Next, the movie rapidly plunges

through a history of roller coasters from
their origins in the 1800s to the present
day, providing plenty of breathtaking
footage along the way. It also explores
how motion-simulator technology orig
inally used for training pilots later be
came used in simulator rides such as
Star Tours at Disney World.

However, the most exciting part of
the movie is the last few minutes, when
the process of making computer graph
ics and their use in motion-simulator
thrill rides are shown.

The highly immersive experience of the
IMAX is the perfect medium fora movie
that showcases ROLLERCOASTERS

Although full-length computer gen
erated movies have been in theaters
since "Toy Story" (1994), computer
graphics have not been extensively used
in IMAX before. However, the experi
ence of seeing a CG fantasy world
brought to life on the enveloping IMAX
screen is a giant leap forward. The total

sensory experience of IMAX
makes the digital on-screen en
vironment so convincing that
only my knowledge of the im
possible prevented me from
believing it was real.

The Tech Museum
201 S. Market St.
San Jose
Open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
(408)279-7150
http://www.thetech.org
$8.95 admission

Overall, the movie is quite a
wild trip for the eyes. You will
most likely leave the theater
somewhat dazed, squinting at
the mundane images of the
real world. Although you may
not come out an expert on
roller coaster design or com
puter animation, you will cer
tainly have a sense for the
amazing thrills that can be ere-

ated with them.
The Tech Museum, which contains the
theater, is a hands-on science museum
similar to the Exploratorium in San
Francisco. Although The Tech is now
nearly the same size as the Exploratori
um and has a stronger focus on comput
er technology, much of it is aimed at a
younger age group. The new Cyber-
Place exhibit, for example, is a souped
up Tresidder LaIR with Surf Watch,
which is quite a treat for young children
but less exciting for college students.
However, there are certainly enough
fascinating interactive exhibits and
things to learn to keep a group of Stan
ford students interested all day. So,
check out both the museum and "Thrill
Ride" for $15.95, specially discounted
from individual ticket prices.
