# NBC's 'West Wing' soars to the East Coast
## 
### 
NBC has scored with another powerful drama, "The West Wing." In the mold
of political films such as "Wag the Dog" and"The American President," most
of the attention is focused on the underpinnings of the White House. What
goes on behind the staged media presentations? Who are the people who run the
White House?
"The West Wing" has star power going for it. Martin Sheen, a television actor who

broke through with "Apocalypse Now," returns to the
small screen as President Josiah Bartlet. As a New
Hampshire Democrat, Josiah is proud of the first tax
surplus in decades (sound familiar?) and has anxiety
over sending his daughter, Zoey (guest star Elizabeth
Moss), to college (sound familiar?).
I can see why NBC might send Intermission a
copy of the episode entitled "Mr. Willis of Ohio," which
airs Nov. 3 at 9 p.m. There are two main thrusts for the

plot: No. 1: the First Daughter is threatened by a crazy intruder; No. 2: a social-studies
instructor casts a vote in the House for his recently departed wife.
With the breakdown of White House security, everyone is forced into the Oval Of
fice to listen to Josiah's trivia questions. Josiah, I suppose, has a thing for random facts,
and this personality trait quickly became grating on the nerves.
Meanwhile, the White House eagerly tries to sway the vote of a House committee.
A deciding vote may be cast by House newcomer, Mr. Willis of Ohio (where the

episode derives its name), on the fate of a census sampling amendment attached to an
appropriations bill v
Akin to other television dramas, action flips back and forth between the multitude
of main players. A story involving Chief of Staff Leo McGarry (John Spencer, "L.A.
Law") and his troubled marriage feels a bit contrived — but then again, this is my first
time with the series.
Deputy Communications Director Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe, "Austin Powers: The
Spy Who Shagged Me") has the task of taking out a group to a bar, the First Daughter
included. When three college guys start putting the moves on Zoey and talking smack
with the White House staff, the Secret Service is dispatched via a special remote and
promptly arrests the hooligans.
Details such as the Secret Service call or the logrolling associated with 7,(XX)-page
appropriations bills make the series work. I've always enjoyed smart political satires,
and here the dramatics are a bit heavier.
But there are some quirky moments too. Consider: When asked fora Constitution,
nobody has one on their desk, and someone even asks if it's still in print.
Opening and closing with an informal poker game with the President, this episode
of "The West Wing" makes sure the focus is properly on the inner-workings of the
White House and away from the trite themes of the all-encompassing media and scan
dal-ridden politicians.
