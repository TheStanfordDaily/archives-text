## Nothing in MODERATION IN THE 'MADERATI' 
### 
My roommate is shaking a whiskey flask in my
face as I attempt to write. It's 12:38 in the after
noon. This is what "The Maderati" is all about.
A bit of the arts, a bit of the bottle and a whole lot of
confusion only begin to describe this satire on a fairly in
cestuous group of New York City literary types. Play
wright Richard Greenberg's characters are not literati,
mind you, but maderati — crazy folk who fancy them
selves sophisticates.
But just as the maderati don't live up to the level their
social role commands, the writing doesn't have the bite
you'd expect from a comedy about young New Yorkers.
Our microscopic view into psychosis begins the morn-

ing after a rather unsuc
cessful party thrown by
Rena and Chuck De
butts. Rena's inability
to write more than two
paragraphs on the same
topic has prevented her
from achieving acclaim,

while Chuck's writer's block is perhaps the only thing sav
ing him from publishing another disappointing novel.
A phone call informs them that their "good friend"
Charlotte, an untalented ar.d suicidal poet, failed her grad
uate student psychiatric exam and is being held in a men
tal institution. Rena takes it upon herself to get Charlotte
out while informing Chuck that he must let all their close
pals know about Charlotte's unfortunate situation.
Chuck's incredibly painful hangover limits his mobility,
but he still manages to toss out witty one-liners while Rena
struts around squawking commands to him and notes to
herself.
Confusion takes over when Dewy and Ritt Overlander
are phoned about Charlotte. Dewy, a melodramatic pho
tographer and unfaithful wife, does not wait long enough

to learn that Charlotte has been committed. As soon as she
hears that something is wrong, she hangs up and assumes
that the girl must be dead, killed by a cab.
Hey, why not? This is New York. Ritt, the naive and com
pletely devoted cuckold, wants only to make Dewy realize
she is meant to be with him, not her lover Danton Young,
the alluring yet strangely inaudible actor with whom Char
lotte is in love.
Starting to sound like Shakespeare? Enter Keene, a
narcoleptic and horrible poet with the gift for neither sim
ile nor metaphor. He wants Charlotte to marry him but
can't seem to stay awake long enough to woo her.
Add to the mix Cuddles Molotov, one of Danton's bit
ter lovers, convinced that his interest in women as mere
sexual objects makes him a murderer. Naturally, Dewy
misconstrues Cuddles' meaning and decides that Danton
must be Charlotte's killer.
The characters run around from apartment to apart
ment try ing to seem heroic while making everyone else's
life a little more miserable. Though each admits to having
succumbed to the "overwhelming sickness of being alive,"
they ail continue to live and torture each other.

Cases in point: Charlotte fails to kill herself, Cuddles
fails to kill Dan ton, Ritt fails to make Dewy faithful for 100
days straight and the alcoholic publisher Martin Royale
fails to keep his homosexuality in the closet. Perhaps these
"gorilla socialites" should be placed in cages where they
don't have to be bothered with one another and can self
obsess until their natural deaths take them.
Though audience members showed delight during
both mentions of Hooch, that wonderful British alcoholic
beverage, a less engaging moment elicited a belch from a
patron sitting close to me (man or woman is anyone's
guess). But no performance is without these unexpected
instances of hilarity.
Joe Hudson, the understudy for Ritt, gave the best per
formance of the night and even threw in some ad lib. The
other actors tried to match his talent with volume and ex
aggeration, but his understated role stole the show.
"The Maderati" isn't the most original play you'll ever
see, but it is entertaining and might make you think twice
about moving to New York after graduation.
