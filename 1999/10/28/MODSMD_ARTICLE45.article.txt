# An unusual interpretation of the Jewish voice
## A 						Traveling Jewish Theatre wittily dramatizes Gluckel's diaries with a bizarre, unique twist 
### 
Performed inside the intimate Julia Morgan The
atre in Berkeley, "The Memoirs of Gluckel of
Hameln" proved a refreshing change from the
traditional plays of Shakespeare's era. Set in rural
Hameln of Germany, the story is about a Jewish moth
er of 12 children who struggles to keep her family afloat
in the face of death, debt and anti-Semitism.
The play is based on the actual diaries of Gluckel,
which expound on the daily events of a widowed busi-

mother. The is
sues of femi
nism, mother
hood and Jewish
life are explored
in the play

through quick moral stories, dreams and songs. Her
problems, however, are treated with an unusual juxta
position of morbidness and comedy.
For example, Gluckel's brood of children are pre
sented as two-dimensional puppets that perform a sim-

ple, comic skit about the murder of an employee. Gluckel

also dreams of a horrific, grotesquely unproportional
Martin Luther on walking stilts who kills a pig and
dances around with the pig on his head.
While the 17th-century costumes, klezmer music and
props prove charming, the story line lacks a working
continuity. The speech is often rushed, unintelligible or
spoken in Yiddish without understandable charade or
English translation.
Still, the play is memorable for its unique subject and
unusual visual images. "The Memoirs of Gluckel of
Hameln" was presented by A Traveling Jewish Theatre,
which is normally stationed in San Francisco. This com
pany provides experimental and original productions
that are open to new ideas and styles, so in the words of
Gluckel, "The best you can do is good enough."
Upcoming performances include "The Golden Bird,"
a holiday performance centered around the search fora
special bird to bring peace to the world (Dec. 2-19), and
"Kabbalah Tango," about a mystic in exile who encoun
ters an untraditional cast of characters, including the
feminine face of God (Jan. 6-23).
