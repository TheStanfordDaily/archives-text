## Tonguing Her to Ecstacy 
### Roxy Sass Staff writer 
Dear Roxy,
I'm a faithful reader and have consulted your articles
many times for tips, hints and tricks to help a guy get a girl
off Until recently, this has never been a problem. From the
ladies with whom I've been intimate, I've gotten large com
pliments and have reportedly "broken records."
My deal is this: I'm dating a girl who has never had an
orgasm. She says she doesn 't care and things are still good,
but I feel guilty that she gets me off and I can't help her out.
Is it possible that my girl really doesn 7 care whether or not
she climaxes? / get only positive feedback from her.
Thing is, / don t want to make my inability to get her to
climax to be an issue in our relationship because that would
be even worse. I would really enjoy letting my girlfriend ex
perience the joy of an orgasm. So for the first time I orally
stimulated what I believe to be a clitoris. I think I found the
bugger, but it wasn't what I had envisioned. Anyway, this
elicited the strongest reactions yet.
I love being with the girl. I think she's gorgeous and I tell
her so. How can I do a better job?

Dear Trying,
Imagine sex is a bowl of ice cream, and an orgasm is the
chocolate syrup, whipped cream, cherry and sprinkles. A
spectacular sundae, to be sure. Great toppings can even
mask the flavor of cheap ice cream. But if the ice cream is
premium, it's scrumptious alone.
Stanford students tend to be goal-oriented, and they
create goals in arenas where achievement shouldn't be
paramount. Take sex. One might assume that the orgasm
is the goal of sex. And if you value sex only for physical
pleasure, you're right. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am and
move along your merry way.
But if you're looking for something more transcen
dental, then the true joys of sex lie in exploring your part
ner's body, sharing physical pleasure and building trust.
And Trying, it sounds like you and your girlfriend are

discovering these finer qualities. Good for you. Don't lose
sight of what you have, but definitely search for more.
Even if you don't find your girlfriend's orgasm, you will
grow more intimate with her body, and both of your sex
lives will be richer — ice cream made of the finest ingre
dients.
Never make her feel inadequate for not achieving or
gasm. That's the most counterproductive thing you can
do. If she tries to orgasm or fears she won't, she never will.
Your job is to make her feel as good as she makes you
feel. And of course, an orgasm would be great. Here are
some tricks and techniques you might try in pursuit of
your girlfriend's first orgasm.
First of all, create a relaxing atmosphere. During or
gasm, a woman relinquishes control. You must create an
environment where your girlfriend is comfortable doing
so. Send the roommate out so she can make lots of noise.
Stilling sound could stifle her orgasm. Dim the lights to
block out visual distractions. Play soft music that she can't
sing to. Her world must consist of her body and the sensa
tions you create.
Start slowly in a remote area. Caress your way home,
lingering on other erogenous zones such as the breasts
and inner thighs, until she is throbbing with excitement.
Delay going in just a little longer than you think you
should.
The clitoris is the female sex organ. Finding it is very
important. Take a finger and gently massage from the
vagina forward. Near the beginning of her pubic bone,
you'll feel a small, hard cord. This is the clitoris. Its head is
near the front of the vulva, tucked like a pearl under a
hood of skin.
It is extremely sensitive, and most women prefer stim
ulation to the shaft, not the head. Every woman can han
dle a different amount of clitoral stimulation, and as she
becomes aroused, she can probably handle more. Watch
her carefully to make sure she's gasping in pleasure, not
pain.
When you go down on her, bear in mind that unless
you hurt her, everything you do will feel good, and most
things will feel great. To discover what pushes her over the
edge, experiment and communicate.

"Licking the Alphabet" is particularly effective. Sim
ply lick the alphabet on and around her clitoris. It works
by creating regular, rhythmic motions that vary enough to
remain interesting. Many women can't orgasm if the stim
ulation changes too much, but they become desensitized
to perfectly repealing patterns. The alphabet is merely a
long sequence of shapes that you can hopefully repeat
rather mindlessly.
Try other motions. With a soft tongue, lick from her
vagina to clitoris. Or flick the region with a hard tongue.
Roll your tongue into a tube and stroke her. As she nears
orgasm, she might be able to handle gentle sucking.
If you come up for air, tell her how beautiful she is.
Don't forget that your hands are free to caress the rest
of her body. If she wants, you can use your moist and
smoothly manicured fingers to simultaneously stimulate
her G-spot.
Relax and enjoy. Except in very rare cases, every
woman can orgasm. Sometimes she will, and sometimes
she won't. But the sex can be fabulous either way. Her
groans will tell you how.
