'Flu Graduate Student Council
entertained a number of guest
speakers, approved Nominations
Commission selections and granted
funding to two organizations at its
weekly meeting yesterday.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
spoke first, expressing his commit
ment to graduate student issues and
emphasizing the importance of the
GSC in helping to decide "how best
to serve graduate students."
Wais also introduced two new li
aisons to the C iSC: Tom Massey, stu
dent affairs officer in the Dean of
Students Office and Chris Griffith,
associate dean of graduate student
life. They will get input from the
GSC on how to spend $25,(XX) that
the Dean of Students Office pledged
to the Graduate Student Advisory
Board.
Griffith said that she and Massey
are both "excited to work with the
GSC... on its compelling issues."
Wais also announced three din
ner meetings that will take place
later in the year between graduate
students and Stanford University
President Gerhard Casper. These
meetings will allow graduate stu
dents the opportunity to express
their concerns directly to the Presi
dent.
John Taborn, a career counselor
for graduate student programs at
the Career Development Center,
discussed the services of the CDC.
Taborn voiced his concern that
graduate students are often un
aware of the Center's services for
them.
"1 wanted graduate students to
know that the CDC welcomes grad
uate students." said Taborn. "and
the best way to keep up with our ser
vices is to register at the CDC."
The council also approved fund
ing for the Stanford India Associa
tion and the Stanford Windsurfing
Club.
Speakers briefly addressed on
going difficulties with graduate stu
dent housing and health care. The
GSC concluded that graduate stu
dents' housing needs are well-repre
â€¢ rented in Stanford's Land Use Plan,
to be presented to the county on
Nov. 15.
Increasing costs of health care
also trouble graduate students, and
the GSC urged graduate students to
keep pushing for options to resolve
their health care issues.
The council also approved its
nominations for Nominations Com
mission, which selects Stanford stu
dents to sit on committees that cre
ate University policy.
Their selections were Paul
Hartke, an electrical engineering
graduate student; Michelle Cheng,
computer science; Amalia Miller,
economics; Sylvia Pieslak, sociolo
gy; Joshua Klein, a law student;
and Kwong Yung, a student in sta
tistics.
