## Gore and Bradley spar in presidential debate 
### 
HANOVER. N.I I (AP)
Pressed in campaign debate about
President Bill Clinton's personal
behavior. Vice President Al (lore
said yesterday night he shared the
public's disappointment and anger
during the Monica I ewinsks con
troversy and sought to provide "as
much continuity and stability" as
possible.
"He's my friend." Gore said of
the president, fielding the first
question from a voter in the first
debate with presidential campaign
rival Bill Bradley.
Bradley, too. was pressed on a
potential campaign softspot.

Gore's criticism of his Senate
retirement in 19% at a time when
Republicans had taken control of
C ongress.
" I he things I wanted to do I
couldn't do in the Senate." he said,
referring to stops at Stanford, in
the private sector and at Notre
Dame. In a gentle jab at (lore, who
has been in government continu
ously since 1976. Bradley said that
by leaving office, he had been able
to "encounter people where they
live their lives."
In a followup poke, he added.
"If you're going to do this, you
ought to deal with the big problems

and you ought to have big solutions
to big problems." Clinton often has
been criticized for advocating bite
size solutions to problems.
Gore and Bradley sat on stools
in a Dartmouth College auditori
um for the (>() minute debate, tele
vised by CNN. The first ballots of
the 2(100 primary campaign will be
cast in New Hampshire in Febru
ary. and the polls show Bradley
with a lead, having overcome
Gore's enormous early advantage.
Gore sought to take the offen
sive 15 minutes before the televi
sion cameras were switched on —
and again as the scheduled hour

was wrapping up. when he said he
would gladly remain to answer any
remaining questions.
Onstage for introductions, the
vice president turned to the audi
ence and said: "What do we do
now? ... Why don't you start ask
ing some question while we're
waiting."
Willi that, members of the audi
ence did.
The first question was about
bipartisanship, and both pledged to
work with Republicans and
Democrats.
Only a few moments into the
debate. Gore was asked about

Clinton.
"1 understand the disappoint
ment and anger that you feel
toward President Clinton and 1 felt
it myself." he replied. "People want
to move on and turn the page and
focus on the future and not the
past."
The vice president added: "1 le's
my triend. 1 took an oath under the
Constitution to serve my country
through thick and thin and 1 inter
preted that oath to mean that I
ought to try and provide ... as
much continuity and stability ... as
I possibly could."
Gore also noted there were

"some real hard lights" on eco
nomic and other issues at the time.
The two rivals pledged their
support to an overhaul of campaign
finance laws to reduce the role of
big money. And they agreed, in
general terms, about the need to
expand health care coverage.
On military involvement over
seas, Bradley advocated a United
States role — but not "full respon
sibility" — in multilateral groups
such as the United Nations and
NA TO. "There is no way we have
the resources or the wisdom to be
involved in all 32 ethnic wars in the
world."
