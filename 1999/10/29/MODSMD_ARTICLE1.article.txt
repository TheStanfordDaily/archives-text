Brian Goodell takes care of his
patients — hut he's not a doctor.
Even though the UCSF / Mount
Zion Medical Center emergency
room may close a month earlier than
originally planned, the interim chief
administrative officer foresees few
problems.
"This will have no negative effects
on our patients," Goodell said.
On Sept. 23. officials announced
the closing of Mount Zion Hospital,
which serves primarily lower-income
families in the Bay Area. Officials
filed a 90-day notice to the state
about the hospital's closing. Now. the
only problem is that the physicians
who work in the emergency room are
only contracted through Nov. 23.
"The hospital is closing on Dec.
23, as it is supposed to." Goodell said.
"But our physicians are contracted to
work for 60 days."
So. when the physicians' contracts
end in November. Goodell believes
his biggest hurdle will be to cover
work in the emergency room during
the holiday season.
"Getting physician coverage in
the emergency room will be chal
lenging." Goodell said. "We can't
guarantee anything past Nov. 23."
According to an Oct. 22 article in
the San Francisco ( hronicle. several
doctors have already informed Lau

rel Hodgson, director of the emer
gency department at Mount Zion,
that they won't return after Nov. 23.
Goodell recognizes this problem.
"We haven't given up yet." Good
ell said.
He said he will not use general
practitioners who aren't certified in
emergency medicine. However, if he
cannot find qualified doctors, Good
ell said he will appeal to the state to
close Mount Zion early for safety
reasons.
Plans are being made to transfer
all patients to the large Parnassus
I lospital Facility two miles away, but
some are still concerned. City offi
cials expressed concerns that Mount
Zion's closing will increase the bur
den on other city hospitals who care
for drunken party-goers on New
Year's. 1 iowever. Goodell said an ur
gent-care clinic will be set up before
the Thanksgiving holiday and will re
main to serve people throughout the
holiday season.
Officials also say that there's plen
ty of room at Parnassus I lospital, and
there will be no shortage of services if
Mount Zion closes early.
Hospital officials said Mount
Zion is being closed because it is
largely to blame for a $60-million
deficit UCSF-Stanford is experienc
ing. When Mount Zion is closed,
I JCSF-Stanford should save over $ 15
million each vear.
