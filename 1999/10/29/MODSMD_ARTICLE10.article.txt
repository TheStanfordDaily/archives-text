## Republican presidential hopefuls meet voters in N.H. 
### 
HANOVER. N.H. (AP) —
Republican rivals for the White
House warmed up for a campaign
debate Thursday night, with Sen.
John McCain trying to use the forum
for headway against the absent front
runner, Gov. George W. Bush.
While he is the closest challenger,
McCain said he doesn't discount the
rest of the field.
Publisher Steve Forbes, conserva
tive activist Gary Bauer, radio com
mentator Alan Keyes and Sen. Orrin
Hatch are getting single-digit ratings
in the New Hampshire public opin
ion polls. But McCain said he was,
too, not long ago. "I take them all
seriously," he said.

Still, Bush is the candidate to
catch. McCain is offering to accept
any and all debate invitations, and
seeking in this one to add to what he
describes as increasing traction for
the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary.
He said he is encouraged by the
polls that show him edging up,
behind Bush by margins of 12 to 16
percentage points, since Elizabeth
Dole dropped from the GOP con
test.
Two hours before the debate.
Bush was interviewed about his
absence on WMUR-TV, which was
televising the event along with CNN.
Appearing with his wife Laura. Bush
said he knows the forum is impor

tant, but that his family comes first
and it is more important to him to be
at Southern Methodist University in
Dallas, where she was being hon
ored.
"My family is important to me,
and 1 think the people of New
Hampshire will recognize that," he
said.
Bush said he'll campaign in New
Hampshire next week. "At every
stop 1 answer questions and lay out
my vision for America and it seems
to me that the people of New Hamp
shire accept my vision and want me
to be the nominee," he said.
"1 know I've got a lot of work to
do, I take nothing for granted." he

said.
Bush has agreed to participate in
the next GOP debate, in Manchester
on Dec. 2. "I'm looking forward to
participating," he said.
"It just underscores that one can
didate thinks he can play by his own
rules," Forbes said, campaigning at a
diner in Claremont.
This is the second time in a week
the Republicans have debated with
out Bush. There were no break
through moments and no sharp dis
putes in the debate last Friday.
Forbes, who is bankrolling his
own campaign, said Bush will suffer
for his absence now. "The people of
New Hampshire will say this just

doesn't wash," he said.
The New York limes reported
that Forbes has been selling shares in
the financial magazine that bears his
name to raise money for his presi
dential bid. Forbes said he is not
breaching campaign finance laws,
but would not disclose the price peo
ple are paying. Bauer demanded that
he do so.
McCain got a head start with a
stop in Hanover on Wednesday,
drawing a crowd at a news confer
ence in the lull before the first
Democratic debate, between Vice
President A 1 Gore and Bill Bradley.
"I will accept every invitation that
there is to debate, and I would hope

that Gov. Bush will change his strat
egy so that people can observe all of
us in candidate forums," the Arizona
senator said. He said New Hamp
shire voters expect and deserve it.
Bush had said he wouldn't partic
ipate until next year because people
are not yet paying attention to the
campaign. But with signs that might
backfire in New Hampshire, he
changed his mind and accepted the
December date.
Forbes scoffed at his explanation
for skipping this one.
Bush was in New Hampshire last
Friday, but left for a fund-raising
event in Vermont before the first of
the five-candidate debates.
