## Editor's Notebook Computer complications 
### 
Purchasing a new
machine is anything
but easy

During the times in my college
career when I haven't been editing
for The Daily, I've kept involved
with the paper by working as a computer
consultant. A big part of the job involves
researching emerging software and hard
ware and proposing new computer purchas
es.
Now, after having been in charge of
almost 4() computers running about 30
applications on a daily basis, I have realized
just how tough it is to buy computers these
days.
Last night the Daily Board of Directors
approved our proposal to buy some G4
Macintoshes for our photography and
graphics editors. l"he G4 processor has a
neat 128-bit pipeline that makes products
like Adobe Photoshop 5.5 run faster.
But did you know that unless you have
software specially made for the 128-bit tech
nology, Steve Jobs' much-heralded "super
computer" is no faster, and in some cases
slower, than Macintoshes with a G3 proces
sor? Our Business Manager spent an entire
day on the phone with the folks at Apple.
Adobe and Quark — going as far as talking
to the software developers — in order to
make an informed decision about new com
puters.
Meanwhile, we have a four-year-old
"dinosaur" of a Windows NT file server
that will need to be replaced next year. The
confusion in the PC world is even worse.
Should we get a machine with one of the
new Intel "Coppermine" chips, or should
we wait for the more powerful and suppos
edly more elegant 64-bit Intel "Itanium"
(they love that "-ium" suffix) processor?
Will the Itanium be appropriately priced,
supported and debugged by the time our
old file server chokes and dies?
So the fuzzies in the crowd are think
ing, "Who cares about Itanium? I'll just
get an iMac!" Okay, but will that be
Grape or Tangerine? Do you want a
plain iMac, or an iMac Special Edition,
with a DVD drive and a Fire Wire port

for digital video editing?
Home computer purchases can be even
more confusing than business purchases. I
put together a new PC over the summer,
and I was convinced that I'd gotten the best
bang for my rare-to-find buck — until I
found out that Intel slashed the price of my
processor by 40 percent the weekend after I
bought it. How's that for technological
progress?
New products are being forced down our
throats all the time, thanks to advertising
and word-of-mouth. Your family is a bunch
of losers unless you're connected to the
Internet with a DSL cable modem and
investing on-line. Your computer is a piece
of garbage unless it has a CD-writer and a
3D video card that can handle the game
"Quake III." And if you're worried about
your computer becoming obsolete, there
are companies with "subscription" methods
that get you a new computer every year.
So why am I taking this precious editori
al space to blab about computers? Well, in
a college environment that's becoming
increasingly dependent on computers and a
location in the world where technology
rushes along at a frantic pace, it's inevitable
that each of us will have to make, at least in
part, a decision involving a computer pur
chase over the next year.
We have to make good, informed deci
sions about buying computers, because the
employees of Fry's Electronics sure aren't
going to help us. And that's hard, because
the computer industry seems to have a very
frightening ideology: compete fiercely to
take advantage of as many consumers as
possible.
What can you do to make the process of
getting a new computer less painful? Well,
you can log on to my new Web site,
www.askrito.com, and my crack team of
spirited entrepreneurs will tell you what
computer to buy for a nominal fee.
Just kidding.
Actually, it wouldn't be such a bad idea
to organize a non-profit "High-tech Con
sumers Digest" to save everyone some
grief. For now, people with computer-con
sumer crises can send e-mail to
rito@cs.stanford.edu and await my slow
response.
