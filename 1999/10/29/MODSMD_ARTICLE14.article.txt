## And the truth shall set you free 
### 
Well, it's paper
writing time for
me. I enjoy it
when I actually get into a
paper. It gives me a feeling
of archetypal academia.
That is, a mind synthesiz
ing language and ideas

into some kernel of abstract truth (or at least
a nicely turned phrase), discovering the kind
of thought that makes you want to run out
into the rain and tell someone or (if you're
more patient) writing a six-page essay.
I'm taking a class on Foucault as a result
of a moderate interest in French philosophy
which I've developed over the past few
years. If you're like me, ever since you were
a kid you've had thoughts like, 'is reality
real?" and "What if other people don't
exist?"
All of the answers offered by philoso
phers from Plato through Descartes seem
correct to a point but overly simplified. Yet
in reading existentialism, I've had the feeling
that these guys are right on the money â€” the
feeling, "Then this is the answer," or some
thing close to approaching it.
So I feel that there is some truth to be
known in philosophy. This has led me to
purchase several books of Kierkegaard and
Kafka at used book stores and also to take
this Foucault class.
It's somewhat amazing to be in a room of
people, all of whom are concerned with
abstract ideas and with producing endless

discourse about them. In order for such a
discourse to exist, however, it appears that it
must be supported by a mildly intricate
social structure which designates certain
people as having a better understanding of
the truth.
Thus, in order to make a career of study
ing the truth, people are forced to concen
trate primarily on advancing in the social
structure, a task which seems mostly to
involve impressing other people with their
writing either by its originality or the depth
of understanding it displays. It is in this
structure of social discourse that the truth of
a discipline gains its only concreteness.
Sometimes, though, when I'm in class
and I hear some thought that seems so
deeply true about all human experience that
it feels almost spiritual. I think. "If this is
really true, shouldn't there be more to do
about it than talk?"
People, for example, study engineering
for a clear purpose. It teaches them how to
build bridges and make money. The truth is
justified by its application.
There is not, however, any similarly
practical application of philosophy. I can
understand why a person might pursue a
career in academia. It would be nice to
have people read things that you write and
respect you for them and tell you that you
making contributions to "the field." In this
case, though, the value of truth is derived
from the respect it gains for you from oth
ers.

I think, of course, that some philosophy
has value as art and is more beautiful (even
translated) than a large amount of litera
ture. This, however, raises the whole ques
tion of the value of art and whether it
requires an audience, which I don't want to
discuss. The point is that philosophy, unlike
art, claims to have value merely because it
is true, regardless of whether it is beautiful
or useful.
We are told by some (mostly philoso
phers) that man has a natural will to truth
and that truth derives its value originally
from this will. Nevertheless I often have the
feeling that even if I were to know the
essence of all existence, if it had no affect
my life, that knowledge would be relatively
worthless. Everything would be the same.
The universe would not instantly disappear
and be replaced by something even more
bizarrely inexplicable. I would not vanish
into Nirvana. I would not achieve anything.
This will to truth seems something like
the concept of pure love. It is a search for
some ideal essence that has no concrete
existence. And sometimes, 1 think, it really
would be much better to build bridges and
get married and leave it to others to argue
about the truth of your bridges and the
pureness of your love.
