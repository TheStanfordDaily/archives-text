Stop whining: Caltech really
deserves its ranking
I am just wondering how Govind Dan
dekar (or President Gerhard Casper)
would comment if Stanford was ranked
the "No. 1" school for undegraduates.
Would the No. 1 school's president and
students still be so upset by the "fat idiot"
(U.S. News and World Report)? Come on.
if you are really the best, why bother?
I am lucky to have had opportunities to
do research and teaching in two "No. 1"
schools: Caltech and Stanford.
When I was in Pasadena, I had never
heard of much complaint from undergrad
uates when Caltech was moved from No. 3
to No. 7 and then to No. 9, since everyone
is confident that Caltech is the best for the
brightest (not for the idiot).
When I read through U.S. News' crite

ria, I found that the declining ranking of
Caltech was due to one added factor:
graduation rate. If this factor were
removed, Caltech would have been No. 1
for many years, if not always.
Why the low graduation rate at Cal
tech? Only the brightest can survive there.
Students getting C's and D's (many of
them) at Caltech can easily get all A's
from any U.C. campus and perhaps all
A+'s at .Stanford when they transfer.
What really matters to the school are
three factors: quality of students, faculty
and supporting resources. From my per
sonal experience, Caltech deserves the
No. 1 ranking more than Stanford
[because of its strength in the sciences].
For those humanities and social science
majors 1 would not suggest Caltech to you
but probably Harvard or Yale, if you are
only into rankings. When I was applying to
graduate programs in chemical engineer

ing, there were only two schools in my
mind: Stanford and Caltech.

Mistaken perceptions
Thank you for your articles on the 15th
and 20th of October about Stanford Live
ly Arts' 30th anniversary season. Howev
er, I'd like to clarify a few points that
might be confusing to readers.
Contrary to what your articles appear
to state, our tickets are available to every
one. Prices range from $20 to $45 with dif
ferent discounts for Stanford students and
staff as well as non-Stanford students and
youths.
Stanford students receive 50 percent off
tickets all year long, with or without a sub
scription. In addition, students who

choose the six-plus subscription option
receive an additional 10 percent discount.
I am also quoted as saying, "We're just
here for the University." Though we are a
proud part of the University, our pro
grams were designed to bring events of
cultural interest to campus for the benefit
of the Stanford community and our neigh
boring communities. Our outreach pro
grams have been an important part of our
mission for over two decades.
And though much of our audience
comes from the University, many of our
supporters and audience members come
from off-campus. In its 30-year history.
Lively Arts has established itself as a pre
mier arts presenter for the entire Bay
Area.
