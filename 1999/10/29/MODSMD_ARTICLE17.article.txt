# From the Prison of Hope
## Om Kundu Three cheers to the Third Culture 
### 
Are you a fascinating fuzzie or
techie top-notcher? For the most
part, that urge to identify, to
brand vourselt into one or the other of
those stereotypes seems to have assumed
monstrous proportions on this campus.
And you're supposed to be making the
choice to be swimming with that tide every
moment.
Well, let's tace it. We love categorizing.
Be it passion or profession — super spe
cialization is the buzzword of the emerging
millennia. In fact. I am tempted to think
that Konrad Lorenz's observation that the
specialist "knows more and more about
less and less and ultimately knows every
thing about nothing" is true today like
never before.
You want to study mathematics? But
ol course you are willing to sacrifice your
passion for the humanities and even the
sciences and engineering. So you want to
research mathematical groups, all right.
But hey. make up your mind — you
couldn't be thinking of group theoretic
formulations of superstring theory and
quantum computers at the same time!

Talking about physics reminds me of an
analogy drawn by Richard Feynman. who
once noted the wringing truth in a poet's
remark that the whole universe is in a glass
of wine. Indeed, "if our small minds, for
some convenience, divide this glass of
wine, this Universe, into parts: physics,
biology, geology, astronomy, psychology
and so on. remember that Nature does not
know it! So let us put it all back together,
not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let
us give it one more final pleasure: drink it
and forget it all." Pity that these poets
always get away with the last laugh and
last sip.
Alas, it is quite an irony that history
seems to have evolved like the acts of a
romantic tragedy, heralding a society
where poets are dead. Even those who
have had the grave misfortune to stay alive
seemed to be regularly issued threats of
extinction by mainstream culture — an era
where saying Three Cheers to the
FuzTech notion of academic excellence
seems to be relegated as an improbable
dream, even at Stanford.
Why do 1 say so? It's just too many
times that I have seen my peers sell into

the wildly recirculated 'belief' that tunnel
vision can only come at the cost of periph
eral; the sole reason you should take a
class that does not count toward your
major is if. (and only if) it counts as a Uni
versity GER. No wonder intellectual revo
lutions don't happen much these days.
After all. even the Renaissance had to wait
for the fuztech folks like Leonardo da
Vinci to happen.
1 know some diehards still cannot resist
jeering, rather than cheering, about this
FuzTech deal — diluting intellectual rigor
with a fluid and exotic fusion of disciplines
to see the bigger picture. You'll probably
point me to some canons such as "Two
Cultures" by C.P. Snow to prove that the
split between fuzzies and techies has his
torically been an inherent, nay beneficial,
part of our culture. The more important
aspect that is often conveniently over
looked. however, is Snow's optimistic pre
diction of the emergence of a Third Cul
ture that would bridge the gap between
the literary and scientific communities.
And even 40 years later, with a few
notable exceptions here and there, we are
far from making that prediction come true.

Can we really claim to have evolved an
intersdiciplinary culture in the Farm given
that the Science and Engineering Quad,
divorced from the Main Quad, stands at
the opposite pole to the Humanities Cen
ter? Where some students are denied
entry to a lecture by Stephen Hawking
because they are not part of the depart
ment sponsoring the event? Or where the
Science, Technology and Society program
was threatened with possibilities of extinc
tion in the not-so-distant past and took
student demonstrations to be reinstated?
Our education in Stanford, as else
where, seems to be making us come to
grips with that inevitability that pervades
academia today. At every step that you
take in going through that circuitous grind
of high school, college or university doors
are being closed rather than opened.
Every academic choice that you make her
metically seals you from the others. The
roots of the techie-fuzzie lingo doesn't
seem far to trace. What you do, alas,
decides what you can't do as well.
The onus in deciding Stanford's orien
tation in the coming years, however, by
and large hinges collectively on us. Decide

whether Stanford should remain the liber
al arts and sciences institution it has been
or gradually metamorphose into a strati
fied pre-professional incorporation it is
seemingly becoming.
It doesn't take a lot a sacrifice to make
the first move in breaking the ice. All it
takes is an attitude. An attitude not to typ
ify students and academics according to
the populistic educational labels that
we've always loved to assign — a con
scious attitude that transforms into a con
certed effort to integrate rather than bifur
cate the resources that our Farm has and
could offer.
Isn't it high time we shattered the myth
and mentality of the ivy and ivory, stepped
outside our comfortable academic
enclaves and actually dared to look at the
world waiting to be discovered in all its
wholeness ?

takes is an attitude. An attitude not to typ
ify students and academics according to

scious attitude that transforms into a con
certed effort to integrate rather than bifur
cate the resources that our Farm has and
could offer.
Isn't it high time we shattered the myth
and mentality of the ivy and ivory, stepped
outside our comfortable academic
enclaves and actually dared to look at the
world waiting to be discovered in all its
wholeness ?
