# Fac Sen focuses on housing, grad jobs
## Faculty senate update 
### Juliana Liu Contributing writer 
The faculty housing shortage and
graduate student employment issues
dominated discussion at the Faculty
Senate yesterday.
The issues followed University
President Gerhard Casper's state
ment on the decision to dissolve the
UCSF-Stanford Hospitals merger
(Please see front-page story).
The faculty housing shortage was
an issue of concern. "We have a seri
ous housing problem." said Carolyn
Sargent, director of Faculty and Stall
I lousing. "Prices of on-campus hous
ing has increased tremendously; de
mand very much exceeds supply and
[there are] low vacancy rates."
According to the Faculty Hous
ing Report. Stanford is a residential
university and encourages its faculty
and staff to live on campus. Howev
er, the onset of rapid inflation in local
house prices in the late 19705, com
bined with double-digit interest
rates, severely reduced the availabil
ity of affordable housing.
The report said the cost of obtain
ing housing can be as much as two to
three times higher than in areas near
other universities.
"We want the decision (to come
to Stanford] to be made based on
academics reasons and not the cost
of buying a home," Chair of the
Provost's Committee on Faculty
I lousing Policy Lynn Orr said.
Orr said the shortage of housing
makes faculty recruitment and reten
tion difficult.
Philosophy Prof. John
Etchemendy suggested examining
the housing policies of New York
University and Columbia Universi
ty, schools in areas of high housing
demand.

Philosophy Assoc. Prof. Debra
Satz said NYU emeritus professors
are not allowed to continue living in
university-sponsored housing.
"This is a sensitive issue, and we
don't want to kick anybody out, but
there should be some incentives for
people to move," said Satz.
Several Senate members spoke in
disagreement.
"I think emeriti are people who
lifted this university from a mediocre
university to a great one, and asking
them to leave would be ungracious,"
Statistics Prof. Brad Efron said.
Another issue was the contro
versy over infill housing. Last April,
opposition from campus leasehold
ers caused University President
Gerhard Casper to delay the deci
sion on whether or not the Univer
sity will go ahead with plans to build
36 additional faculty housing units
on Stanford land.
"I worry that the 'not in my back
yard' objection will hold up building
of affordable housing," Business
School Prof. Joanne Martin said.
The Senate also discussed issues
brought up by the Annual Report of
the Committee on Graduate Studies.
The report indicated the ongoing
efforts on the part of departments to
provide employment statistics for
graduates about recent graduates'
experiences in degree completion
and employment.
Some members urged the provost
to track graduate employment more
extensively. Others, such as Linguis
tics Prof. Tom Wasow, disagreed.
"Knowing what jobs people go
into after finishing Ph.Ds is not im
portant," Wasow said. "To have real
ly effective tracking involves looking
five years ahead, and gathering that
information is extremely labor inten
sive."
