## Take the Farm Tour of Terror 
### Chris Crowell 
When you think of Stanford,
what images come to mind? Foot
ball games and frat parties?
Midterms and midnight study
breaks?
Maybe that's enough for some
of you.
But for the rest, for you who
dare discard your innocence and
lay waste your wholesome preten
sions, think again. Take a closer
look, and prepare to enter the dark
side.,.
Muweknia-Tah-Ruk House is
the first stop on the Stanford Ter
ror Tour.
Walk by late at night, and you're
bound to feel the chill. You see, my
friends, a ghost lives within.
Junior Patrick Lewis-Jose bears
witness to the supernatural.
"Some residents feel her pres
ence more than others, but most
have had some kind of contact.
She'll often pick a person to be

friend." he said.
The spirit, according to house
members, is the incarnation of a
Chi Omega sorority girl who hung
herself in the closet of room 317.
when Muwekma was the Chi
Omega house, well before it was
the Native American and Alaskan

Native theme dorm.
No current resi-

dents seem to know

much about the

girl or why she
committed sui
cide, but accord-

ing to senior Balaji

Srinivasan, many have

idols in their rooms

to fend off her

ghost.
"Th e

bath
rooms A

are scary at night," said freshman
Linda Orie. "Once I heard some-

one ca 11 -
l ing my

name a
couple

of inch e s

from my ear. 1
turned around

and there was no
one there. I often

have the eerie feel
ing of being
watched in the
shower."
But the ghost is
not malevolent,
said senior Shauna

Cruz.
"She just hates to be

alone. She's really active in the
summer and when people are mov
ing out of the house."
Next, we pay a visit to Universi
ty Archivist Margaret Kimball,
who has plenty of spooky stories to
tell.

"Jane Stanford used seances to
call back her son Leland Jr. from
the dead. She used apportes, or
slates, on which the writing of the
dead would appear."
Kimball also spoke about the
time when students snuck into the
Stanford Museum and put rem
nants of Leland Junior's last break
fast into a display case.
Or did they?
In truth, one should be surprised
when ghosts do not appear around
Stanford.
In the 18 C >()s Jane Stanford or
dered a fledgling cemetery re
moved from what is now the Ar
boretum because she did not want
people buried on University land.
Where did those spirits go?
What of all the other unfortunate
souls who have been murdered or
committed suicide on Stanford
grounds?
May the ghosts of Stanford past
and present be with you this Hal
loween.
