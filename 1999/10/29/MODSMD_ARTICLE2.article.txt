# UCSF-Stanford merger dissolves
## Casper says UCSF-Stanford failure symptom of greater problems for academic hospitals 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
The unraveling merger between
UCSF and Stanford Health Care fi
nally ended yesterday.
In what he named as one of the
most anguishing decisions of his
eight-year presidency. University
President Gerhard Casper called for
dissolving the merger.
The decision to end the merger
comes at the end of a tumultuous
two-year history for UCSF-Stanford.
The two merged in November 1997
with the goals of combating financial
pressures and improving clinical and
academic programs.
While the merger turned a modest
profit its first year, the organization
has already surpassed the predicted
$60-million loss for the 1999 fiscal
year.
Casper said the merger failed be
cause of external financial pressures
and failure to establish a new culture
within the new organization.
"In a situation of extreme scarcity,
the harder it is to get people to focus
on joint endeavors and not on their
sacrifices." Ultimately, Casper said,
"1 concluded that the issues were si)
complex and identification with the

home campus was so strong that the
merger was unachievable."
Costs of dissolution
Casper had no estimate of the cost
of dissolving the merger.
"As to the cost to unwind the
merger— 1 have no idea at this
point." he said. "What weighs heavily
on my mind are those costs that you
can't put money on—costs in human
energy and sapping of talent."
The merger's dissolution will not
be free. "You can't go back to 1997
[before the merger] with no cost. This
would not be a no-cost divorce." said
IJC Chancellor Dr. Lee Goldman, a
member of the UCSF-Stanford
board, in a September interview with
the San Francisco Chronicle
Regardless of the costs of disso
lution. Casper emphasized that
Stanford University would not bear
the burden of the merger's failure.
He emphasized that Stanford
I lealth Services is an independent
corporation from the University,
and the costs of the merger will be
born from its "not insubstantial" re
serves.
"Costs will be born from re
serves." Casper said. "Neither the
cost of merger or de-merger will be

born by Stanford University."
Internal failures
The merger had to end. Casper
said, because he feared that its con
tinued existence would continue to
drain energy and resources.
"The time devoted to sorting out
organization and management issues
has been extraordinary." Casper said
he feared the demand "would contin
ue unabated and drain off resources.
This is unacceptable."
Casper said another reason for the
merger's failure was the inability of
UCSF-Stanford to create a single or
ganizational culture.
"People needed to identify with
UCSF-Stanford Health Care," he
said. "This has not occurred."
"It is clear that with a merger of
people ... you cannot have one part
ner supplying the dominant culture
for the whole institution."
External pressures
In his letter to University of Cali
fornia President Richard Atkinson.
Casper said many of the reasons for
the merger's failure were "due to
forces beyond our immediate con
trol. forces that affect other academic

medical centers as well."
In his speech to the Faculty Sen
ate, Casper cited three main reasons
for the merger's failure: undereim
bursement by the state. Medicare
cuts and the managed care market.
In an e-mail circulated to students
on Thursday evening. Medical
School Dean Eugene Bauer con
firmed the main causes of the failure.
According to Berman, these caus
es are largely the result of changes in
federal funding. At the time of the ini
tial budget shortfall for the medical
center, medical center spokesman
Daniel Berman blamed the 1997
Federal Balanced Budget Amend
ment. As a result of the amendment,
government support of uninsured pa
tients and academic hospitals will be
phased out over the next six years.
The reduction in spending on
uninsured patients impacts UCSF-
Stanford because of the large number
of uninsured patients it treats.
HMOs in California also have
some of the lowest rates in the nation,
said Berman.
Casper hopes to see a change in
government policy in respect to acad
emic medical centers.
