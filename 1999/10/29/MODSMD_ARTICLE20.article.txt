# Screaming for attention in the Plaza: Where are limits of Farm free speech?
## 
### Sarah Heim Contributing writer 
Students walking through White
Plaza probably don't expect to hear
that they are going to hell if they
don't believe in the Ten Command
ments.
But that's exactly what they were
told by a bullhorn-wielding preach
er Monday afternoon.
"White Plaza is the designated
free speech area on the Stanford
campus. That man had every right
to be there," Assistant Director of
Student Activities Joey Greenwell
said about the preacher.
According to Stanford students,
it isn't unusual for someone to be
speaking about religion in White
Plaza.
"There is frequently someone in
White Plaza reading from the
Bible," senior Sarah Chandler said.
"Although this guy had a micro
phone."
Using a microphone was the only
University policy the man preaching
in White Plaza last Monday violat
ed, Greenwell said.
Amplified sound may only be
used in White Plaza by University
affiliates between noon and 1 p.m.
on weekdays.
The use of amplified sound must
also be pre-approved by the Office
of Student Activities,
"He was very cordial when we
went up to him and asked him to
stop using the amplified sound,"
Greenwell said, "but he didn't stop
talking."
Students who witnessed last
Monday's sermon or have heard
similar preachers in the past didn't
find the message so cordial.
"I thought he was a little insane,
and this wasn't the right place for it,"
sophomore Laura Dos Santos said.
"This is an environment where I
feel like 1 shouldn't have to deal
with this."
Sophomore Jillian Gemer. who
has been in White Plaza during sim
ilar incidents in the past, added, "I
feel like it's offensive w hen some re
ligious guy is trying to force his opin
ion on me at Stanford."
Despite the fact that students
found the preacher's message offen
sive. the University stands by its pol
icy on freedom of speech.
According to Assistant Dean of
Students and Director of Student
Activities Nanci Howe, Stanford,
like the majority of universities na
tionwide, maintains the right to reg
ulate time, place and manner of free
speech on campus.
"We have a commitment to free
speech at Stanford, and that is why
we dedicate a space on campus tor
free speech. While the campus is pri
vate land, it is open to the public."
Howe said. "White Plaza is an open
area and if you don't want to be
there, you can leave. That's why we
have a designated area. We want to
have open debate and expression of

ideas, and we want to preserve that
right."
Assuming the speaker is abiding
by the time, place and manner regu
lations and is not disturbing the
peace, which implies threatening
behavior or physical violence, there
are no grounds for removal.

This is an environment
where I feel like I shouldn't
have to deal with this.'
— Laura Dos Santos

"He wasn't threatening or fol
lowing anyone around, so he hadn't
crossed police regulations." Howe
said. "If he had shoved someone or
had become physically violent, the
University could have taken action.
But when we were out there, neither
of these things happened."
"I don't recall ever having any
one arrested in White Plaza," she
added.
While students understand the
importance of free speech, they also
believe in preserving a comfortable
and inviting university environ
ment.
"I have conflicting feelings. I feel
like free speech is an important part
of a university setting and a universi
ty is an important place for people to

he able to express their diverse be
liefs. On the other hand, the univer
sity is the students' home, and I feel
like it's important for students to
feel at home while they're here."
Chandler said.
Sophomore Erika Sotoagrees. "I
like the idea of having an open
forum, but believe that no student
should be attaeked at school — a
place where our comfort should be
more important than an outsider's
freedom of speech."
Although students were dis
turbed by what they heard last Mon
day. there were very few students
who called the ()ffiee of Student Ac
tivities or campus police to com
plain.
"Students may not know who to
call in these situations." 11 owe said.
During last week's incident, "two
students did call the police and we
called them back to explain the
philosophies and principles we're
trying to uphold." she said.
According to Chandler, only a
few students confronted the speaker
in White Plaza last week. The ma
jority chose to ignore him.
"I do notice a general apathy of
the student botlv about controversial
politics." she said. " I hat probably
had something to do with students
ignoring the guy in White Plaza."
"I think the student body should
be more involved in expressing what
they believe too," she added.
