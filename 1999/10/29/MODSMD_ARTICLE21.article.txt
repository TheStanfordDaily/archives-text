## Cutting-edge art 
### Kathy Vermazen 
I low does an afternoon of pump
kin carving sound?
For many Stanford students, it
sounds like something they did years
ago and wouldn't think of doing
now, especially during the middle of
midterms. However, the students of
Art 60 will be gathering at 1 p.m. this
Sunday to turn the traditional Hal
loween icon into artistic creations.
As junior Evan Meagher said.
"To make something really mean
ingful and thoughtful out of some
thing you did as a kid so you could
get candy,... that's just something
you don't get to do in Symbolic Sys
tems classes."
The class's current project is sim
ply to carve a pumpkin in a creative
way for Halloween. The projcct
seems to be a favorite among stu
dents. According to Meagher,
"something about making a pump
kin into a symbol for evil just really
inspired me."

His design plan is a "demonic
Mick Jagger pumpkin," eomplete
with quotations from John Milton's
"Paradise Lost." Art Department
Prof. Matthew Kahn said the end re
sult will be 50 to 75 jaek-o'lanterns
"of very unusual and inventive
form."
The class involves a variety of
projects for students to learn about
expression and design in a variety of
mediums, even oversized gourds.
Projects include fabric hangings,
metal sculptures, dance and perfor
mance art.
As senior Kathryn Chinn said,
the projects try "to get past symbolic
forms of expression. We are sup
posed to simply use the materials to
get across emotion."
The pumpkins will be displayed
at Kahn's home at 834 Santa Fc Ave.
Kahn said they will be completed
Sunday afternoon and "ready for
the little ones who come around
trick-or-treating and experience this
extravaganza
