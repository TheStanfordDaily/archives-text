# Residents enjoy life in Draw surprises
## 
### Katie Leonberger Contributing writer 
Halfway into the quarter, resi
dents of three unusually popular
houses in last year's Draw have had a
chance to evaluate their housing
choice. Great food and community
atmosphere — along with renovation
and cleaning — have left new resi
dents satisfied with their picks.
Lambda Nu. located on Lake La
gunita, boasted unusually low cutoff
numbers last spring. 680 I.omita
Drive, (formerly the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity house), was also a popular
choice for students in its first year in
the Draw. Narnia, another lakeside
house, also witnessed much lower
cutoff numbers than'usual.
"A lot of the Lake houses drew
higher than in past years because
they were renovated." explained Jes
sica Engelson. the Office Coordina
tor at Housing Assignment Services.
"Whenever the undergrad houses
undergo [Capital Improvement Pro
gram]. there is a surge to those hous
es."
Engelson added thai this sort of
shift from traditionally popular hous
es to houses that are newly reno\ ated
has been occurring since CIP began
nine years ago. "Some houses are
popular one year, and not the next
year." Engelson said.
Mike Rollin. a junior spending his
second year at Lambda Nu. is also
the house manager. Rollin says of the
53-member house. 'I love it because
it's a very tight-knit community made
up of'different kinds of people. We're
all laid back and want to get along."
There was a worry in 1 .amlxla Nu
that the "personality" of the house
would change as a result of CI P. the
elimination of prioritv draw, and the
change from student to I 'nivers'tv
cleaning. But residents do not feel
that the house is that different.
Admittedly, some current resi-
Joanna Hiatt Daily

dents such as senior Trevor Loft
house "just came here for the nice
house... . There are definitely people
here who would not have lived here
before. But it adds to the character of
the house."
Johnnie Manzari, Lambda Nu's
computer manager, added, "|Lamba
Nli| is a twist to get away from tradi
tional housing assignments to houses
with some sort of culture to them."
"I like the people [Lambda Nu]
draws. People are more accepting,
and they all have to be pretty laid
back. We spend a lot of money on the
social budget."
Members ot all the newly populai
houses highlight good food, location
and fellow residents as main reasons
for choosing their residences this
year.
Sophomore drawmates Andres
Suster and Sim an I ekwani are resi
dents in 6KO Lorn it a. When asked
what their expectations ol the house
were as they moved in. Suster an
swered. "It's a nice house with a fun
reputation."
And now? "It's a very social envi
ronment." says Suster. "There's lots
of play space." adds Tekwani. Fellow
680 I omita resident Alexis Oakland
adds that she enjoys living in two
room doubles and not having to walk
too far to get to parties.

Another house that drew surpris
ingly well in last spring's Draw was
Narnia. a self-op sitting on the back
of the Lake at 353 Campus Drive.
Again, food and atmosphere are
stressed by the residents of this
house.
Andrea Wendt is a junior who had
a draw number of 256 last spring.
Wendt admits that she and her Draw
group had actually wanted to live in
Xanadu. 680 Lomita, Lambda Nu or
Suites. But at the same time, she is
happy with her house this year.
Among the positive characteris
tics of Narnia are its location on the
lake, good food, the newly-finished
renovation and the big two-room
doubles. "I've never had my own
room. I wanted my own room," said
Wendt.
The only drawback of Narnia
seems to be its distance from campus.
But apparently that is a small price to
pay when residents are pleased with
everything else.
According to 1 lousing Assign
ment Services, the change in cutoff
numbers will continue as CIP moves
from residence to residence.
In the meantime, residents of
Lambda Nu. Narnia and 680 Lomita
all seem to concur with Manzari
when he says."I wouldn't want to live
anywhere else."
