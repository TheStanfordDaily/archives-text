## Card visits UW in crucial matchup

Last week against USC, Stanford
coach Tyrone Willingham boldly
predicted that the first seven min

By the end of the game, Stanford

Another game, another question

Before the kickoff every Satur
day, Stanford players, coaches and
fans all undergo the same bewilder
ing self-evaluation. What do we
have? How can we use it?
Even the experts can't figure out
the Cardinal (5-2, 5-0 Pacific 10
Conference). The pieces — shoddy
defense, streaky offense and blind
luck — somehow add up to an un
defeated league record and a shock

Rose Bowl berth since 1 Some
how the Cardinal has gotten into the
driver's seat in the conference and
stayed there.
But tomorrow's game at Wash
ington (4-3, 3-1) represents the
team's biggest test all season. The
Cardinal needs answers quick if it
hopes to win at Husky Stadium for
the first time since 1^75.
"Arizona and USC are nothing

Johnson. "There's no feeling like
walking out of that tunnel and see

Actually, it's 72.500 people
and they are arguably the most
rabid fans in the Pac-10.
A win in Washington coupled
with an Arizona State loss would
make it the biggest win of the season
for the team. It would mean that the
Cardinal would clinch at least a lie

Principal among the Cardinal's

Stanford will need to evade the Husky defense, if the Cardinal hopes to keep its Pacific 10 Conference
record unblemished.
