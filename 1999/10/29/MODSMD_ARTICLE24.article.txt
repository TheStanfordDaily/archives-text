# No. 2 Cardinal heads up North
## 
### Ellie Ritch Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team (17-2. 9-1 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) gave the national polls quite a
jolt this week, leaping five spots from
No. 7 to No. 2. The vault in the Car
dinal ranking can be attributed to the
three wins Stanford posted in seven
days last week, including two non
conference victories against No. 3
Pacific and No. 2 I lawaii.
Despite its national dominance,

the Stanford squad still trails No. 7
UCLA (19-1. 11-0) in the Pac-10
after the Bruins downed the Cardi
nal earlier this year.
Stanford has the opportunity to
keep pace with UCLA again this
weekend, as it travels to Oregon to
face two Pac-10 opponents. The
women's squad will match up against
Oregon (6-14. 0-11) and Oregon
State (<N-11.2-9) today and Sunday.
Earlier this month, Stanford put
away both Oregonian teams in three
straight games. The Cardinal defeat-

Ed Oregon with a smooth 15-1. 15-1,
15-5 match and continued its on
slaught 24 hours later, with a 15-11,
15-11, 15-5 victory over the Beavers.
Stanford noted its success in run
ning middle plays and pushing its de
fenders to the outside after its meet
ing against the Beavers. It will be
hard for both Oregon teams to keep
pace with the Cardinal's speed.
Stanford's record against both
teams is incredible. It has yet to lose
a match to Oregon State, and is 29-2
all-time against Oregon.

The Oregon Ducks are currently
amidst a 14 game losing streak,
which ties the school record. The
Beavers are also looking a bit lethar
gic. as they have lost seven of their
last eight competitions.
Stanford freshman outside hitter
Logan I'om posted an outstanding
career-high of 2(i kills in her last
game against the Beavers. Oregon
State will look for help from senior
outside hitter Sarah Bjeldanes in an
effort to challenge the Cardinal's
power.
Tom has continued to live up to
all the press that surrounds her. She
was named the AVCA / Sports Im
ports Division I Player of the Week
last week in honor of her consistent
ly strong efforts. Tom racked up 21
kills and 17 digs versus Pacific, and
posted 14 kills along with 14 digs
against I lawaii.
The new addition has indeed
proven powerful, as Tom ranks in
the top of the Pac-10 in four cate
gories and ranks No. IS in the coun
try in total kills.
Junior setter Lindsay Kagawa is
also among the country's top 20 in
assists with 13.24 assists-per-game.

is on the brink of her fourth All-
America selection. A berth on this

four years in a row. Walsh looks to
join Stanford alum Bev Oden in this
rare honor.
Despite chronic shoulder prob
lems, Walsh has tallied a lofty 1.387
kills thus far in her career. Walsh
currently leads the Cardinal squad
in digs, averaging 3.4 per game.

Walsh has been a major force to
reckon with in her past four seasons
at Stanford. She has lead the team to
two National Championships as well
as three Pac-10 crowns. Walsh also
holds prestigious titles such as the
1998 Pac-10 Player of the Year and
the 1996 NCAA Freshman of the
Year.
The Cardinal must maintain its
favorable record over Oregon teams
this weekend in order to keep pace
in the Pac-10 chase against UCLA.
