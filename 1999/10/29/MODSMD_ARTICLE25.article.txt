"We've spent a lot of time com
peting against each other in prac
tice." said junior co-captain
Stephanie Cowles, but this will be
the team's first opportunity to com
pete against other teams.
Saturday's regatta will give team
members a good chance to take the
skills they've been working on six
days a week in practice and use them
in a racing environment.
According to head coach Aimee
Baker, of the teams competing at the
regatta. Sacramento State should
provide the best competition. The
Sacramento State team just returned
from racing last weekend at the
1 lead of the Charles, a major regatta
in Boston.
"Rowing against teams that have
already competed at the next level is
a good gauge for what lo expect this
spring," Baker said.
The official competitive crew sea
son does not begin until the spring.
Although fall races offer good expe
rience and training for rowers, the
major emphasis is on competing in
races in the spring.

"There is not a huge competitive
focus for us on this race," Baker said.
"It's mainly just to gain experience."
"We're going out there to see
what we're capable of," Cowles said.
"We don't have big expectations. It's
more a chance to see where we are in
terms of training."
There will be three Stanford
boats racing in Saturday's regatta,
one four-person boat and two eight
person ones. According to Baker,
the two eights will have a mixed se
lection of rowers.
"We are mixing boats so that the
older and more experienced rowers
are spread out," she said. "This
means we may not have all the
fastest rowers in one boat, but it
gives good experience to everyone
involved.
"The team has been rowing S,(XX)
meters every Saturday, so the dis
tance of this weekend's three-mile
course won't be anything new for
them," Baker said.
Although some of the more expe
rienced team members are familiar
with the last 2,(XX) meters of the
course — where the annual Pacific
10 Conference Championships are
held — the majority of the team is
still very young.
In fact, the four-person boat con
sists of all sophomores and a fresh
man coxswain. The younger, less ex
perienced rowers were particularly
"fired up to get out there and race,"
Baker said.
This year's team has an "exciting,
fresh feeling," Cowles said. "I love
the enthusiasm.
"No one really knows what to ex
pect this season," she added. "We'll
keep them guessing the next couple
of weeks."
