## Men battle Cal in critcial test as MPSF race heats up 
### Meghan O'Connor Staff writer 
Six seniors who may be facing
their last home game, two teams
looking for NCAA tournament bids
and one heated rivalry should add up

to an exciting game tomorrow night
as the Stanford men's soccer team (9-
3-2, 4-1-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) hosts No. 23 California
(11-3-2.3-2-1).
Under Stanford head coach
Bobby Clark, the matchup with Cal

has always been a challenging one.
Two seasons ago, Stanford fell to Cal
only to come back last year and get
revenge in the MPSF Northern
Championship. Last year the teams
battled to a scoreless tie.
On Saturday, Stanford, the cur
rent leader in the mountain division
of the MPSF. hopes to get the edge
on its rivalry with fourth-place Cal.

â–  Tomorrow: Stanford (9-3-2, 4-1-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
vs. No. 23 California (11-3-2,3-2-1).
7:30 p.m.. New Maloney Field.

"From both perspectives this is a
key game in making the tournament,
you can't camouflage that," Clark
said. "Cal is having a very good sea
son. but there's no question in my
mind that if we play our game, we're
a much better team."
And in order for Stanford to play
its game, the men will have to block
out the stress of securing bragging
rights and an NCAA bid and focus
on the task at hand.
