## Men battle Cal in critcial test as MPSF race heats up 
### Meghan O'Connor Staff writer 
Six seniors who may be facing
their last home game, two teams
looking for NCAA tournament bids
and one heated rivalry should add up

to an exciting game tomorrow night
as the Stanford men's soccer team (9-
3-2, 4-1-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) hosts No. 23 California
(11-3-2.3-2-1).
Under Stanford head coach
Bobby Clark, the matchup with Cal

has always been a challenging one.
Two seasons ago, Stanford fell to Cal
only to come back last year and get
revenge in the MPSF Northern
Championship. Last year the teams
battled to a scoreless tie.
On Saturday, Stanford, the cur
rent leader in the mountain division
of the MPSF. hopes to get the edge
on its rivalry with fourth-place Cal.

MEW'S SOCCER
â–  Tomorrow: Stanford (9-3-2, 4-1-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
vs. No. 23 California (11-3-2,3-2-1).
7:30 p.m.. New Maloney Field.

"From both perspectives this is a
key game in making the tournament,
you can't camouflage that," Clark
said. "Cal is having a very good sea
son. but there's no question in my
mind that if we play our game, we're
a much better team."
And in order for Stanford to play
its game, the men will have to block
out the stress of securing bragging
rights and an NCAA bid and focus
on the task at hand.

On Saturday Stanford will look to vanquish the Golden Bears as Cal
ifornia takes on the Cardinal at New Maloney Field. The talents of ju
nior forward Luke Rust will be called upon, as will the talent of the
whole team, if the Cardinal hope to win.
"It's a huge game, but it's not a
game that we can put 100 much pres
sure on ourselves because as a whole
we've been plav ing well." said senior
defender Andv Hemmerich. "We
have to look at it as another big game
anil come out the same as we would
for any other game."
Cal. which has been consistently
ranked in the national poles this sea
son. poses a threat to Stanford's posi
tion at the lop of the Mountain Divi
sion.
" There is no doubt that Cal has
tremendously talented players." se
nior goalkeeper Adam Zapala said.
"()n any given day they can be one of
the best teams in the country."
Behind C als success is a core of a
strong senior-laden squad, starting as
many as nine seniors. Defensively,
Cal boasts the No. I goalie in the

Mountain I )i\ ision of the MI'SI . Se
nior keeper Doug Brooks has led the
team lo an impressive eight shutouts
and lias achieved a .5K goals-against
average. Zapala sits two spots behind
Brooks in the MI'SI standings with a
comparable si\ shutouts and a . l W
gi nils-against-average.
On the attack. Stanford will have
to be wary of junior forward Kendall
Simmonds. who leads the Mountain
Division of the MI'SI in assists with
seven, placing him si\ih m the Cal
record books with 15 career assists.
Junior forward Corev Wool folk of
Stanford is just behind Simmonds in
the MI'SI with six
Simmonds' 13 points this season,
including three game-winning goals,
is good enough for second on the
team behind junior midfielder
Ramiro Arrendondo. Arrendondo's
15 points, including seven goals, tie
him with Stanford's junior forward
I like Rust for fourth in the division
standings.

I lie strong team that Cal has put
together so far this season has result
ed in such notable wins as a 1-0 dou
ble-overtime victory against San
Francisco, a team that downed Stan
foal 3-1 earlier this season.
In the MPSF. however. Cal has
struggled with Denver, bowing 1-0.
and with No. I 1 ) Washington, which
beat the Bears. 2-1. in overtime. Stan
ford also fell to the I luskies. 1-0. but
blew out Denver 5-2 earlier this
month.
" I lie most important thing for us
is to first, stop Cal from playing,
meaning we have got to pressuri/.e
them all over the field in order to sti
fle their attacks and frustrate them."
/apala said. " I think in the end if we
can do this, people will truly begin to
see our qualities in the way that we
can play, attack and get in behind
teams."
Qualities that will be important to
showcase as the NCAA tournament
bids will be announced on Nov. 14.
