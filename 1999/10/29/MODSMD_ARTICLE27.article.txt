### Erin Bouchier Staff writer 
With only four weeks until the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation tournament, the pressure won't let up for the
No. I Stanford men's water polo team. Just a week after
beating then-No. I IJSC and No. 4 Long Beach State in
Southern California, the Cardinal returns home to host
No. 7 Pepperdine and the now-No. 3 Trojans.

MEN S WATER POLO
■ Tomorrow: No. I Stanford (14-2,4-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) vs. No. 7 Pepperdine (7-8,2-2). 12 p.m..
deCiuerre Pool.
■ Siiikl.in: Stanford vs. No. 3 IJSC (15-2. 3-1). 12 p.m.,
deC iuerre Pool.

Stanford will give itself <i dose of self-applied pressure
as the squad tries to distance itself from the other national
leaders. I JCI A and t JSC. which, like the Cardinal, have
only two losses on the season.
"(This weekend's game is| an ideal chance to give USC
three losses, putting them behind us in terms of overall
record." said Stanford coach Dante Dettamanti.
Against the Trojans (15-2. 3-1 MPSF) on Sunday, the

Cardinal (14-2.4-1) hopes to buck the current trend of los
ing to I !SC at home. The teams have met three times pre
viously this season, with each team winning in the oppos
ing team's pool. Stanford won the first game in overtime
of the final of the SoCal Tournament, while USC took the
second, also in overtime, in the NorCal Tournament semi
final. Last weekend in Los Angeles, the Cardinal over
came the Trojans 5-3.
To beat the revenge-seeking Trojans, Stanford will use
a slightly modified version of the press defense that shut
down USC s scoring last week. The defense will focus on
stifling Trojan senior Allen Basso, who leads the MPSF in
scoring with 2.24 points per game.
The Cardinal will also attempt to shut down senior
holeman James Castle. Last weekend. Castle was held
scoreless thanks to the strong defense of senior John
Skaalen.
Stanford's last line of defense is redshirt freshman
goalie Nick Ellis. For his 14 saves last weekend. Ellis was
named MPSF Player of the Week for the second time this
season. Ellis is averaging 9.4 saves per game while allow
ing only 5.79 points.
"We need to improve front court offense and our 6-on
5. We see USC weaknesses that we can exploit in these
areas." IXMtamanti said.
Main different Cardinal players
can he called on to score. Senior
Brian I Icifleron leads the team with
25 points. I iuht different players
have It) points or more on the season
and look to improve these numbers

against the Trojans.
While the weekend's marquee
matchup is the I JSC game, the C ordi
nal must be careful not to overlook
tomorrow's match with No. 7 Pep
pcrdine (7-8. 2-2). Unlike the game
against the Trojans, tomorrow's
game will count toward MPSF stand
ings.
This will be the first meeting this
season between the Cardinal and the

Waves. "We haven't really seen too
much of them or know too much
about them." Dettamanti said.
I lowever. the Cardinal does know
that the Waves, like any other confer
ence team, is capable of beating the
Cardinal on any given afternoon.
Pepperdine recently proved itself ca
pable of an upset, beating the No. h
Univeristy of the Pacific by the lop
sided score of 10-4.
