### Lori Maund Contributing Writer 
In the first gnal of last Sunday's
IJSC game, senior forward Kelly
Adamson streaked across the field to
redirect the hall off of her head on a
throw-in from the sideline. Although
she misdirected her header. Adam
son didn't give up. but instead fought
back to win the ball. She slid across
the field, passing the hall to midfield
er Shauna Itri. Itri ran onto the ball
tnd slammed in into the goal, just
below the crossbar. Il was 1-0 Stan
ford.
In last weekend's games against
the only other undefeated teams in
the Pacific 10 Conference. Stanford

needed to win against the IJSC Tro
jans and the UCLA Bruins. It needed
two wins to assume the status ;is the
only remaining undefeated team in
the Pac-10, and it needed two wins to
jump three rankings to No. 7 this
week.

â–  Today: No. 7 Stanford (13-3. 6-0
Pacific 10 (Oil fere nee) vs. ( alifornia
(10-6-1. 3-3). 7:30 p.m., New Mal
oney Field.

These wins were a result of skill,
but they were, more importantly, a
result of the effort of this Stanford
team. I his is precisely the work ethic
and determination that No. 7 Stan

lord (13-3, 6-0 Pac-10) will need
today as it faces the California Bears
(10-6-1,3-3).
"We need that kind of hard work
and spirit to maintain our level of
play," head coach Steve Swanson
said. "It is not that we need to do any
thing differently, we just need to
maintain. That extra effort by Kelly
showed fight. It showed confidence, a
willingness to he the aggressor, to
take responsibility and to dictate the
game."
Although California is currently
unranked. the traditional rivalry be
tween the two schools consistently
heightens the competition, regard
less of each team's season records
and caliber of play.
" The one difference is that it is
( 'al. ()ur team really gets up for ( al.
The teams know each other, and
we've developed a rivalry throughout
the years," Swanson said.
However. Cal's unranked status
does not necessarily reflect the cal
iber of this year's team. While Stan
lord beat both (JSC and UCLA last
weekend. Cal lost to them both in
overtime. 2-1 and 3-2. respectively.
"In a matter of minutes, they
could be where we are now, (at the
top of the conference)" Swanson
said.
In order to maintain its position at
the top of the Pac-10. the Cardinal
will have to defend against the offen
sive threat of junior Regina I lolan. a
transfer from the I Jniversity of Port
land. I lolan is a very experienced and
threatening player whose addition to
the team was welcomed with marked
impact.
"She has been playing more and
doing more damage. She is a real
presence to keep an eye on in their of
fensive third." Swanson said.
The consequences of the game
this weekend will not only affect the
Cardinal's status in conference play
but will potentially influence the
postseason play, a reality that will
soon be upon Stanford.
" This is an important win if we
want to position ourselves the best we
can in the tournament. There is a lot
of incentive for Cal. but just as much,
if not more, for us." said Swanson.
