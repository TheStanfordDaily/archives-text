WOMEN'S SWIMMING
â–  locla\-lomnrrow: No. I Stanford
competes in ( 'nllegc ('up meet at the
I Iniversitv ol British ( olunibia.

So. \\ hx did head coach Richard
(,)uick decide to lake the Cardinal
so far awav from home? It's simple.
I he pool in Vancouver is a 25-
metci pool, the same distance used
for the NCAA Championships.
I v pica I i aces arc in a 2? yard pool.

Onejnight think. "Twentv-five
meters, 25 \ aids. . . what is the dif
fere nee 7" Well, there is a differ
ence. Al this level of swimming,
where champions are champions
because of six-hundredths of a sec
ond. the smallest changes are sig
nificant. I'luis. Richard Ouick.
thinking ahead to the perfor
mances of Ins athletes at the
N( AA championships, thinks it is
important to gives Ins athletes the
experience of competing in a 25-
meler pool.
"It is the first experience as a
team in.i 25-meter pool."
However, il should be no sur
prise that N( AAs are not the only
thing on Quick's mind, flic fact that
il is an ()lympies year also con
tributed to his decision lo take the
team all the way to Vancouver (due
to the fact that the ()lympic events
are also held in a meter format).
"It is an Olympic year, and this

meet will relate to international
competition." Quick said.
Do the women fee I less intensity
going into this meet due to the fact
that they are not used to competing,
in a meter pool?
Junior Misty Myman does not
think so. "We are still going to swim
hard. We have high expectations. It
will be a good experience - getting
used to swimming meters."
Quick will he taking a lull team
to Vancouver in hopes of letting
everyone on the team gain from the
experience. "The team is smaller
than it has been in a while. We are
relying on quality over quantity."
I he experience of swimming in a
25-meter pool is the kind of quality
that the women will need in the fu
ture. both at NCAAs and beyond.
It is a very important kind of expe
rience to gain because, as llyman
points out, "anything that counts
for anything is done in meters."
