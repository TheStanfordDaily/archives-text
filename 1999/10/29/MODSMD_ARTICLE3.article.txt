# Take a walk on the spooky side

Sure, you could have studied rot
midterms. Or you could have gone to
Late Night. Or you could have sat in
your room with a cold bowl of
Ramen noodles watchingTeleFlieks.
Or ... you could have done some
thing wholly out of the ordinary and
joined one of Archeology Prof. John
Rick's Death Tours.
For the past five years. Rick has

led spooky, moonlit tours around
campus at various times throughout
the week preceding Halloween.
These tours, usually starting at
p.m. and often lasting well after mid
night. are open to anyone wishing to
"learn some interesting Stanford his
tory" in a uniquely eerie setting.
For Rick, the Death l our is "his
tory and archeology combined."
The tour customarily begins in the
Rodin Sculpture Garden, located

just outside the C 'antor ('enter lor the
Arts. I le likes to start there beeause it
is an area that is very mueh linked to
the Stanford family.
At the beginning of the tour. Rick
explains that there is a "landscape of
death" surrounding the museum. It is
in this area, he says, that many deaths
had to occur in order for Stanford to
be what it is today. Many students see

the death <>l I .eland Stanford Jr. as
theonh major factor that contributed
to the founding of the University.
Kick, however, seeks to dispel this
notion throughout the tour.
"What I try to do on the Death
l our is to give the idea that I.eland's
death isn't the only critical death for
the formation of Stanford Universi
ty." he says.
Rather. Kick claims Stanford ex
ists only because of "many deaths
that happened in a very specific

order."
This haunting introduction sets
the tone for the rest of the tour. Kick
then leads his audience to four more
major sites enclosed by the "land
scape of death": the former Stanford
home; the Angel of Grief: the Cactus
(iarden; and finally the Mausoleum.
At each stop, he continues the
story of how the Stanfords lived and
died, highlighting how each piece of
information greatly affects the future,
especially that of the University.
One may think the tour peaks
upon reaching the Mausoleum. Kick,
however, says the tour's climax oc
curs at the Angel of Grief, where he

reads a morbid poem Jane Stanford
had inscribed on the Obelisk at her
old home. This poem was placed
there after her husband and son had
both died.
"If people will be affected on the
tour, this is the moment. In fact. I still
get very emotional at this point."
Kick said.
Rick s;iid that the archeology and
history of the Stanford family is not
mired in dry facts and uninteresting
records.
Rick said he first came up with the
idea for the Death Tour "in a mo
ment of insanity." As he was studying
Stanford history one day.he said he

suddenly thought, "There's a story to
be told here. 1 low can we put the
flesh on these [Stanford] bones and
make it come alive?"
After much work, the Tour was
born. At first, the Tour was rather
small in number. It has since grown
exponentially in popularity, and
there are now anywhere from 60 to
1(H) people on any given tour.
Currently, he is exploring how
monuments, specifically those of an
cient Peru, are built to promote cer
tain individuals into power. His
archeological work in Peru is exten
sive. and has been ongoing for sever
al years.
