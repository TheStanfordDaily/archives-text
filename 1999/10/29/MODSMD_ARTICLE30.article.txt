### Dennis Lee 
Stanford sports is not known for
being content in the middle of the
pack. From cross country to volley
ball. the Cardinal dominates.
The men's crew team wants to
show that its 25th-place finish last
weekend at the 1 lead of the Charles is
not a trend. It is looking for redemp
tion this weekend and the Cardinal
may find it at the I lead of the Ameri
can.

MEN S CREW
â–  Tomorrow: Stanford competes at
the Head of the American at Lake
Natoma.

Stanford finished first at this
Sacramento regatta the last two
vears. In 1998. the team dominated.

coming in more than 30 seconds
ahead of the second-place UC-Davis
"B" crew.
The Head of the American regat
ta is hosted by Sacramento Stale and
annually attracts over 1 .(MX) athletes.
It includes competitions in 29 cate
gories ranging from Men's Open S's
to Women's Master 4's.
Held at Lake Natoma in Rancho
Cordova, near Sacramento, the
course is over three miles. The site is
good practice for the Cardinal, as
Lake Natoma happens to be the site
of the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships in May.
The regatta includes collegiate
crews from all across California in
cluding UC-Davis and San Diego
State and out-of-state crews such as
Colorado.
The Cardinal is early into the sea

son, hut it anticipates a strong perfor
mance.
"Although we expect to come out
on top. we take this race very serious
ly," said senior Parker Hume. "The
last two years, we took it pretty easi
ly, hut 1 think it will be closer this year
because we're gonna row two boats
that are about the same speed."
The men's varsity crew will enter
an "A" and a "B" boat in the Men's
Open 8-plus event. The Stanford "A"
boat will be comprised of the same
athletes that competed in the Head of
the Charles last weekend.
Although the team is racing two
boats, it does not expect to have as
many difficulties in Sacramento as it
did in Boston because the Head ol
the American course is straight and
contains neither narrow bridges nor
sharp turns.
