competes in ( ollege ( up meet at the

Assistant coach led Knapp is
looking forward to the competition.
" The more chances you have to
race in the tall, the better," lie said. "It
will bring us to a peak for when we
race Texas next weekend — a real
powerhouse."
I he travel experience itself will
give the ( ardinal a chance to prepare
for dual meets during the regular sea
son. Unlike last Saturday s one-day
trip to the University of the Pacific in
Stockton. Stanford will arrive in Van
couver the day before competition
begins, allowing time for mental and
physical preparation.
" I lie guys were really worn down
last weekend after practices and
training." Knapp said. "Thev recov
ered this week at practice, and this
weekend they'll have a chance to ac
tually think about the races before
racing."
The rigorous and exhausting
workouts from last week that left the

('ardinal drained for its meet at IJOP
will not be typical preparation for fu
ture meets.
The College Cup will also offer
Stanford the chance to swim in a 25-
meter pool, as opposed to the 25-yard
pools at most schools in the United
States. Since world record times are
recorded in meters, the NC A A made
the switch from a 25-yard pool toa 25-
meter pool in order to promote the

sport.
"It's unusual, but necessary," said
Knapp. ' The NCAA meet will be in
a 25-meter pool. It will be good for us
to get this experience so early in the
season. Maybe we'll even get a
chance to set some records."
The coaches expect that the two
teams of eight they take to Vancou
ver will show capabilities of compet
ing with anyone at the NCAA meet.
