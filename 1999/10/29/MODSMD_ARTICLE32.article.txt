After the C 'ardinal saw its chances
at a regular-season conference title
fall against California last weekend,
Stanford looks to regroup this week
end before the Northern Pacific (Con
ference ( Ttampionship.
The field hockey team (7-K, 4-1
Northern Pacific conference) takes
on two California teams this week
end as it looks to finish the season
with a winning record.

FIELD HOCKEY
■ Tomorrow: Stanford (7-<S, 4-1
Northern Pacific Conference) at the
I Jniversity of the Pacific 3-2).
■ Sunday: Stanford vs. UC-Davis.
1 :(K) p.m.. Varsity Astro Turf Field.

Tomorrow, the Cardinal goes to
Stockton to lace conference eon
tender University of the Pacific (4-4.
3-2). The Tigers have usually provid
ed ample competition for the Cardi
nal, hut this year Stanford has
crushed them twice — 6-0 in a pre
season scrimmage and 5-0 a month
ago.

After a victory last week. UOP
clinched the No. 3 seed in the NorPae
conference tournament. This means
that Stanford, as the No. 2 seed, will
most likely meet the Tigers again
next Saturday.
The Tigers have home-field ad
vantage against the Cardinal for the
first time this season, which is signifi
cant when considering what kind of
field it is. Unlike every other team
Stanford has faced this year. UOP
hosts its games on a field made of
grass.
"What's the big deal?" you might
ask. The difference between grass
and Astro Turf may seem like a minor
distinction, but any hockey player
will tell you that the two surfaces ren
der different games.
Turf is quicker: one smack can
send a pass from one endline to the
other without anyone so much as
touching it. Turf is cleaner; even a
player with scrappy skills can dodge
an opponent because turf keeps the
ball closer to the stick for control.
Turf is predictable: even grass fields
resembling smooth golf greens have
the slightest clumps and bumps that
can send a pass bouncing every which
way or even stop the ball in its tracks.

The Cardinal can hardly afford to
scoff at I JOP's playing conditions be
cause it was only two years ago that
Stanford had a grass field. The game
on Saturday might be slower and
scrappier than most games, but UOP
is ready for that. It's what the Tigers
train on, and what they hope will
keep the Cardinal from playing its
game.
"Grass requires more concentra
tion and effort." said freshman Dalin
da Baneulos. "But If we play like we
know how to play, we'll be fine."
Sunday's game is against club
team UC-Davis, and therefore
doesn't count toward the season
record. If the Cardinal can play like it
has against other exhibition teams,
crushing Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo 8-
0 and UC Santa Barbara 9-0, then
Sunday's game shouldn't be a nail
biter.
It will, instead, be a way to begin
preparing for the crucial weekend
that lies ahead. Recovering from a
loss to California last weekend, the
team is already planning ways to im
prove its game before the conference
championship, where it will most
likely meet Cal in the finals.
The games this weekend are a
chance for each member of the team
to evaluate what aspects of the game
they want to improve. Focus starts
now in preparation for what lies
ahead.
"We've been working on our
strengths — passing, speed — and
this weekend lets us improve them
for when it counts," said sophomore
Erica Swesey.
She. like the other members of
the Stanford attack, will take this op
portunity to work on shooting in the
games.
"These games will help us look
for breakaways and work on capital
izing on our opportunities," Banue
los said, a fellow attacker. "This
weekend, it's important to come out
of the game having improved,
learned something."
Sunday's game is home at 1 p.m.
