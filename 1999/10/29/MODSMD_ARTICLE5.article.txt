# Union, faculty, students respond to hospitalsâ€™ labor negotiations
## Protesters present at Fete Sen meeting 
### Scott Dortman Contributing writer 
Holding signs reading "Casper:
Be a Friendly Ghost" and "5.0.5.:
Save ()ur Standards. Save ()ur Stan
lord," over 70 students and Stanford
Hospital employees marched
through Arthur Cooley Courtyard
at the Law School yesterday, where
University President Gerhard
Casper was attending a Faculty Sen
ate meeting.
The scene outside the Law
School yesterday was a culmination
of a year's worth of tension between
Hospital employees and manage
ment. Protesters in front of the Fac
ulty Senate meeting were loud
enough to drown out parts of the
Senate's discussions. Window shut
ters in the meeting room had to be
closed when protesters began to
pound on the windows.
At the meeting Casper empha
sized the futility of protests targeted
at him. "It is clear that in addition to
everything else as president of Stan
ford. I cannot serve as labor relations
for IJCSF-Stanford," Casper said.
"Nor am I charmed by the fact that a
Senate meeting or other events are
interrupted by the theory that I can
single-handedly solve labor issues."
Hie protest, organized by the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition, a
student group, was designed to
"highlight the effects of | Casper's]
negligence in dealing with [the ongo
ing contract dispute between t J( "Si -
Stanford I lospital employees and
management]." according to a press
release from Service Employees In
ternational Union Local 715. the
union representing the hospitals'
employees.
For over 10 months, Stanford and
Lucile Packard Children's Hospital
employees have been involved in a
contract dispute with hospital man
agemeni. Casper claims that manage
ment of Stanford and management of
UC "SF-Stan ford I iospitals are "whol
ly separate," and that he does not
have the power to negotiate a con
tract with hospital employees.
"Stanford University is not the
employer. It is IX Si -Stanford, and
IJ( 'SI -Stanford is the only employee
in the foreseeable future," Casper
said. "Labor negotiations are the re
sponsibility of IJC SI - Stanford.
"The workers have chosen to tar
get me. I hey do not understand that
I am not management. I am a [Board
of I rusteesj member, and I am not a
member of the executive commit
tee." Casper said.
Most workers disagreed. "Ger
hard Casper has the power to solve
this contract crisis." contends Robert
Valenzuela, a Support Service Assis

tant at Stanford I lospital and a mem
ber of the negotiating team repre
senting 1.500 service employees. "1 le
is on the Hoard of Directors of
UC SF-Stanford. and he should meet
with us. We want this contract hon
ored and respected."
Hospital workers' chief point of
contention with management is over
wage increases forSEIU union mem
bers.
"Management got a 7 percent
wage increase this year, and non
union employees got a 3 percent a
year increase." said Linda Cornell, a
Unit Secretary in the nursing depart
ment. "They are only offering us a 4
percent increase over three years. We
just cannot live in the Bay Area on
that."
SF.IU members say they are irri
tated that management is paying a
consulting firm. The I luntcr (iroup.
$3,'7(H) and a lawyer $350 an hour to
negotiate the contract.
"I think the lawyer has been

brought in to drag this thing out as
much as possible," said Cornell.
Protesters participated in an hour
long march throughout Cooley
Courtyard, repeating phrases such as
"Gerhard Casper, you're no good,
treat your workers like you should."
and "Palo Alto be aware. Gerhard
Casper is unfair."
The protest also featured a union
employee dressed in a 6-foot peanut
costume, who distributed bags filled
with two peanuts. A note attached to
the bags read. "1 iospital workers de
serve more than peanuts, call Ger
hard Casper."
Employees are seeking a larger
wage increase than is currently being
offered, as well as a "fair and democ
ratic process through which the 2.(XX)
unrepresented hospital workers can
choose a union without interference
from management,' according to the
SI 111 press release.
"Employees are worth more than
what we've been offered." said

Valenzuela. "We make Stanford
what it is today. Stanford University
and Stanford Hospital are world
renowned institutions, and their em
ployees get treated lower than dirt."
A small contingent of Stanford
students joined in on the protest,
seeking to draw attention to the hos
pital employees' cause.
"We have to support the protest
ers and their cause," said senior Eli
Naduris-Weissman, a member of the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition.
"It's obvious that Stanford is being
run by "the man," and we need to keep
him down."
Hospital employees promise to
continue protesting until their de
mands are met by management and
Casper agrees to negotiate. Said
Valenzuela, "Casper refuses to meet
with me; he runs away from me. Well,
he can run but he can't hide."
