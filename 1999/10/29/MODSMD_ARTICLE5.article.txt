Holding signs reading "Casper:
Be a Friendly Ghost" and "5.0.5.:
Save ()ur Standards. Save ()ur Stan
lord," over 70 students and Stanford
Hospital employees marched
through Arthur Cooley Courtyard
at the Law School yesterday, where
University President Gerhard
Casper was attending a Faculty Sen

Hospital employees and manage

ulty Senate meeting were loud
enough to drown out parts of the
Senate's discussions. Window shut
ters in the meeting room had to be
closed when protesters began to
pound on the windows.
At the meeting Casper empha
sized the futility of protests targeted
at him. "It is clear that in addition to
everything else as president of Stan

for IJCSF-Stanford," Casper said.
"Nor am I charmed by the fact that a
Senate meeting or other events are
interrupted by the theory that I can
single-handedly solve labor issues."
Hie protest, organized by the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition, a
student group, was designed to
"highlight the effects of | Casper's]
negligence in dealing with [the ongo
ing contract dispute between t J( "Si -
Stanford I lospital employees and
management]." according to a press
release from Service Employees In
ternational Union Local 715. the
union representing the hospitals'
employees.
For over 10 months, Stanford and
Lucile Packard Children's Hospital
employees have been involved in a
contract dispute with hospital man
