## 
### Solarina Ho 
Former Chairman of the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
William B. Gould IV wrote an open
letter, submitted Oct. 26, to Universi
ty President (ierhard ('asper and the
IJCSF-Stanford Hospital Board of
Directors urging them to adopt a po
sition of neutrality in future union or
ganizing campaigns.
This letter was in reaction to the

l()-month-old continuing contract
dispute between UCSF-Stanford
Hospitals and Service Employees
International Union 715 (SF.IU
715).
As a Charles A. Beardsley Profes
sor of Law at Stanford and a member
of the National Academy of Arbitra
te >rs since 1970. Gould has had expe
rience on both sides of the labor
management bargaining table. Sinee
1%5, he lias arbitrated more than 21K)
labor disputes.
Between IW4 and 1 WN, he
served as ( hairman of the NLRB, a
neutral and impartial organi/ation
that he describes as one that "re
speets the concept ol right and oblig
ation between labor and manage
ment. but works under public policy
and promotes collective bargain
ing."
Clould stated in the letter that
"there are issues which the parties
have been unable to resolve which di
rectly involve my legal experience
particularly at the NLRB and
where, in my view, the University's
position could prove harmful to the

Stanford community."
"I just feel that the involvement in
an anti union campaign could be
harmful." said (iould. in an interview
with the Daily. "Stanford has to be
the best employer," he emphasized.
" I here are many employers who hire
anti-union consultants and try to
keep unions out and I don't believe
Stanford should join in those ranks. I
think it's harmful externally and in
ternally."
Stanford's reputation, he believes,
is a "precious commodity as it inter
laces with the community on a wide
variety of issues during the coming
months and years."
According it) (iould. the process
of bringing in external consultants is
"frequently discredited by govern
mental agencies." lie explained that
consultants often advise employers of
what kind of conduct they can engage

in to fight and disable unionization ef
forts. (iould worries that "in the ab
sence of a neutrality pledge, anti
union consultants could become in
volved in future union organizational
campaigns."
"I don't want to comment on what
Stanford has done — I think there are
many other people who know much
more about that." (iould stressed
that "this letter was not designed to
focus on the past, but essentially the
future."
(iould believes that a neutrality
pledge is particularly important for
the current unrepresented employ
ees of Stanford in protecting employ
ee free choice.
In addition, (lould wrote that it
would prevent an excessive, adver
sarial labor-management relation
ship frequently caused by "employer
interference and campaigns against

the rights contained in the National
Labor Relations Act."
"Such a stance is not only a step to
ward fairness and one which mirrors
the public policy preference for col
lective bargaining enshrined in the
National Labor Relations Act itself,"
wrote Gould, "but also it is more like
ly to produce responsibility on the
part of union leadership which does
not feel compelled to prove its man
hood in response to antagonistic re
sistance to the union by manage
ment."
1 le concludes his letter by calling
upon Casper and the UC'SF-Stanford
Board of Directors to commit itself to
neutrality in future unionization ef
forts.
"The time has come to surmount
the barriers that divide us and to pro
mote labor-management coopera
tion throughout Stanford."
