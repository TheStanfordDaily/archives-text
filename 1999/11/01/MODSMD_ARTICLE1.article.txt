The String Trio of New York performs Friday afternoon at a Women's Center program, "Breaking Barriers: A Necessity for Progress in
Society and the Arts." The event, a discussion, focused on topics such as art as a universal language; gender and stereotyping issues
in the arts; and labeling's effects on growth of audiences. Musicians, left to right, are Diane Moore, John Lindberg and James Emery.
