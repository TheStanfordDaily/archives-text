## Cairo-bound jet crashes into Atlantic; 217 die 
### 
BOSTON (AP) — An Egypt Air
jetliner bound for Cairo with 217
people on board plunged 33.(XX) feet
in two minutes, crashiug into the
ocean off Nantucket Island early
Sunday. Dozens of American
tourists were among the passengers.
By nightfall, searchers had
retrieved debris and one body, but
held out little hope of finding sur
vivors in the chilly Atlantic waters.
Authorities said the pilots made
no distress call. Though the FBI and
other intelligence agencies began
checking on the possibility of sabo
tage. President Bill Clinton and
other officials said there was no

immediate indication of foul play.
"We do not know at this point
what caused the crash." said Jim
Hall, chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board. "We
are beginning what may be a long
investigation."
Searchers found two partially
inflated life rafts, life jackets, pass
ports. seat cushions and other small
debris, none with any burn marks,
said Coast Guard Rear Adm.
Richard M. Larrabee. A finding of
such marks on debris could suggest
the possibility of a fire or explosion
aboard the plane.
Clinton, about to depart for

Europe for Middle East peace talks,
said there was "no evidence... at
this time" of foul play.
"I think it's better if people draw
no conclusions until we know some
thing." said Clinton, who called
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
to offer condolences.
The air search was suspended
after dark, but ships continued
scouring the area. The Coast Guard
said chances of anyone surviving
more than 12 hours in the SN-degree
water were slim.
A Navy salvage ship, the USS
Grapple, and Navy divers were leav -
ing Norfolk. Va., on Sunday night

and were expected to join the search
by late Monday, with orders to take
debris and remains to a Navy base in
Rhode Island.
U.S. officials indicated a majority
of the 199 passengers on Flight 9 I X)
were Americans, including a group
of 54 people bound fora 14-day trip
to Egypt and the Nile. Alan Lewis,
chief executive of the Boston-based
travel agency Grand Circle Corp..
said most of the group members
were from Colorado, Arizona and
the Pacific Northwest.
The plane started its flight in Los
Angeles and stopped at New York's
John F. kcnned\ International Air

port. It took off again at 1:19 a.m.
EST and went down at 1:52 a.m.,
roughly 6() miles south of Nantucket.
The Coast Guard deployed ships,
reconnaissance planes and heli
copters to search an area of about 36
square miles, in waters about 270
feet deep.
State-owned Egypt Air, confront
ed with the worst crash in its history,
said non-American passengers
included 62 Egyptians, two
Sudanese, three Syrians and one
Chilean. There were 18 crew mem
bers. Egypt Air said.
Egypt Air Chairman Mohammed
Fahim Ravan was asked about

reports that the Federal Aviation
Administration had warned
Egypt Air of a terrorist threat.
"We take all precautions, and we
have plenty of warnings from every
body, including the FAA." he
replied.
Armed security guards routinely
fly on EgvptAir flights. After the air
line's passengers go through the nor
mal airport security check, they are
again subjected to baggage search
just before they board the aircraft.
At the Cairo airport, sobs echoed
though a restaurant where officials
set up an information center for pas
sengers' relatives.
