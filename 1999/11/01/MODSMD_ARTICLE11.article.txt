Dissolving UCSF-
Stanford Healthcare
was a wise choice

The dissolution of the LCSF-
Stanford Hospital merger
should come as a surprise to
none, lor it was the most astute and
effective move that could be made
by both parties.
While the merger uas noble in
theory, in practice the ramifications
were disastrous.
One of the original goals of the
merger was to "safeguard teaching,
research and high-quality academic
health care in the Bay Area.'*
according to Stanford I niversity
President CÂ»erh;ird Casper. This is a
noble endeavor, and such coopera
tion between the two institutions
should be commended.
I nfortunately. such goals could
not outweigh the negative effects of
the joint venture.
I nion officials were initially con
cerned with understating and a
decline in quality of health care. The
pending closure of Mt. /ion in San
Francisco affirms the former, u-hich
in turn affirms the latter.
And of course, the multi-million
dollar loss that the venture is taking
\sas the final nail in the coffin. No
matter uhai ideals and intentions
the two parties ma\ hase had initial
ly. such a gaping deficit is a wall too
tall to scale.
Both sides should be credited for
what has so far been a mutually
cooperative acceptance of the disso
lution But it is imperative that when
more financial hits result in the pro
cess of dissolving the venture, both
sides should keep finger-pointing

and scapegoating out of the picture.
Jobs have already been lost, and
the closing of Mt. Zion is a giant step
back for Bay-Area health care.
Fighting over numbers and throwing
blame around will only aggravate an
alread\ bad situation. Both sides
should ha\e only one mindset: cut
losses as quickly as possible and
move on.
Fortunately, jobs that were elimi
nated during the early period of the
merger due to crossover with posi
tions at I'C's hospital should be
reinstated in the long run.
Casper should be credited for
putting himself at the front line of
this announcement and not hiding
behind spokesmen. He's opened
himself to even more scrutiny from
the community and the media, no
small feat for the president of a
renowned university.
The move also settles one of Stan
ford Health Services' biggest prob
lems. and the institution can begin to
deal with its displeased labor pool
immediately. However, labor offi
cials should not see this as an oppor
tunity to pressure Casper further.
No matter what people may wish
to think about Casper's position on
the Board of Directors for UC'SF-
Stanford. he has no control over
labor issues. It may be difficult to see
the line between Stanford Universi
ty and Stanford Health Services as
far as ultimate management is con
cerned. but one does exist.
7Tie work that these two institu
tions can do is a tremendous service
to the entire Bay Area. Unfortu
nately. combining those efforts was
too difficult. Both should be com
mended for their efforts, but now
the\ must move on and return their
focuses to their patients.
