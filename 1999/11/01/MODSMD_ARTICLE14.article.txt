# The Upward Spiral
## So you've found a woolly mammoth... 
### 
Govind Dandekar

On Thursday. Oct.
21. the San Fran
cisco Chronicle
reported that a Russian
family had discovered
"the fully preserved car
cass of a 20.000-year-old
woolly mammoth" in the

permafrost of Arctic Siberia. As far as I
know, there is no standard procedure to fol
low once you discover a woolly mammoth.
However, because of the gravity and scien
tific importance of the find it is imperative
that you act in a deliberate and professional
manner. Therefore. I have put together the
following seven-step plan that details what
to do when you find a woolly mammoth in
Siberia:
Step One: Get the hell out of Siberia.
There are many places that offer a high
er quality of living than Arctic Siberia. Four
locations that are more appealing are 1)
Serbia. 2) Pensacola. Fla.. 3) Oslo and 4)
Sterling Ouad. These places are all located
in more pleasant climates than Siberia. All
of the listed locations, with the exception of
Sterling Ouad. have a more teeming and
vibrant social life than does Siberia. I also
hear that the fjords in Pensacola are abso
lutely beautiful at this time of year.
Step Two: Do not call the French.
You will unnecessarily complicate the
situation if you decide to call in a French-led
expedition to excavate the mammoth. The
French will see your mammoth and then
immediately want to clone it. According to
the Chronicle, this is exactly what has hap
pened in Siberia: "A French-led expedi
tion" hopes to "recover DNA or even
sperm from the carcass — if it is a male —

and either to attempt to clone a mammoth
or artificially inseminate a modern-day ele
phant." Many Western European nations
have expressed a growing fear that the
French will clone the mammoth and imme
diately surrender to it.
Step 'fhree: Rent a copy of Jurassic Park
and show it to the excavation team.
When the excavation team begins to
entertain the idea of "substituting frog
DNA for missing mammoth DNA." you
know you are serious trouble. Drive to the
nearest Eilockbuster. rent Jurassic Park, tie
your excavation team down and make them
watch it repeatedly. After viewing the film
600 times, your excavation team will de\el
op an uncontrollable hate for Michael
Crichton. They will not. however, give up
on the cloning idea. Compromise with the
excavation team. Tell them you will only
allow them to clone the mammoth if they
hire Jeff Goldblum as a "chaos consultant."
Step Four: Buy health insurance.
Your giddy and delirious excavation
team will begin looking for some very
bizarre things in your mammoth. These
things may have an adverse effect on your
long-term health and the overall viability of
the human species. For example. Larry
Agenbroad. a member of the current exca
vation team. said. "We hope to find viruses
in its internal parts." Now I admit that I
often sit around thinking about how there
are not enough 20.000-year-old, incurable
viruses in the world today: I only hope the
cloned mammoth will solve this problem.
Step Five: Make sure there is an I MAX
crew on hand.
In the slight chance that the mammoth
comes back to life and eats all of vour sci

entists. you want to make sure that it is cap
tured on I MAX film. If you don't under
stand why. you need an I MAX crew, just
remember the old and oft quoted adage
"The real money in mammoth cloning is
not in the science, it is in the eating of sci
entists being captured on film by an IM AX
crew."
Step Six: Make your mammoth a
Reform Party candidate for the presidency.
Your mammoth already has more name
recognition, charisma and basic intelligence
than any currently declared Reform Part)
candidate. With a little coaching and a tew
well choreographed appearances on the
SalK Jesse Rafael show, your mammoth
will be well on its way to locking up the
nomination.
Step Seven: Trade your mammoth to the
New York Yankees for shortstop Derek
Jeter.
Let's face it. even with a candidate as
dapper and popular as your mammoth, the
Oval Office is anything but guaranteed. In
order to diversify your portfolio, you
should buy a major league baseball team.
You need to start building your team with
one "franchise" player. Let me assure you.
there is no better player to build your base
ball team around than hard-hitting Yan
kees' shortstop Derek Jeter.
1 wish you and your mammoth the best
of luck. I look forward to seeing you at the
lowa caucus.
