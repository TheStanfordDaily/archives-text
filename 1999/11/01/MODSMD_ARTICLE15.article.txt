Intangible qualities, not
rankings, distinguish schools
I i "some people. ( altech will always be
known is ( 11. jusi as some people will
11 v.i ,s l Stanford as a"I larvard wannabe
in the \K est."
\ sc.*l rct tli it those people tail to grasp is:
t school is more than its reputation, even its
academics, and certainly its rankings. C'al
tech iv ;md will never be Mi l Stanford is
;md will ne\er be Harvard. Nor should they
be.
I can name i million reasons why Stan
lord is the right choice lor me. The people
that challenged me. the (acuity, the aca
demies. the people I competed against, the
libraries, the in-room connection, the peo
ple I worked with, the research opportuni
ties. the ( IS lab. the people I lived with, the
dorm trips, the dorm assassin, the people I
befriended, the Stanford Band, the beauty
of the campus, the weather. San Francisco,
Santa ( ru/. I alloc. Most of these don't
show up neatly in any rankings.
I'm sure ( altech graduates can do the
same about their school.
All rating systems are limited. Hut the
I S. News and World Report's rankings are

particularly flawed. Not only does it not
take into account many important intangi
bles that can't be distilled to a neat statistic,
but the criteria that they choose are arbi
trary and often change from year to year.
'Io a cynic like myself, sometimes these
changes seem to be made for no apparent
reason than to instill excitement by shuffling
the rankings of the schools.
So what's the big deal? Unfortunately,
many prospective applicants and their par
ents don't know the secret yet. They decide
where to apply and where to go to accord
ing to reputation of the schools, and unfor
tunately a magazine such as U.S. News and
World report has an impact on their opin
ions. This in turn has an impact on the qual
ity of the student body at a place like Cal
tech and Stanford.
Then again, by jumping up and down,
we're drawing attention to the rankings,
which is not productive either. Perhaps we
just have to accept that for someone to get
to paradise they'd need the maturity to see
through the limits of any ranking system
and think for themselves.

Preacher represents real world
Anyone in the Stanford community who
believes in free speech should be wholly
embarrassed by comments made by sopho
more Laura Dos Santos in the Oct. 29 article
entitled "Screaming for attention in the
Plaza: Where are limits of Farm free
speech?"
When asked how she felt about a preach
er expressing himself in White Plaza. Dos
Santos replied. "This is an environment
where I feel like I shouldn't have to deal with
this."
I feel sorry that Ms. Dos Santos' bubble
has been slightly grazed by thoughts she does
not share. Really. I do. Heaven forbid this
campus, shielded largely from poverty, vio
lence, hatred and most of reality, should be
energized with small doses of activism!

Stanford students need their
bubble burst
I feel sorry for all the Stanford students
who believe that the preacher in White Plaza

last Monday did not belong on campus
because he made them feel uncomfortable.
What is to become of them when they
leave the shelter of the Stanford bubble and
everyday have to face people who voice their
opinions? If he made you feel uncomfort
able. as he did me (I am not religious at all),
then more power to him.
As Nanci Howe said. 'White Plaza is an
open area, and if you don't want to be there,
you can leave." No one was forcing you to
stay and listen to his ranting and raving. He
had every right to voice his opinions, espe
cially because he was a threat to nobodv: he
did not physically accost anyone or force lis
teners to change their beliefs to match his
own. He was even cooperative in giving up
his bullhorn.
And to those who feel that "This is an
environment where I feel like I shouldn't
have to deal with this:" you are going to have
to deal with similar situations your entire life.
If you choose to wrap yourself in a warm
blanket and close your eyes and ears to all of
the different people and beliefs of the world,
you cannot really be a part of the world.
