Africa's most populous country
was the subject of discussion and de
hate Friday night in Skilling Audito
rium. as the Nigeria-Stanford Educa
tional Resources Organization pre
sented a talk entitled. "What Legacy
Joes 'Freedom' have on the Nigerian
( ivil Society?"
Ihe talk, co-sponsored hy the
Ilechlel International ("enter and the
Stanford African Students Associa
tion. featured guest lecturer Kenne
saw State University Prof. A.( i. Ade
hayo. who spoke about the role
British colonialism has played in
shaping present-day Nigerian soci
ety. Adebayo has taught History at
kennesaw State in (ieorgia for over
seven years.
Adebayo opened his lecture by
playing a song by Nigerian musician
l ela Anikulapo-Kuti entitled, "Ff

fects of Colonialism," an indictment
of British rule in Nigeria. Lyrics such
as "England is the best place / Amer
ica is the best place, too/The black
man is inferior to us" illustrated
Anikulapo-Kuti's thoughts on the
mentality of some Nigerians.
Following the song. Adebayo dis
cussed the role colonialism still plays
in Nigerian society, 40 years after in
dependence.
"Even though the British are out
of Nigeria, the same colonial struc
tures still exist today," said Adebayo.
"The banking, insurance and credit
systems are still modeled after the
pound and British system. And edu
cation is still British in nature: heavy
on Shakespeare, as well as European
and North American geography and
history."
According to Adebayo, the way
whites were viewed under colonial
ism still affects the perception ol Eu
ropeans today.

"Under colonialism, the white
man portrayed himself as a superior
race," he said. "Through technologi
cal advantages, like the (iatling gun,
blacks saw whites as equal or better
than their gods. The white man be
came a god or demigod in Nigeria. II
colonialism would have continued
much longer, I believe shrines would
have been erected to white men."
This colonial mentality, Adebayo
said, still exists in Nigerian society
today, reflected in the products Nige
rians want to buy and the language
they prefer to speak.
"Nigerians prefer goods made
abroad to goods made at home.
Terms like 'Made in Africa' and
Made in Nigeria* are not compli
mentary terms. In the hierarchy of
languages. English is at the top. and
the native language is under it." said
Adebayo.
Adebayo also added that Nigeri
ans use big words to impress each

other.
"Nigerians will use 'flabbergast
ed' instead of 'surprised,' or 'congre
gating' instead of 'gathering.' It is
supposed to show more of a mastery
of the English language," said Ade
bayo.
Adebayo finally focused on the
future of Nigeria, claiming that the
nation has no choice but to modern
ize to improve the lives of its citizens.
1 lowever. "the question that remains
is how much of the traditions and cul
ture will we be able to retain after
fully modernizing?" Adebeyo said.
The lecture ended with an appeal
from Adebayo to members of the
Nigeria-Stanford Resources Organi
zation. saying they are some of the
leaders Nigeria will need to eliminate
traces of colonia society.
"You are the generation Nigeria
looks to for leadership, vision and di
rection in the next century," said
Adebavo.
