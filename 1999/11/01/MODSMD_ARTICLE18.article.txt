# Puzzle over origins of Sicily's Mount Etna explained by Geophysics Prof. Nur, others
## 
### David Wolman 
lor years, earth scientists have been unable to
explain the origins of Sicily's Mount I tna. the
largest volcano in l:urope.
But I'rol. Amos Nui ol Stanford's (ieophysics
Department and Zohar (ivirt/man ol Hebrew
I Jniversity in Jerusalem have come up with an ex
planation. I licit findings are reported in the ()ct.
21 issue of Nature.
Most volcanoes are created when one impact
ing tectonic plate is forced down into the hot man
lie layer ol the earth beneath an overriding plate,
sending magma up through cracks in the earth's
crust. Others are formed by the separation of
plates, like in Iceland, or over hot spot fissures in
the crust, such as the I lawaiian Islands.
Mount I tna is unusual, however, because it
"does not exist directly above a subduction /one.
like most volcanoes, and because il is chemically

di lie relit Horn the rock below it," said N nr.
The puzzle lor geologists and geophysicists
hinges on the question of why the volcano's lava is
chemically distinct from that ol'other volcanoes in
the area.
Adding to the mystery is the question of how
Mount Etna emerged in this location, at approxi
mately the same time in geologic history as sur
rounding area features, il not created by the same
tectonic events?
Nur and (ivirlzman hypothesize that Mount
I tna was, in fact, formed by the same plate active
ly that shaped the rest of the region. I"he evidence,
however, is hidden deep beneath the surface.
I "lie volcano was apparently formed at a "triple
junction," where the African. lonian and I vrrlieii
ian plates have been colliding, compressing and
collapsing over the last 2(K),(KK) years.
Using a three-dimensional model. Nui and
(ivirlzman were able to identify a unique "wedge"

of thick magma, known as asthenosphere, be
tween two of the plates.
This wedge of foreign material formed when a
piece of the Tyrrhenian plate broke off and trig
gered a process called "rollback." As the narrow,
broken part of the slab sank, it caused the larger
back portion to recede, thus opening a space that
was "filled by viscous material."
I lie open basin filled with material from an
"upwelling" underneath the African plate. The
lava that spews from Mount Etna is the same type
that is found under the African plate, thus sup
porting Nur and Gvirt/.man's theory.
Italy's Mount Vesuvius may have also been
created by rollback, Nur said, but that theory re
quires more analysis.
" These two volcanoes are very special because
they're in the middle of large cultural areas. We
know about their history," said Nur. "and how
hazardous they can be."
