## Huskies take Card's Pac-10 lead 
### Tim Kane Contributing writer 
SEATTLE —The way the Stan
lord football team started on Satur
day afternoon, it appeared that all the
talk about the Cardinal being a fluke
and a mirage would finally be put to
rest in Iront ol the hostile crowd of
70,308 at Husky Stadium. The of
fense looked impressive and domi
nant early, the defense made some
stops, and Stanlord looked ready to
stamp its claim on a share of the Pa
cific 10 Conference title.

FOOTBALL
■ Saturday: Washington (5-3, 4-1
Pacific 10 Conference) 35. Stanford
(5-3,5-1)30.

Then reality, also known as Mar
cus Tuiasosopo. came calling.
I'uiasosopo. Washington's junior
quarterback, ran lor 207 yards and
threw for 302 yards to lead the
Huskies (5-3, 4-1 Pac-10) to a 36-30
\ ictorv over the Cardinal (5-3,5-1) in
a game that was nowhere near as
close as the score might indicate.
Washington rolled up 670 yards of
total offense against the over
matched Stanford defense, the sec
ond-largest amount ever allowed by
the Cardinal.
The Husky quarterback became
the first NCAA player to pass for 300
yards and run for 200 yards in a game,
a feat made more ama/ing by the fact
that he played most of the game with
.i bruised gluteus maximus that left
him limping throughout the after
noon.
"We knew coming into the ball
game that he was a special athlete,
and had demonstrated special skills
throughout the season, and that if we

could somehow manage to control
him we could find a way to win the
football game." said Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham.
But nothing could have prepared
the defense for Tuiasosopo's out
standing performance. Tuiasosopo
frequently made runs of 10 to 20
yards on option plays or quarterback
draws. When he wasn't running all

over the field, the Husky quarterback
managed to find seams in the vulner
able Stanford secondary, which has
been burned week in and week out
during the course of the season.
On the offensive side of the ball,
the Cardinal got off to a phenomenal
start. Stanford marched down the
field in 2 minutes and 18 seconds,
scoring on a five-yard run by junior

running back Coy Wire.
Husak and senior flanker Troy
Walters hooked up on a perfectly ex
ecuted play-action lake that resulted
in a 49-yard touchdown pass to Wal
ters. With the aid of two turnovers by
Washington and decent play by the
defense, Stanford held a 14-3 lead at

the end of the first quarter.
Washington never let the game
get out of hand, trailing only 17-12 at
hall time. At the end of the first half,
sophomore running back Brian
Allen found himself the victim of a
questionable call by the officials.
Allen made a long run down the right
sideline, and had beaten the last
I lusky defender only to have his sure
touchdown called back for stepping
out of bounds at the 16-yard line.
The second half found the Stan

ford offense suddenly without its
rhythm. Alter a 26-yard touchdown
pass from I lusak to senior wide re
ceiver Deßonnie Pitts with nine min
utes remaining in the third quarter,
Stanford would not score until the
final second of the game.
"| We made] too many mistakes;
false starts, interceptions, getting
stuffed on first down, putting our
selves in too many holes," said
I lusak. who finished 22-of-41 for 3(X)
yards and three touchdowns, to go
with two interceptions.
In keeping with the tone of the
day, Tuiasosopo scored on a 30-yard
quarterback keeper with 9:54 left in
the game, giving Washington its first
lead at 2K-23. 112 rom there the Wash
ington delense look over, pressuring
on lliisuk and keeping the offense
from returning to its earlier form.
()nc of Stanford's few bright spots
was I'roy Walters. Walters set a Pac
-10 record for most career receptions,
passing Darrin Nelson on the list
with his five catches on the day to
give him 224 for his career, one more
than Nelson. Brian Allen, also turn
ing in a strong performance for the
Cardinal, had his second 1 (K)-yard
game in a row, with I Scarries for 101
vards, and gave Stanford good run
ning for most of the game.
Washington must win all its
games to win the Pac-10. and it still
has to make road trips to Arizona
and I K I A this year.
