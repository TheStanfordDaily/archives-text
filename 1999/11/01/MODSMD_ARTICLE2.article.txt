# ASSU looking to fill Constitutional Council positions
## 
### Alice Brown Editorial staff 
Last year, the ASSU's Constitu
tional Council, which is supposed to
have five members, had only three.
Yet that's three more members than
the Council has this year.
Though the Council positions are
notoriously difficult to fill, ASSU
President Mike Levin, a junior, said
that lie hopes to have all five posi
tions filled within the next week.
Also, though the ASSU has a
newly amended constitution this
year, the role of its Constitutional
Council remains unchanged.
Devised in 19%. the Council is
supposed to be made up of five mem
bers, whose jobs are to determine the
constitutionality of acts by an ASSU
legislative body or any member of
the Association.
According to the ASSU Constitu
tion, 'if the Council deems an act to
be unconstitutional, that act becomes
null and void. Acts stemming from
the unconstitutional act may, by a
majority vote of the Council, be
deemed valid if they were performed
in good faith."
Though the Council carries a
great deal of importance, it has had
trouble filling all five positions.
Levin saidthat "no one may con
currently be a member of the Coun

cil and an elected or appointed offi
cer of the Association. Also, no em
ployee of the ASSU may simultane
ously be a member of the Council."

This makes it difficult to fill the
spots, as few people on campus that
are not involved with the ASSU have
the necessary knowledge to serve on
the council, according to Levin.
Last year, there were only three
members of the council, and former
ASSU President Maren Norton was
unable to fill the remaining positions.
However, Levin hopes to have all
five positions filled within the next
week and has former Graduate Stu
dent Council Chair Harris Shapiro in
mind to head the council.
"Providing that my nomination is
approved." Shapiro said, "I'd be
happy and honored to serve."
According to the ASSU Constitu
tion, "The chair of the Council shall
call a meeting of the Council within
seven days of receipt of petitions [of]
five percent of the members of the
Association, [a] written request of
the president or vice president or a
petition signed by five members of
either Association legislative body."

Yet the Couneil has not met for
over two years. Levin said.
"There hasn't really been much of
a demand for [the Council]," Shapiro
said, "and we'd have something to
worry about if it met more frequent
ly."
