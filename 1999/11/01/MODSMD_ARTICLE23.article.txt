victories in the last 19 games. The
conference wins also enabled the
Cardinal to keep pace with UCLA
in the Pac-10. remaining one game

ly in the first game. Oregon showed
some fight in the second and third
games, staging a couple of small ral
lies behind freshman Kristin Ferris

and reserves Annie Pogue, a sopho

the resistance to a minimum, domi
nating the match and notching its
2()th-straight victory against the
Ducks to push its all-time record to
30-2 against Oregon.
