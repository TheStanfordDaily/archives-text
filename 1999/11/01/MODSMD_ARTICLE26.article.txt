## Card breezes past Marathon Oil in exhibition opener 
### Johnathan Stull Staff writer 
In a ragged game that degenerat
ed into something just above play
ground hall. Stanford offered up a
few tricks and more than enough
treats by destroying Marathon Oil
%-61 in the Cardinal's exhibition
opener yesterday afternoon.

Marathon, a traveling club team
comprised of former college players,
played tight against Stanford's top
unit for the opening minutes. How
ever. once the Cardinal found its
comfort /one and began pulling
away, the game became increasingly
wide-open and sloppy.
"It was almost like a pickup game
out there." said Stanford coach
Mike Montgomery. "A team like
Marathon usually comes in with no
preparation, no scouting and few set
offensive plays. So. they give the of
fense some things they wouldn't
normally gel and the offense took
advantage."
Senior forward Mark Madsen.
who led all scorers with 22 points,
took advantage on more than one
occasion. Both redshirt junior Rvan
Mendcz and sophomore Tony Gio
vacchini found Madsen for back
door alley-oops. Madsen's sky-high
throwdown of (iiovacchini's lob in
heavy traffic was the most impres
sive. especially to the vocal student
section that seemed to contain the
majority of the crowd in an empty
Maples Pavilion.
"It was fun to get out there and
gel loose." Madsen said. "I feel like
we have a lot of athletes on the team
this year. It's fun to play a more ath
letic style, especially in a game like
t his."

While the crowd seemed most in
terested in Madsen's low-post skills
and freshman Julius Barnes' flashy
ball-handling skills. Montgomery
was more interested in discussing
the fundamental aspects of the
game, which Stanford might actually
feature in the regular season.
" I he big guvs played really well
today," Montgomery said. Madsen,
junior Jarron Collins and his twin
brother, redshirt freshman Jason
Collins, "can all play either [power
forward] or center. They make up a
really good rotation out there."
Madsen was especially happy to
see both Collinses out on the floor
together after Jason sat out the last
two seasons with injuries. Playing
their first game together in almost a
year. Jarron put up IS points while
grabbing 14 rebounds and Jason
added 10 points and nine boards.
T he front line was somewhat de
pleted. however, as all three fresh
men post players — Curtis Bor
chardt, Justin Davis and Joe kir
chofer — were held out of the game
so they could still retain the possibil
ity of using their redshirt years.
"It's a lot of fun to be out there
with both Jarron and Jason on the
floor," Madsen said. "The last cou
ple years it's been tough for both of
them. But with them out there, and
when we get some of the freshmen
out there too. we'll be pretty good."
Montgomery said at least one
freshman who had yet to see action
would play in the Cardinal's exhibi
tion this Thursday against Athletes
in Action, but said the decision on
which player would not be made
until later.
Meanwhile, freshmen Barnes
and Casey Jacobsen both saw exten
sive time in the baekcourt. Jacobsen.
known as a deadly shooter, was only
l-for-8 shooting, but his good de
fense and offensive fundamentals
showed.
