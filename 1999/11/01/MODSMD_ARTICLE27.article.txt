# Future looks bright for revamped squad

### Jim Tunkersley Senior staff writer 
Stanford played and won an en
tirely meaningless game yesterday, a
fact that didn't deter more than I.(KM)
white-T-shirt-clad students from
packing the Sixth Man section and
pounding the Maples floorboards
until the final buzzer.
The Cardinal is still rough around
the edges, having started practice just
two, weeks ago. and coach Mike
Montgomery warned against draw
ing too many conclusions from last
night's %-61 Stanford victory over
Marathon Oil.
"It's almost like a pickup game,"
he said.
Still, a few impressions stuck out
from the year's first exhibition:
• The battle to back up junior
Mike McDonald at point guard will
be a good one. Freshman Julius
Barnes and sophomore Tony Gio
vacchini both played extensively yes
terday. with Giovacchini looking
solid and Barnes impressing with
some razzle-dazzle moves.
• Senior Mark Madsen will live
and die at the free-throw line this
year. None of Marathon Oil's veter
an big men could stop Madsen under

the basket, and the forward scored
eight of his 22 points at the line on 8-
of-10 shooting.
• This Stanford team will run and
gun more than Cardinal squads of
the past. Montgomery experimented
with some small, athletic lineups yes
terday. at times playing both Barnes
and Giovacchini together, and the
Cardinal opened up leads in both
halves on the strength of a string of
fast-break baskets.
• Casey Jacobsen will have the
chance to do big things this year, but
last night nerves iced his shooting
touch. After missing his first seven
shots, the highly touted freshman fi
nally broke through with a three
pointer late in the second half. But
Jacobsen defended well and turned
the ball over only once in 22 minutes.
• The Sixth Man Club is loud as
ever. Jacobsen called the student fan
section, which taunted Marathon Oil
players with "airbair chants even
when Stanford led bv 30 points, "the
most incredible thing I've ever seen."
And during a first-half timeout,
with the Maples hardwood thunder
ing under 7(X) pairs of stomping feet.
Marathon coach Sam Foggin turned
to an official and asked. "Are all the
floors in the Pac-10 like this?"
