# Stanford Spanish-speakers volunteer to help Escondido kids learn language through school immersion program
## 
### Melinda Munos 
At the same time as sonic Stanford stu
dents enter their first Spanish class, some of
their peers are helping children — from
kindergartners to fourth graders at Escondi
do Elementary School — learn to speak
Spanish themselves.
For the past five years, children of Stan
ford faculty and other area children have
been learning math and other subjects not in
their native English, but primarily in Spanish.
A volunteer program at Escondido is af
filiated with the school's language immersion
program. The school, which is part of the
Palo Alto public school system, offers stu
dents the opportunity to be immersed in the
Spanish language for up to 90 percent of the
school day.
Approximately 30 students from each
grade participate in this pilot program, which

is in its fifth year. The goal is for all the stu
dents involved to attain a native level of flu
ency by the end of the fourth grade.
Reactions from parents with students in
volved in the program have been enthusias
tic.
"I think it is incredible," said Susan Wais.
mother of two children enrolled in the im
mersion program. "I've had a couple of Span
ish students [from Stanford] come in and
read with my kids. Some of them are native
speakers and they have been very im
pressed."
One parent with a daughter enrolled in
the program, Maria-Cristina Urruela, is also
a professor of Spanish at Stanford. In the
past, as part of her Spanish 1(H) Advanced
Conversation class, she required her students
to volunteer for one hour a week in the im
mersion program.
Urruela said that the teachers at Escondi

do decide what type of work the volunteers
can do, but that most help small groups of stu
dents with math or reading in Spanish, or
read a story to a group of children. Occasion
ally. they also work one-on-one with students
who require more extensive help.
"The kids' reactions [to the volunteers]
have been very positive," Urruela said.
"They think it is wonderful, and it makes
them feel very important when a Stanford
student makes a mistake, and the kids get to
correct them."
Since Urruela is not teaching Spanish 1 (K)
this quarter, there is no official link between
Stanford and this volunteer program. She has
informed all her classes about this volunteer
opportunity, however, and said that the
teachers at Escondido are eager to have
helpers from Stanford in their Spanish classes.
Escondido Elementary School Principal
Gary Prehn echoed this sentiment.

"If they are willing to work with kids and
enjoy working with kids, we would love to
have them come help out," Prehn said.
The only general requirement for helping
at the school is a tuberculosis test. In addition,
students interested in helping out in the
Spanish program should be at least in first
year Spanish to work with kindergarten chil
dren, and in at least second-year Spanish to
help with first grade or above, according to
Urruela.
Officials involved with the immersion
project are still in the process of finding stu
dent volunteers for this fall.
Stanford student volunteers at the school
also have the opportunity to work with chil
dren through the Stanford Youth Project,
which was revived this year by Prehn and
sophomores Marie Gonella and Kylene kil
gore after a one-year hiatus. The program
pairs Stanford students with elementary

school students in one-on-one tutoring rela
tionships.
According to Prehn, tutors work with chil
dren on academic projects and homework, as
well as helping them out in specific problem
areas. The school accommodates student
schedules, allowing students to tutor not only
after school, but also during the school day.
Although the project is only three weeks
old this year, Prehn said that in the past, it was
very successful.
"It made a really big difference with these
kids not only academically, but also because
they really developed a friendship with these
tutors," Prehn said.
Students interested in volunteering in the
immersion program should contact Prehn at
856-1337 or third-grade teacher Lvdia Avala
de Ramirez, and those interested in the Stan
ford Youth Project should contact Prehn or
Gonella at -W7-2114.
