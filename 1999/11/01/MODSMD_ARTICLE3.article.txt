# Blood drive policies raise concern

### Sandra Upson 
A recent Cardenal Blood Drive
provoked a strong response from stu
dents in the dorm concerned with po
tentially discriminatory questions in
the Blood Drive questionnaire.
Students objected to questions
that appear to intentionally keep gay
men from donating blood.
The questions appeared in a Stan
ford Medical School Blood Center
pamphlet distributed to students who
were donating blood. Among state
ments made by the pamphlet are:
"Do not donate blood if you: Are a
male who has had sexual contact with
another male, even once, since 1977"
or "were born in. or lived in since
1977, any of the following [African]

get the Medical Center to publicize
the stipulations.
"We're going to try and get a for
mal statement from the Medical Cen

statement," he said.
Gill emphasized that the gay
males are not the only population
with a high frequency of AIDS cases.
"Statistics show that [AIDS] is
mostly found in African-American
and Latina women " he said.
Gill plans to meet with Stanford
Blood Bank officials early next week
in order to discuss the issue and to
raise awareness across campus of

what he feels is the blood drive's dis
crimination against gay men.
"Stanford Medical Center ought
not to be allowed to hide behind gen
erally accepted procedure and proto
col. "Just following orders.' is not an
excuse for this kind of obviously ho
mophobic procedure. [Stanford is]
simply perpetuating stereotypes and
prejudices." wrote Gill in an e-mail to
the qnet list.
Gill feels the support he has re
ceived from his peers is encouraging.
"I think there are definitely some
health concerns that you have to
keep in mind, but there should be a
more practical way to establish that,"
said Cardenal Peer Health Educator
and senior Miranda Ip of the contro-
