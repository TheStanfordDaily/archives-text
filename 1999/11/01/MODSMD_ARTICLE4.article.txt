### Sameer Ahmed Contributing writer 
Members of the Sigma Nu and
Kappa Sigma fraternities, the Delta
Delta Delta sorority and the lnter
sororitv Council (ISC) are currently
planning fall community service pro
jects.
The service projects include food
drives, ;i beach cleaning and helping
out with World AIDS Day events.
Sigma Nu service
Beginning Friday of this weekend,
Sigma Nu brothers will participate in
their second-annual food drive for

Second Harvest, a food-bank organi
zation that serves over KK).(KK) low
income families, adults and seniors
every month.
As a part of the food drive, mem
bers of Sigma Nu have formed the
Safeway Sleepout. They plan to sleep
out the entire weekend in shifts, from
Friday afternoon to Sunday morning,
in front of the Safeway at Menlo Park
to collect food.
"We're hoping to surpass last
year's results of over 1,5(X) pounds of
food that we donated to Second Har
vest." said junior Edward Sobol.
community service chair for Sigma
Nu.

In addition to the Safeway Sleep
out. which has become a yearly fall
tradition for Sigma Nu, the members
also plan on participating in one or
two big community service events
each quarter. For example, last
spring, they volunteered at the annu
al Bing Nursery School carnival and
were involved with the Hunger
Clean-Up Project.
However, this year, Sigma Nu
wants to increase its participation in
the community, according to Sobol.
Sigma Nu members are helping to
organize the Take Back the Night
March to prevent sexual assault on
campus. And. by next quarter, Sigma
Nu plans to establish an innovative
sports-tutoring program. Once a
week, several Sigma Nus hope to
teach various sports skills to low-in
come youth around the Stanford
area.
Sigma Nu Pledge Class President
Steve Fried, a sophomore, believes
that fraternities and sororities play
an important role by helping their
community.
"I think it's important for every
body to do community service." said
Fried. "It's interesting, though, that
for all the bad things people say
about the Greek community, it's the
fraternities and sororities that are
consistently out there working to
better the community."

Kappa Sigma projects
Next weekend. Kappa Sigma will
send approximately 20 brothers to
ihe Bing Nursery Auction, which
helps raise money lor the school.
Also. Kappa Sigma members plan to
participate in a beach clean-u within
the next two to three weeks.
Kappa Sigma Community Ser
vice Chair Ryan Renteria, a junior,
also tried to set up an outing with
Habitat for Humanity, but said he
was pleasantly surprised that the ex
tremely popular house-building
group was booked through the year
2CXJO.
Renteria reiterated the impor
tance of community service for fra
ternities.
"It seems that many guys join fra
ternities for the great social life,
drinking and having fun; however,
they are also a great way to help the

community," said Renteria. "When
50 guys come together in brother
hood and focus on tutoring kids or
building houses, they can turn things
around a lot."
Sororities' programs
The Delta Delta Delta sorority
and the Intersorority Council have
focused their efforts on health and
safety issues on campus.
In White Plaza on Nov. 16, Tridelt
is having its Annual Service Auction
to benefit children's oncology re
search at the Lucile Salter Packard
Children's Hospital.
"This event involves members so
liciting donations and sponsorships
from local businesses, Stanford ath
letic teams, social groups and row
houses." said senior Stephanie Blos
som. ISC president. "Students can
come to White Plaza at noon and bid
on all kinds of items, including North
Face gear, weekend trips, a motor
ized scooter, a signed basketball
from the basketball team and restau
rant gift certificates."
This event. Blossom added, is
simply representative of many
planned service projects by all Greek
organizations that involve people
from the entire community.
"The greatest thing about this
auction is that it creates a cohesive
Greek community," she said.
The ISC has planned many pro
jects supporting health and women's
issues. It will coordinate World
AIDS Day events with Cowell
I leath Services, the Women's Center
and other groups that promote sexu
al health. A planning meeting for this
will take place Nov. 4.
Additionally, on Nov. 16. the ISC
