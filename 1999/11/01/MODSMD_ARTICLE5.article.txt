More than 150 Muslim college
students from all over Northern Cal
ifornia gathered at Stanford Satur
day morning for the inaugural Mus
lim Students Association (MSA)
Olympics, an event organized to pro
mote unity in faith as well as a fun and
competitive spirit.
Participants included students
from Stanford, as well as from UC-
Berkeley, Santa Clara University
and UC- Davis.
Sponsored by MSA for the West
Coast, the Olympics took place from
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and featured games
such as basketball, volleyball, soccer
and track. Students from different
sch(x>ls formed teams and competed
against each other. Basketball and
soccer were some of the most popu
lar events, according to senior Narjes
Misherghi, head coordinator of the
Olympics.

"Soccer was especially popular
because many people were foreign
students and soccer is such an inter
national sport," Misherghi said.
"Soccer was the most unifying sport
of the event."
Hooma Multani, who participat
ed in both basketball and soccer, said
she felt that beyond the excitement
of competition, there was a sense of
camaraderie, regardless of which
teams people were playing for.
"I definitely got a chance to bond
with other students and know other
schools," said Multani, a junior at
UC-Berkeley. "The Berkeley-Stan
ford rivalry didn't really matter be
cause we were getting together for
something important, and we met in
the sense of unity."
The MSA Olympics was the first
of its kind in California and required
much coordination, but Misherghi
said she felt that the work paid off.
"In terms ol logistics. there need
ed to he a lot <>112 planning. but when il
eame down to getting people there,
everything seemed to jusi tail into
plaee." Misherghi said.
Senioi Shaffiquc Adam said he
was impressed with the event. "(iet
ling people togethei from all over the
area to pla\ spoils w as a great idea."
he s.iul. â€¢" I lie wav lliev pulled every
thiim together was wonderful."

Misherghi said Stanford was cho
sen as the location of the olvmpics
this year because the Islamic Society
oil campus is very strong and well-es
tablished. having been rounded in
I'M Ihe campus was also consid
ered a central location.
Misherghi said that the games
generated much enthusiasm for
MSA.
" I here was a lot of school spirit,
but what we all had in common was
our sense ol faith." Misherghi said.
"We left with a stronger sense of
brother / sisterhood, and that's what
made the event a success."
