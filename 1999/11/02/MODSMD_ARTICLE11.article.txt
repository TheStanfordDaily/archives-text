Stanford and Bio-X
grateful to Clark for his
$150 million donation

LAST WEEK, Silicon Valley
businessman and former
Stanford Computer Science
Professor Jim Clark announced his
intention to give Stanford $150 mil
lion, the largest single donation to
the University since its founding.
The benefits that Stanford will reap
from this gift are incalculable.
The donation will be used to
fund the new interdisciplinary Pro
gram in Biomedical Engineering
and Sciences — also known by
Stanford faculty as Bio-X — and
construct a center to house the pro
gram.
The center will serve as a strate
gic physical and symbolic link
between the Medical School and
the Science and Engineering Quad.
Consolidating the Bioengineering
work being done by many depart
ments into one place will allow for
and promote research that is both
more focused and in-depth.
Seeing that the hope of Bio-X is
to integrate basic and applied sci
ences to develop new therapies and
cures for human disease, this con
centration of knowledge is essential
to the success of the program.
The new center will allow for
interaction between technicians,
scientists and scholars at an
unprecedented level. Approxi
mately 50 faculty members and 400
scientists and technicians will work
at the facility, with about 30 percent
of the faculty members newly
recruited from outside of Stanford.
There is no telling what fortu
itous interactions might occur as a
result of concentrating many schol
ars in the field of Bioengineering in

one building. The Stanford commu
nity, the nation and even the world
stand to benefit from the research
that will occur at the new center.
Clark's donation allows for the
development of an idea that origi
nated among Stanford's faculty
across several disciplines. If the
Bio-X program is successful, it
would reflect the efficacy of the
new approach to research, where
different, traditionally unrelated
disciplines are combined to provide
incredible solutions to various
problems.
Clark finalized plans for the
donation with new Provost and for
mer colleague in the Department
of Electrical Engineering John
Hennessy. The University should
be grateful to Hennessy for secur
ing this donation.
His efforts will undoubtedly not
go unnoticed by the search commit
tee formed to find University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper's successor
— soliciting funding has been one
of the hallmarks of Casper's term
as president, a tradition that his
successor should continue.
However, there are some con
cerns that need to be considered in
the future. For example, although
the University is grateful for any
donations that it receives, potential
entrepreneurs should carefully
work with University officials, as
Clark did, to see how their dona
tion could be most effectively uti
lized. While engineering and the
natural sciences have received
much attention of late, the humani
ties and social sciences would bene
fit from similar sorts of grants.
This would entail having an
administration and more impor
tantly a president — that ensures
the entire University continues to
benefit from the generous dona
tions of its benefactors.
