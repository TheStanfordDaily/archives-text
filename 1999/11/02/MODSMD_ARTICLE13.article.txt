## Mike Rosenbluth Rethinking the German stereotype 
### 
£ "TTJUST DON'T ever
I want to go." one of
Resident Fel
lows once told me. And I
can't really blame her.
Alter growing up in a Jew
ish household in the after
math of World War 11,

Germany does not hold the most pleasant
memories.
But since returning from a half-year stay
in Berlin in September. I have discovered
this opinion more often than not when talk
ing to Jews of my parents' generation and
older. Most don't want to visit Germany,
and some don't want to buy German cars,
drink German beer or do anything that
would at all support the country that was
responsible for the atrocities that occurred
60 years ago. I would say that in a tradition
ally liberal group. German is the only cul
ture which Jews have an open prejudice for.
Is this right? Is it fair to hold the Ger
mans of today responsible for the sins of
their forefathers? My answer is no.
Growing up. I had the same opinion as
my parents on Germany: I had no interest
in going. On our two trips to I:urope while
growing up. we visited England. France.
Italy and Switzerland (the French region)
but never Germany. I remember at one
point going to the German-influenced
northern part of Italy, where German was
spoken more often than Italian. My parents
shortened our three-day planned stay there
to one.
So the only things I ever heard about
Germany were from history books, family
opinions and my sister's trip to the Munich

Oktoberfest. And though Oktoberfest
sounded like quite a lot of fun. every other
story was clouded over in darkness.
So why would I want to go? 1 knew
everything I needed to. or so 1 thought.
But my senior year of high school, a Ger
man exchange student came for a year and
played tennis with me on our team. The
funny thing was that he was not at all what
I expected of a German. He was cool,
funny, friendly and could drink a hell of a
lot of beer (OK. maybe I expected that),
just like any normal American, lie became
one of my best friends over the year, and
through him I learned that Germans are
more like us than the Nazi-Aryan image we
set them up to be.
And while in Germany, 1 realized this
even more. I got more warmth out of my
German host family than I ever could have
imagined. Germans I met at summer beer
festivals were friendly, kind-hearted people.
When you think about it. every German
below the age of 75 is too young to have had
any control over anything that happened.
So how can you hold an entire generation
responsible for something that they had no
control over? Some people argue that the
German cultural stereotype of structure
and obedience are ingrained in the German
psyche, making them completely capable of
another Holocaust. Sure the trains run on
time and nobody jaywalks (OK. I found
that sort of creepy), but are those really cul
tural faults?
Germans are quite conscious and
ashamed of their Third Reich past, and want
to ensure that that never happens again; they
are not the same people that were responsi

ble for World War II and the Holocaust.
I sensed more of a self-fear from Ger
mans than I would have expected. Since the
war, the German people have been very
anti-military, preferring not to have an
active role in any military offensive. During
the war in Kosovo, many Germans were
quite uneasy sending out their first military
offensive force since World War 11. but I
think they were swayed to make a stand
against genocide and to show their new
responsibility to the European Union.
Though the capital of Germany is mov
ing back to Berlin, the government wants to
make clear that this move will not revert the
country to what it was. The newly rebuilt
Reichstag parliament building has a huge
public accessed glass dome built over it.
symbolically and physically making a state
ment that the people of Germany and the
world will always be able to see what is
going on inside.
Can you imagine being born into a cul
ture and learning about what atrocities your
elders committed? Should the burden of
guilt be placed on you? Some feel that Ger
mans should be held responsible for the
actions of their elders. Though I feel they
must always be conscious of their history, it
is unfair to blame and psychologically pun
ish a new generation of Germans for the
mistakes of their forefathers.
