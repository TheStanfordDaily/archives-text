Preacher prepares students
for life outside the Farm
While I must say that 1 sometimes do
enjoy the sterile nature of the Stanford
campus because it always seems to be
(much like Disneyland) the happiest
place on earth, I am appalled at the
unwillingness of Stanford students to deal
with the "harsh" realities of life outside
our bubble.
In Friday's article about the "bull horn
wielding preacher" in White Plaza last
Monday, every student cited had reserva
tions, at the very least, about this man's
right to aggressively (though nonphysi
cally) evangelize on campus.
Although I may personally not agree
with the man's firc-and-brimstone mes
sage and am, as a Christian, rather
embarrassed by his example. I vehement
ly support and enthusiastically welcome
his success at making our campus a bit
more colorful. I cannot believe that Stan
ford students, supposedly some of the
brightest in the nation, are begging the
University to take away liberties on cam
pus.
Stanford is not summer camp. Stan
ford is an institution whose primary task

is to train individuals with great personal
potential to function constructively in the
"real world" and is in my opinion far too
hermetically sealed (culturally and ideo
logically, primarily) to fully achieve this
end.
After reading this article, however, it
was made abundantly clear to me that
the student body seems to bring the "out
of sight, out ol mind" mentality upon
itself. I am so pleasantly surprised that I
agree with the University's stance on this
issue, which is to allow any and all nonvi
olent provocateurs to exist in White
Plaza.
For as much as the student body talks
about "embracing diversity," we obvious
ly are only willing to do so insofar as the
people who are different from us are not
ideologically radical, socially incompe
tent or otherwise disturbing.
Although we all suffer from the emo
tional flight mechanism when faced with
"difficult" people and situations, we. as
the future leaders of this country, have an
obligation to confront ideas and people
that make us uncomfortable.

A better-tasting sandwich
I was very amused by student reactions
to the religious speaker in White Pla/a.
When I was a student there was a guy
named Reverend Jim who would show up
on warm days and shout about the book
ol Revelations and the Letters of Paul in
the grassy area between the fountain and
the bike rack area.
My contemporaries saw this as an
opportunity to have some fun. There's
nothing like shouting back at someone
who's shouting at you and seeing which
one of you is crazier. Heck, if you never
took speech or debate in high school, you
should look at it as a time to hone your
argumentative skills.
Your Momma is not there to protect
you anymore; if you think you have the
right to live in this world, unaceosted by
uncomfortable and weird things, then
you're going to hit a wall when you get
that little degree of yours.
The next time that guy shows up, bop
over to Green or Meyer and check out a
Bible; come back and meet him on his
own terms. If this guy is a true maniacal
idiot, it shouldn't be a problem for a high
ly honed academic such as vourself to

beat him into the ground intellectually.

False information
shouldn 7 be used to sup
port a cause
Although I am sympathetic to Lyndon
Gill's concerns over discriminatory poli
cies by the Stanford Blood Banks and
other blood banks, 1 think it is inappro
priate to provide false information in
order to support one's cause.
In a quote from Monday's article, Gill
stated that AIDS "is mostly found in
African-American and Latina women."
This is true when comparing them to
other women, but in the AIDS / HIV
surveillance report put out by the CDC it
is plain to see that while the cases of
AIDS in African-American women and
Latina women is rising quickly, their
numbers have not surpassed those of men
who have sex with men.
