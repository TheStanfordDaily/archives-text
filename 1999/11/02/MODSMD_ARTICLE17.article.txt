### Erin Bouchier Staff writer 
If there were any doubts that the
Stanford men's water polo team de
served the nation's No. 1 ranking, the
Cardinal laid them to rest Sunday,
beating No. 3 USC for the second
time in a little more than a week.

MEN'S WATER POLO

■ Saturday: No. 1 Stanford (16-2.5-
1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) 12, No. 7 Pepperdine (7-9.2-3)

■ Sunday: Stanford 7. No. 3 US(
(17-3)5.

Stanford senior Scan Joy played
no small part in silencing the naysay
ers as lie scored nine of the Cardinal's
17 points on the weekend, which also
saw Stanford defeat No. 7 Pepper
dine (7-9, 2-3 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) in a league match.
Joy and the rest of the Stanford
squad (16-2.5-1) matched up against
USC (17-3, 4-1) for the fourth time
this season in what has become an ex
tremely heated rivalry. The team's
first two meetings this season both
went into overtime, with Stanford
winning the first in the final of the
SoCal Tournament and the Trojans
coming out on top in the second in
the NorCal Tournament semifinal.
Last weekend in Los Angeles, the
Cardinal took game three, 5-3. So
when the Trojans arrived at
deGuerre Pool on Sunday, they were
seeking revenge.
But Joy played the role of spoiler,
scoring four points, the biggest of
which came on a two-point shot with
a little over a minute left to break a 5-
5 deadlock and lift the Cardinal to a
7-5 victory.
The story of the game was the
Cardinal defense, especially in the
many 6-on-5 situations. There were
18 kickouts on Saturday, and the
Stanford defense proved the differ
ence as the Cardinal allowed USC
only two scores on eight man-up op
portunities while converting five of
its seven chances for points.
"Our 6-on-5 defense was excel
lent. It was a combination of Nick
[Ellis) with some key blocks and
other players holding their places,"
Dettamanti said.
The game was close throughout

all lour quarters, with the teams tying
four times before Joy's final goal.
USC opened the scoring in the
lirst period, hut Stanford responded
with three straight man-up goals, two
by Joy and one bv senior Brian Heif
feron. As the quarter came to a close,
USC closed the gap to 3-2 on a coun
terattack goal.
Kickouts came in a Hurry in the
second period. Each team scored just
once on three man-up opportunites,
giv ing Stanford a 4-3 halftime lead.
Tensions heated up in the third
quarter as two Trojan supporters and
the USC assistant coach were kicked
out of the pool area by the refcrree.
However, the Stanford squad
"stayed really calm," Stanford assis
tant coach Ben Quittner said.
USC tied the game and then took
the lead. With two minutes to go, two
Trojans were kicked out, giving Stan
ford a 6-on-4 opportunity. Senior
Andy Walburger put in the rebound
of a 1 Iciffcron shot to tie the game at
live and set up an exciting final peri
od.
Tightened defense, including
three impressive blocks by Stanford
redshirt freshman goalie Ellis,
higlighted the fourth period. As the
clock wound down to 1:16, a team
mate drove off Joy's defender, allow
ing Joy to score the game-winner.
Stanford also played excellent de
fense against USC's powerful hole
man Castle. While getting only one
kickout, "Skaalen just did a super job
on Castle," Dettamanti said.
On offense, Dettamanti was par
ticularly pleased with the squad's suc
cess on man-up opportunites and
Joy's ability to score.
Joy began his scoring deluge with
a career-high five points on Saturday
against Pepperdine. Stanford came
out to a quick start, hut the Waves se
cured a 3-2 lead.after the first period.
Stanford may have been a bit sur
prised by the intense nature of the
game. "It was a very physical game.
The referees really let it get out of
hand." Dettamanti said.
But by the second quarter the
Cardinal got over any initial surprise.
Indeed, the second period was all
Stanford as the Cardinal held the
Waves to just one goal while scoring
five points, three on goals by Joy.
From there. Stanford didn't look
back, winning bv a final score ol 12-<S.
