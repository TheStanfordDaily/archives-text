MEN'S GOLF

■ Saturday-Sunday: No. 10 Stanford
wins the Nelson Invitational.

The Cardinal (287-279-281-847)
finished live strokes under par, one
of only two teams to shoot below
par for the tournament. No. 20 Fres
no State (289-274-285-848) and No.
1 Northwestern (285-278-290-853)
rounded out the top three.
"It was a great day for the team,"
head coach Wally Goodwin said af
terward. "Everyone was just rolling
along."
Individually, the Cardinal was
led by junior Jimmy Lee (71-70-69-
210), whose consistent play landed
him in a tie for fourth place overall.
Lee's impressive weekend at the
Nelson came less than two weeks
after carding a hole-in-one in an
Oct. 20 dual match against UC-
Davis.
"His game is completely under
control right now," Goodwin said.
Lee's score of three under par
was matched by Stanford freshman
Ron Won (75-66-69-210), whose
score did not count in the team com
petition because he played as an in
dividual. Won's second-round score
of 66 (-5) was the second-lowest
score in a single round for the entire
tournament.
Freshman Jim Seki (72-73-70-
215) also turned in a solid perfor

mance at the Nelson.
"Our younger guys are definitely
proving themselves," Goodwin
said. "[Won] and [Seki] playing so
well as freshmen shows how much
depth we've got."
The Cardinal rallied on Sunday
to erase a three-stroke deficit to sec
ond-round leaders Northwestern
and Fresno State. Junior Eric
Dahlberg (74-75-68-217) rebound
ed from two high rounds to lead the
Cardinal's final-round comeback.
"Eric's performance really got
everyone going," Goodwin said. "It
was actually very impressive to see
him bounce back from two disap
pointing rounds like he did."
Also playing well for Stanford
was senior captain Dusty Brett (73-
67-71-211), who finished in a tie for
10th place overall.
"Dusty was superior out there,"
Goodwin said. "He is definitely
turning out to be an incredible
leader for us this year."
Goodwin did not expect the
tournament victory but believed
that playing a tournament at home
would be a disadvantage for the
Cardinal.
"It is so much harder to keep
your concentration playing on your
own campus," he said. "It says a lot
about us that we were able to do it."
To this point. Goodwin has been
impressed with the way his team has
performed mentally.
"We don't ever lose our heads,
which is a key to being a great golf
team," he said.
With an almost three-month off
season approaching, the Stanford
squad will not compete or practice
as a team until mid-January. Team
members can work individually
with coaches and play in local tour
naments until the season resumes in
February.
