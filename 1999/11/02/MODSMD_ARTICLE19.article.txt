# Men's soccer looks to corral Broncos

### Meghan O'Connor Staff writer 
Although tonight's game against No. 13
Santa Clara (12-2-1) is not a conference match
for the Stanford men's soccer team (10-3-2). the
game will have far-reaching implications for the
upcoming NCAA tournament.
Last season both teams reached the semifi
nals of the NCAA Men's College Cup, and as
the season winds down this year, both teams are
eager to prove they have what it takes to make a

repeat appearance.

â–  Tonight: Stanford (10-3-2) at No. 13 Santa Clara
(12-2-1). 7:30 p.m.

In the past. Stanford has struggled with Santa
Clara, especially away, where the Broncos are
94-15-10 and N-I-0 this season. While the Cardi
nal beat Santa Clara 2-0 last year at New Mal
oney Field, two seasons ago Stanford suffered its
biggest defeat in the past four years, bowing 5-1

on Santa Clara turf.
"This is a great opportunity for this year's
team to make its own special piece of history,"
head coach Bobby Clark said on the rivalry with
the fellow Bay-Area squad.
Unfortunately, a victory tonight is easier said
then done. Santa Clara returns a West Coast
Conference-high seven all-league players from
last year's squad that tore through the NCAA
tournament.
