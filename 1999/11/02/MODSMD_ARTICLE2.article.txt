the indirect-cost scandal, which had lasting ramifications on the University
late into the decade.
In the fall of 1990, Stanford became the object of a federal investigation
when allegations arose that the University had overhilled the government for
indirect costs, money necessary to conduct research but not easily attributable
to a particular research project. Such costs include electricity, building de
preciation and use of the University library system.
Paul Biddle, a federal regulator based at Stanford and a representative of
the Office of Naval Research, charged that Stan ford overcharged the gov
ernment for indirect costs and that the University's actions amounted to
"abuse." the ONR consequently launched an investigation into Stanford's
practices, and federal investigations were underway. I'liis article originally
ran on Tuesday, (Jet. lb, 1991). It has been edited for length, flic full text oj

The stories noted that Paul Bid
die, a federal regulator based at
Stanford, had accused the Univer
sity of "fraud" and "abuse." and
that two federal investigations has
subsequently been launched.
The total cost of the alleged
wrongdoing, estimated at $3(K) mil
lion in the Times Tribune story -
but $2(H) million in some other
newspapers â€” was attributed to a
"congressional source," who asked
not to be identified.
In the following days, I University

surfaced that Stanford h;id over

indirect costs, a banner headline

tend to have winners and losers.
"This process mav not quit until it

said one Stanford administrator.
Concerns about Stanford's in
tegritv are being voiced at the same
time mail) in Washington arc attack
ing long standing government indi

rect-cost policies. As the federal
deficit has increased, government
regulators have become increasingly
alarmed about rising indirect-cost
rates at prominent research universi
ties nationwide.
Strained relations
At the same time, many in acade
mia feel the partnership between
government and universities that has
guided federal research policy for
decades is currently crumbling.
"There no longer exists in the
Congress or the Administration a
strong, shared vision of how and why
the federal government should sup
port research ... in universities," ac
cording to a December I WN draft of
a report by the American Associa
tion of I Jniversities. "As a result, the
underpinnings of the system ... have
come under increasing attack."
At the request of the 1 louse Sub
committee on (Kersight and Investi
gations. the CiAO is now examining
four universities as part of a larger
probe into federal indirect cost poli
cies.
While a staff member of the
I louse subcommittee said the CiAO
has had "no given criteria" for select
ing the universities it w ill investigate,
the reason Stanford was chosen is
quite clear. "Because we know of
problems with the indirect-cost rates
there." she said. Stanford, she said,
had overbilled the federal govern
ment by between $2(K) and $3(X) mil
lion over the last decade.
(hcrcliarging for libraries
More specifically. Stanford has
overcharged the government bv $50
million during the last decade for use
of I'niversit) libraries for research
purposes, the staff member said, and
offered details of how that figure had
been computed. I'niversit) adminis
trators have subsequently dismissed
the allegation of librarv overbilling as
"wav out of line" as well.
While the allegation of over
billing related to use of Stanford's li
braries represents just a fraction ol
the alleged wrongdoing, a closer look
at that particular charge highlights

many of the issues central to the fed
eral investigations.
indirect costs are those costs that
researchers incur that are not easily
attributable to a specific project. If a
researcher uses a Stanford library for
work on a federally sponsored re
search project, there is an indirect
cost incurred.
The fraction of the library's oper
ating budget that is necessary to sup
port that researcher's work is consid
ered a legitimate indirect cost, and
Stanford can be reimbursed bv the
government for that amount.
I aking such things into consider
ation, a University must project what
percentage of the operating expens
es of its libraries it believes will be
used to support research in upcom
ing years. I Estimates on library and
other indirect costs must be made in
advance so that researchers seeking
federal grants know what to ask for.
At Stanford, where the indirect
cost rate is 74 percent, a researcher
who wants to conduct $ 1 ()().()()()
worth of research must seek an addi
tional $74.(HH) from the government
to cover indirect costs. Stanford's
rate is among the highest in the na
tion.
Indirect-cost rate guidelines
The methodology used in project
ing indirect costs, including those at
tributed to the libraries, is outlined in
federal guidelines titled Circular A
-21.
The guidelines offer a standard
methodology for computing library
costs, but also allow institutions to
conduct a "special study" to deter
mine some aspects of its indirect
costs it the institution believes ii is
necessary. Stanford has conducted
several special studies, including one
with regard to use of its libraries.
Based on the special study, a
"memoranda of understanding" is
signed by the university and the gov
ernment representative assigned to
the university. The document in ef
fect replaces the section of the A-21
guidelines relevant to the study, and
is generally valid for several years.
In most areas. Circular A-21 pro
vides a great deal of this kind of flex

ibility. Hut that flexibility also creates
confusion.
"The system's intended flexibility
has allowed different universities to
interpret and adhere to the guide
lines in a myriad of ways." according
to the report of the Association of
American Universities. "The lack of
clarity has caused a great deal of fric
tion among Congress, sponsoring
agencies and universities."
Stanford's library study was origi
nally conducted in 1%5. I he basic
methodology of that study was then
utilized in three later studies, the
most recent going into effect in l l )S4.
The terms of the IIAS4l l AS4 study ex
pired in IWN. but are still used in cal
culaling indirect costs attributable to
the libraries, according to Byer.
There were plans to repeat the li
brary study in l l >B9. but that never
happened. Byer said. Concerns Bid
die raised about methodology de
railed the effort, according to Byer.
As ;i result, the library study has
"fallen between the cracks." Byer
said. "It's in this state of limbo now."
Byer said Biddle has been slow to
relate his specific concerns about the
methodology. Biddle has been un
available for comment.
According to University Con
troller Frank Riddle, one of the li
brary studies conducted in the early
lM7()s was rigorously reviewed by
both the ONR and the IX'AA. The
terms of the study that resulted were
the product of tough negotiations be
tween these agencies and Stanford
representatives. "We acquiesced on
a couple of elements." Riddle re
called.
When the 1984 study was com
pleted. however, the DCAA de
clined to audit its results. Riddle said.
A DCAA spokesman said he is not
at liberty to discuss issues relevant to
the ongoing investigations.
"Statistically flawed" data
In the meantime, Stanford contin
ues to use an unaudited study which
has since expired to calculate its li
brary cc >sts.
The Oversight and Investigations
subcommittee staff member who
spoke to The Daily said the library

studies Stanford has used are "statis
tieallv flawed" and "far tin) gener
ous" to Stanford.
The studies have allowed Stan
ford to charge the government "well
in excess of the A-21 guidelines." the
subcommittee staff member said.
"The government may have over
paid by $50 million on the library."
According to the subcommittee
staff member, the $50 million figure
comes from calculations made by
Diddle. She said her office obtained a
memo from the D( "A A backing Bid
die's overbilling figures for three
years: ! 9K4. 1985 and I9Bh.
A IX A A spokesman would nei
ther confirm nor deny that such a
memo exists.
According to the subcommittee
stall member, the IX'AA supported
the following assertions made by
Middle: that the government had
overpaid Stanford nn library costs by
$5 million in 1984, $5.4 million in
and $5.9 million in 1 9,X6. Using
these numbers. Middle then made
projections to include three other
years (1983. 1 1 >S7 and 1988). produc
ing an overbilling total of around $50
million for the period in question, she
said.
A substantial fraction
I'he alleged overbilling repre
sents a substantial fraction of the
total money Stanford has recovered
on library costs. In 1985. for example,
Stanford recovered $7.1 million in in
direct costs associated with libraries.
Middle is in effect questioning $5.4
million of that amount, according to
the data supplied by the subcommit
tee stall member.
I lie allegation "doesn't seem log
ieal to me." said Riddle.
Stanford does recover much more
on its library than do most universi
ties. Figures released by Stanford
show that over the past decade 7 per
cent of Stanford's indirect-cost rates
has been derived from library costs
each year.
Most universities library rates are
between two and four percentage
points, according to the Association
of American Universities report.
However, the report notes, a small

number of schools claim higher re
covery. based on special facilities or
patterns of use and library costs do
differ significantly from university to
university.
According to Riddle and other
University administrators, Stan
lord's indirect costs attributable to
the library are higher than other uni
versities primarily because "Stan
lord spends more on its libraries than
a lot of other institutions."
In his March 6 letter. Middle, the
ONR representative, referred to
"flaws in the special study of the li
brary." He concluded that due in
part to these alleged flaws, the "gov
ernment should scrutinize carefully
what has been agreed to in the past
before allowing these agreements to
bind us in the future."
More generally. Middle asserted
that Stanford should not be allowed
to enter into memoranda of under
standing with the government due to
past abuses: "I believe [memoranda
of understanding] should be institut
ed only for those institutions which
evidence a respect for the process
| and | do not distort the intent of gov
ernment."
/â– j I iter's Note: The U.S. I louse and
Senate ratified legislation that eapped
reimbursement for administrative
costs at 26 percent, leaving Stanford
with a potential budget deficit of $12
million. However, in September of
IWI, the government allowed clerical
salaries to be reimbursed for "major
projects," as long as the University
could tie those salaries directly to those
projects.
The lawsuit filed by Navy regulator
I'aul Middle on behalf of the U.S. gov
ernment was dismissed in court, as
were his appeals, which eventually
went to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Hiddle left the University at the end
of I ebruary of 1992, after the Univer
sity claimed that his lawsuit presented
a severe conflict of interests.
On Apriat 4, 1991, Kennedy
vowed that he would remain at Stan
ford until the situation was settled.
However, on July 29 of that year, he
stepped down from the presidency, ef
fective Aug. 31.1992.
