squads take second and third at the

The Cardinal took two teams of
eight to Canada to compete in the
meet, hosted by the University of

British Columbia. The Cardinal
men made a strong showing with
one team finishing second in overall
points and the other finishing in
third. British Columbia, the defend
ing Canadian national champion,
led the meet, finishing 10.5 points
ahead of Stanford.
Stanford coaches divided their 16
swimmers into two teams, making
the teams as balanced as possible.
"We tried to make our two teams
as equal as we could," said assistant
coach Ted Knapp. "Since we didn't
know which teams would be at the
meet, we thought that we'd at least
be able to compete against our
selves."
The international competition,
particularly British Columbia,
proved to be a definite challenge for
the Cardinal. Knapp said several
swimmers for IJBC will probably
contend for spaces on the Canadian
Olympic team.
Although Stanford may have fall
en short in overall points, it still won
and broke College Cup records in
many events.
Stanford broke College Cup
records in both the 200-meter relay
medley and the 400-freestyle relay.
Junior Rob Canales finished first
in a number of events, including the

200 individual medley, the 200
breaststroke and the 100 breast
stroke, breaking the previous Col
lege C'up record for the 1 (K) breast
stroke by .10 seconds.
Other record-breakers included
juniors Steven Brown and Adam
Messner in the 200 butterfly. Brown
also won his race in the 400 IM.
Freshman Randall Bal continued
to impress, winning both the 200
backstroke and the 50 freestyle. The
400 medley relay team also finished
first.
The Cardinal wasn't disappoint
ed in the second- and third-place fin
ishes overall; the team seemed to be
very excited about what the placings
indicate.
"The fact that we did so well with
our team divided up into two says
something about our depth," said se
nior co-captain and member of the
200 relay medley team Glenn

Counts.
"The team swam really well over
all. and the freshmen proved once
again that they're ready for the com
petition."
"We were very pleased with how
we did," Knapp said. "We had 16
guys who went up and were able to
compete very well. We could've put
a team together to win the meet, but
the most important thing was to
race."
The opportunity to travel also
pleased the team.
"This was our first team road
trip." Knapp said. "Everyone got to
learn about it during this trip, which
will make us ready for traveling for
dual meets in the winter."
The strong competition that it
faced in Vancouver will prepare the
Cardinal for what lies ahead — its
first home meet against No. 2 Texas
this Friday.
