# Northern Lights: Card swimmers take title
## 
### Mary Cobb Editorial staff 
Last week, Richard Quick, the
women's swim team head coach,
said that the purpose of taking the
women to Vancouver. Canada, was
to give them experience swimming
in a 25-meter pool, as opposed to a
25-yard pool.
Was he kidding? After this week
end, one might think that the
women have been training in a 25-
meter pool all along. A Canadian
record broken here, meet records
broken there, and wins in every

event were all on display

WOMEN'S SWIM

â–  Saturday-Sunday: Stanford wins
College Cup in Vancouver. B.C.

The meet opened with seniors
Catherine Fox and Gabrielle Rose
blazing through the first two legs of
the 200-meter medley relay. Junior
Misty Hyman and sophomore Siob
han Cropper took the race from
there (in the third and fourth legs,
respectively), with Cropper then
racing to the wall ahead of Washing
ton to give the team a time of 1
minute, 54.(i4 seconds, which broke
the C "anadian record of 1:55.86 set in
1 997 by the University of Calgary.
The joy of breaking the record
was felt by the four women, whether
they found out moments or days
after the record was broken. Fox's
joy was felt days after. ("We broke
the record? Well of course I am ex
cited about that.")
Hyman, who knew moments
after, explains that breaking the
record "was not so much of a sur
prise as was our performance."
Perhaps Hyman was surprised by
her own performances then. Not
only did she contribute to wins in
four relay events (the 2(K) and 400
medleys and the 200 and 400
freestyle medleys), she also won her
own four events and set meet
records in every one of them. Her
times of 2:01.29,2:10.15, 1:01.19 and
2:11.64 in the 200 free, 200 butterfly.
100 fly and 200 back, respectively,
were all fast enough to break the

meet records for each event.
While Hyman was "happy over
all" with her performances, and
while Quick thought her "2(H) per
formances were outstanding," she
said she could feel the difference in
the length of the pool. "My ap
proaches into the wall and turns
weren't as sharp." From the outside,
and from the record hooks, it looks
like she was sharp enough. But, for
someone like herself, who "has the
exact number of strokes in her
head," hitting the wall before or
after her expected stroke number
can be challenging. Yet. she knows
this experience was what is needed
for future meets such as the NCA As.
"1 now have a mental idea of
where my strokes need to be."
While Hyman was busy battling
the math of counting strokes, Fox
was being named "Outstanding Fe
male Athlete of the Meet" for her
performance in the KM) backstroke.
Fox's time of 1:00.33 was less than
two seconds off the world record of
58.5. Fox also won the 50 free and
the 1(X) free with times of 25.48 and
55.70, respectively, and was excited
about her opportunity to keep prac
ticing her 50 free.

"I am learning a lot of technical
aspects. The 50-meter is as short as it
gets, so you have to be perfect, or
else."
Rose, in addition to helping the
women break the Canadian record,
broke two meet records in the 200 in
dividual medley (2:14.89) and the
100 breaststroke (1:10.82) and won
the 2(H) breaststroke in a time of
2:36.94. Her participation in the win
ning 400- and 200-free relays also
significantly contributed to the Car
dinal win.
Shelly Ripple had an excellent
weekend, garnering a first-place fin
ish in Ihe 400 1M with a time of
4:49.23 (a meet record), two second
place finishes, in the 1 (K) back and
2(H) back, as well as a third-place fin
ish in the 200 flv, with a time of
2:13.31.
The Stanford freshmen also had
good outings, with Jessie Car plac
ing as high as third in the 800 free
with a time of 9:00.83, and then join
ing fellow freshman Amber Raisin
the 200-free relay to secure fifth
place.
Hyman is proud of the way the
freshmen are "stepping it up. They
are positive members of the team."
