# SIG jigs for new voters
## Project aims to 'encourage civic engagement' 
### Anthony Chiu Contributing writer 
A sign-wearing man dancing to an
Irish jig met people walking through
White Plaza around noon yesterday.
It wasn't a cultural performance, a
fraternity stunt or even a reprisal of
the Stanford Marching Band's infa
mous Notre Dame field show — just
a ploy to boost voter registration.
Stanford in Government brought
the dancer to bring attention to its
Voter 2000 registration project,
which will be in White Plaza again
today and tomorrow from 11 a.m.
until 1:15 p.m.
"We want to encourage civic en
gagement," said senior Daniel
Donovan, co-director of SlG's Cam

pus Awareness Committee. "There's
not much you can do without being
able to cast a vote."
Apathy has often reigned across
campus on the first Tuesday in No
vember.
Only 36 percent of registered vot
ers on campus voted at a Stanford
polling site in last year's election,
which featured prominent statewide
contests for governor and a U.S. Sen
ate seat.
Although SIG holds a voter regis
tration drive every year, it intensifies
efforts during presidential election
years.
"We will be hosting a panel of rep
resentatives of the main presidential
candidates [and] sending out infor
mational e-mails," said freshman

Meghana Reddy, who is the other co
director of the SIG Campus Aware
ness Committee.
SIG also plans to have discussions
tailored to specific groups on cam
pus. such as engineering students or
ethnic organizations, which will ad
dress issues that directly affect them
in the 2(XX) election.
The table in White Plaza has
forms for registering specifically in
Santa Clara County, but technology
has made it possible for some stu
dents who wish to vote in their home
states to use downloaded materials.

Form and other voter information
