# Biz School honors eight

### Irene Lu 
The Graduate School of Business
honored eight professors last month,
naming them to endowed chairs.
"An endowed chair is the highest
honor Stanford gives to a member of
its faculty," said Paul Romer. the new
STANCO 25 Professor of Econom
ics. "It also associates the recipient
with the name of an important donor
or group of donors."
The money given to the endowed
chairs funds salaries and research
and is used at the discretion of the
University, not the professors who
hold the endowed chairs. They re
ceive no part of the money and can
not direct its use.
The "recognition | is | more titular
than anything else," said Peter Reiss,
recipient of the newly created Busi
ness School MBA chair, though "it
differs across departments."
I le also said that "there is usually
a set number of endowed chairs, al
though it expands as people give
money."
In most cases, there is no limit to
the term ofthe chair. The named pro
fessor holds the chair at the discre

tion of the school until he or she de
cides to step down.
Michael T. Hannan is the first
holder of the Strata Com chair, the
other newly created chair besides the
Business School MBA chair. He is
credited with developing the field of
organizational ecology and is the co
director if the Stanford Project on
Emerging Companies, which has col
lected and analyzed human resource
data and practices from recent young
firms in Silicon Valley.
Reiss has also been named the
first MBA Class of 1%3 Professor of
Economics. The chair was estab
lished by the Class of 1963 in honor of
its 35th reunion and is the first in the
history of the Business School creat
ed by a graduating class.
Reiss seeks to identify and sepa
rate the impact of technological de
mand and strategic factors on market
concentration. He said he is "very
pleased to have received the award,"
and is "very grateful to the Class of
'63."
Other recipients of the endowed
chairs include Jonathan Bendor,
named the Walter and Elise Haas
Professor of Political Economics and

Organizations; J. Darrcll Duffie, the
James Irvin Miller Professor of Fi
nance; Haim Mendelson, the
Theodore J. Kreps Professor of In
formation Systems and Manage
ment.
Kreps' areas of research include
information-age organizations, fi
nancial markets, information tech
nology, liquidity, electronic networks
and information industries. He said
his new chair is a "good match to my
research areas" and that winning it
was "a nice thing, not a major event
for me, but nice recognition and sort
of like a promotion."
Others include Margaret A.
Neale, the John G. McCoy-Banc
One Corporation Professor of Orga
nizations and Dispute Resolution;
Itamar Sinonson, the new Sebastian
S. Kresge Professor of Marketing;
and Romer.
Business School Dean Robert
Joss and former Dean Michael
Spence chose the recipients. Joss said
endowed chairs "are reserved for
tenured full professors who have
made substantial contributions to the
reputation of the Graduate School of
Business."
