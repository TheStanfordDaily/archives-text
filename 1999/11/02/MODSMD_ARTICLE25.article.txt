award-winning essay, at S p.m. to

Auditorium.
"Amitav Ghosh is a superb
writer, an important thinker, a ver
satile creator who has produced nov
els, essays, historical anthropology
and serious journalism of the highest
quality," said I.inda Hess, a lecturer
in Religious Studies and one of the
organizers of the event.
"He is one of a handful of writers
from India who have become major
figures in international literary cul
ture in the last few decades," she
continued. "Students should meet
and hear such people."
The lecture was organized
through the efforts of the faculty
working group of the South Asia Ini
tiative, which consists of Hess, Insti
tute of International Studies Con
sulting Prof. Rafiq Dossani, History

Anthropology Asst. Prof. Purninia

Consulting Prof. Armin Rosen
cranz.
In meeting early this summer to
discuss their goals, the group began
outlining a plan to increase pro
gramming in South Asian studies
and to promote South Asian aware
ness at Stanford.
"One idea we agreed on was to
have one outstanding speaker per
quarter who would represent a very
high level of quality and interest and
would thus raise awareness and ex
citement about [South Asia] at Stan
ford," said Hess.
Since the South Asia Initiative
did not yet have funds set aside for
the first event of this series, they
raised money for the lecture by cre
ating a network of co-sponsors, as
well as entering into a cooperative
arrangement with UC-Berkeley,
which will have the same lecture on

Nov. 4 and contribute to the expens
es of the lecture.
The list of co-sponsors includes:
Stanford's Religious Studies Dept.,
the Creative Writing Program, the
Humanities Center, the Compara
tive Literature Dept., the Asian Re
ligions and Cultures Initiative, the
Asian American Studies Dept.,

and Sanskriti.
"The other major piece," said
Hess, "is that Prof. Dossani spoke
with some members of the Indian
community about our efforts. Mr.
K.B. Chandrashekhar, chair of Exo
dus Communications, Inc., was in
terested in supporting this endeavor
with a generous gift."
Hess also mentioned that com
munity groups beyond the Universi
ty. such as the Society for Cultural
Heritage of India, have been instru
mental in publicizing the event.
Hess and others stressed the im
portance of the event encouraging
South Asian studies at Stanford.
"1 hope this event will be a vivid
marker of the beginning of a new era
at Stanford," said Hess.
"Alter long neglect, the impor
tance of South Asia is being recog
nized. This importance extends
across many fields — political, eco
nomic, cultural, historical. I hope
that students at Stanford will |have
increasing) opportunities to learn
about South Asia and that the insti
tution will solidify the commitment
that has begun tentatively with the
South Asia Initiative."
Comparative Literature Assoc.
Prof. David Palumbo-Liu. who
teaches Ghosh's novel "The Shad
ow Lines" in a number of his classes,
concurred.
"In particular, Ghosh's work will
address a huge gap in Stanford's cur
riculum and research profile —
South Asia and South Asian Dias
pora studies —areas of immense sig
nificance, especially here in Silicon
Valley," he said.
Educated primarily at Oxford
and Delhi universities, Ghosh has
taught in a variety of areas, including
anthropology, sociology and South
Asia at Delhi University, University

Palumbo-Liu said of Ghosh,
"[He] is one of the most important
and engaging literary figures in the
world today... Intensely historical
and imaginative, his essays and nov
els ... treat the intense contradic
tions between increased cultural flu
idity and hybridity and the co-exis
tence of old and new traditions that
confound and excite our contempo

have one outstanding speaker per
quarter who would represent a very
high level of quality and interest and
would thus raise awareness and ex
citement about [South Asia] at Stan
ford," said Hess.
Since the South Asia Initiative
did not yet have funds set aside for
the first event of this series, they
raised money for the lecture by cre
ating a network of co-sponsors, as
well as entering into a cooperative
arrangement with UC-Berkeley,
which will have the same lecture on

Nov. 4 and contribute to the expens
es of the lecture.
The list of co-sponsors includes:
Stanford's Religious Studies Dept.,
the Creative Writing Program, the
Humanities Center, the Compara
tive Literature Dept., the Asian Re
ligions and Cultures Initiative, the
Asian American Studies Dept.,
Modern Thought and Literature
and Sanskriti.
"The other major piece," said
Hess, "is that Prof. Dossani spoke
with some members of the Indian
community about our efforts. Mr.
K.B. Chandrashekhar, chair of Exo
dus Communications, Inc., was in
terested in supporting this endeavor
with a generous gift."
Hess also mentioned that com
munity groups beyond the Universi
ty. such as the Society for Cultural
Heritage of India, have been instru
mental in publicizing the event.
Hess and others stressed the im
portance of the event encouraging
South Asian studies at Stanford.
"1 hope this event will be a vivid
marker of the beginning of a new era
at Stanford," said Hess.
"Alter long neglect, the impor
tance of South Asia is being recog
nized. This importance extends
across many fields — political, eco
nomic, cultural, historical. I hope
that students at Stanford will |have
increasing) opportunities to learn
about South Asia and that the insti
tution will solidify the commitment
that has begun tentatively with the
South Asia Initiative."
Comparative Literature Assoc.
Prof. David Palumbo-Liu. who
teaches Ghosh's novel "The Shad
ow Lines" in a number of his classes,
concurred.
"In particular, Ghosh's work will
address a huge gap in Stanford's cur
riculum and research profile —
South Asia and South Asian Dias
pora studies —areas of immense sig
nificance, especially here in Silicon
Valley," he said.
Educated primarily at Oxford
and Delhi universities, Ghosh has
taught in a variety of areas, including
anthropology, sociology and South
Asia at Delhi University, University
of Virginia at Charlottesville, Co

lumbia University and University of
Pennsylvania, among others.
Ghosh, who speaks English, Ben
gali. Hindi, French and Arabic, pub
lished his first article, "Ethnology,"
in 1984. Since then, Ghosh has writ
ten more than 25 articles in such
publications as The New Yorker,
The New York Times, The New Re
public and Granta. His piece, "The
Ghosts of Mrs. Gandhi," which was
published in the July 17.1995 issue of
The New Yorker, was honored as
one of a group of the Best American
Essays.
This year, "The March of the
Novel through History: The Testi
mony of my Grandfather's Book
case," the essay on which Ghosh s
lecture will be based, won the presti
gious Pushcart Prize.
In addition to this, Ghosh has
also published a number of books.
His novels, "The Circle of Reason"
and"In An Antique Land," were
recognized as notable books of the
year by the New York Times in 1987
and 1990, respectively. "The Calcut
ta Chromosome," another of
Ghosh's novels, is currently under
film contract with Gabriele Salva
tores, the Oscar-winning director of
"Mediterraneo."
"The Shadow Lines," Ghosh's
second novel, was awarded the an
nual prize of the Sahitya Akademi
(the Indian Academy of Literature)
in 1990 and the Ananda Puraskar,
which he won in his birthplace of
Calcutta.
Ghosh is currently on contract
with Random House to publish a
new book entitled "Countdown,"
which concerns the nuclear situation
facing India and Pakistan."
Palumbo-Liu said of Ghosh,
"[He] is one of the most important
and engaging literary figures in the
world today... Intensely historical
and imaginative, his essays and nov
els ... treat the intense contradic
tions between increased cultural flu
idity and hybridity and the co-exis
tence of old and new traditions that
confound and excite our contempo
rary age."
Ghosh will also speak in Mancall
and Gupta's Modern India class at 9
a.m. on Thursday.
