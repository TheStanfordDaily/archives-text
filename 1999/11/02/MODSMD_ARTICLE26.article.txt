Ben and Jcrrv don't have much in
common with Richard Holbrooke.
Ditto for Danny Glover and Ray
Bradbury.
But the ice cream guys, the diplo
mat, the actor and the author all have
one thing in common: they helped the
ASSI I Speakers Bureau accomplish
what senior ( heryl (ialvin, the direc
tor, calls its goal: "bringing all differ
ent kinds of speakers to campus."
Tonight, the Speakers Bureau will
bring John Douglas — FBI veteran,
former head of its Investigative Sup
port I Jnit and the pioneer of criminal
profiling — to campus.
Douglas, the model for the FBI
character Scott Glenn in " The Si
lence of the Lambs," is the most re

cent speaker in a long line of promi
nent and interesting men and women
from all across the country that the
Bureau has invited to Stanford.
The Speakers Bureau brings an
average of six speakers per year, two
each quarter.
"Because Stanford is so well-fund
ed and has a very high-profile name,
we can attract really amazing and in
teresting speakers from across the
I J.S. and the world," said sophomore
Shannon Baker, the assistant director
of the Speakers Bureau. "Experts in
their fields, be it electronics, peace
keeping, or business . . . all have
something valuable to add to the
broader education of students."
The Bureau attracts its speakers
through its wide variety of contacts
with agents, Galvin said. If a speaker
is not represented by an agent, the

group works through personal con
nections or company contacts.
Speakers are chosen by a majority
vote among the Bureau's approxi
mately 25 active members.
In the future. Galvin hopes to con
figure the Speakers Bureau Website
so that the student body can offer
input on the speakers who are invited
to campus, perhaps in the form of vot
ing.
Galvin shares her responsibilities
with her assistant director, financial
officers and publicity and events di
rectors.
The financial officers are instru
mental in organizing the Speakers
Bureau co-sponsorships. Galvin ex
plained that the Bureau often co
sponsors speakers that other campus
groups, who may not have the funds
that the Speakers Bureau does.

would like to bring to Stanford.
"I think that the Speakers Bureau,
like many other organizations on
campus, allows Stanford students to
take an active role in organizing com
munity events and assuming leader
ship positions," said Baker, who was
the events and publicity director last
year.
Junior Mike Kass. who was the di
rector of the Bureau last year, called
working his job "a tremendous expe
rience." Hie highlight of his year was
bringin I lolbrooke to campus amidst
crises in the Balkans and the im
peachment hearings.
This year's highlights have yet to
be determined, as no speakers have
been scheduled for the winter quar
ter. White House correspondent
Helen Thomas, however, has been
confirmed as a speaker for this spring.
