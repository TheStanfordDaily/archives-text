Stanford administrators have
launched a video component to the
University's World Wide Web site
in an effort to entice more high
school students to apply lor admis
sion.
The professionally produced
video, featured on Stanford's un
dergraduate and graduate admis
sions Web sites, plays in Real
Video format and consists of stu
dent profiles as well as a descrip
tion of Stanford's goals and unique
features.
The 13-minute clip also high
lights the University's small class
sizes and distinguished faculty.
Some students believe the video
is a response to the declining num
ber of students applying for under
graduate admission.
The total number of students
who applied to Stanford dropped
from 18,888 in 1998 to 17,919 in
1999. According to Robert Kinnal
ly, dean of undergraduate admis
sions and financial aid, many stu
dents may have decided not to
apply after the 13-percent accep
tance rate in 1998.
Kinnally said some students
may have been reluctant to apply
in light of Proposition 209, the 1996
ballot measure that banned affir
mative action in California. Al
though the Proposition affects the
University of California admis

sions process, students may have
mistakenly associated this legisla
tion with Stanford as well, Kinnally
said.
Kinnally brushed off criticism
about the video's motive. "What's
wrong with recruiting?" he asked.
"We want the best and brightest
students. Our admissions process
hasn't changed, only now we can
utilize the Web."
Many prospective students
choose to apply to a university on
"instinct" or based on word-of
mouth, Kinnally said. The video is
the admissions office's way of pro
viding a more complete picture of
Stanford for both prospective and
admitted students.
"T he video gives applicants a
glimpse of Stanford," he said, "and
encourages those who feel that
'Stanford doesn't want me' to
apply."
In addition to the video, the ad
missions office visits a limited num
ber of cities each year and sends
applications to approximately
56.000 students on their mailing
list. Students with top GPAs and
above-average SAT scores may
also receive mail.
The admissions Web site con
tains information that includes fre
quently-asked-questions and an
estimated financial aid calculator.
B\ using the Web and the newly
produced video, Kinnally hopes to
"net the word out."
