# Solar Car strikes out on its own
## 
### Udara Fernando 
After a three-year, cross-Bay
marriage, the Stanford Solar Car
Project is single again.
While preparing for the World
Solar Challenge in 19%, the Stanford
Solar Car Project and UC-Berke
ley's "Calsol" officially merged to
form "Team California."
This year, the Stanford Solar Car
Project embarks — on its own — to
design, construct and race a com
pletely new solar-powered vehicle
made for global competition.
Backed by more than a decade of
racing experience and strengthened
by dozens of new recruits, the team is
currently in the process of research
ing and designing what will be Stan
ford Solar's fourth-generation solar
powered vehicle.
"We aren't rebuilding because we
were disappointed with our last car,"
explained last year's project leader,
senior Alex Tung.
The Afterburner series of Stan
ford solar cars were some of the top
ranked collegiate solar cars in the
world, placing in The World Solar
Challenge (1 ,S(K) miles across Aus
tralia), Sunrayce (a 1,300-mile
course across the United States) and
the MA Electro-Cup (at the Suzuka
Circuit in Suzuka, Japan).
In light of such success, the moti
vation to build a new car seeks not so
much to improve performance as to
unleash the team's creativity.
"We've been working with similar
designs for over five years, and we
want to try something new," ex
plained team member Joel Segre, a
sophomore. "We feel it's time to
niake the jump from evolutionary
design to revolutionary design."
Constructing a car that exceeds 70
mph on the power of a souped-up
kitchen toaster is no easy task. Fortu
nately. the team is able to draw on re
sources. both local and distant, to ac
complish its goals.
"The University is phenomenally
supportive of the project," said Bran
don Stafford, a Pomona graduate

who majored in English, now turned
Stanford mechanical engineering
master's student.
Not only does the I Jniversity offer
access to computing and machine
shop resources, but also expert con
sultation from professors such as the
project's sponsor. Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education John
Bravman.
In addition, the student body con
tributes to the team through a yearly
infusion of $30,801 from ASSU spe
cial fees, which cover roughly 20 per
cent of the project's costs.
The vast ma jorin of the space-age
supplies used in the project, howev
er. come from off-campus sources.
The project would not survive with
out sponsorships from industry lead
ers such as Hexeel. Boeing. General
Plasties, Reynolds Aluminum.
Robin Materials and Airtech.
Through sponsors such as these,
students working on the project not
only develop networks of contacts in
industry, but also gain first-hand ex

perienee working with sonic of the
hottest engineering products on
today's market.
"Working with cutting-edge tech
nologies means there isn't always a
model for us to follow: often we are
on our own to devise new approach
es and solutions to the engineering
challenges we face." said junior Nate
Ginzton, this year's project leader.
Stanford Solar's aggressive and
innovative approach is common to
the solar racing community. Solar
cars push the limits ol existing tech
nologies by their very nature, often
allowing their innovations to trickle
down into mainstream consumer
products.
Solar racer technology has also
heavily influenced the design of
GM's f'Vl. an electric vehicle with
the lowest aerodynamic drag of any
production automobile ever.
Solar racers' needs for uncompro
mised racing performance have also
encouraged research and develop
ment of cheaper, more efficient pho

tovoltaics. as well as ever-lighter and
stronger building materials.
After gaining familiarity with the
most current of design and construc
tion techniques, many Stanford Solar
alumni go on to lead successful ca
reers iti engineering-related areas
and beyond.
Dorian West, a pioneer of Stan
ford Solar, currently works at Edge
Innovations, where he helped build a
full-scale, swimming, robotic killer
whale for the movie "Free Willy." as
well as a number ol robotic sharks for
the movie "Deep Blue Sea."
West still maintains that the Stan
lord Solar Car Project is the most ex
citing engineering project he has ever
worked with.
The Stanford Solar Car Project is
open to students of all classes and
majors. More information is avail
