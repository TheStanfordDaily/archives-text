MEN'S CROSS COUNTRY

■ Friday-Sunday: Stanford takes
second at Pacific 10 Conference
championship meet.

Sixth-ranked . Arizona claimed
ihc Pac-10 championship in Satur
day's meet in Lcfljtg Beach, Calif.,
with a mildly stunning upset of the
No. 2 C ardinal, scoring 36 points to
Stanford's 63. Otaegon was third
with 76.
I loping to av<uithc mistake of
running too agdrasively early in
the race, the Staflnrd men went out
very conservatively. There were no
Cardinal jerseys in the top 10
through two miles, though senior
Jake Maas and junior Thomas Mur
ley were definitely in the mix.
The pack split suddenly when
Oregon's Steve Fein and Micheil
Jones bolted for the lead, taking

Arizona's Fasil Bizuneh with them.
Before the Cardinal runners could
respond, Jones, Fein and Bizuneh
had pulled away from the rest of the
field.
"I think we went out too aggres
sively at the Oct. 16 Pre-national
race, and I think they tried to com
pensate for that here," said head
coach Vin Lananna. "They may
have overcompensated, assuming
that the race was just going to fall
into place for them. When it didn't,
we just didn't respond well."
# While the leaders continued to
separate from the field, Stanford ju
nior Jonathon Riley, who was ex
pected to contend for the title, was
mired near 20th position.
"According to Jonathon, he had
some kind of heat problems,"
Lananna said. "He was very mus
cle-tense and tight — somewhat de
hydrated is my guess. He said he
felt crummy from the mile out."
Stanford's other competitors —
junior Michael Slember, sopho
mores Gabe Jennings and Jamey
Gilford and freshman Adam Ten
forde — also lost contact with the
lead pack after the split.
Over the last two miles, Stan
ford's runners made a final valiant
charge to reclaim the race, which

was unmistakably under Arizona's ♦
control.
*
Maas chased the leaders with ,
Murley not far behind, while Riley k
regained some composure and ';
hunted down those still in his sights. *j
Tenforde made a powerful surge;,
that propelled him up next to Riley 1
for a short time.
But a win was just not in order's
for Stanford. Tenforde
with 4(X) meters to go and was un-;j
able to finish the race. Maas fin- V
ished third (23 minutes, 58.7 sec- *
onds) behind Fein (23:37.0, a 1
course record) and Jones (23:48.9),,"
while Murley crossed in sixth place -'
(24:10.1). By the time Riley fin-.'
ished in 13th place (24:42.1), Ari-' ?
zona's top five were across the line,
sealing their victory.
Jennings and Gifford finished V
fourth and fifth out of the
squad in 20th (25:02.9) and 2lst\
(25:07.0), respectively. Stember's )
25:17.8 placed him 24th.
Lananna refused to use the 90- •
plus degree heat as an excuse for his
troops. 'J.
"1 don't think the conditions had,;
anything to do with it," Lananna>*|
said. "Arizona just did a great job of?
packing up and running aggressive-^
ly." A
