# Minority admits drop
## Med School trend may be linked to Prop. 209 
### Melissa Lambert 
Stanford Medical School's mi
nority enrollment is down from last
year, a decrease some observers
blame on California voters.
1 he 6-percent enrollment drop
at Stanford mirrors a decrease in
minority applications in California
often connected to Proposition
209.
A private institution. Stanford is
not affected directly by Prop. 209.
the 19% measure that banned affir
mative action in all governmental
institutions in California. The mea
sure ended "preferential treatment
to a group on the basis of race. sex.
ethnicity, color or national origin."
Yet the Stanford Medical
School still admits a higher rate of
underrepresented minorities than
applicants as a whole, showing
their commitment to "identifying,
recruiting and matriculating quali
fied minority students." according
to the Medical School's Web site.
Despite this, researchers specu
late that the publicity over the pass
ing of Prop. 2(H) may have discour
aged minority applicants from con
sidering Stanford.
The bill had "a chilling effect on
minorities and sent word to the
country that California is not a
friendly place for minorities," said
Dr. Phyllis Gardner, senior assoc.
dean for education and student af
fairs. Nearly half of a 7-percent na
tionwide drop in minority appli
cants came from four states with re
cent bans on affirmative action â€”

Texas. California. Mississippi and
I .ouisiana.
After Prop. 20 l > passed in IW6.
I Iniversity of California schools ex
perienced a 30-percent decline in
minority admissions.
"A lot of very good medical
school applicants come from |UC]
schools." said Director of Medical
School Admissions Gabriel Gar
cia. "We are concerned that it will
eventually affect the number of mi
nority applicants here."
Underrepresented minorities
make up 14 percent of the current
Stanford medical school class of

2002. a similar figure to past years.
In IWN. however, underrepresent
ed minorities made up 20 percent
of the class.
Stanford is working hard to at
tract minorities to the medical pro
fession by offering high school and
college-level summer programs
aimed at economically disadvan
taged minorities interested in
health-care professions.
The programs, started by two
Stanford students in 1987. give stu
dents a first-hand introduction to

the medical profession. Attended
by students all over the country,
they include lectures on health and
science, hospital field demonstra
tions and one-on-one sessions with
medical school mentors. In addi
tion, students receive help filling
out their college and medical
school applications.
Senior Kenya Pinder, co-chair
of the Stanford Black Pre-Medical
Organization, has not heard any
minorities at Stanford voice con
cern about medical school admis

sion because of Proposition 209,
hut she said the measure has de
terred out-of-state friends from ap
plying to the Medical School.
She believes the bill gave Cali
fornians a stigma that the state's
schools aren't in favor of minori
ties. Her organization hosts panel
discussions with medical students
and faculty and encourages
African-American students to
"continue in their dream to be doc
tors and not be deterred by what
they see around them."
The Proposition hasn't deterred
Pinder, who is currently applying
to medical schools regardless of af
firmative action policies.
