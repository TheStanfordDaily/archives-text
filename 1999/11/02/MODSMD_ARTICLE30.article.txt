WOMEN'S
CROSS COUNTRY

■ Friday-Sunday: Stanford wins Pa
cific 10 Conference title.

After leading for the first 4,(XX)
meters of the S,(XX) meter race at Sat
urday's Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, Stanford junior
Julia Stamps succumbed the 90-de
gree heat of El Dorado Park in Long
Beach, Calif. With little over 400 me
ters to go, she could not continue.
But the Cardinal did.
Where most teams would have
given up — or, more likely, where
most teams would have simply been
outgunned—Stanford did not a miss
a beat. 7"hough Stamps began to
fade, a Cardinal uniform was always
in front. Freshman Erin Sullivan
took the torch and sprinted to the
win with a time of 17 minutes, one
second, Stanford's first individual
victory at Pac-lOs and the school's

fourth-straight team title.
Stanford's tally of 32 points was
30 better than second-place Arizona
State and 38 ahead of third-place
Washington.
From the sound of the air horn
that signaled the start, Stanford took
control of the race with Stamps as the
pacesetter. After a half-mile, Stamps
established a 10-meter lead on Ari
zona frontrunner Tara Chaplin. The
next four runners at that point where
all in Cardinal red — senior Mary
Huang, Sullivan, senior Sally Glynn
and freshman Lauren Fleshman.
The trend continued throughout
the race, with Stamps going through
the mile in 5:10 followed by Tara
Chaplin and then Sullivan (5:14),
Glynn, Fleshman and Huang.
"I felt good," Sullivan said about
the start of the race. "It was definite
ly really hot and my mouth was real
ly dry, but it just sort of developed. I
went out and wanted to close the gap
between Julia and I, and I wanted to
run with Julia. Eventually it unfold
ed. 1 didn't lose contact with her."
Sullivan closed in on Stamps over
the terrain of the second mile, going
through the two-mile marker just a
second behind Stamp's split of 10:34.
Glynn and Fleshman were next
across the marker in 10:43 and 10:46.

Huang was fighting for 10th in 10:56.
"I knew it was going to be a pret
ty fast race," Glynn said after she fin
ished as runner-up. "1 was prepared
for that. Our team really wanted to
run as a pack. We knew that it was
going to be a good competition with
Washington and a couple of other
schools, but we were confident we
were going to move up to the front."
Heading into the final mile it cer
tainly did not look as if sophomore
Laura Turner, Stanford's sixth run
ner throughout most of the race, was
going to factor in the final scoring.
Her strong finish did count, though,
when Stamps dropped out. Behind
the 1-2-3 finish of Sullivan, Glynn
and Fleshman and Huang's gutsy
12th-place finish. Turner crossed the
line in 14th to secure the victory.
"I didn't see her [drop out],"
Turner said regarding Stamps. "1
didn't know at all — I thought 1 was
our sixth runner today. I just hung in
there that last quarter mile. [I J didn't
think 1 had much left, but 1 was able
to catch a few people in there.
"Our team is not just ohe person.
We are 26 people on this team. It is a
much more comfortable and confi
dent feeling going into the end of the
season knowing its not all dependent
on you."
