decisions you can make — who you
work for." Tozun said.
"Stanford people can help cor
porations make massive profits,
but if |the companies) felt that they

them where it counts," Tozun said.
Disnev recruiters said they
could not respond to the specific al
legations but agreed that they value
Stanford students as prospective
employees.

we can't always go to all campuses,
but we always focus on Stanford."
