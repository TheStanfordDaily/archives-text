# Ensemble concert far from ordinary
## 
### Irene Lu 
From the very beginning, it was
no ordinary concert.
On the heels of the Stanford
Wind Fnsemble's entrance into the 8
p.m. Halloween concert, conductor
(iianearlo Aquilanti — dressed as a
jester in purple and black satin —
cartwheeled onto the stage and held
up the sign, "applaud."
Aquilanti then turned the sign
over, and it became "Kiss me. I'm
Italian." drawing cheers from the
Dinkclspicl Auditorium crowd. Not
to be outdone, ensemble members
gave up their ordinary concert black
and donned a wild troupe of cos
tumes.
And then of course there was the
white vampire chihuahua that stayed
on stage throughout the hour-long
concert.
I"he concert, an annual Stanford
ritual, kicked off with "Tango" and
"Paso Doubla a la Corrida." (both
from Second Suite for Band. 1975)
accompanied by clarinet player
Anne Terry, a junior, and junior
trumpet player Franzo Law ll's
wait/ to the music.
Next, the music of "Mission Im
possible" featured two secret agents
trying to plant a pack of dynamite in
back of the conductor's podium.
I uckilv. they were shot by one of the
ensemble members before the bomb
went off.
Then. Aquilanti went backstage
and re-appeared as the Phantom
from "Phantom of the Opera." com
plcte with hall-mask, to conduct An
drew Loyd Webber's famous piccc.
In tunc to the piece, the Phantom
chased his Christine and finally
wooed her by forking out some cash.
After that. Aquilanti left and re

turned as Darth Vadcr, conducting
"Star a lightsaber.
Vicc Provost James VI on toy a and
the St. Lawrence String Quartet's
Lesley Robinson judged the costume
contest, where the winner got to con
duct the night's last piece, "The Lib
erty Bell March (1930)."
The lour final contestants includ
ed a caveman, Dolly Part on and her

consort, an alien and his green-haired
silver-wearing girl and the Grim
Reaper.
Winner? The eight-foot tall Grim
Reaper, who was a great conductor,
moving jauntily to the music.
The Wind Ensemble's next con
cert will be Nov. 14 in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium at S p.m. It, of course, will
lack cartwheels.
