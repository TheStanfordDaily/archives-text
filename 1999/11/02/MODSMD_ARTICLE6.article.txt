# Ensemble concert far from ordinary
## 
### Irene Lu 
From the very beginning, it was
no ordinary concert.
On the heels of the Stanford
Wind Fnsemble's entrance into the 8
p.m. Halloween concert, conductor
(iianearlo Aquilanti — dressed as a
jester in purple and black satin —
cartwheeled onto the stage and held
up the sign, "applaud."
Aquilanti then turned the sign
over, and it became "Kiss me. I'm
Italian." drawing cheers from the
Dinkclspicl Auditorium crowd. Not
to be outdone, ensemble members
gave up their ordinary concert black
and donned a wild troupe of cos
tumes.
And then of course there was the
white vampire chihuahua that stayed
on stage throughout the hour-long
concert.
I"he concert, an annual Stanford
ritual, kicked off with "Tango" and
"Paso Doubla a la Corrida." (both
from Second Suite for Band. 1975)
accompanied by clarinet player
Anne Terry, a junior, and junior
trumpet player Franzo Law ll's
wait/ to the music.
Next, the music of "Mission Im
possible" featured two secret agents
trying to plant a pack of dynamite in
back of the conductor's podium.
I uckilv. they were shot by one of the
ensemble members before the bomb
went off.
Then. Aquilanti went backstage
and re-appeared as the Phantom
from "Phantom of the Opera." com
