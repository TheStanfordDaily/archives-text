## Coast Guard still has no clues about Egypt Air crash 
### 
NEWPORT, R.l. (AP) — Coast
Guard search crews gave up hope
Monday of finding anyone alive
from Egypt Air Flight 990 but found
a large piece of wreckage and detect
ed a signal believed to be from one of
the plane's "black boxes."
II Navy divers can retrieve the
flight data recorder and cockpit
voice recorder from the Atlantic
ocean floor off Nantucket, the
devices could provide vital clues for
investigators who as yet have no
explanation for the crash.
Jim I fall, chairman of the Nation
al Transportation Safety Board, cau
tioned that the investigation
already involving more than 500
people — could be long. And he said

the hunt for the black boxes would
be difficult.
"Remember that we are dealing
with water 250 feet deep, and recov
ering and locating small objects like
recorders is a daunting effort." he
s iid at search headquarters in New
port.
Because terrorism has not been
ruled out, the FBI said it is sending
bomb experts and other investiga
tors to Newport. But authorities
stressed there was no evidence of
foul play.
"Nothing has been ruled in. noth
ing has been ruled out." President
Bill Clinton said in Oslo. Norway,
where he was attending Middle East
peace talks.

The Cairo-bound Boeing 767 was
carrying 217 people when it plunged
into the Atlantic from 33,(XX) feet
high early Sunday, a half-hour after
leaving New York's Kennedy Air
port. The plane went down without a
distress call or any other indication
of trouble from the pilots.
Among the passengers were
about 30 Egyptian military officers,
mostly pilots who had been training
in the United States. Pentagon
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said.
The passengers also included 106
Americans, including 54 people
bound for a two-week trip it) Egypt
and the Nile.
The debris collected so far
some of it by student sailors from the

U.S. Merchant Marine Academy —
includes shoes, purses and teddy
bears.
"It basically looked like some
body had emptied their trash Dump
ster," said one of sailors. C hris kin
caid.
None of the retrieved debris has
any burn marks that might indicate a
fire or explosion, search officials said.
The Coast Guard, fearing bad
weather on Tuesday, stepped up its
search for debris and human
remains. Officials admitted a new
phase of the operation had begun.
"It is in everyone's best interest it)
no longer expect we will find sur
vivors," said Coast Guard Rear
Adm. Richard M. Larrabee.

Larrabee, speaking 35 hours after
the crash, said the decision was based
partly on the chilly water. The aver
age life expectancy in water of 5X
degrees is five to six hours.
Searchers found what Larrabee
called a "significant piece" of the air
craft. large enough to require a
crane. They also located a signal,
most likely one of the plane's black
boxes, while scouring the search area
south of Nantucket.
The Navy will use underwater
sonar equipment to try to pinpoint
the wreckage and the black boxes.
The USS Grapple, a sonar
equipped salvage ship that helped
retrieve wreckage from the 19%
crash of TWA Flight K(X) off Long

Island and the 199K crash of Swissair
Flight 111 off Nova Scotia, was
expected to arrive from Virginia on
Tuesday.
"We have a very difficult job in
terms of the recovery ahead," said
Hall, noting that Flight 99() crashed
in water twice as deep as [ : light N(X).
As of midday Monday, only one
body had been recovered, but
Larrabee said searchers had "begun
to see evidence of further human
remains." I le would not elaborate.
Flights were being arranged to
carry victims' relatives to Rhode
Island so they could be close to the
search operation. Dozens of grief
counselors from the Red Cross and
other organizations were on hand.
