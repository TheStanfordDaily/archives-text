Announcing A Unique Opportunity for Summer 2000:
2000
LE II
AWARDS
Thanks to a special alumni gift, the Vice Provost for Undergraduate
; Education is pleased to offer special research and travel grants for the
summer of 2000, open to Stanford undergraduates of all years and
majors. Called the "Beagle II Awards," these grants will be awarded to the
best three proposals for a summer's "voyage" of scientific discovery anywhere in the world. Applications are now available in
the Vice Provost's Office (Bldg 1, second floor), in Anthropological Sciences (Bldg 110, Km 112 D), in the Human Biology
Office (Bldg 80), and on-line (see URL below). Applications are due no later than 5:00 PM on Friday, December 3, to the
Vice Provost's Office (Bldg 1, second floor). Students may apply individually oi with another undergraduate. Awards will be
announced by Wednesday afternoon, January 12, 2000. The applications ask for a proposed itinerary of study and travel (it
need not be by ship), together with a statement of the ways in which a self-styled Beagle voyage would contribute to the appli
cants' education in natural and/or social sciences. Applications will be screened by an interdisciplinary committee. The Beagle
II grant provides $3500 that can be used toward travel and study costs plus summer earnings offset.
Questions not addressed by the application packet can be directed to Jenise Christenscn in the Vice Provost's Office
