Businesses, governments and in
dividuals all have an obligation to
work for global human rights. Unit
ed Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights and former Presi
dent <>l Ireland Mary Robinson said
in .1 speech yesterday at Kresge Au
ditorium.

"Human rights begin in a very
true sense at home." Robinson said.
"Human rights are not something
far away — it's in your own neigh
borhoods and communities."
Political Science Prof. David
Holloway, director of the Institute
for International Studies, intro
duced Robinson as someone "giving
voice to the victims of repression

and discrimination" with a "power
ful ... combination of voice and vi
sion."
Robinson emphasized to the
crowd of about 4(H) that "human
rights is the responsibility of all
United Nations organs" and that
"the aim of human rights is to move

beyond thinking and talking of lay
ing foundation stones, but to actual
ly lay those stones inch by inch."
From what Robinson has wit
nessed in the hist two years, viola
tions ot human rights have increased
dramatically. Civilians are no longer
only victims of war but are also in
volved in war.
In modern warfare, she said, 90
percent of all casualties are civilians.
"Girls and women are raped,
children are kidnapped and recruit
ed to become child soldiers," Robin
son said.
Robinson also emphasized that
"insufficient attention is being paid

to prevention of gross human-rights
violations." She drew upon the con
trast in money spent on prevention
and the amount that is spent after
the violation to investigate crimes
and aid victims.
At the same time. Robinson said,
"It is very important to emphasize
another sense of human rights, not
just political and civil human rights,
hut also economic, social and cultur
al human rights. We have to he
strong on both sets of rights."
Claire Hunter, a graduate stu
dent in Political Science, said, "I
thought her focus on economic, so
cial and cultural human rights is a
new and important concept,"
Robinson spoke of the active role
that the business and academic com
munities could play in human rights.

"The potential Stanford has in
working to build a human rights cul
ture is great," said Robinson.
Freshman Wendy Sheu said.
"Her message was really practical
because she really talked about how
businesses could play a role in
human rights, when it's normally
considered a governmental role."
Robinson drew a connection be
tween technology and human rights.
She stated that more needs to be
done to close the technology gap be
tween rich and poor countries. Also,
racism has found a new way to
spread over the Internet, she said.
Robinson criticized the United
States because it has not ratified in
ternational conventions on human
rights and can help set comprehen
sive goals and policies.
