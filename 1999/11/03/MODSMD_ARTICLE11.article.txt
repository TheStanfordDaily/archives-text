### 
HONOLULU (AP) â€”In the lat
est outburst of workplace violence, a
Xerox copier repairman shot and
killed seven co-workers in his office
building yesterday, then lied in a
'company van, authorities said.
I wo hours later, police surround
ed the suspect and began trying to
talk him into surrendering.
The gunfire erupted shortly after
N a.m. in an industrial section of
Honolulu, far from the Waikiki
tourist district. Fi\e victims were
tound dead in a conference room.

and two other bodies were found
nearby. All had been shot with a 9
mm handgun, authorities said.
As of 2:30 p.m., negotiations
were continuing, and someone had
gotten into the van with the suspect.
Police identified the gunman as
40-year-old Byran Uesugi. who
joined Xerox Corp. in 19X4. As a
customer service engineer, he trav
eled to various sites to service and
repair printers and copiers. Xerox
said.
"It appears as though it was a dis

gruntled employee who snapped,"
Mayor Jeremy Harris said.
Police would not comment on a
motive.
Uesugi was a member of his high
school rifle team and had up to 17
weapons registered in his name.
"This could have been much, much
worse." the mayor said.
By late morning in Makiki
Heights, a residential neighborhood
near the shooting scene, negotiators
were talking with the suspect
through a bullhorn. 1 le could be

seen pacing back and forth outside
the van.
"We are hopeful we're going to
be able to negotiate a peaceful set
tlement." Deputy Police Chief Mike
Carvalho said.
Police cordoned oil a half-mile
area around the vehicle, which is
near the Hawaii Nature Center.
About 60 fourth-graders and 12
chaperones were on a nature hike
when police told them to get to high
er ground.
A school bus with two rifle-toting

police officers then took the stu
dents to safety.
A separate group of first-graders
on a field trip also were evacuated in
the afternoon.
About 10 homes were also evac
uated. Neighborhood residents set
up lawn chairs in the streets to watch
the situation unfold.
David Wallace was riding his
motorcycle through Makiki's wind
ing roads when he spotted the stand
off.
"The cops were about a 9-iron

away from the van," he said. "We
were definitely in the line of fire."
Xerox employees were taken
across the street from the building to
be questioned by police and helped
by counselors. Another Xerox
building, in downtown Honolulu,
was evacuated in case the gunman
headed that way.
All seven victims were male
Xerox employees who were shot on
the second floor of the two-story
building, authorities said. They
ranged in age from 33 to 58.
