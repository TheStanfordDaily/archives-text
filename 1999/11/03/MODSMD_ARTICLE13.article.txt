# AZT scare continues

JOHANNESBURG. South
Africa (AP) — President Thabo
Mbeki's claim that a widely used
AIDS drug is dangerous has set
off an uproar, producing baffle
ment and shock among physicians
and advocates who say AZT is
safe.
The drug is the mainstay of
efforts around the world to pre
vent HIV-infected mothers from
passing the AIDS virus to their
babies during birth.
Mbeki said in Parliament last
week that AZT is toxic and was
being challenged by court cases in
the United States, Britain and
South Africa — a claim the man
ufacturer. Glaxo Wellcome PLC,
has hotly denied.
The issue is critical in a nation
with one of the world's worst
AIDS problems, where 3.6 mil
lion people, or 8 percent of the
population, are estimated to be
HIV positive. The controversy
threatens to set back efforts to
fight the disease.
In his speech Thursday, Mbeki
spoke of a "large volume of scien
tific evidence alleging that, among
other things, the toxicity of this
drug is such that it is in fact a dan
ger to health."
Mbeki said that it would be
"irresponsible" not to heed the
"dire warnings" of researchers
about the safety of AZT, which is
one of the world's oldest and best
known AIDS drugs. Reputable
scientists have issued no such
warnings, and it was unclear what
he was referring to.
Yesterady, the government
promised to investigate the safety
of AZT". Mbeki said he has asked
the health minister. Manto Tsha
balala-Msimang, to oversee the
inquiry.
1 shabalala-Msimang told the
South African Broadcasting
Corp. that AZT would not be
barred from the market but she
was deciding how to investigate
the matter "so that we really have
concrete information in our
hands."
The drug has been approved
by regulators in South Africa and

around the world, and is common
ly used in combination with other
drugs to control the AIDS virus or
prevent infection among health
care workers exposed to it. Many
studies have shown that AZT cuts
in half the risk that women will
infect their babies during delivery.
AZT, also known as zidovu
dine, is "perfectly acceptable" in
those three areas, said Dr. Joseph
Perriens, head of the care and
support division of the U.N.
AIDS program in Geneva. It
causes slight side effects like nau
sea or anemia, but, he noted, so
do many medicines.
Worries about AZT's safety
surfaced in the early 1990s but
have long faded, Perriens said.
French researchers reported in
February that two babies who had
received AZT in a study had died,
but no link between the deaths
and the drug was established.
Perriens suggested Mbeki
"inform himself better about the
toxicity of (the drug), which is not
really as serious as he thinks, and
he should probably recast the
debate in terms of cost. It's not
doing his people a service.''
With an average of 1,500 South
Africans infected with HIV each
day, the government has come
under increasing pressure to pro
vide drugs like AZT to infected
pregnant mothers and rape vic
tims. The government has said
before that it cannot afford to do
so. but this is the first time in the
public debate that an official has
so forcefully said a health danger
is the reason.
Mbeki's comments are "very
distressing because it sets back the
whole agenda once again" after
previous controversies, such as a
scandal-plagued anti-AIDS musi
cal. which paralyzed the govern
ment AIDS program, said Dr.
Saul Johnson, a pediatrician and
researcher at Chris Hani-Barag
wanath Hospital in Soweto.
