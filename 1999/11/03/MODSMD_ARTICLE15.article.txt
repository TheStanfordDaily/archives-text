## Editor's Notebook What's my heritage? 
### 
Race and ethnicity
mean different things
to different people

I DON'T LIVE up to the hype. My
race and ethnicity are things I
deal with in a very blase manner.
I'm Mexican-American, and I'm
proud of my heritage, but I've never
been the Hag-waving, Cinco-De-Mayo
freak that others in my community are.
Some people think I'm just Ameri
canized. Others have called me names
tantamount to traitor.
I grew up in Monterey Park, which
is right outside of East Los Angeles.
As you can imagine, it was a largely
Latino community (though now Mon
terey Park is renowned as an Asian
mecea). Almost all of my neighbor
hood friends were Latino.
Expectations build up. 1 found it
sad. People were proud of me not just
because I was doing well, but because
I was a Latino who was doing well.
As I got to school. I spent a lot of
time in accelerated classes. Growing
up, faces became more and more
Asian and far less Mexican. I was just
working and having fun. When you're
really comfortable with your friends,
you just don't notice what they look
like.
But things change. I know I have.
My Spanish is terrible now. The name
I go by, Gil, is not the name I grew up
with. At home I was always Nicky,
like my father. Gilbert Lope/ is what
people who haven't known me all my
life call me.
I've seen the disgust on some peo
ple's faces. Both back home and here
on campus. I've sold out my heritage.
I have no pride.
Honestly, people are right. I can't
say I have tremendous pride in being

Mexican. I'm not ashamed. It's just a
non-issue.
It's never been an issue to me. I'm
not the son of Mexicans, I'm the son
of Nicolas and Maria Lope/. Those
are words I take great pride in saying.
I feel somewhat sad about it. I
stand at attention — and even sing
along under my breath — whenever I
hear the American national anthem. I
revel in the freedoms America grants
its people. A free press is vital to my
future plans.
I can't say the same of anything
Mexican. My parents are where I
draw my true personal pride. I could
go on for pages about either one. but
I won't.
But being Mexican, that's not a
driving force in my life. I love the tra
ditions it has introduced into my life.
And despite what you might hear
from friends, my heritage has given
me some values I strain to live my life
by.
I have seen terrific things from
some people who embrace their Mex
ican heritage. I've also seen some hor
rible, destructive actions from others
who do the same. I stand apart.
Maybe I'm just sheltering myself. I
don't want to hear people say I've
overcome lots of hurdles to be where
I'm at. 1 have parents that have pro
vided everything any child could even
think of asking. I've overcome noth
ing.
I also live on the other side of the
coin. I heard the whispers in high
school: "He's at Stanford because he's
Mexican." I — almost always -
worked my butt off in high school.
I've earned this.
So I'm traitorous. I'm patriotic. I'm
shameful. I'm commendable.
Say what you will. I'm happy.
