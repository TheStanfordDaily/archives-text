Revisiting social conformity
in Japan
Reflecting on her stay in Japan, "My
Summer as an office Geisha," Sasha
Polonsky, offers valuable insights on the
enduring characteristics of Japanese soci
ety. However, she falls into the classic trap
of becoming preoccupied with aspects that
run contrary to American values.
Polonsky is initially repelled by social
phenomena in Japan, such as functional
marriages, overworked schoolchildren
and office ladies. Then she realizes that
her judgements were largely influenced by
her American perspectives. Concluding
that "these trends were different, strange
to me, but not wrong," she implies that
foreigners should respect the distinctive
ness of Japanese society and culture. This
is the classic trap. One first finds repulsive
social elements, then realizes one's own
biases, concluding that uniqueness of the
other should be accepted and applauded.
Polonsky depicts the Japan of a decade
or two ago. Japan is not a static society, as
Polonsky suggests — its people obedient,
passive and acquiescent to established
societal norms. Functional marriages,
overworked children and corporate cul
ture with office ladies undoubtedly play a
part in Japanese society today. However,
equally if not more important are the
dynamic tensions Japan faces as it tries to
break free from its rigid framework of the
past. The distinctive features Polonsky
documents co-exist and clash with signifi
cant developments such as higher divorce
rates, non-examination entrance to uni
versities and clear merit-based employ

ment.
The tension between these traditional
and new elements continue to shape the
direction of Japanese society.
Aside from her failure to recognize this
tension, it is worth mentioning that the
American perspective that she tried to
break free from still manifests itself in her
observations such as "I saw couples who
were not affectionate and I assumed that
their marriage was flawed." liy concluding
that "couples who do not hug or touch in
public represent a different style of mar
riage," she accepts the notion of a func
tional marriage by identifying what she
sees as the lack of affection. This observa
tion reflects that she in still confined to her
American paradigm. Public display of
emotion as a gauge for affection is in itself
an American, perhaps Western, notion.
Her efforts to respect the attributes of
Japanese culture are admirable. Yet by
focusing on the functional marriages,
overworked schoolchildren and corporate
culture, she fails to recognize the sizable
population of Japanese who disagree with
or challenge these "social norms." As
younger generations are raised in econom
ic prosperity and with greater awareness
of Western perspectives, the social norms
and institutions are called into question.
Tension and turmoil ensues — Japan is at
a crossroads.

Screaming for attention in
White Plaza
I just loved Monday's article about the
preacher in White Plaza — it was typical
Daily.
All the sources in the piece spouted off
such gems as "This is an environment
where I feel like I shouldn't have to deal
with this" and "While students understand
the importance of free speech, they also
believe in preserving a comfortable and
inviting university environment."
I love all this talk of environments
like Stanford students are some delicate
endangered species needing to be cuddled
and protected.
Although, I, for one, expect Stanford to
provide warm womb-like surroundings
that will shield me from the rest of the
cold, cruel world, I think expecting federal
laws to not apply here is a bit much. For
those of us who appreciate occasionally
being reminded that everyone in the world
does not share Stanford's moral tepidity,
there are people out there who stand for
something, and that there are people in
the world who are passionate about things
you might feel indifferent (or God forbid,
are opposed to) would like to at least pre
tend this University wants to prepare us to
deal with real world issues and ideas.
If I could have it my way. views that are
contrary to my beliefs would never see a
public forum — I wouldn't like to see Klan
members in front of the Bookstore spew
ing hate messages. But I don't find the
exercise of free speech so repulsive (in any
arena) as to seriously want it abolished or
limited any more than it already is on this

campus. If goons can stand out there half
naked, begging us to support their efforts
to run around in a Tree costume, why
can't some misinformed individual give his
view on religion to do his part to save our
damned souls?
