# Fighting the good fight
## Traditions gone awry 
### 
Corey Griffin

SO I WAS a bit skep
tical when I heard
the Mausoleum
Party was going to feature
Sir Mix-a-lot.
Can you blame me?
The undeniably — for
lack of a better word

sketchy performance of Digital Under
ground last year (where llumpty was all
over some Stanford women) made me
question why the Stanford Alumni Net
work (STAN) and the infamous Concert
Network were going to tamper with the
time-honored tradition of dancing on our
founder's burial site bv bringing "Mr. I Like
Big Butts" himself.
I Jnfortunately, this was not STAN's first
attempt at messing with a Stanford tradi
tion.
Full Moon 011 the Quad this year was a
mess. Who needed a stage, lights and a DJ
(who played music that sounded like some
thing straight out of a SCBN porn flick)?
Didn't the people in charge know you're
supposed to wail until midnight? Who the
hell needs a demo about how to have a
"sketchy kiss"? The band didn't even show
up until after the kissing began. I went
home horribly disappointed, and I know 1
wasn't the only one.
Granted, there is an inherent level of
awkwardness associated with kissing a com
plete stranger in front of Memorial Church,
of all places. But my freshman year every
thing was so much simpler. The seniors
lined up 011 one side of the Ouad and the
freshmen 011 the other. Someone with a
megaphone told us when it was midnight,
and then we went at it (with the Band play
ing in the background of course). No kissing
demos, no weird DJs. Just lull Moon 011 the

Quad.
Anyone out there remember Frosted
Flicks? This year's freshmen don't, thanks
to the crack commando New Student Ori
entation folk who decided for whatever rea
son to give it the ax. The annual movie in
Frost Amphitheater is still one of my fond
est memories of freshman orientation.
It's sad that we. the students and alumni,
are messing with our traditions, especially
when the administration is systematically
trying to eliminate anything fun 011 campus.
I'm not just talking about the loss of the
DKE Jello or Band Shak parties, my
friends. If you look into the Stanford histo
ry books, there is a long list of traditions
that have disappeared over the years, and I
thought I'd share one of them with you:
block parties.
Not too long ago, Escondido Road
would be blocked off and the surrounding
dorms (Toyon, Branner, Stern and Wilbur)
would all pitch in to put 011 a huge party,
almost a carnival, in the street, and in the
not-too-distant past the Row used to throw
a block party and house-decorating contest
in honor of Big Game week. In theory, the
"liability" of these large events was the
cause of their demise, but I wonder if the
University didn't like the image these
events painted.
By the way. has anyone else noticed the
disturbing decline in the number of frat par
ties this year? Yes. I know there are fewer
frats than ever before, but it seems all-cam
pus frat parties are going the way of the
block parties of yesteryear, as something
akin to the Prohibition sweeps the Stanford
campus.
So what's next?
The administration has already tried to
do awav with Flicks as we know it. fortu-

nately without success. It wouldn't surprise
me if they tried to replace our all-too-con
troversial Band with some Prince-playing
high school marching band. (Oh wait; C'al
has already employed that high school
hand).
If you look at universities across the
hoard, what separates Stanford from other
top schools? Size, location, maybe architec
ture and, I think most importantly, our tra
ditions. What is Stanford without running
with the Band, Full Moon on the Quad. Big
Game, Flicks, MuFuUnSun, Gaieties and
the 5-6-7-8 of All Right Now? It's not ;i
place where I would want to spend four
years of my life.
Maybe administrators should keep that
in mind as they try to entice the nation's top
high school seniors to come to Stanford. No
one (well, almost no one) wants to go to col
lege where, to put it simply, there is no fun.
no tradition, no place to be part of sonic
thing bigger than yourself. Furthermore,
students and alumni should be more careful
about upholding traditions. There is room
for change, but it needs to be change for the
better, not worse.
As our own president. Gerhard Casper,
stated in the I landbook of Stanford Univer
sity. "Traditions hold their value only if they
are kept alive; they are a binding force that
holds the Stanford family together not only
across the campus, but across the year};.'
Indeed, we could all learn a thing o„r two
from Gerhard about the importance ol
upholding traditions at Stanford.

mean, really, what have they ever (lone to
you?
