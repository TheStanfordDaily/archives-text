l hc long-anticipated renovations
to Stanford Medical School are final
ly on the horizon.
A newly approved $IKS-million
plan lor new construction and reno
vation at the Medical School will im
prove the "primitive" facilities criti
cized last winter by the I iaison ( 0111-
mission on Medical Education, said
Phyllis Gardner, senior associate
dean ol medical education.
Named for the Grant. Alway.
Lane and Edwards Buildings, the
GAM Project involves five phases
of assessment, renovation and con
struction to be completed in the fall
of 2(X)4.

The 240,000 square-foot con
struction site promises to "create a
lot of disruption for the school and
the campus." said Michael I lindery.
senior associate dean for finance and
administration.
Currently, the project is in its ini
tial programming and design phase,
which involves an assessment of the
existing mechanical, electrical and
plumbing services and the designing
of the upgrades of those services.
The second phase includes the
renovation ol Lane Medical Library:
the third phase involves the demoli
tion and reconstruction of the Ed
wards Building: and the fourth and
fifth phases entail the renovation of
the Grant and Alway Buildings re
spectively.
Built in the late lM5()s and early
l%()s with an approximate 40-year
life span, these buildings, located in
the core of the School of Medicine
between Campus Drive and Welch
Road, "have run their life course and
need to be upgraded," I lindery said.
Renovations will simultaneously
address the deficiencies reported by
the medical education commission
and students and faculty, such as in
formation technology support, ap
pearance. lab and study space and re
search accessibility.
1 lindery said the two most excit
ing aspects of the project include the
renovation of Lane Library and the
replacement of the Edwards Build

ing.
The expansion and moderniza
tion of Lane Library will allow for es
sentially "a brand-new library to be
built within a renovated space," he
said.
Hie construction of the new Ed
wards Building will consolidate mod
ernized educational, instructional
and research facilities in one area.
Hindery said.
Student services, including admis
sions, financial aid and curriculum
counseling, will be located in the
same building as state-of-the-art
classrooms, lecture halls and small
group learning areas, as well as the
Dean's offices, which I lindery hopes
will provide a "visible and physical
connection between students' educa
tion and the dean."
Beneficiaries of the GALE Pro
ject will be many, said O'Brien, "the
most immediate being the medical
and graduate students, faculty in

structors. researchers and the com
munity at large."
More indirect beneficiaries will
include Stanford Hospital, as new
space will allow for new and better
staffing to be brought into the med
ical school, he said.
Project directors hope that the
GALE Project will help to give the
Medical School a "more visible pres
ence on campus," said I lindery.
O'Brien echoed this hope, and
said he is "very excited at the
prospect of establishing true state-of
the-art educational facilities and
bringing the Medical School to the
eye of the public."
Gardner said that the goal of the
G ALE Project is to help "keep Stan
ford as a pre-eminent medical
school" and to finally "give us a
school where you walk up and know
where you are, so that people can say.
'Ahh. there is the School of Medi
cine.' "
