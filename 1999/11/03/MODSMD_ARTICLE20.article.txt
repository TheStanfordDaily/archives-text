### John Huetter 
What's being taught in high
schools today? Try "Politics of
Porno," "ESP Tie-Dye," "Under
standing UNIX" and "Physics of
Siege Weaponry."
These unusual classes are avail
able through the Stanford High
School Enrichment Program.
Founded in spring IW6 and mod
eled after MI T's Educational Stud
ies Program, the Stanford program
provides a chance for Stanford stu
dents to share their hobbies and in
terests with local high schoolers.
Over a six-Saturday series of
two-hour sessions. Hay Area high
school students come to the Farm
to partake of the wide range of
classes.
Computing and dance lessons
have proven to be the most popu
lar. but no class can be counted out.
"The teacher has to sell the
class," said Vice Chairman Jake
Whitehill, a junior. "It's all in the
enthusiasm and ability."
Some classes surprised the orga

nizers with their popularity. White
hill said, such as one offered on So
cial Security.
It filled up quickly, Whitehill
said, even though "we're like, what
the hell, this is never [going to]
sell."
This year, all 23 applicants were
approved to teach the children.
"We usually pick all of them."
said senior Ken Takusagawa. the
program's Web master. "Usually
everybody has an exciting idea for a
class."
Courses slated for winter 2(M)()
include "Rhythmic Gymnastics."
"The Paranormal and Parapsychol
ogy" and "Things I've Learned in
Med School So Far."
The number of teachers has re
mained in the low 2()s since 19%,
with the exception of last winter.
"We had 70 teachers and took all
of them," laughed junior Caroline
Perry, vice chairman. "We're still
trying to figure that out."
The teaching force remains pre
dominately freshmen.
"[They] have the time," ex

plained Perry, "it's also something
that freshmen really like to try.
They're closer to high school." Ac
cording to Perry, this age similarity
doesn't raise discipline problems.
"All the kids are there voluntarily."
Peaching opportunities are open
to clubs as well. The Footbag Club,
the Stanford Improvisers and Stan
ford Film Society have all given
lessons, and Vegan Action will
offer a course in vegan cooking this
winter. Individual Stanford stu
dents. however, comprise the bulk
of the teaching force.
"Our work with other organiza
tions is very weak." reflected
Whitehill. "We really want to im
prove that."
Classes range between five and
20 high schoolers. The program has
generally garnered about 150 chil
dren per year since its 1996 begin
ning.
Combined with the 400 children
brought in for its one-day sister
workshop SPLASH, this is. accord
ing to Whitehall, the most high
schoolers drawn to Stanford by a

student group.
Despite the loss of six precious
Saturdays, the program has consis
tently attracted students.
"We have [high school] kids who
do it freshman year and go to every
SHEP and SPLASH afterwards."
said Perry. "They love it so much
that they keep coming."
Junior Austin Che enjoyed it so
much as a senior at Cupertino High
School that he is in his second year
of teaching for the program. As a
student, he was drawn to the unusu
al subjects and the opportunity to
visit the campus.
"It's a great opportunity for high
school students to learn," said Che,
who also praised the support given
to the teachers by the program.
"They encourage us to use their
money."
Whitehill emphatically agreed
with ("he's evaluation.
"It's an opportunity to be able to
teach your own stuff to a group of
motivated high school students. It's
unmatched by any other Stanford
program."
