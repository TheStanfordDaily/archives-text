# Students work for social change
## Group that developed 'the wall' plans upcoming year

Sophomore Hi Ade loved the LEAD Projeet
last year.
"It was really refreshing to see other peer role
models who felt a need to make a difference,"
said Ade, who is returning this year to help orga
nize the leadership development program start
ed last year by Stanford's ethnic community cen
ters.
The project brings together 24 freshmen and
sophomores of all ethnic backgrounds to plan
and carry out a social change project during fall
and winter quarters.
This year, students will be working in eight
small groups on different projects, instead of all
24 students collaborating on one big project.
This year's program will also have peer men
tors. Five students that participated in the I T AD
Project last year, including Ade, are returning to
advise and help the new students this year.

Ade explained her continued involvement in
the program.
"My goal this year as a peer mentor is to ex
pand on that exact leadership network that I
found once before through sharing our successes
and struggles," she said. "It's a chain reaction:
hopefully my involvement will encourage the
next person to connect with the other peer lead
ers and to strive to make a necessary change with
in the community."
l ast year's group developed "the wall." The
wall gave students the opportunity to express
their views about race and diversity anonymous
ly on several large wooden bulletin boards that
were placed in White Pla/a.
Sophomore Misti Rodriguez, another of this
year's peer mentors, explained, "We fell that
race and diversity were topics that needed to be
discussed more on campus.... We were success
ful because people definitely started talking
when the wall was set up iast year."

The Leading through Education, Activism
and Diversity Project is based on a social change
model developed by two UCLA researchers.
The model emphasizes "value-based, collabo
rative and non-hierarchical leadership as a
means for diverse groups and individuals to cre
ate effective movements for social change and ac
complish their goals."
Chris Gonzalez Clarke, a staff member from
El Centro Chieano who is involved with the
LEAD Project, said, "The program draws on all
of the different skills and different styles that are
used to be a leader."
The LEAD Project is planning its fall retreat
this weekend to allow the students to begin de
veloping their leadership and cooperative skills.
The ultimate goal of the LEAD Project is to
grow, said Clarke. They would like to see their
social change model used all over Stanford in
many programs, but it needs to start somewhere,
he said.
