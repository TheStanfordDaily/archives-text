# Symposium to focus on past
## Different disciplines compare historical perspectives 
### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
Superstars in economics, philoso
phy, law, and the humanities will
talk about fate, history and the ways
these disciplines rely 011 the past in a
symposium this Friday and Saturday
on "Past-dependencies."
The symposium, part of the Pres
idential Lecture Series, is the third in
the history of the series.
On Friday morning from 9 a.m. to
noon in'room SO at the Law School,
panel members will discuss "The
Past as Constitution of Identity?"
Comparative Literature Prof.
Sepp Gumbrecht. who will moder
ate that discussion, said that in
America, identity has been bound to
the cultural past.
Sometimes, however, linking
identity to past is damaging. Cium
brecht gave an example from Ger
man history.
Although we should not forget
about German history in World War
11, Ciumbrecht said. "It was not pos
sible in 1948, 1949 to found the two
German states exclusively on the
past. There must be some future
projection."
The morning panel features Ox
ford philosopher Joseph Ra/, Mass
achusetts Institute ol Technology
cognitive scientist Elizabeth Spelke,
University of London Professor of
Law Peter Goodrich and philoso
pher Gary Hatfield.
Gumbrecht said that the choice
of title for the symposium was itself
a kind of historical accident.
Economics Prof. Roger Noll,
who is on the planning committee
for the symposium, raised at a meet
ing the topic of "path-dependence."
The theory posits that historical ac
cidents — not necessarily product
superiority — can determine which
technologies become dominant.
Gumbrecht said he noted down
the topic incorrectly as "past-depen

dence." Law Prof. Robert Weisberg,
also on the committee, noted the
error, but suggested that the title- was
just right for the symposium.
Ciumbrecht noted that a theme
throughout the symposium will be
the ways different disciplines inte
grate and depend upon history. The
second panel will closely address
this question in "Different Areas/
Different Pasts?" from 2 p.m. to 6
p.m., also in room NO at the Law
School.
In economics, for instance, the
accumulation ol capital, debt or in
heritance all depend on the past.
(kimbrecht said.
"In legal practice, [the past is re
lied upon] through precedent. What
judgments and decisions were made
[before| preclude [some courses of
action] and determine what you do
in the present," he added.
Participants in that panel include
Stanford Lconomics Prof. Avner
(irief, who is a Mac Arthur Fellow,
Johns Hopkins geographer David
Harvey, literary historian Jochen
Horiseh, ait historian Denise
Schmandt-Besserat and historian
Pin Wong. Weisberg will moderate
the discussion.
On Friday evening, internation
ally-renowned pianist and musicolo
gist Charles Rosen will perform
works by Mo/art, Beethoven and
Brahms at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
at X p.m. Tickets cost $8 for students;
call 725-2787 for ticket information.
There will also be two panels on
Saturday. The morning session,
from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Law
School, will bring together scholars
in sociology, anthropology,econom
ics, comparative literature and the
history of music to explore "Emer
gence: Natural History / Human
History."
Gumbrecht said that "emer
gence" is a kind of historical expla
nation that rejects both history as
the succession of "great men" and

the Hegelian-Marxian perspective
of history governed by laws.
Panel members include Ricardo
Benzaquen, Niklas Damiris. Robert
Frank, Wlad Godzich and Charles
Rosen. Bcnzquen has written exten
sively on the work of Gilberto
Freyre.
The symposium will wrap up on
Saturday afternoon with another
panel, with what Gumbrecht called
"all-star qualities."
The final panel, which features
Judge Richard Posner and four re
spondents all affiliated with Stan
lord. will address "Past-dependen
cy. pragmatism and critique of histo
ry in adjudication and legal scholar
ship" from 2 p.m. to (•> p.rti in room
290 at the Law School. Law School
Dean Kathleen Sullivan will moder
ate the panel.
Posner is Chief Judge of the 7th
Circuit and was educated at Yale
College and Harvard Law School
before teaching law at the Stanford
I aw School, beginning in I%N.
1 le moved on to the University of
Chicago Law School in 19f>9 and
then became a judge in 1981. Posner
is the chief proponent of "law and
economics," a school of thought
which calls for expunging moral the
ory from legal decision-making and
replacing it with economic cost-ben
efit analysis.
Respondents to Posner include
History Prof. Jack Rakove. whose
book "Original Meanings: Politics
and Ideas in the Making of the Con
stitution" won the 1997 Pulitzer
Prize. Comparative Literature Prof.
Richard Rortv, who is a famous
