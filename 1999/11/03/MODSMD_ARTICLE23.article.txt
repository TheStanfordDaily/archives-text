# Alumni building on track

In addition to the job offers and
graduate school acceptances, there
will soon be another perk associated
with a Stanford diploma: a new
115.(MX) square-foot alumni center,
slated to open in October 2000.
"We're right on track now,"
said Dan Rogers, liason to the pro
ject from the University's Capital
Planning and Management office.
"But it's really dependent on how
the weather shapes out later this
year."
Rogers hopes to have the steel
frame and roof completed before it
starts to rain so that construction can
continue despite the adverse weath
er.
The Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni
Center will house facilities for use by
visiting alumni, including a two
story "great hall" designed to acco
modate up to 400 people for meals
or 7(H) with theater seating.
The center will also be home to a
state-of-the-art business center with
laptop Ethernet hookups and print
ers, several conference rooms for
alumni meetings, a coffee shop and
a locker room where alumni will be
able to rent bicycles to ride around
campus.
"We'd like to be able to encour
age alumni to come back to campus
more hospitably and more frequent
ly," said Bill Stone, manager of the
Stanford Alumni Association.
The new alumni center will re

place Bowman Alumni House as
Alumni Association headquarters.
According to Stone, Bowman's
location on Santa Teresa Street
makes it inadequate for this task.
"They first have to find it, then
they have to find a place to park," he
said. "And all we've got there are a
couple of couches and some com
puters."
The Alumni Center is being built
on the site previously occupied by
the Band Shak, which was demol
ished last December.
"It has been frustrating to the
Band mostly because we lost not just
a facility, but a friend," said senior
C'hris I lenderson. public relations
director for the Stanford Band.
The Band has since moved to a
modular building and a wing of
Encina Gym, across the street from
the construction site.
"It's working," said Henderson,
"though it's certainly inconvenient
to have to do things in two different
buildings, and we could definitely
use more space."
The University Board of
Trustees approved construction of
the center in 1998 when the Alumni
Association merged with the Uni
versity after a century of existence as
an independent organization.
Principal funding for the project
came from John Arrillaga and fami
ly in memory of his wife Francis,
who died in 1995. Arrillaga is also
overseeing development and con
struction of the site.

on the site of the old Band Shak.
