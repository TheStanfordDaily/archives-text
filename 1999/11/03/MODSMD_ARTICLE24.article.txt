## HEALTH New treatment slows vision loss 
### Bruce Wang Editorial staff 
Loss of vision is one of the most devastating effects of
aging. 1 he process is often caused by a condition termed
age-related macular degeneration. A new clinical study
has found that treatment combining a light-activated
drug and low-powered laser therapy may be effective in
slowing that process.
Age-related macular degeneration is the most com
mon cause of vision loss in the elderly. An incurable ill
ness, it disrupts the vision of over 1.7 million Americans,
many ot whom are above the age of 65. This number is
expected to soar during the next couple of decades as
the Baby Boomers enter their 60s.
Recently, a massive clinical trial involving 22 eye cen
ters world-wide, including Stanford Medical Center, and
609 patients has shown that treatment using light-acti
vated drugs is effective in treating the wet form of
AMD.
The most destructive form of AMD, wet AMD
affects over 170,(XX) people annually. The disease is
painless, but causes blurring and distortion of vision and
eventually leads to the appearance of blind spots.
Although some peripheral vision remains in AMD
patients, they will not be able to recognize familiar faces
or drive a car.
AMD damages the light-sensitive region of the eye
by disrupting the central part of the visual field, called
the macula. The macula is a tiny depression on the back
wall of the eye directly opposite the pupil.
Packed with light-sensitive cells, the macula provides
the resolving power needed to distinguish fine details
and see crisp images. It is also involved in anything that
requires keen forward vision, such as reading this page
or hitting a tennis ball.
In wet AMD, abnormal blood vessels develop in the
cell layers below the macula that have weakened walls.
These vessels often rupture and the blood and fluids that
seep out warps the macula. As a result, scar tissue may
also form around the area and generate vision-blocking
lesions.
To date, no satisfactory treatment for AMD exists. In
severe cases, surgeons sometimes use a powerful laser to
scald the proliferating vessels. This method often dam
ages the light-sensitive cells within the macula, leading
to vision loss.
The new treatment, known as photodynamic thera
py. uses low-intensity laser light to trigger a chemical
reaction that erodes the abnormal blood vessels from
within. This method avoids any potential harm to the
light-sensitive cells of the macula.
An experimental drug, verteporfin, is the light-acti
vated drug used in the therapy. Ten minutes after injec
tion into the blood vessel, the drug can be activated in
the eye by exposure to a low-powered laser at the
unwanted vessels below the macula.
Exposure to approximately 90 seconds of infrared
laser light causes the drug to release free-radicals, high
ly reactive forms of oxygen that attack the vessel walls
and cause the blood vessels to slam shut.
According to Mark Blumenkranz, chair of the
Department of Ophthalmology and a writer of the
report, Ihe procedure is painless and requires neither
sedation nor anesthetics. In fact, both eyes can be treat
ed in about 15 minutes.
Data from the report indicated that after a year of
treatment, patients receiving verteporfin treatment
could read 2.2 fewer lines than normal people on a stan
dard eye chart compared to 3.5 fewer lines for people
receiving a placebo.
Photodynamic therapy also slowed the development
of lesions in the macula, forty percent of the verteporfin
patients experienced expanding lesions during the year
of study while 71 percent ot the control group patients
showed lesion progression.
While the treatment slows the development of
AMD, it does not cure AMD. In addition, since the
blood vessels can re-open and begin leaking again a few
weeks after the treatment, follow-up treatments are
required about every three months, said Blumenkranz.
