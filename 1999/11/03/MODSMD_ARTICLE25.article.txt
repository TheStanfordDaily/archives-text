# The 						wild and wacky world of IDEO
## 
### David Lin Contributing writer 
If you've ever flown in a Boeing 747.
you've probably noticed those "Lava
tory Occupied" signs on the bathroom
door. And if you'd ever paused to
think about it just for a moment, you
probably thought it was a pretty nifty
idea.
David Kelley thought of it first.
And it wasn't his last idea, either.
Kelley is founder and CEO of IDEO
Inc., a design company that has
achieved legendary status for innova
tive new products.
IDEO engineers have touched
everything from printers to trains to
water bottles—leaving smarter, better
and friendlier products in their wake.
They do it with a unique system that
encourages creativity and does away
with gray-suited corporate conventions
— a system that may point the way to
the office of the future.
IDEO's reputation as perhaps the
best product-design company in the
world is hard to dispute. Founded in
1978 by Kelley, an associate professor
of mechanical engineering, IDEO has
designed and redesigned thousands of
items.
You know those rubber grips that
started appearing on toothbrushes
some time ago? IDEO designers first
came up with that idea. Ever used the
new Sega virtual reality system? IDEO
engineers made it easier and less tiring
to use. Seen those stylish Nike wrap
around sunglasses? IDEO modified
the design to improve peripheral vision
and depth perception.
IDEO has a formula that seems to
work, inducing its engineers to design
one creative product after another.
What is it that makes IDEO so suc
cessful in creating new ideas?
One factor, Kelley says, is its free
wheeling, unregulated office environ
ment. "The crazies live over here,"
Kelley says with a grin as he shows
around a crew from ABC's "Night
line."
A first-time visitor would be startled
by the chaos —cubicles set willy-nilly
across the room, national flags and

bicycles hanging from the roof.
The cubicles are shadowed by the
wing of a bomber, while employees
race each other in office chairs.
Their offices look like college dorm
rooms, with all the stylized decorations
and off-season Christmas lights. One
can't help but be reminded of the
happy-go-lucky headquarters of Dou
glas Adam's Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy.
It's chaos with a purpose, however.
Kelley feels that freedom in the office
translates into bolder, better ideas.
"The reason you're not throwing a
Nerf ball at IBM is not that you're not
playful; it's fear of retribution from
somebody higher up." Kelley told
Business Week.
"So if you can break down that bar
rier, everybody not only feels comfort
able throwing the Nerf ball but [also
with] coming up with ideas."
An emphasis on teamwork plays a
role as well. Believing that great ideas
don't start alone or grow unaided,
IDEO engineers spend much time
brainstorming together, often all day.
The only rules are that one person
speaks at a time, no one criticizes an
idea no matter how wacky, and the
wackier the idea the better.
Here seniority doesn't matter —sta-
tus, says Kelley, comes from being
invited to brainstorming sessions, even
on projects that you aren't working on.
And ideas aren't just generated
quickly. IDEO engineers work to
make models as quickly as possible—
even if the design is still pretty hazy. As
1993 Stanford graduate and IDEO
engineer Peter Skillman proclaimed,
"Enlightened trial and error succeeds
over the planning of a lone genius."
By prototyping quickly, Kelley said,
engineers can see whether their ideas
translate well into practice, and they
can get quick feedback from potential
clients and users.
IDEO designers put an exclamation
mark on this point in a recent project
profiled on ABC's "Nightline." In just
five days, a team of psychologists, biol
ogy majors, engineers and linguists
brainstormed, designed and built a rev
olutionary new shopping cart.

The new cart, surprisingly, lost the
large metal basket. Instead, designers
used racks for small plastic baskets and
hooks for plastic bags.
Designers added a crossbar for child
safety and electronic gadgets to scan
your purchases as you wait in line.
They even changed the wheels —devel-
oping a wheel that lets the cart move
sideways with a simple push.
Not surprisingly, the new cart
passed a shopping test with flying col
ors.
All this seems to add up to a formu
la for success. IDEO has completed
over 4.000 projects in areas ranging
from medical products to electronics to
mailboxes.
Its track record is astonishing: it has
won 12 awards, including two gold
medals, in the 1999 Industrial Design
Excellence Awards.
That total was double that won by
any other firm. Go back five years, and
the pattern is the same —44 design
awards since 1995, besting the competi

tion by 18.
In fact, IDEO's success has motivat
ed some of its clients to seek help not
just in modifying products, but in
learning how to innovate for them
selves.
"Our clients were saying, it's nice
that you're so innovative and you
designed these products for us, but
can't you show us how you do it?"'
noted Kelley in an interview with For
tune magazine.
With such interest in its recipe for
innovation. IDEO's unorthodox
design system and offbeat office cul
ture may point toward a coming revo
lution in corporate thinking.
Certainly IDEO's success is hard to
contest. Companies may be coming to
the conclusion that the rule-driven,
conformist office culture that spawned
"Dilbert" is not the way to go.
If that's the case, IDEO will be lead
ing the wav —and David Kelley will

mean more to you than a "Lavatory
Occupied" sign.
