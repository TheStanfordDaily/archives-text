# Birds of a Feather Dig Music Together
## 
### Katharine Miller 
You probably think you like the
Backstreet Hoys for the simple reason
that their music sounds good to your ear
and those boys are so darn cute. Or you
think you like heavy metal because it's
suited to your personality and it's so
cool. Or you might think your prefer
ence for Mo/art means you have a
sophisticated, intelligent musical ear.
Not so. says Assistant Sociology Pro
fessor Noah Mark: your taste for music
depends largely on your socio-demo
graphic niche; that is, if your friends like
that music, it's more likely that you will
like it too. Birds of a feather enjoy
music together.
This alone might not sound like a
huge revelation. After all. it's pretty
obvious that the reason certain fifth
graders sing along with Britney Spears'
music is that their (fithth-grade) friends
do.
More interesting is Mark's attempt
to find out whether it is possible to pre
dict people's musical tastes from infor
mation about who thev are—their ace.

race, gender, education, occupation,
social status, religion, association mem
berships, hobbies, etc. If "birds of a
feather flock together," do they sing
together as well?
He discovered that the likelihood
that one's musical taste matches his or
her socio-demographic niche is
enhanced for those individuals who
belong to only one niche.
Thus, the reason a fifth-grade girl lis
tens to Britney Spears and only Britney
Spears is that she fits into only one
socio-demographic niche: being a fifth
grade girl who likes certain vampy
clothing style. If she fits into more nich
es (e.g.. if she has some friends who are
tomboys), it is likely that her passion for
Britney Spears is more limited.
The same goes for the country music
fanatic. If Emmylou is a Texan, wears
cowgirl boots and shirts with snaps and
her friends are all cowboys, she's more
likely to be a country music fan than
Tessa, whose friends include cowboys,
yoga practitioners and her fellow mem
bers of a gospel church.
Tessa might like country, new age

and gospel music because she belongs
to socio-demographic niches associated
with each of those musical genres. But
Tessa is more likely not to like country
music than Emmylou is.
Moreover, it is unlikely that any of
Tessa's tastes will be as strong as
Emmylou's adoration of Garth Brooks.
Mark asked the next logical ques
tion: Why? Why wouldn't someone
such as Tessa, who has a breadth of
musical tastes, have tastes as strong as
Emmylou's?
The answer: she has too many tastes
competing for limited resources.
There's only so much time Tessa can
devote to music. If she spreads it
around among various musical genres,
the strength of her passion for any one
musical style is likely to be reduced.
Mark's general model for how cul
tural preferences develop can be used
" to explain how people decide to join
voluntary organizations, and how peo
ple develop social and political atti
tudes.
That is. people acquire tastes from
their social contacts; they tend to associ

ate with people who are like them
selves; and they can't like everything.
The result of this is that people make
choices based on who their friends are
and their limited time and resources.
So if you think you love the Blues
and Jazz because the music speaks to
you: and you think you hate new age
music and rock because they can't move
you the same way. are you right? Or is
it just a matter of limited resources forc
ing you to make an arbitrary choice?
Unfortunately, Mark's research
won't help answer these questions. His
study only shows that people make
choices within the range of their over
lapping socio-demographic niches —not
which choices we make. Our musical
tastes aren't fated, they are just limited
by our time and our social contacts,
which tend to be with people with simi
lar tastes.
So go ahead and buy that CD of
music from Botswanaland. But bets are
good that if you don't associate with a
group of people from Botswana, that
CD will get limited playtime on your
Discman.
