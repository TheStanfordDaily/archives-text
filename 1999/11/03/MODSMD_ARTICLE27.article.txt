# Geneticists identify gene responsible for mental retardation
## 
### Monya De Contributing writer 
A collaborative effort between
two competing genetics labs has
yielded a prize. Stanford University
and Baylor College of Medicine
have announced the identification of
a gene responsible for a large part of
mental retardation cases, bringing
new treatments closer to reality.
(icneticist IJta Francke led the
Stanford arm of the project that
located the gene involved in Rett
'syndrome. The syndrome is charac
terized bv normal development for
six to IS months after a child is born,
followed by deterioration of the cen
tral nervous system and physical
impairment.

The search for the gene wore on
for 14 years due to the unusual fact
that Rett syndrome is generally
caused by sporadic mutations rather
than Mendelian inheritance.
A mutation on the gene, because
it is located on the X chromosome, is
much more severe in boys, who pos
sess only one copy of the chromo
some; this results in an early death.
Girls, however, possess two
copies of the X chromosome, and
because one of them is inactivated,
the condition affects about half the
cells in the body. The illness is typi
cally not fatal but causes seizures,
loss of motor control and the inabili
ty to speak.
This disparate behavior is charac
teristic of X-linked dominant muta

tions. Francke said. The symptom
cluster for Rett resembles that of
autism. However, a significant differ
ence is that autistic children with
draw from the world around them,
while Rett children want to interact
with people but cannot communi
cate their needs.
The syndrome affects approxi
mately one in every 12,(MK) girls, and
some may have mild symptoms
resulting from less-devastating mani
festations of the mutation.
Francke, who teaches the Sopho
more Dialogue "Human Chromo
somes," said that the Rett syndrome
gene was described in the l%()s by
Andreas Rett, a Viennese pediatri
cian. It was named for him some 20
years later, when the first publication

in English on the gene came out.
For years. Stanford and Baylor,
raced against each other to locate the
gene until the decision was made to
cooperate.
Working with tissue samples
from Rett patients, the researchers
"immortalized" the cells and
searched their DNA, as well as that
of the patients' parents, for clues as
to the location of the gene. The gene
was found near the end of the long
arm of the X chromosome, close to
the hemophilia and color blindness
genes.
As reported in the October issue
of Nature Genetics, the product of
the Rett gene is a protein — methvl-
CpG-binding protein 2 — that func
tions in transcriptional silencing of

other genes. Thus, it may prevent the
overproduction of other proteins.
The mutation renders the gene
unable to produce the protein, allow
ing other genes to make products
that most likely cause the nervous
system to deteriorate.
MeCP2 is found everywhere in
the body when the gene is function
ing. but the mystery is what genes are
supposed to be silenced or repressed.
When this is discovered, scientists
will be able to target the overactive
genes for treatment.'
The Francke lab is already mov
ing ahead with the results. They will
tackle a variety of projects in the
near future, including mouse model
ing. atypical Rett cases and mutation
mechanisms.

For example, some women with
the Rett mutation escape with only
mild neurological deficiencies, yet
pass the full-fledged syndrome to
their daughters, in a condition called
mosaicism. Here, the mutation has
occurred not in the parental sperm
or egg cell, but in the embryo post
conception.
While gene therapy is currently a
far-fetched next step in Rett treat
ment due to the difficulty of intro
ducing genes into nerve cells, a drug
may be able to slow the Rett course
if the relevant protein can be found.
In the meantime, Rett will be
incorporated into genetic testing to
facilitate early diagnosis, giving
patients a better chance to ward off
the consequences of the disease.
