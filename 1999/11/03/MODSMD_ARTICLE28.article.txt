## Rugby cleans house in seven-on-seven tourney Men's squad fields multiple teams in shortened field event at Stanford over weekend 
### Jonathan Cohen 
Hie newcomers were impres
sive. the returners dominated and
everyone in Stanfoid's men's rugbv
program was all smiles over the
weekend as they plowed their way
through a depleted field to win Sat

urday's seven-on-seven tourna
ment.
Stanford fielded a total of five
teams for the event: two composed
of returning varsity players, two
with first-year players and one with
;i mixed group. Unfortunately, the
majority of the expected colleges

were unable to attend tor a variety
of reasons. Thus, the Cardinal's
only competition consisted of two
University of the Pacific teams and
a squad representing the Stanford
Graduate School of Business.
The only loss sustained by either
varsity squad the whole day oc

curred in an intersquad matchup,
with the first team overpowering
the second stringers.
Coach Franck Boivert knows,
however, that in the rugby presea
son. the results of the games are of
secondary importance.
"They really enjoyed them

selves." said Boivert, and he feels
that in these tournaments, "the first
objective is to get the players to
enjoy the game."
In addition, Boivert recognizes
the importance of developing the
players in these games, a process he
described as "investing in them."
This applies especially to the new
comers who, as a whole, made an
excellent debut Saturday.

U.S. Rugby plays a
football-esque style, where
it's all about field position
and grinding it out a few
yards at a time. We play
a more dynamic style.'
— Mike Ceballos
senior

"Everybody played well," said
senior Mike Ceballos. "but the
rookies played above expecta
tions."
Senior captain Eli Frankel
added that while he enjoyed play
ing for the undefeated first team,
"it was more fun watching the new
guys play — showing what they had
learned over the past few weeks."
As for the returning players, the
emphasis in these tournaments is
on perfecting Stanford's style of
rugby. The Cardinal's particular
style of playing quickens the pace
of the game and is quite exciting to

watch, hut requires great execu
tion.
"U.S. Rugby plays a football
esque style, where it's all about
field position and grinding it out a
few yards at a time," said Ceballos,
"We play a more dynamic style.
We pass it off more."
While the wins came pretty eas
ily for Stanford this weekend,
things will gel tougher in the next
few weeks. This Saturday, the Car
dinal will host a l()-on-l() tourna
ment at the Stanford athletic fields.
Among the teams planning to at
tend are Santa Clara and Chico
State, two historically strong rugby
schools that both have some good
players coming back this year.
After that, the Cardinal will face
Australia's University of Sydney
on Nov. 16.
In that game, recent alumni of
the Stanford rugby program will
team up with some of the returning
starters to battle a powerful and ex
perienced Sydney squad. This
matchup figures to be the team's
biggest test before the regular sea
son starts winter quarter.
On a somber note. Fresno State,
one of the teams scheduled for Sat
urday's tournament, could not at
tend after one of their players was
killed in a car accident earlier in the
week.
The rest of the expected schools,
including San Francisco State and
San Jose State, simply were unable
to get enough players together for
the games.
