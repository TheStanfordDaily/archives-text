Slop right there. I know what
you're doing unci I don't want to
hear it. After Saturday's football
game against Washington, you're
already writing off Stanford's Rose
Bowl hopes — talking about wast
ing the best opportunity in years and
griping about the prospect of play
ing in the Sun Howl in HI Paso rather
than in sunnv Pasadena.

It's not time to make alternate
travel plans for the turn of the mil
lennium just yet.
While Stanford has lost control
of its own destiny — if the ('ardinal
wins out and so does Washington,
the I luskies head to the Rose Howl
— Stanford has a very real shot to be
playing in the big one on New
Year's Day.
The Cardinal's remaining Pacific
10 Conference games are against
Arizona State and California; it
probably needs to win both to have
a legitimate shot at the Rose Howl.
Stanford will face a tough test
against the Sun De\ils on the road,
but Big Ciame is the one to look for
ward to.
It's impossible to imagine the
intensity of the game against Cal
with a shot at the Rose Bow I on the
line. You thought last year's game
was intense when Stanford had
only two wins going in? liv the in
tensity of needing a win to go to the
biggest bowl game Stanford has
seen since IV>72. This one will be
for more than just Bav-Area brag
ging rights.
Imagine all those tuil throwing.
Birkenstock-clad Weenies ready to
avenge four years ol Big (iame loss
es by beating the ( ardinal in its own
house to ruin a shot at the Rose
Bowl. Not exactly a Saturday stroll
in the park.
You fired up vet? (iood.
Looking ahead to the remaining
three games — the Cardinal takes
on Notre Dame to end the season on

Thanksgiving weekend — the ( ar
dinal has a legitimate shot to post
three wins.
()n the offensive side, the ( ardi
nal continues to put up big numbers.
Stanford currently ranks 11th in the
nation in total pass offense, chalking
up 317 yards per game through the
air on the arm of Todd I lus.ik and a
solid corps of receivers led by all
world senior Troy Walters.
This year has also seen the
reemergence of a Stanford running
attack, which had gone missing for
the last two years since the depar
ture of Mike Mitchell and Anthony
Bookman. Freshman Kerry Carter
and sophomore Brian Allen anchor
a rotating attack that also features
junior Coy Wire and sophomore
Casey Moore.
Stanford's biggest weakness so
far has been on the defensive side
of the ball. After Saturday 's game
against Washington, in which
I luskv quarterback Marques I uia
sosopo threw for more than 300
yards and rushed for more than 200
yards, an NCAA first, the ("ardinal
fell to No. I 14 in the nation in total
defense dead last in the country.
I'm not sure if the Cleveland
Browns have 300 yards passing and
200 yards rushing on the season.
It's not that the Stanford defense
is without a solid core of athletes
and veteran leaders, and the lineup
has pro\en time and time again its
abilitv to make clutch plays (see Tim
Smith's game-saving interception
againt I 'SC).
In terms ol sacks and turnovers,
the defense ranks among the top
team in the Pac-10 For some rea
son th >ugh. the Cardinal struggles
with stopping the average plays, it's
the 12-yard passes and eight-yard
runs on the first down that are w\ at
ing down the C "ardinal line.
There's still a lot of football left
to be played this season, and il re
mains to be seen whethei Stanlord
can inded earn that rare R«>se Bowl
berth. But don't give up hope iiist
yet. If Sii Mix a-I.ot can make a
comeback, so can the ( ardinal.
