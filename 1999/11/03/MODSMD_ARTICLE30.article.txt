# Men's crew cruises through regatta
## Stanford squad fares well at Head of the American event 
### Dennis Lee 
There is something to be said
about a spoi I in whieli there arc no
breaks or timeouts.
A sport without sidelines or
substitutes jlist intense rowing
lor 15 to 20 minutes.
That's crew.
A crew coach docs not have the
option of substituting in fresh or
novice athletes in the middle ol a
race.
Therefore, the onl\ \\a\ to train
rookies is to let them race and
often sacrifice the No. I position to
reap greater benefits in the end.
I .ast Saturday. at the I lead of
the American regatta in Sacra
mento, the varsits men's crew
team did just that.
The team raced two boats if ap
proximately equal speed rather
than racing its fastest boat and .l\
boat.
Even with this compromise in

speed, the varsity men's "B" boat
came in second place at 15 min
utes. 41 seconds, three seconds be
hind the first place Sacramento
Stale team. The Stanford "A" boat
came in fourth place at 15:51. eight
seconds behind the third place
I (' I )a\ is team.
" The positions don't come as a
surprise." said men's coach Wies
law Kujda. " The other teams are
respectable and they put in their
first boat. This regatta is just a
measure of how the younger guys
are performing.
" They had a chance to row in
the faster boat and a chance to
learn something while racing. Asa
coach, this is more important to
me. It was an ideal learning situa
tion."
I.veil when racing two boats,
the Cardinal washy no means
slow.
It was able to keep up with
Sacramento state and beat the

fastest boats from UC-Davis, Col
orado Crew and San Diego State
Although the team was experi
menting with two boats, members
were not willing to be satisfied with
seeond best.
"[The I lead of the American] is
a regatta Stanford usually domi
nated." said senior Will Smith.
"It's disappointing that we didn't
at least take first with one boat. We
didn't row as well as we wanted to
and I think we probably could've
prepared better.
"We really didn't practice in
these boats beforehand and we
can't really be happy about the re
sults. but I don't think we can get
too down about il either."
This narrow defeat brought to
the forefront the issue of lack of
preparation. Kujda expressed the
importance of being focused be
fore entering the upcoming spring
season.
"A lot of underclassmen took

this race lightly." Kujda said.
"They haven't developed the sense
of urgency at every race. You have
to row your best all the time. You
can't row differently every time.
This is good because it shows that
we have to improve our prepara
tion."
The Head of the American also
gave the novice men's team an op
portunity to gauge its abilities and
standings in relation to the other
crew teams.
Although this was their first re
gatta. Stanford's novice "A" and
"B" boats came in ahead of both
Colorado's "A" and "B" boats and
the Humboldt State's crew team,
which placed fourth and seventh,
respectively.
Stanford's varsity crew team
will again put itself to the test
against Washington and many
other Pacific 10 Conference teams
at the I lead of the Lake regatta in
Seattle. Wash, on Nov. 14.
