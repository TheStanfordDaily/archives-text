# '99 Women's hoops squad looking to erase old memories
## After early exits from last two NCAA tourneys, Cardinal seeks redemption 
### Kelsey Colvin 
Monday night's game against
the USA Basketball Women's Na
tional Team was both an homage to
the past success of Stanford Uni
versity women's basketball and a
look to the future of this season's
team.
"We're much improved," said
head coach Tara VanDerveer. "I
think we're going to have a great
year."
The Cardinal returns this season
much more experienced and confi
dent. Eleven letterwinners are re
turning from last year's team, in
cluding several players with experi
ence as starters. The Cardinal
depth promises to be a strong point
in its game.
"We're counting on people's ex
perience," said VanDerveer. "We
have so many returners, they've
been through this battle before. In
fact, I think the biggest thing going
for our team is oui overall team
confidence."
The Cardinal offense will be
similar to last year. VanDerveer
hopes to capitalize on individual
player strengths through options
off of set plays.
"We hope to accentuate the pos
itives of our team and really de em

phasize the negatives," Van-
Derveer said.
The team will be looking to run
and lake advantage of its speed in
the transition game. Yet most of
the focus will be on scoring in the
paint.
"We're a go-inside team first,"
VanDerveer said. "I'm hoping
we'll gel double figures from all of
our posts."
The Cardinal front court is fast
and versatile, forwards Carolyn
Moos and l.njoli l/idor proved
Monday night that they can be
equally effective on the perimeter
as three-point threats.
I lie team has been working on
fundamentals in practice to assure
that every player is a threat on
every spot on the court.
According to VanDerveer. the
Cardinal's biggest weaknesses are
turnovers and louls
I he team has been concentrat
ing on implementing a new de
fense: a plaver-to-player scheme
that centers around fronting the
post players and helping on the
backside.
VanDerveer claims that fresh
man guard Jamie ( arey will have a
positive effect in decreasing
turnovers.
"One ol the hiuuest challenges

for us will be to eliminate
turnovers, and that's something I
think Jamie's really helpful toward.
She's a really savvy player."
Despite the team's quickness,
the Cardinal will not press much

There's not going to
be anybody that won't
bring out their best
game against us. We
take that as a compliment.'
â€” Tara VanDerveer
Women's basketball coach

this season.
VanDerveer explained that she
believes the press is like Tool's gold,
allowing you to beat teams early
but causing you to become ineffec
tive in (he long run by both pro
moting reaching and taking people
out of position.
The Cardinal will be facing
lough competition this season. Fel
low Pacific 10 Conference mem
bers UCLA. Arizona and Oregon
have been featured a great deal in
Pac-10 news and are expected to be
difficult to beat.
"We're not uoina to focus on anv

opponents," VanDerveer said.
"We like to focus on our team and
doing the best that we can. There's
not going to be anybody that won't
bring out their best game against
us. We take that as a compliment."
The team is approaching this
season with a positive and deter
mined attitude. VanDerveer said
the players are working hard and
remaining supportive of each
other.
Monday night's game demon
strated the Cardinal's depth in both
the frontcourt and backcourt. It's
too early in the season to speculate
on the team's lineup, but Van-
Derveer said she hopes to capital
ize on the talent and diversity of
this year's team.
"I'd really like to play every
body every game, but that's not al
ways realistic," VanDerveer said.
"I use the analogy of an orchestra.
We need everyone playing well and
on different nights different people
are going to have solos."
VanDerveer believes the season
will be successful, but placed a
great emphasis on the need for
everyone to stay healthy.
The Cardinal plays its next exhi
bition game Friday, Nov. 12 at 7:30
p.m. at Maples Pavilion against Slo
vakia.
