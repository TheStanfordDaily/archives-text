WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Monday's result: Team USA 101.
Stanford 58.

The USA National Team will
represent the United States at the
2(HX) Summer Olympies in Sydney,
Australia. The game against Stan
ford was the first of a 12-stop NCAA
Division I tour around the nation to
garner support for the team and pro
vide them with competition.
"I thought our team did very well
considering who we were playing
against." said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "We saw different people
step up tonight and 1 think that dif
ferent people could step up later."
Monday night's game treated the
3,547 fans in attendance to a glimpse
of 1999-2000 season. Despite an
overwhelming point deficit (101-58)
the Cardinal continued to work hard

and provide the enthusiastic crowd
with spurts of momentum.
"When you play a team like this
— everything you do, you're doing it
against the best." said sophomore
forward Bethany Donaphin. "When
you play good defense, you're play
ing good defense against the best.
When you score, you're scoring
against the best."
Donaphin. with two blocks and
seven points, was one ol several play
ers to perform well. Sophomore for
ward Enjoli Izidor was the leading
scorer with 13 points and two assists.
Izidor and freshman guard Jamie
Carey were responsible for a change
in momentum at the 12-minute
mark, taking advantage of the
USA's zone defense to make three
quick three- point shots.
Carey gave an amazing introduc
tory performance starting and play
inga total of 33 minutes and finishing
with 11 points and two assists.
"She's very poised, and she's an
extremely competitive player," said
VanDerveer. "She's definitely
earned the respect of our staff and
her teammates. It's a good start and
we're going to need more."
Senior guard Milena Flores, fifth
on Stanford's career assist list, had

six assists and seven points.
"It's an advantage for us to have
two guards who can run an offense,"
VanDerveer said.
The Cardinal frontcourt faced
one of the most phenomenal post
units of U.S. Olympic history. With
Lisa Leslie. Yolanda Griffith and
Natalie Williams, the USA National
Team was unstoppable in the paint.
Their size and strength were a prob
lem for the Cardinal, who had 17 re
bounds compared to USA's 41.
Leslie had 23 points for the night.
Griffith and Williams had 14 and 13
points, respectively.
"We had to work on our help side
tonight because they were so much
bigger than us," said Carey. "I think
that will help us down the road."
Stanford's frontcourt played well
though. Junior forward Carolyn
Moos contributed 11 points, and
both Donaphin and Izidor were key
players in the game. Junior forward
Sarah Dimson played well on de
fense with four steals, and sopho
more center Cori Enghusen had five
points and one block.
"I thought it wasa good lesson for
our team. We're hoping to benefit
from playing the USA team further
down the road," VanDerveer said.
