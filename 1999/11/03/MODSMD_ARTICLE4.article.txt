# '99 election results roll in
## New faces in Palo Alto City Council will decide development questions 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
The physical appearance of Palo
Alto was left in voter's hands yester
day. as they had the chance to elect
five new members to the nine-mem
ber Palo Alto City Council.
Four of the seats were open for a
full four-year term, while one seat,
recently vacated by the July resigna
tion of Councilwoman Micki
Schneider, has a remaining term of
two years.
Only one of the 12 candidates for
the seats was an incumbent. The
large turnover in seats was due to a
1992 law that limited council mem
bers to two consecutive terms.
As of Tuesday midnight, with 39
of 39precincts reporting, the follow
ing candidates won four-year city
council terms: Judy Kleinberg with
21.0 percent. Nancy Lytic at 1K.9
percent. Dcna Mossar at 15.6 per
cent and Bern Beecham with 16.0
percent.
With 390f 39 precincts reporting.
Jim Burch won the short-term elec
tion. with 35.7 percent of the vote.
I lot-button campaign issues cen
tered upon the physical appearance
of Palo Alto.
One issue which surfaced during
the campaign was control of devel
opment.
Kleinberg, in an earlier interview
with the San Francisco Chronicle,
said she would apply a quality-of
life test to proposed development.
"Does it enhance our residential
lifestyle? II it doesn't it comes with a
very heavy burden of proof that it
provides a benefit to our communi
tvOhe said.

Klein berg is the executive direc
tor of a non-profit corporation. Kids
in Common, and a graduate of UC-
Berkeleys Law School.
Lytic, a professional city planner,
told the Chronicle she would sup
port annual monitoring of growth
and its impact on the city. Lytic ex
plained that Palo Alto already had a
Comprehensive Plan and zoning
laws that limit development.
Mossar. a current member of the
city council, proposed limiting de
velopment on the basis of traffic
generated or energy consumed.
Beecham. a management con
sultant and 10-year member of the
Palo Alto Planning Commission,
wrote on his official Website that lie
would "use design review to regu
late monster homes... and strongly
support additional housing in Stan
ford's core campus area."
Burch. a retired business execu
tive. said he would fight to limit
"overdevelopment." In his official
Web site, he said he would "protect
neighborhoods from excessive den
sity and congestion by limiting
overdevelopment ol sites such as
Rickey's and Alma Plaza."
A second key issue to the elec
tion was the historic preservation
ordinance. The ordinance was cre
ated after three years of debate be
tween opponents of the ordinance
who argued that it restricted home
owners rights and supporters of the
ordinance who claimed that it would
preserve the character and charm of
old Palo Alto neighborhoods.
All of the newly elected city
council members support the cur
rent historic preservation ordi
nance.
