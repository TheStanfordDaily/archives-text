# Brown readies for runoff race
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
Mayor Willie Brown is headed for
a December runoff, but election
officials didn't expect to learn his
opponent until Wednesday morn
ing at the earliest.
Former police chief and mayor
Frank Jordan was a distant second
in early returns, but political con
sultant Clint Reilly was still in the
running, and counting write-in
votes for Board of Supervisors
President Tom Ammiano was ex
pected to take many more hours.
Brown, who would become the
first incumbent in 16 years to win
re-election if he survives the Dec.
14 runoff, acknowledged at his vic
tory party Tuesday night that San
Francisco is hard on its leaders.
"1 really thought I was what you
might call the cat's meow," the
powerful former speaker of the
California Assembly said, recalling
his first days as mayor.
"It would just be a matter of
minutes before San Francisco
would be completely turned
around. Well, did 1 get a rude
awakening," Brown said, 'i feel
sorry for those candidates, all those
big speeches they're making. They
have no idea how tough this job re
ally is."
With 16 percent of precincts re
porting. Brown had 21,555 votes,
50 percent, to Jordan's 10,238
votes, 24 percent. Reilly was third
with 7,304. or 17 percent.
The same returns showed just
76 votes for Ammiano, who
jumped into the race three weeks
before Election Dav. While the
other candidates spent millions on
the race, his grassroots campaign de
pended almost entirely on unpaid
volunteers.
Also fighting for re-election 'lues
day was District Attorney Terence
"Kayo" I lallinan, who faces four op
ponents.
Hallinan's strongest challenge
came from Bill Fazio, a former assis
tant district attorney who lost to I lal
linan in IWS and says I lallinan is
temperamentally unsuited for the
job. Fazio had 17.8 l X), or 45 percent,
to Hallinan's 13,316, or 34 percent.
Brown remained the odds-on la
vorite when voters went to the polls.
With a total of 15 candidates, howev
er. no one was expected to get a ma
jority. A runoff election would be
held Dec. 14.
Three weeks ago Ammiano, who
said last summer he wouldn't run.
jumped in as a write-in. Almost im
mediately, polls showed him tied
with Jordan and Reilly.
"I voted for Ammiano because
it's the real San Francisco style to
have some mayhem at the end: I love
that he did that, and 1 totally love that
it's a gay man who might have a
chance to be mayor here," said Adri
anne Mohr, 42, a medical educator,
after casting her ballot.
Among a crowded slate of initia
tives, the highlight was a measure
that would ban the $ 1 or $2 A I M sur
charges that are usually charged by
the owner of an A I M when the cus
tomer withdrawing money does not
have an account with that bank.
I he measure was leading, with
23.138 yes votes, 57 percent, to 17.64()
no votes, 43 percent.
"Charging two times doesn't
make sense," said San Francisco res
ident Roxanne Trade on Tuesday af
ternoon. "When it first came out we
didn't have to pay at all."
I Jnder the measure, banks would
still lie able to charge their own cus
tomers for making withdrawals at an
other bank.
There was little doubt the ban
would pass, but it is certain to face a
legal challenge from the banking in
dustry. which contends that federally
chartered banks are not subject lo
local laws. No court in the nation has
ruled specifically on an A I M fee ban.
In a recent poll, I lallinan and
Fazio were running even in the wake
of a San Francisco Chronicle story
that said the district attorney's office

had the lowest conviction rate in the
state at 32.5 percent. I lallinan argued
that a dropping crime rate and city di
version programs were responsible
lor the figure.
In the mayor's race, the savvy and
fashionable Brown, rarely seen with
out his fedora hats and designer suits,
lias had to deal with a number of
prickly issues. I le rashly promised at
the start of his term to fix the city's
public transit woes in 1(H) days; pa
trons ol the Municipal Railway's
buses and trolleys are still waiting.
An army of homeless people have
flocked to the city, which offers mod
erate weather and reasonable public
assistance. A few weeks ago. Brown
suggested police confiscate the shop
ping carts the homeless use to trans
port their possessions, then had to
back down after a roar of public dis
approval.
"I don't like Willie Brown." said
resident Antonio Beltran. who has
lived in the city for 20 years, including
Jordan's mayoral term. "Look
around. You can see Willie Brown
hasn't done anything about housing,
the homeless. Muni's stayed the
same. I feel more comfortable with
Jordan than Brown, and a lot of my
friends feel the same wav."

Other issues included soaring
rents and home prices; huge chain
stores moving into residential
neighborhoods; and an FBI investi
gation into how city contracts are
awarded.

San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown will soon be engaged in another
campaign, as he fights to retain his position as mayor in the upcom
ing runoff election.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
Mayor Willie Brown is headed for
a December runoff, but election
officials didn't expect to learn his
opponent until Wednesday morn
ing at the earliest.
Former police chief and mayor
Frank Jordan was a distant second
in early returns, but political con
sultant Clint Reilly was still in the
running, and counting write-in
votes for Board of Supervisors
President Tom Ammiano was ex
pected to take many more hours.
Brown, who would become the
first incumbent in 16 years to win
re-election if he survives the Dec.
14 runoff, acknowledged at his vic
tory party Tuesday night that San
Francisco is hard on its leaders.
"1 really thought I was what you
might call the cat's meow," the
powerful former speaker of the
California Assembly said, recalling
his first days as mayor.
"It would just be a matter of
minutes before San Francisco
would be completely turned
around. Well, did 1 get a rude
awakening," Brown said, 'i feel
sorry for those candidates, all those
big speeches they're making. They
have no idea how tough this job re
ally is."
With 16 percent of precincts re
porting. Brown had 21,555 votes,
50 percent, to Jordan's 10,238
votes, 24 percent. Reilly was third
with 7,304. or 17 percent.
The same returns showed just
76 votes for Ammiano, who
jumped into the race three weeks
before Election Dav. While the
other candidates spent millions on
the race, his grassroots campaign de
pended almost entirely on unpaid
volunteers.
Also fighting for re-election 'lues
day was District Attorney Terence
"Kayo" I lallinan, who faces four op
ponents.
Hallinan's strongest challenge
came from Bill Fazio, a former assis
tant district attorney who lost to I lal
linan in IWS and says I lallinan is
temperamentally unsuited for the
job. Fazio had 17.8 l X), or 45 percent,
to Hallinan's 13,316, or 34 percent.
Brown remained the odds-on la
vorite when voters went to the polls.
With a total of 15 candidates, howev
er. no one was expected to get a ma
jority. A runoff election would be
held Dec. 14.
Three weeks ago Ammiano, who
said last summer he wouldn't run.
jumped in as a write-in. Almost im
mediately, polls showed him tied
with Jordan and Reilly.
"I voted for Ammiano because
it's the real San Francisco style to
have some mayhem at the end: I love
that he did that, and 1 totally love that
it's a gay man who might have a
chance to be mayor here," said Adri
anne Mohr, 42, a medical educator,
after casting her ballot.
Among a crowded slate of initia
tives, the highlight was a measure
that would ban the $ 1 or $2 A I M sur
charges that are usually charged by
the owner of an A I M when the cus
tomer withdrawing money does not
have an account with that bank.
I he measure was leading, with
23.138 yes votes, 57 percent, to 17.64()
no votes, 43 percent.
"Charging two times doesn't
make sense," said San Francisco res
ident Roxanne Trade on Tuesday af
ternoon. "When it first came out we
didn't have to pay at all."
I Jnder the measure, banks would
still lie able to charge their own cus
tomers for making withdrawals at an
other bank.
There was little doubt the ban
would pass, but it is certain to face a
legal challenge from the banking in
dustry. which contends that federally
chartered banks are not subject lo
local laws. No court in the nation has
ruled specifically on an A I M fee ban.
In a recent poll, I lallinan and
Fazio were running even in the wake
of a San Francisco Chronicle story
that said the district attorney's office

had the lowest conviction rate in the
state at 32.5 percent. I lallinan argued
that a dropping crime rate and city di
version programs were responsible
lor the figure.
