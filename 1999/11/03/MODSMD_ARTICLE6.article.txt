Kresge with stories of serial killers

The best-selling author of "Mind
Hunter" and other books advocates
profiling, an investigative technique
of creating an image of the perpetra

and then looking for someone who

"To understand the art. you must
understand the artist," he said,
adding that a good crime investigator
will attempt to walk in the shoes of
both the perpetrator and the victim.
Douglas' experience with more
than 4,(XK) cases drew the attention of
Hollywood, which used his knowl
edge in the IWI movie "The Silence
of the Lambs."

civil trial of O. J. Simpson and the
Jonßenet Ramsey case. Using profil

not guilty of murdering their daugh

overused, means addinu the "how"

"who."
"Some people think it's akin to
witchcraft; I think it's akin to being an

internist in medicine." he said, saying

criminal would lit a particular case.
After joining the Bureau, he

worked in Detriot and underwent an
epiphany after arresting bookies on
