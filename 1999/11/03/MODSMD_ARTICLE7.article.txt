The ASSIJ and Stanfotd Student Enterprises
have teamed up to form the ASSI I / SSE Technol
ogy Group, which is designed to tackle the techno
logical needs of the two organizations.
"[The Technology Group) is unprecedented.
Never before has there been this type of coopera
tion between the ASSI I and the SSE." said ASSU
President Mike Levin, a junior.

The group, spearheaded by Co-Directors
Patrick Coffman and Ross Davisson, senior and
junior, respectively, will consolidate the ASSU
and the SSE Web sites, the (inline Course Guide,
the Draw Guide and many other such student-re
lated sites.
"We act as backbone and support, so to speak,
for much of what the ASSI I and the SSE bring to
the public eye." Coffman said.
The Ciroup will have many more functions than

what students can find online. Everything from up
grading to replacing hardware, to the installation
of software, to the management of ASSII / SSE
computer systems will fall under the jurisdiction of
the Technology Group.
Additionally, in the near future, students will be
able to access virtually whatever they want from
any Stanford computer.
