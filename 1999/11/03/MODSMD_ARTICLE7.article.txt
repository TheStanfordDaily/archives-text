The ASSIJ and Stanfotd Student Enterprises
have teamed up to form the ASSI I / SSE Technol
ogy Group, which is designed to tackle the techno
logical needs of the two organizations.
"[The Technology Group) is unprecedented.
Never before has there been this type of coopera
tion between the ASSI I and the SSE." said ASSU
President Mike Levin, a junior.

The group, spearheaded by Co-Directors
Patrick Coffman and Ross Davisson, senior and
junior, respectively, will consolidate the ASSU
and the SSE Web sites, the (inline Course Guide,
the Draw Guide and many other such student-re
lated sites.
"We act as backbone and support, so to speak,
for much of what the ASSI I and the SSE bring to
the public eye." Coffman said.
The Ciroup will have many more functions than

what students can find online. Everything from up
grading to replacing hardware, to the installation
of software, to the management of ASSII / SSE
computer systems will fall under the jurisdiction of
the Technology Group.
Additionally, in the near future, students will be
able to access virtually whatever they want from
any Stanford computer.
"(The Group) will create a Stan
ford portal' that any member of the
Stanford community could refer to
in order to find out anything about
Stanford — from information on
campus events to course schedules,"
Levin said.
Coordination between the two
groups, according to Levin, allows
them to create a much better product
than working separately.
The immediate functions of the
Group will be to create a central
Web site, to improve communica
tions in technology purchases, to co

ordinate resource allocation and to
foster an environment where future
Web-based projects can come to
fruition.
"We want communication be
tween both sides to utilize our as
sets," SSE President and CEO Sean
Lucy said. "We hope to have a tech
nological group that develops a cou
ple of businesses itself."
The Technology Group provides
a chance for more students to be
come involved in the ASSIJ and the
SSE. even if their interests do not fall
under the umbrella of business and
government. Both paid positions
and unpaid internships will be avail
able to interested students by con
tacting tc@sse.stanford.edu.

"The development of a Technok
ogy Group will both provide individ-.
uals with different skills and an
portunity to work within the ASSIf
and the SSE." Levin said, "and en
hance current projects and to better
implement future ones."
The Group is currently interview
ing people for a wide range ol posi
tions. ranging from graphic and web
designers to programming and sys
tem administrators to public rela
tions specialists.
"The best machinery in place to
support the project is continued and
increasing support that the ASSIJ
and SSE have been providing," C"off
man said. "Any additional help is
ways welcome." r
