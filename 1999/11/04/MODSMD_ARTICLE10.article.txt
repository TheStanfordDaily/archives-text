# North Korean threat rises

WASHINGTON (AP) —
North Korea's development of
weapons of mass destruction is
posing an increasing threat to the
United States and its allies,
according to a congressional
study.
In addition to chemical and
biological weapons, there is "sig
nificant evidence" that North
Korea is continuing to develop
nuclear weapons despite a com
mitment five years ago to remain
nuclear-free, the report released
Wednesday found.
Also, a dramatic improvement
in North Korea's missile capabili
ties now permits the country to
reach U.S. territory with a "high
explosive chemical, biological or
possibly nuclear weapon," accord
ing to the report. "Currently, the
United States is unable to defend
against this threat."
The study was carried out by
the North Korea Advisory Group,
made up of senior members of
Congress. The group was formed
at the request of House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who asked
for a report on North Korea's mil
itary capabilities.
In releasing the report, the
chairman of the House Interna
tional Relations Committee, GOP
Rep. Benjamin Gilman of New
York, said it was "inexplicable and
inexcusable" that the Clinton
administration negotiated a deal
with North Korea in 1994 that did
not block North Korean efforts to
acquire nuclear weapons.
The report said the progress
that North Korea "has made over
the past five years in improving its
missile capabilities, its record as a
major proliferator of ballistic mis
siles and missile technology, com
bined with its development activi
ties on nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons, ranks North
Korea with Russia and China as
one of the greatest missile prolifer
ation threats in the world."
State Department officials said
they had not seen the report. But
they reaffirmed the administra

tion's view that the 1994 agree
ment froze North Korean plutoni
um production, thereby depriving
Pyongyang of the ability to pro
duce a "significant number of
nuclear weapons."
As for the allegation in the
report of an undeclared North
Korean nuclear weapons project,
the official recalled that U.S. tech
nical experts were granted access
to a suspect site last spring and
found no nuclear-related activity
there. The experts have been
assured continuing access to the
site. &
If similar suspect activities
being carried out elsewhere, ths£
administration would raise ths*
issue with the North Koreans,
the official, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
In a report last month, former '
Defense Secretary William Perry, ■
a special adviser on North Korea j
policy, suggested he shares some
of the same concerns as the con- ;
gressional advisory group. He
acknowledged that "serious con
cerns" remain about possible
"continuing nuclear-related work
in North Korea."
On the missile front, officials
pointed out that U.S.-North Kore
an negotiations led two months
ago to an agreement by
Pyongyang not to engage in fur
ther testing of long-range missiles
so long as the negotiating channel
with the United States remains
open.
One critic of the congressional
report, the president of the Insti
tute for Science and International
Security, said the group of law
makers was giving a "hyped up
account" of the actual situation in
North Korea.
"Exaggerating the situation
may be necessary for the report to
conclude affirmatively that
threat to U.S. security from North
Korea's nuclear weapons is
greater today than five years
However, a more bafanceaV
approach may have concluded thqjfi
opposite," David Albright said.
