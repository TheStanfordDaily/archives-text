## Editorial Declining enrollment 
### 
Has Proposition 209
deterred minorities from
\
applying to Stanford?

On Tuesday, The Stanford
Daily reported that the
Medical School's minority
enrollment dropped from 20 percent
in 1998 to 14 percent in 1999. Given
how small the representation of
minorities was to begin with, this 6-
percent drop is staggering.
According to the Daily article,
researchers and Medical School
administrators are speculating that
the decrease might be a result of
Proposition 209, a California mandate
that bans affirmative action programs
statewide. If they can find further evi
dence of Prop. 209's effect on minori
ty enrollment in California schools,
the worst fears of the measure's oppo
nents will have been confirmed.
At this point, the question of
Prop. 209's direct effect on enroll
ment is still inconclusive. However,
the fact that half of a 7-percent drop
in Medical School minority applica
tions comes from four states with
affirmative-action bans has frighten
ing implications.
Stanford, which is not a govern
ment institution and is therefore free
of the chains of Prop. 209, is not clos
ing its doors to minorities. Nor is the
measure actively preventing minori
ties from applying to California
schools, be they public or private.
Prop. 209 is intended to keep admis
sions policies on level ground
between white students and minori
ties â€” which makes sense from a
Constitutional standpoint.
However, Prop. 209 has repercus
sions that go beyond the technicali
ties and into the social arena. Since

its inception, this measure has had a
high profile in the media, and its
passing into law is a cause for misun
derstanding, leading minority stu
dents to look outside the state when
applying to schools.
This is an unfortunate effect for
the state. California has often been
able to pride itself on having a very
diverse population, an advanced
educational system and an open
minded set of laws. With a 30-per
cent drop in minority admissions at
University of California schools
after Prop. 209's instatement, it
seems to be a step back from this
progress.
Of course, pointing the finger to
Prop. 209 cannot completely account
for the drop in minority enrollment.
The matter is more complicated than
that. It is entirely possible that this
year's statistics are an anomaly, and
enrollment will jump back up next
year. It will take time to truly gauge
Prop. 209's effects.
But it is clear that in the long run,
a measure as intimidating as Prop.
209 is going to hinder Stanford's
largely California-based applicant
pool. Affirmative action may not be
the ideal solution, but a ban with lit
tle or no alternative for minority
encouragement is even worse.
Right now our hands are tied,
because Prop. 209 is an approved
and enforced state initiative. How
ever, programs such as the Stanford
Black Pre-Medical Organization go
a long way toward bringing minori
ties to graduate schools where their
representation is sorely needed. Stu
dents, faculty and administrators
alike must work to keep these orga
nizations strong and assemble a legal
alternative to Prop. 209 before
minority enrollment drops even
more drastically.
