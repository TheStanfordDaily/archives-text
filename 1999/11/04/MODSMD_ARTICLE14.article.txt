# Meaning in the macro
## Time for a much-needed break

Some frighteningly
inexplicable freak
accident last week
end caused a Cairo-bound
commerical airliner to
become an instantaneous
deadweight in the sky,
plummeting 38,000 feet

into the ocean off the coast of Nantucket
Island.
For many of us isolated within the Stan
ford bubble, this was a grave reality check.
We are so easily inclined to forget that out
side of the narrow track of lectures, prob
lem sets and club meetings every day, there
is in fact a larger and non-insular world sur
rounding us.
Crises and disasters, whether earth
quakes or hijackings or civil wars, have an
amazing tendency to urge a time-out, a
pause in which time to contemplate the pre
cariousness of the lives we live. Our other
wise constant preoccupation with social
obligations and academic tasks limits us.
Too often we only see as far as Friday and
define the limits of our universe by the trees
on Palm Drive.
But the world is larger than our massive
Farm; it's just masked by gorgeous weather
and constant daily momentum. And we are
limited by our perpetual lack of time.
A freshman from Greece recently
remarked how strange it is that people at
Stanford never stop talking about time and
how little of it they have. We can't make
dinner with friends because we are
"strapped for time," we skip dorm pro
grams because we are "way-stressed" with
work, and we bail on classes to catch up on
sleep. A midweek errand to Palo Alto
seems like an insurmountable obstacle, and
a meeting the night before a midterm is an
unbearable chore.
So where does the time go? There are
only so many classes and meetings during
the day. leaving us wondering why 24 hours
is never quite enough. We too often reach
midnight and have to strain to think about
what productivity (if any) actually tran
spired since the time we woke up. We are
constantly in a rush and are forever can

celling dinners and hangouts because our
schedules are too busy.
Call it procrastination or overcommit
ment; blame psychology that makes us
repeatedly leave papers and exam studying
to the night before. Whatever it is, Stanford
students are extremely busy. The freshmen
are scrambling to find a niche, the sopho
mores a major, the juniors some perspective
on how fast time Hies and the seniors ... a
career.
As such, global disasters are a rare wake
up call to remind us that there is a world out
there.
1 remember when the Gulf War broke
out in seventh grade; the constant school
momentum took a hiatus for once. For the
first time, teachers were' forgiving about
class time and made exceptions. We
watched CNN in social studies. Late or for
gotten homework was suddenly not a prob
lem, and teachers recognized the fact that
there were larger concerns in life than a
missed class. For a week or so, detention
was conspicuously unattended.
The Hood in Green Library two years
ago was a similar phenomenon. I noticed
how readily people rally to volunteer and
help out in the wake of natural disaster
Maybe the inspiration was the-welcome
vacation from classes for a day (with the
exception of a Hum Bio midterm, thanks to
quick-thinking course assistants). Maybe we
were just sufficiently energy-charged from
mattress rides the night before which began
at the waterfall outside Kappa Sig and con
tinued to the Green Library delta. Whatev
er it was, students rallied en masse, flocking
to Green in droves to reshelve books and
salvage the rain-soaked material.
Similar stamina coaxes relief funds for
earthquakes and hurricanes that dessimate
villages at home or abroad. These events
make us stop temporarily and recognize the
gravity of disaster to which we are by no
means immune by virtue of living at Stan
ford. A wake-up call indeed. A pause.
But the pause is brief. We have other
things to do, more deadlines to meet and
only a limited amount of time to contem
plate a situation removed from our own

realm. I felt like the U.S. bombing of
Afghanastan and the Sudan just over a year
ago inspired a mild cocktail conversation
shock but faded very rapidly, so that lives
could continue.
I was in Cape Town just days after the
bombing of the Planet Hollywood restau
rant. The shock and anxiety had been and
gone. Everyone was back in regular daily
routine, and the media had more pressing
stories to cover, like the tourists canoeing
down the Zambeze River who got attacked
by a crocodile. That's the truth.
The fact is, we don't have time to take
time out. I remember having second
thoughts about taking a week off school for
my own grandfather's funeral in London
because I fell I would miss too much. Some
times even when we would welcome the
chance for personal time or introspective
thought, it's just not feasible to schedule it.
Eygpt Air provided us with the opportu
nity to stop and reflect, to imagine what it
would feel like to free-fall for two minutes,
knowing that those two minutes would be
your last. And then we moved on after
thinking "Oh, how awful," and headed to
the library to cram for a midterm so we'd
have time to the M

the chance, take a break. In fact, take a

you graduate. Take a walk. Sit outside

can all benefit from a little time out.

So where does the time go? There are
only so many classes and meetings during
the day. leaving us wondering why 24 hours
is never quite enough. We too often reach
midnight and have to strain to think about
what productivity (if any) actually tran
spired since the time we woke up. We are
constantly in a rush and are forever can

celling dinners and hangouts because our
schedules are too busy.
Call it procrastination or overcommit
ment; blame psychology that makes us
repeatedly leave papers and exam studying
to the night before. Whatever it is, Stanford
students are extremely busy. The freshmen
are scrambling to find a niche, the sopho
mores a major, the juniors some perspective
on how fast time Hies and the seniors ... a
career.
As such, global disasters are a rare wake
up call to remind us that there is a world out
there.
1 remember when the Gulf War broke
out in seventh grade; the constant school
momentum took a hiatus for once. For the
first time, teachers were' forgiving about
class time and made exceptions. We
watched CNN in social studies. Late or for
gotten homework was suddenly not a prob
lem, and teachers recognized the fact that
there were larger concerns in life than a
missed class. For a week or so, detention
was conspicuously unattended.
The Hood in Green Library two years
ago was a similar phenomenon. I noticed
how readily people rally to volunteer and
help out in the wake of natural disaster
Maybe the inspiration was the-welcome
vacation from classes for a day (with the
exception of a Hum Bio midterm, thanks to
quick-thinking course assistants). Maybe we
were just sufficiently energy-charged from
mattress rides the night before which began
at the waterfall outside Kappa Sig and con
tinued to the Green Library delta. Whatev
er it was, students rallied en masse, flocking
to Green in droves to reshelve books and
salvage the rain-soaked material.
Similar stamina coaxes relief funds for
earthquakes and hurricanes that dessimate
villages at home or abroad. These events
make us stop temporarily and recognize the
gravity of disaster to which we are by no
means immune by virtue of living at Stan
ford. A wake-up call indeed. A pause.
But the pause is brief. We have other
things to do, more deadlines to meet and
only a limited amount of time to contem
plate a situation removed from our own

realm. I felt like the U.S. bombing of
Afghanastan and the Sudan just over a year
ago inspired a mild cocktail conversation
shock but faded very rapidly, so that lives
could continue.
I was in Cape Town just days after the
bombing of the Planet Hollywood restau
rant. The shock and anxiety had been and
gone. Everyone was back in regular daily
routine, and the media had more pressing
stories to cover, like the tourists canoeing
down the Zambeze River who got attacked
by a crocodile. That's the truth.
The fact is, we don't have time to take
time out. I remember having second
thoughts about taking a week off school for
my own grandfather's funeral in London
because I fell I would miss too much. Some
times even when we would welcome the
chance for personal time or introspective
thought, it's just not feasible to schedule it.
Eygpt Air provided us with the opportu
nity to stop and reflect, to imagine what it
would feel like to free-fall for two minutes,
knowing that those two minutes would be
your last. And then we moved on after
thinking "Oh, how awful," and headed to
the library to cram for a midterm so we'd
have time to the M
•• 1 must liTtWij; we jtiM
don't kncwhnwt» i properly afccess it. We're
all busy; we're all overcommited, but 1 hate
to think that disasters are the only stimulus
we get to break routine. So I say, if you get
the chance, take a break. In fact, take a
break even if you don't have the chance.
Spend this coming weekend with friends
who you won't get to see every day once
you graduate. Take a walk. Sit outside
(without books). Maybe even watch TV.
Just admit it. It's got to be possible. We
can all benefit from a little time out.
