Waiting for a response from
Casper
I am writing to respond to Monday's edi
torial regarding Casper's role in the labor dis
pute at Stanford hospital. It is wrong to dis
miss President Casper from all responsibility
of the pressing issues at Stanford Hospital.
It is inappropriate to suggest that Presi
dent Casper, who has the power to dissolve
tl\e merger, does not have power over the
rifreetion of the hospital's labor relations.
JVhilc it is true that there is a negotiating
foam of managers and a Director of Labor
Relations at Stanford Hospital, Casper has
Essentially asserted himself as the Director of
jj»e Hospital and thus must face the demands
of the workers as negotiations arc brought to
this process of negotiations,
(Rfhard Casper has been a member of the
Mftcutivc Committee of the Board of Direc
■fes. As such, he holds the responsibility of
Iffrcssing all issues facing the hospital. This
ifcscn path of silence is no longer an option.

missal of the labor situation at the hospital.
The real issues are:
No. 1: A fair and decent wage that workers
can count on.

to respect and honor the contract agreed to
by UCSF-Stanford and the union.

It is with great joy that 1 write my first let
ter to The Daily in response to GU Lopez's
editorial of Nov. 3. Like Gil, I am Mexican-
American, born to. two Mexican parents.
And like Gil, I do not live up to the hype. *
I've been called a sell out — a vendida —
because I chose to not wave the Mexican flag
and preach about La Raza. I do not believe
in affirmative action and have been taunted
by my fellow Latino classmates for it. 1
believe it to be a dangerous tool that under
mines those who have given it everything
they've got to be here.
Like Gil, I have heard the whispers:
"Maybe she got into Stanford because she's
Latina." And yes, that is their own miscon
ception, but it still serves to subvert every
thing I have worked for. It conveys a very
dangerous message: that I am only here

today hccausc my last name is Torres — in
other words, because I am Mexican.
And that is wrong. I made it by virtue of
hard work and by never seeing myself as
"less than" anyone else. 1 never got a com
plex over being a minority and assumed I
was due preferential treatment becausc 1
grew up in La Puente — a poor little town by
comparison — or because 1 ate frijoles and
tortillas for breakfast. The thought never
occurred to me that because I was a minori
ty. I was owed something. I never even real
ized that I was a minority and therefore
somehow "different" until I got to college.
So I am not "La Raza," not "MeCHA,"
not for affirmative action and I don't believe
in parading around for "La Lucha." But
when it comes to my heritage, I am Mexican
by virtue of my two wonderful parents hav
ing been born there and having passed along
to us the traditions of their beautiful culture.
I was taught about the unbreakable tics of
family and of absolute loyalty to brothers
and sisters. I grew up hearing my father and
grandfather — a mariachi for 50 years — sing
the songs of their home. I had menudo on
Sundays after Church. Espanol en la casa
todo los dias. Believe me. I am authentic
Latina.
But I am an American too. The coalesc
ing of the two is a delicate art but one I have
always felt conformable in.
I am the new breed of Chicana — the one
that doesn't have to be wrapped in a Mexi
can flag to "prove" her heritage, the one that
is educated and holds on to strong family val
ues. The one that is traditional, yet modern.
I am the Chicana that is very patriotic to
her country. I feel it in my heart when they
play the national anthem, and I feel it in my

heart when I read of those who gave their
lives for our freedom. I would fight for my
country, and I would die for my country —
for my America — because this is where my
loyalty is. I believe in the American dream.
It's what I am, what I live for, what I aspire
to. I do not feel that for Mexico in any way.
This is home. This is who 1 am. I am an
American by birth and culture. Latina by
heritage and ethnicity, and am exceedingly
proud to be both.

Mausoleum party a disgrace
Halloween is hallowed evening, all Souls
Day, when we pray for the deceased, espe
cially our parents. In Catholic countries thou
sands go to the cemeteries and lay flowers on
graves. Only in the U.S. has it become an
occasion for gross entertainment, a profana
tion of a solemn day of remembrance.
At Stanford last year, students made
whexipee outside the Stanford Mausoleum, a
gratuitous insult to the dead benefactors.
Despite protests, this year's celebration was
even grosser. The noise was such that
protests came from people living a long dis
tance away. The department of public safety
shut down the party at 11:45 p.m., over the
protests of the revelers.
Are these our brightest and best? If so,
God help this country. Stanford used to be
known as The Farm. Now it should be called
the Animal Farm.

Waiting for a response from
Casper
I am writing to respond to Monday's edi
torial regarding Casper's role in the labor dis
pute at Stanford hospital. It is wrong to dis
miss President Casper from all responsibility
of the pressing issues at Stanford Hospital.
It is inappropriate to suggest that Presi
dent Casper, who has the power to dissolve
tl\e merger, does not have power over the
rifreetion of the hospital's labor relations.
JVhilc it is true that there is a negotiating
foam of managers and a Director of Labor
Relations at Stanford Hospital, Casper has
Essentially asserted himself as the Director of
jj»e Hospital and thus must face the demands
of the workers as negotiations arc brought to
this process of negotiations,
(Rfhard Casper has been a member of the
Mftcutivc Committee of the Board of Direc
■fes. As such, he holds the responsibility of
Iffrcssing all issues facing the hospital. This
ifcscn path of silence is no longer an option.
decoupling of UCSF-Stanford places the
rt3jb< msibility of addressing workers' con
figis squarely on Casper's shoulders.
*% is inappropriate for The Daily to "cred
-4 gasper for putting himself at the front line
*{3iis announcement and not hiding behind
lAjßkesmen." Along the same lines, the
I takers at Stanford and Packard hospitals
call on him to put himself truly on the
42it line and deal with their concerns.
I Ws the president of this university, Casper
ilMccountablc to all parts of the Stanford
ii®munity: patients, workers, students and
All of these groups have raised con
j»s regarding Casper's continuous dis

missal of the labor situation at the hospital.
The real issues are:
No. 1: A fair and decent wage that workers
can count on.
No. 2: A commitment form President Casper
to respect and honor the contract agreed to
by UCSF-Stanford and the union.
No. 3: 'ITie right for all employees at Stanford
and Lucile Packard Hospitals to organize in
a fair and democratic way without interfer

We as workers are not going away, and
we as a union demand a response from Pres

Enjoying the best of both
worlds
It is with great joy that 1 write my first let
ter to The Daily in response to GU Lopez's
editorial of Nov. 3. Like Gil, I am Mexican-
American, born to. two Mexican parents.
And like Gil, I do not live up to the hype. *
I've been called a sell out — a vendida —
because I chose to not wave the Mexican flag
and preach about La Raza. I do not believe
in affirmative action and have been taunted
by my fellow Latino classmates for it. 1
believe it to be a dangerous tool that under
mines those who have given it everything
they've got to be here.
Like Gil, I have heard the whispers:
"Maybe she got into Stanford because she's
Latina." And yes, that is their own miscon
ception, but it still serves to subvert every
thing I have worked for. It conveys a very
dangerous message: that I am only here

today hccausc my last name is Torres — in
other words, because I am Mexican.
And that is wrong. I made it by virtue of
hard work and by never seeing myself as
"less than" anyone else. 1 never got a com
plex over being a minority and assumed I
was due preferential treatment becausc 1
grew up in La Puente — a poor little town by
comparison — or because 1 ate frijoles and
tortillas for breakfast. The thought never
occurred to me that because I was a minori
ty. I was owed something. I never even real
ized that I was a minority and therefore
somehow "different" until I got to college.
So I am not "La Raza," not "MeCHA,"
not for affirmative action and I don't believe
in parading around for "La Lucha." But
when it comes to my heritage, I am Mexican
by virtue of my two wonderful parents hav
ing been born there and having passed along
to us the traditions of their beautiful culture.
I was taught about the unbreakable tics of
family and of absolute loyalty to brothers
and sisters. I grew up hearing my father and
grandfather — a mariachi for 50 years — sing
the songs of their home. I had menudo on
Sundays after Church. Espanol en la casa
todo los dias. Believe me. I am authentic
Latina.
But I am an American too. The coalesc
ing of the two is a delicate art but one I have
always felt conformable in.
I am the new breed of Chicana — the one
that doesn't have to be wrapped in a Mexi
can flag to "prove" her heritage, the one that
is educated and holds on to strong family val
ues. The one that is traditional, yet modern.
I am the Chicana that is very patriotic to
her country. I feel it in my heart when they
play the national anthem, and I feel it in my

heart when I read of those who gave their
lives for our freedom. I would fight for my
country, and I would die for my country —
for my America — because this is where my
loyalty is. I believe in the American dream.
It's what I am, what I live for, what I aspire
to. I do not feel that for Mexico in any way.
This is home. This is who 1 am. I am an
American by birth and culture. Latina by
heritage and ethnicity, and am exceedingly
proud to be both.

Mausoleum party a disgrace
Halloween is hallowed evening, all Souls
Day, when we pray for the deceased, espe
cially our parents. In Catholic countries thou
sands go to the cemeteries and lay flowers on
graves. Only in the U.S. has it become an
occasion for gross entertainment, a profana
tion of a solemn day of remembrance.
At Stanford last year, students made
whexipee outside the Stanford Mausoleum, a
gratuitous insult to the dead benefactors.
Despite protests, this year's celebration was
even grosser. The noise was such that
protests came from people living a long dis
tance away. The department of public safety
shut down the party at 11:45 p.m., over the
protests of the revelers.
Are these our brightest and best? If so,
God help this country. Stanford used to be
known as The Farm. Now it should be called
the Animal Farm.
