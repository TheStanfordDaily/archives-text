# Reality in small doses
## Kick off your Sunday shoes and relax

I woke up last Sunday and began my rit
ual eleaning session. I threw out the
garbage, put away my elothes and
changed my sheets. I arranged all my
books in my bookshelf by size and then
divided the clothes in my closet into for
mal, evening and everyday wear. 1 taped a
list of all of my week's engagements and
assignments to my desk, and then I cut,
painted and polished my nails. 1 was now
ready to begin my week.
This mechanical ordering of my life has
become such a habit with me that I do not
even think about it. It never occurs to me
to wonder why I do not write in my books
and why 1 cannot stand it when people
scribble on my notebook. 1 never question
why I wash my hands over 20 times a day
and never touch door handles if I can help
it.
I shocked a friend by almost walking
out of a movie theater when I realized that
1 had been given diet instead of regular
soda with my popcorn. "These are my lit
tle obsessions, no big deal," 1 laugh when

ever someone asks why I eat pasta and
chicken sitting on one plate with different
forks.
1 was truly offended when a friend said
that 1 reminded him of Elaine in "Sein
field." 1 told my parents they were insensi
tive and uncaring when they informed me
that I needed to get over my various neu
roses in order to be a functioning human
being.
In fact, the only reason that I realized
that 1 was a control freak at all is because
my friend Julia told me that if I wanted my
column to be meaningful, 1 would have to
expose my own frailties as well as every
one else's. So 1 started thinking about my
quirks and realized that my somewhat
obsessive-compulsive behavior is not nor
mal.
There are three potential explanations
for this need for control in my life. The
first is that 1 have a mental disorder. The
second is that I am a spoiled brat too used
to getting her own way. However, as both
of these are personally distasteful, I am

going to have to opt for explanation No. 3.
I crave control because it serves to
mask my own insecurities. If I can arrange
everything exactly the way 1 want it.in
some order that 1 decide is "good." then I
am always dealing with life on my terms. 1
am not vulnerable because I am always in
control.
No one can hurt me if I choose my
friends carefully enough. No one can
break my heart if 1 never fall in love
because that involves surrendering too
much autonomy. No one can intrude on
my space if I always act with deliberation.
I perpetually want to have the power to
decide who I am, what I want and where I
am going.
The problem is that 1 therefore never
accept life as it happens. And when unan
ticipated events occur, 1 am woefully
unprepared to deal with them because
they confuse my structured existence.
Spontaneity is practically impossible
when each second of each day is carefully
scheduled into a planner. I rarely have

time for myself because I always have
something set up to do at any given sec
ond. When I actually do deviate from my
pre-arranged plans, I never do anything
fun because I feel guilty.
Worst of all. I cannot seem to enjoy a
moment without trying to analyze it and fit
it into my "script" for life. I remember an
incident that occurred when I was taking a
ride with a friend in a cherry-red Mustang
with the hood down. Music was blasting,
the twilight air was warm, and we felt
great.
1 said. "I can't wait to get home to write
about this in my scrapbook."
My friend looked at me and responded
sharply, "Mariam, you never savor a feel
ing, you are tot) busy recording it for
future use."
1 know that 1 am not the only person
who spends too much time organizing life
and too little time enjoying it. In fact,
many Stanford students I meet have "little
obsessions" that bog them down as well.
We all know people who clean around the

keys of their keyboard with the sticky end!
of Post-it notes or who wince if you move|
a single item in their room.
What are we afraid of anyway?
Our lives are not going to collapse if we'
do something out of our ordinary routine.'
If we skip a meeting, a class, or even a
homework assignment — we will survive.!
Our friends will continue to love is if oun
rooms are messy, and our families will ooti
disown us for watching television on a!
weeknight.
Being silly and spontaneous and fleXf-'
ble is part of the point of college. The rejtJ
of our lives will probably be controlled;
enough, so as my Mom told me this sufi-|
mer, "Honey, get over it."

Murium's mother always has handy practical'
advice on hand. Upon reading this colutrki |
she accused Murium of trying to foist her oyn j
neuroses on the rest of the Stanford campki. •
Murium has always been misunderstood.
