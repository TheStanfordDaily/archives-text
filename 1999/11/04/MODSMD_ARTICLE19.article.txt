## 
### 
In an ('Circle shared by a
group of environmentalists at
various universities around the
nation, Accursed Kartii founder
Anthony Redwood used his
eCirele's voicechat feature to
announce his shocking discov
ery that the Illinois-sized hole in
the ozone appearing over the
South Pole was caused by a sin
gle Holstein.
"So, there I was," Ivy .lames
said, the other members listen
ing carefully to his words
thanks to the voicechat feature,
"hanging helplessly from the
factory smokestack, with the
owner's brat kids below with
their 88-"

"(Juys you're not going to believe
this," Redwood broke in, as he
joined thee Circle from his com
puter in Lander, Wyoming. "I was
at the Flying Z Ranch a night ago."
"Did Big Lirry rope you and
brand you like he did John?" asked
Lilac Sunset, speaking from
Pullman, Washington.
"No. It was ;l:(K) am, and 1 was in
bis northern pasture with my
methanol net er, going behind all the
cows and taking readings, when 1
smelled this horrible stench. Like a
truck full of rotten eggs crashed in
a paper-mill town. Suddenly, I .jiusl
passed out.
"I woke up an hour later with
this migraine. And it still smelled

godawful. I got up to go take sonic
more readings, and the needle to
iny methiuioineter was stuck in the
red. 1 whacked it a couple times,
and it didn't move. All the cows
were gone, except for this one in
the distance, eating out of a trough.
I put my shirt over my head,
plugged my nose and ran towards
it. The smell got worse tin* closer
I got"
"I finally made it to the trough,
and looked inside," Redwood con
tinued. "They were feeding the stu
pid thing pinto beans! 1 couldn't
believe it! 1 was delirious from the
smell, and stumbled back to my
ear. I drove a few miles before
pulling over for the night. C> that

morning I woke up to the
sound of an explosion.
Deafening. Soon the cops
showed up and all they found
was a scorched lighter and one
of boots with his foot
still in it."
"Deserved it, the bastard,"
Lilac replied.
"Maybe ranchers will take it
<is a sign from God to stop
mining our planet," said Ivy.
"But listen to this,"
Redwood exclaimed, "I read
today in Knviro-Watch that the
hole in the ozone has shrunk
slightly for the first time ever!"
There was online cheering
.ill around.


Harmless cow, or planet killer? eCircler Anthony Redwood claims to have proof that Lilly is the latter.
