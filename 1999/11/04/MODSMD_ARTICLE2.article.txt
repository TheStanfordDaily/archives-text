# New site offers resources during emergency events
## 
### Roger Kim Contributing writer 
In an effort to communicate emergency
information more efficiently. University
News Services and University Communica
tions have developed a Web site that will up
date instructions and critical information in
the case of an emergency on campus. After a
drill two weeks ago, the site is up and running.

'The site can have many
audiences, mostly students
and faculty, but also parents
who are concerned about their
sons and daughters.'
â€” Web Managing Editor Andy Krackov

According to Stanford Web Managing
Editor Andy Krackov, the Web site
(http://emergency.stanford.edu) was planned
in the wake of floods that caused damage on
campus during the winter of 1998.
"We ran a link on the Stanford homepage
to a Stanford Report article on the flood. It
was interesting to see that the story was the
most viewed article of that day's issue,'" he
said.
The Web site has minimal graphics, allow
ing it to toad quickly. It will post emergency
updates as frequently as necessary, depend
ing on the nature of the emergency.
Krackov said the Web site will relay emer
gency information beyond the Stanford com
munitv.

"The site can have many audiences, most
ly students and faculty, but also parents who
are concerned about their sons and daugh
ters,"he said. "Alumni and the local commu
nity will be able to upload the site and to view
the information posted."
The Web site is one of many emergency in
formation resources on campus. The Univer
sity operates three different emergency tele
phone lines giving bulletins on facility dam
age.
The emergency communication system
was tested on Oct. 20 with a computer-simu
lated power-outage drill. The Emergency
Preparedness Planning Steering Committee,
which is in charge of campus emergency situ
ations. coordinated the full-day power outage
and extended outage scenarios.
According to Committee officer Roni
Gordon of Environmental Health and Safe
ty, the Stanford Emergency Center and its 26
satellite centers participated in the drill.
" Through the scenario we tested our Y2K
preparedness and also the phone hotlines and
all communications systems, including the
Web site," Gordon said.
Gordon said the drill was a success and
"good practice to what we would do in the ac
tual situation." ~
In some emergencies, however, the net
work could break down, making the new
Web site inaccessible.
But Krackov said the Web site is "one of
the ways to communicate emergency infor
mation and not the only one In essence
the Web site is to encourage the same [emer
gency information] communication that oc
curs through the phone lines."
