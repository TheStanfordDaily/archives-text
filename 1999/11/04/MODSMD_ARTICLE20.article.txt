# Crew Team Member Admits "Enjoying It"
## Other rowers label her liar. 
### 
In an eCircle of crow team
members that was created by
Bob Kroyer, a coxswain at Green
Bough University, one rower
shocked other members by writ
ing that she actually enjoys crew.
"Unlike the rest of you, I don't
participate in crew because I feel
like I'm paying some penance for
wrongs committed in this or a
past life," typed Chase Angier,
star of the Dancer University
crew team. "I just like doing it."
"Yeah, right," typed David
Harrington, a junior crew mem
ber at Santa Barbara State.
Harrington's response w;is
indicative of the Crew eCircle's
reaction to Angier's claim. In
fact, all but one of the other TH

Crew eCircle members say the only reason they row is because they
deserve to be stuck in a living hell.
"I was a horrible child, and often shoplifted candy and toys from the
local drugmart. I deserve the insane hours and physical punishment that
rowing offers me," typed Alfi Spandsender, who occupies the fourth posi
tion at Schneider Tech.
"Hey, I shoplifted, too!" typed Miiko Martin of UCFS, "But I did it as a
teenager. 1 stole halter tops."
"I assassinated a top political figure in an Eastern Block country," typed
in Zubrav Slodeniac, a rising crew star at Femrose U. His shocking words
were met with virtual silence. "Just kidding," he continued. "1 just blew up
a bunch of frogs."
"Well, 1 don't feel like I've done anything wrong," replied Mark Bongi, a
junior crew member at St. Sartre I University. "I'm just seriously into sado
inasochisni and therefore relish the inhumane torture that rowing offers.
The only thing that could make it better for me would be if the coxswain
had a whip. Leather uniforms would be cool, too."
Bongi's honesty was greeted with virtual applause all around, and the
other members typed words of support for his admit ting his fetish. This
reaction was in sUirk contrast to the group's reaction to Angier's claim of
enjoyment in absence of a sexual abnormality.
"You're a freaking liar. No self-respecting rower actually has any fun
doing this," wrote Jane Chang of Scotty St., forgetting for a moment that
she actually has no self-respect. After Chang's comment, Kroyer, the Crew
eCircle founder, decided to kick Angier out of the Crew eCircle.
In other crew news, the United Nations will vote today on whether or
not to condemn the Israeli government's use of crew practice to force con
fessions from alleged terrorists.
