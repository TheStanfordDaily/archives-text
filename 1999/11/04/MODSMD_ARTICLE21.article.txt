# Graduates Headed to Wall St., Silicon Valley, Attica to Stay in Touch Via eCircles
## 
### 
It's a bittersweet time at
Persimmon University, as this
yesir's seniors begin to grasp that
after this final year, they will have
to leave the warm bosom of their
companions and take separate
paths into the world. One closely
knit group of friends, however, is
determined never to grow apart,
and has created an eCircle on
www.eCiroles.com, where they will
be able to have private chats online,
as well as share photos and music.
For this group of seniors in partic
ular, staying in touch is especially
important, as they recently learned
that their close friend Thomas
Hherd is going to prison for being
an arsonist, running a slave labor
ring and stealing a golf cart.
"Sure, it's kinda unexpected,"
wrote John Walters during the
group's first online meeting on
eCircles. "But, he's still ourfriend."
John's excited to start a job as an
assistant trader on W;ill Street.
"Besides, a lot of this stuff was
happening (hiring midterms,"
responded Mary Goldberg, who
plans to head to Silicon Valley to
begin a career with a software com
pany "And people just handle stress
differently. But, from what I under
stand, the curriculum won't be
too demanding at Attica, ha ha!"
The group shared a collective
virtual laugh.
"S— happens," Brian Hurley
added from FYague, as he traveled
through Europe while taking the

semester off. "And it's not like I'll
act any differently towsirds him just
because he made a few bad judge
ment calls."
"The thing that really freaks me
out," typed Janet Mullin, who was
off vacationing in Aspen when she
heard the news of I (herd's surest,
"is that Thomas wsis alwsiys sisking
to borrow matches from me, and I
gsive them to him. But he ssiid they
were for the I >; it broom."
"He once asked me if I hsul si
blowtorch he could borrow," Brian
wrote. "I wsls like, why would I have
si blowtorch in my dormroom? But,
to be honest, I didn't think much
about it."
The group hopes ths»t in si few
months Thomas will be able to
join their eCircle from Attica
Correctional Facility, provided
he's not restrained by a straight
jacket and can use the fsicility's
computers.
"1 just hope things won't be too
awkwsird," typed Jane Kang, who's
hoping to be sin sul appraiser's
sissistant in New York City.
"I just hope Tom gets out soon,"
replied Mary. "He's got si bunch of
my CDs and they wouldn't let me
through the crime-scene tape to
gnib them."
"Me too!" typed John.
"Me too!" sigreed Brian.
"(Josh, I can't believe him,"
wrote Msiry, before the group
disbanded until next week. "Whsit
a weasel."
