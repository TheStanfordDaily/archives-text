# Poodle Sues Owner Over Photos
## 
### 
Proving once again that the
poodle is the most intelligent
breed of canines, a white
standard named "Curly" has
slapped his owner with a lawsuit
charging that photos of him
displayed in an eCirele were dis
paraging and posted without his
permission.
Speaking through noted
animal rights attorney Hex
Ishibashi, Curly claims that pho
tos of him wearing glasses,
bowties, silly hats and sweaters

.ire unflattering, and could hurt his reputation with "the bitches."
"It's akin to posting photos of a human rolling around in the
grass nude, or urinating on a tree," said Ishibashi at a late after
noon press conference held in front of Curly's dog house. "How
would you like thjit? Huh? Huh?!" Ishibashi then added, "You
wouldn't like it at all now, would you? Huh? Huh?!"
Christopher Chaffin, who rescued Curly from a shelter eight
years ago, was shocked to learn of the suit, which asks for $400,(MX)
in liver biscuits, the light to run free in the neighbortiood two hours
a day, and ajxilogies in both his eCirele of friends and on the cable
network "Hie Domestic Animal Channel."
"Of course I'm upset," said Chaffin, "Curly is like my own
flesh and blood. I was just using the photosharing feature on
my eCirele to show what I thought were cute photos to my friends
mid family."
The suit brings up many legal questions. Are photos shared in a
private eCirele subject to the libel laws? experts say they
absolutely are not.) How did Curly contact a lawyer? And if Curly
wins the case, will Chaffin shave the pooch and abandon him in
the woods?
Interestingly, Ishibashi is best known for defending a Siamese
Cat named Dr. Chang against charges that he scratched the
bejesus out of his owner's rare Monet. The cat was cleared of all
charges, but was later th.it day killed in a waffle iron accident
