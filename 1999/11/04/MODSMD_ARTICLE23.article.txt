recorded by the local acoustic
band Roses Galore, and it's enti
tled "A Dozen for My Sweet lx)ve."
"You're paying for my ruined
keyboard," eCircler Dan Kaplan
wrote Richards. "If that was a joke,
it wasn't funny." 'Hie three other
eCirclers also were not amused,
and are demanding similar com
pensation for their damaged com
puters, as well as for any damage
to their traumatized stomachs.
While Richards expressed sur
prise over his friends' reaction to
hearing the "Roses Galore" Ml':i,
local music afficionados did not.
"Those guys blow," said Han Vu, a
well-respected Columbus music
critic. "Richards is lucky his bud

rooms headfirst into the concrete
the moment they heard that stuff"
In a barely related story, the
Wiersema family of Chicago used
