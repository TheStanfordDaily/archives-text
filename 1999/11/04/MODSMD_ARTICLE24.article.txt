# Students displeased with cable policies
## 
### Virginia Yang Contributing writer 
Recently, about 15 graduate stu
dents in Crothers Hall signed a peti
tion complaining about the lack of
cable television in their lounge. Many
undergraduates also voiced concern
about the high cost and limited choic
es of Stanford's cable service.
Currently, the Stanford Televi
sion Network charges a flat rate of
$23.50 per month for each in-room
cable connection and does not allow
cable in residence lounges.
This one-tier system causes stu
dents to pay a flat rate, which in
cludes subscription to cable networks
such as MTV and ESPN, even if they
just want network stations.
Some students have purchased
antennas to receive basic networks
such as NBC, FOX and the WB to
get their weekly doses of "Dawson's
Creek." "Friends" and the news.
Sophomore Scott Silvergate, a
current STV subscriber, said he is
frustrated with the current system.
"1 don't understand why the cable
rate is so expensive," he said. "It is in
convenient for us to get an outside
service such as [satellite service] Di
recTV. and since [STV has| a mo
nopoly on cable, they can charge high
prices, and we can't do anything
about it."
Maureen Thimm, assistant direc
tor for Communication and Network
Services, defended the S I V rates.
She pointed out that Cable Co-Op,
the cable service provider for Palo
Alto, Menlo Park and East Palo
Alto, also has one flat fee, charging
$34.95 per month.
"I"he cost of cable service covers
the fees to the programmers and re
covers the cost of the cable system
that goes out to the dorm." she said.
Thimm defended the one-tier sys
tem. "Six years ago, when we first
started to provide cable service to
students, we did a survev of students,

and the most requested channels
were MTV and ESPN. In order to
provide students what they wanted at
a reasonable cost, we had to institute
the one-tier system."
Before STV was created, students
could not receive cable service. The
University approached Cable Co-
Op, which said it would provide the
dorms with cable service only if the
University guaranteed 1(X)% sub
scribership at Cable Co-Op's current
rate and covered the cost of neces
sary wiring.
Many students, including the
Crothers Hall group that filed the
complaint, say they would prefer to
have cable service in their residence
lounge.
"I would love cable in the lounge
because then the dorm can share the
weighty expense of cable television,
and I could watch the one or two
channels 1 watch without paying for
the full cost," said sophomore Annie
Chan.
But Thimm said lounge subscrip
tions would mean a financial loss for
STV. "If people could get cable in
their lounges, then they [would) be
less likely to subscribe in the room."
she said. "There are 1(X) lounges
across campus, and this is the best
service profile that could recover
cost."
According to Thimm, STV needs
a 50-percent subscriber rate in order
to recover all costs and hopes to
reach that rate in the first five years of
service. Currently, projected sub
scribership for the year is 45 percent.
Tv Clevenger, a law student in
Crothers Hall. said. "[STV is] pres
suring the students to get cable in
their rooms, and that's wrong."
Currently. Thimm said, there is
one way for the dorm lounge to get
cable service. A special plan from
STV allows the dorm to subscribe all
residents at a 25 percent discount and
receive free cable service for the
lounge.
