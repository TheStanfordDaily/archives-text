# Blood Center addresses student concerns

In response to student concerns that Stanford
blood drives discriminate against homosexual
males, the Stanford Blood Center will now make
a question-and-answer sheet available at all
blood donation sites.
Susan Galel. associate medical director of the
Stanford Blood Center, said the Center does not
write the controversial questions which discour
age sexually active gay men from donating blood.
Questions are dictated by the FDA and are based
on the policy of the Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta. "We ask a lot of questions of donors,
not just about HIV and homosexuality," she said.
The CDC considers male-to-male sex a "risky
behavior" that increases the risk of acquiring
HIV, even when condoms are used. The new
handout addresses students' question of: "Why
are gay males prohibited from donating blood,
even if they practice 'safe sex?' "

All donated blood is tested for HI V, but Galel
said the CDC continues to discourage donation
by gay males because "the appearance of HIV
does not always show in initial tests, and ques
tioning eliminates more than 9() percent of infec
tious donors."
Restrictions appearing on the pamphlet in
clude: "Do not donate blood if you: Are a male
who has had sexual contact with another male,
even once, since 1977" or "were born in, or lived
in since 1977, any of the following [African]
countries."
The handout stresses that questioning donors'
sexual activity is the only way to identify recent
exposure to HIV, since blood does not test posi
tive immediately after infection.
The questionnaire for blood donors also asks
about other "high-risk behavior." The CDC pro
hibits people who use IV drugs and people who
have had sex with IV drug-users from donating
blood.

In a recent Daily article, freshman Lyndon
Gill expressed displeasure at the Blood Center's
policies
"Stanford Medical Center ought not to be al
lowed to hide behind generally accepted proce
dure and protocol," he said. "Just following or
ders is not an excuse for this kind of obviously ho
mophobic procedure. [Stanford is] simply perpet
uating stereotypes and prejudices."
In response, the Blood Center has provided
contact information for students who find this
protocol unreasonable.
Galel said the policies of the Blood Center will
not change, but she encourages students to look
further into the issue if their questions remain
unanswered.
Students can contact Vincent Yalon, the ad
ministrator of the Stanford Medical School
Blood Center, at 723-7994, the Center for Biolog
ies Evaluation Research or the FDA at its branch
in Rockville, MD.
