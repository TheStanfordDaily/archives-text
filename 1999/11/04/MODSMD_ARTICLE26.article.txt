# Grad Council talks health care, funding
## 
### Valentine Ding Contributing writer 
At its weekly meeting last night,
the Graduate Student Council dis
cussed several issues, including
funding policy, health insurance and
housing.
Since the split of the GSC and the
Undergraduate Senate, the funding
of on-campus groups is experienc
ing managerial changes as well.
Traditionally, student groups
were financially supported bv a gen
eral fee accrued by the ASSU. After
the breakup, the GSC and the US
are each given a general fee to fund
their own groups. But for groups
whose members include both gradu
ates and undergraduates, the fund
ing is still managed by both the GSC

and the US.
The GSC and the US are now
working together on a policy con
cerning the funding for groups that
have mixed membership. The draft
that passed last night at the GSC
meeting emphasized the objective
that in the long run. these groups
will be funded separately.
"The [joint US / GSC funding]
policy will work for the time being,"
said David Robinson, a fourth-year
chemistry doctoral student. "How
ever, in the future we hope groups
with combined population will
apply to both committees for fund
ing so that undergraduate groups
will be encouraged to recruit gradu
ate students."
Another issue the members dis
cussed was health insurance. Cur-

rently, students who have depen
dents have to put their spouse and
children on a separate insurance
plan, the result of which is an exor
bitant premium.
The University is making a new
contract with outside insurance
providers to create an alternative
plan. The GSC is advocating the re
lief of financial burdens caused by
multiple plans.
"It is a long-term priority for the
GSC to address the affordability of
the dependent health care and child
care for the graduate students," said
Paul Hartke, a third-year electrical
engineering doctoral student.
Housing is another long-term
priority for the GSC members. On
Nov. 15 the University is scheduled
to submit the actual version of its

Land Use Plan to Santa Clara Coun
ty. The county will then consider
whether to grant the new General
Use Permit, which directly affects
the proposal of building 1,900 on
campus units for graduate student
housing.
The Graduate Housing Advisory
Committee has been lobbying for
the assurance of 1,000 units in the
first three years of the new GUP.
"Given the intense economic
pressure the current housing market
creates for grad students, we hope
that the University will commit to
building these new units," said
Hunter Tart, a fourth-year mathe
matics doctoral student. "While this
measure will not fully meet the de
mand for housing, it would be a big
step in the right direction."
