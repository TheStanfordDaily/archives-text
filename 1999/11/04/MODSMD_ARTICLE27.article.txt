■ Tuesday: No. 17 Stanford (11-3-2)
1, No. 9 Santa Clara (12-3-1) 0

"1 wanted it to come my way,"
Nelsen said of Davis' cornerkick,
"and it came straight on the dime.
When the service is right, it doesn't
take much to finish it."
The No. 17 Cardinal (11-3-2)
seems to thrive on intense, close
matches. The team has secured six
wins this season by a one-goal mar
gin, including two overtime victo
ries. On Tuesday night, the men
waited until four minutes into the
second overtime before shutting
down the Broncos.
The game was a constant back
and-forth battle all the way to the
finish, keeping the players on their
toes and the fans on the edges of
their seats. Both teams notched 13
shots, making it a busy night in the
net. Stanford senior goalkeeper
Adam Zapala recorded four saves
while Santa Clara's sophomore
keeper Rusty Johnson finished
with a career-high six saves.
Perhaps the most tense moment
for the Cardinal came 12 minutes

into overtime, when Bronco senior
defender Eric Denton blew a
chance to end it for his team. On a
controversial call. Santa Clara was
awarded a penalty kick. Denton
shot the ball low and to the right,
but it skirted just wide.
1 he shot was just one of many
missed chances on the night. Both
teams suffered from similar un
lucky opportunities. During regu
lation, a Bronco charge got past
Zapala, only to be thwarted by se
nior defender Andy Hemmerich
on the goal line. In retribution, on
the Santa Clara goal line, a Bronco
defender cleared away a threaten
ing shot by Stanford's junior for
ward Scott Leber.
In overtime, a chip shot by
Santa Clara's leading scorer,
sophomore forward Anthony
Chimienti, almost put the game to
rest, but the shot skimmed over the
crossbar, as did a promising chip by
Stanford freshman forward Roger
Levesque.
Fueling the Cardinal offensive
charge was a consistently strong
backfield. The defense of Davis,
Hemmerich, sophomore Lee Mor
rison and redshirt junior Chirs
Gores was a solid combination, a
virtually impenetrable force that
helped Zapala clinch his eighth
shutout of the season.
"Everybody fought hard," head
coach Bobby Clark said. "But Lee
Morrison and Chris Gores were
absolutely superb. They won every
ball in the air and never lost their
discipline."
"Chris and Lee were so domi
nant," Nelsen agreed, "they were
very secure and definitely had their
best games of the year."
The defenders, whose efforts
are not always reflected in the scor
ing statistics, kept the Cardinal
alive despite the fact that it could
not seem to get control of the game,
turning over the ball more than

often and forced to share the spot
light with Santa Clara.
"We couldn't get hold of the ball
and keep position," Nelsen said,
"so we couldn't get zones set or get
organized. We weren't dictating
the game."
"It wasn't always the prettiest
game, but playing Santa Clara
away — it's always going to be a
hard, closely fought game" Clark
said. "To come [to Santa Clara's
field] and win is a tremendous re
sult.

Alter a six-week absence from
Soccer America's national rank
ings, Stanford lias moved to 17th. a
good place to be as the team, cur
rently second in conference play
(5-1-1). looks to receive an NCAA
tournament bid.
"In the last three games, we
have come of age and we are ready
now." Clark said. "If we can play
with the same discipline and atten
tion we should do well this week
end and hopefully make it t<> the
tournament."
