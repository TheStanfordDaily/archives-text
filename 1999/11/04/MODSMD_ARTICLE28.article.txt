## 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
After dispatching an older,
slower Marathon Oil team with
ease Sunday afternoon, Stanford
continues its abbreviated presea
son against Athletes in Action
tonight at Maples Pavilion.

■ Tonight: Stanford vs. Atheletes in
Action, 7:30 p.m., Maples Pavilion

With only a week until the Car
dinal opens the season in a highly
anticipated matchup with the
Duke Blue Devils, Stanford will
face a traveling squad on a mission.
Athletes in Action (AIA) is a club
team made up of former college
players, most of whom have spent
time in the NBA and / or in foreign
pro leagues, who try to spread
Christianity while spreading the
floor.
"With so little time to get ready
for our first game, we kind of pur
posefully sought out the two
longest-standing club teams
(Marathon Oil and AIA) to play
us," said Stanford assistant coach
Blaine Taylor. "[AIA] beat us two
years ago, so we know they can
play."
While AIA does not feature
any prominent names, some play
ers do stand out. Guard Craig
Brown played for Florida in 1994,
when the Gators made a surprise
trip to the Final Four, and earned
MVP honors in the East Regional.
Damion Dantzler, a 6-foot, 7-inch
forward who graduated from
Louisville in 1998, started for the
Cardinals when they reached the
NCAA tournament.
However, Stanford will not like

ly be in awe of AlA's talent. The
Cardinal has enough of that, espe
cially in the frontcourt.
Sunday saw the premiere of
what looks to be a dominating
three-man rotation of senior Mark
Madsen and the Collins twins, ju
nior Jarron and redshirt freshman
Jason. The trio posted 50 points
and brought down 31 rebounds
while making Marathon's post de
fenders look silly.
The only question is which
freshmen post players will join the
crowd. Four freshmen — center
Curtis Borchardt and forwards
Tyler Besecker, Justin Davis and
Joe Kirchofer — sat out Sunday,
but head coach Mike Montgomery
said at least one will see time
tonight. Besecker and at least one
other player will probably stay on
the bench for this game and the rest
of the year as redshirts.
While the frontcourt seems
solid, point guard certainly is not.
And with junior Mike McDonald
again suffering through injuries, it
may never be.
McDonald, who missed signifi
cant time last season, played only
12 minutes Sunday while trying to
overcome an ankle sprain he suf
fered last Thursday. Though
sophomore Tony Giovacchini and
freshman Julius Barnes looked
good filling in for him, McDonald
wants to be back in the mix.
"It really feels like "been there,
done that." " he said, referring to
his past foot problems. "Point
guard's a big position for us this
year. It's important that I get back
to normal."
For now, though, Stanford will
get to see how Giovacchini and


Theo Alkousakis — Daily file
Junior guard Mike McDonald, the Cardinal's starting point guard, is
suffering lingering complications from an ankle sprain.
Barnes handle the extra time. As
McDonald acknowledged, the Car
dinal needs all three to play well if
it is going to be successful.
"Having three point guards
gives us a lot of leeway, especially
because Tony can play [shooting
guard], too," he said. But, "at some
point, all three of us will have to
step up for [the team] to do well."

Stanford's future success will
also rely on its depth on the wings,
especially freshman forward Casey
Jacobsen.
But Jacobsen. looking like he
was pressing a lot in his first colle
giate experience, hit only 1 of 8
shots for three points and one re
bound Sunday. He said the self
pressure of playing in his first game
at Stanford proved too much for
him.
"I put a lot of pressure on myself
and I played tight," he said. "I

know how to play better than that.
1 expect to play well every night 1
go out there. I'm just glad we've got
another game so soon."
While he admitted he has
thought a lot about his perfor
mance since Sunday, Jacobsen said
he is not worried about tonight's
game.
"I've had [other people's] ex
pectations to deal with since 1 was a
little kid. I'm just going to try to
relax, play for myself and have
fun."
