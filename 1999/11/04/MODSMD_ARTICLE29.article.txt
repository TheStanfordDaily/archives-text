### Ashley Rich Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's field
hockey team (8-8,4-1 Northern Pa
cific Conference) is ready for a re
natch. And the players have their
sights set on the blue-and-gold clad
stjuad from across the Bay.
If things go as planned, the No. 2-
se.'ded Cardinal will have the
chance take on the No. 1-seeded
California Bears (10-4, 5-0) for the

NorPac title on Sunday. Stanford
has already competed against Cal
twice, but this time the stakes are
higher — it's more than a matter of
pride, it's a matter of moving on to
the NCAA tournament.

The tournament starts Friday,
bringing in teams from as far away
as Missouri to compete on Stan
ford's Varsity Astro Turf Field for
three days of intense competition.
Stanford and Cal have a bye until
Saturday, when the Cardinal plays
the winner of the first-round match
between the third and sixth seeds.
Stanford has handily defeated
both potential opponents already
this season, downing the University
of the Pacific 5-0 and 2-1 and Davis
& Elkins 8-0. Although it's tempt
ing to look ahead to the final round,
Saturday's match can't be taken
lightly.
"We're just concentrating on one
game at a time," said junior
Michelle Scott. "We won't know
who we play until Friday, so we've
been working on the basics of the
game — stick skills and condition
ing."
Looking ahead to Sunday, the
Cardinal can expect a tough match.
Stanford and Cal have already met
twice this season. The games have
been close and intense, but Cal has
