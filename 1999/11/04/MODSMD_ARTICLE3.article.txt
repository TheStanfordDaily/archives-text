# ISC, IFC open dialogue with administration
## Greek Leadership Circle meets 
### Kristin Rose 
The newly-created Greek Lead
ership Circle met for the first time
last night with Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education James Mon
toya at the Delta Delta Delta soror
ity house.
According to Inter-Sorority
Council President Stephanie Blos
som, a senior, "The major goal of
the Greek Leadership Circle is to in
crease participation in discussion
between Greek chapters and the
Stanford administration."
Circle leaders plan to identify
and discuss issues and then work

with the Greek community and the
Stanford administration to resolve
them.
Ten representatives from the
Inter-Fraternity Council and the
ISC attended the first meeting, and
began by addressing Greek con
cerns.
Senior Tim Fisher, IFC presi
dent. asked. "What is the Universi
ty's vision of the Greek system for
the future?"
Montoya said he believes that
"Greek life is a great opportunity to
provide leadership to make a differ
ence in the Stanford community."
Me cited the Greeks' countless

hours of community service this au
tumn as an example of leadership
and service. This "meaningful ac
tion helps Stanford to become a bet
ter place," he said.
Senior Joseph Henry, IFC rush
chair, discussed the idea of the
Greek community and the adminis
tration "working together to give
the Greeks a more positive image"
and to help break down stereotypes
surrounding fraternities and sorori
ties.
The Greek Leadership Circle
hopes to convey that Greek life can
promote personal growth. Tara
Hale, president of the Pi Beta Phi
sorority, said that some of her most
important memories are of her
sorority friends.
She said she wants to find some
way to convey "how different frater
nities and sororities are here at Stan
ford" from common perceptions
due to the diversity, friendships and
community in Stanford Greek life.
In response, Montoya said that
he wants "Greeks on campus to
feel that the University embraces
them and is working hard to sup
port them."
Montoya also addressed the
issue of alcohol use in sororities
and fraternities, saying that in fu
ture Circle meetings, he hopes to
establish an open dialogue about
drinking.
He said he perceives that the
pressure for creating a social scene
currently falls chiefly on the Greek
system, and that his future vision
"includes a social scene on campus
that includes Greek and non-Greek
houses."
He said that the University
hopes to offer guidance, but the
Greek community must continue
with its leadership in community
service and education about the
Greek system.
Fisher said he hopes the "Greek
Leadership Circle will open a con
structive dialogue between the
University and the Greek system,
so that we can express issues from
both sides of the table."
