# Seniors captain Cardinal squad
## 
### Lori Maund Contributing writer 
With two more wins this week
end against Washington and Wash
ington State, the Stanford women's
soccer learn is guaranteed the Pacif
ic 10 Conference title and an auto
matic berth in the NCAA Tourna
ment in San Jose. This year's team
boasts the most impressive record in
the last four years of Cardinal soc
cer.
The marked success of the
women's soccer program this sea
son is largely due to the leadership

of its senior co-captains Jennifer
O'Sullivan and Shauna Itri. O'Sulli
van and Itri have proven their com
petence in this position by leading
the Cardinal squad to the top of the
Pac-10 and to a No. 7 national rank
ing.
"One of the keys for us this year
has been our leadership," head
coach Steve Swanson said. "That in
cludes all of our seniors, but partic
ularly Jenno and Shauna because
they are our captains. They've done
a good job of making sure we're
working hard in practice, we're
ready for games, and that we con

duct ourselves on road trips."
Their contribution to the team
has been not only in terms of their
leadership skills, but also in the im
pact they have both made on the
field.
Itri anchors the team as a center
midfielder with fellow senior Ron
nie Fair. The center midficld posi
tion is pivotal in controlling the
speed and direction of the game. It
is often considered one of the most
important positions on the field be
cause it is situated between the for
ward and defensive lines and pos
sesses the ball for a considerable
amount of game time.
O'Sullivan contributes to the suc
cess of the team through her solid
defensive skills. As a four-year
starter, O'Sullivan has crippled
some of the most threatening for
wards in .collegiate soccer. Her
speed and persistence have been
crucial factors in her success on the
field.
The dynamics of this duo. howev
er, run much deeper than their Stan
ford experiences.
Although O'Sullivan grew up

along the Florida coast and Itri hails
from the Huntington Beach area*
the two first met each other at a
training camp for the Under-16
Youth National Team during their
junior year in high school.
"She was playing forward, and 1
was marking her," O'Sullivan said.
"1 remember that she was a really
good player. Looking back then, it is
hard to believe we would be at Stan
ford together."
During high school, O'Sullivan
and Itri participated in the Olympic
Development Program that identi
ties and develops the elite youth soc
cer players across the nation.
Itri was a member of the Califor
nia State team and the West Region
al teams for a number of years, as well

as the Under-16 National Team.
O'Sullivan played for the Florida
State team, the South regional team
and the Under-16, Under-17, and
Under-20 National Teams.
"It was a huge commitment, but it
was well worth it," Itri said. "It really
made you a better player because it
forced you to play at a higher level."
Their commitment to the sport in
college — a time commitment that
dominates a huge portion of their
time every week — is also a testa
ment to their love for the game. But
it, at least for O'Sullivan, was not al
ways this way.
"I remember when 1 was five, my
dad had to make me play." O'Sulli
van said. "I didn't want to. I hated
wearing the shinguards . . . but,
after a while, I didn't need a lot of
convincing."
When O'Sullivan played with her
first club team in the fifth grade, she
was the only girl on it. She competed
on the team until her freshman year
in high school.
"I liked playing with the boys,"
O'Sullivan said. "They were better
and more competitive than the
girls. One of them was my
boyfriend for a while, until he frac
tured my ankle."
O'Sullivan moved to a girl's club
team. Town and Country, at the be
ginning of high school. Her team
won the national championship her
junior year.
Itri's illustrious career also start
ed at the age of five. Her club team.
Fountain Valley Spirit, also won the
national championship her junior
year in high school.
The women have excelled both
on the field and in the classroom at
Stanford. O'Sullivan is majoring in
International Relations, and Itri
majors in Human Biology with a
minor in psychology.
The reasons these women have
made such a significant impact on
the soccer program at Stanford —
and the reasons for their assured
success in their future endeavors —
is in the strength of their characters.
"For me, as good as they are on
the field, they are even better off it,"
Swanson said. "They are hard work
ers and tremendous representatives
of the program. They are going to be
successful in whatever they do be
cause of who they are."

Senior co-captains Shauna Itri and Jennifer O'Sullivan anchor the
No. 7 Cardinal women's soccer team. They both started playing soc
cer at age 5 — and their similiar histories on high school club teams
have led both to the Farm.
