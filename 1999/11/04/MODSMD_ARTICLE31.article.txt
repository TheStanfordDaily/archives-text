## Heifferon keys top polo squad 
### Erin Bouchier Staff writer 
Senior Brian Heifferon traveled the typical road to
playing water polo. Like many players, he was intro
duced to the game by a high school coach who noticed
his swimming talent.
But Heifferon is anything hut a typical player. Stan
ford coach Dante Dettamanti describes him as "one of
the best players in the history of Stanford water polo."
Arguably the top collegiate player in the nation,
Heifferon has earned numerous indivdual accolades,
from recognition as an Ail-American three years in a
row to 1998 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tour
nament MVP to three-time team captain to a spot on
the Academic All-America team.
However, for Heifferon. these personal awards pale

in comparison to the importance of the team.
" The [Stanford] team is kind'of like a family," he
said. "We trust each other. There's mutual respect for
everyone, from the starters to the backups. They are the
nicest group of guys I've ever played with. And it's just
so much fun playing with them."
Heifferon starting playing on his first team his sopho
more year at Servite High School in Fullerton, Calif. A
talented swimmer who had been training with a club
team since age 12, Heifferon was recruited by the
school's water polo coach, Jim Sprague.
Each year the Servite team improved, making it to
the California Interscholastic Federation Champi
onship in 1 leifferon's senior year. Yet despite their suc
cess, the members of the team "weren't verv tight-knot
because everyone lived so far away
from each other."
When Heifferon arrived at Stan
ford, he found "a world of differ
ence. The team was so much fun. It
is such a good feeling when you can
look forward to practice because
you get to see your friends."
Redshirting in 1995, Heifferon
had the chance to learn from older
players, particularly All-Amcrican
Brian Wallin, who taught him all the
fine points of the game. At the same
time, he was able to observe what
kind of dynamics helped and hurt
the success of the team.
Heifferon became an important
contributor to the team the next
year, starting and scoring 24 points,
which put him fourth on the Cardi
nal squad. He followed that up in
1997 with 36 points, the most on the
team. In the summers, he gained
valuable international experience,
playing with the Junior National
Team in the Pan Am games and the
World Championships.
"Both experiences really opened
my eyes to how much better the in
ternational competition is than col
lege," he said. "It was amazing to see
the caliber of talent there. And it
taught me a lot about water polo."
Heifferon was able to bring back
those lessons for the 1998 season.
The team made it to the NCAA fi
nals, losing to USC in overtime. On
the way, Heifferon scored 43 points
and garnered MPSF and NCAA
first-team All-Tournament honors.
While successful, Heifferon felt that
"this team didn't always play to its
potential. Not everyone was on the
same page."
Things are different this season.
"Maybe we don't have as much
raw talent, but we're a really cohe
sive group," Heifferon said. "There
isn't a single selfish individual on
this team. There's really a feeling of
pride when a teammate does well.
Everyone has the same goal: to have
fun and win."
Heifferon is playing a large role
in leading the team to that goal. Det
tamanti describes him as "the best
all-around player. He has all the
skills and has no weaknesses."
Heifferon leads the team in scor
ing, and Dettamanti also considers
him the best defender, the best
counterattack man, the best stealer
and the faster player on the team
with the most endurance.

"The only thing he doesn't do is
play in the goal," Dettamanti said.
But while his individual skHls are
invaluable, Heifferon may be con
tributing even more to the team by
sharing his experience and knowl
edge.
"He has a great understanding of
the game and he willingly, more
willingly than anyone, passes that on
to his teammates," Dettamanti said.
Heifferon really appreciates his
role as leader, mentor and teacher,
saying, "I feel really proud when our
team wins and does well because I
feel like I've had a hand in helping
them."
Ranked No. 1, the team should
give Heifferon a few more things to
be proud about in the last month of
competition.
And what about after this sea

son? Having trained with the U.S.
National Team for the past three
years, Heifferon is certainly a candi
date for the 2(XX) and 2004 Olympic
teams. However, he's not sure if
he'll continue playing. Heifferon is
considering law school and is plan
ning on taking the LSAT in the
spring.
In the meantime. I leifferon plans
to enjoy surfing "as much as my
schedule allows," snowboarding,
watching reruns of Beverly Hills,
90210 with his roommate, hanging
out with friends and reading.
Heifferon has really enjoyed his
time at Stanford.
"Academically you meet incredi
ble people who amaze you every
day." he said. "Socially, 1 really feel
fortunate for finding a great group of
friends who will be friends for life.*'
