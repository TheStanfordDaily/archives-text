Chief of Police
Marvin Herring
ton has played a
crucial role in law
enforcement dur
ing high-profile
occasions as di
verse as world
class sporting
events and the

visits of foreign dignitaries.
"I enjoy the people and chal
lenges." Herrington said of his cur
rent position. He described Stanford
as "a premier institution — This
place is where it's happening... [but
.is ;i result] we face lots of extra chal
lenges."
I lerrington said his most memo
rable experiences as Chief of Police
are special events. I le specifically re
called 1994's World Cup Soccer and
the IMS 4 Summer Olympics. Stan
lord hosted several soccer games
during each ol these competitions.
I lerrington also distinctly remem
bers Mikhail Gorbachev's visit on
June 4, I WO — the last time Gor
bachev visited as president of the So

viet Union.
Maintaining security during the
visit, Herrington said, was a collabo
rative effort of the Secret Service, the
KGB and the Stanford Police. Her
rington recalled Gorbachev "walk
ing along a rope line and greeting
thousands of people," which present
ed a major security concern.
Herrington said the most trying
times of his career came during his
first few years on the job. When he
began working at Stanford at the end
of the Vietnam War era, Herrington
and his department dealt with nu
merous student demonstrations.
Violence and arson were com
mon, and protesters burned police
cars during that time. Herrington
said that the police department's
biggest priority in the early 1970s be
came "[keeping] the institution
going."
Herrington also said he enjoys
giving talks to classes. "I remember
going to a class and talking about
guns and firearms in the United
States," he said.
Originally from the Midwest,
Herrington began his career on the
West Coast at UC-Berkeley. A grad
uate of Cal State-Sacramento, Her
rington earned his master's in public

administration at the University of
Southern California.
Herrington has held his current
position since 1971. His main duty is
to oversee the police department.
"Our department has a broader
function than most cities," he said.
"Since the University owns most of
the property... [we are responsible]
for the security of buildings [as
well]."
Married and the father of four
grown daughters, Herrington enjoys
spending time with his four grand
children.
Herrington said that he does most
of the maintenance on his home,
"mostly for the therapy."
"I enjoy working with my hands,"
he said. "It's relaxing... a break from
what I do for a living."
Herrington emphasized the im
portance of cooperation from the
community: "We depend on the help
of the public ... [both in] preventing
crime and cooperating with us [in in
vestigating it.]"
"This place is a... beautiful place,
... idyllic-looking, ... but [students
and faculty must be] aware that we
have crimes here, too. I would hope
people would take a little bit of extra
time to be cautious."
