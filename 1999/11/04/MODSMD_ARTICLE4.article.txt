A Stanford Law School graduate is spending his
nights pinning down guests in a "Full Nelson" â€” and
he's doing it on national television.
Roh Nelson, class of 1998, hosts "The Full Nelson,"
a new late- night talk show on the Fox News Channel
focused on culture and politics.
"The purpose of 'The Full Nelson 1 is to discuss an
array of issues that the American people are truly in
terested in hut are afraid to talk about," Nelson said.
Nelson invites guest experts to join him in debate
during his hour-long show, which airs Saturday nights
at 11:00 p.m.
Topics have ranged from political issues to Ameri
can pop culture, with debates on prostitution, the le
galization of drugs, gay reformation and America's ob
session with beauty and body image.
In an interview with Entertainment Weekly maga
zine, Nelson said, "I might do a show on why we really
don't give a damn about Kosovo, and why do we pre
tend to?" Such views define the edge that Nelson said
he hopes to create in his show.
The show has received widespread praise in nation
al media outlets, including The New York Times, the
Los Angeles Times and the Hollywood Reporter.
The New York Times called it "a cross between Bill
Maher's Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher' and an
old-fashioned talk show like Donahue.' "
Nelson's Oct. 2 show, which focused on cultural
conceptions of beauty, featured Nikie St. Gilles, the
1999 Penthouse Pet. Aaron Hicklin. the senior editor
of Gear magazine. Nancy Etcoff, author of "Survival

show also included women who.have undergone plas

After a heated debate between the guests, Nelson
opened the floor to his audience.
Nelson said that such discourse is cxactly what he
wants. "I want a show that will squeeze the truth out of
real-life issues," he said.
Nelson, now 34, joined the Fox News Channel as a
political commentator last January. Before that. Nel
son helped found the political activist group Lead or
Leave, which protested Congressional cuts in Social
Security programs.
Nelson described his show as "a no-holds barred
discussion ripping apart issues that directly interest
American society." He likened it to a "late-night Jerry
Springer, minus the white trash."
Nelson got the idea for his show while attending
Stanford Law School. He said he wanted to target the
25- to 40-year-old demographic with "smart adult
talk" in a late-night show. "I don't think daytime TV
talk is adult," he said.
Nelson proposed the idea to members of the Fox
News Channel and received an enthusiastic response.
The show has been on the air for more than two
months.
Nelson also has a book which is due for release in
February of 2000.
