## An ‘Insider' look at the tobacco industry 
### 
£ r V Ihe Insider" is the gripping story of Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe),
an executive at a large tobacco company, and Lowell Bergman (Al
X Facino), a producer at the CBS show "60 Minutes."
When Bergman and "60 Minutes" anchorman Mike Wallace (Christopher
Flummer) become involved with Wigand, they all get in over their heads.
While Wallace and Bergman have successfully interviewed and exposed the
world's most dangerous terrorists, unveiling the truth about the tobacco in
dustry may be more hazardous than they could ever imagine.

Wigand is willing to talk on "60 Minutes"
about the tobacco industry's tactics to get as
many people addicted to nicotine as possible.
Wigand's reason for his break from industry is
that he has become disgruntled with his for
mer employer, Brown & Williamson. While
they swayed him to work for them with a lot of
money, they couldn't buy his soul.
Wigand's real passion as a scientist is to
save people's lives. When he is assigned the

task of making the nicotine in cigarettes more potent, he revolts against the
company and gets himself fired. When he gets threatened into signing a com
plete non-disclosure agreement, he decides to blow the whistle, and he be-

comes the ultimate insider.
Bergman, as the producer of the Wigand segment, is determined to treat his inter
viewee as he always does. He will give Wigand a forum to tell the truth, and hopefully
this will allow him to start rebuilding the life that is crumbling around him. When the
segment with the interview gets shelved before it is aired, Bergman experiences some
what of a mid-life crisis. If he can't get the network to air the segment, both his career
and Wigand's life are in serious jeopardy.
While the movie is based on a true story, executives at CBS feel too much artistic li
cense has been taken about why the Wigand segment is canned at first and aired at a
later date. It is no wonder that CBS feels uncomfortable about " The Insider." After all,
the movie portrays their highly regarded news department as the puppet of a bunch of
corporate lawyers who act in the interest of the shareholders instead of the American
public.
Pacino's most memorable line in the movie, "The more truth he tells, the worse it

gets," may not make sense, but it is the essence of a movie about journalistic responsi
bility. In a capitalist society, the media may be considered independent, but the movie
indicates that in reality they always belong to the one with the most money. In the end
this story may be 100 percent true, but airing it could lead to the demise of the network.
While "The Insider" is pretty long at 157 minutes, it only feels slow occasionally. The
terrific performances by Pacino and Plummer are the main reason why this film is
worth seeing. The story is interesting, but being based on the true events that led to the
$246-billion settlement between 49 states and the tobacco industry, it is rather pre
dictable at times.
Still, its focus is narrow enough to show an aspect of the case that most people are
not familiar with, making this into a great, smart film.
