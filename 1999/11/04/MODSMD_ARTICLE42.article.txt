# This smart 'Limey' doesn't sell you any lemons

Steven Soderbergh's newest, "The
Limey," is trying to be of a rare
breed — the intelligent action Hick.
From the opening shot to the closing
flashback, " The Limey" did manage to
surprise me without the use of "clever"
plot twists. The plot is simple: David Wil
son (Terence Stamp) is the limey looking

for Terry Valentine (Peter Fonda) to find
out who is responsible for his daughter's
untimely death. It's an oft-told story, hut
Soderbergh, of "Sex, Lies and Video
tape" and "Out of Sight" fame, manages
to put a little bit of meat and introspection
into this tale of revenge.
Unlike most studio-produced action
flicks, "The Limey" doesn't fall in love
with loud music. The soundtrack is sur
prisingly restrained, even with the gratu
itous '60s hits added to sell copies.
Or maybe it is just Soderbergh's use of
sound that is restrained. To underscore

some crucial scenes he utilizes silence,
surprising today's sound-cut generation,
which is raised to believe that gunshots
and kissing are always accompanied by
the appropriate song. The director's use
of mellow wind chimes as a sound device
also works well in a couple of reflective
scenes presenting the ex-con Wilson's re

lationship with his daughter.
Soderburgh tones down the use of vio
lence as well. There is a car chase as well
as some fighting, shooting and casualties.
"The Limey" needs its action, of course.
But it is in no way a shoot-'em-up, as the
body count is well below 10, including
four off-screen deaths.

The directing isn't all good, though.
The sense of time and forward progres
sion in the plot is sent awry by the con
stant oscillating between flashbacks and
flash-forwards. The overuse of the two
time devices is a major flaw, as the action
becomes disorienting at crucial moments
in the plot development. And even
though it may be all right to see certain
scenes twice, it isn't really cool to feel like
you've seen a 45-minute movie twice.
The cast does well despite the interest
ing cutting, as the actors turn in compe
tent performances across the board.
Stamp's performance is well above com
petency; without his stolid stares and de
termined, defiant way, "The Limey" has
no anchor. It is David's story and there
fore Stamp's movie. Although Stamp and
Fonda, a pair of revived old-school actors,
are the marquee names, Luis Guzman's
performance as the concerned Eduardo
Roel deserves credit as well.
In the end, I would recommend seeing
"The Limey." You won't be mad you did.
As a character piece, it definitely has its
successes, and as an action piece, it's just
different enough to be interesting.
