Poor Craig Schwartz (John Cusack).
He lives in a run-down apartment
with a depressive chimpanzee and
his wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz, who has
never looked worse in a feature film).
Although he is a brilliant puppeteer,
he is stuck in a mindless job alphabetizing

(Orson Bean) and a sexy co-worker
named Maxine (Catherine Keener) who

he's discovered a secret passage into John

What?
That is the overwhelming reaction you
may have to "Being John Malkovich,"
the debut film from director Spike Jonze.
Jonze is an acclaimed music video direc
tor, and his film has the jarring, fast-paced
plot development of a Beastie Boys
video.
If nothing else, "Being John
Malkovich" is wildly original and some
times hysterically funny.

For an offbeat pro

Malkovich plays himself
and does a brilliant job
as he discovers that peo
ple are somehow taking
over his head and expe
riencing the world
through his eyes.
Though darkly

comic, the film touches
on the serious issue of fame. When Craig
and Maxine decide to sell visits to John
Malkovich's head, hundreds of people
line up for the chance to be thin and fa

greatest actors, although nobody who
meets John Malkovich is quite sure what
movies he has been in.
Jonze (who also wrote the script) ex
plores the endless possibilities of borrow
ing another person's body. Just think of
the erotic entanglements that could result
from uSing John Malkovich as a life-size
sex toy.
And what if John Malkovich travels
into his own head? The storyline ex

how comes together with a surprisingly

clean ending.
Still, "Being John Malkovich" often
feels raw. In many of the indoor shots,
boom microphones are clearly visible
above the actors' heads, as if the director
deliberately chooses to appear low-bud
get. The plot moves quickly, abruptly
skipping over several years, and the result
feels inconsistent.
"Being John Malkovich" is excellent,
but it is not on the level of a genuinely ab
surd masterpiece such as Terry Gilliam's
"Brazil." Imagine a cross between Franz
Kafka and MTV, and you might have an
idea about what "Being John Malkovich"
has in store for you.
