£ r ■ ihe Straight Story" is a medita
tion on life and aging, directed
.A. by David Lynch ("Blue Velvet,"
"Twin Peaks") and produced by Disney.
Some folks in the audience snickered at
the juxtaposition of those names on the
screen, and they continued to giggle at the
cast of quirky heartland dwellers who in
habit the slow-turning world of Alvin
Straight.
"The Straight Story" is not like any
American mainstream film you've seen in
a while. As the title suggests, this film's
irony lies not in its subject matter but in the
way the viewer might misinterpret its mul
tiple layers.

The film follows 73-year-old Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) on his last road
trip — a journey from lowa to Michigan to see his estranged brother, Lyle (Harry

Dean Stanton). Alvin's "rig" is a little un
usual, for he rides a lawn mower with a
trailer attached. He is unable to drive and
far too stubborn to take public transporta
tion.
The people who surround Alvin — his
"slow" daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek), his
Hostess Snoball-munching neighbor and
the local boys — are a well-sketched, sag-

ging bunch. Alvin meets several more people along the road: a pregnant runaway,
cross-country cyclists, a middle-aged couple and a country priest. He shares different
aspects of his "story" with each one.
Farnsworth delivers an excellent performance as Straight. His portrayal saves the

film from slipping into sentimental
drivel at several points. Alvin has a
lifetime of experience behind him,
and he is not your stereotypical bit
ter old man. He moves slowly, and
he speaks honestly. When a cocky
young cyclist asks him to name the
worst part about being old, Alvin
replies, "Remembering when you
were young."
As the story unfolds, the viewer
realizes that Alvin's statement does
not only mean that he feels nostal
gic for his young healthy body and
his dreams; it also means remem
bering the mistakes he made and
the pain he's experienced in war

and drunkenness.
"The Straight Story" juxtaposes the individual and the cosmos at every level, from
the double-meaning of the title to the camera shots balancing between Alvin's life
worn face and acres of golden wheat. Alvin travels to see his brother so they can sit and
look at the stars together one last time. Even Alvin's speeches speak to the complex
relationship between a man and his world: the single twig does indeed snap easily,
while the bundle never breaks. The film pays homage to the idea of the single effect in
storytelling.
The odd artistic coupling of David Lynch and Disney results in one of the most un
usual and oddly thought-provoking films of the year. This film asks you to suspend
your lightning-fast powers of post-modern cynicism and meditate on some slow-mov
ing truths. "The Straight Story" is far from simple, but it is simply wonderful.
