# Not your ordinary Saturday morning cartoons
## cover 
### 
Over 20 years have passed since the
first Spike and Mike's Festival of An
imation hit theatres. A collection of
cartoons, most lasting a few minutes,
have been compiled by Spike and
Mike, and some have even hit the
jackpot with lucrative TV careers.
Intermission welcomed the chance
to talk with Spike, one of the two ani
mated festival creators. They have
both a "sick and twisted" and a tamer
animated circuit, and this weekend
offers Stanford University an oppor
tunity to laugh mightily at the sicker
side of animation. We all know you 'd
laugh at these cartoons... so read
on.
Intermission: How did you and
Mike get started with this festival
and with making cartoons in gener
al?
Spike: Um, I got started a long time
ago. . . . We were always doing
bands. I was in a '50s-style rock band
called "Sterno and the Flames."
After the band broke up we started
doing rock-and-roll films. The origi
nal festival came out of that. We had
all these films we had made.
I: When was the original animation
festival? And when did "Sick and
Twisted" come about?
S: The original animation festival
was in 1977, and "Sick and Twisted"
first came out in 1990.
I: Where did you start showing the
festival?
S: We started in Riverside, Calif., at
Riverside City College. It was small
then, just one school. ,
1: Did you go to that college?
S: I'm a high school dropout.
I: How did you learn about anima
tion?
S: 1 don't do any of the hands-on ren
dering myself. I am pretty much just
doing production, promotion and
content development.
I: What are your favorite anima
tions from this year's festival?
S: From the current "Sick and Twist
ed" festival I like the film "Swing
Sluts," which I made with Brett
Johnson. Another film I like is
"Bowlin' fer Souls," which has been
very, very well-received.
I: If I read correctly, you guys helped
launch cartoons such as "South
Park," "tieavis and Bullhead" and
" Wallace and Gromit." That's pret
ty impressive! Which animations do
you look at today and feel the most
pride about?
S: There's been a lot. "Rugrats." We
helped the guy who animated "Toy
Story." Stuff like that. "Beavis and
Butthead" is what I am most proud
of because I was involved in the orig-

talks with Lauren Russell about

his love for all things animated

inal creation of it.
I: How would you address critics of
violent animations in your festi
vals? These people agree that vio
lence is something which does not
enormously affect people who are
not inherently violent hut that it
makes people with violent tenden
cies more likely to act out violent
behaviors. / have to agree with
them to a certain degree.
S: That's interesting. Good ques
tion. We had that with "Beavis and
Butthead" when that came out, lots
of criticism of the violence. I dunno,
it's just cartoons, it's fantasy. I
would blame the U.S. government
more than a cartoon. The govern
ment teaches people how to blow
things up and kill people.
I: So you don't think that the ani
mations in your festival are likely
to make people try similar things to
what is shown in the festival or to
make people more violent in gener
al?
S: It's about humor. I think every
body is there to just have a good

time. They're not there to become
more violent.
I: Did any of thefilms in your festi
val this year go beyond your defin
itions of "Sick and Twisted?" Or
do you go by the philosophy that
the more twisted it is, the better?
S: There's been very few that we
had to cut out for that reason. The
most intense thing was called
"Sloaches Funhouse," by a guy
named Steve Margolis. It's pretty
disgusting — an animation from
one of our older festivals where this
guy does all these disgusting things.
I: That's sort of the theme in all
your animations though, isn't it?
S: Yeah.
I: What are your hopes for the festi
val in the future, and why has it
stayed mostly on college campuses
so far?
S: We're working on that right now.
We got hooked up with William
Morris agency recently, in Los An
geles. I'd like to get wide distribu

tion for it just to get the publicity
it needs. I would like to see it
everywhere.
I: What is your role in the festi
val? I know it's named after you,
hut what exactly do you do?
S: We do ink and paint, coloriza
tion, transferring to 35mm —
lots of stuff. Basically every part
of the production process.
I: Is there a reason why you left
Mike's name in the festival title
after he passed away?
S: The festival had always been
named that. I didn't see a reason
to change the name just because
Mike wasn't alive anymore. It's
our festival.
I: What animations in your show
now do you see becoming as big
as "Beavis and Butthead" in the
future?
S: Not so much animations, but
people — animators. I have
been working a lot with this guy
Oliviae who did "Bowlin' fer
Souls." We are really excited

about him. There are people in
our show like Oliviae who are
going to be just as creative if not
more so.
I: Which colleges are more recep
tive? Do you find that different
schools give a different response
to the festival?
S: We try to find the places that
are cool, that have students who
appreciate these films. The
schools we do the show at are all
pretty much party schools or
have cool students who are open
minded.
I: I wish we could say Stanford
was a party school!
S: Yeah, well, it has a student
body who appreciates this kind
of stuff. It's kind of the places
where people are more progres
sive that like the festival the best,
though.
I: What are you excited about for
next year's festival? Anything
we should keep our eyes out for?
S: Oliviae, the guy who did

"Bowling for Souls," is doing
something else. It's called
"Atomic Punk," about this guy
with a nuclear device — you
have to see it.
I: How have audiences respond
ed to this year's festival?
S: This year we have a lot of new
films. We are getting really good
feedback. We have actually en
tered some of our animations in
the Sundance Film Festival, and
one of them was a competitor at
Cannes. It's very diverse humor.
I'd like to emphasize that there is
tons of new stuff. I did a live-ac
tion intro to the festival this time
where I am blowing up Teletub
bies. My friend Melissa Vashe
shot it, and I transferred it to
35mm film. It is pretty darn
funny.
I: Thanks for speaking with us
Spike. / am sure many Stanford
students look forward to your
shoK.
S: Thanks. I hope so!
