Spike and Mike's "Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation" is not for those with
weak stomachs. Nor is it for those offended by blatant violation of certain basic
rules for human morality.
In this year's festival, for example, a newborn baby is shown being brutally beat
en to death and shoved back inside its mother's uterus by an abusive father. This level
of depiction of violence, at least for me, goes beyond funny and even beyond "sick."
While the vast majority of the animations portray a twisted humor with a degree

that one can laugh at
(or at least tolerate),
some of Spike and
Mike's animations
made even a sick

humor connoisseur like myself wonder why anyone would have the nerve to think of
them, much less put them on film.
As usual. Spike and Mike's festival delivers a mixed bag of humor. Some of the an
imations, such as Jason Johnson's "Beyond Grandpa II," David Lipson's "Tyson I
am Not An Animal" and Sean Scott's "Legend of Raggot," are hysterically funny.
In "Beyond Grandpa II," we laugh at old age as "Grandpa" sits with his wrinkled
testicles hanging out of his shorts, or as he painfully uses the toilet after a large dose

of chocolate. "The Legend of Raggot" tells the urban legend of two men who decid
ed to erotically make the best use of a hamster and ended up with a broken nose and
a burned behind.
The majority of this year's animations, however, will leave you hanging for a
punch line and wondering why anyone would bother to animate such a stupid idea.
For every funny one there are about three dull animations, and it is fairly tedious and
frustrating to sit through so many boring animations for a few minutes' worth of
gems.
Spike (who is interviewed "here) and Mike (who passed away five years ago) are
the kings of sick humor, and they have been significantly involved in the growing pop
ularity this decade of sick-humored cartoons such as "Beavis and Butthead" and
"South Park." While they deserve credit for helping to launch many of the popular
independent animations on television today ("Rugrats" and "Wallace and Gromit"),
this festival does not deliver the kind of quality (perhaps that is very much the wrong
word) that you see on television today.
If you don't value your weekend time as much as I do, go watch "Spike and
Mike's" festival this weekend. For about the price of a movie, you'll get a bunch of
really bad movies. Perhaps only the truly sick and twisted will not be able to do the
math on that one.
