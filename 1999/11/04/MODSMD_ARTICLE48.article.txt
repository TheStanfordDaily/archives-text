## This 'Bone' belongs in the doghouse 
### 
I relish the chance to rag big-time on a movie. Too often, a film hits an uneasy medi
ocrity, hitting the right notes on several occasions while completely missing on oth
ers.
"The Bone Collector," a cheesy detective story with love, seizures and Ed O'Neill
(a.k.a. Mr. A 1 Bundy), makes you cringe at all the mistakes made by the characters as

well the screenwriters. Here is my evidence of this
movie's awfulness.
Exhibit A: The inexperienced cop motif. I have
seen probably dozens of movies by now where there is
the element of the rookie officer or detective. Here,
Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) checks out a myste
rious and dark corner of New York all by herself solely
because (as far as I could tell) she is an inexperienced
cop who is also mighty confident and self-sufficient.

Exhibit B: Angelina Jolie. As said detective, Jolie confirms why 1 don't like her act
ing style at all. She grated on my nerves in the otherwise excellent "Playing by Heart,"
and she strikes again in "Collector." Her role is severely abused throughout the movie,
as she moves from pants-wearing owner of the household to seductive lover and hero
cop. Either Jolie forgot how to act, or she lets her sexy appearance get in the way.
Exhibit C: Ed O'Neill. I actually enjoyed his aura in"The Spanish Prisoner," where
he also played an officer of sorts. But in "Collector," I couldn't understand why he, as
Det. Paulie Sellitto, would be so idiotic as to set up shop in the home of quadriplegic
Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington). Sellitto, along with disgruntled Capt. Cheney
(Michael Rboker) and Det. Solomon (Mike McGlone), botch the case to no end.
Exhibit D: The ending. I love surprise endings. I've praised "The Usual Suspects,"
"The Sixth Sense" and even "Fargo" as prime examples of quality, dynamic scriptwrit
ing. But the ending and its buildup in "Collector" simply stunk, no doubt about it. It is
incoherent, nonsensical and in bad taste. I wonder if Jeffery Deaver's book is this bad,
although I heard on the radio, reliable source or not, that it's fairly decent.

Cross Examination: Why the one-star rating? Queen Latifah ("Living Out Loud")
has her usual commanding stage presence, but even her talents are largely wasted as
Thelma, a loyal and fearless nurse. With Washington and Latifah on the same set, the
film should have been electric. But from what I've seen, "Collector" might have been
better off gathering dust in Universale backlot.
I don't know if I've won this "case," but hopefully you get the gist of my argument.
"Collector" doesn't do much other than provide unintentional laughs, confused stares
and utter disappointment.
