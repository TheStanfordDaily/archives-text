Depicted on the cover of the Verve Pipe's new self-titled album is a dia
gram of a frog — reminiscent of high school biology class. At first
glance, the image of the band seems incongruent with that of the anato
my of a frog. However, after listening to the album, one realizes that the two
have a few things in common.
The CD appears to be an attempt to dissect the motivations and impulses of
the band members. The effort is also an effort to diagram what constitutes a rock

album, and in this respect, the members of the
band turn out a solid if not spectacular effort.
First, the songs seem to touch a much more per-

sonal note than the band's three previous efforts. "Hero," the catchy tune that
has become the album's first hit song, is an introspective look at one person's si
multaneous desire for greatness and realization of the impossibility of the idea:
"A creep from the cradle and a hero driven wanna be / For your abuse, but not
intended for internal use / I'm just a jerk, but a hero's what I wanna be."
With the exception of "Hero," "The Verve Pipe" gets off to a slow start. The
highlight of the CD is the sensual sixth track, "Kiss Me Idle." Its striking phras
es about the nature of love ("A mouth that's open wide and speechless / Seems
like such a waste / Kiss me idle") convey a quiet desperation that is sincerely
touching.
The final two songs further redeem the effort and remain indented on the
mind long after the end of the tracks. The soft melody of "She Has Faces" builds
to a crescendo with the distorted melodies of a guitar in the background. The
final song, "La La," features a catchy tune that is suggestive of earlier Beatles
songs.
The album as a whole highlights the band's shift toward a more radio-friend
ly pop sound. There are moments when this shift seems like pure genius, but
most of the time the more laid-back tracks leave one longing for the grunge-dri
ven tracks of previous albums.
