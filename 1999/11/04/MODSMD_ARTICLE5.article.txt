# Ghosh speaks on craft of writing
## 
### Nudira Hira Contributing writer 
Amitav Ghosh, world
renowned author of such award
winning novels as "The Shadow
Lines," spoke to a room of more
than 100 people at 8 p.m. in An
nenberg Auditorium last night.
Institute of International Stud
ies Consulting Prof. Rafiq Dossani
welcomed the crowd to the inau
gural talk of the South Asia Initia
tive's quarterly distinguished

speakers series. He spoke on the
initiative's commitment to increas
ing course offerings and events on
South Asia at Stanford and pro
moting awareness about what
South Asian studies can contribute
to the University.
For his talk, Ghosh read his
essay, "The March of the Novel
Through History: The Testimony
of My Grandfather's Bookcase,"
which was published in the Spring
1998 edition of "The Kenyon Re
view" and awarded the prestigious

Pushcart Prize this year.
The essay explores Ghosh's
childhood experiences of litera
ture, primarily guided by his clan
destine raids of his grandfather's
bookcase during the summers he
spent in Calcutta. He expands from
there to include questions of lan
guage, the international nature of
fiction and the question of the
novel itself.
"This then is the peculiar para
dox of the novel," Ghosh writes,
"those of us who love novels often
read them because of the elo
quence with which they communi
cate a 'sense of place.' Yet the truth
is that it is the very loss of a lived
sense of place that makes their fic
tional representation possible."
After his reading, Ghosh fielded
questions from his diverse audi
ence, which included Stanford stu
dents, professors from Stanford
and UC-Berkeley, the San Francis
co-based Consul General of India
and various members of the local
South Asian community.
The questions addressed
Ghosh's literary influences and his
experiences as a writer, teacher
and anthropologist, as well as his
view of broader issues of South.
Asian culture and literature.
Prasanna Ananth, a sophomore
and one of the cultural committee
chairs for Sanskriti, the South
Asian students' organization, said,
"1 thought he was really inspira
tional," she said.
"It's not too often that you get
to be in an intimate setting with a
writer that's so famous who has the
same background as you. You
could tell that the audience was
very moved by his talk."
K B. Chandrashekhar, the
chairman of Exodus Communica
tions, Inc. and the event's patron,
said he was pleased with the results
of the lecture.
"I asked myself, 'How do you

one, to the beautv of Indian cul

the overall program I've undertak

en to promote awareness and cul
tural exchange."
Cultural and Social Anthropol
ogy Assoc. Prof. Akhil Gupta in
troduced Ghosh, detailing some of
the author's educational history

and.in doing so, claiming him as a
social anthropologist. Ghosh said
during his talk that he was not too
unhappy to relegate such a label to
the past.
"Mv life never fit into anv of the

categories of the Academy,"
Ghosh said.
Gupta stressed Ghosh's career
as a prolific writer and his own
pleasure in having a speaker such
as Ghosh at Stanford.
