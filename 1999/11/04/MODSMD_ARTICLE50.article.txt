# Unwound
## A 						Single History, 1991-1997 
### 
Bad music is always far more fun to review
than good music, so I found myself deeply
disappointed upon listening to Unwound's
recently released collection, "A Single History."
I was not allowed to exercise my perverse delight
in insulting bad albums, as this Unwound CD is re-

ally, really good.
This is a collection
of Unwound songs,
all previously re-

leased, spanning from the band's inception in 1991
to a song released on their last single.
"Broken E Strings," originally recorded for a
Jabberjaw compilation and one of Unwound's
finest songs, serves as a good example for the Un
wound "formula." The song opens with gentle play
ing, each instrument intricately building off the oth
ers. But as soon as the listener gets used to the deli
cate calm of the song, it explodes, breaking into a

sudden display of Unwound's unique form of loud,
controlled chaos.
Unwound also knows how to keep things origi
nal, throwing in a touch of other instruments, mum
bling clever lyrics and not limiting their music to a
strict alternation of quiet and loud.
The only disappointment comes from "Said Ser
ial," where grating horns make for a somewhat
painful listen. However, bad Unwound is still better
than average, and even this song started to grow on
me after a few listens.
Convinced that Unwound's more recent albums
had been a bit boring and predictable, I originally
threw "A Single History" into the stereo anticipat
ing the witty, biting phrases that 1 could write for my
review. But as it turns out, while you all get a boring
read, I get to hang on to a really great CD.
