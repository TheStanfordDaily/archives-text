# method man and Redman
## Blackout 
### 
Thank God for Russell Simmons — he brought to
gether Method Man and Redman. The two were
united on Simmons' documentary "The Show,"
and they created the anthem "How High," which would
become the first of many collaborations between these
two artists. The growth of this dynamic relationship has

brought forth the first full
length album, "Blackout,"
from Def Squad's finest
and Wu-Tang's pride.

Lyrically, Meth and
Red perform at the high level we expect from them.
Method Man's storytelling ability and Redman's spon
taneity mesh well as the Funkdoctor and Johnny Blaze
feed off each other, exchanging verses with perfect pre
cision. The album was recorded on the road while the
two toured on the liardknock Life Tour, and they seem
to be having fun every step of the way.

T he album kicks off with "Blackout," the second sin
gle, which has a typically catchy hook hollered out by
Redman.
The cut "4 Seasons" features Def Jam label-mates Ja
Rule and LL Cool J. Method Man shows his lyrical ex
pertise and takes the listener in a lyrical maze, "Go
straight cuckoo and terrorize rap, do you? /1 do my best
work stressed out and under pressure / Deep inside the
mind is where you'll find my buried treasure / I'm still
wild, still Tical / Still gritty style, foul, crimi-niminal, in
dividual / Sing a song a six street / Pocket full of chits."
The Rza contributes to the album as he produces
"Run 4 Cover," featuring Wu-affiliates Ghostface Kil
lah and Street Life. The highlights of the album come on
"Checka" and "1,2, 1, 2." On these tracks, Meth and
Red bring back the unforgettable sound that we all re
member from "How High."
On "Checka," Redman describes, "Steppin' out the

crowd throwin' bolo's / Flicki-di-flame, owh! when
chrome .44's / Loadin' it up, packin' it back, ready to
splash for real / Spit flows out the gail, God tried to bail
/ It's hectic, 45-6 gimme ya grips / That's more dollars in
them tongues in them go-go chicks."
The album also features three bonus tracks which are
their prior hits: "Big Dogs," "All Rite Cha" and "How
High."
Overall, "Blackout" proves to be a solid album.
However, it brings little new creativity or maturity and
is thus the same flavor we have already heard from
Method Man and Redman over the past few years. Al
though their no-holds-barred style works well, listeners
might begin to feel overkill with the duo, considering
that both artists will be releasing solo albums in Decem
ber.
