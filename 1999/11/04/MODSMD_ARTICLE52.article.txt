## Penile dismemberment... and how to prevent it 
### Roxy Sass Staff writer 
As a perk for being Miss Sass, I get first dibs on reviewing all sexually explicit mate
rial sent to "The Stanford Daily." Recently, one such video slid across the Intermission
desk and into my hands. "Revenge of Mr. Willie," distributed by Cranium Candy, is a
super-soft, wannabe-porn about the misadventures of an disembodied, vengeful penis.
I generally don't watch such low-quality flicks. This movie had been copied onto a
beat-up videocassette, and the box cover was fresh from a desktop printer. But the topic
stirred up remembrances of childhood fears.
When I was a teen, I was terrified of penises. They were very foreign. 1 had nothing
even remotely resembling one on my own body. They could move, grow, expectorate
and respond to environmental stimuli. As far as 1 could tell, they were independent or
ganisms living in symbiotic relationships with their male hosts.
So I took "Mr. Willie" to Meyer to revive my childhood demons, but instead I was
introduced to the penile demons plaguing my male counterparts.
The movie was the most horrendous 1 'd ever seen. Don't buy it. Seriously, if you want
porn, check out the Vixen trilogy from Green, which is actually X-rated.
In case you're curious, here are some highlights. The first hour is plot development,
bespeckled by exposed breasts. Then Pete, the owner of Mr. Willie, dies mid-orgasm
from too much sex, pinning his alarmed girlfriend beneath him. His other girlfriends
enter, and in the ensuing knife fight, the penis is amputated.
The 3-1/2 inch penis, who looks and squeaks suspiciously like a rubber doggie toy,
seeks revenge. Many scenes follow in which Mr. Willie, who can fly, dangles from an al
most invisible fishline in the faces of his victims. Mr. Willie hops around town, tries to
drown his naked sister in a bathtub and gets pierced at a lesbian party. A few high-tech
scenes have a computer-generated penis composited in the foreground of moving shots
to give you the sensation of looking over Mr. Willie's shoulder.
In the end, Mr. Willie is nabbed in a mousetrap using panties as bait. Then lots of
complicated, supernatural stuff happens, and Mr. Willie spiritually reunites with Pete.
The movie was terrible. But it did get me"thinking. It was obviously directed toward
a male audience — hence all the breasts. And surprisingly, the male characters were
more threatened by the dismembered penis than any of the female characters. Women
were constantly picking it up to examine it, but men vomited at the sight.
It seems the men shared a deep-rooted fear of losing their penises. Miss Sass decid
ed to discover just how likely this was to happen.
The penis can be disfigured in many ways.
Like any other appendage, it can be chafed, bruised and scratched. If left out in the
sun, it will burn, and if it's not kept warm, it can get frostbite.
For college-aged men, probably the most common form of mutilation is piercing.
This can be superficial or deep and can run horizontally, vertically, widthwise or length
wise. But this form of mutilation is voluntary, so if a man doesn't want metal in his penis,
he shouldn't get pierced.
Accidental injuries are possible but extremely rare. A man can fracture his penis if
his erect penis is subjected to extreme trauma. The rupture of the covering of one or
both corpora cavernosa (the fluid-filled chambers that make the penis rigid) is accom
panied by a characteristic cracking sound. The deformed penis becomes immediately
swollen and discolored. Fortunately, reconstructive surgery nearly always restores the
organ to its original aesthetic and functional condition.
Fracture generally occurs during sex and, more rarely, during masturbation. Men can
lessen the chances of such an injury by never beating down an unwanted erection, al
ways using lubrication and avoiding sexual positions that hurt or put them at risk of
thrusting into your partner's pubic bone.
Testicular rupture is the other serious form of injury. A normal blow to the testes will
cause bruising and swelling, but because the testes are highly mobile and pliable, per
manent damage is rare. Only an extremely severe blow, such as landing on the center
bar of a bike at breakneck speed, will rupture the testes. Reconstruction is also possible,
but the victim may be left^terile.
Castration of adult men is almost unheard of. Some cults such as Heaven's Gate en
courage it, and a very few berate women perform it as revenge. Chemical castration, on
the other hand, is administered to many Californian sex offenders as a condition for pa
role. They are injected with Depo Provera, which lowers their testosterone levels, there
by reducing their sex drive. However, the effects are reversible.
Later in life, cancer poses a very real threat, and in these cases, early detection is the
penis's only hope. Very early stages of penile cancer can be treated by localized tumor
removal, but a penis with advanced cancer must be amputated. Advanced stages of
prostrate cancer are commonly treated by castration combined with an antiandrogen
drug.
So men, "Revenge of Mr. Willie" is a horror flick with just enough basis in reality to
be truly frightening (I'm talking about the dismemberment part, not the fishline scenes).
If you care about your penises, protect them from extreme temperatures, extreme
speeds and extreme girlfriends, stay out of jail and have regular medical checkups.
Your willies should travel with you well into old age.
