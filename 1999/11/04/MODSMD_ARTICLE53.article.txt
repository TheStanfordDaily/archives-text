# The
						Hong Kong Flower Lounge Comes to Palo Alto
## 
### 
The Hong Kong Flower Lounge has
been a popular dining spot for the Stan
ford crowd for as long as we can remem
ber; it's the kind of place that's respectable
enough — and pricey enough — to take
your parents to, yet "authentic" enough to
be called-real Chinese.
Specializing in unique dishes such as
minced squab in lettuce cup, drunken
prawns, par-boiled sliced geoduck clams
and Szechuan sole, the restaurant is
equally well-known for its lunchtime Dim
Sum.
But until the restaurant opened up its
downtown Palo Alto branch this year,
Stanford students have always had to
make the half-hour drive out to Millbrae
if they wanted to enjoy the Flower
Lounge's culinary delights. This week,
Intermission tested out the pak-choy and
the bean curd at this conveniently located,
Marguerite-accessible Hong Kong
Flower Lounge.
We had heard rumors about the
Hong Kong Flower Lounge's Olympic
themed set dinners, and we were quite
excited to hear about specifics and try
them out.
For those cheapskates out there, the
restaurant offers a "Bronze Dinner" —
at a mere $298 for a table of 10 people.
This 10-dish spread includes a deep fried
Dim Sum combination, fried prawn with
walnut in special mayonnaise sauce,
deep fried stuffed crab claws, the ever
popular Peking duck, saut£ed assorted
vegetables, deep fried fillet of black cod
with spicy salt, Yang Chow fried rice and
a mysterious "Special Dessert of the
Day."
We had not seen the word "fried" so
many times on the same menu since our
long road trip to the deep South last
month!
Well, if you're not in the mood for
cardiac arrest at age 20, then for just 70
bucks more, you can upgrade to a "Silver
Dinner," in which many of the fried dish
es are replaced by saut£ed, smoked and
braised items, such as saut£ed pea sprout
with fresh mushroom, smoked fillet of
black cod and saut6ed lobster with spe

cial chili sauce over noodles. Additional
ly, the Yang Chow fried rice becomes a
Fook-Kin fried rice (and you know what
that means.. .)> whereas the hot and
sour soup with seafood becomes —
poof! — a braised shark's fin soup with
crab meat.
Anyway, all this "silver" and
"bronze" business is simply kid's stuff;
the "Gold Dinner" is where it's at. This
$448 package buys you some special as
sorted appetizers, braised superior
shark's fin soup, braised sliced abalone
with fresh mushrooms and fried rice with
dried scallop and egg white. Oh, the hi
erarchy of a set-dinner.
Unfortunately, there is no equivalent
of a "Platinum Dinner" for vegetarians.
A scaled-down "Gold Dinner," though
still quite delicious, is the best alternative
Flower Lounge can offer you.
Our three filling main-course entrees
consisted of sauteed black mushrooms
with Chinese pak-choy, vegetarian bean
curd sheet rolls and the classic dish of
braised tofu, black mushrooms and sea
sonal vegetables. We were particularly
impressed by the chefs skillful prepara
tion of the vegetable dish, which was
sauteed to a perfect color, allowing the
light and delicate flavors to stand on
their own.
The vegetables were equally satisfy-

ing in the
next dish
and the
braised
tofu was
savory
and nice-

ly textured as well. However, where the
light brown sauce worked well with the
first dish, we were disappointed at the re
dundancy of this same sauce used as the
base in all three dishes. Really, how
much brown sauce does one need, no
matter how tasty?
Furthermore, the vegetarian bean
curd sheet rolls — a mixture of vegeta
bles carefully wrapped into a roll with
bean curd sheet, deep fried and braised
with seasonal vegetables and served in a
clay pot — added variety with its distinct
texture and bamboo flavor, but it was a
bit greasy (perhaps reminiscent of the
oily-oinking "Bronze Dinner") for our
tastes.
For dessert we had sweet pureed wal
nut soup served warm and a coconut
cake. This was definitely our favorite
part of the meal. The walnut soup was
creamy yet not too heavy or sweet, and
the coconut cake was similarly light and
subtle. Both of these sumptuous items
were made with a tapioca-rice base that,
unlike the often butter / milk / egg
based Western desserts, these sweets
gave some refreshing closure to the
meal.
Overall, this place has tasty vegetari
an options and fun package dinners for
those party animals who have all their
Chinese relatives in town. For what it's
worth, Hong Kong Flower Lounge is
perhaps the most authentic Chinese din
ner you can get in Palo Alto — Chef
Cho's aside.
