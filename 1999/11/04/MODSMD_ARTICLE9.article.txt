## Mobs fight for food after Indian cyclone 
### 
PARADWIP. India (AP) â€”
Angry mobs looted aid trucks,
robbed desperate survivors and
fought over food in cyclone-rav
aged eastern India on Wednesday.
Officials used bulldozers to collect
hundreds of bodies.
In rice fields that have become
lakes and along roads turned into
rivers, bloated human corpses lie
rotting for mile after mile alongside
the carcasses of drowned cows,
goats and pigs.
"So many thousands have died
that there is no one left to cremate
them," said Dhaneshwar Mohanty,
who fled the flooded port city of
Paradwip on Wednesday.
Five days after eastern Orissa
state was pounded by one of India's
worst cyclones, officials had no way
to estimate an accurate death toll.
A senior army officer involved in
the rescue operation told The
Associated Press on condition of
anonymity that it could reach
10,000 to 20,(XK).
More than 15 million people live
in the area hit by the cyclone.
The storm was one of India's
worst, possibly more deadly than a
cyclone in 1971 that killed 10,000
people. Officials have said the
storm has set back the state's eco
nomic development more than 20
years.
Furious gangs tried to stop every
passing car. bus or truck to grab
whatever was available. Relief
trucks were looted before they
could reach desperate rural areas.
Those stuck in the seemingly end
less traffic jams were most vulnera
ble.
Near the small village of
Panikuli, Lai Dev rushed across a
road strewn with broken egg car
tons to reach an army truck. Hailing
his arms to get attention.
"They raped a woman in front of
me," Dev cried, his face battered,
"and then they took everything
away from the bus."
Police said they have received
dozens of similar reports.
Survivors have fled Paradwip
any way they can to reach the state

capital, Bhubaneswar, 60 miles
inland. But the capital had little
food and no clean water.
There were reports of food riots
and shops and cafes were closed.
Schools were full of homeless peo
ple, with the overflow sleeping in
the streets around burning tires.
The stench of rotting flesh near
water wells and canals portend a
potential epidemic. Workers will
need days to repair highways so
that aid can reach the most devas
tated areas.
R.P. Singh, director of the Pow
ergrid Corp., estimated it would
take a month to restore normal
electric power in the state. Orissa
normally consumes 1.600
megawatts a day, but was receiving
only 100 megawatts since" the
cyclone hit.
"Many of the substations in the
state are under water," he said.

Workers could not install emergen
cy power poles because "the
ground is soggy and water-laden."
The cyclone caused extensive
damage to the port in Paradwip,
which handles shipments of the
chromite, dolomite and manganese
mined in the state. Domestic news
reports said that it could take
months to repair the damage and
restore operations at the port.
Orissa is among the most under
developed states in India and rice
cultivation is the main employer.
The cyclone wiped out much of the
rice crop.
Most of Orissa's 3(K) large and
medium industries are based on
minerals, steel and cement. All of
them are concentrated in the
coastal area, which bore the bruril
of the cyclone.
President Bill Clinton said Tues
day that the United States would

donate more than $2 million in
food and $ 1 (K).(KX) in tents and plas
tic sheeting.
Those who survived eight hours
of pounding wind and surging tides
in Friday's storm had little time to
mourn relatives and friends who
died before their eyes.
"People were falling and the
water kept sweeping over them,"
said Natwar Naik, 65, riding a truck
out of Paradwip with his remaining
family. "My grandsons have not got
even a biscuit to eat all these days."
In Paradwip. a port authority
bulldozer and trucks from the fer
tilizer factory scooped up bodies
from every corner of the city and
dumped them, blackened from
mud and rot, onto the sandy beach.
"T could not identify a single one of
my workers," said D.K. Basu, a
port authority worker. "It's ghast
ly"
