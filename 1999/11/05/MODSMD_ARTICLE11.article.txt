# Less TV can prevent obesity in children

Those childhood addictions to
Super Mario Brothers and Ihe
Muppet Babies may have cost you
and your classmates a few extra
pounds, says a recent study by
Thomas Robinson, assistant profes
sor of pediatrics.
Robinson's study, published in
the Oct. 27 edition of the Journal of
the American Medical Association,
shows a link between childhood
obesity and the amount of television
that children watch each day.
C hildren who participated in a
program that cut back their amount
of television and video game usage
emerged thinner after seven months
than children in a control group who
were not administered the program.
"I was surprised by the size of the
changes â€” the magnitude of differ
ence between the two groups,"
Robinson said in an interview with
the Daily. "On average, we wit
nessed a two pound per child weight
loss and a loss of almost an inch in
waistline per child."
The study was conducted on a
group of l l )2 third and fourth grade
students from San Jose, with the ex
perimental group coming from one
elementary school and the control
group from a "sociodemographical
ly and scholastically matched
school," said Robinson's report.
The program administered to the
experimental group was an 1 S-les
son, 6-month classroom curriculum
that taught students how "to reduce
television, videotape and video
game use." according to the report.
On average, the students reduced
their television usage by seven hours
per week and video game use by an
hour and a half.

"1 didn't know what to expect as
far as how the students would react
to the study, hut I found them very
enthusiastic," said Robinson. "The
curriculum of the program got them
excited about the challenge (of
watching less television) and prov
ing adults wrong."
Robinson says that his findings
may prove to be a "promising, popu
lation-based approach to help pre
vent childhood obesity."
Rather than simply targeting kids
at high-risk for obesity, the program
utilized for the experimental group
could be used in schools nationwide,
leading to an overall reduction in
television usage and consequently
healthier, less obese children.
Robinson says that the biggest
obstacle to weaning adolescents
away from television and reducing
obesity is the ease of access that chil
dren now have to television.
"American children spend more
time watching television and video
tapes and playing video games than
doing anything else except sleep
ing," wrote Robinson in his report.
"We found through the study
that over 40 percent of the students
participating had T.V. in their bed
rooms, a number reflective of the
nationwide total. The easiest way for
parents to control their children's
usage is not to have a T.V. in the
bedroom," said Robinson.
Robinson hopes to get his pro
gram ol television reduction dom
inated Ufa widei*audiencc in the fu
ture.
"The program conclusively
showed that it is possible to reduce
television time for children," said
Robinson. "We want to get this pro
gram more widely distributed but
we simply don't have the resources
right now."
