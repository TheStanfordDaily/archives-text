## Navy ship takes divers to crash site Investigators hope to find plane's 'black boxes' and clues to cause of accident 
### 
NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) — With
a break in the weather, a Navy sal
vage ship was finally freed Thursday
to take its divers on a 10-hour trip
through high waves to the grim
1 crash site of Egypt Air Flight 990.
Investigators were hoping to
dodge foul weather long enough
Friday to search for the plane's
"black boxes," which they hope
hold the secret to the cause of the
crash off the coast of Nantucket,
Mass.
The Navy was relying on seas
calming just enough to drop a giant
underwater robot — the Deep
Drone — into the Atlantic, where it
can be lowered 270 feet to the ocean
floor to retrieve wreckage and bod
ies. Divers aboard the USS Graple
will try to make the treacherous
journey as well.
The black boxes — the flight
data recorder and the cockpit voice
recorder — are considered keys to
figuring out why Flight 990 plum
meted into to the ocean on Sunday,
killing all 217 on board.
Without them, the National
Transportation Safety Board was
investigating all possibilities, learn
ing what it could from radar data
and cargo manifests.
NTSB Chairman James Hail said
nothing hazardous was apparently
in the cargo holds.
He also said there were not two
armed guards on the plane, despite
a policy of the airline to sometimes
have them aboard. And he added
that 30 Egyptian military personnel
were required to go through metal
detectors before boarding the plane
in New York.
The NTSB said it has already
begun studying the possibility of
human error in the crash.

A special team of investigators
will continue to look into the back
grounds of the llight crew, including
how they spent the last days before
they climbed into the cockpit.
If the seas permit, the Grapple
will likely finish its journey to the
crash site early Friday morning.
Navy officials warned that the ship
might be forced to turn around if
the sea swells are too strong.
The forecast calls for rough seas
from late Friday until Sunday.
Navv Rear Adm. William (i.

Sutton said he would not risk using
divers if the seas we*e too rough
Friday.
"My nilmber one concern here
... is the saletv of these young men
and women who are going to he
out on scene conducting this
incredibly dangerous event."he
said. "We do not want to increase
this tragedy any more than it
already is."
A second ship, the Mohawk, a
Navy vessel equipped with special
sonar and remote operated robots.

was also sent out to sea late Thurs
day.
Rough seas and high winds have
kept divers away from the crash
site since Tuesday.
Large pieces of wreckage would
likely stay put some 250 feet below
water despite the storms, the safety
board has said. But smaller pieces
of debris and human remains could
travel anywhere up to several miles
underwater, said Eric Takakjian, a
private salvage diver not connected
with the search.
