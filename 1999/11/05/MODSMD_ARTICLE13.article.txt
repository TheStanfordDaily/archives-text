# Big break for banks
## Sweeping law approved by Senate 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Senate on Thursday overwhelm
ingly approved a sweeping law
breaking down Depression-era
barriers between banks, insurance
companies and investment firms.
The vote was 90-8. All but one
of the opponents was a Democrat.
President Clinton is ready to
sign the measure, despite warnings
by Democratic critics that it could
lead to price-gouging of con
sumers and to financial conglom
erates that are simply too big and
powerful. In addition, consumer
groups, liberal lawmakers and oth
ers bitterly have opposed the legis
lation on grounds it would jeopar
dize consumers' financial privacy.
The measure will bring "the
concentration of more and more
economic power in the hands of
fewer and fewer people," liberal
Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.,
said during Senate debate.
Quick approval was expected in
the House on financial industry
changes first proposed in Congress
two decades ago.
> At stake is an estimated $350
billion a year that Americans
spend on fees and commissions for
banking, brokerage and insurance
services.
Proponents say the legislation
will save consumers some $15 bil
lion annually, offering them
greater choice and convenience
and spurring competition.
The overhaul, one of the few
major pieces of bipartisan legisla
; tion to emerge from Congress this
year, progressed partly as a result
of industry money.
Over the years, as Wall Street
and the other financial industries
have pushed for such legislation,
• they have poured millions of dol
! lars into lobbying and political
contributions.
I This year, the legislation struck
a raw nerve over the issue of con
! sumers' privacy. Critics are dis
turbed by provisions that would
allow affiliated businesses of the
; newly merged companies to share
• customers' personal financial data
as they offer one-stop shopping
for loans, insurance and invest
ments.

But supporters point to a new
right given to consumers: By writ
ten request, they can stop their
financial companies from sharing
their data with companies outside
the corporate group, such as tele
marketers.
"This is a pro-consumer bill,"
insisted Sen. Charles Schumer, I)
N.Y., whose state is home to Wall
Street and the banking industry.
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, promised the measure
would "bring every city and town
in America a financial supermar
ket ... (and) a diversity of finan
cial products that we have never
seen before."
The White House recently lift
ed its veto threat after administra
tion officials reached a compro
mise with key Republican law
makers on rules requiring that
banks make loans in minority and
low-income communities where
they operate.
Gramm. an outspoken conser
vative who opposes the rules,
managed to kill a similar overhaul
measure over the issue last year.
The legislation repeals the
landmark 1933 Glass-Steagall Act,
which erected the barriers separat
ing the financial services industries
— a response to the devastating
stock market crash of October
1929 that triggered the Great
Depression.
Lawmakers wanted to separate
investment banking, with its
greater penchant for risk, from
commercial banking in a bid to
prevent depositors' money from
being lost in high-flying invest
ments. In 1956, new legislation
took banks out of the insurance
selling business.
Federal regulators have been
chipping away at the legal barriers
in recent years, giving some banks
permission to get into the securi
ties business.
Separate versions of the legisla
tion cleared the Mouse and the
Senate earlier this year, and law
makers and their aides have spent
months negotiating and blending
the two. The final package is clos
er to the House-passed bill.
