LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP)
Aaron McKinney, who beat gay
college student Matthew Shepard
and left him to die on the prairie,
avoided the death penalty Thurs
day by agreeing to serve life in
prison without parole and promis
ing never to appeal his conviction.
Shepard's parents agreed to the
deal.
"I would like nothing better
than to see you die, Mr. McKin
ney. but now is the time to begin
the healing process," Shepard's
father, Dennis, said in court.
"Every time you celebrate
Christmas, a birthday or the
Fourth of July, remember
Matthew isn't. Every time you
wake up in that prison cell,
remember you had the opportuni
ty and the ability to stop your
actions that night."
McKinney, 22, a high school
dropout and drug dealer, is the
second defendant in Shepard's
slaying to get life in prison. Russell
Henderson, 22. pleaded guilty to
murder earlier this year.
McKinney was convicted
Wednesday of murder, aggravated
robbery and kidnapping for luring
Shepard from a Laramie bar, rob
bing him of $20. lashing him lo a
fence and cracking his skull with
blows from a pistol.
Investigators said that robbery
was the main motive, but that
McKinney and Henderson singled
out the slightly built Shepard
because he was gay.
The jury was to begin hearing
arguments Thursday on whether
McKinney should get the death
penalty or life in prison. Instead,

he accepted a deal that his lawyers
had proposed to prosecutors
Wednesday.
"I really don't know what to
say other than that I'm truly sorry
to the entire Shepard • family,"
McKinney said in court. "Never
will a day go by I won't be
ashamed for what I have done."
Dennis Shepard said his family
wanted the trial to show that "this
was a hate crime, pure and simple,
with the added ingredient of robb
bery." He also asked Congress to
pass a stronger hate-crime law.
"You screwed up, Mr. McKin
ney," Shepard said. "You made
the world realize that a person's
lifestyle is not a reason for dis
crimination, intolerance, persecu
tion and violence."
He also said he supports the
death penalty.
Exactly why the Shepards
agreed to the deal was unclear,
though it may have been to avoid
years of appeals. Prosecutor Cal
Rerucha said the appeal process is
"almost inhumane."
As Shepard spoke, he paused at
times to wipe away tears, his voice
breaking. Several jurors wept,
along with members of both legal
teams, spectators, Shepard's
mother, Judy, and friends of the
Shepards.
McKinney's eyes welled up at
times as he listened. McKinney's
stepsister walked out crying, her
head resting on McKinney's
father's shoulder.
Shepard was a 21-year-old
freshman studying political sci
ence at the University of
Wyoming.
