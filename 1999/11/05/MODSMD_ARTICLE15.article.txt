# Protest marks date of hostage crisis
## Iranian students rally outside U.S. embassy 
### 
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) —
Chanting invectives against the
United States and burning Uncle
Sam's effigy a hundred times
over, 10,000 students rallied out
side the former U.S. Embassy on
Thursday to mark the 20th
anniversary of its seizure by
Islamic militants.
But the demonstration was a
far cry from rallies held in previ
ous years, when hundreds of
thousands gathered to celebrate
the takeover of the mission in
Tehran.
The low turnout reflects a
diminishing enthusiasm for the
militant fervor that drove the
students to storm the embassy on
Nov. 4. 1979, and hold 52 Amer
icans hostage for 444 days.
It is also another clear sign of
the struggle for control of Iran's
future between hard-line clerics
and reformist President Moham
mad Khatami.
On Wednesday, about 500
Khatami supporters held their
own rally, where they demanded
a new foreign policy, chanting:
"In policy and diplomacy, we
will deal with the United States
with rationality."
Countering the reformers,
hard-liners on Thursday yelled:
"We will always consider Amer
ica as our enemy. We condemn
those who talk in favor of dia
logue with America."
Speakers, as well as a state
ment read at the end of the rally,
criticized the Iranian govern
ment's recent moves toward bet
ter relations with the United
States.
The demonstrators burned
hundreds of Uncle Sam effigies
amid chants of "Death to Amer
ica! Death to Israel!"
Members of the hard-line
group of paramilitary volunteers,
the Basij. scaled the scaffolding
of a four-story building opposite
the embassy to burn American
and Israeli flags.
