## Editorial Blood Center policy justified 
### 
Potential health risks
presently outweigh
other concerns

After a recent blood drive on
campus, the Stanford Blood
Center has come under criti
cism from some students for its
allegedly "homophobic procedures"
in screening potential blood donors.
The controversy surrounds a
Blood Center questionnaire which
appears to prevent actively gay men
from donating their blrx>d. A state
ment from a Center pamphlet indi
cates: "Do not donate blood if you:
Are a male who has had sexual con
tact with another male, even once,
since 1977..."
Though these students raise some
interesting questions about the pro
cess involved in screening for health
risk factors, their objections at the
Center's policies are misguided. Fur
thermore, they fail to address the
truly important issue at hand: ensur
ing the safety of the blood supply.
First of all, to insist that Stanford
change or formally renounce its poli
cies ignores the fact that the protocols
for blood donation are outlined and
controlled from above — by the fed
eral government. Questions are dic
tated by the Food and Drug Adminis
tration (FDA) and are based on the
policy of the Centers for Disease Con
trol (CDC).
Thus local blood banks, though
operating independently, can effec
tively have very little control over
how that blood is collected. If stu
dents are to pursue a change in policy,
they should focus on doing so at the
national level in this case.

Furthermore, accusations of homo
phobia are blatantly one-dimensional.
The Center also screens for other
potential risk factors, among them
whether donors were born in certain
African countries since 1977.
As unpleasant as it may be to
exclude groups of people from donat
ing blood simply on the basis of
national origin or sexual orientation,
the fact remains that there has been a
disturbingly high correlation between
some groups and greater incidence of
disease. And provided that this corre
lation still remains, it seems sensible
to play it safe and screen for these risk
factors in a questionnaire.
Blood tests can never be a perfect
science, and such procedures only
work to further ensure the safety of
the blood supply, especially when so
much is at stake for those who receive
transfusions.
Though there are many charges
leveled at the Blood Center and the
questionnaire, critics have not come
up with a sufficient argument to
replace these long-standing structural
policies. The burden proof dearly
Jays with the Center's opponents, and
they have not fulfilled it.
Inhere is also little to indicate that
this could be an issue of prejudice or
discrimination at either the federal or
local level. With such a great need for
blood donation it appears utterly fool
ish (and unlikely) that architects of
such policies would actively work to
exclude any segments of the popula
tion without good reason.
ITiough such potential donor ques
tionnaires and their implications will
undoubtedly offend our sensibilities,
they must be maintained as long as
there is any risk to public health and
safety.
