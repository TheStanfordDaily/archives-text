## Finding my inner survivalist 
### 
Travis Kopp

A couple of weeks
ago I asked my
friend from home
(over e-mail) whether he
had any column ideas for
me. He suggested that I
write on the question./is
America ready for

authoritarian leadership?" There was. I
think, a bit of personal agenda motivating
this My friend is rather socially
conscious and has co-founded a student
group al his school called the Pro-Author
itarian leadership Society (PALS). Never
theless. 1 felt that this topic was a bit too
political for me, and frankly I didn't think
1 had 650 words worth of informed opinion
on the subject.
Therefore I've decided to try out a tech
nique which I've noticed is generally very
popular among editorial writers. This
involves choosing some jssue of the
moment which the media has brought to
public attention and delivering an overly
self-righteous opinion about it while belit
tling the other side. This method often
seems to produce engaging if slightly
obnoxious columns, which really is what
I'm aiming for.
One issue that I haven't heard much
about recently is Y2K. It seems that as we
approach the New Year, rather than
becoming more of an overwhelming con

cern. Y2K has actually become more of a
standing joke. There are two possible
explanations of this. One is that people
have on the whole been assured by rational
evidence that all crucial and semi-crucial
computer software has been repro
grammed to store dates as four digits
rather than two. The other explanation for
this, which I tend to favor, is that people
are fools.
What have we been told? The govern
ment has suggested that people prepare for
a minor natural disaster with a few days of
food. Power companies are making their
employees work over the weekend. And
banks have assured customers that there is
no need to withdraw their money.
The problem is that this is exactly what
these institutions would say regardless of
the circumstances. It is only natural that
the head of a Senate committee examining
Y2K would be very optimistic that this is
not the end of Western civilization as we
know it. The average American actually
has very little informed evidence that the
problem will not be catastrophic. Yet I
think it is a safe bet that most Americans
won't have a significant stock pile of
freeze-dried survival food come Dec. 31st.
Why is this? Because it's too much trou
ble to plan ahead, and most people don't
really believe in the possibility of drastic
changes. In a way, I think it would serve

the public right and be amusing if modern
society actually did collapse.
Well, maybe I wouldn't actually be
amused if civilization ended; it would be
awful. I would only be amused in theory. I
don't have any 10-gallon storage tanks of
food. I don't even have an assault rifle to
protect my property from looting savages
in a post-apocalvptic wasteland. (As a side
note, this is a very rational argument for
gun control that you have perhaps not
heard before. In this situation, authoritari
an leadership may become a necessity, for
better or for worse.)
In general though, it is much easier to
assume that you are safe than to contem
plate the possible scenarios. One thing to
consider as you return to your comfortable
homes this December to celebrate one or
another modernized pagan rite is Stan
ford's official statement about Y2K: "We
believe there is credible evidence about
the potential for significant problems. For
this reason, we take and continue to take
the position that Y2K represents a risk that
must be taken seriously," — makes you
think, doesn't it?

and as a disclaimer would like to note that
he does not believe America is or ever will
be "ready " for authoritarian leadership.
