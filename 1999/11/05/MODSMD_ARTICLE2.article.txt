## Undergrad Senate adopts amendment to Judicial Charter 
### Wenhsin Lee Staff writer 
At last night's meeting, the ASSIJ Un
dergraduate Senate took the first step to
ward giving the University more latitude on
filing charges of alleged student misconduct.
To this end, the Undergraduate Senate
unanimously passed an amendment to the
Judicial Charter. The amendment was pro
posed by the Board of Judicial Affairs.
The amendment is a statute of limitation
that relates specifically to the time period for
filing charges under the charter. Rather than

restricting the time period to within six
months of the alleged misconduct, a clause
was added that stated the charges should be
"filed no more than six months after the al
leged misconduct occurred or should rea
sonably have been discovered."
"It provides the University with greater
freedom to pursue matters that technically
may not be afforded to them under the cur
rent wording," said Dean of Students Marc
Wais.
The senate invited Wais to discuss the
amendment before it voted on the matter.
"From my point of view, the amendment
enhances the University's ability to enforce
the I lonor Code and Fundamental Stan
dard." Wais said.
During discussion, senior Adam Weiss,

an undergraduate senator, noted that "in is
sues of sexual assault and rape where a stu
dent has been vietimized, latitude is needed
in order for justice to be served."
The Graduate Student Council will re
view the amendment next week before it is
passed on to the Faculty Senate and Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper. The amend
ment must pass at all of these levels before it
is approved.
Also at the meeting, the US finalized
plans for a "student voice" forum next Tues
day at 8 p.m. in the Law School, room 190.
The forum will be an opportunity for stu
dents to share their concerns with their rep
resentatives. and for the senators to relay in-

formation about upcoming plans for
the rest of the year.
"The Undergraduate Senate is
ready to listen. I hope students show
up and tell us what is on their minds.
From performance spaces to parking
spaces, there is n lot to talk about."
said I IS ('haii Steven Aronowit/.
The forum is part of an effort by
the ASSU to solicit student input. It
will begin with a short presentation

by the US and will proceed to a stu
dent discussion.
Another effort to solicit student
input is a US / Student Affairs sur
vey on freshman transportation pat
terns. Students may take the surves
next Monday and Tuesday in White
Plaza.
"We are working with the Student
Affairs office to find a solution to the
freshman car policy, lirst we need to
figure out what needs exist and then
we will he working to find solutions."
