New Web site a waste of
funds
Quite frankly, I can't believe that Uni
versity funds are being used to create a
new "F mergency Web site."
I recognize the need to disseminate
information rapidly in an emergency, but a
Web site just does not seem to be the
proper way to go about this. It makes rto
sense to expect students to run to the near
est computer in the middle of an earth
quake to reccive emergency information.
Picture, it you will, the next earthquake
to hit campus. A worried student, not
knowing what to do, quickly rushes to his
or her computer. He or she logs onto the
web page, which thankfully "has minimal
graphics, allowing it to load quickly."
Unfortunately, in the height of the emer
gency, the person on the other end of the
server hasn't quite gotten around to
updating the page yet, perhaps having
more important things to attend to. Our
hero waits by his computer until the power
finally goes out rendering the whole
system useless — and then switches on his
battery-powered radio to catch the emer
gency bulletin.
Phis last item in the scenario appears to
have been considered by the designers of
the system. The man quoted in the article
as an authority on the Web site explains it
is "one of the ways to communicate emer
gency information and not the only one,"
implying that, in case of an actual cmcr

gency in which the power failed, other sys
tems would be used.
My question, then, is why have this sys
tem at all? Why divert money from the
other systems already in place — which
actually stand a chance of being of some
use in an emergency — to fund a seeming
ly worthless program?
I am irate that some amount of the
money provided to the University for my
education is being used in an emergency
system that might not function in an emer
gency.

Stanford should rethink
how it approaches the
Grapes issue
Stanford is putting an undue hardship
on farm workers in regards to policy of
promoting a United Farmworkers Union
(UFW) boycott of table grapes. Assistant
Dean of Students Tommy Woon acknowl
edges that he is an advocate of the UFW
boycott. Thus [we believe] he has gone out
of his way to create hardships for farm
workers who do not support his position
on this issue. We experienced much the
same bias in Professor Luis Fraga's earlier
support of the union's destructive cam
paign.
The Grape Workers and Farmers

Coalition has been invited to participate in
two days of forums at Stanford next week.
This demand on farm workers' time is
excessive and inappropriate. They must
take time away from their jobs and their
families to plead to your campus for the
right of self-determination.
Certainly Stanford should reimburse
farm workers for the cost of traveling to
your campus, their meals and the
overnight stay, for this is a Stanford event,
not one created or requested by farm
workers. Farm workers are not in the
same category of wealth as Stanford or the
UFW, which draws millions upon millions
of dollars each year in charitable gifts.
The UFW quit actively conducting the
boycott several years ago. They are not
present in the grape vineyards at all. In
fact, the UFW had only one contract in
table grapes earlier this year. The workers
voted to decertify the UFW as their union
this summer.
Common sense suggests that it is time
Stanford should stop this practice of
harassing farm workers. Short of that, they
should be paying for the cost of their social
experiment.
Stanford has produced a videotape fea
turing highlights from a forum on this
issue in 1995 incorporating footage from
both the UFW and the grape workers.
Stanford has background information on
its Web site regarding the issue. Both the
UFW and grape workers are available to
respond to telephone calls and written

queries. Is this not enough? We urge you
to immediately cancel the unnecessary
forums.

Admissions video plays an
informative role
The article on Nov. 2, "Kinnally hopes
to up applications: Web video courts
prospective frosh" contains some incor
rect information. The video, streamed on
the Admissions Web site in June, is not
new: it was originally created in 1995. The
purpose of placing it on the Web site is to
inform prospective students. It was not
designed to increase applications. The
Office of Undergraduate Admission is
currently preparing to produce a new
video which will highlight the academic
and extracurricular life of undergraduates.
In conjunction with Admission staff pre
sentations, it will be shown to high school
students around the country. It will also be
available upon request to prospective stu
dents and their families.
