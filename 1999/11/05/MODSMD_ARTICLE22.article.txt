## Evaluating our generation's selflessness 
###

£ "W Then I was your age . . ."
%/%/ Many of us have heard our
▼ ▼ parents utter these words
before. It seems that people over 40 love
dispensing these pearls of wisdom because it
gives them either a) an excuse to reminisce
about their youth or b) a warning that they
are about to reminisce about their youth (so
we can subsequently tune out while they
indulge themselves).
When we were children, such a state
ment was likely to be followed by, "Ice
cream was only a dime!" But as we mature
from childhood into adulthood, these remi
niscences slowly seem to be changing. Our
parents' period of nostalgic reflection are
shifting from that of pre-adolescent youth to
recollections of their college days. For many
among them, those days were the tumul
tuous 19605.
No longer are they giving us lessons on
inflation of basic consumer goods. "Ice
cream was only a dime" has been replaced

by "I was arrested for protesting against
Vietnam" or "I saw some of my best friends
die while fighting in Vietnam." The world
suddenly became colder, harder and more
uninviting.
If 1 had to describe our parents' genera
tion in one word, it would be selflessness.
Many who were drafted willingly risked
their lives in Vietnam simply because they
were asked to. Many of those college stu
dents exempted from the draft and protest
ing against the war risked expulsion and
even chanced being sent to prison simply
because they could not stand by while a
pointless war was being fought. Pacifist or
soldier, everyone from our parents' genera
tion seemed to care more about their ideals
than themselves.
Not surprisingly, comparing college life
today with that of the '60s may leave us with
a residual sense of guilt. "Sure," you might
think, "I'm working hard in school, but who
am I helping besides myself?" Even if we

donate a few hours a week to community
service, are we giving as much of ourselves
as our parents gave at their age?
Why aren't we protesting en masse in
White Plaza while over 24,000 people die
in this world each day because of hunger
or hunger-related causes? Many Stanford
students and faculty protested the contin
ued U.S. economic sanctions in Iraq (and
rightfully so), but did our protests reach
the same level of intensity and campus
wide involvement of student protests from
our parents' generation?
The answer is no. Does it follow then
that our generation is inherently more
selfish than our parents' generation? Once
again, the answer is no.
For our grandparents' generation
(nicknamed "the Greatest Generation"),
the enemy was clear: Adolf Hitler. For
many of our parents the enemy was a little
hazier but it was still there: the U.S. gov
ernment; they had to do everything in

their power to throw a wrench into the
corrupt machine.
But the enemy is not so clear to us. Not
to say that the enemy is not as dangerous;
it's simply not so apparent as it was for
earlier generations. Poverty and starvation
are flourishing throughout the world —
even in the United States. Hunger has
killed more people than Hitler ever did,
yet will it ever unite our country with such
an undivided fervor as the Nazis did dur
ing World War 11? Probably not.
How does one come up with a solution
to the social problems of the world while
studying at Stanford? Many people on
campus are working toward that every
day. Two such examples: East Palo Alto
Tennis and Tutoring (EPATT) and the
Stanford Project on Nutrition (SPOON).
The fever-pitched excitement of the
'60s isn't present in either of those organi
zations, nor should it be. World War II
was won by the Allies, and the Vietnam

war eventually ended (albeit 10,000 young
men too late). Conversely, SPOON will
not end world hunger within 10 years, nor
will EPATT make up for the socioeco
nomic disparity that exists between Stan
ford and the surrounding communities.
But that doesn't make their battles worth
less.
Ice cream is not a dime anymore. Like
wise, very few Stanford students will be
arrested for protesting this year. That
doesn't mean that we don't care. Many
Stanford students have found something
to fight for. Of course, they won't be
immortalized as historical icons in an era
of social change. But they are fighting with
the same enthusiasm as previous genera
tions — just much more quietly so.
