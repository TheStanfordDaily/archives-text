# Ghosh receives 'appreciative response'
## 
### Nadira Hira Contributing writer 
World-renowned author Amitav
Ghosh, after three sessions with
graduate students, undergraduate
students and the community at large,
will still only say that Stanford had "a
very appreciative response" to his
work.
Some students, such as junior
Mamta Ahluwalia.a long-time fan of
the "Shadow Lines" author, would
call that an understatement.
"1 think Amitav Ghosh is one of
the most amazing writers of our
time," she said. "... [so | meeting
Amitav Ghosh was definitely a
memorable moment in my life."
Ghosh, a professor of compara
tive literature at Queens College and
the winner of numerous literary
prizes for his essay and novel writing,
was invited to Stanford as the inau
gural lecturer of the South Asia Ini
tiative's quarterly distinguished
South Asian speaker series.
The South Asia Initiative, a facul
ty group working to increase acade
mic programming on South Asia,
collaborated with several other
sponsors to put on the event.
Ghosh's first engagement at Stan
ford involved lunch with some 20
graduate students in Cultural and
Social Anthropology on Wednes
day.
Lalaie Ameeriar is the first-year
graduate student in ( ultural and So
cial Anthropology who requested
the session with Ghosh. She said she
felt the session would be valuable for
those in the class, Reading Theory
Through Ethnography, a required
course for all first-year students in
her program, especially since the

class syllabus includes some of
Ghosh's writing.
After hearing about each stu
dent's project or area of interest and
offering comments and insight.
(ihosh addressed a number til issues
raised by the students. Scholarly
writing was at the top of the list as stu
dents expressed their consternation
over academia's need for hopelessly
complicated writing.
(ihosh acknowledged these con
cerns and added, "Language is like
the strings of an instrument," he said,
"the simpler and purer the sound, the
more communicative the music."
Ghosh also spoke on the increas
ing emphasis on theory in the mod
ern academy, the past and future of
South Asians outside India and tak
ing advantage of graduate school.
"As a graduate student... you're
creating a huge amount of capital on
which you'll live for the next 20 to 30
years," he said.
" That's all that erudition is." he
continued, referring to the close
study of one topic, "a very bright
light shone on a very small space....
You'll never have live years to do
this again in your lives."
March Brink, also a first-year
graduate student in Cultural and So
cial Anthropology, said she appreci
ated Ghosh's frankness, "lie spoke
to a lot of issues I hoped he would. - '
Wednesday evening, for his major
lecture, Ghosh spoke to more than
100 people in Annenberg Auditori
um.
Institute for International Studies
Consulting Prof. Rafiq Dossani wel
comed the crowd and spoke briefly
on the goals of the South Asia Initia
tive. Cultural and Social Anthropol
ogy Assoc. Prof. Akhil Gupta then

introduced Ghosh as a long-time
friend and. by training, a fellow social
anthropologist.
For his talk. Ghosh read his essay,
" The March of the Novel Through
History: The Testimony of My
Grandfather's Bookcase." the win
ner of the 1999 Pushcart Prize, and
then answered an array of questions
from an audience of students, profes
sors and community members from
all over the Bay Area.
The majority of questions related
to (ihosh's writing. Asked to discuss
his literary influences, he said. "To
separate them into individual influ
ences would be very hard," but he
stressed the variety of his influences,
citing Maxim Gorky, John Stein
beck, H.G. Wells and Aldous Hux
ley, among many others.
(ihosh also mentioned the impact
of his native Bengali culture on his
life and work. "The one thing that I
value most about Bengali literature
is a certain way of telling a story," he
said.
" To this day, when I'm having
trouble writing, I just close my eyes,
put my hand to my ear, and 1 listen
for that sound. There's something
about that tone that I have not found
in literature of any other place,"
(ihosh continued.
Other topics, such as Ghosh's de
cision to leave anthropology and be
come a writer, were also covered. "I
think comparative literature is where
I belong best." he said.
"Now that I'm in comparative lit
erature. I consider myself an honest
man ... My life never fit into any of
the categories of the academy."
Vi jav Mvneni. a senior and one of
the cultural ci>mmittee chairs of San
skriti. "Stanford's South Asian stu

dent organization, said. "[This] lec
ture was perhaps one of the most in
teresting I've ever heard at Stanford,
especially considering I am neither
an English major nor an anthropolo
gy major."
Gupta said he was pleased with
the outcome of the event."The audi
ence reaction was very, very positive.
... I think it really served [some] of
the South Asia Initiative's major
goals." he said.
Ghosh concluded his speaking
tour of Stanford with a lecture in
Gupta and History Prof. Mark Man
call's "Modern India" class Thursday
morning. In this 5()-minute question
and-answer session. Ghosh spoke on
a number of topics, including his per
ception of India as a political entity
and related issues. He expressed his
views on Partition, the division of the
Indian subcontinent into India and
Pakistan; the current tension be
tween India and Pakistan; and vio
lence itself.
"A large part of the violence we
see around the world ... is first imag
ined by writers considering issues of
nationhood and nationhood through
war and violence," he said. "So as a
novelist I think you have a responsi
bility to make sure you're not rein
forcing that violence in your writ
ing."
Mancall, like the graduate stu
dents, said he valued Ghosh's forth
rightness.
"He's a real old-fashioned intel
lectual and, as such, speaks from a
cast of mind which is extraordinarily
interesting and not concerned with
enthusiasms of the moment," he
said. "He reminds us of the value of
literature as a means for understand
ing the human condition."
