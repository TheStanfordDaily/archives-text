## Pull Up a Leather Couch & cram for midterms The
						Bender Room 
### Sarah Heim Contributing writer 
Imagine a study spot where the
distractions of your roommate's
latest crisis or the cute hiker that
just cruised by don't exist.
Now imagine the same spot
without uniform cubicles, clunky
furniture or psychedelic screen
savers.
If you can imagine all those
things, you're probably thinking of
the recently renovated Albert M.
Bender Room in the Bing Wing of
Green Library.-
Tucked away on the fifth floor,
down a stark hallway and behind a
plain door, lies the little-known
gem.
"Not a lot of people know about
it," said senior Nicole Camalich.
But those who know are
hooked.
"People like it up here because
it's more like a living room than a
library," said sophomore Will
Crump.
"It's not as intense as studying in
cubicles."
Crump and his friend, senior
Kara Dow, have been coming to
the sunny spot to study about twice
a week since the room re-opened.
"It's the most beautiful place to
read," said second-year Religious
Studies graduate student Kathleen
Tierney.
"I got curious because I kept
seeing signs that it was closed,"
Tierney said. "So I decided to come
up when it re-opened."
The Bender Room, which suf
fered extensive damage during the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, re
opened on Oct. 12.
The room was named in the late
1930s for Albert M. Bender, a San
Francisco bibliophile whose phil
anthropy benefited the Stanford
rare-book collections.
According to a marble plaque in

the corner, the Bender Room is
also known as the Gentlepersons'
Reading Room.
Students have also discovered
the room through word of mouth.
"Some friends told me about the
room and how beautiful it was. I
came up here one day and fell in
love with it," Camalich said.
The use of orange and brown
hues in the large rectangular room
was not accidental.
The first day Camalich ventured
up to the room, she ran into a li
brary staff member who gave her a
tour, explaining that the colors
were chosen to pull the outside in.
"When the interior designer was
selected and started working with
us on the library, he decided that he

was going to take his inspiration
from the sandstone and tile of the
campus color scheme." Deputy
University Librarian Karen Nagy
said.
The majestic view of red
rooftops and palm trees in the
Quad can be seen from almost any
of the couches, armchairs or desks.
"You can always take a break
and look outside at the view," Ca
malich said. "And I like the leather
couches."
The only noises in the serene
room come from rustling papers
and jingling keys, or the occasional
opening and shutting of the door.
" The room was created to in
spire quiet reading," Nagv said.
Students can also hook up to the

Internet through ethernet ports at
desks on the perimeter of the room.
Looking up from their books,
students see fresh flower bouquets
on tables and gentle light streaming
through the crisp white shades of
elegant rod-iron lamps.
There is a simple coat rack in the
corner.
The eclectic collection of books
lining the shelves of the Bender
Room was made available by a
generous contribution from the
Stanford Bookstore.
The books, which can he
checked out. include political titles,
art hooks and classic novels.
The room also houses a sam
