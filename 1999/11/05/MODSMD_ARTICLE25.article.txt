# Help! I married a Stanford student...
## Campus Couples 
### Megan Lindow David Wolman 
Have you ever wished you could
take full advantage of the libraries,
lectures and sports facilities offered
by a world-class university, without
having to pay tuition or slave over
homework?
Many partners of Stanford stu
dents are in exactly that position.
"It's just wonderful. I am enjoy
ing her M.A. more than I enjoyed
doing mine!" said Unmesu Rathi,
whose wife, Preeti, is a master's stu
dent in Computer Science.
According to Chris Griffith, as
sociate dean of students for the
Graduate Life Office, there are 240
couples and 350 families with chil
dren living on campus. All families
and couples live in Escondido Vil
lage.
In 1990 the University extended
spousal services and benefits to do
mestic partners. As defined in the
Stanford Bulletin, a domestic part
nership is "an established long-term
partnership with an exclusive mutu
al commitment in which the part
ners share the necessities of life and
ongoing responsibility for their com
mon welfare."
The Bechtel International Cen
ter Web site advises couples that
while "the scholar will be facing aca
demic and research challenges, each
spouse or partner will be facing a
somewhat different, but also impor
tant, challenge in building and ad
justing to a new life here."
Bechtel provides various re
sources for families and spouses.
The center offers a quarterly calen
dar of events, including cooking and
language classes, walking tours and
holiday outings.
For $J5 spouses and domestic
partners can get a courtesy card that
allows access to libraries, sports fa
cilities, concerts and lectures. They

also have the option to join the stu
dent health care program at Cowell
Health Center.
But the adjustment to campus
life is not so smooth for everyone.
Gavin Werner, a spouse from South
Africa, felt a bit awkward during the
first few weeks, but that feeling
eventually faded.
Chawadee Nualkhair, a master's
student in communication, is some
times concerned about her husband,
Kawin Nualkhair, who is a chemical
engineer and a certified chef. He
said he is looking for a job and
watching too many cartoons, includ
ing — gasp — Pokemon.
"Sometimes I worry that [my
husband] is really bored," she said.
Unlike many couples who take
advantage of cheaper rents in Es
condido Village, the Nualkhairs
chose to live off campus in Menlo
Park, in order to keep away from the
stressful school atmosphere.
Yet the distance from campus
can cause isolation. Stanford is try
ing to reach out to couples living off
campus,, "but it's a big challenge,"
said Thom Massey, assistant dean of
student affairs for the Graduate Life
Office.
Another problem for partners
such as Kawin Nualkhair and Gavin
Werner is that their scholarly halves
are often very busy. As a result, non
student spouses can feel a bit lonely
with nothing to do while their part
ners frantically write papers and
conduct late-night lab experiments.
Rathi admits that he would prob
ably get bored if he did not have a
full-time job as a software engineer
in Cupertino. There are only so
many household chores to be done.
Kawin Nualkhair says it is diffi
cult to find a job in the field because
he came to Stanford without any
contacts. "Plus. 112 don't want to get
into a job and then only have one year
to do it,"he said.
Gavin Werner feels the same way.
I le works at home for a Web page de
sign firm, but agrees that without
work, things would be different.
"If I was working a nine-to-five
job, it would be more difficult adjust
ing to my wife's erratic schedule.Now
1 just work when she studies," he said.
The job issue is compounded for
ome international spouses who
uon't have visas to work in the Unit
ed States, Griffith said. She pointed
out that several international stu
dents left careers back at home and
have put their professional plans on
hold while their other halves pursue a
degree.
Getting to know people can also
be tough. "I would like to meet some
people besides her friends," Rathi

said.
Many spouses said they were dis
appointed that most social functions
were concentrated in the first few
weeks of school. They were too busy
moving in and getting settled to at
tend the gatherings.
But the University does offer
events and activities that make the
spouse's experience more enjoyable.
Griffith pointed out that partners can
get involved in campus life by becom
ing Community Associates. The
group plans regular social gatherings
such as kayaking trips and outings to
the symphony.
The goal of the CA program is to
"create ongoing opportunities to get
people to know their neighbors, get
connected and feel like they have a
support system here," Griffith said.
"It's a group that can tend to be in
visible, but it's always amazing to see
the wealth of experience and creativ
ity that they bring to the institution,"
Griffith said.
