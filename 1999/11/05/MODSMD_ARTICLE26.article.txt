# Searching for alien life from the comfort of your dorm room

What looks like your roommate's quirky screensaver could actually be
part of a worldwide computing network to find alien life-forms.
The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence at home (SETl@home)
project uses hundreds of thousands of Internet-connected PCs to search
for extraterrestrial intelligence. Using Ihe free software off the
SETl@home Web page, computer owners can download and analyze data
from the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico. The program can run as
a colorfully complicated screensaver. crunching numbers only when the
computer is not in use, or it can run in the background of the PC at all
times.
"SETl@home is the first opportunity in history to participate in a real,
significant science experiment, to have the experiment itself going on in
your dorm room, or your den," said David Anderson, director of the

SETl@home project based at DC-Berkeley. "It's had a huge effect in ed
ucating the general public in what SET I is as a scientific field in contrast to
sensationalistic stuff.... This is not IJFO hunting."

SETl@home is part of a larger project called SERENDIP. A
SERENDIP antenna on the Arecibo telescope scans the sky for data and
the individual users of the SETl@home software download a 300-kilobyte
chunk of that SERENDIP data for analysis. Each PC sends the results of
the analysis hack to the SERENDIP team for use in the search of ex
traterrestrial signals.
Already, there exist eight Stanford-affiliated teams, including groups
from the Law and Business Schools. Many others on campus participating
in SETl@honie have joined in the effort hut have not officially posted
their names to the teams on the Web. One group, listed as the general
Stanford group, has a total of 58 Stanford students, faculty and staff. Their
computers have spent a total of 10.79 years in Central Processing Unit
time since the project began in May. Anderson plans to continue the pro-
