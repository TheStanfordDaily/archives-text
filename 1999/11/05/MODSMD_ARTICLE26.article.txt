# Searching for alien life from the comfort of your dorm room
##

What looks like your roommate's quirky screensaver could actually be
part of a worldwide computing network to find alien life-forms.
The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence at home (SETl@home)
project uses hundreds of thousands of Internet-connected PCs to search
for extraterrestrial intelligence. Using Ihe free software off the
SETl@home Web page, computer owners can download and analyze data
from the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico. The program can run as
a colorfully complicated screensaver. crunching numbers only when the
computer is not in use, or it can run in the background of the PC at all
times.
"SETl@home is the first opportunity in history to participate in a real,
significant science experiment, to have the experiment itself going on in
your dorm room, or your den," said David Anderson, director of the

SETl@home project based at DC-Berkeley. "It's had a huge effect in ed
ucating the general public in what SET I is as a scientific field in contrast to
sensationalistic stuff.... This is not IJFO hunting."

SETl@home is part of a larger project called SERENDIP. A
SERENDIP antenna on the Arecibo telescope scans the sky for data and
the individual users of the SETl@home software download a 300-kilobyte
chunk of that SERENDIP data for analysis. Each PC sends the results of
the analysis hack to the SERENDIP team for use in the search of ex
traterrestrial signals.
Already, there exist eight Stanford-affiliated teams, including groups
from the Law and Business Schools. Many others on campus participating
in SETl@honie have joined in the effort hut have not officially posted
their names to the teams on the Web. One group, listed as the general
Stanford group, has a total of 58 Stanford students, faculty and staff. Their
computers have spent a total of 10.79 years in Central Processing Unit
time since the project began in May. Anderson plans to continue the pro-


Alexandra Huddleston â€” Daily
ject for two years, which is long
enough for the telescope to scan
the sky three times.
Stanford alumna Jennifer God
win is on a campaign to increase the
number of Stanford participants.
Currently, Stanford is far behind in
an unofficial ranking of universities
participating in SETl@home.
"We're way out of the top 100,
and it's pathetic considering we're
this huge premier university in the
middle of Silicon Valley," Godwin
said. "The more computers we add,
the more data we'll crunch, and the
higher our ranking will go."
Aside from the fun, competitive
aspect of SETl@home and the ex
citing possibility of detecting civi
lizations beyond earth, the project
has large scientific and technologi
cal implications.

"SETl@home is demonstrating
the viability of using home PCs
connected via the Internet as a
giant supercomputer," Anderson
said.
The project is able to accom
plish a data-processing task that
would normally cost $50 million
with a small budget of just a couple
hundred thousand dollars.
Such time- and cost-efficient re
sults have shown why there is a
trend toward using computer pro
gramming for experimentation in
all areas of science.
"I'm just really excited by the
idea of distributed computing as a
sort of nerdy and entertaining ef
fort to be part of something much
bigger than yourself," Godwin
said.
Thanks to students from the el
ementary to university levels, gov
ernment agencies and the business
es that privately fund the project,
SETl@home has continued to

grow.
Sophomore Bill Falsey decided
to join last year, when the idea was
proposed to his draw group in the
dorm.
"It's completely altruistic, but if
they ever do find a signal, then I'm
sure I'll hear about it, and they'll
say: 'We got it from this comput
er,'" Falsey said.
Senior Mike Mettler said he has
run the program since January be
cause it is algorithmically interest
ing.
Like Falsey, he recognizes the
chances for finding an extraterres
trial signal on his computer is low,
but he remains hopeful.
"We have all this expensive pro
cessing power at our fingertips and
quick ethernet access, so it's a
shame not to use it for something,"
Mettler said. "Besides, the poten
tial payoffs are huge We could
redefine tiie role of mankind in the
universe."
