# Industrious Paté-Cornell engineers groundbreaking career
## 
### Heather Wax Contributing writer 
Prof. Elisabeth Pate-
Cornell is used to finding
herself in high places. Iron
ically, all the time she's
spent in the company of
rocketmen and high- flyers

may be what keeps the first female head of Stan
ford's Industrial Engineering and Engineering
Management Department grounded.
"I worked in the space systems and craft pro
gram at NASA. I was part of the Air Force Science
Advisory Board to make sure their systems were
reliable and integrated so they don't fail," said
Pat6-Comell.
While she was "very well received" in these set
tings, she said she knows that it hasn't been as easy
for female engineering professors at Stanford to
move up the ranks.
"I probably should not have been the first
woman to head the department. It feels very nice,
and I'm grateful, but there arc women who came
before me who could have received it," she said.
"There were women before who would and
could have been encouraged but were not because
it was not thought of as an appropriate feminine
field," she said.
said she thinks it takes time for
things to change.
"Things take time — time for f mentalities to
change, time for women to grow in the field of en
gineering. I'm just at the front of a new way, which
is the baby-boomers," she said.
Patd-Cornell has always set her own path. When
she finished high school, she was interested in both
history and science. She decided to specialize in the

latter, rationalizing that she could always enjoy
music, books and poetry on her own.
She got a bachelor's degree in mathematics and
physics at Marseilles in France and then an engi
neering degree in computer science from Greno
ble. She went on to earn a master's in operations re
search and a doctorate in engineering economic
systems, both at Stanford.
"I have the feeling I know this place well. When
you're a student you get into so many corners,"
Pate-Cornell said.
She spent three years teaching at Mi l before
coming back to Stanford as a professor in 19K1 and
having "two babies while the tenure clock was tick
ing."
As the chair of the Industrial Engineering and
Engineering Management Department since IW7,
and with her husband also working as a research
professor in civil engineering on-campus, things
have gotten really busy in the Cornell house. While
she admits that it has been less difficult for her be
cause of at-home help. Pate-Cornell is also quick to
add that she and her husband "share things very
much."
"He's more in touch with the kids' schedules,
and I'm more in touch with what's in the fridge. But
we cook dinner together and that's when we talk
abou( what happened during the day," Pate-Cor
nell said.
She's now working about 12-hour shifts — from
7 a.m. to 7 p.m. — and that's not including the
amount of reading she does after supper. And
while Patd-Cornell says the pace has gotten a lot
faster and she doesn't know how her husband feels
about it, he makes it clear that he has "no con
cerns."
"She has always been extremely good at balanc
ing work and family. We have ups and downs

where we're more focused on one or the other and
this is one time where she's made a commitment to
seriously do something," he said. "But it's a capa
bility she has and I think it helps Stanford a lot. so
I'm glad she's doing it."
Although Pate-Cornell herself "really enjoys
it,"it would not be surprising if the job of being
chair of the department sometimes feels like the
work of three people. That's because in some ways
it is.
By the beginning of 2(KK), she's going to find her
self the head of a new department merging Indus
trial Engineering and Engineering Management
with Operations Research and Engineering Eco
nomic Systems — the areas in which Pate-Cornell
got her master's and doctorate, respectively.
"There are many problems that have to be re
solved very quickly, so it's long hours," she said of
the hard work it's taking to get the program ready,
especially since the department is planning to offer
new degrees by September.
But Pate-Cornell has still managed to find space
on her to-do list for her research programs and doc
toral students.
"She's always had it set up that Ph.D. students
come together once a week with her to discuss re
search and any other problems," said graduate stu
dent Mark Sachon, who has worked with Pate-Cor
nell for five years.
And if it seems right now that the professor is
doing almost everything from here to the moon
while trying to get the new department off the
ground, Sachon isn't worried.
"Once she was elected to NAE, was working
with the Army and Air Force, and then went on to
chair of the department, her time schedule got
pushed together. So, she's always doing things," he
said
