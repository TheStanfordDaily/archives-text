### Meghan O'Connor Staff writer 
With the NCAA tournament
nipping at its heels and hopes of a
return visit to the national champi
onship looming in the back of their
minds, the men of the Stanford
soccer team (11-3-2) realize the im
portance of this weekend's final
two games.

MEW'S SOCCER
■ Tomorrow: No. 17Stanford (11 -3-
2) vs. DC-Santa Barbara (11-5) at
the Cal Adidas Legacy Classic.
■ Sunday: Stanford vs. No. 6 St.
Louis (14-2-1) at the Cal Adidas
Legacy Classic.

Combined with the team's sec
ond-place finish in the Mountain
Division of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (5-1-1). positive
results from this weekend's games
against Santa Barbara and No. 6
St. Louis should help propel the
Cardinal into postseason play as
NCAA tournament bids will be
announced on Nov. 12.
So far the Cardinal has respond
ed well to its tough end-of-the-sea
son schedule, downing both then-
No. 19 California (11-4-2) and No.
9 Santa Clara (12-3-1) with intense
1-0 victories earlier this week.
Head coach Bobby Clark hopes his
team can maintain such intensity

as it travels to Berkeley to play in
the Cal Adidas Legacy Classic.
"(This weekend) will be two
very difficult games," head coach
Hobby Clark said. "This last week
we've been trying to get everything
as right as we can. We have four
very difficult opponents, right now
we're at halftime and we're on
top."
In order to stay on top, the Car
dinal's toughest test will be over
coming the force of the St. Louis
Billikens (14-2-1) on Sunday. This
season, the Billikens, who share
the Conference USA title with Al
a b a m a - B i r m i n g h a m. have
achieved something the Cardinal
desperately sought last season— a
victory over Indiana.
Last season, the Hoosiers were
all that stood in the way of Stan
lord's path to the championship, as
they defeated Stanford in the
championship match 3-1. The Bil
likens downed the No. 5 Hoosiers
this year 3-2 in exhibition and
again 1-0 in overtime at the Indi
ana Adidas Classic.
Leading the Billiken charge is
senior forward Jason Minis, who
boasts 21 points and was recently
named Conference tJSA offensive
player of the week. Just behind
Minis is fellow senior forward Jeff
DiMaria with 17 points.
