The No. 2 Cardinal (19-2, 11-1 Pa

Stanford will he dueling it out

against the Bruins for the lead in the
Pac-10 race. The Cardinal squad
suffered its sole Pac-10 loss thus far
this year to the Bruins. UCLA
emerged victorious in four games
over Stanford in their last matchup,
which took place Oct. 7 in Los An

Cardinal head coach Don Shaw
said that despite the Bruins' higher
ranking in the national polls, they
are not a squad to be taken lightly.

"I believe they are one of the top
two or three teams in the nation.
Whichever team plays its hardest
and most intelligent volleyball each
point will win Friday's match,"
Shaw said.
UCLA currently boasts a 19-
match win streak, but lost to Hawaii
early on in the season. The Cardinal
recently defeated Hawaii to move
ahead of the Wahine in the national
polls.

Last weekend sophomore middle blocker Tara Conrad and the Cardinal were able to shoot down the
Oregon Ducks. This weekend Stanford heads down to L.A. to avenge an early season defeat against
UCLA.
straight home games against UCLA.
As coach Shaw explained, "A
positive reaction from the home
crowd after every successful play al
ways adds to the positive momen
tum of our team."
Stanford needs freshman outside
hitter Logan Tom to play up to the
high standards she has rapidly creat
ed for herself this year. Tom is cur
rently in the race for both AVCA
National Freshman of the Year and
All-America awards. Tom has col
lected over 20 kills a game four times
this season.
Stanford and UCLA line up
head-to-head at No. 1 and No. 2, re
spectively, in both attack percentage
and blocks in the Pac-10 record
books. Cardinal setter Lindsay Ka
gawa, who averages 13.16 assists
per-game, and Bruin setter Erika
Selsor, whose 13.69 average ranks
her eighth in the nation, will do bat
tle in leading both teams' offensive
attacks.
UCLA will look to sophomore
outside hitter Kristen Porter to put

the ball on the floor on the Stanford
side of the net. Porter reached the
1,000-career kill mark in her 50th
game last Saturday, the second
fastest ascension to the 1,000-kill
plateau in NCAA history.
While UCLA should provide the
stronger test of the weekend, USC,
currently third in the Pac-10, is cer
tainly no pushover either.
"It's always hard to play a big
match and then turn around and
have another though team waiting,"
said Shaw.
The USC team is known for its
strong attack force, led by junior
outside hitter Antoinette Polk who
averages 3.88 kills-per-game.
As an end-all, the Pac-10 results
will not directly affect postseason
tournament play. The NCAA tour
nament rankings are entirely based
on a separate scale where a team's
win-loss record, strength of schedule
and opponents strength of schedule
are all taken into account.
However, Stanford women's vol
leyball prides itself on its Pac-10 #
dominance throughout the past
decade, and looks to ensure that this
traditional continues with wins over
UCLA and USC this weekend.
