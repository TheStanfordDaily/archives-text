# Courts considering if requirements discriminate
## NCAA appeal still pending 
### Megan Knize 
It sounds fair enough: you're a high
school athlete with talent and brains.
You've practiced long hours on the court
and studied hard in school. And you want
to play sports in college with a full scholar
ship. But there's one problem: your SAT
scores aren't high enough to meet NCAA
eligibility requirements.
Currently, under the NCAA's Proposi
tion 16. athletes must have at least a 2.5
GPA and a combined SAT score of 820.
However, many critics believe that the
SAT exam discriminates against African-
American athletes — and they blame Prop.
16 for barring them from participating in
college sports. In fact, the NCAA is recov

ering from its most recent match with op
ponents of Prop 16.
Last month, a pane! of three district
court judges in Philadelphia held that the
NCAA eligibility requirements for SAT
scores and CiPA do not discriminate
against African-American athletes. The
decision came after NCAA lawyers ap
pealed an earlier verdict where judges
ruled that Proposition I6's test-score re
quirements discriminate against black stu
dents. An appeals-court panel will render a
final decision in three months.
"The NCAA's current rule is opera
tional, just as it was before initial eligibility
rules were struck down in court." said Jane
Jankowski.an NCAA spokesperson. After
the panel presents its verdict, either side

may appeal the decision to the full appeals
court or to the Supreme Court.
"The intent of the eligibility require
ments is to raise academic standards," said
Susan Burk. director of student services at
the Stanford Athletic Department. "But
the people we recruit go through the regu
lar admissions process. No one here is any
where near that end."
Burk also said that the only problem she
foresees is if the appeals-court panel rules
against the NCAA, all eiigibility standards
may be dropped for college athletes.
"Other colleges could take advantage of
this decision by having more qualified play
ers | with lower scores] and this would make
an impact on the teams we're com
peting against," Burk said.
An April 9 article in the Chroni
cle of Higher Education claims that
since 1986. the NCAA has "steadily
toughened academic requirements
... in an attempt to rid college sports
of its image as a haven for dumb

jocks."
Burk maintains that regardless of
what happens in Philadelphia, the
Stanford Athletic Department will
always work on the side ol higher ed
ucation. despite the fact that the
tools which measure academic stan
dards may be controversial.
"We just need to fix those tools,"
Burk explained. "We believe higher
academic goals should be main
tained."
