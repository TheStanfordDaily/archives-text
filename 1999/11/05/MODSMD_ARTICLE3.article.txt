# Courts considering if requirements discriminate
## NCAA appeal still pending 
### Megan Knize 
It sounds fair enough: you're a high
school athlete with talent and brains.
You've practiced long hours on the court
and studied hard in school. And you want
to play sports in college with a full scholar

Burk also said that the only problem she
foresees is if the appeals-court panel rules
against the NCAA, all eiigibility standards
may be dropped for college athletes.
"Other colleges could take advantage of
this decision by having more qualified play
