# Men's hoops takes Action in 90-77 win
## 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
After falling behind by as many
as seven points in the first half, Stan
lord picked up the tempo and ran by
Athletes in Action 90-77 last night
in the Cardinal's final preseason ex
hibition.
Five players scored in double fig
ures for Stanford in a much tighter,
more competitive game than the
Cardinal saw Sunday in its blowout
of Marathon Oil.
"That was good for us," said
Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "We have a long way to go.
It's nothing like it's going to be next
Thursday [against Duke in New
York City], but it gave us a chance
to play a lot of people and get them
experience in front of a crowd."
It was the newcomers to the
Stanford team who seemed to give
the Cardinal, and fans hungry for
highlight-reel material, the biggest
boost in the second half as Stanford
displayed a more athletic, fast
paced team.
Freshman Julius Barnes scored
only two points in the game, but
those came on an in-your-face dunk
that the 6-foot, I-inch guard threw
down with his off hand to put the
fans and the bench in a frenzy. On
an ensuing possession, freshman
Casey Jacobsen drove down the
same baseline and also stuffed it in
amongst a crowd.
"(The freshman] may change
how we play our game." said red
shirt freshman center Jason Collins.
"We're probably going to try to
push it a little more. It makes it real
ly fun to play and gets everyone out

of their seat%"
Jacobseiv whoTcbounded from
a disappointing l-for-8 shooting
performance Sunday to score 13
points last night, said the team's
more aggressive style helped him to
get back into the game.
"I think we need to run a lot
more," he said. "When we get out
on the break and spread the ball to
our wings, we are hard to stop. And.
it helps guys who are struggling with
their shots to get back into the
How."
Jacobsen, who pulled down
seven rebounds from the small for
ward position, struggled with his
shooting again in the first half but
managed to contribute with his de
fense and hustle.

"I'm not just a three-point shoot
er." he said. "I still have a lot more
to offer to the team. I play hard. I
play tough, I play tight defense."
Freshmen Curtis Borchardt
played a strong 11 minutes after sit
ting out all of Sunday's game, but
two other freshman frontcourt
players — Justin Davis and Joe Kir
chofer — sat out. Davis, and possi

"In high school I was taller than
everybody, but here I'm an under

aggressive and athletic play have
drawn comparisons to senior Mark

"I want to take the year to im

While 12 players saw action, with
11 receiving more than 10 minutes
of time, Montgomery said the rota
tions will probably be a little tighter
as the team moves into games that
really count.
"The point will be to get the best
combination of players on the
floor," he said. "We have to keep
everyone rested and fresh, but we
won't put people in just to get them

in like we did tonight."
However, Montgomery did say,
given Madsen's 31 minutes of ac
tion, he would like to get more time
from Jason Collins, who has missed
the majority of the last two seasons
with injuries to his knee and wrist.
Jason Collins scored seven points
and brought down seven rebounds
in only 12 minutes of play on his
sometimes ailing knees.
Junior point guard Mike Mc-
Donald, who has been struggling
with a more recent ankle injury,
played a strong 19 minutes last night
after seeing only 12 minutes Sun
day. McDonald moved quickly and
had no qualms about slashing to
ward the basket last night, scoring
six points while tallying three assists
and three steals.
