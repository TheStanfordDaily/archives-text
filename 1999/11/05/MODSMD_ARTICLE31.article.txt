## 
### Erin Bouchier Staff writer 
The No. I Stanford men's water polo team
faces one of its toughest tests this weekend as the
squad travels to Southern California to take on
co-No. I UCLA and No. 8 UC-Santa Barbara.
The marquee matchup between the Cardinal
and the Bruins is "the game of the year," ac
cording to Stanford head coach Dante Detta
manti.
This game promises to figure significantly in
the national title race. At the end of the season,
three weeks from now, the team with the best
overall record earns an automatic bid to the
four-team NCAA Tournament. Currently Stan

ford (16-2, 5-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) and UCLA (15-2, 7-0), each with only two
losses, boast the best overall records in the coun
try.

■ Tomorrow: No. 1 Stanford (16-2, 5-1 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) at No. 1 UCLA (15-2,7-
0)
■ Sunday: Stanford at No. 8 UC-Santa Barbara (y
-1). 2-3).

Consequently, for the Cardinal, "a win here
would go a long way towards giving us a super
chance of getting to the NCAA Tournament,"

Dettamanti said.
Saturday's game will mark the third meeting
between the Bruins and the Cardinal this season.
The first game, in the semifinals of September's
SoCal Tournament, was a 9-7 victory for the
Cardinal that featured two key goals by redshirt
sophomore Mark Arnott. In the second
matchup, a league game at deGuerre pool,
UCLA exacted revenge, winning 6-5 on a goal
by junior Sean Kern in the final 22 seconds.
To win on Saturday, Stanford will have to
focus on stopping the Bruins' counterattack, the
best in the country.
The Cardinal defense will also need to con-
cent rate oil lour key UCLA play
ers. senior Mall Armato and ju
niors Brian Brown. Adam Wright
and Kern. Armato and Brown are

deadly outside shooters, while
Wright is a skilled driver. Kern, one
of the top holemen in the country,
may be the deadliest of all four with

27 goals on the season.
Offensively, the Cardinal will
try to "take some of their smaller
guys into the hole to exploit mis
matches," Dettamanti said.
The Stanford shooters will face
a new Bruins' goalie. Parsa Bon
derson, who played in the squads'
two previous meetings, is out for
the season. 1 lis replacement is red
shirt freshman Eric Meadows.
While he's only played in five
games, "he is playing very well,"
Dettamanti said.
After facing UCLA, the Cardi
nal takes on UC-Santa Barbara (9-
2-3) on Sunday in a league game.
The Gauchos and the Cardinal
have not met yet this season. While
Santa Barbara remains a bit of an
enigma for Stanford, the Cardinal
knows that "like Pepperdine [last
weekend], they'll come out
strong," Dettamanti said, "and wc
need to be ready for that".
While the Gauchos have been
very erratic this season, they have
achieved some upsets. They are
"especially tough in their home
pool because it's shallow in one
end. They're used to it, and we're
not." Dettamanti said.
With only four weeks until the
national-tournament, Stanford will
do its best to keep a strangle hold
on the No. 1 ranking and domi
nance in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation.
