The No. I Stanford men's water polo team
faces one of its toughest tests this weekend as the
squad travels to Southern California to take on
co-No. I UCLA and No. 8 UC-Santa Barbara.
The marquee matchup between the Cardinal
and the Bruins is "the game of the year," ac
cording to Stanford head coach Dante Detta

This game promises to figure significantly in
the national title race. At the end of the season,
three weeks from now, the team with the best
overall record earns an automatic bid to the
four-team NCAA Tournament. Currently Stan

tion) and UCLA (15-2, 7-0), each with only two
losses, boast the best overall records in the coun
try.

by junior Sean Kern in the final 22 seconds.
To win on Saturday, Stanford will have to
focus on stopping the Bruins' counterattack, the
best in the country.
The Cardinal defense will also need to con-
