In women's soccer, the tangible
measure of success is a team's perfor
mance in postseason play. The regu
lar season matters, but the postsea
son is what counts.

WOMEN'S SOCCER
■ Today: No. 7 Stanford (13-4, 6-1
Pacific 10 Conference) vs. Washing
ton (8-7-1, 5-1-1), 7:30 p.m.. New
Maloney Field.
■ Sunday: Stanford vs. Washington
State (7-10-0, 1-6), 12 p.m.. New
Maloney Field.

Win or lose, it is likely that this No.
7 C ardinal squad (13-4,6-1 Pacific 10
Conference) will make an appear
ance in the NCAA tournament.
However, as the current conference
leader, two wins this weekend would
secure the Pacific 10 Conference title
for the team, ensure a bye in the first
round of the NCAA tournament and
give the team home-field in its first
tournament game.
This weekend Stanford hosts
Washington (8-7-1,5-1-1) and Wash
ington State (7-10-0, 1-6) in its final
games before the NCAA Tourna

ment.
"Winning the conference is key,"
said senior co-captain Jennifer
O'Sullivan. "It affects our postseason
position by guaranteeing us a spot in
the top 16 [teams in the country] and
exempting us from the first round in
the tournament. It also gives us confi
dence in knowing that we can consis
tently beat teams that are the caliber
of Pac-10 teams."
How the Cardinal fares against
the Washington teams is also viewed
as an indication of the Stanford's
strength entering tournament play.
"This weekend is important for a
number of reasons," Swanson said.
"First, it is important in terms of the
conference championship, which has
been a goal of ours since the spring.
Both games will also give us tourna
ment-type intensity."
Stanford will be facing tourna
ment-level competition, preparing
the Cardinal for the intensity of tour
nament play. Washington and Wash
ington State will both prove worthy
opponents, and the Huskies will have
the added incentive of playing for a
chance at the Pac-I() title.
"There is no reason for us to as
sume that we will beat these teams
and take the title," O'Sullivan said.
"UW is going to he playing particu
larly hard since they still have a

chance to win the conference. Nei
ther team is going to be an easy win."
Friday's game against Washing
ton. which will he televised on Fox
Sports, will he particularly intense. Its
record puts the team within striking
distance of the conference title. By
defeating Stanford and California, its

other opponent in the Bay Area this
weekend, the Huskies could realisti
cally walk away with the title and as
sure themselves an automatic bid to
the tournament. The I luskics are cur
rently unranked and a Pac-10 cham
pionship may be their only way into
the tournament pool of 48 teams.


Freshman defender Allyson Marquand takes on two USC players all alone, a feat that will be difficult to
repeat this weekend against the Washington Huskies, a team also in the hunt for the Pacific 10 Confer
ence title.
