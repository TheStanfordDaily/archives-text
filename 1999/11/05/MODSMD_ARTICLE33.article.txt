competes at the Golf World / Pal
metto Dunes Invitational.

After winning the Pacific 10
Conference championships in im
pressive fashion and tallying an
eighth-place finish at the NCAA
championships, Stanford looks to
build on a solid core of veterans as
well as an infusion of freshman tal
ent this season.
Notables returnees include se

nior Jac Jean Roc, All-American
junior Stephanie Keever. currently
ranked 11th in the nation, junior
Hilary Homeyer, ranked seventh in
the nation, and fellow juniors Lau
ren Robertson and Jessica Belskis.
The Cardinal has also added
freshman Kim Rowton to the mix.
Despite the Cardinal's strength,
the team has its work cut out for it.
Conference rivals Arizona and
Arizona State are ranked second
and fourth in the country, respec
tively.
In the season's first tournament,
the NCAA Fall Preview, the Cardi
nal posted a three-day score of 910
to finish in seventh place. Homeyer
and Keever finished in the top 20 in
the individual standings and Row
ton posted a stellar 73 in one of her
first rounds of eollegiate play.

competition with a three-day total
of 878. The Blue Devils were fol
lowed hv three Pae-10 teams, USC
(882). Arizona (NK2) and Arizona
State (891).
The women's team struggled
late last month in the Stanford /
Pepsi Invitational at the Stanford
(iolf Course. The team finished in
eighth, 21 strokes behind the Uni
versity of Tulsa, which claimed
victory with the help of team mem
ber Stacy Prammanasudh's tour
nament-leading 210. Stanford's
Keever was 1 1 strokes behind

The Cardinal can look to re
deem itself this weekend, as the
competition at the Golf World/
Palmetto Dunes Invitational will
be arguably the best it has seen so
far. Fellow Pac-1() members Ari
zona. Arizona State and USC will
be there, as well as the Duke Blue
Devils. In all. II of the top-20
teams will challenge the Cardinal
