# Swimming looks to continue impressive form

### Kellie Wiginton Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's swim team
couldn't ask for a more exciting
home opener.
A battle between the nation's
top two teams will take place today
as No. 1 Stanford hosts the No. 2
Texas Longhorns at deCluerre
Pool.
Yes. the ('ardinal's training and
hard work so far this season has
been motivated by its ultimate goal
of an NCAA championship in
March. However, the opportunity

to compete at home against one of
its biggest national rivals has also
been on the forefront of the swim
mers' minds.
"Without a doubt, this is our
biggest dual meet of the year," said
junior Adam Messner. "Tradition
ally it's been a great indicator of
how the rest of our season will go."
Both teams will have something
to prove after last year's NCAA
meet, where the Cardinal finished
second behind Auburn, and Texas
finished third.
Stanford and Texas have a long
history of meets that have come

down to the last stroke. For the
past two years, Stanford has come
out on top, and has carried that
momentum through the rest of the
season.
Last year in Texas, in front of
approximately I.(KM) spirited Long
horn fans, Stanford silenced the
complex when it won the last event
the 400-meter free relay — to
win the meet. Two members of the
current Cardinal squad, senior
Cilenn Counts and Messner. were
both part of that relay team.
In order to win, the Cardinal
must have both freshmen and up-

perclassmen step up to the chal
lenge.
"We need to see how the fresh
men step up in a pressure situa
tion," Messner said. "And the up
perclassmen need to be able to step
up and show them how to do it."
At the College Cup in Canada
last weekend, Stanford showed
strengths in the relay events, as
well as several individual events.
Winning relay teams included the
2()0-medley relay and the 4(H) med
ley relay. Randall Bal
and juniors Steven Brown and Rob
Canales also turned in strong indi
vidual performances, giving Stan
ford high aspirations for the meet
against Texas.

■ Today: No. 1 Stanford vs. No. 2
Texas. 1 :(K) p.m., deGuerre Pool.

Brown has shown promising
times in the 400 individual medley,
winning the event last weekend at
the College Cup.
Bal has been strong in the 200
backstroke and 50 freestyle, while
Canales won the 200 IM and broke
the College Cup record in the 100
breaststoke.
Texas will definitely provide
some strong competition for the
Cardinal with several swimmers
who consistently make the finals at
the NCAA meet.
Bryan Jones, a powerful
freestyle sprinter, and John
Younghouse, a strong freestyle dis
tance swimmer, will both challenge
Stanford's best.
"This is exactly the way we want
to kick off the season," Messner
said. "This is the meet we want to
use to get the momentum rolling."
