The city of Palo Alto and Stanford
may team up to build a new perform
ing arts center either on campus or in
Palo Alto. This potential partnership
arose out of independent discussions
among both parties for the need for
better performing arts facilities.
Palo Alto Mayor Gary Fazzino in
troduced the idea of a joint effort
after his re-election last year and ap
proached University President Ger
hard Casper and Stanford's Director
of Government and Community Re
lations Larry 1 lorton.
"The notion for the need for a
new space [for performing arts] came
from the Palo Alto community. It
was nothing specific, more like
'Wouldn't it be nice if we could?' It
was out of that community buzz that
the mayor saw a possible opportuni
ty to act," said the city of Palo Alto's
Director of the Arts and Culture Di
vision Leon Kaplan.
An exploratory committee to de
sign a proposal has been formed. It
includes University Architect David
Neuman. the heads of the Music and

Drama department, the Palo Alto
mayor, Kaplan and the director of
the Palo Alto based performing com
pany. Theater Works, among others.
"After discussing if it would be ap
propriate to go forward with the idea
and if there was a likely match [of in
terests] between the two jurisdic
tions, we came to the conclusion that
'Yeah, maybe we can do this togeth
er,' " Kaplan said.
Stanford hopes the potential facil
ity would have three separate perfor
mance spaces capable of serving dif
ferent-size audiences as well as dif
ferent types of performances. Palo
Alto's goal is to provide an addition
al facility for the city's resident drama
groups such as Theater Works.
Stanford and Palo Alto have both
agreed to fund a study that would de
termine the center's feasibility. Last
week, the Palo Alto City Council
voted to set aside $S().(KX) to match
Stanford's commitment of $S(),(XX) to
hire a consultant to evaluate the land
use situation.
The construction of the center will
be contingent on the consultant's re
port, according to Palo Alto Deputy

Director of Community Services De
partment Richard James. The study
will look into available land and the
feasibility of the location in serving
both communities' interests. As the
plan for the performing arts center is
part of the Draft Community Plan,
the pending General Use Permit
must be approved if the center will be
on Stanford land.
Both Stanford and Palo Alto have
been considering the need for a new
performing arts facility for a number
of years. Stanford wanted to enhance
its performing arts program bv build
ing a better facility.
Horton emphasized that. "Stan
ford has always been interested in
any project that meets the needs of
Stanford's academic program, in this
case, the Departments of Music and
Drama."
Many Palo Alto citizens have
wanted another performing arts cen
ter for several years. Nearly 10 years
ago, one proposal was to build an arts
center on the then-vacant lot on Uni
versity Ave. where the Border's
Books and Music Store is currently
located.
