# Heated debate rages over incinerator
## 
### Eileen Chao Contributing writer 
Around 50 people spoke out
Wednesday night against a proposed
permit from the Bay Area Air Qual
ity Management District that would
allow Integrated Environmental Sys
tems / Norcal, a factory that burns
Stanford's medical waste, to contin
ue burning waste in a residential
area.
Fight Stanford students were
among more than 2(X) people who at
tended this four-hour hearing at Fre
mont High School in Oakland. Other

representatives were from local com
munities or organizations such as
GrecnAction. the California Nurses
Association and Mills College.
According to junior Colin Kilter.
Stanford Medical Center and Hospi
tal collectively contributed K05.7 tons
of waste to be burned by lES last
year. 14 percent of the total amount
burned at the incinerator. One con
cern is that the dioxin released may
cause health problems such as birth
defects, hormonal changes, diabetes
and infertility. Many people went to
the hearing to report on the damage
dioxins can cause.

"There was a woman from San
Francisco who talked about breast
cancer," said freshman Adrianna
I lemandez. "It was said that dioxin is
most harmful to breast-feeding
mothers."
The main issue of contention at
the meeting was the amount of diox
in released by the incinerator. An
lES manager said that the factory
was doing a great job in being careful
with its dioxin levels. I le believes that
they were safe enough and reported
that his son had no defects.
