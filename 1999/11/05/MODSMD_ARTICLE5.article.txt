# Heated debate rages over incinerator
## 
### Eileen Chao Contributing writer 
Around 50 people spoke out
Wednesday night against a proposed
permit from the Bay Area Air Qual
ity Management District that would
allow Integrated Environmental Sys
tems / Norcal, a factory that burns
Stanford's medical waste, to contin
ue burning waste in a residential
area.
Fight Stanford students were
among more than 2(X) people who at
tended this four-hour hearing at Fre
mont High School in Oakland. Other

representatives were from local com
munities or organizations such as
GrecnAction. the California Nurses
Association and Mills College.
According to junior Colin Kilter.
Stanford Medical Center and Hospi
tal collectively contributed K05.7 tons
of waste to be burned by lES last
year. 14 percent of the total amount
burned at the incinerator. One con
cern is that the dioxin released may
cause health problems such as birth
defects, hormonal changes, diabetes
and infertility. Many people went to
the hearing to report on the damage
dioxins can cause.

"There was a woman from San
Francisco who talked about breast
cancer," said freshman Adrianna
I lemandez. "It was said that dioxin is
most harmful to breast-feeding
mothers."
The main issue of contention at
the meeting was the amount of diox
in released by the incinerator. An
lES manager said that the factory
was doing a great job in being careful
with its dioxin levels. I le believes that
they were safe enough and reported
that his son had no defects.
According to Hernandez, many of
those present at the meeting ad
dressed the issue of "environmental
racism." The incineration plant is lo
cated in Fruitvail District of Oakland,
a low-income community of color.
Many people at the meeting said it
was unfair for lES to be releasing the
harmful substance into a neighbor
hood which is unable to fight back.
"Even if they are burning the
waste, they shouldn't be doing it in a
residential area," said junior Louise
Auerhahn. "The only reason they're
getting away with it is that it's in a low
income area."
Also brought up was the fact that
the permit was not written in Spanish
until one day before the hearing, al
though most residents in the commu
nity directly affected are Spanish
speaking.
According to Ritter, Stanford
used to dispose of its own medical
waste by microwaving or autoclaving
the waste, which sterilized it so that it
could be buried in a landfill. This was
less harmful to the environment be
cause it did not release any dangerous
substances into the atmosphere, but it
was hazardous to the workers who
had to handle it.
"The reason why Stanford decid
ed to go to lES was that the health
risks for the employees were too
great to keep here so now Stanford
pays more to lES to dispose of the
waste," said Ritter. "But that's envi
ronmental injustice. We're only
doing it because we can afford to dis

place all the risks and hazards to low
income people."
Although most people who spoke
were against the permit, there was a
group of workers from IES who sup
ported the measure. I heir manager
argued that if the permit was not ap
proved, there would be massive job
cuts and costs would rise. However, a
labor union was present to counter
this statement, saying that the compa
ny has more than enough money to
compensate lor any changes that
have to be made.
In the past 10 years, lES has vio
lated around 2(X) air quality regula
tions, according to Auerhahn. In
19%, the company built two new fur
naces, complying with the Bay Area
Air Quality Management District,
which issues the permits. Auerhahn
hopes to make even more changes to
existing regulations.
"We're trying to get the permit to
be more restrictive and to have larger
fines for violations," she said.
Junior Janelle Ishida said she felt
the meeting was a good start for this
movement.
"1 was really impressed with the
turnout. It seemed like a galvanizing
event for the campaign," Ishida said.
"We won't see the results immediate
ly, but it was good to see how many
people knew about the issue."
There will be a week more to sub
mit written comments, which the
Stanford students will do. After that,
the Environmental Protection
Agency will have 45 days to review
the comments and make a ruling on
the permit. After that decision, the
public has 60 days to file a complaint
with the agency.
