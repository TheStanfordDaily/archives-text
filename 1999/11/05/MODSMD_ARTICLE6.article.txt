## 
### Neela Dasgupta Contributing writer 
"Yo Mama" jokes are a power
ful instrument of expression for
young African Americans, author
and lecturer Cecil Brown, said in a
"Branner Presents" program last
night.
The freelance writer and lectur
er on American Literature and
Folklore spoke about the role of
racism and humor in popular cul
ture.
"Yo Mama" jokes, also known
in African-American culture as
"the Dozens," involve a verbal
competition in which one person
puts down another with extreme in
sults.
"As slaves, blacks grew up hear
ing, 'shut up.' all the time. With the
Dozens, they can instead be clever
at verbal encounters. They don't
have It) cry when someone insults
their mom — they can be quick to
reply." Brown said.
The lecturer also presented rap
as a medium for African Americans
to express themselves without cen
sorship or restrictions.
"Rappers can decide on whatev
er subject they want and do what
they want with it,"he said.
In most aspects of modern soci
ety, minority groups do not have
such freedom of expression. Brown
said. He pointed to the difficulties
young black filmmakers have in
I lollywood.
While movies such as "Bowfin
ger," he said, center around nega
tive black stereotypes, films satiriz
ing whites are not as common.
In "Bowfinger." actor Steve
Martin plays a white filmmaker
who tricks a black movie star
(Eddie Murphy) into being in his
movie. Murphy's character is sexist,
racist, childlike and stupid —
stereotypes commonly attributed
to African Americans, Brown said.

"Films such as these disguise and
raliuvaJwe racism in Hollywood,"
he said.
"You have to analyze pop cul
ture because everything that seems
to happen for no reason really has a
deeper meaning that uncovers the
American national character."
Brown said.

Drawing on this idea. Brown dis
cussed ethnic jokes as a component
popular culture. Reading ex
cerpts from an essay titled "The
Form and Function of the Ethnic
Joke," Brown discussed the mo
tives for insulting humor.

Cecil Brown spoke to an audience in Branner Hall last night about
the construction of racial identity through movies, other forms of
pop culture and ethnic jokes.
During his discussion of racial
humor. Brown told jokes about
Mexican Americans, Jews, African
Americans and Caucasians. Brown
said that while such humor is often
seen as offensive, it should be con
doned as long as the group being in
sulted can retaliate with insults of its
own.
I he audience had varied respons
es to this aspect of the lecture.

"It's interesting that his point was
not that ethnic jokes arc had. but
how they are a basis of popular cul
ture," said senior Dan Perkel, a resi
dent assistant who organized the
event.
Some Branncr residents felt
Brown should have elaborated on
the role such jokes play in the defin
ition of a group's identity.
"Ethnic groups should not have
to have their identity depend on
playing up stereotypes instead of
embracing culture," freshman
Shilpa Vuthoori said.
