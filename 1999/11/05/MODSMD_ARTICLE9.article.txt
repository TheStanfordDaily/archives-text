birthday. Having reached the age
of 21 and with his commitment ful
filled to the pirates, Frederick
leaves them. I le happens upon the
daughters of the Major General,
and with his affection reciprocated
for the outgoing Mabel, the two

fall in love.
A beautiful love story? Not
quite. A capture, a confrontation,
and ;i sudden astronomical revela
tion threaten to tear these lovers
apart.
Musical director Jeremy I len
drickson. a Stanford alumnus, be
lieves the audience will have as
much fun with the show as the
company has.
"The comedy in 'Pirates' not
only manifests itself through
Gilbert's clever lyrics." he said,
"but also is conveyed through Sul
livan's music and orchestration.
Because ol this, the show is as
much tun to perform as ii is to lis
ten fo."
Producer Alice Leung, a junior
working on her third production
with the Savoyards, is excited
about the students, stall, alumni
and community members playing
in "Pirates."
"()ur cast is dynamic and awe
some," she said. "Savoyards is a

great group because it's not only
Stanford students. You get to see
out of the Stanford bubble."

Frederick in his third production
with the Savoyards. This is also his
second Savoyards production of
"The Pirates of Penzance;" as a
sophomore at Menlo-Atherton
High School, he played a pirate.
This time around, he has a some
what different perspective.
"I now understand the jokes,"
he said. "I really appreciate the
creativity of Ciilbert and Sullivan."
Making her Savoyards debut,
freshman I lyse Nakajima plays
Mabel. She has performed opera
extensively in the Seattle area,
where she lived.
"It's been a challenge." she
says, "but it's been fun working
with such a great cast."

a sophomore, play Samuel and
Kate, respectively. Another cast
