■ Does it take you more
than 45 minutes to fall
asleep at night?
MDo you wake up a lot
during the night, and
have trouble falling back
to sleep?
■ Do you wake up too early
in the morning?
If you have these symp
toms but still feel rested
during the day, don't
worry.
But if you feel chronical
ly tired as well, perhaps
your insomnia needs
attention.
Causes
If these conditions hist for two
or three nights or even a few
weeks, the cause is often
worry and stress. If they go on
for months or years, common
causes may be general anxiety,
depression, or side effects of
medications.
What to Do
■ Only sleep as much as you
need to feel refreshed the
next day
■ Each day, get up at the
same time, no matter what
- even on weekends until
your body learns the
pattern
Hailing a devil of a time with
sleep? These Stanford juniors
plagued faculty and seniors
with satire in 1901. And they
make a good image for
Stanford students plagued
with insomnia today.
Don't sleep during the day
Get more exercise (but not
within two hours of bed
time)
Don't drink caffeine after
noon (and go easy on it
before that); caffeine in the
evening disturbs sleep,
even in those who do not
feel it does
Alcohol may help falling
asleep faster, but the
ensuing sleep is then
fragmented
An occasional sleeping pill
may help, but long-term
use is at best ineffective,
and may make the problem
Ask a pharmacist if any
medications you are taking
could be the cause of your
insomnia (e.g., decongestants)
Try a glass ot warm milk at
bedtime
Rather than trying harder
and harder to fall asleep, go
do something else in
another room until you feel
sleepy
If noise is a problem, try a
white noise machine or ear
plugs
An excessively warm room
may disturb sleep, but an
excessively cold room
doesn't necessarily help
When to Get Help
■ If you can't solve the
problem after a month of
trying the above tips
■ If you snore loudly and feel
exhausted during the day
(this could be sleep apnea -
a blockage of the upper
airways)
