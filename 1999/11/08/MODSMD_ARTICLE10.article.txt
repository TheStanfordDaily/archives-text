# Leading scholars debate abuses of history
## 
### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
History can help us craft stories
of nationhood and give meaning to
our lives, but the dangers of looking
to the past are also great. The past
can needlessly imprison.
These were some of the senti
ments aroused over the weekend by
the "Past Dependencies" sympo
sium, part of the series of Presiden
tial Lectures and Symposia.
At the opening session on Fri
day, Law School Dean Kathleen
Sullivan hailed the symposium as
the product of the "remarkable vi
sion" of Comparative Literature
Prof. Sepp Gumbrecht and Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper.
The first session dealt with the
relationship of past to identity.
"Contiguity between past and iden
tity has become [too] popular."
Gumbrecht said in his opening re
marks as discussion moderator.
Panelist member and Oxford
phil osopher Joseph Raz spoke
about the story of "The Little
Prince," arguing that, in moments
of crisis, meaning comes from a
common history.
"Meaning is invested in the
world by our attachments," Raz
said. For the little Prince, his rose is
"past dependent" and unique to
him.

In the sccond session on the way
different areas rely on history, pan
elists discussed law. geography and
economics and whether history has
a serious role in informing work in
those fields.
Johns Hopkins geographer
David Harvey spoke about "Cos
mopolitanism and the banality of
geographical evils."
Cosmopolitanism is character
ized by calls for a "global dialogue"
and geographical and ecological ed
ucation about the world, Harvey
said, referring to work by philoso
pher Martha Nussbaum.
Although geography is "dis
missed everywhere," I larvey said,
the subject has a long-standing his
tory.
Since most people's general un
derstanding of space and place is
"not great," the implications of ge
ographical knowledge can be
"problematic when inserted in
whole structures of understand
ing," I larvey said.
The complexity of geographical
knowledge has made the cos
mopolitan ethic more difficult to re
al i/.e.
An official of the European
Union called the EU "Kant's
dream of cosmopolitan republican
ism realized," while simultaneously
calling for NA TO bombings in the
Balkans as part of a "military hu

mamsm.
These phenomena of regional
unity and regional aggression sit in
an uncomfortable crucible of "cos
mopolitanism." Harvey suggested.
Harvey is the author of "The Cul
ture of Post-modernity" and "Jus
tice, Nature, and the Geography of
Difference," among other books.
"What kind of cosmopolitanism
relates to what kind of geographical
knowledge?" I larvey asked.
Law Prof. Robert Wcisberg, dis
cussion moderator, asked panel
members to comment on Harvey's
suggestion that the idea that the
"global economy" is wholly new is
more pretense than substance.
Economics Prof. Avner Greif,
an economic historian, said the
world from an economic perspec
tive has been 'global' in the past.
Greif said economic historians
ask the questions most economists
would ask last. They examine the
emergence of social structures and
take historical understanding to be
central to understanding economic
activity.
The idea of emergence was cen
tral to the third discussion panel.
Wlad Godzich, professor of
Comparative Literature at the Uni
versity of Geneva, spoke on
"Emergent Intelligence: Anthropic
Tales."
"It is the fate of all human pro

ductions to become literalure-the
Code of Hammurabi is literature,
the Bible is literature ... Malthus is
literature, Darwin is literature. You
get the idea," Godzich said.
New conceptions of literature
may include music as "audio litera
ture" and new cuisine as "gustatory
literature." This is the problem with
the past, he said.
The final panel discussion at
tracted the largest audience. Judge
Richard Posner, Chief Judge of the
7th Circuit Court of Appeals, expli
cated an essay by Nietzsche on the
uses and abuses of history.
As moderator, Sullivan framed
the discussion in terms of the ten
sions in how constitutional law re
lates to the past.
In American history, the past
has been met with both "reverence
and repudiation," she said, in the
tradition of James Madison and
Thomas Jefferson, respectively.
Americans celebrate bi-centen
nials with reverence and sometimes
invoke the "original intentions" of
the framers of the Constitution in
the same spirit, but we also see the
past as "full of oppressions," Sulli
van said.
The late Justice William Bren
nan called Posner the only real ge
nius he had ever encountered. Sulli
van said.
Posner, author of "The Econom
ics of Justice," "Antitrust Law: An
Economic Perspective, Economic
Analysis of Law." among other
books and articles, began with Niet
zsche's distinction between two
kinds of history, history as recorded
events and "scientific history."
Nietzsche's target is only the lat
ter form of history. Posner said.
History, according to Nietzsche,
leads an age to believe they possess
the virtues of justice, compassion
and so forth to a greater degree
than any previous age, Posner said.
"Every past is worthy to be con
demned," Posner said. Although
certain kinds of history are good,
certain kinds of forgetfulness are
also good, he said.
Nietzsche believed that "we
need illusions to achieve anything,"
Posner said, and that certain kinds
of myth-making can be socially use
ful.
Posner offered as an example
the events in Kosovo, where he said
the Serbian preoccupation with his
tory was a problem. "[They] could
deal with a dose of forgetting," he
said.
Although history provides
precedents, "precedents are only
relevant when present problems re
semble the past very closely," Pos
ner said.
"Justice demands that like cases
must be treated alike. It's the like
ness, not the pastness [that is the
relevant feature in using prece
dent]," he said.
In the discussion that followed
panelists' responses to Posner,
Comparative Literature Prof.
Richard Rortv. whom Sullivan de

scribed as the "leading philosopher
of pragmatism." argued that oppo
nents of pragmatism say a nation
"can't rely on hope; [it| needs to tell
a story [about itself]" and therefore,
needs a history.
"Monumental history" and
mvth-making often successfully
allow us to "construct a moral iden
tity." Rorty said, suggesting that a
certain amount of historical piety
can be useful.
Rorty said the issue at stake in
the discussion of the uses and abus
es of history is "to what extent can
we think of imagination over argu
ment as the instrument of moral
progress?"
"We should use history to re
mind ourselves how frequently
imagination made the past seem ir
relevant," he said.
Hayden White, visiting profes
sor of comparative literature, said.
"History [has been] seen as a
branch of rhetoric, not its antithesis.
History is not and has never been
'scientific.'"
Law and history are both com
mon sensical. White said. All Harry
Truman had to say before dropping
the atomic bomb was,"The buck
stops here."
"Good rhetoric serves the good,
bad rhetoric serves the bad," he
said.
Rorty noted that in one of Pos
ner's books, Posner said his favorite
philosopher is John Stuart Mill.
Rorty said that Mill represents a
combination of Bentham's utilitari
anism and Coleridge's romanti
cism. but that Posner himself is
aligned too far toward Bentham.
"I think Judge Posner should do
more Hegel," Rorty said, adding
that because the judiciary is the
only branch of government that still
enjoys some respect, it could serve
as a source of national inspiration.

to the past are also great. The past
can needlessly imprison.
These were some of the senti
ments aroused over the weekend by
the "Past Dependencies" sympo
sium, part of the series of Presiden
tial Lectures and Symposia.
At the opening session on Fri
day, Law School Dean Kathleen
Sullivan hailed the symposium as
the product of the "remarkable vi
sion" of Comparative Literature
Prof. Sepp Gumbrecht and Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper.
The first session dealt with the
relationship of past to identity.
"Contiguity between past and iden
tity has become [too] popular."
Gumbrecht said in his opening re
marks as discussion moderator.
Panelist member and Oxford
phil osopher Joseph Raz spoke
about the story of "The Little
Prince," arguing that, in moments
of crisis, meaning comes from a
common history.
"Meaning is invested in the
world by our attachments," Raz
said. For the little Prince, his rose is
"past dependent" and unique to
him.

In the sccond session on the way
different areas rely on history, pan
elists discussed law. geography and
economics and whether history has
a serious role in informing work in
those fields.
Johns Hopkins geographer
David Harvey spoke about "Cos
mopolitanism and the banality of
geographical evils."
Cosmopolitanism is character
ized by calls for a "global dialogue"
and geographical and ecological ed
ucation about the world, Harvey
said, referring to work by philoso
pher Martha Nussbaum.
Although geography is "dis
missed everywhere," I larvey said,
the subject has a long-standing his
tory.
Since most people's general un
derstanding of space and place is
"not great," the implications of ge
ographical knowledge can be
"problematic when inserted in
whole structures of understand
ing," I larvey said.
The complexity of geographical
knowledge has made the cos
mopolitan ethic more difficult to re
al i/.e.
An official of the European
Union called the EU "Kant's
dream of cosmopolitan republican
ism realized," while simultaneously
calling for NA TO bombings in the
Balkans as part of a "military hu

mamsm.
These phenomena of regional
unity and regional aggression sit in
an uncomfortable crucible of "cos
mopolitanism." Harvey suggested.
Harvey is the author of "The Cul
ture of Post-modernity" and "Jus
tice, Nature, and the Geography of
Difference," among other books.
"What kind of cosmopolitanism
relates to what kind of geographical
knowledge?" I larvey asked.
Law Prof. Robert Wcisberg, dis
cussion moderator, asked panel
members to comment on Harvey's
suggestion that the idea that the
"global economy" is wholly new is
more pretense than substance.
Economics Prof. Avner Greif,
an economic historian, said the
world from an economic perspec
tive has been 'global' in the past.
Greif said economic historians
ask the questions most economists
would ask last. They examine the
emergence of social structures and
take historical understanding to be
central to understanding economic
activity.
The idea of emergence was cen
tral to the third discussion panel.
Wlad Godzich, professor of
Comparative Literature at the Uni
versity of Geneva, spoke on
"Emergent Intelligence: Anthropic
Tales."
"It is the fate of all human pro

ductions to become literalure-the
Code of Hammurabi is literature,
the Bible is literature ... Malthus is
literature, Darwin is literature. You
get the idea," Godzich said.
New conceptions of literature
may include music as "audio litera
ture" and new cuisine as "gustatory
literature." This is the problem with
the past, he said.
The final panel discussion at
tracted the largest audience. Judge
Richard Posner, Chief Judge of the
7th Circuit Court of Appeals, expli
cated an essay by Nietzsche on the
uses and abuses of history.
As moderator, Sullivan framed
the discussion in terms of the ten
sions in how constitutional law re
lates to the past.
In American history, the past
has been met with both "reverence
and repudiation," she said, in the
tradition of James Madison and
Thomas Jefferson, respectively.
Americans celebrate bi-centen
nials with reverence and sometimes
invoke the "original intentions" of
the framers of the Constitution in
the same spirit, but we also see the
past as "full of oppressions," Sulli
van said.
The late Justice William Bren
nan called Posner the only real ge
nius he had ever encountered. Sulli
van said.
Posner, author of "The Econom
ics of Justice," "Antitrust Law: An
Economic Perspective, Economic
Analysis of Law." among other
books and articles, began with Niet
zsche's distinction between two
kinds of history, history as recorded
events and "scientific history."
Nietzsche's target is only the lat
ter form of history. Posner said.
History, according to Nietzsche,
leads an age to believe they possess
the virtues of justice, compassion
and so forth to a greater degree
than any previous age, Posner said.
"Every past is worthy to be con
demned," Posner said. Although
certain kinds of history are good,
certain kinds of forgetfulness are
also good, he said.
Nietzsche believed that "we
need illusions to achieve anything,"
Posner said, and that certain kinds
of myth-making can be socially use
ful.
Posner offered as an example
the events in Kosovo, where he said
the Serbian preoccupation with his
tory was a problem. "[They] could
deal with a dose of forgetting," he
said.
Although history provides
precedents, "precedents are only
relevant when present problems re
semble the past very closely," Pos
ner said.
"Justice demands that like cases
must be treated alike. It's the like
ness, not the pastness [that is the
relevant feature in using prece
dent]," he said.
In the discussion that followed
panelists' responses to Posner,
Comparative Literature Prof.
Richard Rortv. whom Sullivan de

scribed as the "leading philosopher
of pragmatism." argued that oppo
nents of pragmatism say a nation
"can't rely on hope; [it| needs to tell
a story [about itself]" and therefore,
needs a history.
"Monumental history" and
mvth-making often successfully
allow us to "construct a moral iden
tity." Rorty said, suggesting that a
certain amount of historical piety
can be useful.
Rorty said the issue at stake in
the discussion of the uses and abus
es of history is "to what extent can
we think of imagination over argu
ment as the instrument of moral
progress?"
"We should use history to re
mind ourselves how frequently
imagination made the past seem ir
relevant," he said.
Hayden White, visiting profes
sor of comparative literature, said.
"History [has been] seen as a
branch of rhetoric, not its antithesis.
History is not and has never been
'scientific.'"
Law and history are both com
mon sensical. White said. All Harry
Truman had to say before dropping
the atomic bomb was,"The buck
stops here."
"Good rhetoric serves the good,
bad rhetoric serves the bad," he
said.
Rorty noted that in one of Pos
ner's books, Posner said his favorite
philosopher is John Stuart Mill.
Rorty said that Mill represents a
combination of Bentham's utilitari
anism and Coleridge's romanti
cism. but that Posner himself is
aligned too far toward Bentham.
"I think Judge Posner should do
more Hegel," Rorty said, adding
that because the judiciary is the
only branch of government that still
enjoys some respect, it could serve
as a source of national inspiration.
History can help us craft stories
of nationhood and give meaning to
our lives, but the dangers of looking
to the past are also great. The past
can needlessly imprison.

ments aroused over the weekend by
