# Leading scholars debate abuses of history
## 
### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
History can help us craft stories
of nationhood and give meaning to
our lives, but the dangers of looking
to the past are also great. The past
can needlessly imprison.
These were some of the senti
ments aroused over the weekend by
the "Past Dependencies" sympo
sium, part of the series of Presiden
tial Lectures and Symposia.
At the opening session on Fri
day, Law School Dean Kathleen
Sullivan hailed the symposium as
the product of the "remarkable vi
sion" of Comparative Literature
Prof. Sepp Gumbrecht and Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper.
The first session dealt with the
relationship of past to identity.
"Contiguity between past and iden
tity has become [too] popular."
Gumbrecht said in his opening re
marks as discussion moderator.
Panelist member and Oxford
phil osopher Joseph Raz spoke
about the story of "The Little
Prince," arguing that, in moments
of crisis, meaning comes from a
common history.
"Meaning is invested in the
world by our attachments," Raz
said. For the little Prince, his rose is
"past dependent" and unique to
him.

In the sccond session on the way
different areas rely on history, pan
elists discussed law. geography and
economics and whether history has
a serious role in informing work in
those fields.
Johns Hopkins geographer
David Harvey spoke about "Cos
mopolitanism and the banality of
geographical evils."
Cosmopolitanism is character
ized by calls for a "global dialogue"
and geographical and ecological ed
ucation about the world, Harvey
said, referring to work by philoso
pher Martha Nussbaum.
Although geography is "dis
missed everywhere," I larvey said,
the subject has a long-standing his
tory.
Since most people's general un
derstanding of space and place is
"not great," the implications of ge
ographical knowledge can be
"problematic when inserted in
whole structures of understand
ing," I larvey said.
The complexity of geographical
knowledge has made the cos
mopolitan ethic more difficult to re
al i/.e.
An official of the European
Union called the EU "Kant's
dream of cosmopolitan republican
ism realized," while simultaneously
calling for NA TO bombings in the
Balkans as part of a "military hu

mamsm.
These phenomena of regional
unity and regional aggression sit in
an uncomfortable crucible of "cos
mopolitanism." Harvey suggested.
Harvey is the author of "The Cul
ture of Post-modernity" and "Jus
tice, Nature, and the Geography of
Difference," among other books.
"What kind of cosmopolitanism
relates to what kind of geographical
knowledge?" I larvey asked.
Law Prof. Robert Wcisberg, dis
cussion moderator, asked panel
members to comment on Harvey's
suggestion that the idea that the
"global economy" is wholly new is
more pretense than substance.
Economics Prof. Avner Greif,
an economic historian, said the
world from an economic perspec
tive has been 'global' in the past.
Greif said economic historians
ask the questions most economists
would ask last. They examine the
emergence of social structures and
take historical understanding to be
central to understanding economic
activity.
The idea of emergence was cen
tral to the third discussion panel.
Wlad Godzich, professor of
Comparative Literature at the Uni
versity of Geneva, spoke on
"Emergent Intelligence: Anthropic
Tales."
"It is the fate of all human pro

ductions to become literalure-the
Code of Hammurabi is literature,
the Bible is literature ... Malthus is
literature, Darwin is literature. You
get the idea," Godzich said.
New conceptions of literature
may include music as "audio litera
ture" and new cuisine as "gustatory
literature." This is the problem with
the past, he said.
The final panel discussion at
tracted the largest audience. Judge
Richard Posner, Chief Judge of the
7th Circuit Court of Appeals, expli
cated an essay by Nietzsche on the
uses and abuses of history.
As moderator, Sullivan framed
the discussion in terms of the ten
sions in how constitutional law re
lates to the past.
In American history, the past
has been met with both "reverence
and repudiation," she said, in the
tradition of James Madison and
Thomas Jefferson, respectively.
Americans celebrate bi-centen
nials with reverence and sometimes
invoke the "original intentions" of
the framers of the Constitution in
the same spirit, but we also see the
past as "full of oppressions," Sulli
van said.
The late Justice William Bren
nan called Posner the only real ge
nius he had ever encountered. Sulli
