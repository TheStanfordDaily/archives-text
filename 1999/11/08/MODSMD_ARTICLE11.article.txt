With gold-colored garlands, soft
candles, bright Christmas lights and
sweet incense, the Stanford India As
sociation (SIA) set the stage Satur
day night lor a celebration of Diwali,
India's "Festival of I jghts."
Welcoming the new year with a
pooja a religious I lindu ceremony
- and traditional artistic perfor
mances. the event attracted so many
students that there was not enough
space to seat them all in the Bechtel
International Center.
One of the SlA's main goals was
to present an event as close to an au
thentic Diwali celebration as possi

"We tried to create a traditional
atmosphere," Electrical Engineering
graduate student Anand Chan
drasekaran, an event organi/er. said.
"Before planning it. we asked people
what they really missed at home dur
ing Diwali, and they said the lights,
the pooja, the entertainment."
The key characteristic of the func
tion, audience members said, was the
informal and intimate atmosphere,
which reminded them of Diwali cele
brations in India.
"1 thought it was amazing. I went
to high school in India, and this
brought back memories from
home," graduate student Hemanth
Sampath said.
Others agreed that the perfor
mances and activities made them
reminisce about the place where they
grew up.
"I'm always homesick around this
time, so I wanted to experience
something as close to home as possi

ble," senior Natasha Vethananan
dani said.
Performers sang Hindi film songs
such as "Chalte C'halte" and "Ac
Mere Humsafer." as the audience
clapped, tapped their feet and some
times even sang along.
Many people said they were im
pressed by the talent displayed dur
ing the show.
" The classical South Indian pro
gram with the violin was very re
freshing, and definitely of a profes
sional caliber," said Electrical Engi
neering graduate student Pawan
Kapur, an audience member who
was inspired to sing impromptu at
the end of the show.
The cultural show included other
unique instruments, such as a har
monica, tabla (traditional Indian
drums) and electric guitar.
At one point in the program, a co
median poked fun at the Indian
cricket team and impersonated vari
ous Hindi actors — several people
were laughing so hard they could not
stop.
The religious decor added to the
intimacy of the event. Inside, pic
tures depicting Hindu gods such as
Shiva. Krishna and Ganesh hung on
the walls, while outside, colored
powder decorated the ground with
images of flowers and lamps.
While the SIA acknowledged the
religious aspect of Diwali, they also
incorporated social elements. At the
end of the show, the lights went dark
and Hindi film songs filled the air as
students danced.

it's also a chance for everyone to get

vegetarian delicacies.

"The next best thing to home
cooked Indian food is catered Indian
food." Sampath said.

did not have Indian backgrounds, but

were still interested in the ceremony.
