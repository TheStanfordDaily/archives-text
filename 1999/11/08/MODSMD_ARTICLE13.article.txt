# Hoover gathers experts to damn U.S. drug war
## 
### Scott Dorfman Contributing writer 
When the topic of drug legaliza
tion comes up, one might think of
Grateful Dead shows and peace
rallies in Berkeley rather than the
staid, conservative confines of the
Hoover Institution.
However, on Thursday and Fri
day, a group of more than 100 aca
demics, law enforcement officers,
physicians, parents and students
converged upon the Hoover Insti
tution to debate alternatives to
America's current drug war in a
conference entitled, "Youth,
Drugs and Crime."
The goal of the conference, ac
cording to a Hoover press release,
was to "attempt to explain reasons
for recent increases in drug use by
adolescents." The U.S. govern
ment's drug policies were exam
ined in a series of panels featuring
mayors, police chiefs, medical pro
fessionals, judges and parents.
The panels' experts included
Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke
and San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales
for the mayor's perspective and
Seattle Police Chief Norman
Stamper for the police chief's per
spective.
The keynote address for the
conference was given by Ethan
Nadelmann, director of the Linde
smith Center in New York and a
critic of the war on drugs. Addi
tional speakers included former
U.S. Attorney General Edwin
Meese 111 and Eric Sterling, presi
dent of the Criminal Justice Policy
Foundation in Washington, D.C.
A viewpoint that arose through
out the conference was that Amer
ica's drug laws cause more prob
lems than the drugs themselves.
"When you want to see who
commits a crime, you have to look
at who benefits," said Milton
Friedman, a moderator for the
judge's perspective debate and se
nior research fellow at Hoover.
"And in the realm of drug prohibi
tion, the two groups who benefit
most from the current system are
the large drug cartels and the fed
eral Drug Enforcement Agency.
These groups make their living by
punishing innocent victims."
Several other panelists echoed
Friedman's sentiments, claiming
that the war on drugs is doing far
more harm to American citizens

than good.
"We could give people in this
room seven days to come up with a
worse system than the current drug
enforcement system, and they
couldn't," said James Gray, Supe
rior Court Judge from Orange
County, California. "We have lost
more of our civil liberties because
of the drug war than for any other
reason in history. I do not advocate
one bit the use of this garbage
[drugs], but it is the drug money
and drug corruption that is really
bringing us down."
Gray also addressed the war on
drugs from a taxpayer standpoint,
relaying a story of a mother arrest
ed and sentenced for delivering a
package of cocaine from her
boyfriend to another person.
"It costs $25,000 a year to keep
this woman incarcerated for five
years. In addition, it costs $60,000 a
year to keep each of her two chil
dren in a group home while she is
in prison. Taxpayers are spending
$145,000 a year to keep a mother
separated from her kids," he said.
Denver Federal District Judge
John Kane addressed the issue of
drug laws and constitutional rights,
claiming that "the effect of our
mandatory drug guidelines are
racist, and 1 think that they are de
signed to be that way."
The alleged implicit racism of
the war on drugs was also dis
cussed by Vaughan Walker, U.S.
District Judge, San Francisco. â€¢
"There has been a xenophobic
element to the prohibition of drugs
in the past. Opium was prohibited
due to the preponderance (>f
opium dens in San Francisco aijd
fears of the Chinese workers wl}o
populated these places. Marijuana
prohibition in the 1930s was in part
driven by fears of the large immi
grant Mexican population. In these
cases, prohibition was driven by
fears of those groups rather than
the drugs themselves." ' I
Marsha Rosenbaum, director {)!
Lindesmith Center West in S4n
Francisco and a member of tl)e
parent's panel, addressed another
aspect of America's war on drugs,
the drug education programs in
schools.
"Drug education has funda
mental flaws, because in order |o
