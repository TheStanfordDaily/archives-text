## Judge declares Microsoft a stifling monopoly 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
nation's top antitrust official said the
government is "looking at a full
range of remedies" to punish
Microsoft following a judge's ruling
thiil the software giant misused its
njqpopoly powers.
, Pespite U.S. District Judge
1 homas Penfield Jackson's prelimi
nary findings against Microsoft, how
ever, both the government and the
company expressed a willingness to
consider an out-of-court settlement.
In an open letter, Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates said the compa
ny is committed to "a fair and
responsible" resolution. The compa

ny's chief operating officer. Bob
Herbold, said on the Sunday talk
shows that "there's nothing we'd like
more than to settle this case."
Assistant Attorney General Joel
Klein, who also appeared on three
television programs, said. "Obvious
ly settlement is always an option."
Neither Klein nor I lerbold would
suggest what an agreement might
entail.
"We would need a settlement
that deals with the very findings that
the court made in this case, a settle
ment that produces consumer
choice, innovation and competition
in the market." Klein said on "Fox

News Sunday."
He cited "serious issues here
about law enforcement and the
antitrust laws. And of course if
Microsoft were prepared to engage
on those issues, we would be pre
pared as well."
In Gates' letter, which appeared
as a full-page advertisement in The
Washington Post, he wrote that
"Microsoft is committed to resolving
this matter in a fair and responsible
manner while ensuring that the fun
damental principles of consumer
benefit and innovation are protect
ed."
"At the heart of this case." he

said, "is whether a successful Ameri
can company can continue to
improve its products for the benefit
of consumers."
The letter, addressed "To Our
Customers, Partners and Sharehold
ers." also appeared on Microsoft's
World Wide Web site, dated Friday,
the day Jackson released his ruling.
It was similar to a statement Gates
read on the same day.
Jackson, who presided over 77
days of testimony, declared in a
remarkably blunt decision that
Microsoft's aggressive use of its
monopoly status stilled innovation
and hurt consumers by limiting

choices.
On ABC, Klein said Jackson's
findings meant that "Microsoft was
able to control personal computers
and control investment in that
area."
"You know, in America you
have a choice," Klein said. "And if
IBM or Gateway or Compaq or
Dell ... had a choice, they could go
to Microsoft and negotiate, or they
could go to somebody else and
negotiate. Here, everybody's got to
go to one place — that's what's
hurting us."
He said both sides will submit to
Jackson legal analyses of his find

ings, after which the judge will
decide penalties, if any.
Government lawyers, Klein said,
are "doing an analysis that will look
at the full range of remedies."
Asked if breaking up Microsoft is
among them. Klein said: "That is in
the range, hut... it is premature for
us now to get ahead of the story."
One penalty that he appeared to
rule out is a fine. "Let me make
clear we are not looking for any
financial penalties," Klein said on
CNN's "Late Edition." "We're con
cerned with competition. This is not
a penal action, and we're not going
to seek monies."
