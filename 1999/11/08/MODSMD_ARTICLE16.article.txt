NCAA must preserve mini
mum qualifying marks on the
SAT for student-athletes

In three months, an appeals-court
panel will deliver a final decision
in the case of the NCAA's
Proposition 16, which dictates that
college athletes must have a com
bined SAT score of at least 820 to be
eligible for participation. Prop. 16
has come under fire from those who
claim that the SAT discriminates
against African-American athletes.
Since the court's ruling has
already swung both ways, it would
seem that there is a legitimate claim
against these standardization prac
tices. The SAT may be shown to be
discriminatory (albeit not intention
ally so) because it is a product of the
dominant social culture. ITie reason
ing behind the placement of ques
tions on the SAT, as well as the rea
soning behind the NCAA's eligibility
requirements, must be investigated
carefully.
However, the problem here goes
much deeper than the SAT and its
potentially discriminatory practices.
There's a reason why the SAT is
being brought to court in the forum
of athletics rather than the forums of
race or academics.
Given their rigorous training
schedules, athletes must strive dou
bly to achieve academically, and
when the student's community is
underprivileged, the burden grows
three-fold.
But in spite of these constant
struggles for the athlete, the NCAA
cannot let up on its academic
requirements. There must be some
basic academic standard to motivate
athletes off the field. It is a hard fact
that most college athletes will not be
able to compete on the professional

level, and if they are taught nothing
about achievement in the world out
side of sports, then organizations
such as the NCAA are doing a great
disservice to society.
An academic standard can be any
number of things; the most impor
tant thing is that one exists. The stan
dard could continue being the SAT,
perhaps with a different combined
score. It could also be an examina
tion developed by the NCAA itself
and approved by a committee repre
senting a broad range of communi
ties.
It will always be more of a chal
lenge for underprivileged student
tathletes to concentrate on aca
demics, whether the goal is an N2O on
the SAT or a 2.5 GPA. So it is up to
teachers, coaches and parents to
motivate their students academical
ly-
The same amount of effort that is
put into attacking the SAP's prac
tices might be put into helping stu
dents prepare for that test. The ques
tion is, which effort will help the stu
dents more in the long run?
At Stanford, the final appeals
court decision will have a minimal
effect. Athletes here go though an
application process with higher stan
dards than the ones in question, and
the rigor of academics is such that
athletes cannot disregard them when
considering attendance.
This is not to say that we should
ignore the NCAA's efforts. Stanford
has a great number of well-rounded
student-athletes who come from var
ious backgrounds. High schoolers
around the country can look to these
people as role models for success.
Certainly our recruiting coaches and
traveling athletes can actively
inspire youngsters to focus on their
studies. We can work to make it
clear to them that academics and
athletics are equally important.
