Mexican-American is an all
encompassing category
I am troubled bv Ms. Torres' response to
the piece by Gil Lopez ("What's my her
itage") because it reminds me how society
forces many of us to forget our heritage to
conform to "American ideals." In conform
ing to those ideals, many are forced to dis
tance themselves from their ethnic commu
nities.
Power to you both for thinking the way
you do. Hut understand that I express my
culture in a different manner. I respect your
decision not to wave the Mexican flag and
spread "Lit Raza rhetoric," and I expect
that the same respect be accorded to me.
Do not generalize about people like
myself. I am not wrapped in a Mexican flag;
as a matter of fact I do not even belong to
MEChA, and I don't go around preaching
about latinos. By attacking student activists
you are making blanket generalizations
about a community we all belong to.
Like many of us, I am proud of being
Mexican just as I am proud of being Amer
ican. I feel a great sense of pride when I
hear the American national anthem and
often find myself singing along. However, I
also feel a great sense of pride when I hear
the Mexican national anthem. I love eating
tacos de frijoles. I also love eating hamburg
ers.
None of these things make me more or
less Mexican-American than anyone else.
Being Mexican-American is a lot more than
what you eat, what music you listen to or
whether you speak Spanish or not.
Unlike Mr. Lopez, my ethnicity is very
important to me. I grew up in Oxnard. a

small agricultural town in California. I was
surrounded by Mexicans all of my life, and
my identity is very much attached to my eth
nicity. Being Mexican-American has always
been a part of my life, and celebrating my
cultural traditions comes naturally to me.
I too have traditional Mexican parents
who passed on their values. Every day I am
reminded of how hard they work to give
their eight children the opportunity to
achieve their dreams. They taught me to
always be proud of who I am and where I
come from, and that helped to shape me
into the person I am today. For me each day
is a celebration of my culture.
I am very proud of the fact that I am at
Stanford. I also recognize that perhaps I am
here in part due to affirmative action. But I
know for a fact that I deserve to be here and
that I worked just as hard and am just as
bright as the next Stanford student. I owe
my presence at Stanford to affirmative
action as well as to the countless others who
struggled to institute programs to increase
minority presence on American college
campuses. I pay respect to those people who
paved the way for me to come here.
1 invite you to visit Centro Chicano
and Casa Zapata and join some organiza
tions to see that we do not all fit into a neat
box of what being Chicano means. I chal
lenge you to go beyond your comfort zone
and confront those people that you most
seem to criticize, and get to know why they
chose to express themselves the way they
do. Then maybe you can understand that it
is not our differences that divide us but that
those same differences can actually unite us.
As Cesar Chavez said. "We cannot seek
achievement for ourselves and forget about

progress and prosperity for our communi
ty. .Our ambitions must be broad enough
to include the aspirations and needs of oth
ers, for their sakes and for our own."

Success turns minorities to
abandon their communities
Ciil Lopez's piece, "What's my heritage,"
and the letter from Domino Torres sadly
perpetuates the stereotype that minority
students at Stanford are obsessed with their
"self-started" elitism and end up turning
their backs on their plighted communities.
In classes at Berkeley we discuss the neo
eonservative minority paradigm, and in gen
eral it does not surprise students here that
this phenomena is prevalent at "elite" uni
versities such as Stanford and at the Ivy
League institutions it obsessively compares
itself to.
For people like Lopez and Torres to say
that affirmative action — especially at a
place that champions it as much as Stanford
was not a factor in their admission is
inanely naive. They need to step off their
"Stanford high horse" and understand that
yes. they owe credit to the Stanford Univer
sity admissions directors who accepted
them in the name of ethnic diversity.
They must also understand that a system
with affirmative action — a policy that is
arguably flawed — is much better than a
system without affirmative action. In this
respect, Stanford is doing a much better job
than the UC system, where every student's

education is being shortchanged due to an
increasingly homogeneous student popula
tion.
Part of recognizing your cultural duality
is recognizing that social constructs (the
kind that keep schools in poor neighbor
hoods poor and allows police officers to
pull over drivers on the basis of their skin
color) are constantly working against oth
ers in the same position. Be proud of your
spin at Stanford; be proud that somewhere
along the line one special teacher or one
parent's words of encouragement made
you want to achieve at the level you have,
but do not be proud to the point where you
scorn the very communities you managed
to escape from, where not everyone has
your extremely fortunate circumstances.
Meanwhile, right-wingers will cling to
these ideas and use them to promote their
agendas. How sad that minorities who get
to elitist institutions like Stanford — so
tight-lipped and far from America's desper
ately crumbling urban minority enclaves —
reject the notion of community altruism.
For me, an education with socially con
scious peers is much more important than
an a good-looking diploma.
The majority of Chicano students at
Berkeley are more concerned with making
a difference — if at least a minor difference,
in a classroom or in public policy — to help
their communities achieve the "American
dream" than the notoriously self-improv
ing. "reputation"-baiting students of Stan
ford.
