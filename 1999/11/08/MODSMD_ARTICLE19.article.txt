Most of the
females on cam
pus are probably
baffled by the male dedi
cation to sports. For exam
ple, the guy who lives next
door to you probably
wouldn't wake up at a.m.

on a Sunday even if he was scheduled to eat
breakfast with Jesus, lie's probably so la/y
that he wouldn't run 50 feet to the nearest
bathroom if he had to urinate and his blad
der was going to explode.
Yet for some inexplicable reason, this
same guy will wake up at V a.m. on a week
end and spend the next two hours sprinting
up and down the intramural football field
faster than Carl Lewis on speed. So why in
the world do your male friends act this way?
In order to answer this question we must
look at the history of sports-.
Prior to 1N97. there were only two major
sports: baseball and holy wars. Interest in
baseball waned in the early l l M)s when its
fan base was attracted to the more exciting
and fast-paced sport of sloth racing. Interest
in holy wars substantially decreased in 1207.
when Sir Galahad Jonesforth (the greatest
holv warrior of all time) retired prematurely
alter single-handedly winning six of the last
eight holy crusades.
In the post-World War II era, there has
been an unprecedented boom in the number
of big-time sports. Some of the more novel
and original sports that men have invented
are: soccer-foot ball. American football,
Canadian football. Arena football. World
League football, Australian football, Texas
high school football and the street luge.
Some of the sports we have invented arc so

idiotic (NASCAR) that we have had to cre
ate entirely new regions of the country to
support them (the South).
"Why so many sports?" you ask. The
answer is simple. In a Utopian male world,
every male would be a professional athlete.
By creating as many big-time sporting
events as possible, we are increasing the
number of males that can be big-time ath
letes. If we can maintain our current rate of
sports growth, every male alive will be a pro
fessional athlete by 2027.
Many of you are hoping that this obses
sion with sports will decline with age. I guar
antee that this will not happen. My
irrefutable evidence is the Graduate School
of Business and its invincible IM teams.
Why is the GSB so good? It's because
GSB students devote all of their time to two
activities. First they spend 12 hours a day
trying to figure out whether they should pur
"dhasS an Audi Trfit a Porsche Bflftfter, and
second they spend 12 hours a day practicing
for IM sports. GSB students never sleep.
The only source of energy they require is
motor oil. They drink at least eight quarts of
it a day.
When I was a freshman I made the mis
take of playing in an IM basketball game
against the GSB. I was in the game for 10
short minutes. In that span, the player I was
guarding scored 27 points, grabbed 13
rebounds, stole all of my credit card num
bers and duped me into signing up for BMG
Music Services' "Friends 4 Free" CD club.
Three years later, I still can't get BMCi to
stop sending me its monthly special selec
tion. The GSB student, on the other hand, is
probably cruising through the foothills in his
brand new Audi TT, happily listening to his

four free CDs.
You would think that the referees at IM
games would mitigate the hyper-competi
tiveness that I have described. Nothing
could be further from the truth. Stanford IM
referees consider anything short of a double
homicide to be "incidental contact."
Last year, when I was a player / coach for
Junipero's IM football team. I substituted a
Nissan Pathfinder for our regular running
back. The Pathfinder rushed for 322 yards
on six carries. It also committed at least eight
personal fouls and five counts of reckless
driving, and it supressed potentially damag
ing information on the addictive qualities of
nicotine. Despite all of this, the officials
never penalized the Pathfinder. They did,
however, fine me $25 because it did not pos
sess the proper East Side parking permit.
As a final warning, if your sports-crazed
male friends begin to purchase creatine
monohydrate, they are a lost cause. Creatine
is a nutritional supplement that supposedly
builds muscle. It costs approximately
$1(),(KK) per gram. So the same guy that
won't spend five extra dollars to buy you a
hepatitis-free dinner is probably spending
the balance of his tuition money at GNC on
creatine. Does creatine work? Yes, it does.
Creatine works by dissolving the brain and
transforming it into muscle mass.
It's time for Sports Center. See you next
Monday.
