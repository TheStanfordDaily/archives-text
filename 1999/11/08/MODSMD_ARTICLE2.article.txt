### Anuj Gupta Editorial staff 
A wide swath of East Campus
will remain dark when the sun rises
tomorrow morning, as an electrical
outage related to the construction
of new graduate housing in Escon
dido Village will affect nearly 700
students in University residences.
The outage, which will strike the
Manzanita Park residences of Kim
ball, Lantana and Castano. Schwab
Residential Center and their dining
halls, will begin at 7 a.m. and is ex

pected to last until 1 p.m. and will re
sult in modified lunch service in the
Manzanita Dining Commons.
In an e-mail sent nut to all resi
dents in these houses, students were
informed that they would have no
electricity tomorrow morning, and
were advised to shut off computers
and use battery-powered alarm
clocks. They were also told to ex
pect a diminished hot water supply.
According to Student Housing
Services Director Rodger Whitney,
the power shutdown is a required
and routine part of the construction

process.
"This has to happen now in order
for us to make connections to bring
up new electrical power and water
power for the graduate housing
across [Campus Drive]," he said.
"We have had this happen be
fore ... and it will happen when we
build new housing again."
While Whitney noted that the
outage would ideally have been
planned for Winter Break, he said
the timing is essential.
