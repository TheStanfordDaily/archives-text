# Manzanita to stay dark at dawn
## 
### Anuj Gupta Editorial staff 
A wide swath of East Campus
will remain dark when the sun rises
tomorrow morning, as an electrical
outage related to the construction
of new graduate housing in Escon
dido Village will affect nearly 700
students in University residences.
The outage, which will strike the
Manzanita Park residences of Kim
ball, Lantana and Castano. Schwab
Residential Center and their dining
halls, will begin at 7 a.m. and is ex

pected to last until 1 p.m. and will re
sult in modified lunch service in the
Manzanita Dining Commons.
In an e-mail sent nut to all resi
dents in these houses, students were
informed that they would have no
electricity tomorrow morning, and
were advised to shut off computers
and use battery-powered alarm
clocks. They were also told to ex
pect a diminished hot water supply.
According to Student Housing
Services Director Rodger Whitney,
the power shutdown is a required
and routine part of the construction

process.
"This has to happen now in order
for us to make connections to bring
up new electrical power and water
power for the graduate housing
across [Campus Drive]," he said.
"We have had this happen be
fore ... and it will happen when we
build new housing again."
While Whitney noted that the
outage would ideally have been
planned for Winter Break, he said
the timing is essential.
"There is only a certain window
of time in which you can do this, or
else the project gets substantially
delayed."
Some students in these resi
dences have expressed displeasure
at the consequences of the outage.
The outage occurs during the
hours when most students wake up
on weekdays, leading some to
worry about the possibility of over
sleeping without a functioning
alarm clock.
Sophomore Jerri Kay, who lives
in Lantana, protested the decision
in an e-mail sent to Housing Ser
vices as well as her dorm.
She said she voiced her discon
tent because she feels the morning
outage presents a "major inconve
nience to students."
"To be confronted without
power when you're trying to get up
for class in the morning is unreason
able. To schedule something as
major as a power outage during a
regular school day makes me ques
tion who is making the decisions in
that office," Kay said.
However, Whitney called the
morning timing "logical" because
the "goal is to start as early as you
can, get finished as quickly as you
can" during the day to allow for ad
equate response time in the event of
anv complications.
* "[ln] most of our shutdowns,
[electricity] has come back earlier
than scheduled ... but should there
be any problems or delays, we want
to be sure that there's a response
team to address them," he said.
The outage also will affect food
service at Manzanita.
According to Bruce Biron, the
Manzanita chef manager, refriger

ated and frozen foods will be prop
erly safeguarded against spoiling.
"Everything will be secured in
the morning. No one will be allowed
to open the fridges and freezers, and
all temperatures will be reduced in
the coolers. It should keep every
thing safe," Biron said.
Manzanita, which normally op
erates on an a la carte points system,
will offer an all-you-can-eat buffet
service for lunch tomorrow that is
being promoted as the "Blackout
Barbecue," featuring outdoor grill
service.
Whitney said students need not
worry about food and dairy prod
ucts spoiling in their personal refrig
erators during the outage.
"In most cases you have quite a
period of time before you run the
risk of real problems with things
that need to be refrigerated. [Spoil
ing] will not be a factor," he said.
Despite the complaints, most
students living in the affected resi
dences appear to be willing to ac
cept the temporary outage.
Kimball resident Cindy Fung, a
sophomore, said she does not see
the outage "as anything more than a
pain that has to be endured for a lit
tle while so they can do whatever
work it is that needs to get done."
"In general, I think Manzanita
residents should be able to put up
with it and separate themselves
from their high-tech lives for a few
hours," Fung added.
Whitney said he anticipates most
students will be understanding and
cooperative.
"While no one likes to experi
ence this and we don't want to have
to do this, it's one of the parts of get
ting new housing for students on
campus," he said.
"Our planning so far has tried to
minimize inconvenience and dis
comforts for students."
