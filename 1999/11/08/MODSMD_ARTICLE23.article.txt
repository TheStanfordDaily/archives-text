MEN'S SWIMMING
â–  Friday: No. 3 Texas I3N, No. I

"A dual meet against a team like
Texas is always interesting," said
freshman John Waters. "They're so
strong and so deep."
Junior Steven Brown agreed.
"We were pretty happy with our
performance," he said. "Texas just
had a lot more depth."
Despite the Cardinal's successful
efforts in several of the individual
races. Texas managed to chalk up
m m> ol tlicit points in both relavs
and ili\ ing.
The Longhorns won both the 400-
mcter free relay and the 4(H) medley
iclay. beating Slanloid's niedltv
relay team of junior Anthony Robin
son. sophomore Jeff Guyman. and
freshmen Randall Bal and Dan

Wescott.
Bryan Jones and Jon Young
house of Texas also had strong per-
Ibrmances. Jones showed well in the
sprints, winning the 50 and 100
freestyles. Younghouse lived up to
his reputation as a powerful distance
racer, winning the 1.000 freestyle
ahead of Brown and Cardinal sopho
more Reid Gustin.
Troy Dumais of Texas turned in a
very strong diving performance that
also contributed to the Texas point
total, winning both the one-meter
and three-meter diving events, and
receiving an automatic NCAA
championship appearance for the
three-meter dive.
"It was a little bit of a disappoint
ment." Waters said of the loss. "But a
lot of good things came out of it. We
had some really good times, and a lot
of guys swam really well."
Juniors Rob Canales and Adam
Messner continued to lead the team,
winning two events each. Canales
won both the 200 individual medley
and the 200 breaststroke. receiving
NCAA championship provisional

2(H) freestyle also gave him a provi
sional qualifying time for the NCAA

as would any top program in the
country. Stanford realizes that most
of the season and time for improve
ment still lie ahead. The team will use
this loss as motivation to propel itself
even closer to perfection.

"We were pleased with some of
the things we did, and we took what
we could." said Waters. "Now we
know what we need to work on. It's
back to the drawing boards now."
Stanford will meet up with Cana
dian powerhouse and defending
Canadian national champion Uni
versity of British Columbia for the
