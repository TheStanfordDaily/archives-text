Which is more beneficial, giving a man a
fish or teaching him how to fish?
According to Ethiopian-born billionaire
Noah Samara, teaching and giving people
the necessary information to better their
lives is one of the most important things a
human being can do in this life.
Samara, chairman, CEO and founder of
the World Space Corporation, spoke to
about 1 (K) last Friday night at Kresge Audi
torium. Samara was the keynote speaker at
the Stanford Ethiopian Student Union's first
Pioneers Forum, designed to give the Stan
ford community an opportunity to hear indi
viduals who are using cutting-edge technol
ogy to increase global, economic and educa
tional advancements.
Samara came to Stanford to speak about
his plan to deliver satellite radio to over 4.6
billion people throughout the Third World.
"The World Space mission is to create in
formation affluence by using new audio
technology to deliver programming to the
three-quarters of the world's population
that today lacks adequate radio reception
and program choice and that wants news,
knowledge and entertainment of the highest
quality at an affordable cost," said Samara.
On Oct. 19, Samara's dream came closer
to reality when the World Space Corpora
tion launched the world's largest digital
audio broadcast system on their Afristar
satellite, inaugurating a satellite radio ser
vice that will transmit a wide variety of mul
tilingual radio programming across the en

tire African continent for the first time. In
the future. Samara plans to launch two more
satellites to provide similar services to Asia
and Latin America.
"Unlike many of his status, Noah Samara
has chosen to focus on the people who need
help the most," said Liben Eabisa, member
of the Ethiopian Student Union. "He has
opened the Third World's eyes to technolo
gy to advance the social and economic glob
al community."
At age 34, Samara's vision for an infor
mation-rich society in the poverty and dis
ease stricken Third World led him to leave a
lucrative law career and create World Space
in 1990.
"One day. I was reading an article in the
Washington Post about how quickly AIDS
was spreading throughout Africa," Samara
said. "Many Africans believed AIDS was a
curse and did not know that it could be pre
vented. These people needed the informa
tion to control this disease, and I believed
that I could help them."
Samara believes spreading information
can solve many of the Third World's prob
lems.
"Behind the wealth of people and the
wealth of nations, the most irreducible ele
ment is information," said Samara. "If we
are able to deliver information, it will create
affluence and initiate the development of
Africa and other Third World nations."
The Afristar satellite will broadcast more
than 50 channels of local, regional and inter
national programming over Africa and the
Middle East.
In order to get this information, residents

of Africa and the Middle East must purchase
one of four receivers made by JVC, Hitachi,
Panasonic and Sanyo, ranging in cost from
$250 to $4<X).
While this price might seem awfully high
for people in the Third World, Samara said
that more than 300 million people in his tar
get audience can already afford a receiver.
In addition. Samara reassured the audience
that the price would decrease as more re
ceivers are sold and when the market opens
up to more manufacturers.
However. Samara is more concerned
about the people who cannot afford a re
ceiver. For this reason, he has started the
World Space Foundation and has worked
with other foundations to get receivers in
schools and rural areas.
While helping the Third World is defi
nitely a worthwhile cause, some people in
the audience said they doubted the practi
cality of Samara's plan.
"Its a noble idea but I doubt it will work,"
said freshman Filip Krsmanovic. "I've lived
in Zambia and have seen the schools there.
They don't have books, chairs or even teach
ers, and Samara wants them to buy comput
ers and $400 receivers. It's too big a step."
Midway through his address. Samara's
speech changed from an informative lecture
about the World Space Organization to an
inspirational talk to motivate the audience
to help the Third World.
"Trying is a euphemism for failure,"
Samara said. "At the end of the day, you've
either done something or you haven't. It is in
our hands to give information affluence to
Africa."
