I he second installment in the
Presidential Lectures series will
deal with alternative views of art
history. Art historian and writer
Svctlana Alpers will address "What
Are We I ooking For? Fxpectations
in Art History" tonight at 7 p.m. in
Room 2 ( >o at the I aw School.
Alpers, who has taught art histo
ry at IJ(-Berkeley since 1%2. is
known lor her work on Dutch paint
ing and her unconventional scholar
ship.
She has written hooks on I iepo
lo. Rembrandt and Rubens, among
others.
Michael Marrinan. associate
professor of art history, said Alpers
is known for her belief in the "irre
ducibility" of visual art to language.
Some view visual art as just an
other kind of text, one understand
able in terms of metaphor, allegory
and so forth. Alpers, on the other
hand, emphasizes the visual, non

linguistic response.
Although Alpers, too. "turns the
work into language," she is "very
conscious of that |irreducible] qual
ity," Marrinan said.
Marrinan explained his point
with a comparison of Shakespeare's
"I lamlet" and Raphael's Madonna.
While one can study "Hamlet"
without Shakespeare's original
manuscript, it matters very much
when one studies the "Madonna"
that one sees the original piece.
Marrinan said.
"It is considered necessary to see
[it | in person," lie said. I hese works
"have a powerful presence not re
duced to language."
Works such as Raphael's
Madonna "can be reproduced, but
they are not reproducible" in the
sense that a slide or reproduction is
not the real thing. Marrinan said.
According to an essay by Alex
Ross on the Presidential Lectures
Web site. Alpers's book "Hie Art of
Describing" argues against conven
tional wisdom that lie-Id that Dutch

painting was best understood by in
terpreting whole works by referring
to the emblems in the piece.
Alpers asserted that Dutch
painting was descriptive rather than
narrative, rendering such analyses
undesirable.
According to Ross, Alpers's
book on Rembrandt, titled "Rem
brandt's Enterprise: the Studio and
the Market," was both controversial
and well-received.
Hv casting Rembrandt's work in
light of economic pressures. Ross
writes, Alpers made her reviewers
"uncomfortable."
Marrinan said one of the issues
Alpers will address in her talk is the
place of art history in the university.
"Why does art history have a
space in the university? [How does
it | share in the legitimate interpreta
tive endeavor of the university?"
Marrinan said.
A graduate of Radcliffe College
and Harvard University, Alpers is
now Professor Emerita at IJC-
Bcrkclev.
