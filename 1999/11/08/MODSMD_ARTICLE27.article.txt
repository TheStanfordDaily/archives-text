# System still suffers from uncertainty, inequality
## South African schools troubled 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
David Woods, vice chancellor
of Rhodes University in South
Africa, presented his thoughts on
"Retrofitting South Africa's Ail
ing Educational System" on Fri
day as a part of a lecture scries
sponsored by the African and
Afro-American Studies Program.
Approximately 30 people at
tended the event, which was free
and open to the public. Linguistics
Prof. John Rickford introduced
Woods, who is a microbiologist
and holds a doctorate from Oxford
University.
Woods discussed the structure
of the South African educational
system, as well as challenges many
educators in South African higher
education face.
"South African education is at a
challenging point in time right
now, and its future depends on ac
tions we take now," Woods said.
Woods prefaced his discussion
of problems within the education
al system by outlining the structure
of South African universities and
"technicons," which Woods says
arc similar to American communi
ty colleges but "focus on technical
degrees" and prepare students vo
cationally for the "technical needs
of the workplace."
South African institutions are
usually divided into four cate
gories: historically black universi
ties, historically white universities.

English universities and "dis
tance" universities. These cate
gories have changed in the post
apartheid era, Woods said, though
major problems and issues still
linger.
Woods said that universities
and technicons are funded by a
system which takes into account
the number of students at the insti
tution from two years back.
"The 2001 budget for a univer
sity, then, would be based on 1999
figures," Woods said. "If you drop
students, there are major implica
tions for the future of your institu
tion."
The South African educational
system is, according to Woods,
about three-to-six years away from
a new funding system which
Woods said will be "helpful," be
cause "you don't know until the
start of the university year what
budgets are, which is difficult if
you are a vice chancellor trying to
plan."
"Often, the problem in South
Africa is that we have first-world
policies in a third-world environ
ment." Woods said.
Woods cited falling numbers of
students matriculating to college
as one of the most serious prob
lems facing South African univer
sities. In 1999 there was a 45-per
cent drop in students attending
universities and technicons.
Woods said that despite govern
ment financial aid. which in 1999
provided $390 million in grants.

"black students found it difficult to
pay fees."
"Many black students would
like to go to college and are quali
fied, but cannot because of the
fees," he said.
However, he did say that black
student numbers had increased in
1999, but that white student num
bers had decreased.
Woods then discussed specific
policies at Rhodes, saying that he
feels his university has done "a
good job with students," in that
there is a fairly even mix of black
and white students. However,
Woods said the "staff is still large
ly white," and the small numbers
of black students who enter acade
mia make it difficult to increase
staff member numbers.
Woods said right now, South
Africa is "in a vacuum in terms of
quality in higher education," how
ever, that with an increased em
phasis on technicons as valuable
institutions and a re-vamping of fi
nances available to universities,
strides toward improvements
could be made.
Junior Joy Hsu. who attended
the speech, said that she enjoyed
the event. "1 thought it was an illu
minating presentation of the high
er educational system of South
Africa," Hsu said. "Because issues
of race and ethnicity here are usu
ally thought of in an American
context, it was nice to get a com
parative perspective from another
nation."
