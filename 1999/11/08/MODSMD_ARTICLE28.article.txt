2. Stanford 0

In its last two games of regular
season play, the Cardinal notched a
2-0 win against UC-Santa Barbara
(12-7) on Saturday, only to fall 2-1) to
No. 0 St. Louis (15-2-2) a day later.
A win over St. Louis would have
made Stanford a lock for the NCAA
tournament and boosted the Cardi

nal's chances of a home game in th£'
first round.
Looking to finalize its NCAA
tournament plans, the Cardinal put
forth a strong effort against the BiP
likens, hut just could not seem to put
the ball in the back of the net.
According to head coach Bobby
Clark, assistant coach Brian Wiese
put it best when he said, "We weren't»
beaten today, but we lost."
Despite the loss. Stanford's final'
record should be good enough for a.'
berth in the tournament. Last
the Cardinal received a first-round (
home game with an almost identical•
record of 14-4-2. The NCAA will an-*
nounce the final bracket for the tour--
nament on Nov. 15.
On Saturday, Stanford started
on fire, scoring the only goals of thy
match in the first 25 minutes. The de
tense held on the rest of the way to
give the Cardinal, and senior goal
keeper Adam Zapala, its ninth
shutout of the season.
Junior midfielder Ryan Nelsen
spurred the Cardinal attack, assisting
on both goals.
In the 18th minute, Nelsen sent a
header dangerously near the net,
forcing Santa Barbara's senior goal
keeper Stewart Sanders to make a
diving save, only to have junior for
ward Corey Woolfolk knock in the
rebound.
Just six minutes later Nelsen
volleyed in another threatening shot
that was finished by junior forward
Luke Rust for his team-leading eigth
goal of the season.
Although Rust's shot rounded out
the scoring, Stanford continued to
control the game, outshooting the
Gauchos 14-6. Rust led the shooting

effort with six shots.
Most notable among the Cardi
nal's missed chances was on a series
of corner kicks in the second half. Se
nior defenders Gerard Davis and
Andy Hemmerich sent in a few well
placed balls that were either shot into
the post or chipped over the net to the
dismay of the rushing Cardinal at
tack.
"It was not one of our better per
formances," Clark said, "but having
said that, I can't recall a chance that
[UCSB] really had. I think we've just
set our standards higher."
"We weren't holding the ball well,
and that hurt us," Woolfolk said. "It
was an important result, we didn't
play our best, but we got the job done
and at this point in the season that's
all that matters."
Saturday's game was just a warm
up for Sunday's match against the
powerful St. Louis Billikens, who
share the Conference USA title with
Alabam-Birmingham. The Billikens,
who boast six players with double

digit point totals, promised a chal
lenge, and while the Cardinal met
that challenge, it fell victim to a cou
ple of lucky breaks that went St.
Louis' way.
"In the first half we put together
an excellent team performance. I
couldn't have asked for more," Clark
said. "We just had a couple of mental
lapses that got the goals."
Just as the Cardinal had done to
the Gauchos, the Billikens scored
twice in the first half to round out the
scoring. The Cardinal could not come
up with an answer, but it wasn't for
lack of trying.
Stanford created chances includ
ing a shot by redshirt junior defender
Chris Gores that was cleared on the
goal line by a Billiken defender, and
another by senior co-captain T.K. In
body that skimmed just over the
crossbar.
"We learned an important les
son," Clark said. "You can dominate
the game, but you can't give good
teams opportunites."
