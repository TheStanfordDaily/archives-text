# Land use plan divides community
## Students, locals fight to keep foothills free of development

Stanford's Sept. 20 release of a
Draft Community Plan and General
Use Permit Application has resulted
in fierce criticism of the University's
methods and objectives.

graduate student coordinator of

SOSA. "As a student very involved

wasn't aware of Stanford's plans until
