# Land use plan divides community
## Students, locals fight to keep foothills free of development 
### Nadira Hira Contributing writer 
Stanford's Sept. 20 release of a
Draft Community Plan and General
Use Permit Application has resulted
in fierce criticism of the University's
methods and objectives.
The plan, which proposes some 4
million square feet of development,
roused a Hurry of action from Bay
Area environmental groups, local
residents and a number of under
graduate organizations, as well as
The San Jose Mercury News and
other area newspapers.
With the new plan scheduled to be
released on Nov. 15, these groups say
they hope to raise enough awareness
to influence changes in the new draft
and future versions.
ASSU Undergraduate Senate

Chair Steve Aronowitz said that the
University made efforts to inform the
ASSU of its plans, but that the coun
ty-mandated forums were held over
the summer and generally off-cam
pus, making it difficult for many stu
dents to attend.
As a result, the umbrella student
group formed around this issue, the
Stanford Open Space Alliance, only
had its first student meeting Oct. 20.
Since then, it has collected more than
2,CKX) signatures calling for foothill
protection, more than >00 of which
were undergraduate signatures.
"1 think these signatures make it
clear that there are great amounts of
student support for foothill protec
tion, especially considering that they
were gathered with minimal tabling
hours," said Cancel Fraser, under
graduate student coordinator of

SOSA. "As a student very involved
in campus life, 1 think the fact that I
wasn't aware of Stanford's plans until
recently is indicative of negligence on
Stanford's part in bringing under
graduates into the planning process."
The conflict over Stanford's land
use plan stretches far beyond the un
dergraduate population. Issues such
as Stanford's treatment of the envi
ronment. its credibility in its dealings
with the community and its rights as a
private landowner have been the
subject of heated debate for months.
Stanford's responsibility
One of the central concerns of the
plan's critics is preserving Stanford's
foothills, which have been designat
ed by Ihe University as "Academic
Reserve." land which may be used as
open space now, but which is open to
other uses in the future.
C ritics contend that Stanford has
been irresponsible with the land
under this designation, and they fear
future misuse.
The new reservoir being built near
the Dish is one point of contention.
" I he reservoir is being built in re
sponse to a state request for Stanford
to increase its supply of water for
emergency purposes," said Stan
lord's Director of Government and
Community Relations Larry Horton.
"The concept of academic reserve
is that the lands are being held for ul
timate academic use as necessary.
> This does not preclude other uses,
such as a reservoir, in the interim."
Geological and Earth Sciences
Prof. Elizabeth Miller said she took
issue with the way Stanford has been
carrying out these uses. "The new
reservoir they put in is huge, and
there has been quite a bit of land
scape and environmental degrada
tion with the construction," she said.
"Specifically, I have seen semi trucks
drive right up the side of grass-cov
. ered hills, putting in some serious new
. deep tracks where these did not exist
before.
"It will be a major project to re
store this region to its pre-construc
tion state. Will they do it?" Miller
asked. "What does this mean in terms
of how Stanford feels about and
treats its 'open space"?"
Other critics question Stanford's
credibility. Many say Stanford delib
erately misled the community by dis
tributing public relations documents
' that misrepresent the University's
plans, choosing not to distribute in
' formation that would be useful to the
public in making informed decisions
and choosing not to publicize this
issue with the undergraduate popula
-1 tion.
"Stanford is not being direct with
respect to the information they're
' giving to the public," said David

Smernoff of NASA Ames Research
Center, who sat on the Board of Di
rectors of the Mid-Peninsula Region
al Open Space District and is a Stan
ford alumnus with a doctorate in ecol
ogy-
"Many of the maps are illegible
and inconsistent. A university like
Stanford, one of the leading institu
tions in the world, ought to be able to
put out legible and consistent maps."
Some have pointed specifically to
the differences between the actual
Draft Community Plan and GUP and
the "Explanatory Document For
Public Review and Comment" dis
tributed by the University.
The Explanatory Document, ac
cording to the University, "presents
key details on Stanford's land use
plans as presented in the Draft Com
munity Plan and General Use Permit
Application ... as well as some relat
ed supplementary information."
According to Horton, several
thousand copies of this document
were made and circulated widely to
the public.
"There are no large discrepancies
between the explanatory document,
the Draft Community Plan and the
draft GUP application," said Horton.
"Everything in the explanatory docu
ment is consistent with the other doc
uments. The difference is that the ex
planatory document contains more
information — but not inconsistent
information — to explain the context
of the draft formal documents."
One difference cited by critics is
the inclusion of endangered species in
the Explanatory Document when
they are not mentioned in the actual
Draft Community Plan.
The Explanatory Document
states, "Stanford will designate spe
cial areas for preservation of endan
gered species and habitat conserva
tion and will work with State and Fed
eral fish and wildlife and environ
mental protection agencies to accom
plish these objectives," but the actual
DCP does not specifically provide for
this anywhere.
Horton said this could be inferred
from the DCP.
"In the Sept. 20 draft, Stanford
adopted by reference all the county

provisions tor resource conservation
and for health and safety. We ex
plained in our explanatory document
some special Stanford programs for
endangered species. There is no in
consistency here," he said.
He added that these matters will
be addressed in "much more detail"
in the Nov. 15 plan.
In addition to this matter, the map
used in the Explanatory Document
contains six land designations instead
of the four used in the actual plan.
Lands listed solely as Academic Re
serve and Open Space in the DCP are
broken into three distinct categories
— Conservation, Teaching and Re
search, Institutional Support and
Community Plan Open Space — in
the Explanatory Document.
Critics, such as Peter Drekmeier,
the regional director of SOSA. say
that designations like Community
Plan Open Space within the Academ
ic Reserve and Open Space category
mislead the public into believing that
this land is actually designated as per
manent open space, which it is not.
Horton said. "The map in the ex
planatory document is accurate; it
covers a different subject than the
maps in the community plan. But 1 do
acknowledge that using this accurate
map rather than another accurate
map was confusing. Remember, dif
ferent maps show different things."
The map used in the DCP was ti
tled "Stanford Community Plan Fu
ture Land Use." The map in the Ex
planatory Document was titled "Fu
ture Land Use."
Finally, many say Stanford has
only sought out community input as a
public relations device. The San Jose
Mercury News ran an editorial on
Sept. 21 entitled "'Trust us' — Stan
ford says development plan ignores
the community's overriding message
on open space."
The editorial accused the Univer
sity of ignoring outside input and said
this was typical of Stanford's dealings
with the public in such matters.
Horton disagreed, saying there
was extensive documentation of
Stanford's community outreach in
terms of polls, explanatory docu
ments distributed to the public and

forums held by the county, the timing
of which was not decided by the Uni
versity.
Stanford in the next 1(1 years
Critics' primary concern at this point,
according to Drekmeier, is securing a
permanent open space designation
for the foothill land Stanford owns.
A permanent open space designa
tion is different from the Academic
Reserve label, which leaves future
use up to the University.
In defining Academic Reserve,
Horton said, "The over S.(KK) acres of
land that Stanford was given to the
University by the Stanfords for the
sole purpose of establishing a univer
sity and to support that university.
"We have a Board of Trustees that
has to take care of that, so it is the duty
of Trustees to use Stanford land to
support the university. Lands that we
use for other purposes right now can
always be used for academic purpos
es later," he continued.
Most everyone agrees that, by this
definition, there is no permanent
open space on Stanford land.
"The way Stanford has phrased
the plan is as a sort of a promise not to
develop for the next 10 years. It's
questionable whether the county can
enforce a promise. There's some
thing to [having a promise], but there
are definitely questions." said Tom
Jordan, a retired environmental land
use attorney, former President of the
Committee for Green Foothills and a
Palo Alto resident.
"[Stanford should plan] not to de
velop this land and [it should be]
zoned not to be developed. That's
what should happen, not a promise."
Drekmeier. Jordan and Denice
Dade, the legislative advocate for the
Committee for Green Foothills, all
stressed that the academic reserve
designation leaves the potential for
unlimited growth.
"Academic reserve and open
space are two different things," said
Dade. "Nobody else in the county
gets to ... designate everything as
academic reserve and continue
growth indiscriminately."
1 lorton recognized the large po

tential for growth inherent in the aca
demic reserve designation, but point
ed out that, after hearing the public's
request for an academic growth
boundary, the planning committee
was considering formally establishing
such a boundary in the Nov. 15 draft
of the plan.
"What happens after the plan is
the big debate, and that has to come
in the process for the next plan," I lor
ton said.
Many of the plan's critics say they
don't want to wait another decade.
"Now is the time to bargain,"
Drekmeier said. "Four million
square feet is a lot of development
and ... we're saying let's allow Stan
ford the infill on campus, but that, as
a tradeoff, Stanford should set the
foothills as permanent open space.
Let's treat Stanford as any other de
veloper — you get something, you
give something back."
"We do not agree that as a matter
of policy or law that any such trade
off is warranted or necessary," Mor
ton responded.
1 lorton points out that Stanford
has remained in compliance with the
California Environmental Quality
Act. which requires any project that
needs government approval to evalu
ate environmental impact and either
avoid or mitigate it.
Dade. Drekmeier and Jordan said
they fear that future development
plans will not go far enough to lessen
Stanford's environmental impact.
The county's responsibility
Another complaint leveled
against Stanford is what critics call the
University's special status as mea
sured against developers in the sur
rounding communities.
Critics say much of Stanford's
foothill land should fall under one of
Santa Clara County's "hillside" des
ignations. which only allows for de
veloping 10 percent of such land, with
the other W percent designated as
permanent open space.
"Since a hillside designation has
never been proposed by the county or
submitted to Stanford for review or
study. Stanford has never expressed

an opinion to it," said Horton.
Dade agreed that the county was
responsible for taking the initiative.
"At this point, it falls to the county to
take action," she said, "The county
has a lot of leverage by forcing a bar
gain and they must look at the larger
interest of the community.
"Once Stanford gave the general
vision, the county needed to take
hold of the community plan and
make it their own document," Dade
continued. "The plan that we have
right now says that it's a goal of the
county to maintain Stanford's preem
inence as a university.
"That's not the role of the county.
Santa Clara County's charter should
not include language that says it's the
role of the county to maintain Stan
ford's excellence as an institution."
Horton defended Stanford's pro
posed language for the charter.
"Stanford is important to the county
and to the nation." he said. "It has
long been recognized that Stanford's
educational and research programs
have produced great benefits to the
region and beyond. It is certainly an
appropriate objective for the county
to support high-quality educational
institutions."
Jordan focused instead on what he
said were more pressing planning
concerns. "Issues of density, safety,
conservation of resources and traffic
are all relevant to planning, not the
quality of program."
Ongoing debate
This issue will be discussed further
once the new draft of the plan is re
leased on Nov. 15. SOS A plans to
hold a rally on Nov. 16 to "celebrate
the plan if it's a good one and point
out the problems if it's not." Drek
meier said.
In addition. Joe Simidian of the
Santa Clara County Board of Super
visors will conduct another Town
1 lall Meeting on Dec. 9 at the Palo
Alto City Council Chambers.
"It's important to remember that
no one's opposing Stanford," Dade
said in reference to the plan's future.
"We're just trying to work together
for a t»ood outcome."
