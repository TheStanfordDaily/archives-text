# Grad students push for more housing

Stanford's much-debated land use plan has a special
dimension for graduate students, faculty and staff, whose
housing concerns have played a central role in the draft
ing of Stanford's Community Plan.
The regional housing shortage of the past decade has
made it difficult for Stanford graduate students, post-doc
toral students, faculty and staff to find affordable housing,
making new housing a priority for the new General Use
Permit and Community Plan.
"In talking with the administration, it became clear to
us that, outside of the 480 housing units under construc
tion now, no further housing could be built unless it was
specifically allowed for in the new GUP that was about to
be applied for," said Chris Stromberg, a member of the

Graduate Student Council.
"Grad students are given the impression that if all of
the GUP doesn't go through as is, they won't get their
housing, but that's not true," countered Peter Drekmeier,
regional director of the Stanford Open Space Alliance.
"There is definitely room to change other aspects of the
plan without changing the housing provisions. Stanford is
using [this issue] as leverage."
The plan allows for a maximum of 2,780 new housing
units. However, the plan also creates more than 2,(XK) new
jobs, which, critics point out. will bring in employees who
require housing.
According to figures provided by Stromberg, 1,9(X)
new units will be built and 683 of those will be taken up by
growth in the graduate student population.
