# Grad students push for more housing
## 
### Nadira Hira Contributing writer 
Stanford's much-debated land use plan has a special
dimension for graduate students, faculty and staff, whose
housing concerns have played a central role in the draft
ing of Stanford's Community Plan.
The regional housing shortage of the past decade has
made it difficult for Stanford graduate students, post-doc
toral students, faculty and staff to find affordable housing,
making new housing a priority for the new General Use
Permit and Community Plan.
"In talking with the administration, it became clear to
us that, outside of the 480 housing units under construc
tion now, no further housing could be built unless it was
specifically allowed for in the new GUP that was about to
be applied for," said Chris Stromberg, a member of the

Graduate Student Council.
"Grad students are given the impression that if all of
the GUP doesn't go through as is, they won't get their
housing, but that's not true," countered Peter Drekmeier,
regional director of the Stanford Open Space Alliance.
"There is definitely room to change other aspects of the
plan without changing the housing provisions. Stanford is
using [this issue] as leverage."
The plan allows for a maximum of 2,780 new housing
units. However, the plan also creates more than 2,(XK) new
jobs, which, critics point out. will bring in employees who
require housing.
According to figures provided by Stromberg, 1,9(X)
new units will be built and 683 of those will be taken up by
growth in the graduate student population.
Though graduate student housing
needs should be met, other portions
<>l the population may not fare as
well In relation to the 350 units for
hospital residents and postdoctoral
fellows, who currently have no hous
ing on campus, the expected growth
is 4X3. I he faculty and staff housing
proposed amounts to 430 units, with
an expected growth of 3( )3 faculty and
632 stall durum the next decade.

"From this, you can see thai the
grad students [still | come out quite a
bit ahead," Stromberg said.
"We do not know what the hous
ing demand v\ill be from jobs that
may be added, but it will not be 100
percent," Morton said. "What is im
portant is that Stanford is making a
major contribution to increasing the
housing stock available in the region.
"Criticisms of Stanford with re
gard to housing are strangely mis
placed," I lorton said. "By building as
much housingas it has and by propos
ing to build more. Stanford is helping

with the regional housing shortage."
Clitics, such as Drekmcicr. point
out that although no one expects
Stanford to solve the housing short
age. housing should not he used as
Stanford's primary public relations
tool since, at the end of the next
decade. Stanford's housing situation
will not have improved much.
" I hey bring up housing over and
over again because that's the only
issue they have it) work about it."
Drekmcicr said, "hut the point is that
we're not arguing with them about
that."
