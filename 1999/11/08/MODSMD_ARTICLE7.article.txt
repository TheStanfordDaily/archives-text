# Temporary post office just months away
## 
### Marisa Taylor 
Construction began last week to
create a temporary replacement for
the Stanford Post Office in order to
serve students during the post of
fice's much talked-about renova
tions.
Responding to extensive com
plaints by students regarding ineffi
ciency and long lines at the post of
fice, the construction aims to improve
slow service by increasing the si/e of
the building itself and also by dividing
services into different areas for self
service and vending machines, retail
service for purchasing envelopes and
other packaging materials and for
regular counter service.
In the meantime, the project,
which is expected to take nine to 10
months to complete, requires that

postal services be removed from the
site and conducted from a temporary
location.
The site for the temporary loca
tion will be next to Levin Field near
Florence Moore Hall and Mayfield
Avenue. According to Leonie
Mat kin. manager of property services
for the Stanford Management Com
pany. which is overseeing the pro
ject, the temporary location is ex
pected to he open for use in late De
cember.
"Work on the permanent site will
begin after that but we do not have a
schedule yet," Batkin said.
To quell student concerns about
mail security, rain and the possibility
of eliminating a field used for sports
activities with the displacement of
post office services to Levin Field,
the administration has done its best

to cater to students' needs, Batkin
said.
"Levin Field is not being closed,
nor will it be unavailable for use. ITie
temporary site is in a dirt area next to
Levin Field." said Batkin. "[A tent]
covers the structure so as to protect
customers from inclement weather.
The structure where the mail is kept
will meet all postal regulations for se
curity."
According to an Oct. 20 Stanford
Report article, the "improved per
manent site could be open by fall
2(XX)."
In addition to the more efficient
organization of the post office, im
provements will include moving the
post office boxes currently located on
the outside of the building to an in
door lobby which will be available to
students 24 hours a day.

Beginning in late December, students will no longer be able to check their mail at the Stanford Post Of
fice. Instead, they'll be directed to Levin Field, near Florence Moore Hall, for all postal services.
