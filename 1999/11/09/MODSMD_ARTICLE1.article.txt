Editor's note: This is the second in
a series of five articles detailing the
top Stanford stories of the century.
In the winter of 1992, Stanford
was thrust into the national limelight
when it was discovered that the Stan
ford Bookstore's staff enjoyed ex
travagant benefits, including pricey
cars, a vacation home, a motorhome,
a sailboat and sky-liigli salaries.
On average, the Stanford Book
store managers were given a salary
$30,000 to $40,000 greater than other
nationwide bookstore managers, in
addition to the use of the vacation
home and luxury cars free of charge.
As a gross misuse of money, the
Bookstore scandal had a very direct
impact on students in the form of el
evated prices.
The Daily broke the story, which
originally ran on Feb. 5, 1992. The
Daily was nominated for a Pulitzer
Prize for its series of stories on the
Bookstore scandal, and it made it into
the Jinal round of consideration. The
Daily remains the only college news

paper ever to make it to the final round
of Pulitzer Prize consideration.

For the last several years, the
Stanford Bookstore has been leas

according to documents obtained
by The Daily. Among the purchases
made with Bookstore funds were a
$4.341 hot tub. a $5,888 satellite dish
and a $3,681 comforter and bed
