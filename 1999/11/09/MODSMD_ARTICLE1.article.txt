# Workers reel in Bookstore perks
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the second in
a series of five articles detailing the
top Stanford stories of the century.
In the winter of 1992, Stanford
was thrust into the national limelight
when it was discovered that the Stan
ford Bookstore's staff enjoyed ex
travagant benefits, including pricey
cars, a vacation home, a motorhome,
a sailboat and sky-liigli salaries.
On average, the Stanford Book
store managers were given a salary
$30,000 to $40,000 greater than other
nationwide bookstore managers, in
addition to the use of the vacation
home and luxury cars free of charge.
As a gross misuse of money, the
Bookstore scandal had a very direct
impact on students in the form of el
evated prices.
The Daily broke the story, which
originally ran on Feb. 5, 1992. The
Daily was nominated for a Pulitzer
Prize for its series of stories on the
Bookstore scandal, and it made it into
the Jinal round of consideration. The
Daily remains the only college news

paper ever to make it to the final round
of Pulitzer Prize consideration.

For the last several years, the
Stanford Bookstore has been leas
ing a vacation home in central Cali
fornia from a consulting firm pri
vately owned and operated by the
Bookstore's top two managers.
Eldon Speed and Philip Chiara
monte.
In addition to thousands of dol
lars in lease payments made to
Speed and Chiaramonte's consult
ing firm, the Bookstore has spent
more than $69,000 to furnish the
two-story, 3,100 square-foot home,
according to documents obtained
by The Daily. Among the purchases
made with Bookstore funds were a
$4.341 hot tub. a $5,888 satellite dish
and a $3,681 comforter and bed
room set.

I .ocated in I wain llartc, Calif.,
about 125 miles southeast of Stan

National l orest. the home is made
available by the Bookstore free ol
charge to families ol many of its se
nior employees.

eral manager, and ( 'hiaramonte. its
assistant manager, the home pro
vides a dual benefit. Since IIM6.l l M6. the
house lias been al I heir disposal ;is
a vacation facility at the Book
store's expense. And. because their
consulting firm owns the property.
Speed ami ('hiaramonte w ill be the
beneficiaries when il is eventually
sold, profiling on the investment In
perhaps tens ol thousands ol dol
lars.
In the meantime, the Bookstore,
through its lease payments to the
consulting firm, has effectively
been paying oil $209.0(10 in loans
Speed and Chiarnmontc obtained
in the mill 'NOs to finance the con
struction ol the home. I heir con
suiting firm, called Colleagues
Management Serv ices, hasn't had a
client in years, according to Speed.
I he lease arrangement was dis
covered by I he Daily as part ol an
investigation ol the compensation
practices of the Bookstore, a tax
exempt, nonprofit corporation mil
independently ol the I 'diversity
and overseen by a board of dircc
tors composed ol Stanford faculty,
stall and.in some years, one or two
Stanford students.
I lisioi\ I'iol. IVtci Stansky. the
current president of the Book
store's board, contends the lease
arrangement on the I wain llartc
house is a way to supplement the
pension plans ol Speed and ( liiara

viding the Bookstore stall with "a
quite splendid' perquisite.
"()iu aim is to reward people in
the Bookstore so tli.it they can best

More than $13,000 in Mookstore
liinils have also been used to pur
chase exercise equipment, including
two I ilee\cles. a I roller treadmill
and a Slaii master. I he equipment,
according to Speed, is located in the
Mookstore's warehouse in Newark.
( alii. across the May and is
available loi the use ol the entire
Mookstore stall, he sa\s.
Mm. by far. the most unusual
compensation arrangement in the
eyes of tax experts contacted by I he
Daily stems Irom the relationship
between Speed and Chiaramonlc's
consulting firm and the Mookslore.
In addition to the arrangement
on the I wain llarte house, the
Mookstore is leasing a IIJl l JS l ) I lolida\
Rambler Imperial motor home
from Colleagues Management Scr
vices. I he motor home. too. is a\ ail
able for use ol senioi Mookstore em
ployces. Speed says, bill '"it doesn't
get as much use as ihc house docs."
Colleagues Management Sei
vices likcK paid more than $50,000
to buy the vehicle, according lo a
salesman at Dan Camels' I ravel
1 rails in Scotts Vallev. where the

the motor home was purchased. It's
not dear how much the Bookstore is
paying Speed and Chiaramonte's
consulting firm lor its use.
I he two lease arrangements with
the Bookstore are apparent!) the
onlv sources of income Colleagues
Management Services has had lor
the last several years. In an inter
view. Speed indicated thai the firm
actually did engage in consulting
work several years ago, but said he
couldn't remember the last time
they had hail a client.
Lease arrangements not disclosed
I'lie Bookstore has tailed to dis
close either lease arrangement in its
annual returns to the Internal Rev
enue Serv ice, even though there is a
question that asks specil'icallv if the
store has leased property or serv ices
from another corporation which has
officers affiliated with the Bookstore.
Speed is the chief executive offi
cer ol C olleagucs Management Ser
vices. according to a filing made
with California's Secretarv of State
m 1954. Chiaramontc is the secre
tarv and chief financial officer, and
the fathers of both Speed and

( hiaramonte arc listed as the con
suiting linn's directors.
While such lease arrangements
are not necessarily improper, the
IKS asks the question as "a tool" to
help determine whether a nonprofit
organization is involved in sell deal
ing and channeling money to ils in
sidcrs, according to IKS spokesper
son Pain MacLean.
I he IKS wouldn't comment on
the Bookstore's arrangement in
particular. But MacLean noted that
organizations that do have such
lease arrangements are supposed to
provide detailed statements to the
IKS explaining them and demon
slrating their necessity.
Chiaramonte, who signed the
Bookstore's tax return last yeai.
blamed the failure to disclose the
leases on Mark Scheffield ol Ab
bott. Stringham & Lynch, who pre
pares the Bookstore's tax returns.
Scheffield declined to comment on
the matter.
\ 'quite splendid' perk
I he lease arrangement on the
Twain Harte house, says Stanskx.
I he president of the Bookstore's
hoard, is intended as "a sort of re
tirement benefit" for Speed and
Chiaramonte, who. he says, "are
among the best college hook people
in the country." Hack in the mid
'Xl)s. when the arrangement was ap
proved, "we thought we'd he in dan
ger of losing them. I hat would have
been disastrous."
In addition, he says, the house is
a "quite splendid" perquisite loi
current staff members. "I see ii ;is a
wonderful thing."
The house has two master bed
rooms. two master bathrooms, two
additional bedrooms and one and
one-half additional bathrooms,
plus a "large playroom loi the
kids." according to I)ave I urnei ol
Dave I inner Construction, who
designed and built the house. I 'he
home. I urncr says,"was custom
built for the Stanford Bookstore"
and was designed so that two dil
lere 111 lamilies could use it simulta
neously and maintain some degree
of privacy.
Twain I larte. where the house is
located, is a small vacation rental
community with a permanent popu
lation of about 3.750. according to
Larry Abreo of the Twain I larte
Chamber of Commerce. I he area
offers skiing in the winter and golf,
fishing and boating in the summer.
Abreo says.
In April I I )N7. the Bookstore pui
chased a Laser II sailboat for use of
employees vacationing at the I wain
I larte home. I lie boat was pur
chased at Seahird Sailing in Bcrkc
ley for $3,745, according to docu
ments obtained b\ I he I)ail\.
Monthly payments entered
In an interview last week. Speed
confirmed that the Bookstore has a
long-term lease on the I wain I larte
house, but refused to discuss its

terms in much detail, saving ques
tions on the matter were an "inva
sion of privacy."
I he\ did. however,acknowledge
that the lease arrangement is suffi
cient to cover the monthly pa\ mcnts
on loans their consulting linn ob
tained to finance the house's con
struction. and that the Bookstore
pa\s all other expenses associated
with the house.
According to documents filed in
I uolumne County, where the
I wain I larte house is located. Col
leagues Management Services ob
l.lined two loans, one in PMS. the
other in P)N(>. I he combined princi
pal on the loans was $200.()(K). It is
impossible 4o determine the precise
monthly payments on the loan,
however, because the documents do
not indicate the interest rate or peri
od of repayment.
Speed and Chiaramonte would
not disclose lliis information.
(Mlier expenses the Bookstore is
likely paying include propertv lax
on the lot. which was $3.249.(>N last
year, as well as utilities, insurance
and cleaning costs. According to
Alice Stapp, a local realtor, the
same woman w ho does cleaning for
her is paid to clean the house leased
by the Bookstore.
In any event, local realtors in
I'wain I larte say it is highly unusual
for the Bookstore to be leasing such
a large home on a long-term basis. It
would have made much more sense
from the Bookstore's perspective,
the realtors say. to have purchased
the home or to have built a new
home so that the store could profit
from the investment.
"You couldn't find someone to
rent a house like that for more than
a weekend at a time." says Wayne
Stapp of Realty World bvergreen
Properties. "People here don't rent
for more than a couple months be
fore bin ing something."
\V long-term he lie lit lor lis'
In the Bookstore's case, when
the property is sold. Speed and

Chiaramonte's consulting firm will
receive the profit from the sale. The
vacation home. Speed says, is in
tended as "a short-term benelit for
the staff, and hopefully .1 long term
benefit for us."
Local realtors say that, even
given the depressed real estate mar
ket, the cm rent value ol the house is
around $400.000. One realtor.
Chucker I wining of I upo I'r >pcr
ties in l uain llarle. suggested the
house would likely sell for more
than $S(K 1.0(H).

"Hack in 1 C >S4 we had a client."
Speed says. Me wouldn't say who
the client was, or even w hat kind ol
consulting was involved, but d d s,i\
that the arrangement with the licnt
"must haye been big enough' to
cover the land purchase.
I he client Speed was referring to
was likely the I Jniversity ot C; liloi

according to.lack I liedenthal. a for

Mm. by far. the most unusual

In addition to the arrangement

Colleagues Management Sei

the motor home was purchased. It's

I he two lease arrangements with
the Bookstore are apparent!) the

the last several years. In an inter

actually did engage in consulting
work several years ago, but said he
couldn't remember the last time
they had hail a client.
Lease arrangements not disclosed
I'lie Bookstore has tailed to dis
close either lease arrangement in its
annual returns to the Internal Rev
enue Serv ice, even though there is a
question that asks specil'icallv if the
store has leased property or serv ices
from another corporation which has
officers affiliated with the Bookstore.
Speed is the chief executive offi
cer ol C olleagucs Management Ser
vices. according to a filing made
with California's Secretarv of State
m 1954. Chiaramontc is the secre
tarv and chief financial officer, and
the fathers of both Speed and

( hiaramonte arc listed as the con
suiting linn's directors.
While such lease arrangements
are not necessarily improper, the
IKS asks the question as "a tool" to
help determine whether a nonprofit
organization is involved in sell deal
ing and channeling money to ils in
sidcrs, according to IKS spokesper
son Pain MacLean.
I he IKS wouldn't comment on
the Bookstore's arrangement in
particular. But MacLean noted that
organizations that do have such
lease arrangements are supposed to
provide detailed statements to the
IKS explaining them and demon
slrating their necessity.
Chiaramonte, who signed the
Bookstore's tax return last yeai.
blamed the failure to disclose the
leases on Mark Scheffield ol Ab
bott. Stringham & Lynch, who pre
pares the Bookstore's tax returns.
Scheffield declined to comment on
the matter.
\ 'quite splendid' perk
I he lease arrangement on the
Twain Harte house, says Stanskx.
I he president of the Bookstore's
hoard, is intended as "a sort of re
tirement benefit" for Speed and
Chiaramonte, who. he says, "are
among the best college hook people
in the country." Hack in the mid
'Xl)s. when the arrangement was ap
proved, "we thought we'd he in dan
ger of losing them. I hat would have
been disastrous."
In addition, he says, the house is
a "quite splendid" perquisite loi
current staff members. "I see ii ;is a
wonderful thing."
The house has two master bed
rooms. two master bathrooms, two
additional bedrooms and one and
one-half additional bathrooms,
plus a "large playroom loi the
kids." according to I)ave I urnei ol
Dave I inner Construction, who
designed and built the house. I 'he
home. I urncr says,"was custom
built for the Stanford Bookstore"
and was designed so that two dil
lere 111 lamilies could use it simulta

of privacy.
Twain I larte. where the house is
located, is a small vacation rental
community with a permanent popu

Larry Abreo of the Twain I larte
Chamber of Commerce. I he area
offers skiing in the winter and golf,
fishing and boating in the summer.
Abreo says.
In April I I )N7. the Bookstore pui
chased a Laser II sailboat for use of

In an interview last week. Speed
confirmed that the Bookstore has a
long-term lease on the I wain I larte
house, but refused to discuss its

terms in much detail, saving ques

I he\ did. however,acknowledge
that the lease arrangement is suffi

According to documents filed in

l.lined two loans, one in PMS. the
other in P)N(>. I he combined princi

impossible 4o determine the precise
monthly payments on the loan,
however, because the documents do
not indicate the interest rate or peri

Speed and Chiaramonte would
not disclose lliis information.
(Mlier expenses the Bookstore is
likely paying include propertv lax

year, as well as utilities, insurance
and cleaning costs. According to
Alice Stapp, a local realtor, the
same woman w ho does cleaning for
her is paid to clean the house leased
by the Bookstore.
In any event, local realtors in
I'wain I larte say it is highly unusual
for the Bookstore to be leasing such
a large home on a long-term basis. It
would have made much more sense
from the Bookstore's perspective,
the realtors say. to have purchased
the home or to have built a new
home so that the store could profit
from the investment.
"You couldn't find someone to
rent a house like that for more than

Editor's note: This is the second in
a series of five articles detailing the
top Stanford stories of the century.
In the winter of 1992, Stanford
was thrust into the national limelight
when it was discovered that the Stan
ford Bookstore's staff enjoyed ex
travagant benefits, including pricey
cars, a vacation home, a motorhome,
a sailboat and sky-liigli salaries.
On average, the Stanford Book
store managers were given a salary
$30,000 to $40,000 greater than other
nationwide bookstore managers, in
addition to the use of the vacation
home and luxury cars free of charge.
As a gross misuse of money, the
Bookstore scandal had a very direct
impact on students in the form of el
evated prices.
The Daily broke the story, which
originally ran on Feb. 5, 1992. The
Daily was nominated for a Pulitzer
Prize for its series of stories on the
Bookstore scandal, and it made it into
the Jinal round of consideration. The
Daily remains the only college news

paper ever to make it to the final round
of Pulitzer Prize consideration.

For the last several years, the
Stanford Bookstore has been leas
ing a vacation home in central Cali
fornia from a consulting firm pri
vately owned and operated by the
Bookstore's top two managers.
Eldon Speed and Philip Chiara
monte.
In addition to thousands of dol
lars in lease payments made to
Speed and Chiaramonte's consult
ing firm, the Bookstore has spent
more than $69,000 to furnish the
two-story, 3,100 square-foot home,
according to documents obtained
by The Daily. Among the purchases
made with Bookstore funds were a
$4.341 hot tub. a $5,888 satellite dish
and a $3,681 comforter and bed
room set.

I .ocated in I wain llartc, Calif.,
about 125 miles southeast of Stan
lord on the edge ol the Stanislaus
National l orest. the home is made
available by the Bookstore free ol
charge to families ol many of its se
nior employees.
112 or Speed, the Bookstore's gen
eral manager, and ( 'hiaramonte. its
assistant manager, the home pro
vides a dual benefit. Since IIM6.l l M6. the
house lias been al I heir disposal ;is
a vacation facility at the Book
store's expense. And. because their
consulting firm owns the property.
Speed ami ('hiaramonte w ill be the
beneficiaries when il is eventually
sold, profiling on the investment In
perhaps tens ol thousands ol dol
lars.
In the meantime, the Bookstore,
through its lease payments to the
consulting firm, has effectively
been paying oil $209.0(10 in loans
Speed and Chiarnmontc obtained
in the mill 'NOs to finance the con
struction ol the home. I heir con
suiting firm, called Colleagues
Management Serv ices, hasn't had a
client in years, according to Speed.
I he lease arrangement was dis
covered by I he Daily as part ol an
investigation ol the compensation
practices of the Bookstore, a tax
exempt, nonprofit corporation mil
independently ol the I 'diversity
and overseen by a board of dircc
tors composed ol Stanford faculty,
stall and.in some years, one or two
Stanford students.
I lisioi\ I'iol. IVtci Stansky. the
current president of the Book
store's board, contends the lease
arrangement on the I wain llartc
house is a way to supplement the
pension plans ol Speed and ( liiara
monte. while at the same time pro
viding the Bookstore stall with "a
quite splendid' perquisite.
"()iu aim is to reward people in
the Bookstore so tli.it they can best
serve the community." lie savs.
Speed, 100. contends the rcla
tionship is perfectly legitimate. II
it's devious, it wasn't intended to
be." lie says.

In interviews with oilier book
store managers and indusliy repix
sentalivcs. the mere suggestion ol i
college bookstore providing vehi
cles and vacation facilities to their
employees was often ridiculed.
"You're really stretching it there.'

a recent survey of managers'
salaries for the National .Associa

Murphy, the store's top managei.
" I hat's kind of unusual. I he onl\

Comparisons to otliei book
stores are meaningful because non

Slanloul Bookstore, are r< stride I

Editor's note: This is the second in
a series of five articles detailing the
top Stanford stories of the century.
In the winter of 1992, Stanford
was thrust into the national limelight
when it was discovered that the Stan
ford Bookstore's staff enjoyed ex
travagant benefits, including pricey
cars, a vacation home, a motorhome,
a sailboat and sky-liigli salaries.
On average, the Stanford Book
store managers were given a salary
$30,000 to $40,000 greater than other
nationwide bookstore managers, in
addition to the use of the vacation
home and luxury cars free of charge.
As a gross misuse of money, the
Bookstore scandal had a very direct
impact on students in the form of el
evated prices.
The Daily broke the story, which
originally ran on Feb. 5, 1992. The
Daily was nominated for a Pulitzer
Prize for its series of stories on the
Bookstore scandal, and it made it into
the Jinal round of consideration. The
Daily remains the only college news

paper ever to make it to the final round
of Pulitzer Prize consideration.

For the last several years, the
Stanford Bookstore has been leas
ing a vacation home in central Cali
fornia from a consulting firm pri
vately owned and operated by the
Bookstore's top two managers.
Eldon Speed and Philip Chiara
monte.
In addition to thousands of dol
lars in lease payments made to
Speed and Chiaramonte's consult
ing firm, the Bookstore has spent
more than $69,000 to furnish the
two-story, 3,100 square-foot home,
according to documents obtained
by The Daily. Among the purchases
made with Bookstore funds were a
$4.341 hot tub. a $5,888 satellite dish
and a $3,681 comforter and bed
room set.

I .ocated in I wain llartc, Calif.,

store's expense. And. because their
consulting firm owns the property.
Speed ami ('hiaramonte w ill be the

In the meantime, the Bookstore,
through its lease payments to the
consulting firm, has effectively
been paying oil $209.0(10 in loans
Speed and Chiarnmontc obtained
in the mill 'NOs to finance the con
struction ol the home. I heir con
suiting firm, called Colleagues
Management Serv ices, hasn't had a
client in years, according to Speed.
I he lease arrangement was dis
covered by I he Daily as part ol an
investigation ol the compensation
practices of the Bookstore, a tax
exempt, nonprofit corporation mil
independently ol the I 'diversity
and overseen by a board of dircc
tors composed ol Stanford faculty,

Stanford students.
I lisioi\ I'iol. IVtci Stansky. the
current president of the Book

arrangement on the I wain llartc
house is a way to supplement the
pension plans ol Speed and ( liiara

More than $13,000 in Mookstore
liinils have also been used to pur

two I ilee\cles. a I roller treadmill
and a Slaii master. I he equipment,
according to Speed, is located in the
Mookstore's warehouse in Newark.
( alii. across the May and is
available loi the use ol the entire
Mookstore stall, he sa\s.
Mm. by far. the most unusual
compensation arrangement in the
eyes of tax experts contacted by I he
Daily stems Irom the relationship
between Speed and Chiaramonlc's
consulting firm and the Mookslore.
In addition to the arrangement
on the I wain llarte house, the
Mookstore is leasing a IIJl l JS l ) I lolida\
Rambler Imperial motor home
from Colleagues Management Scr
vices. I he motor home. too. is a\ ail
able for use ol senioi Mookstore em
ployces. Speed says, bill '"it doesn't
get as much use as ihc house docs."
Colleagues Management Sei
vices likcK paid more than $50,000
to buy the vehicle, according lo a
salesman at Dan Camels' I ravel
1 rails in Scotts Vallev. where the

the motor home was purchased. It's
not dear how much the Bookstore is
paying Speed and Chiaramonte's
consulting firm lor its use.
I he two lease arrangements with
the Bookstore are apparent!) the
onlv sources of income Colleagues
Management Services has had lor
the last several years. In an inter
view. Speed indicated thai the firm
actually did engage in consulting
work several years ago, but said he
couldn't remember the last time
they had hail a client.
Lease arrangements not disclosed
I'lie Bookstore has tailed to dis
close either lease arrangement in its
annual returns to the Internal Rev
enue Serv ice, even though there is a
question that asks specil'icallv if the
store has leased property or serv ices
from another corporation which has
officers affiliated with the Bookstore.
Speed is the chief executive offi
cer ol C olleagucs Management Ser
vices. according to a filing made
with California's Secretarv of State
m 1954. Chiaramontc is the secre
tarv and chief financial officer, and
the fathers of both Speed and

( hiaramonte arc listed as the con
suiting linn's directors.
While such lease arrangements
are not necessarily improper, the
IKS asks the question as "a tool" to
help determine whether a nonprofit
organization is involved in sell deal
ing and channeling money to ils in
sidcrs, according to IKS spokesper
son Pain MacLean.
I he IKS wouldn't comment on
the Bookstore's arrangement in
particular. But MacLean noted that
organizations that do have such
lease arrangements are supposed to
provide detailed statements to the
IKS explaining them and demon
slrating their necessity.
Chiaramonte, who signed the
Bookstore's tax return last yeai.
blamed the failure to disclose the
leases on Mark Scheffield ol Ab
bott. Stringham & Lynch, who pre
pares the Bookstore's tax returns.
Scheffield declined to comment on
the matter.
\ 'quite splendid' perk
I he lease arrangement on the
Twain Harte house, says Stanskx.
I he president of the Bookstore's
hoard, is intended as "a sort of re
tirement benefit" for Speed and
Chiaramonte, who. he says, "are
among the best college hook people
in the country." Hack in the mid
'Xl)s. when the arrangement was ap
proved, "we thought we'd he in dan
ger of losing them. I hat would have
been disastrous."
In addition, he says, the house is
a "quite splendid" perquisite loi
current staff members. "I see ii ;is a
wonderful thing."
The house has two master bed
rooms. two master bathrooms, two
additional bedrooms and one and
one-half additional bathrooms,
plus a "large playroom loi the
kids." according to I)ave I urnei ol
Dave I inner Construction, who
designed and built the house. I 'he
home. I urncr says,"was custom
built for the Stanford Bookstore"
and was designed so that two dil
lere 111 lamilies could use it simulta
neously and maintain some degree
of privacy.
Twain I larte. where the house is
located, is a small vacation rental
community with a permanent popu
lation of about 3.750. according to
Larry Abreo of the Twain I larte
Chamber of Commerce. I he area
offers skiing in the winter and golf,
fishing and boating in the summer.
Abreo says.
In April I I )N7. the Bookstore pui
chased a Laser II sailboat for use of
employees vacationing at the I wain
I larte home. I lie boat was pur
chased at Seahird Sailing in Bcrkc
ley for $3,745, according to docu
ments obtained b\ I he I)ail\.
Monthly payments entered
In an interview last week. Speed
confirmed that the Bookstore has a
long-term lease on the I wain I larte
house, but refused to discuss its

terms in much detail, saving ques
tions on the matter were an "inva
sion of privacy."
I he\ did. however,acknowledge
that the lease arrangement is suffi
cient to cover the monthly pa\ mcnts
on loans their consulting linn ob
tained to finance the house's con
struction. and that the Bookstore
pa\s all other expenses associated
with the house.
According to documents filed in
I uolumne County, where the
I wain I larte house is located. Col
leagues Management Services ob
l.lined two loans, one in PMS. the
other in P)N(>. I he combined princi
pal on the loans was $200.()(K). It is
impossible 4o determine the precise
monthly payments on the loan,
however, because the documents do
not indicate the interest rate or peri
od of repayment.
Speed and Chiaramonte would
not disclose lliis information.
(Mlier expenses the Bookstore is
likely paying include propertv lax
on the lot. which was $3.249.(>N last
year, as well as utilities, insurance
and cleaning costs. According to
Alice Stapp, a local realtor, the
same woman w ho does cleaning for
her is paid to clean the house leased
by the Bookstore.
In any event, local realtors in
I'wain I larte say it is highly unusual
for the Bookstore to be leasing such
a large home on a long-term basis. It
would have made much more sense
from the Bookstore's perspective,
the realtors say. to have purchased
the home or to have built a new
home so that the store could profit
from the investment.
"You couldn't find someone to
rent a house like that for more than
a weekend at a time." says Wayne
Stapp of Realty World bvergreen
Properties. "People here don't rent
for more than a couple months be
fore bin ing something."
\V long-term he lie lit lor lis'
In the Bookstore's case, when
the property is sold. Speed and

Chiaramonte's consulting firm will
receive the profit from the sale. The
vacation home. Speed says, is in
tended as "a short-term benelit for
the staff, and hopefully .1 long term
benefit for us."
Local realtors say that, even
given the depressed real estate mar
ket, the cm rent value ol the house is
around $400.000. One realtor.
Chucker I wining of I upo I'r >pcr
ties in l uain llarle. suggested the
house would likely sell for more
than $S(K 1.0(H).

Speed says. Me wouldn't say who
the client was, or even w hat kind ol

that the arrangement with the licnt
"must haye been big enough' to
cover the land purchase.

according to.lack I liedenthal. a for

the last several years. In an inter

couldn't remember the last time
they had hail a client.
Lease arrangements not disclosed
I'lie Bookstore has tailed to dis
close either lease arrangement in its
annual returns to the Internal Rev
enue Serv ice, even though there is a
question that asks specil'icallv if the
store has leased property or serv ices
from another corporation which has
officers affiliated with the Bookstore.
Speed is the chief executive offi
cer ol C olleagucs Management Ser
vices. according to a filing made
with California's Secretarv of State
m 1954. Chiaramontc is the secre
tarv and chief financial officer, and
the fathers of both Speed and

( hiaramonte arc listed as the con
suiting linn's directors.
While such lease arrangements
are not necessarily improper, the
IKS asks the question as "a tool" to
help determine whether a nonprofit
organization is involved in sell deal
ing and channeling money to ils in
sidcrs, according to IKS spokesper
son Pain MacLean.
I he IKS wouldn't comment on
the Bookstore's arrangement in
particular. But MacLean noted that
organizations that do have such
lease arrangements are supposed to
provide detailed statements to the
IKS explaining them and demon
slrating their necessity.
Chiaramonte, who signed the
Bookstore's tax return last yeai.
blamed the failure to disclose the
leases on Mark Scheffield ol Ab
bott. Stringham & Lynch, who pre
pares the Bookstore's tax returns.
Scheffield declined to comment on
the matter.
\ 'quite splendid' perk
I he lease arrangement on the
Twain Harte house, says Stanskx.
I he president of the Bookstore's
hoard, is intended as "a sort of re
tirement benefit" for Speed and
Chiaramonte, who. he says, "are
among the best college hook people
in the country." Hack in the mid
'Xl)s. when the arrangement was ap
proved, "we thought we'd he in dan
ger of losing them. I hat would have
been disastrous."
In addition, he says, the house is
a "quite splendid" perquisite loi
current staff members. "I see ii ;is a
wonderful thing."
The house has two master bed
rooms. two master bathrooms, two
additional bedrooms and one and
one-half additional bathrooms,
plus a "large playroom loi the
kids." according to I)ave I urnei ol
Dave I inner Construction, who
designed and built the house. I 'he
home. I urncr says,"was custom
built for the Stanford Bookstore"
and was designed so that two dil
lere 111 lamilies could use it simulta
neously and maintain some degree
of privacy.
Twain I larte. where the house is
located, is a small vacation rental
community with a permanent popu

Larry Abreo of the Twain I larte
Chamber of Commerce. I he area
offers skiing in the winter and golf,
fishing and boating in the summer.
Abreo says.
In April I I )N7. the Bookstore pui
chased a Laser II sailboat for use of
employees vacationing at the I wain

chased at Seahird Sailing in Bcrkc

In an interview last week. Speed
confirmed that the Bookstore has a
long-term lease on the I wain I larte
house, but refused to discuss its

terms in much detail, saving ques

I he\ did. however,acknowledge
that the lease arrangement is suffi

on loans their consulting linn ob

pa\s all other expenses associated
with the house.
According to documents filed in
I uolumne County, where the
I wain I larte house is located. Col
leagues Management Services ob
l.lined two loans, one in PMS. the
other in P)N(>. I he combined princi

impossible 4o determine the precise
monthly payments on the loan,
however, because the documents do
not indicate the interest rate or peri

Speed and Chiaramonte would
not disclose lliis information.
(Mlier expenses the Bookstore is
likely paying include propertv lax
on the lot. which was $3.249.(>N last
year, as well as utilities, insurance
and cleaning costs. According to
Alice Stapp, a local realtor, the
same woman w ho does cleaning for
her is paid to clean the house leased
by the Bookstore.
In any event, local realtors in
I'wain I larte say it is highly unusual
for the Bookstore to be leasing such
a large home on a long-term basis. It
would have made much more sense
from the Bookstore's perspective,
the realtors say. to have purchased
the home or to have built a new
home so that the store could profit
from the investment.
"You couldn't find someone to
rent a house like that for more than
a weekend at a time." says Wayne
Stapp of Realty World bvergreen

Editor's note: This is the second in
a series of five articles detailing the
top Stanford stories of the century.
In the winter of 1992, Stanford
was thrust into the national limelight
when it was discovered that the Stan
ford Bookstore's staff enjoyed ex
travagant benefits, including pricey
cars, a vacation home, a motorhome,
a sailboat and sky-liigli salaries.
On average, the Stanford Book
store managers were given a salary
$30,000 to $40,000 greater than other
nationwide bookstore managers, in
addition to the use of the vacation
home and luxury cars free of charge.
As a gross misuse of money, the
Bookstore scandal had a very direct
impact on students in the form of el
evated prices.
The Daily broke the story, which
originally ran on Feb. 5, 1992. The
Daily was nominated for a Pulitzer
Prize for its series of stories on the
Bookstore scandal, and it made it into
the Jinal round of consideration. The
Daily remains the only college news

paper ever to make it to the final round
of Pulitzer Prize consideration.

For the last several years, the
Stanford Bookstore has been leas
ing a vacation home in central Cali
fornia from a consulting firm pri
vately owned and operated by the
Bookstore's top two managers.
Eldon Speed and Philip Chiara
monte.
In addition to thousands of dol
lars in lease payments made to
Speed and Chiaramonte's consult
ing firm, the Bookstore has spent
more than $69,000 to furnish the
two-story, 3,100 square-foot home,
according to documents obtained
by The Daily. Among the purchases
made with Bookstore funds were a
$4.341 hot tub. a $5,888 satellite dish
and a $3,681 comforter and bed
room set.

I .ocated in I wain llartc, Calif.,
about 125 miles southeast of Stan
lord on the edge ol the Stanislaus
National l orest. the home is made
available by the Bookstore free ol
charge to families ol many of its se
nior employees.
112 or Speed, the Bookstore's gen
eral manager, and ( 'hiaramonte. its
assistant manager, the home pro
vides a dual benefit. Since IIM6.l l M6. the
house lias been al I heir disposal ;is
a vacation facility at the Book
store's expense. And. because their
consulting firm owns the property.
Speed ami ('hiaramonte w ill be the
beneficiaries when il is eventually
sold, profiling on the investment In
perhaps tens ol thousands ol dol
lars.
In the meantime, the Bookstore,
through its lease payments to the
consulting firm, has effectively
been paying oil $209.0(10 in loans
Speed and Chiarnmontc obtained
in the mill 'NOs to finance the con
struction ol the home. I heir con
suiting firm, called Colleagues
Management Serv ices, hasn't had a
client in years, according to Speed.
I he lease arrangement was dis
covered by I he Daily as part ol an
investigation ol the compensation
practices of the Bookstore, a tax
exempt, nonprofit corporation mil
independently ol the I 'diversity
and overseen by a board of dircc
tors composed ol Stanford faculty,
stall and.in some years, one or two
Stanford students.
I lisioi\ I'iol. IVtci Stansky. the
current president of the Book
store's board, contends the lease
arrangement on the I wain llartc
house is a way to supplement the
pension plans ol Speed and ( liiara
monte. while at the same time pro
viding the Bookstore stall with "a
quite splendid' perquisite.
"()iu aim is to reward people in
the Bookstore so tli.it they can best
serve the community." lie savs.
Speed, 100. contends the rcla
tionship is perfectly legitimate. II
it's devious, it wasn't intended to
be." lie says.

In interviews with oilier book
store managers and indusliy repix
sentalivcs. the mere suggestion ol i
college bookstore providing vehi
cles and vacation facilities to their
employees was often ridiculed.
"You're really stretching it there.'

a recent survey of managers'
salaries for the National .Associa

that are exceptional. I hose are ex

" I hat's kind of unusual. I he onl\

stores are meaningful because non
