# Sex Shoppe readies to ride again
## 
### Ben Alexander-Bloch Contributing writer 
Alter a long hiatus, the Safer Sex
Shoppe will soon he hack preaching
eroticism to Stanford students.
The Shoppe, temporarily closed
this quarter to provide time for im
provements, will open afresh next
quarter. Current stall members say
the Shoppe needed time to rebound
from a year of bad management
"The Sex Shoppe fell into various
states of ill-repair as it lacked effi
cient manegmcnt ... many stun
dents didn't even know the shop ex
isted. Sometimes volunteers
wouldn't even show up for their
shifts," said sophomore James Jacob
Youngberg, the new head of The
Safer Sex Shoppe.
The Shoppe shares a room with
SURE Escort Service and historical
ly has been affiliated with the Les
bian. Ciav and Bisexual Community
('enter. Last year, the Shoppe ran on
an honor system as students took the
products themselves, leaving the
necessary fee in a bin.
Presently, the Shoppe is not fully
operational, as workers at the
Women's Center occasionally sell
students the Shoppe's merchandise.
The Shoppe differs from the Sex
ual I lealth Peer Resource ( enter in
that it is less focused on sexual edu
cation. I he SI I PRC' requires its em
ployees to attend a quarter-long
training course, while the Shoppe
does not.
What the Shoppe does do is offer
condoms and other products at a re
duced price: lOcondoms for a dollar.
The Shoppe purchases fewer brands
of products in general than the sexu

al health center, which allows them
to buy products in bulk quantities.
T he SI I PRC' also spends some of
its money on course readers and
other training materials, which the
Shoppe doesn't buy.
" The Safer Sex Shoppe provides
another resource on campus for stu
dents to acquire contraceptives and
S I I) protection. We support them
and everything they stand for," said
junior Jill Die iiovanni, the co-direc
tor of the SI I PRC \
The ASSU gives money to sup
port both resource centers. Neither
makes money from its own sales. In

stead both generally lose money
each quarter.
Students' decisions on which cen
ter to attend may rest largely on lo
cation. For example, students living
on west campus are much closer to
the Safer Sex Shoppe than those on
east.
The environment within the
Safer Sex Shoppe is less clinical than
in the SHPRC, as the Safer Sex
Shoppe rests within the Women's
Center and under the LGBCC.
Some students may be turned off
by the SI IPRC's location in Cowell.
DiGiovanni said. " The SHPRC's lo

cation in Cowell Health Center may
give a medical feel," she said.
Cowell closes at 5 p.m. and thus
so does the SHPRC. The Women's
Center stays open past 5 p.m. and
SURE Escort runs until around 2
a.m., so the Shoppe has later hours.
The two centers also differ in mis
sion: The Safer Sex Shoppe empha
sizes the pleasure of sexuality apart
from just general sexual education.
"I think right now Stanford lacks
resources which discuss how good
sex is," Youngberg said. "The
Shoppe provides a place where peo
ple can talk positvely about sex."
