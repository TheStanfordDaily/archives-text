## United Health HMO gives authority to doctors 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Abandon
ing the bedrock principle underlying
managed care, United Health Group
says doctors, not health plan admin
istrators, will now have the final say
on which treatments it will cover.
United is the nation's second
largest health insurer, covering 14.5
million people.
The move accelerates a trend
among health maintenance organi
zations to give doctors and patients
more freedom. But it raises ques
tions about how HMOs will control
rising costs and whether consumers
will be best served by a return to the
"doctor-knows-best" philosophy.

United said its decision makes fis
cal sense because it was paying more
money to scrutinize and deny ques
tionable treatments than the practice
saved.
United will still ask doctors to
justify such decisions as ordering
surgery or expensive diagnostic
tests. And the change doesn't mean
United will pay for services that are
currently not covered, such as cos
metic surgery.
But under the new policy, the
doctor will have the final say on
how the patient will be treated, the
company said Monday.
United said doctors will be eval

uated over the long term instead of
case by case, and those found to be
practicing wasteful medicine will be
dropped from the health care net
work.
"This is a double-edge sword for
patients," said Charlie Inlander,
president of the People's Medical
Society, a consumer health group
based in Allentown, Pa.
He said doctors and consumers
will benefit from no longer having
treatment delayed or rejected — a
major complaint that has prompted
patient rights legislation in
Congress and lawsuits against
HMOs.

However. managed care is also
intended to protect consumers from
falling prey to unnecessary or inef
fective procedures.
United's approach could result
in higher insurance premiums, said
John Erb. a health benefits consul
tant in Boca Raton. Fla. "The corol
lary here is: Be careful what you
wish for. you might get it." Erb said.
Karen Ignagni. president of the
American Association of Health
Plans, said she expects more plans
to follow United's strategy.
"Doctors and health plans are
going to work collaboratively," she
said. "Health plans are evolving to

respond to the key objectives of
patients and physicians."
Dr. Thomas Reardon, president
of the American Medical Associa
tion. said: "Doctors will receive this
news well. We've always advocated
that it should be doctors making the
determination of what is medically
necessary."
rhc ability of HMO managers to
overrule doctors' decisions about
what procedures and services are
medically necessary — and thus
covered bv insurance — has been a
basic rule of managed care. It also
has been a policy that HMO offi
cials insist was responsible for bring

ing down the steep health cost
increases of the late 1980s and earlv
'90s.
Doctors and patients have
argued, however, that the policy put
patient care in conflict with HMO
profits.
In response, United and other
HMOs in recent years have relaxed
many of their stringent rules. They
have reduced the number of proce
dures requiring pre-approval.
allowed patients to go directly to
specialists in the health plan's net
work and have given patients the
ability to appeal coverage decisions
to an independent arbiter.
