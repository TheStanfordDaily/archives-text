## Editor's Notebook When tragedy strikes 
### 
Death hits a little too
close to home for a
Daily editor

I received mi e-mail from a friend
back home today informing me
that four students from my high
school had been in a fatal car acci
dent early Saturday morning. Two of
the passengers, both 15 years old,
died while the other two remain hos
pitalized and in critical condition.
Though I only knew one of the
students, and (hough I'm currently
3.000 miles away from home, I feel
strangely affected by their deaths.
Throughout my years in elementary,
middle and high school, no students
in my town died. My friends and I
would discuss it some times, wonder
ing how we would respond if tragedy
were ever to strike our classmates.
Now it has, and both alumni and
current students are reacting. I've
received the following message from
three friends of mine in less than six
hours already, and many people
have already signed it.
It reads: "Yesterday, at approxi
mately. 2:45 in the morning, two
members of the class of 2002 at
Nathan Male Ray High School died
in a severe car accident. The driver
and another passenger are both in
the hospital in severe condition.
" This is not a sympathy letter; it is
merely a living memorial of our two
lost friends. This letter must keep
going. It must live the way they
didn't and be a constant reminder of
what happens when you drink and
drive. I hev say you never die until
you are forgotten. We must never let
them be forgotten; they were good
kids and deserve to live as long as
the rest of us. maybe not in the flesh
but in memory. We loved them. They
were part of our family. I hey were

friends that did not deserve to die.
"Bv signing this letter you are
keeping these hoys alive in memory.
You are showing that you care and
that you will he more careful the
next time you hop into a car with a
drunk driver."
I debated about whether to sign
the letter and pass it on. I've never
understood why people react to the
deaths of people they have never
met. The reaction to the deaths of
John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife Car
olyn Bessette Kennedy and her sis
ter especially astounded me. How
could a substantial portion of the
U.S. population mourn the deaths of
three people they did not know?
Today, after hearing about the
deaths of the students in my town, I
think 1 discovered at least part of the
reason why we mourn the deaths of
those we don't know. From my van
tage point I'm saddened by the fact
that those two students will never
have the opportunity to experience
the opportunities which a life lived
until death from old age allows for.
Even more upsetting is the fact
that their deaths could have been
avoided. I signed the letter and
passed it on not only because I want
to demonstrate my grief at their loss
but also because I want to remind
those people who I'm sending the
message along to how serious the
consequences of drinking and driv
ing can be.
It's ironic, the optimistic perspec
tive that death can give you on life.
After hearing about the deaths in
my town 1 fell a twinge of guilt for
not appreciating every day I've been
alive and every experience that I
have. Rather than complaining
about the problem set awaiting me,
I'm feeling grateful that I have the
opportunity to complete it.
