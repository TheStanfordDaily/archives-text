Last Wednesday
marked a huge day
in the American
Studies House's long
tumultuous history. In
addition to the celebration
of my fake birthday with a
sparkly glue "Happy

Birthday Mike" sign, two non-helium bal
loons and three varieties of Blow Pops (my
real birthday is on June 22, but since we are
not in school then my fake one was of
course decided to be Nov. 3), this day
marked the beginning of AmStud's first
ever dorm assassins game.
"First-ever?" you ask. "But my freshman
dorm has already played four times this
year!"
Well, living over in Governor's Corner
with such fine and lively neighbors as East,
Sterling Quad (previously known as Where
Juniors Go to Die) and a colony of black
squirrels (who, by the way, decided to feast
on the nice pumpkin I set out on my bal
cony as decoration), dorm activities are
more on the sparse side.
And now you are thinking, "Well, what
makes you such an expert, Mike?" I have
lived on the same floor of the same house
for three years now.
Though you might not think that the
American Studies House is the coolest
place to be for three years (or you might not
even know that it exists), I think it is pretty
good considering I am a (proud) member of
the 6,(KK) club. The 6,(XX) club is the name
for the elite group of people who have
managed to total over 6,(KX) when adding
their draw numbers over three years.

We flew by 6,(KK) this year by drawing
1,921 after previously drawing 1,834 and
2,512. 1 know what you are thinking: "Hey,
2,512 isn't so bad." Unfortunately, I never
had the chance to use my prize unpreferred
number; I was on staff in AmStud last year.
Hey, living in AmStud isn't so bad. My
in-house draw number this year was insane.
But moving into an upper-class house
sophomore year was certainly a change in
lifestyle from the antics of Junipero fresh
man year. Our six-person draw group was
joined by only three other sophomores.
After a while we discovered having a more
mellow house wasn't so bad. We could meet
people on our own time instead of being
forced together in ice breakers and trips to
the Dish. By the end of the year, AmStud
really felt like home; a place to come back
to and chill.
So with a warm and fuzzy feeling about
AmStud, 1 returned to be a Theme Assis
tant the next year. Life was much of the
same, with me pulling a typical junior spring
quarter and going overseas.
As I returned this year, I was surprised to
hear that the normally nominal number of
sophomores had increased by a consider
able amount. Having such a young house
has definitely changed its spirit.
We actually have a social committee that
does something. So far we have had laser
tag, gelato Saturday, Indiana Jones trilogy
night in the lounge and a two-keg party with
Sinister Dexter. Though one of the kegs
wasn't tapped, I hadn't seen that many peo
ple at an AmStud party since the Resident
Fellow's kid had her 12th birthday party.
I think it's great. These ex-frosh are con-

tinuing their frosh dorm spirit, and it is
adding some life to this place.
The funny thing is that it seems so out of
place for me now. I find myself as one of
those seniors I mocked two years ago; 1
don't show up to house meetings, rarely
partake in activities and know the names of
less than half the house.
It's not like I am totally apathetic
though. 1 do have the well respected title of
Beer Czar. 1 am responsible for purchasing
barbecue beer every Friday. When you
think about it my position is one of the
utmost importance. I mold the beer taste of
a good 40 people and have been actively
trying to get the females off the pear cider.
It's just a different experience here this
year. I guess what you search for in a place
to live changes from year to year. While
much of your frosh social life is dorm-cen
tered, senior year social life finds you
spending time all over campus (and off, for
that matter) with the network of friends
you have developed over the years.
The dorm is not my social center any
more, and I shouldn't feel bad about it.
Though this newfound AmStud spirit
seems a bit out of place to me now, 1 am
glad that the sophomores are creating the
house experience they want. And it was
sort of a nice surprise to finally get some
birthday acknowledgment during the
school year.
