del the facts straight
I write in response to Professor Hmeri
lus Ronald Milton, whose letter to The
Daily last I hursday indicted our nation and
our university for the "profanation of a
solemn day ol remembrance" â€” Hal
loween. Hut I lilton's guise as a moral stew
ard leaves his hones a little bare.
( ontrarv to Hilton's reckless assessment
of the origin of the occasion. I lalloween, or
the I've of All Hallows (Oct. 31), is the
evening that precedes All Hallows Day or
All S;iints Day not All Souls Day, as
Professor Hilton assumed.
I he Christian Church initiated All
Saints Day (Nov. I) to channel the energy
created by pre-Christian Celtic new year
festivals and then added All Souls Day
(Nov. 2) around A.D. in an ineffective
attempt to better tap into (and away from)
the pagan past.
All Saints Day commemorates the
"blessed dead." whereas All Souls Day
commemorates the "faithful dead." Unless
the professor's parents were saints, he has
been praying foi them on the wrong day.
As my parents arc not saints, I pray for
them on Nov. 2. My parents are also not
dead, so I don't pray for them as such.
Professor Hilton objects to the noisy
revelry of the Mausoleum party insofar as
"(making) whoopee outside the Stanford
Mausoleum is a gratuitous insult to the
dead benefactors." In his ironic misuse of
the vernacular "making whoopee." the pro
fessor stumbles upon the very essence of
I lalloween: the intoxicating and erotic cel

ebration of life in the face of imminent
death.
So remove the mask of your solemnity.
Professor Hilton, as we all must do as the
evening wears on.

Stanford students aren V dis
respectful
I am writing in response to Professor
Hmeritus Ronald Hilton's letter in last
Thursday's Daily regarding the annual Hal
loween festivities at the Mausoleum.
As a graduate of the "Animal Farm," as
Professor Hilton so derisively puts it. I find
it distressing that an estfcemed Stanford
professor would stereotype all Stanford
students and alumni as relentless revelers
with no regard or respect for our Universi
ty's founders and benefactors.
It alarms me to read his conclusion that
we arc not our country's "brightest and
best" solely based on the fact that Stanford
students continue the long-standing tradi
tion of celebrating Halloween at Jane and
1 eland Stanford's final resting place.
I would venture to say that most, if not
all, Stanford students and graduates are
well aware of the sacrifices that the Stan
fords made many decades ago. We realize
that we continue to benefit from those con
tributions of long ago even today and even
after leaving the University.
Perhaps those who claim that the Stan
ford student body have no respect for the
founders could try observing the student

turnout on Founders' Day. Maybe they
could ask students who took Anthropology
Prof. John Kick's tour of University history
(which, incidentally, includes the Mau
soleum and other tributes to deceased indi
viduals that played paramount roles in the
fate of a fledgling Stanford University) how
they feel about Senator and Mrs. Stanford's
influence on their education.
I contend that such critics would quickly
realize that students have an enormous
sense of appreciation of the fact that the
Stanfords did not just turn away from the
world in grief when their only son died, but
instead dedicated themselves to creating a
namesake institution of higher learning in
his honor that would serve future genera
tions, the country and the world for a long
time to come.
Certainly, my sentiments and gratitude
toward the Stanfords have remained con
sistent despite my attendance at the Mau
soleum during multiple Halloween celebra
tions. I'd like to request respectfully that
those who wish to make statements regard
ing the academic competence and intelli
gence of Stanford students and alumni use
other, more pertinent criteria to judge our
abilities.

Editorial lacking in details
and analysis
The Daily editorial on Friday, Nov. 5
managed to polarize what could have been
a very enlightened and positive discussion

about today's blood screening procedures
and the gay community's current attitude
towards AIDS.
Running under the headline "Blood
Center policy justified," it was woefully
lacking in any examination of this policy
and presented neither facts nor historical
analysis to back up its claim. Even if the
Blood Center policy is justified, those con
cerns that have been raised should not be
dismissed out of hand with such an
appalling lack of objective argument.
First we are informed that it is pointless
to pursue this issue at the local level as the
policies are set by the federal government.
Surely it makes sense to examine the situa
tion locally to see if there is a problem
before going running off to Washington.
Second, in an amazingly bizarre twist,
we learn that all social injustices come as a
package. Apparently, in order to address
any possible instances of discrimination,
you must become an advocate for all; oth
erwise "accusations of homophobia are bla
tantly one-dimensional."
Third we are told that given the "dis
turbingly" high incidence of AIDS amongst
gay men, "it seems sensible to play it safe
and screen for these risk factors."
Although I find the choice of wording
suspiciously moral in tone, I could let it pass
if this line of logic had been accompanied
with facts. What arc the current levels of
AIDS in the gay male population? How are
these levels changing? How effective is a
questionnaire at screening? Would other
questions be as effective? Are all at-risk
