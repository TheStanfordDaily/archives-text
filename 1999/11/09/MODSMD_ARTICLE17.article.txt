Daily last I hursday indicted our nation and
our university for the "profanation of a

( ontrarv to Hilton's reckless assessment
of the origin of the occasion. I lalloween, or
the I've of All Hallows (Oct. 31), is the
evening that precedes All Hallows Day or
All S;iints Day not All Souls Day, as
Professor Hilton assumed.
I he Christian Church initiated All
Saints Day (Nov. I) to channel the energy
created by pre-Christian Celtic new year
festivals and then added All Souls Day
(Nov. 2) around A.D. in an ineffective
attempt to better tap into (and away from)
the pagan past.
All Saints Day commemorates the
"blessed dead." whereas All Souls Day
commemorates the "faithful dead." Unless
the professor's parents were saints, he has
been praying foi them on the wrong day.
As my parents arc not saints, I pray for
them on Nov. 2. My parents are also not
dead, so I don't pray for them as such.
Professor Hilton objects to the noisy
revelry of the Mausoleum party insofar as
"(making) whoopee outside the Stanford
Mausoleum is a gratuitous insult to the
dead benefactors." In his ironic misuse of
the vernacular "making whoopee." the pro
fessor stumbles upon the very essence of
I lalloween: the intoxicating and erotic cel

ebration of life in the face of imminent
death.
So remove the mask of your solemnity.
Professor Hilton, as we all must do as the
evening wears on.

Stanford students aren V dis
respectful
I am writing in response to Professor
Hmeritus Ronald Hilton's letter in last
Thursday's Daily regarding the annual Hal
loween festivities at the Mausoleum.
As a graduate of the "Animal Farm," as
Professor Hilton so derisively puts it. I find
it distressing that an estfcemed Stanford
professor would stereotype all Stanford
students and alumni as relentless revelers
with no regard or respect for our Universi
ty's founders and benefactors.
It alarms me to read his conclusion that
we arc not our country's "brightest and
best" solely based on the fact that Stanford
students continue the long-standing tradi
tion of celebrating Halloween at Jane and
1 eland Stanford's final resting place.
I would venture to say that most, if not
all, Stanford students and graduates are
well aware of the sacrifices that the Stan
fords made many decades ago. We realize
that we continue to benefit from those con
tributions of long ago even today and even
after leaving the University.
Perhaps those who claim that the Stan
ford student body have no respect for the
founders could try observing the student

turnout on Founders' Day. Maybe they
could ask students who took Anthropology
Prof. John Kick's tour of University history
(which, incidentally, includes the Mau
soleum and other tributes to deceased indi
viduals that played paramount roles in the
fate of a fledgling Stanford University) how
they feel about Senator and Mrs. Stanford's
influence on their education.
I contend that such critics would quickly
realize that students have an enormous
sense of appreciation of the fact that the
Stanfords did not just turn away from the
world in grief when their only son died, but
instead dedicated themselves to creating a
namesake institution of higher learning in
his honor that would serve future genera
tions, the country and the world for a long
time to come.
Certainly, my sentiments and gratitude
toward the Stanfords have remained con
sistent despite my attendance at the Mau
soleum during multiple Halloween celebra
tions. I'd like to request respectfully that
those who wish to make statements regard
ing the academic competence and intelli
gence of Stanford students and alumni use
other, more pertinent criteria to judge our
abilities.

Editorial lacking in details
and analysis
The Daily editorial on Friday, Nov. 5
managed to polarize what could have been
a very enlightened and positive discussion

about today's blood screening procedures
and the gay community's current attitude
towards AIDS.
Running under the headline "Blood
Center policy justified," it was woefully
lacking in any examination of this policy
and presented neither facts nor historical
analysis to back up its claim. Even if the
Blood Center policy is justified, those con
cerns that have been raised should not be
dismissed out of hand with such an
appalling lack of objective argument.
First we are informed that it is pointless
to pursue this issue at the local level as the
policies are set by the federal government.
Surely it makes sense to examine the situa
tion locally to see if there is a problem
before going running off to Washington.
Second, in an amazingly bizarre twist,
we learn that all social injustices come as a
package. Apparently, in order to address
any possible instances of discrimination,
you must become an advocate for all; oth
erwise "accusations of homophobia are bla
tantly one-dimensional."
Third we are told that given the "dis
turbingly" high incidence of AIDS amongst
gay men, "it seems sensible to play it safe
and screen for these risk factors."
Although I find the choice of wording
suspiciously moral in tone, I could let it pass
if this line of logic had been accompanied
with facts. What arc the current levels of
AIDS in the gay male population? How are
these levels changing? How effective is a
questionnaire at screening? Would other
questions be as effective? Are all at-risk
groups treated equally? When was this
policy instated and has it been reviewed
since that time?
Fourth it is argued that we are not
allowed to raise concerns without first
having all the answers: "The burden of
proof clearly lays with the Center's oppo
nents, and they have not fulfilled it." The
use of the term opponents adds a con
frontational tone that is new to the discus
sion, and surely in an academic environ
ment you shouldn't be afraid to ask why
without lirst knowing the answer. Sonic
times that way you can learn something
instead ot just convincing yourself of what
you believed all along.
Finally it is suggested that the current
policies could not be homophobic because
it would be "foolish (and unlikely) that
architects of such policies would actively
work to exclude any segments of the pop
ulation without good reason." All homo
phobia is foolish, unlikely and without
good reason, and yet it certainly exists,
intent notwithstanding. To believe social
injustice can't exist because il doesn't
make sense is certainly the ultimate case
of denial.
Not only docs it show a shocking lack of

thought and research for the work of a
Stanford student or serious journalist; this
editorial also fails in exactly the same way
it accuses those who raised the concerns
have failed: "they fail to address the truly
important issue at hand: ensuring the safe
ty of the blood supply."
After reading this article I have no idea
whether the current policy ensures safety
or not. AP I have learned is that the author
has a disturbingly deferential attitude
toward authority: don't bother trying to
question anything as you can't change it
anyway and why would you want to
change it because those in charge have
only our best interest at heart.

Blood Center policy should
be redesigned
Recently, The Daily claimed that the
discriminatory policy of the Stanford
Blood Center is a sensible way to ensure
the safety of the blood supply and that the
opponents of the policy had failed to pre

sent a sufficient argument as to why the
policy is wrong.
We oppose the current screening ques
tions not only because they discriminate
on the basis of sexual orientation and
national origin but also because they
should be redesigned to more effectively
screen out all types of HIV risk and there
fore make the blood supply safer.
The questions were written by the FDA
in the early days of the AIDS epidemic,
before the HIV blood test was available
and when the disease was found almost
exclusively among gay men. The policy
made sense at the time, but now is desper
ately outdated.
Today, the most accurate way to identi
fy high-risk donors is to ask about all risk
behavior that a person has engaged in
since six months before their last negative
HIV-antibody test, especially those behav
iors that occurred in the six months before
the donation date.
The six-month time frame reflects the
maximum length of the window period
where a person is infected with HIV but
still has a negative antibody test. Anyone
who has engaged in no HIV risk behavior
since six months before their last negative

antibody test is at a very low risk for pass
ing on HIV through donated blood and
should not be arbitrarily screened out just
on the basis of their sexual orientation or
national origin.
It is only fair and prudent that the
blood donation risk behavior questions
include heterosexual sex in addition to gay
sex and drug use.
At the time the current questions were
written, AIDS in the U.S. was almost
entirely found among homosexual men.
Now, however, it is clear that HIV is com
monly transmitted by heterosexual sex.
The CDC reports that in 1998 about
7,(KK) of the new AIDS cases in the U.S.
could be traced to heterosexual transmis
sion of HIV. The figure for men who have
sex with men is only about twice that.
Another important reason why we
oppose the policy is that it perpetuates the
idea that AIDS is just a gay disease. By
saying that it is okay to donate blood if
you have had any number of unsafe het
erosexual partners but that it is not okay if
you have had just one gay partner, regard
less of protection, the FDA is sending a
dangerous and false message: that gay sex
puts you at high risk for AIDS while

unsafe heterosexual sex does not.
The Daily is correct in pointing out that
the screening questions were not written
by the Stanford Blood Center but by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
In light of this fact, we are starting a let
ter-writing campaign to the members of
the Blood Products Advisory Committee
of the FDA, asking them to put reviewing
the current screening questions on their
meeting agenda. We will suggest that they
revise the questions to be non-discrimina
tory and more accurate in screening out all
types of HIV risk.
We will also be voicing our concerns to
the leadership of the Stanford Blood Cen
ter in hope that they will support us in our
efforts to oppose the current policy.

Stanford students aren V dis

I am writing in response to Professor
Hmeritus Ronald Hilton's letter in last
Thursday's Daily regarding the annual Hal
loween festivities at the Mausoleum.
As a graduate of the "Animal Farm," as
Professor Hilton so derisively puts it. I find
it distressing that an estfcemed Stanford
professor would stereotype all Stanford
students and alumni as relentless revelers
with no regard or respect for our Universi
ty's founders and benefactors.
It alarms me to read his conclusion that
we arc not our country's "brightest and
best" solely based on the fact that Stanford
students continue the long-standing tradi
tion of celebrating Halloween at Jane and
1 eland Stanford's final resting place.
I would venture to say that most, if not
all, Stanford students and graduates are
well aware of the sacrifices that the Stan
fords made many decades ago. We realize
that we continue to benefit from those con
tributions of long ago even today and even
after leaving the University.
Perhaps those who claim that the Stan
ford student body have no respect for the
founders could try observing the student

turnout on Founders' Day. Maybe they
could ask students who took Anthropology
Prof. John Kick's tour of University history
(which, incidentally, includes the Mau
soleum and other tributes to deceased indi
viduals that played paramount roles in the
fate of a fledgling Stanford University) how
they feel about Senator and Mrs. Stanford's
influence on their education.
I contend that such critics would quickly
realize that students have an enormous
sense of appreciation of the fact that the
Stanfords did not just turn away from the
world in grief when their only son died, but
instead dedicated themselves to creating a
namesake institution of higher learning in
his honor that would serve future genera
tions, the country and the world for a long
time to come.
Certainly, my sentiments and gratitude
toward the Stanfords have remained con
sistent despite my attendance at the Mau

tions. I'd like to request respectfully that
those who wish to make statements regard

Editorial lacking in details
and analysis
The Daily editorial on Friday, Nov. 5
managed to polarize what could have been
a very enlightened and positive discussion

about today's blood screening procedures
and the gay community's current attitude
towards AIDS.
Running under the headline "Blood
Center policy justified," it was woefully
lacking in any examination of this policy
and presented neither facts nor historical
analysis to back up its claim. Even if the
Blood Center policy is justified, those con
cerns that have been raised should not be
dismissed out of hand with such an
appalling lack of objective argument.
First we are informed that it is pointless
to pursue this issue at the local level as the
policies are set by the federal government.
Surely it makes sense to examine the situa
tion locally to see if there is a problem
before going running off to Washington.
Second, in an amazingly bizarre twist,
we learn that all social injustices come as a
package. Apparently, in order to address
any possible instances of discrimination,
you must become an advocate for all; oth
erwise "accusations of homophobia are bla
tantly one-dimensional."
Third we are told that given the "dis
turbingly" high incidence of AIDS amongst
gay men, "it seems sensible to play it safe
and screen for these risk factors."
Although I find the choice of wording
suspiciously moral in tone, I could let it pass
if this line of logic had been accompanied
with facts. What arc the current levels of
AIDS in the gay male population? How are
these levels changing? How effective is a
questionnaire at screening? Would other
questions be as effective? Are all at-risk
groups treated equally? When was this
policy instated and has it been reviewed
since that time?
Fourth it is argued that we are not
allowed to raise concerns without first
having all the answers: "The burden of
proof clearly lays with the Center's oppo
nents, and they have not fulfilled it." The
use of the term opponents adds a con
frontational tone that is new to the discus
sion, and surely in an academic environ
ment you shouldn't be afraid to ask why
without lirst knowing the answer. Sonic
times that way you can learn something
instead ot just convincing yourself of what
you believed all along.
Finally it is suggested that the current
policies could not be homophobic because
it would be "foolish (and unlikely) that
architects of such policies would actively
work to exclude any segments of the pop
ulation without good reason." All homo
phobia is foolish, unlikely and without
good reason, and yet it certainly exists,
intent notwithstanding. To believe social
injustice can't exist because il doesn't
make sense is certainly the ultimate case
of denial.
Not only docs it show a shocking lack of

thought and research for the work of a
Stanford student or serious journalist; this
editorial also fails in exactly the same way
it accuses those who raised the concerns
have failed: "they fail to address the truly
important issue at hand: ensuring the safe
ty of the blood supply."
After reading this article I have no idea
whether the current policy ensures safety
or not. AP I have learned is that the author
has a disturbingly deferential attitude
toward authority: don't bother trying to
question anything as you can't change it
anyway and why would you want to
change it because those in charge have
only our best interest at heart.

Blood Center policy should
be redesigned
Recently, The Daily claimed that the
discriminatory policy of the Stanford
Blood Center is a sensible way to ensure
the safety of the blood supply and that the
opponents of the policy had failed to pre

sent a sufficient argument as to why the
policy is wrong.
We oppose the current screening ques
tions not only because they discriminate
on the basis of sexual orientation and
national origin but also because they
should be redesigned to more effectively
screen out all types of HIV risk and there
fore make the blood supply safer.
The questions were written by the FDA
in the early days of the AIDS epidemic,
before the HIV blood test was available
and when the disease was found almost
exclusively among gay men. The policy
made sense at the time, but now is desper
ately outdated.
Today, the most accurate way to identi
fy high-risk donors is to ask about all risk
behavior that a person has engaged in
since six months before their last negative
HIV-antibody test, especially those behav
iors that occurred in the six months before
the donation date.
The six-month time frame reflects the
maximum length of the window period
where a person is infected with HIV but
still has a negative antibody test. Anyone
who has engaged in no HIV risk behavior
since six months before their last negative

antibody test is at a very low risk for pass
ing on HIV through donated blood and
should not be arbitrarily screened out just
on the basis of their sexual orientation or
national origin.
It is only fair and prudent that the
blood donation risk behavior questions
include heterosexual sex in addition to gay
sex and drug use.
At the time the current questions were
written, AIDS in the U.S. was almost
entirely found among homosexual men.
Now, however, it is clear that HIV is com
monly transmitted by heterosexual sex.
The CDC reports that in 1998 about
7,(KK) of the new AIDS cases in the U.S.
could be traced to heterosexual transmis
sion of HIV. The figure for men who have
sex with men is only about twice that.
Another important reason why we
oppose the policy is that it perpetuates the
idea that AIDS is just a gay disease. By
saying that it is okay to donate blood if
you have had any number of unsafe het
erosexual partners but that it is not okay if
you have had just one gay partner, regard
less of protection, the FDA is sending a
dangerous and false message: that gay sex
puts you at high risk for AIDS while

unsafe heterosexual sex does not.
The Daily is correct in pointing out that
the screening questions were not written
by the Stanford Blood Center but by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
In light of this fact, we are starting a let
ter-writing campaign to the members of
the Blood Products Advisory Committee
of the FDA, asking them to put reviewing
the current screening questions on their
meeting agenda. We will suggest that they
revise the questions to be non-discrimina
tory and more accurate in screening out all
types of HIV risk.
We will also be voicing our concerns to
the leadership of the Stanford Blood Cen
ter in hope that they will support us in our
efforts to oppose the current policy.

unsafe heterosexual sex does not.
The Daily is correct in pointing out that
the screening questions were not written
by the Stanford Blood Center but by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
In light of this fact, we are starting a let
ter-writing campaign to the members of
the Blood Products Advisory Committee
of the FDA, asking them to put reviewing
the current screening questions on their
meeting agenda. We will suggest that they
revise the questions to be non-discrimina
tory and more accurate in screening out all
types of HIV risk.
We will also be voicing our concerns to
the leadership of the Stanford Blood Cen
ter in hope that they will support us in our
efforts to oppose the current policy.
