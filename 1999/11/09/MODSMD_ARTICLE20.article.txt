The good news is that Stanford
remains in the thick of the nation
al title hunt. After ;i win against
No. S IJC-Santa Barbara on Sun
day. Stanford still has a chance to
earn the top seed at the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation tourna
ment. Furthermore, the Cardinal
can still finish the season with the
nation's best overall record, which
would earn the team an automatic
bid to the NCAA Tournament.
Stanford (17-3.6-1 MPS1 ) and
I J( I A (10-2,7-0) met for the third
time this season on Saturday. The
teams split their two previous
meetings, with the Cardinal win
ning iii the SoCal tournament

semifinals and the Bruins earning
a victory in a league game at
dcGuerre Pool.
On Saturday, the Cardinal
squad suffered from a lethal "com
bination of poot team defense and
poor scoring." Stanford head
coach Dante Dcttamanti said, and
fell 10-8 to IJCLA.
After play ing fine team defense
against No. 3 USC 1 he last two
weeks, holding the Trojans to
eight goals in two games. Stanford
"just realh fell apart on defense."
Dcttamanti said.
I'lie problems started early as
I J( I A jumped out to a 3-0 lead in
the l irsi quarter off goals by Adam
Wright. Malt Armato and Sean
Kern. However, the Stanford
"guys stayed cool and didn't
panic." Dcttamanti said.
I he Cardinal came back in the
second quarter to knot the score at
four, scoring on a ft-on-5 goal by
redshirt sophomore Pasi Dutton.a
backhand shot from senior hole
man Mike I.ipinski and a two
point goal by senior Sean Joy.
But the tie wouldn't last long as
the Stanford defense suffered an
other letdown in the third period,
giving up three goals to the Bruins
while the Cardinal offense was

only able to score one.
Three more goals by UCLA in
the fourth period stretched the
Bruins' lead to four, making the
score l()-ft. Stanford was able It)
close the gap to two after a two
point goal by Dutton but was un
able to score again.

[It was] a combination of poor defense and poor scoring
... [UCLA] took advantage of every mistake we made.'
— Dante Dettamanti

l\vo statistics told the story of
the game. The Bruins scored 10
points on 21 shots while the ('ardi
nal scored only eight on 30 shots.
And UCLA completed five of
seven man-up opportunities for
scores while Stanford was only two
of six.
While "we drew ejections, we
just couldn't score on the fi-on-5.
And we had been doing so well on
6-on-5 in our last few games." Det
tamanti said.
Simply, the Bruins "took ad
vantage of every mistake we
made." Dettamanti said.
1 Jowever. there were some pos
itives for the Stanford squad in the
game. I he Cardinal did a fine job
defensively against the Bruins'po

tent counterattack. Offensively,
the holemen played particularly
well, especially Lipinski, who con
tributed two goals.
The biggest plus for the Cardi
nal is that with two games against
No. 3 I JSC in the next two weeks,
IJCLA has a big task ahead. If the

Bruins lose only once, Stanford
has a good chance to finish first in
the MPSF. II UCLA loses twice,
Stanford should finish with the na
tion's best record, securing a trip
to the national tournament.
The Cardinal kept itself in the
national title hunt with an impor
tant league win against UC-Santa
Barabara (9-11. 2-5) on Sunday.
While Stanford was a bit slug
gish after the battle with the Bru
ins, "we played well enough to
win," Dettamanti said.
The Cardinal put the game out
of reach early, taking a 3-0 lead
after the first period and going up
4-0 early in the second. But the
