I'lie Cardinal fielded a total of
three teams for the tourney: a var

one mixed group. They ;ill compet

Stanford alumni during the week

In its first two games, the A

Stanford was then pitted
against a very strong alumni squad
in the finals. The match turned out
to be the ( ardinal's toughest of the
fall season so far. In the end. how
ever. it prevailed, and its record re
mained unblemished.
Afterward, the players were
grateful for the competition and
for the insight it gave them into the
team's strengths and weaknesses.
"We saw some things we need-

Ed to work on," said senior Eli
Frankel, including "communicat
ing more as a team and realigning
on defense."
Overall, though, coach Franck
Boivert was very happy with what
he saw. I le was impressed with the
individual improvements of many
of the players, especially in the
areas of positioning and decision
making.
"I he biggest improvement
from last year, though," Boivert
said, "is that the enthusiasm is even
better."
I he Cardinal is hoping for this
enthusiasm to continue through
out its exhibition games and into
the regular season.
In particular, the players need
to bring this energy into next Sat
urday's grudge match with Sacra
mento State.
Stanford has played an annual
exhibition game against the Divi
sion II school in recent years, and
last fall's matchup produced the
Cardinal's first loss in the series.
"We got beat pretty bad by
them last year." Boivert said, "so
that game's going to be a matter of
honor."
After that, the Cardinal will face
its toughest test of the fall on New.
