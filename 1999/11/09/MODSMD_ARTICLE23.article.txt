I'ldon Speed and Philip C'hiara
monte. I he Stanford Bookstore's top
two managers, have a host of
perquisites at their disposal: high
end autoinohiles. ;i vacation home, a
I lolida\ Rambler motor home, a hot
tub and a sailboat all paid for by
the Bookstore.
I veil without the perquisites,
however. Speed and ( hiaianionic
appear t< > be among the best paid col
lege bookstore managers in the
c< >untr\. Asol two years ago. Speed's
base sal;ir\ was $112.5(H). according
to the Bookstore's |U,S l M)0 tax re
tin 11. the latest such return the Book
store has liled w ith the Intelnal Rev
enue Service.
( hiaraniontc. the Bookstore's as
sistant manager, was making
$ 102.5(H) at the time, according to the
return.
In an intei \ iew. Speed declined to
disclose his current salarv But if past
years' increases are am indication,
he is likely making close to$l30.(HX)
this year.
"Wish it were so." Speed s;ikI
when presented with the $13().(HH)
figure.
VVhatevei the precise amount.
Speed's salarx is clearly among the
highest, if not the highest, in the col
lege bookstore business. According
to ;i sui \ e\ conducted b\ the Nation
al Association ol ( ollegc Stores.
onl\ a handful ol store general man
agers in the country were making
nk ti e than $72.1 H)() as of Jan. I. I Wl.
Of the 59 stores surveyed with
sales volume greater than $6 million.
onl\ li\e of the stores' highest paid
managers were making more than

$72,000. according to the survey,
which had a hO-percent response
rate, says Steve Johnson of the Na
tional Association of ( ollcgc Stores.
I he trade association's findings
are consistent with those ol a less for
mal survey ol the largest stores in the
industry conducted b\ Ihe Daily.
None of the managers contacted by
I he Daily reported making more
than SI 10.000 a year.
Manager since l*>7l
I Jndoubtcdly. two reasons for the
si/e ol Speed and ( hiaramonte's
salaries are their seniority and the
sheer magnitude ol the operation
they oversee. Both have been man
agers at the Bookstore for more than
20 years. Speed was named, general
manager in l ( *7l and hail previously
worked as managei ol the Brigham
Young I Jniversity bookstore.
In addition to running the main
campus store in White Plaza. the
Stanford Bookstore also runs the
hack House, which sells athletic
clothing: and I rcsiddcr I Express, a
convenience store located in I rcsid
dcr I Jnion.
In recent years, the Bookstore has
also capitalized a for-profit sub
sidiarv calledSßl Affiliates. I he sub
sidiarv. which is separately incorpo
rated and has its own set ol officers
and directors, runs the Stanford
Belokstore Pali> AIU». which provides
medical and technical texts: the I ni
\eisitx Shop, which sells Stanford
clothing and souvenirs in the Stan
ford Shopping ( enter: and a half
do/en small community college
bookstores in the Bay Area and
Southern ( alilornia.
Last year, the consolidated sales
of the Bookstore and its subsidiary
reached 53N.9 million, according to
figures the store provided to Dun A:

Bradstreet. the firm that supplies
credit information on most U.S. busi
nesses.
Based on sales volume, the Book
store is without question one ol the
largest college stores in the nation.
But conversations with managers at
the other largest stores suggest that
Stanford is startlingly unique when it
conies to offering perquisites.
'Nothing for personal use'
In fact, the only other bookstore
I he Daily came across at which any
ol the managers have use of book
store automobiles is the I 'niversitj
ol Washington, which has annual
sales ol about $40 million, roughly
the same as the Stanford Bookstore.
Robert ( ross, the store's general
managei for the last IS years, is pro
sided ssitli a bookstore sail to drive
to and from work, he says, but dur
ing the day.the same van is used to
make store deliveries. No other
managers at his store have use of
bookstore vehicles, says ( ross. svlio
wouldn't disclose his precise salars
but said it s\as in the range of $90,000
to $100,000.
At I larvard's campus store, none
of the managers have bookstore an
tomobiles. "Wedon't haseany cars."
sas s Alex Arnold, the assistant to the
store's president. "In fact, sve have
nothing for personal use."
I ike the Stanford Bookstore. I lie
( oop is a nonprofit entity I lie store
seises both Harvard and Mi l . and
sales run about $M million a year, ac
cording to Arnold.
At the I ( I A bookstore, svliere
sales are close to $54 million, and at
the I'iiiversitv of Southern ( alilor
nia bookstore, where sales are
around $35 million, none of the man
agers are pr< >sided ssitli cars or use of
vacation facilities either.

The idea of college bookstores
prov iding vehicles and vacation lacil
itics to its employees startled main
of those in the bookstore industry
questioned by'I he Daily. "Oh. gosh
no." said Pam I lorton. the managei
i>t the Rice University Bookstore,
when asked about providing vehicles
to her employees." W hat land d< > y < >u

"People in the (college book

paid." savs Johnson, who conducted
the survey for the National Associa
tion of C 'oilcue Stores. " I hey re eas

'An uninteresting argument'
I listory Prof. Peter Stansky. pres

comparison toother stores "unintei

"I don't find it an interestingargu
