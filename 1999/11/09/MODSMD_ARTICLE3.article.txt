# Committee tackles housing
## Administrators struggle to find affordable faculty homes 
### Keith Proctor Contributing writer 
The shortage of Bay Area houses
and the astronomical prices of those
available are causing the University
to re-assess current policies and in
vestigate building new housing units
for faculty.
The number of available homes
on and around the Stanford campus
has shrunk from 90 on the market in
April 1991 to justa handful by Octo
ber of this year, said Carolyn Sar
gent, director of faculty and staff
housing.
Members of a new Provost's
committee formed to investigate the
housing shortage discussed the issue
with the Faculty Senate during its
Oct. 28 meeting. The chair of the
new committee. Dean of the School
of Earth Sciences Franklin Orr.
agreed to investigate the housing
policies of other universities located

in high-cost housing markets.
"We are in the most pressing
housing crisis we've ever faced." As
sociate Provost Jeff Wachtel said.
The housing shortage dissuades
possible recruits from joining the
University faculty, Wachtel said. In
addition, current faculty members
have raised concerns about their
ability to continue to afford to live
near campus.
"It used to be that housing would
not stand in the way of someone
coming to the University, but now it
is," Wachtel said. "I don't want peo
ple saying they can't join our univer
sity because housing is too expen
sive."
Gavin Jones, associate professor
of English and a new addition to the
faculty this year, reflects on how the
housing crunch affects recruitment
and junior faculty life.
"I felt the housing was so expen
sive in Palo Alto that it reallv wasn't

worth living there," said Jones, who
opted to live in and commute from
San Francisco. " This is the first time
I've had to commute to work, and I
don't like it."
Yet a possible source of relief
may loom on the horizon. Ihe I Jni
versity's Land Use Plan requests au
thorization from Santa Clara Coun
ty to build 430 new homes on cam
pus.
In some neighborhoods, the
thought of building new homes has
sparked a heated debate. Some fac
ulty and staff oppose the construc
tion of new homes in the open
spaces near their own houses.
"We're trying to work with I hose
groups opposed to building in their
areas." Wachtel said. "They live in
those neighborhoods and are com
mitted to Stanford, so I'm hoping we
can develop an ongoing dialogue
