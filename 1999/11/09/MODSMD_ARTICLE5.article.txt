# Union, hospital ink 2-year deal
## 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
Alter 10 months of stalled nego
tiations, the standoff between
UCSF-Stanford Hospital and a
workers' union has finally ended.
Hut the agreement might not last
for long, due to the dissolution of
the merger.
Last Friday, members of Loeal
Union 715 at Stanford Hospital
voted to aceept their first union
contract with UCSF-Stanford. The
two-year contract calls for a 3-per
cent wage increase per year, abol
ishes a merit system of pay and cre
ates a seniority system for union
members.
The 10 months of contract nego
tiations between union leaders and
hospital officials played out against
;i backdrop of deep problems for
I ! (\SF-Stanford. Finally, after
months of financial losses and
mounting crticism. both sides
agreed to dissolve the merger on
Oct. 28.
The merger's dissolution places
the union in an uncertain position,
because the new contract binds
UCSF-Stanford and Local 715.
When the two merged parties split
and Stanford resumes sole control
of Stanford Hospital, University
administrators will decide whether
or not to honor the contract.
"This has been a roller coaster
the whole time," said Harry
Adams, the chief union negotiator.
"We felt it was important [to get a

contract with UCSF-Stanford]
since UCSF-Stanford was the em
ployer â€” and still is the employer.
Now we continue to pursue a com
mitment from Stanford University
that it will continue the terms of
contract."
University President Gerhard
Casper was out of town yesterday
and could not comment, Director
of University Communications
Alan A cost a said.
Adams said the contract carries
special significance because it is the
union's first with the hospital.
"First off. the hospital workers
have never had a contract," Adams
said. "Everything we negotiated is
significant in that even if they are
current policies, they no longer can
he changed and have to be negoti
ated with the union."
The seniority system, which
Adams called one of the deal's key
components, makes workers with
the longest tenure the first in line to
transfer and the last to lose their
jobs in the event of lay-offs.
It replaces a merit-based pay
system, taking ultimate discretion
over employees' wages away from
managers.
Hospital management was also
pleased with the contract. "We are
very pleased that a contract has
been reached that is mutually satis
factory to both sides," said Mike
Lassiter. a UCSF-Stanford
spokesman.
