# Union, hospital ink 2-year deal
## 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
Alter 10 months of stalled nego
tiations, the standoff between
UCSF-Stanford Hospital and a
workers' union has finally ended.
Hut the agreement might not last
for long, due to the dissolution of
the merger.
Last Friday, members of Loeal
Union 715 at Stanford Hospital
voted to aceept their first union
contract with UCSF-Stanford. The
two-year contract calls for a 3-per
cent wage increase per year, abol
ishes a merit system of pay and cre
ates a seniority system for union
members.
The 10 months of contract nego
tiations between union leaders and
hospital officials played out against
;i backdrop of deep problems for
I ! (\SF-Stanford. Finally, after
months of financial losses and
mounting crticism. both sides
agreed to dissolve the merger on
Oct. 28.
The merger's dissolution places
the union in an uncertain position,
because the new contract binds
UCSF-Stanford and Local 715.
When the two merged parties split
and Stanford resumes sole control
of Stanford Hospital, University
administrators will decide whether
or not to honor the contract.
"This has been a roller coaster
the whole time," said Harry
Adams, the chief union negotiator.
"We felt it was important [to get a

contract with UCSF-Stanford]
since UCSF-Stanford was the em
ployer — and still is the employer.
Now we continue to pursue a com
mitment from Stanford University
that it will continue the terms of
contract."
University President Gerhard
Casper was out of town yesterday
and could not comment, Director
of University Communications
Alan A cost a said.
Adams said the contract carries
special significance because it is the
union's first with the hospital.
"First off. the hospital workers
have never had a contract," Adams
said. "Everything we negotiated is
significant in that even if they are
current policies, they no longer can
he changed and have to be negoti
ated with the union."
The seniority system, which
Adams called one of the deal's key
components, makes workers with
the longest tenure the first in line to
transfer and the last to lose their
jobs in the event of lay-offs.
It replaces a merit-based pay
system, taking ultimate discretion
over employees' wages away from
managers.
Hospital management was also
pleased with the contract. "We are
very pleased that a contract has
been reached that is mutually satis
factory to both sides," said Mike
Lassiter. a UCSF-Stanford
spokesman.
Despite its acceptance of the
contract. Local 715 was unable to
accomplish many of its goals.
Adams said the union intends to
ask Stanford for a pledge of neu
trality if other workers decide to
unionize.
"The No. 1 thing we didn't get
was neutrality for future organiz
ing campaigns," Adams said.
"Management didn't agree to re
main neutral in case (the remain
ing] 2,000 workers wanted to orga
nize."
Such a pledge would include
promises by hospital officials to not
call in consultants and would pro
hibit one-on-one meetings be
tween supervisors and employees,
which union leaders fear could be
used to spread anti-union senti
ment.
The union's demand for a neu
trality pledge was supported in an
October letter written by William
Ciould, former chairman of the Na
tional Labor Relations Board and
a professor at the Law School.
In the letter, addressed to
Casper and the UCSF-Stanford
Hospital Board of Directors,
Gould urged Stanford to adopt a
position of neutrality in future
union campaigns.
Despite the uncertainty created
by the dissolution of the merger,
Adams said he welcomed the deci
sion.
"The merger has been a disaster
from the beginning and workers
and patients have suffered from it,"
he said. "In the long term it is bet

tor for workers and patients to re
turn control here, since there is
more accountability and fiscal con
trol."
At the end of the contract's two
years, Adams said the union will
negotiate with whoever is running
the hospital at the time. "We hope
the financial situation will im
prove," he said.
Since the start of the school
year, Union 715 has staged several
protests on campus to highlight the
continuing contract negotiations.
In the last month, students and
workers have organized a candle
light vigil and a noontime rally at
White Plaza and protested outside
Casper's office.
Student participants in those
rallies praised the contract.
"I think it's great," said junior
Jennifer Wekselbaum, a member
of the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition. "It shows keeping the
pressure up and getting the word
out helps get a fair contract."
Now that wortorrhnvrvrned m -
accept a contract, the union's fu
ture on campus is unclear.
Adams said Local 715 has no
plans for protests or rallies at Stan
ford in the near future.
However, he said the union
would continue to try to get Casper
to pledge to honor the terms of the
contract.
"We don't want hints that some
one won't recognize it." Adams
said. "I think it is appropriate to '
keep pushing for neutrality.
Throughout the year Casper has '
said he is not responsible. .. .With
control back at Stanford he is in a
position to make simple commit
ments to us."

rallies praised the contract.
"I think it's great," said junior
Jennifer Wekselbaum, a member
of the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition. "It shows keeping the
pressure up and getting the word
out helps get a fair contract."
Now that wortorrhnvrvrned m -
accept a contract, the union's fu
ture on campus is unclear.
Adams said Local 715 has no
plans for protests or rallies at Stan
ford in the near future.
However, he said the union
would continue to try to get Casper
to pledge to honor the terms of the
contract.
"We don't want hints that some
one won't recognize it." Adams
said. "I think it is appropriate to '
keep pushing for neutrality.
Throughout the year Casper has '
said he is not responsible. .. .With
control back at Stanford he is in a
position to make simple commit
ments to us."
