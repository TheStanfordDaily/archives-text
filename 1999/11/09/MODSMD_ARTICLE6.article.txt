## Historian defends study of art 
### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
Art history persists in modern
universities largeh because of "the
sheer pleasure ol looking" at art. art
historian Svetlana Alpers said in her
presidential lecture last night at the
Law School.
In front of a packed audience,
Alpers led a detailed discussion ot
paintings b\ Velasquez and narrat
ed some of her early experiences in
art history scholarship.
In one piece by Velasquez, which
depicts women spinning thread in a
tapcstiA workshop, both the "inter
nal facts" and the "external facts"
are important. Alpers said.
In the background of the piece.
Velasquez painted a scene from a
tale by ()vid.
Hie question Velasquez explores
is whether "Arachnac owes some
thing to any teacher" and not
whether she is the best artist among
her peers.
As an object of envy among
peers. Velasquez's particular depic
tion of Arachnac represents his own
freedom from the envy of other
artists. Alpers said.
Velasquez paints wispy strands
"in a toss of drapery." Alpers said,
which recalls the style of one of his
predecessors. Titian.
This engagement with past artis
tic masters contributes to the forma
tion of viewers' expectations. Alpers
suggested.
Alpers argued that successful
paintings in the past have met view
ers' expectations with surprise.
laced with a painting by the
Dutch artist Del looch. for example,
which depicts a domestic scene with
a woman enshrouded in the shadow
of an archway, one expects to see the
painted wooden doors and signs of
household work, she said.

One is surprised, however, that
the woman is looking off into the
light, her head turned.
"Post-modem" art generally fails
to provide this same satisfaction,
Alpers said, because it only surpris
es. without contributing to a tradi
tion that builds the viewer's expecta
tions beforehand.
"Our expectations are shaped

from having viewed other paintings
[from the past]," she said, adding
that there is no way to tell whether a
painting has "succeeded" when
there are no expectations.
" There is something... 'acade
mic' about repeatedly serving up
surprises." she said with reference to
