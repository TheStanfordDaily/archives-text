## 
### Kelly Donoghue Contributing writer 
Twelve Stanford graduate stu
dents are the first to benefit from a
l l >% grant of $625,(XX) from the Na
tional Endowment for the Humani
ties.
The grant has allowed the Hu
manities Center to provide a finan
cial basis for its external fellowship
program and increase the number
of awards offered to graduate stu
dents.
"The grant and the gifts made in
matching funds have made it possi
ble to fund up to six dissertation fel

lowships at the center," said Keith
Baker, the center's director. "Other
funds were used to support external
faculty fellowships."
The Humanities Center, estab
lished in 19N0. was one of the first
campus-based research organiza
tions in the United States. The cen
ter encourages research in the hu
manities. proposing opportunities
for one-year residential fellow
ships. public presentations and re
search workshops.
The center considered more
than 3(M) applicants for the grant, in
fields including music, history, com
parative literature, art history. Eng

lish. religious studies, classics.
Asian languages and philosophy.
The large number of applicants
reveals the appeal of the interdisci
plinary opportunities available at
the Humanities Center as well the
broad spectrum of interests repre
sented.
Meg Worley, a doctoral candi
date in comparative literature, is
one of the 12 students to benefit
from the grant. She will use the
grant to pursue a dissertation that
will explore the collaborations of
translators in five different loca
tions and six languages throughout
a 7(X)-year period of the Middle

Ages.
"The real benefit of the grant,"
Worley said, "is the opportunity it
provides. I am able to have an office
at the Center, which increases my
productivity, and I am able to eat
lunch with senior fellows and other
graduate students everyday and
hear different perspectives and ob
serve a mixture of approaches."
"The senior fellows and gradu
ate students are all considered
equals in the eyes of the Humanities
Center," she said, "while not in the
eyes of the Academy. When one
leaves the center, it is like being
kicked out of paradise."
