Sayantani
DasGupta,
M.D., M.P.H
Sayantani DasGupta, a young
Indian American woman,
entered medical school with
a vision of saving lives and
making the world a better
place. What she found instead
was a difficult path of politics,
sexism, and red tape. Based
on wry "field notes" she took
throughout her journey in
the healing profession, this
enlightening story of learning
to be a doctor will provoke
tears, laughter, and thoughtful
reflection
