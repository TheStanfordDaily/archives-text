Kennedy served as University
president from 1980 until 1992, and
University provost and Biological
Sciences Department chairman be
fore his tenure as president. He is

"[The Science position is] quite a

for me and for Stanford."
Kennedy plans to edit the jour

though he will spend several days a
month in Washington. D.C. at the

Science has the highest circula

well-known for its science news re

as well as its publication of academ

ation for the Advancement of Sci
ence. which is the world's largest
federation of scientists.
Kennedy says it's too soon to say

take will be the result of a consider
able getting-aequainted process."
he said. "But one of the big ques
tions will be what we do about the
unfolding future of electronic pub
lishing."
He also said that he wanted to
help maintain the quality of a jour-
