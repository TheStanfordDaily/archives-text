â€” Donald Kennedy

Kennedy served as University
president from 1980 until 1992, and
University provost and Biological
Sciences Department chairman be
fore his tenure as president. He is

currently a professor of environ
mental science at Stanford's Insti
tute for International Studies.
"[The Science position is] quite a
wonderful job." said Kennedy to
the Daily. "I think it's a good thing
for me and for Stanford."
Kennedy plans to edit the jour
nal primarily from California,
though he will spend several days a
month in Washington. D.C. at the
journal's offices there.
Science has the highest circula
tion of any scientific journal. It is
well-known for its science news re
porting and policy debate forums,
as well as its publication of academ
ic projects. It was established by
Thomas Edison and is now the offi
cial journal of the American Associ
ation for the Advancement of Sci
ence. which is the world's largest
federation of scientists.
Kennedy says it's too soon to say
what effect he will have on the pub
lication. "I think the direction we
take will be the result of a consider
able getting-aequainted process."
he said. "But one of the big ques
tions will be what we do about the
unfolding future of electronic pub
lishing."
He also said that he wanted to
help maintain the quality of a jour-


Kennedy
nal that he sees as having found a
successful formula, especially inso
far as Science has increased its focus
on policy-making issues and has de
veloped a quality news-reporting
team.
"Science has made an awfully
creative series of changes in the past
few years," Kennedy said.
Kennedy has a great deal of ex
perience in science policy-making.
At various times in his life, he has
worked for the National Research
Council, the White I louse ()ffice of
Science and Technology Policy and
the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis
tration. Now he works on health
and environmental policy issues at

Stanford.
Biological Sciences Prof. Paul
Ehrlich said his colleague's ap
pointment was a perfect match for
the maga/ine and lor Kennedy.
"He is the smartest and most
broad-minded scientist I know. He
knows the major institutions in
volved. . . He's also a superb
craftsperson with words," lihrlich
said.
Kennedy will become editor in
chief effective Jun. I, 2000. He
plans to reduce his teaching load
for the first year and says he will de
vote about half of his time to the
journal. ,
After that, lie said he will retire
from Stanford. Kennedy said that
he had planned to end his career at
Stanford at around that time any
way. "I'll be 70. after all." he said.
