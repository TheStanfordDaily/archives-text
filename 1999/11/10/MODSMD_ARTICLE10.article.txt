# Panel of experts discusses security

### Amy Christeson 
What is the government's role in
computer surveillance? Do people
have the right to a private conversa
tion or can the government access
any information it wants?
These questions and more were
addressed in a two-hour panel dis
cussion sponsored by the Law
School's Program in Law, Science
and Technology, the Computer Sci
ence Department and the Associa
tion for Computing Machinery last
night.
The sponsors hoped to publicize
the implications that the Federal In
trusion Detection Network (FID-
Net) would have. FIDNet is part of
an executive order issued by Presi
dent Clinton earlier this year. It is a
set of "new technology tools, capa
bilities or legal authorities" designed
to "prosecute violations of the law."

Scott Charney, Whitfield Diffie
and Marc Rotenburg debated while
John Markoff moderated the event
held in Kresge auditorium. Markoff,
a West Coast correspondent for The
New York Times, began the discus
sion by saying that "we are encom
passed in an emerging global net
work." This leads, he said, to "new
challenges for law enforcement and
new threats to civil liberties."
One of these issues is the method
that the government should use to
protect information. "The U.S. gov
ernment and NASA get hacked all
of the time," Charney said.
I le cited a figure that government
information is illegally accessed
more than 2(X),(KH) times a year and
feels "it is irresponsible for the gov
ernment to not protect its informa
tion."
Charney, who used to work for
the Department of Justice as the

Chief of the Computer Crime and
Intellectual Property Section, feels
that "the broad increase in use of
networks leaves trails wherever we
go." He feels that the use of packet
sniffers, which trail hackers and cre
ate profiles, can be very helpful in
stopping intrusions. I le sees FIDNet
as a useful tool. Diffie, on the other
hand, feels that the debate between
passive versus "counterattack" mea
sures is fundamental to solving the
challenges.
The panelists also discussed how
appropriate FIDNet is in solving the
new challenges. Diffie, developer of
public key cryptography, which is
the basis of modern electronic com
merce, sees FIDNet as "yet another
disagreement in a large framework
of disagreement." Diffie feels that
"this argument is going to go on for
quite awhile, and I am hoping to
drag it out at least until I retire."

Rotenburg paralleled tracking
computer use to detect any unusual
acts to the use of phone taps. Phone
taps, though, are heavily regulated,
and Diffie thinks that "broad-spread
indiscriminate searches" are a
threat. Rotenburg said the funda
mental question is "why is it a pro
ject for the National Security Coun
cil when citizens try to access non
military information?"
Rotenburg testifies before Con
gress on issues including encryption
policy, computer security and com
munications privacy. He is the Di
rector of the Electronic Privacy In
formation Center in Washington,
DC.
Securing federal networks and
protecting intelligence brings up
civil liberty questions "not on the
need for protection, but the scope of
authority and types of checks and ac
countability," Rotenburg said.
