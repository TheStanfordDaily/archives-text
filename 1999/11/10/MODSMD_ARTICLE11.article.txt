Susan Rice, assistant secretary of
state for African Affairs, spoke to
Stanford students last night in C'uh
berly Auditorium about the United
States' stake in fostering a secure and
prosperous Africa.

Rice's speech provided a general
picture of Africa today, and she
spoke <>l positive development such
as the growing democracy in many
African countries.
Her speech also pointed out the
danger of U.S. involvement in Africa
as a result of the frequent outbursts

of war and inhumanity which still
exist within the continent.
Rice defende the need for U.S. in
tervention in Africa to "promote
peace, economic growth, democratic
reformation and human rights."
Rice was invited by Stanford in
Government, a non-partisan, stu

dent-run organization.
"We tend to concentrate on do
mestic policies or European policies.
Rice's intimate involvement with
Africa's current affairs provides a
more diverse look into America's
role in international politics," said
Lauren Inouye, co-director of the
Public Policy Forum.
Rice was also chosen to speak be
cause of her ties with Stanford. Grad
uating from Stanford Phi Beta
Kappa with a B.A. in History in 1986,
she has gone on to serve in a variety
of political roles.
Rice has served at the White
House as,special assistant to the
President and senior director for
African Affairs, where she was re
sponsible for all aspects of U.S. poli
cy toward Africa.
"The United States seeks to find
democratic partners in Africa to ap
prehend terrorists, deny extremists
and curb diseases in the continent,"
Rice said.
Africa also is prime for American
businesses due to its "abundance in
natural resources," Rice said.
I lowever, not all agree with the
Rice's perception of Africa as a place
of economic investment.
"It seems that the American gov
ernment is more concerned with its
own prosperous gains in African
than promoting human rights in the
continent" said freshman Matt
Kraft.
