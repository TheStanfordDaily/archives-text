# Stanford defends method of burning medical waste
## 
### Eileen Chao Contributing writer 
Despite student protests against
Stanford's dioxin-releasing method
of medical waste disposal, the Uni
versity is defending its use of an Inte
grated Environmental Systems /
Norcal incinerator, saying it is the
most efficient means available.
In Oakland last week, Stanford
students and community organiza
tions gathered at a public hearing to
discuss the new permit that the Bay
Area Air Quality Management Dis
trict may issue to lES.
The permit in contention would
combine all regulatory requirements
into a universal document for the
company, the public and BAAQMD
and would strengthen regulations.
"This permit adds stronger moni
toring and reporting requirements
[to the old permit], as well as oppor
tunities for citizens to sue when the
facility fails to meet regulations," said
Steve Hill, a member of BAAQMD.
"There are no changes in the facili
ty's operating procedures."
Despite stronger regulatory mea
sures. opponents of the permit say
they still feel the guidelines aren't
strict enough.
"The ideal solution would be if
the incinerator stopped completely,
and they switched to microwaving or
autoclaving. methods that wouldn't
release dioxins," said sophomore
Jane lie lshida. "But if not, we want
the monitoring standards to be even
stricter."
'Environmental racism'
Opponents of the permit empha
size the issue of "environmental
racism," since the plant pollutes in a

low-income community of color in
Oakland.
"Imagine the plant in the center of
Palo Alto, or even on campus. No
one would put up with it here," Ishi
da said. "Basically, we're dumping
our waste into a poorer community
and forcing them to deal with it."
According to Ishida, Stanford stu
dents — perhaps with the collabora
tion of Stanford Medical School —
plan to write a proposal detailing
their complaints and proposed solu
tions. However, they say those alter
natives are still fuzzy.
"We're not sure if it's feasible to
ask the hospital to switch to autoclav
ing, or maybe just to reduce the
amount of medical waste," Ishida
said. "We're not sure if it's feasible
for them to start using more non-
TVC plastics [which don't emit diox
ins when incinerated]."
Students have other plans to raise
awareness about the issue on cam
pus. There will be a "teach-in" on
Nov. 17 for people to learn more
about "environmental racism." Ishi
da said she hopes to work directly
with the hospital administration and
to pressure the University with peti
tions or letters next quarter.
Hill said he believes that Ishida's
view on "environmental racism" is
inaccurate. He pointed out the fact
that regulation and review have kept
emission rates below BAAQMD
risk levels.
"Based on the science and proce
dures we currently have, the charac
teristics of risk are insignificant," Hill
said. "Without that impact, the issue
isn't environmental injustice."
Stanford's Response
According to junior Colin Ritter,
Stanford contributed 14 percent of
the total waste burned at lES last
year. However, the University said
that it complied with the state of Cal
ifornia's standards for medical waste
disposal.
"There are only so many options
we have under the regulations," said
Larry Gibbs, associate vice provost
for environmental health and safety.
"Everything we do is in compliance
with California regulation."
Gibbs said Stanford uses lES be
cause its permit serves as a stamp of
approval. To receive a permit, facili
ties must follow the guidelines creat
ed by BAAQMD.
"[BAAQMD] only issues permits
to those within the guidelines and
[those that] aren't over the safety
limit," Gibbs said. "What we look for
is that the facility has been properly
permitted by regulatory authorities.
"As part of the contract, we will
monitor their permitting and make
sure they have the proper permit to
operate under the regulations."
The regulations
BAAQMD mandates that dioxin
emissions remain below levels that
would increase the risk of cancer for
10 in I,(XX),(XX) people with lifetime
exposure.
According to Hill, although lES
violated the regulations, it did not
necessarily exceed the 10-in
-1,(XX),000 limit. To compensate for

excessive emissions on certain days,
lES lost some of its operation time.
For example, when the facility vi
olates the permit by not using some of
its emission-reducing machines, the
toxicity of its emissions increases by a
factor of 30, according to Hill.
"An hour of bypass like this will
cause the company to lose a day's
worth of allowable operation," Hill
said. "But it doesn't mean that the by
pass makes the company exceed this
10-in-1,000,000 limit."
Ishida said she believes this kind of
limit is ludicrous, because it still in
creases the risk of cancer.
"Basically, it's saying if you kill 10
people out of a million, it's OK," Ishi
da said. "But that is wrong, especially
in a poor area."
Treating the problem with an open
mind
BAAQMD has begun research
ing possible alternatives for waste dis
posal. But Hill said currently, the or
ganization does not feel the incinera
tor poses any health risk to the com
munity.
"We use a source test every year to
check the concentration of sub
stances emitted," he said. "If our per
ception of health risks changes, the
permit is written in a way so we can go
into the permit and change it to ac
commodate the new understanding."
BAAQMD has received many
public comments about the issue and
is now replying to all of them. Hill
said BAAQMD plans to send infor
mation packets to the Environmental
Protection Agency in mid-December
so the EPA can decide whether to ap
prove the permit.

natives are still fuzzy.
"We're not sure if it's feasible to
ask the hospital to switch to autoclav
ing, or maybe just to reduce the
amount of medical waste," Ishida
said. "We're not sure if it's feasible
for them to start using more non-
TVC plastics [which don't emit diox
ins when incinerated]."
Students have other plans to raise
awareness about the issue on cam
pus. There will be a "teach-in" on
Nov. 17 for people to learn more
about "environmental racism." Ishi
da said she hopes to work directly
with the hospital administration and
to pressure the University with peti
tions or letters next quarter.
Hill said he believes that Ishida's
view on "environmental racism" is
inaccurate. He pointed out the fact
that regulation and review have kept
emission rates below BAAQMD
risk levels.
"Based on the science and proce
dures we currently have, the charac
teristics of risk are insignificant," Hill
said. "Without that impact, the issue
isn't environmental injustice."
Stanford's Response
According to junior Colin Ritter,
Stanford contributed 14 percent of
the total waste burned at lES last
year. However, the University said
that it complied with the state of Cal
ifornia's standards for medical waste
disposal.
"There are only so many options
we have under the regulations," said
Larry Gibbs, associate vice provost
for environmental health and safety.
"Everything we do is in compliance
with California regulation."
Gibbs said Stanford uses lES be
cause its permit serves as a stamp of
approval. To receive a permit, facili
ties must follow the guidelines creat
ed by BAAQMD.
"[BAAQMD] only issues permits
to those within the guidelines and
[those that] aren't over the safety
limit," Gibbs said. "What we look for
is that the facility has been properly
permitted by regulatory authorities.
"As part of the contract, we will
monitor their permitting and make
sure they have the proper permit to
operate under the regulations."
The regulations
BAAQMD mandates that dioxin
emissions remain below levels that
would increase the risk of cancer for
10 in I,(XX),(XX) people with lifetime
exposure.
According to Hill, although lES
violated the regulations, it did not
necessarily exceed the 10-in
-1,(XX),000 limit. To compensate for

excessive emissions on certain days,
lES lost some of its operation time.
For example, when the facility vi
olates the permit by not using some of
its emission-reducing machines, the
toxicity of its emissions increases by a
factor of 30, according to Hill.
"An hour of bypass like this will
cause the company to lose a day's
worth of allowable operation," Hill
said. "But it doesn't mean that the by
pass makes the company exceed this
10-in-1,000,000 limit."
Ishida said she believes this kind of
limit is ludicrous, because it still in
creases the risk of cancer.
"Basically, it's saying if you kill 10
people out of a million, it's OK," Ishi
da said. "But that is wrong, especially
in a poor area."
Treating the problem with an open
mind
BAAQMD has begun research
ing possible alternatives for waste dis
posal. But Hill said currently, the or
ganization does not feel the incinera
tor poses any health risk to the com
munity.
"We use a source test every year to
check the concentration of sub
stances emitted," he said. "If our per
ception of health risks changes, the
permit is written in a way so we can go
into the permit and change it to ac
commodate the new understanding."
BAAQMD has received many
public comments about the issue and
is now replying to all of them. Hill
said BAAQMD plans to send infor
mation packets to the Environmental
Protection Agency in mid-December
so the EPA can decide whether to ap
prove the permit.
