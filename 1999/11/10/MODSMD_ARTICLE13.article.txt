# Stanford defends method of burning medical waste

Despite student protests against
Stanford's dioxin-releasing method
of medical waste disposal, the Uni
versity is defending its use of an Inte
grated Environmental Systems /
Norcal incinerator, saying it is the
most efficient means available.
In Oakland last week, Stanford
students and community organiza
tions gathered at a public hearing to
discuss the new permit that the Bay
Area Air Quality Management Dis
trict may issue to lES.
The permit in contention would
combine all regulatory requirements
into a universal document for the
company, the public and BAAQMD
and would strengthen regulations.
"This permit adds stronger moni
toring and reporting requirements
[to the old permit], as well as oppor
tunities for citizens to sue when the
facility fails to meet regulations," said
Steve Hill, a member of BAAQMD.
"There are no changes in the facili
ty's operating procedures."
Despite stronger regulatory mea
sures. opponents of the permit say
they still feel the guidelines aren't
strict enough.
"The ideal solution would be if
the incinerator stopped completely,
and they switched to microwaving or
autoclaving. methods that wouldn't
release dioxins," said sophomore
Jane lie lshida. "But if not, we want
the monitoring standards to be even
stricter."
'Environmental racism'
Opponents of the permit empha
size the issue of "environmental
racism," since the plant pollutes in a

low-income community of color in
Oakland.
"Imagine the plant in the center of
Palo Alto, or even on campus. No
one would put up with it here," Ishi
da said. "Basically, we're dumping
our waste into a poorer community
and forcing them to deal with it."
According to Ishida, Stanford stu
dents — perhaps with the collabora
tion of Stanford Medical School —
plan to write a proposal detailing
their complaints and proposed solu
tions. However, they say those alter
natives are still fuzzy.
"We're not sure if it's feasible to
ask the hospital to switch to autoclav
ing, or maybe just to reduce the
amount of medical waste," Ishida
said. "We're not sure if it's feasible
for them to start using more non-
TVC plastics [which don't emit diox
ins when incinerated]."
Students have other plans to raise
awareness about the issue on cam
pus. There will be a "teach-in" on
Nov. 17 for people to learn more
about "environmental racism." Ishi
da said she hopes to work directly
with the hospital administration and
to pressure the University with peti
tions or letters next quarter.
Hill said he believes that Ishida's
view on "environmental racism" is
inaccurate. He pointed out the fact
that regulation and review have kept
emission rates below BAAQMD
risk levels.
"Based on the science and proce
dures we currently have, the charac
teristics of risk are insignificant," Hill
said. "Without that impact, the issue
isn't environmental injustice."
