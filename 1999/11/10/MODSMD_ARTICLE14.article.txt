## Congress votes to raise minimum wage by a dollar 
### 
; WASH INC. lON (AP) — With
ij eyes cast to the 2( H K) elections, the
.« Senate voted Tuesday to give mini
« mum-wage workers a dollar raise
'over three years — but tied the
to $18.4 billion in business
•tax sweeteners opposed by the
White House.
President Hill Clinton immediate
ly denounced the measure as a "cyn
ical tool to advance special-interest
' tax breaks" and renewed his promise
to veto it. I le urged Congress instead
'to pass a $1-an-hour increase over
'two years without the large tax cuts.
' Veto threats notwithstanding,
"some Republicans viewed the pack
age as a wav to neutralize a Demo

cratic political advantage on the min
imum wage lor 2(HX) races. Other
Republicans were happy to vote lor
a new round of tux relief, an issue
they want to resurrect following
Clinton's veto in September ot the
GOP s signature $792-billion tax cut.
"This just seemed like the right
combination as far as pulling Repub
licans together." said Sen. Pete
Domenici. R-N.M. ' Sooner or later,
a very significant tax reduction lor
the American people is going to be
achieved."
The vote was 54-44 for the
Republican measure. A few minutes
earlier, the Senate had rejected, 50-
48. a Democratic alternative raising

the minimum wage by $1 over 13
months and providing $ 1 ).6 billion in
tax relief. That measure would have
also raised other taxes.
If the GOP bill becomes law. the
current $5.15-an-hour minimum
wage would rise by 35 cents in March
2(KK). by 35 cents more in March
2001 and 30 cents in March 2002.
About 11 million workers would be
directly affected, half of them
younger workers under age 24 and
many of them holders of part-time
jobs.
The five-year tax package
includes a health insurance deduc
tion for people who don't have
employer-provided coverage and an

immediate 100-percent deduction
for the self-employed. It also would
increase the business meal deduction
from 50 percent to 80 percent and
allow higher 401 (k) contribution lim
its.
Later Tuesday, the I louse Ways
and Means Committee voted along
party lines for a GOP bill also
increasing the wage by $1 over three
years with a tax package totaling
$30.2 billion. A big reason the I louse
tax price tag is bigger is a provision
cutting the estate tax by $16.2 billion
over five years.
It is unlikely, however, that dif
ferences between the two can be
ironed out before next vear. il at .ill.

I he Senate measure was attached
to an unrelated bankruptcy bill that
would also have to be approved.
Hut the political fight was at full
till on both sides of the Capitol.
Senate Democrats sought to por
tray the Republican bill as a tax
giveaway for well-off GOP business
allies that would do little for work
ers who are struggling despite the
booming U.S. economy.
"We are talking about men and
women who are trying to do bet
ter." said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.
D-Mass. "They are being given the
back of their hand by the Republi
cans. Their proposal is a sham."
Hut Republicans said the tax

breaks would help absorb the cost
to businesses of paying a higher
minimum wage that they said could
reduce the number of available low -
wage jobs by as much as 500,000.
"We're talking about tax relief
for small business, not the wealthi
est," said Sen. Rod Grams. R-Minn.
The tax cuts would be paid for
out of projected non-Social Security
surplus dollars in all but the first
year. Clinton has repeatedly said he
will not accept the bill if it uses sur
plus dollars before other priorities
are met. Republicans contend the
president just wants to spend all of
the money on government pro
grams.
