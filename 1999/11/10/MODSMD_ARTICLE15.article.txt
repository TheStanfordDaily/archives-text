A Daily editor
reflects on his time
spent abroad

Perhaps the host experience I've
had at this university was the
one whieh wasn't actually on
this campus. For the first two quarters
last year. I studied abroad at the Stan
ford in Oxford Programme. Certainly
when I graduate in June I'll look back
with a certain fondness on the great
conversations, all-nighters and overall
sense of camaraderie I've experienced
during my four years here. I lowever, I
really think it was my time overseas
that allowed me to mature as a person.
We like to revel in the fact that
Stanford and the Silicon Valley as a
whole are at the forefront of this neb
ulous phenomenon known as "global
ization." However, as much as that is
the case, we should realize that at the
same time both are (not surprisingly)
firmly embedded in the culture of this
nation and the spirit of the West.
It's true that a substantial portion
of the graduate student population is
from overseas. It's also true that many
others have either traveled or had
some sort of experience abroad. 1 low
ever, how much of the undergraduate
student population — which is a dis
proportionately dominant presence in
campus life — is truly international?
Furthermore, can our sometimes
limited overseas experiences really
translate into a broader, more
nuanced understanding of the world?
I. too. fell prey to this line of think
ing. Though I have lived in the United
States for the past 13 years, I thought
that my frequent family trips to Eng
land and mv childhood overseas
would make this study-abroad experi
ence of minimal consequence cultur
ally. So much so that I was initially
reluctant to go to the I IK. and instead
wanted in go somewhere more "exot
ic." I made the mistake of thinking
that actually livinu in another English

speaking country would not he
enough of a cultural shock. I was cer
tainly wrong.
Though Oxford felt culturally
familiar in many ways, I quickly
became used to the fact that things
didn't always operate as "smoothly"
or as "efficiently" as they did in the
U.S. Furthermore, trying to force it to
work otherwise was futile. Things had
been operating that way for a number
of years (in some cases, hundreds) and
the sentiments of a bunch of "know-it
all" college students wasn't going to
change it otherwise.
I just had to sit quietly and maintain
the proverbial "stiff upper lip." So did
the 54 other residents of the Oxford
House, including one of my friends
who quickly learned that in the U.K.,
the customer is not always king. For
the most part, however, my time in
England was filled with a number of
great memories — a list too long and
too complicated to detail here.
Some might think that some of
England's differences translate into
an inferior or less-advanced way of
doing things. And I did at first. How
ever, while I may not have always
liked it, 1 soon came to be under
standing of the way things operate dif
ferently in other parts of the world. In
doing so, I not only learned quite a bit
about Europe itself and English cul
ture but also about the United States
and inevitably my country of origin —
Sri Lanka —a former British colony.
In short, I was able to understand
completely different perspectives
from the one I had heretofore been
exposed to.
By no means am 1 saying that the
six short months I spent studying
abroad made me a true cosmopolite.
Fortunately, this was possible because
Stanford, unlike other schools, actual
ly encoui ;iges you to go overseas. I am
only savini' that it was a eye opening,
mind awakening experience, and I
want more.
