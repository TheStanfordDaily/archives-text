Corey Griffin

Not too long ago the
Daily printed an
editorial that I
thought was just plain
wrong.
I don't know how many of
you read the column on
the sad state of undergrad-

uate advising, but I'm glad if you didn't. As a
Head Advising Associate last year and
Advising Associate this year, I'm not going
to stand by and watch the Undergraduate
Advising Center get attacked without an
accurate portrayal of the state of advising at
Stanford.
You might be asking yourself: "What's
this? Corey isn't attacking someone this
week? He's actually supporting the UAC?"
I don't want you all to think I've gone
soft. I too had a pretty typical freshman
advising experience — the kind that The
Daily and others lament so much. I was for
tunate enough to have a faculty member as
my advisor who had even gone to Stanford
as an undergraduate. My A A was a sopho
more and majoring in something related to
my field of interest.
My advising group met twice during ori
entation and then had one meal per quarter
for the rest of the year. My adviser e-mailed
me my approval code or had his secretary
give it to me. My AA never invited me over
to lunch or dinner at her house. Needless to
say I was a little pissed halfway through the
year, as I felt lost academically.
Did 1 seek out my AA for advice? No.
Did 1 complain bitterly about them to my
HAA? Yes. Did I ask my HAA for help?
Not at first. Did I sit around waiting for
someone to come help me? Yes.
The center of the problem with advising
does not lie at the UAC or even with the
Freshman Advisers (it's Freshman Adviser,
not "faculty" adviser as The Daily so erro

neously printed). The problem does not lie in
the training for AAs: if anything, they are
over-trained.
The problem is with your expectations.
Simply put, you expect too much. You
want to be spoon-fed advice and have your
four-year plan laid out before you like a yel
low brick road. I know this because I wanted
the same things my freshman year. Fortu
nately a friend of mine pointed out that even
if I had been given a yellow brick road, I
wouldn't know where to go as it abruptly
came to an end my senior year.
There are so many myths surrounding the
advising system that I figured it was time
someone dismissed them. So in no particular
order, here are some of the greater false
hoods that Stanford students seem to have:
Myth 1: My FA and A A should be an
exact match to my interests.
Can you say "unrealistic?" Even after all
of Stanford's brainwashing that we are
unique individuals, you still want your AA to
have taken all of the classes that you want to
take and your FA (who runs the lab of your
dreams) to offer you a research position after
your second meeting. Though that's proba
bly a slight exaggeration for most of us, I
think we still wish that our FAs had more in
common with us.
Myth 2: A faculty member makes the best
freshman adviser.
There is something to be said about the
advice you can get from a medical school or
graduate student who has recently been
through Stanford. Even if the person is a staff
member, a committed individual is much
better than a professor who is half-hearted.
Not to say that there aren't some great
faculty members who are advisers. I had the
pleasure of working with them during my
time as HAA. I lowever. do you really want
a faculty member who was coerced into
being an adviser by the UAC and doesn't

have a real interest in helping undergradu
ates over a graduate student or staff member
who does care?
Myth 3: The HA A doesn't do anything.
Ha, ha, ha. As a yell leader wrote me not
so long ago, "don't tell me we're not trying
unless you've been down there with us."
After knowing many HA As and being one
myself, I believe that they are truly the
unsung heroes of the house staff.
They put in many hours behind the
scenes coordinating your academic advising
by e-mailing FAs, running meetings with
A As, contacting speakers and meeting regu
larly with the other HAAs and the UAC.
That's on top of the hours they spend in staff
meetings, house meetings, hanging out in
the halls and talking with you about your
four-year plan. Not only are many treated as
second-class staff members by some Resi
dent Fellows and Resident Assistants; they
get paid one-third of what the RAs get paid
and half of what the Residential Computer
Coordinators are paid for doing just as much
work.
1 have one piece of advice to The Daily
and everyone else out there: stop complain
ing and start fixing.
The world outside the Stanford bubble is
never going to spoon-feed you. You and you
alone must seek out a relationship with a fac
ulty member if you want one. If you think
something is wrong with the advising system,
do what you can to fix it. Be the AA you
never had.
In the end, my time as a peer advisor to
freshmen will do more good than any of
these columns ever will.

and everyone else out there: stop complain
ing and start fixing.
The world outside the Stanford bubble is
never going to spoon-feed you. You and you
alone must seek out a relationship with a fac
ulty member if you want one. If you think
something is wrong with the advising system,
do what you can to fix it. Be the AA you
never had.
In the end, my time as a peer advisor to
freshmen will do more good than any of
these columns ever will.
