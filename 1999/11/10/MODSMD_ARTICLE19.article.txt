No bias in drape Educa
tion and Voting Program
I want lo set the record straight regard
ing (iary Caloroso's allegations about my
organization of the Grape Education and
Voting program.
My position toward the United Farm
Workers (I I W) is exactly the same as the
one th.it the Cirape Workers and Farmers
( oalition ((i\V tV F(') holds. I support the
I 'nited Farm Workers. Mr. Caloroso has
consistently stated they are not against the
United F'arm Workets. They only oppose
the grape boycott.
I continue to present a balanced per
spective on the grape boycott despite fac
ing criticism from UFW supporters at
Stanford for ensuring the Grape Workers
and Farmers Coalition perspective is rep
resented. Contrary to Mr. Caloroso's falla
cious claims of any bias on my part, I have
been his organization's best ally on cam
pus.
A check of my phone log will indicate
that I have overwhelmingly spent more
time informing Mr. Caloroso about our
activities than I have with the UFW. I also
took the initiative to develop a Web page
for his organization at Stanford's expense
after Mr. Caloroso refused to provide a
Web page with direct access to the CiW &
FC positions.
I have not "demanded"' that his farm
workers appear at the upcoming "Grapes
Stakes" Dialogue Forum next Wednesday
evening at Kresgc. It was Mr. Caloroso
who lobbied me to invite his farm workers
to speak at Stanford. Me has insisted they

are the most effective spokespeople. I
have asked him to invite sympathetic
retailers, farm growers, pesticide experts
and scholars in addition to speaking him
self.
While it may be a hardship for Mr.
Caloroso's organization to invite farm
workers to this event, the UFW faces the
same problem. The truth is we have been
late in offering funding for travel and lodg
ing for either side because it has been dif
ficult to secure agreements from both
sides to appear at our forum.
Mr. Caloroso demonstrates that Stan
ford University deserves to have an
update on the current situation on the
grape boycott. It has been four years since
the last forum at Stanford, and much has
changed. If this community must vote each
year, we deserve to vote in an informed
way. We cannot do it without help from
the stakeholders themselves. While I'm
glad he appreciates the balanced resources
we have developed to educate students,
we cannot go further without his organiza
tion's assistance.
It is my responsibility to implement a
Grape Education and Voting program
annually. Regardless of the allegations of
bias I will continue to work to provide a
balanced educational program, as my col
league, Prof. Luis Fraga, did in the past.
In short, I am not biased or cruel to any
organization or farm workers. Stanford
University would be happy to fund their
visit if they would only accept our invita
tion.

Grapes issue needn 7 be so
polarized
Regarding the debate about grapes on
campus, the polarization into the two
camps of "boycott" and "buy" seems to
miss some important points.
As described by the debate at White
Plaza, the anti-boycott camp emphasizes
that the workers do not want a grape boy
cott. A boycott in effect would create less
work for the migrant workers. The pro
boycott camp emphasizes that the pesti
cides used upon the grapes are carcino
genic and that the number of carcinogenic
pesticides used on the crops have
increased.
The relevant issue here is the use of
pesticides, which are proven to be detri
mental to the workers' health. The anti
boycott camp should understand the
financial consequence of a population of
migrant workers and grape consumers
with cancer as potentially more costly than
decreased grape sales. The pro-boycott
camp should understand that carcinogenic
pesticides are of no concern to a worker
whose other option is destitute poverty
and hunger.
The solution is to find non-toxic pesti
cides or ban their use altogether in favor
of biologicals such as lady bird beetles or
bacteria that target larvae of pests.
Although crop yield may be less, organic
crops are growing in popularity and often
equal or surpass conventional crops in
quality.

Any suggestions that the migrant work
ers should change jobs should be backed
with a strategy to relocate them to anoth
er job or to train them with the new skills
they need. Any suggestions that the work
ers should continue working under the
same conditions should be backed with a
strategy to prevent their getting cancer.
The compromise to be made here is to
change the condition that is harmful to the
workers so that they can keep their jobs
and consumers can enjoy grapes without
guilt.

Acceptable Land Use Plan
to all parties can be reached
I was concerned by the tone of the news
articles that appeared in Monday's Daily
regarding Stanford's Draft Community
Plan and General Use Permit Application.
I would like to take this opportunity to
present a perspective that, in my opinion,
both articles lacked.

share a common goal â€” preserving what is
special about this University. This means
addressing quality of life issues for stu

We need more on-campus graduate
