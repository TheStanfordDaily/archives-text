## Odd couple leads soccer squad Inbody, Davis bring different styles but same leadership 
### Meghan O'Connor Staff writer 
Luckily for the Stanford men's
soccer team, opposites attract.
One's a vocal leader, the other a
quiet role model, but together red
shirt senior midfielder T.K. Inbody
and senior defender Gerard Davis
make for not only a dynamic duo
down the right side of the soccer
tield but also a positive influence as
captains of this year's squad.
"Last year the senior class had a
lot of strong personalities, it was
like having four captains." junior
midfielder Scott Leber said. "After
the graduating class left, we needed
people to fill those roles and (In
body and Davis] have stepped up
brillantlv."
From opposite sides of the globe
(Davis out of Auckland. New
Zealand, and Inbody from Del
Mar, Calif.) the pair brings not only
different backgrounds and experi
ences to the team but different per

sonalities as well. And their team
has only good things to sa\ about
the combination.
"The senior class always has a
tremendous effect on any team.
They've got to be leaders," head
coach Bobby Clark said. "Gerard is
quiet and leads by example, where
as T.K. wears his emotions on his
sleeve. It's a good thing for any
team to have a mix of such different
emotions."
"They're role models for the
younger guys," sophomore mid
fielder Derek Shanahan said.
" They're extremely mature and ac
complished players. We learn a lot
from them. They know the system
well enough to not make mistakes
because they have worked hard to
perfect their game and every day
they work harder."
The captains have had the last
three years to perfect their game
together, but before ever sporting
the Cardinal jersey both players
boasted impressive soccer back

grounds.
Davis grew up playing soccer in
New Zealand and joined the
Under-20 National Squad in IWS
where he met Clark, then head
coach of the Kiwi National Team.
It was Clark who urged Davis to
play in America, and when he ac
cepted the coaching position at
Stanford in I S)%. he pushed for
Davis to leave the University of
Auckland in favor of Stanford.
"I wanted to go overseas to play,
but 1 also wanted to go to a univer
sity," Davis said. "The U.S. was a
good option because it's the only
place where you can do both at a
high level. I didn't know a lot about
Stanford, so I went a lot on what
Bobby relayed to me."

cam to two California Inter
cholastic Federation (CIF) Div. II
hampionship titles and collected
,uch honors as CIF Div. II Player of
ilie Year (1993) and Avocado
eague Player of the Year (1993,
>4). In body also played for the No
uids. a competitive club team that
i i.idc ii to the National finals in his
I nal year.
When Inhody came to Stanford
i 1995, lie could never have imag
•led that the Cardinal squad, which
inished 5-12-1. would be the Na
tional Finalists only three years
later.
"I basically came to Stanford for
ihe school," Inbody said. "It was a
pleasant surprise when Hobby
( lark came. I le totally changed the

mentality of the team. He made us
much more disciplined and focused
on doing well. It has been a much
better experience playing lor a
team with the chance of winning
the national championship."
Both Inbody and Davis played
major roles in the Cardinal's trans
formation from a team that won IK
games combined from 1993-1995,
to a team that posted 1 K wins in the
1998 season alone.
"It's because of players like him
that the team and program has
grown so much in the last few
years." Davis said ol Inbody, the
only player left from the 1 995
squad. "And it's a credit to Bobby
for having taken the program and
pushed it to a higher level. Now we
are starting to get the benefits."
As Davis and Inbody watched
the team grow in strength and suc
cess. Stanford watched them i>row

as players.
Eighty games into his career at
Stanford, Davis has contributed 15
points to the Cardinal effort. Most
notably, he netted the game-winner
this season against California and
assisted on the overtime game-win
ners against Santa Clara this season
and against San Jose State last sea
son in the first round of the NCAA
tournament.
As a defender, his contribution
offensively has been one of the
most impressive features of his
game.
"He's one ol our best attackers,
but he's in a defensive role." Leber
said. "I le adds a new element as a
defender who can come up as an at
tacker on the wing."
"He's a very gifted player with a
good soccer brain," Clark said. "He
makes good decisions with the ball
and has the technical ability to

carry them out. He doesn't realize
how good he is. Once he realizes it,
he could become even better."
A versatile player who has
played both midfield and defense
for the Cardinal, Davis has settled
into right back behind Inbody, the
right outside midfielder, forcing
opponents to think twice before at
tacking the "lethal right side" de
scribed by Leber.
"It's been great to play with him
on the right side," Davis said, "we
have a good understanding of each
other. He's a really good player,
but he doesn't get enough recogni
tion.
"He's a good leader and has a
high work rate; he's always very in
tense and focused."
Like Davis, Inbody has also
posted 15 points in his career. In
body made an immediate impact
on the team, playing in 14 games his

freshman year. After playing in two
games the following year and
notching his first collegiate goal, a
torn meniscus in each knee forced
him to redshirt.
"As it turns out, the program has
grown so much that playing this
year is much more valuable than
trying to play [in 1996] would have
been." Inbody said.
Indeed. Inbody has been a valu
able asset to the team this season,
starting every game and posting
four points.
"T.K. has tremendous aerobic
capacity, he's a good athlete. He
has a great ability to play the ball
quickly and he hits great crosses."
Clark said. "He's the David Beck
ham of our team," he added, refer
ring to the skilled crosses of the
Manchester [England] United's
star outside midfielder.
"T.K.'s an overall leader, he

takes over the games." Leber said.
"He's grown with time on the field
and has gotten consistently better
doing the same things, but with
more confidence."
Now that the regular season is
over, the captains look with antici
pation toward the upcoming
NCAA tournament, and while
tournament play will mark their
last games for Stanford, it may not
be the end for long.
In December, Davis joins fellow
Cardinal, junior Ryan Nelsen. on
the Under-23 New Zealand Na
tional Team, where the team will
plav in the Olympic qualifiers.
Inbody has not totally ruled out
continuing his soccer career, but
will probably be taking the lessons
of dedication, time management
and relationship that he's learned
on the field and applying them in an
investment banking career.

quiet role model, but together red
shirt senior midfielder T.K. Inbody
and senior defender Gerard Davis
make for not only a dynamic duo
down the right side of the soccer
tield but also a positive influence as
captains of this year's squad.
"Last year the senior class had a
lot of strong personalities, it was
like having four captains." junior
midfielder Scott Leber said. "After
the graduating class left, we needed
people to fill those roles and (In
body and Davis] have stepped up
brillantlv."
From opposite sides of the globe
(Davis out of Auckland. New
Zealand, and Inbody from Del
Mar, Calif.) the pair brings not only
different backgrounds and experi
ences to the team but different per

sonalities as well. And their team
has only good things to sa\ about
the combination.
"The senior class always has a
tremendous effect on any team.
They've got to be leaders," head
coach Bobby Clark said. "Gerard is
quiet and leads by example, where
as T.K. wears his emotions on his
sleeve. It's a good thing for any
team to have a mix of such different
emotions."
"They're role models for the
younger guys," sophomore mid
fielder Derek Shanahan said.
" They're extremely mature and ac
complished players. We learn a lot
from them. They know the system
well enough to not make mistakes
because they have worked hard to
perfect their game and every day
they work harder."
The captains have had the last
three years to perfect their game
together, but before ever sporting
the Cardinal jersey both players

grounds.
Davis grew up playing soccer in
New Zealand and joined the
Under-20 National Squad in IWS
where he met Clark, then head
coach of the Kiwi National Team.
It was Clark who urged Davis to
play in America, and when he ac
cepted the coaching position at
Stanford in I S)%. he pushed for
Davis to leave the University of
Auckland in favor of Stanford.
"I wanted to go overseas to play,
but 1 also wanted to go to a univer
sity," Davis said. "The U.S. was a
good option because it's the only
place where you can do both at a
high level. I didn't know a lot about
Stanford, so I went a lot on what
Bobby relayed to me."

cam to two California Inter
cholastic Federation (CIF) Div. II
hampionship titles and collected
,uch honors as CIF Div. II Player of
ilie Year (1993) and Avocado
eague Player of the Year (1993,
>4). In body also played for the No
uids. a competitive club team that
i i.idc ii to the National finals in his
I nal year.
When Inhody came to Stanford
i 1995, lie could never have imag
•led that the Cardinal squad, which
inished 5-12-1. would be the Na
tional Finalists only three years
later.
"I basically came to Stanford for
ihe school," Inbody said. "It was a
pleasant surprise when Hobby
( lark came. I le totally changed the

mentality of the team. He made us
much more disciplined and focused
on doing well. It has been a much
better experience playing lor a
team with the chance of winning
the national championship."
Both Inbody and Davis played
major roles in the Cardinal's trans
formation from a team that won IK
games combined from 1993-1995,
to a team that posted 1 K wins in the
1998 season alone.
"It's because of players like him
that the team and program has
grown so much in the last few
years." Davis said ol Inbody, the
only player left from the 1 995
squad. "And it's a credit to Bobby
for having taken the program and
pushed it to a higher level. Now we
are starting to get the benefits."
As Davis and Inbody watched
the team grow in strength and suc
cess. Stanford watched them i>row

as players.
Eighty games into his career at
Stanford, Davis has contributed 15
points to the Cardinal effort. Most
notably, he netted the game-winner
this season against California and
assisted on the overtime game-win
ners against Santa Clara this season
and against San Jose State last sea
son in the first round of the NCAA
tournament.
As a defender, his contribution
offensively has been one of the
most impressive features of his
game.
"He's one ol our best attackers,
but he's in a defensive role." Leber
said. "I le adds a new element as a
defender who can come up as an at
tacker on the wing."
"He's a very gifted player with a
good soccer brain," Clark said. "He
makes good decisions with the ball
and has the technical ability to

carry them out. He doesn't realize
how good he is. Once he realizes it,
he could become even better."
A versatile player who has
played both midfield and defense
for the Cardinal, Davis has settled
into right back behind Inbody, the
right outside midfielder, forcing
opponents to think twice before at
tacking the "lethal right side" de
scribed by Leber.
"It's been great to play with him
on the right side," Davis said, "we
have a good understanding of each
other. He's a really good player,
but he doesn't get enough recogni
tion.
"He's a good leader and has a
high work rate; he's always very in
tense and focused."
Like Davis, Inbody has also
posted 15 points in his career. In
body made an immediate impact
on the team, playing in 14 games his

freshman year. After playing in two
games the following year and
notching his first collegiate goal, a
torn meniscus in each knee forced
him to redshirt.
"As it turns out, the program has
grown so much that playing this
year is much more valuable than
trying to play [in 1996] would have
been." Inbody said.
Indeed. Inbody has been a valu
able asset to the team this season,
starting every game and posting
four points.
"T.K. has tremendous aerobic
capacity, he's a good athlete. He
has a great ability to play the ball
quickly and he hits great crosses."
Clark said. "He's the David Beck
ham of our team," he added, refer
ring to the skilled crosses of the
Manchester [England] United's
star outside midfielder.
"T.K.'s an overall leader, he

takes over the games." Leber said.
"He's grown with time on the field
and has gotten consistently better
doing the same things, but with
more confidence."
Now that the regular season is
over, the captains look with antici
pation toward the upcoming
NCAA tournament, and while
tournament play will mark their
last games for Stanford, it may not
be the end for long.
In December, Davis joins fellow
Cardinal, junior Ryan Nelsen. on
the Under-23 New Zealand Na
tional Team, where the team will
plav in the Olympic qualifiers.
Inbody has not totally ruled out
continuing his soccer career, but
will probably be taking the lessons
of dedication, time management
and relationship that he's learned
on the field and applying them in an
investment banking career.
Luckily for the Stanford men's
soccer team, opposites attract.
