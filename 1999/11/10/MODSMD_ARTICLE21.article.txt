## Odd couple leads soccer squad Inbody, Davis bring different styles but same leadership 
### Meghan O'Connor Staff writer 
Luckily for the Stanford men's
soccer team, opposites attract.
One's a vocal leader, the other a
quiet role model, but together red
shirt senior midfielder T.K. Inbody
and senior defender Gerard Davis
make for not only a dynamic duo
down the right side of the soccer
tield but also a positive influence as
captains of this year's squad.
"Last year the senior class had a
lot of strong personalities, it was
like having four captains." junior
midfielder Scott Leber said. "After
the graduating class left, we needed
people to fill those roles and (In
body and Davis] have stepped up
brillantlv."
From opposite sides of the globe
(Davis out of Auckland. New
Zealand, and Inbody from Del
Mar, Calif.) the pair brings not only
different backgrounds and experi
ences to the team but different per

sonalities as well. And their team
has only good things to sa\ about
the combination.
"The senior class always has a
tremendous effect on any team.
They've got to be leaders," head
coach Bobby Clark said. "Gerard is
quiet and leads by example, where
as T.K. wears his emotions on his
sleeve. It's a good thing for any
team to have a mix of such different
emotions."
"They're role models for the
younger guys," sophomore mid
fielder Derek Shanahan said.
" They're extremely mature and ac
complished players. We learn a lot
from them. They know the system
well enough to not make mistakes
because they have worked hard to
perfect their game and every day
they work harder."
The captains have had the last
three years to perfect their game
together, but before ever sporting
the Cardinal jersey both players
boasted impressive soccer back

grounds.
Davis grew up playing soccer in
New Zealand and joined the
Under-20 National Squad in IWS
where he met Clark, then head
coach of the Kiwi National Team.
It was Clark who urged Davis to
play in America, and when he ac
cepted the coaching position at
Stanford in I S)%. he pushed for
Davis to leave the University of
Auckland in favor of Stanford.
"I wanted to go overseas to play,
but 1 also wanted to go to a univer
sity," Davis said. "The U.S. was a
good option because it's the only
place where you can do both at a
high level. I didn't know a lot about
Stanford, so I went a lot on what
Bobby relayed to me."
Half a world away. Inbody was
playing for Torrey Pines High
School in Del Mar with Cardinal
senior defender Andy I lemmerieh.

For senior soccer players T.K. Inbody and Gerard Davis, having different personal styles has been one
of the duo's greatest assets as team captains.
