Technically, the team has to place either first or sec

Because the Western Region is so competitive, it is
possible that four or l iveol the teams that race Saturday
at Blue Lake Park will head to Bloomington. The first
and second-place teams will advance automatically.
But more teams could advance thanks to several at

ence Championships. The Cardinal
took those with ease, beating sec
ond-place Arizona State by 30
points despite having junior stand
out Julia Stamps dropout of the race
due to heat exhaustion.
" I ran a dumb race," Stamps said.
" The course was extremely deceiv
ing. I assumed flat meant fast, but it
was uneven terrain and sandy."
Stamps is expected to bounce
back along with freshman Mariel
Ettinger, who missed the Pac-IO
meet due to emergency surgery on
her appendix. Hut regardless of
whether Ettinger or Stamps run, the
Cardinal are still heavy favorites to
take the regional championship.
"I think Julia is an incredibly im
portant part of our team, hut we
proved at Pac-IDs and we proved at
Pre-Nationals when she didn't race
with us that we are a solid team and
we go very deep," said sophomore
Laura Turner, Stanford's tilth
across the line at Pae-lOs. "No one
person is carrying the load on their
shoulders. We are all sharing it."
Head coach Vin Tananna feels
his team still has room for improve
ment. but doesn't think a major
scare is likely.
"I think that [assistant coach
Dina Evans| has done a very nice
job in getting the women prepared,"
Tananna said. "We feel like we have
a good team and we need to run the
way we've been running. I .ike I've
been saying all season long, our goal
is to have 12 women step up and par
ticipate when called upon."
While the final lineup was not de
cided by press lime. Stamps, Sulli

possibilities, as are senior Sally
