MEN'S CROSS COUNTRY
■ Saturday: No. 5 Stanford at the
Western Regional Qualifier Race in
Portland. ()re.

But this is the re;il ileal.
The Stanford men will faee oil

against all of the Pacific 10C onfei -
enee and will be joined by the Big
West Conference in the regional
meet, l or once this season, the
Cardinal is the supposed under
dog.
After last week's second-place
showinii behind Arizona at Pac
10s. the Cardinal dropped to No. 5
while the Wildeats rose to No. 4 in
the nation. The teams are expected
to finish first and second in a race
that sends the top two teams to the
Nov. 22 NCAA championship
meet.
A total of 13 other teams from
nine regions will a Ist) be selected as
at-large contenders in the NCAA
field.
Eleventh-ranked Oregon and
No. 15 Arizona State are expected
contend for the at-large bids, while
the Big West sends Cal Poly - San
Luis Obispo as its top contender.
Though this will be Stanford's
first race of the season at the
NCAA distance of 10 kilometers,
head coach Vin Lananna says that
the team has not changed its ap
proach.
"We've gone back to our ba
sics." Lananna said. "We've been
training for 10.000 meters all year,
so that will serve us well.

"I'm not a real big believer that
there's much of a difference be
tween <SK and 10K in cross country.
We've been racing our BKs the
same way that we would race a
10K." he said.
Lananna plans to do a little
shuffling of the lineups this week
end. though his starting seven are
yet to be selected.
Lananna will choose from a
pool that includes senior Jake
Maas, juniors Thomas Murley and
Jonathon Riley, sophomores
Jamey Clifford and Gabe Jennings
and freshmen Joe Urbanski, Jesse
Thomas. Adam Tenforde and Seth
Hejny.
"I think we will have some flexi
bility with the lineup in terms of
resting people we feel that we need
to rest." Lananna said. "I don't
think that the team we have has
been over-raced — they can cer
tainly handle back-to-back week
ends."
"As a result, you'll see a pretty
similar lineup this weekend as you
will at the NCAAs."
Urbanski and Thomas are al

most sure to race Saturday, while
Tenforde will likely sit after his col
lapse at the Pac-10 meet, which
kept him from finishing the race.
"Tenforde is doing well, better
than expected," Lananna said. "I
was surprised, because I thought
there would be some lingering ef
fects. [from the collapse]. He's
bounced right back, but we've
taken it a little more conservatively
with him."
Weather could also be a factor
in the race, as Blue Lake Park sits
on the banks of the Columbia
River. Lananna is preparing his
troops for cold, wet and windy con
ditions.
Ultimately, however, the Cardi
nal must focus only on what it can
control. For Stanford, that means
racing as a pack.
"The objective is for us not to
look beyond this meet," Lananna
said. "Our goal is still the same as it
has been, and that is to tighten our
gap
"For us to have a good showing
at the NCAAs, we need to tighten
our gap."
