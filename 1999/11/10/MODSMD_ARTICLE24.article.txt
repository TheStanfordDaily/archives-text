/ Palmetto Dunes Invitational.

All-American junior I lilarv 1 lomeyer led the Car
dinal. finishing sixth with rounds of 75, 71 and 73 on
the par-72 Arthur Hills-designed golf course.
Despite this bright spot, the first two days of the
tournament were lackluster for the Cardinal. Stan
ford came into the final day tied for ninth with daily
scores of 30fi and 308. The team teed off Sunday with
the goal of posting a sub 300 score — a feat that had
eluded the team thus far in the tournament.
I he Cardinal rallied for an impressive 295 on the
final day. carding individual scores of 72, 73 and a
pair of 75s to overtake (leorgia and Tulsa in the tour
nament standings.
Junior Stephanie Keever's final-round 72 cata
pulted her into 16th place individually.
I rcshman Kim Rowton finished her fall season
with yet another impressive score, carding a final
round 75.
•' I he first two rounds were disappointing, but I'm
happy with how we finished. We left on a good note,"
said junior I aurcn Robertson, who posted a 75 on
Sunday.
This three-day event brought together some of the
finest competition in the country, including the No. 1
Duke Blue Devils and fellow Pacific 10 Conference
competitors Arizona. Arizona State and USC. along
with eiuht other teams.
Arizona's score of 287 on Sun
day allowed the team to overtake
Duke, Saturday's leader, and claim
the trophy. Arizona finished one
stroke ahead of the Blue Devils,
carding a total of 875. Arizona State
finished third with an 888, well back
from the two front-runners. The
teams were followed by USC (890).
Louisiana State (892), Texas (903)
and Stanford (909).
Arizona's Jenna Daniels led the
Wildcats to victory with a three-day
total of 209. including a five-under
par (i7 on the final day. Daniels won
the tournament in a playoff with
Duke star Beth Bauer.
The Cardinal will rest from the
strenuous schedule of competition
until the team's season resumes in
February.
During the off-season the team
plans to concentrate on the techni

cal aspects of its games that the
team is unable to address during
the season.
When asked about the team's
future prospects, senior golfer Jae
Jean Ro said. "I'm really excited,
we're a team with a lot of poten
tial."
Overall, the team feels that it
could have performed better this
fall, especially concerning the its
eighth-place finish at the Stanford
Invitational. Nonetheless, the Car
dinal is relieved to have finished as
well as it did.
"We had a big challenge in front
of us with only five players," said
sophomore Lauren Robertson.
The Cardinal was limited by two
redshirt members, one golfer over
seas, and one in fall soccer. The
team has handled this limitation
well in the four tournaments in
which it competed. In the spring, a
deeper team will further prepare
the Cardinal to defend its Pacific 10
Conference Championship.
