# Sophomores anchor volleyball team
## '98 recruiting class a tight-knit group on court and off 
### Ellie Ritch Contributing writer 
Despite the fact thai Ihev share
at least 20 hours of practice time a
week, plus additional game time,
the five sophomores on the Stan
ford women's volleyball team don't
seem to mind each other's compa
ny.
The 1998 recruiting class ac :
counts for the majority of players
on the No. 2 Stanford women's vol
leyball team and over 27 years of
volleyball experience. I his core
group of live girls serves as the
backbone of the 13-mcmber Cardi
nal squad.
Last year's recruits proved that
they have quite an impact this
weekend, as they helped guide the
Cardinal to a huge Pacific 10 Con
ference win over No. 7 U( LA. I his
successful outing moved Stanford
just a half-game behind UCI A in
the race for the Pac-I() crown.
Lindscy Yamasaki tallied 10
kills and 10 digs in Friday night's
game.Tara Conrad put down S kills

off a .500 hitting percentage, while
racking up lour service aces and
four blocks. bmil\ Lawrence saw
quite a bit of time in her role as a
defensive specialist and Sara San
drik served her role as middle
blocker in all four games, con
tributing lliree iligs and four
blocks.
Perhaps il is odd that they do get
along so well. As junior co-captain
Lindsay kagawa explained. "We
did a personality test out of a mag
azine for our whole team, including
the coaches, and I think we filled 13
of the 14 given personality types."
What drew each ol these players
to the hard-hitting, floor-burn
filled, timing-intense sport varies
almost as much as theii personali
ties.
For otitside hitter Michelle
Chambers, her first experience
holding a volleyball occurred in the
eighth grade.
"My best friend and I both
played basketball." she said, "and I
can remember her coming up to me
and asking me to trv out for. 'n

sport called volleyball." I obviously
liked it."
( onrad picked up volleyball as a
third part t<> her athletic triumvi
rate, which also included soccer
and softball. Ai first, volleyball
simply acted as a time-filler for her
offseason.
Sandrik also started her volley
ball career in the eighth tirade. I lie
high school volleyball coaches had
come to watch a junior high basket
ball game and spotted the tall and
athletic Sandrik as a prime candi
date for a middle blocker position.
It is a good thing they chose to
pluck her oil the basketball court
that day. because as Sandrik said.
"It just ended up clicking."
Sandrik lives with fellow middle
blocker C onrad and Chambers.
I hey consciously made a decision
before the year began that their
home would not just be an exten
sion of the court — that it would be
entirely free of volleyball-related
conversation.
"It's worked out really well this
far. We have manv common inter

ests outside of volleyball." Conrad
said.
Since joining the Stanford
squad. Conrad and Sandrik have
spent quite a bit of time working tin
their blocking.
"It's not like it was in high
school anymore." Sandrik said.
"Our opponents are taller and
more receptive at hitting and set
ting. insuring that we close all of
(hit blocks and have the right hand
position allows our defense to run
correctly.
Conrad and Sandrik stepped up
earlier this season when a fellow
middle blocker, junior Jenn Det
mer. was out with torn stomach
muscles. Conrad was quite pleased
with how they were able to meet
the challenge.
"It was exciting for us to play
middle blocker together. It was a
little glimpse of what's to come,"
Conrad explained.
Chambers has had somewhat of
an odd vear thus far. Last year she
led the team with 25 serviee aees
and held a spot in the starting line
up throughout conference play.
She had been expected to contend
for a starting position this year
after earning Pacific 10 Confer
ence All-Freshman honors in the
IWN season, hut these plans have
since taken an alternate path.,
Nagging shoulder pains became
unbearable for Chambers last
spring, and she has yet to play in a
match this year. Chambers came
out of a complex but successful
shoulder surgery Thursday.

'We did a personality test out of a magazine
for our whole team, including the coaches,
and I think we filled 13 of the 14 given
personality types.'
— Junior co-captain Lindsay Kagawa

What the doctors had thought
to he a torn ligament turned out to
be densely-packed cartilage that
they were able to smooth out. I ler
shoulder joint was too loose, and to
prevent further problems, the sur
geons heat-shrunk her shoulder
capsule. By eliminating the possi
bility of the injury reoccurring,
doctors assured that Chambers will
be a force to reckon with next year.
The fact that the injury came be
fore the season started was actually a
blessing in disguise for ('hambers. as
she was able to redshirt this season
and retain her ability to play for a
fifth year. Who wouldn't want to see
( hambers, Yamasaki, and freshmen
Ashley Ivy and Logan Tom still out
on the floor together in 2(M)2?
Yamasaki, who is also on the
women's basketball team, was re
cruited with the 1998 class, but
chose to redshirt her freshman
year. I ast year she led the basket
ball team in scoring (14.0 points
per game) and rebounds (5.9 re-

hounds per game).
Yamasaki was named Ail-
American and Oregon State Play
er of the Year in both volleyball
and basketball her senior year in
high school. This year, Yamasaki
has taken time off from preseason
basketball practice in order to con
centrate on her volleyball skills.
She has indeed proven that she still
can do it all. as she finished off Sat
urday's match against USC with
eight kills and a .500 hitting per
centage.
Lawrence can be seen as the
hidden gem of the sophomore
class. She was not recruited by
Stanford, but chose to prove her
self to both her coaches and her

teammates as a walk-on.
And prove herself she did.
Lawrence not only made the team
but also played in 43 regular-sea
son games, as well as in NC'AA
tournament competition.
This year, Lawrence was wel
comed back to the team with a
scholarship and now serves the
vital role of defensive specialist for
the squad. Lawrence has filled the
shoes of defensive specialist Sara
Neal who graduated this spring.
The 1998 recruiting class is an
exciting group to watch. They are
an added dimension to the team in
that they are still growing and ex
panding their game tactics and im
proving in match consistency. Re
turning to the program as sopho
mores has made them more com
fortable with changes in coaching
style and teammates.
These five women have their
eyes set on the Final Four not only
for the 1999 competition, but also
for manv vcars to come.
