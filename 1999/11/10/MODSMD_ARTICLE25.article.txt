# Sophomores anchor volleyball team
## '98 recruiting class a tight-knit group on court and off 
### Ellie Ritch Contributing writer 
Despite the fact thai Ihev share
at least 20 hours of practice time a
week, plus additional game time,
the five sophomores on the Stan
ford women's volleyball team don't
seem to mind each other's compa
ny.
The 1998 recruiting class ac :
counts for the majority of players
on the No. 2 Stanford women's vol
leyball team and over 27 years of
volleyball experience. I his core
group of live girls serves as the
backbone of the 13-mcmber Cardi
nal squad.
Last year's recruits proved that
they have quite an impact this
weekend, as they helped guide the
Cardinal to a huge Pacific 10 Con
ference win over No. 7 U( LA. I his
successful outing moved Stanford
just a half-game behind UCI A in
the race for the Pac-I() crown.
Lindscy Yamasaki tallied 10
kills and 10 digs in Friday night's
game.Tara Conrad put down S kills

off a .500 hitting percentage, while
racking up lour service aces and
four blocks. bmil\ Lawrence saw
quite a bit of time in her role as a
defensive specialist and Sara San
drik served her role as middle
blocker in all four games, con
tributing lliree iligs and four
blocks.
Perhaps il is odd that they do get
along so well. As junior co-captain
Lindsay kagawa explained. "We
did a personality test out of a mag
azine for our whole team, including
the coaches, and I think we filled 13
of the 14 given personality types."
What drew each ol these players
to the hard-hitting, floor-burn
filled, timing-intense sport varies
almost as much as theii personali
ties.
For otitside hitter Michelle
Chambers, her first experience
holding a volleyball occurred in the
eighth grade.
"My best friend and I both
played basketball." she said, "and I
can remember her coming up to me
and asking me to trv out for. 'n

sport called volleyball." I obviously
liked it."
( onrad picked up volleyball as a
third part t<> her athletic triumvi
rate, which also included soccer
and softball. Ai first, volleyball
simply acted as a time-filler for her
offseason.
Sandrik also started her volley
ball career in the eighth tirade. I lie
high school volleyball coaches had
come to watch a junior high basket
ball game and spotted the tall and
athletic Sandrik as a prime candi
date for a middle blocker position.
It is a good thing they chose to
pluck her oil the basketball court
that day. because as Sandrik said.
"It just ended up clicking."
Sandrik lives with fellow middle
blocker C onrad and Chambers.
I hey consciously made a decision
before the year began that their
home would not just be an exten
sion of the court â€” that it would be
entirely free of volleyball-related
conversation.
"It's worked out really well this
far. We have manv common inter

ests outside of volleyball." Conrad
said.
Since joining the Stanford
squad. Conrad and Sandrik have
spent quite a bit of time working tin
their blocking.
"It's not like it was in high
school anymore." Sandrik said.
"Our opponents are taller and
more receptive at hitting and set
ting. insuring that we close all of
(hit blocks and have the right hand
position allows our defense to run
correctly.
Conrad and Sandrik stepped up
earlier this season when a fellow
middle blocker, junior Jenn Det
mer. was out with torn stomach
muscles. Conrad was quite pleased
with how they were able to meet
the challenge.
"It was exciting for us to play
middle blocker together. It was a
little glimpse of what's to come,"
Conrad explained.
Chambers has had somewhat of
an odd vear thus far. Last year she
