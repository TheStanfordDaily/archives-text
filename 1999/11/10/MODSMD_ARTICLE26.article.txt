## Special edition: Sleep and Dreams How sleep can affect you 
### Jane Morril Contributing writer 
Sleep deprivation is a major prob
lem among Stanford students. The
vast majority of students suffer some
amount of sleep debt. We asked Dr.
C'lete Kushida, director of the Stan
ford Center for Human Sleep
Research, about sleep deprivation
and how it affects students.
What is the most common sleep prob
lem among students?
According to Kushida, the prob
lem faced most often by students is
sleep debt. Students must balance
their time between course work,
extracurricular activities and social
activities.
Sleep, then, is often viewed as the
most dispensable activity and is
therefore sacrificed in favor of other,
more essential pastimes.
In addition, college students tend
to have a natural tendency to stay up
late at night and sleep later into the
morning as compared to older indi
viduals. Sleeping late, however, is
often impossible because of early
morning classes.
How will an all-nighter affect perfor
mance, academic or otherwise?
Studies have shown that reducing
the normal night's sleep of a young
adult by only an hour and a half can
lead to declined performance of up
to one-third the following day.
According to Kushida. Stanford
students who were sleep deprived
for 36 hours in a laboratory had sig
nificant decrements in tasks of vigi
lance. attention and cognitive perfor

mance as compared to normal levels.
Given that students will not be able to
maintain a constant bedtime or get
enough sleep, what are some ways
they can maintain a healthy fleep pat
tern?
According to Kushida, if the stu
dent is naturally a "night owl" who
tends to sleep late, and it is impossi
ble to avoid morning classes, a half
hour exposure to bright light starting
within five minutes of awakening will
help the individual to synchronize his
or her internal clock to this early
morning schedule.
If the student is consistently
unable to obtain enough nighttime
sleep, a regularly-scheduled nap may
be necessary.
How effective are naps? Is it true that
a 20-minute power nap is equivalent
to one hour of normal night sleep?
Naps are not as effective as
obtaining a consistent and adequate
amount of consolidated night sleep.
An irregular napping schedule can
result in difficulty falling asleep at
night and poor sleep quality.
However, for college students
who tend to suffer from chronic
sleep deprivation as a result of their
busy lifestyles, the benefits of naps
outweigh the consequences.
While a 20-minute power nap
may be equivalent to one hour of
normal night sleep in some individu
als. this equation is not universally
applicable.
Factors such as sleep debt, the
nap time in relation to the individu
al's normal circadian rhythm and
other medical problems influence

the effectiveness of naps.
What is a circadian internal clock,
and how does it affect sleep patterns?
The circadian internal clock con
trols the sleep-wake pattern and is
influenced by light, behavioral cues
and social cues. The clock in humans
is located in the suprachiasmatic
nucleus (SCN), a distinct group of
cells found within the hypothalamus.
Most individuals tend to have a
sleep-wake cycle longer than 24
hours and therefore may have a
desire to go to bed a little later each
night and arise a little later each
morning.
How does alcohol affect sleep pat
terns?
Although alcohol may make it
easier to fall asleep, it results in short,
fragmented and non-refreshing
sleep. Alcohol decreases the time
spent in the dreaming state and
increases the time spent in deep—
slow-wave sleep, causing fatigue the
next day. It also relaxes the throat
muscles, resulting in increased snor
ing and sometimes periodic cessation
of breathing.
What kind of factors lead to insomnia
and what can individuals do to pre
vent it?
According to Kushida. risk fac
tors such as depression, anxiety,
major life changes or frequent travel
may precipitate insomnia in a predis
posed individual.
A regular bedtime and awaken
ing time (yes, even on weekends)
and avoidance of alcohol, caffeine,
nicotine, heavy meals and exercise

two to three hours prior to bedtime
are recommended to individuals
with insomnia.
The person should avoid remain
ing in bed for longer than 20 minutes

it he or she cannot sleep. It is better
to go into another room and do
something that promotes drowsiness
(such as reading a boring textbook)
and then returning to bed when

drowsy.
Is there such a thing us too much
sleep?
According to Kushida, absolutely
not.
