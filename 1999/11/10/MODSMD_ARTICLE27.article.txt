Dreams are real while they last. Can we
say more of life? — Havelock Ellis
What cxactly is your mind doing when
you dream? Sleep research has long since
abolished the myth of the sleeping state
as a simple cessation, or rest from wake
fulness. However, controversy still exists
over the degree of consciousness at
which the sleeping brain operates.
Dreaming, which occurs during the
Rapid Eye Movement stage of the sleep

cycle, presents a particular paradox: how
is it that the brain creates vivid mental
imagery in the absence of sensory stim
uli?
Dream researcher Dr. Stephen
Laßerge answers this question by assert
ing that dreams are indeed conscious
experiences; he even posits dreams as the
most pure forms of consciousness that we
experience.
Research that has come out of
Laßerge's Lucidity Institute at Stanford
has served to elucidate the dreaming pro
cess. Laßerge believes that dreams result
from the brain's attempt to simulate the

world using the only kind of information
that the sleeping brain has access to —
internal information.
Dreaming, then, can be viewed as per
ception without the constraints of senso
ry input.
Lucid dreaming occurs when people
realize that they are dreajning while they
are still asleep. Laßerge has focused
much of his research on the experiences
of lucid dreamers and considers lucid
dreaming to be a model for studying con
sciousness.
Strikingly, Laßerge's research has
demonstrated that lucid dreamers can
remember waking life circumstances and
can act volitionally during their dreams.
For example, it was determined that
"dream time" corresponds with actual
time when lucid dreamers marked cer
tain time intervals during their dream
with their eye movements. The time that
elapsed between eye movement signals
corresponds with the length of time
dreamers feel they experience during
their dreams.
Dream research has also correlated
personal, subjective reports of dream
activity with measures of physiological
parameters.
For instance, Laßerge and others
have shown that physiological recordings
of eye movement match well with subjec
tive accounts of eye movement by the
dreamer upon awakening.
Lucid accounts of orgasm also corre
late with physiological patterns for sex
during the waking state.
If you want to learn to lucid dream,
the first step that Laßerge suggests is to
build up your ability to recall your
dreams. That way it will be easier for you
to recognize when you arc dreaming.

ing can also be found on Laßerge's web

So if you are sick of that recurring
dream where you walk into Math 41
without any clothes on, you might con
sider becoming a lucid dreamer.
That way you could put your clothes
back on or at least walk into a better
class.
