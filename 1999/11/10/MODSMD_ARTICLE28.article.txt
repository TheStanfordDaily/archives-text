# The 						effects of sleep deprivation

### Monya De Contributing writer 
Feeling a little under the weather? You
might blame a sniffling roommate, commu
nal bathrooms or your wet bike seat, but how
much have you really slept lately?
Although it is regarded as an expendable
luxury by college students, computer pro
grammers and medical residents galore,
sleep, as experts constantly emphasize, is
more important to our health than it is given
credit for.
In fact, sleep disorders and sleep depriva
tion add $15.9 billion to the nation's health
care bill every year. As the pace of life con
tinues to quicken in today's world, it has
become more and more difficult to maintain
a sleep-valuing society.
Many people jettison part or all of their
seven or eight hours of sleep on the rationale
of "being more productive." But productivity
in the short run almost always affects the long
run.
Specifically, the consequences of too little
sleep are significant and include decreased
immunity, lowered cognitive performance,
increased likelihood of accidents, higher
mortality risk and decreased quality of life.
James Maas, a sleep expert and psycholo
gy professor from Cornell llniversity, bluntly
states that we all live "in a nation of walking
zombies."
Because the human body is programmed
to spend one-third of its life sleeping, short
changing that time robs it of the chance to
store and renew energy.
Stanford Medical School recently put a
different spin on sleep: a new study estab
lished that the effects of sleep deprivation
were remarkably similar to those of alcohol
consumption.
At the same time, the overuse of caffeine
to grab those last few hours of alertness inter
feres with the quality of later sleep.
Clearly, students arc at risk of putting
themselves into a never-ending cycle of
unhealthy habits.
Contrary to the belief of those who feel
that they tire too easily, only one person in a
hundred can get by on five hours of sleep.
The average for adults is 7.5 hours, and
recent research has suggested that teenagers

need more than adults.
In response to this and the observation
that high school students barely make it to
their morning classes, several schools around
the country are starting classes an hour later
than usual. The result has been more produc
tive students.
Improving the quality of sleep is a major
goal of ihose who get very little of it. if the
introduction of "power nap" into the lexicon
is any indication. Anyone can improve his or
her sleep by following simple instructions.
A good sleeper gets up. takes meals and
medications and performs chores at the same
time each day. She or he exercises in the late
afternoon or early evening and has a relaxing
night time ritual such as a warm bath or 10
minutes of reading.
Biological Sciences professor Craig
Heller, who is researching the role of the
hormone melatonin on circadian rhythms,
adds some welcome words for college stu
dents.
"Don't try to study if you are really sleepy
â€” it is not an efficient way to spend your
time. Take a nap instead. Don't hesitate to
sleep in on the weekends," Heller said.
More deadly than a simple decision to pull
an all-nighter is a chronic sleep disorder.
About 40 million Americans suffer from
sleep disorders such as narcolepsy, sleep
apnea, restless legs syndrome and insomnia.
Most sufferers are initially unaware, attribut
ing their fatigue to other causes.
Symptoms of a sleep disorder include:
falling asleep during the day. failing asleep
driving, irregular heartbeat at night, waking
up too early and difficulty falling asleep.
Not only do these disorders cause extreme
fatigue and compromised job performance,
but they carry the risk of death from falling
asleep on the road or while operating
machinery.
Over ISO sleep clinics around the country
are working to study and understand sleep as
well as alleviate the eftects of sleep disorders.
As physicians continue to educate the
public about the benefits of sleeping enough
and well, research in specialized topics such
as pain and sleep, circadian rhythms, shift
work and its effects on sleep, sleep and aging
and infant sleep will provide insight into the
mysteries and ramifications of sleep.
