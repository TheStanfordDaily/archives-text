# ASSU holds inaugural Student Voice Forum
## 
### Irene Lu 
The Student Voice Forum last
night with ASSU President Mike
Levin, Vice President John Millls and
members of the Undergraduate Sen
ate provided a way for students to
voice their concerns and give sugges
tions to the ASSU. Levin and Mills
hope to hold this forum once a quar
ter.
Four main projects that the ASSU
is currently working on are student
space, transportation, communica
tion and programming.
First, students do not have a real
student union because Tresidder is a
"community union," therefore not
open late enough and without
enough space for student use, accord

ing to a newsletter distributed by the
ASSU.
Performing arts groups, student
groups and non-varsity athletes also
do not have enough space, according
to the newsletter. The ASSU hopes
to turn the old Roble Dining I fall into
a performance space by working with
Dean of Students Marc Wais and
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
John Bravman. The fact that resi
dents of Roble 1 lall have limited
study space may also carry weight.
The biggest transportation con
cern was that freshmen will not be
given permits to park cars on campus
next fall. Though the ASSU does not
endorse the "No ( ars for Frosh" pol
icy, they "are committed to helping
the University implement it in a way

that minimizes the impact on next
year's freshmen," according to the
newsletter.
The ASSU plans to lobby for ex
panded Marguerite service along El
Camino Real, bring a private rental
car company to campus and create a
pool of vans available for student
group and dorm use.
Attendees at the forum voiced
many concerns about the parking ban
for freshmen and the bringing of an
independent car rental company to
Stanford. Many students wanted to
know if the car rental company would
be a monopoly, what time periods it
would rent for and how rentals would
work on popular vacation and holi
day weekends. The ASSU is asking
for suggestions at http://assu.stan

ford.edu/voice/surveys/transit.
The third problem addressed was
communication between the student
body and the administration. The
ASSU wants to get a student repre
sentative on the Board of Trustees
and use a new "Connect" e-mail
newsletter to keep students in
formed.
The last topic on the meeting's
agenda was a lack of campus-wide
programming. The ASSU wants to
expand the hours and service of the
Corner Pocket and Java City until the
Coffee House re-opens.
Other students at the forum spoke
out for longer library hours, bringing
dry cleaning service to campus and
expanding some art courses to make
them more available to non-majors.
