# Athletic Department bans Band's halftime mockery of Berkeley
## 
### T.J. Babbitt Editorial staff 
It might seem like as much of a Stanford tradition as
the Big Game Bonfire, but the Athletic Department
has told the Stanford Band that it will not be allowed
to make fun of UC-Berkeley at its Big Game halftime
show.
"There are two things which can offend guests who
come to the game. One is bad customer service and the
other is insults directed at them," said Bob Carruesco,
the assistant athletic director for marketing and ticket
ing operations, explaining the policy.

The Band, for its part, says it plans to comply.
"The Band wants to promote ;i friendly, but enthu
siastic. rivalry between the schools. It's a shame that
the Athletic Department feels that the halftime show
may not be a part of this kind of rivalry," said Band
public relations director Chris I lenderson. a senior.
Carruesco explained that the Athletic Department
is concerned with acts of violence and vandalism that
have occurred in recent years following Big Game,
and said that the policy is part of an attempt tocool the
emotions of fans.
"Anytime yon insult your
guests, you have the possibility of
provoking them." lie said.
"I think it's the recent history
with the Big Game (driving the
new policy]."
Carruesco didn't want to pin
any blame on the Band for those
occurrences, however. "The Band
has always been extremely cooper
ative," he said.
"We understand the Athletic
Department's concern." said Hen

derson. "We hope that other Big
(lame traditions, like Gaieties, will
continue to poke fun at our neigh
bors across the Bay and are sad
dened that we cannot do so — pub
licly on Nov. 20. anyway."
Band leaders have a meeting
with the Athletic Department
scheduled for today.
While they don't expect the de
partment to change its policy, they
do want to clarify whether or not it
is possible to make any reference
to UC-Berkeley in the perfor
mance. before they plan it in fur
ther detail.
Carruesco will get a preliminary

script from the Band next Wednes
day, which he and the Athletic De
partment need to approve.
Asked what the Band could do
for a halftime show other than
make fun of Stanford's biggest ath
letic rival, Carruesco said, "There
are a kit of funny things that go on
in the world."
I lenderson said the Band could
cope with having to find new tar
gets.
"I guess we'll just have to have
fun at someone else's expense this
year. Or maybe — heaven forbid
at no one's expense at all." he
said.
