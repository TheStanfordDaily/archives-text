It might seem like as much of a Stanford tradition as
the Big Game Bonfire, but the Athletic Department
has told the Stanford Band that it will not be allowed
to make fun of UC-Berkeley at its Big Game halftime
show.
"There are two things which can offend guests who
come to the game. One is bad customer service and the
other is insults directed at them," said Bob Carruesco,
the assistant athletic director for marketing and ticket
ing operations, explaining the policy.

The Band, for its part, says it plans to comply.
"The Band wants to promote ;i friendly, but enthu
siastic. rivalry between the schools. It's a shame that
the Athletic Department feels that the halftime show
may not be a part of this kind of rivalry," said Band
public relations director Chris I lenderson. a senior.
Carruesco explained that the Athletic Department
is concerned with acts of violence and vandalism that
have occurred in recent years following Big Game,
and said that the policy is part of an attempt tocool the
emotions of fans.
