# Students bring grape concerns to table
## 
### Jeb Ory 
A discussion surrounding Stan
lord's tabic grape boycott was held
yesterday in White Plaza in the for
mat of an open forum and a debate.
Next week, Stanford students will
have an opportunity to vote to sup
port or oppose the United Farm
Workers' table grapes boycott.
According to Grape Workers and
Farmers Coalition spokesperson
Gary Calorosu, UFW represents less
than 1 percent of the table grape
workers in California. The GW&FC
represents the jobs of over S(),(XX)
workers and farmers.
"UFW has actually not been pur
suing the grape boycott, and it has not
organized grape workers in Califor
nia in the last few years," Calorosu
said.
The debate, organized by the
Stanford Debate Team and spear
headed by Tommy Fee Woon, the as
sistant dean of students/ multicultur
al education, piqued students' inter
est even though the majority of the
program fell through.
"We tried to get different speak
ers, but we ran into trouble putting
the rest of the program together,"
Woon said. "We had planned to let
debaters present arguments anyway,
so when the other speakers didn't
show, we gave them more time."
Chief debaters were sophomore
Rohan Radhakrishna and co-termi
nal student Erik Bensom. Both mem
bers of the debate team had less than
five minutes to prepare their argu
ments.
"I had nothing prepared. I looked
up some information on the Internet,
and I just spit out as much as I could

in defense of the boycott," Radhakr
ishna said.
('alorosu'sjob, as spokesperson, is
to educate grape-boycotters on the
changes that have occurred since the
boycott was first established in 1985.
1 le said his organization was founded
in I9N.S, one year after the boycott
began, to maintain a free and open
market for ( alifornia table grapes.
Joe Podulka, a graduate student in
Engineering-Economies Systems
and Operations Research, was one of
the 30 to 40 students and faculty who
stopped on their way to class to listen
to the debate.

" The forum is interesting because
it's not rigidly organized. You don't
have to listen if you don't want, but if
you like what you hear [as you pass
by J you can stay," Podulka said.
Senior Gautam Harjai also ap
proved of the way the issue was dis
cussed in White Plaza.
"1 think it's a good way to get the
issue out. I think the grape discussion
has become much more of an issue
than when 1 started going to school
here," Gautam said.
The boycott originated as a
protest of workers being subjected to
live harmful pesticides: dinoseb.

parathion, phosdrin, methyl bromide
and captan. According to Calorosu,
all live have been eliminated or are
scheduled for removal.
Furthermore, Calorosu said. Har
vard and Yale Universities have
dropped the boycott and have re
sumed serving table grapes. Calorosu
thinks Stanford has become pre-oc
eupied with the issue.
"I think Stanford spends way too
much time on the issue. We think
Stanford should stop promoting the
boycott every year," said Calorosu.
"UFW does not actively pursue it any
more, so why should Stanford?"
