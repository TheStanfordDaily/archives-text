# GWN promotes safety, self-defense workshops
## 
### Margaux Hall 
In an initiative to promote crime
awareness and safe lifestyle practices
on campus, the Graduate Women's
Network sponsored the first of two
self-defense workshops last night.
Sixty-five members of the Stan
ford community signed up for the
three-hour safety session, which fea
tured Deputy Sharon Donaldson
from the Stanford Police Depart
ment and three FBI agents, who
taught defensive tactics.
ITie instructors taught basic self
defense strategies to the participants,
which included undergraduate and
graduate students and faculty.
In addition, GWN will sponsor a
second workshop Saturday that will
focus on firearms familiarization and
safety techniques, according to FBI
agent Michael Velasco.
The Saturday workshop, which
will take place on the firing range of
the Santa Rita Sheriff Department
Complex, will offer the attendees
hands-on experience with firearms,
according to Velasco.
He added that familiarization
with firearms is necessary since many
women respond to weapon con
frontation with extreme anxiety and,
as a result, may not evaluate all of
their options in the situation.
"The goal is to teach the mental
and physical preparation that women
here need to survive violent encoun
ters," Velasco said.
Lauren Popell, a masters student
in documentary film and a co-coordi
nator of the event, added that the di
verse backgrounds of Stanford grad

uate students create a need for edu
cation on the history of assaults on
campus, as well as on preventative
measures to avoid these situations.
"Since the graduate community
comes here from institutions differ
ent from Stanford, graduate women
aren't always sure of what to make of
the Stanford community," she said.
The speakers at the event empha
sized a need for students to practice
safe lifestyle habits even though the
incidences of violent crime on cam
pus are generally low.
Donaldson added that students
should also be cognizant of ways to
protect themselves from theft.
Despite the relatively low crime
rate on campus, many workshop par
ticipants expressed concern over the
Oct. 17 attack on a runner by the
Dish.
Ann Fridlind, a doctoral student
in Civil and Environmental Engi
neering, said she attended the work
shop to learn about ways to protect
herself from a similar incident.
"I want to know what's best to do
in case of an attack, so I can be better
prepared," Fridlind said.
In addition to consideration of
joggers who run in such isolated
areas, concerns for the safety of stu
dents living off campus and those
working in libraries or labs until late
at night prompted the event, accord
ing to event co-coordinator Eliza
beth Loboa Polefka, a doctoral stu
dent in biomechanical engineering.
GWN hopes to expand on its self
defense education for the graduate
community with another workshop
in the spring, according to Popell.
