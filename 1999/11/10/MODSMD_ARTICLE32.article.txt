Stanford athletics has had its
share of individual champions. But
rarely do individuals dominate the
competition as much as senior
Anika Leerssen did at the
Women's Single-handed National
Championship last weekend.

■ Friday-Sunday: Senior co-captain
Anika Leerssen became the 1999
ICYRA Women's Single-handed
Champion by winning 15 of 16 races
at the 1999 ICYRA / Vanguard Sin
glehandcd National Championships
in Newport. R.I.

Leerssen, co-captain of the
Stanford sailing team, won a record
15 of the weekend's 16 races to be

come the nation's best collegiate
sailor.
Leerssen did not even give the
competition a chance, winning and
setting a collegiate national cham
pionship record in the waters off
her hometown of Newport, R.I.
The event was held under windy
conditions of 15-25 knots Friday
through Sunday.
Qualifiers for the event were
held in the eight Intercollegiate
Yacht Racing Association districts
this fall; the top two sailors from
each district were sent to the cham
pionships.
Leerssen ended up second be
hind Katie Clausen of USC in the
Pacific Coast Qualifiers, hosted by
USC Oct. 16-17.
By the end of the first day of the
national championships, Leerssen

had won all six races. That put her
ahead of the second-place boat
with a si/able lead of 11 points.
She increased this lead on Satur
day by winning another six races,
but she finished in eighth place in
the last race of the day — the only
race she did not win outright.
Sunday, Leerssen finished the
last day of the regatta with another
three first-place finishes. Clausen
— who had edged Leerssen in the
qualifying races — finished in 11th
place.
"It was pretty neat to be making
the scores like that." Leerssen said.
When asked about the anom
alous eighth-place finish, Leerssen
was unconcerned.
"That was just to see if Steve
[Bordeau, Stanford sailing team
coach) was paying attention," she

said.
Theresa Brooks from the U.S.
Coast Guard Academy finished
second and Claudia Stroeble from
Queen's University came in third.
In the Coed championships,
held concurrently. Queen's Uni
versity's Oskar Johannson came in
first, Bernard Luttmer (also
Queen's University) second and
Sean Doyle from Harvard third.
Stanford sent no sailors to the
event.
Leerssen also received the Jane
L.utz Trophy as the 1999 ICYRA
Women's Single-handed Champi
on.
She will be sailing next with the
entire Stanford Sailing team this
weekend at the North / South re
gatta. hosted by UC-Santa Bar
