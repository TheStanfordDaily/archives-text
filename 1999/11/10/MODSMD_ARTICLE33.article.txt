While the No. 9 Stanford men's
golf team will not compete until
early February, the individuals that
comprise ii continue to impress.
Freshman Ron Won shot a M
last Saturday to qualify for the
Buick Invitational, a P(Â«A I our
event at lorrey Pines (iolf Course
in I a Jolla, C alif.
l orrev Pines held a one-round
amateur qualifier for its annual
PGA event on Saturday. The top
two players of the day received invi
tations to play with the pros at the
Buick. from Feb. 10-13.

Won's score of three-under par
led the amateur field. I le played late
in the day but did not know his exact
situation until he walked off the
course.
I Ie avoided the water and parred
the par-five I Nth hole to finish his
solid round and secure a spot in the
Buick field among the best profes
sional golfers m the world.
Won's victory at lorrey Pines
comes 011 the heels of his impressive
fourth-place finish at the Oct. 29-31
Nelson Invitational held at the Stan
lord Golf Course. Won. playing as
an individual, tallied a three-day
total of 210 (75-66-69), including
two stellar closing rounds at the Nel

son. propelling his game into the
amateur qualifier on Saturday.
"The Nelson was the first tourna
ment in college that I played really
well in," Won said.
Head coach Wallv Goodwin is
equally impressed with his fresh
man's performance over the week
end.
"What he's done is really special.
He's been playing unbelievably
lately, ever since that second round
[of the Nelson]," he said.
The Buick, played outside San
Diego, will feature a field of 1.%
players, including the two amateurs
that qualified on Saturday. The
tournament's defending champion

is former Stanford golfer Tiger
Woods.
Woods is scheduled to defend his
title at the tournament in February.
He has won his last four tourna
ments, a feat not accomplished since
Ben Hogan did it in 1953.
Won will certainly be in good
company at the Buick. Also slated
to appear are PGA lour staples
Mark O'Meara, Davis Love 111 and
Phil Mickelson.
Stanford has not scheduled a
team tournament that conflicts with
the Buick. but it does head for the
Taylor Made Waikoloa Intercolle
giate in Kona, Hawaii, later that
week.
