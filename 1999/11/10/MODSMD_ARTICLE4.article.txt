# Cohen: DNA genius on the Farm

first in a series of five commemorat
ing the top five Stanford individuals
of the century who have significant

its people, with lasting historical ef
fects on Stanford and society.
Every day. researchers report
on the discovery and cloning of
genes, leading to major advances in
science and medicine. But perhaps
none of those discoveries would
have been possible without the
work of Genetics Prof. Stanley
Cohen.
In. 1973. Cohen, along with col
league Herbert Boyer from UC-
San Francisco, developed the tech
nique of DNA cloning that
spawned the field of biotechnolo
gy-
Their discovery changed the
face of biological and biomedical
research. Indeed, nearly every field
in biology now uses the techniques
developed by Cohen antl Boyer.
"[Cohen and Boyer's] discovery
has made an absolutely enormous
difference in every field of biolo
gy." said Immunology and Micro
biology Prof. Hugh McDevitt.
Developing the technology
The storv of Cohen and Bover's

collaboration is classic. In Novem
ber of 1972, both scientists attend
ed a bacterial plasmid research
conference in Hawaii. At the time,
Cohen was studying antibiotic re
sistance using plasmids — small cir
cular pieces of DNA — and Boyer
was studying the transcription ap
paratus of cells.
While talking over a midnight
snack at a delicatessen one
evening, Cohen and Boyer realized
they could combine their work to
introduce specific DNA segments
into bacteria.
Within four months, they
showed that DNA cloning was pos
sible. Cohen used restriction en
zymes from Boyer's lab to cut the
plasmid, which carried an antibiot
ic-resistant gene, and insert it into a
larger piece of DNA. The DNA
was then taken up by bacteria.
Amazingly, the bacteria became
antibiotic resistant.
Cohen then showed that the

cloning technique could he used to
insert pieces of DNA from other
organisms into bacteria, producing
foreign proteins. I or the first time,
the species barrier had been bro
ken.
Cohen and his colleagues recog
nized the vast potential of this tech
nique almost immediately. Word
spread to Neils Reimer, then-direc
tor of Stanford's C )ffice of Technol
ogy Licensing, who approached
Cohen about patenting his new
technique.
Cohen was hesitant about ap
plying for the patent. "We really
didn't think in terms of patents
(back then). There were questions
as to whether you (could| patent
methods such as (ours)," he said.
Eventually, Cohen agreed that
patents would allow development
of the technique. In 1974. Cohen
and Boyer applied for three scpa-
