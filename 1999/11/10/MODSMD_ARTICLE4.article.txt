# Cohen: DNA genius on the Farm

### Bruce Wang Editorial staff 
Editor's Mole: This article is the
first in a series of five commemorat
ing the top five Stanford individuals
of the century who have significant
ly contributed to the University and
its people, with lasting historical ef
fects on Stanford and society.
Every day. researchers report
on the discovery and cloning of
genes, leading to major advances in
science and medicine. But perhaps
none of those discoveries would
have been possible without the
work of Genetics Prof. Stanley
Cohen.
In. 1973. Cohen, along with col
league Herbert Boyer from UC-
San Francisco, developed the tech
nique of DNA cloning that
spawned the field of biotechnolo
gy-
Their discovery changed the
face of biological and biomedical
research. Indeed, nearly every field
in biology now uses the techniques
developed by Cohen antl Boyer.
"[Cohen and Boyer's] discovery
has made an absolutely enormous
difference in every field of biolo
gy." said Immunology and Micro
biology Prof. Hugh McDevitt.
Developing the technology
The storv of Cohen and Bover's

collaboration is classic. In Novem
ber of 1972, both scientists attend
ed a bacterial plasmid research
conference in Hawaii. At the time,
Cohen was studying antibiotic re
sistance using plasmids — small cir
cular pieces of DNA — and Boyer
was studying the transcription ap
paratus of cells.
While talking over a midnight
snack at a delicatessen one
evening, Cohen and Boyer realized
they could combine their work to
introduce specific DNA segments
into bacteria.
Within four months, they
showed that DNA cloning was pos
sible. Cohen used restriction en
zymes from Boyer's lab to cut the
plasmid, which carried an antibiot
ic-resistant gene, and insert it into a
larger piece of DNA. The DNA
was then taken up by bacteria.
Amazingly, the bacteria became
antibiotic resistant.
Cohen then showed that the

cloning technique could he used to
insert pieces of DNA from other
organisms into bacteria, producing
foreign proteins. I or the first time,
the species barrier had been bro
ken.
Cohen and his colleagues recog
nized the vast potential of this tech
nique almost immediately. Word
spread to Neils Reimer, then-direc
tor of Stanford's C )ffice of Technol
ogy Licensing, who approached
Cohen about patenting his new
technique.
Cohen was hesitant about ap
plying for the patent. "We really
didn't think in terms of patents
(back then). There were questions
as to whether you (could| patent
methods such as (ours)," he said.
Eventually, Cohen agreed that
patents would allow development
of the technique. In 1974. Cohen
and Boyer applied for three scpa-

rate patents on their DNA cloning
technology. The patents were
granted in 1980, making Stanford
one of the first universities to
broadly license biotechnology.
Birth of a new field
The impact of Cohen's cloning
technology was immense.
In the early 19705, McDevitt was
studying the immune response, try
ing to understand the molecular na
ture of an antigen molecule, which
helps the body distinguish foreign
cells from its own. Using the tech
niques available at the time, it took
him over a year to figure out just a
tiny fraction of the antigen's amino
acid sequence.
"1 was essentially stuck," said
McDevitt. With the available tech
niques, it would have taken 10 to 20
years for McDevitt to figure out the
molecular nature of one antigen.
When he heard of Cohen's
cloning technique, his lab applied it
to its project. Within a few years,
McDevitt had figured out not only
the molecular identity and function
of his first antigen, but of many
antigens from organisms ranging
from mice to humans.
"The whole recombinant DNA
revolution was enabled by the
Cohen-Boyer discovery," said
McDevitt. "It had an enormous im
pact, not just on me, but on every

one.
Cohen's DN A cloning technolo
gy has helped biologists in virtually
every field, allowing researchers to
transfer genes between organisms
and produce biologically active
proteins. Cloning has also made it
easier to understand the function of
genes and cellular processes.
This approach opened the field
of genetic engineering. The pro
duction of insulin for diabetes pa
tients, human growth hormone for
underdeveloped children and clot
dissolving agents for heart-attack
patients are just a few examples of
products made possible by Cohen's
cloning technique.
Scientists can now introduce
healthy genes into the chromo
somes of patients suffering from
terminal genetic illnesses to restore
vital functions.
Over 300 companies have ap
plied for licenses to use the cloning
technology, a tribute to the broad
application of the method. Sales of
products that use the cloning tech
nology have exceeded $41 billion.
Without the Cohen-Boyer
method of DNA cloning, "the face
of biomedicine and biotechnology
would look totally different," said
McDevitt.
Contributions to Stanford
Cohen's work has had a tremen
dous impact on Stanford as well.
The DNA patents have been a
large source of income for the Uni
versity. According, to Katherine

Ku, director of the OTL, the
Cohen-Boyer patents have gener
ated over $256 million in gross roy
alties, of which $107 million were
shared with the University of Cali
fornia.
Revenue generated from the
patent was divided four ways. Fif
teen percent of the revenue went to
support the operating costs of the
O I L. The rest of the revenue was
split into three parts, one-third
going to Cohen, one-third to the
departments of Medicine and Ge
netics and one-third to the School
of Medicine. Over $36 million have
been distributed each to the School
of Medicine and the departments
of Medicine and Genetics.
The purpose of the royalty in
come, according to Ku, is to pro
mote education and research at
Stanford. Much of the money that
went to the School of Medicine and
the individual departments sup
ports faculty research.
Cohen used most of his share to
support postdoctoral fellows and
general research at Stanford.
In 1988, when its share of the
patent royalties exceeded the
O I'L's operation costs, the OTL es
tablished the Research Initiative
Fund, a program to support new,
innovative research that could be
difficult to fund through traditional
sources.
Each year, approximately
$600,000 is granted to several
dozen Stanford researchers. These
grants have allowed research pro
jects ranging from prototyping au

tomated air traffic control to using
genetic models to design anticancer
drugs.
Cohen, however, is more
pleased with the impact that his
technique has had on science as a
whole. "From my perspective, the
scientific contribution is most im
portant," he said.
"It's very satisfying to see the
way this methodology has changed
biology, the way it has made possi
ble diagnostic and therapeutic
methods," said Cohen.
Indeed, Cohen's work has great
ly enhanced the understanding of
cellular biological, health and dis
ease processes. It is the foundation
of much current biological re
search.
Cohen has won countless
awards and honors, including the
Albert Lasker Basic Medical Re
search Award in 1980 and the Na
tional Medal of Science in 1988.
Fven with his success, Cohen is
hard at work pursuing the basic re
search he says he loves best. Cohen
has continued to make significant
contributions to biology. He devel
oped the methodology of using "re
porter" genes to study gene expres
sion in cells, and was one of the first
to study the nature of transposable
genetic elements in bacteria.
Cohen explains his dedication to
his work this way:
"In science, one of the special
things about being a scientist is the
ability to work on questions that in
terest you. That's what I've done in
my career."
