deploring the cheese maker's owner
ship hv Philip Morris, the tobacco
giant, in a rally held by INFACT. a
national grassroots organization.
Junior Ned To/un and INFACT
field organizer Antha Williams, a
1998 Dartmouth graduate, led a
corps of 15 volunteers who (lagged

students down and informed them of
Philip Morris's international market
ing strategies, including marketing
cigarettes to children in third world
locations such as (Tiina and Africa.
"Corporations like Philip Morris
are making huge profits at the ex
pense of kids all over the world.
That's why we're supporting IN
FACT's Kraft boycott, and urging
other students on our campus to get
involved.'" senior Gabriel Nunez-

Moran said in a press release.
INFACT led the rally in 42 states
and IK9 cities. so the Stanford rally
was part of a national protest. Col

terday in their annual meeting, held
in New York. CREF's decision will
not be known until CREF's annual
shareholders' meetings are over.
1 lowever, the chief purpose of the
rally around the college campuses
was to increase consciousness of
Philip Morris's ownership of Kraft.
"Raising awareness is the basic
goal. People here will become CEOs,
managers and business leaders. I
don't think many people realize that
Kraft is owned by Philip Morris,"

Tozun said.
Other goals, according to
Williams,arc todisseminate informa
tion ahout the boycott, to force Kraft
employees to answer tough questions
regarding their affiliation with the to
bacco giant and to educate people on
the practices of Philip Morris.
"Philip Morris targets their mar
keting in other countries directly to
ward children. For example, in Cam
bodia, the Cambodian equivalent of
girl scouts sell cigarettes door-to
door," Williams said.
The boycott is drawing exposure.
San Jose Mercury News reporter Eu
gene Louie turned out to interview

students. Louie personally supported
the efforts of the rally's organizers.
"I think it's really healthy. I grew
up in the 60s, and it was a very tumul
tuous period," Louie said. "I think
anytime you can get people to stand
up for what they believe in, it makes
democracy work better."'
Larry Edwards, the executive rep
resentative of Consumer Response
for Kraft, could not be reached for a
response.
