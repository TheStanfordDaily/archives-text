# Big changes come to P.O. boxes
## 
### T.J. Babbitt Editorial staff 
Did you think you could safely ig
nore the planned renovations at the
Stanford Post ()ffice? Think again.
In preparation for the transition of
postal services to Levin Field early
next year as the post office building is
renovated, many customers will re
ceive an entirely new P.O. box num
ber this upcoming fall, and all cus
tomers will have to pick up a new key
for their new box.

Lists with post office box number
changes are going out to dorms this
week and will be posted by next
Monday in the Registrar's Office.
Key distribution to undergraduate
and graduate students is tentatively
planned for Nov. 30, Dec. 1 and Dec.
2.
Mail delivery will continue to
function as usual, until at least the
* «
end of finals, when new boxes are
tentatively scheduled to be placed in
their temporary new home on Levin
Field, near Florence Moore Hall and

Mayfield Avenue. They will remain
there until renovations are complet
ed to the central campus building,
possibly by fall 2(XX).
In order to access the new boxes,
all customers will need to pick up a
new key. because all of the new boxes
are key-operated. Some customers
— those who currently have boxes
with combination locks — will have
to learn a new P.O. box number.
" I"he combination boxes are corn-
pletely outdated, and no longer have
replacement parts available." said
Hill Johnston, the Student P.O. Box
Coordinator for the Registrar's Of
fice. " I hey dale back to 1456,"
Johnston said the renumbering
was necessary because new boxes
come with a different number system.
I he post office is doing what it can
to make sure that the new numbers
do not cause confusion or misdeliv
ercd mail.
Mail addressed to the old box
numbers should continue to arrive
for long after the changeover takes
place, perhaps as long as two or three
years, according to Johnston. 1 le said
the post office is discouraging eus

turners with new box numbers from
filing change of address forms, be
cause the post office is already aware
of what it needs to do.
"The local post office has gone out
of its way to make this as simple as
possible for students," Johnston said.
Customers who have key-operat
ed post office boxes now do not have
to return their current key, and their
$1 deposit will be rolled over to the
new key.
The scheduling uncertainties arise
from ordering problems for the new
boxes Johnston said that both he and
the post office would like to stick to
the current schedule, but that if the
new boxes don't arrive soon enough,
they may have to push key distribu
tion to next quarter, with service on
Levin Field starting sometime after
that.
