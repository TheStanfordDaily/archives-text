## Clinton delays visit to Greece in reaction to protests 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi
dent Bill Clinton will delay and
shorten a trip to Greece in an
extraordinary reaction to growing
security concerns and the prospect of
violent anti-American demonstra
tions.
Officials said Wednesday there
were fears not only for Clinton but
also for members of his staff and the
traveling press, who arc not protect
ed by the tight security bubble cover
ing the President. The I Jnited States
also expressed unhappiness about
Greece's response to terrorism.
A three-day visit to Athens was to
lead off an 11-dav trip also taking
Clinton to Turkey, Italv and Bulgar

ia — and perhaps Kosovo. Now.
Greece will be wedged in between
Turkey and Italy, and Clinton's stay
w ill be cut to about a day. The White
I louse said (i recce had recommend
ed the changes.
"We have some concern on secu
rity." presidential spokesman Joe
Lockhart said. State Department
spokesman James Rubin, discussing
Greece's response to terrorism, said,
"Obviously we are not satisfied. We
think more needs to be done."
Several recent attacks, including
Wednesday s firebombing of an
Athens car dealership, have been
linked to terrorist groups opposed to
Clinton's visit.

Security issues are always a major
issue in presidential travels but rarely
receive the prominence of this case
or provoke such a public change in
schedule. Rubin defended the han
dling of the situation.
"It would be a grave error." he
said, "to dismiss security concerns
and then potentially have a disaster
on our hands."
In particular, the United States is
unhappy about Greece's failure to
crack down on the terrorist group
November 17, which has killed 21
people including four Americans
since 1975. The name refers to a
Nov. 17, 1973, crackdown on pro
democracy students by the then-rul

ing military regime. Traditional!)
there are big demonstrations to
denounce the United States, which
many Greeks believe supported the
seven-year junta that collapsed in
1974. '
Concerns about Clinton's trip
were heightened alter the govern
ment of Premier Costas Simitis said
it would not block protesters from
assembling outside the U.S.
Embassy or the nearby concert hall
where Clinton was scheduled to
make an address.
Greece's Comrtiunity Party said
the delay in Clinton's trip only "gives
the opportunity to intensify" demon
strations.

I'lie president's truncated sched
ule could be a political and diplomat
ic humiliation lor Greece's Socialist
government, which faces elections
next year. The president still plans to
spend five days in I urkey. Greece's
regional rival, fora state visit and a
summit of the 55-country Organiza
tion for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
Anti-American sentiment is
strong in Greece. Many Greeks
believe the United States, although a
NATO partner, favors Turkey in ter
ritorial disputes and war-divided
Cyprus. Thousands of Greeks
demonstrated in Athens on Monday
demanding that Clinton cancel his

visit.
Clinton, talking about his scaled
down stop, said, "Whether the
demonstrations had anything to do
with it. I don't know. Hut they might
have. But I'm not bothered about it.
You know, it's going to happen (the
demonstrations) and you all (the
press) get to take pictures of it."
The U.S.-led attacks on
Yugoslavia significantly elevated
Greek anger toward the United
States. Most Greeks strongly
opposed the bombings, fearing
national borders in the Balkans
could he at risk in future conflicts.
Cireeks also identify with fellow
Christian Orthodox Serbs.
