### 
Union 715 and UCSF-
Stanford finally
negotiate a contract

The contract that was signed
last Friday between the
members of Local Union
715 at Stanford Hospital and
UCSF-Stanford marks a memo
rable occasion as the culmination
of the contentious negotiations
that have taken place over the last
10 months.
While judging the merits and
demerits of the current agreement,
it is important to note that before
this agreement was reached and
instituted the workers did not have
a contract. This will hopefully
serve as a historic precedent that
will not be deviated from in the
future.
Hie contract is significant in that
it gives legitimacy to the concerns
that the hospital workers had and
continually expressed through
protests, talks with hospital man
agement; moonlight vigils and let~
ters.
The two-year contract assures
ynion members a 3-percent wage
increase per year, abolishes a merit
system of pay and establishes a
Seniority system.
The pay increase is important in
that it will allow workers to earn a
wage more commensurate with the
high cost of living in the Bay Area.
T he seniority system is perhaps
the biggest gain from the contract,
however, because it makes work
ers with the longest tenure the first
in line to transfer and the last in
line to lose their jobs in the event
of layoffs.
; 'ITiis system is much more in
sync with regular employment
practices than the merit system

was. Managers will no longer have
ultimate discretion over employ
ees' wages and terms of employ
ment. Current policies can no
longer be changed without negoti
ations with union members.
Workers will be assured by this
fact when the UCSF-Stanford
merger finally dissolves. Once the
dissolution occurs, the union will
be placed in a precarious position
because the contract binds UCSF-
Stanford and Local 715. When
Stanford resumes full control of
Stanford Hospital, University offi
cials will be left to decide whether
or not to honor the contract.
It would be a step in the wrong
direction if Stanford chose to
revoke the recently formed con
tract. If University officials were
not to honor it, both sides would
be left reverting to an arduous pro
cess of renegotiations. How could
Stanford herald itself as an innova
tive university while not honoring
a contract it had formally partici
pated in negotiating and approv
ing?
.rrni nil ft/would be rno*& appropriate
for University officials to give the
union the pledge of neutrality they
are seeking. Such a pledge would
grant the 2,000 other hospital
workers the right to organize with
out management interference.
They have done so in the past by
calling in consultants and holding
one-on-one meetings between
supervisors and employees that
often raised anti-union sentiments.
The hospital employees who
persisted in procuring this contract
granting them the right to unionize
should be commended for their
efforts. They should continue them
in order to gain further conces
sions and in order to maintain and
secure what they have already
won.
