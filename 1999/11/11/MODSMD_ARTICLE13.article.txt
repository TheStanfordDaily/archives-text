University must commit to
build proposed graduate
housing
I fear that the Nov. 8 story "Grad students
push for more housing," may have given an
overly optimistic assessment of how the
graduate housing shortage will be influenced
by Stanford's next General Use Permit.
The soon-to-be-revised GUP application
and Community Plan drafts allow Stanford
to build as many as 1,900 new housing units
for single graduate students and estimate the
addition of 683 students to the graduate pop
ulation over the next 10 years.
While Stanford administrators seem gen
uinely interested in solving the graduate
housing crisis, it is important to note that the
text of the GUP draft does not itself ensure
that all — or in fact any — of the units will be
built.
Nearly 1,100 graduate students were
rejected in last spring's housing lottery.
Counting partners and families (they are
"units" too), 1,300 people who sought on
campus accommodation were turned away.
In addition, over 2(X) single students current
ly live in sub-standard "stuffed" apartments
on campus, resulting in more people than
bedrooms (this number excludes double
occupancy EV one-bedroom apartments).
Data from the Graduate Student Coun
cil's Graduate Housing Report indicate that
eligible campus residents reapply for on

campus housing at a rate of 92 percent while
only 21 percent of those kicked off campus
reapply in the lottery for various reasons.
In other words, graduate students prefer
to remain on campus long-term, and moving
more students on campus will likely increase
on-campus demand.
When combined with the addition of 683
graduate students and the possibility of even
worse affordability issues off campus in the
next decade, these factors suggest that even
the lull dose of 1,900 new units may not fully
meet on-campus graduate housing demand.
Among the groups to receive new hous
ing under the next GUP, graduate students
are by far the lowest-paid and thus the least
capable of competing in the Silicon Valley
housing market. With average stipends
around $17,(XX), many graduate students can
not afford to rent in local neighborhoods and
are thus being forced further away from cam
pus.
The impact on regional traffic conditions
is not good. Moving more graduate students
on campus will provide the greatest marginal
benefit to the University and to the commu
nity, so graduate housing should be the top
priority in the University's construction
plans.
I would like to sec the University commit
to build the housing it has made space for in
its draft GUP application. Graduate housing
should be built early; this means roughly half
of the 1 ,900 spaces should be built in the first
three years of the permit's 10-year life. I hope

that the final draft to be submitted to the
county Nov. 15 makes this commitment
explicit.

Cowardice prevailed in
decision to ban traditional
Big Game halftime show
Weakness. Weakness and a shameful
lack of courage. Our Athletic Department,
in choosing not to allow the Band a tradi
tional halftime show at Big Game, has taken
the spineless path based on their own weak
ness.
What is a rivalry if it has no content, no
subject? What does it mean, in the context
of our delightful relationship with Cal, to
"have fun ... at no one's expense at all?" It
means nothing. It is an empty statement; and
it is empty because the decision that prompt
ed it was devoid of substance and courage.
To give in to pressures to be mild, paci
fied and vague is both weak and the typical
decision one has come to expect from our
university. To stand up fora bit of taunting,
some yelling, some inner savagery — institu
tionalized in the protective wrapper of a
rivalry — that would have been an interest
ing decision for the Athletic Department
and the University to make.

It would also have been the right deci
sion. To promote humanism, liberty and sav
agery in our expression of mock-hate —
even in the face of pressures to sensitize and
sanitize all actions in the extreme — that
would have been the strong choice. As it
stands now we are made flaccid by the limp
minds and actions within our administration.
And who was the public figure of this
choice? A marketing and ticket director.
Pathetic. I wonder why he is concerned. For
us and the Band, Big Game is not about
making money; it is about our excitement,
our football and our tradition.
Since the Athletic Department chooses
to give up tradition and rivalry, it becomes
incumbent solely on us, the students, to keep
the rivalry strong, humane, primal, vigorous
and palpable. I encourage the Band to defy
this mockery. This is the right thing to fight
for.
I encourage students to bring signs and
yells to the game, big ones, make them witty
and offensive, spare no taunt and project
them throughout the stadium to all of our
guests. Show our University and Cal that we
won't give up our tradition, our humanity or
our right to be fierce.
Do you really think having a delicate
halftime show will keep Cal off the field? Do
you really think rolling over and opting for
the weak decision will keep us off the field?
