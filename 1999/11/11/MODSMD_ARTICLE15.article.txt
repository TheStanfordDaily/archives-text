# Meaning in the Macro
## Finding subtlety in a foreign land 
### 
Sasha Polonsky

So earlier this volume I
gave you my memoirs
of an American
geisha. I tried to offer some
insight into Japanese after
work culture and my role
within it. Standing alone,
however, 1 fear that I fell
short of lauding the bene-

fits and glamour of study abroad. I felt the
need to elaborate.
There are, no doubt, the typical compo
nents of any overseas experience that we are
all coached to anticipate before the big
departure. A semester abroad ... you go to
class, then immerse yourself in the tradition
al culture. Read an article on Hiroshima; go
visit the place. Have a dinner or three and a
theater performance on the Bings, topping
nights off with a tea ceremony in your newly
purchased kimono.
The standard procedure aside, those of us
who spent last spring at Kyoto SCTI gradu
ally discovered facets of Japan that we never
could have learned about in our Stanford
Overseas Program advising book. Paying
attention to the subtle and often mundane
details in new territory surprisingly revealed
the most colorful and human character of the
Japanese culture.
We were instantly uprooted from the land
of no dates and palm trees. We became
rapidly inaugurated into a culture that natu
rally juxtaposes Ã¼biquitous ancient shrines
and temples with a continually evolving
wave of communication technology that has
spread cell phones like wildfire. In more
ways than one, Japan is an enigma of culture,
fashion and adaptability, and we witnessed it
all firsthand.
There is perhaps no other way of life in
which businessmen spend their after-work
hours in a karaoke bar, household toilet
seats are heated while lights are used spar
ingly, the national cuisine derives almost

entirely from the sea, and every man, woman
and child carries a keitai (cell phone) to use
at every possible opportunity.
We took shoes off in the hallway before
entering a house, changed into slippers and
then used yet another pair of slippers in the
bathroom. Mixing up the bathroom slippers
with regular slippers is very disgraceful. Tak
ing baths is common practice there, and
Japanese families usually fill a bath once a
night and take turns rotating through it. As
exchange students in these households, we
too took part in this custom.
Outside of our homestays, we collectively
covered ground from the tropical beaches of
Kyushu to the neon lights, tanned skin and
blond hair of Tokyo.
Many of us were short of funds on our
Golden Week vacation trip and resorted to a
night in a Japanese Love Hotel, designed to
accommodate different "lodging" predilec
tions and to be rented by the hour. Themes
of the rooms range from a Vegas casino
setup to a boxing ring to ... just mirrors. It is
rumored that the architects for these estab
lishments design kindergartens on the side.
At a Japanese McDonalds, a teriyaki
chicken burger or shrimp burger is about $5,
employees bow as you enter and napkins are
used sparingly. There are soda, juice and
beer vending machines on every corner of
every block but rarely a public garbage can
to speak of. Women hand out packages of
tissues on every street corner (to be used for
advertisements, but they also come in handy
when you end up in a Japanese-style bath
room with no toilet paper).
Although non-conformity may be a virtue
in our progressive world, much of our 27-
person group very rapidly assimilated. Fif
teen of us invested in cell-phones of the 4-
inch variety, weighing less than half a bar of
soap. A few of us mastered the arcade game
phenomenon called Dance Dance Revolu
tion. where the computer directs your foot-

steps in a prc-set dance routine.
We became experts on the transportation
system, having traveled by shinkansen (a
bullet train that goes the speed of a low-fly
ing plane) all over the country. Students
from Kyoto and Doshisha Universities
helped us to adjust to the rapidly evolving
trends from colloquialisms to fashion.
The benefits of traveling overseas are
extensive, simply by way of experiencing a
new way of looking at things, living with a
family of a completely different dynamic,
laughing at cultural habits that initially look
ridiculous until you begin doing them your
self. The educational change of backdrop is
obvious, but the experience of making a new
country your classroom is where you find
that the nuances of everyday life become the
most valuable components of your educa
tion.
The way people greet each other, express
affection and interact with tarmlv members..
. all changes with the scenery. Seeing this
daily offers perspective on our own way of
life and our own set of values.
In our five months abroad, we gradually
began to develop the kind of cultural per
spective that comes only with some time
away from the chaos and routine of universi
ty life. Every day we became just slightly
more open-minded so as to realize that there
are more ways than one to greet a friend,
ride a bus or eat a meal.
Fime in Japan urged us all to draw com
parisons and to search for explanations to
the order and disorder of cross-cultural com
munication.
