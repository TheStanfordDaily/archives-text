## The
						GOP in office: what would the U.S. do?

Â£ ~Y" t is hard to he a Republican at Stan-
I ford," a friend of mine lamented
JL recently.
When 1 look at Congressional Republi
cans, however, I find it hard to understand
how she can stomach being a Republican at
all. Partisanship and misplaced self-righ
teousness have driven Congressional
Republicans to make outstandingly stupid
foreign-policy decisions in the last three
months.
America's strength has always entailed
an element of moral authority. Often touted
as the last remaining superpower, the I Jnit
ed States has sought to ameliorate other
nations' unease with an, "Its OK. we are the
good guys" attitude. After the stunning
antics in the Senate recently, however.
America might as well walk around with a
new sign saying. "Its OK, we are the hyp
ocrites."
Let us look at the fate of the Compre
hensive Test Ban Treaty. One would imag
ine that banning nuclear testing is a topic
that everyone could agree on, since even
second-graders will tell you that nuclear
weapons are bad.

Considering the fact that the U.S. seems
to have bombed Iraq every other day'since
last December for not allowing the United
Nations to inspect weapons sites, consider
ing the.fact that the U.S. placed sanctions
against India and Pakistan last year for test
ing nuclear weapons and considering* the
fact that the government has heart palpita
tions it someone mentions "nuclear" in the
same sentence as "North Korea," one
would think that everyone would be ready
to place America in the forefront of nuclear
arms control.
Well, everyone except Congressional
Republicans, who voted the treaty down
and exposed America to international accu
sations of hypocrisy. The next time a rogue
state that poses a direct threat to America
acquires nuclear technology, the United
States is hardly going to be in a position to
protest.
And yet. Congressional Republicans
touchingly insist that the United States
does not need to ratify arms-control
treaties because it is the "fairest kid on the
block." 1 hope that they can maintain
enthusiasm when the "fairest kid on the

block" gets booted out of the United
Nations for not paying its dues.
The United States currently owes the
United Nations more than $1 billion in
arrears, and unless it pays up at least a third
of that debt by the end of this year, it will
lose its vote in the U.N. General Assembly.
The I United States will then be joining other
global power houses such as Sierra Leone,
Somalia and Iraq as a country without offi
cial voice in the General Assembly.
Since the United States cannot lose its
vote in the Security Council, where most
military decisions are made. Republicans
are saying that losing the General Assem
bly vote does not matter. But it does mat
ter. because this high-handed attitude is
annoying every other country in the world,
including America's allies. Furthermore,
this behavior ignores the value of the
United Nations in areas such as peace
keeping. poverty alleviation and emergen
cy relief efforts.
The leading reason that Congressional
Republicans give us for not paying the Unit
ed Nations and for trying to slash develop
ment aid bv $2 billion overall this year is

that the United Nations and other interna
tional organizations support family plan
ning efforts.
Obviously, the Republicans need to do
their homework. With a child being born
into poverty every three seconds, interna
tional organizations would be highly remiss
it they did not support family planning pro
grams. In India alone, a country one-third
the size of the United States, the population
exceeds I billion people.
Republican anti-abortion rhetoric means
that America is lagging behind many
nations in per capita foreign aid donations.
For example, the small Scandinavian nation
of Denmark outstrips the United States in
per capita contributions.
On the front line of this delightful drive
to piss off the world, shadowy figures such
as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Com
mittee Jesse Helms reign. This is the same
man who responded, "Bull feathers," when
told in a committee meeting that America's
embargo in Cuba was driving more than a
million children into poverty.
Given such articulate foreign policy. I
suppose it is no surprise that the leading

contender for the Republican'presidential -
nomination was unable to name the leaders
of India, Pakistan and Chechnya.
After all, the Republicans are making it
very clear that the rest of the world does not
matter. Never mind the fact that America's
prosperity (their top concern) depends on
access to global markets for American
goods. Never mind the fact that America's
military might (another key Republican
interest) will be tolerated only so long as ii
is viewed as benign. Never mind that moral
ity (their catchword) does not include allow
ing people to die because of slashed devel .
opment aid.
I hope George "Dub" Bush does receive J
the Republican nomination. He perfectly
represents most current Congressional
Republicans. All he is missing is another
"M" in his name.

Murium Ali respects and admires George
Bush, Sr. When he visited Kuwait after the
Gulf War, the top TV hit was a song named
"We love you Baba Hush." E-mail her at
