Most importantly, the event is this

ketball.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Today: No. 13 Stanford vs. No. lODukeat
the Coaches vs. Cancer Tournament. 3:30
p.m., Madison Square Garden.

Some might have thought that Cardi
nal basketball had reached the pinnacle ol
success two seasons ago when Arthur Lee
led the team to a surprising Final Four
showing. Others might cite last season,
when the team —ranked among the top
in the nation all season — won its first Pa
cific 10 Conference championship in
hisotry and its first conference title since
1942.'
But this year. Stanford and head coach
Mike Montgomery are truly reaping the
rewards for years of hard work. Instead of
taking a step back with the lossofl.ee and
his compatriots Pete Sauer, Kris Weems
and Tim Young to graduation. Stanford is

looking and moving forward like the
strong, talented program it has become
with what could be the school's most tal
ented team ever.
"Last year we had a veteran club,"
Montgomery said. "We knew what type
of team we were going to be. It's quite a
big difference this year.
"But this is a team that's going to be
real interesting to watch. There's a lot of
room for improvement."
Montgomery could find out just how
much room there is after his team gets
through with this week's Coaches vs. Can
cer Tournament, an event that also fea
tures lowa and defending national cham
pion Connecticut.
"This level of competition's about as
good as it gets," Montgomery said. "This
is probably the top of the heap. I'm a little
worried because [playing tough oppo
nents early] could turn on you. But I think
it'll be good for us."
Though Duke is coming off a loss to
Connecticut in last season's national
championship game, the Blue Devils look
decidedly different from the team many
people considered to be one of the best in
the history of college basketball.
Sophomore Elton Brand, the IW) Na
tional Player of the Year, sophomore
William Avery, the team's starting point
guard, and freshman Corey Maggette left
school early for the riches of the NBA.
They were the first players ever to do so at
Duke.
Coach Mike Krzvzewski also lost se

nior Trajan Langdon. who was the team's
emotional leader and one of the best long
range shooters in the nation, to gradua
tion. Additionally, sophomore center
Chris Burgess transferred to Utah.
"To me |last year] was like ages ago,"
said krzyzewski, who openly criticized
Avery, Burgess and Maggette in the days
following their departures. "In coaching,
you have to move on to the next thing.
Look, I'm just trying to figure out how to
play six freshmen."
But what a group of freshmen
Krzyzewski has to play.
Jason Williams, a 6-foot, 2-inch point
guard who won high school National
Player of the Year honors last season, will
begin the year by replacing Avery at point
guard. Williams will be the first freshman
to start the year at point guard for Duke
since Bobby Hurley, who ended up leav
ing with two national titles.
"Williams is tremendous," Mont
gomery said. "In many respects he's bet
ter than what they had. Not to slight
Avery at all. but Williams has more pure
point-guard tendencies."
So does fellow freshman Mike Dun
leavy Jr., even if he does stand 6-8. The
son of Portland Trailblazers coach Mike
Dunleavy, Dunleavy Jr. was also recruit
ed by Stanford, and Montgomery said he
might have spent some time at the point.
But Dunleavy ended up becoming just
one of four McDonald's All-Americans


Johannes Burge — Daily file
Freshman Casey Jacobsen, along with junior Ryan Mendez and senior David Mosely,
will need to tap into the trio's ability to score quickly from the outside tonight if the No.
13 Cardinal hopes to beat 10th-ranked Duke.
