Where can you find a team of
Hawaiian shirt-clad guys
jumping into lawn chairs while
throwing a 12-pound hot pink ball
amidst the sounds of Sir Mix-a-I .ot?
A new Olympic demonstration
sport?
Nope, the lOC hasn't approved
synchronized lawn chair shotput just
yet.

It was none other than the second
annual Stanford bowling team's
charity bowling tournament held last
Saturday at Palo Alto Howl — the
world's first and only combination
bowling alley and Thai restaurant.
The tournament brought out a
wide range of teams, from the Stan
ford Yell Leaders to fraternities to
the Office of Development, as well
as a number of residences, including
freshman dorms, suites and the yet
to-be-named former Phi Dell house.
All of the squads did battle in a series
of showdowns that ranged from
fierce bowling to, in the words of a
sophomore from Toyon, "more of
just a dance party bv the second
game."
"The event was a great success,"
said Stanford Bowling Team Presi
dent Jim Rohr. a junior. "Everyone
had an incredible time and we were
able to raise $2,(XH) for the Born to
Bowl Foundation."
The foundation, established by
the Robert L. Pierce Memorial
Award, which was presented to the
bowling team by the Stanford Alum
ni Association last spring, is a charity
organization that teaches local ele
mentary-school children how to
bowl.
For the second year in a row, the
team from Theta Delta C hi fraterni
ty captured the total score trophy be
hind the masterful work of junior
Bobby Batista, dubbed "Mr. Big' on
the Theta Delt scorecard.
The squad from Kappa Sigma fin
ished in second place behind the
Theta Delts with an even, balanced
attack featuring all six bowlers.
The Yell Leaders fared well in the

competition. Inking third place on
the strength of sophomore bowler
Nathan Lasche, despite a side com
petition with their lane mates that
forced them to come up with "cre
ative" ways of throwing the ball
down the lane on nearly every other
throw.
Attempts included the "hardhat
bowl," where squad member Jeff
Desjarlais, a sophomore, was pushed
headfirst, wearing a hardhat of
course, into a waiting ball which
went careening down the lane for a
strike. Other offerings featured
squad captain Jeff Cooper, a junior,
bowling from ;i garbage can and a
number of team efforts that involved
all four members of the unit.
"But there is more to bowling
than just high scores for the team."
Rohr said.
Prizes were also awarded in a
number of other categories, includ
ing the best costume award, which
went to the liber-disco squad from
Ccdro.
The team from Donner, under
the leadership of RAs Lindsay
Stamm, a senior, and Brent Jacob
sen. a junior, spent the day engaged
in a heated rivalry with fellow Stern
I fall residents from Larkin and cap
tured the karaoke prize for their
singing of the ever-present hip-hop
music.
f inally, the Thcta Delts captured
another of the prestigious prizes,
taking home the most creative bowl
award for their experiment in the en
ergy-transferring properties of bowl
ing balls in a throw that closely re
sembled the swinging steel ball pa
perweights that adorn the desk of
middle-managers nationwide. They
narrowly escaped with the prize,
beating out the Yell Leaders and
their "bobsled bowl." in honor of
Yell leader senior Mark Ganek.
who is away from Stanford while cur
rently a member of the U.S. Nation
al Bobsled Team, and a number of
cooperative team efforts from the
freshman dorms.

Ben Jones, a junior, would like to
point out the reference to Sir Mix-a
l.ot for the third week in a row in a
sports story. He'd also like to give
some love to the team from the house
soon-to-be-formerly-known-as-680
Lomita — Antja, Sarah, Arik, Matt,
Shivan and Meghann. We didn 't win
much hut we had a damn good time.
