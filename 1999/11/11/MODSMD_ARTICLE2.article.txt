# Race issues conference kicks off
## 
### Margaux Hall 
As part of a University initia
tive to discuss racial issues con
fronting society, Stanford will host
the three-day National Confer
ence on Race beginning today.
"We want the conference to be
holistic and to cover a broad range
of issues that have to do with the
African-American experience,"
said Lucius Barker, professor of
political science and executive di
rector of the conference.
The conference events, which
are free to members of the Univer
sity community, will feature distin
guished scholars and commenta
tors on race-related issues from
across the country.
Among the guest speakers is
John Hope Franklin, a professor
of history at Duke University and
a former chairman of President
Bill Clinton's Initiative on Race.
Franklin, who will speak at a
luncheon tomorrow, will discuss
the forthcoming racial challenges
identified by the President's initia
tive in a report last September, ac
cording to a press release on the
event.
Other featured guests at the
conference include ABC televi
sion correspondent Farai Chideya
and professors from top research
universities across the nation.
In addition, the conference will
welcome two students and one fac
ulty member from each of 10 his
torically black colleges and univer
sities, according to Barker.
"These schools have been in the
forefront in the education of black
leaders," Barker said. "This is a
rare opportunity to convene in one
place an uncommonly large num
ber of scholars who focus their re
search on race and ethnicity."
Tina Gridiron, a doctoral stu
dent in education and president of
the Black Graduate Student Asso
ciation, said she thinks the interac
tion of students from various na
tional universities will prove valu
able in her own studies on race.
"11 gives me a chance to network
with other graduate students who
are up and coming and addressing
some of these issues," Gridiron
said.
The main issues the scholars and
commentators will address include
disease prevention, African Amer

icans in the labor market and affir
mative action.
Barker said the conference co
ordinators wanted to focus the dis
cussions on a wide range of topics
that extended beyond traditional
issues such as affirmative action.
Given this diversity of topics.
Gridiron said the dialogues aim to
encourage participation from a sig
nificant portion of the<Stanford
community.
Eric Marshall, a junior who
plans on attending various confer
ence events, said he thinks the
broad range of topics at the confer
ence is important to expand racial
awareness on campus.
"1 think the Stanford communi
ty has already opened the Universi

ty up to conversation and discus
sion, and this is another opportuni
ty to expand upon progress that's
already been made," Marshall said.
He added that the high level of
publicity behind the conference
will help advance the movement
toward racial awareness.
"It takes big events like these to
grab campus-wide attention and
consolidate on ideas that are build
ing." Marshall said.
The event, which is sponsored
by the Center for Comparative
Study of Race and Ethnicity and
the African and Afro-American
Studies Program, has been in the
making for more than one year, ac
cording to Barker.
Barker added that John Shoven.

professor of economics and former
dean of Humanities and Science,
encouraged the University to spon
sor a national conference on race
by the year 2000.
"It was a direct saying that we
took as a challenge and pursued,"
Barker said.
Shoven proceeded to develop
the framework for the conference
with the Office of the Provost and
the President, according to Barker.
The organization of future
events to promote racial under
standing will be a crucial measure
of the conference's success. Barker
said.
"These collective follow-up ini
tiatives are some of the most im
portant benefits," Barker added.
