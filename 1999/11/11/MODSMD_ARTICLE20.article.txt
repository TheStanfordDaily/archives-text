On Tuesday, the women's ten
nis team practiced with unusual in
tensity. The players seemed anx
ious, banging their rackets on the
ground after missed shots and oc
casionally disputing game scores.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
■ Tomorrow-Monday: Stanford
hosts the Intercollegiate Tennis As
sociation's Fall Regional Champi
onships, Taube Family Tennis Cen
ter.

Of course, the women have rea
son to be on edge. Tomorrow, they
will participate in the early rounds
of the Intercollegiate Tennis Asso
ciation's Fall Regional Champi
onships at the Taube Tennis Cen
ter.
"We're always a little anxious
the week before a tournament,"
said senior Teryn Ashley. "It's nor
mal. Last week, we had a really
solid week of practice. Everything
came together. We're just excit
ed."
The Stanford women's tennis
team will host players from Cali
fornia, Fresno State, Washington,
Washington State, Santa Clara and
Oregon. The individual tourna
ment is a four-day event. Both the
singles and doubles finals will be
played on Monday.
The Cardinal approaches this
weekend with confidence after
turning in a strong performance at
the Riviera All-American
Women's Tennis Championships
in Pacific Palisades, Calif, two

weeks ago.
All seven members of the varsi
ty squad plan to compete in the Re
gionals. In fact, Stanford women
snagged six of the draw's 16 seeds.
Ashley, who, along with fresh
man Laura Granville, reached the
doubles final at the All-American
Championships, is seeded second,
behind Cal star Amy Jensen.
Ashley, ranked sixth in the na
tion, is eager to regain her form
after enduring a long recovery
from tendinitis in her wrist.
"I haven't played a competitive
singles match in several months,"
Ashley said. "That's a long time in
tennis."
Fortunately, Ashley's wrist has
healed enough for her to exploit
her booming serve and penetrating
groundstrokes.
Ashley will need those weapons
to make it through her difficult sec
tion of the draw, which features
Cal's Karoline Borgerson, last
year's finalist.
If Ashley can get past Borger
son in the fourth round, she might
face either senior teammate Jen
nifer Heiser, the 11th seed, or
sixth-seed and 1998 champion
Anita Kurimay of Cal in the quar
terfinals.
Heiser, a four-year veteran of
the squad, is a dangerous floater in
the draw. As a qualifier at the All-
American Championships, she
reached the second round but suc
cumbed to eventual finalist Adria
F.ngel of Wake Forest in three tight
sets.

Sophomore Marissa Irvin will miss some fall tennis action this sea
son while she participates in several professional tournaments.
Tuesday, she fell to Amy Frasier, the world's 20th-ranked profes
