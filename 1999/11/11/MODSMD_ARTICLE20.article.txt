## Women open play at home on Friday 
### Bill Hanson Staff writer 
On Tuesday, the women's ten
nis team practiced with unusual in
tensity. The players seemed anx
ious, banging their rackets on the
ground after missed shots and oc
casionally disputing game scores.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
■ Tomorrow-Monday: Stanford
hosts the Intercollegiate Tennis As
sociation's Fall Regional Champi
onships, Taube Family Tennis Cen
ter.

Of course, the women have rea
son to be on edge. Tomorrow, they
will participate in the early rounds
of the Intercollegiate Tennis Asso
ciation's Fall Regional Champi
onships at the Taube Tennis Cen
ter.
"We're always a little anxious
the week before a tournament,"
said senior Teryn Ashley. "It's nor
mal. Last week, we had a really
solid week of practice. Everything
came together. We're just excit
ed."
The Stanford women's tennis
team will host players from Cali
fornia, Fresno State, Washington,
Washington State, Santa Clara and
Oregon. The individual tourna
ment is a four-day event. Both the
singles and doubles finals will be
played on Monday.
The Cardinal approaches this
weekend with confidence after
turning in a strong performance at
the Riviera All-American
Women's Tennis Championships
in Pacific Palisades, Calif, two

weeks ago.
All seven members of the varsi
ty squad plan to compete in the Re
gionals. In fact, Stanford women
snagged six of the draw's 16 seeds.
Ashley, who, along with fresh
man Laura Granville, reached the
doubles final at the All-American
Championships, is seeded second,
behind Cal star Amy Jensen.
Ashley, ranked sixth in the na
tion, is eager to regain her form
after enduring a long recovery
from tendinitis in her wrist.
"I haven't played a competitive
singles match in several months,"
Ashley said. "That's a long time in
tennis."
Fortunately, Ashley's wrist has
healed enough for her to exploit
her booming serve and penetrating
groundstrokes.
Ashley will need those weapons
to make it through her difficult sec
tion of the draw, which features
Cal's Karoline Borgerson, last
year's finalist.
If Ashley can get past Borger
son in the fourth round, she might
face either senior teammate Jen
nifer Heiser, the 11th seed, or
sixth-seed and 1998 champion
Anita Kurimay of Cal in the quar
terfinals.
Heiser, a four-year veteran of
the squad, is a dangerous floater in
the draw. As a qualifier at the All-
American Championships, she
reached the second round but suc
cumbed to eventual finalist Adria
F.ngel of Wake Forest in three tight
sets.

fell to Engel at the All-Ameriean
Championships, hut Stanford head
coaeh Frank Brennan believes her
play was affected by illness.
"She was sick as a dog," Bren
nan said. "She had a bad cold. As
good as she did, she could've done
better."
Granville will be put to the test
this weekend. In the fourth round,
she could encounter junior Sarah
Pestieau, a teammate who has
given her fits in practice. Potential
quarterfinal opponents include
hard-hitting Kristina Kraszewski of
Washington, the tournament's fifth
seed, and No. 9 Keiko Tokuda of
Stanford.
Brennan believes Tokuda, a
sophomore who has improved
since her impressive debut season

last year, can do damage at this
tournament.
At the Ail-American Champi
onships, Tokuda upset Jewell Pe
terson. a precocious freshman from
Southern California.
"She played an absolutely bril
liant match." Brennan said. "She
changed pace so effectively. She
knows how to play smart in order to
win."
Sophomores Lauren Kalvaria
and Gabriela Lastra are seeded
fourth and seventh, respectively.
At the All-American Champi
onships, Kalvaria reached the
quarterfinals while Lastra won the
consolation tournament.
The duo is seeded first in dou
bles and is the only existing tandem
on the squad that Brennan predicts
will last through the season.
"We're still a little unsure about
our doubles," he said. "We split up
Tokuda and Heiser. They lacked
chemistry and they were the short
est team in Division I tennis."

Brennan is tossing both
Granville and Pestieau into the
doubles lineup, exploring different
combinations in hopes ot coming
up with two more solid teams.
In the meantime, Granville will
play with Tokuda over the week
end while Pestieau will play with
Heiser. Ashley will sit out the dou
bles competition in order to rest
her wrist.
Ashley's regular partner, sopho
more Marissa Irvin, the nation's
second-ranked collegiate player, is
currently playing in professional
tournaments. On Tuesday, Irvin
fell to Amy Frazier, the world's
20th-ranked professional, in the
first round of the $52(),CMK) Advanta
Championships, a prestigious tour

Irvin. who is rapidly encroach

ranked junior in 1998, is the tourna
ment's third seed. Granville also
fell to Engel at the All-Ameriean
Championships, hut Stanford head
coaeh Frank Brennan believes her
play was affected by illness.
"She was sick as a dog," Bren
nan said. "She had a bad cold. As
good as she did, she could've done
better."
Granville will be put to the test
this weekend. In the fourth round,
she could encounter junior Sarah
Pestieau, a teammate who has
given her fits in practice. Potential
quarterfinal opponents include
hard-hitting Kristina Kraszewski of
Washington, the tournament's fifth
seed, and No. 9 Keiko Tokuda of
Stanford.
Brennan believes Tokuda, a
sophomore who has improved
since her impressive debut season

last year, can do damage at this
tournament.
At the Ail-American Champi
onships, Tokuda upset Jewell Pe
terson. a precocious freshman from
Southern California.
"She played an absolutely bril
liant match." Brennan said. "She
changed pace so effectively. She
knows how to play smart in order to
win."
Sophomores Lauren Kalvaria
and Gabriela Lastra are seeded
fourth and seventh, respectively.
At the All-American Champi
onships, Kalvaria reached the
quarterfinals while Lastra won the
consolation tournament.
The duo is seeded first in dou
bles and is the only existing tandem
on the squad that Brennan predicts
will last through the season.
"We're still a little unsure about
our doubles," he said. "We split up
Tokuda and Heiser. They lacked
chemistry and they were the short
est team in Division I tennis."

Brennan is tossing both
Granville and Pestieau into the
doubles lineup, exploring different
combinations in hopes ot coming
up with two more solid teams.
In the meantime, Granville will
play with Tokuda over the week
end while Pestieau will play with
Heiser. Ashley will sit out the dou
bles competition in order to rest
her wrist.
Ashley's regular partner, sopho
more Marissa Irvin, the nation's
second-ranked collegiate player, is
currently playing in professional
tournaments. On Tuesday, Irvin
fell to Amy Frazier, the world's
20th-ranked professional, in the
first round of the $52(),CMK) Advanta
Championships, a prestigious tour
nament in Philadelphia.
Irvin. who is rapidly encroach
ing upon the top 100 in the world
rankings, won three professional
matches in qualifying for the tour
nament. She plans to return to col
legiate competition in January.
