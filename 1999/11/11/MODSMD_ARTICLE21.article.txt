After a second-placc finish to the
University of British Columbia two
weeks ago at the College Cup in
Vancouver, the Stanford's men's
swim team will have a chance to re
deem itself tomorrow when the two
teams compete again at deGuerrc
pool.
"We know a lot more about their
team now that we've swam against
them once," said l()-timc All-Amer
ican Anthony Robinson, a junior.
"Strategically it won t make a big

difference, bill at least now we know
who their big guns are."
MEN'S SWIMMING
■ Tomorrow: Stanford vs. British
Columbia, I p.m., deGuerre pool.

"We know what to expect from
them this time," junior Steven
Brown said of the defending Cana
dian national champions. "They're a
pretty quick team."
The last time the two teams met.
the Cardinal had divided itself as
evenly as possible into two teams to
get more competition. As a result.

Stanford lost some of its usual
strengths in the relay competitions.
Additionally, the Cardinal had
swimmers competing in events in
which they would not usually com
pete, which also detracted from the
team's overall performance.
Another difference in this com
petition. said Robinson, is that there
will be a different order of events.
As opposed to the first encounter
between Stanford and ÜBC, both
the 100-meter and 2(X) brcaststrokes
will be included at this dual meet.
Considering that some of the Stan
ford swimmers excel in these two

events, they should prove to be a
positive addition.
Several Cardinal swimmers are
coming off of impressive perfor
mances in last Friday's meet against
No. 3 Texas. Juniors Rob Canales
and Adam Messner have demon
strated extreme consistency in their
last several competitions, turning in
very encouraging performances.
Against Texas, Canales won both
the 2(X) individual medley and the
200 breaststroke, while Messner
won the 200 and S(X) freestyles.
