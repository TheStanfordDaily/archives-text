### Jeb Ory 
ITiis quarter, Stanford in Gov
ernment will launch the Political Fel
lows Program, which is designed to
give selected students special oppor
tunities to learn about public service.
The SIG program, headed by Co-
Directors of Campus Awareness
Daniel Donovan, a junior, and Nikki
Love, a senior, kicks off this year.
The political fellows will have
special opportunities to become in
volved in various levels of govern
ment.
They will receive priority seating
at regular SIG events, such as guest
lectures; will be invited to special
programs such as naturalization cer
emonies; will get to meet with local
assemblyman Ted Lempert in an
"in-depth seminar" and will get to go
on a field trip to the state Capitol.
Junior Elsa Jacobsen, currently

enrolled in the Stanford in Washing
ton program, views joining the Polit
ical Fellows Program as a natural ex
tension of her work in the capital.
"1 definitely have an interest in
public service, be it law, the private
sector or teaching," Jacobsen said. "I
think meeting with Ted Lempert
would be an excellent extension of
what I have worked on in the sum
mer."
SlG's purpose is to raise aware
ness of government on the campus,
and they hold various events
throughout the year to give students
chances to interact with and listen to
current leaders.
"We are trying to create a culture
of political activism and engagement
on the campus," Donovan said.
"People are always looking toward
the future, but they don't stop and
think about how they could make a
difference now."

SIG plans on selecting 12 fellows,
who will have numerous chances to
join in small discussions about poli
tics and public policy. Furthermore,
this position will allow students an
other way to join in local campus
government.
"I've done some political work
back at home [in Alaska], and [join
ing the program) is the best way to
get tapped into the network," said
freshman Michael Grega, who plans
on applying for the position.
The student-run government or
ganization plans to work harder this
year to bring students and local
politicos together.
"[One goal] is to get our repre
sentative to speak with us about is
sues and how they arc dealt with,
both locally and in Washington,"
Donovan said.
Students may apply by submit
ting a 500-word essay on the follow

ing topic: "As the 20th century
comes to a close, in your opinion,
who has most changed the political
world in the last 100 years and why?"
"We will he judging the essays on
how interested the student is. We
want to know who excites you, and
why you find their [achievements]
interesting," Donovan said.
Another new program in the
works from SIG is the Civic Awards
Program, a public service recogni
tion plan.
For example, Donovan said,
whenever an organization, such as
Stanford Democrats, Stanford Col
lege Republicans or the Haas Center
for Public Service run a civic pro
gram, they will be eligible for the
monthly award.
"With the Civic Awards Pro
gram, we hope to recognize people
who are doing important political or
civic things on campus," Love said.
