University Provost John Hen
nessy explained how his core be
liefs guide his personal and profes
sional life in the third "What Mat
ters to Me and Why" discussion of
the quarter yesterday.
"When .1 thought about what
matters to me," Hennessy said, "I
decided family, friends, religious
beliefs and Stanford."
He focused on four points that
he said make a skillful administra
tor and a good man: integrity and
honesty, fairness and equity, re
sponsibility and respect.
"I operate on the principal that I
say what I mean and do what I say,"
Hennessy said.
Hennessy is a professor of engi
neering who, during his sabbatical
in 1984-85, co-founded the local
firm, MIPS Technologies.
He has since consulted for and
helped start up a variety of compa
nies in Silicon Valley.
While he said business is satisfy
ing for him, Hennessy loves Stan
ford.
"Coming to Stanford was the
second most important thing in my
life after choosing my spouse,"
Hennessy said.
He said he savors Stanford's in
tellectual environment of teaching,
learning and research, and he feels

his role as provost gives back to the
community that has nourished him.
However, he said he worries
that Stanford students may be en
ticed to leave school in order to go
make money in the high-tech in
dustry.
In general, Hennessy said he
takes extreme pride in students
who succeed in the world post-
Stanford.
"I think it's wonderful that Hen
nessy took time to talk to people in
an informal setting about the Stan
ford community," said sophomore
Joseph Smarr, who introduced
Hennessy yesterday and is the
Webmaster for the discussion se
ries.
Hennessy concluded his talk by
discussing his religious beliefs. He
described how his role as a practic
ing Catholic has helped to foster
his notions of service and commit
ment.
Religion, he said, also helped
him through his mother's death in
his freshman year of college and
the death of his brother at the age
of 35.
Though the position of provost
does take up a majority of his time,
Hennessy joked, "I do go home to
visit my family from time to time."
The next "What Matters to Me
and Why" speaker is Music Prof.
Emeritus John Chowning, who will
speak on Dec. 1.
