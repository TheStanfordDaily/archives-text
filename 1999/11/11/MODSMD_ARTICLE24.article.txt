# SCBN offers improved television services
## 
### Amit Garg 
Since beginning a wide series of
changes in 19%, SCBN has made
significant progress in updating its
services.
One of the major changes has
been in TeIeFLiCKS, co-sponsored
by Stanford Student Enterprises.
"We have been increasing the
number of movies, especially of
newly released movies," said senior
Brian Karimzad, SCBN operations
manager. "TeIeFLiCKS is. after all,
our most popular item," he added.
Another change has been
SCBN's funding by special fees.
Since 1996, it has been funded by the
ASSU. In 1996, the group required
$40,(XX) per year. However, it has
been successful in cutting costs to

around $20,(KK) per year.
Prompted by a controversial inci
dent in winter quarter of last year, in
which a pornographic movie was
televised during the early morning
hours of Dead Week, the organiza
tion has also improved its program
ming guidelines.
"Last year the constitution was
revised," said junior Connie Chen,
financial manager for SCBN. "It is
now clearer and each office's job is
now well-defined. ... We have im
plemented better security measures
and better ways of keeping track of
our equipment."
Students producing shows for
SCBN have also praised the
changes.
"SCBN has been going on a tech
nological strive," said senior Andre

Texaco, producer of the"The
Andre Show."
"They now have a better graph
ics design workstation," he said,
"and better equipment in general,
which improves quality."
The measures have been greatly
responsible for making SCBN the
most popular organization in the
combined graduate and undergrad
uate special fee election, receiving
82 percent approval last spring.
However, some other announced
changes are still pending.
"We have not been able to re
carpet [the SCBN office] or improve
the infrastructure," said Karimzad.
"The contract between Toyon
Eating Clubs [where SCBN is locat
ed] and Stanford University is un
sure," he explained. "We are very

likely to move to a new location. We
just do not know when or where."
Despite the problems, SCBN has
had numerous successes. It was the
first non-commercial college televi
sion network to air 24-hour pro
gramming. New contracts include
an agreement with College TV Net
work, a subsidiary of Turner Broad
casting and a deal with a nearby pro
duction studio.
"This allows us to reduce costs
and maintain quality," Karimzad
said. He also said additional plans
for the future include expanding
news programming on the network,
as well as creating an on-air bulletin
system.
"Our goal is to pay back to the
community [by] providing free en
tertainment," Karimzad said.
