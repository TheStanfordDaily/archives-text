# Pre-law conference features 60 deans
## 
### Sameer Ahmed Contributing writer 
Deans from more than 60 law
schools came to Stanford yester
day to hand out applications and
lead workshops as part of the 1999
Pacific Pre-Law Conference.
About 150 prospective law stu
dents from Stanford, San Jose
State University, Cal State-Hay
ward and junior colleges in the
area came to the conference,
which was organized by the Un
dergraduate Advising Center.
"This conference is a recruiting
tool for the deans," said Kathy
Wright, pre-law advisor, associate
director of the center and presi
dent of the Pacific Coast Associa
tion of Pre-Law Advisors. "It
gives the students a chance to
meet the recruiters face to face,
instead of by mail or the Web.
While mailings and the Internet
might be easier and faster, it
doesn't replace this kind of con
tact."
The students who attended the
conference said they wanted to
get a better understanding of how
to get accepted to the different
law schools.
"I came to feel out the
prospects of applying and talk to
the recruiters at different law
schools," said senior Matthew
Siegelman, a computer science
major who might apply to law
school next year. "The conference
helped me get a better sense of
what I need to do to get into law
school."
For the law school representa
tives, the conference was a way of
not only teaching the students
how to get accepted into law
school but also persuading Stan
ford students to apply to their re
spective schools.
"To get into law school, stu
dents must work hard in school,
concentrate on their academic
work and keep their options open

by applying to more than one or
two law schools," said Andrea
Sossin-Bergman, director of ad
missions and recruitment at the
UCLA School of Law.
"Stanford is [the UCLA
School of Law's] third or fourth
feeder school," Sossin-Bergman
added. "We get many students
from Stanford because it is one of
the top undergraduate schools in
the nation."
In addition to the conference,
law school deans prepared break
out sessions throughout the three
hour event in order to discuss rel
evant issues in a more in-depth
manner. Some of the topics in
cluded "The Law School Admis
sions Process," "JD vs. MBA —
Which is for Me?," "Writing an
Effective Personal Statement"
and "Law School in the New Mil
lennium."
Derechos, Stanford's Latino
pre-law society, the Black Pre-
Law Society and the advising cen
ter sponsored the Pre-Law Minor
ity Reception on Tuesday night.
At the reception, about 10 law
school deans discussed issues rele
vant to students of color who are
considering to apply for law
school.
The Pacific Pre-Law Confer
ence was the advising center's last
law-related program this autumn,
but many more programs will be
offered this spring.
"In addition to the conference,
the UAC has had many work
shops for pre-law students,"
Wright said. "In the fall, our
workshops discuss the application
process, financial aid, the LSAT
and other issues relating to juniors
and seniors. However, in the
spring, our workshops focus on is
sues for freshmen and sopho
mores like deciding to go to law
school."
The advising center also pro
vides one-on-one advising to pre
law students.
