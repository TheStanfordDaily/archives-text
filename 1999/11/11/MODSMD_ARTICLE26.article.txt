# Grads discuss change to disciplinary process
## 
### Mills Schenck Contributing writer 
At their weekly meeting in the
Bechtel International Center yes
terday, the Graduate Student
Council debated and passed an
amendment to the Student Judicial
Charter, approved funding to the
Chicana/o Latina/o Graduate Stu
dents Association and approved
four nominations to University
committees.
The amendment to the Judicial
Charter focused on the existing
statute of limitations, which states
that a student accused of miscon
duct could "have no charges filed
more than six months after the al
leged misconduct."
The new amendment lengthens
this period by stating that students
cannot "have charges filed no
more than six months after the al
leged misconduct occurred or
should reasonably have been dis
covered."
The amendment must be passed
by the ASSU Senate, the Senate of
the Academic Council and the
President of the University. It will
not be retro-active.
The amendment passed six
votes to none, with two members
abstaining.
The Board of Judicial Affairs
drafted the amendment out of a
concern that the current statute of
limitation could "prevent action
within the student judicial process
in cases which the nature of the
misconduct renders its immediate
discovery unlikely."
The Board is concerned that
such cases could include embezzle
ment and plagiarism, which might
only be recognized well after any
misconduct has occured.

The GSC's concern about the
amendment focused on the age
and potential deterioration of evi
dence older cases. Members of the
GSC felt that old evidence in such
cases could lead to erroneous judi
cial action.
Dean of Students Marc Wais,
however, said that students "would
be protected by the burden of
proof" and urged that students'
rights would not be violated.
"It is a question of catching peo
ple that might otherwise not be
held responsible," Wais said.
John Mills, vice president of the
ASSU, said, "the amendment is
not a weapon to be used against
students, because students [on the
Board of Judicial Affairs] are im
plementing it."
The GSC also approved funding
for the Chicana/o Latina/o Gradu
ate Students Association, a group
of 1(X) graduate students focused
on promoting Chicano and Latino
culture and unity.
With GSC funding, the CLGSA
will organize a colloquium series,
quarterly speakers, a dinner sym
posium and other events.
Acting on the recommenda
tions of the ASSU Nominations
Commission, the GSC approved
the nominations of four graduate
students to University committees.
Laura Bartley, a doctoral stu
dent in biochemistry, was ap
proved for the Committee for En
vironmental Health and Safety.
Law student Ty Clevenger was
named to the Committee on Public
Events, while civil engineering
doctoral student Roxanne Zollin
and economics doctoral student
Kelly Russell were selected for the
Graduate Housing Advisory Com
mittee.
