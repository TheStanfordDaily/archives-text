# CIA Hurts Saddam's Feelings
## Spook eCirclers invite in, then kick out Iraqi leader. 
### 
Unable to dispose of Saddam
Hussein by military or political
means, the CIA has allegedly
opted to attack the dictator's self
worth. According to sources
requesting anonymity, govern
ment spooks recently started an
eCircle at www.eCircles.com,
invited Hussein in, then booted
out the leader just hours later.
"We got him good!" said one
of the sources that requested
anonymity. "We made him feel
really bad by getting his hopes up
that he could be pari of our crazy
fun. As if."
Sources inside I rati confirm
that Hussein's spirits are at an
all-time low, describing him
as "blue," "down-in-the-mouth,"
"having a heavy heart," and
feeling like "the sun has gone
down on him." A palace servant
claims to have heard the leader
muttering "Daniel is leaving
tonight on a train."
No one knows exactly who
within the agency hatched the
ingenious "Operation Reject", as
it is now being called, but it is
clear that the mastermind was
familiar with www.eCircles.com's
unique invitation-only architec
ture, which allows a member of
;ui eCircle to invite in whoever he
or she wants, and gives them
the option of booting them out
at will.

"Wo created our eCircle and
did all kinds of nutty stuff in it,"
said a second source requesting
anonymity. "We used the music
sharing feature to share MP3s of
great banjo pieces. We posted
photos of chimpanzees dressed
up in human outfits. We chatted
about great couscous recipes. We
even let him know Â«ibout the free
digital camera giveaway." With
the bait in place, the operatives
then invited Hussein into the CIA
eCircle. Tempted to join the
wacky liijinx, Saddam allegedly
summoned his advisors and
asked their opinion of his plans
to accept thee Circle invitation.
When all recommended against
it, he had them killed. Within
minutes, he had joined the
eCircle from his computer in a
chinchilla-walled underground
bunker. Shortly thereafter, the
('IA sprung its trap.
"We let him have his fun for
awhile, then we tossed his ass
out!" said yet another source
requesting anonymity. "Ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha!"
In Washington, the hope is that
the CIA ploy will cause Hussein
to realize that no one likes him,
and that he will in turn step
down from his post and seek
therapy.
"We'll have that country
embracing democracy in no time,"
said a source who asked to be
named, but won't be. "And by
golly, it'll be the best thing that
ever happened to those people.
Just like Russia."


This mop illustrates how government ogents used eCircles.com to put Operation Reject into
motion, unleashing a devasting wave of melancholy upon the Iraqi leader.
