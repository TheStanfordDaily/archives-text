On an eCircle she shares with
her sprawling family back in Ohio,
Michelle Sayson, a first-year stu
dent at Tecumseh State in South
Carolina, broke the news of her
most recent financial debacle.
"Then I found out the tulips were
supposed to be 5.5 inches in the
ground instead of six," Michelle's
father was writing.
"Gotta be six for those,"
Michelle's uncle replied.
"Mom, Dad I maxed out 23 cred
it cards," Michelle broke in.
"That's not funny, dear"
Michelle's mother replied.
"Especially considering your past
behavior."
"Maybe not," Michelle respond
ed. "But, it's true."
"Folks, I think I have some
errands to run," her uncle said
before signing off.
"How ON EARTH did you
manage that?" Mr. Sayson yelled
through his computer.
"I don't know. The card compa
nies kept sending them, and they
kept working," Michelle said. "I fig
ured after a while they would just
recharge themselves or something
if I didn't use their, lor a while.
Then this guy from a collection
plitce called saying I owe $38,233.
"Oh my gosh," Mrs. Sayson typed.
"Oh my gosh ohmygoshohmy

"Honey, WILL YOU CALM
DOWN? Our little spendthrift just
has some returning to do."
'"Do restaurants give refunds"
Michelle asked.

"HOW C'OULI) YOU SPEND
THAT MUCH EATING?" Mr. Sayson
screamed after switching over to
voicechat to get his point across.
"YOU Ml ST WEIGH TEN T< )NS!"
"Everyone complains about the
food here," Michelle replied. "So I
took the dorm to Le Lapin Rouge
for dinner. Every night, actually. I
was just trying to make a good
impression. I wanted people to like
me. Since you don't ."
"My bahy darling's going to be
breaking rocks in some jail in
Texas. My little angel who used to
tug at my dress and say-"
"KATHY, WILL YOU LEAVE US
THE HELL ALONE?" Mr. Sayson
yelled. "Michelle, we're not giving
you a cent. You want to study your
stupid literature? Write a book
about this to pay off your debt, like
How I Ma.ml Out 2ii Credit Cants
or Diary of a Mown."
"Maybe I'll write about how
my father—my tyrannical, esteem
destroying, wearer- of-his-wife's
lingerie-when-he-thinks-he's-alone
father —drove me to it," Michelle
said. "That'd be a bestseller."
"My poor, penniless, doomed
pumpkin-" wept Mrs. Sayson.
"KATHY, DON'T MAKE ME
UNPLUG YOU," Mr Sayson
bellowed. "AS FOR YOU,
MICHELLE, CONSIDER YOUR
SELF DISOWNED"
"I'm going to start my book
right now," Michelle said, before
signing off.
Mr. Sayson left their eCircle a
few moments later, while Mrs.
