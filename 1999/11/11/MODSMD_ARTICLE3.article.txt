# Res Ed grievances go online
## 
### Alice Brown Editorial staff 
The Office of Residential Education is
planning to put a complete version of its
grievance procedure on the Web by the
end of this month to clarify the process.
According to Jane Camarillo. director
of Residential Education, students ex
pressed concern over the fact that they
didn't know exactly what happened after

they reported a viola
tion or if they were ac
cused of violating the
residence agreement.
Therefore, over the
summer Camarillo and
her colleagues "made
an effort to document
the process so that stu
dents would have a

sense not only of the process but of the ap
proach to adjudicating these cases," Ca
marillo said.
Within the next month, this procedure,
in addition to the full text of the residence
agreement, will be posted on the Res fd
Web site.
"Not only will having the grievance
procedure on the Web help clarify the
process to students, it will help [Res Ed] to
remain consistent in our response to mis
conduct across the system of on-campus
housing." said ( amarillo.
When students report a violation to Res
Ed. they often go first to their residence as
sistants for support.
"I am confident that our residents feel
comfortable approaching anyone on the
Larkin staff from the PHE to the RCC to
the UAA to the RAs and on up to the
RFs." said Dunagan Pearson, an RAin

Larkin. "That's what we're here for.and it
results in an open, safe, and fun environ
ment.
"Any issue that a resident doesn't feel
comfortable presenting to an RA would
probably go to the RF," he said, "and from
there to the residence dean and beyond."
Pearson added that "the existing sys
tem works really well on the whole."
When students meet with residence
deans, the deans gather information from
the reporter and then meet directly with
the subject of the complaint.
It is during this meeting that the resi
dence dean assesses whether or not the
complaint is a violation of the residence
agreement and if so what sanction will be
applied.
Complaints involving noise and room
mates are often handled by the resident
fellows in the dorm, while Res Ed deals
more with complaints about "alcohol mis
use, irreconcilable roommate conflicts
[and] disruptive individual behavior relat
ed to noise or vandalism." Camarillo said.
"It is important to note that these cases
are usually brought to us by people who
have already tried some intervention."
said Patricia Brandt, Row residence dean,
"'['hey are asking for our help because the
situation is difficult. We try to respond in a
caring manner and to coordinate Universi
ty resources to help them resolve their
dilemmas."
Though the procedure hasn't changed,
its new level of publicity may cause an in
crease in the number of students who re
port violations of the housing contract, ac
cording to Camarillo.
The most severe action that can be
taken when dealing with a student found
to be in violation of the residence agree

ment is ihe loss of University housing. The
housing contract is the only document the
residence deans take action to enforce.
Brandt said "two or three times a year 1
find it necessary to move a student to an
other residence or to revoke their hous
ing."
She remembers most of the cases in
which loss of housing was necessary:
"three |students] had assaulted other stu
dents. four had sexually harassed or as
saulted women students, two had flagrant
ly violated Stanford's substance abuse pol
icy (and] one sent a death threat.
"A handful of students were suffering
from mental health problems and became
disruptive or temporarily unable to care
for themselves," she said.
Aside from housing violations, students
can also report violations of the Funda
mental Standard. This hroad standard gov
erns the conduct of Stanford students; pos
sible violations of the fundamental stan
dard include sexual assault, forgery, physi
cal abuse, misuses of computer equipment
or e-mail, driving under the influence and
misrepresentation in seeking University
benefits such as housing or financial aid.
"Judicial Affairs and the Judicial C bar
ter are higher authorities that enforce the
Fundamental Standard," Camarillo said.
"Violations of the Fundamental Standard
can result in suspension from school, as
can violations of the I lonor Code. In egre
gious cases of violations of the Fundamen
tal Standard and the Honor Code, a de
gree could be revoked. These more serious
consequences are governed by the due
process outlined by the Judicial Charter."
In general, if a case is directly related to
housing. Judicial Affairs will leave the
handling of the case to Res Ed.
