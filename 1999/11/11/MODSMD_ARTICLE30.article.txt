Late last Friday night,
while working out a
rryptarithm for an upcoming
differential calculus exam,
Pamela Shmiegelson of
Excelsior Tech stumbled
upon the equation for sexual
intercourse. The next morn
ing Pamela related her dis
covery to her fellow Applied
Mathematics majors on the
study eCircle they all share.

"I ran a number-11-just for the heck of it," Pamela typed lo her
friends at 7:00 a.m., "and 20 minutes later Peter Jacobs, the
lacrosse captain whose take-home exams to Intro Algebra I
completed-and who disregarded my invitations to join me fora
milkshake in return-suddenly .ippeared in the door to the computer
lab. He was sleepy, reeked of cheap beer, and had a pepperoni
stuck in his hair, but he was all mine Needless to say, I didn t
study any more thai night."
"Shut up!" exclaimed Patricia Tinkler.
"What's the equation?" asked Alumni Kazool.
"I'll share it with you guys for $200," Puuela typed in return.
The five members pitched in and paid her the money, and after
running the equation, they experienced similar luck.
"I have them taking numbers outside my door," Ahmed typed at
the next meet ing. "I think I've made up for 21 years of celibacy in
one night!"
"It's distracting," wrote Suzanne McNidgen. "Whenever I have a
free moment I do the equation. And that works out to ail average
of 16.32 times a day. I think I'm going to single-handedly empty all
the 'Personal Centers' on campus."
The entire eCircle quickly formed a cartel, and made a pact not
to reveal the equation When it comes time to sell, they agreed to
give 50% of the profits to Pamela, since she discovered it.
"Oh, we'll make some money eventually by inviting others
into our eCircle," Pamela speculated. "But, let's ei\joy our little
monopoly while it lasts."
