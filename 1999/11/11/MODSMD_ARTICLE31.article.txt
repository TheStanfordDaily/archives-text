# eBillionaire Makes Fortune Off Toenail Clippings
## 
### 
In an eCircle called "How Did this All Happen?", newly-made Internet
billionaires meet each week on www.eCircles.com to share their amazing
stories of fortune come fast and furious. This week, it was Clarence
McClement's turn to share his incredible tale, while the other members
watched their screens empathetically. Clarence narrated the story to his
scribe from his Mediterranean island-country, Clarencia, located about
120 miles oIT the southern coast of Malta:
"Started collecting my toenail clippings when I was about five or so. I've
gathered them ever since, till one day my daughter comes into my trailer,
all ornery 'cause she's expecting for the millionth time, and catches me
clipping over my clipping bag, and starts screaming, Clarence, you sick
(I won't tell what word she used), no wonder no woman*ll have you, with
your disgusting ways, you get rid of those or I will. Now I don't want to
waste 65 years of healthy nail-growth, so I talked to my grandson who
knows this whole Internet deal, and I said Wade, help me. Well, he drew
up a little screen poster, with a line about how there was no end to the
nails' uses. .
"Before I knew it, my phone started ringing. But not from people wanting
to buy my product, but from these New York types calling me at every
hour, shouting tilings at me like how many hits am I getting, and when the
IPO was gonna be. I said I don't like getting hit and I didn't want rAne of
their IPO-whatever that may be. Angry, I yanked the phone out of the wall.
"The next evening, a moving truck parks in my field, and this bald
fellow wearing a suit and sun glasses gets out, opens the back of the truck,
and the thing is packed with hundreds. The man says it's mine if I sell my
Internet company he calls it, and he says just sign here, so I sign here, and
he pulls out this credit card, and talks to it. A helicopter shows up soon
after, and off he goes, nearly blowing my home away at the same time.
"So, that's the meat of it, at least."
Next week, Luella Winkerson tells his strange, but true tale of a fortune
made on the web from his used twine company and his "Piece of Twine
and You'll Be Fine" jingle.
