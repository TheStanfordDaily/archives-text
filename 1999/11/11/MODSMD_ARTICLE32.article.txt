# Corset Makes Return on College Campus
## 
### 
During a long discussion held
in their eCircle, a group of
sophomore women at Dullord
College recently decided to rein
troduce the Victorian custom of
wearing corsets.
"I'm just so sick of doing that
silly treadmill to stay thin," wrote
Margaret Thompkins.
"It makes me feel like a gerbil,"
replied Anne Perez.
"I'm taking a course in Victorian
culture," wrote Phyllis Lecter, "and
can't help thinking maybe they
weren't so wrong, spending their
time socializing, drinking tea, and
eating cakes, instead of getting all
sweaty and worn-out. They just
wore corsets. "
"They seem so constricting
though," wrote Linda
"Well, if I'm going to be con
stricted, I'd rather it be in a single
article of clothing, instead of in the
cafeteria three times a day and in
that P.0,-filled weight-room with
guys looking you over."
"I'm sure there are online places
where we can find some corsets,"
said Maria.
So, the group went ahead and
ordered some corsets from
Stiffl pperLip.com., which they
were able to link to from their
eCircle. When they met on their
eCircle a few weeks later, they
found they weren't unhappy with
their recent change of lifestyle.
"My French coutil feels kind of
kinky and comforting," Margaret
typed.
"1 find myself being more ele
gant and graceful," noted Phyllis.
"Also, I've been getting secretly
irked when guys don't kiss my
hand upon meeting me."
There was a pause, and then the
gn»up shared a collective 1011.
