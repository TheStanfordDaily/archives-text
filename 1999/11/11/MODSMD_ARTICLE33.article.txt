# eCollegeBid tries to ease burden
## Schools on site offer competing aid packages 
### Andrea Chen 
eCollcgehid.com. a Web site
launched on Sept. 21, attempts to
minimize the financial burden of tu
ition for students applying to col
lege.
Although founder Ted Kelly
touts the site as a help for middle-in
come families struggling to pay for
college, Stanford Dean of Admis
sions and Financial Aid Robert Kin
nally criticized the site's financial
focus.
More than a dozen colleges par
ticipate in eCollegebid. The service
matches how much a family can pay
for college with how much financial
aid each school is willing to give the
family. Students submit a bid with
basic information about areas of
study, activities and hobbies, pre
ferred geographic region, grades
and test scores. Students also state
how much tuition they can afford to
pay.
After students submit their appli
cations, colleges look at the stu
dents' profiles and see how well
matched prospective students are.
Though eCollegebid is a free ser
vice, applicants must still submit in
dividual college applications and ap
plication fees. Students must also
apply for federal aid.
Kelly has been involved with col
lege management consulting for 30
years. He came up with the idea for
eCollegebid after seeing that many
families simply cannot afford to pay
for college. He said he chose to put

his business online because he saw
the Web as the future of student re
cruitment and wanted something
that would help "get cost out of the
way first instead of last."
But Kinnally said he is concerned
about the site's focus on money and
feels it overemphasizes the financial
aspects of college admission.
"You shouldn't be bidding fora
college education." he said. "If stu
dents make decisions about college
on cost alone, then there's some
thing wrong. Cost should be the last
consideration. It doesn't reflect the
thoughtful process [applying to col
lege] should be."
Currently, eCollgebid's schools
are all small and moderately selec
tive. eCollegebid does not list the
names of its colleges because Kelly
is concerned that students will look
at the names of participating col
leges and dismiss the Web site based
on that information. He claims that
the site has been successful in terms
of matching students with colleges.
Some Stanford students say they
agree with Kinnally's views.
"It seems like [eCollegebid
doesn't| have enough information
to make a correct judgement [about
accepting students]," said freshman
Tammy Jih.
But others say they feel the site
could help students becomc more
familiar with lesser-known colleges.
"There are a lot of lesser-name
colleges that students would be well
suited for," said senior Carolyn
Goh. "It's a very different concept."
