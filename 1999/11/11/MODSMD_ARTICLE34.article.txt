# German writer lectures on nationalism

### T.J. Babbitt Editorial staff 
The swath of the globe from
Berkeley to Berlin is experiencing
the same trend of a rapid decline in

nationalist senti
ment and increas
ing individualism,
according to visit
ing Institute for
International
Studies Prof.
Josef Joffe.
Joffe gave a
talk last night

called "The New Paradigm: Nation-
States and Nationalism in the
Berlin-Berkeley World."
As a concession to his audience,
Joffe joked that he could also refer
to the region as the "Stanford-Stock
holm belt," but said he was in any
case referring to the United States
and Western Europe "up to the east
ern border of Germany."
According to Joffe, the main
cause of this dramatic shift has been
a shared realm of stability in the

"Berkeley-Berlin state,"a stability
with roots in the aftermath of World
War 11. The decades-long peace
caused a prolonged decline in na
tionalist sentiments, which had been
stoked early this century by the pres
sures of rapid social change and an
unstable international environment,
he said.
Joffe will be at Stanford until
early winter quarter. Then he will re
turn to Germany to become the pub
lisher-editor of Die Zeit, a weekly
paper popular with many members
of Germany's intellectual and politi
cal elite.
He has also been a contributing
editor to the international edition of
Time, the editorial page editor of
Germany's prestigious Suddeutsche
Zeitung and a contributing colum
nist for the New York Times.
Joffe began his talk by locating
the origins of militant modern na
tionalism in the French Revolution
and attempts by the French state to
universalize conscription and em
phasize the connection between citi
zens and the state as opposed to its

foreign enemies.
Aecording to Joffe, the particu
larly fervent forms of nationalism
that emerged in Europe and the
United States in the early 2()th cen
tury were due to the rapid urbaniza
tion. industrialization, technological
change and secularization that
wreaked havoc on established social
forms and a sense of fixed social sta
tus.
Nationalism returned a sense of
shared mission and fixed identity to
citizens, Joffe said.
Militant nationalism has special
appeal for weakened nations, ac
cording to Joffe. "Nationalism is the
one political good that is never used
up; [but global) prestige is scarce,"
he said.
Western Europe and the United
States began to migrate out of the
nationalist framework after World
War 11. according to Joffe, because
peace and prosperity made its fea
tures less attractive
"For the first time since the
demise of the Roman Empire, this
became an ultra-stable space," he

said. That made it less necessary for
the state to encourage people to
identify with it and rally against per-*
ceived external threats, he main
tained.
Joffe concluded his talk by exam
ining some of the social characteris
tics of the part of the globe between
Berkeley and Berlin, and the conse
quences of a declining identification
with the nation-state and groups in
general.
"Work is becoming individuated
and atomized — all the way down to
the home office or even no office,"
he said. "[And] politics is becoming
privatized," he added, pointing to
the growth of non-governmental or
ganizations and litigation as a means
for making policy.
Joffe will give two more talks dur
ing his time at Stanford. Displaying a
fondness for alliteration, he said his
next talk, on Jan. 13, will focus on the
still-prevalent nationalist sentiment
in the "Belgrade-Beijing world." His
final talk, on Jan. 18, will examine
what globalization means for both of
the blocks he has identified.
