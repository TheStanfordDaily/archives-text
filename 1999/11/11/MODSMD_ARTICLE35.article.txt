# Cardinal takes to the water
## Women swimmers face UBC at deGuerre tomorrow

Last weekend at the College
Cup in Vancouver, Canada, the
University of British Columbia
women's swim team finished 50.5
points behind Stanford's winning
score of 502.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING
■ Tomorrow: Stanford vs. British
Columbia, 1 p.m., deGuerre pool.

Ouch.
However, ÜBC did not go down
without a light. Jessica Deglau can
boast that she was only three
tenths of a second behind junior
Misty Hyman, the IWB NCAA
Swimmer of the Year, in the 200
freestyle.
And Anna Lydall can be proud
of the fact that she finished only
one second behind the "Outstand
ing Female Performer of the
Meet," senior Catherine 1 ox, in
the 50 free.
In all, ÜBC should be proud of
how they performed. They were,
after all, swimming against one of
the top swimming programs in the

United States.
Apparently, though. ÜBC is
hungry for more and unable to re
sist the invitation to travel to Stan
ford this weekend and compete
against the Cardinal in the squad's
home pool.
Thus, just two weeks later, ÜBC
and Stanford will be at it again.
Only this time, the Cardinal will
have the advantage. Not only are
the Stanford women back in their
own familiar pool — which is a nice
change from the awkward 25-
meter standard pool in Canada
they are also defenders of a home
meet record that dates back to
19S8: under head coach Richard
Quick's 12 years on the farm, the
Cardinal has lost only one dual
meet in deGuerre pool.
While this reality might be lin
gering in the minds of the women
swimming this Friday (as would be
any such accomplishment so wor
thy of defending), the team realizes
that this is only November, which
means the Cardinal has other
things to think about as well.
Hyman, for example, may be
thinking about how to improve her
speed in the 100-meter butterfly.

While Quick was pleased with
Hyman's performance in the KM)
fly in Vancouver, he knows she has
greater speed potential.
"I know she has speed. We have
been working on her endurance ca
pabilities, so her speed is good for
where we are in training," Quick
said.
Fox, on the other hand, may be
more interested to see how her re
cent incorporation of gymnastics
into her training regime will effect
her performance. For Fox, gym
nasties is another workout that she
tacks on to an already long sched
ule in hopes of swimming faster.
The meet this weekend will at
tend to both individual and team
aspects. Members of the team will
be practicing new aspects of train
ing.
Yet they will also be dealing
with the pressures and realities that
a team competition poses.
All of these aspects, although
seemingly small in themselves,
combine to create a finely-tuned
powerhouse team such as Stan
ford. which, weekend to weekend,
looks to capitalize on every meet to
improve its times and techniques.
