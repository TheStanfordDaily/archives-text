## 
### Peter Stair Contributing writer 
Voter turnout for the No\. 2
election at Stanford was once again
extremely low.
According to tentative data re
leased by the Santa Clara County
Registrar, only 7.2 percent of local
ly registered voters participated in
the election for the Palo Alto

school board and other issues.
Voter turnout is typically lower
in non-Presidential elections and
lowest in "ofl-years." during which
there are 110 national, state or even
county-level contests.
However, in the past. Stanford
turnout has been higher than na
tional averages for college campus
es. and Palo Alto voter turnout lias
been higher than national averages

for cities.
Senior Nikki Love. Stanford in
Government's Campus Awareness
Committee co-director, attributed
the low turnout for this election to
the comparative triviality of the is
sues and the lack of efforts to en
courage students and other resi
dents to vote.
"SIG provided some League of
Women Voters info on the local

races and issues." Love said, "but
for the most part, there wasn't
much lor Stanford residents to vote
for."
"I voted at 7:30 p.m. that day,"
she said, "and the men there said.
"Yav! Someone's here to vote!'
They said I was only the 30th per
son to show up."
Many Stanford students did not
even know there was an election.

"I heard no discussion about this
election mound campus. 1 don't
think anyone cared." said sopho
more Sridhar Dronavalli.
Elma Martinez of the county
voter registrar's office said she
hopes for much greater turnout in
next year's March primary and No
vember general election.
