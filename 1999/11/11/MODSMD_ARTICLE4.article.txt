# Election data reveal meager Stanford turnout
## 
### Peter Stair Contributing writer 
Voter turnout for the No\. 2
election at Stanford was once again
extremely low.
According to tentative data re
leased by the Santa Clara County
Registrar, only 7.2 percent of local
ly registered voters participated in
the election for the Palo Alto

school board and other issues.
Voter turnout is typically lower
in non-Presidential elections and
lowest in "ofl-years." during which
there are 110 national, state or even
county-level contests.
However, in the past. Stanford
turnout has been higher than na
tional averages for college campus
es. and Palo Alto voter turnout lias
been higher than national averages

for cities.
Senior Nikki Love. Stanford in
Government's Campus Awareness
Committee co-director, attributed
the low turnout for this election to
the comparative triviality of the is
sues and the lack of efforts to en
courage students and other resi
dents to vote.
"SIG provided some League of
Women Voters info on the local

races and issues." Love said, "but
for the most part, there wasn't
much lor Stanford residents to vote
for."
"I voted at 7:30 p.m. that day,"
she said, "and the men there said.
"Yav! Someone's here to vote!'
They said I was only the 30th per
son to show up."
Many Stanford students did not
even know there was an election.

"I heard no discussion about this
election mound campus. 1 don't
think anyone cared." said sopho
more Sridhar Dronavalli.
Elma Martinez of the county
voter registrar's office said she
hopes for much greater turnout in
next year's March primary and No
vember general election.
"We're going to be doing a lot
for these upcoming elections," she
said. "Palo Alto is a lender in so
many things, why can't we he a
leader in voting?"
SICi is focusing on March and
November as well, directing its ef
forts to voter registration.
"We were more excited about
using Election Day '99 to kick off
our efforts to get voters registered
for Election 2000," Love said.
"(Later) we will be making a hig
push for voter excitement."
These elections promise to at
tract far more voter interest. There
will he several state propositions on
the ballot, including the already
controversial Knight Initiative,
which would forbid recognition of
same-sex marriages in the state.
Also, as the California primary
is earlier than it has been in the

past, it is newly crucial for all po
tential Presidential nominees.
ASSU Undergraduate Senate
Chair Steven Aronowitz, a junior
and member of the Stanford De
mocrats, said, "We have already
started registering people, and are
planning a massive get-out-the
vote effort aimed at the Knight Ini
tiative. the Juvenile Justice Initia
tive and the primary."
Still, it may prove difficult to
motivate large numbers of Stan
ford residents to vote simply be
cause of the inconvenient timing of
the March and November 2000
elections, which occur around
exam time, and the busy schedules
of Stanford students.
"I didn't vote because I needed
to study for my [Economics)
midterm more than I wanted to re
search this year's election issues,"
Dronavalli said. " The opportunity
costs for me to take time to re
search and vote on the issues were
too great."
