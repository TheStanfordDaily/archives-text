## Stupid Record Company Tricks 
### 
We all understand that record companies are businesses. And as businesses,
they operate in a way to maximize profits and keep people coming back for
more. That's a given.
Still, record companies often do things that are just plain annoying. Playing with
fans of artists such as Elvis Presley and Jimi Hendrix, they reissue the same album half
a dozen times, with differing sound quality, liner notes, track listings or enhanced ma
terial. They fool buyers into believing an item is limited edition, even though said item
is sold in stores for years.
Every music fan and record critic has their industry pet peeves. Well, here are mine.

They are among the most common and the most frustrating.
Double-CDs that should be single. The Beatles' 1962-1966
(Red Album) compilation is a great disc for those just discov
ering the band. However, it currently retails for $35, a lot of
money for music that could have fit on one CD. Unfortunately
most record buyers don't realize what a ripoff it is until they put
the anemic two-disc set on the CD player and read the timer.
But the Beatles weren't the only band who got one for the
price of two. For years, Eric Clapton's masterpiece "Layla" (at
tributed to Derek and the Dominos) was issued on two CDs. A
couple of years ago — after most of the vinyl-replacers had
bought the two-CD set — they issued it on one disc. Those who
waited are glad they did.
R.E.M. pushed the greed envelope even further with the
"Automatic Box," a wonderful selection of an hour's worth of
rare tracks — spread out over four discs and priced at $50-60!

Single-CDs that should be double. Sometimes in their efforts to attract a mass au
dience fora greatest-hits collection, companies short-change a great artist. Spring
steen's "Greatest Hits" without "Rosalita," "Darkness on the Edge of Town," "I'm
On Fire," "Tunnel of Love" and "57 Channels (and Nothing On)?" Van Halen's
"Greatest Hits" without "You Really Got Me," "Drop Dead Legs," "Hot for
Teacher," "I'll Wait" and "Finish What Ya Started?" Who are they kidding? These
rockers deserved two discs to reveal their many transformations, or at least all their
hits.
Then again, Springsteen had not the standard two but four new tracks on his so
called "Greatest Hits." Most artists (Madonna, Jackson Browne, Billy Joel) put two
extra songs on their greatest hits so long-time fans will still buy even though they have
the rest. That's just pure greed. Making a quarter of your double-decade "Greatest
Hits" new material is just plain insulting.

Michael Jackson's Greatest Hits / New Album "HlStory" should have been sold as
two separate discs, as should have recent hits-and-rarities double-discs by indie-rock
pioneers the Pixies and the Replacements. But then everyone would have bought the
hits only, and they certainly wouldn't pay $35 for that.
Bonus tracks. We know by now that "hidden" tracks might find their way on albums
multiple ways, and they're seldom real surprises anymore, the way the one on Nir
vana's "Nevermind" was eight years back. Still, record companies seem to occasional
ly have trouble with them, pressing some albums that lack the tracks buyers thought
they were going to get. Hey, it was a bonus anyway, right ?
Extra tracks also come on and off discs in different ways. A

record is released. It's rereleased on CD. It's rerereleased re
mastered. It's rererereleased with extra tracks. It's rerererere
leased reremastered. And then for the next act, the bonus
tracks are stripped, and it's released in "original" form. Gee, I
thought I had the original form when I bought it the first time.
Fans of everyone from the Beach Boys to David Bowie have
been through that play.
Lately, a new trend has come into vogue: adding "bonus
tracks" to albums which just came out. CD buyers are used to
this occurring in overseas markets where artificially high prices
compel markets such as Japan's to slap on some additional B
sides; a few of these discs are snatched up by die-hard American
fans.
But lately, discs by Sheryl Crow, the Lemonheads and Six
pence None the Richer have each been reissued with the extra

hit that came after the album's initial release. A treat for those
who waited, but a pain for those who have the now-obsolete original issues. Fortu
nately, I'm not in either category.
There's more, but I could probably fill another column with it all. Suffice it to say
that while record companies should maximize income, dishonesty and exploitation are
never appreciated by the consumer.
The key is to pay attention and stop playing their game. Keep your records and
tapes if you think a CD might be reissued. Don't buy the latest Elvis or Hendrix "de
finitive" reissue. Note those companies that exploit, note those that don't and buy ap
propriately. If it's economic pressures that record companies understand, it's the
record buyer that can ultimately make the greatest statement.
