## KC & The Sunshine Band 25th Anniversary Collection 
### 
With disco hits such as "Get Down Tonight"
and "That's The Way (I Like It)," KC & The
Sunshine Band made their mark on pop cul
ture even after the "disco sucks" movement tried to wipe
all evidence of them off the face of the earth.
That was partially because you didn't have to dance
to enjoy the band's hits. "Get Down Tonight" served as
a party anthem and beer ad while "That's The Way (I
Like It)" served as a sports cheer and burger ad.

"(Shake, Shake, Shake)
Shake Your Booty" even
underscored a scene from
"The Simpsons," that veri-

table pillager of pop culture.
That's the extent to which most people know KC &
The Sunshine Band, but with Rhino's new "25th An
niversary Collection" you can have 114 minutes worth of
music from this '70s institution.
However, that quantity isn't nearly as grating as it

may sound. In spite of the impression their biggest hits
may have made, KC & The Sunshine Band is more funk
and R&B dance than disco. "Collection" takes them
from the early days of simple but catchy funk songs
("Sound Your Funky Horn") to the later period of pre-
Madonna dance music ("I Betcha Didn't Know That").
In between are disco hits ("Queen of Clubs"), R&B bal
lads ("Please Don't Go"), and capable covers ("It's The
Same Old Song"). It also includes Sunshine Band instru
mentals and KC solo material.
Overall, the two-disc set is surprisingly enjoyable.
The chronological ordering (with the exception of the
two big hits, placed at the beginning of the first disc)
makes their stylistic transition smooth. The liner notes
are of typically high Rhino standards; they tell the story
of how two white guys (Henry Wayne "KC" Casey and
Richard Finch) fell in love with black music and teamed
up with a multi-racial band to produce hit after hit. Fur
ther, the price of the set (under $20) is quite reasonable.

Still, most people won't need this much KC. The best
songs on this compilation are also found on the single
disc "The Best of KC & the Sunshine Band." Aside from
remixes and edits, most other songs can be found on
their two in-print albums (which, with bonus tracks, are
double their original lengths).
For those who really wanted what couldn't be found
on those three discs, Rhino could have made a single
disc rarities compilation instead of putting out a two-CD
set. Such a disc also might have included additional ver
sions of better-known songs, and the decent but unnec
essary '90s remixes that close this set.
But if you happen to know that one disc isn't enough
while getting the entire KC / Sunshine Band catalog
would be overkill, "25th Anniversary Collection" is de
signed with you in mind. It is an enjoyable compilation,
especially good for your next '70s throwback party.
