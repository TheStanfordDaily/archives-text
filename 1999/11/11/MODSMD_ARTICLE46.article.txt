# Les 						Rythmes Digitales
## Darkdance 
### 
Jacques Lu Cont has fooled us all. First he
left his native Britain and flaunted his
French passport to ride the wave of
French house music (Daft Punk, Cassius,
Stardust). Then he ditched standard house
and started reverting to funky Bambaataa
stvle breaks. His new album, "Darkdancer,"
conjures up the sounds of Electric Avenue
and Atomic Dog while managing to have a
futuristic feel.
More than anything else, though, Lu Cont

produces catchy
and cute dance
music. From the
first synth hit on
the first track.

this album delves into a flurry of fun and
funky electro-pop. Les Rythmes Digitales
straddles the musical crossroads of Daft Punk
and Axel F, managing to do it with style and
smoothness.
The best cuts on the album are also the
funkiest. "Dreamin' " is a groovy number
with a bassline any Casio keyboard player
would be proud of. "From: Disco To: Disco"
has a great squiggly melody with a disco

house drum track, atmospheric strings and
punctuating leads. "Hypnotise" starts out
with a typical house fade-in but transforms it
self into a Depeche Mode-influenced driving
track.
Vocals on the album mostly consist of re
peated lines ("Music makes you lose con
trol," "Rock your body," "You're just simply
dreamin'"). Lu Cont's only fault lies in his at
tempts to extend his songs to a more abstract
setting. Songs such as "Soft Machine" and
"About Funk" end up sounding like some of
the more forgettable songs in Beck's cata
logue.
"Darkdancer" is an album full of snippets
and analog sound goodies one would not ex
pect from a late '90s producer. The album, al
though not quite as bounceable overall as
Bassment Jaxx's "Remedy," is equally fun on
the home stereo and the dancefloor. And
that's what it's all about, isn't it? Maybe Lu
Cont is bringing back one of the tenets of the
'80s music scene: it's okay to just wanna have
fun.
