# Arto Lindsay
## Prize 
### 
I first encountered Arto Lindsay while
glancing at a music display featuring
"Noon Chill" a year ago. The cover, a
slightly blurry photo of Lindsay emerging
from water equipped with snorkle and
goggles, gave the indication: "indepen
dent rocker." He had to be doing some
thing out there, non-commercial, possibly
innovative!
So I listened to his records and found
out Lindsay's music is in the style of bossa
nova, quietlv melodic as it is rhythmic.

Wanting
some sort
of histo
ry. I first

turned to musicallv sawy friends for infor
mation. Hearing of his rather sordid punk
past, I researched further.
Arto Lindsay has been making music
since the days of No Wave with bands such
as D.N.A. and Ambitious Lovers. He's
worked with a slew of artists, from Laurie
Anderson toCaetano Veloso and Rvuichi
Sakamoto, collaborating with Brian Eno
and Yuka Honda of Cibo Matto on his lat
est releases. But who is Arto, and what is
his music?
Lindsay is an American who grew up in
Brazil — a wacky, improvisational gui
tarist and an unskilled musician that can't
play chords. As such, he makes music that
somehow captures an essence of sound
and musical style yet remains unfettered

by the boundaries of "genre." Arto Lind
say is not just another musician dishing up
bossa-nova on David Byrne's latest com
pilation.
The difference between the bossa-nova
music Lindsay makes and other "revivals"
(mambo / big-band / swing / latin: the
music being cranked out by Lou Bega. Biu
Bad Vood(X) Daddy and Ricky Martin) i
apparent on the album cover, so to speak
The sensuality of these musical genres is
obvious; gyrating hips are standard music
video fare for all of the above.
People that know. however, recognize
Lindsay's name. Not only has he been
around quite some time, but he's spent the
time making, dare 1 say it. innovative
records. Lindsay's latest solo release out m
the United States on Righteous Babe
Records is yet another album in line with
his latest style — a beautifully noisy mix ol
bossa-nova and pop. If he's not been in the
spotlight along with the others despite the
genre's popularity, it's due to his very orig
inality.
On "Prize," Arto Lindsay once again
captures the sophistication and beauty of
bossa-nova without merely re-hashing the
same "Girl From Ipanema" jazz. He takes
on the sounds of entire genres from the
range of Brazilian styles, producing some
thing new... and gloriously sensual.
