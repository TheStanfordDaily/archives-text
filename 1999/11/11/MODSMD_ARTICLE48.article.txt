# On the One with Robert Walter's 20th Congress
## 
### 
The Last Day Saloon was packed Saturday night as people came out to hear
Robert Walter's 20th Congress. People with long hair and beards crowded into
the front of the club, where the scent of marijuana hung heavily in the air. The
back of the club, meanwhile, was packed full of the more standard, slightly preppie, col
lege bar crowd.
20th Congress had the goods to please everyone, laying down tight, funky grooves
that had the entire club dancing into the wee hours of the morning. Once the music
started, it was near impossible to resist being drawn into the funk-jazz groove. Virtual
ly every song was upbeat and funky enough to keep the dancers going. Yet there were

enough rhythmic changes finely woven into the
songs to keep the music from ever getting boring or
repetitive.
The group interacted with near-perfect chemistry.
Bass player David Carano and drummer Aaron
Redfield locked together as one, forming the solid

bottom from which the music developed. Robert Walter, organ player of the "unoffi
cially" defunct Greyboy Allstars, layered his funky organ perfectly on top of them,
completing the magical rhythm.
The true highlight of the show was the fantastic playing of Cochema Juan Ciastel
lum, who primarily played the alto saxophone but also played the flute and various per
cussion instruments. Gastellum's playing was unique, melodic and powerful. Ranging
between playful funky melodies and raw emotional screams, every time he put the sax
ophone to his mouth something exciting was bound to come out.
1 only had two criticisms of the band. First, Gastellum often chose to use effect
processors to alter the tone of his saxophone. Nearly every time he did this, it detract
ed from what he was playing. He was able to produce a wide range of synthetic sounds,
none of which were as beautiful or as powerful as his natural saxophone tone.
Second, although bass player Carano was quite capable of holding down the bottom
line, his attempts at solos were for the most part complete failures. He took solos on
bass and guitar. His bass solos in particular felt awkward and unnatural, almost caus
ing the songs to stop dead in their tracks. Carano would often leave huge gaps in his
solos, giving the appearance that he had finished before beginning again. He did have
a couple of good moments on guitar, but overall his skill level seemed much below that
of the rest of the band.
During the break, the band sold copies of its demo EP, "Health and Fitness," which
is only available at concerts and on its Web page. It is a good representation of the
group, capturing the magic of its playing. At 25 minutes, however, it's no substitute for
seeing the group live. Still, it's an excellent EP and well worth having. Two of the songs
can be heard on the Web page, www.2othCongress.com, in addition to audio clips from

a few concerts.
Overall, the concert was a raging success. Robert Walter's 20th Congress is great at
turning their funk into fun for the audience and for each other. They return to San
Francisco in early December. When they do, I strongly recommend checking them out.
