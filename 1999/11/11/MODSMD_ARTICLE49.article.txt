## A
						game is a game is a game. Or maybe not. Madden 2000 
### 
The learning curve for "Madden 2(XX)" is
probably a little steep for first-time play
ers. On offense, the running plays are simple
enough; your quarterback will automatically
pitch the ball to your running back, which is a
godsend for anyone who has ever tried to time
a handoff in previous "Maddens."
The passing game can be frustrating,
though. Executing a pass is a three-button
process: hit "x" to snap the ball, hit "x" again
to identify the receivers and then tap a third
button to throw to the receiver of your choice.
It looks easy when spelled out, but while trying
to scramble I found myself trying to pass be
fore identifying receivers. By the time 1 real
ized I hadn't thrown the ball, the CPU's team
had quickly set me 10 yards back.
Speaking of defense, you can control the
action of a single defender if you want him to
commit to a flying tackle or jump to intercept
a pass.
Playcalling is the only other little stumbling
block. The instruction manual doesn't explain
how to call plays, and although it is made clear
by images of your buttons on-screen, it isn't
clear how to access the multitude of plays
available. The extra-point option seems to be
buried beneath lists of low-percentage plays,
for example, and to find it and snap the ball be
fore the playclock expires takes practice.
Graphically, "Madden 2K" is more than
decent. If you've seen those Cyber-Athlete
commercials featuring a digitized Barry
Sanders breaking through tackles, don't hold
your breath for Madden, but be satisfied by
the individual touches given to each player.
There seem to be only two models for
physique â€” short and skinny for the wide re
ceivers and big and burly for the linemen. Yet
all the players can be spotted by name and
number, and the stars do seem to have skills
above and beyond the role players.
"Madden 2K" also offers an instant-replay
function and plenty of camera angles for the
game, so you can suit it just to your liking.
The game truly impressed me with its
sound. EA Sports has all the necessities down:
a crowd that interacts with the action on the
field, accurate game sounds and informative
play-by-play and color commentary from the
sportcasters.
John Madden shares sportscasting duty
with an unnamed personality, but they both
do an excellent job. The mystery voice keeps
you informed on the down number, yardage,
game time and a few individual stats. He also
keeps all but the most obvious of opinions to
himself. If there are under 10 seconds to go on
the play clock, he'll politely suggest to the au
dience that you should get going.
Madden's color comments are pretty bone
headed: " That's the kind of hit where the guy
gets up, goes to the sideline and asks what day
it is!" "Madden 2K" has an Arcade mode that
doesn't feature Madden's voice but instead a
smarmy and nasty announcer who delights in
a team's mishaps. Save this mode for a grudge
match with your roommate.

Graphics
The players are physically
anonymous, but the run
ning and tackling anima
tions more than make up
for that. The crowd displays
banners appropriate to the
home stadium.
Rating: 8 (out of 10)
Sound
The brutal hits, whistles and
other sounds of the game
are all impressive and do
not interfere with game
play. The crowd is dynamic.
The three announcers all do
a great job, but some of
Madden's comments will
leave you puzzled.
Rating: 9
Control
Perfect. When running with
the ball, you have access to
spins, sidesteps and speed
boosts. On defense the dive
is your sole but most effec
tive option for tackling.
Rating: 10
Features
The Madden Challenge
gives the player rewards for
certain goals in a game,
such as passing 300 yards
against the computer. It un
locks options such as hall
of-fame teams and special
abilities. You can also play
the standard season and
playoffs mode if you want
to keep up with the NFL
season.
Rating: 10
Overall
"Madden 2K" is going to
come into competition pri
marily with Midway's of
fensive showcase, "Blitz
2000." However, the Ar
cade mode is a decent and
more involved alternative
to "Blitz," and the simula
tion mode maintains the
EA Sports / Madden tradi
tion. It's the best football
game out there.
