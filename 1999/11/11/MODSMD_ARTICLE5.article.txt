The July changeover of Stan
ford Bookstore management to
the Follett Corporation is bringing
lower prices and other changes, ac
cording to Bookstore staff.
Students should start to notice
the changes soon, said Jcf Friedel,
Bookstore marketing manager,
but some students have said they
want lower prices now.
Follett, the largest operator of
university bookstores in the coun
try with over 6(M) stores, has the
power to negotiate better prices for
the books it buys.
While under a non-profit board
of directors, the Stanford Book
store only had access to books they
had ordered for their own store.
Now, Friedel said, the Bookstore
has a nationwide "ocean of books
both new and used — to pull
from."
Beginning in January, he said
there will be a vast improvement in
ordering textbooks as well as more
used books on the shelves.
But students say they're still
waiting for lower prices.
"I think it's pretty much the
same," said senior Ray Ruffin. "It's
always been expensive."
Said sophomore Ellyn Ryschak,
"Sometimes they take advantage

of being the only place on campus
to buy textbooks and school sup
plies." •
"Educational institutions
should distance themselves from
corporations," second-year law
student Severa Keith said.
According to Friedel, Follett
kept almost all of the Bookstore's
previous employees. Friedel said
Follett wants it to be the same
Bookstore that students remem
ber, only with a few improvements.
Those other improvements are
on the way, Friedel said.
The new ownership has given
more freedom to the store's man
agement. he said. "When you don't
have any boundaries, you can clo a
lot of things you might not have
thought of before."
For example, the Bookstore is
responding to students such as
Ruschak. who doesn't "particular
ly like the Bookstore's clothing
line." On Friday, the Bookstore
will launch a new line of hip urban
clothing called FUBU with a fash
ion show.
Started by a hip-hop group of
the same name, FUBU is promot
ed by rapper L.L. Cool J and other
black musicians. Stanford's Black
