# Follett boasts new plans for Bookstore
##

The July changeover of Stan
ford Bookstore management to
the Follett Corporation is bringing
lower prices and other changes, ac
cording to Bookstore staff.
Students should start to notice
the changes soon, said Jcf Friedel,
Bookstore marketing manager,
but some students have said they
want lower prices now.
Follett, the largest operator of
university bookstores in the coun
try with over 6(M) stores, has the
power to negotiate better prices for
the books it buys.
While under a non-profit board
of directors, the Stanford Book
store only had access to books they
had ordered for their own store.
Now, Friedel said, the Bookstore
has a nationwide "ocean of books
both new and used — to pull
from."
Beginning in January, he said
there will be a vast improvement in
ordering textbooks as well as more
used books on the shelves.
But students say they're still
waiting for lower prices.
"I think it's pretty much the
same," said senior Ray Ruffin. "It's
always been expensive."
Said sophomore Ellyn Ryschak,
"Sometimes they take advantage

of being the only place on campus
to buy textbooks and school sup
plies." •
"Educational institutions
should distance themselves from
corporations," second-year law
student Severa Keith said.
According to Friedel, Follett
kept almost all of the Bookstore's
previous employees. Friedel said
Follett wants it to be the same
Bookstore that students remem
ber, only with a few improvements.
Those other improvements are
on the way, Friedel said.
The new ownership has given
more freedom to the store's man
agement. he said. "When you don't
have any boundaries, you can clo a
lot of things you might not have
thought of before."
For example, the Bookstore is
responding to students such as
Ruschak. who doesn't "particular
ly like the Bookstore's clothing
line." On Friday, the Bookstore
will launch a new line of hip urban
clothing called FUBU with a fash
ion show.
Started by a hip-hop group of
the same name, FUBU is promot
ed by rapper L.L. Cool J and other
black musicians. Stanford's Black
Community Service Center has
been promoting Friday's event.
Friedel said he even approached
members of the hip-hop group
FIJBU. asking them to put on aeon
cert at Stanford to promote their
product. FIJBU was unable to
come, but on Friday night from 5:30
to 7:(H) p.m.. local hip-hop groups
will perform in the Bookstore.
The store is also planning pilot
programs to test the feasibility of re
maining open later. But even if they
don't extend their hours, Friedel
said he wants to provide students
with campus-based activities on the
weekends.
"Unfortunately that means I'll
have to be here a lot of Friday
nights," he joked.
Friedel said he hopes to make
the Bookstore compensate in part
for the absence of a student center
on campus. I le said he envisions the

Bookstore hosting everything from
dating games to original poetry and
fiction readings by engineering stu
dents and others outside of the cre
ative writing program.
He is looking for input from stu
dents, he said.
According to Friedel, the retail
book industry has undergone a dra
matic change in the past two years
as it has gone online. The Book
store's total sales dropped 11 per
cent last year, which Friedel attrib
utes in part to online sales of trade
books.
Since the infusion of new man
agement. the Bookstore has joined
the "e-commerce revolution" by
updating its Website from an online
reservation system to a full-service
online bookstore, slated to com
mence operations on Dec. 1.
Although their textbook sales
are already up since the last fiscal
year, Friedel said going online
should increase their sale of trade
books, the main area in which sales

continue to fall. He said textbook
sales haven't been affected by on
line purchases because "by the time
you start comparing, the price of
textbooks online turns out to be
pretty even."
In June Follett President James
Baumann said the new manage
ment also planned to instigate new
services such as a "Buy 10 get one
free" program on non-academic
books, a faculty / staff sales discount
and a greater student access to used
books.
The change in ownership elimi
nated several top management po
sitions at the Bookstore. As it is now
part of a larger corporation, fewer
managers are needed at the store it
self.
Stanford Director of Business
Development Shelley Herbert said
the cost of paying upper-level man
agers is now spread over all h(H) Fol
lett stores. The reduced cost of over
head allows the Bookstore to pa\
Stanford more in rent.
