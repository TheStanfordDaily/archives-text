# Knockout Kings 2000
## 
### 
The only boxing experience 1 had before
playing "Knockout Kings 2000" was the old
arcade hits "Punch-Out" and "Title Fight.'
"Punch-Out" was a gem, featuring flashing cam
eras, charismatic opponents who fell under fa
miliar ethnic stereotypes and a big blue button
that said "Knockout Blow." When you had
Glass Joe or Pizza Pasta on the ropes, you knew
what to do.
Although those two arcade titles featured
silly boxing, they were cleverly designed and re
quired some degree of thought. "Punch-Out"
was played from a behind-the-boxer perspec
tive; your character was a translucent green grid
wearing gloves. This allowed you to see the
moves your opponents made and react to them.
In "Knockout Kings," the default view of the
boxers is from the side. EA Sports probably did
this because "Knockout Kings" is a two-player
game, but it forces the player to guess what his
opponent will do instead of relying on quick re
actions like you could in the older games.
Gameplay is the biggest problem in "Knock
out Kings." There are a variety of punches: you
can jab, hook and uppercut, and there's a conve
nient little flurry button that can devastate your
opponent. However, 1 found myself mashing on
the buttons to win after a short time.
If you try to operate via a prepared scheme
like the computer, you'll find yourself eating
punches and watching your stamina disappear.
Further, the defense is unrealistic. A boxer with
his hands up can absorb countless blows without
flinching or taking a drop in energy. I know the
professional boxers are tough, but these guys are
like stone.
The bright point about the graphics are the
faces of the boxers. Muhammad Ali is obviously
and rightfully the big draw of "Knockout Kings"
(he's pictured on the CD and the intro sequence
and is thrust forth as the first boxer to play as),
and he looks just like Muhammad Ali did 30
years ago.
"Knockout Kings" has some letdowns graph
ically. Some obvious bugs include flickering
fighters during the Slugfest option and punches
that go through the backs of figthers. In "Knock
out Kings," it seems that two objects can simul
taneously occupy the same space.
Another gripe I have is with the features. In
addition to the exhibition boxing mode, where
you duke it out with a fighter of your choice,
there are the Slugfest and Classic Matchup op
tions. These two are unnecessary, however. The
Slugfest is the height of button-mashing, no
brain-required gaming. The energy bars are re
moved, and the knockout is decided by one play
er landing more punches in less time than the
other (Hint: the most effective strategy is to set
your controller on a table and use your index fin
ger on each hand to repeatedly push buttons).
The Classic Match mode gives you a brief
rundown on the condition and drama of the up
coming fight, followed by the fight itself. But the
fight is just like the exhibition mode except you
don't get to choose your character or the arena
you fight in. Honestly, you could save 40 bucks
by watching the Classic Sports Network or rent
ing "When We Were Kings" from Blockbuster.

Graphics
Except for their faces, the
boxers look like cylinders
with lines drawn on them.
Honestly, when I saw a
video of George Foreman
(not playable in "Knockout
Kings"), I was afraid of
being hit. These guys look
cartoonish in a "simula
tion" game.
Rating: 6
Sound
The fighters don't make
any noise at all. The sound
of the punches is good, but
that's the extent of it. The
intro music is great, but it
gets you psyched up for
nothing.
Rating: 7
Control
The control is the sole
strong point of this game. If
your opponent doesn't turn
into a bubble so your fight
er's arm goes through him,
he will react according to
the direction and power of
the blow. Some fighters
move faster than others.
Rating: 8
Features
The Slugfest and Classic
Match features are just
pointless. You can create
your own boxer, assigning
different attributes to him,
but there are over 25 pros to
choose from, so it's easy to
find one you'll like.
Rating: 4
Overall
"Knockout Kings" was eas
ily the worst of the games I
reviewed. Coming back to
it after playing it initially
didn't help; the appeal just
doesn't last beyond a day.
