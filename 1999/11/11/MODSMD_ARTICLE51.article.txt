# Christopher Lucas reviews EA Sports 2000 line-up
## NHL 2000 
### 
One of the coolest things about "NHL
2000" is hearing the voice of Shirley
Manson from Garbage during some of the
game's menu sequences. It's unclear what
Garbage has to do with video-game hockey,
but for someone like me who's never watched
a hockey game, it's comforting to recognize at
least one name. Luckily for me, "NHL 2K"
Identifies the hot and cold players for each
team before the game, so you know who
should and should not be handling the puck.
"NHL 2K" is a fine game. I enjoyed juking
my human opponent with the array of spins,
crossovers and the Deke button, guaranteed
to leave your defender standing still while you
glide past him. For all the work you do, getting
one past the goalie is frustrating but immense
ly satisfying, just like real hockey.
The defense is granted plenty of maneu
vers as well. Just moving your defender onto
the man with the puck will usually force it
away from both of you. The Deke button for
offense becomes the Big Hit button on de
fense —it makes your defender lunge his
body into a full-commitment check. It will
leave both players on the ice and is the perfect
stopper fora breakaway.
I fell in love with the sounds of "NHL 2K."
The crashing of sticks and bodies on the glass
are amplified by a mysterious echo that char
acterizes a hockey arena. When a shot is fired,
everybody knows, causing me to appreciate
the power contained in a forward's swing even
if the sound is dramatized somewhat.
The announcer for hockey is the best of the
four games; he gets excited whenever a player
is alone and speeding toward the goal or when
someone takes a brutal hit. However, he and
the arena announcer pronounce some players'
names differently. Who's right? Only hard
core hockey fans know!
The game speed for "NHL 2K" is ad
justable, and you'll likely be slowing it down.
The default speed is blazingly fast and that
works against you. Often I was forced to pass
before my teammate got into position in order
to avoid swarming defenders.
The penalties and fighting frequencies are
also adjustable. Penalties are usually fair. I
knew when I cross-checked someone, but
sometimes it seemed like the slashing and
hooking penalties were called at random.
The fighting sequences are only slightly less
involved than those in "Knockout Kings."
There are two types of punches, a jab and an
uppercut. The players swing at unhuman
speed and one of them hits the deck while the
other celebrates to the cheers or boos of the
crowd. Winning a fight against a friend is just
as satisfying as scoring a goal.
Players also have an option of goalie con
trol by holding the select button while moving
the control pad. My advice is to trust the com
puter's goaltending. When I used the auto
goalie, the game scores were realistic, like 1-0
and 3-1. When I tried to control my goalkeep
er fora game, my roommate torched me for
seven goals.

Graphics
The players don't have as
much physical variety as
they do in Madden, which
wasn't much to begin with.
There also isn't much hap
pening off the ice —no
banners, no people distin
guishable in the crowd.

Sound
Unbelievable. From the
Garbage-backed intro se
quence to the blaring sound
of the horn after a score, the
sound effects and music will
keep you in the game.
"NHL 2K" also plays the
tail-ends of both "The Star-
Spangled Banner" and "O
Canada" at the start of most
games.
Rating: 10
Control
"NHL 2K" is most lun
when you are skating one
on one, but you must get the
puck out of a crowd of de
fenders in order to do that.
When a lot of players are"
gathered around the puck,
it can get confusing. Once
you get accustomed to
them, the Deke, Spin and
Big Hit moves provide
plenty of fun. Don't control
your goalie.

Features
Every NHL team, including
the expansion Atlanta
Thrashers, is in the game.
"NHL 2K" also features a
surprising variety of inter
national teams that will re
mind you that, like in bas
ketball, the North Ameri
can professional teams are
the best in the world.
Rating: 8
Overall
"NHL 2K" is a great game.
I wasn't sure about the ap
peal of hockey on the
Playstation, but the variety
of moves and plays avail
able show that hockey can
be just as satisfying as the
other sports.
