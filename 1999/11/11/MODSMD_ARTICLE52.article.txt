# NCAA 2000

EA Sports' entry into the college football
genre has minor problems and minor
successes that decorate an ultimately solid
game. First off, "NCAA2K" features every
division I-A college and even some division
11-A schools. But you know that with so many
people to keep track of it becomes impossible
to maintain individuality in players. Thus,
"NCAA2K" falls into the same trap "Mad
den 2K" fell into â€” there is little distinction
between players. This problem aside,
"NCAA" plays much like "Madden," with
college football touches.
The graphics are a dull point in
"NCAA2K." The players are grainier than
they are in "Madden," and the running ani
mation is funny. Every player has short legs,
and when you break away fora long gain, it
becomes evident that the ballcarrier is magi
cally covering a lot of ground with his baby
steps. The players are represented by number
but not by name. In fact, there are no names
in "NCAA2K" and no individual stars. The
teams themselves are stars, graded college
style in passing, defense and special teams
categories.
Game sounds in "NCAA2K" are very
good. This game separates itself from "Mad
den" largely in its sound. The cheering crowd
and pep band are characteristic of a college
football game. I don't think there are any dis
tinctions between the bands, however. The
LSJUMB as represented in the game sounds
just like every other band. Occasionally, the
crowd will scream a collective chant for de
fense. As always, the volume skyrockets
when the home team is in the red zone.
"NCAA2K" also features an interesting
franchise mode, where the football team's
staff will recruit players from high schools and
other colleges. The player can create his or
her own school and start from scratch to build
a dynasty. Apparently, your performance
during the season affects not only the
strength of your recruiting class but also that
of your recruiters and other coaches. I appre
ciate this feature because it adds a new di
mension to the typical full season mode avail
able in every sports game for every system
today.
The play selection is not as varied as in
"Madden2K," and it was somewhat disap
pointing that every school in the nation has
identical playbooks, but the selection and ex
ecution of plays is similar to "Madden:" frus
trating at first but enjoyable once you get the
hang of it.

Graphics
"NCAA2K" graphics are
sub-"Madden" but not sub
par. You'll wonder about
the stockiness of the play
ers, but it's really just the
concept of playing Stanford
colors versus Cal colors that
drives the game.

Sound
There really is nothing sur
prising after playing the
other sports games. The an
nouncer for "NCAA2K'
sounds like A1 Gore in the
booth. He never gets excit
ed like "Madden" or the
great hockey caller; he jusl
delivers the information
The high point here is the
pep band.
Rating: 8
Control
Not only does the game
look like "Madden," ii
plays like "Madden," too
Even the controls for spe
cial maneuvers are identi
cal.

Features
The franchise mode is inno
vative and will keep you
playing to see just how
dominant you can make
your team. Arcade mode is
close to the exhibition
mode except running backs
can bust through weak
tackles, and the passing per
centage is greatly increased
Rating: 10
Overall
"NCAA2K" is not as good
as "Madden2K," but it is
very close. It does hold ar
edge on "Madden" in that il
sports the impressive fran
chise mode, and it feels like
college football rather than
professional. "NCAA2K'
feels more lighthearted
like playing on a grassy field
on a sunny day rather than
in the Metrodome under
the transfixed eyes of tens
of thousands of die-hard
fans.
