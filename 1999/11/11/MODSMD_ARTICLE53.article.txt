The movie's outlandish, Crusade-like plot
harkens back six decades to "The Wizard of Oz."
Instead of Dorothy we have Bethany (Linda
Fiorentino), an abortion clinic worker who has
given up on her Catholic faith. When two fallen
angels named Bartleby (Ben Affleck) and Loki
(Matt Damon) threaten to unravel all existence
using a man-made loophole in Catholic doctrine,
Bethany is recruited by the Voice of God, Meta
tron (Alan Rickman), to go to New Jersey and
stop them.
Like Dorothy, Bethany is joined by a band of
strange characters during her quest. But unlike
the Tin Man or the Cowardly Lion, Bethany's

stragglers have extreme philosophical agendas — well, most of them, anyway.
Rufus (Chris Rock) is the unrecognized 13th apostle who was left out of the Bible
because he is black. Serendipity (Salma Hayek) is a Muse who gets no credit for her

to write movie screenplays on Earth. And New
Jersey Trilogy favorites Jay (Jason Mewes) and
Silent Bob (Smith) are misfit prophets whose pri

There are many hilarious moments in
"Dogma," such as when Cardinal Click (George
Carlin) introduces his Catholicism Wow! cam

as Carlin, Rickman and Rock are placed perfect
ly in this satire of the Christian faith.
Unfortunately, there are some visually
distracting elements to complain about.
Writer / director Smith and producer Scott
Mosier do a noticeably bad job of editing in
places, and some of the dialogue seems too weak
for the talent-brimming cast. Given the epic sub
ject material and the necessity for action se
quences and special effects, Smith and Mosier
could have used some experience on the set of a
James Bond movie.
It's hard to point fingers at the filmmak
ers, though, because Smith admits he is not a visu
al director and insists no one should take this
movie for anything more than a quirky comedy.
However, when you hear Rock, Hayek and
Damon making such good points about faith and
religion, you can't help but take things seriously
and expect more out of the movie.
So if you can take the religious stuff with
laugh, you should definitely be entertained by
