# Warren Miller's 'Fifty' deserves zero attention
## 
### 
It's really too bad that anything done 50 times gets at least a little
old. So it didn't really surprise me that 1 felt a little unfulfilled
after seeing Warren Miller's "Fifty." I haven't seen all 50 of
Miller's famous highlight-reel-style ski flicks, hut at $14 a ticket I
might have seen my last in a theater.
The yearly event of seeing glorious powder and death-defying
skiing serves as a cash cow for the snow-sport industry. Miller's films
are expert at making millions of consumers' mouths salivate to the
tune of Dave Matthews' Band tunes while plugging all sorts of re
sorts and equipment. The commercial aspect of the films has be-

come more readily apparent in recent
years — the sponsors have gotten
more obvious product placements out
of Miller, creeping even into his voice
over. The copy of Warren Miller's
"SnoWorld" magazine that comes with
the pricey ticket is fat with the appro
priate advertisements for the weekend
warrior, with its SUV's, ski equipment
and alcoholic beverages.

I'm not trying to say that Warren's 50th feature film isn't enjoy
able. I still oohed and ahhed with the rest of the crowd, and 1 was still
impressed with how crazy some snow-riders are. Still present are the
shots of skiers taking virgin runs on pristine mountains and of snow
hoarders catching huge air. Warren's understated humor and com
mentating punctuates the high-flying antics.
And the experience isn't without its highlights. "Fifty" starts in
the Chugach Mountain range in Alaska, which serves as an awe
some backdrop to some spectacular jumps. Warren also makes a
cameo appearance, taking a digger into a tree while quipping in the

voice over that "a career is a job you've had too long." Marilyn Monroe, Klaus Ober
meyer and Johnny Moseley also provide some star power for Miller's newest.
But I feel the magic slipping.
Miller has carved a niche for himself in the history of snow sports with his films. If

one of his movies doesn't make you itch for the slopes, you aren't a skier or boarder. It
may be wiser to rent one of the older ones — 1 recommend "Snowßiders2" — instead
of laying down the big bucks for this one.

Flashy aerial shots of skiers and snowboarders abound in "Fifty."
