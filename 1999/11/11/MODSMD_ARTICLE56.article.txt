# This 'Messenger 'of God comes empty-handed
## 
### 
Fifteenth-century France and Luc Besson's
biopic "The Messenger: The Story of Joan
of Arc" have one thing in common: the
only thing that can save them both is a miracle.
One soldier of Joan's (Milla Jovovich) oppo
sition tells her early on in this misguided cine
matic effort, "You're beautiful. Now let's see if
you're powerful." Indeed, there is no question
"The Messenger" is a beautiful film. Many of the
shots are lush. The screen is constantly filled to
the brim with intriguing visuals. But in the end it
all doesn't amount to much more than a whole
bunch of gruesome fighting.
Call it "Braveheart" without a heart. We
never get any tender moments to save us from
the endless violence. Perhaps violence is too nice
a term. If you've ever wanted to see several de
capitated heads or the involved process of flesh

burning, then by all means run to see this film.
However, if you tend to look for character, plot, sub
stance or any combination of the three, this could be one
you might want to miss.

In fact, bits
of the dia

implausible
they send
sections of

uproarious laughter. Lines such as "Well, that's what I
call booty" before a devastating rape scene or a soldier's
"Why won't she just go home?'* during an intense battle
scene rip us out of the moment. Andrew Birkin and Luc

Besson's script, to say the least, feels very awkward ex
pressing itself in English.
Perhaps the most offensive part about "The Messen
ger" is its flawed casting. As the devout Christian martyr,
Jovovich renders a credible, if not flat, performance. She
simply lacks a certain sense of piss-and-vinegar that
should be innate in Joan's fiesty character. She looks the
part, but with her hoarse voice, we never get a sense that
she actually feels the part.
John Malkovich stays in his own world — completely
apart from all other characters —as the conflicted
French King Charles VII. His unusual pattern of speech,
though it has worked marvelously in other period pieces
("Dangerous Liaisons") and more recently in "Being
John Malkovich," simply doesn't seem to fit into the
world of French royalty here.

Faye Dunaway is an absolute fright as Charles'
mother-in-law, Yolande D'Aragnon. Her cos
tume does not help either: the poor woman struts
around practically looking bald.
If you blink, you might even miss Dustin Hoff
man as Joan's conscience. Of his role, Hoffman is
quoted as having said, "The first time we talked,
Luc said he didn't want to send the script."
And it's not hard to see why. Appearing 30 min
utes from final credits, Hoffman's character is
one of the most interesting but least developed
aspects of the film.
"The Messenger" tends to work best when it
steps out of realism (like with the Conscience)
and into a less restrictive world. Dream se
quences add beauty and dimension to an other
wise bland viewing experience.
At two-and-a-half hours, "The Messenger"
overstays its welcome and soon turns into battle

overkill. Fight sequences could have easily been short
ened to half their length at no loss to the film. By the end,
we have become overwhelmed by symbols that Besson
force-feeds the audience. Ravens. Clouds. Bells. Crosses
and Christ imagery. Enough is enough already.
There is also the issue of accent incongruities. Why do
some French soldiers speak like they're actually from
France and others from Malibu? I could even forgive
Besson if this was his only problem, but with such a mess
as "The Messenger," it's not even an issue.
I just guess we come to expect more from the creator
of "La Femme Nikita." Maybe Besson needs to kick
some of the voices out of his head and get back to busi
ness before he's burned at the stake.
