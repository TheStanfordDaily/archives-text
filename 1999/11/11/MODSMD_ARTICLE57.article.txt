## Head for the hills with these 'Backroad' adventures 
### 
Too many of us here on Stanford campus have a restricted view of Northern Cal
ifornia. I know my perception of it has been limited to the campus and the two
nearby major cities. Excursions away from the city have generally been along
the road more traveled, fighting the crowds I was trying to get away from.
"Bay Area Backroads," by Doug McConnell, presents an interesting alternative
that opens up some possibilities. He suggests exploring California's less-traveled paths.
McConnell views Northern California as something special. He says,"I had seen won-

ders all over the world but had found no place more
blessed than this." The book presents detailed descrip
tions of 50 possible excursions throughout Northern Cal
ifornia, all based upon the idea of using backroads.
McConnell describes the backroads as perfect for
those with time, patience and a desire to be surprised.
"They are the right roads for people who don't know

what to expect around the next bend but want to find out" — for people who under
stand that "getting there is as good as being there."
The book was developed from the television show of the same name. "Bay Area
Backroads" is considered to be the Bay Area's most popular local television show. For
almost 15 years, McConnell and his colleagues have been exploring the backroads of

California and broadcasting their discoveries on KRON and BayTV.
The book can't be read like a novel, but it isn't intended to be. Rather, each chapter
paints a unique, distinct picture of a lesser known part of California. McConnell de
scribes the area with such vivid detail that when seeing the beautiful photographs of
each chapter they almost seem familiar, as if the reader had already seen them.
He also tells the story associated with each area, whether it be history or folklore.
He introduces local residents as "those distinctive and unusual people out there who
are passionate about where they live." He lets the reader see the area through the eyes
of people who have chosen to make it their home.
"Bay Area Backroads" is a well-written book that would be interesting reading both
for people who are motivated to travel and unmotivated enough to get on the road
themselves. For those who are looking to travel, it presents some interesting alterna
tives to the standard routes that deserve some serious exploration. For those who are
not, this book allows them to feel as if they have actually explored all of Northern Cal
ifornia themselves in the safety and comfort of their own homes.
For everyone, though, it should serve as an announcement that there is more to
Northern California than can be seen from the well-beaten path.
