## Little 'Desire' to recommend this play 
### 
Imagine a farm in the backwoods of New England. An elm tree
towers high above you, its huge smooth trunk to your left. Scan
ning across the hills of soil to your right, you see golden bales of
hay, stacked as high as you can see.
Upon entering the San Jose Repertory Theatre, you are immersed
in this scene. The theatre does a marvelous job of creating a realistic

-looking farm that casts its spell over
anyone who enters it.
As the lights dim, crickets begin
chirping. Suddenly the mournful
wail of a violin pierces the near si
lence. and the ghostly silhouette of a
lone violinist appears.
With such a powerful spell cast,
my expectations of the play are sky
high. Unfortunately, it is unable to

live up to those expectations.
"Desire Under the Elms" is Eugene O'Neill's attempt to superim
pose a Greek drama upon the lives of early 19th-century farmers.
Ephraim has been away from his farm for two months. By the time he
returns, his two older sons have decided to leave the farm and seek
their fortune in California, while his youngest, Eben, is trying to find
a way to reclaim the farm he claims that Ephraim "stole" from his
mother.
Ephraim has brought a new wife home. Abbie is young and pret
ty, but she essentially only cares about his farm. This causes conflict
with Eben, who also wants to own the land.

After much deception and trickery, Ahbie and Eben fail in love and have a child.
Given the circumstances, it is inevitable that there will be problems with their relation
ship. Eventually, the two are forced to decide how much they are willing to sacrifice for
their love. The ending feels like a particularly melodramatic soap opera, getting more
ridiculous the farther it goes.
The play does have some great moments. Gerry Bamman's portrayal of Ephraim is,
for the most part, quite convincing. During one scene, Ephraim handles his bad fortune
by convincing himself that it is God's will. I found myself sympathizing with his char
acter during this scene.
The problem is that as a whole, the play doesn't hold together. The touching scenes
are in the minority and are overshadowed by the rest of the play. The characters seem
to change moods without warning and in a highly dramatic manner. I found myself
laughing during some serious scenes and rolling my eyes at others. Definitely not a
good sign.
Some scenes just seem silly. For example, after seducing Eben, Abbie tells him to
meet her in the other room. She then begins digging in the dirt, unearthing a large white
love seat. Abbie and Eben proceed to make love on the sofa, which simply seems dumb

rather than symbolic.
It also seems ridiculous how seriously everyone takes the idea of Eben's mother's
ghost, who is haunting the farm. When Eben threatens to tel! his mother to curse Abbie,
Abbie is horrified. When Abbie and Eben are sitting on the love seat, they both "feel"
the ghost wants them to make love.
At first, I convinced myself that the characters' accents were okay. But once the
character of Abbie enters, all believability vanishes. With her accent ranging between
Latino, Jamaica and a really bad Southerner. I had a very difficult time taking her seri
ously.
Despite the magnificent set, San Jose Repertory Theatre's "Desire Under the
Elms" ultimately fails as a play. When watching a good play, you are drawn in and the
scenes in front of you become real. The actors are their characters, and fora brief mo
ment, even though a part of you knows better, their world is real. "Desire Under the
Elms" is an inconsistent play with acting that keeps reminding you that despite ap
pearances, it is only a play.
