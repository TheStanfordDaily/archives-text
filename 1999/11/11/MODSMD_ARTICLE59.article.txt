£ r ■ ihe Years," a three-act play by award-winning
playwright Cindy Lou Johnson, premiered off-
JL Broadway and won the Public Choice Award
for Most Popular Play in Montreal. Now, "The Years" is

Berkeley cast members under the direction of Maya

The plot involves a
16-year time span during
which the principal char
acters, mostly extended
family members strug
gling with the everyday
hardships of life, discuss
their difficulties. One

might describe "The Years" as a play about the ever-elu
sive meaning of life, but the clever discourse of the char
acters, in addition to the somewhat absurdist delivery of
the themes, make it more than just predictable rehash
and rhetoric.
Andrea, a young woman portrayed by Amanda
Cobb, gets robbed on her wedding day by the entrepre
neur Bartholomew, annoyingly acted by Charles Boyle.
These two characters seem to be the focus of "The
Years," as this opening interaction becomes the setup
point fora coincidental meeting 13 years later in the sec

ond act and again three years after that in the third act.
Apparently, bad things always happen to Andrea,
whose mother committed suicide by jumping off of the
Golden Gate Bridge. Her marriage ends when her hus
band leaves her, and she is later attacked by a drunkard
on New Year's Eve.
This leads to a plot shift in Act Two, when
Bartholomew is conveniently walking by to see the at
tack take place. He saves her, and neither recognizes the
other from his robbery of her 13 years prior. During this
time, Bartholomew has used the money he stole from
Andrea to become a successful, suit-and-tie business
man.
Bartholomew suffers a major turning point when he
realizes Andrea is the woman he robbed long ago. This
causes the eventual breakdown of his life's successes he
has built up during the past 13 years. When the two meet
again in a graveyard 16 years after their first encounter,
the play climaxes in a one-on-one discussion about the
choices one makes in life and their subsequent effects.
Overall, "The Years" succeeds in delivering its life-af
firming themes that point out how life can often be mis
erable. In the midst of such misery, however, are the lit
tle things that truly matter to us as individuals. People af
fect people, albeit sometimes unintentionally or imper
ceptibly, yet this is the impetus that allows us to keep try
ing despite the pains of seeming directionlessness and ul

timate loss.
Interestingly enough, it is the cleverly interspersed
side plots involving the secondary characters — An
drea's sister and two cousins — and the many difficulties
they are having in their respective lives that mark the
play as a cut above typical college-produced theater. An
drea's sister, Eloise (Margaret Valeriano), and Andrea's
cousins Isabella and Andrew (Jana Chavez and Keith
Anthony) deliver sharp performances ranging from the
emotionally distraught to the cleanliness-obsessed to the
artistically confused.
Anthony's portrayal of Andrew is particularly engag
ing as a young man trying to capture the intricacies of life
on film while lamenting on the futility of living due to the
eventual destruction of the sun. In comparison, Cobb's
Andrea seems relatively stagnant, and Boyle's
Bartholomew comes off as overdone and a bit forced.
Furthermore, while the frequent coincidental meet
ings are necessary for the plot, they begin to feel exces
sively contrived toward the end of the second act..
Despite these minor annoyances. Roth's direction is
solid, and Cindy Lou Johnson's writing contains enough
wit and emotional resonance to make "The Years" a de
cidedly entertaining night out if you happen to be on the
other side of the Bay.
