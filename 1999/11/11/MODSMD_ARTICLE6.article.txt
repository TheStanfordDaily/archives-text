# Warming to the challenge
## Prof. discusses dangers, costs of global warming 
### Asta So 
What is global warming and what
needs to be done to stop it? This is
what Eban Goodstein, professor of
economics at Lewis and Clark Col
lege in Portland. Ore., discussed yes
terday in a lecture entitled, "Global
Warming: Can We Afford to Stop
It?"
Goodstein has been traveling to
college campuses since January to
educate college students and alumni
on global warming.
"Global warming is the biggest
environmental challenge that we will
have to deal with in the 21st centu
ry," Goodstein said.
In his lecture, Goodstein focused
on the effects of global warming and
the importance of finding solutions
to stop it.
According to Goodstein, "The 10
hottest years on record occurred in
the last 15 years."
Goodstein described two scenar
ios that could result from global
warming. The first, dubbed "No Sur
prises." could result in a rise in tem
perature between 1.5 and 6.5 degrees

Eban Goodstein, economics professor at Lewis and Clark College,
spoke on the dangers of greenhouse gases and possible conse
quences of global warming yesterday.
Fahrenheit in the next century.
The second scenario, the "Run
away Greenhouse Effect," is a grad
ual rise in temperature that would
cause "a dramatic and sudden shift in
the planetary climate-control sys
tem."
Either scenario could result in
great harm to ecosystems, including
further melting of glaciers and the
disappearance of island nations due
to a rise in sea levels.
Goodstein said with the increase
of global warming, there is an in
crease in the number and severity of
natural disasters. He referred to re
cent devastating natural disasters
such as Hurricane Mitch and Hurri
cane Flovd.

"In 1998, the world spent a record
$89 billion on weather-related disas
ters," he said.
Addressing the issue of how to
stop global warming, Goodstein dis
cussed the Kyoto Global Warming
Treaty, which the United States and
other industrial countries signed in
1997. The treaty requires industrial
countries to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions to 7 percent below 1990
levels by approximately 2010.
The U.S. Senate has not yet rati
fied the treaty. According to Good
stein, reluctance to pass this treaty is
due to the possibility that it will be ex
pensive to meet the requirements of
the treaty and the possibility that
there will be major job losses result
ing from layoffs, especially in the fos
sil-fuel industry.
Goodstein refuted these reasons,
referring to economic models by the

Environmental Protection Agency
showing the Kyoto Global Warming
Treaty would have little effect on en
ergy prices and the economy.
In addition, he predicted that "a
few thousand" jobs a year will be lost
due to the treaty, a much smaller
number than others predict. Refer
ring to the 1990 Clean Air Act
Amendments, (ioodstein said that
from 1990 to 1997, 7,0(K) jobs were
lost due to the act. In comparison, in
that same time period, 10 million
workers were laid off for non-envi
ronmental reasons.
Goodstein has been working for
the ratification of the Kyoto Treaty,
helping students in Kyoto Now, an
organization that promotes the
treaty's ratification. In addition, he
has published "The Trade-Off
Myth," a book in which he argues
that "there really is no trade-off be

tween jobs and the environment."
Goodstein concluded his lecture
by addressing the issue of what stu
dents can do to stop global warming.
He encouraged the audience to be
come politically involved.
In addition, Goodstein encour
aged students to join campus groups
such as the Stanford Association for
Ratification of Kyoto.
Reflecting on Goodstein's lecture,
Lawrence Garwin, Class of 1987,
said, "I found the lecture very inter
esting. It was brief and succinct, de
scribing problems we face with global
warming and the proposed solutions.
"I found him to be really motivat
ing and to point some directions for
us to pursue this matter."
In addition to his post at Lewis and
Clark, Goodstein is a research associ
ate at the Economic Policy Institute
in Washington. D.C.
