finally able to get his
thoughts concerning
the highly controversial
subject on paper with
his stunningly powerful
play, "The Trial of
God."
Set in the Ukrain
ian village of Sham
gorod in the mid-17th

century (though the time becomes deliberately am
biguous and anachronistic in the end), the play takes
place entirely in Berish's tavern, where three traveling
minstrels attempt to skirt their hefty bar tab. The night
is Purim eve, a Jewish holiday celebrating the Queen

Esther, for which Jews were to drink "until they could
no longer distinguish between good and evil."
As Berish becomes increasingly more impatient
with his increasingly more intoxicated customers, the
minstrels finally attempt to pay the Innkeeper with a
Purimschpiel — a play, performance or debate held in
conjunction with the holiday.
Berish scoffs at both the minstrels and the holiday as
well as the idea of retaining any faith in God, after a
pogrom the previous year effectively reduced the Jew
ish community in Shamgorod to himself and his se
verely traumatized daughter, Hannah.
The only play-acting Berish will agree to is that of a
mock trial with God himself as the defendant for
crimes against humanity. This materializes after a
lengthy debate between Berish and one of the most in
triguing and well-acted characters, Mendel, the eldest
minstrel. *
T he last of the minstrels to speak, Mendel is an odd
mix as an unwavering optimist and harborer of a secret
ominous past. Mendel's constant refrain of "And God

in all this?," combined with his insistance to know
rather than merely imagine, eventually spurns the
grand Trial. However, before the Trial can proceed, a
defense attorney must be found ...
Be forewarned, there's a reason there are two inter
missions: the play is exasperatingly long, clocking in at
around three hours. Despite the need for editing and
the occasional distracting subplot, the acting is consis
tently excellent and engaging.
The play is a true philosophical and emotional tour
de force, offering — if not answers — intelligent dis
course on an endlessly controversial subject: Is God ac
countable for the sins of his creation? Definitely don't
miss the ending, when an abrupt change in tone occurs
to completely alter the message of the entire play.
"Trial of God" is produced by the Custom Made
Theater Company, whose quite friendly executive di
rector, Leah Abrams, also plays the role of Avremel,
one of the traveling minstrels, and does a lovely job.
