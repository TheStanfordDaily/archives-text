# Drama department opens show-stopping 'Arcadia'
## 
### 
Imagine yourself zooming back in history, only to land in the midst of chaotic
anachronisms. Time and space shift constantly, and faces and places whirl around
faster and faster until they seem to gel into something of remarkable beauty.
Smile! You're in a Tom Stoppard script.
Stoppard, the British playwright with distinctive and intricate plots, rocketed to a
new pinnacle of fame last year when his script for "Shakespeare in Love" won an Acad-

Arcadia

emy Award, among other accolades. He is also
known for such works as "Indian Ink," "The Real
Thing" and "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are
Dead," but this weekend, the Drama Department
showcases one of his best-loved plays, "Arcadia."
"Arcadia," also the orientation-week reading as
signed to the class of 2(X)3, concerns the interweav-

ing of a precocious 13-year-old, her wily tutor, a "carnal embrace" in a garden gazebo
and the hapless resident poet Ezra Chater.
Enter the same drawing room 1(X) years later, as two scholars — one literary, one of
garden history —d are at each other's throats over apparent evidence that the poet
Lord Byron killed Chater.
The play dances'elegantly between the two scenes, slowly building the relationships
between the 19th-century characters and their present-day counterparts. Moving
through hilarious twists and turns, the answer to the Byron puzzle is resolved.
As improbable as it may seem, the crucial elements of "Arcadia" include: chaos the
ory and fractals, the steam engine, the second l?w of thermodynamics, Isaac Newton,
Fermat's Last Theorem, the Fibonacci sequence, the waltz, dueling, tortoises and the
history of the English garden.
"Arcadia" is doing multiple duty this quarter as a workshop course in the Drama
Department and as the senior project of three drama majors. Those three are Elizabeth
Martin, the assistant director playing the garden expert Hannah; production manager
Jennifer Gadda; and lighting designer Alice Louise Dickinson. Zack, the workshop in

structor and a doctoral drama student, is directing.
The workshop focuses on an academic discussion of "Arcadia" and other Stoppard
plays, while actual rehearsals take place outside of class.
After intense competition, a cast was selected at the beginning of this quarter. Those
not selected for acting roles were invited to assist with other aspects of the production.

As improbable as it may seem, the crucial elements of
"Arcadia" include: chaos theory and fractals, the steam
engine, the second law of thermodynamics, Isaac Newton,
Fermafs Last Theorem, the Fibonacci sequence, the waltz,
dueling, tortoises and the history of the English garden.

Other cast members include Art Schram as Bernard Nightingale, Maggie Siska as
Thomasina Coverly, Shachar Link as Septimus Hodge, Jon Stockdale as Chater, Justin
Moore as Valentine Coverly, Kim Dienes as Lady Croom, Andy Simpson as Capt.
Brice, Nik Charov as Noakes, Daniel Donovan as Gus / Augustus, Jon Nichols as Jella
by and Laura Bailey as Chloe Coverly.
Schram commented, "The period costumes are fetching, the script is fantastic, the
director fashion-conscious and the acting entirely serviceable. All in all, it's an enter
taining package that isn't to be missed."
Though Tom Stoppard will not be speaking at Stanford until Jan. 10, his "Arcadia"
production is playing tonight, Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. in Little Theater, next to
Memorial Auditorium. Due to anticipated sellouts, a matinee has been added on Sat
urday at 2 p.m.
