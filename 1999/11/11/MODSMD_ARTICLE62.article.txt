## Fire When Ready: CONQUERING PREMATURE EJACULATION 
### Roxy Sass Staff writer 
Men and women have oddly mis
matched sexual problems. Whereas most
women must learn to become orgasmic,
their partners struggle to delay climax.
Premature ejaculation is the most
common male sexual disorder, affecting
approximately one-third of American
men. Because youth, stress and absti
nence predispose men to this problem,
Stanford men are particularly at risk.
Like most sexual issues, premature
ejaculation defies concrete definition.
The condition reflects a lack of control,
not a short duration of penile thrusting. A
man ejaculates prematurely when he
comes before he or his partner so desires.
This problem is psychological, not
physical. Many men learn this behavior at
an early age when sexual activities are
furtive. Masturbating in the family bath
room and making out in the back seat of a
car teach efficiency, not style.
Fortunately, HO to 90 percent of pre
mature ejaculators can learn to control
this reflex by increasing self-knowledge,
attention and skill.
A great cause of premature ejacula
tion is stress and anxiety, particularly per
formance anxiety. So relax. Recognize
that most men come within two minutes
of penetration, so you cannot be too far
below the norm. Only in pornographic
movies do men have hours of sustained
sex.
Such movies are generally reenact
ments of male fantasies. Most women get
sore vaginas from long periods of thrust
ing, and besides, only a minority of
women can have vaginal orgasms. If you
dote on her clitoris, you can give her a
good time regardless of your trigger
speed.
Premature ejaculation is only a prob
lem when your fast ejaculation distresses
you or your partner. If you ejaculate
quickly but have great sex, you don't have
a problem.
If you know you're a quickie, devote
greater attention to the non-orgasmic as
pects of the sexual experience. Engage in
extensive foreplay and take time to enjoy
being with your partner. You have a lot of
body mass outside your genital region.
Discover the pleasures of stimulating
your other erogenous zones.
You can avoid leaving your partner
sexually frustrated by focusing on her
needs. Manually or orally bring her to cli
max before entering her. If she can have
vaginal orgasms, bring her to the brink
and then venture inside. When you come
first, don't roll over and go to sleep —
continue stimulating her until she is satis
fied.
However, sustaining your erection
may improve your confidence and inten

sify your orgasms. If you decide that you
want greater endurance, there are several
options you can try.
One of the most successful methods is
the start-stop exercise, which can be done
alone or with an understanding partner.
Basically, you stimulate your penis until
you near orgasm. Then you stop until
your arousal begins to subside. Resume
stimulation and stop again when neces
sary. Try to last for 15 minutes without
reaching orgasm. Of course, you may
achieve orgasm at the end of the exercise.
This exercise helps you identify your
point of inevitability. When your prostate
gland and seminal vesicles contract, you
feel that you are starting to come. How
ever, once these contractions begin, noth
ing can stop your orgasm. So you actually
want to pause well before this point.
Once you can last 15 minutes, try post
poning your stops by adjusting stimula
tion. Slow down. Alter the length and
pressure of your stroke. Take deep
breaths and relax the muscles in your
pelvic region. Later, you can transfer
these variations to real sex.
Another common technique is the
squeeze method, which resembles the
start-stop technique except that when
you approach orgasm, you gently squeeze
the penis with one or two fingers on the
underside ridge of the penis. This should
eliminate the urge to ejaculate, allowing
you to continue stimulation.
Distraction is one of the most wide
spread and least effective strategies. The
man does long division, recites baseball
stats or conjures up images of Great Aunt
Bertha to decrease arousal. Not only does
this detract from the overall sexual expe
rience, it prevents a man from under
standing his sexual reflexes and gaining
control in a more constructive way.
Some men find that if they masturbate
before having sex, their next ejaculation
takes longer. Others use a desensitizing
cream or wear multiple condoms to in
crease the amount of stimulation needed
to induce an orgasm. This generally
works, but it also partially numbs the
penis, possibly decreasing sexual enjoy
ment.
Antianxiety drugs and antidepres
sants such as Prozac may counteract pre
mature ejaculation, but their side effects
often overweigh their benefits. They can
be addictive, could completely deaden
the orgasmic reflex and may cause an
overall drop in libido.
'Hie exercises are probably your best
bet, though they may take several weeks
of regular practice to perfect. But don't
lose hope. Premature ejaculation is not a
problem with your penis — it's a problem
with your relationship to your penis. Sim
ply put, you must become the master of
your penis; only then can you consistent-"
ly control its behavior.
