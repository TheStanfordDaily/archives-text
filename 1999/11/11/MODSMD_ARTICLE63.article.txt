# PALO ALTO SOL – IT'S MUY BUENISSIMO!
## 
### 
Introducing your food reviewers:
Hi, my name's Shirley, Shirley Palma. I'm of Mexican descent. I grew up eating food
my Mexican family and friends made, in fact eating that very Mexican food with those
very Mexican folks.
Hi, my name's Wendy. Wendy Yao. 1 am not Mexican. I don't know what it means to
be authentic. But what I do know is that Shirley w Mexican, so whatever she says goes
with me too. j Que lastima!
Talk of cultural authenticity isn't very helpful when it comes to rating food — it'll
never make it any clearer whether or not the stuff tastes good.
Take the unfortunate defamation of the burrito; since burritos are an American
fabrication, they are almost necessarily deemed inauthentic. But that's super-mean.

Palo Alto Sol
408 California Ave.
Palo Alto
328-8840
Mon.-Sat.
Lunch 11 a.m.-2 p.m.
Dinner 5-9 p.m.

It's not like burritos are then necessarily worthless! Poor
little burrito, Wendy and Shirley still love you ...
However, authenticity does lend a little pizazz to the
food. You know, a bit 0f... yes, authenticity. It at least
gives the right of identity to the food — a right to that Mex
ican name — and it lets us know what to expect when we
walk into a place like Palo Alto Sol.
And as always, we know what we don't want from the
Mexican restaurant experience; here is an example of bad

Mexican food reality taken from a recent hit film called "Romy and Michelle's High
School Reunion:"
Michelle: I have the yuckiest taste in my mouth from those taquitos.
Romy: Ew.
Michelle: 1 hope I don't get indigestion. Hey, 'member that time I barfed from bad
Mexican food? It was so gross.
Romy: Oh my god! 1 hate throwing up in public.
Michelle: Me too! Uhn.
So. perhaps we were a bit cynical walking into the restaurant. But why wouldn't
we be? While Palo Alto isn't filled with shoddy, non-hygeinic taquito stands, it is un
fortunately abundant with poorly-executed attempts at the bland, superficial "diver
sity" of the suburban variety (i.e. "ethnic" restaurants).
Thus we were naturally suspicious of any local Mexican restaurant that served $9
burritos. Bravely: we were prepared to suffer the absolute worst for Intermission and
braced our stomachs for what we expected to be another round of mediocre Mexi-
Cali.
Who knew that Palo Alto Sol would be such a pleasant surprise?
As we walked into this inviting little dining establishment on California Avenue,
we took note of the relaxed, intimate atmosphere with its warm lighting and a decor
we found tasteful. The walls were covered with a mix of plants, paintings and terra
cotta bric-a-brac, while a small sign hung at our table by the bar: a caricature of a puf
fin bird waving a cigarette warning us, "No Puffin'."
After we had pondered over the menu and munched on chips and three types of
salsas, the very friendly staff spoke to us in espanol to take our order (oh and don't
you worry, my little gringos, they also speak English).
We started off with a tasty serving of tortilla soup. This delicate broth was full of
fresh tomatoes and onions and topped with tortilla strips and cheese. While the soup's
flavor wasn't all too interesting, its refreshing lightness was a perfect appetizer for our
massive meal to come. For our entrees, we decided on a Campesino burrito and a
chile relleno / taco combination plate, both served with a heaping side of rice and
beans.
The burrito, made with mushrooms, vegetables and a green tomatillo sauce, was
muy gigante and full of gusto. The combination plate selections were aptly prepared
with a spicier red sauce. Flavor satisfaction! And the rice — perfectly moist and sa
vory — accompanied by the well-textured and tasty refried beans were no mere
asides.
Aside from that, we can say that the food was in the vein of the traditional Mexi
can culinary experience. That's right, authentic. There was no raw fish in the rice, no
baklava for dessert and no curry-Japanese-salsa to go with the Spicy Southwestern
black bean burger. Palo Alto Sol does not mean to make a "global cuisine" farce out
of "ethnic" dining; they just serve up some fine mexican food — que comidu tan
sabrosa!
To sum it all up, in words you Stanford kids like to use, this meal was all good\
Good food, good people, good location, good lookin'... and some authenticity to
boot. What else can we say?
