## Chechen doctors battle against overwhelming odds 
### 
STARYE ATAGI, Russia (AP)
— The teenage girl lay in a coma,
her face raw and black from shrap
nel wounds suffered while she was
fetching water at an outdoor well
during an air raid.
Doctors have been fighting for
days to keep 16-year-old Maren
Avdadayeva alive, despite dire
shortages of medicine, equipment
and no electricity or heat in the
makeshift hospital. But with no X
ray machine, they have no way to
determine if any metal splinters
remain embedded in her head.
After weeks of fighting, medical
care in Chechnya is close to col

lapse. In overcrowded hospitals,
patients lie on filthy, bloodstained
beds — or on cold stone floors.
Corpses are often left for hours
beside the living.
Patients and their relatives mar
vel at how doctors have struggled to
save lives.
"1 can't find words to express
what the doctors here are doing."
said Tamara Akhmadova. a 45-
year-old patient. "Without any
equipment, almost with their bare
hands the\ save people."
There are just two X-ray
machines in all of Chechnya,
according to doctors in the break

away republic. The machines are
vital for treating the hundreds of
people wounded by jagged shrap
nel.
I he makeshift hospital in Starve
Atagi. about 12 miles south of the
Chechen capital. Grozny, is set up
in an old school building. It has two
operating rooms, but the single
diesel generator can only provide
enough power lor one.
"II we had more power, we
would be able to operate on the sec
ond table." said Dr. Andarbek
Bakayev, his lace haggard from
overwork.
"We are short not only ol equip

ment, but the basics, such as anes
thetics. antibiotics and bandages,"
said Chechen Health Minister
IJmar Khambiyev.
Russia stopped sending medical
supplies to Chechnya almost a year
ago and most hospitals have almost
nothing left, doctors said.
"When there is no other way.
doctors look for medicine at home,
and sometimes even try to buy
some with their own money." said
Dr. Musa Idigov. "But we have
already located everything we could
find and we don't have money to
buy more."
Local residents have pitched in

to help, repairing old buildings and
bringing food to doctors and
patients.
Like most hospitals in Chechnya,
the hospital in the village of Chiri-
Yurt has no heat and a single gener
ator that provides enough power for
just one operating theater.
Umar Zibukayev, 12, shivered
under a thin blanket, both his legs
wounded by shrapnel. His father
was killed in a recent Russian air
attack on Grozny, while his mother
was killed during the 1994-96 war.
"Almost all of our patients are
civilians, hit by bomb fragments
while cutting wood in the forest.

working in the field or traveling in a
car." said Dr. Zhamalail Altemirov,
head of the Chiri-Yurt hospital.
"Russians are using barbaric
weapons against civilians," said Dr.
Khasan Bachayev. "Most of our
patients have very bad wounds
which require amputation."
Russian officials insist only mili
tary installations are targeted, but
reporters, aid workers and others
say hundreds of civilians have been
killed and wounded in massive air
and artillery attacks. The Chechen
government claims some 4.(XX) peo
ple have been killed and about
8.5(H) wounded, mostly civilians.
