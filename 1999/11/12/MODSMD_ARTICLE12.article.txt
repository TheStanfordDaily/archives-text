Decision to curtail the Band's
halftime activities during
Big Game a mistake

While the Athletic Depart
ment and the University
are right to be concerned
with safety issues around Big Game,
the decision to prevent the Band from
mocking California during the hall
time show is overly cautious and silly.
We've all seen the ugly side of this
rivalry. The Tree costume was
destroyed in 19%, a Stanford goalpost
came down in 1997 and last year was
a near-riot as Cal fans tried to break
down a line of security and make it to
the crowd of celebrating Stanford
fans.
But these atrocious incidents are
not caused by the Band's halltime
show. ITie halltime show isn't even
the straw that breaks the proverbial
camel's back. And the action taken by
the University and its Athletic
Department smacks of scapegoating.
Perhaps one thing that administra
tors don't understand is the difference
in how the two schools' students view
this rivalry. At Stanford we are taught
to "Beat Cal" and not much else.
Jokes are made about the Golden
Bears at Big Game Gaieties and the
Big Game Bonfire, but the "hate
training" pretty much ends there.
Things are much different at Cal.
Spotting a"St an turd Sucks" sign is an
almost everyday occurrence. Between
the beginning of the school year and
Big (iame — when the rivalry is at its
most heated — Cal students clad in
red are actually showered with
repeated taunts of "Take off that red
shirt" from their peers.
It would all seem to be in good lim.
except at Cal, too many students
don't seem to understand that there's
a line between good fun and
deplorable acts.

Last year's "kidnapping" of the
Tree costume — despite what Stan
ford fans and students may think
was a great example of the good side
of this rivalry. Of course, the Band
Shak had to deal with some vandal
ism. hut it was a peaceful act that met
perfectly with the spirit of our
schools' battle for The Axe.
The same goes for the Band's Big
Game halftime shows. It's harmless
ribbing in the spirit of fun and rivalry.
IfCal fans can't handle that, then they
should be the ones sanctioned.
Of course, not all Stanford students
are the model of good sportsmanship.
But the bad apples always seem to be
a minority in that bunch. There are
great differences between how the
two schools' students have acted since
1996.
Simply put, C'al fans have been
responsible for most of the postgame
problems at Big Game in recent years.
Yet Stanford students seem to be the
ones being penalized. The Tree is not
allowed to remain on the field at the
end of the game; and now the Band
can't take part in the most common of
all Big Game festivities: mocking our
rivals across the Bay.
And if anyone out there believes
this problem is not a direct result of
C'al student behavior, they are simply
wrong.
No other school that has come to
Stanford Stadium has done any of
this.
The UCLA football team took a
verbal beating for the players it had
involved in a handicapped parking
permit scandal during the summer.
USC is constantly mocked by the
Band. Yet those two schools, who
often bring a si/able contingent of
fans when they visit the Farm, do not
get out of control, as Gal fans do.
There's still time to correct this
mistake. Lift the ban on the Band.
Gome out and say what we all know:
Gal fans need to grow up.
