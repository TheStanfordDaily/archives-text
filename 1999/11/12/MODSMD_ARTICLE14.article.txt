Apparently yesterday
was Veteran s day, a fact
which one could have eas
ily failed to notice. Both
my father and his father
before him were drafted
into the army, though nei
ther of them saw active

A friend of mine is currently in the Navy
and was involved to some degree in the
engagement in Kosovo this spring though
I'm not really sure whether or not he can
technically be considered a veteran.
We are told that veterans sacrificed their
lives for the freedom that we enjoy. That's a
rather sobering thought: that before 1 was
born, without my asking, these people were
recruited to die for the sake of my well
being.
Of course, this wasn't done for my sake
personally, at least I assume it wasn't. These
veterans were sent to their deaths in order
to preserve the country. And hence the
United States owes its continued existence
to their sacrifice and to the military.
Lately, however, it seems that people at
Stanford are having misgivings about the
military. Of course, ever since there were
nations, some people have tended to say, "a
rich man's war, a poor man's fight."
It strikes me as strange that some people
on this campus would oppose the military,
since a fair number of people probably fall
into the category of "rich man." It would
seem that they should be especially grateful
that men have given their lives (and some
times souls) to preserve the social order that

makes life as we know it possible. And it
seems only common courtesy to make some
remembrance of them once a year.
We should remember that the United
States is a very good place to be. I think we
all feel fortunate to be here. This country
has one of the highest standards of living in
the world, its military power is now essen
tially unrivaled and its entertainment indus
try by far dominates the world. To a large
degree, I think this prosperity is attributable
to the capitalist ideology of the United
States, its relative guarantee of fundamental
rights and the 3.6 million square miles of
very exploitable natural resources.
Nevertheless, this prosperity has
depended on a military industrial strength
capable of providing continual import of oil
from the Middle East, of enslaving third
world workers to make our clothes and of
preventing National Socialism in the 1940s
from taking over the planet. This university,
as much as anywhere, I think is a sign of that
prosperity and of the power which this mil
itary industrial strength serves.
When I think of veterans, I inevitably
think ol Jack Nicholson's remarks in"A
lew Good Men:" "Son, we live in a world
that has walls. And those walls have to be
guarded by men with guns."
Is this true? Probably to some degree.
Like it or not, we are all part of a power
structure dependent upon the United States
military and the I Jnited States' self-interest
ed military policy.
If you happen not to like it — if you
don t like living in a country from which
other people are forcibly excluded, if you

don't like your relative physical comfort
and freedom from violence, if you don't like
a minimum wage greater than the earning
potential of the majority of people on Earth
or if you don't like paying less than two dol
lars a gallon for gas — if you don't like this
or the processes that make it possible, then
it seems almost hypocritical not to leave. By
accepting opportunities given to you by a
structure, you necessarily endorse the pro
cesses that made those opportunities possi
ble.
Is the military a bad thing? Is it bad that
young men are drafted to die for other peo
ple's causes? Is it bad that there are walls, as
it were, protected by men with guns? Per
haps — but it's worth considering the Alter
natives before coming to any hard and fast
conclusion.
F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote: "Aristoe
racy's only an admission that certain traits
we call fine — courage and honor and beau
ty and all that sort of thing — can best be
developed in a favorable environment,
where you don't have the warpings of igno
rance and necessity."
That's what Stanford is: the elite. And it
takes walls to keep out ignorance and
necessity. Freedom isn't free and neither is
beauty or Kuwaiti oil for that matter. And I
lor one am glad in a way that people have
been willing to die for these things.
