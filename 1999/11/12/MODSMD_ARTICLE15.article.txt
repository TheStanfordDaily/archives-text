The truth behind the Grape
Workers and Farmers
Coalition
We were surprised to read Friday's let
ter in I he Daily from (iary C'aloroso, who
claims to he a member of the Grape
Workers and Farmers Coalition (GW &
FC).
("aloroso met with us on behalf of the
Strawberry Workers and Growers
Alliance (created by the Dolphin Group
a Public Relations firm hired by straw
berry growers) as part of our Alternative
Spring Break trip last year investigating
the issues surrounding strawberry farm
labor. This group, like the GW & FC,
claims to support a free and open market
meaning its working against a boycott.
Ihe (iW & FC was founded in 1985,
the year after the UFW called for the boy
cott on table grapes. It was also started by
the Dolphin Group (which was hired by
the Western Growers Association) and
not on the initiative of workers. Fven by
1992, the GW & FC spokesman. Adam
Ortega, could not name a single farm
worker member.
Caloroso's letter is misleading in many
respects, lie claims to represent farm
workers and implies that the UFW is
opposed to their interests. On the con
trary. the IJFW boycott calls for improved

working conditions, which include: a ban
on cancer-causing pesticides, the right to
organize without harassment and good
faith contract negotiations when workers
vote for the union.
It is ironic that ( aloroso complains ol
the financial burden that would be put on
workers who came to Stanford to speak
when he voluntarily flew from Los Ange
les to meet with us in Watsonville for an
afternoon. The Dolphin Group has all the
lunds they need, thanks to the growers'
association that hired them.
It is also necessary to dispel the myth
that anyone Caloroso would send to Stan
ford would be average field workers. If the
(iW cV: FC now has farm worker members,
they would not be field hands but people
further up in the hierarchy of grape work
ers. I hey would receive "perks and bene
fits" from the GW & FC, essentially being
paid to speak as poster children in praise
of the growers.
In this respect, Caloroso's comment 011
the wealth of the UFW's "millions of dol
lars a year in charitable gifts" is nothing
compared to the hundreds of millions the
growers have to combat the UFW's cam
paigns.
Finally, the UFW has indeed moved its
organizing focus to the strawberry indus
try. but this does not invalidate the grape
boycott or the UFW's fundamental belief
that farm workers have the right to decent

wages, benefits and working conditions.
By supporting the grapes boycott, Stan
lord students have the power to send a
message to the growers that their vast
wealth does not give them the right to
harass and mistreat workers. The boycott
shows that we believe in the right of work
ers to organize without fear of intimida
tion.

Debate over Grapes issue
offers very limiting choices
Synergy I louse has discussed the Grape
Boycott issue and arrived at a decision,
but we feel that the voting options avail
able to us — yes or no — are limiting.
We already have a long-standing policy
of buying only organic food, and our pro
duce supplier buys from farms employing
fair labor practices. However, under the
specifications of the boycott we may not
buy from any farm — regardless of its
social consciousness — if it is not uniorv
ized with the UFW.
The UFW is a political organization
that has a specific agenda, and we see no
reason to support the entire agenda simply
because we agree with some of their poli

tics. Nor do we see a reason to boycott
organic farmers who already treat their
laborers well but do not belong to the
UFW.
Instead of aligning ourselves with a par
ticular political group, we prefer to sup
port the direct practices of the ideals we
believe in.
We continue to follow our usual food
buying policies, hut now have to fit the
decision into the binary nature of the cam
pus grapes vote, which will be published in
The Daily without comment.
Wc are concerned about the way the
voting results are presented, because a
simple tally of "yes" and "no" does not
properly express the diversity behind the
decisions. A "no" is interpreted to mean
that the house will buy any grapes regard
less of pesticides and poor work condi
tions, and the assumption is often made
that the students were more interested in
eating grapes than in promoting social jus
tice. Nowhere is there room for alternative
viewpoints and practices.
Therefore, we are leaving the interpre
tation of our decision to tfae grapes issue
coordinator and sending a letter to The
Daily to explain our stance.
