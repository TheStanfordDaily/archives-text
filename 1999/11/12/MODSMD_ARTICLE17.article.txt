# Gender polarization in music
##

With Lilith F air now a bygone tra
dition. it seems that woman per
formers such as Sarah McLach
lan and Jewel can sit back and congratu
late themselves for inaugurating an eni
where they no longer have to light to get
signed by major record labels and can
attract thousands of fans — reinforcing
equality and raking in dough in one fell
swoop.
II Lilith hiir symbolizes a move toward
equality in the music world, does it also
threaten to create a hyper-polari/ed new
dynamic in rock'n'roll with ever-girlie
women battling for listeners with ever
manly men?
Music critics young and old noticed the
rise of male roek'n'rap bands with a loud
and nasty agenda at the precise moment
when the Lilith craze abated. They've
commented on the reemergence of misog
yny in music through lyrics, violence and
all things not-Jewel.
But coming from outside the critics'

view, how should the discerning listener
react? Should you focus on the clarity of
the emotion in the music, whether or not
the artist indeed "did it all for the nook
ie?" Should you un-program a station
because its music offends your gender sen
sibilities and moral credo? Should you
always be aware of exactly what your
music is saying?
You like what you like, and sometimes
that's enough. But sometimes reacting
more than viscerally to music and the way
that it hits the rest of our society is neces
sary. Gender and sex today are far too
complicated.
We are rarely free of the veritable force
field dividing "Things Liked By Men"
from "Things Liked By Women." We are
quick to stereotype certain kinds of music
as male or female, and for some they are
mutually exclusive categories of music.
We have to think about why we are so
quick to marginalize the music that chal
lenges the wav sex is discussed in main

stream American culture. Is music that
approaches sex in such a vulgar fashion
the devil's work? Are the possible effects
of this music on gender relations some
thing we should consider, or do we just sit
back and groove?
Male-dominated bands are out there,
and hopefully female-dominated bands
have truly arrived in mainstream as a force
to stay. Gender balance in music is great
and may just raise the standard for pure
musical talent. The music industry should
thrive on such diversity.
Though college students are often sum
marily written off for their decadence and
stupidity, we're still a prime consumer
base for the music industry. The age of
pop stars today is shrinking quickly, and
marketing experts are waking up to the
emergence of teenagers as a major profit
base. Consumer groups are realizing that
high-school ideas about sex and gender
are more vulnerable than ever to manipu
lation bv music and the media. Parents and

psychologists alike are questioning the
potential effects of "male-rock" on young
women. Pop doesn't leave much room for
diversity between the girliest of girls and
the gnarliest of guys.
But sexually charged music and the
reactions and individual cultures it inspires
have to be dealt with practically. Stereo
typing genres is a mistake, simply because
sex is a touchy topic for mainstream soci
ety to address, and what is nasty to some is
hilarious or sexy to others. No single type
of music can claim to dodge singing about
sex. though some glamorize the negative
aspects considerably less.
The point is. we have to be careful that
reactions to specific songs and bands don't
restrict the way that we address sex and
gender issues in mainstream culture. We
cannot let things that are offensive fright
en us away from an exploration of why we
find them so. although choosing to turn off
the radio or leave a party is not a capitula
tion.

Generalization inevitably induces a
backlash. Though perhaps not without
some maneuvering by record labels, the
rise of Limp Bi/.kit might be correlated to
the prevalence of popular female-led
songs on the radio and a shifting listener
demand. Closer to home, your boyfriend
might like Kid Rock because he's sick of
listening to your favorite Indigo Girls tape
— and as long as folks are able to separate
what's happening in the music from real
life, little should change.
Music and gender are mutually depen
dent on each other as means of expression
and for raw material, but they're always
stepping on each other's toes. As listeners,
we simply have to stay out of the way and
decide on our own what we want to avoid
and what will be on our soundtrack for
life.
