# Korean Culture Night celebrates past and present
## 
### Kara Bradford 
In an effort to promote Korean
cultural awareness on campus, two
Korean student groups, Hwimori
and The Korean American Student
Association (KASA), co-spon
sored their annual "Korean Cul
ture Night: A Fusion of Old and
New" in Lakeside Dining Hall last
night.
This year's Culture Night com
memorated past Korean traditions
and celebrated the present.
Hwimori Issues Chair Jennie
Park, a junior, said. "We want to
preserve the old and make it part of
what we are now in [such] a way
that we still respect the diversity of
American society."
The two groups said that knowl
edge of their cultural background is
integral to defining their present
identity. "Such an event is what
keeps American culture kinetic,"
Park said. "This Culture Night is an
opportunity to treasure the tradi
tional Korean past breathing within
me. with the multicultural environ
ment that forms and surrounds
me."
Junior and co-culture chair of
KASA, Young Paik, said. "This
year, in step with KASA's vision,
we wanted to do more than simply
present a sequence of cultural
events. We were aiming to send a
message." To showcase the theme
of coupling the past and the pre
sent. "Hwimori |a traditional Kore
an drumming group] is doing a
piece with a jazz group." said
KASA President Soojin Kim, a ju
nior.
Whereas last year, only one

keynote speaker and Hwimori per
formed. this year there were sever
al student speeches, a fan dance, a
traditional drum performance and
a speech given by UC-Berkeley
Asian American Studies Prof.
Elaine Kim.
With a more ambitious and
eclectic approach, this year's Cul
ture Night had a crowd of 2(M), an
increase of more than 50 students
from the year before. Paik noted,
"Our hope was that the Korean
Culture Night wouldn't be some
thing restricted to Korean students;
but rather, it would be an event the
whole campus could come to."
KASA co-president James Han,
a senior, said while the program
should entertain, the event has the
deeper call to "open the hearts of
our fellow Korean and Korean
American students ... to become
more active to problems that may
not affect us directly nor immedi
ately, but will, in fact, affect us
eventually."
Although Culture Night is just
one of many KASA-sponsored ac
tivities, "This is my favorite KASA
event because it allows the Korean
American students on campus to
come together to celebrate our cul
ture and gives us an opportunity to
share our culture with others," said
Soojin Kim.
According to Park, event's goal
is to emphasize "the lack of repre
sentation in the media as well as in
politics that displaces [Korean
Americans] in our society."
"The evening is a way for the
[Stanford Community] to break
free from our ethnocentric mental
ity," said I lan.
