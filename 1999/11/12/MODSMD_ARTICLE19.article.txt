# Forum created to discuss women and alcohol
## Emphasis on personal response 
### Dennis Tyler 
A perceived increase in alcohol
related incidents on campus
prompted junior Florence Nocar to
start a forum to raise awareness of
issues concerning women and alco
hol at the Women's Center.
Nocar, who is the assistant to the
director at the Center and a psy
chology major, headed the first of a
series of discussions aimed at in
creasing alcohol awareness for
women yesterday afternoon at the
Center.
" The alcohol situation at Stan
ford has worsened considerably, es
pecially this year. My freshman
year at Stanford, alcohol was not
such a major issue. Hut because of
the personal stories I have heard
from my friends involving name
calling and stuff, I think the alcohol
issue has gotten out of hand,"
Nocar said .
The purpose of this forum is to
develop a dialogue that allows for
an open discussion about alcohol in
a confidential environment.
Nocar believes creating a confi
dential environment is important
given that the alcohol issue can be
such a private matter.
"The [alcohol] issue is not talked
about enough because alcohol is
such a personal matter. I his session
is important because it makes peo
ple more comfortable talking about

these particular issues," said Nicoli
Richardson, a junior who was pre
sent at the discussion.
Nocar wants to create a support
system for women so that they are
not afraid to talk to someone or call
upon someone in case of a crisis.
The group's intent is to promote
personal responses rather than em
phasizing statistical data concern
ing alcohol.
According to Nocar and
Richardson, the goal of the forum is
not only to raise awareness among
women in the Stanford community,
but also to create more resources
for them in other places on campus,
such as at Cowell Student Health
Center. Although there are existing
programs at Cowell, Nocar asserts
that "these programs are male-ori
cntcd and, therefore, the discussion
of how alcohol affects women is un
dertoned."
Among the discussion items at
yesterday's meeting were safety
and counseling issues related to al
cohol use.
In the future, Nocar hopes to set
up a panel of speakers to talk at
freshman dorms about the topic.
Nocar said the idea behind such a
panel is for freshmen to learn about
alcohol's adverse effects before ex
periencing them firsthand.
The group will meet each Thurs
day from noon to 1:30 p.m. at the
Women's Center.
