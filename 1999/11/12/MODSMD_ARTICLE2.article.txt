# Music is no easy listening

"What can you think about when
you're really listening to music?"
Michael Beckerman, professor of
Musicology at UC-Santa Barbara,
discussed this question last night as
part of a celebration for the Human
ities Center's successful completion
of a National Endowment for the
Humanities Challenge Grant- -
Beckerman opened his talk in a
full Campbell Recital tyall Sy'notirig

that various intellectual icons have
misunderstood or misused scientific
ideas in the past. I le then humor
ously noted that lie would be sure to
do the same by attempting to apply
psychological concepts to the idea of
how people listen to music.
Because of how the brain is set
up. Bcckerman explained, it is very
difficult to listen carefully to music
while attempting to concentrate on
words or images at the same time.
People can access either the musical

portion ol our brain or the language
portion of our brain, but if is very
difficult to access both at the same
time.
"Music and speech are separate
ly represented in the two hemi
spheres." Beckerman explained.
"Although there's considerable
overlap, language is predominantly
in the left hemisphere, while music is
chiefly scanned and appreciated irv

the right hemisphere."
Throughout the lecture. Becker
man periodically paused to drive his
points home with musical excerpts
and piano demonstrations. At one
point, he played a selection from
/denek Fibieh's "Vodnik" and chal
lenged the audience to pay attention
to the music playing behind a domi
nating narrator.
I le pointed out that while you can
still be aware that the music is play
ing at some conscious level, you can
not fully listen to or enjoy it when
language is activating your left hemi
sphere. He then played a piece
where the narration was in Czech to
demonstrate that this effect is de
pendent on your ability to under
stand the words that are interfering
with the music.
The result, Beckerman explains,
is that everyone listens to music dil
ferently, and each person catches

onto something different, whether
that be moment-to-moment notes,
the How of one musical phrase to the
next, or the individual chords and
how they lit with a piece's overarch
ing theme.
Beckerman's point was that once
people stop to analyze the music,
they can no longer truly listen to it
because the nonverbal "shadow
like" process that they normally use
to follow the music becomes disrupt
ed. What they are able to access is
limited by the structure of their
brains, Beckerman said. As a result,
he said, it is not possible to both ana
lyze the piece of music and to listen
to it and truly enjoy its intrinsic
value.
Beckerman, who specializes in
Central and Fastern Furopean
music, was a Humanities Center Fel
low from 1995 to 1 ( )%. lie has re
ceived the Janaeek and Dvorak
medals from the ( zeeh government,
and he regularly lectures for the San
Francisco Symphony and PBS's
(ireat Performances program.
