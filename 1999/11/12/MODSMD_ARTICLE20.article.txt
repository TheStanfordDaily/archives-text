At last night's meeting, the Un
dergraduate Senate discussed explor
ing the possibility of transforming
Roble I Jail's former dining hall into a
black-box theatre.
"Although no formal decision was
made, I think that the most important
item on the agenda... was the discus

Roble Dining Hall into a performing

arts venue," said ASSU Vice Presi
dent John Mills, a doctoral student in
genetics.
In a lively discussion, senate mem

the senators said they are not neces

to put together a wider discussion
with interested parties," Senate
Chair Steven Aronowitz, a senior.

Aronowitz said he hopes for an
arrangement where "the performing
