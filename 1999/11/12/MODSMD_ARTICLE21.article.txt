# Recommendation on eating clubs imminent
## 
### John Huetter 
The Toyon Eating Clubs have been a campus
tradition for 105 years. After next fall, they may
never be the same again.
The question of the eating clubs' future is being
raised in anticipation of the renovation of Toyon
Hall in the summer of 2(XX) as part of the Universi
ty's Capital Improvement Plan.
According to ASSU President Mike Levin and
and ASSIJ Vice President John Mills, the Stanford
Eating Clubs Working Group will submit its rec
ommendations for the clubs' future and results
from last spring's survey to administrators in early
December.
According to Levin and Mills, about 500 stu
dents participated in the ASSU online survey last
spring regarding the future of the eating clubs. In
an e-mail to The Daily, Levin and Mills said, "The
strong sense of support for maintaining the Eating
Clubs as a Stanford tradition as been very encour
aging."
Levin and Mills hope to receive a reply by early
January from Vice Provost of Student Affairs
James Montoya and Vice Provost for Budget and
Auxiliaries Management Tim Warner.
The poor physical condition of the four clubs —
Los Arcos, El Cuadro, El Toro, and Breakers co
op — and their prized campus location has led the
I Jniversity to consider either extensively remodel
ing or eliminating them altogether.
Since the beginning of summer, the Stanford

Eating Clubs Working Group, co-chaired by Levin
and Associate Vice Provost for Housing and Din
ing Services Keith Guy, has examined various fu
ture plans for the clubs.
For the past five months, they have met with
past and present student managers of the eating
clubs, Montoya, Warner, University Architect
David Newman and Vice President for Develop
ment John Ford to determine the dining fate of
over 400 eating club members, 40 percent of whom
are graduate students.
The working group includes Mills, two Resi
dential Education administrative representatives,
two graduate student representatives and one un
dergraduate student representative.
Many of the Toyon residents are opposed to the
idea of altering the eating clubs which are featured
as a major benefit of Toyon in the ASSU Draw
Guide.
"I love the eating clubs," said Sean Collins, a se
nior in his fourth year at Toyon. According to
Collins, the eating clubs have been what kept him
there for four years.
"They're great compared to what I had last year
[at Wilbur]," said Barbara Yang, a sophomore in
Toyon.
One of the CIP proposals calls fora renovation
of the aging clubs. Yang is uncertain about this
plan, acknowledging the clubs to be "structurally
unsound but really cozy."
"It's like the [Coffee House]," continued Yang.
"I don't know what they're doing with the [Coffee

House], but it was fine the way it was."
Senior Jennifer Bousman. who lived in Tovon
her freshman year, agreed, calling the clubs "the
character of Toyon."
Collins would accept remodeling the clubs as a
last resort. "I'd much rather see them renovated
than gone."
Renovation is becoming an attractive option to
students in light of a proposal to utilize the eating
club's valuable property for another building.
Should this occur, Toyon dining would move he
hind the residence and consolidate under Bran
ner's kitchen.
"I don't like that idea," grimaced Yang.
"That is not good," said Collins, shaking his
head.
However, Toyon resident Seth Elliot, a sopho
more. was favorable to changes in the eating clubs.
A vegetarian, E:lliot bemoaned the lack of meatless
fare offered by the clubs.
"People said the food was going to be good," he
said, and recalled wondering with a vegetarian
drawmate, "Where [are] we [going to] eat'?"
Elliot wouldn't be opposed to having the clubs
shift to a traditional dining hall format. "I lived in
FloMo last year. There's a lot more options for veg
etarians," said Elliot. "It seems like a lot of the veg
etarian stuff [at Toyon] is side dishes."
Bousman remains dubious of the effect student
impact will have on the administration, particular
ly considering the value of the current eating club
real estate. "You're talking money," she declared.
