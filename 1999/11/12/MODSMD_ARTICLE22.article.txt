## "Knowing-Doing Gap" says action must follow recommendations

Companies need to stop talking
and start acting, according to two
Stanford professors in their new
book, " The Knowing-Doing Gap:
Mow Smart Companies Turn
Knowledge into Action."
Business Prof. Jeffrey Pleffer
and Industrial Engineering Prof.
Robert Sutton, specialists in orga
nizational behavior, co-authored
the book which was released last
month.
"Ditl you ever wonder why so
much education and training ...
produce so few changes in actual

management practice?" the au
thors said in a press release.
According to the authors' four
years of research, fear, destructive
internal competition and mindless
reliance on precedents are among
the walls that firms fail to break
through when they try to learn
from the success of their competi
tion.
The authors also ascribe this gap
between knowing and doing to
higher education.
"The problem is that for MBA
students and management consul
tants there is a strong premium
placed on saying smart things and

so little emphasis placed on stick
ing around to make sure that orga
nizations actually do smart things,"
the authors said.
"MBA education, especially at
top schools, focuses on case discus
sion where students gain status and
good grades for making pithy state
ments, which are almost never
longer than one minute."
Pfeffer and Sutton's book has
received praise from high places.
In a quote from the book's jack
et. Cisco Systems' CEO John
Chambers said, " The Knowing-
Doing Gap' will help business peo
ple apply their expertise in ways

that arc well suited for succeeding
in this new economy."
Howard Berhard, president of
Starbucks Coffee, said, '"The
Knowing-Doing Gap' is a refresh
ingly clear guide for turning the
learning organization into a doing
organization."
Sutton and Pfeffer state bluntly
that their book is just "a lot of talk.
Now it is up to your and your col
legues to turn this knowledge into
action."
"The Knowing-Doing Gap.
256 pages long, was published in
hardcover by the Harvard Business
School Press.
