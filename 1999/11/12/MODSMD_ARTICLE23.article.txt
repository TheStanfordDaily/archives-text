# Fac Sen reconsiders discipline policy
## 
### Anitha Reddy Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate devoted yesterday's meeting to
the first of a two-part discussion on changes proposed to
the Faculty Discipline Policy.
The President's Task Force on Faculty Discipline and
Faculty Grievance Procedures recommended only one
substantive alteration to existing policy: the provost, in
stead of the president, should act as the prosecutor rep
resenting the University against accused faculty mem
bers.
History Prof. James Sheehan, head of the task force,
said, "It seemed odd that the president should be both
prosecutor and judge." Because the existing discipline
policy casts the president in the role of University pros
ecutor and final arbiter of the discipline proceedings, di
viding those responsibilities between the provost and
president would reduce the potential for conflicts of in
terest.
Making the provost, the university's highest academ
ic official, the prosecutor would reinforce the academic
nature of all discipline proceedings, Sheehan continued.

Much of the Senate's debate focused on members'
fears that the proposed policy's main clause could be
broadly interpreted to threaten faculty members who
chose to honor personal or political beliefs through
demonstrations or teach-ins.
Citing a clause defining one example of misconduct
as "preventing or obstructing teaching," Business
School Prof. Joanne Martin expressed concerns that a
faculty member could be disciplined for cancelling class
and urging students to attend a teach-in.
The details of such a case would be important to any
judgment, Shcehan replied, and noted that it was very
"difficult to find language fine-grained enough" to cover
every possibility.
Many faculty members who spoke of the policy's im
plications were clearly not assuming that relations be
tween the administration and the faculty would always
remain as "benign and salubrious as they are now,"
Sheehan said.
"Turbulent times," was a phrase used several times.
Provost John Hennessy also announced members of
a search committee for the successor to University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper have been selected. Philosophy
Prof. John Etchemendy is chairing the committee, which
includes six trustees, six faculty members, two students,
one staff member and one alumnus.
