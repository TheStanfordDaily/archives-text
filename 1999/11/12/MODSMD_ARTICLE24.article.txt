## Time to get down to business Stanford faces off with ASU in key Pac-10 showdown 
### Ben Freda Editorial staff 
Senior wide receiver Deßonnie
Pitts put it in the clearest language
this week: "We have to win if we want
to go to the Rose Bowl."

But even if the Cardinal (5-3. 5-1
Pacific 10 Conference) pulls out a win
this week at Arizona Stale (5-4.4-2),
a Rose Bowl appearance still might
not he in the cards.
And a win at Arizona State — de
spite the fact that the Sun Devils are

behind the Cardinal in the Pac-10
standings — is far from a sure thing.
The Sun Devils are still \ery much in
the race for the Rose Bowl, and if the
squad can beat Stanford this week, it
only has to wait fora Washington loss
to vault into the top spot in the Pac

10.
Arizona State crushed Washing
ton in Seattle 28-7, dealing the
Huskied their only conference loss.

For its part, the Cardinal, now tied
with the Huskies for first in the con
ference and the exclusive right to the
Rose Bowl, will ajso have a close eye
on Washington's game tomorrow
against UCLA and next week's
matchup against Washington State.
The Cardinal and the Huskies are
both 5-1 in conference play. But be
cause Washington beat Stanford in a
head-to-head matchup two weeks
ago, Washington will be the team that
heads to Pasadena if the teams are
still tied in three weeks.
On the other hand, provided the
Cardinal doesn't lose to Arizona
State tomorrow or Cal next week,
any Washington losses — either to
UCLA tomorrow or Washington
State next week — mean that the
Cardinal will head to the Rose Bowl.
ILiat's why last weekend most of
the Stanford football team was glued
to the television. The team's second

Senior Todd Husak, shown here against the Washington Huskies, will need plenty of protection this
weekend if the Cardinal wants to stay in the running for the Rose Bowl.
