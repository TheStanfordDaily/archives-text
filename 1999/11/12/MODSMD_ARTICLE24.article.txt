## Time to get down to business Stanford faces off with ASU in key Pac-10 showdown 
### Ben Freda Editorial staff 
Senior wide receiver Deßonnie
Pitts put it in the clearest language
this week: "We have to win if we want
to go to the Rose Bowl."

But even if the Cardinal (5-3. 5-1
Pacific 10 Conference) pulls out a win
this week at Arizona Stale (5-4.4-2),
a Rose Bowl appearance still might
not he in the cards.
And a win at Arizona State — de
spite the fact that the Sun Devils are

behind the Cardinal in the Pac-10
standings — is far from a sure thing.
The Sun Devils are still \ery much in
the race for the Rose Bowl, and if the
squad can beat Stanford this week, it
only has to wait fora Washington loss
to vault into the top spot in the Pac

10.
Arizona State crushed Washing
ton in Seattle 28-7, dealing the
Huskied their only conference loss.

■ Tomorrow: Stanford (5-3,5-1 Pa

(5-4, 4-2), 3:30 p.m., TV: FOX

For its part, the Cardinal, now tied
with the Huskies for first in the con
ference and the exclusive right to the
Rose Bowl, will ajso have a close eye
on Washington's game tomorrow
against UCLA and next week's
matchup against Washington State.
The Cardinal and the Huskies are
both 5-1 in conference play. But be
cause Washington beat Stanford in a
head-to-head matchup two weeks
ago, Washington will be the team that
heads to Pasadena if the teams are
still tied in three weeks.
On the other hand, provided the
Cardinal doesn't lose to Arizona
State tomorrow or Cal next week,
any Washington losses — either to
UCLA tomorrow or Washington
State next week — mean that the
Cardinal will head to the Rose Bowl.
ILiat's why last weekend most of
the Stanford football team was glued
to the television. The team's second

bye of the season meant that the Car
dinal could only watch last week's
Arizona-Washington game in hopes*
that the Wildcats would come up
with enough gumption to beat the
Huskies. Not so. The Huskies won
33-25.
"I was coaching from my couch,"
Pitts said. "Arizona wasn't listening
to me, though."
Pitts wasn't the only one watch
ing.
"It was very difficult to watch."

said head coach Tyrone Willingham.
"Now I know what my wife feels like
when she watches our games. You
have very little control over what
takes place and you sit there grinding,
hoping that good things are going to
happen."
Tomorrow at Arizona State, the
('ardinal will again be able to control
part of its own destiny when it faces
the Sun Devils in Tempe, Ariz.
The Sim Devils are coming off an
emotional victory last week over
USC in l.os Angeles. Arizona State
needed ;i victory to stay in the race for
a bowl game, and the team respond
ed with a 26-16 win over the Trojans.

The team relied on heroics from
senior tailback J.R. Redmond as it
has all season. Saturday, Redmond
rushed for I4<S yards and all three of
the Sun Devils' touchdowns. He is
the third-leading rusher in the Pac-10
with 887 yards on 1 SO carries.
But he does more than just rush.
In addition to the 56 offensive plays
he lined up for, Redmond was on de
fense for 22 snaps and took seven
punt returns. I le paid for it with three
thigh bruises but will be ready for to
morrow's game.
" Their running back, J.R. Red
mond. is probably the most complete
player in the conference," Willing

ham said. "There's probably nothing
he can't do. Xhey utilized him as a
safety last week, as a kick returner, as
a reciever and as a running back, and
he performs all of those roles ex
tremely well."
In addition to controlling Red
mond, the Cardinal defense will have
to look out for the option — a play
that Washington used often against
the Cardinal two weeks ago in their
offensive attack that helped them
gain 670 yards of total offense and
beat Stanford 35-30.
In any event, the Cardinal won't
have any problems getting excited
for Saturday's game.
