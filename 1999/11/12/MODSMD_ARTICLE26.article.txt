WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL

■ Today:No.2Stanford (21-2. I?-I
Pacific 10 Conference) at Arizona
State (11-10. 7-7), 7 p.m., RADIO:
KZSU (90.1 FM).
■ Tomorrow: Stanford at No. 18
Arizona (15-K. 9-5). 7 p.m., RADIO:
KZSU (90.1 FM).

This weekend, the No. 2 Stan
ford women's volleyball team looks

to keep on the path ol the Bruins, as
it travels to Arizona for its last lull
weekend of away competition dur
ing ihe regular season. The Cardinal
(21-2. 13-1 Pacific 10 Conference)
takes on Arizona State (11-10, 7-7)
and No. 18 Arizona (15-8. 9-5)
tonight and tomorrow.
The win against the Bruins estab
lished the Cardinal as a prime eon
tender for the Pac-10 Champi
onship, placing Stanford within one
hall game of I ICLA's minimal lead.
Ihe two conference matchups
this weekend have thereby become
increasingly important, as the possi
bility of the Stanford women rcceiv
ing the Pac-10 crown rests on solid,
winning performances in the desert.
The Cardinal defeated both Ari
zona teams in straight games in
Maples Pavilion earlier this season,
and looks to maintain season sweeps
over both schools. Stanford put away
Arizona State (15-4,15-10,15-6) and
Arizona (16-14, 15-4, 15-2) back on
Oct. 14 and 15, respectively.
Friday's competition will be an
especially big night for head coach
Don Shaw, as he prepares to coach
his 500 th collegiate game. Shaw has
hand-crafted the Stanford women's
volleyball legacy in his last 20 sea
sons on the Farm. His record in
cludes four NCAA championships
and nine Pac-10 crowns. I lis NCAA
winning percentage of .862 is the
best in Division I history.
Despite the hype of Shaw's 500 th
game versus Arizona State on Fri
day. Arizona will undoubtedly be
the more challenging of the two, as
the Cardinal will look to shut down
the momentum of the Wildcats' of
fense.
In October's competition, Stan
lord allowed the emotionally driven
Wildcats to make an offensive run
during the first game. The Cardinal
squad brought this momentum to a
halt by focusing on it's defense, and
serving to eliminate Arizona's

strong setting, thereby cutting off the
Wildcats offense.
Stanford continues to be led by
senior outside hitter Kerri Walsh
and freshman outside hitter Logan
Tom. Tom sits at the head of the Car
dinal statistics with a 4.76 kill per
game and 0.45 service aces per game.
Walsh follows right alongside with
3.62 kills per game and an attack per
centage of .368. Walsh currently
leads the team in digs with 3.19 per
game.
The Sun Devils only field a single
major threat, junior outside hitter
Amanda Burbridge (4.53 kills per
game. No. 3 in the Pac-10). The
Wildcats will look to the pair of ju
nior middle blocker Marisa DaLee
(3.72, No. 7 in the Pac-10) and fresh
man outside hitter Lisa Rutledge
(3.41) to lead them against the Car
dinal.
The Wildcats have now won
three straight, but lost three in a row
preceeding their current win streak.
Arizona State has also had difficulty
pulling off a win as of late, as they
too hold a losing streak of five in a
row.
Despite sitting at a half-game be
hind UCLA, Stanford leads the Pac
-10 in both attack percentage (.307,
No. 4 in the NCAA), and blocks
(3.2Bbpg, No.'lOin the NCAA). The
Cardinal squad looks to position it
self in line toward the Pac-10 crown
with two crucial conference wins this
weekend.
