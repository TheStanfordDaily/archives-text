# Card wows MSG crowd
## Stanford downs Duke in thriller 
### Johnathan Stull Staff writer 
Stanford point guard Mike Mc-
Donald almost had to check his cal
endar after last night's game with
Duke. It may have read Nov. 11. hut
inside Madison Square Garden it
sure seemed like March. In a sloppy
back-and-forth game, the Cardinal
took home a thrilling 80-79 overtime
victory against college basketball's
preeminent name, holding on at the
final buzzer as Nate James' 40-foot
prayer bounced off the rim, then the
backboard, and finally into Stanford
hands.
Stanford (1-0) won despite the
loss of senior Mark Madsen late in
the second half. Madsen, an All-
America candidate, strained his right
hamstring and will not play in the
Coaches vs. Cancer championship
game tonight against lowa, which
knocked off No. 1 Connecticut, 70-
68, last night.
"The atmosphere was unbeliev
able," 1 McDonald said, "You play
against Duke on an outside court and
it has tournament atmosphere. But
here in the Garden with all the fans,
it was intense."
While it may have felt more im
portant than the first game of the

year, the level of play was ab< >ut right
fora season opener. In a sloppy
game, Stanford had 24 turnovers and
Duke (0-1) shot 29 percent Irom the
field and only 23 percent from inside
the three-point line.

"It looked like two young teams
out there," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "It was a pretty
entertaining game. But from a
coaches standpoint, I'm sure we're
sitting here thinking, there's a million
things we can work on."
But even Montgomery had to
admit the win was a big one.
"It's huge because of Duke," he
said. "Duke's a great program. Prob
ably the great program in college
basketball the last two years."
At the end of the second half, wit h
the heavily pro-Duke crowd cheer
ing them on, the Blue Devils tried to
prove their greatness once more.
