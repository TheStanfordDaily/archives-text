# Card wows MSG crowd
## Stanford downs Duke in thriller 
### Johnathan Stull Staff writer 
Stanford point guard Mike Mc-
Donald almost had to check his cal
endar after last night's game with
Duke. It may have read Nov. 11. hut
inside Madison Square Garden it
sure seemed like March. In a sloppy
back-and-forth game, the Cardinal
took home a thrilling 80-79 overtime
victory against college basketball's
preeminent name, holding on at the
final buzzer as Nate James' 40-foot
prayer bounced off the rim, then the
backboard, and finally into Stanford
hands.
Stanford (1-0) won despite the
loss of senior Mark Madsen late in
the second half. Madsen, an All-
America candidate, strained his right
hamstring and will not play in the
Coaches vs. Cancer championship
game tonight against lowa, which
knocked off No. 1 Connecticut, 70-
68, last night.
"The atmosphere was unbeliev
able," 1 McDonald said, "You play
against Duke on an outside court and
it has tournament atmosphere. But
here in the Garden with all the fans,
it was intense."
While it may have felt more im
portant than the first game of the

year, the level of play was ab< >ut right
fora season opener. In a sloppy
game, Stanford had 24 turnovers and
Duke (0-1) shot 29 percent Irom the
field and only 23 percent from inside
the three-point line.

"It looked like two young teams
out there," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "It was a pretty
entertaining game. But from a
coaches standpoint, I'm sure we're
sitting here thinking, there's a million
things we can work on."
But even Montgomery had to
admit the win was a big one.
"It's huge because of Duke," he
said. "Duke's a great program. Prob
ably the great program in college
basketball the last two years."
At the end of the second half, wit h
the heavily pro-Duke crowd cheer
ing them on, the Blue Devils tried to
prove their greatness once more.
After trailing 60-55 with 3 minutes,
29 seconds left, Duke ran" off 11
straight points to pull ahead 66-60
with 50 seconds to go. Stanford had
Madsen siting on the bench, barely
able to walk, little life left in the Car
dinal.
Still, as McDonald said later,
"With this team, you never stop be
lieving."
Down six, junior forward Ryan
Mendez knocked down a three from
the corner. Then, after Duke fresh
man Jason Williams smoothly hit
two free throws to give the Blue
Devils a comfortable five-point
cushion, senior David Moseley
found some room on the right side
and sank another three.
"I really felt like they were play
ing great defense on my three-point
er, and I wasn't going to get it off,"
said Moseley, who led Stanford with
20 points. "I just used my dribble,
made some space, and I got my shot
off and, you know, it went in."
Duke had another chance to ice
it, but junior Jarron Collins stole
Williams' pass to freshman Nick
Horvath, then got back under the
basket and laid it in with 10 seconds
left to send the game into overtime.
After the first few minutes of the
extra period, Stanford appeared to
have the game under control, two

three-pointers from McDonald and
two easy inside baskets giving the
Cardinal a 78-70 lead.
Still, like any good heavyweight,
Duke capitalized on Stanford's mis
takes to come within one. But, lean
ing on the ropes, the Cardinal sur
vived.
"It was kind of like
punch/counter-punch," Mont
gomery said. "They made a run. we
made a run."
It wasrr't that way just in over
time. In the first half, Stanford
jumped out to a quick 10-0 lead be
fore Duke fought its way back into
the game, closing within two at the
midway point.
While the Cardinal shot well in
the opening period, it was a strange
half for the team.
Stanford had an advantage inside
with Madsen and the Collins twins,
but got only five points from the trio
in the half. During halftime, Stan
ford realized it need to push the ball
into the low post. Taking advantage
of Duke's inexperienced inside, the
Collinses and Madsen combined for
22 points and 19 rebounds in the sec
ond half.
While the Cardinal struggled lo
jumpstart its inside offense, its inte
rior defense was smothering from
start to finish. Duke flubbed numer
ous lanes and short jumpers
throughout the evening, as Stanford
hounded the Blue Devils into miss
ing 40 two-point shots.
