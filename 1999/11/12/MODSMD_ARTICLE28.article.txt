I lie Cardinal squad stands only
one game behind No. ! UCLA in
both league and overall standings.
While Stanford will be hoping that
the Bruins drop a game to No. 3 USC
this weekend, the Cardinal must
focus on winning both its games to
stay in the league and national-title
hunts.
Tomorrow, Stanford (17-3, 6-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
will travel to Stockton to take on Pa
cific (13-9, 3-4) in the final league
game for the CCardinal. Currently tied
with US( for second place in the
MPSI 7 , Stanford must win this game
in order to keep its hopes alive fora
fust-place finish in the MPSF.
Stanford and IJOP have only
played once this year, in the season
opener. I lowever, the two squads
scrimmaged a jot this sunimei and
know each other well.
In the teams' one meeting this sea
son llu. Cardinal put on an impres

sive display, earning a 9-1 victory.
Seven players scored for Stanford, in
cluding redshirt sophomores lodd
Snider and Mark Amott, who each
had two goals. Goalie Nick Ellis an
chored the Cardinal defense with 10
saves.
Despite Stanford's easy win in
September, tomorrow's game will
not be a Cakewalk. Pacific has already
defeated No. 4 California once this
season. "Pacific is especially tough at
home. We've had a really tough time
at this pool," said Stanford head

coach Dante Dettamanti.
The Tigers are led by a trio of for
midable holemen. senior Gabe Es
posto, freshman Gavril Chernousou
and junior Sergev Bushuev.
Chernousou and Bushuev. natives of
Kazakstan, have a good deal of inter
national experience under their belts.
Stanford two-meter defenders Jon
Skaalen, a senior, and Pasi Dutton, a
redshirt sophomore, will focus on
shutting down these three players.
The Cardinal will return to
deGuerre Pool to face the Gauchos

of UC-Santa Barbara (9-11. 2-5) on
Sunday. While this game will not
count toward league standings, it. will
factor into each team's overall
record.
Last weekend in the teams' first
meeting Stanford dominated, win
ning 7-2. Offensively the Caidina!
squad was led by freshman Jell Ne
smith and Skaalen. each of v\hom
scored a two-point goal. But the stor\

fense, which almost earned a
shutout, yielding only two goals on a
penalty shot and a man-up opportu
nity.
If Stanford continues to play
strong defense, it shouldn't have any
problems beating Santa Barbara
once again. Yet the Cardinal must be
careful not to look past the Gauehos.
"It's human nature to overlook a
team that you just beat fairly easily
the weekend before, but we must
stay focused," Dettamanti said.
Indeed the Cardinal will do its
best to pull out two wins this week
end as the season enters into its final
weeks and as the team gears up for
the league and national tourna
ments.
