WOMEN'S SOCCER
■ Tomorrow: No. 7 Stanford (14-4
I. 7-1-1 Pacific 10 Coherence) vs
Cal Poly-San L.nis Obispo (13-8)
7:30 p.m., New Maloncy Field.

In August, before classes even
started, the Cardinal wys hard at

work creating a list of tangible goals
the team wanted to accomplish
throughout the course of the season.
First on their list was a Pac-10 cham
pionship.
Goal accomplished.
Next on their list was a berth to the
NCAA tournament and a home-field
advantage. Accomplished. Tonight
at New Maloncy Field the Cardinal
will work toward the realization of
goals on a list that ultimately leads to
a National Championship title.
Stanford faces unranked ( al l'olv-
San Luis Obispo (13-S). a team that

battled Fresno State on Wednesday
night fora chance to play the Cardi
nal in the second round of the Tour
nament. Despite the fact that Fresno
was favored to win and given home
field advantage, Cal Poly defeated
Fresno 2-1.
Although this is the first tourna
ment game for the Cardinal this sea
son. the team intends to approach it
with the same intensity it would have
in the final rounds of the tournament.
Stanford cannot rely on the success it
has had this season — records do not
count in tournament play, it isperfor

manec that matteis.
"We are in the same position ;>s
every other team out there."' senior
co-captain Jennifer O'Sullivan said.
"F.vervon; vying for the NCA \
title and it doesn't matter if you have
a better record than them or if you
won your conference or not. What
matters is the result you get "
Stanford's record, however, did
give the Cardinal somewhat of an ad
vantage tonight. By earning a spot
one of top 16 seeds in the touma
ment, the Cardinal was given a bye in

the lirst round of tournament play
and did not have to compete on
Wednesday in order to advance to
the second round of play. The Cardi
nal was also given a home field venue

for tonight's game.
"Here, we don't have to disrupt to
our routine and the home crowd is
helpful," head coach Steve Swanson
said. "Hopefully, it will give us a little

bit of an edge, but at the'end of the
day, you have to go out there and
play."
Another factor working to the
Cardinal's advantage is the fact that it
welcomes O'Sullivan and senior
Kelly Adamson back into the lineup,
two players who have consistently
started for Stanford throughout the
season.
"Having Kelly and Jenno back in
the lineup will make a huge impact
on our game," said senior goalkeeper
Wendi Whitman. "They are both
great players and great leaders on the
team."
With a competitive season sched
ule, the Cardinal has proved that it
can play and dominate the teams that
qualified for tournament play. Four
teams from the Pac-10 were given a
spot in the tournament, three of them
in the top 16.
"The great thing about our sched
ule is that all of our games, particu
larly those over the last four weeks,
have been the same intensity as tour
nament play," O'Sullivan said. "We
have played against some great
teams and we know we cannot domi
nate them."
Knowing that it can beat teams of
this caliber, however, does not make
the Cardinal complacent about
tonight's game.
"We are not satisfied at all," said
Swanson. "We feel that we can make
a great run at things and we're set to
do that."
