# Web site designed at Cal to combat plagiarism

### Sandra Upson 
Stanford's Judicial Advisor Laurettc Bceson
is unsure at this time whether an anti-cheating
device recently developed at UC-Berkeley will
cross the Bay to Stanford.
A Web site, plagiarism.org, first envisioned
by Berkeley doctoral students in 1995, aims to
combat student plagarism.
At the site, students submit papers on the
Web, which then get scanned for similar phras
ing against material on millions of Internet Web
pages.
Plagiarism.org recognizes lifted phrases at
least eight words long or a series of plagiarized
quotes and phrases.
The site is also building a database of past
class essays to prevent students from using pre
viously written papers.
UC-Berkclcy Prof, of Neurobiology David
Presti told the San Francisco Chronicle that he
had used the service last spring. He found that a
little more than a one-tenth of his class hud pla
giarized, despite being cautioned by him at the
onset of the course.
Though UC-Berkeley's plagiarism.org is still

in a pilot stage, other universities and organiza
tions arc looking into using it. I he issue has also
been brought to Stanford.
"Our office has talked about using it. espe
cially when a case has been brought to our of
fice," said Bceson.
As for whether Stanford would ever consider
instituting such a policy across campus, she said
"it would probably depend on how it was used
and if the students were notified ahead of time."
Doug Zuidema, the assistant director of stu
dent activities and services / student conduct at
UC-Berkclcy. feels confident that the new tech
nique will receive good reviews from all in
volved.
"I actually think that this is something that
would be endorsed by both faculty and students.
It ensures the integrity of students' papers and
also allows students to submit their papers elec
tronically."
Zuidema added that the students, as well as
professors, can use the Web site to their advan
tage.
"Students can run their papers through the
program on their own to check if they missed
any citations," he said.

For now, only UC-Berkeley's Office of Stu
dent Conduct and some UC-Berkeley faculty,
who were directly approached hv the doctoral
students who developed it. are using plagia
rism.org.
Allison Katsev, a Stanford teaching fellow,
said there is no need for widespread use of pla
giarism.org across the University. "To me that
seems like a violation of the Honor Code," she
said.
Beeson also said that she believed most pro
fessors generally view students as honest. She
said even in the cases where plagiarism occurs,
professors have different ways of dealing with
the issue.
"In cases where I suspect possible plagiarism,
I give students the benefit of the doubt and I
have found that they deserve it," Katsev said.
Beeson said that though Stanford administra
tors in the Dean of Students Office have dis
cussed the use of plagiarism.org, there has been
no serious initiative to implement it at Stanford
beyond the use of it as a tool in determining dis
ciplinary action when necessary.
"If we don't trust the students, we shouldn't
have an Honor Code," emphasized Katsev.
