## Thai cafe spices up Psych building 
### Katie Leonberger Contributing writer 
The alluring smell of Thai food
wanders in and out of the rooms of
Building 420 (commonly known as
the psychology building) starting at
about 11:15 a.m. every weekday. The
aromas waft up from the Jordan Hall
Cafe, which is located directly across
from lecture hall 40 in the basement.
This hole-in-the-wall restaurant
attracts a long line of customers every
Monday through Friday. Open only
for lunch from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.,
the line forms at the cash register.
The cafe has maintained an aura
of mystery for years. The manager,
saying he was afraid of attracting

more customers, declined to be inter
viewed for this article.
Regular customers know and ap
preciate the enigmatic cafe. An ener
getic man or woman will take your
order once you make it to the front of
the line, and within thirty seconds, a
hot plate of Thai food is sitting in your
hand — all for just $5.
You are then ushered from the
line to pick up your utensils and nap
kins by the door, after which it is up to
you to find somewhere to sit (or
stand) and eat.
The majority of Jordan Hall cus
tomers eat outside, either in the base
ment patios of the math and psych
buildings or in the quad. The cus
tomer base predominantly consists of

graduate students hungry for lunch.
First-year graduate student Siu
Lee, who likes Asian food, frequents
the cafe about once a week. "There
are only so many choices on campus
[for food). This is a better choice than
Tresidder." says Lee.
The selection of food, while pleas
ing to some, is also disappointing to
others. "I am kind of tired of it. If they
could have more selection, that
would be good," says Zhang.
Customers often opt for either one
of the two specials for each day, since
the specials offer the most variety.
According to Lee, one special always
features chicken. True to form, the
specials offered this past Monday
were chicken with green currv and

vegetarian noodles.
But overall, it seems as if the cus
tomers are content with this busy lit
tle cafe. Why else would they stand in
a line that extends all the way through
the back of the math basement patio?
Second-year economics graduate
student Shujing Li says that "(the
food] tastes very good." While eating
at the cafe for only his second time
this Wednesday, Li emphasizes that it
is a nice place and he enjoys the out
door dining. His only complaint?
"Add more tables and chairs."
Many of the customers agree that
they enjoy the outdoor dining experi
ence.
And the ominous arrival of winter
rain does not seem to daunt these din
ers. "I guess we'll just take the food
somewhere else — possibly inside."
says Lee.
The cafe's main form of advertis
ing runs by word of mouth. But the
smells that enter the psychology
classrooms seem to create a big draw
too.
Sophomore Matt Allessio takes
Psychology 1 until 12:15 p.m. Mon
day. Wednesday and Friday. " The
tantalizing aroma of the Thai food
captures my attention as 1 exit my
[psychology] class around lunch time
everyday," says Allessio.
Although the long line is a deter
rent to some possible customers, the
line moves fairly quickly. A five-to
ten minute wait in line seems to be the
typical price for "fast, reliable, good
food that is relatively cheap," says
sophomore Jackie Carr.
What's more, adds Carr. with Thai
food at the cafe, "if you like it then
you know vCm like it."
