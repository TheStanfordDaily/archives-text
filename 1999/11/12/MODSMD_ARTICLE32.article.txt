# Post office sorts through complaints
## 
### Heather Wax Contributing writer 
Let's face it, bashing the unassum
ing post office employee has become
almost banal. Postal workers have
been disparaged in the press and
made the butt of numerous jokes. But
when it comes to service at the Stan
ford Station, students feel there's
good reason why references to "snail
mail" have not yet grown tiresome.
"It takes longer to get a letter
that's sent here than one that's sent to
Palo Alto," freshman Anthony Re
vitz said of the campus post office.
"And it's really annoying that you
have to wait so long. It's just so slow
here."
But while lengthy lines and long
waits are the most common com
plaints. there is another difficulty
Stanford students worry about when
picking up their mail.
"There's sort of the legend of the
rude guy at the post office," said ju
nior Elly Matsumura.
"It will come up at tables in the
dining hall: 'You know that guy at the
post office. 1 saw him today and he
was so rude to me.' But nobody says
which one. I wonder if it's just repre
sentative of rudeness at the post of

fice in general."
While Jim Ruiz, manager of cus
tomer service at Stanford Station,
said though there's not much he can
do about the long lines, he is working
on the source of the post office fable.
"1 know who they're talking
flbout. Some people hate him like
crazy," he said of the employee.
"Sometimes I see him with people
and they walk out with the biggest
smile on their faces. And then other
times, for whatever reason, people
leave upset."
"He yells at rule-breakers, and
that's why he's feared. But at the end
of the day.he does his job well," said
senior Ryan Parks. "I have a warm
spot in my heart for what he goes
through. I le's dealing with a lot of
rude people too."
Graduate student Heather
Sokoloff said that watching him with
his customers made waiting the 15
minutes it took to get to the front of
the line a lot more fun. "I wanted him
to serve me. He's so funny. I thought
he was hilarious."
"I guess I'm trying to teach him to
find a middle ground." Ruiz said.
"But I apologize, people should not
have to come in the office and deal
with this."

Ruiz knows what it's like to wait
in line, and realizes that it's probably
worse when you're in between class
es. can't get in and out right away, and
think the staff is rude.
"We're supposed to treat cus
tomers with a certain degree of pro
fessionalism and I think this is some
times lacking here. I'm working on
actions to fix the problem." Ruiz said.
Ruiz already holds what he calls
"stand-up talks" with the clerks
about once a week to bring problems
to their attention. But there may also
be a few things patrons themselves
aren't aware of.
Postal employees often start while
most students are still in bed, stand
for hours and sort and sequence the
more than 12.000 deliveries that
come through the one little office.
They have to go to school and pass
a test to be "window qualified," and
even then, the job is not an easy one.
"They're responsible for the stock
they sell. I audit them, and if they're
short money, it comes out of their
pocket. So not anyone wants to be a
window worker, and the ones that are
are more careful. That accounts for
some of the slowness," Ruiz said.
"But if you're in line, and they
hear you say 'They're so slow' and

they're back there working as hard as
they can. that doesn't help."
Ruiz is also quick to point out that
there's now a posting in the lobby
that restricts disruptive behavior. He
says he's been dealing with people
ranting and raving in the lobby fora
long time.
"Ii doesn't help anybody. Until
you talk to somebody you really
don't know anything about thehi.and
the post office is the same way." he
said.
"But people are standing in the
line and they think there's nobody to
say 'Why is it like this' to. But I'm re
ally trying to change that."
Ruiz hopes that the addition of a
self-service area with vending ma
chines and weight scales will help cut
down on waiting time.
1 le also plans to spend a lot more
time in the lobby, taking people who
just want to buy a couple of stamps or
mail a letter out of the line.
But if you need the help of some
one at the window, he just asks one
thing.
"If a clerk is not pleasant and help
ful. don't tell them. Tell me and I'll
talk to them. I don't want students to
think there's no one to complain to.
Complain to me â€” that's my job."
