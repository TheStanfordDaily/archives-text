# Stanford on smoke
## 
### Sarah Heim Contributing writer 
Finding a student smoking at
Stanford is like trying to find a
Berkeley fan in the Cardinal sec
tion at Big Game.
Or at least that's how it appears
when you take a stroll around cam
pus.
However, according to a series
published by Cowell Student
Health Services, "On campuses
like Stanford, one out of four stu
dents have smoked tobacco within
the last year. Many use it infre
quently; 10 percent to 15 per-

cent use it regularly."
So who are all these
student smokers and
where are they hid-

mg out?
"Europeans

and Asians are
about 95 percent
of the people I see

smoking on cam
pus," said Jacques
Frederic Kerrest,

a computer sci
ence graduate stu
dent and a smoker.

Originally from
France, Kerrest said
that during his five years

at Stanford, he has never had
any trouble with University smok-

ing regulations.
"No one has ever asked me to
put out a cigarette on campus. I
don't know what the regulations
are, but I don't smoke inside," he
said.
According to Stanford's policy
on a smoke-free environment,
smoking is prohibited in classrooms
and offices, all enclosed buildings
and facilities, in covered walkways,
in University vehicles and during
indoor and outdoor athletic events.
"1 haven't ever been asked to
put out a cigarette," international
policy graduate student Damian
Belloch said as he smoked under
the covered walkway on the
perimeter of the Quad.
"Cigarettes create bonds," he
said. "I'm not typical here; I have
more friends that are smokers than
most."
Belloch, originally from Spain,
said that he sometimes gets an
noyed looks when he's smoking on
campus. However, what he finds
more alarming is the difficulty he
often has trying to sip coffee and
smoke with a fellow student. He'll
ask if he or she minds if he has a cig
arette and that person will actually
respond, "yes."
"The fact that this happens is re
markable," he said.
"I come from a country where
the rights of the non-smokers are
not protected. Here it is the oppo
site," he said. "I wonder if there is a
middle ground anywhere?"
The middle ground sure isn't
California, where smokers' rights
were declining long before the ban
on smoking in bars went into effect

last January.
"If there's the possibility of lim
iting anything in California, they'll
do it," Kerrest said. "It's not a Stan
ford problem, it's a state one. Pret
ty soon they're not going to allow us
to eat meat in this state."he added.
Patricia de Castries, assistant di
rector and data manager for the
Stanford Language Arts Center,
agrees. "It's not Stanford. This is a
really easy-going place to work and
live. It's the state of California. You
need a scapegoat and here it's
smoking."
"If you look at the statistics in
this country, you have almost

as many obese people
with health problems as

cigarette smokers. I
don't see any laws

banning fattening
food," she added.

"1 think there
should be a 25-
percent tax on all
junk food."

A 1 -
though she
laughed, it is ob
vious that de Cas-

tries, a smoker who
was born in France,

takes her freedom to
smoke very seriously.
"I think we need to re-

spect each other's space," she said.
"Let people be free. This is a free
country. That's why we're here."
But many Stanford students do
not feel comfortable lighting up in a
state where smoking is continually
frowned upon.
Senior Lindsey Munro, not a
smoker herself, said she knows of
students who hide the fact that they
smoke, sneaking out late at night
and smoking in parking lots to
avoid confrontation.
The campus smoke-free envi
ronment policy also applies to all
University residence halls.
"There are certain places
around residences where students
can smoke," Ann Porteus, associ
ate director of Residential Educa
tion said. "We've been leaving it
pretty much up to the community
to decide these areas, but if resi
dents complain we have to go back
and look at the situation. It's our re
sponsibility to juggle people's
needs."
"More of the complaints we get
about smoking come from gradu
ate residences than undergraduate
ones," said Jane Camarillo, direc
tor of Residential Education.
T his doesn't come as a surprise
to de Castries, who has beer in
volved with campus life since 1987.
"Graduate students smoke more
than undergraduates," she said.
"Very few people I know are ac
tual smokers," senior Dave Scheine
said. "But students do smoke so
cially at parties."
Junior Gabriel Meza said that
although most of his friends don't

smoke, the ones that do are usually
respectful and do it in an outdoor
area.
"It doesn't bother me at all," he
said. "1 don't smoke and I never
have, but I don't want to push my
morality on someone else."
Not all students are as obliging as
Me/a.
Robert Bach, a graduate student
in Comparative Literature, once
overheard two students ask a couple
of Italian smokers to put out their
cigarettes while waiting in line at the
Moon Beans ('ale.
According to Bach, the smokers
were furious.
"[The students] mentioned some
rule that vou can't smoke close to
buildings." Bach said. "But I had
never heard of such a rule."
Overall thoimh. the few smokers

that do pass through White Plaza or
sit outside of Sweet Hall don't seem
to run into much adversity.
"If I'm sitting by someone and
they start smoking, I'll probably get
up and go. but I'm not terribly agi
tated," senior Meredith McClrath
said.
Communications graduate stu
dent Chow Nualkhair understands
that people may be bothered by her
secondhand smoke and is conscien
tious of non-smokers around her.
I lowever. she is quick to point
out that when she's abiding by uni
versity regulations on campus, she
expects her rights to be respected
too.
"As long as I'm sitting some
where by myself or with a 112 riend, no
one has any right to give me a dirty
look." she said.
"I'm totally against health and
fitness." she added. "I think people
should enjoy their lives in the way
thev see fit."

ate residences than undergraduate
ones," said Jane Camarillo, direc
tor of Residential Education.
T his doesn't come as a surprise
to de Castries, who has beer in
volved with campus life since 1987.
"Graduate students smoke more
than undergraduates," she said.
"Very few people I know are ac
tual smokers," senior Dave Scheine
said. "But students do smoke so
cially at parties."
Junior Gabriel Meza said that
although most of his friends don't

smoke, the ones that do are usually
respectful and do it in an outdoor
area.
"It doesn't bother me at all," he
said. "1 don't smoke and I never
have, but I don't want to push my
morality on someone else."
Not all students are as obliging as
Me/a.
Robert Bach, a graduate student
in Comparative Literature, once
overheard two students ask a couple
of Italian smokers to put out their
cigarettes while waiting in line at the
Moon Beans ('ale.
According to Bach, the smokers
were furious.
"[The students] mentioned some
rule that vou can't smoke close to
buildings." Bach said. "But I had
never heard of such a rule."
Overall thoimh. the few smokers

that do pass through White Plaza or
sit outside of Sweet Hall don't seem
to run into much adversity.
"If I'm sitting by someone and
they start smoking, I'll probably get
up and go. but I'm not terribly agi
tated," senior Meredith McClrath
said.
Communications graduate stu
dent Chow Nualkhair understands
that people may be bothered by her
secondhand smoke and is conscien
tious of non-smokers around her.
I lowever. she is quick to point
out that when she's abiding by uni
versity regulations on campus, she
expects her rights to be respected
too.
"As long as I'm sitting some
where by myself or with a 112 riend, no
one has any right to give me a dirty
look." she said.
"I'm totally against health and

Finding a student smoking at
Stanford is like trying to find a
Berkeley fan in the Cardinal sec
tion at Big Game.
Or at least that's how it appears
when you take a stroll around cam
pus.
However, according to a series
published by Cowell Student
Health Services, "On campuses
like Stanford, one out of four stu
dents have smoked tobacco within
the last year. Many use it infre
quently; 10 percent to 15 per-

cent use it regularly."
So who are all these
student smokers and
where are they hid-

mg out?
"Europeans

and Asians are
about 95 percent
of the people I see

smoking on cam
pus," said Jacques
Frederic Kerrest,

a computer sci
ence graduate stu
dent and a smoker.

Originally from
France, Kerrest said
that during his five years

at Stanford, he has never had
any trouble with University smok-

ing regulations.
"No one has ever asked me to
put out a cigarette on campus. I
don't know what the regulations
are, but I don't smoke inside," he
said.
According to Stanford's policy
on a smoke-free environment,
smoking is prohibited in classrooms
and offices, all enclosed buildings
and facilities, in covered walkways,
in University vehicles and during
indoor and outdoor athletic events.
"1 haven't ever been asked to
put out a cigarette," international
policy graduate student Damian
Belloch said as he smoked under
the covered walkway on the
perimeter of the Quad.
"Cigarettes create bonds," he
said. "I'm not typical here; I have
more friends that are smokers than
most."
Belloch, originally from Spain,
said that he sometimes gets an
noyed looks when he's smoking on
campus. However, what he finds
more alarming is the difficulty he
often has trying to sip coffee and
smoke with a fellow student. He'll
ask if he or she minds if he has a cig
arette and that person will actually
respond, "yes."
"The fact that this happens is re
markable," he said.
"I come from a country where
the rights of the non-smokers are
not protected. Here it is the oppo
site," he said. "I wonder if there is a
middle ground anywhere?"
The middle ground sure isn't
California, where smokers' rights
were declining long before the ban
on smoking in bars went into effect

last January.
"If there's the possibility of lim
iting anything in California, they'll
do it," Kerrest said. "It's not a Stan
ford problem, it's a state one. Pret
ty soon they're not going to allow us
to eat meat in this state."he added.
Patricia de Castries, assistant di
rector and data manager for the
Stanford Language Arts Center,
agrees. "It's not Stanford. This is a
really easy-going place to work and
live. It's the state of California. You
need a scapegoat and here it's
smoking."
"If you look at the statistics in
this country, you have almost

as many obese people
with health problems as

cigarette smokers. I
don't see any laws

banning fattening
food," she added.

"1 think there
should be a 25-
percent tax on all
junk food."

A 1 -
though she
laughed, it is ob
vious that de Cas-

tries, a smoker who
was born in France,

takes her freedom to
smoke very seriously.
"I think we need to re-

spect each other's space," she said.
"Let people be free. This is a free
country. That's why we're here."
But many Stanford students do
not feel comfortable lighting up in a
state where smoking is continually
frowned upon.
Senior Lindsey Munro, not a
smoker herself, said she knows of
students who hide the fact that they
smoke, sneaking out late at night
and smoking in parking lots to
avoid confrontation.
The campus smoke-free envi
ronment policy also applies to all
University residence halls.
"There are certain places
around residences where students
can smoke," Ann Porteus, associ
ate director of Residential Educa
tion said. "We've been leaving it
pretty much up to the community
to decide these areas, but if resi
dents complain we have to go back
and look at the situation. It's our re
sponsibility to juggle people's
needs."
"More of the complaints we get
about smoking come from gradu
ate residences than undergraduate
ones," said Jane Camarillo, direc
tor of Residential Education.
T his doesn't come as a surprise
