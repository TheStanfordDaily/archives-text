Though he began to discover his
love of film literally and figuratively
behind the scenes, Communication
Prof. Henry Breitrose now finds him
self guiding the future filmmakers
into the upcoming millenium.
Born and raised in New York, a
17-year-old Breitrose, as a student at
the University of Wisconsin, realized
that his original goal of studying med
icine wasn't going to pan out.
"1 was hell-bent on studying med
icine, but I didn't," he said.
In order to support himself in col
lege. Breitrose Ux)k on a laboring job
"carrying heavy things around.
Those "things'" turned out to be the
lights, cameras and tripods for the
university's audio-visual unit, and the
job became a 20-hour a week com
mitment that introduced Breitrose

into the world of filmmaking.
He was invited by Northwestern
University to be the first graduate stu
dent in film, where he completed his
master's degree while working in pro
duction in Chicago. Soon after, he
went on to accept an appointment in
1960 at Stanford to teach a class called
"Film for television."
At Stanford, he met International
Communication Prof. Wilbur
Schramm, who interested Breitrose
in"the effects of mass communica
tion."
"Five years later, I wrote a disser
tation. got a Ph.D., and was appoint
ed an assistant professor," he said.
Since his early days of carrying
film equipment, Breitrose has made
quite a journey, one that has led to an
enviable position in life. He has now
taught at Stanford for 39 years.
"I really enjoy coming to work in
the morning I find it an immense
pleasure.
Breitrose has lectured, worked
and helped design curriculum in
Hungary, New Zealand. Malaysia.
Denmark, Ghana and Poland.

among many other countries. I le also
worked in Iran before the revolution
and South Africa, where he consulted
with the African National Congress
about film and television training, six
months before Nelson Mandela was
elected president.
"1 think I made a pretty wise deci
sion Being an academic gives one
a great deal of intellectual freedom.
At a place like Stanford, you spend
most of your life dealing with ideas,
and people who are very smart, and
that's a lot of fun."
The students that Breitrose has
encountered and taught over the
years include the likes of broadcast
journalist Ted Koppel. producer of
"Aliens" and"The Terminator" Gail
Ann Heard, actress Sigournev
Weaver, actor Fred Savage, actress
Reese Witherspoon and Prince
William of Gloucester.
Yet Breitrose admits he is not too
conscious of his high-profile students.
He laughs. "Usually, as I'm sitting at
home, making out the grade sheets.

my wife will look over my shoulder
and point out to me all the interesting
people in my class."
Sophomore Matt Brutocao re
members that during Sophomore
College, Breitrose modestly dis
missed his impressive experiences.
"He would say, 'If you stay in the
same place fora long enough time
with a lot of famous people coming
through, you run into a few of them."
I lowever, he takes great notice of
the work that his students do, and
often finds himself learning from his
students as they learn from him. "I've
had papers from students that are so
good, they've been published in jour
nals," he said.
Of his classes, Breitrose com
ments, "It's very easy to get an 'A.'
Just tell me something I don't know!"
Not a simple task, considering

Breitrose's wide range of knowledge.
Breitrose's former Sophomore Col
lege Assistant Jason Medelson states.
"One thing about him as a professor
that makes him so interesting is that
he has amassed so much knowledge
... he's gone all over the world."
Mendelson raves about both Bre
itrose and his classes. He asserts. "I
love the fact that he hits on so many
different fields. He has an amazing
gift to see film as an outlet and a re
flection for everything else."
He adds, "He really lets his stu
dents get a better view of his world
because of his teachings."
Many of Breitrose's students
agree, and most state his love and pas
sion for film as a salient aspect of his
teaching.
Sophomore Maureen Fan states,
"He has a lot of passion for movies
and what he does, even though he has
watched the movies many times."
Brutocao agrees: "You can tell he
just loves movies more than anything

in the world."
Sophomore Brooke Hanson adds,
"He treated us with respect, as stu
dents with possible futures in film."
Mendelson remembers Bre
itrose's oft-repeated statement: "I
want my students watching movies
like crazy."
Between Breitrose's love for film
and his wile's former position as the
television director for the BBC. it is
no surprise that their two children
have grown up loving movies.
"Having a lot of movies around
the house just rubbed off as normal,"
Breitrose said.
Despite his successful and fulfill
ing career, Breitrose concedes to a
-
few abandoned dreams.
"I wish that I'd gone to chef's
school, because I love to c00k.... and
I 'm intensely jealous of my son. who's
a journalist. I would have liked to be
a journalist."
II this had been the case, the film
world would have lost a key player. In

his spare time. Breitrose serves as the
vice president for Publications of Re
search at the International Associa
tion of Film and Television Schools,
where he addresses his aim of "en
couraging the training of film and \
television makers in developing
countries."
When asked about future goals,
Breitrose quips. "Retirement!
First, however, he plays to finish
his book on the origins of the idea of
documentary film, as well as further
ing his goal of increasing the possible
opportunities for documentary film
making in Public Broadcasting and
cable television.
Breitrose said he has not worked
on any films lately. "I've made some
pretty bad [films] in the distant past
and worked on some better ones in
the not-too-distant past."'
There are also few more young
filmmakers to guide before Breitrose
takes his curtain call from the film
world.

takes his curtain call from the film
world.
Though he began to discover his
love of film literally and figuratively
behind the scenes, Communication
Prof. Henry Breitrose now finds him
self guiding the future filmmakers
into the upcoming millenium.
Born and raised in New York, a
17-year-old Breitrose, as a student at
the University of Wisconsin, realized
that his original goal of studying med
icine wasn't going to pan out.
"1 was hell-bent on studying med
icine, but I didn't," he said.
In order to support himself in col
lege. Breitrose Ux)k on a laboring job
"carrying heavy things around.
Those "things'" turned out to be the
lights, cameras and tripods for the
university's audio-visual unit, and the
job became a 20-hour a week com
mitment that introduced Breitrose

into the world of filmmaking.
He was invited by Northwestern
University to be the first graduate stu
dent in film, where he completed his
master's degree while working in pro
duction in Chicago. Soon after, he
went on to accept an appointment in
1960 at Stanford to teach a class called
"Film for television."
At Stanford, he met International
Communication Prof. Wilbur
Schramm, who interested Breitrose
in"the effects of mass communica
tion."
"Five years later, I wrote a disser
tation. got a Ph.D., and was appoint
ed an assistant professor," he said.
Since his early days of carrying
film equipment, Breitrose has made
quite a journey, one that has led to an
enviable position in life. He has now
taught at Stanford for 39 years.
"I really enjoy coming to work in
the morning I find it an immense
pleasure.
Breitrose has lectured, worked
and helped design curriculum in
Hungary, New Zealand. Malaysia.
Denmark, Ghana and Poland.

among many other countries. I le also
worked in Iran before the revolution
and South Africa, where he consulted
with the African National Congress
about film and television training, six
months before Nelson Mandela was
elected president.
"1 think I made a pretty wise deci
sion Being an academic gives one
a great deal of intellectual freedom.
At a place like Stanford, you spend
most of your life dealing with ideas,
and people who are very smart, and
that's a lot of fun."
The students that Breitrose has
encountered and taught over the
years include the likes of broadcast
journalist Ted Koppel. producer of
"Aliens" and"The Terminator" Gail
Ann Heard, actress Sigournev
Weaver, actor Fred Savage, actress
Reese Witherspoon and Prince
William of Gloucester.
Yet Breitrose admits he is not too
conscious of his high-profile students.
He laughs. "Usually, as I'm sitting at
home, making out the grade sheets.

my wife will look over my shoulder
and point out to me all the interesting
people in my class."
Sophomore Matt Brutocao re
members that during Sophomore
College, Breitrose modestly dis
missed his impressive experiences.
"He would say, 'If you stay in the
same place fora long enough time
with a lot of famous people coming
through, you run into a few of them."
I lowever, he takes great notice of
the work that his students do, and
often finds himself learning from his
students as they learn from him. "I've
had papers from students that are so
good, they've been published in jour
nals," he said.
Of his classes, Breitrose com
ments, "It's very easy to get an 'A.'
Just tell me something I don't know!"
Not a simple task, considering

Breitrose's wide range of knowledge.
Breitrose's former Sophomore Col
lege Assistant Jason Medelson states.
"One thing about him as a professor
that makes him so interesting is that
he has amassed so much knowledge
... he's gone all over the world."
Mendelson raves about both Bre
itrose and his classes. He asserts. "I
love the fact that he hits on so many
different fields. He has an amazing
gift to see film as an outlet and a re
flection for everything else."
He adds, "He really lets his stu
dents get a better view of his world
because of his teachings."
Many of Breitrose's students
agree, and most state his love and pas
sion for film as a salient aspect of his
teaching.
Sophomore Maureen Fan states,
"He has a lot of passion for movies
and what he does, even though he has
watched the movies many times."
Brutocao agrees: "You can tell he
just loves movies more than anything

in the world."
Sophomore Brooke Hanson adds,
"He treated us with respect, as stu
dents with possible futures in film."
Mendelson remembers Bre
itrose's oft-repeated statement: "I
want my students watching movies
like crazy."
Between Breitrose's love for film
and his wile's former position as the
television director for the BBC. it is
no surprise that their two children
have grown up loving movies.
"Having a lot of movies around
the house just rubbed off as normal,"
Breitrose said.
Despite his successful and fulfill
ing career, Breitrose concedes to a
-
few abandoned dreams.
"I wish that I'd gone to chef's
school, because I love to c00k.... and
I 'm intensely jealous of my son. who's
a journalist. I would have liked to be
a journalist."
