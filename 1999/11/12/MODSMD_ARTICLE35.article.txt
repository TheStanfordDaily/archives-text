After almost a full season of
training, the Cardinal crew team can
no longer hide behind the alibi of
Stanford's quarter system.

MEN'S CREW
■ Tomorrow: Stanford competes at
the I lead of the Lake in Seattle.

This Sunday, the men's crew
team will have to show its worth at
the I lead of the Lake regatta in
Seattle.
Unlike the Head of the Ameri
can regatta, the team does not ex
pect to come in first. Neither can it
expect to cruise into second place.
In Seattle, Stanford will be up
against No. 3 Washington and Pacif
ic 10 ( onlerenee teams such as ()re
gon State, Washington State, Cal
and I JSC.
In order to maintain a competi
tive edge, the crew team is going lo
race its fastest boat and a slower JV
boat as opposed to racing two varsi
ty boats of approximately equal
speed as they did at the I lead of the
American regatta.
"We had a line up for the race be
fore the I lead of the Charles regat
ta," said men's crew coach Wieslaw

Kujda. "It was really fast, but I
changed my mind because I fell that
we should send most of the seniors. I
feel that now we should use the line
up we had before Boston. It's time
for people to really step up now.
They have to take better owner
ship."
Last year, Washington dominat
ed the regatta, coming in more than
30 seconds ahead of second-place
Oregon State. The Cardinal came in
third, four seconds after Oregon
State.
"This year, my personal goal and
hope is that we split the difference
between Oregon and Washington
and better last year's time by a con
siderable amount," said senior co
captain Michael English.
While Stanford's best-known
rival is Cal, the Cardinal has a lesser
known, but just as intense rivalry
with Oregon.
"We consider Oregon to be our
closest rival here on the West
Coast," said senior Will Smith.
"They got eighth and we got 10th at
nationals. We're always competing
neck-and-neck with those guys. We
beat them at San Diego last year, but
it's always going back and forth.
We're looking forward to beating
them."
Although the team is tired after

returning from the Head of the
American regatta, Kujda plans to in
crease the intensity of the workouts.
According to Kujda, the team is still
working on improving strength to
increase speed at the beginning of
the race.
"We're going to train the same as
we did for Boston," Kujda said. "I or
the Head of American, we didn't
work for speed. We tried to go half
way because people were still tired
after coming back from Boston.
Tiredness is a limiting factor, and we
really want to put in the hard work.''
Because it is late in the fall racing
season, this regatta is an accurate
predictor of how the team will per
form in the spring season.
"I thought [the Head of the Lake|
was always a good benchmark for
us." Kujda said. "This is the one race
where we can see where we are
standing. In Boston, we were trying
to guess, bul we needed more weeks
of training.
" This race is more of a true pic
ture of what we're able lo do righi
now and what we'll be able to do in
the spring, 112 rom my coaching point
ol view, it's a measure of whether
we've done enough aerobic exercis
es and whether we can reach the de
sired speed or we need more prepa
ration."
