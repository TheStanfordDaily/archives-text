■ Tomorrow: Stanford competes at the Head of the
Lake in Seattle.

"li s always more exciting when you're flying
somewhere." said junior co-captain Stephanie
Cowles. "But this is a group that is always excited to
race."
1 he I lead of the Lake is the largest and most at
tended regatta the women's crew will race in this fall.
I lie majority of West-Coast crews will be competing
there, including many of the Pacific 10 Conference
teams.
Major competition for the Cardinal will come from
perennial powerhouses Cal and Washington. The
I luskics will have the added benefit of rowing on their
home course.
I he focus tor this year's crew, which is comprised
ol mainly freshmen and sophomores, has been on
training lor the major races in the spring, all of which
are 2 km compared lo the 5 km fall races.
I he team decided early in the year not to race in
many regattas this fall, staying home and focusing on
technique and building endurance instead.
Sunday's race provides the next step toward meet
ing the big goals for the spring — including the hope

of securing a bid to the NCCA Championships in
Camden, N.J.
"There is a huge turn in the middle of this course,"
Cowles said. "It's a technically difficult course."
Freshman Laurie Benson, who is one of three
freshmen on the Varsity boat, agrees.
"The turn is something we're not used to," she said.
"It's hard to recreate it here, but we're going to prac
tice on the actual course Saturday morning."
The nearly ISO-degree turn will require exception
al leadership from the coxswain, the individual who
controls the steering and gives directions to the eight
rowers.
In order for the boat to successfully navigate
through the turn, the starboard side of the boat will
have to apply nearly twice as much pressure as the
port side.
The varsity boat this weekend will be coxed by
freshman Wendy Hoeveler.
"I'm really confident about having her as the
coxswain," Benson said. "She has experience. She's
done different races on this course in the past."
Although the team is young, many of the members
rowed competitively before coming to Stanford. This
year's team includes Megan Burritt, a member of last
year's silver-medal junior world team.
"Being on a young team has been really great so
far. A lot of the younger people have lots of high
school experience," Benson added.
After placing second and fourth in the Women's
Open Eight at the Head of the American in Sacra
mento on Oct. 30, the crew is ready to step up to the
next level.
"We're really excited about the race," Cowles said.
" The boats feel strong. We're coming into our own."
