vakia.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
â–  Today: Stanford vs. Lokomotiva
Kosicc, 7:30 p.m.. Maples Pavilion.
RADIO: KZSU (9(). 1 FM).

"We are very excited to be play
ing again," said senior guard Milena
Mores. "It has been a while since
we've been able to go out there in
our uniforms in front of a little
crowd."
The two-week break has had a
significant effect on the team in
practice. Mores and sophomore for
ward Bethany Donaphin suggested
that the C ardinal has been struggling
recently to stay mentally focused on
the season ahead.
"I think, this week, we haven't
been as intense as we need to be."
Donaphin said. " That's just some
thing mental. We have a lot of talent,
and we've improved so much from
last year. We just need to get in our
minds how good we can be and work
toward that everyday in practice."
I he Cardinal practiced well and
with intensity on Wednesday. They
looked quiek and ran their plays ef
ficiently in intersquad action. The
team is healthy and physically ready
to plav.
"Sometimes I think that teams
are ready to play games and, even
though we are not really ready men
tally, they're ready. They want to

play, " said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer.
"I think we're getting sick of play
ing each other, basically," Donaphin
said. "We're ready to take it out on
somebody else."
Lokomotiva Kosice is a touring
club team from Slovakia. Earlier this
month, the Slovakian team lost to
Pacific 10 Conference members
Washington, 83-67, and University
of Oregon, 74-59.
Stanford's first exhibition game
against the USA Basketball
Women's National Team forced the
Cardinal to concentrate on working
on post play and defense in the
paint. Slovakia, on the other hand,
should challenge the Cardinal's
backcourt and outside game.
"The I European style is very open
offense. They pass well. They spread
the floor. It's a different style to play
against," VanDerveer said. "I think
it will be good because lowa State
lias a lot of three-point shooters and
usually the Europeans shoot a lot of
three-pointers. So we've got to play
very good defense and get out on
people, and not allow them to get a
lot of outside shots."
VanDerveer said she hopes
tonight's game will give the team
more experience before the regular
season starts.
"It's really for us to get out and
have a tuneup before our regular
season," VanDerveer said.
"The exhibition games are good
because von kind of work out some
of the kinks before it starts to
count," Donaphin said. "We're just
excited because we get to play. We
are looking forward to our regular
season games, but we'll take what
we can get right now."
