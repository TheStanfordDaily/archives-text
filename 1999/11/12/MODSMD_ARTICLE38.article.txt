(0-1) 16.

Bakersfield, Burnham Pavilion.

"This is early in the year to be
competing with such tough teams,"
said head coach Chris 1 lorpel. "I am
proud of the way we performed,
Oregon is always very competitive,
and to have it come down to the last
match was great."
One of the bright spots for the
Cardinal was the emergence of red
shirt freshman walk-on Harold Pen
son. In his first college start, Penson
upset Oregon senior Jesse Culp 6-5
at 174 pounds.
"It was exciting at first and 1
started out tense, but I had to calm it
down a couple of notches, relax and
just wrestle," Penson said. "After I
won my teammates congratulated
me, and 1 was feeling like I was on
top of the world."
"[Penson was] just mentally and
physically tougher and more pre
pared than his more experienced
opponent," 1 lorpel said.
Zach Zimmerer, last year's Pac
-10 runner up and three-time NCAA
qualifier at 133 pounds, defeated

Brian Watson 2-0, showing that
once again he will he prepared to
challenge tor the Pac-10 crown.
Other highlights included senior
Clay Hackerman's 15-6 decision
over Lei! Williams at 165 pounds
and senior Warren McPherson's 9-6
win against Eugene Harris at 175
pounds.
Stanford's scoring was rounded
out by two-time NCAA qualifier
Rudy Ruiz. The junior beat Jason
Harless 9-4 and was pleased with
the team and his own performances,
though he forsees the team's poten
tial as greater than what was
demonstrated.
"It was the first match, so there
were bound to be jitters. Individual
ly 1 felt good, but there are a couple
of things I can work on," Ruiz said.
"Altogether, my focus and intensity
were up but the team going in was
tougher than what we showed on
the mat."
The Cardinal hosts defending
Pac-10 champion Cal State-Bakers
field tomorrow at Burnham Pavil
ion. Bakersfield comes to Stanford
with an extremely talented squad,
including Ail-American Moses
Delphin.
Meanwhile, Horpel stresses that
the team is looking to the future,
namely the Pac-10 championships
in February.
"This is a young team and needs
to expand their arsenal and be
taught a master plan of techniques,"
Horpel said. "Conditioning will
continue to be a substantial part of
practice and Saturday's match will
be competitive, as Bakersfield has
strong wrestlers in every weight di
vision like we do."
