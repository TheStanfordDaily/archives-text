# Smith returns from Washington

### Amit Garg 
After seven years at the Depart
ment of Education. Marshall Smith, a
former dean at the School of Educa
tion, announced Tuesday his inten
tion to return to Stanford and teach
this spring.
Smith, who joined the Clinton ad
ministration as Undersecretary of
Education in 1993, has been Acting
Deputy Secretary of Education since
August 19%.
Smith was nominated by Clinton
in 1997 to be Deputy Education Sec
retary. Subsequently, Clinton twice
asked the Senate to approve Smith's
nomination, but the Senate commit
tee with jurisdiction over the Depart
ment of Education did not act on the
nomination.
Some have speculated that the
delay was a major reason for Smith's
resignation.
Among Congressional Republi
cans, Smith was perceived as being at
the center of controversial education
department issues such as the federal
direct-loan program and proposed
voluntary national tests for school

children.
"He's been a political hull s-eye
on the Hill for so long; that wasn't
changing," said a Congressional aide
on Capitol Hill to the Chronicle of
1 ligher Education this week.
Yet those close to Smith have sug
gested that Smith thought that it was
time to return to Stanford and that
the delay in the nomination process
was not the primary reason for his de
cision to step down.
During his tenure in Washington,
D.C., Smith has overseen the daily
management of the Department of
Education and has served as a chief
adviser on policy and budget issues to
Education Secretary Richard Riley.
According to colleagues, Smith
had announced that he would leave
Washington on prior occasions.
"This is the fourth time," said
Michael Kirst, professor of Educa
tion.
"I hope he is able to this time,"
Kirst said.
"If everything goes well," said
Richard Shavelson, dean of the
School of Education, "(Smith] will
teach a course on the History of

School Reform in spring quarter and
perhaps also an advanced seminar on
education reform policy."
Smith's return after seven years of
absence is much anticipated.
"Mike is a wonderful scholar,
leader and colleague," Shavelson
said. "He will return and teach grad
uate students on education policy,
conduct research and write a book on
standard based education reform.
"Inevitably, as a past dean, Mike
will also contribute to the larger Stan
ford environment in some leadership
capacity, and I suspect undergradu
ates will seek him out." Shavelson
said.
Kirst echoed Shavelson's senti
ments. "Smith would bring enor
mous scope to education since he has
been on top from kindergarten to
graduate school," Kirst said. "By
working on the federal scale, he has
dealt with every level of education.
He will surely return with valuable
connection and understanding."
Kirst added.
President Bill Clinton is expected
to announce a candidate to succeed
Smith in the near future.
