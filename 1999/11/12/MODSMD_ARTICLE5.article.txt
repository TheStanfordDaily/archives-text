## Egyptian high court member says ideology gives unstable base 
### Marianna Stacey Lopez 
Last night, approximately SO
people gathered in the psychology
building to hear Egypt's former
Chief Justice Muhammad Said al-
Ashmawy speak on the incompati
bility of ideology and democracy.
The speech was co-sponsored
by the departments of religious
study and history at Stanford as
well as by the Department of Reli
gious Studies & Bannan Institute
for Jesuit Education at Santa Clara
University.
To demonstrated the problems
that occur when merging ideology
and democracy, al-Ashmawy drew
on examples from his homeland.
Al-Ashmawy explained that
democratic ideas in Egypt are
heavily influenced by religious ide
ology.
This approach, al-Ashmawy
said, reflects a popular corruption
of passages from the Koran that
linked the Prophet (Muhammad)
to God. Al-Ashmawy claimed that
on Muhammad's death. Caliphs
wrongly proclaimed themselves to
be the deputies of the Prophet as
well as the deputies of God. Over
