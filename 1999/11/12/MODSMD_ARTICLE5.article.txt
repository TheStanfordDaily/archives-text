Last night, approximately SO
people gathered in the psychology
building to hear Egypt's former
Chief Justice Muhammad Said al-
Ashmawy speak on the incompati
bility of ideology and democracy.
The speech was co-sponsored
by the departments of religious
study and history at Stanford as
well as by the Department of Reli
gious Studies & Bannan Institute
for Jesuit Education at Santa Clara
University.
To demonstrated the problems
that occur when merging ideology
and democracy, al-Ashmawy drew
on examples from his homeland.
Al-Ashmawy explained that
democratic ideas in Egypt are
heavily influenced by religious ide
ology.
This approach, al-Ashmawy
said, reflects a popular corruption
of passages from the Koran that
linked the Prophet (Muhammad)
to God. Al-Ashmawy claimed that
on Muhammad's death. Caliphs
wrongly proclaimed themselves to
be the deputies of the Prophet as
well as the deputies of God. Over

time, this became an accepted tra
dition. Al-Ashmawy said such a
practice led to the transformation
of Islam into a corrupt political ide
ology.
"Government, having been en
dowed by this ideology with divine
qualities, was no longer a pure civil
charge hut became a sacred sacer
dotal office," al-Ashmawy said.
"From signifying and being a

the literal meaning of the Arabic
word, Islam was turned to signify
and be submitted] to any ruler."
he added.
Attempting to show the danger
of intertwining religion and poli
tics. al-Ashmawy made the claim
that ideology forcasts the end of
democracy by giving way to dicta
torship. To support this idea, he
cited Hitler's rise to power as an
example where political leaders

used the principles of democracy to
rise to power hut in the end created
a dictatorship.

'Government, having been
endowed by this ideology,
was no longer a pure civil
charge but became a
sacred sacerdotal office.'

Many in the audience found his
assumption that ideology cannot
exist in a democracy to he prob
lematic.
When pressed hy students to de
fend his conception of democracy,
al-Ashmawy did not answer the
question directly.
Rather, he referenced historical
examples, again referring to Na/i
Germany.

He said although members of
his government used their status to
ahuse prisoners and corrupt the
legal process, he utilized the law to
protect as many people as he could.
For many memhers of the audi
ence al-Ashmawy's answers were
unsatisfactory.
Senior Shaffique Adam said
"al-Ashmawy hasn't carefully
thought through his concept of
democracy. It seems very inipracti
cle. However, to his defense. al-
Ashmawy presents an agreeable
portrait of democracy's superiority
to dictatorship."
Senior Nauman Khan felt that
al-Ashmawy "thoughtfully chal
lenged historically held notions,
causing people to re-evaluate their
beliefs."
Although the question-answer
session with the former Chief Jus
tice was at times tense, visiting Re
ligious Studies Prof Ebrahim
Moosa summarized the evening as
"a valuable promotion of diversi
ty."
