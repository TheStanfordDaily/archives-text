# Double the pleasure, double the funds Partovi twins share their
## entrepreneurial expertise 
### Megan Knize Contributing writer 
Ali Partovi is smart. Last year, he
sold his Internet company. Link E
xchange Inc., to Microsoft for $250
million. And he's fun. He just bought
a red Volkswagen Beetle which he
sent to Los Angeles to be decorated
like the car in Austin Powers. Now
he works 30 hours a week as the Se
nior Product Manager at Microsoft.
But things weren't always this
easy for the IW4 Harvard graduate.
Last night, in a workshop called
"What it Takes to be an Entrepre
neur," Ali Partovi and his identical
twin brother. Hadi Partovi, shared
their entrepreuneurial secrets with
more than 160 eager business, engi
neering and undergraduate stu
dents.

"The key to success is not good
ideas," Ali Partovi said. "Really it's
perservcrance and hard work."
Ali Partovi graduated with bach
elor's and master's degrees in Com
puter Science, expecting to work as a
programmer fora few years before
starting his own company. But in
19%. he got an offer he couldn't
refuse and joined three Harvard
friends in a San Mateo condominium
to form Link Exchange Inc.
"We were a bunch of kids with an
idea," Ali Partovi said. "When we
started, I didn't know if we were
even running the business legally."
Link Exchange's vision was to
create a place that "helped the little
guy on the Web." Many small busi
nesses can't afford to advertise with
large companies, such as Yahoo, so
Ali Partovi's group created a banner
exchange network that enabled
Web sites to trade advertisement
space.
Ali Partovi worked seven days a
week, often sleeping in the condo
minium among the computers and
other exhausted workers.
"I remember there was one time
where I just worked straight through
the holidays. 1 missed Thanksgiving.
1 took three hours off for Christmas
dinner," Ali Partovi said.

But his dedication paid off. The
company doubled in revenue every
six weeks. Last year, Link Exchange
became Microsoft's third-largest ac
quisition and Ali Parvoti still does
some work with the Link Exchange
group.
His brother, Hadi Partovi, also
graduated from Harvard with bache
lor's and master's degrees in Com
puter Science and worked as the
group program manager for Mi
crosoft's Internet Explorer. Then he
left Microsoft to start a smaller com
pany, which he believed would be
more fun.
TellMe Networks is an "interac
tive phone service powered by the

Web that allows you to do things
over the Web that you would nor
mally do over the phone." Hadi Por
tovi explained.
And he likes the freedom ol
working fora smaller company. "It's
basically up to us to do whatever the
hell we want to do."
Portovi emphasized the impor
tance of managing and motivating
start-up employees to continue to
work hard. Coterminal engineering
student Horng-Jye Oh was particu
lary impressed with Hadi Portovi's
advice.
"Lots of people at Stanford speak
about start-ups, but [the Portovis'j
advice on motivating people was

very relevant." Oh said he will prob
ably get involved with a start-up
within the next five years.
The Portobi brothers believe that
motivation eonies from having fun
while working.
"We have lots of games at work."
Hadi Portovi said. "We try to have
one game for every six people. Right
now we have Nintendo 64, Sega,
ping-pong and more. It's really im
portant to have fun."
The brothers came to Stanford
through the Stanford Entrepre
neur's Challenge, which will award a
qualified team of students $25.(KH)
for presenting a promising business
plan this spring.
