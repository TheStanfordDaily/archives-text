an overview so you know which

the lining of the brain and spi
nal cord caused by a bacteria.
■ Symptoms: Fever, severe
headache, stiff neck, and
mental changes. Also possi
bly a flat red rash, particu
larly on the arms and legs.
■ Prevalence: Relatively rare
(there are 1.5 cases per 100,000
in the U.S. for all ages). But
between 1991 and 1997 the
number of cases among 15 to
24 doubled.
■ Seriousness: Meningococcal
disease can lead to death
within 24 hours.
■ Shot effectiveness: Moderate.
The vaccine is about 85"<>
effective against the strains of
bacteria it addresses. But it
doesn't protect against meningo
coccal type B, which accounts
for about 30% of the cases in
college students.
■ Recommendations: Public
Health experts recommend
that you consider having this
vaccine. Students may have a
greater potential risk due to
group living conditions.
Others at higher risk: those
traveling to high-incidence
areas and people with
weakened immune systems.

Hepatitis B
■ What it is: Hepatitis B is a
viral infection of the liver that
can lead to liver failure, liver
cancer, or death.
Symptoms: There may be
none, especially in infants or
young children, but it can also
bring on fever, abdominal
discomfort, nausea, vomiting
diminished appetite, or
jaundice.
Prevalence: Strikes about 5%
of adults in the U.S.; more in
other areas.
Seriousness: Potentially very
serious.
Shot effectiveness: Extremely
effective. This is the only
vaccine that can prevent a
sexually transmitted disease.
Recommendations: We strongly
recommend getting this shot,
especially for those at high
risk: people who are sexually
active, have multiple sex part
ners, are homosexual males,
have had a sexually trans
mitted disease (including
AIDS), those who are health
care workers, use injectable
drugs, or live in a household
with a hepatitis B carrier.
Cost: $35.00 per shot; you need
three.
What it is: Influenza, or "the
tlu", is a virus-caused respira
tory illness.
Symptoms: 1 ligh fever, severe
muscle aches, headache, and a
sore throat and cough.
Prevalence: Flu varies with the
season - it comes in winter and
early spring, and is relatively
common on campus then.
Seriousness: Can make you
feel terrible, but recovery is
usually complete in healthy
adults.
■ Shot effectiveness: It varies,
but usually is effective for
the strains in the vaccine.
■ Recommendations: For high
risk individuals: people with
asthma or other lung disease,
heart conditions, diabetes,
kidney problems or a
weakened immune system,
health care workers, and
anyone else who wants to
avoid getting the flu.
■ Cost: $18.00.
