KABUL. Afghanistan (AP) —The United Nations
imposed sanctions on Afghanistan 011 Sunday for refus
ing to hand over suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden,
prompting thousands of protesters into the streets of
Kabul shouting "Death to America"and stoning the
empty U.S. Embassy.
The sanctions took effect at midnight EST following
last-minute pleas from the ruling Taliban army. They are
intended to press the Taliban to deliver the Saudi exile to
the United States or a third country to stand trial on
charges of terrorism.
Protesters swarmed into the streets of the Afghan
capital, burning U.S. flags and shouting anti-American
slogans. They accused the United Nations of being a
"puppet" of the United States.
One young Taliban soldier, his head wrapped in the
traditional turban, shouted "long live Osama" — the
man the United States believes masterminded last year's
twin bombings of U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanza
nia that killed 224 people. Others shouted. "Osama is a
great Muslim!"
Hie mob of men. many of them wearing the tradi
tional turban, baggy pants and long shirt, tried to storm a

World Food Program office but was stopped by Taliban
soldiers who fired automatic rifles into the air.
They began their march at Pashtunistan Chowk, an
intersection in the heart of the city, and surged toward
the U.S. I Embassy, which has been empty for 10 years,
hut maintained by a small number of Afghan workers.
I he demonstrators picked up riKks and bricks and
hurled them at the giant black gate. Taliban soldiers
stood guard, preventing them from entering the grounds.
In a statement Saturday, the Taliban Foreign Ministry
urged the United Nations either to abandon sanctions or
postpone them "to give time for the solution of this prob
lem."
Ihe statement said the Taliban was ready for talks
with the United States. Washington has repeatedly
rejected Taliban offers for talks or alternatives to surren
dering bin Laden.
Hie I I.N. sanctions order all states to freeze the Tal
iban's overseas assets and ban (lights owned, leased or
operated by the T aliban from taking off or landing. An
exemption to the flight ban would be permitted for
humanitarian reasons or to allow the Islamic pilgrimage
to Mecca.
