Use of Web site to fight
plagiarism could under
mine Honor Code

Stanford's Judicial Affairs Office
is considering the use of a UC-
Berkeley-developed Web site—
plagiarism.org—to battle cases of
student plagiarism.
The site, which compares student
submissions to material in millions of
Web documents, has already been
used with relative success by IJC-
Berkeley's Office of Student Con
duct and a few UC-Berkeley profes
sors. Consequently a number of insti
tutions are looking at using it as part
of their own anti-plagiarism efforts
once it has gone beyond the pilot
stage.
Given the proliferation of Web
sites that offer databases of student
papers and other means of commit
ting plagiarism, it seems natural that
a Web based application should be
used to combat them. However, the
Office of Judicial Affairs should rec
ognize that plagiarism.org is not
going to benefit Stanford, and it
might even harm the relationship
between students and faculty.
To begin with, the rate of plagia
rism should be low at Stanford
already (at least in theory) because
students here agree to an Honor
Code binding them to honesty and
originality when writing papers.
Arguably it is naive to assume that
this campus is free of plagiarism.
However, would it be fair to institute
a technical and far-reaching device
for papers when all other academic
circumstances, including exams, are
also left to trust? If the University
were to use plagiarism.org, it would
be sending mixed messages about
the I lonor Code to students.
As teaching fellow Allison Katsev

suggests, the institution of a policy
that uses plagiarism.org may in fact
he a violation of the Honor Code.
As written in the "Applications
and Interpretations of the Honor
Code" adopted by the Student Con
duct Legislative Council, the Univer
sity prohibits professors from taking
"unusual and unreasonable precau
tions" in their academic procedures.
The widespread use of
plagiarism.org by professors would
break the "need for cooperation
between students and faculty in mak
ing the Honor Code effective."
Even if the Office of Judicial
Affairs limits the use of
plagiarism.org to its own specific
cases, it might have problems with
the apparent technical shortcomings
of the Web site.
For one, there is no way that the
site can be all-inclusive with its
database of student papers and aca
demic journals. If a student decides
to plagiarize, he or she could take
care to use a document that can't be
found by plagiarism.org.
One should also note that the Web
site is only as smart as its search algo
rithm and thus should never be used
in place of a person in the judgment
of a plagiarism case.
If professors at UC-Berkeley or
elsewhere rely on the electronic sub
mission of papers as a general check
against plagiarism, they are making a
grave mistake: clever students can
modify plagiarized documents with
relative ease to dodge patterns such
as the eight-word match used by pla
giarism.org.
Although the new Web site can be
a useful tool for larger universities, it
offers no real advantage to Stanford
students and faculty. The Office of
Judicial Affairs would do best to stay
away from such systems and make
do with methods that are more fitting
to the Honor Code.
