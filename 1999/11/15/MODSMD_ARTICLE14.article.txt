# The
						Upward Spiral
## Govind Dandekar The
						Summer in Review 
### 
The weather is get
ting colder, the
days are getting
shorter and the entire
campus has the flu. This
can only mean one thing:
the sun is burning out and
will explode within a few

short weeks. In light of
this, I have decided to write a column about
happier, sunnier times here at the Farm.
Therefore I present to you the summer of
1999 in review.
June 13, Commencement: Poet-Laure
ate Robert Pinsky surprises the audience by
deviating from his prepared notes and con
tinuously reminding the graduating class to
"wear sunscreen." In a stunning finale. Pin
sky vaporizes himself and then transforms
himself into an e-mail forward.
June 13. Departmental Ceremonies:
Graduating seniors break down in joyful
tears when they realize that in the real
world, acappella is about as popular as
Ebola and they will never be subject to it
again.
June 14. Noon: In an effort to discourage
excessive partying and all future alumni
donations, the University throws all gradu
ating seniors out of housing.
June 14,12:30 p.m.: In 30 short minutes,
Stanford is transformed from the world's
premier research institute to the world's pre
mier preadolescent golf and tennis camp.
June 15: A group of five students heads
to Blockbuster Video and tries to decide
whether they are in the mood to see "Like
Water for Chocolate" or "Army of Dark
ness." They leave six weeks later with eight

pounds of Orville Redenbacher popcorn
and a copy of "National Lampoon's Vegas
Vacation."
July 2: Residential Education announces
that the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity will
lose its house at 592 Mayfield because it did
not "fulfill the minimum membership
requirement." In a last-ditch attempt to
regain its house, the Dekes petition Resi
dential Education and give bids to three
Canadians, a woolly mammoth and a lawn
boy. Later that day, the University rejects
the Dekes' petition when Residential Edu
cation determines that the woolly mammoth
has been frozen in the Siberian tundra for
2(),(XK) years and thus cannot be a registered
Stanford student. The frustrated lawn boy
de-pledges and sub-leases an apartment in
Daly City.
Aug. 3: ESPN sports announcer Dick
Vitale finds out that incoming Stanford
freshman Casey Jacobsen has scored over
3,2(K) points in his high school basketball
career. Vitale gets so excited that he repeats
the phrase "Remember the name, Casey
Jacobsen!" more than 2(X),(KK) times in the
next 10 minutes.
Aug. 5: The University announces that
the West Wing of Green Library will be
open in October. Green was initially
destroyed 65 million years ago when two
asteroids from space slammed into the
earth and destroyed nearly all life. It has
been under constant construction since the
late Jurassic period. University officials
report that the "advent of opposable
thumbs" and the discovery of "electricity"
have significantly expedited construction.
In a bold new Construction Plan, the Uni-

versity expects to have at least two more
capital improvements completed over the
next 65 million years (two top candidates
are the Coffee House and the enormous
hole in my floor).
Mid-August: The Stanford Athletic
Department releases its mysterious and baf
fling "S2K: Stanford Football" ad campaign.
A mix of Terminator 2: Judgment Day and
Y2K, it immediately brings to mind two
questions: Are our football players actually
half-human, half-cyborg killing machines
sent back in time to assassinate John Con
ner? Or are they computer bugs that result
ed from a scarcity of plastics and integrated
memory circuits in the mainframe computer
industry 30 years ago? (Neither â€” our foot
ball players are highly trained student-ath
letes that have posted a very impressive 6-1
Pacific 10 Conference record).
Aug. 21: The aforementioned students
realize that they have yet to return the copy
of "National Lampoon's Vegas Vacation"
that is now two months overdue. One of
them heads to Blockbuster to return it. In
lieu of an excessive late fee, Blockbuster
demands seven years of indentured servi
tude and the poor guy's retinas.
And finally, in the sprit of the week:
Nov. 20: Stanford football crushes Cal in
the 102 nd Big Game.
Go laugh until it hurts at Gaieties. Go
cheer mightily at Big Game. And go book a
ticket to Pasadena. We're one win away
from the Rose Bowl.
