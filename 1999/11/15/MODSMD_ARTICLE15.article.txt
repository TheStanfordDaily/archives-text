Remembering Veterans Day
I wanted to inform everyone that Thurs
day. Nov. 11 was Veteran's Day. Most stu
dents would not have known this unless
they walked past the post office, where
they would have seen a small sign in the
window announcing that it was closed.
I was very disappointed to see that stu
dents were unaware of the significance of
the day and that there was no acknowledg
ment of it at all on campus.
Veteran's Day shows appreciation for
those courageous people who put their
lives on the line to ensure our safety. My
relatives were Holocaust survivors liberat
ed by American soldiers, my grandfather
served in the U.S. Navy and my father was
a medic durim> the Vietnam conflict, and it

saddens me to see Veteran's Day ignored
by everyone except the campus post office.

Blame for violence does not
rest on Cal fans alone
While I agree that not allowing the band
to directly make fun of Cal isn't a reason
able decision by the athletic department,
completely absolving Stanford fans of any
responsibility is not appropriate either.
In your editorial, "A misdirected poli
cy." you state,"And if anyone out there
believes this problem is not a direct result
of Cal student behavior, they are simply

wrong."
Not only is this inflammatory, but I
think The Daily has a very selective mem
ory. Some Stanford fans, just like some
(not most) Cal fans, go to unreasonable
extremes during every year of this heated
rivalry. Unfortunately, Stanford fans do
their fair share of contributing to problems
during and after the game.
There are many incidents of Stanford
fans going overboard during Big Game,
but I think we only need to look at last
year's Stanford-Connecticut men's basket
ball game to see that Stanford fans are also
subject to a mob mentality. During the
game, the Sixth Man Club called Khalid
El-Amin a "deadbeat dad." At many
points during that game, Stanford farts

crossed the line of poor sportsmanship.
The Sixth Man organizers formally apolo
gized to El-Aniin for that, which was the
right thing to do.
What's the difference between the last
four Big Games and the Connecticut
game? Stanford has won the football con
tests. If we (heaven forbid) ever lose
another Big Game, 1 wonder how our fans
will react. It's easy to blame problems on
the fans of the losing team. I only wish that
The Daily would have examined Stanford
more closely before asserting that there
would be no problems at the Big Game if
Cal students "grew up."
