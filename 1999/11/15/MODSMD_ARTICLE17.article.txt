## One down — Stanford one win from Rose Bowl 
### Ben Freda Editorial staff 
TEMPE, Ariz. — Stanford
opened the season with a devastat
ing 69-17 loss to Texas. Stanford has
the worst-rated defense in all of Di
vision I-A college football, ranked
one notch above the University of
Butfalo. Before the season, Stanford
was picked to finish ninth in the Pa
cific 10 Conference.

FOOTBALL
■ Saturday: Stanford (6-3,6-1 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) 50, ASli (5-5,4-3)
30.

But what was that sound coming
from the tunnel leading to the Stan
ford locker room after Saturday's
game at Sun Devil stadium? It was
yelling. Chanting. Celebration.
The chorus was unmistakable.
All together now: "It's the Big
Game for the Rose Bowl!"
Saturday, the Cardinal (6-3, 6-1
Pac-10) relied on an explosive of
fense and surprisingly tenacious de
fense to stuff Arizona State (5-5,4-3)
50-30 and snake sole possession of
the Pac-10 lead.
The Cardinal win, combined
with UCLA's surprising upset of co-
Pac-10 leader Washington, allowed
Stanford to climb into the driver's
seat for the Rose Bowl in Pasadena
Jan. 1.
"I got satisfaction from looking
around the locker room and seeing
the look on the faces of the guys
who, after the Texas game, felt just
awful," said quarterback Todd
Husak. "They said we couldn't, and
we have."
And Stanford did it in surprising
fashion: by relyini> as heavily on its

last-rated defense as it did on its
high-Hying offense in a 50-30 victory.
The Stanford defensive corps
turned in a scrappy performance, re
sponsible for rccoving three Sun
Devil fumbles, grabbing a pair of in
terceptions and producing nine cru
cial points for the Cardinal that,
more than anything else, deflated

Arizona State's balloon just as it was
set to lift off.
"I want these kids to get credit,"
Cardinal defensive coordinator
Kent Baer said, "because they work
hard and they are better than every
one thinks they are."

rated second in the nation, turned in

the sort of performance that the Car
dinal has come to expect from it.
churning out 3W yards. Senior quar
terback Todd I lusak went 20 for 35
for 311 yards, finishing with four
touchdown tosses. Senior wideout
Troy Walters led the way for the re
ceiving corps, netting seven catches
for 127 yards.

Early in the game, the Cardinal
offense could do no wrong.
Five minutes after the opening
gun. the Cardinal had already post
ed a 7-0 lead on a touchdown pass to
senior wide receiver Deßonnie
Pitts. Pitts, who finished the day
with five catches lor 40 yards, left
the game in the second quarter after

reaggravating an ankle sprain he
suffered three weeks ago against
use
Two possessions later, Husak
needed only two plays to put the
Cardinal ahead 14-3: one 22-yard
connection to sophomore fullback
Casey Moore and a 58-yarder to a
wide-open junior Dave Davis, who
sprinted 30 yards to the end zone.
But the most demoralizing play
for the Sun Devils came after the en
suing kickoff when quarterback
Ryan Kealy, under heavy pursuit
and falling on his back, flung the ball
just before he hit the ground. The
ball was batted at the line of scrim
mage and landed in the hands of se
nior nose tackle Andrew Currie,
who grabbed the ball and rambled
15 yards to the Arizona State 6 yard
line.
Husak needed only one play, a
six-yard squibber to Moore, to put
the Cardinal up 21-3.
The rest of the afternoon was
punctuated by big plays by the Stan
ford defense.
For intance: early in the third
quarter, the Cardinal had just gone
up 33-17 on a one-yard run by
Moore. With the Sun Devils begin
ning a drive, senior Mark Stock
bauer stripped a Sun Devil receiver.
Senior defensive end Willie Howard
picked up the loose ball and rambled
22 yards into the end zone to put
Stanford up 40-17.
"Give us some credit, please,"
Baer said of a defense that has at
some points this season been the
butt of jokes. "We're not a great de
fensive football team, but I think
we're a pretty good one. I think
we've done our part. I think we're
better than people give us credit
for."
