predictable win for the team.
"Kelly's a very complete player,"
head coach Steve Swanson said. "In
fact, she is probably the most com
plete player I have ever coached. Ii

in front of 2.000 people and at your
home field — she took all the drama
out of the game."
Before the game, the team con
vened in the locker room to discuss
the individual team goals the Cardi

oil a pass from senior midfielder
Ronnie I air. Adamson collected
the ball Irom l air and penetrated
the hapless Mustang defense to
score for the Cardinal before the
crowd had even settled in its seats.
"I don't know if they were even
really ready for that." senior co-cap
tain Jennifer (VSullivan said. "Kelly
had two great goals right away and
set the tone of the game."
Adamson's second goal, in the
11th minute of play. was. according
to Swanson, "the best goal of the
game." I ler goal came off an assist
from freshmen Marcia Wallis and
Becky Myers.
Five minutes later. Adamson
contributed to the team's scoring
tally with an assist to Wallis. Wallis
received a pass from Adamson and
dribbled past the defense to face the
goalkeeper one-on-one. Wallis gen
tly passed the ball into the corner of
the net. past the Mustang goalkeep
er.
With this goal, the Cardinal se
cured a comfortable 3-0 lead less
than 20 minutes into play.
The Cardinal held on to this lead
to ultimately defeat the Mustangs 3-

kick with 55 seconds to go in the
game.
