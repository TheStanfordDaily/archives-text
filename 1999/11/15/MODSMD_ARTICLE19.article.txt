■ Friday: Stanford <X.\ Lokomotiva
Kosice of Slovakia 52.

"Theie were a lot of good things
that we did and we're going to try
to look at those and build on those
and then eliminate some of the
turnovers that we had —just try to
work a little bit better as a team,"
said Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer.

The Stanford front court really
stepped up Friday night. Sopho
more forward Bethany Donaphin
dominated the paint in the first half
with 10 points and 10 rebounds.
She finished the game with 14
points. 14 rebounds and three
blocks in 20 minutes of play.
Junior forwards Carolyn Moos
and Sarah Dimson were also big
contributors. Moos had 12 points
and 12 rebounds for the game.
Dimson had 10 points, six re

bounds, two assists and two steals.
Cori Enghusen had a career
high 14 points, stepping up in the
second half when the game became
really physical.
"I've been getting in a lot of foul
trouble and it's been frustrating. I
felt like I wasn't really able to go
out and play." Enghusen said.
"This time I got in a little bit of foul
trouble, but I think, in the second
half, I was able to not quite foul as
much ... so I could just play."
"I was very pleased with Cori in
side. I thought [she) did a great job.
She was a huge presence inside, de
manding the ball and finishing,"
VanDerveer said. "I was really ex
cited to see Cori establish herself as
a low block presence."
The Cardinal controlled the
boards Friday with 54 rebounds to
Lokomotiva Kosice's 24. Offensive
rebounds led to 25 second-chance
points by the Cardinal, a huge im

provement from the 17 rebounds
and eight second-chance points in
the USA game.
VanDerveer said she was happy
that everyone got a chance to play
and contribute in Friday night's
game.
Senior guard Milena Flores had
eight points and five assists. Fresh
man guard Jamie Carey also con
tributed five assists, with a couple
of Pistol Pete Maraviche-like pass
es to Donaphin at the end of the
first half.
Sophomore Lauren St. Clair
was a strong force both on offense
and defense, with seven points, five
rebounds, two blocks and one steal.

The problems for Lokomotiva
Kosice began before the opening
whistle blew, with difficulties play
ing a recording of the Slovakian na
tional anthem.
The Slovakian team's frustra
tion continued to grow and the
team ended the first half with 10
turnovers and 15 fouls.
The Cardinal quickly interpret
ed and fought through the Slova
kian offense, which used two-man
screens on the baseline to set up
outside shots.
Hana Eliasova, who had 22
points against Washington, was
held to seven points by the Cardi
nal. Dagmar Hutkova was the lead
ing scorer for Lokomotiva Kosice
with 11 points.
Lokomotiva Kosice came out
extremely physical after halftime.
They finished the game with a team
total of 29 personal fouls, one of
which was a technical foul called
with 13 minutes, 29 seconds to go in
the second half.
"When it got kind of rough, I
subbed very liberally," Van-
Derveer said. "I thought people
came in and did a good job."
Lokomotiva Kosice's zone de
fense caused some problems for
the Cardinal late in the game. Van-
Derveer said the team's turnovers
were due mostly to inexperience
and the frequent substitutions.
"Some of the problems at the
end were maybe some people that
don't have a lot of experience.
We're playing a lot of different
lineups," VanDerveer said. "We
had a lot of different people con
tribute, and then it did deteriorate
a little bit but it got pretty physical
and kind of sloppy. We don't want
that to happen."
VanDerveer has said since the
beginning of the exhibition season
that the objective in playing these
games is to prepare the team for
the season ahead and give individ
uals the experience they need to
compete. Friday night's game was
another step in the journey which
will hopefully lead to the NCAA
Tournament.
