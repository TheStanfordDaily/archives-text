# Death of worker stirs up protest
## 
### Mariam Ali Contributing writer 
A "Memorial March and Rally
for Justice" will be held today in
White Plaza at noon in honor of
Daniel Jose Arroyo. 39, a Dining
Services worker in Florence Moore
Hall for 15 years, whose death has
sparked controversy between

I lousing and Dining Services work
ers and Dining Services manage
ment.
Arroyo died on Oct. 5. a few
hours after returning from work in
the dining hall. The Stanford
Workers Union claims that Arroyo
requested and was denied sick
leave by his supervisors. However.
Dining Services directors deny the

charge.
In a widely-circulated flyer, the
Union accuses Lida Horna. assis
tant director of Dining Services, of
telling Arroyo that he would be
"terminated" if lie missed another
day of work.
In response to the flier, Shirley
Everett, director of University Din
ing Services, issued a letter to all

Dining Services employees that
refers to the Union's accusations as
"grossly unethical and uncon
scionable." The letter also said it is
against Dining Services' policy to
deny workers sick leave.
Horna denies telling Arroyo
that he could take no more sick
leave.
i absolutely never told Daniel
or anyone else they could not go
home if they were sick," she said. "I
have been in the business for 20
years and 1 know better. But is it
not about being in the business, it is
about being human."
According to Keith Smith, Stan
ford manager of Labor / Employee
Relations, Horna would neither
know how many days Arroyo had
accrued nor be in a position to
grant or deny his request.
"She was not his immediate su
pervisor. Why would Arroyo go to
her?" Smith said. "And Daniel had
sick leave left. He was not a prob
lem employee; he did not have an
attendance problem.
"II he hud said he was sick and
asked for sick leave, I believe he
would have gotten it. There was no
reason for him to be denied."
Three of Arroyo's co-workers,
however, said Horna had a meeting
with Arroyo. They said he was
given a note advising him that he
was asking for too many days off.
"Lida and [Florence Moore
Dining Services Supervisor] Priscil
la [Raymond] told Daniel two or
three weeks before he died that he
was calling in sick too much. They
said, 'Do this again and you will be
fired,' " said a co-worker who
asked not to be named.
"I le was sick on the dav he died.
