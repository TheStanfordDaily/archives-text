■ Friday: No. 13 Stanford (2-0) 72
lowa (1-1) SN.

I he win gave the Cardinal the
championship of the Coaches vs.
Cancer IKON Classic, which also
featured No. I Connecticut and No.
10 Duke, who Stanford beat Thurs
day to advance to the title game.
Because of injuries to Jason the
past two seasons, the Collins twins
had played together in only 10
games during their three years at
Stanford. However, the absence of
Madsen. whose timetable for recov
ery has now been extended to 4-h
weeks, forced the Collinses to take
control of the game. Both posted
double-doubles, combining for 35
points and 22 rebounds.
"Jarron and Jason were too
much for them." said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery. "They're
going to be a problem for every
one."
The tandem's performance was
what Stanford (2-0) had been envi
sioning since the day the Cardinal
signed the heavily recruited tw ins al
most three years ago.
"We knew all along they would
make a significant impact." Mont
gomery said.
While the game basically
amounted to a coming-out party for
the Collins twins. Jarron, who was
named tournament MVP. said it did
not feel like anything new.
"We just played basketball," he
said. "We've been doing it since we
were six years old. We won as a
team. That's what's important."

Still, the emotional aspect of fi
nally having both brothers back on
the court and playing well together
was not lost on anyone.
"A lot of our fans, family and
friends are happy to see us both out
there." Jarron said. "It's been hard
for [Jason | off the floor the last two
years but we've supported him and
we'll keep supporting him."
While not a surprise, Jacobsen's
improving play gave Stanford an
other weapon to use in New York.
Jacobsen looked nervous and
light in his first exhibition games at
home. Hut under the bright lights of
the national stage, the freshman
gunner made his mark.
Jacobsen, who was ft of 9 from
the floor, did most of his work in the
second half in which he scored 13 of
his 17 points. At one point. Jacobsen
scored eight straight points for Stan
ford. sandwiching a jumper between
two long three-pointers.
"In the second half. Casey Jacob
sen hit some really big shots," Mont
gomery said.
Jacobsen's poised play stood in
contrast to the play of Duke fresh
man Jason Williams. Williams,
whose debut at point guard was
well-publicized, seemed to be trying
too hard in the Blue Devils' two
losses over the weekend. Jacobsen,
however, played well within Stan
ford's structured offense.
While it was originally thought
that Madsen would be back in uni
form in a matter of days, it now ap
pears that the team's fiery, emotion
al leader could be out for upward of
a month, missing Stanford's highly
anticipated matchup with No. 4
Auburn on Nov. 27. However, as
Jason Collins said. Stanford's well
worn system can survive the loss of
one player—even if it is Madsen.
"When he went down, even I
wondered how we would do, be
cause Madsen is our leader," Jason
said. "But we realized this is the
chance for each of us to step up and
help us win. The system's already in
place. It's just on the player to go out
there and do the best they can do."
The strength of the system was
most apparent against lowa. With a
completely different starting five
than the team featured last season.
Stanford pulled away from the
Hawkeyes (1-1) by staying within
the structure andrel\ iugon an over
all team effort.
The Cardinal controlled the
boards, establishing a 45-33 re
bounding advantage on the backs of
the Collinses and freshman Curtis

Borehardt. who pulled down eight
rebounds. Borehardt, who recorded
three blocks against Duke on Thurs
day. continued to show the effort
and intensity coaches hoped he
could contribute during Madsen's
absence.
After 24 Cardinal turnovers
helped Duke stay close against Stan
lord Thursday. Stanford was much
safer with the ball against lowa, es
pecially in the low post. While Stan
ford's inside players combined for
13 turnovers against the Blue Dev
ils. Borehardt and the Collinses had
only five turnovers Friday and the
team had only 15 total.
