## 
### Caitrin McKiernan 
Last Tuesday at 6 a.m., the Bob
kitchen was bustling, filled with lively
Stanford students cooking up batch
es of pancakes, hash browns and
si rambled eggs.
By 7:30 a.m.. they had loaded the
hot breakfast, along with fruit salad,
orange juice, condiments and uten
sils into their cars. Soon, they were
serving the breakfast to about 70
people gathered at the Urban Min
istry's drop-in center at the Palo Alto
( haptcr of the Red ( ross.
Tuesday is one of two days a week
when hot breakfast is served at the
drop-in center. The Urban Ministry
has no cooking facilities.
Boh is just one house participating
m the new breakfast program this
quarter. Different residences that
wanted to provide at least five stu
dent cooks. $30 to $50 in house
money lor ingredients and the use of
their kitchen, have signed up.
So far, students at houses includ
ing Enchanted Broccoli Forest,
Sigma Chi. Columbae, Synergy,
/.APand Bob have cooked breakfast
for those in need.
" The people love it," said organiz
er Elliott Campbell, a second-year
graduate student in Environmental
Engineering and a resident of EBE
"It's a real simple tiling. They get
food after being cold all night."
Campbell got the idea last year,
after befriending a homeless man.
"It made me want to get to know
more homeless people," he ex
plained. "I thought this was an easy
way to do it."
I ,ast year, he began organizing the
program and got together one cook
ing group.
"Elliott woke up maybe 15 people
at 6 a.m.," said junior Vanessa ( alli
son-Burch, a fellow organizer. "And
it was cool, so we talked about mak
ing it into a thing."
Now. there is a core group of peo
ple who cook and/or serve breakfast
each week, mainly residents of EBE
and Sigma Chi. in addition to resi
dents of that week's house.
" The number of people that
turned out for the cook is impressive
... [almost | more than any other Bob
event," Bob Resident Assistant
Megan Miekley. a senior, explained.
"()ftcn in a house, the draw groups
slick together, but this has been a
group effort."
Tuesday's breakfast cooking has
become known as the "Alternative
I lappy I lour" at T BI , said volunteer
Alexander Nixon, a senior and an

EBF resident. The name is a play on
EißF's weekly Happy Hour.
Campbell said the breakfasts at
the drop-in center are well-attended.
"When it starts, only 30 people
show up," said Campbell. "Then the
word gets out and there is a total of
50-70 people."
In addition to food, people also
seek other services, including getting
bus passes, mail, phone and message
services and toiletries. There are also
on-site caseworkers.
"It's nice to be full in the morning
with a nice, warm breakfast," said
Palo Alto resident Jacqueline Wells.
Wells comes to the Urban Ministry's
drop-in center for food and to get bus
passes to take her six-year-old
daughter to school.
People experiencing different lev
els of poverty benefit from the ser
vice.
()ne man at last week's breakfast,
who did not wish to be identified, said
although he has one job, it is not
enough to have a permanent home or
afford food. I le spends two to three
nights each week in a hotel. The rest
of the time he is on the street.
I le said, however, that some peo
ple are even worse off.
"This place is a wake-up call," he
said. "I am lucky I have one job."
"People come and enjoy a hot
meal." explained caseworker Clif
f< >i d I crrcll."Pet>ple really develop a
sense of community."
"I like the absence of any admin
istration," Terrell added. "It's really
hands-on."
()ften, after breakfast is served on
Tuesday, students preparing the
meals stick around and chat with the
people there.
Callison-Burch said last week a
man recognized her and asked how
her exams went.
" The week before [when 1 had an
exam| he had asked [others] where I
was," she explained. "I was totally
flattered."
"A lot of differences disappear
when people get to know each
other," Terrell said.
"We go to Palo Alto every day
and see these people," explained
Miekley. "We are lucky to have the
house ... the kitchen ... the food. If
it means getting up a couple of hours
earlier to share that with people who
don't have anything, it is worth it."
Anyone interested in helping
cook and / or serve can e-mail camp
belK«'leland. Next quarter, EBF
hopes to invite different freshman
dorms to their kitchen tocook break
fast.
