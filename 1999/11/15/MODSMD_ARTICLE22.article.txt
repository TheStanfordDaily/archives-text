# Online grape boycott voting begins today
## 
### Roger Kim Contributing writer 
Beginning today, a campus-wide
vote on the Grape Boycott will be
held online at http://www.stan
ford.edu/dept/resed. The vote will
last for a week until Nov. 19. Links
to the Web site will be provided on
cluster computers.
The vote results from the efforts
of the Grapes Education Commit
tee, a committee under the Office of
the Dean of Students. Each fall, the
Committee organizes special educa
tional programs on the grapes boy
cott throughout undergraduate res
idences and has promoted the vote
for the past three years.
The grapes issue roots from a stu
dent hunger strike that occurred in

1994. Five Stanford undergraduate
students protested the tiring of a
high-ranked Chicana administra
tion Qfficer, the potential budget cut
for El Centro Chicano and the slow
progress in establishing Chicano/a
Studies in the University's curricu
lum.
They also protested the audicnce
response to a United Farm Workers
video about the plight of migrant
grape farm workers shown at Sun
day Flicks. Some students in the au
dience shouted out racially offen
sive comments, to which the pro
testers demanded a University boy
cott of grapes.
That same year, University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper and former
Provost Condoleezza Rice came to
a formal agreement with the pro

testers to "recommend change to
the University's present policy on
grapes."
A grape boycott would prohibit
the University from purchasing any
non-United Farm Workers table
grapes. United Farm Workers is
currently calling for a ban on cancer
and birth-defect causing pesticides
used in growing grapes. They are
also demanding free and fair union
elections and just contract negotia
tions in all California farms.
Stanford's boycott vote also em
phasizes the human rights of the
grape workers, supporting the
movement for better working and
living conditions for the laborers.
The vote aiso in effect gives stu
dents, rather than University offi
cials, full power in deciding whether

to keep grapes off their tables.
Student response on the grapes
vote varies.
A senior who wished to remain
anonymous said. "I don't think
grapes are an issue anymore. The
original purpose of the boycott has
been blurred so much that now it
seems to be an issue just for the sake
of it. Every other produce fruit has
the same issues. Why are we keep
ing this one special?"
Freshman Sarah lmhoff, howev
er, said, "Better food variety in our
dining halls is not worth the health
and safety of even one farm work
er."
The results of the vote will be re
ported by Nov. 24 and the decision
will be given to University Dining
Services and kitchens by Nov. 29.
