# Library relocation leaves Meyer empty
## Media services, video recordings, books moved to Green basement 
### Amy Christeson 
Students no longer have to
swipe their ID cards before enter
ing J. Henry Meyer Library, be
cause there are no books for them
to check out.
This quarter, Stanford libraries
are engaged in a game of book
swapping. Meyer Library no longer
carries circulating publications, re
quiring students to go to Green Li
brary for all of their non-computer
research.
Not only have the books from
Meyer been moved, but also most
of the media center materials have
been moved to Green as well.
Media materials, videos and
recordings, books and librarians
from the first-floor reserve desk in
Meyer have all been relocated to
the basement of Green Library,
and the moving isn't done.
The lfvmm films that are still lo
cated in Meyer will be transferred
after the renovation of Green's
basement is complete.
Completion of this renovation is
planned by the end of fall quarter,
but may last until the period be
tween fall and winter quarters.
According to library worker
Dave Hsu, "the books are not com
ing back," contrary to many stu
dents' beliefs.
This upheaval of the library sys
tem has caused some confusion
among students. Jochen
Kleinknecht, a Ph.D. student in
Engineering Economic Systems

and Operations Research, said that
for his Arabic class he has "given
up watching the videos, because
nobody knows where they are.
They are in transition."
This transitional period is caus
ing the most confusion for people
who have been around Stanford for
more than a lew years: the books
are all in new locations.
Freshmen, however, express
more apathy because they have not
been here at Stanford long enough
to know the difference.
"It just seems like a lot of space
is being wasted in Meyer," fresh
man Bart Watson said.
Hsu said he feels people are
more receptive and less frustrated

once they find out about the
change 1 .
Many students are unaware that
language lab materials are now
being checked out from the second
floor of Meyer and all reserve ma
terials are now at Green.
Freshman I .aura Johnson said it
doesn't make sense "to have media
materials in one place and all of the
equipment to use it in another."
According to library officials,
however, all of the viewing equip
ment will be transferred to Green
as soon as enough space is avail
able.
Academic computing services
and facilities will continue on the
second floor of Meyer Library.

This includes computer clusters,
language labs, classrooms and dub
bing instruments.
Hsu said they ma) Be adding
even more services in fhe future.
There are people at the library
currently "focusing on streaming
projects to try to help stream
movies or clips for some classes [on
the Internet]," Hsu said.
As Meyer changes its focus to
computing services, administrators
must decide how to use the now
empty first and third floors.
There is much talk about how to
utilize this space — such as opening
a "Cyber Cafe" on the first floor —
but it is still, according to Hsu, "all
up in the air."

Plans are still in the works for what will be done with empty space in Meyer Library, now that media and
other services have been moved to Green Library.
