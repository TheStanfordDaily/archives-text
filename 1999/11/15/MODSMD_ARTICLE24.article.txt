# Stanford win, Washington loss place Cardinal atop Pac-10 race

TEMPE, Ariz. â€” "First of all," senior wideout Troy
Walters said after Saturday's victory at Arizona State,
"I'd like to thank UCLA."
Stanford knew that Saturday's game against the Sun
[Devils was going to be big. To keep its far-fetched Rose
Bowl dreams alive, the Cardinal could not afford to lose.
But because scrappy UCLA was able to reverse its
miserable fortunes this year and pull out a 23-20 victory
against Washington in overtime Saturday, the Cardinal
victory began to mean much more: the Rose Bowl.
More specifically, if Stanford can beat California next
week, the Cardinal will be heading to Pasadena for the
Rose Bowl for the first time since 1971.
"I love it," said senior center Mike McLaughlin.
"Who'd have thought, after going 3-N and being picked
for last? I didn't believe that, but l didn't think we'd be this
good."
Before Saturday's game, Washington and Stanford
were tied for first place in the Pacific 10 Conference. But
because the I luskies beat the Cardinal two weeks ago, all
they had to do was to win their last two games against con
ference doormats I J( I A and Washington State to go to
the Rose Bowl.
Few thought that would be a tough proposition. Be
fore Saturday's game, UCLA was on a three-game skid
during which the team had been outscored 105-14. Before
Saturday, the Bruin defense had allowed the team's pre
vious nine opponents 30.5 points per game.
But the Bruin defense stepped up to the plate in the
second hall agianst Washington, allowing the Huskies
only three points.
In overtime, Washington was threatening on UCLA's
16-yard line. But senior Marques Tuiasosopo's third-and
-15 pass was intercepted by Joey Strycula. Four plays later,
the Bruins won on a 22-yard field goal by Chris Griffith
that gave them a 23-20 victory.
luiasosopo, who had looked like a god when he
passed for more than 300 yards and rushed for more than
200 yards against Stanford, was held to 12 of 25 comple

tions for 134 yards and only 15 yards on the ground.
News of Washington's loss began to sift its way down
the Cardinal sideline during the first quarter with Stan
ford ahead 14-3.
"Things got a lot more intense when we found out."
said senior tackle Willie Howard. "But we were fired up
when we walked on the field. This was as hvped up as we
had been all season."
The fact that the most important game for Stanford
football in nearly 30 years is against Cal seems to be poet
ic justice.
"We'd be happy if we clinched agains the Sisters of the
Poor, but it makes Big Game something special," said
head coach Tyrone Willingham. "That, going into the
next century, it could decide who goes to the Rose Bowl
makes it extra special."
"They will have a great deal of incentive to knock us
off," he said. "We also take a great deal of incentive going
into the game."
