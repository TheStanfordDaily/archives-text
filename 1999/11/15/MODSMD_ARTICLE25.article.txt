### Mary Cobb Editorial staff 
When athletes stand in their start
ing positions, thcv cannot worry
about the possibility that their bodies
might give out on them part way
through their competition.
They have to assume that their
bodies will remain strong when the
pain becomes almost unbearable and
that every movement they make will
be as efficient as the movement be
fore.
So. how do you think the Stanford

women's swim team felt when they
had to lake the starting line this past
Friday, knowing that they had just
broken down their bodies over the
last few weeks with intense training?
WOMEN'S SWIMMING
■ l ridav: No. 3 Stanford 170.5, Uni
versity of British Columbia 78.5.
Some people might have been
scared to take the line; scared to see
when and how their bodies would be
tray them.
Not the Stanford's women swim

mers though. They entered their Fri
day meet against University of
British Columbia knowing that, as
Jessica Foschi explained, "we had a
really hard week in our training
cycle," and came out winning the
meet 170.5 to 78.5.
Sophomore Shelly Ripple and ju
nior Siobhan Cropper led the way for
the Stanford women, each winning
three events. While ("ropper won the
50 and 100-meter freestyle and the
1(H) buttertly. Ripple secured wins in
the 1(H) and 200 backstroke, (with
times of 56.39 and 2:00.63, respective

ly). and the 200 individual medley,
with a time of 2:02.42. She felt that re
cent training is improv ing the aerobic
fitness of the team.
"We were all able to bring our
races home, which shows that the
training is helping the team gel more
aerobically fit. None of us died in any
of our race."
Sophomore Jessica Foschi, al
though feeling a little sick this week,
was able to win the I.(KK) and 500
freestyle, while also improving her
500 freestyle season best time from
4:54.12 to 4:51.63.
"1 did not feel on top of my game.
But, the team was overall really
happy, even though we had a hard
week in our training cycle."
Sophomore Alexis Oakland
stepped up last Friday, placing sec
ond in both the 200 and 100 back
stroke with times 0f2:06.46 and 59.25.
She also improved both of her season
best times in these events, with the
most impressive drop being in the 200
back, where she broke her month-old
previous best time of 2:12.04.
Senior Gabrielle Rose and junior
Misty I lyinan both contributed to the
Stanford domination, with Rose win
ning the 1(H) and 200breaststroke and
1 lyman winning the 2(K) freestyle and
200 butterfly.
While the women may not have
felt their best going into their meet
Friday, they at least proved to them
selves that they have the ability to
perform at a supreme level even
when they are not physically pre
pared to perform their best.

Misty Hyman, shown here in the third leg of the 400 medley relay, won two events this past Friday as the
Stanford women's swim team proved to the Unversity of British Columbia that they are capable of dom
inating even in times of intense training.
