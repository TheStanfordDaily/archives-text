# Men avenge loss to UBC
## Cardinal swimmers capture dual meet from Canadian squad 
### kellie Wiginton Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's swim team
did what it set out to do on Friday
against the University of British Co
lumbia.
In a convincing 175-87 win, the
Cardinal won 11 of the 14 events,
proving that its loss three weeks ago
to ÜBC in Vancouver was not a reli
able indicator of the team's true ca
pabilities.
" This is kind of what we were ex
pecting after the College Cup," said

junior Adam Messner. "This time we
had our full squad working together."
MEN'S SWIMMING
■ Friday: No. 1 Stanford 175, Uni
versity of British Columbia K7.
In the previous meeting between
these two teams at the College Cup in
Canada, ÜBC left with a first-place
finish over Stanford. The Cardinal,
however, had been divided into two
teams to gain more racing opportuni
ties.
Although Stanford was pleased

with its overall performance at the
College Cup, the division of the team
did not allow the Cardinal to display
its most competitive combination of
relay teams and individual event
swimmers.
Stanford not only had the chance
to show its best teams on Friday, but
it also had the opportunity to show
the depth of that talent, with Stanford
swimmers consistently finishing in
the top three places in the events.
"Our depth really showed itself at
this meet," Messner said. "We took a
lot of fourth-, fifth- and sixth-place
finishes, as well as the first- place fin
ishes. [British Columbia] was lucky to
get people in the top three places of
events."
Messner remained a consistent
contributor, winning both the 1(X)-
meter freestyle and the 1,000
freestyle, as well as the 100 butterfly.
"My goal going into the meet was
pretty much just to race and to be as
competitive as possible, not really to
win," Messner said.
Aside from his obvious excite
ment of the Cardinal's win over
ÜBC, Messner was also thrilled to
have another opportunity to swim
against Canadian Mark Johnston.
"Last time we swam against them,
[Johnston] beat me a couple times,
and it sort of fueled a fire," Messner
said. "It felt really good to beat him
this time."
Other brilliant performances
were turned in by junior RobCanales
and freshman Randall Bal, who each
won two events. Canales won both
the 100 breaststroke and the 2(X)
breaststroke, while Bal dominated in
the 50 freestyle and the 2(K) back
stroke.
In the three events Stanford didn't
win, it followed closely with second
and third-place finishes. IJBC's Mark
Versfeld won the 1 (K) backstroke,
while Stanford's Dan Wescott, Mark
Siebert and Brad Kleinjans finished
in second, fourth and fifth.
