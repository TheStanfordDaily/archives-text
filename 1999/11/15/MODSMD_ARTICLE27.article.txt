Based oil record, it seemed Ari
zona would present the most formi
dable challenge of the weekend for
the Stanford women, but surpris
ingly it ended up being an un
ranked ASU squad that gave the
( ardinal the biggest test. In a hard
fought four-game match in Tempe
on Friday, Stanford was able to pull
out a 15-11,15-7, 13-15,15-13 victo

ry, but not before getting a scare
from the Sun Devils.
Maybe it was the desert heat or
the long flight or the supposed infe
riority of their opponent, but for
whatever reason, the Cardinal
squad was just not clicking in the
opening minutes of its match
against ASIJ. It took a 7-0 deficit
and a scoring drought of 11 minutes
before Stanford finally woke up
and realized the Sun Devils came
to play.
Regaining their composure he
hind the offense of freshman out
side hitter Logan Tom. Stanford
was able to rally to win games one
and two. but Arizona State did not
go quietly. The Devils came roar
ing back to take a hotlv contested
game three with a kill by sopho
more outside hitter Jami Coughlin
on the eighth game point. Stanford
responded by winning game four to
take the match and give coach Don
Shaw his 500 th career win. but not
before also giving him a few heart
palpitations.
Solid defense for the Cardinal
made the difference in the win.
with Stanford tallying a season
high 20 blocks, the third highest
total by a Pac-10 team this season.
Sophomore middle blocker Tara
Conrad alone contributed a sea
son-high 13 blocks to go with II
kills. Tom dominated offensively

for the Cardinal, tallying 24 kills for
a .378 attack percentage, while se
nior outside hitter Kerri Walsh
added her own season-high eight
blocks in addition to 11 kills and 14
digs. Junior setter Lindsay Kagawa
nearly reached a career high in as
sists, falling one shy with 61 on the
night.
Taking with them the lessons
learned against ASU, Stanford
made sure not to come out lethar
gic in its match against Arizona
Saturday evening. A more focused
Cardinal was able to take apart the
Wildcats 15-8. 15-13, 15-11. Stan
ford continued its domination of
the net with 14 blocks to push its
total for double-digit blocks to 18
on the season. Junior middle block
er Jen Detmer was a large factor in
this total, notching a match-high 1 I
blocks of her own on top of nine
kills. Walsh and Tom paced the
Cardinal offensively with 12 kills
apiece, while senior outside hitter
Sarah Clark contributed eight kills
and eight digs in one of her best
outings of the season. Walsh, prov
ing she can do it all, had yet anoth
er outstanding all-around game
with 16 digs and five blocks on top
of a .500 attack percentage.
Arizona junior middle blocker
Marisa Da Lee and freshman out
side hitter Lisa Rutledge had nine
kills each in the losing effort.
