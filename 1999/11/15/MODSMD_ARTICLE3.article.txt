# Teach-in speakers call WTO corrupt

A crowd of more than 70 Stan
lord students gathered in White
Plaza Friday afternoon for a teach-in
regarding the World Trade Organi
zation's effect on the environment
and indigenous peoples world-wide.
The rally, sponsored by the Red
wood Action Team at Stanford,
sought to mobilize support for an up
coming protest at the third-annual
WTO Ministerial Conference Nov.
30 in Seattle.
The WTO is an international
trade organization that regulates the
rules of trade between nations. Its

"main function is to ensure that
trade flows as smoothly, predictably
and freely as possible." according to
a WTO statement of purpose.
Speakers at the teach-in ex
pressed a different view on the
WTO. painting it as an internally
corrupt organization and a tool of
multinational corporations.
"1 consider the WTO our biggest
threat to democracy ever, and I
don't think that an understate
ment at all." said speaker Marty
Stenflo. a Santa Cruz native. "The
most important thing to the WTO is
the world market. I he environment,
people and food are all secondary to
the market."

Stenflo also described the make
up of WTO members, saying. "Peo
ple in the WT() are white males. It is
a racist, sexist organization, and it is
our right to shut them down."
Other speakers at the teach-in
echoed these sentiments.
"The WTO is subverting every
single aspect of our judicial system,"
said Patrick Reinsborough of the
Rainforest Action Network. "Dis
covery. the right to face your accuser
and the right to appeal are nonexis
tent under the WT()."
Teri Shore of the Sea Turtle Pro
ject spoke about the \\ I ()'s adverse
affects on the environment, focusing
on populations of sea turtles. She

said the WT() is refusing to mandate
"trap doors" on shrimp trolling nets
for all nations, even though such de
vices are mandatory in the United
States. These trap doors would save
sea turtles from being caught by
shrimp fishermen, a fact she claimed
is being ignored by the WTO.
She echoed a common theme
throughout the teach-in: environ
mental laws of the United States are
in danger of being repealed by the
WTO.
"Eighty percent of our regulatory
laws can be overturned bv the
WTO." said Stenflo. "They have
supreme authority over our deci
sions."
Aimee Christensen. a second
year Law School student and former
employee of the International Cen
tre for Trade and Sustainable Devel
opment. had a different take on the
WTO.
"Right now, there are a lot of
flaws with the WTO." Christensen
said. "But I think people seem to
think of it as the bogeyman, and that
problems will just disappear if we get
rid of it. It appears that governments
are going to keep the WT(). and we
need to work within the system to re
form it. Governments, not corpora
tions. run the WTO. If you want
things to change, you need to talk to
Washington."
All speakers at the teach-in
agreed that the upcoming WTO
ministerial conference is going to be
an important event in determining
the future of the organization. The
four-dav conference will meet to de
bate trade laws and "launch major
new negotiations to further liberal
ize international trade." according
to the WTO.

shaping up to he the protest of the
eentury." said Reinsborough. "We
need to shine a light on the WTO,
and Seattle is our opportunity. We
must show that the WT() is the gov
ernment ol the corporations, by the
eorporations and lor the eorpora
tions."

lieved it was a sueeess, and that peo
ple who previously knew little about
the WTO were able to learn more
about it.
"I think the speakers eonveyed a
strong message about the WTO,"
said Nina Robertson, a member of
RATS and a eo-organizer of the
teach-in. "A lot of people told me
after the teach-in that they were in
spired to learn more about the
WT(). and that they would research
it further."
