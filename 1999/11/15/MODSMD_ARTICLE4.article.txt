# Original sketch called racist, sexist
## Council approves new frosh T-shirt design 
### Meredith Rowe Editorial staff 
A new design for the Class of 2(K)3 T-shirt was chosen during a special
meeting of the Freshman Council Friday. The decision came after numerous
negative responses arose in response to last Wednesday's approval of the first
design, which featured a James Bond theme with the words "The name is Ford
... Stanford." and various members of the Bond crew, including scantily-clad
Bond Girls. Oddjob. an Asian man as representative of Goldfinger and oth
ers.
"We received an overwhelming number of responses by members of the
community and class who were offended by the perceived racist and sexist
tones presented in the shirt." s;iid sophomore Erin Vargo, a Freshman Coun
cil coordinator.
"We weren't looking at it through the point of reference of the entire class,
and that's where the problem arose," she added.
In an e-mail sent to the IJjamaa House list, freshman Alexis Wallen. Uja
maa Freshman ( ouncil representative, said many were upset by the "lack of
minorities and believable women (as in. women who do not look like Barbie
and wear short, tight skirts) in the shirt design."
According to Vargo. the Freshman Council initially chose two designs. The
first featured the Bond theme, and the second depicted a group of students
with letters on their shirts spelling out "Stanford."
The artist, freshman Flaine Chao.said she had originally turned in a sketch
that most resembled the second design the council received, but that the coun
cil asked her to alter it by incorporating the Bond theme.
"My first sketch wasn't [like the Bond design] at all." she said. "But that's
what they asked me to do."
I he end product was a combination of the two themes, resulting in the de
sign voted upon and chosen last Wednesday night by the nearly 40-member
council.
"The shirt was approved by a majority of the council," Vargo said. "We
didn't foresee that it would be a problem."
Freshmen first saw the design, copies of which were given to Freshman
C ouncil representatives of all dorms, at house meetings held Wednesday.
Sophomore Marisa Rolland. another Freshman Council Coordinator,
added that she was "shocked and dismayed" to hear the negative reaction that
followed.
"There were a lot of people in my house who were offended," Wallen said.
"And it wasn't particularly what I would have chosen."
In an e-mail sent to the Black Student Union list Friday, senior Elsa Pear
son said she was inspired to write a letter to the council as well.
