## Cockpit voice recorder recovered 
### 
NEWPORT, R.I. (AP)_ inves
tigators began working on the cock
pit voice recorder from Egypt Air
Flight 990 Sunday, hoping the sec
ond so-called black box retrieved
from the ocean floor would help
explain the airliner's mysterious
plunge from the skv.
Alter a two-week search, the
recorder was found Saturday night
by a remote-operated robot, and on
Sunday it was delivered to National
Transportation Safety Board head
quarters in Washington.
NTSB Chairman James I lall said
scientists would begin analyzing the
recorder immediately to see if its
tape was damaged by the destruc
tion of the plane or by its lengthy
submersion at a depth of 250 feet.
"I think within the next 24 hours
we will be able to characterize the
contents on the tape," I lall said.
Civil aviation officials from Egypt
and Arabic linguists from the State
Department were available to help
translate any cockpit conversations
in Arabic, I lall said.
It the tape is badly damaged, it
will likely be taken to its manufac
turer. where more sophisticated
equipment could be used to pick up
sounds. I lall said.
The New York-to-Cairo jetliner
crashed off Massachusetts' Nantuck
et Island on Oct. 31, killing all 217
people aboard.
Preliminary data from the plane's
flight data recorder showed that the
Boeing 767's autopilot was switched
off and the plane was put into a dive
so steep and fast that passengers

would briefly have felt weightless.
And both engines were shut off
before the aircraft climbed briefly
out of its dive and then turned and
dropped into the ocean.
Barry Schiff, a former TWA 767
pilot from I.os Angeles and current
ly an aviation accident investigator,
has said the data shows that some
human factor was responsible rather
than some system failure.
Investigators hope the voice tape
will reveal cockpit conversations or
mechanical sounds that will shed
light on those events.
"We're certainly hopeful that
within the next two or three days
that we'll be able to answer a lot of
the puzzling questions that the infor
mation on the flight data recorder
has raised in our minds." Hall said.
An Egypt Air official said the
cockpit voice recorder records over
its tape every 30 minutes, unlike the
two-hour digital models recom
mended by the NTSB. The tape
should have lasted long enough to
record conversations as the plane
climbed to its cruising altitude of
33.000 feet and then plummeted
about 40 minutes after takeoff.
The head of the FBl's Boston
office. Barry Mawn. said more than
250 FBI agents had conducted sev
eral hundred interviews related to
the crash, but that there was no evi
dence yet that a crime had been
committed.
I lowever. if it becomes apparent
that a crime occurred, Mawn said,
the FBI would take over as the lead
agency in the crash investigation.
