# Medicare spending dips for first time
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —Medi-
care spending dropped slightly in
fiscal year 1999. the first decline
ever in the federal program that
pays health care bills for 39 million
Americans, government figures
show.
New statistics from the Treasury
Department show that Medicare
expenditures fell 1 percent to $212
billion in the fiscal year ending Sept.
30. from $213.6 billion in the prior
year.
Experts attributed the drop to
cuts mandated by Congress, more
careful billing practices by health
care providers and a crackdown on
fraud. But they said that Medicare
spending is unlikely to continue
tailing because the elderly popula
tion is growing.
"No one should expect a contin
uation of an actual drop in Medi
care expenditures," said Robert
Ball, a former Social Security
Administration commissioner who
helped start Medicare, the federal
health care insurance program for
people 65 and older and for the dis
abled.
"The big story is that there is
good reason now to hope for a rate
of increase well below the average
of 10 percent a year of the recent
past." Ball said.
Treasury Department figures
show that payments from the feder
al hospital insurance fund, the
biggest Medicare outlay that covers

inpatient hospital bills, fell 4 per
cent from $135 billion in fiscal year
1998 to $129 billion this year.
Cut imposed by Congress in
1997 to help balance the federal
budget cut some payments to
health care providers.
White House and congressional
negotiators agreed last week to
restore $11 billion in payments
after intense lobbying by health
care groups who argued that the
1997 cuts went too far.
The other major Medicare
expense — payments from a sup
plementary fund that covers doc
tors' office visits and outpatient
care — rose to $79 billion this year
from nearly $75 billion in 1998.
The government also spent
more to fight fraud and abuse in
the program, shelling out $742 mil
lion this year for anti-fraud mea
sures compared to $608 million in
1998. Medicare lost about $12 bil
lion to fraud, waste and mistakes in
1998.
More federal oversight may
have contributed to the drop in
Medicare spending because hospi
tals and doctors may be cleaning
up billing mistakes and following
federal rules more closely.
But Ball said it is not realistic to
think that the slight drop recorded
in overall spending in 1999 will
continue because millions of baby
boomers will be joining the pro
m-am in coming years.
