DUZCE, Turkey (AP) — Res
cue workers from 23 different coun
tries poured into Turkey and joined
thousands of soldiers Sunday in a
massive effort to save people
believed buried beneath the rubble
of Friday's earthquake. The tem
blor killed at least 374 people and
injured 3.000 others.
I'urks signaled motorists Sunday
to shut off their engines in one part
of a quake-stricken town so a res
cue team could listen for the cries of
a child buried beneath slabs of con
crete. A block away, the newly
homeless lined up for blankets and
food.
Emergency crews and volunteer
organizations say the organization
ol the relief efforts stands in con
trast to the aftermath of the devas
tating Aug. 17 temblor, when relief
teams wandered through the quake
zone with little idea where their
help was needed.
But they add that many basics
including food, tools and maps are
still in short supply.
"Some things are better." said
German rescuer Britta Kdinger,
returning to camp after a day of
guiding her black German shep
herd sniffer, Arisha, through col
lapsed buildings.
She said a crisis center was estab
lished within hours of the quake to
help coordinate efforts, but she

quickly added that her team had to
wait a day until they received maps
of the city.
With temperatures plunging and
chances of survival beneath the
piles ol rubble decreasing with
every passing hour, the official
death toll was expected to rise in
the coming davs.
But there was still hope.
In one section of town. Turkish
rescuers pulled Saziye Bulut from
beneath a collapsed five-story
building, where she had been
trapped for 41 hours.
I'he head of the relief team that
saved her burst into tears after her
rescue.
"This is the happiest day of my
life," said Turgut Ozdemir. "I will
not forget this moment until the
end of my life."
In another area, rescuers tried to
find a child believed buried under
the rubble, but they later concluded
that the cries were misheard. There
was no trapped child.
Delays in identifying crisis areas,
however, left some rescue teams
pacing the crisis center.
"We came last night and we
wanted to help, but there is no orga
nization." said Armenian relief
worker Sergei Doshoyan. "We
want to help you." he repeated to a
Turkish journalist — a reminder of
the deep tensions that still exist

between the neighboring countries.
I he efforts came as President
Clinton left Washington on Sunday
lor a state visit in Turkey. He also
will participate in a European sum
mit in Istanbul. I urkey's biggest
city, then visit Greece. Italy, Bul
garia and Kosovo before returning
home Nov. 23.
"This second earthquake was
much more severe than we had
originally thought." Clinton told
reporters aboard Air Force One.
"It will be very much on the minds
of the Turkish leaders and the
Turkish people and we'll try to be
sensitive to that."
Achim Mullar. heading a 2 1 )-
person German team digging
under a collapsed apartment build
ing. commended the Turkish army
for its speed in leading his army
team to the site — but it took
another 12 hours for their equip
ment to arrive.
'"It's not smooth," he said as he
watched his team monitor knock
ing sounds deep into the crush of
concrete.
Turkish volunteers attributed
what improvement there was to a
change in attitude by a government
that was sharply criticized in the
press and on the streets for its slow
response to the August quake,
which left more than 17,000 people
dead.

DECATUR. 111. (AT) — A
standoff over the expulsion of six
black students for fighting continued
Sunday as the Rev. Jesse Jackson led
a chanting group of some 2,(HH> peo
ple through the streets of this blue
collar town and threatened to stage
mass arrests unless the dispute ends
soon.
Jackson told the crowd that he
would visit the schools Tuesday
morning to demonstrate and force
authorities to arrest him. He asked
how many would be willing to join
him in jail, and hundreds of people
raised their hands.
"On Tuesday morning, we're
going to cross the line," he said. "If
Dr. (Martin Luther) King could doit
in Birmingham ... and (Nelson)
Mandela could do it in South Africa,
we can do it in Decatur."
Decatur School Board President
Jackie Goetter said Sunday night
that she knew nothing about Jack
son's deadline or his threat of further
demonstrations.
"I just hope he would think about
that." she said. "1 just think it would
be very unfortunate."
The marchers, many of whom
came by the busload from out of the
area, chanted. "Save the dream, save
the children, reclaim the children."
and "Leave no child behind, keep
hope alive."
With that the throng began its
slow march from the Decatur Civic
Center to Mac Arthur High School,
singing "We Shall Overcome."
Jackson invited onlookers to join
in the march, his latest effort to draw
attention to the expulsions, which he

considers unfairly harsh.
The six students were expelled
for two school years after allegedly
taking part in a brawl in the stands
at a football game Sept. 17. A sev
enth withdrew from school during
expulsion hearings. I lie students
are black, but Jackson lias said it
was not a question of racism but
whether the students were treated
fairly.
Jackson led a similar march Nov.
7. demanding that the students be
returned to the classroom. Decatur
high schools were closed the next
two days after school officials
leared trouble because of Jackson's
presence.
In the meantime. Gov. (leorge
Ryan stepped in to negotiate an
agreement. At his prodding — and
under a national spotlight — the

local school board voted to trim the
expulsions to one school year and
let the students attend alternative
education programs.
Hut Jackson wants the students
returned more quickly. He and
state school Superintendent Glenn
"Max" McGee have proposed cre
ating a special panel to review the
student's conduct and grades in Jan
uary; those that are doing well
might be allowed back in the class
room then.
School officials have refused to
discuss the idea so far.
As the parade passed his home
Sunday. Todd Walsh, a trucker, sig
naled his support with two thumbs
up.
"It was just a fistfight." he said.
" They should have been punished,
but not like that."
