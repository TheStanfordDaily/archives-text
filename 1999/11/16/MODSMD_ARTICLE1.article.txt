# Union rallies in protest of worker's death
## 
### Mariam Ali Contributing writer 
Almost 200 Stanford workers
gathered yesterday to remember
Daniel Arroyo, a Housing and Din
ing Services worker who died Oct. 5,
and to protest what they said was
unfair treatment of Arroyo and
other workers by management.
The Union said Arroyo asked
Dining Services management for
sick leave and was told he would be
"terminated" if he took another day
off. Management officials have de
nied the allegation.
At the noon rally in White Plaza
yesterday, union leaders handed
out signs reading "We Demand and
We Want Respect" and "Stanford
Workers, Strong Together." Ap
proximately 60 workers and 10 stu
dents stood silently holding up the
signs.
"We are not chanting today be
cause this is a memorial service,"
Bobbie Hodges-Betts, work side or
ganizer of the United Stanford
Workers, told the assembled com
pany. "Don't worry, there will be
plenty of opportunities to raise hell
some other day."
The atmosphere was heated
nonetheless.
"1 knew Daniel personally." said
a worker who asked not to be
named due to concerns about job
security. "I am still shocked by what
happened.... We feel that they do
not really care about the health of
an employee."
"We just want them to pay more
attention to us. listen to us. take care
of us," said Fernando Cuevas, a
groundsworker. "Just treat us like
regular men and women."

The group, wearing purple rib
bons for solidarity, marched across
Mayfield Ave. and Campus Drive
to the Wilbur Modules, where ap
proximately 100 Dining Services
workers on their lunch break joined
in.
At 1:15 p.m., Arroyo's wife and
daughter arrived at the protest.
They shook hands with protesters
and thanked them for their pres
ence at the rally.
Afterward, the protesters
marched to 655 Sena St..the build
ing that houses the offices of Labor
Relations.
A pair of workers read a short

speech about Arroyo in both Eng
lish and Spanish, and then I lodges-
Betts read a list of union demands.
The demands included: "adopt a
policy which allows employees who
are ill to go home on leave without
undue harassment or threats" and
"provide monthly notice to all
workers of all sick leave hours ac
crued."
The rally concluded at 2 p.m.,
with a few words from Hodges-
Betts.
"We want to remind you that
there has been an ongoing struggle
for respect for food service workers
at Stanford." she s;iid. "You will get

it: you will. 1 his is not the end. and
that is a guarantee."
Keith Smith. Stanford's manager
of labor / employee relations, said
union leaders and Dining Services
management will meet tonight to
discuss the issues raised at the rally.
"We are optimistically confident
about [today's] meeting," said Julia
Scheulke, director of Education and
Special Districts for the union. "The
point of today was to honor the
brother who passed. Now we will
close that chapter, but continue to
support whatever will make the
workplace safer and more effec
tive."
