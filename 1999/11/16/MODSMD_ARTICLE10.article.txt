Stanford's 1998 yearbook beat
out more than 5,500 competitors to
win the title of best yearbook in
North America in a design and
printing competition last month.

earned the Printing Industries of
America's prestigious Benjamin
Franklin Award for outstanding
achievement in the Yearbook Cat
egory at the Premier Print Awards
on Oct. 18 in Chicago.
The Quad edged thousands of
other entries in the field to garner
the award. It was Stanford's first
time receiving the award in the 49-
year history of the competition.
The prize comes as a much
needed boost for I he Quad, which
recently recovered from earlier fi
nancial mismanagement and inter
nal dissention.
I he 1998 edition of The Quad
was produced by a team of eight
students spearheaded by editor in
chief Anthony Lin. Lifetouch Pub
lishing and Friesen Yearbooks
jointly handled the printing of the
yearbook.
The design for the 430-page pub
lication featured a distinctive trans
parent plexiglass inset in the cover

with "QUAD" etched on its sur
face. "It was a very unique cover,"
Lifetouch representative Geoff
Skidmore said. "I've been in the
business for five or six years and
I've never seen anything like it."
In addition to the cover. Skid
more attributes Stanford's success
to the student artwork and photos
that were featured in the year
book. as well as outstanding layout
design.
"The field of entries was very
impressive this year, PI A Presi
dent and CEO Ray Roper stated in
a press release. " I he hard work
and the determination of Friesen
Yearbooks enabled them to pro
duce an award winning piece in the
face of some very stiff competi
tion."
Entries in the Yearbook Cate
gory were judged in two equally
scaled criteria. The first was the
production value of the yearbook,
consisting of binding, cover and
print quality. The second criterion
was the layout, design and content
of the book.
The Premier Print Awards is
the world's oldest and largest glob
al graphic arts competition. The
competition recognizes excellence
in the creation and production of
print media.
