## U.S. and China reach major trade agreement 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
United Stales and China reaehed a
major trade agreement on Monday
that otters the prospect of billions of
dollars in increased overseas sales
for American manufacturers, farm
ers and high-tech industries. But
labor unions said they would light
the deal in Congress as a job-killer.
After being criticized by business
leaders for walking away from an
April trade agreement with China.
President Bill Clinton moved in
recent weeks to restart the stalled
talks through personal phone calls
to Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
who gave the go-ahead a week ago

for Clinton to send a high-level bar
gaining team to Beijing.
"This is a good agreement for
China, for America and for the
world," an elated Clinton told
reporters at a news conference in
Ankara. Turkey.
Major business groups, including
the U.S. Chamber ol Commerce
and the Business Roundtable.
joined him in praising the agree
ment and pledged to work for con
gressional approval.
But the package was denounced
by labor unions, the U.S. textile
industry and others who face
intense competition from lower

priced Chinese imports.
In exchange for Beijing's agree
ment to slash tariffs and other trade
barriers that now keep U.S. prod
ucts away from China's 1.3 billion
consumers, the United States will
support China's membership in the
World Trade Organization, the 135-
member Geneva-based organiza
tion that sets the rules for global
trade.
For the United States to receive
the market-opening benefits of the
agreement. Congress must vote to
grant China permanent normal
trading relations with the United
States, ending the annual congres

sional vote on tariff rates for Chi
nese imports.
"The fevered rush to admit
China to the WTO is a grave mis
take," AFL-CIO President John
Sweeney said in a statement. "It is
disgustingly hypocritical of the ('lin
ton administration to pledge to put
a human face on the global econo
my' while prostrating itself in pui
suit of a trade deal with a rogue
• ...
nation that decorates itself in
human rights abuses."
Teamsters union president
James P. Hoffa called the deal a
"slap in the face" to American and
Chinese workers. The American

Textile Manufacturers Institute, an
industry trade group, contended the
deal could result in the loss of
150,000 American textile and
apparel manufacturing jobs.
The American negotiating team,
led by I J.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshcfsky and by Gene
Sperling, the president's chief eco
nomic adviser, insisted they had
struck a deal that would result in
significant gains for American
exporters while retaining protec
tions for threatened U.S. industries
such as textiles.
Under the deal reached Monday.
China agreed to reduce its tariffs on

U.S. goods from an overall average
of 22.1 percent down to 17 percent
with even bigger reductions on cer
tain farm products, China agreed to
cut its barriers limiting sales of
American wheat, corn, rice and cot
ton.
The Chinese also promised to
lower barriers that now seriously
hinder the ability of U.S. companies
to do business in China in the areas
of banking, insurance, securities and
telecommunications. The American
movie industry would see an
increase in the number of films it can
export annually and U.S. firms won
the ritiht to offer auto loans in China.
