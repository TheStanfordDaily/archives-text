Freshman Council
wise to select new
design for T-shirt

The Freshman Council
made a wise decision last
Friday when it decided
during a special meeting to select
a new design for the ( lass ol 2003
T-shirt.
A class T-shirt should focus on
class spirit and incorporate a
design that appeals to every mem
ber of the class. Each student
should feel proud to wear his or
her class T-shirt. The original
design failed to meet these expec
tations, as evidenced by the
approximately 30 e-mails which
the Freshman Council received
from various members of the
Class of 2003 who had first seen
the design during house meetings
last Wednesday.
The design sought to feature a
James Bond theme and did so by
featuring the words "The name is
Ford ... Stanford" along with four
scantily-clad Bond girls and Odd
job (an Asian character from
"Goldfinger"). This particular
design offended different mem
bers of the class who perceived
racist and sexual tones in it due to
its lack of minorities and abun
dance of "Barbie-esque" women.
II the designers of the T-shirt
had wanted to properly represent
a James Bond theme, they should
have done so in a more politically
correct and inoffensive manner.

The T-shirt design could have
focused more specifically on the
character of James Bond himself,
rather than the sidekicks and ene
mies. Another solution would
have been to depict various mem
bers of the Bond Crew as repre
senting the diversity of the Class
of 2003.
The Freshman Council should
have originally considered the
points of view of each member of
the class before selecting a design.
They amended for this mistake,
however, by allowing representa
tives of the Freshman Council to
present the design to freshmen
before ordering the shirts.
There is an inherent challenge to
designing a class T-shirt. On one
hand, the designers of the shirt
would ideally want to incorporate
some kind of theme for fear that if
they didn't, freshmen would find
their shirt to be plain and boring
and hence not purchase it. At the
same time, it seems to be even
more of a challenge to find a theme
that manages not to offend anyone.
It is likely that the creator of the
Bond-themed T-shirt had no inten
tion of offending his or her fellow
classmates. To prevent a similar sit
uation from reoccurring in upcom
ing years, future classes should
develop more stringent guidelines
for what T-shirts can and cannot
depict.
And on a less serious but still rel
evant point, the Bond theme
should be reserved for the Class of
2(X)7.
