Urban space, not open space
I have always believed that if there is a
will, there must be a way. If a world-class uni
versity wills itself to grow sustainablv, then
without a doubt there is a way. And Stanford
is not alone in its quest for new facilities.
When my high school broke ground for a
new science and math building last spring, we
didn't expand onto the football field or into
the street. I tie planners simply built on an
open space within the campus, re-landscaped
the area and erected the first two-story build
ing that Los Altos I ligh School has seen. This
not only preserves open space on the campus
by building up instead of out but also allows
two-thirds of the school during any period to
sit in new energy-efficient classrooms.
Stanford University needs to be account
able for its intellectual vitality and world
renowned reputation. Stanford should not
consider building on open space an option
before all sustainable approaches are
exhausted. It needs to broaden its scope to
incorporate all possibilities. Right now the
I Jniversity is simply not doing so.
Why are we battling over open space
preservation in the foothills when we should
be looking at open spaces on the campus
itself and in the surrounding urban and sub
urban areas?
Why not build housing on empty or
unused lots in Palo Alto? Why not expand
the Marguerite shuttle further into the
matrix of streets in Palo Alto so that the grad
students who live off campus don't have to
drive to school? Why not spend valuable city
council meetings deciding which urban
spaces to develop instead of arguing over the
appropriate use of open spaces.'

Stanford has overlooked an important
option. Stanford does not have to develop
our open space to remain the prestigious uni
versity that it has come to he.

Band shouldn't suffer for Cat
students 9 behavior
Big Game Stanford wins. Cat students
storm the field and attack Stanford fans cele
brating a victory. There are numerous
injuries. The tree costume is destroyed.
Big Game '97: Stanford wins. Cal students
storm the field and tear down the Stanford
goal post when security successfully keeps
them from attacking Stanford fans (I thought
winning teams tore down the rival's goal
post!)
Big Game '98: Stanford wins. Cal students
storm the field and try to attack Stanford fans
celebrating a victory. Only two lines of police
and security prevent a repeat of'%.
Does anybody else see a pattern here?
And exactly how is it that a halftime show
that comes nearly two hours before the end
of the game is inciting this behavior?
Contain the Cal students. Problem solved.

Seek out truth behind the
Grapes debate
I read with great disappointment a letter

authored by Janelle Ishida and Laura Jean
Torgerson, who participated in a trip last
spring called Conocimiento (Spanish for
Knowledge) sponsored by Rev. Jim Burklo
of the United Campus Christian Ministry.
On May 6, 1999. Rev. Burklo wrote me a
letter expressing his thanks for our hospitali
ty and contribution to their experience. It is a
shame that after such a unique opportunity
to visit fields and speak directly with farm
workers, Ms. Ishida and Ms. Torgerson
choose to ignore the truth (an element nec
essary to receive true knowledge) and mere
ly repeat old factuallv incorrect statements
by the UFW.
The Conocimiento group met with actual
pickers and asked them whatever they want
ed to. One Stanford student commented that
she was surprised that some of the pickers
have college degrees from Mexico. Farm
workers are a lot smarter than the UFW por
tiays them in the media, and college stu
dents. especially from Stanford, should not
stereotype anybody.
It also should not have been a surprise to
them that I support both the (irape Workers
and Farmers Coalition and the Strawberry
Workers and Farmers Alliance that has been
publicly known for years. Both groups were
organized to provide factual information,
protect open markets and oppose boycotts.
The Western Growers Association does not
provide any financial assistance.
Thousands of farm workers and farmers
support both organizations because they pro
tect the jobs of farm workers and businesses
of farmers. We support full enforcement of
all laws pertaining to farm workers including
the Agricultural I abor Relations Act which
gives workers the right to organize.

We do not oppose the UFW, the United
Food & Commercial Workers, the Team
sters, Coastal Berry Farmworkers of Califor
nia Committee, Farm Labor Organizing
Committee, PCUN or any other union who
wishes to organize farm workers. Unlike Ms.
Ishida and Ms. Torgerson, we support the
workers right to choose either for or against
unionization.
What is ironic about the boycott at Stan
ford is that the IJFW is not actively pursuing
it anymore, and they have not organized
grape workers in years. With regard to straw
berries, the only farm they have attempted to
organize in recent years is Coastal Herrv
where they lost a historic election last June.
The UFW failed to show up at the campus
wide forum last week. They canceled at the
last minute. Four students (not Ms. Oshida
nor Ms. Torgerson) attended the publicized
forum which Stanford staff had professional
ly staged and even set up with lighting for
videotaping.
Four representatives of the Grape Work
ers and Farmers Coalition took time away
from their families and jobs to spend two
days and a night with me at Stanford. There
were no perks or benefits for these workers.
I encourage Stanford students to vote
against the boycott and learn the truth of
what is really happening in the fields, but do
so with an open mind. Do not just believe
what you read on a web site or what is polit
ically convenient.
In order to receive true Conocimiento,
you must be willing to have an open mind
and a desire for the truth.
