## Mike Rosenbluth Have I become a corporate whore? 
### 
I asked myself the
above question this
past week after I
attended a dinner at a very
upscale Palo Alto restau
rant on an invite by a cer
tain investment banking
firm. All my friends seem

to think I am now a corporate whore.
Though I had reservations about
attending a dinner paid for by those whom
many of us refer to as "The Enemy," I fig
ured 1 was getting the better end of the
deal. "The big joke's on them." I thought.
Little did they know my conniving little
secret: that I had no intentions of working
for them.
But after a few classy Belgian beers and
a couple of glasses of California Chardon
nay, I actually started listening to them.
And though the job sounded excruciatingly
intense and mildly unrewarding, I consid
ered applying.
I mean, the people who worked there
seemed pretty cool. And after their two
year job was over, they were all going to get
mean jobs in Silicon Valley. But were they
happy? Not really. One woman boasted of
the time she stayed up four days in a row
with 10-minute power naps as sustenance. It
was almost as if they had to top each other
about how hard their hardest work experi
ence was. "Hey. its just like my friends and
I when we talk about our major." I thought.
As I went home. I became scared that I
was actually thinking about this company as

an employment opportunity. Though it
would help me to achieve my goal of
becoming an engineering entrepreneur, 1
couldn't help thinking how much 1 would
think of myself as a sell-out. I turned hack
to my Stanford application essay (an ideo
logical antithesis of (-banking) for comfort.
I am very proud of my essay. I did the
one where we had to write about a photo
graph of significance to us and explain why
it was meaningful. In my essay, I wrote
about a pair of guys who traveled the coasts
of America setting up these incredible rock
sculptures by balancing hundreds of 50-lb.
boulders on their points to create a gravity
defying landscape on the sea. I wittily (OK.
at the time it was witty) compared the rocks,
which seemingly defied gravity, to the "rock
artists" who defied the gravity of life by sati
ating their dreams of a nomadic lifestyle
and rejecting the standard 9-to-5-job way of
life.
1 .ooking back at my essay comforted and
alarmed me at the same time. I am soon to
be graduating with a Bachelor's degree in
Mechanical Engineering from Stanford
(hopefully) and am seemingly further away
from the non-conformist ideal I set in high
school than I ever was. Hell, I am consider
ing I-Banking. And right now. even if 1
could support myself with a non-conformist
job. I am not sure I'd want to.
My driving spirit for success that got me
into Stanford wouldn't let me settle into a
stagnant job without possibility for wealth
and glory, even though idealistically that is

not what 1 have yearned for. I know that
multi-millionaires are often more unhappy
than a guy with a beach bungalow selling
bead bracelets for a living (though I do
imagine that that could get pretty dull), yet
at the same time, I would see myself as a
failure if I chose the simpler lifestyle.
I feel as though I have two goals which
are polar opposites. Feeling quite internally
conflicted. I did what any desperate college
student would do: turn to my Psychology
major friend for adviec.
Alter claiming that jny issues were either
deep-rooted in a huge irrecoverable sleep
debt or the after-effects of being locked up
as a prisoner in the Pysch department base
ment, he actually came upon something
useful. Mv issue is in my definition of suc
cess. I've got that definition all wrong. I
liked that.
Success does not only have to be in terms
of economics or rejecting the occupational
norm. These two do not have to be polar
opposites. Rather, success can exist i»"» llv
big picture as a balance between the two.
I know there is something out there that
will satisfy both my desire to do something
different and my desire to find professional
success. I just have to find what it is. Until
then, I think I'll co-term.

Mike Rosenbluth hopes to eventually invent
the follow-up to the Post-it Note and hung
out on the beach with a six pack of Corona.
