■ Saturday: Stanford wins Region N
Championships in Portland, Ore.

For the second straight meet, the
Cardinal went 1-2-3 and this time tal
lied just 29 points within a field of 28
teams. All seven Stanford runners
were in the top 22, each of them earn
ing All District honors.
Leading the race from start to fin
ish was junior Julia Stamps, fresh off
her Pac-1() collapse due to heat ex
haustion.
"Basically, coach and I went
through my race the previous week
end and we just said "here's what 1 did
wrong.' They were pretty obvious
mistakes," Stamps said.
"As far as going out too hard, I can
still take the lead, but it's just a matter
of composure. We had to work on
that and we did. I proved that's just
what it was last weekend."
While obviously glad to see Julia
running at her potential. Stanford
head coach Vin Lananna was more
happy with the end result.
"We went in with the attitude of
qualifying for the NCAA meet and
they did that pretty handily," 1 .anan
na said. "I think we ran as comfort
able as we could without coming off it
flat. Everything seems to be good and
everyone came off it well. No in
juries, so we're ready to go."
One second off Stamps time of 1 6
minutes. 50 seconds was freshman
Pac-10champion Erin Sullivan. Con
tinuing to show her lack of fear to
step up. Sullivan challenged Stamps
most of the way, going with her when
Stamps decided to separate early.

"I just wanted to keep contact
with Julia and she sort of pulled me
along and I hope I was able to push
her," Sullivan said. "We were able to
run together."
Placing third with a time of 16:59
was freshman Lauren Fleshman, also
the third place runner at Pac-lOs.
Senior Sally Glynn and sopho
more Laura Turner finished the scor
ing for the Cardinal in 10th and 13th
places respectively with times of
17:24 and 17:34. making a first to fifth
spread for Stanford of just 44 sec
onds.
"We wanted to race really strong
as a team and show our presence a lit
tle bit and what we were capable of
and keep the momentum going for
the end of the season." Fleshman
said.
"So I basically ran to whatever the
competition was and stayed back a
little with the other girls. Erin and
Julia separated from the pack, but 1
stayed with the pack with Sally.
Laura, and Katie Bri/gys. I just de
cided 1 was going to try to keep the 1 -
2-3 punch going."
After the sweep up front. Arizona
State's Kelly Mac Donald (17:04) and
Lisa Aguilera (17:15) finished fourth
and fifth, followed by UCLA's Kate
Vermeulen (17:19) and three Wash
ington runners.
Washington secured an automatic
bid to the NCAA meet by finishing
second with 63 points, bouncing back
after being edged by Arizona State at
the Pac-10 meet.
Fortunately for Arizona State, as
well as fourth place UCLA and fifth
place Oregon, the first five teams will
advance to nat ionals due to "at large"
bids.
While il may not seem possible,
the Cardinal hopes to tighten up its
performance another notch for
NCAAs.
"I think we can still continue tore
fine things and run together even
more and continue to pack up even
more." Sullivan said. "I think that the
sky is the limit for all of us. I think we
all have an awesome opportunity to
do really well at nationals, both as a
team and all as individuals."
The team heads to Bloomington
on Fridav.
