## Cardinal women claim singles, doubles crowns over weekend 
### Bill Hanson Staff writer 
Freshman Laura Granville and
sophomore Lauren Kalvaria have
nearly the same first name. They've
also been friends for several years,
competing through the national
ranks of junior tennis together. This
year, Granville joined Kalvaria as a
member of Stanford's championship
squad.
But last night, at Stanford'sTaube
Tennis Stadium, Laura and Lauren
found themselves competing for a
prestigious collegiate title, the Inter
collegiate Tennis Association Re
gional Championships.

competition at the Intercollegiate

pionships.

"We're good friends," Kalvaria
said. "We warmed up together and
talked with each other before the
match. But once you hit the court, all
that stuff moves aside and you just
don't think about it."
Both women won five matches in
reaching the final. The 128-player sin
gles draw featured players from Stan
ford, Cal Poly, Fresno State, Pacific,
California, Nevada, Oregon, Wash
ington, Washington State, Portland.
Santa Clara. Idaho and Saint Mary's.
In the semifinals, both Granville,
the tournament's third seed, and
Kalvaria, seeded fourth, played a Cal
rival.
Granville squared off against the
tournament's top seed, senior Amy
Jensen, winning a hard-hitting duel.
6-1,6-4.
"Granville's win over Jensen was a
classic," said Stanford head coach
Frank Brennan. "Granville is one of
the best returners and passers in col
legiate tennis, and Jensen is the best
serve-and-volleyer."
Kalvaria also won her match in
straight sets, upending last year's
champion, sixth seed Anita Kurimay,
6-1,6-1.
"It was one of my best matches
ever," Kalvaria said. "I concentrated
completely."
The singles final turned out to be
the tournament's most dramatic en
counter.
Granville prevailed, defeating

Kalvaria. 6-2,4-6.6-4.
In the first set, a shaky Kalvaria
was overwhelmed by Granville's flat,
aggressive baseline drives. Kalvaria
struggled with a low first service per
centage and, to make matters worse.
Granville often pounced on her sec
ond serve.
As the second set began, however,
the freshman upstart began to hit her
ground strokes with less depth and
authority, and an opportunistic
Kalvaria mounted a 4-2 lead.
Having found her rhythym and

playing with confidence, Kalvaria
produced some spectacular shots to
capture the second set, 6-4.
At the start of the third set, a frus
trated Granville was forced behind
the baseline as Kalvaria ripped fore
hand winners with her trademark
topspin. Exhausted, Granville began
to play defensively and her shots be
came erratic.
Kalvaria sprinted to a seemingly
insurmountable 4-1 third set lead.
"I had gotten tired and Lauren
had begun to take control of the

points," Granville said. "Hut I just
began concentrating and took one
game at a time."
Suddenly, errors crept into
Kalvaria's game. A gritty Granville
evened the set at 4-all after an over
aggressive Kalvaria sprayed several
shots wide.
"I had the momentum from the
second set," Kalvaria said. "But when
I was up 4-1, 1 got a little impatient
and went for something too soon. She

gained confidence and 1 was proba
bly thinking about the finish line too
much."
At 4-all. Granville put two solid
games together, capturing the title
after Kalvaria double-faulted on
match point.
While upset by the loss. Kalvaria
was very pleased with her overall
tournament performance. As a
freshman last season, the highly tout
ed recruit struggled through several
injuries and her game fell apart in the
process.
"I always knew I could play like
this," she said. "1 just had to prove it
to everyone else. For almost a full
year, 1 hadn't played well, and now I
have a lot of confidence going into
this season."
Granville, the nation's top
ranked junior in 1998. was humble
when discussing her precocious col
legiate debut.
"It feels really good," she said.
"It's actually kind of a surprise. I just
want to have a really solid first year
and keep on improving."
Brennan, of course, was thrilled.
Not only did two Stanford players
reach the tournament final, all seven
of the Cardinal's competitors made a
dent in the draw.
Stanford also swept the doubles
competition. Granville and Tokuda,
the third-seeded tandem, stopped
the top-seeded duo of Lastra and
Kalvaria, 7-5,6-1.
"Granville and Tokuda had never
played together before," Brennan
said. "But we put them together in
practice, and they turned out to be
amazing."

"I always knew I could play like
this," she said. "1 just had to prove it
to everyone else. For almost a full
year, 1 hadn't played well, and now I
have a lot of confidence going into
this season."
Granville, the nation's top
ranked junior in 1998. was humble
when discussing her precocious col
legiate debut.
"It feels really good," she said.
"It's actually kind of a surprise. I just
want to have a really solid first year
and keep on improving."
Brennan, of course, was thrilled.
Not only did two Stanford players
reach the tournament final, all seven
of the Cardinal's competitors made a
dent in the draw.
Stanford also swept the doubles
competition. Granville and Tokuda,
the third-seeded tandem, stopped
the top-seeded duo of Lastra and
Kalvaria, 7-5,6-1.
"Granville and Tokuda had never
played together before," Brennan
said. "But we put them together in
practice, and they turned out to be
amazing."
