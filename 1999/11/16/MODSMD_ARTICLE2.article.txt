# Officials fight illegal use of Stanford's name
## 
### Anitha Reddy Staff writer 
In another example of the Inter
net's relentless ability to revolution
ize everything in its path. University
officials are now fighting a difficult
battle against increasing illegal uses
of the Stanford name on the Web.
While the law still protects trade
mark ownership in cyberspace, it is
the ease of infringement on the In
ternet that forces trademark owners
to be more vigilant, University Gen
eral Counsel Michael Roster said.
"The speed with which abuses
might occur on the Internet is pretty
fast. You used to have to rent a room,
hire a sign-painter. You wouldn't be
up and running for at least 60 to l X)
days," Roster said.
Web sites using the Stanford
name illegitimately, he said, can be
built within hours.
According to Roster, it's not only
the ease and speed of infringement in
the wired world that make trade
mark owners nervous, but the global
nature of the Internet.

"In the U.S. we can sort [trade
mark infringement] out pretty quick
ly," Roster said, hut suddenly the
University is looking at a global
problem.
In a sense, the current plight of
University officials is like that of
record companies caught off guard
when Ml' 3 technology made online
piracy child's play.
And just as record companies fear
sales and profit drops caused by M P3
technology, infringements of the
Stanford trademark may also ad
versely affect I University revenues.
Director of Business Develop
ment Shelley llebert explained the
problem in a presentation of pro
posed changes to the University's
trademark policy at Thursday's Fac
ulty Senate meeting.
Any loss of the prestige and insti
tutional excellence associated with
Stanford's name might curtail the
University's leverage in licensing its
name and other trademarks.
Currently, licensing program pro

coeds are earmarked lor support of
undergraduate students and arc con
tributed to the financial aid program,
among others.
In her presentation to the Faculty
Senate. I lebert used several exam
ples culled from her experiences
combating trademark infringement.
One overhead displayed a Web
page titled "Stanford Hssays," which
provided a searchable index of pa
pers and essays. The page's banner
was a copy of the red and gold banner
on the official Stanford University
Web site.
After a call from I lebert, the site's
webmaster changed its title to "Stan's
Essays."
I lebert also showed a Web site
selling nutritional supplements and

claiming that they were developed in
Stanford laboratories.
In both cases, Robert forced the
Web page's operators to remove the
Stanford name and any graphic simi
larities to Stanford University's Web
site.
The nature of the infringement
determines the nature of the re
sponse, said I lebert, who works in
conjunction with the Office of the
General Counsel to protect Stan
ford's trademarks.
" The closer [the infringement) is
to the core activities of the I Jniversi
tv. the closer it gets to teaching and
research and specific areas such as
health care, publishing, fine arts,
alumni relations and technology, the
more seriously we regard it," she said.
" The issue is potential confusion of
the public."
Another concern for University
officials are Internet domain registra

lions, or addresses. While the Board
of Trustees owns "high-level do
mains like Stanford.edu and Stan
ford.org," Hebert recommends the
Board own all registrations that in
clude the name Stanford.
"Cybersquatters are taking out In
ternet domain name registrations
that include our name in the hopes of
selling it. Clearly, they may think that
the University may buy it from them
or they may hope to sell it to someone
else who hopes to use it for commer
cial purposes," I iebert said.
In an effort to prevent such "cy
bersquatting." the Graduate School
of Business recently registered at
least 15 internet addresses that could
be associated with the sch(X)l. includ
ing Stanford-GSB.org and Stanford
bizschool.net. Waiting to pursue such
names after they have already been
registered by a third party is a much
more costly alternative, Hebert said.

One specific illegal use of the
Stanford name has skyrocketed in
the past two years without the help of
the Internet: the attachment of Stan
ford's name to SAT preparation cen
ters.
"We have seen companies at
tempting to use the name Stanford,
and that's a real concern," Hebert
said. "You certainly wouldn't want
high school students or their parents
thinking that Stanford University is
offering these services or even worse,
that they have an improved chance of
admission to competitive schools."
At any given time, the University
is investigating 20 to 30 infringement
cases, many of which have been
brought to the attention of I lebert or
the General Counsel's office by stu
dents, faculty, staff or alumni who
suspect an illegitimate use of the
Stanford name.
