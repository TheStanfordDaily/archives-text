MEW'S CROSS COUNTRY
â–  Saturday: Stanford wins Region N
Championships in Portland. ()re.

But Stanford used Saturday's
meet as much more than a qualifier.
The Cardinal's convincing first
place performance sent the re
sounding message not to count Stan
ford out of the national champi
onship picture quite yet.
In unseasonable sunny and 70 de
gree weather, sophomore Gabc
Jennings's fourth-place effort, his
best of the year, led No. 5 Stanford
to tally a mere 40 points and turn the
tables on fourth-ranked Arizona,
the Pacific 10 champions, who
scored 74 points.
Arizona State (92 points), Ore
gon (%), Cal-Poly San L.uis Obispo
(139) and Portland (161) all ad

vanced to the NCAA meet as well.
Stanford looked strong from the
gun. as all seven Cardinal runners
comprised the lead group early in
the 10-kilometer race. Passing the
mile in 4 minutes. 55 seconds, the
Stanford-dominated lead pack was
controlling the tempo.
As the race wore on. the lead
pack thinned while members of the
Stanford contingent seemed to draw
energy from each other as it in ;i
workout. Jennings was joined by se
nior Jake Maas and juniors Thomas
Murley and Jonathon Riley, while
freshman Jesse Thomas was just be
hind.
On the course where he captured
the United States Junior National
Championship in IW7, Jennings
looked comfortable, yet anxious to
quicken the pace
"When I looked across and saw
four cardinal jerseys leading the
pack, it gave me shivers,*" Jennings
said. "1 felt so much energy."
With less than two miles remain
ing. Oregon's Steve Eein bolted for
the lead, as predicted. Jennings
wanted to answer his challenge, but
team captain Maas reigned him in
for the final stretch.
"I was definitely focusing on
keeping our pack together," Maas
said. "Sticking together was impor
tant for us."
Though Fein pulled away and
took two others with him. Stanford's
pack trailed closely, and only broke
for the finish line with N(H) meters to
go. when victory was all but secure.
Jennings finished in 30 minutes
and 44 seconds, behind Fein (30:30),
Isaiah Festa of Arizona State (30:36)
and Arizona's Micheil Jones
(30:39).
Riley (30:45), Murley (30:44) and
Maas (30:50) swept the sixth
through eight places. Sophomore
Jamcy Clifford closed well to take
15th (31:04) and cap off Stanford's

scoring.
"1 think what we saw today was
what we've been capable of dc>ing all
season," said Stanford head coach
Vin Lananna.
"Our goal was to get our gap be
tween our l irst and fifth scorers to 45
seconds, and we actually cut it down
to 20 seconds."
Thomas came in l<Sth in 31:06.
and freshman Joe Urabanski fin
ished 2<Sth for the Cardinal (31:44).
Maas attributed the turn-around
from Pac-lOs. where Stanford came
in second, to the team mentality.
"The key for us was that we finally
ran as a team, not just seven individ
uals," he said.
Stanford joins 17 other automat
ic qualifiers from eight other regions
and 13 at-large qualifiers to com
prise the NCAA field of 31 teams.
