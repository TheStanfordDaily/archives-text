# Latvian ambassador speaks at CREES
## 
### Greg Page Contributing writer 
Ojars Kalnins, Latvian ambas
sador to the United States, spoke at
the Center for Russian and East
European Studies yesterday at
noon.
Kalnins' main topic of discussion
was the current state of Latvian af
fairs, as well as the icy relationship

between Latvia and Russia, stem
ming from a history of Russian oc
cupation in the region.
During the post-World War II
Soviet occupation, Soviet leaders
relocated approximately 300,000
Russian citizens into Latvia. Today,
Latvia's population of 2.5 million in
cludes more than 1 million Russians,
Kalnins said.
Latvia, which established indc

pendence from Russia in 1991,
grants former Soviets full legal
rights, but does require all citizens to
pass "a nominal language test" in an
effort to preserve Latvian culture.
In addition, according to Kalnins,
Latvia has "the most liberal proper
ty restitution laws in Europe" for
citizens whose property was seized
during the Soviet, post-World War
II occupation.

Last year, Kalnins said, Russia's
parliament placed economic sanc
tions on Latvia, restricting the flow
of goods into Russia via Latvian
ports. Kalnins described this as "a
political policy that goes against
good judgment."
Regarding the attitudes of the
citizens themselves, Kalnins said,
"There is no ethnic tension in
Latvia, hut there is some resent
ment. ... The older Latvians see the
Russians as symbols of occupation."
Kalnins discussed the current sit
uation in Latvia as well.
"On the whole, the economy is
doing well, and the currency is sta
ble," he said. "The ports are a great
natural resource and source of busi
ness."
Kalnins also spoke of problems
that Latvia faces today. He men
tioned the challenge of building a
middle class, explaining the discrep
ancy between the wealth of the na
tion's capital, Riga, and the poorer,
rural communities. Kalnins listed al
coholism and "one of the highest
suicide rates in Europe" as major
Latvian social issues.
Kalnins stressed NA TO and Eu
ropean Union membership as short
term Latvian goals. He listed those
aims as parts of a process to "revive
our regional identity [as members]
of the Baltic Sea Community."
Kalnins said the Baltic states, in
general, "support United States in
volvement in the region." He re
ferred to a U.S. State Department
plan called the Northern Europe
Initiative, which calls for U.S. in
volvement in the Nordic and Baltic
states, as well as parts of Northern
Russia.
Students who attended the
speech enjoyed Kalnins' presenta
tion. "I think that we're very fortu
nate to have Ambassador Kalnins
visit Stanford to pay farewell as he is
leaving his post this December to
work in Latvia," said senior Martin
Zemitis.
