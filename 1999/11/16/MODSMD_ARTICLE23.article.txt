This year. Volunteers in Asia
has a number of goals its staff mem
bers and student participants hope
to fulfill, including an increase in
the number of positions helping
non-profit organizations and send
ing students to Indonesia next sum
mer.
The program, started in 1%3,
sends Stanford students to China,
Vietnam, Laos and now Indonesia.
Students work on humanitarian ef
forts and help individuals in the
countries.
"The goal is to give students a
chance to do something meaningful
that will impact their lives," said
Cliff Chan, a staff member of the
program.
The students may volunteer in
Asia either for one or two years, or
just for the summer. While there,
students either teach English at uni

versitics or special schools, or work
with various non-profit organiza
tions.
Most participating students have
taught English, which they said is es
pecially important since it has he
come the diplomatic language
among Asian nations.
If the student chooses to help a
non-profit organization instead, he
will work to give voice to the needs
of the people, operating with groups
that focus on women's issues or with
environmental problems, which in
clude providing clean water and
much-needed technology in the
area.
"Participating gives the students
a chance to take a risk, to go to a
country which has different per
spectives and values," Chan said.
" The program provides students
with cross-cultural communication
skills and helps them grow as peo
ple."

A total of around 50 people par
ticipate in the program each year,
including seniors Michael Page and
Jessica Amey.
Last summer, Page taught Eng
lish at a middle school in Southeast
China for six weeks. Then, he trav
eled throughout China for a month.
According to Page, it was "really
amazing to go there and just to be a
part of the community."
"I worked and lived in the com
munity, and 1 felt accepted by the
people there," he added. "It was
very special."
Amey taught a class of 25 stu
dents at a university in the Viet
namese town of Hue. She said her
experience was "amazing" and says
that the stay let her immerse herself
in the Vietnamese culture. In addi
tion to Vietnam, Amey also visited
Cambodia and Japan.
