WOMEN'S WATER POLO
â–  Friday-Sunday: Stanford defeats
USC, UCLA, and UC-Santa Bar
bara. tails to US National Team in
preseason scrimmages in southern
California.

While an official score was not
kept in any of the games, the Car
dinal went 3-1, falling only to the
National Team.
The tournament served to give
the teams a chance to be in realistic
game situations allowing them to
gauge where they were in their
training.
Susan Ortwein, the Assistant
Coach for the Cardinal, said that it
was also a chance for Stanford to
give its freshmen. Amy Lightner,
Julie Gardner and Nicole Huszcz,

a chance to play at the collegiate
level for the first time.
"1 was a little nervous at first."
said Gardner. "At the same time it
was really exciting. Just being a
part of this team is an amazing ex
perience in itself."
The scrimmage also gave Stan
ford a chance to work on basic
playing skills. Against the other
collegiate teams the Card stuck to
a basic defensive and offensive
plan, winning its games primarily
with fundamental skills.
Against the National Team,
Stanford alternated between sev
eral defenses allowing it to fine
tune its transitional skills and
adaptability to new situations.
Ortwein was pleased about
Stanford's performance and noted
that they "accomplished every
thing they planned for the week
end."
"Although we have a lot of fine
tuning to do. I think our success
this weekend shows that we are at
a very good point in our training,"
said Alison "Newport" Riddell.
In addition. Riddell also added
that the weekend helped to get the
team excited about its upcoming

season, which begins in February.
There are high expectations for
the Stanford squad this year. The
team finished second to USC at
last year's Nationals, losing to the
Trojans in overtime.
After beating both USC and
UCLA this weekend, two of na
tion's top teams, there is no doubt
that the Cardinal has every chance
to bring home a national champi
onship this spring.
"It felt good to beat USC this
weekend, especially after losing to
them last year in the finals." said
I lilary Galloglv. who serves as the
team's co-captain along with
Anne-Marie Kecnan.
"I was surprised how well we
played together as a whole. We al
ready have a cohesiveness and
flow that normally takes a lull year
of playing together to develop."
The current plan for the Cardi
nal is to continue with its vigorous
training schedule of conditioning
and fundamental work through
Christmas. Then, come January,
the squad will be begin to focus
specifically on its upcoming games
at the San Diego Tournament.
February 11th-13th.
