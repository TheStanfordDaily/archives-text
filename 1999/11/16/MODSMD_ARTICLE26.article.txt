■ Saturday: No. 2 Stanford (17-3,7-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
10. No. 7 Pacific (13-9,3-5) 6.
■ Sunday: Stanford 5, No. S UC-
Santa Barbara (9-11.2-6) 4.

This weekend, Stanford relied
on one great quarter and a miracle
finish to eke out wins against No. 7
I University of Pacific and No. 8 UC-
Santa Barbara. The victories
earned the Cardinal a No. 2 seed at
the upcoming Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Tournament and
kept the squad in the thick of the na
tional title hunt.
On Saturday, Stanford (17-3,7-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) met UOP (13-9, 3-5) in the

final league game for both squads.
With its seed at the MPSF Tourna
ment on the line. Saturday's game
would prove much tougher for the
Cardinal than its previous 9-1 win
over the Tigers in September. This
time UOP hung close until the
fourth quarter when Stanford was
finally able to pull away for a 10-6
win.
Stanford took an early 3-1 lead
in the first quarter off goals by se
niors Sean Joy and Brian I leifferon.
But after a scoreless second period,
the Tigers closed the gap to 4-3 in
the third quarter. Also in the third
period, team captain Heiffcron was
ejected from the game for kicking a
UOP player.
Instead of letting the loss of their
captain get them down, the Cardi
nal players responded with what
Stanford head coach Dante Detta
manti called "the best quarter of all
eight this weekend."
The Cardinal exploded for six
points in the fourth period, off goals
by Joy. senior Jon Skaalen. sopho
mores Pasi Dutton and Onno Koel
man and redshirt freshman Brian
Darrow. The scoring deluge gave
the Cardinal a 10-6 win and another

league victory.
Afterwards the Cardinal learned
that in another league game No. 1
UCLA had beaten No. 3 USC, giv
ing the Bruins the top seed at the
MPS! Tournament and handing
the Cardinal the No. 2 seed. Know
ing that it had already secured its
seed, the Cardinal squad may have
had trouble focusing on Sunday's
match-up with Santa Barbara.
In any event. Stanford found it
self in a much closer game with
Santa Barbara (9-11. 2-6) than it
had expected. Stanford had beaten
the Gauchos fairly easily just the
weekend before. But on Sunday,
the Cardinal, without the services of
leading scorer Heifferon (due to
Saturday's ejection), "took a ton of
shots but just couldn't buy a goal,"
Dcttamanti said.
At least the team couldn't buy a
goal until the fourth quarter when
two scores in the final minute of
play lifted Stanford to a 5-4 victory.
Back and forth scoring knotted
the game at three going into the
final period. With three minutes to
eo. the Gauchos scored on a man
up opportunity to take the lead.
Stanford responded with a press
and steal defense which would
prove the key to the Cardinal victo
ry-
Darrow, inserted into the game
for his defensive ability, was able to
take the ball away from a Gaucho
player. As he sprinted down the
pool on the counterattack. Darrow
found an open Koelman who fired
into the net, tying the game at four
with a little over a minute to play.
With five seconds left, a Gaucho
was ejected, giving the Cardinal a
inan-up chance to break the tie.
Dutton took a shot which was

tipped, giving Stanford just three
seconds to attempt another shot.
Freshman Jeff Nesmith passed the
ball to Dutton once again, and this
time he was able to score, complet
ing the miracle finish for the Cardi
nal.
While happy to survive the week
end and come away with two wins.
Dettamanti pointed out that the
squad is "having problems putting
the ball in the goal right now."
As the Cardinal enters into the
last week of regular season play and
then begins the MPSF Tournament,
the scoring will have to improve.
The good news is that "the de
fense is playing great. Other than
the scoring slump, I have no other
complaints about how we're playing
right now," Dettamanti said.
