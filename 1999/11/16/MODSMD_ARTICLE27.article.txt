## 
### Eileen Chao Contributing writer 
With $115,000 currently in its
portfolio. the Blyth I unci stands to
lie Stanford's only investment club,
m which students are able to freely
invest and experiment with the stock
inai ket.
In I l )7N Charles Blyth donated
$75.1 MX) to a group of students in
order for them to try their hand in
the stock market. Since then, the
Blyth I und has "purposely been de
signed to give the students a great
deal of autonomy in operating and
managing the fund." according to
the club's statement ol purpose.
"Our goal is not so much to in
crease the value of the | Blyth 11 und.
Inn essentially to use the invest
ments that we purchase to educate
membcison what we look for before
we make an investment decision."
said club president Aaron I ing, a se
nior.
I lie Blyth I und is open to all stu
dents and requires no fee to join. Its

structure consists of four levels: visi
tors. associates, directors and co
presidents. More frequent visitors
can apply to become associates, who
can then apply to become directors.
Anyone can bring in a proposal and
after discussion and analysis, direc
tors vote on which stocks to buy.
"We try to get discussion going at
every meeting," said sophomore
I lita ( heung. a director. "It's good
lo bounce ideas back and forth be
cause everyone brings in a different
view."
"There need to be as many peo
ple as possible to share their opin
ions in order for us to choose the best
stock to buy." s;iid senior Charles
Hudson, last year's president.
"Sometimes we get someone who
Ikis it lot ol insight in |a specific field]
that we wouldn't have had other
wise."
Stocks can also be added to the
"watch list." where they w ill be mon
itored continuously until someone
feels it's a good time to purchase one
oil hem.

Based on the club's monetary
success in the few past years, it seems
that students have been finding that
good time to purchase.
"We were up over 40 percent last
year and this year we are up about 22
percent as of April, when our term
started." Ling said.
Not only has the 112 und's money
supply grown, but its membership
has as well. Hudson stressed that
anyone can join.
"You don't have to be a genius on
the stock market to participate in the
club," I ludson said. "Many directors
didn't even know what a stock was
when they first joined. Now they are
well-informed.'"
For all the profits that the Blyth
Fund makes, 25 percent goes to the
general scholarship fund of Stan
lord. 25 percent can go to expenses
of the Blvth Fund, but everything
else goes back into the Blyth Fund as
an investment pool.
One of the greatest benefits to
the Blyth Fund is that it gives stu
dents the rare chance of experienc

ing the stock market first-hand with
out the fear of personal loss.
"It teaches you a lot of things that
can't be learned in class. Only when
you really get hands-on experience
and buy stocks will you understand
how the stock market works." I lud
son said. "It has been one of my best
experiences here at Stanford."
Freshman Emily Guest also felt
that the Fund would be a great way
to learn.
"Asa person taking economics, I
think there are certain principles
that are more difficult to grasp." she
said. "This club seems like a good
way to reinforce those principles be
cause it gives you practical experi
ence with the stock market."
I his kind of education is what the
Blyth Fund intends to offer. "A high
degree of freedom implies a high de
gree of responsibility," the Fund's
statement of purpose reads. "It is
hoped to result in a lasting satisfac
tion to each student to know that he
or she contributed to a successful op
eration in a difficult field."
