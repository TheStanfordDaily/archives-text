Flic Jewish Students Associa
tion is stepping up programming
alter a lew difficult years.
"Our goal is to rebuild the Jew
ish community from the ground
up." said senior Cody Harris, the
association president.
For more than 20 years, the en
tirely student-run association has
coordinated and planned social
events for Jewish undergradu
ates. I he group wants to create a
community where students can
meet and get to know each other.
In the past few years. I lillel
the association's primary means
of support â€” has left the group
rather alone. I larris said, hut that
is beginning to change.
"Without much support from
the I lillel there wasn't much of an
anchor for us. We felt like we
were just floating out there, but
we accepted that we were on our
own and decided to take action
ourselves." I larris said.
This year, however. I larris said
the newest executive director of
I lillel. Debra Feldman, has been
extremely supportive of the asso
ciation.
The association's eight student
board members meet weekly to
plan activities and materialize
goals. Probably the most success
ful event so far was the "23rd An
nual Champagne and Chocolate
Tasting" that took place earlier
this quarter. About 350 students
from the Jewish community and
beyond came together in semi
formal attire to sip champagne
and taste a variety of chocolates

while listening to a jazz band.
"We were only expecting
about 150 students." Harris said
with a laugh. "Needless to say. we
were very pleased with the
turnout and we're hoping to build
on that momentum."
Sophomore Erica Aronson.
the group's co-director of com
munication and publicity along
with sophomore Adam Abeles,
remarked. "I'm overwhelmed by
the response of the Jewish com
munity this year that has been
lacking in the past."
The association has targeted
freshmen, hoping to build a
strong foundation for enthusiastic
leaders in the coming years.
Board members hand-delivered
"Welcome Bags" with various in
formation and treats to all known
Jewish freshmen during Orienta
tion.
"It's easiest to contact the
freshmen." Aronson said, "but
we really want everyone to be in
volved. I think that the excite
ment of the freshmen this year has
really caught on to the rest of the
community.
"We are working hard to let
everyone know that we are here
to have fun."
On Dec. 4. the association will
co-sponsor a Hannukah party
called "Exotica Hannukah."
Members would like to encour
age all students to attend, particu
larly upperclassmen who have not
been very involved.
For more information about
upcoming events, students can
join the e-mail list "jsa-
or contact any of the
board members.
