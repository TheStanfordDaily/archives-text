MEN'S CREW
■ Sunday: Stanford finishes fifth in
the Men's Open Eight race at the
I lead of the Lake Regatta.

Things only improved slightly
after that as the varsity crew team
struggled on sharp turns while fight
ing to maintain their position.
In the Men's Open "Eight race,
Stanford finished fifth with a final
time of 16 minutes 1K.32 seconds.
The Cardinal team crossed the finish
line behind first-place Washington.
University of Victoria, Oregon State
and the VT Rowing Club, coming in
ahead of Gonzaga, UC-Davis, ÜBC

and Western Washington.
"We had mixed feelings about
the race," said senior Will Smith.
"We felt that we rowed really well,
hut at the same time we weren't
pleased with how we finished. I think
we would've been happy with sec
ond or third place."
Although the team started off
strong, the Cardinal immediately
ran into technical difficulties.
"The main feeling is that it all
came down to basic execution,"
Smith said. "We had steering prob
lems. We didn't have the right rud
der on our boat. There was a 180 de
gree turn and we ended up losing 15
to 20 seconds on that turn. We had a
boat that couldn't turn as quickly as
our competitors' boats. We've just
got to do better next time."
"The guys rowed really well,"
said men's crew coach Wieslaw
Kujda. "I felt really good about the
way they performed. We had techni
cal problems. It's just that we had a
couple of errors in our turns. We

took a really wide turn and lost a lot
of seconds."
Stanford's men's second varsity
boat, consisting mostly of under
classmen. finished sixth with a re
spectable time of 17:26, coming in
ahead of Washington State, Gonza
ga and British Columbia.
"We've got the new guys filling
out the second varsity boat." Smith
said. "They're doing a really great
job. They're inexperienced, but
they're learning really quickly and
stepping things up. They show a lot
of potential. These boats are not set.
People are definitely moving in and
out of their spots and we expect [the
underclassmen] to step up and fill
those spots."
Being near the close of the fall
season, the Head of the Lake regat
ta gave the Cardinals an opportunity
to test their skills against rival Pacif
ic 10 Conference teams such as
Washington and Oregon State.
"In terms of skill, we're doing re
ally well and are where we're sup

posed to be," Kujda said. "We have
pretty good technique, strength, and
experience in competitive situa
tions, but we still lack 1(K) percent
preparation. The team has had great
improvement during practice, but
they still have a lot of things to over
come and still have a ways to go be
fore the spring racing season."
The team will have another week
to sharpen its skills before the last
race of the season.
"The guys know what kind of
mistakes they made," Kujda said.
"They're angry that they made men
tal errors, but they can correct them.
It would be different if they didn't
finish strong or something like that.
They were aware of what happened.
They're capable of correcting their
mistakes, that's why they're disap
pointed."
Stanford will conclude its fall rac
ing schedule next weekend when it
competes at the Bair Island Regatta
hosted by the Stanford Rowing Club
in Foster City.
