# Students sit in at AEL in protest
## 
### 
Editor's note: This story origi
nally ran on April 10, 1V69. The sit
in of several hundred students at the
Applied Electronics lasted nine
days and was one of the clearest ex
amples of Stanford students' anti
war sentiments.
Secret research at the AEL was
funded by the Defense Department,
which students strongly objected.
Protestors and the Academic Senate
demanded the University place a
ban on secret research. War-related
classified research was left un
touched by the students, though the
University felt the students' pres
ence jeopardized the material.
The A EL takeover stands in his
tory of one of the chief events of the

radical movement at Stanford dur
ing the Vietnam War.
Daily staff report
More than 4(H) people entered
the Applied Electronics Laborato
ry (AEL) last night to demonstrate
against the continuation of $2 mil
lion in classified research work
there.
The take-overcame after a com
munity meeting in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium in which an overflowing
crowd of 9(H) students voted by a
two-to-one margin to "occupy the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
such that the research cannot go
on."

Students moved from Dinkel
spiel immediately following the
meeting and began the sit-in.
There will be a noon rally today
in White Plaza to explain the issues

that led to the sit-in. Following the
rally, there will he a I p.m. commu
nity meeting in the courtyard out

side AEL. The Concerned Faculty
committee will meet tonight at 8
p.m. in Tresidder 270. The Acade
mic Senate will meet in the Gradu
ate School of Business at 3:15.
Reject Board Response
The students voted overwhelm
ingly to reject the response of the
Stanford Board of Trustees at their
Tuesday meeting. The demands in
cluded closer supervision of the
Stanford Research Institute and an
end to classified research, and
stopping all chemical and biologi
cal warfare and counter■insurgency
studies, mainly at SRI.
Tuesday the Trustees asked the
Board of Directors of SRI not to
make any new conti t< ts for re
search in Chemical and Biological
Warfare pending completion of
study of the relationship between
the two institutions.
The Trustees also voted to have
selected students representing di
vergent opinions present their
views to a committee.
Doors to the laboratory origi
nally were locked. At about 10:45,
a group of 20 students arrived, one
student jimmied open the door.
Minutes later hundreds of students
streamed inside.
Inside, most doors were locked
and people swarmed over the
three-story building, entering
every open room. No damage or
attempt to break into locked
rooms was apparent.
When the students arrived one
Stanford police car was there but it
left moments later, l ater, two
Stanford policemen entered the
building and checked the doors
that were locked, but left soon
after.
Later in the evening Stanford
Police Chief Thomas Bell sta
tioned five uniformed officers in
side the building to "maintain
order." They were to remain there
throughout the night.
After the occupiers milled in the
building for a short time, a meeting
began in the AFX courtyard. After
organizing a series of committees,
they broke into several small group
discussions with faculty members.
Among the committees orga
nized were a coordinating commit
tee. along with rally, leaflet, cam
pus coordinating, community edu
cation. press, food, legal aid. and
medical aid committees.
Acadcinic Senate
Those at the meeting decided
that the Academic Senate would
be asked at its meeting today to set
aside class time for the next few

days for the discussion of the SRI
issues.
Also, it was announced that
2.000 extra copies of The Daily
were to he printed this morning at
the Daily's expense for distribu
tion off campus.
Mimeographed statements on
what to do in case of arrest were
distributed. Law student Doron
Weinburg advised people entering
the building that they were subject
to arrest under federal statutes, but
could most likely not be convicted
under those statutes.
When The Daily went to press
at 3 a.m., over 200 students re
mained. The corridors were filled
with students in sleeping bags, with
knots of students talking and
singing in the stairwells. In the
basement, a group of students were
busy publishing a makeshift news
paper. with a press office located
on the second floor.
AFT Meeting
The American Federation of
Teachers Local IXI6 announced
that it would meet today at noon in
the courtyard of ALL to consider
possible strike plans.
Earlier in the evening an over
flow crowd jammed Dinkelspiel
for nearly three-and-a-half hours
of discussion. Students vigorously
moved through a prepared agenda
covering reactions to the Hoard of
Trustees meeting Tuesday, and
open discussion of strategy and its
implementation.
Student Body President Denis
Naves and several faculty leaders
questioned the effectiveness of the
sit-in tactic.
The students voted to set up a
committee to survey other build
ings they might occupy and said
they would set up picket lines at
SRI. Stanford Industrial Park coin
panics. and other war-related re
search sites.
They said they would not tam
per with any classified files at the
laboratory, which is engaged in
electronics research funded by the
Defense Department.
Pit/er Speech
President Kenneth S. Pit/er ad
dressed the meeting at the outset
saying in part "having spoken
rather bluntly with the board about
the crisis of confidence among
many students in the governance
of all our social institutions, I
would now urge you to consider
the most constructive means of
achieving the changes you seek."
"Much of the influence of your
last meeting here stemmed from
the methods you employed. I hope
your commitment to peace extends
t<> thisciimpus."
larly in the meeting Pat Shea,
who was present at the Trustee's
meeting, told of the presentation
students made to the I rustees at
the I uesday meeting.
"We presented live things." said
Shea. "We asked lor a specific deci
sion on SRI. we asked lor the mora
torium. restructuring ol the hoard,
i ilate for the April hearing and a
committee ol whole to come on the
week ol April 21."
Rupert Interpretation
Paul Rupert spoke, saying he
had <.|iule anothci interpretation ol
the I rustee meeting from what
I resident Pit/er described.
I was very pleased to read his
statement to the Hoard ol I rustees.
Hut I don't think we are talking
about the same world.
"What this meeting is talking
about is that this research is going
"ii everyday in SRI ;md in the Stan
ford Industrial Park.
" I he end result ol this is that
bombs are coming down on the
heads, backs and bowels of Viet
namese every day.
I Ins does not stop on the delib
eration ol I rustees. I his w ill not
stop while we wait for the next
Ihree. four, five or six months while
we wait for rational eonsidcra
Shut ! )owii I Jni\ersil\
"It seems to me this universitv
coilkl be shut down lot a few davs
while we have the rational evalua
tion going on - 1 1 hours a da\. Ru
pel I said
SI )S nicmbei David Hugh said
that "the Trustees did not act on
an\ ol the demands. I"he Trustees
tion'l need the SRI report to come

out and do anything, fhis is not a
technical issue: it's a moral issue.
"I don't think that the I rustees
are ever going to come out and op
pose countcrinsurgency. I think
that if we act now. we can educate.
Spring term is short. I don't think
we can wait until May 13."
Student Hoilv President Denis
Hayes said that he felt that at the
Tuesday meeting "the Hoard of
I rustees acted under their legal au
thority. Hut as the meeting went on
I arrived at the decision that they
didn't have a shred of moral legiti
macy."
(•reeled with Applause
Naves' pronouncement was
greeted with much applause.
lea nne Tried man. an SDS mem
ber. then stood and proposed a sit
in at the Applied lElectronics I .abo
ratory.
Leonard Siegel followed, de
claring that tonight is a "night not
to talk but to act."
Sociology Prof. Sanford Dorn
buseli was vehement in urging stu
dents to express their feelings
through a student referendum
drafted by the President's Adviso
ry committee.
I le added, "think if you want to
win the coming referendum or
whether you are going to make
yourscll feel happy to taking some
irrational action tonight."
Limited Sit-In
Tonner Daily editor Michael
Sweeney suggested that if a sit in
was to take place, that a time limit
be placed on it. Sweeney said in
part that "it would be stupid to do
something that would hurt the
chances ol bringing SRI closer to
the I Diversity.
"1 suggest that a sit in begin
tonight but that it be stopped at a
listed time with resumption to be
used as an alternative."

SDS member I red Cohen then
spoke. "I think it's very unfortu
nate that people have to make use
of'confrontation and not wait for
some bastard who made nerve gas
six months ago to make a decision.
It might be possible that another
building could be taken. You can't
decide the most effective way of
using the building before you take
it."
Sweeney's proposal was sum
marily rejected and soon thereafter
students voted to stage the sit-in by
a majority of about 2-!.
Hayes 'Fearful'
I layes said he felt "fearful about
this body. I don't think we ought to
go into AHL, but if you want to, I
will go."
He later introduced a three
pronged proposal saying that "no
harm should be imposed to the
body of any person, that there be
no destruction of property, and
that the doors be open to anyone
who wishes to join us." The propos
al was quickly adopted.
Religion Prof. Robert McAfee
Brown delivered a dissenting
voice, saying that "I feel very much
that a sit in at this time is likely to
be a bad tactic. I'm afraid it will
turn off a large amount of commu
nication that would otherwise be
open. I feel it would deflect from
the main issues. I am afraid that we
would be talking about the legiti
macy of a sit-in rather than about
ilk- Vietnamese people. I would
simply have to say that this action
would not be helpful and I don't
think I will be able to support it."
Brown's remarks were greeted
with strong applause.
(Generally Orderly
I Ik- meeting was generally or
derly throughout, though students
often expressed a desire to cut-off a
discussion.

Reaction from the administra
tion was predictably guarded.
Provost Richard W. Lyman said
that he felt the "trustees under
stood that there were deep emo
tions on the campus." But he said
that what might happen now was
all speculative and declined to
comment further. But, he added
"why didn't they wait for the report
before they finally acted?"
W. Parmer Fuller, Chairman of
the Board of Trustees, said he
thought "it was a mistake to occupy
the building." lie said the trustees
acted 011 good faith, and he de
plored the actions of the students
involved in the sit-in.
President Pitzer had no com
ment.
Associate Dean of Students
Willard Wyman. who relocated his
office for the evening, responded
that "we're used to the fact that
there may be a sit-in and we have
sort of a general preparation, which
is to stay cool."
lull tor's note: On April 25, 1969,
the Academic Senate voted to ban
secret research at Stan ford. This af
fected all 12 of the University's clas
sified research programs. A El. di
rector William Rambo announced
his dissapointment in this decision.
At I a.m. on May I, 1969, the
"April3rd Movement"seized Enci
na llall and began a second sit-in.
This was generally in support of the
Movement's demands that Stanford
Reserach Institute be brought antler
closer control by the University.
The sit-in ended when more than
a hundred police were summoned.
Stanford issued a temporary re
straining order against the protest
ers.
A3M launched a boycott of
classes on May 12, 1969, in order to
press the SRI demands. Two days
later the Hoard of Trustees voted to
terminate the University's ties to
SRI.
