# Students sit in at AEL in protest
## 
### 
Editor's note: This story origi
nally ran on April 10, 1V69. The sit
in of several hundred students at the
Applied Electronics lasted nine
days and was one of the clearest ex
amples of Stanford students' anti
war sentiments.
Secret research at the AEL was
funded by the Defense Department,
which students strongly objected.
Protestors and the Academic Senate
demanded the University place a
ban on secret research. War-related
classified research was left un
touched by the students, though the
University felt the students' pres
ence jeopardized the material.
The A EL takeover stands in his
tory of one of the chief events of the

radical movement at Stanford dur
ing the Vietnam War.
Daily staff report
More than 4(H) people entered
the Applied Electronics Laborato
ry (AEL) last night to demonstrate
against the continuation of $2 mil
lion in classified research work
there.
The take-overcame after a com
munity meeting in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium in which an overflowing
crowd of 9(H) students voted by a
two-to-one margin to "occupy the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
such that the research cannot go
on."

Students moved from Dinkel
spiel immediately following the
meeting and began the sit-in.
There will be a noon rally today
in White Plaza to explain the issues

that led to the sit-in. Following the
rally, there will he a I p.m. commu
nity meeting in the courtyard out
