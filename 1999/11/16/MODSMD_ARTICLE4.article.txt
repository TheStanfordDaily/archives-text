# Stanford submits development plan
## 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
The second draft of Stanford's
Land Use Plan affirms the Universi
ty's commitment to new housing
and academic facilities while offer
ing land for a public school and
agreeing to county review of future
development.
Hie revised development plan,
which Stanford's Office of Govern
ment and Community Relations
submitted to Santa Clara County
yesterday following weeks of public
comment, still only extends for 10
years.
That cap is likely to irk Palo Alto
and Menlo Park residents, who crit
icized the first draft for vagueness
and pushed for preserving open
space for at least 25 years.
But because the plan incorpo
rates many of the suggestions of the
County Planning Office, those resi
dents are likely to view it more fa
vorably than its predecessor, partic
ularly its creation of new land-use
designations.
The plan resembles the Sept. 20
first draft in its provisions for creat
ing new campus housing for faculty,
staff and students and developing
new acadcmic facilities.
Larry Horton, Stanford's direc
tor of government and community
relations, called the proposal a good
compromise. "The revised plan re
tains the positive features of the first
draft," he said in a press release,
"and it adds major new provisions in
response to public comment."

Sarah Jones, a Santa Clara Coun
ty planner, called the plan "a much
more complete and comprehensive
piece of work ... we can really eval
uate it now."
The new plan's key provisions
fall into the following categories:
housing, land-use designations,
open space, academic facilities, pub
lic schools and transportation.
Housing
While the new plan's provisions
for single student housing remain
constant at 2,(XX) new units, the dral t
differs from its predecessor by pro
viding up to 687 faculty and staff
units and expediting the constrirc
lion process.
Stanford intends to apply for per
mission to construct 1,000 units with
in two years after the plan is ap
proved.
The change comes in response to
a large group of faculty members
who expressed concern in an Oct. 12
meeting of the Palo Alto City Coun
cil about the lack of available faculty
housing, emphasizing Stanford's de
creased ability to attract and retain
faculty.
Jones said the provision repre
sents "a middle ground" between
the county, which wanted an explicit
timeline, and the University, which
was reluctant to commit to a set plan.
Chris Stromberg, a member of
the Graduate Student Council, said
Stanford had responded to the
needs of the student population.
"The main thing that we asked for
from Stanford after the draft plan
came out on Sept. 20," he said, "was a
timeline as to when we could expect
tosee housing,especially (lie immedi
ate housing projects."
The 350 proposed apartments for
hospital residents anil postgraduate
fellows represent the first opportuni
ty for postgraduates to be housed on
campus.
I and-use designations
The new designations set a bound
ary for academic growth and target
certain campus areas for specific
types of use and development.
Stanford's academic growth
boundary encompasses lands be
tween Sand Mill Road, I I ("amino
Real, Stanford Avenue and Junipcro
Sena Boulevard.
In the current Santa Clara County
General Plan, created in IW), Stan
ford lands are designated ;is either
Open Space and Academic Reserve
or Academic ( ampus.
The new plan eradicates those two
categories to make seven new land
use designations, two of which will
apply to campus residential areas,
three to open space areas, one to pub
lic schools and one to academic cam
pus areas.
Open spate
Many public officials and local res

idents said in public hearings last
month that Stanford should extend
the guarantee of open space, particu
larly in the foothill area, past 10 years.
While the plan released yesterday
doesn't make that guarantee, the cre
ation of the open-space designations
could alleviate some fears.
One of the three open-space des
ignations, open space and academic
reserve, applies to lands outside the
growth boundary. Another category,
special conservation, designates 37 l )
acres of hillside slopes, seismic zones,
species habitat and water reservoirs.
The final designation, also new,
creates a campus open-space catego
ry for areas such as Palm Drive, the
Oval, the Arboretum and Lake La
gunita, that add to the character of
the campus.
"Our feeling is that ultimately we
would like to see that special conser
vation designation ... bind more
tightly for a time period." county
planner Jones said.
Academic faeilities
Over the next 10 years, Stanford's
plan provides for development of
both academic and other facilities on
up to 2,035,(X X) gross sq u a re fee t w i th -
in the Academic Growth Boundary.
The plan cites several examples of
needed academic facilities, including
the Computer Science / Gates
Annex, the Social Science Laborato
ry and the Biomedical Engineering
and Sciences Phase 11.
Other facilities proposed under
the Academic Campus designation
include cultural facilities such as a
possible Palo Alto-Stanford per

forming arts center, and academic
support facilities such as library col
lections, computing facilities, and
childcare and patient care facilities.
Within the 205.000 gross square
feet of athletics and student activities,
the plan details proposals for reno
vating the Stanford football stadium
and replacing Maples Pavilion with a
new basketball arena.
"I like the fact that the plan creates
a new designation for student activi
ties space," said Steven Aronowitz.
chair of the Undergraduate Senate,
who said the senate has been working
all year to attain that student space.
Schools and transportation
Palo Alto and Stanford are cur
rently discussing sitting a middle
school on University land.
Stanford has identified two poten
tial sites, both south ofJunipero Sena
Boulevard. While the Palo Alto
School District requested a site with
in the core campus, Stanford stated in
the plan that identifying such a site
was impossible.
Currently, live public schools are
located on Stanford land.
Stanford also addressed trans
portation and traffic issues in greater
depth than the previous plan, setting
specific requirements for reducing
single-occupancy vehicle traffic. In
accordance with Santa Clara Coun
ty's goal, Stanford must average 1.33
occupants per vehicle during peak
traffic periods.
I he plan also adds 3.095 parking
spaces to campus over the next 10
years, the majority of which are des
ignated for new student housing.

Future plans
Stanford authored the Commu
nity Plan at the request of Santa
Clara County. The county will em
ploy the plan in combination with
the (icneral Use Permit to guide the
use and development of the 47 per
cent of Stanford's lands that lie in
the county for the next 10 years.
Stanford's plans for areas not
contained in Santa Clara county,
such as the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center (SI.AC) and the
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve,
are not explicitly stated in yester
day's plan.
Santa ( lara ('ounty Planning()f
fice will now prepare a draft Envi
ronmental Impact Report for the
community plan, to be completed in
June 2000.
While Stanford will be very ac
tively involved with the county and
the county staff, I lorton said, "it's a
county matter now."
In the coming months, Stanford
will provide information to the
county, voice opinions and testify
about factual matters. And though
his looming retirement may prevent
him from seeing the approval
process through. University Presi
dent (ierhard Casper said the plan is
critical to Stanford's future.
"Stanford is blessed with a land
endowment to support education
and research." Casper said in a let
ter accompanying the plan's release.
"We must protect that endowment
entrusted to us for the future sup
port of the University, while pre
serving the beauty and serenity of
the campus we all treasure."
