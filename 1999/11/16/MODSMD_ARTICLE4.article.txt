# Stanford submits development plan
## 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
The second draft of Stanford's
Land Use Plan affirms the Universi
ty's commitment to new housing
and academic facilities while offer
ing land for a public school and
agreeing to county review of future
development.
Hie revised development plan,
which Stanford's Office of Govern
ment and Community Relations
submitted to Santa Clara County
yesterday following weeks of public
comment, still only extends for 10
years.
That cap is likely to irk Palo Alto
and Menlo Park residents, who crit
icized the first draft for vagueness
and pushed for preserving open
space for at least 25 years.
But because the plan incorpo
rates many of the suggestions of the
County Planning Office, those resi
dents are likely to view it more fa
vorably than its predecessor, partic
ularly its creation of new land-use
designations.
The plan resembles the Sept. 20
first draft in its provisions for creat
ing new campus housing for faculty,
staff and students and developing
new acadcmic facilities.
Larry Horton, Stanford's direc
tor of government and community
relations, called the proposal a good
compromise. "The revised plan re
tains the positive features of the first
draft," he said in a press release,
"and it adds major new provisions in
response to public comment."

Sarah Jones, a Santa Clara Coun
ty planner, called the plan "a much
more complete and comprehensive
piece of work ... we can really eval
uate it now."
The new plan's key provisions
fall into the following categories:
housing, land-use designations,
open space, academic facilities, pub
lic schools and transportation.
Housing
While the new plan's provisions
for single student housing remain
constant at 2,(XX) new units, the dral t
differs from its predecessor by pro
viding up to 687 faculty and staff
units and expediting the constrirc
lion process.
Stanford intends to apply for per
mission to construct 1,000 units with
in two years after the plan is ap
proved.
The change comes in response to
a large group of faculty members
who expressed concern in an Oct. 12
meeting of the Palo Alto City Coun
cil about the lack of available faculty
housing, emphasizing Stanford's de
creased ability to attract and retain
faculty.
Jones said the provision repre
sents "a middle ground" between
the county, which wanted an explicit
timeline, and the University, which
was reluctant to commit to a set plan.
Chris Stromberg, a member of
the Graduate Student Council, said
Stanford had responded to the
