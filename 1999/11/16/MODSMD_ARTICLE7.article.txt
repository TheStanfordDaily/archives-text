### Wenhsin Lee Staff writer 
Polio Key, the Mexican restau
rant that opened three years ago in
Tresidder Union, hopes to improve
its food and image with the help of
Stanford students.
Last week, ASSIJ President
Mike Levin, Vice President John
Mills and Undergraduate Senate
Chair Steven Aronowitz met with
Ray Klein, chairman of Polio Rey
and Una Mas restaurants, to dis
cuss the upcoming changes for
Polio Rey's Stanford location.
JClein contacted Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais and the ASSIJ
earlier this fall to share his ideas for
a new and improved Polio Rey. He

is open to menu ideas and would
also like to change the decor of the
restaurant.
"We're excited that the new
Polio's will soon offer students
much better food at improved
prices," Levin said. "We are hope
ful that Tresidder's newest restau
rant will become a much-needed
student hangout."
Klein, who founded Polio Rey
in 1990 and has since merged his
chain with Una Mas, would like
students to help him improve the
restaurant.
"Polio Rey's is one of the few
options students have on campus
outside of University dining ser
vices," said junior Janet lit),"for
the same amount of money I can

get better burritoes off campus. At
a school like Stanford, we should
have more choices."
Students with menu ideas and
other suggestions should e-mail
comments to president@assu.stan
ford.edu or vp@assu.stanford.edu,
and these comments will be passed
on to Polio Rev.
"While Klein has indicated that
the new Polio's will continue to
serve Mexican food, he is remain
ing very flexible and is willing to lis
ten to student opinion as to what
would be most popular." Levin
said.
In addition to soliciting com
ments and suggestions, the ASSIJ
Office of the President and Vice
President, in conjunction with the

ASSIJ Executive Aides, will he
conducting a contest at the end of
fall quarter to rename Polio Rev.
"The owner of Polio Rey would
like the restaurant to be more
uniquely Stanford â€” from the
names of the menu items to the
name of the restaurant to the din
ing atmosphere," Mills said.
Klein is also hoping to change
the current Mexico-inspired decor
to include Stanford memorabilia.
"Along with Dean Wais, we've
been working very hard to turn
Tresidder into a more student
friendly union, and a new Polio's is
just one of many improvements we
hope will come to fruition in the
weeks and months to come," Levin
said.
