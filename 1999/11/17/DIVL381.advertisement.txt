Now that you've gotten into college,
here's your chance
to really go somewhere.
Congratulations. All the cramming, Insomnia and junk food breakfasts have paid off.
You're In college now - and soon, you'll be facing questions about your life.
Like what to do with the rest of it. One thing is for sure, if you're a
student of color, with an INROADS internship you could have a serious
job every summer while you're still in school - making contacts and gaining
experience in your chosen field of study.
Hey, it won't be easy, but then again if you wanted it easy,
you wouldn't be reading this right now.
