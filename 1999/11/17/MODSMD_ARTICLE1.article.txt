# Counting the hours to Big Game — all of them
## 
### T.J. Babbitt Editorial staff 
A very loud nitrogen train whistle began blowing
in White Plaza early yesterday morning, and has
continued to blow every hour on the hour. The
whistle is part of the Stanford Axe Committee's Big
Game Countdown, which is featuring a star-stud
ded cast of football players and other Stanford no
tables.
The countdown began yesterday morning at 6
a.m., 102 hours before the 102 nd annual Big Game
against UC-Berkeley.
The rally has two goals: to get members of the
Stanford community revved up for Saturday's game
and to spread the word about the Big Game Bonfire
Rally, which will be held this Thursday at 10:30 p.m. in
Arrillaga Plaza.
While the countdown runs 24 hours a day, orga
nizers plan for it to be most interesting from about
noon until 4 p.m each day. That's when Stanford per
sonalities will be around to blow the train whistle, and
when Axe Comm is giving away free souvenir Stan
ford football cups.
Those people who like to collect free stuff can also
look forward to souvenir footballs, T-shirts and other
assorted prizes. According to sophomore Kris An
deen, the countdown director, people who are look
ing for prizes "should be prepared to let Stanford
know how they feel about Cal" — all in good fun, of
course.
Some of the people who are featured at the rally
this year include: head football coach Tyrone Willing
ham. Vice Provost for Student Affairs James Mon
toya, senior wide receiver Troy Walters, junior kicker
Mike Biselli, senior linebacker Sharcus Steen, ASSU
President Mike Levin, ASSU Vice President John
Mills, former Stanford President Don Kennedy. Po
litical Science Prof. Stephen Krasner, the Stanford
Yell Leaders and the Stanford Tree.
The Stanford Yell Leaders are performing every
day in White Plaza at 3 p.m until the game.
The Stanford Band has its own plans for the week,
so it's not scheduled to make an appearance.
The bonfire event, also sponsored by Axe Comm.
will prominently feature the Axe, currently in Stan
ford's hands. Andeen said organizers are allowed to
built a 4-foot bv 4-foot bonfire, which he said should
be fine given the small space.
