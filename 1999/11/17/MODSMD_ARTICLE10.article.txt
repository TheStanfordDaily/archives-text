# Dispute over sale of Nixon's estate
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Thousands of dollars
for President Richard Nixon's handwritten self-cri
tiques. Several hundred thousand for his "I have
never been a quitter" resignation speech. Millions
more for his secret tape recordings. Add it all up,
lawyers representing the former president's estate
told a court Tuesday, and it is worth $35.5 million plus
millions more in compounded interest.
Not so. the government said. The Nixon estate
lawyers' estimated values of Nixon items are based
on a "mythical, magical, make-believe world of their
dreams," Neil Koslowe, a Justice Department lawyer,
told U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn.
Tuesday was the finale of a lengthy trial to deter
mine how much — if anything — the government
should pay Nixon's heirs for the more than 40 million
pages of documents, 3,700 hours of tape recordings,
photos and other items it confiscated when Nixon
resigned.
Former White House Counsel John Dean and
Alexander Butterfield, the Nixon aide who spilled
the beans about Nixon's secret tape-recording sys
tem. testified at the trial, as did scores of historians
and archivists.
The estate says it wants $35.5 million, plus millions
in interest. If the judge placed a $30 million value on
the materials, for example, the total compensation,
including interest, compounded annually, would be
roughly $210 million, according to Nixon estate
lawyer R. Stan Mortenson.
Justice Department lawyers remain opposed to
any compensation. But they say if something must be
paid, a fair value would be no more than $2.2 million.
"The court should put an end to this attempt by the
Nixon estate to obtain a windfall from the taxpayers,"
the government said in its post-trial brief.
To underscore the material's historical value,
Mortenson replayed a video of Nixon making his res
ignation speech. The teary-eyed president's words to
the nation on Aug. 8, 1974, broke the silence in the
courtroom: "1 have never been a quitter. To leave
office before my term is complete is abhorrent to
every instinct in my body Therefore I shall resign
the presidency effective at noon tomorrow."
Drafts and the actual copy of the speech in Nixon's
hand as he announced his resignation would have

sold for $200,000 to $300,000, according to appraisers
hired by the estate.
"What docs the government say?" Mortenson
asked. "The government says it's worth nothing —
zip, zero, nada, nothing."
He recalled testimony by appraisers who valued
Nixon's tape recordings at $12 million and priced
papers on which the president scribbled his personal
goals at $20,000. Even tapes containing Nixon's
embarrassing ethnic slurs would have been valuable,
he said.
"No, he would not have sold those conversations,
but he sure could have," Mortenson said. "There cer
tainly would have been a market for them. In fact, his
enemies would have made up that market."
Koslowe, the government's lawyer, argued that
Nixon intended his materials to be preserved as a his
torical archive for researchers.
"As of December 1974, the Nixon materials were
a mass of undifferentiated boxes containing 44 mil
lion documents stacked on pallets in the Eisenhower
Office Building with primitive, minimal finding aids,"
Koslowe said. "The 950 tapes were stored in a broom
closet under a stairwell, with no index, no log and no
transcripts."
Fights over the Nixon collection began 25 years
ago when he resigned to avoid impeachment over the
Watergate affair. Congress passed a law confiscating
what Nixon left behind, and over the years hundreds
of thousands of documents and hundreds of hours of
tapes have been open for public perusal.
Six years after his materials were seized. Nixon
sued for compensation, which he claimed he was due
because presidential documents at the time were
deemed personal, not government property.
In 1991, the judge, who is hearing this case without
a jury, ruled that Nixon was entitled to nothing. But
the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington overruled
Penn and ordered him to conduct this new trial.
The case pivots on a legal argument.
Justice Department lawyers claim the value of the
material must be based on its existing use at the time
it was seized — unless a more profitable use was like
ly in the near future. Nixon lawyers say that even
though Nixon was not planning to sell the materials,
he could have.
