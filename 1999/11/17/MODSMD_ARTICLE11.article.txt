# China joins World Trade Organization

### 
BEIJING (AP) — Chinese consumers. Internet
entrepreneurs and nimble high-tech firms. To the list
of China's winners in its breakthrough trade deal with
the United States add Chinese Premier Zlui Rongji.
With two timely interventions when talks verged
on collapse, Zhu salvaged his ambitious mandate to
overhaul China's economy, mired in foot-dragging by
domestic interests, and managed to restore a little lus
ter to the promise that greeted his climb to premier 21)
months ago.
" This is a political turning point for Zhu Rongji."
said Wang Shan, a political commentator and author.
Zhu has been the most avid advocate of China's
joining the capitalist World Fradc Organization
among the ruling Communist Party's collective lead
ership. And the deal struck Monday with the United
States clears the biggest hurdle in China's 13-year
quest to join world trade's leading body.
Heralded as an incorruptible straight-talker in
China and a pragmatic reformer abroad. Zhu took
office vowing to remove vestiges of central planning
and usher in free markets. Ordinary Chinese and low
level officials loved his candor even as he pledged to
lay them off by slashing the bureaucracy and bloated
state industry payrolls.
Hut when the bite took, his popularity began to
suffer and his reforms stalled. And then Zhu stum
bled in Washington.
Hoping to conclude a WTO deal. Zhu offered
unprecedented access to China's relatively closed
markets, only to be rejected by President Bill Clinton.
After Clinton aides posted Zhu's concessions on
the Internet, opposition among threatened state
industries, bureaucrats and communist conservatives
coalesced. Some called Zhu a traitor — an attitude
that hardened after NATO bombed the Chinese
Embassy in Yugoslavia in what the government
labeled a Washington plot.
On the retreat, Zhu was little seen in the state
media and when he was it was to discuss grain pur
chasing and other piecemeal efforts. Hong Kong
media reported that Zhu offered his resignation to
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who refused,
although Jiang and his proteges took over some of
Zhu's portfolios.
"The kind of very aggressive push that Zhu exhib
ited in the first year is essentially gone. Jiang has had

to conic in to for state enterprise reform. Jiang
has had to come hack for WTO," said Dali Yang, a
China scholar at the University of Chicago. "Zhu's
major ideas are still there, but he is certainly hurt."
So Zhu's interventions in the WTO talks came as a
bold stroke. Concessions he sanctioned in a 90-
minute meeting with U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky and Clinton economics adviser
Gene Sperling on Saturday pushed the negotiations
forward, a diplomat familiar with the talks said.
When the deal unraveled and Barshefsky and
Sperling threatened to leave Monday morning, Zhu
surprised them by showing up at the foreign trade
ministry, the diplomat said. Sperling called it a "piv
otal meeting" that cleared the way for the market
access agreement signed eight hours later.
I lie agreement not only signals Zhu's return from
disfavor but that Jiang and other members of the
party Politburo inner circle are backing his reform
agenda.
Zhu and his like-minded colleagues hope to use
WTO as a prod to push reluctant state industries to
adopt the reforms they resisted or whither under
global competition. It is a risky strategy.
While Chinese consumers may be able to buy low
cost imports and Internet startups and computer
makers max gain access to the foreign investment and
technology they need to thrive, some state firms and
small family farms will surely fail, forcing up unem
ployment and the chances for unrest.
" I his adds a kind of pressure to Chinese indus
tries. I hcv must reform and raise efficiency so that
they can compete globally and can survive," said Jia
Oingguo. a politics expert at Peking University. "If
they survive that's good. But if they can't?"
Perhaps for Zhu. that's why his comeback is a
quiet one. Leading state-run newspapers on their
front pages carried reports and photos of Jiang's con
gratulations to the U.S. negotiating team after the
deal was signed. But there was scarcely a mention of
Zhu.
"China's entering WTO will quite possibly exert
the greatest influence 011 Zhu Rongji's political life.
But whether it's good or not is hard to judge now,"
said Wang, the political commentator. "If China can
not overcome the pressures building from unemploy
ment. then he will not be able to survive'."
