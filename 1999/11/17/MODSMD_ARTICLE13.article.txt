Changes in trademark
policy should be
approached cautiously

With the seemingly never
ending expansion of the
Internet and Stanford's
greater presenee in the publie lime
light, proteeting the school's good
name is becoming an increasingly dif
ficult task. It appears that more and
more opportunists are going to
greater lengths to associate them
selves with the University's high pro
file status and profit from that associ
ation.
Without a doubt, being attached to
the Stanford name (regardless of how
tenuous that attachment is) lends a
certain degree of credibility and
added stature to any enterprise. Some
faculty see this as a problem, and a
number of changes to the University's
trademark policy have been pro
posed.
These efforts toward change are to
be highly commended. 'ITie low over
head costs, quick turnaround time
and wide reach associated with the
Internet seems to have particularly
exacerbated the problem of trade
mark infringement.
In the past, the problem stemming
from an organization's improper use
of the University's name may have at
least been confined to the local area.
These days, the global nature of the
Internet makes it more difficult to
detect an improper use of the Stan
ford name and to prevent the poten
tially damaging effects to the school's
reputation.
The possibilities for rapid and
widespread misunderstanding are

enormous. The intricacies of the
Internet have also made "cyber
squatting"— where outside parties
purchase Stanford-related domain
names with the intention of re-selling
them to the University for a profit or
another group for commercial pur
poses — an important issue.
Stanford's continued success as an
institution depends on the preserva
tion of the credibility and high stand
ing associated with its name. In order
to maintain that, the University must
take measures to prevent others from
disingenuously associating it with
their ventures. The considerations
associated with the new medium of
the Internet require more creative
and effective solutions.
At the same time, however, Uni
versity officials should be careful in
their efforts. The line for trademark
infringement can often be blurred.
For example, there are a number of
local businesses — car dealerships,
hotels and restaurants — using the
Stanford name. One could reasonably
question whether they should be left
out of these efforts. In spite of the fact
that these businesses may be on solid
legal ground with respect to trade
mark infringement, they could also
unintentionally be contributing to an
"erosion" or cheapening of the Stan
ford name.
Iliis issue is without a doubt an
enormously complicated and multi
faceted one. Overzealous and unnec
essary protection of Stanford's name
would only work to harm the Univer
sity's relations with the private sector.
At the same time, strong action must
be taken to preserve the stature and
credibility associated with this univer
sity.
