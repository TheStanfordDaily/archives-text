Controversy over Frosh T
shirt design overplayed
The controversy caused by the Class of
2(X)3 T-shirt design is just one more example
ol political correctness gone overboard at
Stanford.
A drawing of James Bond and his cus
tomary Bond girls has become the target of
charges ranging from "promoting gender
stereotypes" to "ignorant and insensitive." I
suppose that makes all of the Bond movies
— and of course anyone who contributes to
their cause by paying to see them — ignorant
and insensitive as well?
Far too often, harmless creativity and fun
on campus are stilled by students who claim
that they are "offended" by something.
Remember the "Pimps and Hos" party at
Roble last month that almost got axed? I'm a
staunch liberal, and I agree that it wouldn't
have hurt for the design to feature people of
varying ethnicities — but to suggest that it
was even marginally racist or sexist is abso
lutely ridiculous.

To me, people who level this sort of
thoughtless accusation are infinitely more
offensive than the T-shirt. At an institution
terrified of being perceived as insensitive,
students are well aware that they can subvert
an entire democratic process just hy men
tioning a wurd like "racist."
We waste our time and energy on these
issues because we can't seem to differentiate
between the petty and the important, the
perceived problems and the real ones. The
sentiment at Stanford is that we would rather
censor a hundred innocent ideas than let a
single inappropriate one offend someone.
I low about this? Instead of a semi-clever,
visually appealing take on James Bond, we
have a boring picture of trees that "repre
sents our cultural diversity." As usual, the
"offended" would have proved their point: if
you can't please everyone, don't please any
one.

Examine your own motiva
tions, don V slander the career
choices of others
Students from schools such as Harvard,
Stanford and Berkeley will inevitably end
up taking many of the best (paying) jobs in
a variety of fields. Some of us therefore
will inevitably have a moral crisis, think
ing: are we taking ritzy jobs because we
think we will find fulfillment or because
we are greedy, money-hungry "corporate
whores?"
I believe that this crisis is healthy, a sign
that we might be sentient beings, not
mindless "corporate whores." Yet. some
of us avoid examining the credibility of
our own career goals by slandering those
of others. Investment bankers feel less
guilty about their own high-powered,
highly-moneyed career path by noting that
at least they aren't pre-meds. Similarly,
aspiring consultants find comfort by scoff
ing at the investment bankers.

This is why I was irked by Mike Rosen
bluth's column, "Have I become a Corpo
rate Whore?" Rosenbluth states that his
career goal is to become an engineering
entrepreneur — a Silicon Valley type. As
Jerry Yang of Yahoo! and Sabeer Bhatia
of Hotmail exemplify, this kind of career
can yield power and quantities of money
unheard of in investment banking, a pro
fession which Rosenbluth denigrates as
"the Enemy."
It seems to me that Rosenbluth wishes
to downplay his own lust for money and
power by criticizing that of his "corporate
whore" classmates. How ironic! I think
that Rosenbluth would do himself a ser
vice by examining his own motivations for
becoming an engineering entrepreneur
rather than looking for solace by denounc
ing what he perceives as sell-out profes
sions.
