# Fighting the good fight
## Corey Griffin Big Game is coming to town 
### 
While I know it's
Big Game
week, it can't
help feeling like it is
Christmas time.
There's our Band "carol
ing" all across campus,
some Weenies roasting

over an open fire at the Big Game Rally and
Nutcrackcr-esque Gaieties to put you in
that Big Game mood.
More importantly, 1 can't think of anoth
er time growing up when so many people
are anticipating one day. There's so much
— for lack of a better word — electricity in
the air. I find myself screaming, not eating,
singing "All Right Now" and doing impul
sive things such as dying my hair cardinal
red, all in the name of Big Game.
Indeed, Big Game week is here and has
once again invaded our already busy fall
quarter schedule.
How much does Big Game week really
impact your life though? I don't think I can
tolerate hearing the phrase, "With all the
stuff going on during Big Game week. I've
been really busy." People say they're really
caught up in Big Game fever, but I wonder
it they really are. Tell me if the following
thought process sounds familiar.
"Who has time for school spirit when
I've got midterms and dead week less than
two weeks away? Of course, I'll go to Gai
eties — well, only if my friends going on
Wednesday say it's pretty good. I've heard
the Band playing a couple times after my 11
a.m. class, but I don't have time to just stand
around when all the food is gone if I'm even
five minutes late to lunch. The Thursday

night "bonfire" rally? Please. I have a prob
lem set due Friday, and I've heard the Band
enough this week. I'm definitely going to
the game. Besides, my girlfriend from Cal is
coming over."
Excluding the Band (which admittedly
makes up a huge part of the undergraduate
population), the Gaieties folk, the Axe
Committee and the football team, who else
is significantly impacted by Big Game
week?
Before you get mad at me and write let
ters to The Daily about how you have
school pride, I know there are some of you
out there with Stanford in your blood.
You've seen the Band read the eulogy for
the bear every year. You keep the Axe
Committee company during the Big Game
Countdown. You go to two nights of Gai
eties. You sleep out (two nights — and not
for a frat) to get a good spot for Big Game.
Unfortunately, such people are few and
far between. What is it that makes everyone
so apathetic around here? We're pissed
when our football team is losing (because
we know our friends at other schools are
going to make fun of us), but we still don't
cheer them on and support them when they
are down — when they need it the most.
I've been to too many football games
when the fans for the visiting team make far
more noise than the student section, and
this can't happen during Big Game. There
are more junior high girls watching the
women's soccer team than Stanford stu
dents. Who can say they've watched even
part of a Cardinal water polo game?

My friends, we go to one of the finest
universities in the world. We also have the

best collegiate athletics program in the
nation. We should be damn proud, and we
should let the world outside of the Stanford
bubble see that pride.
I'm not asking you to paint your face red
and attend every Stanford athletic event
(besides, that red paint never comes com
pletely out of your clothes). I know we all
have our own lives, our own schedules and
our own priorities. That doesn't mean we
shouldn't take the time to at least seek out
that varsity athlete that lives down the hall
and ask them how his or her season is going.
That doesn't mean you can't scream your
lungs out when our defense needs to stop
Cal when it's third and goal.
Now everyone — students, faculty and
administrators — has the chance to redeem
themselves. It's Big Game week once again,
and there is more on the line than there has
been in decades.
Support the football team; come to the
Big Game Rally. Support the Band; hang
out for a few minutes and listen to them
play (odds are more than two of your
friends are the in the Band). Support the
Axe Committee; plug your ears when pass
ing through White Plaza. Support Gaieties
— well, only if it's funny. Most importantly,
come to Big Game and yell every single
time Cal has the ball.
Ready or not: Big Game week is here.

tural Engineering. He hopes Santa brings all
the good hoys and girls at Stanford a big bou
quet of roses.
