## Ben Jones Big Game 101

Unless you've been in the witness
protection program for the last
few weeks or buried in the bowels of
Sweet Hall hunting the wumpus or
whatever the hell ('S majors do. you
know that this Saturday is show time.
It's Big Game.
And unless you are donating a
spleen or giving an acceptance
speech for the Nobel Peace Prize,
you have no excuse but to he in the
student section wearing red face
paint and chanting "Beat the Wee
nies" on Saturday.

•; Big Game is what going to Stan
ford is all about. From the Bearial to
•'the secret LSJUMB jam session to
"|Gaities, Stanford students for once
"•dedicate all their energies to a single
I purpose — winning Big Game.
*• So for you freshman and those up
'♦perclassmen. who, by some act of
*tGod, have missed out on the Big
mayhem, let me give you a
•'brief introduction to the Cardinal
• 'and-White hysteria that will greet
■ 'you on Saturday.
!• It all began as a friendly game of
the newly invented football between
two Bay Area rivals in the Spring of
1892.
One hundred and seven years and
! 101 "Big Games" later, it is an all-out
!*war between two of the nation's most
i •
athletic and academic
universities — the Cardinal of Le
*"land Stanford Junior University and
Mhe dreaded Golden Bears of the
of California-Berkeley.
•1 Big Game has become one of col
lege football's most storied and in
tense rivalries, ranking with the an
• nual showdowns between Texas and
'.Texas A&M. Michigan and Ohio
State and t ISC and IJC I .A.
The games, which from IIXXil l XXi to
1919 were contested in rugby rather
than football, have seen some of col
lege football's most storied athletes.
Vtrom Ernie Nevers to John Elway.
■'.Vand coaches from Fop Warner to Bill
Walsh.
*• Big (ianie has become more than
-I just a football game — it has come to
a rivalry between Stanford
•!and the "Weenies" of Cal that, il you
•1 believe the trash-talking on both
• * sides of the field, is one of campus
'[culture and socioeconomics as well.
I*Cal fans berate the Cardinal as
!•spoiled, elitist kids living in the bub
! ble of the Stanford campus while the
** Cardinal backers retort with chants
of "We got in" as a barb to the appar
ent bitterness of Cal students unable
to attend school here at the Farm.
You want intense?
Exhibit A: In 1997. altera thrilling
victory, Cal students
stormed the field to confront the cel
ebrating Stanford crowd and proced
ed to pull down one of the Stanford
Stadium goal posts. (Note to C al
fans: you're supposed to tear down

goalposts when you win)
Exhibit B: In 1998. Berkeley fans
again confronted Stanford students
celebrating a Big (iame win. They
threw shoes, socks, pieces of the field,
rocks, bottles and everything but the
kitchen sink. Shoes? Who throws
shoes?
Filled with emotion year-in and
year-out. Big Game has witnessed
thrilling and unexpected moments.
None more so than "the Play."
which ended the 1982 contest.
After F.lwav led Stanford to what
appeared to be a game-winning field
goal with just seconds remaining. Gal
took the ensuing kickoff and after a
series of supposedly legal laterals and
an apparently downed knee, broke
free into the clear much to the sur
prise of the irrepressible Stanford
Band, which had taken the field in
celebration.
Gal's Richard Rogers bowled
through Stanford trombone player
Gary l yrell to score the game-win
ning touchdown and only add fuel to
the flames of the Big Game fire.
" The Play" was not a happy time
in Stanford football history. It was
also not a happy time in Stanford
trombone history. Poor Gary. He
still feels the footsteps and he still has
a mortal fear of astroturf.
Then of course there is the Axe,
the prize that goes to each year's Big
Game champion, perhaps the buzz
word most frequently heard around
the Cal and Stanford campuses in the
middle of November.
The tradition of the Axe dates
back to 18%. when Stanford's yell
leaders devised a cheer for the sports
teams which survives today — The
Axe Yell (Give 'em the Axe...). The
yell was given a tangible presence
just three years later when the yell
leaders purchased a gleaming red
bladed axe at a local hardware store
prior to a Stanford-Gal baseball
game and proceeded to decapitate a
stuffed bear to energize the crowd.
The blade of the axe quickly be
came the symbol of the intense Stan-
al rivalry and was "liberated"
by a group of Gal fans a short time
later. It would find residence first in a
fraternity house and then locked in
the vault of a bank, taken out only for
Gal's annual Spring pep rally.
That lasted until 1930, when a
fearless group of Stanford students,
dubbed "the Immortal 21," recap
tured the Axe in a daring raid against
an overwhelming number of (ioldcn
Bear backers. Let's just say that there
was tear gas involved in the incident.
In 1933 the presidents of both uni
versities decided to put an end to the
mayhem and make the Axe the offi
cial pri/e to each year's winner. The
Axe remains at the winning school
until the next Big Game and
is.proudly displayed on the field by
Stanford's Axe Committee and Gal's
Rally Committee.
Stanford has captured and re
tained the Axe the last four years
with thrilling victories, including a cli
mactic win in the l(X)th Big Game in
1997. If you missed the point of that
last sentence, go back and read it
again, twice.

What this means is that a whole
class of kids went their entire four
years at Berzerkeleyand never got to
feel the glory of winning Big Game.
The last two Big Games, relative
ly meaningless for both teams, who
were suffering through mediocre to
below-average seasons, have been
among the most intense in history.
This year promises to be no differ
ent, but with an added shot of adren
aline as Stanford puts its Rose Bowl

hopes on the line against a Cal squad
hungry to avenge four-straight losses
and end the Cardinal's rosy millenni
um plans. Think Cal will be fired up
for the game? Yeah, just a tad.
So there you have it. The entire
history of Big Game in a nutshell.
Saturday I expect to see every one of
you there, yelling your lungs out. Let
the wumpus go for a day. Go Cardi
nal!

Ben Jones, a junior, in a rare departure
for a Texan, has never hunted any
thing, not even a wumpus.
