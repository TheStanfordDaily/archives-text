### Ani khondkaryan 
Yesterday, several administrators of the
Stanford Blood Center and a group of con
cerned students met at El Centro Chicano
in an effort to discuss what some students
say is homophobic and racist Blood Center
protocol.
The controversy was spurred by several
federally-mandated questions on question
naires and pamphlets issued by the C enter
to prospective blood donors.
The pamphlet, which must be read by
the donors before they can donate, contains
two controversial prohibitions. Men who

have had sexual contact with another man
even once since 1c)77l c )77 cannot donate, and
neither can anyone who was born in. or has
lived in. Cameroon, the Central African
Republic, Chad. Congo. Equatorial
(iuinea, (iabon. Niger or Nigeria since 1 1 )77
or has ever had sexual contact with anyone
in this category.
"These questions imply that these are
the ways one gets lIIV and that every sexu
ally active homosexual male is at a high risk
of contacting HIV. which is not necessarily
true, especially if they pass an 1 1IV test and
wait for a certain amount of time," said ju
nior Eric Ashton.

"The purpose of this meeting is to get the
SUinlord Blood Center to recognize the of
fensive nature of these pamphlets," said
freshman Lyndon Gill, who organized the
meeting.
The Blood Center representatives ex
plained the reasoning behind the prohibi
tions.
The FDA sets laws and specifications
for donoring," said Dr. Susan Galcl, the
Blood Center's associate medical director,
in response to questions regarding the
seemingly discriminatory wording of the
pamphlets. "We have no control
over the questions required bv the
FDA. The FDA designed these
questions to screen people who are
at an increased risk of being infected
by HIV. and according to statistics,
gav men are the largest risk group."
The administrators said the
screening is especially important
since the tests mav not detect dis

eases such as malaria, and may miss
HIV if the virus is in the early stages.
"The purpose of the Blood Cen
ter is to provide a safe and plentiful
supply of blood and perform re
search in transfusions," Galel said.
According to Vincent Yalon. a
Blood Center administrator, the
FDA decides on the criteria to
screen donors according to specifi
cations set by Congress, so that if
people of to change the criteria,
their best chance is to re-open the
issue through their congressional

representative.
A letter-writing campaign for
that purpose has already been
planned. It will be headed by Ash
ton. and it will target the FDA. sev
eral members of Congress and other
blood centers.
Those who want to find out more
about the campaign can join the e
mail list "health-discussion." To join
the campaign, students should meet
outside Columbae on Friday at 3
p.m.
"The purpose of the campaign

will be to increase sensitivity so that
the Blood Center will use language
that will not offend people," Ashton
said.
The meeting ended on an opti
mistic note, with the Blood Center
administrators agreeing to consider
adding fuller explanations of the
prohibitions.
"We wanted the administration
to distance themselves from the
FDA regulations, and they seemed
pretty receptive," Gill said in con
clusion.
