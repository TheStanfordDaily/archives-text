meets sponsored by Le Federation
Internationale de Natation (FINA),
the governing body of international

swimming. will feature many of the
world's top swimmers, all seeking to
gain experience swimming against
each other before the 2000
Olympics.
Would the Stanford women's
swim team, currently ranked third
in the nation, miss this opportunity
to compete in such a high-caliber
meet, where the Cardinal will be up
against some of the most talented
swimmers in the world?
Of course not, especially since
head coach Richard Quick was al
ready thinking about his team's
"Olympic" needs during the first
week of the unofficial season.
"This is an Olympic year, so we

will be flying to Vancouver to give
the women experience swimming in
a 25-meter pool".
Although the World Cup meet
will offer its participants invaluable
experience, only one Stanford
swimmer, sophomore Shelly Rip
ple, will be traveling this week to
compete in the meet.
Ripple was the lone team mem
ber to choose to compete in this
meet, whereas the remainder of the
team chose to compete in another
equally valuable meet, the U.S
Open, Dec. 2-4 in San Antonio,
Texas Quick, realizing that academ
ic schedules begin to compete with
athletic schedules at this lime of
year, allowed the women to choose
which meet they would prefer to
travel to.

weekend at Stanford, in which she
won three events, will be competing
in six events this week: the 50, 100
and 200-meter backstroke, the 200
butterfly and the 200 and 100 indi
vidual medleys.
What is she hoping to accomplish
in ihis large pile of races?
"I hope to get fast times." Ripple
said.

Considering Ripple's traveling
companions, not to mention the in
ternational competition that will be
flying in from around the world.
Ripple should have no problem ac
complishing her goals.
Thompson, winner of five
()lvmpic gold medals and holder of
the 100-meter butterfly world
record, as well as Data Torress, a

three-time Olympian, will both be
accompanying Ripple.
