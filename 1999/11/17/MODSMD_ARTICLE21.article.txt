# Seniors anchor Cardinal soccer squad
## Talented class forms tight-knit group on the field and off

One could say that head coach
Steve Swanson and this year's se
niors on the women's soccer team
were all in the same freshman class,
('minted, like the other seniors in
the group. Swanson will not don a
cap and gown this spring at (iradua
tion.
However, Swanson and the se
niors (Kelly Adamson. Christy

Arnold. Catherine Bernard. Ron
nie Fair. Shauna ltri, Natalie Kim.
Jennifer O'Sullivan and Wendi
Whitman) have two very speeial
things in common: they all came to
the Farm the same year and they in
tend to leave a strong legacy of
women's soccer behind them.
This year, the No. N Stanford
women's soccer team has achieved
more than any other team since
1993. This team has clinched the Pa
cific 10 Conference title and will ad

vance to the third round of NCAA
this Friday night in South Bend, Ind.
The last time the Cardinal made it
this far in the Tournament was
when the team made an appearance
in the 1993 NCAA Final Four.
In the years preceding the arrival
of Swanson and the seniors in 1996,
the women's soccer program at
Stanford achieved relative success,
demonstrated in its six consecutive
appearances in the NCAA Tourna
ment since 1990.1 lowever, the pro

gram appeared to lack internal sta
bility and was on rocky ground.
When Swanson arrived at Stanford,
he was the third coach those seniors
had seen in their lour years in a Car
dinal uniform.
"People that were around the
program would know that it was a
pretty unstable ship for a variety of
reasons," Swanson said. "I knew it
would be a challenge and that is one
of the reasons I came."
After the arrival of Swanson and
this year's graduating class, the
focus of the program shifted. It
seemed to move toward the estab
lishment of a stable program that
would ensure not just a winning sea
son, but a lasting legacy of success.
"We wanted to turn it around,"
Swanson said. "We wanted to get
Stanford back where it should be,
which is among the top programs in
the country. That's always been my
goal. I said the very first day, 'The
dream that you have is that you're
sitting in a packed house. Stanford is
in the final and you're competing
for a national championship."'
Although this was the long-term
aspiration for the Cardinal, Stan
ford was faced with adversity that
first year. With 10 freshman on the
squad, the Cardinal also was sad
dled with eight season-ending in
juries. The Cardinal did make it to
the first round of the NCAA Tour
nament that year, but the significant
strides for the team were not made
on the field.
"Our first goal that first year was
to try to get it positive, to try to have
the team feeling good about what's
here and that it's stable." Swanson
said. "What's happened now is that
we've just grown every year since
then.
"To win in any sport in college is
difficult, but I think to establish a

Along with head coach Steve Swanson, the seniors on this year's women's soccer team have helped
put solid ground under a previously shaky program.
