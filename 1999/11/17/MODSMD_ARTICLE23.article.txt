## Who cares about bacteria? 
### Katharine Miller 
If you think of bacteria as your
enemies — something to scrub off
your hands and wash down the sink
— think again. Those who study
these mysterious, silent, invisible
creatures know that they do far more
good than harm.
Microbes are an integral ingredi
ent of the Earth's ecosystem. Virtual
ly everything on Earth — soil, water,
air. plants and animals — is teeming
with these microscopic organisms. In
fact, trillions of them live around you.
on you and inside you.
Despite their close relationship
to humans, we understand very lit
tle about bacteria and microbes. A
recent series entitled "Intimate
Strangers: Unseen life of Earth,"
currently airing on PBS, tells the
scientific story of microbes in order
to give a better picture of our rela
tionship with these invisible crea
tures.
"Intimate" might seem an odd
adjective for what we commonly
refer to as germs, but as the PBS
show makes wonderfully clear, it is
entirely apt.
Each living organism contains
within itself a written history of life
on earth: the genetic code. Studies of
this code in both humans and bacte
ria have shown that humans have
more similarities to germs than dif
ferences.
Using musical notes to represent
the four nucleotides that make up
our genetic code, the show portrays
the similarities between bacterial and
human genes. The "melodies" played

by our genes are very much like those
of some bacteria.
Indeed, our genetic relationship to
bacteria is much closer than the rela
tionship between modern bacteria
and the earliest single-celled organ
isms, the Archaea.
Unlike the genetic differences
between humans and bacteria —
which are akin to differences
between two melodies — the differ
ences between bacteria and archaea
are more dramatic changes in musi
cal style and rhythm.
It is sometimes difficult for us,
with a 70-80 year lifespan, to grasp
that we evolved from bacteria only
very recently. If we compress the
history of the existence of life on
earth into a single day, then humans
have been around for only a few sec
onds.
On the other hand, bacteria and
their predecessors, beginning with
something like the Archaea. have
been around for the entire day.
Indeed, the only forms of life that
have existed from dawn until dusk
are the single-celled organisms.
The show emphasizes not only
our genetic similarity to bacteria but
also our dependence on bacteria for
survival. Bacteria maintain the chem
istry of the biosphere. They form the
basis of the food web and are respon
sible for the production of most of
the Earth's oxygen.
All plant and animal life depend
on the existence of single-celled
organisms. On the other hand, bacte
ria could exist quite successfully with
out any plants or animals. Ultimately,
all life relies on these tinv. invisible

creatures.
Our genetic similarity to bacteria
also makes them useful for research.
There are genes in intestinal bacteria,
Escherichia coli, that correct errors in
DN A when it is being copied. It turns
out that many people have a similar
gene that prevents errors in human
DNA replication.
People who do not have this gene
are prone to colon cancer because
their DNA develops errors in it while
replicating. Thanks to studies in bac
teria. we can now screen people for
the risk of colon cancer by the
absence of this bacteria gene homo
logue.
Microbes also play an active role
in sustaining health. Bacteria that
inhabit our skin provide a natural
shield against disease. Bacteria in our
intestines make B vitamins that are
essential to our health.
In their competition, microbes
produce substances that ward off
competitors. We exploit these sub
stances as life-saving antibiotics such
as penicillin and erythromycin.
The "Intimate Strangers" series
airs every Tuesday night in the
month of November. If you watch
the series for the next two Tuesdays,
you will learn about how microbes
both cause and help heal infectious
disease and how they can help solve
global problems by cleaning up pol
lution, improving agricultural pro
duction and helping create new
antibiotics.
By the time the series is over, the
critters you wash off your hands
every day may not be enemies but
intimate friends.
