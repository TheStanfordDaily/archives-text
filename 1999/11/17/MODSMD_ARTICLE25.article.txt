# Can your computer understand?
## 
### Cindy Lin Contributing writer 
Ever been frustrated or angry
with your computer? Most people
have, despite knowing that a com
puter is incapable of responding to
their emotional outbursts. What if
your computer could respond to
your emotions? By studying how
emotional responses to computers
are generated, researchers are hop
ing to improve human-computer
interactions.
The attempt to improve the
interaction between people and
computers has generated much

research. Two Stanford rese
archers, Assoc. Prof. Clifford Nass
and Professor Byron Reeves, are
drawing from the fields of cognitive
science, psychology, communica
tion and computer science to study
social responses to communication
technology.
In 1996, the professors co
authored a book, "The Media
Equation," which presents multiple
psychological studies as proof that
people treat and respond to com
puters and other forms of media
like real people and places.
For instance, their studies show
that people treat computers with

female voices differently than
male-voiced computers. Also,
images of large faces on a television
screen tend to give viewers a sense
of invasion of personal space.
"We can definitely experience
emotional responses when interact
ing with media with the same status
and importance as normal emo
tions," Reeves said.
"1 think it is inevitable, we |as
humans] are built to have emotion
al responses that we cannot turn
off."
Our natural tendency to express
emotions, even toward inanimate
objects such as computers, can be

used to develop computers.
According to Reeves, in order
for computers to interact better
with humans, they must be
designed with the ability to recog
nize and understand emotions.
To address this issue, Nass and
Reeves are looking at how media
incites sensual arousal. "The main
question is, what structurally about
media is arousing?" Reeves said.
"Arousal is a good predictor of
where a person gives his attention
and what he will remember,"
Reeves said. "Understanding the
emotion of arousal can influence
how we advertise, how politicians
campaign and how teachers
instruct through media."
American culture pushes for
larger television screens, surround
sound and wide movie screens to
provide stimulation of the visual
and auditory senses, said Reeves.
1 lis studies have shown that dra
matic scenes of plane crashes,
extreme sports and reports of mur
der on the nightly news can all
arouse emotions.
While forms of mass media may
evoke our emotions, only comput
ers have the potential to respond to
them.
"With television, we cannot
change what is occurring, but a
computer display can change with
regard to human input." Reeves
said.
By understanding how decisions
and perceptions are molded by
what people see and hear. Reeves
and Nass hope that sensory tech
nology can be incorporated into
computer design.
They believe that if computer
designers know the causes of emo
tional responses of humans, they
might be able to design a machine
that is sensitive to how its user
feels.
This could come in the form of
technology that recognizes facial
expressions, voice cues or physio
logical changes.
"Computers could be designed
with sensors or electrodes to mea
sure changes in heart rate, conduc
tance of the skin, motion or perspi
ration." Reeves said.
Reeves hopes that by incorpo
rating technology that allows for
basic perception abilities, a future
in which humans can interact with
computers in a more social nature
will be possible.
