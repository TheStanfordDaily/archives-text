## The 						scoop on vaccines 
### Monya De Contributing writer 
In a society increasingly con
cerned with preventive health, vac
cines have rightly emerged as a first
punch to influenza, meningitis, hep
atitis Band other diseases. Stanford
students line up regularly at Cowcll
Student Health Center to roll up
their sleeves and push those pesky
fevers out of the picture for another
quarter. But what does that shot
really do for you — and is it
enough?
The influenza vaccine consists of
a solution of the organisms that
cause it. but the viruses are killed so
they cannot cause illness. 1 he body,
however, reacts with alarm, produc
ing antibodies that protect the per
son by binding to the foreign organ
isms.
When the organisms, or anti
gens. have been disposed of, the
antibodies remain in the system and
are poised to attack any flu virus of
the same type that might come
along.
It is recommended that the shot
be taken every year by those at risk
due to the fact that the flu virus
mutates quickly. Mutations create
antigens that the body does not rec
ognize and is not prepared to
attack.
Despite the beliel that the flu is
only a minor nuisance and not wor
thy of a vaccine, physicians encour
age anyone who wants to reduce his
chance of getting influenza to
receive the vaccine.
Another myth surrounds the
effectiveness of the vaccine. The
varied results of the influenza vac
cine have more to do with the
health of the host than the vaccine
itself.
Healthy young adults might
avoid tin l X) percent of the time,
while a nursing home resident with
other ailments might be protected
only 50 percent of the time.
According to the Centers for
Disease Control, college students
who live in dormitories are among
those particularly recommended to
receive the vaccine.
Just as epidemics careen through
army barracks, the close quarters »112
dorms lend themselves to major
outbreaks.

Other target groups include the
elderly and the very young, those
with chronic illnesses, children on
long-term aspirin therapy who may
develop Reye's syndrome following
influenza, people with pulmonary
anel cardiovascular disorders, preg
nant women and people w ho work
or volunteer with any of the target
groups.
Due to the timing of the U.S. flu
season, the optimal time to receive
the vaccine is October through mid-
November. This gives the body
time to make antibodies that will
last through the worst part of flu
season.
Administering vaccines too early
can result in a weaker defense sys
tem in the crucial months.
A more recent addition to the
vaccine routine is the meningitis
vaccine. Outbreaks of meningitis —
a disease of the brain and spinal
cord — among college students
have raised concerns about the
need for prevention.
Meningococcal meningitis is
spread by sneezing. coughing and
contact with infected persons.
Symptoms include fever, still neck,
headache and lethargy.
I lie American College Health
Association is recommending that
all students be vaccinated, while the
CDC has not made such a recom
mendation.
"All of us who work in college
health live with (lie fear of a phone
call reporting meningococcal
meningitis or the death of a student
who was well just a few hours
before." said Mar jean Collins,
director of student health at the
I Jniversitv of Pennsylvania.
While many elderly people
recall early flu vaccines th.it caused
severe symptoms, modern ones
should not produce much notice
able effect beyond soreness around
the injection site.
In the rare event of an allergic
reaction to a vaccine, doctors are
required by law to report the inci
dent.
Students can visit the Cowcll
Immunization Clinic on a drop-in
basis during the week. The clinic
offers flu. MMR (measles, mumps,
rubella), diphtheria, hepatitis A and
B. tetanus and chicken pox immu
nization.
