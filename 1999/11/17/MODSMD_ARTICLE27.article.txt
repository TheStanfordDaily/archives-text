■ Saturday: Stanford 15. Sacramento

Having been bitterly defeated last
year at the hands of its Division II
rival, the Cardinal came into the
game hungry for revenge.
It turned out to be the Hornets,
however, who came out swinging.
After an early Stanford penalty,
Sacramento State scored on a drop
kick to take a 3-0 lead.
The score proved to be a wakeup
call for the ( ardinal. as the rest of the
first half belonged to Stanford. Sea
mus Smythe, a graduate student in
statistics, scored a try to put the ( ar
dinal in front by two, and senior Jack
son Wagener soon followed up with a
drop kick that extended the lead IoK

3.
Willi the lirst hall winding down,
Smythe scored his second try of the
day and Wagener made the conver
sion to give Stanford a seemingly
comfortable 12-point cushion.
In the second hall, though, the
confidence of the Sacramento State
players increased by the minute as the
Cardinal struggled with its ball con
trol and the I lornets kept pushing to
ward the goal.
By the time Sacramento State
scored its first try of the game midway
through the half, it was clear the mo
mentum had shifted. That score low
ered the team's deficit to 15-N.
The next few minutes were heart
wrenching, as time and again Sacra
mento looked to be about to score,
only to be turned away at the last sec
ond by (Cardinal defenders. After the
I lornets finally did make a try and a
conversion to even the score at 15
apiece, the tide changed once again.
Stanford responded to the I lor
nets' energy with a push of its own.
With just a few minutes left, the ( ar
dinal came within inches of scoring,
only to be turned awav. The team

then dug in lo survive one last Hor
nets charge in the final minute and
preserved the tie.
As is often the case, the tie pro
duced ambiguous reactions from the
players.
"I'm disappointed in the tie," said
senior captain Mike Ceballos. "hut
I 'm pleased with the way we played."
The players were pleased at the
opportunity they h;id to assess their
strengths and weaknesses. Chief
among these weaknesses was ball
control. Throughout the game the
Cardinal had numerous costly
turnovers.
But while Stanford turned the ball
over far more frequently than the
I lornets. much of the difference can
be attributed to the teams' opposing
styles.
Sacramento State preferred to
grind its yardage out. giving it to one
of their big guys who would push for
ward as far as he could before being
taken down.
I he Cardinal, on the other hand,
employed a far more dynamic brand
of rugby. It passed the ball frequent
ly. moving side-to-side across the

field in an effort to find holes in the
opposition's defense.
Since Stanford was passing far
more than the IJ or nets, it had more
opportunities for errors.
In coach Franck Boivert's mind,
however, the ball-control problems,
as well as the game's frequent mo
mentum shifts, could be attributed to
fatigue.
"There was certainly a lack of fit
ness," said Boivert. and this led to
what he described as "numerous
lapses of concentration."
Still, the team is happy with where
it is at the moment. The Cardinal's
playing style requires a great deal
more skill than that of Sacramento
State and most other college rugby
squads.
Also on Saturday, the finals of the
10-on-10 rookie tournament for the
Stanford women's rugby team ended
in a tic between the Cardinal A team
and a team from Santa ( lara.
Alter falling behind 10-0 on two
Santa Clara tries in the first half, the
Stanford team, composed mainly of
first year players, lought back to even
the score before time ran out.
