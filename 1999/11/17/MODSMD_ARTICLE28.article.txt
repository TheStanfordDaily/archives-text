German can be a confusing lan
guage, but fortunately Stanford's
Overseas Studies Program recently
announced a new German language
immersion program. Called "The
New Europe," the program will
begin next year and will allow stu
dents to study for two quarters in
Berlin and fulfill their foreign lan
guage requirement.
"The program will appeal to inter
national relations, economics and po
litical science students," said Pam
McNaughton, assistant director of
the OSP. "It combines German lan
guage with economics and political
science classes."
Students will complete first- and

second-quarter German in the fall
quarter and take third-quarter Ger
man in the winter quarter. Students
will have the choice of four courses
with an international relations theme
that are part of the New Europe pro
gram. in addition to regular course
work.
"All of the New Europe classes
will be taught in English," Mc-
Naughton said. She also added that
plans are being made to arrange spe
cial field trips to nearby sites of inter
est. She also plans to encourage stu
dents to seek out internship opportu
nities while in Berlin, perhaps work
ing for the (ierman government.
I he New Europe program began
last year after OSP director and Ger
man Studies chair Russell Merman
had a conversation with Internation

al Relations Department Chair Judy
Goldstein about starting a language
immersion program in Berlin.
"Berlin is a pivot point for a lot of
the issues that emerge from the inte
gration of Eastern and Western Eu
rope," MeNaughton said. " This pro
gram may help students who want to
work for the European Union."
This is the second language-inten
sive program Stanford offers. The
University's program in Moscow pro
vides students with three weeks of in
tensive Russian while they live with
Russian families.
Afterward, students move into
dorms and take regular classes for the
rest of the quarter
The application process for the
New Europe program is the same as
the regular Overseas Studies process.
