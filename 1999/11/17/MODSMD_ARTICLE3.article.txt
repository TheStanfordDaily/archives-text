### Melinda Munos 
Women executives from the high-tech industries dis
cussed the opportunities for women in both technical
and non-technical majors in the computer and Internet
industries yesterday as part of a program jointly held by
the Women's Center and the Inter-sorority Council.
Panel members said small high-tech firms are espe
cially interesting for students seeking jobs because they
provide flexible, exciting and performance-based work
places.
According to senior Wallace Adelman, one of the
event organi/ers, the purpose of the panel was to "find
out what high-tech industry really is and what opportu
nities are available for non-technical people."
I he six speakers, which included three Stanford
alumni and one senior, focused on the differences be
tween jobs in the high-tech industry and jobs in other
sectors, such as finance or fashion.
"My experience as a woman has been much more
friendly in small, tech companies than in large finance
companies," said Rebecca Jones, an employee of
pcOrder.com.
Other participants echoed this feeling, citing a high
er level of responsibility and more flexible corporate
structure as attractive features of small, high-tech start
ups.
"The experience was sort of flat," said Danielle Rios,
Class of IW3. of her experience of working for IBM. "It
was a fair, non-discriminatory environment. But I felt

like advancement was based not on
performance or capability, but
tenure."
Rios. who now works at Trilogy
Software as a director of college re
cruiting, contrasted her experience
at IBM with her positive experi
ence at the smaller Trilogy, calling
the company a "meritocracy" and
"a much more enthusiastic envi
ronment."
Although Rios graduated with a
degree in computer science, many
of the other panelists majored in
non-technical fields. Kelly Ritten
house. who graduated with a major
in communication, initially wanted
to work in the fashion industry.
According to Rittenhouse, her
job search convinced her that there
were very few opportunities for
young people in fashion. She said
that a network of women friends
who had jobs in the high-tech in

dustry interested her in working for
a software company such as Trilo
gy, despite her lack of technical ex
perience.
Several other panelists with
non-technical degrees said they
had taken a similar route to techni
cal corporations.
" This is a unique time in tech
fields," Rios said. "Even if you're
not technical, there are nontechni
cal positions there. As long as you
feel comfortable talking about
computers and technology, you'll
be successful."
Theresa Isaacs, Class of 1978,
emphasized this point, adding that
last year there were 200.(X)() jobs in
Silicon Valley that could not be
filled.
Audience member Vessela
Stoyanova, a sophomore, said she
found this portion of the presenta
tion particularly interesting.
"I didn't really know that there
were as many opportunities for
non-technical people," Stoyanova
said. "It was eye-opening for me

because 1 am an international rela
tions major."
The panel spoke to a small
group of about half a dozen stu
dents. This intimate setting al
lowed audience members to ask
questions of the panelists through
out the course of the evening.
Several audience members ex
pressed concerns about the posi
tions of women in technical compa
nies. Panel members reassured stu
dents that being a woman in a tech
nical industry was not a liability.
"From what 1 can tell, it [being a
woman and having children] has
not hurt their trajectory," Rios
said.
Isaacs also mentioned the grow
ing availability of options available
to women with families, such as
job-sharing, telecommuting and
flextime, not only in high-tech
companies but also in many other
corporations.
Isaacs said that for women con
cerned about their treatment with
in a corporation, the most impor

tant thing is to consider what kind
of environment they want to work
in and to ask questions of women
employed by that corporation.
The discussion, which was held
in the center, was preceded by a
dinner during which students had
the opportunity to chat with pan
elists about their concerns. The
panel was organized by seniors
Adelman, Stephanie Blossom and
Lindsay Levine.
Blossom, who is also the presi
dent of the Inter-Sorority Council,
said she was very pleased with the
format and outcome of the event.
"I am so excited about the fact
that women got the opportunity to
come and ask personal questions in
an intimate situation," Blossom
said.
Adelman, who is the program
director at the center, said she was
also very happy with the discussion
and said the center is already plan
ning another career-related panel
event in conjunction with the Ca
reer Development Center.
