Torrcgian, poet and author of such
collections as "The Wounded Mat
tress." addressed a small group
yesterday afternoon in the Stan
lord Bookstore.
Torrcgian, who said he is "lost
in this world." began with three
poems from his latest collection,
"Always for the 112 irst Time." He
then read live of his newest works,
some written only hours before his
presentation.
The poems he read included
"I'm Sailing on the Sole of Your
Foot" and "A (Jolf Tournament in
Paris." His poems focus on nature.

love and race and reflect his views
of history.
"I was raised in a culture where
history was in our bones. History is
a living reality," Torrcgian said.
"History was invented by poets."
Torrcgian is a self-proclaimed
surrealist. He said he "grew up in
the realm of myth." but feels he has
been "indoctrinated into the
world."
As a surrealist. Torrcgian said
he is informed by the absurd, but
that he "can't tell you anything
about |it|, but I could write a poem
about it."
Torrcgian is also working with
poem-objects, which get their
meaning from the arrangement of
the words. He shared one of his
conceptual poems, written in Russ

ian. on the subject of the Mir space
station. He said he enjoys this
graphical work that can only be ap
preciated when seen, not heard.
He said he feels his role as a
poet is to "make people under
stand that we are here. ... Tthat
we are victims of circumstance."

ious position in this world," and are
in a position to begin the "long trek
of humankind toward civilization."
Joseph Campbell and his belief
that "it is possible for a person to
find [their] bliss" and "connect to
the world in the way of giving" has
influenced Torregian's life.
Torrcgian said he has also been
influenced by other poets, espe
