# Computer Security Month encourages password use
## 
### T.J. Babbitt Editorial staff 
Stanford computer users need to
do a better job of protecting the pass
words they use to access their ac
counts, and they have a few new tools
this year to do it. That's the main
message of November's Computer
Security Month, sponsored by Infor
mation Technology Systems and Ser
vices.
"Our biggest message is that we
have this great network, but we have
to protect it like we protect our keys
or credit cards — anything that tells
people who we are," said Carol
Farnsworth, the product delivery
and documentation manager for
ITSS.
This year, a major goal of the cam
paign is getting users with Leland ac
counts to log on using only "Ker
beros authentication" and stop using
unsecured telnet connections. Telnet
sessions that don't use password pro
tection software such as PC-Iceland
or Macl .eland are much more vul
nerable to being compromised. C '!)-
ROMs with the software have been
widely distributed on campus and
given to resident computer coordina
tors.
The biggest new security feature
this year is a modified version of the
Linux operating system, which Stan
ford provides to ensure secure inter
action with its systems.
"We're really trying to encourage
Stanford users who are using Linux

to use this version," said Farnsworth,
who said that Linux use is on the rise
at Stanford.
Password-protection software
has been installed on most campus
computers, which means that users
have to go out of their way not to use
it on University computers. That
leaves computers connected to the
network through in-room connec
tions and people dialing in from off
campus as major groups that don't
consistently use the software.
Farnsworth explained that hack
ers who manage to install "sniffers"
can easily read unencrypted pass
words that are typed in on the net
work by taking text logs of users' ses
sions.
"One of our goals for the year
2(XX) is no [unencrypted | passwc>rds,"
Farnsworth said. She added that a
larger number of people have been
using the protection software be
cause new members of the Stanford
community are now introduced to
the programs right away.
Farnsworth also had an answer
lor the perennial question of how
often people need to change their
passwords: "We encourage people to
change their passwords at least every
quarter," she said.

curity options on Stanford networks

has also produced a new pamphlet
called "Secure Computing at Stan
ford I Jniversity."
