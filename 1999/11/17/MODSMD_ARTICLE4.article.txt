# Workers optimistic after rally, negotiations
## 
### Mariam Ali Contributing writer 
Leaders of United Stanford
Workers and a management team
from Housing and Dining Services
met yesterday to discuss union alle
gations of abuse of workers by man
agement.
The meeting comes on the heels
of Monday's union-organized rally
in White Pla/a, which closed with al
most 2(H) workers demonstrating for
"respect" and "justice" at 655 Serra
St.. where the University's offices of
Labor Relations are located.
The union organized the rally as a
memorial to Daniel Arroyo, a Din
ing Services worker who died on
Oct. 5 and whom the union alleges
was denied sick leave.
According to union members, six
demands were presented to Stan
ford management by the union at
the meeting, and one was accepted.
"They agreed to adopt a policy
which allows employees who are ill
to go home on leave without undue
harassment or threats," said Julia
Schuelke, director of education and
special districts for United Stanford
Workers. "Managers agreed that
they will no longer call sick workers
at home questioning them about
their illness."
Keith Smith, the Stanford man
ager of labor / employee relations,
was unavailable for comment, as
was Lida Horna, assistant director of
Dining Services, who was named by
the union as the manager who de
nied Arroyo sick leave. Both, ac
cording to Schuelke, attended the
meeting.
In a letter to Dining Service
workers issued last weekend,
Shirley Everett, director of Dining

Services, said it was against manage
ment's policy to tell workers that
they would be fired if they took sick
leave.
"It is not our policy to call or
threaten workers into coming in to
work." Horna said in a Friday inter
view with The Daily. "1 don't want
to say that no one is ever called at
home, but I am confident our man
agers would never threaten any
one."
The union also said management
has promised to work on providing
workers with updated monthly
statements of accrued sick leave and
paid time off.
"In a week, management will
provide workers with an updated
balance of sick leave, but they also
said they are still figuring out how to
get the balance statements out
monthly," said Schuelke.
The specific case of Arroyo was
not discussed in yesterday's meet
ing. Schuelke said the union re
ferred Arroyo's family to a worker
compensation law firm, which will
investigate the feasibility of legal ac
tion against Dining Services.
"With regard to Daniel, the
union will do three things,"
Schuelke said. "We will collect and
give contributions for Daniel to his
family, we will make sure that they
receive Stanford benefits due to
them, and we will provide all possi
ble assistance to the workers' com
pensation law firm's investigation."
According to Smith in a Monday
interview with The Daily, no evi
dence has been presented to him
that proves Horna denied Arroyo
sick leave. Smith is overseeing the
investigation into the union's allega
tions.
When asked whether he had spo
ken to Arroyo's coworkers. Smith
pointed out that according to his
contract with the union, he cannot
solicit workers' input. He can only
speak to workers brought forward
by the union. The union has not for
mally presented any witnesses that
testify to Horna's alleged denial ol
Arroyo's sick leave.
"A lot of workers are very intim
idated right now." Schuelke said.
"They arc afraid of retaliation by
management. We are not going to
force anybody. We do not want to

do anything to cause the workers
further anxiety."
Union leaders said there was a
low representation ol workers from
Elorenee Moore Dining 11 all. where
Arroyo worked, at the rally.
Schuelke said Elo Mo employees
may have felt intimidated and thus
didn't attend.
I'riscilla Raymond, supervisor of
Elo Mo Dining Hall, was unavail
able for comment.
Schuelke said that during yester
day's meeting, the union told man
agement that the Wilbur Dining
Hall manager took down names of
workers not at the rally.
"I think that top managers recog
nize that there are very real prob
lems we just don't know if they

arc committed to putting in the time
and effort needed for real solu
tions," Schuelke said.
"We have mechanisms in place
for the union to raise issues," Smith
said in a Monday interview with The
Daily. "We do the best we can."
Another meeting date has been
set between the union and manage
ment on Nov. 23. The remaining
four union demands, including in
creased staffing levels and convert
ing temporary employees into regu
lar employees with Stanford bene
fits, will be discussed.
"(Yesterday's) meeting was
somewhat productive," said Bobbie
I lodges-Betts. work side organizer of
the United Stanford Workers. "It is
just that progress is slow. Very slow."
