## Castro hosts summit in Havana 
### 
HAVANA (AP) —Cuban Pres
ident Fidel Castro traded military
drabs for an elegant black suit, fill
ing the role of elder statesman
Tuesday at a summit of European
and Latin American leaders,
despite some participants' calls for
greater democracy in Cuba.
Even with the rare public airing
of human rights concerns, Castro
proclaimed that the Ibero-American
summit showed his communist gov
ernment has taken its rightful place
in the region — despite longtime
efforts bv the United States and its
Latin American allies to isolate it.
Opening the gathering of Spain.
Portugal and Lat'n American
nations — which was convened to
focus on economic issues — Castro
said Cuba's status had changed
since the first summit in Guadala
jara, Mexico, in IWI shortly after
the collapse of the Soviet bloc.
"I was a strange bird there, an
intruder whose admission to that
hall had the taste of forgiveness,"
the Cuban leader said Tuesday.
"Cuba had always been left out of
every meeting in this continent.
Some looked at me with curiosity
and even pitv."
"Possibly, hardly anyone
believed that Cuba could withstand
the collapse of the socialist camp."
he added.
Now, "we do not need to be
summoned or receive anyone's per

mission to meet like a family with
out exclusions." Castro said, refer
ring to all the nations present.
If the Ibero-American nations
are family, it was as concerned rela
tives that some of the leaders made
clear their stances on human rights
and democracy.
"For me, Cuba is as to Spain as
Spain is to Cuba," Spanish Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar said.
"For that reason in the future I
would like to see a prosperous and
democratic Cuba."
Portuguese President Jorge Sam
paio switched from his native lan
guage to Spanish to deliver a mes
sage apparently directed at Cuba
and its people: " The fundamental
rights of no citi/en should be seen as
affected because of a dogmatic
vision of society, the state or the
economy."
Opponents of Castro's govern
ment complain that the communist
government regularly violates their
basic rights by limiting freedom of
expression and assembly.
Leading dissidents met this week
with the heads of visiting delega
tions, including Sampaio and the
prime ministers of Spain and Portu
gal. to share their version of Cuba's
human rights situation.
Castro had earlier said he would
not stop his guests from meeting
with the opposition, but clearly has
not been pleased with dissidents'

attempts to use the summit to give
human rights concerns an interna
tional stage.
Last week the Cuban leader
promised that anyone who tried to
disrupt the summit would be arrest
ed and tried.
The issue also intruded on a state
dinner thrown by Castro for the
leaders Monday night. King Juan
Carlos of Spain toasted the Cuban
leader, adding, "Only with an
authentic democracy, with full guar
antee for liberties and with scrupu
lous respect for human rights by all
of us can our peoples face the chal
lenges of the 21st century with suc
cess."
The visit by the king, accompa
nied by Oueen Sofia, was the first
ever to Cuba by a reigning
monarch. Castro hopes eventually
for an official visit by Juan Carlos,
but A/nar said that for the moment
Cuba "does not have the necessary
conditions." A trip planned last
spring was put off. diplomats said,
over human lights concerns, partic
ularly the jailing of four prominent
dissidents.
The draft of the final document
being considered by the leaders also
mentioned human rights and
democracy — underlining the "firm
commitment of each government to
strengthen and make work the func
tioning of democratic institutions,
political pluralism, rule of law. and

respect for human rights and funda
mental liberties, including the right
to development."
Still for Castro, the status grant
ed Cuba by holding the summit
here despite U.S. attempts to turn
Cuba into an international outcast
seems to outweigh the publicity
over human rights.
Five heads of state were absent
from the summit attended by 14
Latin American leaders. The presi
dents of Nicaragua, Costa Rica and
El Salvador refused to attend
because of Cuba's human rights
record or a lack of diplomatic rela
tions.
Presidents Eduardo Frei of Chile
and Carlos Menem of Argentina
boycotted to protest Spain's
attempt to extradite former Chilean
Gen. Augusto Pinochet from
Britain for alleged human rights
abuses.
The draft declaration reached by
the foreign ministers Monday
called the Declaration of I lavana —
outlines the countries' worries
about international financial crises
that can affect their individual
economies.
The draft document also con
demns laws such as the I felms-Bur
ton Act. designed to discourage for
eign investment in Cuba by punish
ing foreign companies investing in
property confiscated from Ameri
cans.
