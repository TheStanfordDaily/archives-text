# Federal Reserve raises interest rates by quarter point
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Federal
Reserve pushed borrowing costs higher for
millions of Americans for the third time this
year on Tuesday, boosting a key short- term
interest rate by a quarter-point to 5.5 per
cent.
The central bank said its actions should
"markedly diminish the risk of inflation
going forward." fanning hopes on Wall
Street that there would be no more rate
increases for a while. Investors sent stock
prices soaring on the news.
But private economists warned that the
language in the Fed's announcement clearly
left open the possibility of further increases if
the economy does not slow to a more sus
tainable pace.
"The Fed continues to be on inflation
alert, driven by a .tirong economy and a tight
labor market." said Allen Sinai, chief
economist at Primark Global Economics in
New York. "The door is still open for more
rate hikes, just not before early February."

In a one-page announcement issued after
its closed-door deliberations, the central
bank said. "Although cost pressures appear
generally contained, risks to sustainable
growth persist."
For that reason, the central bank said it
was boosting its federal funds rate, the inter
est that banks .charge each other on
overnight loans, to 5.5 percent.
That action triggered announcements
from commercial banks that they were
increasing their prime lending rate, the
benchmark for millions of business and con
sumer loans, to <5.5 percent from N.25 per
cent.
The Fed also increased its largely symbol
ic discount rate, the interest it charges to
make direct loans to banks, by a quarter
point to 5 percent.
It marked the third time this year the cen
tral bank has increased the federal funds rate
as it has tried to engineer a soft landing, slow
ing the economy enough to keep inflation

pressures in check while not endangering the
(S 1/2-year economic expansion, already the
longest in peacetime history.
The Fed raised the funds rate to 5 percent
on June 30, the first rate increase in two
years, and boosted it by another quarter
point on Aug. 24.
In its statement, the central bank said it
was moving its policy directive, which is
intended to signal future interest rate moves,
back to neutral. The directive had been
switched to a bias toward raising rates at the
last meeting in October.
Wall Street staged a strong rally on the
optimistic forecast of lower inflation pres
sures and the switch to a neutral bias. The
Dow Jones industrial average finished the
day up 171.58 points at 10,923.33, its highest
close since Sept. 13.
Private economists agreed with Wall
Street that the Fed was sending a strong sig
nal that it is finished raising interest rates for
this year, in part because of the view that the

central hank did not want to boost rates at its
Dec. 21 meeting because of a desire not to he
changing policy so close to the Year 20(H)
computer date change.
But analysts also said the central hank
apparently was still worried that the econo
my was growing too rapidly. The l ed said
the pool of available workers h;is dwindled
as "the expansion of activity continues in
excess of the economy's growth potential."
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan has expressed worries for more
than a year that continued tight labor mar
kets will eventually trigger rising wage
demands, especially if the recent spurt in
productivity falters.
So far. businesses have been able to cover
higher labor costs through increases in pro
ductivity, more output per hour of work.
Merrill Lynch chief economist Bruce
Steinberg said the Fed's next move would
likely be triggered bv watching the unem
ployment rate, which fell in October to a 30-

year-low of 4.1 percent.
" The Fed's greatest worry is that the
I Jnited States is simply running out of warm
bodies." Steinberg said. "For policy to
remain on hold going forward, unemploy
ment can't fall much further."
Economists had been split over whether
there would he a rate increase at Tuesdavjj
meeting. Those arguing that the Fed would
keep rates unchanged pointed to the fact
that there are no signs yet of higher inflation.
( onsumer prices through September are ris
ing at a modest annual rate of 2.8 percent for
the year, even with a big jump in energy
costs.
Noting the low inflation figures,
economists for major business groups
argued that Tuesday's rate increase was
unjustified.
"Inflation is in hibernation and this hike
in rates is simply ill-timed," said Gordon
Richards, chief economist for the National
Association of Manufacturers.
