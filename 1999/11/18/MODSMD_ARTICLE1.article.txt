# Police will not press charges
## Lagunita bonfire breaks regulations 
### Peter Stair Contributing writer 
Last Saturday, more than I SO stu
dents celebrated Stanford's football
victory over Arizona State with a 35-
foot bonfire in the bed of Lake Lagu
nita. While the flames fizzled when
the crowd was broken up by police,
some students' dissatisfaction with
the prohibition of such fires still smol
ders.
Although the University ended
the traditional Lake Lagunita bon
fires in 1992, a spokesman for Stan
ford Police said the department does

not plan to pursue suspects or press
charges for Saturday's fire. A log
made available yesterday indicated
that police officers on the scene did
not seek the names of instigators.
Although the Office of Judicial
Affairs can still take disciplinary ac
tion. Dean of Students Marc Wais
said, "I don't want tocreate the sense
that we're conducting a witch-hunt."
According to several students,
this year's fire did not appear to be
spontaneous. Crates had been
stacked up on the dry lake bottom

Police have de
cided not to file
charges for the
illegal bonfire
that occurred
Saturday night
at Lake Laguni
ta. Bonfires at
the lake are
banned due to
concerns about
the tiger sala
mander, which
is an endan
gered species
that makes the
lake its habitat.
