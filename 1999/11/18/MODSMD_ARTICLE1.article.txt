# Police will not press charges
## Lagunita bonfire breaks regulations 
### Peter Stair Contributing writer 
Last Saturday, more than I SO stu
dents celebrated Stanford's football
victory over Arizona State with a 35-
foot bonfire in the bed of Lake Lagu
nita. While the flames fizzled when
the crowd was broken up by police,
some students' dissatisfaction with
the prohibition of such fires still smol
ders.
Although the University ended
the traditional Lake Lagunita bon
fires in 1992, a spokesman for Stan
ford Police said the department does

not plan to pursue suspects or press
charges for Saturday's fire. A log
made available yesterday indicated
that police officers on the scene did
not seek the names of instigators.
Although the Office of Judicial
Affairs can still take disciplinary ac
tion. Dean of Students Marc Wais
said, "I don't want tocreate the sense
that we're conducting a witch-hunt."
According to several students,
this year's fire did not appear to be
spontaneous. Crates had been
stacked up on the dry lake bottom


Miler Lee Daily
Police have de
cided not to file
charges for the
illegal bonfire
that occurred
Saturday night
at Lake Laguni
ta. Bonfires at
the lake are
banned due to
concerns about
the tiger sala
mander, which
is an endan
gered species
that makes the
lake its habitat.
before the lire, and an e-mail to the
resident assistants' list announcing a
football rally said "rumor has it stull
will be burning at Lake Lag after."
"On one level, it demonstrates
great school spirit." Wais said. "Hut
the I Jniversity haseliminated this site
for bonfires due to environmental
concerns."
Although an artificial lake, I.agu
nita is a habitat for the tiger salaman
der, an endangered species. A bon
fire and its accompanying crowd
would destroy the salamander breed
ing grounds.
Sophomore Axe Committee

member I i/ Aab questioned the en
vironmental concerns. "I believe that
... the lire, while it damages the pop
ulation. does not threaten tiger sala
mander extinction.".
Furthermore, she added, "it the
campus were truly interested in pro
tecting the environment, [administra
tors! would curb some ol their
habits." referring to pollution caused
by goll course fertilizers.
According to a joint announce
ment of the Axe Comm. the ASSIJ
President and the Dean ol Students
in September IW7, "Lake Lag is the
last known rcmainingC'alifornia tiger
salamander breeding site on the
Peninsula.... Stanford and biologists
involved in the study recommended
against the bonfire in Lagunita be

cause it posed a significant threat to
the species."
Since then, administrators and
leaders from Axe ("omm have strug
gled to find an alternative location
satisfactory to students. Three years
ago a smaller, official bonfire was
held on Wilhur Field. For the last two
years, the official fire has burned at
Arrillaga Plaza.
Arrillaga will be the location again
1 his year, but many students are dis
pleased with this alternative: 19W
marks the second-straight year stu
dents have held illegal bonfires in the
Lake.
Junior Peter Douglas, one of the
approximately I NO people at the bon
fire Saturday, said the traditional
bonfires were far larger and more

popular.
"From what I understand, this fire
was only one one-hundredth of the
old ones [At the fires beforej.
pizza and burgers were brought in by
the truckload. It was really great to
raise school spirit." he said.
"[The Arrillaga bonfire is| still a
great time." said sophomore James
( ook. "but it would be more exciting
to have a fire at Lake Lag."
Wais said the University does not
plan to reconsider the Lake Lagunila
question.
I lowever. students say they are
discontent with the current policy. "I
have seen amazing bonfires at other
schools.... which rally people like
nothing else," Aab said. "I wish so
much that we could have that again."
