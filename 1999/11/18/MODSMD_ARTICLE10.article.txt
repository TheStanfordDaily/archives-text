# Airlines join Priceline
## 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) — United,
American and US Airways have
gotten on board with Priceline.com,
the name-your-own-price Internet
ticket service.
That means that nearly all major
U.S. airlines now sell seats through
Priceline. The move also doubles the
number of seats Priceline can sell.
The agreement announced
Wednesday gives travelers more
reason to buy tickets online and pro
vides airlines with a proven way to
peddle unsold seats at the last
minute.
It also deals another blow to trav
el agents, who are seeing their airline
commissions cut and getting still
competition from travel Web sites.
Most airlines now sell tickets on
their own sites, and last week Unit
ed, Delta, Continental and Noi ill
west announced plans fora joint site.
Priceline's three new airlines
Nos. 1. 2 and 6 in the country —join
Delta, Continental, Northwest.
TWA and America West on Price
line. Among major airlines. South
west is still not participating.
At Priceline.com, buyers can
choose their own price for hotel
rooms, cars, home mortgages, equity
loans, even groceries. The deal is
sealed when the seller accepts the
buyer's bid.
Priceline's new partners had pre
viously been reluctant to sell tickets

there, particularly American, which
was afraid to compete with Trave
iocity.com. the travel Web site con
trolled by American's parent,
AMR Corp. All three airlines also
sell tickets at their own Web sites.
Hut results apparently persuad
ed the three airlines. Priceline said
its weekly sales of airline tickets
have increased to more than 50,(XX)
a week, up I.(KK) percent from Jan
uary.
That's still a tiny fraction, how
ever, of the roughly 10 million tick
ets sold in the United States each
week.
Priceline's stock has been lan
guishing lately as some industry
analysts have questioned whether
airlines were enthusiastic about
doing business with the company.
An American Airlines
spokesman said the partnership is
an acknowledgment that Priceline
"is growing up."
"It comes down to the fact that
Priceline has shown itself to be a
viable distribution channel that
makes sense as one of many distri
bution channels at this point,"
American spokesman Tim Smith
said.
On Wall Street on Wednesday,
stock in the Stamford, Conn.-based
Priceline soared $S. 12 1/2 to close
12 percent higher at $76.87 1/2 a
share on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
