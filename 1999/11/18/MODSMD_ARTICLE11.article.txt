According to Pakistan television.
$13X million had been recovered
when the deadline expired just }
percent of the estimated $4 billion
outstanding.
Soldiers in green army jeeps
roared up to the palatial home of

a bloodless coup.
There were conflicting reports on

due in court to be formally charged.
II convicted of either charge, he
would face the death penalty or life
in prison.
The charges stems from an inci
dent m which an aircraft returning
Musharraf to Pakistan was refused

Oct. 12. The army seized control of
the country, allowed the plane to
land, and took Sharif into custody.

lier was found guilty ol corruption
and sentenced to five years in jail.
But she refused to return to Pak
istan. saying the trial had been unfair
and she was innocent. She has
appealed her conviction.
The television report also said
Bhutto's jailed husband. Asif Alt
Zardari. faces new charges.
Wednesday "s arrests followed the
enactment of a law. promulgated by

politicians from holding office for 21
years if they were found guilty of
corruption or of defaulting on loans.
Ihe law makes corruption a
crime punishable by up to 14 years in
