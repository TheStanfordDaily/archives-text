Talks between management and
workers an encouraging step
toward improved communication

It is encouraging to sec Stan
ford University management
meeting with the Stanford
Workers Union in order to clarify
any perceived inequities in man
agement's treatment of employ
ees.
It is important to note that no
wrongdoing on the part of man
agement has been proven, but the
situation faced by workers makes
its very easy for there to appear to
be wrongdoing.
Unfortunately, it was not until
the death of Daniel Arroyo, a
worker for Florence Moore Din
ing Hall that union officials claim
was denied sick leave by manage
ment, that this issue has been
pushed strongly by the union.
Hut whether or not the allega
tions are true, the fact that Arroyo
thought his job would be in danger
if he asked for time off should
a massage to management of
how it is viewed by employees.
Managers must understand that
not explicitly intimidating workers
doesn't mean that workers don't
feel uncomfortable. Managers
have a great power, holding in
their hands the very livelihoods of
these workers.
ITiere is only one objective fora
worker: earn that paycheck. They
must feed their families and pay
the rent, and most will do whatev
er it takes to stay in good favor
with managers.
Managers may not recognize
this, and they might take it for

granted that workers are happy
and comfortable in their working
environment. Iliey may see a hard
worker and think that person is a
model employee. In fact, that
employee may be too afraid to
make a mistake for fear of losing
his or her job.
While in an ideal world this
would be a mutual attempt by
both sides to open communica
tion, management must recognize
that it really holds all the power as
far as workers are concerned. The
fact that there is often a language
barrier between workers and
management doesn't make the sit
uation any easier for either side.
The meeting of the two groups
on Tuesday was a positive step in
the right direction. The demands
made by the union are extremely
reasonable, the main one being
that managers do not unduly
harass workers who request sick
leave
The problem can be as simple as
a misunderstanding in communi
cation. A worker who calls in sick
and then is called at home by a
manager — even if the manager is
checking to see if he or she is OK
— will generally feel panicked,
especially if that worker is not flu
ent in English and can not fully
understand the manager.
Dialogues such as the one on
Tuesday will hopefully air out
these issues. The onus should not
fall completely on the managers,
as workers must realize that they
have certain rights and must exer
cise them on occasion. Hopefully,
the lessons about how to deal with
managers learned now will be a
guideline for the future.
