Revel without violence
As we look forward to Big Game, the
Athletic Department reminds us that vio
lence will not be permitted on Saturday.
I assert that violence at Big Game is bull
headed (especially after realizing that we are
outnumbered by a few thousand students).
However, the decision to prevent the
Band from mocking the Bears is a denial of a
right and tradition that only comes to our
home turf every two years.
Is it wrong to poke fun at our rival? Shall
we not cheer when our defense causes a
turnover? Or shall we root for the pitiful
Bears to score against the best defense in the
crunch in the nation?
We can learn to peacefully root for the
Cardinal while despising the not-so-Golden
Bears. I challenge all Stanford students to
come ready to cheer for the Cardinal and
root against the Bears. Just don't start a riot
over a football game.
In addition, when we win the right to keep
the axe and with it our first trip to the Rose
Bowl in over two decades, I suggest that the
peaceful Cardinal fans rush the field and tear
down the goal posts (in a calm and orderly
manner).
I also encourage the Athletics Depart
ment to allow us to do it despite the fact that
the Irish are coming next Saturday. Don't
take away the players' earned right to party
like it's 19W.
Just don't do it with the intent to anger
those poor Bears. Do it because we are the
Best of the Bay and the Pac-10 Champions!
But please, no violence.

Limiting Band halftime
show a mistake
Like many others, I was shocked when I
first heard of the Athletic Department's
decision to not allow the Stanford Band to
poke fun at Cal during the upcoming half
time show. There are traditions, there are
rivalries and then there's the Leland Stan
ford Jr. (pause) University Marching Band.
Years before I joined the LSJUMB, I
adored their attitude. I fere we were, stu
dents at a prestigious and respected universi
ty, known throughout the world for excel
lence in academics, athletics and architecture
and yet far from having another stuffy and
tedious marching band trying to keep its lines
straight as people marched from one boring
geometric shape to another. We had the
Band.
They danced. They played fun music.
They had a reputation for both mischevious
ncss and probably having the most fun out of
anyone on the field. Any band that can per
form a Beanie-Baby-themed show, talk
about a Mussolini Baby and spell "II Duce"
on the field will always be all right in my
book.
And then this happens. Our field show
will still be funny. We'll still dance and play
and have as much fun as we can. but the Ath
letic Department is sabotaging one of many
great Big Game traditions by so greatly lim
iting our options.
Cal is a fine schixil (although 1 wouldn't
want my sister to go there) and is filled with
very talented and intelligent students. Every
year a few of the more thuggish ones, upset
at yet another loss, rush the field looking for
trouble. Whether or not the Stanford Band

points out at halftime that yes, their mascot is
a bit tubby, is not going to change this.
I do not speak for the Band, but I person
ally feel the decision to limit us so was a great
mistake. I hope that in the future this mistake
will not be repeated.

j
Band could better cater
to fans
While sitting in the stands at Big Game
I've seen fist fights between students. While
marching on the field with the Cal Band I've
been pummeled by frozen fruit thrown by
Stanford undergraduates.
Counter to some people's claims, the
Band's performances do not directly incite
these acts. These individual Stanford and Cal
students act on their own volition. As previ
ously expressed here, the Band should be
able to perform their show, focusing on
music, dancing and creative humor (which
can include mocking the visiting team).
However, I believe a larger question
might be warranted. Does the Band fully
serve the needs of a Division 1-A school? In
general, the Band's spirited performances do
a gtxxl job rallying the students at games. But
does the Band always serve the alumni and
Stanford's community supporters?
Many in these groups are very offended
by the occasional graphic sexual reference or
derogatory ethnic comment. Is it possible for
the Band to more fully serve all people of the
University community?
My experience in the band across the Bay

strongly suggests so. ITie Cal Band is the
focus of positive spirit for both students and
alumni. The student-run band performs a
traditional pre-game show for every game in
the energetic high-step style of the Big 10
schools. Halftime shows usually follow a
modern theme, often catered to the students.
(Big Game halftime shows are simpler as the
band's energies are diverted to more than 50
performances for alumni throughout Big
Game week). After every game, part of the
Cal Band performs for many student parties.
Musicality, marching, dancing and humor
are all used to entertain.
In my four years with the Cal Band we
received numerous standing ovations from
students and alumni alike. On multiple occa
sions 1 worked with young musicians in local
schools and performed for community orga
nizations not directly related to the school.
Throughout, band members and students are
energized by these performances, as well by
the parties that follow.
The Stanford Band should not appease
alumni just for money. But I know many
Stanford alumni continue to send checks to
the Cal Band each year to express dissatis
faction with their own band. Surely the entire
University community will be watching if the
football team earns a trip to the Rose Bowl.
If the Stanford Band wants to more fully
serve the entire University community, I
believe they should think twice before inten
tionally crossing the line of poor taste.
