# Meaning in the macro
## Sasha Polonsky An agenda for the coming millennium 
### 
Thanksgiving break
is imminent. Sit
com specials and
turkey dinners are soon to
remind us that the holiday
season is fast-approaching
with promises of Yule tide
gaiety and Y2K disaster.

And if indeed we all are doomed to go
down with the packed punch of the millen
nium, I figure we ought to start writing our
resolutions now.
The following is what I call the Sasha
Millennium Project — my guidelines for
making an improved and confident
entrance into 2(HX).
The project was inspired by a pair of
turquoise jeans 1 bought over the summer
that were too cute but far too tight to fit
over my hips. My project as I saw it before
me would aim toward fitting into and com
fortably wearing the stylish pants by Jan. 1.
1 lowever, sensing with some degree of cer
tainty that this plan was destined to fail, I
decided I ought to revise. Here's what I
came up with.
Above all, as you enter the new century
remember to enjoy yourself. Sometimes we
forget how important this is in the midst of
interviews, theses and even I-Hum papers.
Don't stay in two weekend nights in a row
because you are stressed about work. Face
it. You will never be as productive as you
hope to be. Take time out and have fun as a
break from imperative class assignments.
Be sensitive to feelings, and don't hit
people.
lake risks and force yourself to do things
that make you anxious and uncomfortable.
Often. I hitchhiked — once alone and once
with friends — in foreign territory, once
with a 16-wheeler truck driver who spoke
no English. And I lived. Once I even tried
to make alternative suggestions when the

big man at the post office bossed me
around. I wouldn't recommend trying that.
Ask questions. Our teachers in elemen
tary school may have lied once or twice
when they assured us that "there are no
stupid questions." We know enough now
from CIV section to debunk that alleged
grade-school wisdom, but don't let that stop
you from asking. Don't shy away from seek
ing the information or explanation you
deserve.
Don't berate yourself for making mis
takes. By the same token, don't give your
self undue credit. But keep a running bal
ance of positives and negatives so that you
learn to accept and appreciate your mis
takes as well as your successes. Recognize
your potential and work toward it. but don't
be too hard on yourself for your shortcom
ings. Recognize others for their hard work
and achievements.
Try not to obsess over money. Don't let
concern for cash limit what you want to do.
Travel, and don't panic about the debt it
incurs. Lend five dollars to a friend that you
don't expect to see back. Offer to pay for
gas when you borrow a car. Take a friend
out for dinner instead of spending your pay
check on a new shirt at least once.
Stop and ask for directions.
Be cautious and aware of other people's
behavior, but keep an open mind. Give peo
ple the benefit of the doubt. Don't assume
too much from first impressions, but then
again don't forget about those first impres
sions.
Speak what's on your mind and defend
your beliefs. Don't cave to other people's
arguments too easily. Support your claims
and argue effectively. Don't try to BS your
way through a fight. Especially with a
boyfriend or girlfriend.
Be a fighter, but choose your battles.
Take responsibility. Don't pass the buck.

Nobody likes the person who leaves all the
gruntwork behind and takes credit for the
event. Move chairs and couches fora dorm
program once or twice. Wake up early to
clean up after a party. People will appreci
ate it and acknowledge you.
Visit and check in with friends as often as
you can.
Realize that different friends have differ
ent functions and purposes in your life.
Know what you can expect from people,
and ask for help when you need it.
Keep in touch.
Write thank-you notes.
Force yourself not to put things off. As
my high school swim coach used to say.
"today is yesterday's tomorrow. Do it now."
We all know it's tempting to leave papers
until 2 a.m. the night before the deadline.
I'm not going to suggest changing this
method if it works for you. But maybe try to
at least think of a topic in advance.
Exercise whenever possible. Dance
when you laluar music, eveji in prtplic.
Laugfi \intil your fctomhch' IntVis. Don't
hesitate to cry. Tell jokes, but know when
something is not funny enough to repeat.
Gossip when you need to vent, but be judi
cious about what you pass around.
Be a good host.
Tell people how special they are and
how much you care about them. Don't
assume that they know. Do the same for
yourself.
Finally, remind yourself every day that
there is a greater world outside the narrow
path of your life. Challenge yourself in
whatever way you can to find it.

heading baek East for Thanksgiving break.
