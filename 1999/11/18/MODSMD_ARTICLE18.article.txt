# Reality in small doses
## Mariam Ali Single students are going to stay single 
### 
I grew up in Kuwait, and I was convinced
that nothing could beat Kuwait fora
lame dating scene. After all, this was
the country in which people initiated con
versations by throwing cellular phones
through open car windows and then calling
the cell phone. This was the country in
which the police punished men for hitting
on women by shaving their heads.
I was wrong, however. Stanford Univer
sity wins the gold medal fora catastrophic
dating scene.
I realized this two weeks ago when I
attended the first meeting of a quasi-psy
chotic sorority that a bunch of junior girls in
my dorm created. Calling themselves the
"Deltas" for "Desperate," 15 girls met in a
small Stern dorm room to discuss the trau
ma of being a date-less junior.
The meeting opened with introductions

modeled on Alcoholic Anonymous ses
sions. "Hi, my name is Tina. And 1 am sin
gle," Tina said to applause and a "Welcome
Tina" from the group.
The Deltas then shared traumatic dating
experiences (or lack thereof) and received
commiserating comments from the other
girls. The meeting closed with everyone
holding hands and singing a touching rendi
tion of, "Lean on Me."
It was scary. It was fun. It was a little sad.
The meeting of the Deltas made me
realize what ridiculous lengths Stanford
students will go to to procure themselves
dates. Think about "Screw your Room
mate" or "Screw your Sib" dances.
The entire premise of a "Screw your
Roommate" is to set up people on blind
dates. And it works because most people
are single.

Of course, the chance of actually meet
ing your soulmate at an SYR is virtually nil.
I know, for example, that my freshman
SYR date asked me what my SAT scores
were over dinner. The possibilities for
romance definitely flew out the window
when he snuck out of the dance without
saying goodbye.
In a non-blind-date context, romantic
contact at Stanford seems to fall into two
definitive camps. The first is the "We met
the first week of freshman orientation and
now we are getting married" couples. The
second is the infamous "sketchy hookup"
at a fraternity party.
Most people, however, are looking nei
ther for an engagement ring nor fora
drunken affair. What happened to dinner
and a movie?
It is as if everyone is terrified of dating.

When someone does actually have the
nerve to ask someone else out. it usually
goes something like this: "Umm, yeah, like
you should totally come over or something.
Yeah, like umm dinner or something.
Yeah, umm like e-mail me. Yeah."
My theory is that as a result we have a
campus filled with lonely, frustrated peo
ple running around. It really is no coinci
dence that watching Ally Mcßeal on a
Monday night is a religious ritual for many
people.
1 know that last year my friends would
throw Dawson Creek parties. It is a tragic
commentary on our lives that we had noth
ing better to do on a Wednesday night than
watch a cheesy TV show about 16-year
olds falling in love.
The sad thing is that nothing is ever
going to change. We will all continue to be

date-free as we rush through our college
lives juggling 10 activities and five classes a
quarter. Let's face it, between CS assign
ments, papers and catching up with friends,
most people simply do not have time for
relationships.
So if you are the typical single Stanford
student who spends long hours bemoaning
your lack of a date on a Saturday night or
who watches romantic comedies with your
econ problem set for company — I suggest
that you give up hope now.
There really is more dating in a
monastery.
