## Big Swim: Card hosts Bears Top-ranked Stanford squad takes on No.6 Cal at deGuerre 
### Kellie Wiginton Contributing writer 
Encounters between Stanford
and Pacific 10 Conference rival Cali
fornia athletic teams can be found all
over campus this week. The No. 1
Stanford men's swim team hosts the
No. 6 Bears today in a double-dis
tance exhibition dual meet.
The double-distance meet will be
formatted differently than other
dual meets in that the traditional
events will not necessarily be raced.
As the name indicates, the distance
of every event will be doubled.
Thus, the I.(HK)-meter freestyle
becomes the 2.(HK) freestyle; the 4(X)

relays become <S(X) relays, and so on.
This type of competition and prac
tice gives the teams an opportunity
to "over-train," which in turn will
strengthen the times of their usual
events.

"Doing double the amount
makes us really concentrate on
keeping intense," junior Adam
Messner said." It also changes up our
practices and takes away some of the
monotony of regular training."
Though the meet will not count

toward conference or NCAA stand
ings. the Cardinal still expects to
emerge victorious.
"Having the opportunity to race
is always important." Messner said.
"We will definitely have confidence
going into this meet, and anything
less than a win will be unacceptable."
Although the Cardinal is ready
for competition, the preparation for
this meet has been somewhat fatigu
ing for the team.
"We feel pretty good going into
the Cal meet." said freshman sensa
tion Randall Bal. "We're a little bro
ken down from weights and practice

this week, but it's not too bad."
The double-distance meet will
provide testing grounds for both Cal
and Stanford with regard to distance
events. Stanford has proven distance
swimmers in Messner, junior Steven
Brown, and sophomore Reid
Gustin. However, much of the Car
dinal's recent success, as well as the
Bears,' have stemmed from wins in
shorter sprint races.
Stanford has shown exceptional
sprint performances in recent meets,
particularly by Bal, who has been
consistently dominating the 50
freestyle. Messner and junior Rob
Canales have also had tremendous
successes. Messner has shown well in
both the 200 freestyle and 100 but
terfly, while Canales has been con
sistent in both the 100 and 200
breaststroke.
Cal has also been very successful
in recent meets. Last weekend, the

Bears handily defeated Division II
powerhouse Cal State Bakersfield,
which Stanford will face on Friday
along with San Francisco State. Al
though the Bears also lost to No. 3
Texas by a score of 147-136, the team
lost by a much slimmer margin than
did the Cardinal, which lost to Texas
138-105 two weeks ago.
Top Bear swimmers include se
niors Bart Kizierowski in the 200
freestyle and the 200 backstroke,
Ratapong Sirisanont in the 200
breaststroke and Lars Merseburg in
the 100 freestyle. Sophomores An
drew Chan (100 and 200 breast
stroke and 200 individual medley),
Mickey Murad (500 and 1000
freestyle), Jay Lee (200 freestyle and
200 butterfly), and Matt Macedo (50
freestyle) have also had powerful
showings.
Freshman Andrew Ervin of the
Bears has made a huge impact since
his arrival, swimming strong in both
the 50 and the 100 freestyle, and is an
integral part of the 400 free relay
team.
