## Big Swim: Card hosts Bears Top-ranked Stanford squad takes on No.6 Cal at deGuerre 
### Kellie Wiginton Contributing writer 
Encounters between Stanford
and Pacific 10 Conference rival Cali
fornia athletic teams can be found all
over campus this week. The No. 1
Stanford men's swim team hosts the
No. 6 Bears today in a double-dis
tance exhibition dual meet.
The double-distance meet will be
formatted differently than other
dual meets in that the traditional
events will not necessarily be raced.
As the name indicates, the distance
of every event will be doubled.
Thus, the I.(HK)-meter freestyle
becomes the 2.(HK) freestyle; the 4(X)

relays become <S(X) relays, and so on.
This type of competition and prac
tice gives the teams an opportunity
to "over-train," which in turn will
strengthen the times of their usual
events.

"Doing double the amount
makes us really concentrate on
keeping intense," junior Adam
Messner said." It also changes up our
practices and takes away some of the
monotony of regular training."
Though the meet will not count

toward conference or NCAA stand
ings. the Cardinal still expects to
emerge victorious.
"Having the opportunity to race
is always important." Messner said.
"We will definitely have confidence
going into this meet, and anything
less than a win will be unacceptable."
Although the Cardinal is ready
for competition, the preparation for
this meet has been somewhat fatigu
ing for the team.
"We feel pretty good going into
the Cal meet." said freshman sensa
tion Randall Bal. "We're a little bro
ken down from weights and practice

Today, the No. 1 Stanford men s swim team plays host to No. 6 Cal in an especially challenging double
distance meet. The team hopes that the "over-training" effect of swimming double-distance races will
help its overall training.
