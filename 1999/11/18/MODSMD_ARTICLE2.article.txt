# Students protest tobacco giant
## Philip Morris a no-show for interviews 
### Ben Alexander-Bloch Contributing writer 
Stanford students and faculty
joined outside the Career Develop
ment Center yesterday to protest to
bacco giant Philip Morris' scheduled
job interviews with seniors.
However, Philip Morris did not
come to interview students as
planned.
"Philip Morris actually cancelled
their interviews today when they
heard there might be a protest. 1 guess
they wanted to avoid the bad publici
ty," said junior Ned To/un. an orga
nizer of the protest.
INF : ACT, a Boston-based grass
roots group that, according to its
pamphlet, "campaigns for corporate
accountability," organized yesterday
morning's protest to inform the Stan
ford community of the company's
marketing policies.
Robert Thirsk, director of the
CDC. said he is unsure why Philip
Morris decided not to interview yes
terday.
Thirsk said the company's cancel
lation could have been due to the
protest or to the fact that only three
students, instead of the usual five or
six, signed up to interview.
The CDC had called Philip Morris
representatives to warn them of the
scheduled protest.
"Philip Morris must stop market
ing cigarettes to minors both here and
abroad." said INFACT fieldorganiz

cr Antha Williams.
Williams said Girl Scouts in Cam
bodia hand out free cigarette sam
plers and claimed that in other coun
tries, children can enter rock concerts
for free if they bring empty cigarette
boxes.
"Ethics and justice need to come
before profits," said Williams. "We
must reverse current trends in tobac
co use worldwide, end the global to
bacco epidemic and protest those
companies more interested in profit
than in human life."
November is visibility month for

the Philip Morris boycott, and last
Tuesday, Stanford students helped
organize a call-in. More than 1(H) peo
ple called Philip Morris to state their
disapproval over the alleged target
ing of children in marketing cam
paigns.
"Ethics get lost in the pursuit of
business," Tozun said. "We must
send a clear message to Philip Morris
that they are not wanted on campus."
Stanford junior Dorcas Cheng
said students can also protest Philip
Morris by boycotting its Kraft foods
brand.

Philip Morris' Marlboro is the
world's top-selling cigarette brand,
and Kraft and other domestic food la
bels make up one-third of Phillip
Morris' $74-billion annual revenues.

it recently helped cause the breakup
of RJ Reynolds Nabisco, a major cor

lowered public interest i*i its stock.

Elaine Coburn, a doctoral student
in sociology, said an internal docu
ment circulated within Philip Morris
stated that nicotine and cocaine have
similar affects on health; she claimed
Philip Morris later denied knowl
edge of this at a press conference.

"Philip Morris breaks its own
rules so often that students would not
be making a smart decision to work
for them," said Coburn.
Thirsk said he believed students
should be able to make their own de
cisions on whether or not to inter
view with the corporation.
"The protest is great... not great
because I have anything for or
against Philip Morris, but because
students are speaking out about is
sues of social importance," Thirsk
said. "That is what education is all
about."
