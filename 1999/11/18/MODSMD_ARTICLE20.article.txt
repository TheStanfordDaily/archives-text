## Crew comes in ninth at Seattle 
### Sarah Heim Contributing writer 
The members of Stanford women's crew will have
their work cut out for them during winter training this
year.
After racing a varsity and J V eight at the 1 lead of
the Lake in Seattle this weekend, the team returned
home acutely aware of the competition it will face in
the Pacific 10 Conference this spring.
The varsity boat finished with a time of IN minutes,
23 seconds, placing sixth among U.S. collegiate teams
and ninth overall in the 14-boat race. Cal won the race
in 16:59 with Washington, Washington State and Ore
gon following in third, fifth and sixth, respectively.

WOMEN'S CREW
■ Saturday-Sunday: Stanford finished ninth of 14 teams
at the Head of the Lake in Seattle.

"1 don't think anyone was truly satisfied with their
performance," said head coach Aimee Baker. "We
ended up in the same spot we were in last year. There
is no reason why we shouldn't be up with Oregon
State and Washington State."
In order to secure a bid to the NCCA Champi
onships in Camden. N.J., this spring, Stanford will
have to place in the top three or four of the Pac-10.
The JV boat finished fifth out of the 10 collegiate
crews that raced with a time of 19:24. Overall, the boat
placed eighth out of 15 teams. Washington won the
race in 17:46.
The JV race was hindered by a three-hour fog
delay. Although the rowers arrived at 6:15 a.m. for the
8 a.m. race, they were not on the water until 11 a.m.
Baker offered no excuses for the team. After all.
the competing teams were all subject to the delay.
However, she did say that the delay "was kind of a
drag" and "certainly didn't help matters for the
team."
"We raced hard," Baker said. But she also conced
ed that the team was a little nervous and didn't quite
settle into their race plans from the start.
"[The rowers] were already anxious as it was." she
said.
Both boats were also anxious about the huge turn
in the middle of the course. The ISO-degree turn re
quired exceptional navigation on the part of the
coxswain.
"The coxswains did a tremendous job on the turn,"
Baker said. " They handled themselves very well and
kept (the rowers] calm."
Although the team didn't have any lofty goals for
the race, they do hope to take what they learned over
weekend and from other races this fall and focus on
improving during winter training.
"We saw the competition and know that we can get
there," she added. "The team recognizes their weak
nesses and that is more than half the battle."
With a young crew — this year's team is mainly
composed of freshman and sophomores — winter
training offers a long break from racing and time to
hone rowing fundamentals and build endurance be
fore beginning the competitive season in the spring.
