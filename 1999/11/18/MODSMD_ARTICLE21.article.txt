# Rust adds polish to Stanford soccer squad
## Junior forward stars for Cardinal team headed to tourney game with Santa Clara 
### Meghan O'Connor Staff writer 
When junior forward Luke Rust net
ted his first career goal to seal an overtime
victory over No. 4 Washington last fall, the
Stanford men's soccer team must have
known that there would only be more
good things to come.
"It was his first shot of the night," said
fellow junior forward Corey Woolfolk,
"and he put it in like a pro."
And like a pro. Rust has proven this
season that the goal was no fluke, but
rather a hint of what lay ahead for him,
who finished the regular season this fall
with a team-leading 18 points.
Rust posted eight goals and two assists
on the season, placing him in a tie for the
fifth-highest point total in the Mountain
Division of the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation and a tie for fourth in goals
scored.
It's been an explosive season for Rust,
who went from a reserve playing in just six
games last season and one the year before
to a starting role and point leader this sea
son.
"The first years were my apprentice
ship." Rust said, referring to his spot be
hind last year's seniors. A.J. Sauer and
Adam Siegman. "1 wanted to play but I
didn't feel ready."
While Sauer and Siegman. who fin
ished second and third in point totals last
season with 20 and 14. respectively, may
have given Rust big shoes to fill, they also
gave him two years of learning from the
best.
And Rust seems to have had no trouble
picking up where they left off.
"He didn't get as much playing time as
he would have liked." Woolfolk said, "but
that just made him more hungry to play.
1 le's been waiting for it and this year has
been a good opportunity for him."
If there were any doubts of Rust's abil
ity to step up this season, it didn't take long
for Rust to prove them false. Seven min
utes into the second half of the Cardinal's
first game of the season Rust had already
notched an assist and a goal.
Rust's move this season into the spot
light comes of no surprise to head coach
Bobby Clark, who first saw Rust playing at
the club regionals in Rust's home state of
Washington.
"I was impressed watching him play
and amazed because his academics were
strong too." Clark said, referring to Rust's
3.94 GPA at Mount Vernon High School.
"I left the tournament very excited be
cause I thought he would be a good fit for
Stanford."

After two seasons behind the scenes, junior forward Luke Rust has broken into the big time this year. He leads the
Cardinal in points with 18.
'â€¢ At Mount Vernon, Rust helped
lead his team to the state title in his
freshman year. I le raked in such hon
ors as three-time All-Wesco selection
from 1995 to 1997 and league MVP
during his senior year.
At the club level. Rust played for
I hc Emerald C'itv Fusion and took
his team to the national finals.
"Stanford is one of the best acade
mic institutions in the country," Rust
said of his choice to continue his soc
cer career at Stanford. "Bobby
[Clark| had just come and the pro
gram wasn't awesome. I don't know if
I felt it was going to go to the next

level like it has, but I had a good feel
ing about Bobby. There was no doubt
in my mind that I would come here if
I could."
Rust soon found that Division I
collegiate soccer at Stanford was a
new experience, a level up from his
high school and club teams. A num
ber of changes were waiting for Rust
as he made his debut at this new level
of soccer. Not only did Rust switch
positions from center midfielder to
forward and spend a lot more time on
the bench than he had been used to,
but he also had to learn a very differ
ent kind of game.
" There was not as big of a focus on
discipline." Rust said. "Now there is a
different emphasis and a lot more
thinking about the game rather than

just doing what feels right."
With time, patience and a lot of
hard work. Rust has adjusted to the
collegiate style of play.
"He has great technical skill, but
more than that he works really hard,"
co-captain T.K. Inbody said. "This
year he has stepped up great."
Rust has come through for the
('ardinal in a couple of key situations.
Rust ended a frustrating battle
against Sacramento State by rifling in
the game-winning shot from senior
co-captain Gerard Davis just two
minutes into overtime. Against I lar
vard. Rust tallied an assist after set
ting up sophomore defender Lee
Morrison, who netted the game-win
ning shot in the 1-ovictory.
Throughout the season. Rust has

combined with Woolfolk to form a
threatening offensive attack in the
front. The pairing has resulted in four
goals for the Cardinal this season.
"Luke is a natural finisher, he
shoots to score," Woolfolk said.
"I le's technically sound and is always
looking to get in on the end."
"1 le's a tough player and the best
is still to come," Clark said. "He
makes good runs into the box and he
has a good soccer brain. He needs to
relax and let his soccer brain take
over to really get to another level."
This Friday would be as a good a
time as any for Rust to take his game
to the next level as the No. 15 Cardi
nal faces No. 19 Santa Clara in the
first round of the NCAA tourna
ment.
