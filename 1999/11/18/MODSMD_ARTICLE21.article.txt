# Rust adds polish to Stanford soccer squad
## Junior forward stars for Cardinal team headed to tourney game with Santa Clara 
### Meghan O'Connor Staff writer 
When junior forward Luke Rust net
ted his first career goal to seal an overtime
victory over No. 4 Washington last fall, the
Stanford men's soccer team must have
known that there would only be more
good things to come.
"It was his first shot of the night," said
fellow junior forward Corey Woolfolk,
"and he put it in like a pro."
And like a pro. Rust has proven this
season that the goal was no fluke, but
rather a hint of what lay ahead for him,
who finished the regular season this fall
with a team-leading 18 points.
Rust posted eight goals and two assists
on the season, placing him in a tie for the
fifth-highest point total in the Mountain
Division of the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation and a tie for fourth in goals
scored.
It's been an explosive season for Rust,
who went from a reserve playing in just six
games last season and one the year before
to a starting role and point leader this sea
son.
"The first years were my apprentice
ship." Rust said, referring to his spot be
hind last year's seniors. A.J. Sauer and
Adam Siegman. "1 wanted to play but I
didn't feel ready."
While Sauer and Siegman. who fin
ished second and third in point totals last
season with 20 and 14. respectively, may
have given Rust big shoes to fill, they also
gave him two years of learning from the
best.
And Rust seems to have had no trouble
picking up where they left off.
"He didn't get as much playing time as
he would have liked." Woolfolk said, "but
that just made him more hungry to play.
1 le's been waiting for it and this year has
been a good opportunity for him."
If there were any doubts of Rust's abil
ity to step up this season, it didn't take long
for Rust to prove them false. Seven min
utes into the second half of the Cardinal's
first game of the season Rust had already
notched an assist and a goal.
Rust's move this season into the spot
light comes of no surprise to head coach
Bobby Clark, who first saw Rust playing at
the club regionals in Rust's home state of
Washington.
"I was impressed watching him play
and amazed because his academics were
strong too." Clark said, referring to Rust's
3.94 GPA at Mount Vernon High School.
"I left the tournament very excited be
cause I thought he would be a good fit for
Stanford."
