Looking to defend its first-place title,
the Stanford's men's crew team will com
pete this Sunday in its last race of the fall
season, the Blair Island regatta.

MEN'S CREW
â–  Sunday: Stanford at the Blair Island Re
gatta. Blair Island Aquatic C enter.

The Blair Island regatta is hosted by the
Blair Island Aquatic Center at the San

Marina Lagoon in Foster City. The orga
nization was formerly known as the Stan
ford Rowing Club, but it recently moved
and became incorporated as the Blair Is
land Aquatic Center. Despite the name, it
has no affiliation with Stanford University
or Stanford Crew.
I ast year. Stanford won the men's var
sity eight race by almost a full minute,
coming in at 17 minutes. 47 seconds. The
squad quickly outpaced competing crew
teams from IK-Davis and HC-Santa Bar
bara.
In this race, the varsity men will enter

four boats in the varsity four race rather
than entering two boats in the open eight
competition, as they have done in previous
regattas.
Although the team does not feel that it
performed up to its potential in the last
few fall regattas, the team is looking to do
well at this regatta and set the tone for the
upcoming spring season.
"Interestingly enough, we aren't per
forming as well as wc did last year, but I
feel that we are rowing faster." said Nate

Sunday, men's crew will duke it out at the Blair Island regatta in Foster City. Last year
at Blair island, the Cardinal swept past UC-Davis and UC-Santa Barbara and finished
with a final time of 17 minutes, 47 seconds.
Matter, a coterminal student in
electrical engineering. "In our last
race we rowed very well, but our
time didn't reflect it because we had
problems taking the turns."
The team wants to use this regat
ta to show that it has got what it
takes to be competitve in the up
coming spring season.
"Although we didn't perform all
that well this fall season, that might
be what it takes to let us know what
level we are going to have to work at
to achieve the goals we have set,"
Matter said. "We have one more
race in which to redeem ourselves,
so we are still looking forward to
that."
As opposed to the previous re
gattas in which the Cardinal has
rowed, this race will not be used to

determine where the team stands in
relation to the competition, the race
is more for personal consumption
that league standings.
"[The Blair Island regatta] is
mostly a local race [with] local
crews," said men's crew coach
Wieslaw Kujda "It's more about
competing against ourselves and
knowing the times."
Although the level of the compe
tition at the regatta makes the race
seem deceptively easy, the course it
self makes sure that the Cardinal's
day won't be a boring one.
"There are a lot of turns in this
race," said senior Will Smith. "It's a
coxswain's nightmare."
In spite of the difficulties of the
course, Stanford has the drive to go
out this weekend and do some dam
age.
"The guys want to really go out
there and try to break the course
record," Kujda said.
