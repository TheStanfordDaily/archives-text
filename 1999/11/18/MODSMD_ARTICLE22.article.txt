Looking to defend its first-place title,
the Stanford's men's crew team will com
pete this Sunday in its last race of the fall
season, the Blair Island regatta.

MEN'S CREW
â–  Sunday: Stanford at the Blair Island Re
gatta. Blair Island Aquatic C enter.

The Blair Island regatta is hosted by the
Blair Island Aquatic Center at the San

Marina Lagoon in Foster City. The orga
nization was formerly known as the Stan
ford Rowing Club, but it recently moved
and became incorporated as the Blair Is
land Aquatic Center. Despite the name, it
has no affiliation with Stanford University
or Stanford Crew.
I ast year. Stanford won the men's var
sity eight race by almost a full minute,
coming in at 17 minutes. 47 seconds. The
squad quickly outpaced competing crew
teams from IK-Davis and HC-Santa Bar
bara.
In this race, the varsity men will enter

four boats in the varsity four race rather
than entering two boats in the open eight
competition, as they have done in previous
regattas.
Although the team does not feel that it
performed up to its potential in the last
few fall regattas, the team is looking to do
well at this regatta and set the tone for the
upcoming spring season.
"Interestingly enough, we aren't per
forming as well as wc did last year, but I
feel that we are rowing faster." said Nate
