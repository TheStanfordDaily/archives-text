# Experts detail medical waste dangers
## 
### Eileen Chao Contributing writer 
Representatives from Green Ac
tion and the Center for Environmen
tal Health came to the Stanford Med
ical Center yesterday to educate stu
dents about environmental and
health hazards created by the inciner
ation of Stanford's medical waste.
Thirteen students attended the in
formational session, which was orga
nized by Students for Environment
Action at Stanford.
Susan C hiang. from Green Action,
and Ann Melamed, from the Center
for Environmental I lealth, described
how Stanford has been sending its
medical waste to Industrial Environ
mental Systems / Norcal for incinera
tion, causing the release of dioxins, a
toxin harmful to both the environ
ment and community members.
"We're really worried about this
issue, especially since the incinerator
is polluting a low-income area," Chi
ang said. "We want the incinerator to
move to other alternatives of dispos
ing waste. No method is perfect, but
others are better [than incineration]."
According to Chiang, lES is the
last commercial incinerator in the
state. There are eight competitors,
but they all use either auto-claving or
microwaving to dispose of waste. She
said lES does have a microwaving fa

cility on site, but uses it for only 10
percent of the waste. Microwaving or
autoclaving would be cleaner alterna
tives because neither method releas
es harmful dioxins.
"Dioxin is toxic in such small
amounts that it must be measured in
parts per trillion." Melamed said. "As
the top of the food chain, humans get
their biggest dose of dioxin through
breast feeding."
Junior Louise Auerhahan said the
cost of microwaving and autoclaving
was actually less than the cost of in
cineration, but that Stanford
switched to lES due to liability issues
after the now-dissolved UCSF-Stan
ford health care merger. Despite the
high cost of switching methods, ac
tivists have generated some support
from state government officials.
"We have been working in coali
tion with [many public officials] who
are interested in finding money to
switch their method, but the compa
ny just hasn't been willing to meet
with us," Chiang said.
The meeting also focused on ef
forts to change the contents of waste
to be disposed.
" Things like PVC plastic, mercury
and heavy metals are thrown into
waste and, with the incinerator tox
ins, get released into the air,"
Melamed said. "Dioxin isn't even a
natural element — it is created during

incineration of certain wastes."
Melamed said one way to de
crease the release of dioxin would he
to reduce the amount of waste that
generates dioxin in the first place. A
nurse for more than 25 years, she said
she remembers reusing and resteriliz
ing hospital equipment.
"Now. it's just unbelievable how
everything is disposed of," Melamed
said. "I'm not saying we should go
back to reusing everything, but a lot
of the waste that we're generating
now is unnecessary. To wash basins
and linens and to resterilize them is
very easy. 1 know because I've done
it."
According to Melamed, some
hospitals are already trying to obtain
materials that can be re-sterilized.
Although both the speakers' orga
nizations have drawn attention to the
problem, students and representa
tives at the meeting agreed that the
issue is far from resolved.
Chris Carlsten, a third-year med
ical student, said he thinks scientific
research would help persuade the
public to take the matter seriously.
"Hard facts and documentation
will be critical to propel this issue into
the forefront." he said.
Students also discussed how they
might increase the medical communi
ty's concern.
"Physicians don't want to harm

the atmosphere, but ultimately, their
main priority is the well-being of their
patients," said second-year medical
student Rachael Molander. "If we
can phrase it not as an environmental
issue, but show them that they're
hurting other people, then they might
see the issue differently."
SEAS members said this input
from medical students was exactly
what they hoped for.
"The med students have knowl
edge of what's going on (in the Med
ical Center] where we don't," said se
nior Cathy Rion, a member of SEAS.
Spearheaded by two medical stu
dents, Molander and first-year Joan
na Wagner, plans are now underway
fora meeting to educate Medical
Center workers about decreasing
waste.
"I was really happy with the how
the event went," said sophomore
Janelle Ishida, a SEAS member.
"Now we have a few contacts with the
Medical School who are very inter
ested and willing to organize events
around it."
Despite the long process of reduc
ing waste, Chiang said she believes
that collaboration with the Medical
School is a step in the right direction.
"It helps to start talking to people
around you because a lot of people
don't really understand the impacts,"
she said.
