### Anuj Gupta Editorial staff 
In a dramatic departure from the
tradition of years past, the Stanford
Band's halftime show at Saturday's
Big Game will refrain from directly
insulting opponent IJC-Berkeley to
comply with an Athletic Department
order. Band public relations director
C hris I lenderson confirmed.
The Band submitted a draft of the
show'sscript to BobCarruesco,assis
tant athletic director for marketing
and ticketing operations yesterday.

"The Band was entirely coopera
tive with our requests," Carruesco
said. Carruesco said he gave his ap
proval to the Band's draft.
"They wanted to kind of get a first
look ()ver it and give us whatever kind
of input they feel is necessary... Ba
sically they asked for no major
changes to what we had today," I len
derson said.
The Band was not upset at the
Athletic Department regulations.
I lenderson said.
"We didn't react as harshly as the
Bay Area media did," said Mender

son. who was interviewed by area
newspapers and television stations
covering the Band's restricted show.
While Henderson declined to re
veal details about the show's content,
he said "there are no particular veiled
references toward Cal."
He only offered the following
cryptic clue: "[The audience] can ex
pect to be able to put themselves in
the same place as the band."
I lenderson said the Band will con
tinue to consult with the Athletic De
partment as they modify the script.
According to Henderson, it is im

portant for the Band to have the de
partment's approval and support, as
"we depend on them for virtually
everything we do," including admit
tance to sports games and permission
to play at events.
"They are bad people for us to
have to be angry at us," he said.
Henderson said he hopes the
Band's compliance will persuade the
Athletic Department to allow more
leeway in future Big Game shows.
"Fora healthy rivalry we better be
able to make fun of each other with
out fear of anyone getting killed."
