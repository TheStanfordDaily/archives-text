## 
### Marisa Pavlik Staff writer 
It was a dark and stormy night on
the Stanford campus ... but where
was the darkest place?
The new ASSU Commission on
Campus Safety is conducting an on
line survey asking students which
campus locations are in greatest need
of improved lighting. The survey will
be online until the end of tall quarter.
"Addressing the issue of how in
adequate campus lighting could
compromise personal safety was my
primary contribution to the platform
on which [ASSU President] Mike
[Levin] and I ran last spring," said
ASSU Vice President John Mills, a
doctoral student in genetics.
Mills is the chair of the commis
sion. which is made up of freshman
executive aides who serve as Senate
associates.
"John and 1 aim to address this
safety concern by improving lighting
in poorly lit areas, as well as imple
menting a number of well-lit walking
routes that will be designated by
signs on lampposts," said Levin, a ju
nior.
The commission will also address
issues such as lighting, alternative
transportation and lack of bike racks.
Levin said.

The first step in the "Safety First"
campaign is the online survey, which
addresses a pressing concern for
many students.
"I genuinely feel that there is a
huge problem with safety here at
Stanford that needs serious consider
ation," said freshman Kareem
Ghanem, a commission member.
"Given the problems so far —
most notably the woman who was at
tacked up at the Dish — it is really
necessary for students to come up
with active solutions to this prob
lem," he said.
The commission is also looking
into the possibility of a program to
"provide transportation home from
parties Friday and Saturday nights
for intoxicated students living in
campus residences," Mills said.
As an incentive for filling out the
campus lighting survey, all respon
dents will be entered in a drawing for
10 $50 gift certificates to the Stanford
Store in Tresidder.
"Our goal is to complete the sur
vey and begin writing a report by the
end of fall quarter," Levin said.
"This report will hopefully pro
vide the basis that we need to prove
our case that adequate lighting and
safety go hand in hand Mills said.
