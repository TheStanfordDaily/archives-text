"There's already one dumb ad wasting

"There won't be two. The front page is
reserved for news only. An eCircles digital
camera giveaway is not news."
"It certainly is," replied Gibbons. "They're
giving away at least 25 AGFA ePhoto 780c
(tin) Digital Cameras per week. Why, that
makes the presidential election seem like a
local bake sale."
"TRAITOR!!! What are they paying you?"
asked Drake.
"I beg your pardon?" wrote Gibbons.
"How much is eCircles bribing you to
defile my glorious fact-filled digest with one
of their silly offers which nobody will read
anyway*?" asked Drake.
"You better be prepared to back tiiat accu
sation up," said Gibbons.
"Back it up?" Drake typed. "I'll mush you,
you string bean. I wrestled in high school,
college, and was boxing champion of my
navy squadron. That abomination will nin
over my dead body."
"I'll be right over," said Gibbons.
"I hope your will is written," said Drake.
The two then left to settle the squabble
by physical means.


"I can assure our readers that a mistake was made, and another od like this will never again appear on the front page of this
publication," said editor Peter Drake from o phone in the Mount Holyoak Intensive Care Unit.
