# Woman Warmed by Child's Sweet Smile Spontaneously Combusts
## 
### 
In a bizarre turn of events, a
woman who proclaimed to have
been warmed by the glow of a
child's innocent face apparently
burst into flames. Clarissa Jones of
< Mail, Tennessee, had allegedly
rushed home to share her joyous
story with the many other hard
working samaritans in her eCircle,
where members meet weekly to
share tales of good deeds and
inspiration. But. moments into her
chat, transcripts obtained by this
reporter indicate that something
went terribly awry. Here is a
port ion of those transcripts:
Clarissa: Friends in good work! I
just have to share with you the
amazing experience I had doing my
good deed an hour ago.
Thomas: Share away, Clarissa
Angela: We're here to love and
cherish you, Clarissa.
Clarissa: I was in the p;irk collect
ing forget-me-nots for the ailing
hold on. I need to wipe my brow
widow down the street. Let's all
wish her our love.
Thomas: We've built a chamber for
her in our heart, Clarissa.
Clarissa: And I saw a mother
pushing a little girl in a stroller. The
little girl smiled, with enough won
derfulness to wipe away all the
fighting in the world-good golly,
I'm hot -and suddenly I was filled

with with warm sunshine, as if—my
gosh I'm iibout f;unt—
Martha: Arc you ()K, Clarissa?
Clarissa: my soul was overflowing
with warm light from the child's
smile I need some ice-im hurnign
uoip-ever since the sunshine hasn't
stopped filing my body-oh my lord,
Im having heatstroke
Angela: all pray for friend and
fellow s;un<iritan Clarissa Jones.
Clarissa: Do't pray. I need an
ambulance (i—n you.
Thomas: Clarissa!
Martha: I've never...
Clarissa: my forehead's a water
fall do something I know fora fact
what you all do in your spare time.
Angela that money you raised did
n't go to Africa it went up your
nose You Thomas you turned that
ppoor wOmans house into a
den of , i'm onto your little
games / my eyeskillingme cant see
help Hep me
Martha: This is a side of her I've
never seen.
Thomas: It's going to take a week
of good deeds to make up for
Clarissa's words.
Clarissa: myfingeresberningcall
puiluice — you
Angela: put our cheeks to
our screens, and feel the lovebeats
of Clarissa's blessed, if occasionally
confused, heart.
Thomas: I/>t's.
After a minute or so of "cyber
hugging," Thomas, Angela, and
Martha said their good-byes, and
logged off. Clarissa's computer
remained online for another half an
hour before being automatically
disconnected.
