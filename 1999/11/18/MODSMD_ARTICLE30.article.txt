# Team Captains Share Concern Over New Cockroach Mascot
## 
### 
On their eCircle, the Crocker
College athletic team captains
met to discuss the Stndent
Council's decision to replace
the school's former tiger mas
cot with that of a cockroach.
"I know they had that
mascot discussion after the
groundbreaking celebration for
the new dorm," typed Sheryl
Johnson, captain of the
women's lacrosse team. "And I
have to wonder if their decision
was influenced by the case of
champagne they reportedly
consumed with dinner."
"And isn't Shelly, the presi
dent, transferring?" asked
Leanne Hatter, the field hockey
captain. "The whole thing seems
kinda suspicious."
"We're the ones that have to
get out there and listen to the
opposing team's insults," said
Pete. "And. boy are we giving
them some ammo."
"Well, I can see how the
council chose it," said lacrosse
captain Miller Angelos. "It starts
with a 'C' like Crocker and
cockroaches are tough, strong,

;uid can survive anything. Isn't it
them and Tupperware that are
supposed to survive a nuclear
holocaust? We can survive a
holocaust. That's pretty positive,
isn't it?"
"And they were right—every
team is some big mammal like
a tiger," said Peter Hart, the
baseball team's captain. "That
had to cliange."
"I love Crocker," said Pierce
Lean, basketball captain, "and it
goes without saying that what
ever mascot they choose I'm
behind 120%). We'll give it our
all. But, I don't know, it seems
like there's an animal out there
that's more... esteemed."
"I don't know what kind of
cheer we're going to put togeth
er for you guys tomorrow,
Pierce," said Missy La Fayette,
captain of the cheerleading
team. "Maybe something like—
Watch us scurry scurry scur
ry! Aj'ter we blow you away,
we'll cat you in a hurry! Go
Roaches!—maybe?"
"That's wonderful. Missy,"
reassured Pierce. "That'll be
great."
"Have you guys seen the
drawing of the mascot yet?"
asked Pete. "I have to say, it's
pretty intimidating."
"Just the thought of facing
an opposing team of five six
foot-ten cockroaches is scary
to contemplate," said Leanne.
"They'll run like hell," said
Miller. "You guys'll nail'em
tomorrow."
Everyone wished Pierce and
his team good luck with their
teiim the next day, and departs!
shortlv after.
