# Fine Arts School Drops Football Program After 0-269 Record
## 
### 
At Eureka Fine Arts School in
Arkansas, the 45-member student
body voted to drop football from
the curriculum after a twelve-year
losing streak, hi their eC'ircle, some
of the art school's former football
players discussed their football
days with conflicting emotions.
Following is a segment of their
online conversation:
"Dropping football is probably a
good thing," typed former line
backer Philip Jeremy. "1 can under
stand the logic behind the Greek
sound mind and sound body thing.
But, I think there might be a way to
stay fit that allows more freedom of
expression."
"I agree," said former offensive
lineman Peter Borges. "Personally,
1 found the other teams' indiffer
ence to our creative ideas to be
frustrating. 1 think our octagonal
field idea, substituting found
objects for that drab ball, and the
incorporation of interpretive dance
into every play would have added
to the game immensely."
"The rules were confining," wrote
former light end Jack Thompson.
"And the uniforms conflicted."
"But, 1 have to admit," said former
QB Brian Shaw. "The humiliation,
my on-field nervous breakdowns,
and the close passes with paralysis
were actually kind of helpful. They
provided inspiration for several

of my canvases like Completion:
The Endless Chimera and
Helmeted Beelzebubs are Trying to
Murder Me."
"Some good came out of it for
me, too," said former linebacker
Ravi Bhimpalasi. "Sculpting with
two broken arms resulted in some
unique pieces and forced me
to break free from the classical
style to which I had previously
confined myself."
"I thought our coach was an
artiste in his own right," said
former running back Frederick
Anka, "as the play diagrams he
drew seemed like pathos-filled, if
clumsy, attempts at nonrepresenta
tional abstractionism."
"And he was always angry
because he felt misunderstood,"
replied Brian. "Like a truly avant
garde artist."
"His repressed creativity also
was evident in the insults he hurled
at our team from the sidelines,"
added Ravi.
"Well despite all the pain, it was
a good experience," concluded
Philip. "I think deeply traumatic
ordeals are often necessary for the
production of meaningful, break
through art-take the First World
War and the Dadaist movement that
followed it as an example-and
I think football certainly served
that purpose."
