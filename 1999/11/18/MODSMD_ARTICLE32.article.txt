Parents Shocked by Photos
Posted by Daughter

On Thursday, November 11th,
Kiltie Wilson, a first-year student at
The Art Establishment in New York
City, used the photosharing feature
of the eCirele she shares with
her family to show them her new
kidney ring.
"Sweetie, tell us this is some kind
of sick joke," her mother typed from
their home in Ohio.
"You put that picture together
on the computer, right?" her father
wrote.
"No, it's real," Katie wrote back.
"You guys are so old-fashioned."
"Mom dad can I get one for my
berthday?" Katie's 11-year-old broth
er, Ralph, typed from his computer.
"It's totally safe," Katie typed. "I
saw the guy wash his hands with
my own eyes. He used soap, water,
and totally promised he wouldn't
smoke in the room while he oper
ated. Besides, everybody in the city
has one of these."
"Take that thing out, immediate
ly," Katie's father demanded.
"Your father and I will pay for
a surgeon-an accredited one-to
perform the operation to remove
it," Kiltie's mother said.
"That's not fair," Katie replied.
"You said I could use that money
to get whatever I wanted for my
18th birthday. This was what I
reiilly wanted."
"Katie, don't you have any respect
for your body?" Katie's mother
asked. "I knew this would happen,
going to art school in New York."
"No. It's my body and I can
mold it into anything 1 want to,"
Kiltie wrote.
"If you had a chane, culd you
lock yourself to a bike rack?"

Ralph asked.
"Why would 1 want to do that,
Ralphie?" Kat ie said.
"Ralph, I think it's time for you
to go to bed," Kiilie's mother said.
"We have some talking to do with
your sister. Alone."
Katie quickly said she had to
leave to study fora test, and "could
they meet later?" Mr. and Mrs.
Wilson agreed to reconvene, but
informed her t here was only going
to be one conclusion to their
discussion-the ring was coming out.
