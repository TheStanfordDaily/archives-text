# Housing, health top newly independent GSC's agenda
## 
### Mills Schenck Contributing writer 
I laving tackled important issues throughout
the summer, the Graduate Student Council is
facing its first year as an independent body rep
resenting Stanford graduate students to im
prove their quality of life. Following a Constitu
tional amendment approved by students last

year, the ASSIJ Senate was split into the CISC'
and the Undergraduate Senate.
The CiSCs influence this year has already
been effective in the development of the Gen
eral I Jse Permit, amendments to the ASSI I con
stitution and the funding of more than 30 grad
uate student groups.
Its role will continue to be impor
tant in the issues ol housing, health
care and promoting the well-being ol
the graduate student community.
I he (iSC was initially created
three years ago as an unofficial group
with the aim ol 'representing the in
terests of Stanford's graduate stu

dents." Alter the amendment's pas
sage, it became one of the two main
bodies ol the ASSI .
Mike Levin, president of the
ASSIJ. said he feels the (iSC has
been extremely effective in repre
senting graduate students since it he
came a part ol the ASSI I.
"The beauty of the new structure
of the ASSlsaid I .cvin, "is that the
representative bodies can more effec
tively serve the needs ol their rcspec

live student constituencies."
So far this year, the (iSC has fo
cused on improving the quality of
graduate life by trying to increase
housing, improve healthcare and pro
mote a greater sense of community.
Kaleb Michaud. chairman of the
CiSC. has been instrumental in the
(iS( s accomplishments since lie
took over as interim head in April.
I le was officially elected in May.
"We need enough money to have

shelter, food and our health." said
Michaud.
Perhaps the greatest success of the
(iSC to date has been its influence
over Stanford's (ieneral I Jsc Permit.
I he shortage of graduate student
housing was no new problem, hut
with many graduate students left
unassigned and rents taking up as
much as two-thirds of students' in
comes. the (iSC knew it needed to
make a strong impact on the Permit.

Through continually strong repre
sentation at University and council
meetings, the C ISC did just that.
"We want Stanford to continue to
be a first rate institution and it-. abili
ty to recruit is just as important to us."
says Michaud. "No one should turn
Stanford down because they aren't
sure they can find a place to live or
survive on the relatively low income
for the area, but it's happening."
There are manv more issues that

will need the attention of the CISC'
this year in order for Michaud's fears
not to be realized. Among the impor
tant upcoming issues are the debate
over health care for dependants,
parking and transportation issues,
and funding for student groups.
ASSU Vice President John Mills,
a former member of the CISC'. said.
"Working together with the (JSC'and
the I IS as one ASSU this year is liter
ally a dream come true."
