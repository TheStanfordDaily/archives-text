I laving tackled important issues throughout
the summer, the Graduate Student Council is
facing its first year as an independent body rep
resenting Stanford graduate students to im
prove their quality of life. Following a Constitu
tional amendment approved by students last

year, the ASSIJ Senate was split into the CISC'
and the Undergraduate Senate.
The CiSCs influence this year has already
been effective in the development of the Gen
eral I Jse Permit, amendments to the ASSI I con
stitution and the funding of more than 30 grad
uate student groups.
