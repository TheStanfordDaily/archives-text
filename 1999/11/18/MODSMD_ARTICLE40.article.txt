## Gaieties descends on Mem Aud 
### 
Big Game week* is upon us, signaling the annual production of Big Game
Gaieties. Originally introduced in 1911 as "Football Follies," a rally for
the Stanford-California rugby game, it has evolved into a Stanford tra
dition all its own.
According to the Web site for Ram's Head, the theatrical group that pro
duces Gaieties, "The show lives and dies on its energy; the traditional audition
motto is 'Enthusiasm, not talent!' It aims at an irreverent, silly and sometimes
'smart-ass' look at Big Game, Cal and Stanford life itself."

Although Gaieties used to be a
plot-less show, the last few have all
had plots. In order to have a cohesive
story, it is necessary to start the writ
ing process early. The writing staff for
the show is hired before Dead Week

of winter quarter, eight months before Gaieties runs. They begin to formulate
ideas (as the producer formulates his or her "vision" for the play) over spring
break. There are eight to 10 writers, and this year it was a very competitive
process, according to junior Carina Uraiqat, the producer of this year's Gai
eties.
"We tried to bring in people who haven't been involved in Gaieties before
fora different perspective, while keeping a good number of writing and acting
veterans. With the success of 'Gaieties 98: Farmageddon,' the writing staff felt
that we could stray from the formulaic Gaieties a little," said Uraiqat.
Although she could not reveal the details of this year's script, she did state
that "Branner [still] sucks."
So how is this musical comedy created? "We start with a plot skeleton, then
try to brainstorm Stanford locations where scenes can happen. After that, we
flesh out the central characters and go from there. Finally, we try to find a title
that fits," said senior Steven Aronowitz, this year's writing facilitator.
The last few years, the show's name has been based on a popular movie.
This year, the show is called "Farm Wars: The Berkeley Menace."
Besides the writing, there are many*other components in the creation of
Gaieties. According to Uraiqat, "Gaieties is a lot like a baby. The producer
starts working on it winter quarter, and nine months later, here it is."
The script is finished over the summer and perfected at the beginning of the
year. Staff such as director, choreographer, vocal director, technical director,
lighting, sound, set designers and composers are hired in the middle of spring
quarter. Music composition took place this year during the summer by a team
of three and was touched up by two this quarter.
Auditions are held the second week of fall quarter, and Ram's Head starts
rehearsals immediately after the show is cast. Everyone who makes it is rolled
out of bed at 4 a.m. Six weeks later, the actors are ready to go on stage.

The show stars "34 of Stanford's most talented actors in the biggest theatre on cam
pus," Uraiqat said. However, therje isn't a typical Gaieties "type," as many people be
lieve. There are some common threads thoughout the class: willingness to forsake class
es for rehearsals, good humor and high energy. Towards the end, "there are about 25
hours of rehearsals per week," said Uraiqat.
Despite the amount of work involved, students enthusiastically devote the time re
quired to make the show work. Senior Jason Mendelson, who will be producing "Pip
pin" for Ram's I lead in the spring, said, "Gaieties is so much fun to be a part of no mat
ter what one's involvement is in the show, from cast member to piano player to audi
ence member. It is an experience like no other!"
So what is the point of Gaieties? Although there are often light-hearted jabs at Stan
ford life in general, "Mean, bad, stupid, hippie Weenies are begging to be picked on,"
Uraiqat said.
"We basically just want a Stanford audience to be enchanted fora couple hours, to

remember why they are here and why they love [Stanford] and to leave Mem Aud smil
ing," Uraiqat said.
Mendelson has noticed the excitement that comes with Gaieties. "Along with Big
Game, Gaieties provides the final and most important bonding experience that mem
bers of the Stanford community will have this century," he said.
Another Gaieties tradition is the appearance of campus "celebrities." This year,
look for Dean of Admissions Robert Kinnally, Dean of Students Marc Wais, Vice
Provost James Montoya and, of course, University President Gerhard Casper.
"Gaieties is an integral part of Stanford's history and tradition. 1 hope everyone
comes to see it [on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m.]," Aronowitz said. "Bv
the way, the show is a bit on the raunchy side this year."
