# In 'The Shawl,' Mamet wraps his audience in mysticism

Expectations are not necessarily a good thing to
have going into a review. If you know me as a
critic, I constantly tout David Mamet's "The
Spanish Prisoner" as exemplary entertainment.
Mamet has also worked on "Wag the Dog" and
"Hoffa," but he originally started out as strictly a the-

atrical playwright. One
of his productions, "The
Shawl," is an intense and
verbose one-act scripted
in 1985.
Imagination Pro
ductions put together
this three-person perfor
mance rather seamlessly
for the four-dav run. The

intimacy of the setting — a small back room in Cafe Du
Nord — allowed everyone to become fully divested in
the material. As an aside, all you wild and crazy stu

dents out there can take in a casual drink at the Caf6
Du Nord bar, where fashionable 20-somethings play
pool and idly talk about their days.
Jason Frazier, whose previous acting credits include
a stint in"The Crucible," stars as John, an earnest psy
chic who faces a difficult choice. Miss A.(a stoic
Michelle Starrs) comes to John one day, and wouldn't
you know, she has a problem in her life. John eventual
ly narrows the matter to her mother's will, something
that could potentially bring John great financial re
wards.
The reason? John's friend, Charles (Richard Gal
lagher), strongly urges him to take advantage of her by
faking a seance and endorsing the complete transfer of
inheritance money to John. To Charles, this is merely a
matter of money and greed. The ends justify the means,
and he and John would reap the rewards.
John balks at the idea, mainly because he is a good
guy with hardened principles. But he also believes that

psychic methodology — where events and facts can be
dug from people's lives — is a type of science. Infor
mation can be gathered from libraries and from reac
tions, For example, John can repeat a phrase such as
"husband" and instantly tell, based on facial expres
sions or body movements, whether the woman was re
cently widowed or divorced or beaten.
"The Shawl" takes a few twists and has very metic
ulous, repetitive dialogue, much like "The Spanish
Prisoner." But the quick pacing of the conversations
between John and Charles or John and Miss A. made
for an intellectual and enlightening experience in the
city.
Imagination Productions is putting on another play
series, Sam Shepard's "Savage Love," from Nov. 26-28
at the Theatre Rhinoceros, located at 2926 16th St. Call
