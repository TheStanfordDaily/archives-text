There is only one road leading out of Whitticker, Ariz., population 641, and it is
a road Ruby Pearson has been unable to take during her 25 years of life. With
a recently imprisoned husband. Ruby feels it is prime time for her to break free
from the stifling confines of her small town life.
Robin Troy's debut novel, "Floating," brings us deep into the web of desire, love

~ and betrayal that marks the beginning of Ruby's jour
ney on the road to freedom.
The novel starts with the arrest of Ruby's hus
band, Carl, a man who is tired of playing second fiddle
to his independent, beautiful young wife. Desperate for
_ recognition and a renewed sense of self, Carl decides to

leave town in his wife's pickup truck. On his way out, drunk and irate over the sug
gestion that his wife's child is not his, Carl holds up the local 7-Eleven, only to be
caught by police several hours outside of town.
Ruby, relieved to be free of her deadbeat husband, is ripe for something«w/some
one new. When a handsome, confident cowboy named Sean ambles into town, he soon
receives the same level of admiration from the townsfolk Ruby has always taken for
granted. This leads her to believe she has finally found her match. Unfortunately, Sean
turns out to be her husband's brother.
Though the novel crisply captures the swelling passion between these two lovers, it
fails to show anything more than a physical relationship between Ruby and Sean. As
Ruby so bluntly admits to Sean, "We've never really talked." Yet, when Ruby is faced

with the climatic choice she must make between her husband and her lover, the read
er is expected to buy the profoundness of her choice between duty and true love. Per
sonally, I saw Ruby and Sean's relationship as nothing more than an incredibly strong
case of lust.
This ill-fated love affair takes center stage in this tightly woven story, but by no
means is it all "Floating" offers. Ruby's conflicted relationship with her impression
able but remarkably wise son captures the best of what debut novelist Troy has to
offer. I found 8-year-old Brian to be the only redeemable, likable character in this
novel.
Brian is a sensitive boy with eyes wide open to the disintegration of his parents'
marriage and to the adulterous relationship between his mother and uncle. He also
seems to be the only character with any sense or ability to direct his own life. The
poignancy with which Troy captures his emotional coming-of-age is the highlight of
the story.
Troy's remarkable sense of detail and rhythm attest to the brilliance of her writing
ability. Her vivid descriptions powerfully give the reader a sense of place, yet I still
found this newel a challenge to sift through. It is difficult to read about people you nei
ther like nor care about, even when you can admire the actual writing. It is clear Troy
has found her unique voice, but I am curious to see how she uses that voice to write
something more profound in the coming years.
