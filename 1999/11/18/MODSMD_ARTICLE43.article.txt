## Artist: Garage á Trois Album: 'Mysteryfunk' 
### 
While recording Stanton Moore's first solo
album, the funk trio consisting of Moore on
drums, Charlie I lunter on eight-string guitar
and Skerik on saxophone engaged in what they refer to
as some "late-night fishing expeditions." The results of
these "expeditions" were just released as an album en
titled "Mysteryfunk" under the band name Garage a
Trois.
Each member of the group assumed a Spanish alibi.
Stanton Moore became El Mangosta, Skerik became El
Guzano and Charlie Hunter became El Balzac. Fur
ther, they decided to release the album only on vinyl.
"Mysteryfunk" is described as "eclectronica," which
seems to hint that the album will contain music that
sounds something like techno, only more eclectic.
The band is quick to point out, however, that the
album was recorded live, with no overdubs and no sam
ples. T he entire album has only four songs, lasting a pal
try 24 minutes. However, those 24 minutes seem like
more than enough.

The album opens with an eerie laugh, followed by a
saxophone scream that echoes as if in a large room. The
heavy funk beat that typifies Stanton Moore's drum
ming comes in, bringing with it a heavy funk bass line
and a wah-wah guitar that interacts with the saxophone.
These sounds, combined with some synthetic effects,
make up the entirety of the first track. Concluding the
first side is a song that resembles a particularly intricate
techno song — sounding like a cross between a rave
and a video game.
The third song is a slow funk with a pretty saxophone
melody. The sax never strays far from the melody, and
the drum / bass / guitar rhythm holds steady to the beat.
By the end, however, the unchanging funk grows stale.
The last song starts out with a heavy guitar riff that is
a refreshing change after the 23 minutes of slow mo
notonous funk. Unfortunately, about 40 seconds into
the song, someone's voice interrupts the music, saying
something like, "Hey, we should make a record of
this!" That ends the record.

Overall, I was pretty disappointed with "Mystery
funk." However, before one condemns music by such
skilled musicians, one should try to think about what
the musicians were trying to do with the music.
Free jazz, for example, often sounds like chaos.
Many free jazz musicians who have demonstrated their
skills elsewhere intentionally set out to create sonic
thing new. The results may or may not sound good, but
it at least deserves a second listen.
Nonetheless, "Mysteryfunk" sounds like the band
was just tooling around in the studio one night, and it
happened to get recorded. Then, just for kicks, it was
released under the name Garage a Trois. I don't think
there was any intent behind it — most of the songs
sound like none of the musicians knew what to do. The\
all simply repeat their parts over and over, with none of
the melodic development or improvisation that charac
terized Moore's debut album.
