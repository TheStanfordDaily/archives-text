# Artist: The Mr. T Experience Album: 'Alcatraz'
## 
### 
The Berkeley-based Mr. T Experience has been
around since before Green Day got big. Further,
they have been making quite a name for them
selves outside of the Bay Area ever since the 1995 release
"Love Is Dead" and the similarly sounding but equally
catchy "Revenge Is Sweet And So Are You" in 1997.
Both of these albums displayed the ultimate evolution
of The MTX's pop-punk sound, and the fact that the
band helped craft this genre back in the Gilman days
seems somehow removed from the undeniably uppity
songs-about-girls that dominated their last couple of al
bums.
Dr. Frank, lead vocalist and guitarist for the group, ex
pressed public annoyance that the last two full-lengths
had a similar sound, which is not to say they weren't suc
cessful in their own right. I lowever, The MTX's latest ef
fort, "Alcatraz," shows that The Mr. T Experience is not
a band that is afraid to demonstrate musical growth and a
flair for the experimental. Straying away from an enor
mously popular formula to try out new paths is what
makes "Alcatraz" a solid album — despite the fact that it
may not contain the omnipresent infectiousness of its two
predecessors.
The record starts off with pop in its purest form. "I
Wrote a Book About Rock and Roll," "Naomi" and
"Self-Pity" seem to be intentionally missing any sort of
punk drive; rather, their mid-paced pop sound sets a nice
tone for what is to follow.

All in all, "Al
catraz" is probably
some of the most
toned-down song
writing to have
sprung from the
mind of Dr. Frank
in years, most like
ly an influence of
his solo acoustic ef
forts, collected last
spring on their
own CD. Don't get
me wrong, though.
There is certainly
not a lack of ener
gy in these pieces,
as evidenced on
tracks such as
"We're Not No
One" and "Our

Days Arc Numbered," which recall the "Love Is Dead"
touch of female-inspired rock-n-roll.
But a composition like "Two Of Us," which has Dr.
Frank slowly narrating a relationship-in-action with
phrases such as "Easy, baby" in a strange, Elvis drawl,
marks "Alcatraz" as a record where the songs often
sound decidedly different from one another. Such a state-

ment would be hard
to make about any
thing off of "Re
venge Is Sweet And
So Are You" and
"Love Is Dead."
There is the
acoustic-based
"Hey Emily" sand
wiched in between
a wealth of pop
songs, while "Re-
Activate Your
Heart" has a slow,
sultry sound. "To
morrow Is A Harsh
Mistress" may be a
landmark for the
band because its
lyrics are not explic
itly about girls.

And what is The MTX if not a band that writes love
songs about girls? The answer, of course, is "Alcatraz,"
their ninth and possibly final album. This may not be ex
actly what the public wants to hear, but "Alcatraz" is def
initely worth listening to just because of that.
