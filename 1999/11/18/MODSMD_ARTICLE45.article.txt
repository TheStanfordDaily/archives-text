# Artist: Sasha Album: 'Xpander'
## 
### 
Sasha's most recent release, the "Xpander" EP. achieves
the quality we've come to expect from the world-famous!
DJ. The EP, which was mixed and produced by Sasha.
contains five tracks written by various artists.
The title track is pure techno; swirling synthesizers and quiv
ering strings accompany a pulsating beat. Featuring an interest
ing blend of upbeat electronic sounds, "Xpander" provides a
catchy melody ideal for the giddy raver.
Indeed, "Xpander" stands out as the EP's best song. Thank
fully, the EP includes both a four-minute edit and a 12-minute
extended version of the track.
The EP's final three tracks, however, are also impressive ef-

forts. The third and fourth tracks, "Belfunk" and "Rabbitweed," are far darker than
the title track. Both songs are sparse instrumentally, crocking an industrial edge. In ad
dition, the songs' scratchy beats and imposing bass lines produce a tense mood.
"Rabbitweed" is especially nerve-wracking as high-pitched, eerie, electronic
squeals grind against a throbbing bass line. The song has an ominous tone appropriate
fora villainous cult leader's theme song, playing in the background as he conducts
some sort of diabolic ritual.
The EP's final selection, "Baja," acts as a come-down track. It is moving, heartfelt,

mellow and ethereal, featuring comforting chants and nurturing chords.
The listener's journey is thus thorough and complete. I have listened to this EP
under a variety of circumstances. It is at its best under dim lighting with debaucherous
behavior in mind.
Like most electronica, the music is simple, repetitive and relatively predictable.
Nonetheless, the tracks are competently mixed and engineered, and while the
melodies are neither utterly brilliant nor overly innovative, the EP is a worthy listen.
