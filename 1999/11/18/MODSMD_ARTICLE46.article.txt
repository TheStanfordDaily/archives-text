# Artist: Phish Album: 'The White Tape'
## Album: 'The Siket Disc' 
### 
In 1983, at the University of Vermont, future Phish guitarist Trey Anastasio, a
freshman majoring in philosophy, met future Phish drummer Jon Fishman, a
freshman studying chemical engineering. The two, along with another guitar play
er, began the unique musical endeavor which would become the band Phish.
In 1984, Anastasio took a semester off to do some four-track recording. This, com
bined with some recordings done by bass player Mike Gordon and some recordings
of the band as a whole, were put together on a tape. This tape, which was used for pro
motional purposes, came to be known as "The White Tape." Although it was never
officially released as an album, it is now available through Phish's Web site
(www.phish.com).
Fast forward 13 years to 1997. Phish, now one of the most popular touring acts in
the nation, goes into Bearsville Studios to do some recording. The concept is simple:
just play, record what happens and sort through the tapes later to find the good ideas
and turn them into songs.
The resulting album, "The Story of The Ghost," was released in 1998. Keyboardist
Page McConnell then edited and arranged the studio tapes from the initial sessions.
The product of his efforts was"The Siket Disc," which is now also available through
Phish's Web site.
For Phish fans, these albums are potentially invaluable. "The White Tape" is a rare
opportunity to hear Phish while they were still developing, while "The Siket Disc" is
a rare glimpse behind the creative process of making a studio album. But be fore

warned, these are not as polished as the Phish albums you could find in a store.
"The White Tape" is a mixture of songs played by the entire band, songs recorded
completely by Anastasio and songs recorded by Gordon. Many of the songs are rough
versions of songs that were later released. Phish classics such as "You Enjoy Myself,"
"Divided Sky" and"Run Like an Antelope" are among the songs on this album.
"You Enjoy Myself," which was a 10-minute-long composition when Phish's first
studio album, "Junta," was released two years later, is presented here as a one-minute
a cappella ditty. Other songs arc more developed, but all have a ways to go. Of course,
being a home project, the sound quality is far from professional.
I found that every song recorded by Mike Gordon was annoying. In "N02," for ex
ample, he attempts to simulate the experience of going to the dentist and being given
nitrous gas. There is a high-pitched drilling sound, and the far-off voices remind the
listener to "open wide." It is certainly not a pleasant track.
It's interesting to hear how far the band's musical skills have developed since this
first recording. Guitarist Trey Anastasio's recent guitar work is a unique mix of blues,
rock, funk and jazz. On "The White Tape," his solos are for the most part blues licks
with a strong hint of his future uniqueness. One of his solos has a distinct '80s-rock feel
to it, while some others just sound bad.
"The Siket Disc" is a sharp contrast to "The White Tape." It is largely abstract and
aimless. The music wanders without any direction, often repeating one monotonous
idea over and over. There are rarely lyrics or melody.
Most Phish fans are familiar with the group's concept of jamming. At some point
in nearly every show, they enter into a musical drone. Each of them simply plays one
repeated part over and over again, with little variation. "The Siket Disc" is essential
ly a complete album of drones.
Phish's drones are tolerable only because the music seems so great after the drone
ends. The problem with "The Siket Disc" is that the drones don't end until the CD
does. Most of the songs are dark and melancholy. Overall the album feels pretty drea
ry though certainly not offensive. At best it would make good background music.
I would recommend that only true, die-hard Phish fans get either of these albums.
Neither are as good as the other recordings the band has made. "The White Tape" is
interesting and has some pretty good songs. It's especially nice if you are curious to
hear early unprofessional recordings of the developing musicians. However, unless
you like Phish's drones, you should probably stay away from"The Siket Disc." It is a
nice concept but just doesn't quite work as an album. Some things are better left on
the cutting room floor.
