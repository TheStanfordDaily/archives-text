## Things Come Together 
### 
The Roots strive to define themselves with
live performances, and why not? Every per
formance is an original experience. Creativi
ty overflows with each song as each member of the
crew brings his own unique style.
On Saturday, Stanford will be privileged enough
to host a Roots show in Memorial Auditorium put
on by the Stanford Concert Network. This show will
be a treat for hip-hop heads and other music lovers.
The Roots are currently touring various univer
sities and cities. They will be performing in San
Francisco the night before they play at Mem Aud.
So what makes the dvnamics of this group so spe-

cial? The combination
of the wonders of jazz
and the art of hip-hop
creates a mystique un
heard of in rap music.
Does the music in
dustry appreciate the
pure organic sound of
unco m promising
lyrics and the multi
layered beats of live
instruments? In the
last year, the Roots
have slowly begun to
get the acclaim they
deserve. They have
five albums to date, in
cluding a new live
album called "Roots
Come Alive."
The Roots have
shown their versatility
— whether it be mas
tering instruments, fir-

ing vicious lyrics or creating beats on a turntable or
with the use of a human beatbox. "Illadelph
Halflife" and "Organix" have proven to be their
strongest albums to date, although both went rela
tively unnoticed. Each album carried the group to a
higher level of hip-hop using a creative, new sound.

Their break
through album was
"Things Fall Apart,"
with the chart-top
ping hit "You Got
Me" featuring
Ervkah Badu. After

this release, the Roots could no longer be referred
to as an underground group.
Hailing from West Philadelphia or Illadelph
(I heir coined name for their hometown), the Roots
comprise of Rah/el, Scratch, ?uestlove, Kamal,
Malik B, Hub and the heart of the group, Black
Thought.
Rah/el is the human beatbox who released his
own album over the summer called "Making the
Music 2000." What makes Rah/el unique is that he
adds an old-school influence to the Roots by rein
carnating one of the most innovative aspects of hip
hop forgotten by many people caught up behind the
production boards.
On past albums Rah/.el recreated songs of other
artists, most notably Wu-tang's "Wu-tang Clan
Ain't Nutin' to F*** Wit." Although not as sharp as
Black Thought on the microphone, Rahzel has
some lyrical abilities of his own, fueled by his cre
ative mindset.
Scratch accompanies Rah/.el as the DJ — or self
proclaimed human turntable — and is the other

beatbox of the group. It is quite a sight to see the two
of them to go head to head, seemingly creating
whole songs with nothing more than a microphone.
The most acclaimed member of the group. Black
Thought, is now one of the top lyricists in the indus
try. He transcends the average rapper by pouring
out his emotions to express his concerns about pol
itics, philosophy or love for hip-hop and women.
Black Thought captures the world through his
lyrics and gives perspectives that interweave
smoothly with the jazzy background provided by
the band. The silky sound of the keyboard is com
pliments of Kamal. the group's so-called "klanger."

Malik B is the less
acclaimed lyricist of
the group, but give
him time, and he'll
begin to get the re
spect Black Thought
has already earned.
It's funny Malik B
and Black Thought
once had a hip-hop
battle in college.
Malik is the underrat
ed MC of the group,
much like Phife of A
Tribe Called Quest or
inspektah Deck of the
Wu-tang Clan.
When the word
"bass" is associated
with hip-hop, it
doesn't usually refer
to a bassist like Hub of
the Roots. He adds
jazz flavor to the

group and gives it a distinctively mellow yet addic
tive sound.
Finally, at every Roots show, one man steals it
with his charismatic solos. Vuestlove is the ultimate
drummer in hip-hop. He always has fun, whether he
is taking his drum into the crowd or standing in front
of the spotlight beating against his drum set with a
gleaming smile and puffy afro.
These are the Roots. They call themselves "the
legendary," and with good reason. Ever since their
successful attempt to be embraced by the main
stream as well as the underground, everyone has
wanted to be them. Artists such as the Black Eyed
Peas, Common and Mos Def have followed their
steps, and all have begun to climb to the forefront of
hip-hop.
A Roots concert has everything: hip-hop, jazz,
rock, classics, covers and anything else that may
spring into the band members' minds during their
performance. Mem Aud is ideal for the Roots show,
for it will be large enough to let a lot of people enjoy
the show, yet small enough that the performance
can be personal, and the emotion that goes into the
music can be felt by each individual present.
Even if you don't like hip-hop, do yourself a
favor and buy a ticket for the show. If you know
anything about hip-hop, no one needs to tell you
where to be on Saturday night. You won't see any
shinny suits or money being flashed, and you will
definitely not hear any songs degrading women or
promoting violence. You will see how the power of
instruments and carefully crafted lyrics can elevate
hip-hop to another level.

So what makes the
dynamics of this

The combination of

tique unheard of in
rap music.
