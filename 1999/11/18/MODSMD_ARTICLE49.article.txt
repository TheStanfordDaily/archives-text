## Artist: Eurythmics Album: 'Peace' 
### 
After a 10-year hiatus, singer Annie Lennox and instru
mentalist Dave Stewart met fora one-off reunion that
quickly cemented into a full-blown reformation of their
duo, the Eurythmics. "Peace," out now, is the result.
As with many bands who have gotten back together as of late,
the Eurythmics have not been unheard of since their heyday.
Lennox came out with the commercial and critical solo smash,
"Diva," followed by an underrated covers album, "Medusa."
Stewart involved himself in a handful of projects, including one
of the few instrumentals to make the Top 4() this decade, "Lily
Was Here," with saxophonist Candy Dulfer.

Still, their solo output has been relatively sparse, so the reunion has been eagerly
anticipated. With Lennox's solo success and the relatively amicable character of their
breakup, the duo's return doesn't seem like a cynical money-grab.
However, while "Peace" is a good album, it's likely to be a disappointment to many.
Eurythmics fans are likely to see the album as Lennox's, musically lush and organic,
with Annie's voice dominating the affair. Lennox fans are likely to see it as a Euryth
mics album, oriented more toward pop music with lyrics de-emphasizing the personal
in favor of the abstract.
This abstractness is likely to alienate many of the fans who admired the directness
and intimacy of "Diva," the last album Lennox both sung and composed. Eight years
of living and raising a family do not seem to have made much of an impact on this
album's content.
Most songs on "Peace" have a repeated main refrain and understate the other lyrics
— just as well, since many rely on cliche. Some are just plain weak, especially the track

The Ratings:
Oh, I've gotta check out Gaieties tonight. ★★★★★
Swimming at Lake Lag? Nah, but a bonfire sounds good.
Kant is such a fascinating read ... wanna go out on a date? ★★★
I-banking? Sounds good, sign me up. ★★
Cal's Oski is the epitome of mascots. ★

"Peace is Just a Word." Lennox is a master of style, but some songs here simply lac
substance.
Still, sparks fly as often as not, especially on "17 Again" and "I've Tried Ever)
thing." In the latter song, Lennox declares, "I should be cool / But I'm burning hot /
should be good / But I fell apart / Don't look at me now don't even start / Cause I'v
tried everything." The aching chorus simply states, "You're a loser now," and it's har
to tell whether it's referring to the man in question or to herself. Such high points ar
what we hope of Lennox, and the subtle music Stewart provides underscores the sac
ness, falling like rain on Lennox's mournful parade.
Yes, the subjects of the songs — love lost, motherly love, materialism and immoi
tality — cover well-tread ground. The music isn't too much of a'departure, either. Bi
when the Eurythmics pull it off, they pull it off well. This reunion is worth maintaining
