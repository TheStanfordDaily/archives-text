## Usher doesn't 'Light It Up' on the silver screen 
### 
£ "W" ight it Up" starts off with a
tense scene in a decrepit
school in Queens,
N.Y., yet the movie goes nowhere
with a convoluted plot, ridiculous
premise and terrible acting. The
movie, written and directed by Craig
Bolotin ("That Night"), stars Usher
in his first leading role. Let's just say
the best performance by an usher in
this movie was the one who showed
me to my seat.

Light It Up
Usher
Forest Whitaker
98 minutes
Rated R
Now playing everywhere

There is little more to say for the
performances of the other teen ac
tors, including Sara Gilbert. The only
bright spots are the restrained, veter
an actors Forrest Whitaker and Judd
Nelson, who both made the best of a

bad situation. Vanessa Williams plays the
compassionate policewoman who negoti
ates with the student hostage takers, hut
she adds little besides a motherly voice of
reason.
Now to the plot, lister, played by
Usher, is a star basketball player at a
stereotypically "bad" school. One morn
ing, Lester's class with the benevolent
Mr. Knowles (Judd Nelson) cannot find a
room, in a school where the heating does
not work, there are not enough books,
etc. The other students in Lester's class

are Ziggy (Robert Ri'chard), an eccentric
student who will not go home because his
father beats him; Stephanie (Rosario
Dawson), a leggy intellectual with a con
science; Rodney (Fredro Starr from rap
group Onyx), a tough hood with a violent
attitude; and Rivers (Clifton Collins Jr.),
a pot-smoking, witty, street-smart cynic.
The ever-caring Mr. Knowles takes his
ciass to a local diner to teach his eager
class. When was the last time you saw
such a good, wholesome teacher and stu
dents who are so enthusiastic about

school? In any case, a robber enters the
diner and demands to have Usher's crap
py watch. Why a shotgun-wielding rob
ber would ask for an old watch instead of
robbing the cash register is a mystery to
me.
Mr. Knowles becomes a hero when he
knocks out the robber. Unfortunately,
the school principal reprimands rather
than congratulates Knowles, leading to a
rise in anger from the students.
Ziggy then gets handed a suspension
and begins to complain he doesn't want

to go home because of his father.
After the principal calls the school
security guard (Forest Whitaker),
Ziggy becomes so enraged that the
ensuing struggle leads to an acciden
tal shooting.
When the principal tells another
officer to arrest Ziggy, Usher grabs
Whitaker's gun and tells the princi
pal and the other cop to leave. At this
point all but the aforementioned
group of teens leave the building.
Usher leads the group who holds the
injured Whitaker hostage in the
school and makes demands such as
new books, better heating and work
ing school windows. Eventually the
cops surround the building, and this
is where the movie is supposed to get
good, but it never does.
Bolotin's inabilities show in the
scene where the students confront
the principal over the firing of their
beloved teacher. Bolotin attempts to
convey increasing tension through a
jittery handheld camera and an in
creasingly loud soundtrack full of
sirens and screams. While these de-

vices work initially, they are not subtle
and get in the way of the narrative conti
nuity of the film.
Advice to Usher: keep your day job,
because your acting is about as subtle as
your forehead. Advice to the viewer: save
your money unless you want to go
through a boring, uncreative movie. If
you want a good teen movie, rent "Fast
Times at Ridgemont High."
