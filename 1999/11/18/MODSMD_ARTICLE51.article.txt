# Make sure you go 'Anywhere But Here'

It may already he too late by now. You may have been suckered into this ma
nipulative. estrogen-laeed film based solely on star power. (Heck, that's why
I went — my ex-roommate is a huge Natalie Portman fan.) Because there
really is nothing more that director Wayne Wang offers in his latest, "Anywhere
But Here."
Susan Sarandon and Portman are the mother-daughter pair endlessly pro-

moted in commercials and posters. They have a
decent amount of film experience behind them,
as does Wang (" The Joy Luck Club"). Everyone
involved seems to be oblivious to the fact that
they have collaborated to make a movie hardly
anyone wants to see.
1 know I may raise the ire of countless Port
man fans, especially after her high-profile role in
"Episode I," but she really is annoying and flat in

her role as Ann August. Along with her mother, Adele (Sarandon), the two
drive from Bay C ity, Wis., to Beverly Hills as a way to restart their lives.

Fish-out-of-water story, from start to finish. It gets tiresome to have toendure these
trite and carefully manufactured tales time after time. I remember the "kind" L.A.P.D
officer who lets Adele go not once but twice for different traffic infractions. I force my
self to forget (unsuccessfully) about the phone call where not one but two family mem
bers have suffered life-threatening injuries in separate places.
I suppose Wartg means well. He pulled mightily on the heartstrings in the decent but
weepy "The Joy Luck Club,"and you can be assured of hitting moments where tears
well up. I think of the choir rendition of Sarah McLachlan's "I Will Remember You"
as a great reminder of the power of manipulation. Ed Harris hit it right on when he said,
"Cue the music," in"The Truman Show."

But the drivel only accumulates to the point where you want to gag. The characters
are either unlikable and static or simply boring and conventional. There is nothing to
challenge you, outside of the occasional witty observations about the Beverly Hills
lifestyle. Even Notorious 8.1.G. knew about this, though, with his song, "Mo Money,
Mo Problems."
So if you're in the mood fora big-time melodramatic movie about two arguing fe
males who endlessly struggle just to keep the electricity going, see "Anywhere But
Here." Otherwise, go somewhere else for entertainment.
