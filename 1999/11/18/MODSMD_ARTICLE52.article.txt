# Depp soars again in Sleepy Hollow' update
## 
### 
£ leepy Hollow," Tim Burton's latest film, is
based on the Washington Irving short story and
offers everything one might expect from a Bur
ton movie. Best known for his skillful direction on the
first two "Batman" movies as well as the witty and
bizarre humor found in such films as "Beetlejuice" and
"Mars Attacks," Burton won't disappoint fans with

"Sleepy Hollow."
In addition, Danny
Elfman's musical genius
allows for the perfect
minor-key scoring of the
movie, tiie town of Sleepy
Hollow is completely
grey and black with nary a
bright color in sight and

Johnny Depp is dead-on as city constable Ichabod Crane.
It is Depp's depth of acting that carries this movie. It
is no surprise that his under-appreciated talents have
once again been sought by Burton to anchor a motion
picture. The two previously collaborated on "Edward
Scissorhands" and "Ed Wood."
Furthermore, Depp's refusal to be typecast — as he
can believably play a high school narc, an FBI agent or
Hunter S. Thompson — allows for another surprisingly
impressive turn as Ichabod, the skeptical city boy who
comes to Sleepy Hollow to investigate strange murders
involving decapitated heads.
The movie's plot is straightforward and familiar: Ich
abod, a man who believes reason and science offer solu
tions to all of life's mysteries, goes to the small town of
Sleepy Hollow to try and discover who is killing off
townspeople by chopping off their heads.
To complicate matters, these heads are never found,
and all of the townfolk seem positive that the killer's
identity is none other than the Headless Horseman, a
vengeful ghost of an old Hessian mercenary who sold his
soul to Satan.

Add in Christina Ricci as Katrina Van Tassel, the spir
it-summoning love interest for Depp, and you're left with
the perfect mix for today's mainstream audience: some
violence, a bit of romance, great special effects and a
somewhat problematic script.
The script's trouble has to do with the fact that it is a
bit too ambitious. It introduces a lot but then leaves

things underde
veloped. A con
voluted plot in
volving land and
property owner
ship is presented
as the mystery
driving the
Horseman's mo
tives, while the
abundance of
minor characters
serving as Horse
man fodder does
not allow for
much emotional
investment on
the audience's
part when they
meet their
demise.
And as for the

Depp-Ricci chemistry, it seems superfluous to the plot
and at times ridiculously forced. Since Ricci has another
suitor when Depp arrives in Sleepy Hollow, tension
should have developed between the two men, but that
angle is never fully explored. Soon, we are left with Icha
bod and Katrina saying cheesy lines to each other such as,
"Katrina, I think there is a little bit of a witch in you —
because you've bewitched me."
Weak? You bet. But "Sleepy Hollow" has positive as

pects which largely outweigh the negative. A flashback
sequence displaying the Horseman's origin has a fang
hearing, vampiric-looking Christopher Walken playing
the mercenary to perfection. And the Headless Horse
man himself is quite a wonder to look at. Computer ef
fects aside, the man on the horse is played by Ray Park
(Darth Maul himself), so you know that the Horseman's

acrobatic Sith-Lord skills lead to some serious head slic
ing.
Which is not to say "Sleepy Hollow" is an action or
slasher film. It'saTim Burton film. If you thought "Mars
Attacks" sucked, skip "Sleepy Hollow." Otherwise, go
simply for the brilliance of Depp's performance and be
ready to watch a lot of heads roll.
