# Top honors go to poignant Lebanese survival story

I hope people get to see this movie. The thing is,
"West Beirut" is only guaranteed to be playing at
the Opera Plaza Cinemas through today. If Land
mark Cinemas' powers-that-be decide today that it
isn't making enough money, it will be replaced. And we
all know subtitled foreign films aren't the biggest turn-

It would be a shame
— "West Beirut" is the
first offering from Ziad
Doueiri, and it is an ex
cellent wartime drama.
Doueiri, a former cam
eraman for Quentin
Tarantino, vividly

brings to the screen the life of the Noueiri family in
West Beirut during the mid-1970s outbreak of civil war
in Lebanon.
Rami Doueiri, the director's teenage brother, turns
in a powerful performance as Tarek Noueiri. He pulls
off two tough war-time acts — the processes of coming
of age and of falling in love for the first time — very
well. He is complemented by Mohammad Chamas,
who plays Tarek's best friend, Omar.
Tarek's pre-war life is much like any of our early
teenage years. "West Beirut" has annoying neighbors
and their pets, stifling teachers, intriguing girls and a
dominating sense of anticipation for all the "fun" that
is coming. Unfortunately for Tarek. the Muslims and
Christians of the Lebanese city start a 14-year war in his
neighborhood circa 1975.

The playful re
lationship with
Omar and
Tarek's peaceful
family life both
help to resist the
oppression of the
coming war. The
two boys are
making a movie
together, and
they bond over
peeping at
Omar's beautiful
new aunt-in-law.
Meanwhile,
Tarek seems to be
learning playfully
from his parents

Reeyad (Joseph Bou Nassar) and Hala (Carmen Leb
bos).
May, played by Rola al Amin, is the Christian neigh
bor Tarek falls for. She appears with the first rash of
bombs and comes with her own problems as a Christian
orphan living in the Muslim half of the city.
Cracks begin to form in Tarek's relationships as the
war presses down on the Lebanese. Hala has a hard
time dealing with motherly duties during the war —
while Reeyad staunchly refuses to leave his country.
Omar has to be won over by May, and Omar and
Tarek's movie can't be developed because the neigh-

borhood with the
film shop is lev
eled.
Ultimate
ly, "West Beirut"
is about survival.
The final images
include emotion
al scenes be
tween all five key
characters.
These moments,
while tinged with
sadness and
flooded with
tears, leave a
strong afterglow
of the wartime
survivor.

Doueiri brings the newsreel and 35mm look to the
film to punctuate the tragic feeling of war, and he does
so in a creative way, seemingly leaving his Tarantino
days far behind. His direction augments the stellar por
trayals by the cast, giving us the suffocation of Beirut's
Civil War.
"West Beirut" is a beautiful movie. See it this week
end if the Landmark executives let you. And if they
don't, drop what you're doing right now, and scramble
to San Francisco tonight. You definitely won't regret it.
