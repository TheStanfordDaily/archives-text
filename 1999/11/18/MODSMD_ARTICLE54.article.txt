## A 						'Far Out' trip back to the art of the hippie era 
### 
Hippies rejoice. The newest installation at the
SFMOM A revels in the creations of Bay Area
artists during the period following the Sum
mer of Love in the late '60s / early '70s. I will insult nei
ther those who were originally there, nor my contem
poraries who now revere those times much more than
myself, by trying to tell you what the exhibition signifies
in terms of cultural reference.
The pieces need no introduction, suffice to say that
on the opening day, museum employees walked around
videotaping the facial expressions of wide-eyed patrons
reacting with such nostalgic enthusiasm to the works on
display.
The majority of pieces are not simply art but rather
functional objects — such as doors, chairs, posters,
shoes and clothing — crafted with the idea of imbuing

the mundane with a
sense of creativity
and personality that
was theretofore
lacking in that peri
od.
Not accidental
ly, many of the ob
jects look remark
ably similar to their
traditional counter
parts, though with a
hint of hallucino
genic influence. For
example, Michael
Cooper's intricately
ornate "Captain's

Far Out: Bay Area Design, 1967-1973
SFMOMA
351 Third St.
San Francisco
Through Feb. 20
(415)357-4000

Chair," which
is on loan from
the Salvador
Dali Museum,
has swirling
armrests and
appendages.

The numerous, now easily recognizable concert
poster designs for such bands as The Byrds, The Grate
ful Dead and Big Brother and the Holding Company
likewise take no small amount of influence from an
acid-addled perspective. They hearken back both in
style and function to the art nouveau period of litho
graphic theater poster advertisements from the turn of
the century.
The art of craft-making is most commonly repre

sented in elaborate homemade jewelry. In particular,
the stand-outs were: necklaces and metal medallions
that transform into smoking pipes; Alex and Lee's pen
dants of vaginas, dragon wings and scarab beetles; and
the flying eyeball necklace by Kathy Lerner, custom
made with five of the teeth from the drummer of Jef
ferson Airplane.
Also present is Wavy Gravy's legendary jumpsuit
teeming with Disney characters made by Jahanava
Romney. And Mary Ann Schildknecht has a vibrantly
colorful sweater incorporating frogs, castles and the
face of Jimi Hendrix with her newfound embroidery
skills taught to her by nuns while incarcerated in Spain
for smuggling hash.
The centerpieces of the exhibit further include Janis
Joplin's hand-painted Porsche 356 C, A1 Garney's

beautiful wood and
stained glass "Dutch
Door" and Lotus
Carnation's self-ex
planatory "The
Throne."
This exhibit is sim
ply great fun. It will
have you severely
tempted to ignore the
obligatory "Please do
not touch" signs and
strut around in that
burlap jacket you've
always wanted.
