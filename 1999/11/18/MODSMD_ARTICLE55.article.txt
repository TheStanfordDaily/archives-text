and textures. The
walls of the first
room are covered
with abstract de
signs created
from simple

shapes. Kahn has used the circle in many different
ways, transforming this basic shape into many
unique pieces. The shading on one piece gives the il
lusion of a light within the circle; others use textured
stripes to give the illusion of movement. One piece
looks like the Statue of Liberty; another is reminis
cent of the Jiffy Lube logo.
Continuing through the exhibit, one realizes the
extent of Kahn's versatility. Some of his unique cre
ations that can be found in one back room include
furniture, jewelry, stained glass and lighting.
Excerpts from his upcoming book, "Design, Soul
and Body," hang on one wall. Across the room are

examples of his architectural design work. The cen
ter of the room contains a bound volume of his
sketches. Hanging from the back wall are wooden
shapes with stripes stained into the wood.
One of the back rooms has a distinctly interna
tional flavor. Staring at the visitor upon entry are
two large gorillas made from circles similar to the
ones in the main room. Near them stands a tribal
looking totem pole. Along the side wall are hand
woven tapestries, some of which appear African,
others Asian. Nearby, black and orange designs re
sembling Jack O'Lanterns eerily gaze out over
drawings of skulls mounted on poles. Other areas
have a more Jewish flavor with menorahs and He
brew letters.
Looking around, one sees so many different
worlds all within the same exhibit. Kahn has clearly
been active during his long tenure at Stanford. On
Friday, Nov. 19, he will be giving a lecture entitled
"Cyclops: The Camera is not a Butterfly Net," at
5:30 p.m. in Annenberg Auditorium. A reception
will follow in the Art Gallery.
