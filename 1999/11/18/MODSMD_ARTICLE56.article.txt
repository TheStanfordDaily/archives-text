## Imagine you're having SEX... right now 
### Roxy Sass Staff writer 
As the quarter wears on and we move from the second round of midterms into finals,
have you noticed a flagging in your sexual drive? Do you ever feel emotionally numb?
Do you sometimes need to do something, anything, just to reassure yourself you're a
hot-blooded human?
If so, you are completely normal, and your condition is 100 percent reversible. Stress
and fatigue, which have by now reached epidemic proportions amongst Stanford stu
dents, are the leading causes of decreased libido. Other widespread depressants include
eating disorders, relationship problems, depression, excessive drinking and the use of a
wide array of drugs, including antidepressants and some forms of birth control.
You can add vibrancy to your end-of-quarter doldrums by fantasizing about sex. So
long as your fantasies don't disrupt your normal life, they will simply increase your heart
rate, improve your circulation, release feel-good endorphins into your bloodstream and
consequently enhance your immune system.
Indulging in erotic fantasy is perhaps the most satisfying thing you can do to rekindle
desire. T here are many societal taboos against imaginary sex, but fantasies are normal
and healthy. Basically, an erotic fantasy is any sexual encounter that occurs in your mind.
Fantasies can range from fleeting images to elaborate scenarios. You can conjure them
solely from your imagination, or you can rely on erotic literature, videos, photographs
and Web sites.
And fantasies aren't reserved for singles. They can keep the sexual aspect of a rela
tionship fresh and exciting, especially when partners act out each other's secret desires.
Of course, if you envision your lover as someone else, he or she might be upset. Alter
natively, your lover could take the opportunity to play dress-up.
Fantasies can include actions that you wouldn't perform in real life. Many healthy
people fantasi/.e about forcing or being forced by someone to have sex. Other common
fantasies involve sadomasochism, bondage, domination and bestiality. Most of us would
probably be arrested if we acted out our fantasies. This is why they are fantasies.
Your fantasies are one of the few things that you can possess entirely. They will make
you happy and teach you about your sexual self. You never have to tell anyone about
the darker things that turn you on, though you may someday be surprised to discover
that your partner shares your "perversions."
You can fantasize anywhere at anytime. In private, you can combine your mental di
versions with masturbation, which releases tension, relieves stress and just feels good.
You can also revive your libido through overall healthy behavior. Get a good night's
sleep, tat a well rounded diet. Exercise regularly. And try to reduce daily stress. When
you're healthy you have energy, and your body will expend some of that energy to make
you feel sexy.
Unfortunately, many people turn to aphrodisiacs to reinvigorate their sexuality.
Most substances do nothing, but some, such as Spanish fly, cause great harm. The most
popular aphrodisiac is alcohol. In small quantities it reduces anxiety, and combined with
a party atmosphere it can enfiame desire.
In all cases, alcohol lowers inhibitions, and consequently it is a dangerous treatment.
Alcohol encourages you to want and have sexual experiences you previously only sub
consciously craved. However, when you find yourself in desirable situations, it hinders
your performance. Alcohol is a depressant, and in excessive quantities it actually de
creases desire.
Unless you have a medical problem, you are your own best cure fora waning libido.
Make an effort to have absolutely phenomenal mental sex. Your mind is your most po
tent aphrodisiac and your most important sexual organ. Not only is it self-stimulating, it
can invigorate your entire body and your life. Your imagination is a never-expiring tick
et to have consequence-free sex with anyone at anytime anywhere. It would be a shame
to let such an opportunity go to waste.
