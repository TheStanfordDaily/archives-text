# Corporate flunkies and vegetarians do not mix!!!

Earlier this week your two lovely food columnists were up in San Fran
cisco "on business" — testing out our resumes on several "very rep
utable" consulting and investment banking firms, just like every red
blooded Stanford student who knows what's good for them does at this time
of year.
The expedition led us to the inevitable schmoozing and corporate din
ners. One firm in particular — no names, no lawsuits — thought it a good

idea to invite us to dinner at "Herbi
vore: The Earthly Grill," a restaurant
in the trendy part of San Francisco's
Mission District.
This crowded restaurant
serves hearty California vegan cuisine
prepared using mostly organic ingre
dients in a welcoming open-kitchen

setting. Entree options include red curry vegetables, baked falafel, various
pastas, Kung Pao "chicken" and of course the übiquitous veggie burger. Bev
erages ranged from fruit and vegetable juices to sparkling waters, organic
coffee, beer and wine.
When we first walked past a small section of patio dining into the bustling
and warmly lit place, we noticed an eclectic decor whose only overarching
theme was presumably "earthy chic." While most of the tables were tall af
fairs for two placed along the walls, we were seated at an oblique red table
for six in the middle of the place.
Surrounding us as we pored over the menu were friendly waiters, lively
conversations and dramatic fruit and vegetable photos, blown up and framed
all along the room. Despite all these distractions, we made our dining choic
es.
First up was a carrot-apple-ginger juice and a chocolate cupcake. We im
mediately noticed the tasteful dessert presentation: the cupcake was deli
cately prepared with rich icing and garnished with fresh mint and grapefruit
slices. The carrot drink was a plainer affair, just juice in a glass, but oh, the
tastations! The mixture of apple and ginger lent an atypical lightness and
sweetness to the carrot flavor, making fora very healthy and delicious drink.
As for the entrees, your faithful columnists had the Seitan Shawerma (a
Mediterranean dish usually made of lamb), and a Portobello sandwich, both
with salad and seasoned potatoes. One of the executive cohorts, "Nick," had
linguine and roasted vegetables with marinara sauce and garlic bread. The
other, "Sarah," had already lunched too heavily on some under-qualified re
cruits to have a full dinner. Instead, she satiated her pallet with a pesto-toast
with-sun-dried-tomato appetizer.
The Portobello mushroom sandwich, made with grilled mushrooms, sun
dried tomatoes, pesto and olive oil on a French roll, rocked our taste buds. It
had a harmonious blend of ingredients that the pesto toast appetizer lacked.
The shawerma, although thoughtfully prepared, was a bit more lackluster.
The wrap had the expected ingredients, but the taste was a little understated
and the tortilla a bit too dry. "Nick" insisted that while the linguine itself was
nothing spectacular, the roasted vegetables were superb.
To end the meal as we began it, we had another carrot-dessert combina
tion, opting fora slice of carrot cake over the cookies, brownies, German
chocolate cake and fruit pies also offered at Herbivore. And the closing se
lections proved just as satisfying as the opening ones! Again, the presenta
tion was tasteful, and the cake was simply delicious.
When the bill arrived, we were pleasantly surprised at the cost of the meal.
Each entrde, complete with hearty sides, was only between $6 to 8. The only
indulgences were the desserts and juice, about $3.50 apiece but well worth it.
The only thing that bummed us out was our recruiters' extended trip to the
restroom to wash their hands while the bill arrived and was paid.
All in all, we were won over by Herbivore's dimly lit, warm ambiance and
friendly service, but not by the corporate tools who accompanied us that
evening. While we give Herbivore "two green thumbs up," we don't recom
mend the consultant career route for everyone; we'd rather travel the path
with less grovel.
