### 
CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin
Islands (AP) — Hurricane Lenny's
winds climbed to 150 mph Wednes
day after its leading gusts and rains
ripped off roofs, hurled boats onto
shore and flooded homes in
Caribbean islands as it roared
toward the Virgin Islands.
St. Croix and the Virgin Islands
were expected to bear the brunt of
the storm's fury. Officials warned
that the storm could spawn torna
does and drench the islands with up
to 15-inches' of rain.
"My yard is completely flooded
out, the telephone lines are
whistling and the rain is beating
against the house," said Anthony
Lewis of Frederiksted, St. Croix's
second-largest town. I le said he
spent the morning bailing water out
of his house.
Hundreds of tourists in the
region were stranded as airlines
canceled flights and airports closed.
Feeding off the warm Caribbean
waters, Lenny's winds strengthened
to 150 mph Wednesday, making it a
Category 4 hurricane capable of
extreme damage. That is 5 mph
short of a Category 5 — the highest.
The storm was about 35 miles
southeast of St. Croix late Wednes
day afternoon, heading northeast at

9 mph. Hurricane winds extended
70 miles from its center and tropical
storm-force winds another 205
miles.
Lenny's lateness in the season
and easterly path left even experi
enced observers agape. "It's
unheard of," said veteran meteorol
ogist John Toohey cm San Juan's
WOSO-AM radio. "This is a once
in-a-lifetime event."
The storm's first winds cut power
and telephone service to many St.
Croix homes. It ripped up trees and
debris that blocked roads, kicked
up dangerous waves that battered
the shore and carried a steady rain
that flooded extensive areas hours
before the main impact was expect
ed.
"All through the night the police
were busy helping evacuate a num
ber of individuals who sought assis
tance after their mobile homes and
homes in low-lying areas became
threatened by flood waters," said
police chief Novell Francis.
Battering waves smashed over
the 8-foot sea wall at Frederiksted,
tore away the wooden fishermen's
pier and a small part of the concrete
Ann Abramson Pier where cruise
ships dock.
A curious tourist who went out

to experience the force of the
storm was trapped by battering
waves and clung to a rock outside a
beach resort for more than an hour
before divers rescued him. authori
ties said.
A half dozen people suffered
fractures and other injuries when
they were hit by waves on St. Kitts"
concrete pier. Storm surges in
Grenada swept away four houses,
washed away asphalt roads, dam
aged runway lights at the airport
and flooded roads and the business
district.
U.S. Virgin Islands Ciov. Charles
Turnbull declared a state of emer
gency Tuesday night, installed a
curfew to prevent looting and
deployed the National Guard. He
also asked President Clinton to
declare St. Croix a disaster area,
making it eligible for federal emer
gency funds.
In San Juan, the Puerto Rican
capital, a few motorists sped down
highways usually choked with traf
fic and tooted their horns in delight
after the storm passed.
Officials urged people to be vigi
lant. since most hurricane deaths
occur after a storm passes. " These
rains can produce life-threatening
flash floods and mud slides," the

National Weather Service warned.
There was one fatality: a man
who fell off a ladder he was using to
board up windows against the
storm.
On Tuesday, Lenny passed
south of Haiti and the Dominican
Republic, staying on an unusual
west-to-east course. It then veered
northeast, sparking a last-minute
rush at grocery stores and gas sta
tions throughout the islands in its
path.
Lenny was blamed for damage
as far off as South America.
In Colombia, police said two
fishermen drowned Tuesday in
heavy rain and strong winds from
the passing storm, and rain
destroyed half the homes in the
coastal town of Cabo de la Vela,
leaving 540 people homeless. Lenny
smashed up boats off the Venezue
lan coast.
Hurricane warnings were in
effect for St. Martin, Anguilla, St.
Kitts and Nevis, Montserrat, St.
Harts. Saba, St. Eustatius and
Antigua and Barbuda. Queen Beat
rix of the Netherlands, who is visit
ing the Dutch Antilles, canceled a
trip planned Thursday to St.
Maarten. which also is under a hur
ricane warning.
