# Bradley stands by Medicaid cuts
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Up
against a daily assault by Al Gore,
Bill Bradley stood by his plan to
eliminate Medicaid and accused the
vice president Wednesday of play
ing politics with a broken system
that stigmatizes the poor and
minorities. "He's wrong," Bradley
said.
In sober tones, the former bas
ketball star described his presiden
tial racc as "the ultimate game" and
issued his sharpest and most
detailed defense of his $65 billion
health care plan.
Bradley, in an interview with
The Associated Press, also eyed
corporate tax loopholes as ripe for
closing — "There are quite a lot
there," he noted — and said politi
cians must start evaluating them
each year "like any other spending
program."
He also said he opposes sports
betting "because I don't think ath
letes should be roulette chips." But
Bradley, who represented New Jer
sey and its Atlantic City casinos dur
ing 18 years in the Senate, declined
to condemn all gambling.
"I buy a lottery ticket every now
and then." he chuckled.
His reading glasses propped low
on his nose, Bradley responded to
Gore's escalating charges that Lati
nos. blacks and AIDS patients
would be devastated by the loss of
Medicaid.

"He's wrong. He's defending
something that needs to be
improved," said Bradley, who
would give low-income Americans
subsidies to buy health insurance in
the private market or from the Fed
eral Employees Health Benefits
Program.
This week alone. Gore gave an
interview on Spanish-language
radio, conducted an Internet chat
with women and placed ads on black
radio stations to spread the word
that minorities and other groups
who disproportionately rely on
Medicaid might not be able to buy
insurance with the capped amount
of subsidy in Bradley's plan.
"What you're seeing is con
stituency politics on the other side,"
Bradley said.
"I mean you know, just go down
this group, that group, that group,
that group — try to get that group
against this group and this group
against that — not looking at the
whole. And the whole is that people
would be better off if those who
were uninsured had a chance to be a
part of the federal system."
Bradley spoke to AP reporters
and editors from his aides' typed
page of "talking points," on which
he had jammed the margins with his
own tight scrawl. He reeled off poli
cy minutiae with mastery.
"Medicaid stigmatizes and says,
if you're poor, you just got that. You

can't join this other system. You've
got to have this separate thing,"
Bradley said. Medicaid covers a
small fraction of the poor and
patients often don't have primary
care physicians, hut are forced to
rely on hospital emergency rooms,
he noted.
Bradley suggested that his rival's
critique hurt most because it deni
grated Bradley's "deep and Icing
standing commitment" to" helping
minorities and the poor.
"It's sad that (Gore) would not
respect that," Bradley said.
In reply. Gore spokesman Chris
Tehane ticked down a list: minori
ties, the poor, the disabled, senior
citizens and those who are HIV-pos
itive.
"Each one of those groups would
be disproportionately impacted and
left out in the cold if Senator
Bradley's health care plan was ever
enacted," Lehane said.
Before racing to Atlanta's pre
dominantly black Morehouse Medi
cal School fora discussion of his
health and poverty initiatives,
Bradley also made these points:
His use of corporate jets is
"completely legal, acceptable and
fully reported" and not incompati
ble with his call to eliminate the
political influence of big-money spe
cial interests.
— He gave a tentative thumbs
up to the Clinton administration's

deal to support China's membership
in the World Trade Organization,
despite fierce opposition from orga
nized labor. "From what I read in
the newspaper, it sounds like some
thing I would support."
He "stays in touch" with the
Teamsters and United Auto Work
ers. two unions who opted out of the
AFL-ClO's endorsement of Gore
last month, to "encourage them to
remain neutral" in the Democratic
primaries.
— Defense spending should be
restructured, rather than increased,
to get rid of Cold War relics, such as
heavy tanks.
— After years of playing down
his basketball feats, Bradley recruit
ed fellow NBA stars fora $1.5 mil
lion campaign fund-raiser last week
end because, "When you're in the
ultimate game, the ultimate compe
tition. you want your friends with
you."
— Asked about potential
Reform Party candidate Donald
Trump and his criticism of
Bradley's record on tax reform,
Bradley said the casino magnate's
"animus" might be motivated by
the pair's differences on legalized
sports betting.
At the prospect of debating
Trump during next year's general
election, Bradley folded his hands as
if in prayer and aimed a smiling
glance skvward.
