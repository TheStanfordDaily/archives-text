How to Become the Tree,
Mascot of Stanford University
Some colleges have mascots. Stanford University has the Stanford
Tree. Are you up to the challenge?
1. Suffer some sort of extraordinary reversal of fortune as a child that *
results in erratic brain-wave patterns, such as crashing your bicycle into a baseball
backstop so hard that aluminum fragments bccoine implanted in your molars.
2. Run for Tree in the spring. Emerge, naked, from a maple-syrup-filled coffin in the
middle of campus. Break into the clock tower; slc.'p in 15-minute intervals. Arrange
a trapeze system allowing you to swing from one side of the quad to the other. Pass
out in the dean's office during a disciplinary session for self-immolation in the stu
dent union.
3. Accept the position of Tree during a ceremony so secret and sacred that it makes the
Masons look like tailgaters.
4. Build your own Tree costume over the summer. This is your chance to put your own
stamp on Tree lore. Become feverish and rant deliriously about how it's time to
shake things up, the conservative alumni be damned. Create a palm.
5. Put a Stones mouth on it. Give it a nose ring and a chain, and sunglasses. Buy
enough duct tape to handle any potential crisis.
6. Train for Treedom. Hire a choreographer away from the gymnastics team; begin
grueling two-a-day sessions. Prepare to lose 8 to 12 pounds per game, despite drink
ing water heavily, and to pull your left hamstring so many times you'll lose count.
7. Prepare for the Big Game. Expect a mass of bureaucracy to dog your every arboreal
step, trying to limit your explosive (and, if the Big Game Committee is to be
believed, riot-inciting) dance moves to a 3-foot-square patch of turf somewhere in
Mountain View.
8. Enjoy a triumphant Rose Bowl appearance after crushing the Cal weenies.
4c r '>*
An excellent way to confound Big Game Committee watchdogs is to stagger to the
mandatory pre-game Breathalyzer test and fall directly on your face while mum
bling something about "Tequila - 'cuz it's ta kill ya!" and laughing inanely. Blow a
flat .00 and then stagger away.

Laugh off an invitation to attend Stanford; enroll at Cal.
Check your height. You must be shorter than 5-foot-8 to fit in the costume.
Slouching won't help.
Understand that the top-secret. Star Chamber-like Oski Committee chooses each
year's Oski through an ancient, hallowed process which can best be summed up as,
"Hmm - now there's a chipper young lad endowed with many noble attributes; let's
ask him."
Adopt "Go Bears!" as a form of greeting and farewell Oski is bursting with Cal
pride.
Perform random acts of selfless generosity. Oski receives no money, no reward and
no sports cars from athletic boostr-s for his efforts, and desires none.
Love little kids, because little kids love Oski.
Find ways to show your high level of forbearance, your Job-like threshold for suf
fering. Oski spends long hours as a sweat-drenched, uncomfortable, itchy ursa major
who still is as amiable as your favorite uncle after a couple of bourbons.
Think cuddly. "Oski is a big, friendly teddy bear, basically," notes our secret Oski
Committee member. Except, of course, when the need arises to bring down a certain
arboreal miscreant....
Don't get carried away in your efforts to raise your profile. Brashness is the Stanford
Tree. Hyperactivity is the Stanford Tree. Certifiable lunacy is the Stanford Tree (see
"How to Become the Tree, Mascot of Stanford University").
