Dear Stanford and Berkeley Campus Communities and Friends,
The 102 nd Big Game is nearly upon us. Kickoff on November 20
will continue one of the oldest, most storied traditions in the
Bay Area. Our two great universities have a rich heritage on
the football field and, more important, in classrooms and labo
ratories. Our institutions and faculty-separately, jointly and in
partnerships with other organizations in the Bay Area â€”have
helped to create one of the most dynamic regions in the
nation.
This year, Big Game will be played at Stanford Stadium. Our
goal for Big Game is that it be well played on the field and
enjoyable for all who attend.
It is indeed unfortunate that in the past few years the spirit of
Big Game has been tarnished by irresponsible behavior of a
few that has led to melee and property damage.
Because those attending the game should not have to fear for
their safety, we wish to be very clear that anyone who
engages in incidents of physical assault or serious property
damage will be ejected from the game. Students found
responsible for such actions face disciplinary action at their
respective campuses, which could include suspension or dis
missal.
This, and every Big Game should be a worthy reflection of a
century of tradition, and we invite all who attend to express,
their school spirit, pride, and sportsmanship by celebrating in a
safe, positive and friendly manner.
Sincerely,
Robert Berdahl
Chancellor
University of California at Berkeley
