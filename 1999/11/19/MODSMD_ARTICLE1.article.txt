Editor's Note: This article on
Stanford alumni William Hewlett
and David Packard is the second in a
series of articles detailing the top five
Stanford individuals of the century
who have left a lasting legacy at the
University and the surrounding com
munity.
Hewlett and Packard, who share
the fourth spot, have placed Stanford
in the spotlight with the success of
their joint venture in Hewlett-
Packard. They have also financially
contributed to the institution, where
tliey both earned their bachelor's mid
master's degrees mid where they
began to develop some of their origi
nal technology, which later spurred
the growth of the Silicon Valley.
The two funded the new Science
and Engineering Quad with their
1994 donation of $77.4 million

There are lew partnerships that
are better known than the Stanford
alumni team of William I lewlett and
David Packard. The two men revo
lutionized the computer industry
and, in many ways, began the high
tech reputation of Silicon Valley
with their company, Hewlett-
Packard.
The company produces comput
er and measurement systems used in

industry, business, engineering, sci
ence. medicine and education.
But beyond the lame they have
acquired and the immense fortune
they amassed, I lewlett and Packard
are unquestionably two of the na
tion's most generous philan
thropists. Both the Hewlett and the
Packard foundations are widely
known as two of the nation's most
influential and supportive.
Often referred to as Stanford's
most famous alumni. Hewlett and

ed the University to an unmatched
degree. Together, they have given
the school more than $300 million,
which has funded numerous build
ings, labs, pieces of equipment and
most recently, the Science and Engi
neering Quad.
"There are no individuals who
have contributed more to Stanford,
and especially to the School of Engi
neering, over the past 50 years than
Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard,"
said Dean of the School of Engi
neering James Plummcr.
Their background
Hewlett and Packard met at Stan
ford, where in 1934, they both re
ceived bachelor's of arts degrees.
While at Stanford, Packard ran track
and played varsity basketball and
varsity football, participating in
three Rose Bowls. Hewlett spent a
great deal of his time in the libraries.
After graduating from Stanford,
Hewlett received a master's degree
in electrical engineering from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy in 1936. Packard spent 1936 to
1938 as an engineer with the Gener
al Electric Co. in Schenectady, N.Y.

In 1939, both men received mas
ter's degrees in engineering at Stan
ford, and that same year, they
formed their famous partnership
with the encouragement of their
professor, friend and mentor, Fred
erick Terman.
The first company "plant" was lo
cated in a garage in Palo Alto, the
city in which the company remains
headquartered. Their initial capital
totaled a whopping $538. This
garage, now somewhat of a histori
cal spot, is often referred to as the
birthplace of Silicon Valley.
Their first product was an audio
oscillator originally developed by
Hewlett as an engineering master's
student, and within the first 30 years
of its existence, the company grew to
become the world's largest producer
of electronic measuring devices and
Palo Alto's largest employer.
Contributions to Stanford
Over the years, Hewlett and
Packard have garnered numerous
awards. They have received many
lifetime achievement awards, were
named 1973's Industrialists of the
year, were given the 1988 Medal of
Freedom and were awarded Price
Waterhouse Information Technolo
gy Leadership Awards.
The extraordinary amount of

support they have given to Stanford
led to their receiving the "Degree of
Uncommon Men" honor.
University President Gerhard
Casper wrote in 1998 that Hewlett
and Packard "have been among our
staunchest friends and supporters
for a period that extends over almost
two-thirds of the University's exis
tence."
In 1994 the two men gave Stan
ford $77.4 million to fund the build
ing of the Science and Engineering
Quad, which opened at the begin
ning of this year. Until last month,
when entrepreneur Jim Clark do
nated $150 million to Stanford's
BioX program, this was the largest
gift in Stanford's history.
Another noteworthy contribu
tion was the $25 million they gave to
endow the Terman Fellow's pro
gram, which provides grants to
promising young faculty members in
science and engineering fields.
In response to this gift, former
Provost and current Political Sci
ence Prof. Condoleezza Rice said.
"David and Bill are unbelievable in
their love for Stanford, and also for
their sensitivity to academic issues
and their leadership in the science
and engineering enterprise."
In 1986 Packard and his wife
pledged $70 million to create what is
now the Lucile Packard Children's

Hospital. Packard was also largely
responsible for financing Maples
Pavilion. Packard, who had strong
athletic lies to Stanford as well, con
tributed to the construction of
deGuerre Pool, the Terman Engi
neering Center and the Ford Center
along with Hewlett.

the Beckman Laser Institute &
Medical Clinic.
In 1964 Packard founded the
David and Lucile Packard Founda
tion, and until his death, he was the
president and chairman. The foun
dation supports a number of univer
sities, national institutions, commu
nity groups, youth agencies, family
planning centers and hospitals.
The Monterey Bay Aquarium
was in many ways made possible by
Packard, whose foundation gave $55
million to establish it. Packard was
chairman of the Monterey Bay
Aquarium Foundation and chair
man and president of the Monterey
Bay Aquarium Research Institute.
Their legacy
The leadership and generosity of
Hewlett and Packard are un
matched in Stanford history.
" Their contributions to Stanford
— of time, talent and candor, as well
as money — have touched nearly
every part of our academic endeav
or, nourishing and replenishing us
year after year," Casper wrote in
1998. "They have, indeed, had their
part in continuing the Stanford her
itage."
Founders of Silicon Valley, extra
ordinary philanthropists and
providers of numerous Stanford fa
cilities, Hewlett and Packard are
truly two of the most amazing men in
Stanford history.
John Ford, Stanford's vice presi
dent of development, said in an in
terview with the Palo Alto Weekly
in 1998:
"The Hewletts and the PackardS
are right behind Leland and Jane
Stanford in terms of having an im
pact on the University through their
philanthropy," he said.
Plummer also commented on
Hewlett and Packard's legacy.
"They have created close connec
tions between alumni, industry and
Stanford."

Their legacy
The leadership and generosity of
Hewlett and Packard are un
matched in Stanford history.
" Their contributions to Stanford
— of time, talent and candor, as well
as money — have touched nearly
every part of our academic endeav
or, nourishing and replenishing us
year after year," Casper wrote in
1998. "They have, indeed, had their
part in continuing the Stanford her

Founders of Silicon Valley, extra
ordinary philanthropists and
providers of numerous Stanford fa
cilities, Hewlett and Packard are
truly two of the most amazing men in
Stanford history.
John Ford, Stanford's vice presi

in 1998:
"The Hewletts and the PackardS
are right behind Leland and Jane
Stanford in terms of having an im

Editor's Note: This article on
Stanford alumni William Hewlett
and David Packard is the second in a
series of articles detailing the top five
Stanford individuals of the century
who have left a lasting legacy at the
University and the surrounding com
munity.
Hewlett and Packard, who share
the fourth spot, have placed Stanford
in the spotlight with the success of
their joint venture in Hewlett-
Packard. They have also financially
contributed to the institution, where
tliey both earned their bachelor's mid
master's degrees mid where they
began to develop some of their origi
nal technology, which later spurred
the growth of the Silicon Valley.
The two funded the new Science
and Engineering Quad with their
1994 donation of $77.4 million

There are lew partnerships that
are better known than the Stanford
alumni team of William I lewlett and
David Packard. The two men revo
lutionized the computer industry
and, in many ways, began the high
tech reputation of Silicon Valley
with their company, Hewlett-
Packard.
The company produces comput
er and measurement systems used in

industry, business, engineering, sci
ence. medicine and education.
But beyond the lame they have
acquired and the immense fortune
they amassed, I lewlett and Packard
are unquestionably two of the na
tion's most generous philan
thropists. Both the Hewlett and the
Packard foundations are widely
known as two of the nation's most
influential and supportive.
Often referred to as Stanford's
most famous alumni. Hewlett and

ed the University to an unmatched
degree. Together, they have given
the school more than $300 million,
which has funded numerous build
ings, labs, pieces of equipment and
most recently, the Science and Engi
neering Quad.
"There are no individuals who
have contributed more to Stanford,
and especially to the School of Engi
neering, over the past 50 years than
Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard,"
said Dean of the School of Engi
neering James Plummcr.
Their background
Hewlett and Packard met at Stan
ford, where in 1934, they both re
ceived bachelor's of arts degrees.
While at Stanford, Packard ran track
and played varsity basketball and
varsity football, participating in
three Rose Bowls. Hewlett spent a
great deal of his time in the libraries.
After graduating from Stanford,
Hewlett received a master's degree
in electrical engineering from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy in 1936. Packard spent 1936 to
1938 as an engineer with the Gener
al Electric Co. in Schenectady, N.Y.

In 1939, both men received mas
ter's degrees in engineering at Stan
ford, and that same year, they
formed their famous partnership
with the encouragement of their
professor, friend and mentor, Fred
erick Terman.
The first company "plant" was lo
cated in a garage in Palo Alto, the
city in which the company remains
headquartered. Their initial capital
totaled a whopping $538. This
garage, now somewhat of a histori
cal spot, is often referred to as the
birthplace of Silicon Valley.
Their first product was an audio
oscillator originally developed by
Hewlett as an engineering master's
student, and within the first 30 years
of its existence, the company grew to
become the world's largest producer
of electronic measuring devices and
Palo Alto's largest employer.
Contributions to Stanford
Over the years, Hewlett and
Packard have garnered numerous
awards. They have received many
lifetime achievement awards, were
named 1973's Industrialists of the
year, were given the 1988 Medal of
Freedom and were awarded Price
Waterhouse Information Technolo
gy Leadership Awards.
The extraordinary amount of

support they have given to Stanford
led to their receiving the "Degree of
Uncommon Men" honor.
University President Gerhard
Casper wrote in 1998 that Hewlett
and Packard "have been among our
staunchest friends and supporters
for a period that extends over almost
two-thirds of the University's exis
tence."
In 1994 the two men gave Stan
ford $77.4 million to fund the build
ing of the Science and Engineering
Quad, which opened at the begin
ning of this year. Until last month,
when entrepreneur Jim Clark do
nated $150 million to Stanford's
BioX program, this was the largest
gift in Stanford's history.
Another noteworthy contribu
tion was the $25 million they gave to
endow the Terman Fellow's pro
gram, which provides grants to
promising young faculty members in
science and engineering fields.
In response to this gift, former
Provost and current Political Sci
ence Prof. Condoleezza Rice said.
"David and Bill are unbelievable in
their love for Stanford, and also for
their sensitivity to academic issues
and their leadership in the science
and engineering enterprise."
In 1986 Packard and his wife
pledged $70 million to create what is
now the Lucile Packard Children's

Hospital. Packard was also largely
responsible for financing Maples
Pavilion. Packard, who had strong
athletic lies to Stanford as well, con
tributed to the construction of
deGuerre Pool, the Terman Engi
neering Center and the Ford Center
along with Hewlett.
Hewlett's history
Hewlett served in World War II
as an army officer and was the staff
member of the Army's Chief Signal

then became vice chairman of the
HP board of directors. In 1987, he
was named director emeritus.
I lis own company is not the only
place where Hewlett has exhibited
leadership in electronics. He served
on the Board of Radio Engineers
from 1950 to 1957 and played a role
in the development of what is now

the American Electronics Associa
tion.
Hewlett was a trustee of Mills
College in Oakland, Calif., from
1958 to 1968 and a Stanford trustee
from 1963 to 1974. He was a member
of the San Francisco regional panel
of the Commission on White House
Fellows from 1969 to 1970.
From 1956 to 1958 he served as
president of what is now the Stan
ford Medical Center's board, and

Achievement award.
He is an honorary trustee of the
California Academy of Sciences, a
trustee emeritus of the Carnegie In
stitute, a member of the National
Academy of Engineering and the
National Academy of Sciences and a
fellow of the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences.
The William and Flora Hewlett

1994, when he became a chairman
emeritus. This foundation has an en
dowment that gives out $40 million
annually in assorted grants.

in 1983, was as equally distinguished
as his friend and partner. From the
founding of the company in 1939
until 1947. he was a partner of HP.

In response to this gift, former
Provost and current Political Sci
ence Prof. Condoleezza Rice said.
"David and Bill are unbelievable in
their love for Stanford, and also for
their sensitivity to academic issues
and their leadership in the science
and engineering enterprise."
In 1986 Packard and his wife
pledged $70 million to create what is
now the Lucile Packard Children's

Their legacy
The leadership and generosity of
Hewlett and Packard are un
matched in Stanford history.
" Their contributions to Stanford
— of time, talent and candor, as well
as money — have touched nearly
every part of our academic endeav
or, nourishing and replenishing us
year after year," Casper wrote in
1998. "They have, indeed, had their
part in continuing the Stanford her
itage."
Founders of Silicon Valley, extra
ordinary philanthropists and
providers of numerous Stanford fa
cilities, Hewlett and Packard are
truly two of the most amazing men in
Stanford history.
John Ford, Stanford's vice presi
dent of development, said in an in
terview with the Palo Alto Weekly
in 1998:
"The Hewletts and the PackardS
are right behind Leland and Jane
Stanford in terms of having an im
pact on the University through their
philanthropy," he said.
Plummer also commented on
Hewlett and Packard's legacy.
"They have created close connec
tions between alumni, industry and
Stanford."
