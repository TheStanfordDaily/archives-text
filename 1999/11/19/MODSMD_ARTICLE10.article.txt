# Princeton University lowers its marks

The "A+" may soon be a grade of
the past. Several years after Stanford
tightened up its grading standards,
Princeton University is following suit.
Last month, a Princeton commit
tee presented findings from a 25-year
study of grade inflation at the Ivy
League school, and recommended
that the "A+" be abolished from the
grading scale.
According to an Oct. 7 article of
The Daily Princetonian, the report
also suggested a collaborative effort
among Ivy League institutions to ad
dress grade inflation issues.
While Stanford currently has no
plans to revise its grading policies,

former Faculty Senate Chair Gail
Mahood — who oversaw the last pe
riod of grading changes enacted by
the Faculty Senate in 1994 — under
stands why Princeton has made such
changes.
"This may put an end to the up
ward creep in grades," she said.
"Instead of using the 'A+' to re
ward the best student in five years, it
starts to be used every year."
The report found that at Princeton
the "A+" was most commonly given
in science and engineering courses,
which affects student rankings and
the selection of the valedictorian.
In fact, independent work lower
than a "B-" was "virtually impossible
to find." Instead of receiving an
"A+," Princeton students may now

receive an " 'A' with distinction" on
their transcripts.
The University will probably
spend four months evaluating the re
port, and if Princeton decides to re
move the "A+" from their grading
system, Stanford, as a peer institu
tion, could follow their example. But
professors aren't encouraging such a
change here.
"The big problem is grade infla
tion," said Political Science Prof.
Stephen Krasner. "When there is so
much variation in grades, standard
ized tests mean more and more."
Krasner also added that he wants
to keep using the "A+" as a way to
distinguish students who are out
standing.
"There are usually a small number

of students who should get' A+'s, and
I'm happy to make that distinction,"
he said. "Sometimes, I give three or
four 'A+'s in a class of 230 students."
Students also did not advocate a
change in the grading system.
"1 don't think doing away with
'A+'s would change grading; it would
just make it a different scale," said
Katie Young, a junior.
"In the grand scheme of things,
when you compare our GPAs to
other GPAs, it would be unfair," said
Jenny Hildner. a freshman.
Stanford's most recent grading
policy changes were made in 1994-95
when Mahood, chair of the Faculty
Senate, presented a report that sug
gested the drop and add deadlines be
changed.
