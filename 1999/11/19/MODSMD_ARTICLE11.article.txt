### Shannon M. Ashford Contributing writer 
Thirty years since its establish
ment as a center for community ser
vice, the Black Community Services
Center has expanded it mission to
focus on academic, social and cultur
al programming for African Ameri
cans at Stanford.
| All of these facets will he cele
brated tonight at 7 p.m. at the Facul
ty Club, when the Center celebrates
its 30th anniversary.
â€¢ Faculty, staff, students, alumni
and former staff of the Center were
invited to the celebration. Those in
vited will assemble to enjoy presen
tations, music and a dramatic perfor
mance. Undergraduate and gradu
ate students will participate in the
performance, re-enacting snippets of
the Black revolution at Stanford
through the years.
The center was first created as the
Black Volunteer Center. It was lo
cated in the Nitery and focused on
Community service in East Palo Alto.

"The impetus on public service at
Stanford was created in the Black
community," said Thom Massey,
Class of 1969, assistant dean of stu
dents in the Graduate Life Office
and resident fellow in Naranja.
The Center later became the
Black Activities Center, and it
housed more Black volunteer stu
dent organizations and pre-profes
sional organizations.
Many alumni and past faculty and
staff who were instrumental in the
Center's creation will give their re
flections on the history of the Black
Community Services Center. A se
nior will share aspects of current con
tributions of the Center.
"For the Black community, it's an
opportunity to pay tribute to the in
dividuals who were willing to go the
extra mile for the continued success
of African-American students at
Stanford," said Tina Gridiron, a sec
ond-year doctoral student in the
School of Education and a former
Black Community Services Center
staff member.

Additionally, past staff will re
ceive awards of recognition for their
service to both the Center and the
University.
"I think it's a real blessing that we
celebrate 30 years of Black empow
erment at Stanford," said Sean
Mcintosh, a sophomore. "Every
time I enter the Black House, I feel
the impact that the Center has on the
Stanford Black community and the
Stanford community at large."
Groups such as the Black Student
Union, the Black Graduate Students
Association and other Black volun
teer student organizations participat
ed in the planning of the 30th-an
niversary celebration.
"This center is a rich part of Stan
ford's history, and it should be
looked at as that, not just a part of
Black history at Stanford," said Jan
Barker-Alexander, director of the
center. "We should recognize that
everyone is here on the shoulders of
everyone who came before them.
But based on recent letters to The
Daily, it is sad that others don't rec

ognize that struggle."
Struggle was present at the cen
ter's conception.
"This center was created out of
protest," said Barker-Alexander.
"Funding came later on with more
protest, and eventually it became a
part of the University as a university
department, but funding is still an
issue."
In addition to the anniversary
program tonight, part of the year
long celebration of the Black
House's 30th anniversary also hap
pened during Alumni Reunion
Homecoming Weekend, when many
Black alumni returned to participate
in the Multicultural Hall of Fame In
duction, a block party and Reunion
Stanfunk, a performance musical.
"I hope that in the next 30 years,
we will have been able to expand on
the size of our facility but maintain
the character and history in it," said
Barker-Alexander. "I also hope that
we will no longer have to engage in
the mundane dialogue of why ethnic
centers should exist."
