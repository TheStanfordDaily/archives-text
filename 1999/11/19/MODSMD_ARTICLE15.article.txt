## At least 9 students dead in Texas A & M bonfire collapse 
### 
COLLEGE STATION. Texas
(AP) â€” A towering. 40-foot pyra
mid of logs erected for Texas
A&M's traditional football bonfire
trembled and then came roaring
down early Thursday, crushing at
least nine students to death and
injuring 2K others.
After an hours-long, campus
wide sweep, at least five students
were still unaccounted for. At least
three of the injured were in critical
condition and a wave of grief settled
over the campus of 43.1HK). some 90
miles northwest of Houston.
Rescuers used sensitive sound
detection equipment to listen for

moaning or tapping from the enor
mous pile of collapsed logs and
heard scratching noises that led them
to believe there were victims
trapped.
"We take it one log at a time."
said Kern Bennett, director of a state
rescue unit. "They're wired three
together in stacks, so we have to cut
the wire and move them one at a
time. So it's a lengthy process."
Shocked students gathered at the
scene, holding hands and praying
while the rescue went on. Workers
tapped on logs and ordered specta
tors to be still so they could hear if
anyone was still alive.

Officials had no explanation for
the collapse and said engineers
would examine the site.
Sixty to 70 students were on top
of the logs trying to build up the
stack up when it suddenly gave way.
University officials said.
Faculty adviser Rusty Thompson
said students told him there was no
hint of a problem until there was
"noise and chaos."
"There was just a sudden move
ment," he said. "Five to seven sec
onds and it was on the ground."
University president Ray Bowen
said six students were killed. Bennett
said he saw at least three more bod

ies in the wood pile.
The bonfire, meant to get stu
dents fired up for the football game
against archrival Texas, is a beloved
tradition at Texas A&M and attracts
tens of thousands of spectators.
Since the tradition began in 1909.
when the school was still an all-male
military academy, the bonfire has
been canceled only one other time:
in 1963, after President John F.
Kennedy's assassination.
Bowen said this year's bonfire
would be canceled and added he was
not sure if the bonfire would be per
manently abolished.
"It's a very important tradition to

us," he said, "but those decisions
must be made at a calmer time."
Although the project is run by
students, engineers and non-student
adults are always at the site, said
Thompson, the faculty adviser. The
students cut the logs to lengths of
about 10 feet and build the pile
themselves over several weeks.
Cranes and tractors lift the logs,
which are then tied together with
baling wire.
The structure, which this year
would have included about 7,000
logs and reached 55 feet, is designed
to twist inward and collapse on itself
as it burns.

The stack also collapsed in 1994,
hut no one was injured. A second
was built and ignited that year.
Both students and alumni have
strong opinions about the bonfire.
A group calling itself Aggies
Against Bonfire has called in the
past for the abolition of the annual
event, saying it wastes resources, pol
lutes the air and contributes to
dozens of injuries and alcohol-relat
ed arrests each year.
Dallas Cowboys assistant coach
Joe Avezzano, who was an assistant
coach at A&M during the 1980s, said
the ritual should go on. 'it is part of
the tradition and history," he said.
