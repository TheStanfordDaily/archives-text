Take time out to
cheer on the
Cardinal tomorrow

This is it, folks: arguably the
biggest Big Game to roll
around in decades. The bon
fires have burned, the Hand has
danced and the Axe Committee's
train whistle has blown and blown.
Now only a day remains before the
mighty Cardinal and the California
Golden Bears do battle on the foot
ball field.
The 1999 Big Game is quickly set
ting rtself up into a great story for
our grandkids. Over the years, Stan
ford hasn't been to the Rose Bowl
very often. The chance to play
archrival UC-Berkeley for the roses
is even rarer. And how often does a
new millenium roll around? The
Rose Bowl is not a bad way to spend
one's Y2K.
But when things start lining up
this perfectly, our cruel world is
bound to create some opposing
forces. After losing four years in a
row, the Bears are possibly due for a
win. And it would be perfect for
them to ruin us now, after we
destroyed their own bowl hopes in
last year's Big Game.
Statistically, Stanford has the
power to win this football game. But
with an intense, century-old rivalry
such as this one, you just can't
depend on the numbers. We'd only
be kidding (or jinxing) ourselves to
say that we're "wrapping up our
Rose Bowl berth" tomorrow. The
final outcome will only reveal itself
on the field. With so much 011 the
line for both sides, this may become
a test of will rather than of talent.
Just keep in mind that we can't

count our roses until they've
bloomed. And regardless of whether
we make it to the Rose Bowl, we are
tremendously proud of the Stanford
team that has already won a piece of
the Pac-10 championship and will
attend a howl game regardless of
tomorrow's outcome.
We do have the home-field advan
tage this year, which means a lot.
Think of quarterback Todd Husak,
who admitted to feeling the pressure
of the crowd in Seattle when we lost
to the Washington Huskies. Cal will
be starting with an inexperienced
quarterback tomorrow. We need to
fill the stadium to the brim with
Stanford fans and cheer louder than
we've ever cheered before.
Convince all of your friends to get
tickets for Big Game. If they claim
that they have too much schoolwork
to do. tell them to drop their books
for just one Saturday, for the love of
all that is sacred. At Stanford, the
Big Game has just as much tradi
tional significance as our academic
excellence. Any alumnus will tell
them that they'll remember cheering
in the stands far longer than they'll
remember sitting at home studying.
When you're out on the bleachers
(and later on the field), do your best
to act responsibly toward the Cal
fans. Put your energy into shouting
at the Cal football team rather than
taunting and pelting fruit at the
Weenies. If we fall, be dignified and
don't go tearing their heads off; just
remember that in the Big Game of
life, they are the less fortunate. If we
win, win with grace and steer clear of
the angry fans; you'll want to be
healthy for Thanksgiving and New
Year's Day.
We'll see you out in Stanford Sta
dium. Let's give 'em The Axe!
