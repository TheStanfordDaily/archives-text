## It's like a high school pep rally 
### 
So there are these
people out in White
Plaza; maybe you've
seen them. They have this
huge bull horn or some
thing that they've been
sounding every hour on
the hour for the past cou-

pie of days.
Now 1 was thinking: if 1 went out to
almost any other populated area in Ameri
ca and started making very loud and
obnoxious noises every hour for four days
straight — well I'm not sure exactly what
the consequences would be. but there'd be
trouble. But if you say, "Oh, it's for foot
ball!" — well then. "Please, stay up all
night and sound a bull horn." It's perfectly
natural.
According to Noam Chomsky, the pur
pose of football is to dull the brains of the
masses by offering them "something to pay
attention to that's of no importance. That
keeps them from worrying about things
that matter to their lives that they might
have some idea of doing something about."
I don't think that this is quite right,
though. For one thing, people in the upper
class seem to be almost as obsessed with
football as "the masses" are. So its prospec
tive audience is not as one-sided as Chom
sky seems to think. The fact is that people
truly like football independent of any pos
sible social utility it may have.
I've never been much of a sports person
myself, though. Until recently. I had always
sort of assumed that people got excited

about these games because like so many
mindless sheep they desperately wanted
some cause to attach themselves to since
they lacked anv real individualized sense of
self.
People are surprised by things such as
Zimbardo's prison experiment and are
always wondering how, for example, the
German people allowed the National
Socialists to commit such inhuman atroci
ties in the 1930s and 19405.
But it has always seemed to me that if
it's possible to get rational adults to paint
themselves red and to tear down goal posts
in rampaging mobs, causing serious bodily
injury to each other with a propaganda
mechanism as limited as a football rivalry,
then it's a pretty sure bet that after five
years of übiquitous Nazi propaganda, you
can get them killing Jews.
At least, that used to be my take on the
whole football phenomenon. Lately, how
ever, I think I've begun to understand a
little bit better what people like about
football and sports in general. 1 think
there are two main reasons why they're
captivating.
First, it's nice to see people that are
striving for excellence — people that are
dominated by a desire to perfect their
physical and mental being. In a world
where the ambitions and dreams of people
for the most part are slowly reduced to
nothing, it is somehow gratifying to see
people who are extremely good and
among the best at something, anything,
even if it is just running down a field with a

hall.
Of course, following this logic, people
would he as interested in piano recitals as
in football. However, I think people are
additionally attracted to football because
they have a primal desire for war. Only
they're afraid to actually have a war, which
would probably disturb all kinds of things
(like their commute to work or the survival
of their family). So instead, they pretend to
have wars by getting some men to "fight"
one another by playing football while they
watch, sometimes paying these men mil
lions of dollars.
In "A Brave New World," Aldus Hux
ley writes about an "anger therapy," which
involves exciting anger in subjects who then
release their emotions with loud screams.
The purpose of this "therapy" is to provide
a channel through which people's desire for
violence may be vented with minimal
destruction. This is exactly what football is
and what people like about it. It is vicarious
violence.
In the end, though, I suppose that like
all the other writers who have written
about the game this week, I want you to be
out there on Saturday screaming loudly. If
that's what it takes to keep you from think
ing dangerous or violent thoughts, then I'm
all for it. After all, there's nothing I like
more than a docile citizenry. Good Luck
Stanford. Beat Cal!
