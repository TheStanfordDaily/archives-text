# Rivalry extends off the playing field
## Big Game tradition spiced up with varied and creative pranks 
### Kara Bradford 
Al the start of Big Game season
this year, UC-Berkeley students
awoke to an integral part of Big
Game traditions: pranks. The water
in fountains at UC-Berkelely ran
red with Cardinal spirit, after Stan
ford students dumped red dye in the
main fountains.
Most recently, Stanford students
salted the grass outside the UC-
Berkeley Faculty C lub, said a Stan
lord junior who asked not to he iden
tified due to possible legal repercus
sions. Soon after, ;in enormous "S"
shape was deeply and visibly etched
on the field, the student said.
The next week, the "S" and the

"U" on the South San Francisco
Highway sign were painted red.
Also painted red was Founder's
Rock, a monument at UC-Berke
ley, and the "C" on the hill above
the UC-Berkeley stadium.
The Rally, UC-Berkeley's ver
sion of The Stanford Axe Commit
tee. has not been as visible at the
Farm, said the anonymous student.
The only UC-Berkeley presence at
Stanford thus far has been on Mon
day, when Berkeley's band played
in front of Branner Hall at five a.m.
When asked about traditional
UC-Berkeley pranks. Bursar Jon
Erickson, 1497 advisor to Axe
Comm. said "there really haven't
been too many good ones bv Cal."

However, students are still ac
tive in preventing Berkeley pranks.
Hand sections sleep in the Band
Sliak the week before Big Game to
prevent the Cal hand Irom stealing
items. This tradition is still main
tained. even though the Sliak has
now been relocated.
liven the vigilance of Stanford
band members, however, has not al
ways been enough to prevent IK -
Berkeley students from performing
pranks at the expense of Stanford.
Pranks I'rom the past
In the mid-l%()s. Cal students
released around fifty blue-dyed
mice at a Gaieties performance.
Another group of Cal students
used a flare gun to light the Stan
ford Big Game bonfire; the shoot
er was beaten and saved only by
police intervention.
In other years, while claiming to
go on picnics, Stanford students
burned huge S's into the Berkeley
campus grounds.
Stanford students have even re
sorted to placing toothpicks in the
locks of Memorial Stadium.

Participating in pranks
Despite the long history of Big
Game pranks, Axe Comm does not
officially participate in organized
pranks out of fear that pranks could
lead to violence.
Other Stanford students remain
excited to participate in pranks.
Randall Graham, a freshman on the
novice crew team, said he and his
team are "taking red food coloring
and ten gallons of Joy dish washing
soap to make a lovely mess of the
[UC-Berkeley] main fountain."
His teammate Stew Campbell
said, "I hope the Cal students enjoy
the millions of red hubbies."
