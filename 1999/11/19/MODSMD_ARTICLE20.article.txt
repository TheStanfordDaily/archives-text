Slippery when wet
I like the new Science and Engineering
Quad. Although it is has not yet become a
thriving marketplace for scientific knowl
edge (I have never seen more than 12 people
inside it at the same time), the new Quad
seems well on its way to becoming yet anoth
er hallmark of our "I lallmark card" campus.
The other day as I sped through the E-
Quad (for those inclined to consider it a part
of the e-revolution) I envisioned all the sci
entific genius that would henceforth roam
those hallowed walkways. I turned onto the
bridge that dumps you out of the E-Quad
(toward the Green Earth Sciences Build
ing)'
It was at this moment that I realized the
E-Ouad does have one flaw. My epiphany
was more of a physical realization than any
thing else, namely careening shoulder-first
into the hard metal of the bridge. 1 arose
stunned, visionless (my glasses had flown
from my face on impact) and scraped up. but
kept cool and pretended like nothing hap
pened (as though the blood dripping down
my split forehead would magically disap
pear). It was then that I realized where the
overpaid architect who made the E-Quad
went wrong.
I admit that I was probably riding too fast;
just the same, a little foresight from the E-
Quad's planners would have been enough to
save me from falling.
I wonder how this oversight could have
been made, considering it rains here just
about every other day from October until
February
The best solution would be to cover the
bridge with a less slippery substance (maybe

motor oil) to reduce the chance of falling. In
the meantime. I suggest posting a sign or two
that reads: "$6()-million Engineering Quad
has a hopelessly impractical bridge: Use cau
tion."

Clarifying Frosh T-shirt
misconceptions
Given the controversy that the Class of
2(K)3 T-shirt has aroused, we feel that certain
misconceptions should be addressed.
Residents in each dorm housing freshmen
selected at least one fellow resident to serve
as a representative to the Freshman Council.
This election creates a system where these
representatives are able to coordinate pro
grams aimed directly at the Class of 2(X)3, the
class T-shirt being an example of such an
activity.
The Daily article on Nov. 15 stated that
"The Council coordinators responded by
calling the meeting and ultimately overturn
ing their decision in favor of another, more
â€¢neutral' shirt." This statement gives the false
impression that the Coordinators were
responsible for the selection and ultimately
the replacement of the class T-shirt.
In reality, the Frosh Council Coordinators
do not make the final decisions for Frosh
Council activities. The Council of Freshmen,
elected by their peers, selected the design
and later decided to replace it with a less con
troversial one.
The Coordinators take full responsibility
for the repercussions of the T-shirt design

selection, but it is important to recognize that
this was a decision made hv members of the
Class of 2003 for the members of the Class of
2003.
In addition, there was no contact between
the Frosh Council Coordinators and any par
ticular groups on campus. A statement was e
mailed to the entire Class of 2003 on Nov. 12.
which included an apology to all who were
offended by the original design. An e-mail
was also sent out to all those who had con
tacted the Coordinators regarding the
design, which included the Women's Coali
tion. No student group approached the
Coordinators about discussing the issue.
The Nov. 16 editorial entitled "Necessary
Changes" also presented several erroneous
assertions:
The author stresses that a T-shirt design
should appeal to the entire class but fails to
recognize that the original T-shirt design was
viewed quite favorably by the vast majority
of freshmen. In fact, the Coordinators have
received many complaints from people who
were extremely disappointed that the Coun
cil decided to change the design.
The Council is comfortable with its deci
sion to use a new design, but it should be
pointed out that the original design was not
entirely unpopular. It is impossible to know
the point of view of every student in a class of
1,750. Still, it can be assumed that dorms will
elect Frosh Council representatives that they
believe will represent their views as accurate
ly as possible.
Throughout the longer T-shirt selection
proccss, the Frosh Council had openly dis
cussed the possibility of other designs being
perceived as offensive by their peers. The

James Bond design, however, was never
viewed as part of this category.
In addition, the 30 e-mails received by the
Frosh Council Coordinators were not all
from freshmen, as indicated in the editorial.
Approximately half of these messages were
from upperclassmen, many of whom had
never seen the design.
Hopefully, this discussion has been a valu
able learning experience for everyone
involved. We are confident that the Frosh
Council will continue to do its best to make
this year a positive and memorable one for
the Class of 2003.

Band shouldn't be punished
for Cal students' unruly
behavior
I agree with the editorials in The Stanford
Daily (Nov. 12) and the San Francisco
Chronicle (Nov. 13) that assert that the
administration's decision / request that the
Band refrain from certain activities during
Big Game is misguided.
The Band, it seems, is a focal point and an
easy target, when it is quite clear that the
problems attendant to student behavior at
Big Game have been the fault and responsi
bility of Cal students for years.
UC-Berkelcy has to do something to
address the intolerable behavior of its stu
dents at Big Game, and Stanford students
