WOMEN'S SOCCER

■ Tonight: No. 8 Stanford at No. 5
Notre Dame, 5:30 p.m South Bend,
Ind.

The last time the No. 8 Stanford
women's soccer team (15-4-1) faced
No. 5 Notre Dame (19-3) was hack in
preseason. The women traveled east
to scrimmage the Fighting Irish well
before the season even started, and
they lost. But, this time, the Cardinal
smells victory.
Tonight, Stanford will battle the
Fighting Irish in the third round of the
NCAA Tournament in South Bend,
Ind.
"We are a totally different team
than we were back in preseason," se

nior co-captain Jennifer O'Sullivan
said. "As a team, we are a lot more or
ganized. We have grown a lot off the
field and that closeness also translates
to the playing field."
When the Cardinal and Notre
Dame met hack in August, they
played in a scrimmage, not an actual
game. The game did not count to
ward the team's season record, and
Stanford used it as an opportunity to
test the strengths and weaknesses of
its game.
"The last time we played Notre
Dame, we never put a full starting
lineup on the field," assistant coach
Suzanne Eastman said. "We tried
people in a lot of different positions
and tried to give a lot of different peo
ple playing time."
On the other hand, it is likely that
Notre Dame put forth a full effort on
the field against the Cardinal. The
Irish lost head coach Chris Petrucelli

to Texas over the offseason and is ad
justing to the leadership of Randy
Waldrum from Baylor.
"When you scrimmage a team you
focus on the aspects of your game
that need work," O'Sullivan said.
"Notre Dame is a very strong team
and the work they needed was not
necessarily trying new things out —
they really just needed to continue
what they were doing well. They real
ly went all out against us."
The experience of the season will
particulary work to the Cardinal's ad
vantage as four of its freshmen,
Kelsey Carlson, Ali Marquand.
Becky Myers and Marcia Wallis, start
for the Cardinal. The focus for the
freshmen this year has been on the
adjustment to the level of college
play, which is remarkably faster and
more physical than high school or
club competition.
" The experience of the season will

be pivotal for these freshmen," senior
Natalie Kim said. "College soccer is
almost a totally different game. There
is no doubt that they will have im
proved considerably."
Notre Dame was seeded higher
than the Cardinal in the tournament,
and because of this, the Irish received
the homefield venue for tonight's
game. The Cardinal, however, does
not see this as a disadvantage.
"At this point, either team can win
on any given day." O'Sullivan said
from her hotel room in preparation
for tonight's game. "It's all about
mental preparation, and right now.
we don't have school [work] or out
side distractions. We are here for a
reason and that is to beat Notre
Dame."
A win against Notre Dame would
advance the Cardinal to the quarter
finals where it would likely face No. 4
Nebraksa.
