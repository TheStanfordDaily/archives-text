WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL

■ Thursday: No. 2 Stanford def
Washington State 15-0,15-11,15-5.

■ Friday: No. 2 Stanford vs. Wash
ington, 7:30 p.m. Maples Pavilion.

The Stanford squad is on the
road to glory as it defeated Wash
ington State (13-12,7-10) last night
in three straight games, 15-0, 15-
11, 15-5, at Maples Pavilion. Stan
ford will wrap up its home sched
ule tonight as the Cardinal takes
on Washington (8-16, 4-12) at 7:30
p.m. on its home turf.
Stanford came out strong and
hageled the Cougars in less than 15
minutes to take the first game 15-0.
Washington State lacked sufficient
communication on defense, which
resulted in many unforced errors
on their side of the floor.
The Cardinal let up a hit in the
second game, allowing the
Cougars to momentarily take the
lead at 9-8. Stanford's powerful
serving and hard hitting soon
proved to he too much for the
Cougar contingency, and the Car
dinal never again lost its momen
tum or intensity.
Freshman outside hitter Logan

Tom led the team with 14 kills and
