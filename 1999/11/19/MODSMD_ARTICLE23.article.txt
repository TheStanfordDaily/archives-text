WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL

■ Thursday: No. 2 Stanford def
Washington State 15-0,15-11,15-5.

■ Friday: No. 2 Stanford vs. Wash
ington, 7:30 p.m. Maples Pavilion.

The Stanford squad is on the
road to glory as it defeated Wash
ington State (13-12,7-10) last night
in three straight games, 15-0, 15-
11, 15-5, at Maples Pavilion. Stan
ford will wrap up its home sched
ule tonight as the Cardinal takes
on Washington (8-16, 4-12) at 7:30
p.m. on its home turf.
Stanford came out strong and
hageled the Cougars in less than 15
minutes to take the first game 15-0.
Washington State lacked sufficient
communication on defense, which
resulted in many unforced errors
on their side of the floor.
The Cardinal let up a hit in the
second game, allowing the
Cougars to momentarily take the
lead at 9-8. Stanford's powerful
serving and hard hitting soon
proved to he too much for the
Cougar contingency, and the Car
dinal never again lost its momen
tum or intensity.
Freshman outside hitter Logan

Tom led the team with 14 kills and
a hitting percentage of .435. Red
shirt freshman outside hitter and
middle blocker Lindsey Yamasaki
had a strong game as well with
seven kills and nine digs.

Senior outside hitter Jaimi Gre
gory provided quite a bit of defen
sive support as well, tallying seven
digs. Sophomore middle blockers


Matt Kraft — Daily
Senior Kerri Walsh goes up for a block last night against Washing
ton State. The Cardinal won in three games last night and faces
Washington tonight to finish out the Pac-10 season.
Tara Conrad and Sara Sandrik had
six and five kills, respectively.
Two conference wins for Stan
ford this weekend plus a USC win
over UCLA tomorrow would give
the Cardinal a Pac-10 crown of its
own. If UCLA defeats USC, then
they will be tied with Stanford for
the championship.
While Stanford would prefer to

keep the trophy all to itself, the
Cardinal will still receive an auto
matic berth to the NCAA tourna
ment if it prevails tonight. In the
league's tie-breaking scenario, the
team with the most points scored
during the two league competitions
between the two teams has the
upper hand.
Stanford squeaked by these lo
gistics in that they outscored
UCLA 89-86 in the two season
matchups.
Graduating seniors Sarah

Clark, Jaimi Gregory and Kerri
Walsh will be honored for their ef
forts as crucial team assets the past
four years in a pre-match ceremo
ny tonight. The three seniors have
served as superb team leaders in
that they each bring an added di
mension of personality to the
squad.
"The seniors have a good dy
namic. We are all strict in our con
victions to the sport and play dif
ferent roles on the team," said
Clark.
