Figures that it would be "Big
Game" weekend.

MEN'S SOCCER

â–  Tonight: No. 16 Stanford at No. 17
Santa Clara, 7:30 p.m. Santa Clara.

It would be hard to imagine the
No. 16 Stanford men's soccer team
(12-4-2, 5-1-1) having a bigger game
than its first-round match of the
NCAA tournament Friday against
No. 17 Santa Clara (13-3-2.3-1-2).
For the Cardinal, it's a chance to
give fans a second-consecutive first
round win at home. For the Broncos,
it's a chance to avenge Stanford's 1-0
double-overtime victory earlier this
season.
One thing is for certain, when the
final whistle blows Friday night only
one team will be left with the chance
to make a repeat appearance in the
Final Four.
"It couldn't be a better game."
head coach Bobby Clark said. "It's a
very exciting game for the Bay Area.

For anyone who's a soccer fan, this is
a game they're going to want to see."
Indeed the Cardinal-Bronco
matchup should he a red Hag to any
soccer fan who's been following the
teams over the past couple of years.
The Bay Area rivals always give their
fans a show to remember.
With the all-time series record
deadlocked at 16-16-4. Friday's game
will push one team over the top in the
all-time record of the rivalry. But not
after a game that promises to be a
thriller.
Both teams ended their seasons
last year with a trip to the Final Four
and both teams fell to Indiana. Santa
Clara in the semifinals and Stanford
in the championship match. Looking
to return, neither team will be ready
to bow out in the first round. The last
time the two teams met in the NCAA
tournament was back in 1991 when
the Broncos pulled out a 2-1 victory,
but only after four overtimes.
And with both teams finishing sec
ond in their respective conferences,
boasting records only two points
