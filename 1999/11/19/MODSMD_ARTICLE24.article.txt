Game" weekend.

MEN'S SOCCER

â–  Tonight: No. 16 Stanford at No. 17
Santa Clara, 7:30 p.m. Santa Clara.

It would be hard to imagine the
No. 16 Stanford men's soccer team
(12-4-2, 5-1-1) having a bigger game
than its first-round match of the
NCAA tournament Friday against
No. 17 Santa Clara (13-3-2.3-1-2).
For the Cardinal, it's a chance to
give fans a second-consecutive first
round win at home. For the Broncos,
it's a chance to avenge Stanford's 1-0
double-overtime victory earlier this
season.
One thing is for certain, when the
final whistle blows Friday night only
one team will be left with the chance
to make a repeat appearance in the
Final Four.
"It couldn't be a better game."
head coach Bobby Clark said. "It's a
very exciting game for the Bay Area.

For anyone who's a soccer fan, this is
a game they're going to want to see."
Indeed the Cardinal-Bronco
matchup should he a red Hag to any
soccer fan who's been following the
teams over the past couple of years.
The Bay Area rivals always give their
fans a show to remember.
With the all-time series record
deadlocked at 16-16-4. Friday's game
will push one team over the top in the
all-time record of the rivalry. But not
after a game that promises to be a
thriller.
Both teams ended their seasons
last year with a trip to the Final Four
and both teams fell to Indiana. Santa
Clara in the semifinals and Stanford
in the championship match. Looking
to return, neither team will be ready
to bow out in the first round. The last
time the two teams met in the NCAA
tournament was back in 1991 when
the Broncos pulled out a 2-1 victory,
but only after four overtimes.
And with both teams finishing sec
ond in their respective conferences,
boasting records only two points
apart and with a close game already
at their backs this season, it's hard to
expect that Friday's game will be
much different.
Stanford's victory at Santa Clara
earlier this month was a hard-fought,
back-and-forth battle as each team
posted 13 shots on the night, includ
ing a penalty kick for Santa Clara that
went just wide. In the second over
time, junior midfielder Ryan Nelsen
finally put the game away with a head
ball off a cornerkick from co-captain
defender Gerard Davis.
"It will be a very difficult game,"
co-captain midfielder T.K. Inbodv
said of Friday's match. "We pulled it
out last time and being at home will
be advantage. We've just got to keep
doing the same things we've been

doing."
The Cardinal is hoping to extend
its 25-1 -3 winning record at New Mal
oney field over the last four years and
utilize the home-field advantage to
secure the win on Friday and earn the
right to face the winner of No. 1 Duke
and Maryland-Baltimore County.
To do so, the Stanford men will
have to he wary of Santa Clara's
marksman, sophomore forward An
thony Chimienti who has notched a
team-leading 22 points this season,
tying him for sixth among the leaders
in the West Coast Conference for
points and goals. Supporting Chimi
enti on the attack is senior midfielder
Sean-Michael Callahan, who is tied
for first in the conference with seven
assists.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal offense
will have to grapple with a strong
squad in the backfield that yielded a
conference-low 10 goals this season.

The defense is lead by AU-WCC
first-team members, WCC Defender
of the Year senior Adam Eyre and
sophomore goalkeeper Rusty John
son, who is atop the conference with
11 shutouts and a .55 goals-against
average.
Although it is impossible to ignore
the powerful force of the Broncos,
Clark is confident that his team has
what it takes to pull out a victory.
"The teams that win big games are
teams that handle and enjoy the envi
ronment," Clark said. "This is what
we've played all year for. This Stan
ford team wants to play. They know
we've done well, but also know we
can do so much better. They're ready
to burst out and that's what's exciting
about this opportunity."
Junior forward Luke Rust agreed.
"The team's really peaking right
now, which is perfect because we've
got five games to win."
