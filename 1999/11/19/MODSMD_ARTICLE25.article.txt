; Bears 8-7 with a final two-point goal
iby redshirt sophomore Todd

season game for the 11) seniors from
both schools.
Stanford's five seniors, Brian
Heifferon, Sean Joy, Jon Skaalen,
Mike Lipinski and Andy Walburger,
will be playing their last game at
deGuerre. As starters, all five have
contributed greatly to the Cardinal's
success this season.
Heifferon, a three-time All-
American, is the team's leading scor
er with 31 points this season and 124
in his career. Joy, on a scoring tear of
late, is right behind 1 leiffcron with 30
points this season. Skaalen has been
a potent threat from outside, leading
the team in two-point goals with five.
Lipinski, with 12 points on the sea
son, is one of the best two-meter men
in the country. Scoring 42 points in
the last two seasons, Walburger has
taken a large share of the scoring
load.
On Saturday, Stanford will look

to these seniors to lead the team
against the talented Bears.
Cal is led by four players with
more than 20 points on the season.
Jerry Smith, Eldad Ha/.or Joe Kaiser
and Albert Woo. An important focus
for the Cardinal will be junior hole
man Smith, the Bears' leading scorer,
who "has always given us problems,"
Dcttamanti said.
The job of containing Smith will
be handed to the Stanford defense,
anchored by redshirt freshman
goalie Nick Ellis, who is averaging
N. 6 saves per game. As Stanford has
suffered some scoring woes in the
second half of the season, the team
defense has been consistently
strong.
But regardless of the team's rela
tive strengths, anything goes in the
Big Splash.
