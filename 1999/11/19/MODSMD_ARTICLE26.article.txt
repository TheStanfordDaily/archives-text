# Collins overcomes adversity
## Returning from injuries, Jason teams with brother Jarron 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
If you know him well and ask
just right, Jason Collins, Stanford's
biggest and oldest freshman bas
ketball player, might take off the
brown leather bag that is thrown
over his 6-foot. 11-inch, 255-pound
frame, open it up and take out a
memento of the past two years,
two of the worst years of his life.
Jason is not really a freshman.
He arrived on campus two years
ago as one half of Stanford's
biggest recruiting catch ever — the
Collins twins. He and brother Jar
ron. both named Parade and Mc-
Donald's All-Americans, were
fresh off winning their second-con
secutive California state basket
ball title at Harvard-Westlakc
High School near Los Angeles.
They were big. tall and athletic,
with room to grow into their lanky
bodies. They were personable, dis
ciplined and competitive. In short,
the Collinses were the twin towers
around which Stanford was going
to build its future success.
"They dominated in high
school." said junior point guard
Mike McDonald, who knew the
Collinses growing up. "When I
came here, I was hoping we'd all
come here for four years', play to
gether and bring home some ti
tles."
But that dream was delayed.
In November of 1997, while
practicing for a preseason game in
Hawaii. Jason came out of practice
with an injury to his left knee. At
first, no one was very concerned.
Doctors told Jason they would go
in and scope his knee. He was to
return in three weeks.

But nothing went according to
plan. Jason had to have surgery in
December and then again in Feb
ruary of 1998. While the team
stormed out of the gate to win its
first IS games and then bulled its

way into the Final Four, helped
mightily hv his brother's stellar
postseason play. Jason sat on the
bench, redshirting the season.


Ashley Brown — Daily
Redshirt freshman Jason Collins, right, is eager to get on the court
and make a difference for this year's Cardinal squad after sitting
out the last two seasons due to injury.
i But everyone told him. "there's
.always next year."
i "Naturally, we were disappoint
ed," said head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "But sometimes the big
[guys can use a year to improve and
[get stronger. We thought it might
'actually be good for him to sit out
•and then help us the next year."
i For the first six games of last sea
ison, Jason was helping. He was
.doing everything Stanford wanted
, out of a first-year player — banging
[underneath, pulling down re
[ bounds, converting opportunities
J close to the basket,
j "He was just getting back, just
[getting his game legs back," said
'Jarron. "He was starting to really
'be a force against Tim [Young,
•Stanford's senior center last year]
• in practice."
i His seventh game back was the
[problem.

When driving to the basket
against George Washington last
December, Jason had his legs cut
from under him as he put up his
shot. The shot fell through, but his
wrist was hurt so badly bracing the
fall that he couldn't take the ensu
ing foul shot. In fact, he couldn't
play another game for the rest of
the season.
"1 knew something was wrong
right away," Jason said. "It hurt so
much. It felt like hitting your elbow
really hard, but to the 20th degree.
The pain just shot through my arm
right away. My whole arm just lit
up."
Jason had suffered a perilunate
dislocation, the same injury that
continues to sideline the Knicks'
Patrick Ewing. He was immediate
ly told his season was over, and doc
tors even told Jason his promising
career could be in jeopardy.
"Any time you have that type of
dislocation, you're in trouble," he
said. "You have eight bones in your
wrist and seven are dislocated.

Only one bone is okay."
While the physical pain of the in
jury was enough, the emotional
trauma might have been greater.
After a year out. all Jason wanted
to do was to get back on the court
and get his collegiate career start
ed. But like a bad dream repeating
itself, his season was literally over
in a snap.
"I was devastated," he said.
"The toughest thing for him was
that the way athletes work through
problems is to practice more or lift
more weights or do more," said
Montgomery. Because of the na
ture of the injury, "he couldn't do
anything."
I lis friends and family, many of
whom live in the area, helped him
through the first days, which Jason
said were the worst. Finding a way
to contribute to the team while on
the bench helped him through the
rest of the year.
"You never really leave the
team." Jason said, "you just change
roles. [Assistant coach Trent John

son, now head coach at Nevada]
told me there's more ways to con
tribute than to play. Being a leader,
being vocal, noticing the tendencies
of other teams — that's what I
could do."
Still, as the team stayed ranked
in the top five nationally on its way
to the school's first Pacific 10 Con
ference championship, Jason was
itching to get back on the court.
When he finally did this summer,
he was — understandably — a bit
rusty.
"My summer league coach kept
yelling at me because I was having
trouble," he said. "I didn't make
excuses but, I mean, 1 hadn't played
in two years. I had no timing on the
court."
A few months later, Jason, still a
freshman after being granted a
medical redshirt. is beginning to
look almost as good as new. In the
Cardinal's season opener with
Duke, he scored only four points
but managed to pull down 12 re
bounds.

The next night against lowa,
Jason ripped down another 12
boards. Playing 34 minutes, he also
found his scoring touch, pouring in
a game-high 18 points.
Jason's play against the
Hawkeyes was especially impor
tant because of the loss of senior
forward Mark Madsen. Madsen,
the team's lone returning starter,
was expected to anchor the Cardi
nal's strong frontcourt rotation, but
strained his hamstring late in the
Duke game.
With the strength, intensity and
hustle of "Mad Dog" gone for at
least a month, both Jason and Jar
ron will start in the low post as they
did against lowa, and two fresh
men. Curtis Borchardt and Joe Kir
chofcr, will be forced to contribute
off the bench.
"Even I wondered what we were
going to do without him because
Madsen is our leader." Jason said.
But, "when he went down, we all
came together and said this is the
chance for each of us to step up and

help this team win."
And win it will if Jason can stay
on the floor.
But that "if" still lingers. While
his past makes it difficult even to
consider, like any athlete, Jason
could fall to injury again at any
time.
After two years away from the
sport which has defined his life,
Jason has come to grips with this
ugly side of sports. He understands
he could be an NBA All-Star, or his
career could end tomorrow. And in
case he forgets, he keeps a few sou
venirs to remind him.
In that leather sack that he slings
around everyday to class and prac
tice and games, Jason carries the
five metal pins that kept his right
wrist in place last winter. The pins
sit quietly, tucked away in a nonde
script plastic bag. But to Jason, they
say a lot.
"I keep the pins to remind me of
how fortunate I am." he said.
"Sports won't last forever. There
arc no guarantees."

tice and games, Jason carries the
five metal pins that kept his right
wrist in place last winter. The pins
sit quietly, tucked away in a nonde
script plastic bag. But to Jason, they
say a lot.
"I keep the pins to remind me of
how fortunate I am." he said.
"Sports won't last forever. There
arc no guarantees."
If you know him well and ask
just right, Jason Collins, Stanford's
biggest and oldest freshman bas
ketball player, might take off the
brown leather bag that is thrown
over his 6-foot. 11-inch, 255-pound
frame, open it up and take out a
memento of the past two years,
two of the worst years of his life.
Jason is not really a freshman.
He arrived on campus two years
ago as one half of Stanford's
biggest recruiting catch ever — the
Collins twins. He and brother Jar
ron. both named Parade and Mc-
Donald's All-Americans, were
fresh off winning their second-con
secutive California state basket
ball title at Harvard-Westlakc
High School near Los Angeles.
They were big. tall and athletic,
with room to grow into their lanky
bodies. They were personable, dis
ciplined and competitive. In short,
the Collinses were the twin towers
around which Stanford was going
to build its future success.
"They dominated in high
school." said junior point guard
Mike McDonald, who knew the
Collinses growing up. "When I
came here, I was hoping we'd all
come here for four years', play to
gether and bring home some ti
tles."
But that dream was delayed.
In November of 1997, while
practicing for a preseason game in
Hawaii. Jason came out of practice
with an injury to his left knee. At
first, no one was very concerned.
Doctors told Jason they would go
in and scope his knee. He was to
return in three weeks.

But nothing went according to
plan. Jason had to have surgery in
December and then again in Feb
ruary of 1998. While the team
stormed out of the gate to win its
first IS games and then bulled its

way into the Final Four, helped
mightily hv his brother's stellar
postseason play. Jason sat on the
bench, redshirting the season.


Ashley Brown — Daily
Redshirt freshman Jason Collins, right, is eager to get on the court
and make a difference for this year's Cardinal squad after sitting
out the last two seasons due to injury.
i But everyone told him. "there's
.always next year."
i "Naturally, we were disappoint
ed," said head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "But sometimes the big
[guys can use a year to improve and
[get stronger. We thought it might
'actually be good for him to sit out
•and then help us the next year."
i For the first six games of last sea
ison, Jason was helping. He was
.doing everything Stanford wanted
, out of a first-year player — banging
[underneath, pulling down re
[ bounds, converting opportunities
J close to the basket,
j "He was just getting back, just
[getting his game legs back," said
'Jarron. "He was starting to really
'be a force against Tim [Young,
•Stanford's senior center last year]
• in practice."
i His seventh game back was the
[problem.

When driving to the basket
against George Washington last
December, Jason had his legs cut
from under him as he put up his
shot. The shot fell through, but his
wrist was hurt so badly bracing the
fall that he couldn't take the ensu
ing foul shot. In fact, he couldn't
play another game for the rest of
the season.
"1 knew something was wrong
right away," Jason said. "It hurt so
much. It felt like hitting your elbow
really hard, but to the 20th degree.
The pain just shot through my arm
right away. My whole arm just lit
up."
Jason had suffered a perilunate
dislocation, the same injury that
continues to sideline the Knicks'
Patrick Ewing. He was immediate
ly told his season was over, and doc
tors even told Jason his promising
career could be in jeopardy.
"Any time you have that type of
dislocation, you're in trouble," he
said. "You have eight bones in your
wrist and seven are dislocated.

Only one bone is okay."
While the physical pain of the in
jury was enough, the emotional
trauma might have been greater.
After a year out. all Jason wanted
to do was to get back on the court
and get his collegiate career start
ed. But like a bad dream repeating
itself, his season was literally over
in a snap.
"I was devastated," he said.
"The toughest thing for him was
that the way athletes work through
problems is to practice more or lift
more weights or do more," said
Montgomery. Because of the na
ture of the injury, "he couldn't do
anything."
I lis friends and family, many of
whom live in the area, helped him
through the first days, which Jason
said were the worst. Finding a way
to contribute to the team while on
the bench helped him through the
rest of the year.
"You never really leave the
team." Jason said, "you just change
roles. [Assistant coach Trent John

son, now head coach at Nevada]
told me there's more ways to con
tribute than to play. Being a leader,
being vocal, noticing the tendencies
of other teams — that's what I
could do."
Still, as the team stayed ranked
in the top five nationally on its way
to the school's first Pacific 10 Con
ference championship, Jason was
itching to get back on the court.
When he finally did this summer,
he was — understandably — a bit
rusty.
"My summer league coach kept
yelling at me because I was having
trouble," he said. "I didn't make
excuses but, I mean, 1 hadn't played
in two years. I had no timing on the
court."
A few months later, Jason, still a
freshman after being granted a
medical redshirt. is beginning to
look almost as good as new. In the
Cardinal's season opener with
Duke, he scored only four points
but managed to pull down 12 re
bounds.

The next night against lowa,
Jason ripped down another 12
boards. Playing 34 minutes, he also
found his scoring touch, pouring in
a game-high 18 points.
Jason's play against the
Hawkeyes was especially impor
tant because of the loss of senior
forward Mark Madsen. Madsen,
the team's lone returning starter,
was expected to anchor the Cardi
nal's strong frontcourt rotation, but
strained his hamstring late in the
Duke game.
With the strength, intensity and
hustle of "Mad Dog" gone for at
least a month, both Jason and Jar
ron will start in the low post as they
did against lowa, and two fresh
men. Curtis Borchardt and Joe Kir
chofcr, will be forced to contribute
off the bench.
"Even I wondered what we were
going to do without him because
Madsen is our leader." Jason said.
But, "when he went down, we all
came together and said this is the
chance for each of us to step up and

help this team win."
And win it will if Jason can stay
on the floor.
But that "if" still lingers. While
his past makes it difficult even to
consider, like any athlete, Jason
could fall to injury again at any
time.
After two years away from the
sport which has defined his life,
Jason has come to grips with this
ugly side of sports. He understands
he could be an NBA All-Star, or his
career could end tomorrow. And in
case he forgets, he keeps a few sou
venirs to remind him.
In that leather sack that he slings

tice and games, Jason carries the
