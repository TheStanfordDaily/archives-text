# Collins overcomes adversity
## Returning from injuries, Jason teams with brother Jarron 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
If you know him well and ask
just right, Jason Collins, Stanford's
biggest and oldest freshman bas
ketball player, might take off the
brown leather bag that is thrown
over his 6-foot. 11-inch, 255-pound
frame, open it up and take out a
memento of the past two years,
two of the worst years of his life.
Jason is not really a freshman.
He arrived on campus two years
ago as one half of Stanford's
biggest recruiting catch ever — the
Collins twins. He and brother Jar
ron. both named Parade and Mc-
Donald's All-Americans, were
fresh off winning their second-con
secutive California state basket
ball title at Harvard-Westlakc
High School near Los Angeles.
They were big. tall and athletic,
with room to grow into their lanky
bodies. They were personable, dis
ciplined and competitive. In short,
the Collinses were the twin towers
around which Stanford was going
to build its future success.
"They dominated in high
school." said junior point guard
Mike McDonald, who knew the
Collinses growing up. "When I
came here, I was hoping we'd all
come here for four years', play to
gether and bring home some ti
tles."
But that dream was delayed.
In November of 1997, while
practicing for a preseason game in
Hawaii. Jason came out of practice
with an injury to his left knee. At
first, no one was very concerned.
Doctors told Jason they would go
in and scope his knee. He was to
return in three weeks.

But nothing went according to
plan. Jason had to have surgery in
December and then again in Feb
ruary of 1998. While the team
stormed out of the gate to win its
first IS games and then bulled its

way into the Final Four, helped
mightily hv his brother's stellar
postseason play. Jason sat on the
bench, redshirting the season.

Redshirt freshman Jason Collins, right, is eager to get on the court
and make a difference for this year's Cardinal squad after sitting
out the last two seasons due to injury.
