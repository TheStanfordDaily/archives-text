## When Playtime is full of Games 
### Heather Wax Contributing writer 
Outside Bing Nursery School,
even though clouds covering the yard
predict rain, senior psychology major
Leonora Salado and some children
are playing in the mud.
Well maybe not exactly playing —
they're working on a worm farm that
Salado suggested when the kids want
ed to feed the chickens in the back.
But then again, playing has always
meant something a little different at
Bing.
Hundreds of studies have been
conducted at the laboratory nursery
school, built in 1 %6 with a grant from
the National Science Foundation, by
what the staff refers to as "game
room people." But the term is not
simply doublespeak for "researcher."
Stanford faculty members and gradu
ate students conduct experiments by
playing games with the close to 4(X) 2-
to 5-year-old children that go to
school there.
"The studies are designed to be in
teresting to children and not detri
mental in any way," said Jeanne Lep
per, director of the Bing Nursery
School and a psychology lecturer.
"Because the school was set up for
that purpose, it becomes part of a nat
ural environment and daily routine. It
requires a whole setting where every
one understands child development
and we work together for that pur
pose."
All the head teachers at Bing have
at least a master's degree in psycholo
gy or education and have been
trained in a laboratory school. Maybe
they're part of the reason 1,500 kids
are on the waiting list, although it may
also be the fact that the classrooms

arc complete with painting easels, nu
merous books and iMacs. Maybe
they're part of the reason parents
don't mind the up to five researchers
that can be there on any given day, al
though Lepper thinks there's another
possible reason for that too.
"This is a research community and
many like to contribute to the experi
ence when they see how it's done,"
she said.
It could also be that the school,
which gives preference to children of
Stanford faculty, staff and students,
makes sure the experiments are of no
risk to the children. All the studies
have to go through Stanford's
Human Subject Committee and, if

they're for Research Methods and
Experimental Design, also must be
approved by the professor. After
that, Mark Mabry.a head teacher and
the Research Coordinator, takes
great pains to thoroughly explain
them to parents.
"To come to the school, they have
to sign a release giving consent for the
child to participate, and I'd say 99.9
percent do. The ones that don't right
away think it's okay after talking to us
and sign off." Mabry said.
And though the child always has
the right to refuse to play one of the
experimental games, Mabry said very
few ever do.
"They just think I've been invited

to play a game with someone, even
though maybe they came away with
'that's a very unusual game.'"
But Bing is not only used by facul
ty members and graduate students
looking to conduct research in child
development. Undergraduates, such
as those in Debbie Whitmer's Devel
opment in Early Childhood class, use
it tor hands-on experience and to put
theory into practice.
Whitmer, who's now a head
teacher at the school, was herself a
student at the school and can recall
taking part in what is now called
"Marshmallow Studies." The re-

Bing Nursery School, located on Escondido Road, ranks as one of the most prestigious nursery schools
in the nation.
