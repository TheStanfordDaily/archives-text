## When Playtime is full of Games 
### Heather Wax Contributing writer 
Outside Bing Nursery School,
even though clouds covering the yard
predict rain, senior psychology major
Leonora Salado and some children
are playing in the mud.
Well maybe not exactly playing —
they're working on a worm farm that
Salado suggested when the kids want
ed to feed the chickens in the back.
But then again, playing has always
meant something a little different at
Bing.
Hundreds of studies have been
conducted at the laboratory nursery
school, built in 1 %6 with a grant from
the National Science Foundation, by
what the staff refers to as "game
room people." But the term is not
simply doublespeak for "researcher."
Stanford faculty members and gradu
ate students conduct experiments by
playing games with the close to 4(X) 2-
to 5-year-old children that go to
school there.
"The studies are designed to be in
teresting to children and not detri
mental in any way," said Jeanne Lep
per, director of the Bing Nursery
School and a psychology lecturer.
"Because the school was set up for
that purpose, it becomes part of a nat
ural environment and daily routine. It
requires a whole setting where every
one understands child development
and we work together for that pur
pose."
All the head teachers at Bing have
at least a master's degree in psycholo
gy or education and have been
trained in a laboratory school. Maybe
they're part of the reason 1,500 kids
are on the waiting list, although it may
also be the fact that the classrooms

arc complete with painting easels, nu
merous books and iMacs. Maybe
they're part of the reason parents
don't mind the up to five researchers
that can be there on any given day, al
though Lepper thinks there's another
possible reason for that too.
"This is a research community and
many like to contribute to the experi
ence when they see how it's done,"
she said.
It could also be that the school,
which gives preference to children of
Stanford faculty, staff and students,
makes sure the experiments are of no
risk to the children. All the studies
have to go through Stanford's
Human Subject Committee and, if

they're for Research Methods and
Experimental Design, also must be
approved by the professor. After
that, Mark Mabry.a head teacher and
the Research Coordinator, takes
great pains to thoroughly explain
them to parents.
"To come to the school, they have
to sign a release giving consent for the
child to participate, and I'd say 99.9
percent do. The ones that don't right
away think it's okay after talking to us
and sign off." Mabry said.
And though the child always has
the right to refuse to play one of the
experimental games, Mabry said very
few ever do.
"They just think I've been invited

to play a game with someone, even
though maybe they came away with
'that's a very unusual game.'"
But Bing is not only used by facul
ty members and graduate students
looking to conduct research in child
development. Undergraduates, such
as those in Debbie Whitmer's Devel
opment in Early Childhood class, use
it tor hands-on experience and to put
theory into practice.
Whitmer, who's now a head
teacher at the school, was herself a
student at the school and can recall
taking part in what is now called
"Marshmallow Studies." The re-

search was on delayed gratification
and, with marshmallows and pretzels
in front of her, Whitmer was asked to
wait to eat them until the "game
room person" returned with a friend.
"I definitely remember it. It was
only 3 minutes but it seemed like I
had to wait a long time," she said.
"Hut children love going to game
rooms and you can see them clamor
ing for a turn."
Among the "game riwrns" off the
airy and spacious atrium, one of Prof.
Ellen Markman's research assistants,
doctoral candidate Vikram Jaswal,
runs studies on language acquisition.
He works in what Mabrv describes as
"nothing more than a glorified clos
et." It houses only a table with two
small chairs (any toys in the "game
room" are hidden from view under
neath) and a couple of sinks, but

Mabry still calls it"the luxury suite of
game rooms." Presumably that's be
cause the other ones, half-filled with
balls, mats and boxes, literally look
like converted closets.
Vikram invites children into his
small room for 10-minute sessions to
study "Acquiring Proper Names,"
but they don't know that. He gets
them warmed up by letting them play
with Big Bird and Barney, and then
smoothly steers the interaction to the
purpose of his experiment.
From the observation window
that looks like a blue-curtained mir
ror on the other side, Marby looks on
and narrates how things are going.
"You can see how intrigued they
are. You have to be gentle and hu
morous. It's a skill he has become
very good at actually. See how he fin
ishes the turn bv letting him play. It's
not just 'Mv work here is done-let's
move on.'"
While the ins and outs of Vikram's
research is pretty complicated, he

does lay bare the benefits of having
access to a school such as Bing in sim
ple terms.
"This is a wonderful resource and
it's a major reason why I chose to
come (to Stanford]," he said of the
laboratory school that has proved a
big recruiting tool for the psychology
department.
Back on the floor of the class
room, amid five teachers, three Ob
servation of Children students taking
notes and a pile of wooden blocks,
you can see how comfortable Vikram
is and how at ease the kids are with
him.
"It's not like their beating a path
to the game room. They have to come
in for a few sessions before running
even a single child and get to know
them," Mabry said of the research as
sistants.
"Then they'll say, I'm going to
play a game now — do you want to
come?' What could be more natural
than that?"

are playing in the mud.
Well maybe not exactly playing —
they're working on a worm farm that
Salado suggested when the kids want
ed to feed the chickens in the back.
But then again, playing has always
meant something a little different at
Bing.
Hundreds of studies have been
conducted at the laboratory nursery
school, built in 1 %6 with a grant from
the National Science Foundation, by
what the staff refers to as "game
room people." But the term is not
simply doublespeak for "researcher."
Stanford faculty members and gradu
ate students conduct experiments by
playing games with the close to 4(X) 2-
to 5-year-old children that go to
school there.
"The studies are designed to be in
teresting to children and not detri
mental in any way," said Jeanne Lep
per, director of the Bing Nursery
School and a psychology lecturer.
"Because the school was set up for
that purpose, it becomes part of a nat
ural environment and daily routine. It
requires a whole setting where every
one understands child development
and we work together for that pur
pose."
All the head teachers at Bing have
at least a master's degree in psycholo
gy or education and have been
trained in a laboratory school. Maybe
they're part of the reason 1,500 kids
are on the waiting list, although it may
also be the fact that the classrooms

arc complete with painting easels, nu
merous books and iMacs. Maybe
they're part of the reason parents
don't mind the up to five researchers
that can be there on any given day, al
though Lepper thinks there's another
possible reason for that too.
"This is a research community and
many like to contribute to the experi
ence when they see how it's done,"
she said.
It could also be that the school,
which gives preference to children of
Stanford faculty, staff and students,
makes sure the experiments are of no
risk to the children. All the studies
have to go through Stanford's
Human Subject Committee and, if

they're for Research Methods and
Experimental Design, also must be
approved by the professor. After
that, Mark Mabry.a head teacher and
the Research Coordinator, takes
great pains to thoroughly explain
them to parents.
"To come to the school, they have
to sign a release giving consent for the
child to participate, and I'd say 99.9
percent do. The ones that don't right
away think it's okay after talking to us
and sign off." Mabry said.
And though the child always has
the right to refuse to play one of the
experimental games, Mabry said very
few ever do.
"They just think I've been invited

to play a game with someone, even
though maybe they came away with
'that's a very unusual game.'"
But Bing is not only used by facul
ty members and graduate students
looking to conduct research in child
development. Undergraduates, such
as those in Debbie Whitmer's Devel
opment in Early Childhood class, use
it tor hands-on experience and to put
theory into practice.
Whitmer, who's now a head
teacher at the school, was herself a
student at the school and can recall
taking part in what is now called
"Marshmallow Studies." The re-

search was on delayed gratification
and, with marshmallows and pretzels
in front of her, Whitmer was asked to
wait to eat them until the "game
room person" returned with a friend.
"I definitely remember it. It was
only 3 minutes but it seemed like I
had to wait a long time," she said.
"Hut children love going to game
rooms and you can see them clamor
ing for a turn."
Among the "game riwrns" off the
airy and spacious atrium, one of Prof.
Ellen Markman's research assistants,
doctoral candidate Vikram Jaswal,
runs studies on language acquisition.
He works in what Mabrv describes as
"nothing more than a glorified clos
et." It houses only a table with two
small chairs (any toys in the "game
room" are hidden from view under
neath) and a couple of sinks, but

Mabry still calls it"the luxury suite of
game rooms." Presumably that's be
cause the other ones, half-filled with
balls, mats and boxes, literally look
like converted closets.
Vikram invites children into his
small room for 10-minute sessions to
study "Acquiring Proper Names,"
but they don't know that. He gets
them warmed up by letting them play
with Big Bird and Barney, and then
smoothly steers the interaction to the
purpose of his experiment.
From the observation window
that looks like a blue-curtained mir
ror on the other side, Marby looks on
and narrates how things are going.
"You can see how intrigued they
are. You have to be gentle and hu
morous. It's a skill he has become
very good at actually. See how he fin
ishes the turn bv letting him play. It's
not just 'Mv work here is done-let's
move on.'"
While the ins and outs of Vikram's
research is pretty complicated, he

does lay bare the benefits of having
access to a school such as Bing in sim
ple terms.
"This is a wonderful resource and
it's a major reason why I chose to
come (to Stanford]," he said of the
laboratory school that has proved a
big recruiting tool for the psychology
department.
Back on the floor of the class
room, amid five teachers, three Ob
servation of Children students taking
notes and a pile of wooden blocks,
you can see how comfortable Vikram
is and how at ease the kids are with
him.
"It's not like their beating a path
to the game room. They have to come
in for a few sessions before running
even a single child and get to know
them," Mabry said of the research as
sistants.
"Then they'll say, I'm going to
play a game now — do you want to
come?' What could be more natural
than that?"
