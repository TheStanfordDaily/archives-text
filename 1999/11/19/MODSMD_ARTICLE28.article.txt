# Artsy cafe offers ambiance and simple menu

Fast the Gates of Hell and tucked
away at the side of the Iris & B. Ger
ald Cantor Center for Visual Arts at
Stanford, is a small stylish cafe that
seems relatively unknown to Stan
ford students.
The Cantor Art Center Cafe
opened in January 1999, when the
museum itself reopened 10 years
after the 1989 Loma Prieta earth
quake. It is part of the newly built
wing of the visual arts complex.
Overlooking a beautiful and
grassy terrace, the tasteful and simple
cafe and patio is a busy place around
lunch hour, with its varied clientele of
both the young and old.
The cafe is owned and catered by
Edible Art Inc., an upscale catering
company that also runs the Legion of
Honour and the DeYoung Museum,
both located in San Francisco.

Lisa Tomasi, the cafe manager,
has been there since the beginning.
"We started off with an ambitious
menu and a staff of eight or nine,"
Tomasi said. Since then, they've
scaled things down a little, and it has
run much more efficiently and suc
cessfully.
Everything on the menu is "home
made" out of San Francisco, Tomasi
says. They do all the in-house catering
for the museum, whenever there are
special and / or private events and ex
hibits. They have done buffets, and
one lucky woman won an auction for
an upscale sit-down dinner for 60 at
the cafe earlier in the year.
Tomasi finds most of the weekday
clientele to be Stanford faculty and
staff. "It's good because the museum
isn't as busy with outside visitors dur
ing the weekdays," she says..
The weekend tourists keep the
small staff of five busv as well. The

visitors who have dined at the cafe
have been varied, Tomasi says.
" There's a lot of elderly tour groups,

a lot of German and Japanese
