Stanford parents don't just lend
support to their Cardinal children
with the occasional care package
and monthly cash infusions. Organi
zations such as the Parents' Club
and Parents' Advisory Board are
encouraging an increasing number
of parents, some from places as far
off as Bangladesh and Korea, to get
involved in admissions events and
fundraising activities to enhance life
for the Stanford undergraduate.
"It's a really nice feature that a lot
of schools don't have," said Nancy
Stevens, a parent involved in both
the Advisory Board and Parents'
Club.
Parent-sponsored initiatives
such as catalog sales and the
Chrysanthemum Champagne Party
result in scholarship funds for in
coming students and extra boosts to
the education of the undergrads
themselves.
According to Jean Coblentz, di
rector of the Parents' Program,
sponsored by the Office of Develop
ment, every student needs some fi
nancial support: "Last year parents
gave over a million dollars in annual
gifts, which illustrates graphically
that most parents understand that
every student is subsidized to some
extent since tuition only covers
about 50 percent of the true cost of a
Stanford education — the rest has to
come from other sources.
"People think that Stanford is
rich because of the really large gifts
they read about in the paper, but al
most every one of those gifts is re
stricted and none of the dollars may
go to the undergraduates' educa
tion," said Coblentz.
An anchor of the Stanford ad
ministration for 21 years, Coblentz

helps the Parents' Program educate
parents about the importance of
providing support to Stanford. She
also helps coordinate the program's
Advisory Board and 27 regional
committees, headquartered in 13
states and 11 countries around the
globe. The program boasts of ap
proximately 150 people available to
volunteer work if asked, as well as 45
families active on the Parents' Advi
sory Board itself.
The Board represents "all the
classes and all the regions of the
world where there is a critical mass
of students," Coblentz said. "Both
dads and moms are very active on
the board — a change from the days
when most volunteering was done
by moms." This critical mass of stu
dents includes countries where a
parent is willing to act as a "Stanford
ambassador" in welcoming and
sending off parents and students.
While the Parents' Advisory
Board was created in 1990. the Par
ents' Club is celebrating its 75th year
of service to Stanford undergradu
ates. The money raised by the club
goes to benefit its own Scholarship
Endowment Fund. Known until re
cently as "the Mothers' Club," this
organization is locally based and
made up of 75 active volunteers —
including faculty wives and parents
whose students have already gradu
ated.
"There are quite a few alumni,
and we also have quite a few older
members, many faculty wives," said
Carol Knowles, vice president of
membership. "We have many peo
ple whose children have graduated
but still want to get involved."
"This is one of the only organiza
tions on campus that directly ser
vices the undergrads," said club
president Mary Popek. "You're giv
ing them a touch of home."
The Club offers a birthday cake
scrvice, which may help parents who
cannot be there in person at least be
there in spirit for their homesick stu
dents. "It's a birthday party on
wheels," said Popek.
"We make them feel less than
3.0(H) miles away" from their par
ents. said Parents' Club volunteer
Carol McKenna.- "And these cakes
are delivered byStanford moms."
The Parents' Club is also actively
involved in events such as Orienta
tion and Parents' Weekend, which
now attracts an unprecedented
number of visitors. If it seems as if
these parents are doing a lot of jobs
that the University would normally
be doing, and for free, it seems that
way to the parents themselves too:
"We're really great PR for the uni
versity because we're super-enthusi
astic," said Popek.
