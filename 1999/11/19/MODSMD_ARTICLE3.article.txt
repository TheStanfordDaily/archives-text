# Big Game rally plans are unchanged in wake of fatal accident
## Stanford mourns Texas bonfire tragedy 
### Mark Boucher 
Yesterday's fatal bonfire col
lapse at Texas A&M University
has Stanford students expressing
concern and sympathy for the uni
versity's students, especially the 2N
injured students and the 11 stu
dents who, at press time, were con
firmed dead.
"We consider [this event) a real
tragedy," said Dean of Students
Marc Wais.
"We send our condolences to
the families of those injured and
killed."
"The thoughts of the Stanford
University Axe Committee go out
to the students and their families,"
said senior Corey Griffen, a mem

ber of Axe Comm.
I le noted that Axe Comm prob
ably shares a common purpose
with the group at Texas A&M,
called Texas Aggie Bonfire, that
built the bonfire.
"It's a shame that rallying be
fore a game can be so dangerous,"
said freshman Bryan Stephens.
"Hopefully. Stanford will see this
as an unfortunate incident and take
actions to make our rallies safer for
all involved."
When the Texas bonfire col
lapsed. the students were climbing
on the logs that formed the struc
ture or placing logs inside it.
According to Griffen. the bon
fires formerly held in the bed of
l.ake Lagunita were structurally

different from the bonfire at lexas
A&M.
Stanford's bonfires used
palettes of wood stacked to form a
pyramid and were always wider
than they were tall.
Texas A&M's bonfire, in con
trast. was built of logs stacked up
ward and supported by a center
pole.
It had reached 40 of its planned
60-foot height before the collapse.
The fire was designed to collapse in
on itself as it burned.
Because of the differences in the
structures of the two bonfires. (irif
fen doubted that this bonfire col
lapse would affect the future ol
bonfires in Lake Lagunita. Ac
cording to him, there are "many
other issues" preventing bonfires
in the lake bed.
The Texas A&M tragedy will
have little effect on the future of
bonfires at Stanford, according to
students and administrators.
Wais also called the bonfire col
lapse "a moot issue" as it relates to
the future of fires in the lake. He
noted that the University's Sep
tember 1997 decision to stop the
bonfires was based solely on envi
ronmental issues.
He also mentioned significant
differences between the two bon
fires.
"The two events are like night
and day because of the size and
scope of the bonfires," he said.

"The only common thread is that
there is a lire. Stanford's is so much
smaller and is completely differ
ent.
"The focus has been and always
will be to have a safe and fun Hig
Game rally."
According to Wais, Stanford
takes many precautions to ensure
that its bonfires result in no injuries
and no property damage. The Uni
versity follows a strict protocol and
consults with the fire chief each
year.
The size of the current bonfire,
approximately 64 cubic feet, is too
small to allow a tragedy like that in
Texas.
Also, representatives from the
fire department are present at all
times when the Stanford bonfire is
burning.
News reports indicate that no
supervisors were present when the
bonfire at Texas A&M collapsed.
