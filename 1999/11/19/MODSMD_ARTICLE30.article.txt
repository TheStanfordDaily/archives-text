King Jr. hang on the walls of Prof. John Rick ford's
office. Perched on his desk are four different dic
tionaries, and books on African American history
and language are crowded on his shelves.
Rickford, who was appointed as the Martin
Luther King Jr. Centennial Professor of Linguistics
and director of the program in African American
Studies in 1998, has played an integral role in cam
pus life since he began teaching at Stanford nearly
20 years ago.
"We grew up tripping over novels and other
works of literature, particularly those by great
black writers." Rickford'sson Russell said.
Russell and his three siblings weren't just trip
ping over books. There were probably a few Stan
ford students who crossed their paths as well.
From 1988 to 1998. Rickford and his wife, An
gela, successfully juggled their family and the needs
of the students in Arroyo and Kimball Hall, Vhere
they served as Resident Fellows for three and seven
years, respectively.
Living in the chaotic dorm environment wasn't
a problem for Rickford. who said he was "accus
tomed to the gregarious environment."
Born in 1949, Rickford grew up the youngest of

10 children in a two-bedroom house in the South
American Co-operative Republic of Guyana.
"This is a man who has a very tight family struc
ture. He's really able to balance family and stu
dents," former student Renee Baker said.
Baker first met Rick ford when she was a senior
at Stanford in 1987. Baker and a friend, Teresa Mc-
Carthy. went to him looking for a linguistic answer
to why a white Irish woman and a black woman
from the Caribbean both use the phraseology: "I do
be going to the store."
Encouraged by Rickford, Baker and McCarthy
went to Barbados that summer to do original field
work.
Baker was hooked. She dropped her aspirations
of being a doctor and in 1997 graduated from Stan
ford with a doctorate in linguistics. She is now a pro
fessor at New York University.
"Every time I start and end a class. I dedicate it
to him. I say my student's are John Rickford's
grandchildren." Baker said. "He is my mentor and
my guide. There is not a word for John Rickford.
He empowers you academically, but also empow
ers you in terms of life."
Rickford takes his role as mentor very seriously.
In high school at Queen's College in Guyana, a
British teacher once brought Rickford into his of
fice and reprimanded him for slipping in class rank
from second to 1 Ith. The teacher caned Rickford
six times, leaving welts on his leg.
However, another young teacher who had re
cently graduated from college with Rickford's
older sister took a more effective approach. Taking
Rickford aside, the teacher insisted Rickford could
do better and encouraged him to stay focused.

"Throughout my life there were individual
teachers who really made a difference. They turned
me around and set me in different directions,"
Rickford said in his melodious C iuyanese accent.
Rickford went on to win the Queen's College
prize for best results on the ()rdinary Level Exams
and earn a scholarship to study in the I Inited States
at UC-Santa Cruz in 19b,S. He was then awarded a
Danforth Graduate Fellowship in 1971 and gradu
ated with a Ph.D. in Linguistics from the Universi
ty of Pennsylvania in 1979.
Rickford's influence has also helped shape the
careers of his children.
"Certainly my desire to write stemmed from
both my father and mother's passion for writing
and for English and literature," Russell said.
Rickford and Russell, who graduated with a de
gree in journalism from Howard University in
1997, have recently finished co-writing a book.
"Spoken Soul: The Story of Black English." that
will be published this winter.
"It's been terrific working with him," Russell
said. "We get along real well because we're both
pretty laid back."
Rickford asked for his son's help writing the
book in an attempt to make his research on African
American Vernacular English more accessible to
the general public.
"Academics arc not very good at communicat
ing to the larger public," Rickford said. "Using
Russell helped me break down my work. I learned
how to reach out, which is so important when you
are talking about ideas that affect millions of peo-
