"We need to really get going with
our games." said head coach l ata
VanDerveer. "We need our team to
really come out and get off to a fast
start."
San Francisco, with five new
freshmen on its squad, is looking to
bounce back from the disappointing
season the team had last vear. With

an overall record of 7-20. the Dons
finished last in the West Coast Con
ference.
But the Dons have made a start in
the right direction. The team won
preseason exhibition games against
the NWBI. All-Stars 70-53 and de
feated Lokomotiva Kosiee of Slova
kia 70-60. Freshman Carey Sauer was
in double figures in both games, scor
ing 12 points against the All-Stars
and 16 points against Slovakia.
"It's good for us that we were
there last year, and we were success
ful last year." VanDerveer said. "But
we know that they will be a better
team and we're going to have to play
very well."
"It's always a challenge when you
open on the road, and it will be a chal
lenge to go up to IJSF."
Perhaps an even greater challenge
awaits the Cardinal when it returns
home to face lowa State. The Cy
clones were ranked first in the Big 12
Conference in preseason polls. They
return their entire squad from last
vear, with a record of 25-8. lowa State

was also a member of the Elite Eight
in last year's NCAA Tournament,
losing to Gedrgia in the Mideast Re
gional Finals, 89-71.
"They have a really excellent
overall team size and they're coming
off of a great year," Van Derveer said.
"It's going to be a challenge for us.
They're really good shooters and
they're really good passers. They
play well together.
"I think it's a great opportunity for
our team. We're excited to play a
team that is that talented. We're real
ly glad they're coming out to play us."
VanDerveer said she feels Stan
ford's exhibition season has not pre
pared the team for the season ahead.
The Cardinal lost its first exhibition
game to the USA Basketball
Women's National Team 101-58, but
won its second against Lokomotiva
Kosice of Slovakia 83-52.
"Both games were too extreme,"
she said. "One was 'we were so much
better than one team," and the other
was 'the other team was so much bet
ter than us.'"
