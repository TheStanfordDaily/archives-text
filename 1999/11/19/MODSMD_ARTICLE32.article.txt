I he No. I Stanford men's swim
team started oil Big Game week in
appropriate fashion, winning five

and Cal State Hakerslicld in a
three-way dual meet at deCiuerre
pool.

MEN'S SWIMMING

â–  Today: No. I Stanford vs. Cal
State-Hakerslield. San Francisco
State, 2:00 p.m.de( iuerre Pool.

The non-scoring double-dis
tance clual meet, a Big Game week
tradition, was a display of the ( ar
dinal's strength, but even more so
ol its endurance. With the distance
of every event doubled, the Stan
ford men knew this meet would be
a test.
"Coach |Skip Kcnncyj just told

us to go into the meet and attack
the events any way we could," said
freshman John Waters. "It was
kind of a new adventure."
Although the Cardinal routine
ly practices by swimming longer
events than it competes in, the team
still did not know what to expect in
its performance and times. Com
peting in distance events for time is
different.
"In practice we swim compara
ble intervals, but not really for
times." Waters said. "We just want
ed to go out with open minds and
no expectations and do the best we
could."
With the exclusion of scoring,
the double-distance meet also
proved to he a relaxing and enjoy
able competition.
"We didn't really have a refer
ence for our times," said sopho
more Reid Gustin. "It's just about
going out there and racing, so it's
pretty fun."
The low-key atmosphere
proved to be a very advantageous
one for Stanford. The Cardinal won
all of the events, with the exception

of the 400-meter breaststroke and
the 400 butterfly. Cal's Andrew
Chan broke the meet record in the
400 breaststroke, while Hiro Sako
da won the 400 butterfly.
Stanford's Reid Gustin set the
tone for the meet by winning the
first event, the 2,000 freestyle. Ju
nior Adam Messner and freshman
(Jreg Long followed closely be
hind, finishing in second and third.
C Justin, a distance specialist, was
excited about the opportunity to
swim longer events.
"I usually swim the mile at prac
tice," he said. "So when I swim the
1.000 free, which is what 1 usually
do at meets, it seems pretty short."
The Cardinal also had a one
two sweep in the 400 freestyle, with
Waters finishing first and junior
Clayton Jones finishing second.
Junior six-time Ail-American
Steven Brown, who usually swims
the 400 individual medley, had an
impressive showing in his first
place finish in the NOO IM. lie beat
Ratapong Sirisanont of Cal, the
1999 Pacific 10 Conference champi
on in the 400 IM. by one-hundredth
of a second. Freshman Randall Bal,
who has recently been dominant in
the 50-freestylc sprint, also contin
ued to shine, winning the 400 back
stroke.
The Cardinal SOO freestyle relay
team of Waters. Jones, Long and
eight-time All-American Messner.
broke both meet and pool records.
Long, the final swimmer in the
relay, pulled away from Cal during
the last !()() yards to assure the Car

dinal of the win.
The Cardinal continues compe
tition today against San Francisco
State and Division II powerhouse
Bakersfield, which is ranked No. 1
in Division II polls. San Francisco
has not gained much experience in
competition this year, only having
two meets under its belt. One of
those encounters was with UC-
Davis last month, where San Fran
cisco State lost 67-135.
Neither San Francisco or Bak
ersfield competed against Stanford
last season, so the Cardinal docs not
know exactly what to expect in the
three-way dual meet.
"People will he playing around

with events and seeing what they
can do," Gustin said. "It will be sort
of an experimental meet."
The format of today's meet will
also be slightly different than usual.
As opposed to yesterday's double
distance meet, several of today's
events will be cut down to a shorter
distance.
"All of the events are probably
going to be a little bit shorter," Bal
said.
If yesterday's relaxed meet
against Cal is any indication of how
the Cardinal will perform in low
key conditions, then it is probably
safe to expect another successful
showine.
