MEN'S SWIMMING

â–  Today: No. I Stanford vs. Cal
State-Hakerslield. San Francisco
State, 2:00 p.m.de( iuerre Pool.

The non-scoring double-dis
tance clual meet, a Big Game week
tradition, was a display of the ( ar
dinal's strength, but even more so
ol its endurance. With the distance
of every event doubled, the Stan
ford men knew this meet would be
a test.
"Coach |Skip Kcnncyj just told

us to go into the meet and attack
the events any way we could," said
freshman John Waters. "It was
kind of a new adventure."
Although the Cardinal routine
ly practices by swimming longer
events than it competes in, the team
still did not know what to expect in
its performance and times. Com
peting in distance events for time is
different.
"In practice we swim compara
ble intervals, but not really for
times." Waters said. "We just want
ed to go out with open minds and
no expectations and do the best we
could."
With the exclusion of scoring,
the double-distance meet also
proved to he a relaxing and enjoy
able competition.
"We didn't really have a refer
ence for our times," said sopho
more Reid Gustin. "It's just about
going out there and racing, so it's
pretty fun."
The low-key atmosphere
proved to be a very advantageous
one for Stanford. The Cardinal won
all of the events, with the exception

of the 400-meter breaststroke and
the 400 butterfly. Cal's Andrew
Chan broke the meet record in the
400 breaststroke, while Hiro Sako
da won the 400 butterfly.
Stanford's Reid Gustin set the
tone for the meet by winning the
first event, the 2,000 freestyle. Ju
nior Adam Messner and freshman
(Jreg Long followed closely be
hind, finishing in second and third.
C Justin, a distance specialist, was
excited about the opportunity to
swim longer events.
"I usually swim the mile at prac
tice," he said. "So when I swim the
1.000 free, which is what 1 usually
do at meets, it seems pretty short."
The Cardinal also had a one
two sweep in the 400 freestyle, with
Waters finishing first and junior
Clayton Jones finishing second.
Junior six-time Ail-American
Steven Brown, who usually swims
the 400 individual medley, had an
impressive showing in his first
place finish in the NOO IM. lie beat
