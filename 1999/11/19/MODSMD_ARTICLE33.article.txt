### Matt Long

Conference champion Cal State-
Bakersfield. Stanford (0-2, 0-2 Pac
-10), who finished seventh in the
league last year, fell 29-10 to the
Roadrunners (2-0,2-0).
"We wrestled well, especially con
sidering [Bakersfield] always fields a
good team, they are always condi
tioned well early in the season," said
Stanford coach Chris Horpel. "We
hung with them and had some good
wins. We were right there knocking
on the door in a few others. I was
pleased we kept up our fighting spirit
throughout the match, even when we
got down."
Winning matches for the Cardinal
were seniors Zach Zimmerer, War
ren McPherson and Clay Hacker
man. Zimmerer is currently ranked

eighth in the nation in the 133-pound
weight class and defeated Anthony
Adame 11 -() in a major decision.
"I feel good about this season. As
a team we will be able to accomplish
some of our goals, such as having a
record above .S(X) in dual meets and
placing in the top four or five at the
Pac-10 tournament," Zimmerer said.
"Personally I want to improve from
last year and be an Ail-American."
Hackerman and McPherson won
in back-to-back matches. Hacker
man defeated lan Helms 8-6 at 165
pounds, and McPherson earned a 10-
5 decision over Nathan Vasquez.
ranked 22nd nationally in the 157-
pound class.
This was a huge match for
McPherson, who sat out the latter
part of last season with a knee injury.
Although it was labeled an upset,
McPherson disagrees.
"I expected to win." he said. "1
feel a lot stronger this year, and didn't

think of it as an upset.
Horpel looks forward to a big year
from McPherson.
"Warren has been right on the
edge," he said. "Last year he wrestled
165 pounds and was on his way to the
NCAA tournament when he was in
jured. Now that he's moved down a
weight class, he will be a surprise to
the league."
McPherson knows his responsi
bility to the team and that he still
needs to improve in some areas.
"1 need to look to score more
team points," he said. "1 usually get
the wins but I need to focus on more
major decisions and pins."
In terms of being unexpected in
the Pac-10, McPherson says that by
the end of the season, especially
when the league tournament rolls
around, he won't be a surprise.
"I've wrestled a lot of guys out
there and they know 1 have a difficult
style to wrestle with," he said.
