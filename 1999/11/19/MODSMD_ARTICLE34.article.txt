# Cardinal travels to UCSB
## 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
To those people who think that No. 9 Stanford, 2-0
after beating Duke and lowa last week in New York
City, should head down the coast tomorrow and walk
away with an easy win against IJC-Santa Barbara, Stan
ford head coach Mike Montgomery has a message.
"Most people are dead-ass wrong," he said. "Teams
lose to other teams from less-publicized conferences all
the time. The names on the front of the jerseys don't
make the player."
Montgomery should know. Though this is his 14th
season at Stanford, Montgomery spent eight years at
Montana in the Big Sky Conference, a mid-major league
on par with Santa Barbara's Big West Conference.

p.m Santa Barbara.

Stanford is in a particularly precarious position be
cause the game at Santa Barbara'sThunderdomc will be
the Cauchos' season opener. Santa Barbara would like
nothing better than to start the year with a home victory
over a top-10 team from the Pacific 10 Conference.
"It's going to be a hostile visiting crowd," Mont
gomery said. "It'll be different than New York or any
where else we'll play before the Pac-10 season. They're
going to be up for the game to beat another team from
California."
At least UCSB thinks it's big. The official media
guide calls the Stanford game "one of the most impor
tant games for the program in many years."
The Gauchos are coming off of a surprising year.
After a disappointing 0-8 start, Santa Barbara shocked
the Big West and finished the year in strong fashion.
Head coach Bob Williams was named the Big West
Coach of the Year after his team went 12-4 in the con
ference and won 15 of its last 20 games.
A strong three-guard set of Derrick Allen, Erick
Ashe and Mark Hull will anchor the team. The quick
ness and ball handling of Allen (6.7 points per game, 4.2
assists per game) and Ashe (4.3 assists per game), who
both ended last season as starters, could give Stanford
problems.
Since Santa Barbara has yet to play a game, Stan
ford's preparation will be hurt a bit. Coaches will only be
able to look at the Gauchos' games from last year. But,
Santa Barbara has two Stanford games to pick apart.
"We don't know what we're going to face," Mont
gomery said. "We're going to have to play straight up
against them to start out."
To do that, Stanford will have to go with what worked
in Madison Square Garden: establishing the inside game
to open up shots on the perimeter.
Without senior forward Mark Madsen, who will stay
on the bench with a strained hamstring for another
month at least, Stanford pounded the ball inside to Jar
ron and Jason Collins. The Collinses came through.

combining for 35 points and 22 rebounds. When lowa
tried to contain them, freshman wingman Casey Jacob
sen took over by scoring 17 points 12 off of three-point
ers.
"From the start [against lowa], we had to establish
Jason as a force," said junior point guard Mike McDon
ald. "That created a lot of kickouts. We're going to have
to continue doing that."
This strategy could be especially effective against the
Gauchos. Though Santa Barbara has some depth in the
frontcourt, they are also young and inexperienced.
But, as Montgomery warned, that might not matter.
For a program just trying to establish its name within the
Big West, a win against the defending Pac-10champions
could be huge — big headlines in California newspapers,
a little national publicity, maybe even a mention on
Sports Center.
For Santa Barbara, nothing could be nicer.
