## 
### Sarah Heim Contributing writer 
After the fanfare of Big Game
on Saturday, students can come to
cheer the Stanford women's crew
on to victory at the final race of the
fall season.
The Bair Island Regatta will be
held on Sunday at the Parkside
Aquatic Center in Foster City.
"It sounds like Cal won't be
there this year," said head coach
Aimee Baker. Although the field
won't be as competitive as it has
been in the other races this fall, the
team will be racing against a hand
ful of master's crews from around
the peninsula.
The varsity eight will race on the
"very curvy" course at 8 a.m., fol
lowed by the JV at 11:30 a.m.
The novice boat, whieh will be
competing for the first time this
season, will race at 9:20 a.m.
"They're all very excited," said
novice and assistant varsity coach
; Kristine Franson. "They're just ex
-1 cited to race against other teams."
! The novice team is composed of

18 members. All of the members
are walk-ons and most do not have
any previous rowing experience.
Recruiting for the novice team
will continue through January.
"We're still looking for good
athletes and if people are interest
ed in rowing it's not too late. If
there are any athletes out there
who are settled into school and feel
like they're missing something,
they can contact me," Franson said.
"We've always had someone
who has come on in January and
was a great athlete and made the
first boat." she added.
The first novice eight will travel
and compete in all the races the
varsity team rows in this spring.
The second novice boat will
compete in all the raees that are
close to campus.
The novice boat racing in this
weekend's regatta is made up of
members from all classes — there is
one senior, two juniors, one sopho
more and five freshmen.
After a year on the novice team,
there is always the opportunity for
members to move up to the varsity

squad the following year.
"I like to encourage the top ath
letes to come back," Franson said.
"We've had a pretty high return
rate."
All the rowers from last year's
novice first boat returned this year,
along with two from the second
boat. One member of this year's
varsity eight was on the novice
team last year.
I'his weekend's regatta will not
only be a chance for the novice
rowers to compete for the first
time, but it will also be the last
chance for the team to build morale
before heading into intense winter
training.
After disappointing finishes for
the varsity and JV eights at last
weekend's Head of the Lake in
Seattle, the women's crew will look
to regain speed and confidence
over the weekend.
"Our team knows what the
score is. We'll be expected to win
this race," Baker said. "We're al
ready very focused on winter train
ing and what we need to accom
plish."
