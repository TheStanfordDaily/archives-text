# Cardinal battles Bears in 102 nd Big Game
## Stanford seeks final Pacific 10 Conference victory to clinch Rose Bowl berth. 
### TNM KANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the second-to-last defense
in the country, a 69-17 drubbing at
the hands of Texas, and a home loss

to lowly San Jose State, any sane
person would think the Stanford
football team wouldn't be any
where near a bowl game, right?
Think again.
In a wacky year in the Pacific l()
Conference, the Cardinal (6-3. 6-1
Pac-lO) has not only assured itself
of playing in a bowl game, but en
ters Big Game against California
(4-6, 3-4) with a chance to play in
the granddaddy of them all. the
Rose Bowl. Yes, the Rose Bowl
a game Stanford hasn't played in

since the l l )7l season, back when
Nixon was president and Stanford
head coach Tyrone Willingham
was a skinny 17-year old in North
Carolina.,
The Cardinal has UCLA to
thank for creating the situation, as
the Bruins dispatched Washington
in overtime 23-20 last Saturday,
leaving Stanford in control of its
own destiny. Stanford took advan
tage of Washington's stumble and
outgunned Arizona State 50-30 in
Tempe. Ariz.. Saturday night to re

gain sole possession of first place in
the conference, a full game ahead
of Washington and Oregon.
Stanford is assured of finishing
no worse than third in the confer
ence, and the Pac-Ill's top five
teams have guaranteed bowl
berths. If you were to ask any play
er on the football team, however,
they probably wouldn't profess a
childhood dream of going to the
C'ulligan Holiday Bowl or the
Wells largo Sun Bowl, the destina
tions for the second- and third

place teams, respectively.
Cal, meanwhile, will come into
Stanford Stadium playing purely to
spoil Stanford's Rose Bowl hopes,
as the Golden Bears were eliminat
ed from bowl contention following
their 24-1 y loss to Oregon last
week. C'nl will be without the ser
vices of freshman quarterback
Kyle Boiler, who separated his
shoulder against Oregon and will
miss Biu Game. Senior Wcs Dal-
ton, a former walk-on who was
third on Cal's depth ehart at the
beginning of the year, will make
the start in Boiler's plaee.
Dalton certainly isn't short on
confidence coming in to his final
Big Game, the first in which he will
participate. "I've been here five
years. I've gone through more of
fenses than most NFL players. So 1
know exactly what to read and
what to look f0r.... I've taken
more practice snaps than probably
any quarterback in this program. I
feel very comfortable in the center,
and I think I see the field pretty
well for the most part," Dalton
said.
Todd Husak, in comparison, is
coming off perhaps his most effec
tive performance of the year at
Arizona State. Stanford's senior

three other

Casey Moore.
Stanford's high-powered of
fense, ranked fourth nationally,
will get its toughest test since
Texas in Cal's stout defense, which
features playmakers such as senior
linebacker Sekou Sanyika and se
nior cornerback Deltha O'Neal
and is ranked first in the confer
ence. The usually suspect Cardinal
defense may finally be able to con
tain an offense, with Cal ranked
last in the conference and an unim
pressive \()y out of 114 teams.
Naturally, Willingham doesn't
view Cal purely from a statistical
standpoint.
"I'm expecting them, because it is
the Big Game and because this will
be the 102 nd meeting of the Big
Game, that they will bring forth their
best effort and their best energy, and
I'm equally confident that our young
men will bring forth our best efforts
and our best energies into this ball
game." Willingham said.
Cal head coach Tqm Holmoe
shares Willingham's point of view.
"If people are wondering if Ore
gon blew out the candle on Cal's
season — yeah, we are not going to
go to a bowl game. That's a fact.
But I don't think you can count this
team out in 'The Big Game'. They
still have a lot to play for."
Certainly O'Neal will give the
Cardinal fits. Against Oregon, the
senior cornerback returned an inter
ception 1(H) yards for a touchdown
his fourth interception return for
a touchdown this season, a new
NCAA record. O'Neal may face off
against Walters in what is sure to be
a phenomenal secondary battle.
On the injury front, Willingham
said receivers Davis and Pitts, both
of whom left the Arizona State
game with injuries, are still day-to
day and have not had their status for
the game determined. Freshman
running back Kerry Carter, who has
been out for two weeks since sprain
ing his ankle in Washington, will
also be evaluated later in the week.
Stanford is considered the fa
vorite this Saturday, but it is pre
cisely for that reason that Cal has a
good chance to knock off the Car
dinal. in a year where the only sure
thing is that nothing makes any
sense in the Pac-10.
