# Cardinal battles Bears in 102 nd Big Game
## Stanford seeks final Pacific 10 Conference victory to clinch Rose Bowl berth. 
### TNM KANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the second-to-last defense
in the country, a 69-17 drubbing at
the hands of Texas, and a home loss

to lowly San Jose State, any sane
person would think the Stanford
football team wouldn't be any

Cal, meanwhile, will come into
Stanford Stadium playing purely to
spoil Stanford's Rose Bowl hopes,
as the Golden Bears were eliminat

their 24-1 y loss to Oregon last
week. C'nl will be without the ser
