Big (lame is always a big game.
But this year, it's momentous.
Plain and simple: if the Cardinal wins to
morrow. it will assure itself its first Rose Bowl
appearance in 2«S years. Stanford loses, and,
chances are. it will be the Sun Bowl in I I Paso.
Texas, or the Holiday Bowl in San Diego.
Both are respectable bowl games. But the
' Rose Bowl is... well, the Rose Bowl.
But to hear the Cardinal tell it. you might
think Big C iame is just another game.
"All these games have been big," said se
nior wideout Troy Walters at the pre-Big
Game press conference Monday. "We don't

Walters has a point. (letting "caught up in
the hype" might be a dangerous proposition,
because logically the hype is huge.

Rose Bowl was Jan. I. 1972. when the team
was still called the Indians. The Indians had
also gone to Pasadena a year earlier, after the
1970 season.
But in both seasons. Stanford's Rose Bowl
appearances had been guaranteed before the
season-ending Big Game had taken, place.
Those Big Games were only about Bay-Area
bragging rights.

the Big Game had even a chance of going to
the Rose Bowl was in 1975. Gerald lord was

And the last time the winner of the Big

Rose Bowl was in 1953. Dwight Eisenhower.

" That |a Rose Bowl appearanee|
is something that hasn't happened in

Willingham. about as animated as
Willingham has ever been. "That
means a great deal to the program, to
the University and most importantly
to the individuals involved in playing
the game."
Willingham, notoriously undei

hype as well. But there have been a
few telltale cracks in his usually-con

said senior quarterback lodd

And when a reporter asked at
Monday's press conference il he was
excited about his team, he paused,

But Willingham sees two prob

hut also a distraction to players trying
to get the joh done on the field.
"It jlist depends on what person
you're talking to, and what their
frame of mind is and how they view
that particular focus," Willingham
said. "II we have guys that think ...
that we're already there at the Rose
Bowl, then it's a distraction. If we
have guys that believe this will he
something significant in their life and
use it as motivation, then it will he a
tremendous motivator."
Willingham is also concerned that

might cloud the fact that C'al — while

"We understand the magnitude

" lb look ahead would he a mistake."
Willingham will leave that up to
