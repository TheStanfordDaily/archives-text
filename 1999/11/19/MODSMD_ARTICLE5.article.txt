# Big Game security raised
## New measures enacted in hopes of keeping students from charging playing field in game's aftermath 
### Anne Cortina 
Students caught up in the excite
ment of Rig Game will have a much
more difficult time rushing the field
tor ;i postganie celebration this year.
New security measures, prompt
ed by concerns of student safety and
the destruction of the playing fields
in the past two Big Games, include
magnetically sealed fences, roped
off seats in the first 10 rows of each
student section and Stanford police
stationed inside the fence to deter
any potential lield-rushers.
Hob ( arruesco. athletic director
of marketing and ticket operations,
said enforcement of the security is
sues will include ;i camera to take pic
tures of students who rush onto the
field, and those students will be ar
rested bv the police, constituting a
Fundamental Standard violation.
Junior Jeff Cooper, a yell leader
who lias been silting in 011 recent
meetings of the committee planning
the new security measures, said
members of Stanford's C )ffice of the

Dean i)l" Students and UC-Berke
lev's Office of Student Conduct will
deal with students whose actions are
non-criminal, hut considered inap
propriate.
" The whole reason for this is stu
dent safety." Carruesco said. "It's
been our directive to see that stu
dents don't get hurt."
In order to inform students about
the new policies, the safety commit
tee has been running advertisements
in The Daily specifying the conse
quences of violating the security
rules, and members of the Axe Com
mittee have been visiting dorms'
house meetings to discuss the new
policies with students.
Two years ago, the last time Stan
loal hosted Big Game, Stanford stu
dents pushed up against the fence,
forcing the police to open the gate for
the safety of the students. The stu
dents from UC- Berkeley tore down
the gate in front of their cheering sec
tion and destroyed a goalpost,
among other damage.
"We have videotapes. You can

see the ugliness of it all," Carruesco
said.
The hopes of the safety commit
tee are that this year, students will
stay in the stands for the post game
celebration. Other participants ol
Big Game, including the yell leaders
and the Band, are being advised by
the Athletic Department about theii
behavior during the game.
"I think it's silly to think that the
Band's going to incite anything,"
Carruesco said.
Carruesco's concerns, instead,
are for the Band's sake. Should a riot
occur on the field, the Band could be
held responsible for the actions if
they had given a show that in anyway
inspired potentially dangerous or de
structive actions, Carruesco said.
Similar advice was given to yell
leaders. After the 19% Big Game,
there were allegations that a Cal veil
leader incited fans to rush to the
field, screaming "Kill the Tree," ac
cording to C oopcr.
