Big Game tradition
bridges the gap
between older and
younger generations
Jordan Spence had his red
shades on.
1 lis little legs hung over the rusty
metal bar that sits atop the four-font
high chain-linked fence surrounding
Stanford's football practice field.
Leaning back with the type of trust
only a child could possess, the six
year old placed all of his weight on
his grandfather. Bill Ritter. Stanford
MBA Class of 1955.
" This is one of my great pas
sions." Ritter explained, watching
the team more closely than he
watched his own grandson. "I've
been watching Stanford football
since I came here in "52."
Jordan ignored the excitement in
his grandfather's tone, instead fo
cusing on Troy Walters, as there-
I ceiver ran a pass-pattern against an
innocent, second-siring ('ardinal de
fender.
"This is a high-class rivalry." Rit
ter proudly continued.
Ritter was there for Stanford's
two Rose Bowl berths in the '70s and
he has been there for head coach.
I and personal friend. Tyrone Willing
ham's perfect record against the ("al

ifornia Bears.
But Jordan didn't seem to care.
"Can we throw the football
around yet?" he yelped.
Ritter laughed and tried to divert
the child's attention one last time.
"Look, there is your friend Kent
Baer." Ritter said, pointing to Stan
lord's defensive coordinator.
Baer waved at Jordan, who now
recklessly tossed a little black-and
red football into the air. attempting
to catch it from his awkward perch
on the metal railing.
Finally, with a good-natured
laugh, the smiling grandfather
picked up Jordan to go play, while
waiting for the endless days to pass
before he can go to yet another Big
Game.
I can't help but stare at Ritter and
wonder.
Two years ago. while working in
the Stanford Athletics Department.
I received a letter from a kind man a
few weeks after the 100 th Big Game.
I do not recall his name nor can 1 re
member the year in which he gradu
ated from Stanford. What I do re
member. however, is the excitement
with which he wrote of Big Game
and how much the rivalry was a part
of his life.
As was cancer.
The man was crushed. He had
been advised by a physician not to
attend the 100 th Big Game, for his
battle with cancer was far more im

portant than the battle with the
Bears.
Of course he understood this, but
that didn't take away from the pain
in missing a tradition that was such a
large part of his life.
All he from me was a pro
gram. 1 le was willing to pay whatev
er amount it took, for he knew a pro
gram for the centennial game would
be hard to come by.
The shaky handwriting and the
well-written letter were extremely
touching, and I felt for him like I
would for a dear friend. t
My office had only two programs
remaining.
We sent him one. free of charge,
with a simple note:
"Good luck. We know it must be
hard, hut we are confident that you
will win your big game and be back
in Stanford Stadium soon."
As I looked at Ritter, I wanted to
hear him say how. as big a fan as he is.
he had unfortunately missed the 1997
season. I wanted to know that the
man from the letter is fine, enjoying
this tradition again, just like all of us.
Instead. Ritter told me how he

had attended every Big Game since
1 <->52.
I le was not the man I was looking
for.
1 can't ask everyone. But every
year, I will wonder, as 1 gaze into the
alumni section at Stanford Stadium,
if the man whose letter 1 received is
hack: if he won his battle and is
proudly looking on as the Stanford
football players win theirs.
College football rivalries are
strange. They bring out strong, un
explainable emotions in people.
1 low a person can think about a
game while battling for his life as
tounds me.
And yet. it serves as a reminder
that this game isn't just about us â€”
the current students. It is about
every person who feels a strong loy
alty to this school. It is about the fact
that people can forget the bigger
problems in their lives, if just for a
moment, while relishing in a game, a
historic rivalry and a victory that is as
much theirs as it is that of the foot
ball players.
As Hitter lifted up his grandson, I
asked him where he would be sitting
at this year's game.
"The alumni section," Ritter
replied.
Hopefully near a dear friend of
mine.
