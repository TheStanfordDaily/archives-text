During the Stanford football season, it is com
monly heard around campus that the football team
plays two seasons each year the first 10 games
and Big Game.
Big Game is a storied rivalry between Stanford
and California that defies all odds and ignores all
logic. Nobody on earth ever knows who will win
the game. F or Stanford and Cal fans. Big Game
transcends the sport of football.
Perhaps the year that best exemplifies the pro
found meaning of Big Game is 14N2. That year.
John I Iway. playing in what turned out to be his
last Stanford game, led the Cardinal offense down
the field late in the fourth quarter. With only four
seconds left in the game. Mark 1 larmon kicked a
35-yard field goal to put Stanford up 20-l l ).
While the game was already being heralded as
one of the best ever, the final four seconds have be
come arguably the most memorable in college
football history, forever to be known as simply
The Play."

at the Bears' 43-yard line. Immediately, the Cal re
turn team formed up like a rugby squad. Hvery Cal
player who touched the ball quickl\ lateraled it to
a teammate as soon as he was about to be tackled
(or. in at least one ease, as replays clearly showed,
after the ball carrier had been tackled).
After five laterals. Moen ended up with the ball
again and sprinted into the end /one. running
through the premature celebration of the Stanford
Band. Chaos reigned in Berkeley as ( al claimed a
touchdown on the return, while Stanford insisted
that one of the ball carriers had been downed.
After several minutes of discussion, the officials
awarded the touchdown and the game to Cal by the
score of 25-20. though Stanford fans still remember
the score as Stanford 20. ('al 14.
Throughout the past two decades. Big Game
has become a wav for Stanford fans to forget about

the first 10 games of the season and to demonstrate
Stanford's superiority over its long-time rival, rep
resenting the salvation of Stanford's football sea
son. I lowever. outside the campuses of Stanford
and Cal. Big C iame has become overshadowed by
nationally televised football games and profession
al sports.
Yet. Big (iame used to have a tremendous im
pact not only for the two Bav-Area rivals but also
for the entire West Coast. Because the Bay area
did not have any professional sports at the turn of
the century. Big (iame became the biggest sporting
event on the West Coast for many years, drawing
thousands of fans from all over ( alifornia.
I lie 101 -game-old series began during the 1891 -
1892 school year after a veteran California football
team challenged newborn Stanford I 'ni\crsity to a
football game in the fall of 1891. John Whittemore.
a transfer student who began toorgani/e a football
team at Stanford, declined the challenge at first but
later accepted it during the spring.
Hie two schools met at a sandlot near Haight
and Stanyan Streets in San Francisco on March 14.
1892. About 20.000 spectators crowded the field
that day as Stanford student manager I Icrbert
Hoover collected more than $30,000 in tickets at
the gate.
The game was about to begin when the referee
discovered that neither club brought a football to
the field (some sources say that it was I loovcr who
forgot to bring the ball). Luckily, the owner of a
local sporting goods store was in the crowd and
while he rode off on horseback to get a ball, the
crowd waited anxiously for more than an hour.
()nce the game started. Stanford leaped out to a
14-0 lead and held on for a 14-10 upset of the heav
ily favored and much more experienced Cal squad,
beginning Stanford's long-standing tradition of de
feating the Golden Bears.
Even then. Cal fans found ways to justify their
losses. Following a controversial Stanford touch
down in 1894. a Cal student newspaper reporter
commented. "(Stanford] won by a fluke and a ref
eree ... that is the only just verdict that can be
passed. I do not mean to insinuate that the referee
was in any way influenced to take a Stanford view
of the game: but I do mean he does not know a
touchdown when he sees it."
Perhaps tired of losing to Stanford at football.

Cal proposed to change the sport of the Big Game
from football to rugby in 1404. Fearing that foot
ball was too violent. Cal President Benjamin
Wheeler validated Cal's nickname — "The Wee
nies" — when he said. "The game of football must
be entirely made over or go."
Therefore, from 1906 to 1914, rugby, an appar
ently less aggressive sport back then, became the
official sport of Big Game. Stanford also dominat
ed Cal at rugby, posting a 5-3-1 record.
During the 1920' sand 1930'5. the popularity of
Big Game grew tremendously throughout the
West Coast, forcing the Cardinal to build Stanford
