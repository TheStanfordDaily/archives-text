# Beating up on the Bears
## Big Game energizes Stanford with Cardinal spirit 
### JEFF COOPER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Wrap your mind around this statement: 1999
could be the best year in the history of Stanford
sports.
I say that knocking furiously on wood, under
stand. The gods of sports are fickle, and Red Sox
fans know that they despise the arrogant.
But consider: no school in the Pacific l() Con
ference has ever won the conference champi
onship in football, men's basketball and baseball
in the same year.
Consider then. Stanford has what many con
sider a better than odds-on chance to do that this
year.
Consider that every women's sport compet
ing regularly in the Pac-l()in the fall (cross coun
try, soccer. volleyball, swimming and basketball)
has either won. is on the verge of winning, or has
a tremendous shot at winning the conference this
year.
The Sears Cup domination has been noted.
The Sports Illustrated covers have been filed
away. But to own a conference like this is un
heard of. As a fan. I'm as bloated and fat on my
24 hours of college sports coverage a day as any
other sports junkie in this day and age. But for
the rest of the jaded fans out there. I offer this
it's a special time to be here.
Focusing on the task at hand ...
This Big Game is a huge piece of this giant
puzzle of achievement called "Stanford Athlet
ics." And like all Big Games, it's charged with
much more than football.
It's charged with a great and storied rivalry.

extending back more than a century and encom
passing several of the greatest finishes in the his
tory of college football.
It's charged with the flying clods of turf, bro
ken goalposts and hurled insults of the last few
years' postgames.
It's charged with dozens of successful and
failed attempts to wrest the symbol of the rivalry,
the Stanford Axe. from each other's arms, by any
means other than football. I .et us remember the
Immortal 21. without whose immortal fakc-pho
tographer-stun-'cm-with-a-flash-and-grab raid
the Axe might never have been recovered after
its initial theft a century ago.
The Axe is perhaps the best symbol possible
for a rivalry like this. Most traditional rivalry
games like Big Game — Oregon's Civil War.
Washington's Apple Cup, I larvard-Yalc. IJSC-
I K LA — don't have such a tangible, and oddly
appropriate, embodiment of the rivalry.
The Axe is wonderful not only for its history
though the history of its thefts and re-thefts
reads like the very definition of a great college ri
valry — but for its very person. It's a weapon,
first and foremost. Its first use was to decapitate
a blue-and-gold-clad bear effigy.
Listen to our cheers. "Give 'em the Axe.
where? Right in the neck!" That's fantastic! If I
brought out a symbolic oaken nightstick at Big
Game this weekend and used it to beat the be
jeezus (nit of a Cal effigy. I'd be banned from the
stadium forever for inciting riots. If I yelled,
"Give 'em a hot load of armor-piercing lead right
between the eyes!" they'd kick me out of the
school. But yet the athletic department smiles as
students locked to this enormous, limb-severing

Discmbowcl-o-matic stroll blithely onto the
field. That's the triumph of tradition.
I've never known what losing the Axe feels
like. But I know what having it feels like. The
owner of the Axe says. "Come challenge me, you
pitiful excuse for a rival school, and 1 will leave
your entrails strewn across my doorstep." The
owner of the Axe says, "We've got the Axe."
And that's a great cheer.
Most days of the year, the Axe never crosses
my mind. But this year, when Big Game is mak
ing headlines in national publications, and keep
ing the Axe seems the first step in a domino chain
of success in which everyone who loves the Car
dinal can be a part. I can't keep it out of my head.
What this year's football team has done to the
campus borders on the absurd. The energy is
everywhere. I can only imagine what things will
be like if we win. All the fans out here owe a debt
to the gods of football and. more critically, to the
team, its coaches and its support staff.
And. conveniently, we can give back some
thing unique — a home field.
I've said it before in these pages, but it bears
repeating: when the team you love does well, and
you give them all you've got from the stands, the
game is better for the both of you.
The goal for us on the sidelines and in the
stands this weekend is to be a factor. It's rare in
the real world that you find such clear and simple
crossroads. Times such as these arc the reason
why organized sports exist- they're designed to
create such moments.
If we can help the football team get where
they want to go more than anywhere else ...
that's a special gift, for both them and us.
