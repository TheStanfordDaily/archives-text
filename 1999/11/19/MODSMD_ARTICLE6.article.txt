# Students' free copy spree draws to a close
## 
### Marianna Stacey Lopez 
Students will soon cease to reap the benefits of free
copies in University libraries. While copies have been
free for the majority of the quarter. Don Intersimone,
University manager ol I acilities and Space Planning,
reports that "all copy machines will be fully supplied
with charging equipment within the coming days."
The free copies are a result of Stanford's transition
from its contract with Ikon Office Solutions to a new
contract with Xerox. According to Karen Nau\.

deputy I 'niversity librarian, "the change in contracts is
due to the fact that |Stanford's| contract was up with
Ikon, and Xerox seemed to be a better lit to our
needs."
('urrcnllv. all 52 copy machines throughout campus
are free of charge. However. Stanford is not losing
money over the logistical transition. According to
Nagv. "Xerox is absorbing all the costs of this transi
tion."
