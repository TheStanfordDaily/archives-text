## 
### Marianna Stacey Lopez 
Students will soon cease to reap the benefits of free
copies in University libraries. While copies have been
free for the majority of the quarter. Don Intersimone,
University manager ol I acilities and Space Planning,
reports that "all copy machines will be fully supplied
with charging equipment within the coming days."
The free copies are a result of Stanford's transition
from its contract with Ikon Office Solutions to a new
contract with Xerox. According to Karen Nau\.

deputy I 'niversity librarian, "the change in contracts is
due to the fact that |Stanford's| contract was up with
Ikon, and Xerox seemed to be a better lit to our
needs."
('urrcnllv. all 52 copy machines throughout campus
are free of charge. However. Stanford is not losing
money over the logistical transition. According to
Nagv. "Xerox is absorbing all the costs of this transi
tion."

The free copying in Green Library, which many students have taker, advantage of, will soon be ending.
Although the switch in vendors
affects everyone in general, stu
dents will be particularly impacted
once the equipment is installed.
The copy machines will no longer
accept copy cards.
"Negotiations with the Stanford
ID Card Office and the Stanford
Bursar's Office have been under
way in hopes of facilitating student
use of the copy machines," Nagy
said
As Intersimone describes it,
"the results of the negotiations
[will result] in a system similar to
the points system for students. Stu
dents will now be able to put
money on their SUID cards either
by going to the Bursar's Office or
by using the DART machines lo
cated in the libraries.
"Those who still have money on
their IKON cards will be able to
transfer funds to their SUID cards
by going to the Bursar's Office. For
those who do not possess ID cards

— i.e. visiting scholars, etc. — the
exchange will take place when they
present a picture ID to librarians,"
said Intersimone.
Students using their SUID
cards will pay K cents per copy,
while others using coins will pay 10
cents per copy.
"The better price for students
will hopefully serve as an incentive
for students to use their ID cards
rather than coins," Intersimone
said.
While Xerox and Stanford offi
cials are eager to have the new sys
tem in place, not all students are
happy about the change.
Sophomore Sarah Koehler said,
"Free copies have saved me $10
this quarter. If you're in a section
that requires you to provide read
ing summaries for the entire sec
tion. the cost of copying can get a
little expensive."
Although it is not yet certain
when the new coin and card equip
ment will be installed, Intersimone
said, "Xerox is working very hard
to have the new system in place as
soon as possible."
