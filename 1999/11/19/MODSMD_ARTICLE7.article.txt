# Gaieties writer and producer reveals secrets behind scenes â€” and why Branner sucks
## 
### Margaux Hall 
In a night with loud music and
lines of streaking students, hundreds
of freshmen shamelessly lock lips
with the closest upperclassman.
While this may he a mainstream
experience for a Stanford student
during lull Moon on the Quad, lor
Gaieties writer and director Lauren
Phillips, such a moment is a quintes
sential "sketeh-fest" and source ol in
spiration for the yearly Gaieties pro
duction.
"When I 'm standing around cam
pus. I look for the things that are
stereotypically Stanford." said
Phillips,acoterminal student in inter

national policy study, of the process
of creating the show.
As part of a team of nine writers.
Phillips has been working on the pro
duction since March. She said she ap
proached writing the script as starting
with a blank slate, but with an entire
history of productions to inspire her.
"You recreate something that's
been around for NO years in a new and
unique way." Phillips said.
She added that the production's
purpose is to emphasize what the
Stanford community loves about the
I Iniversity and what makes the Stan
ford experience so distinctive.
"Since 4,(XX) people come to the
show, each with a very personal Stan
ford experience, you want to general
ize your experience tosomethingthat
each of the 4,000 other people can re
late to," she said.
To this effect, the show's writers
brainstormed a wide range of possi
bilities when they designed the show.
Their creative fuel came not only
from their own Stanford experiences,
but also from pop culture and media,
such as films.
Phillips emphasized, however,
that it is only when her characters
come to life that the show really takes
its true form.
" The show is less about the plot
than about the individuals," she said.
I he show's 34 cast members came
into the production scene six weeks

ago from a wide variety of back
grounds.
" This year's cast is the most talent
ed group I have ever seen," said
Phillips, who served as a cast member
herself in the 1997 and 1998 produc
tions. "Their energy is amazing."
For the six weeks leading up to the
show, the cast members transformed
their identities into an abundance of
characters during 20-hour-pcr-week
rehearsals. The show's directors and
producers, in the final weeks before
the show, were devoting around 12
hours per day to the show, according
to Phillips.
Cast member Adrian Guzman, a
freshman, agreed that this year's cast
devoted its full energy to the produc
tion.
"Sleep.. . what'ssleep?"Guzman
said. "I think I can speak for the en
tire cast when 1 say that sleep has
taken second priority to rehearsals."
Guzman added, however, that the

synthesis of everyone's hard efforts
makes the time commitment well jus
tified. "It's so completely worth it
when you see the show come togeth
er," he said.
Tonight's performance in particu
lar should hold some surprises for all
those who are seeing it, including
Phillips, who will be sitting in the au
dience.
"The cast always changes some
things," said Phillips, who adds that
the final performance has a reputa
tion as being the cast's opportunity to
expand on their characters' roles.
Phillips said the show has under
gone a significant evolution from
when she first created the script with
the other writers.
"Right now, the show is the cam
pus' and the cast's show," she said.
"The characters are on page, and 1
wrote them, but depending on who
gets them, the characters completely
transform and come to life."
