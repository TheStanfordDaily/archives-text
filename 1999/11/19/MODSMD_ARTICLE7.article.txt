## 
### Margaux Hall 
In a night with loud music and
lines of streaking students, hundreds
of freshmen shamelessly lock lips
with the closest upperclassman.
While this may he a mainstream
experience for a Stanford student
during lull Moon on the Quad, lor
Gaieties writer and director Lauren
Phillips, such a moment is a quintes
sential "sketeh-fest" and source ol in
spiration for the yearly Gaieties pro
duction.
"When I 'm standing around cam
pus. I look for the things that are
stereotypically Stanford." said
Phillips,acoterminal student in inter

national policy study, of the process
of creating the show.
As part of a team of nine writers.
Phillips has been working on the pro
duction since March. She said she ap
proached writing the script as starting
with a blank slate, but with an entire
history of productions to inspire her.
"You recreate something that's
been around for NO years in a new and
unique way." Phillips said.
She added that the production's
purpose is to emphasize what the
Stanford community loves about the
I Iniversity and what makes the Stan
ford experience so distinctive.
