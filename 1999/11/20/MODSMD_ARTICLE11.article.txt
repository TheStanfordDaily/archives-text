# Storied rivalry extends for more than a century
## 101 -game-old series has witnessed its share of thilling moments, plays and players 
### SAMEER AHMED CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
During the Stanford football season, it is com
monly heard around campus that the football team
plays two seasons each year the first 10 games
and Big Game.

Big Game is a storied rivalry between Stanford
and California that defies all odds and ignores all
logic. Nobody on earth ever knows who will win
the game. For Stanford and Cal fans, Big Game
transcends the sport of football.
Perhaps the year that best exemplifies the pro
found meaning of Big Game is 1982. That year,
John Elway, playing in what turned out to be his
last Stanford game, led the Cardinal offense down
the field late in the fourth quarter. With only four
seconds left in the game, Mark Harmon kicked a
35-yard field goal to put Stanford up 20-19.
While the game was already being heralded as
one of the best ever, the final four seconds have be
come arguably the most memorable in college
football history, forever to be known as simply
"The Play."

Cal's Kevin Moen received the Stanford kickoff
at the Bears' 43-yard line. Immediately, the Cal re
turn team formed up like a rugby squad. Every Cal
player who touched the ball quickly lateraled it to
a teammate as soon as he was about to be tackled
(or, in at least one case, as replays clearly showed,
after the ball carrier had been tackled).
After five laterals, Moen ended up with the ball
again and sprinted into the end zone, running
through the premature celebration of the Stanford
Band. Chaos reigned in Berkeley as Cal claimed a
touchdown on the return, while Stanford insisted
that one of the ball carriers had been downed.
After several minutes of discussion, the officials
awarded the touchdown and the game to Cal by the
score of 25-20, though Stanford fans still remember
the score as Stanford 20, Cal 19.
Throughout the past two decades. Big Game
has become away for Stanford fans to forget about

the first 10 games of the season and to demonstrate
Stanford's superiority over its long-time rival, rep
resenting the salvation of Stanford's football sea
son. However, outside the campuses of Stanford
and Cal, Big Game has become overshadowed by
nationally televised football games and profession
al sports.

Yet, Big Game used to have a tremendous im
pact not only for the two Bay-Area rivals but also
for the entire West Coast. Because the Bay area
did not have any professional sports at the turn of
the century, Big Game became the biggest sporting
event on the West Coast for many years, drawing
thousands of fans from all over California.
The 101-game-old series began during the 1891-
1892 school year after a veteran California football
team challenged newborn Stanford University to a
football game in the fall of 1891. John Whittemore,
a transfer student who began to organize a football
team at Stanford, declined the challenge at first but
later accepted it during the spring.
The two schools met at a sandlot near Haight
and Stanyan Streets in San Francisco on March 19,
1892. About 20,000 spectators crowded the field
that day as Stanford student manager Herbert
Hoover collected more than $30,000 in tickets at
the gate.
The game was about to begin when the referee
discovered that neither club brought a football to
the field (some sources say that it was Hoover who
forgot to bring the ball). Luckily, the owner of a
local sporting goods store was in the crowd and
while he rode off on horseback to get a ball, the
crowd waited anxiously for more than an hour.
Once the game started, Stanford leaped out to a
14-0 lead and held on for a 14-10 upset of the heav
ily favored and much more experienced Cal squad,
beginning Stanford's long-standing tradition of de
feating the Golden Bears.
Even then, Cal fans found ways to justify their
losses. Following a controversial Stanford touch
down in 1894, a Cal student newspaper reporter
commented, "[Stanford] won by a fluke and a ref
eree ... that is the only just verdict that can be
passed. I do not mean to insinuate that the referee
was in any way influenced to take a Stanford view
of the game; but I do mean he does not know a
touchdown when he sees it."
Perhaps tired of losing to Stanford at football,

Cal proposed to change the sport of the Big Game
from football to rugby in 1904. Fearing that foot
ball was too violent, Cal President Benjamin
Wheeler validated Cal's nickname "The Wee
nies" when he said, "The game of football must
be entirely made over or go."
Therefore, from 1906 to 1914, rugby, an appar
ently less aggressive sport back then, became the
official sport of Big Game. Stanford also dominat
ed Cal at rugby, posting a 5-3-1 record.
During the 1920's and 1930'5, the popularity of
Big Game grew tremendously throughout the
West Coast, forcing the Cardinal to build Stanford

The game was about to begin when the referee
discovered that neither club brought a football to
the field (some sources say that it was Hoover who
forgot to bring the ball). Luckily, the owner of a
local sporting goods store was in the crowd and
while he rode off on horseback to get a ball, the
crowd waited anxiously for more than an hour.
Once the game started, Stanford leaped out to a
14-0 lead and held on for a 14-10 upset of the heav
ily favored and much more experienced Cal squad,
beginning Stanford's long-standing tradition of de
feating the Golden Bears.
Even then, Cal fans found ways to justify their
losses. Following a controversial Stanford touch
down in 1894, a Cal student newspaper reporter
commented, "[Stanford] won by a fluke and a ref
eree ... that is the only just verdict that can be
passed. I do not mean to insinuate that the referee
was in any way influenced to take a Stanford view
of the game; but I do mean he does not know a
touchdown when he sees it."
Perhaps tired of losing to Stanford at football,

Cal proposed to change the sport of the Big Game
from football to rugby in 1904. Fearing that foot
ball was too violent, Cal President Benjamin
Wheeler validated Cal's nickname "The Wee
nies" when he said, "The game of football must
be entirely made over or go."
Therefore, from 1906 to 1914, rugby, an appar
ently less aggressive sport back then, became the
official sport of Big Game. Stanford also dominat
ed Cal at rugby, posting a 5-3-1 record.
During the 1920's and 1930'5, the popularity of
Big Game grew tremendously throughout the
West Coast, forcing the Cardinal to build Stanford

Marking the debut of Stanford
coaching legend Pop Warner, Stan
ford and Cal played to a 20-20 tie in
1924 in front of 77,000 fans at Cal's
new Memorial Stadium in what some
considered the greatest of all
Games. The Oakland Tribune even
reported that in the parking lot,
scalpers were getting $lOO for a pair

of tickets, during ap era when a hot
dog cost 15 cents.
On the field, Stanford, playing
without injured All-American Ernie
Nevers, trailed 20-6 with less than six
minutes remaining in the game.
Quarterback Ed Walker threw two
touchdown passes, one to Murray
Cuddeback, who had been knocked

unconscious earlier in the game after
colliding with a camera tripod, and
Stanford escaped with a tie.
Two years later, Stanford and Cal
competed in what was arguably the
most important Big Game ever. Both
teams entered the game tied for the
lead in the conference with perfect
10-0 records. The winner would go to

the Rose Bowl and contend for a na
tional championship. As 90,000 peo
ple watched the game at Memorial
Stadium, Stanford defeated Cal 13-6.
The 90,000 attendance set a Big
Game record which is still intact
today. Stanford went on to tie Alaba
ma 7-7 in the Rose Bowl. Both teams
also finished the season tied for the

national championship.
While Stanford will not contend
for a national championship this year,
the 102 nd Big Game will once again
have the importance it did during
1926. The whole country will be
watching, as Stanford will attempt to
go to the Rose Bowl for the first time
since the 1971-72 season.
During the Stanford football season, it is com
monly heard around campus that the football team
plays two seasons each year the first 10 games
and Big Game.

Big Game is a storied rivalry between Stanford
and California that defies all odds and ignores all
logic. Nobody on earth ever knows who will win
the game. For Stanford and Cal fans, Big Game
transcends the sport of football.
Perhaps the year that best exemplifies the pro
found meaning of Big Game is 1982. That year,
John Elway, playing in what turned out to be his
last Stanford game, led the Cardinal offense down
the field late in the fourth quarter. With only four
seconds left in the game, Mark Harmon kicked a
35-yard field goal to put Stanford up 20-19.
While the game was already being heralded as
one of the best ever, the final four seconds have be
come arguably the most memorable in college
football history, forever to be known as simply
"The Play."

Cal's Kevin Moen received the Stanford kickoff
at the Bears' 43-yard line. Immediately, the Cal re
turn team formed up like a rugby squad. Every Cal
player who touched the ball quickly lateraled it to
a teammate as soon as he was about to be tackled
(or, in at least one case, as replays clearly showed,
after the ball carrier had been tackled).
After five laterals, Moen ended up with the ball
again and sprinted into the end zone, running
through the premature celebration of the Stanford
Band. Chaos reigned in Berkeley as Cal claimed a
touchdown on the return, while Stanford insisted
that one of the ball carriers had been downed.
After several minutes of discussion, the officials
awarded the touchdown and the game to Cal by the
score of 25-20, though Stanford fans still remember
the score as Stanford 20, Cal 19.
Throughout the past two decades. Big Game
has become away for Stanford fans to forget about

the first 10 games of the season and to demonstrate
Stanford's superiority over its long-time rival, rep
resenting the salvation of Stanford's football sea
son. However, outside the campuses of Stanford
and Cal, Big Game has become overshadowed by
nationally televised football games and profession
al sports.

Yet, Big Game used to have a tremendous im
pact not only for the two Bay-Area rivals but also
for the entire West Coast. Because the Bay area
did not have any professional sports at the turn of
the century, Big Game became the biggest sporting
event on the West Coast for many years, drawing
thousands of fans from all over California.
The 101-game-old series began during the 1891-
1892 school year after a veteran California football
team challenged newborn Stanford University to a
football game in the fall of 1891. John Whittemore,
a transfer student who began to organize a football
team at Stanford, declined the challenge at first but
later accepted it during the spring.
The two schools met at a sandlot near Haight
and Stanyan Streets in San Francisco on March 19,
1892. About 20,000 spectators crowded the field
that day as Stanford student manager Herbert
Hoover collected more than $30,000 in tickets at
the gate.
The game was about to begin when the referee
discovered that neither club brought a football to
the field (some sources say that it was Hoover who
forgot to bring the ball). Luckily, the owner of a
local sporting goods store was in the crowd and
while he rode off on horseback to get a ball, the
