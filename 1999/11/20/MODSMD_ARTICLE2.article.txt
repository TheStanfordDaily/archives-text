# Big Game charged with emotion on field and off

"... and as the crowd/goes
crazy, the drum major climbs to the
top of the fountain and impales the
hapless stuffed bear on top, where
it remains for the rest of Big Game
week," I said splashing through the
Claw, soaking myself and wildly
gesturing to increase the suspense.
The tourists, a mix of high
school students worried that dad
would embarrass them with his
white tennis shoes and knee-high
argyle socks and tourists from
Eastern Europe, about half of
whom spoke English, were not im
pressed.
They stared at me, drenched to
my waist in chilly water, with an ex
pression that said, "Oh, yeah,
every tour is supposed to end like
this. That was great son, now
where can I buy the T came all the
way to Stanford, and all I got was
this T-shirt' T-shirt?"
That was July, four months
from Big Game, and I was already
fired up about the Bearial and the
frenzy that accompanies the annu
al showdown with Berkeley.
Now, here we are on the eve of
perhaps the most important foot
ball game in recent memory for the
Stanford Cardinal. Think I'm
ready now?
Saturday, Stanford takes the
field for the 102 nd Big Game. The
Cardinal puts the Pacific 10 Con
ference title and its hopes of going
to the Rose Bowl, the granddaddy
of 'em all, for the first time since
the 1971-72 season on the line
against a California squad hungry
to avenge four straight Big Game
losses.
For Stanford, a win -Saturday
would mean not only a fifth
straight Big Game victory, but
much more.
It would again boost the Stan
ford football program, often over
shadowed by other West Coast
teams and the multitude of suc
cessful sports programs here at
Stanford, back into .the national
spotlight. Win or lose against Wis
consin, Stanford's Rose Bowl op
ponent should the Cardinal (knock
on* wood) make it to Pasadena on
Jan. 1, Stanford would, at least for
a moment, be mentioned in the
same breath as traditional football
powerhouses such as Nebraska,
Florida State and Tennessee.

It would be a perfect sendoff for
the graduating class of 1999, a
corps of players including wideout
Troy Walters and safety Tim Smith
who have played f heir hearts out
for a Stanford squad that has not
always measured up in the win col
umn the last two years. Walters al
ready owns most of the Stanford
and Pac-10 individual receiving
records. Playing in front of 100,000
fans in one of sport's most storied
venues would be the perfect end
ing to his career.
It would be a repudiation of the
69-17 shellacking Stanford en
dured at the hands of Texas to
open the '99 campaign a loss
that had people already talking
about "next year" with only one
game in the books.
It would mean the return of the
Coffee House, Starbucks-free, and
free books next quarter and no
more I-HUM ... OK, it would be a
big win.
Regardless of the implications,
feig Game promises to be as in
