# Cardinal battles Bears in 102nd Big Game
## Stanford seeks final Pacific 10 Conference victory to clinch Rose Bowl berth. 
### TIM KANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the second-to-last defense
in the country, a 69-17 drubbing at
the hands of Texas, and a home loss

to lowly San Jose State, any sane
person would think the Stanford
football team wouldn't be any
where near a bowl game, right?
Think again.
In a wacky year in the Pacific 10
Conference, the Cardinal (6-3, 6-1
Pac-10) has not only assured itself
of playing in a bowl game, but en
ters Big Game against California
(4-6, 3-4) with a chance to play in
the granddaddy of them all, the
Rose Bowl. Yes, the Rose Bowl
a game Stanford hasn't played in

since the 1971 season, back when
Nixon was president and Stanford
head coach Tyrone Willingham
was a skinny 17-year old in North
Carolina.
The Cardinal has UCLA to
thank for creating the situation, as
the Bruins dispatched Washington
in overtime 23-20 last Saturday,
leaving Stanford in control of its
own destiny. Stanford took advan
tage of Washington's stumble and
outgunned Arizona State 50-30 in
Tempe, Ariz., Saturday night to re

gain sole possession of first place in
the conference, a full game ahead
of Washington and Oregon.
Stanford is assured of finishing
no worse than third in the confer
ence, and the Pac-10's top five
teams have guaranteed bowl
berths. If you were to ask any play
er on the football team, however,
they probably wouldn't profess a
childhood dream of going to the
Culligan Holiday Bowl or the
Wells Fargo Sun Bowl, the destina
tions for the second- and third

place teams, respectively.
Cal. meanwhile, will come into
Stanford Stadium playing purely to
spoil Stanford's Rose Bowl hopes,
as the Golden Bears were eliminat
ed from bowl contention following
their 24-19 loss to Oregon last
week. Cal will be without the ser
vices of freshman quarterback
JCyle Boiler, who separated his
shoulder against Oregon and will
miss Big Game. Senior Wes Dal
