Big Game is always a big game.
But this year, it's momentous.
Plain and simple: if the Cardinal wins to
morrow, it will assure itself its first Rose Bowl
appearance in 28 years. Stanford loses, and,
chances are, it will be the Sun Bowl in El Paso,
Texas, or the Holiday Bowl in San Diego.
Both are respectable bowl games. But the
Rose Bowl is... well, the Rose Bowl.
But to hear the Cardinal tell it, you might
think Big Game is just another game.
"All these games have been big," said se
nior wideout Troy Walters at the pre-Big
Game press conference Monday. "We don't
get caught up in the hype."

Walters has a point. Getting "caught up in
the hype" might be a dangerous proposition,
because logically the hype is huge.

Consider. The last time Stanford was in the
Rose Bowl was Jan. 1, 1972, when the team
was still called the Indians. The Indians had
also gone to Pasadena a year earlier, after the
1970 season.
But in both seasons, Stanford's Rose Bowl
appearances had been guaranteed before the
season-ending Big Game had taken place.
Those Big Games were only about Bay-Area
bragging rights.
Consider again. The last time the winner of
the Big Game had even a chance of going to
the Rose Bowl was in 1975. Gerald Ford was
president.
And the last time the winner of the Big

Game was absolutely assured of going to the
Rose Bowl was in 1953. Dwight Eisenhower.
This season, Stanford (6-3, 6-1 Pacific 10
Conference) sits alone at the top of the Pac-10
standings by virtue of a win last week at Ari
zona State and a surprising Washington loss at
UCLA in a game that the Huskies were sup
posed to skirt through with no problem. But
because of gutsy overtime play by a surpris
ingly stalwart Bruin defense, Washington fell
23-20, slipping out of a first-place tie with the
Cardinal.
Washington still has a shot at the Rose
Bowl, however, depending on what happens
this week. If the Cardinal falls to the Bears and
Washington can beat Washington State in that
