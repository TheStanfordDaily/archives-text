Big Game is always a big game.
But this year, it's momentous.
Plain and simple: if the Cardinal wins to
morrow, it will assure itself its first Rose Bowl
appearance in 28 years. Stanford loses, and,
chances are, it will be the Sun Bowl in El Paso,
Texas, or the Holiday Bowl in San Diego.
Both are respectable bowl games. But the
Rose Bowl is... well, the Rose Bowl.
But to hear the Cardinal tell it, you might
think Big Game is just another game.
"All these games have been big," said se
nior wideout Troy Walters at the pre-Big
Game press conference Monday. "We don't
get caught up in the hype."

Walters has a point. Getting "caught up in
the hype" might be a dangerous proposition,
because logically the hype is huge.

Consider. The last time Stanford was in the
Rose Bowl was Jan. 1, 1972, when the team
was still called the Indians. The Indians had
also gone to Pasadena a year earlier, after the
1970 season.
But in both seasons, Stanford's Rose Bowl
appearances had been guaranteed before the
season-ending Big Game had taken place.
Those Big Games were only about Bay-Area
bragging rights.
Consider again. The last time the winner of
the Big Game had even a chance of going to
the Rose Bowl was in 1975. Gerald Ford was
president.
And the last time the winner of the Big

Game was absolutely assured of going to the
Rose Bowl was in 1953. Dwight Eisenhower.
This season, Stanford (6-3, 6-1 Pacific 10
Conference) sits alone at the top of the Pac-10
standings by virtue of a win last week at Ari
zona State and a surprising Washington loss at
UCLA in a game that the Huskies were sup
posed to skirt through with no problem. But
because of gutsy overtime play by a surpris
ingly stalwart Bruin defense, Washington fell
23-20, slipping out of a first-place tie with the
Cardinal.
Washington still has a shot at the Rose
Bowl, however, depending on what happens
this week. If the Cardinal falls to the Bears and
Washington can beat Washington State in that

Senior Troy Walters, the all-time Pac-10 leader in receptions and receiving yards, anchors a Cardinal offense that has propelled the team
within one game of its first Rose Bowl berth in 28 years.
state's version of Big Game, then the
Huskies will again be tied with the
Cardinal for the Pac-10 lead. And
since the Cardinal lost to Washing
ton 35-30 in Seattle earlier this sea
son, it will be the Huskies who go to
the Rose Bowl.
"That [a Rose Bowl appearance]
is something that hasn't happened in
28 years," said head coach Tyrone
Willingham, about as animated as
Willingham has ever been. "That
means a great deal to the program, to
the University and most importantly
to the individuals involved in playing
the game."
Willingham, notoriously under
stated, is insulating himself from the
hype as well. But there have been a
few telltale cracks in his usually-con
crete exterior.
"He was smiling [on Saturday],"
said senior quarterback Todd
Husak. "You don't see that much."
And when a reporter asked at
Monday's press conference if he was
excited about his team, he paused,
took a breath, and answered: "I am."
But Willingham sees two prob
lems with letting the excitement that

surrounds the event take over. First,
a "Big Game for the Rose Bowl" sce
nario might not just be a motivation
but also a distraction to players trying
to get the job done on the field.
"It just depends on what person
you're talking to, and what their
frame of mind is and how they view
that particular focus," Willingham
said. "If we have guys that think ...
that we're already there at the Rose
Bowl, then it's a distraction. If we
have guys that believe this will be
something significant in their life and
use it as motivation, then it will be a
tremendous motivator."
Willingham is also concerned that
focusing on the hype of the game
might cloud the fact that Calâ€”while
in the midst of a disappointing season
and out of the bowl chase due to a
loss at Oregon last week will be a
strong opponent. It would be a seri
ous mistake to discount the Bears.
"We understand the magnitude
of the Big Game," Willingham said.
"To look ahead would be a mistake."
Willingham will leave that up to
everyone in the stands tomorrow,
who will all have one eye on the clock
tomorrow, knowing that if time ex
pires with the Cardinal out in front,
Stanford is headed for its first Rose
Bowl appearance in 28 years.
