# Stanford-Cal rivalry burns fiercely on both campuses
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
All Stanford students, from the
moment they arrive on campus, are
bred to absolutely despise the Gold
en Bears of Berkeley with a passion
matched by few collegiate rivalries.
Big Game is the most visible byprod
uct of an enormous rift between two
schools separated by only 44 miles.
The Stanford-California rivalry,
arguably the most storied matchup in
college athletics, extends far beyond
a single football game. However, lit
tle means more to the students at
tending each school than the one
year right to insult that comes with

possession of The Axe, the trophy
given to the winner of Big Game
since 1933.

"The attitude here is that if we win
Big Game, we can say that not only
are we better than them academical
ly, but we're better than them at
everything," said junior Kate
Watkinson.
"Big Game is one of the best tra
ditions we have here," said senior
Amy Sheng. "It's great when you see
the whole school out there for the
game."
The competitive friction that ex
ists between the two universities is

evident in almost all facets of student
life and beyond. No matter how ob
scure, anything is fair game to use as
a pronouncement of one school's
mastery over the other.
The Stanford Axe Committee,
which organizes many of the Big
Game week activities, uses its Web
site to boast about the Cardinal's su
periority by comparing the two uni
versities in random categories rang
ing from "type of Internet network"
to "number of alumni currently on
the Supreme Court."
For the past four years, as well as
seven of the last eight in which the
game was played at Stanford Stadi
um, Stanford students were able to
use Big Game victories to claim su
periority over their counterparts
from Berkeley. Stanford leads the
overall series, which stands as the
lOth-longest running rivalry in col
lege football, with a record of 51-39-
11.
Students on campus for their first
Big Game cannot help but be affect
ed by the aura created by the events
leading up to Saturday's contest.
Monday's Bearial, the impaling of
Oski the Bear, Cal's mascot, fol
lowed by three performances of Gai
eties Wednesday through Friday and
the Big Game Rally on Thursday
night give Stanford freshmen a true
taste of what the animosity is all
about.
"I came here not knowing any
thing about the rivalry," said fresh
man Robyn Beavers. "But now I'm
starting to understand why everyone
hates them so much."
Other Stanford students share
these sentiments, especially those
who, like Beavers, heard members of
the Cal marching band parade
around campus playing their instru
ments late Sunday night.
"You can't help but start to hate
Cal beiflg on this campus during Big
Game week," said freshman Chad
Goldberg.
Some freshmen haven't devel
oped the intense hatred that is evi
dent on much of the campus, but
most cannot escape the feelings" of
bitterness toward their Bay-Area ri
vals.
"I don't hate Cal, I just think
we're better than them," said fresh
man Nikki Probst.
The importance of the Stanford-
Cal rivalry is not limited to its rele
vance to football players and to stu
dents. Members of other athletic
teams at Stanford know that the en
mity between the two schools is im
portant in every facet of competition.
"There's so much pent-up emo
tion involved every time you play
Cal," said senior Mark Madsen, a
starter for the men's basketball team.
"It's always one of the toughest, most
competitive games on the schedule."
While many Stanford students
seem to hate anyone from Berkeley,
some of their own classmates and
friends hail from their enemy's cam
pus. These Berkeley natives have
varied outlooks on the meaning of
the rivalry.
Sabrina Bornstein, a freshman,
has lived in Berkeley her entire life.
She attended many football games
for her hometown university while
growing up.
"Basically, going to all those
games just made me realize that I
wanted to come to Stanford that
much more."
"My mom is a Cal grad, so I grew
up a Cal fan knowing all about the ri
valry," said junior Lindsay Kagawa,
the starting setter for the women's
volleyball team. "I've definitely
crossed over now, but I can't help but
get a little nostalgic hearing the Cal
fight song."
This year's Big Game has taken
on added significance to Cardinal
faithful, with a win over the hated
rival also meaning a trip to Pasadena
for the Rose Bowl. The Rose Bowl
berth would be the Cardinal's first in
28 years.
"This year it's even more impor
tant because it actually means some
thing," said junior Jason Wardwell.
"Having a chance to go to the Rose
Bowl makes this year's game so
much more exciting."
As game time approaches, the
feelings associated with Big Game
and the Stanford-Cal rivalry are des
tined to reach a boiling point. With a
Rose Bowl berth coming hand-in
hand with beating Stanford's most
despised rival for the fifth-straight
year, the 102 nd Big Game could po
tentially be the biggest of its kind in
the rivalry's rich history.
