There is nothing wrong with
wanting your body to be slim
and in shape, but if your
whole life is focused on losing
weight, you may be suffering
from an eating disorder.
Anorexia nervosa and bulimia
are the two major tvpes of
eating disorders. While they
affect only 1-2% of the popula
tion, the incidence is much
higher among adolescent and
young women.
Anorexia
Sufferers from anorexia are
driven by a compulsive desire
to lose weight. They severely
limit their intake of calories,
and get to a point of dangerous
thinness. They are also prone
to menstruation abnormalities
brought about by an inade
quate intake of calories. An
anorexic person may:
■ Severely limit or refuse
food
■ Have great fear of gaining
weight
■ Be preoccupied with food
■ Deny seriousness of low
weight
■ Exercise excessively
Bulimia
With bulimia, a person engages
in binge eating, or eats an
unusually large amount of food
in one sitting. Some anorexics
also engage in binge eating and
purging. Bulimic people often
experience a lack of control
over what or how much they
eat during these binges, which
may be triggered by emotional
upset or boredom.
To prevent weight gain, some
sufferers of bulimia purge by
making themselves throw up,
using medications such as lax
atives, fasting, or exercise.
Bulimic persons may have
normal, above normal, or under

normal weight. It is estimated
that as many as 18% of female
high school and college
students may suffer from
varying degrees of bulimia.
Other symptoms of these
eating disorders include:
■ Dry skin
■ Brittle hair or hair loss
■ Dental problems such as
loss of teeth enamel
■ Swollen glands on both sides
of the jaw from vomiting
■ Depression and mood swings
■ Self-esteem overly influenced
bv weight, body shape, and
appearance
■ Concealing eating and
purging from others
Physical Ailments
Eating disorders can lead to a
number of serious physical
ailments such as:
■ Weakened bones
■ Low blood pressure
■ I rregu la r hea rtbea t
■ Dehydration
■ Fatigue
Emotional Symptoms
These may include feelings of:
■ Social isolation
■ Shame
■ Depression
■ Despair
■ Loss of control
Consequences
The consequences of either
type of eating disorder can
ultimately be fatal. Some
people starve themselves to
death. Others die of a heart
attack due to damage to heart
muscle or a loss of potassium, a
mineral that is critical to
maintaining the electrical
activity of the heart.
Cause
While the cause of the con
ditions is unclear, eating dis
orders have been predictably
linked to several tilings, including
physiological, emotional, social,
and personality factors. People
who have eating disorders may
be depression-prone, sensitive
to others' opinions of them,
dislike conflicts, and have high
expectations of themselves.
Treatment
In most cases, abnormal eating
habits can be changed, but
eating disorders require pro
fessional treatment. Many
recover successfully through
regular office visits. A hospital
stay is sometimes required in
an extreme case. Treatment usu
ally involves medical monitor
ing, nutritional counseling and
supplements, individual and
family psychotherapy, and some
times drug therapy. Family
support plays an important role
in any successful treatment
program. If you or someone
you know is struggling with an
eating disorder, get help. Q
