# ED applications up
## Stanford's yield continues to rise; admissions rate may drop again 
### Jed Rose Contributing writer 
Early Decision applications have
increased about 5 percent from the
2.608 applicant figure last year, ac
cording to Robert Kinnally. Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions.
While ED application totals are
still being tabulated. Kinnally ex
pects them to end up at about 2.S(H)
hopefuls.
"The reason we have Early Deci
sion for Stanford is we believe there
are many students who absolutely
feel Stanford is the best place for
them, and it's a good match." said
Kinnally.
Kinnally added that Stanford's
record yield of 70 percent for the
Class of 2003 would probably result
in a dramatic drop in the acceptance
rate for the Class of 2004.
"Regular applications are on tar
get for the same pace as last year. We
are probably going to admit fewer
students this year — probably
around a 12-percent admit rate."
The Early Decision program has
gone through a makeover in the past
couple of years. Just last year, the for
mer two-round Early Decision
process was consolidated into one
round for early applicants.
Many cite the change in the Early
Decision program as a reason lor the
recent surge in Stanford's yield. This
change in Early Decision resulted in
a migration of people who would
have applied in the second round of
Early Decision to apply with the reg
ular application pool.
Peer institutions ran the gamut for
their respective early decision appli
cant totals. Yale University reported
only a 2.4-percent increase from
1.445 to 1.480 applicants for early de
cision.

I'wo universities also under a sim
ilar ED program, the University of
Pennsylvania and Cornell Universi
ty. are reporting 17.Sand 6.1- per
cent increases, respectively.
I Dartmouth ( ollege showed a 6.7-
percent decrease in applications this
year, shifting from 1.163 to I.IWI ED
applicants.
The largest increases in the early
applications, however, came from
universities involved with Early Ac
tion. a non-binding early application
round. A new revision instituted al
lows applicants to apply to more than
one school, as long as it's also an
I :arly Action school.
Kinnally commented 011 the
change in the EA policy. "We try to
downplay ED. We are afraid so
many students use it as a way to get
in. These [Early Action] schools
seem to have taken the opposite di
rection."
Brown reported a huge (>4.7 per
cent jump in Early Action applica
tions, rising from 2, 1 >75 to 4. 1 )00 appli
cants.
I larvard also showed a strong in
crease in EA applications, rising 31 .S
percent from 4.5<X4 to 6,042 for the
Class of 2004.

Kinnally responded to the num
bers. "I think that there is already
over-strategi/ing by [prospective]
students and a lot of them use early
aetion as a way to get in. So when an
institution offers multiple ways — it
exacerbates the problem."
William R. Fitzsimmons, dean of
Harvard Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aid. confirmed
that high school students may possi
bly be using the new Early Action
procedure for strategic reasons when
applying to Early Action schools.
"You could speculate that the
overall application numbers might
be up, but the truth of the matter is
that it might not happen," said
Fitzsimmons in an article in The
Crimson.
Early Action can affect a school's
prediction of yield because it includes
EA acccptees. Schools with large
Early Action pools will have quite a
task in trying to figure out which of
the accepted will actually enroll.
The largest worry amongst ED

universities revolves around students
choosing a school because EA ac
ccptees become inundated with per
sonalized letters from the schools
they were accepted to.
"If it's about who loves you first —
and if it's all about that — then it's all
wrong," said Kinnally. "What I al
ways say is. frankly your mother
probably loved you first. But if you
are going to a college because it loved
you first, you are probably going for
the wrong reasons."
Institutions such as Stanford will
find that there are students in its reg
ular round of admissions that have
been wooed by their acceptance
from another school for several
months before getting Stanford's de
cision April 1.
Kinnally remains optimistic that
the EA policy will minimally affect
Stanford's recent record yield and
application numbers.
"This is my life until April Isaid
Kinnally with a smile. "But 1 have a
lot of fun doing it."
