# ED applications up
## Stanford's yield continues to rise; admissions rate may drop again 
### Jed Rose Contributing writer 
Early Decision applications have
increased about 5 percent from the
2.608 applicant figure last year, ac
cording to Robert Kinnally. Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions.
While ED application totals are
still being tabulated. Kinnally ex
pects them to end up at about 2.S(H)
hopefuls.
"The reason we have Early Deci
sion for Stanford is we believe there
are many students who absolutely
feel Stanford is the best place for
them, and it's a good match." said
Kinnally.
Kinnally added that Stanford's
record yield of 70 percent for the
Class of 2003 would probably result
in a dramatic drop in the acceptance
rate for the Class of 2004.
"Regular applications are on tar
get for the same pace as last year. We
are probably going to admit fewer
students this year â€” probably
around a 12-percent admit rate."
The Early Decision program has
gone through a makeover in the past
couple of years. Just last year, the for
mer two-round Early Decision
process was consolidated into one
round for early applicants.
Many cite the change in the Early
Decision program as a reason lor the
recent surge in Stanford's yield. This
change in Early Decision resulted in
a migration of people who would
have applied in the second round of
Early Decision to apply with the reg
ular application pool.
Peer institutions ran the gamut for
their respective early decision appli
cant totals. Yale University reported
only a 2.4-percent increase from
1.445 to 1.480 applicants for early de
cision.

I'wo universities also under a sim
ilar ED program, the University of
Pennsylvania and Cornell Universi
ty. are reporting 17.Sand 6.1- per
cent increases, respectively.
I Dartmouth ( ollege showed a 6.7-
percent decrease in applications this
year, shifting from 1.163 to I.IWI ED
applicants.
