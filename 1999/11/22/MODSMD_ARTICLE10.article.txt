# Stressed students overwhelm CAPS
## 
### Kara Bradford 
As the quarter draws to a close
and colds proliferate and stress levels
intensity, students often turn to Stan
ford's Counseling And Psychological
Services to help cope with these
added factors.
I lowever, due to high demand,
students seeking counseling for this
week were placed on a waiting list lie
cause the professional counselors at
CA PS were booked.
In response to the heavy demand,
CAPS has created additional clinical
hours open to students on the waiting
list so that they will be able see one of
the service's counselors as soon as
possible. These extra hours will go
into effect this week.
"We're trying to meet the needs of
the students," said Alejandro Mar
tine/, director ol CAPS.
Martinez stressed that those who
need guidance immediately will not
have to wait.
"If things feel urgent for them,
we're going to see them the same
day."he said. " There will be no wait
ing for urgent problems."
A rise in the number of students
requesting services is not uncommon
for this time of year. Martinez added.
According to Martinez, the
months of November, I ebruary and
May are the busiest times of the year
in his office. I le attributes the in
crease to the academic and social
challenges students face. As
midterms end and finals loom, stu

dents find no time to catch lip on
sleep and thus are more susceptible
to sickness.
"By the end of the quarter, stu
dents are worn out from their daily
and often over-commit ted . lives."
saitl junior Jill I)i (iiovanni. ;i peer
health educator. " The influx of work
iit the end of the quartereomes at the
worst time for students, when their
energy reserves are at the lowest,
which makes handling personal is
sues extremely difficult." she added.
Of course, stress is not unique to
Stanford, hut Di Giovanni noted that
for Stanford students, "there is con
stant pressure to be doing more,
whether academically or sc icially, and
sleeping or relaxing less."
I liis lifestyle explains the popular
ity of oil-campus resources, she said.
"Academics are very demanding
here," Martinez added. "It's very dif
ficult to deal with multiple demands
in your life. When academic perfor
mance begins tosuffer, that should he
a marker for students that they need
to come in."
Martinez said "a similar propor
tion" or a slightly higher number of
Stanford students seek counseling
services compared to those attending
other schools.
"At other universities, probably
about 7 to 12 percent of students turn
to a service like ours every year." he
said. "We see about 10 percent |of
Stanford students each year)."
Hie most important thing when
evaluating a student for the first time.

Marline/ s;iid, is to understand where
they are coming from.
"Our goal initially is to have a
good idea of what the student is wor
rying about," lie said. " Then, we give
them ideas to help out. Usually, they
return to us five to six times and end
up with a very good result.
"Some situations we know are
going to take more time to resolve."
lie added.
For those whose needs go beyond
the free counseling CAPS can offer.
Martinez said that if scheduling per
mits, they may continue to be seen on
a fee basis.
Otherwise. CAPS refers students
to therapists in the area.
When CAPS is booked, Stanford
students nevertheless need advice to
maintain their well-being. Martinez
said allocating time more wisely is
key tluring periods of stress and pres
sure.
I)i (iiovanni says students "can
call or visit The Bridge and talk to a
peer counselor, talk to someone at
campus ministries or talk to someone
011 stall 111 their dorm or house."
bach registered student should be
aware that he or she is "entitled to 10
free sessions with a counselor per
psychological issue." I)i (iiovanni
said.

ments for CAPS are available 011
