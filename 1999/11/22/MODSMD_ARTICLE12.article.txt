## CIA declassifies new details of Kennedy investigation 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Hours
alter President John F. Kennedy was
assassinated. FBI agents reportedly
listened to a tape of a phone call that
a man identifying himself as "Lee
Oswald had placed to the Soviet
Embassy in Mexico City.
They made a startling discovery:
I he voice on the tape was not
Oswald's, government records say.
This tape has been a question
mark in the assassination investiga
tion since Kennedy was killed. The
assassination occurred 36 years ago
today, and only now have new
details about the tape come to light.
The CIA said years ago that the
tapes on which it recorded the call

were erased. Documents released in
recent years said otherwise. The lat
est and newest of declassified docu
ments offer more evidence that the
tapes survived.
The discovery that the voice on
the tape was someone other than
Oswald was a "disquieting discovery
because the man who impersonated
Oswald was still at large." said John
Newman, an ex-military intelligence
analyst, author and professor at the
University of Maryland.
Oswald was in Mexico in Septem
ber and October 1%3. During his
one-week stay, he contacted the
Soviet Embassy and the Cuban con
sulate. inquiring about visas needed

to go to the Soviet Union via Cuba.
It is widely known that the CIA
bugged telephones and took surveil
lance photos at both the embassy
and consulate. But the agency main
tained that it had routinely erased
and reused tapes of the phone inter
cepts. A message from the ClA's
Mexico City station to headquarters
on Nov. 24. 1%3, said: "110 has full
transcripts all pertinent calls. Regret
complete recheck shows tapes for
this period already erased."
Newly declassified documents
some released in the past six months
- say that after the president was
shot, a Navy plane carried a top
secret package from Mexico City to

Dallas and landed there about 4 a.m.
EST the day after the murder.
A newly released memo dated
Nov. 27, 1%3, from FBI headquar
ters to its office in Mexico City, said:
"II tapes covering any contacts
subject (Oswald) with Soviet or
Cuban embassies available, forward
to bureau for laboratory examina
tion and analysis together with tran
script. Include tapes previously
reviewed in Dallas if they were
returned to you."
And a transcript of a telephone
call FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover
made to President Johnson just six
hours after the plane arrived in Dal
las supports the belief that FBI

agents listened to a tape that suggest
ed an impersonation.
"We have up here the tape and
the photograph of the man who was
at the Soviet embassy using Oswald's
name," Hoover told Johnson,
according to a transcript of that call
released in 1993.
While they wouldn't guess at the
identity of the caller, some assassina
tion researchers privately offered
explanations: Oswald could have
been impersonated by a CIA officer
who called simply to fish for details
about what Oswald was doing in
Mexico. Or. maybe someone was
trying to link Oswald to the KGB's
assassination unit before the murder.

Whatever the answer, there was
plenty of reason for worry in Wash
ington about any evidence pointing
to Soviets or Cubans as somehow
involved in the assassination.
"The public must be satisfied that
Oswald was the assassin; that he did
not have confederates who are still at
large," Nicholas Katzenbach, then
deputy attorney general, wrote in a
memo on Nov. 25, 1963.
"Speculation about Oswald's
motivation ought to be cut off, and
we should have some basis for rebut
ting (the) thought that this was a
communist conspiracy 0r... a right
wing conspiracy to blame the com
munists."
