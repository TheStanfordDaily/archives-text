Security at Big Game was insulting
to fans and destroyed the
experiece

Saturday's Big Game between
Stanford and UC-Berkeley,
which saw Stanford's football
team secure a Rose Bowl berth,
was distinguished from others in
recent years by the relative
absence of postgame violence
between fans of the two schools.
While the lack of any serious inci
dents is a cause for comfort, the
draconian security measures
employed by the University were
simply inexcusable and utterly
insulting to Stanford fans.
In addition to a larger than nor
mal contingent of stadium security,
10 rows in the student section were
sealed off. Then in the third quar
ter two rows of Santa Clara Coun
ty sheriffs deputies in riot gear
took their place inside the fence
and on the field to deter any
potential field rushers.
Such blatantly hostile measures
only served to poison the pleasant
and exciting atmosphere surround
ing Big (lame and perhaps further
heightened any tension present.
Furthermore, the excessive display
of force betrayed a callous disre
spect for the intelligence of Stan
ford students. The University
made an unjustified assumption
that the students could and would
resort to violence.
Not only did the University's
actions make a mockery of the stu
dent body, but their actions were
also a source of embarrassment for
alumni and guests who attended
this historic event. The clumsy
nature of the heavy security

severely detracted from the game
itself and ruined the atmosphere
for all present.
The win on Saturday means that
Stanford will he attending the
Rose Bowl for the first time in 28
years; thus it makes sense that
Stanford fans should have been
allowed to rush the field to cele
brate with the team — a common
practice after football games.
However, the University's
actions destroyed any postgame
celebrations for Stanford fans. Cel
ebrating in the stands behind rows
of heavy security following a big
victory is not quite the same as cel
ebrating on the field with the team.
As evidenced by the arrests of
20 Cal students after the game, the
problem lies not with the Stanford
fans but with Berkeley's. Stan
ford's students should not have
been punished for the bad behav
ior of students from the other
school.
Certainly the recent increase in
violence over the past five years
between students from the two
schools should be a concern for all
those involved. And without a
doubt the safety of the fans should
be utmost in everyone's minds.
Both universities should be taking
strong measures to curb incidents
of violence. Students in particular
should work to rebuild the spirit of
friendly competition that once
existed.
The University administration
should have taken more creative
measures to ensure safety at the
game without destroying the expe
rience. Whatever was gained in
terms of increased safety was lost
by the negative experience of the
fans.
