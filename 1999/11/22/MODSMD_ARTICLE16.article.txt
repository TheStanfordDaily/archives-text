# The
						Upward Spiral
## Where the hell have you been?

I spent my junior year
as a resident assistant
in Junipero, an all
frosh dorm. I was often
engaged with dorm activ
ities. and I really didn't
see as much of my class
mates as in previous

years. Because I rarely saw them, I logi
cally assumed that many of my classmates
had done one of two things. They had
either dropped out of Stanford or they had
been eaten by a carnivorous horde of
transvestite, cyborg gazebos.
It has recently come to my attention
that Stanford has a very large overseas
study program. And evidently, many
members of my class spent significant
parts of last year studying abroad. Now I
admit that I have never had the wacky,
crazy experience of spending a whopping
10 weeks in one of Stanford's overseas
centers. I lowever, I have, noticed many
general behavior trends among students
that have been overseas.
Because the former overseas student
(FOS) has lived abroad, he or she is sud
denly smarter, funnier and better looking
than the rest of the general student popu
lation.
This fact has become increasingly evi
dent at Senior Pub Night, where these
bourgeois FOSs will purposefully isolate
themselves from the rest of the senior
class. They will then regale each other
with cunning witticisms and admire each
other's striking beauty while quietly snick
ering at the rest of the proletariat student
population.
The fundamental tastes of the FOS
have noticeably changed. Your friends
who have spent time in Berlin will no
longer drink beer unless it has the color of

battery acid and the consistency of mucus.
Ask a friend who lias spent time in Flo
rence il he would like to eat at the Olive
Garden. I le will respond by saying, "Oh. I
used to love eating at the Olive Garden
until I ate real Italian food in Florence."
And then he will spend the next four days
talking about pesto.
What your friend fails to realize is that
any one who has ever enjoyed eating at
the Olive Garden has already demonstrat
ed a glaring and unforgivable lack of good
taste. Because of this, you should ostracize
him from your circle of friends.
No matter how much fun we had on
campus last year, we didn't have nearly as
much fun as the overseas students. For
some inexplicable reason, being drunk in
Europe is much more fun that being drunk
in America, and FOSs feel compelled to
constantly remind us of this fact.
They will tell you the same formulaic
story about a crazy night in Frankfurt
when (fill in I In* name of some FOS
friend) got so drunk o'f 15 shots of (fill in
the name of some expensive foreign
liquor) that he or she puked all over (fill in
the name of a foreign head of state).
For example: "Dude, when we were in
Frankfurt. Pablo got so drunk off 15 Dura
cell Mucus√üeers that he puked all over
Tunisian President Zinc el-Abidine Ben
Ali."
But overseas study isn't just a 10-week
drinking extravaganza. It is a profound
religious experience. At some point in
their travel, all students are required to
stand on the bank of the (fill in the name
of some European river) while smoking
(fill in the name of some narcotic) and
come to the profound and earth-shattering
realization that American culture sucks.
There are plenty of rivers and narcotics

in the United States, so 1 don't see why
you have to travel all the way to Europe to
decide that American society sucks.
This is why I propose that Stanford
cancel all overseas programs. We can save
a considerable amount of resources by
opening one overseas study branch in
Davenport, lowa. Here we can simply
issue all aspiring overseas students a car
ton of Camel Lights and then throw them
in the Mississippi River for 10 weeks.
The FOSs will never stop talking about
how different the culture of whichever
country they stayed in was. At times, these
students seem surprised and even
astounded that foreign people have "sub
tle" differences in the way they live.
Let me point out that when you gel in
an airplane, fly 5.000 miles, cross an ocean
and land in a foreign country, the first
things you see are probably not going to
be a Jack In The Box and a Wal-Mart.
Frankly, you really shouldn't be surprised
by anything short of a carnivorous horde
of transvestite, cyborg gazebos.
The point of this column is not that
overseas study is a bad idea. I have spent a
few years living in foreign countries, and I
know many students have had worthwhile
educational and social experiences over
seas. I also think it's great that most Stan
ford students are very open-minded and
observant when they are abroad.
But here's the thing: just because you
weren't a condescending "Ugly" Ameri
can when you were away doesn't mean
that you're allowed to be one now that
you're home.
