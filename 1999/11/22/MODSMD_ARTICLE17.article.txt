Students treated like inmates
at fiig Game
While I applaud the University's efforts
to reduce the postgame violence and chaos
that has come to be associated with Big
(iame. I think the presence of riot police
intensified rather than alleviated the specter
of violence.
I lie parade of armed men and women
during the third quarter signaled an about
face in the University's policy toward Big
(iame violence. Yes, of course it's danger
ous for students of both teams to rush the
field. Yes, we all know mass psychology
mandates each team must match the other.
Yes, it's extremely important to declare that
the field is "off-limits" and arrest flagrant
violators of the new policy.
But is it necessary to present the students
with such an aggressive show of force? To
have do/ens of officers stand club-length
apart, face shields down, to build a wall
between the fans and the game? By hiring
riot police to "protect" students, the admin
istration sent a new message.
Their appeal to responsibility and intelli
gence. reiterated through e-mail, house
meetings and The Daily, was replaced by
naked violence.

This show of force ruined the spirit of the
game and replaced it with fear. The line of
"soldiers" in front of us didn't evoke good
natured competition and restraint — they
conjured up nightmares of Kent State in
l l )7().
Not only did the presence of armed
police officers ruin the spirit of the game, it
added to the tension of violence. As students
from both Stanford and Cal — we were
targeted as unruly animals. The presence of
riot police seemed to bait students into
anger. These men and women were not
campus safety officers with little trees sewn
on their jackets; they were a totally foreign
force, one whose symbolic purpose was vio
lence. With side arms and clubs, there wasn't
even
a pretense of "keeping the peace."
Yes, I understand the rationale and the
justifications. Big Game has gotten out of
hand. The students have abused their trust.
Yet there is no justification for the degree of
violence displayed at yesterday's game.
There is no justification for a university hir
ing mercenaries to threaten its own students.
Yes, I understand that the policy
"worked" — there was no trampling of the
field, no destruction of private property, no
personal injury. Hut I contend that what lit

tic postgame violence the armed soldiers
averted could he felt in the air the moment
they arrived. There was no show of violence
at the end of Big Game precisely because it
was present for most of the second half.
What happened at Big Game yesterday
betrayed a total lack of respect for student
rights. It was at best an act of poor faith and
at worst a revelation of how the University
truly sees us — not as students but as
inmates.

It was quite a surprise, seeing Thursday's
letter from a former Weenie Band member
trying to express a serious opinion about our
Band ("Band could better cater to fans").
I would suggest to Mr. Chow that no Uni
versity institution serves all of its constituen
cy. Probably no Stanford institution is more
a subject of recurrent media interest — both
positive and negative — than the Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching Band
(LSJUMB).

It is the unique nature of the Band that
makes it worthy of a NCAA Division I
institution. One might venture that serious
students spending hours practicing Big-10-
style "disappearing diamonds" are not
worthy of the academic standards of
Berkeley.
The time Band members spend creating
funny, relevant, interesting and creative
halftime hijinx balances the pressures of
study. It is bold of Stanford to allow these
students the opportunity to display their cre
ativity as entertainment in front of 30,000 to
NO.(XX) people on alternate fall weekends.
The University deserves more respect for
their support of students and respect for
their willingness to take risks.
The alternative is a sell out — a lost
chance to stand out from our peers. Remak
ing the Band in a more generic form would
be a tragedy to its fans.
Can you embrace humor and irreverence
and still be accepted by an academic com
munity's staff, alumni, students and follow
ers? 1 hope so. Life would be that much
more dull without the LSJUMB.
