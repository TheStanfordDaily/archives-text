Prior to the game, the Cardinal
held an on-court ceremony for se
niors Kerri Walsh. Sarah Clark and
Jami Gregory and their families as a
means of thanking them for their
four years of hard work, dedication
and the level of excellence they con
tributed to the team. Each player's
long list of achievements and statis
tics were announced to the crowd,
and coach Don Shaw gave each
flowers and a hug in an emotional
farewell to three players that left a
lasting impact on the program, help
ing the team to two national champi
onships.
Gregory, playing in her last regu
lar season home match, later de
scribed the experience as, "So neat.
We've really enjoyed playing in
Maples and in front of these fans
over the years." 1 lowever. Gregory
explained that the three seniors do
not expect this to be their last home

game, as the team hopes to host a
Regional match of the NCAA tour
nament in December.
After the ceremony was done, it
was time to get down to business.
With the Pac-10 title on the line,
Stanford was determined not to let
any mental letdowns stand in the
way of its sixth-straight conference
crown. With ample motivation
spurring it on. the Cardinal dominat
ed every facet of the game to send
the Huskies home in three games
and claim a part of the Pac-10 title.
Stanford shares the title with
UCLA, who defeated USC in four
games the same night, after the Car
dinal split its conference matches
with the Bruins. However, the Car
dinal will receive the league's auto
matic bid to the NCAA tournament
after winning the third tiebreaker:
total number of points scored be
tween the two teams.
Against Washington, Stanford
tallied a huge advantage at the net,
outblocking the Huskies 15-1 and si
lencing any offensive threat they
might pose.
Several members of the team had
solid individual outings, foremost
among them sophomore middle
blocker Sara Sandrik, who came off
the bench to notch match-highs of 13
kills and seven blocks to go with a ca
reerhigh .692 attack percentage, the
second highest by a Stanford player
this season.
Walsh chipped in six kills and
zero errors to move up to fifth on
Stanford's all-time kill list with 1471
kills total in her career. Seniors (ire
gory and Clark also contributed,
with Gregory tallying 10 kills and
Clark adding nine, in addition to
seven digs and a .300 attack percent
age. Sophomore outside hitter Lisa
Underhill led Washington with eight
kills.
The Cardinal will face Santa
Clara (20-9) on the road on Tuesday
in its last regular-season match be
fore starting play in the NCAA tour
nament. Stanford appears ready for
the pressures and excitement of the
postseason — as Gregory explains,
"T he playoffs are the best time. This
is what we've been working to
wards."
