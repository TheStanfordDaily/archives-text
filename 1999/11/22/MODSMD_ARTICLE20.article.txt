It was cold and rainy, but fans
weren't going anywhere Friday
night as No. 16 Stanford (12-4-3)
and No. 17 Santa Clara (13-3-3)
played through an extra hour of
overtime and into penalty kicks
until the Broncos finally put the
battle to rest, 6-5.

MEN'S SOCCER
â–  Friday: No. 17 Santa Clara 2, No.
16 Stanford 2. Santa Clara won on
6th penalty kick in 40T.

The defeat knocks the Cardinal
out of the NCAA tournament in
the first round of action, dashing
hopes of a return appearance in the
championship game. And while the
Broncos move on to face Duke,
which defeated Maryland-Balti
more County last night, Santa
Clara had to fight for the honor.
It would be hard to find two
teams better matched than Stan
ford and Santa Clara. Earlier this
season the two teams went into the
second overtime before Stanford
put the game away with a 1 -0 victo
ry. Traditionally, the meeting of the
Bay-Area rivals, whose overall
record now stands at 16-16-5,
promises an exciting game, and Fri
day night was no exception.
"It was what we expected," red
shirt junior defender Chris Gores
said of the closely fought game.
"We knew that it's always going to
be a really intense game. Before
the game, coach said that whoever
could win the 50 / 50 balls would
win the game."
Because of high expectations of
a tight game, Santa Clara's goal in
the first five minutes came as some
what of a surprise. As both teams
were still getting adjusted to the

slippery conditions at New Mal
oney Field, senior defender Kyle
Smith slid a shot from senior de
fender Eric Denton past Stanford
goalkeeper Adam Zapala. The
goal was a wakeup call for the Car
dinal, who answered 15 minutes
later as senior defender Andy
Hemmerich found Gores on a cor
ner kick, who set up junior mid
fielder Ryan Nelsen with the tying
goal.
The half saw more promising at
tempts by the Cardinal that found
the crossbar rather than the back of
the net. Hemmerich and co-captain
midfielder T.K. Inbody each rifled
shots that skimmed over the net
and Inbody sent in some threaten
ing corner kicks that Bronco
sophomore goalkeeper Rusty
Johnson just tapped out of danger.
Defensively, Zapala was busy
grappling with the Bronco offense,
pulling out some impressive saves
despite the slick conditions.
Stanford took charge 18 minutes
into the second half again via the
heroics of Hemmerich, who found
the back of the net off a direct kick.
But there was still just under a half
an hour of soccer remaining, and
judging from past games, a win
would not be this simple. With 12
minutes remaining, Smith tallied
his second goal of the night for the
Broncos with a shot from senior de
fender Adam Eyre and sophomore
forward Anthony Chimienti.
The 2-2 tie propelled the teams
into a sudden-death overtime that
was marred by more missed oppor
tunities. Co-captain defender Ger
ard Davis made some threatening
runs up the side and freshmen
Todd Dunivant. Roger Levesque
and Johanes Maliza kept the offen
sive effort alive with a series of

four-overtime game against Santa Clara Friday night. The game
eventually ended in a shootout, with Santa Clara sinking its sixth
shot to break the 2-2 tie.
