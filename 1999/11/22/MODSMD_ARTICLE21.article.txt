some NCAA hardware.
The national championship
race, which takes place at 8 a.m.

MEN'S CROSS COUNTRY
■ Today: Stanford at NCAA Cham
pionships at Bloomington, Ind.

Among the 31-team field. Stan
ford faces off against a group of
about five teams, all with roughly
equal scoring capabilities, in the
battle for the team title.
Top-ranked Arkansas is the
clear favorite, but No. 3 North
Carolina State, No. 4 Wisconsin
and No. 5 Colorado could all con
tend for the top spot should
Arkansas falter. Sixth-ranked Ari
zona has defeated Stanford once
this year, at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence meet.
"We have the intrinsic goals of
trying to do the best we can and all
that, but if you're looking for
something quantifiable, we're try
ing to see what we can do to be in
the top four," Lananna said.
Last year at Rim Rock Farm in
Lawrence, Kan., Stanford's run at
a third-straight national title was
stopped by the Razorbacks, who

with 400 meters to go.
The battle at the front of the
pack will likely boil down to Ore
gon's Steve Fein, Southern Alaba
ma's David Kimani.and Stanford's
Riley and Jennings.
Stanford will need to keep the
spread between its first and fifth
scorers as small as possible if it
hopes to contend for team honors.
"We have to keep our gap at 45
seconds." Lananna said. "The
teams that finish within 30t045 sec
onds and have a reasonable posi
tion for their front runners, those
teams do well."
The pack mentality has been key

to Stanford's successes thus far.
However, maintaining a pack in the
NCAA field of 255 runners will cer
tainly be difficult.
"We have to make sure that
we're tough," Lananna said. "It will
he important to maintain our com
posure and our cool throughout,
yet remain in a good position.
There is a delicate balance between
the two. You have to keep your
head up until at least two miles,
when things start to get tough."
Stanford gained valuable knowl
edge of the Bloomington course at
the Oct. 16 Pre-NCAA meet. That
race covered only eight of the full

10 kilometers.
"There's plenty of room to pass,
plenty of room to move up,"
Lananna said. At Rim Rock, some
of Stanford's runners were caught
up in the congested pack and were
unable to advance quickly.
"It certainly is a difficult
course," Lananna said. "Cioing
around the first turn is the only
place that presents a problem —
people tend to get bottled up in
there."
Stanford won the Pre-NCAA
meet over Colorado and Arizona,
but Arkansas, Wisconsin were not
in attendance.
