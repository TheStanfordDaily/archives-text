WOMEN'S
CROSS COUNTRY
■ Today: Stanford at NCAA Cham
pionships at Bloomington. Ind.

Coming off a season of domina
tion topped by sweeps of the first
three individual spots at both the Pa
cific 10 Conference Championships
and the Western Regional Qualifi
er, the No. 1 Cardinal has one more
challenge to meet today at the
NCAA Championships in Bloom
ington, Ind.
Neither the Indiana University
cross country course nor the compe
tition that will line up next to the
Stanford women will be unfamiliar.
En route to its undisputed No. 1
ranking going into today's 9:15 a.m.
start, the Cardinal has thoroughly
defeated the rest of the top-five
ranked teams including No. 2 BYIJ
on three occasions. No. 3 Arkansas,
No. 4 Wisconsin and No. 5 Col
orado.

At the Pre-N( AAs held here on
Oct. 16, the Cardinal beat its nearest
competitor. BYIJ. by 39 points with
freshman I tin Sullivan leading the

way. Sullivan was edged onl\ by
Colorado's undefeated Kara

Junior Ail-American Julia Stamps, one of the top runners who will
be competing today at the NCAA Cross Country meet in Indiana,
will be hoping to win a National title for both herself and her team,
which missed the crown last year by a mere five points.

of Villanova and one point off of
BYU.
"They've won everything this
year and they've won it handily, so I
have to think that they're confident
going in." said Stanford head coach
Vin Lananna.
"I think that these women are in
telligent enough to know that it
doesn't really matter what you do all
season. It's a matter of going into the
meet physically, emotionally and
psychologically well-prepared and I
think that they're confident that
those things are in place."
Definite runners for Stanford
today will be Stamps, Sullivan, se

nior-captain Sally Glynn and fresh
man Lauren Fleshman. At last year's
meet in Lawrence. K;in.. Glynn and
Stamps finished fifth and sixth, re
spectively. Thus far this season, these
four women's accomplishments have
been outstanding, with Stamps win
ning the West Regional Qualifier.
Sullivan taking the Pac-lOs, and
Glynn earning runner-up honors at
Pac-lOs. Fleshman had been solid,
finishing third at both meets.
It is conceivable that any one of
these four women could take the in
dividual title. While the competition
is great from around the country.
Stanford might have all the drive it
needs in Cardinal red.
"I'm not sure that there is compe
tition among the team members,"
I .ananna said. "But we do have a lot
of women who have had equal per

formances all season: as a result
we're stronger."
Also likely to race for Stanford is
freshman Muriel Lttingcr. After a
strong showing at both the BYU and
Stanford Invitationals early in the
season, Lttingcr made a mark in
Bloomington at the Pre-NCAAs
with a 27th-place finish. Unfortu
nately. emergency appendix surgery
kept her from Pac-lOs and regionals.
but she should be ready to step in
today.
"Lttingcr is doing fine. They
didn't touch her legs." Lananna said.

Stanford will look to senior Mary
Huang, last year's tilth scorer, or
sophomore Laura Turner to fill the
gap for the Cardinal, while kimi

for Arkansas' No. 5 spot.
It all comes down to maintaining
composure, and the Cardinal, except
for a minor bout with heat exhaus

cool all season long.
"We know there is still a lot of
work we need to focus on and its not
going to be an easy win at all."
Stamps said.
"We have learned that from pre

needs in Cardinal red.
"I'm not sure that there is compe
tition among the team members,"
I .ananna said. "But we do have a lot
of women who have had equal per

formances all season: as a result
we're stronger."
Also likely to race for Stanford is
freshman Muriel Lttingcr. After a
strong showing at both the BYU and
Stanford Invitationals early in the
season, Lttingcr made a mark in
Bloomington at the Pre-NCAAs
with a 27th-place finish. Unfortu
nately. emergency appendix surgery
kept her from Pac-lOs and regionals.
but she should be ready to step in
today.
"Lttingcr is doing fine. They
didn't touch her legs." Lananna said.
With BYl' winning the Mountain
Region Qualifier by placing runners
in the second through sixth spots,
depth at the No. 5 spot lor Stanford
may make or break the Cardinal as
well as the Arkansas I .adybacks.
If Ettinger doesn't return to form.

Stanford will look to senior Mary
Huang, last year's tilth scorer, or
sophomore Laura Turner to fill the
gap for the Cardinal, while kimi
Welsh and Christin Wurth will battle
for Arkansas' No. 5 spot.
It all comes down to maintaining
composure, and the Cardinal, except
for a minor bout with heat exhaus
tion that Stamps endured, has kept
cool all season long.
"We know there is still a lot of
work we need to focus on and its not
going to be an easy win at all."
Stamps said.
"We have learned that from pre
vious years. Basically, we're just
going in there with the same attitude
that we've had the whole season. Just
to stay cool, calm and relaxed and to
remember that having fun »is the
main goal."
