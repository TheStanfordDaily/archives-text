After Friday night's win over
University of San Francisco, 75-64,
Cardinal head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said that the team needed
more from sophomore forward
Bethany Donaphin.
On Sunday afternoon, Van-
Derveer got what she asked for.
Donaphin had a career-high 26

points in the Cardinal victory over
No. 6 lowa State 95-82. She was
diving for loose balls, posting up
strong, and looking to pass to
teammates.

â–  Sunday: Stanford 95, No. 6 lowa
State K2.

"She's big time," VanDerveer
said. "She's got more. She's got a

lot of moves. She can go either
hand, either way."
Donaphin led the team in re
bounds as well on Sunday, with
nine total. She played excellent de
fense. playing 16 minutes in the
first half with just one foul, and was
still scrambling on the floor for
loose balls with less than five min
utes to go in the game.
