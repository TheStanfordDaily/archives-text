### Kelsey Colvin Contributing writer 
After Friday night's win over
University of San Francisco, 75-64,
Cardinal head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said that the team needed
more from sophomore forward
Bethany Donaphin.
On Sunday afternoon, Van-
Derveer got what she asked for.
Donaphin had a career-high 26

points in the Cardinal victory over
No. 6 lowa State 95-82. She was
diving for loose balls, posting up
strong, and looking to pass to
teammates.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Sunday: Stanford 95, No. 6 lowa
State K2.

"She's big time," VanDerveer
said. "She's got more. She's got a

lot of moves. She can go either
hand, either way."
Donaphin led the team in re
bounds as well on Sunday, with
nine total. She played excellent de
fense. playing 16 minutes in the
first half with just one foul, and was
still scrambling on the floor for
loose balls with less than five min
utes to go in the game.
The Cardinal was nine for 19
(.474) on the three-point line Sun
day, with sophomore guard Lauren
St. Clair hitting five and finishing
the game with a career-high 17
points. St. Clair also contributed six
assists to the Cardinal offense.
"I had more confidence with
what I was doing because I was so
excited she was doing what she was
doing," Donaphin said.
St. Clair had the tough job of
guarding junior forward Megan

Taylor, the Cyclone's versatile sec
ond-leading scorer. Taylor was
lowa State's top scorer for the
game with 23 points — she was five
for 11 from the three-point line.
Senior guard Milena Mores also
made some important shots down
the stretch.
She hit two three-point shots in
the second half and was 6 for 6 on
the free-throw line. She played 38
minutes of the game and finished
with 19 points and nine assists.
"I thought this was a really big
game lor Milena," VanDerveer
said.
"She's always looking to pass,"

said Cyclone senior guard Stacy
Frese. "She's always looking to
make her teammates better."
Flores held Frese, the Cyclone's
top scorer last season, to only three
points in the first half. Frese fin
ished the game with IS points.
Flores' defensive presence was a
major factor in the Cardinal's wins
on Friday and Sunday. She consis
tently had her hands in her oppo
nents' pockets, getting countless
deflections and keeping constant
pressure on whoever was handling
the ball.
Although she struggled on Sun
day, junior center Carolyn Moos
was the leading scorer and re
bounder on Friday night, with 16
points and 12 rebounds.
Sophomore center Cori En
ghusen continues to come into
games and create for the Stanford
offense. She had 11 points against
San Francisco, including a couple
of hook shots reminiscent of Kevin
McHale.
"I'm very excited about Cori,"
VanDervecr said on Friday. "I
thought Cori was the one who got
our inside game going."
Enghusen played only eight
minutes in the fast-paced game on
Sunday, and finished with four per
sonal fouls. She scored seven
points.
Sophomore forward Enjoli
Izidor played consistently well this
weekend, too. She had 14 points
and seven rebounds against the
Dons on Friday, and 11 points and
six rebounds against the Cyclone
on Sunday.
VanDerveer's emphasis in prac
tice on defense and rebounding
paid off for the Cardinal this week
end. particularly in Friday night's
game, where the Cardinal offense
was never quite in synch.
Stanford outrebounded San
Francisco 50 -40. The Cardinal
dominated the boards on Sunday
with 41 rebounds to lowa State's
27.
The Cardinal's scrappy and ag
gressive play resulted in two wins
this weekend and, if it continues,
should make the team a strong
competitor for the rest of the sea
son.
This is just the beginning, and if
Stanford can get every player
working at their potential every
game, then the squad that wasn't
ranked in the top 25 for the first
time in more than 10 years has def
inite NCAA Tournament poten
tial.
