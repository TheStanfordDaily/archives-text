WOMEN'S SOCCER
■ Friday: No. 5 Notre Dame (20-3-0)
1, No. 8 Stanford (15-4-1)0..

The Cardinal played its final game
of the season when it lost 1 -0 to No. 5
Notre Dame on Friday night in South
Bend, Ind.
"It was a tough game to lose,"
head coach Steve Swanson said. "We
played well enough to win and I can
honestly say that we had just as many
good chances as they did [to score.]."
The year came to an quick end for
Stanford, which won a Pacific 10
Conference title and made it further
than any Stanford team since 1993.
"It was tough for us because we
had such momentum going into the
tournament," senior co-captain Jen
nifer O'Sullivan said. "We were play
ing really well, had so many chances
to score, and then it's suddenly over."
Notre Dame, which has made an
appearance in three of the last four
Final Fours, evenly battled the Cardi
nal into the final minutes of the game.
Senior Kelly Adamson created
numerous scoring opportunities for

the Cardinal in the first half of play. In
the 15th minute, Adamson hit a shot
that was cleared off the goalline by
Notre Dame's Vanessa Pru/kinsky.
"Kelly had a great game and was a
threat to their defense," O'Sullivan
said. "She worked hard to create
chances and nearly put a few away."
Adamson's next goal-scoring op
portunity was stolen by Notre Dame
goalkeeper LaKeyesia Beene in the
28th minute. Adamson attempted to
head a ball into the upper right corner
of the goal from the 8 yard line but
Beene snatched it from the air.
Notre Dame's goal-scoring op
portunities were stymied by junior
goalkeeper Carly Smolak. In the24th
and 33rd minutes of the game, Smo
lak came up with crucial saves to keep
the Cardinal hopes for victory alive.
Notre Dame forwards Jenny Heft
and Ashley Dryer's attempts on goal
were rejected by Smolak, who
recorded six saves on the game.
"Carly pulled through for us,"
O'Sullivan said. "Her saves in the
first half really kept us in the game."
In the second half, the Irish
seemed to dominate the Cardinal,
outshooting Stanford 8-4 in the half
and 15-9 on the game.
"Notre Dame is a good squad."
Swanson said. "They are a strong and
athletic team with very sound tactical
players."
The goal for the Irish came on a

free kick with 8 minutes left. The ball
was served into the box, but Stanford
was able to clear the first and second
shots off this re-start. It was on the
third shot that freshman Mia Sarke
sian shot the ball into the upper right
corner of the box, from 15 yards out.
And the Cardinal fought back.
"I never thought we were out of it,
not even when they scored with 8
minutes to go," Swanson said.
The Cardinal managed to work
the ball up into the Irish half of the
field. With 7 minutes to go in the half,
an Irish defender gave up a hand ball,
giving Stanford a penalty kick.
Senior Ronnie Fair stepped up to
take the kick. Fair's shot hit the left
post and then ran across the mouth of
the goal, hitting off the right post be
fore it was cleared out of the box.
"We certainly had some other
very good chances," Swanson said.
"You can't focus on that. Ronnie has
won so many games for us this sea
son. Others might say that that was
critical, but there were other, equally
as critical chances lor us in the game."
As it came to an end for the Cardi
nal Friday night, the team left more
than just its effort and aspirations on
the field; it left a promise to return.
"We didn't make it as far as we
wanted to go this year, but we had a
great run at things," O'Sullivan said.
"As a senior, 1 might not be back next
year, but the team will."
As the final whistle blew on Friday
night, it signified the end of the game
and the end of the season for the No.
8 Stanford women's soccer team.
