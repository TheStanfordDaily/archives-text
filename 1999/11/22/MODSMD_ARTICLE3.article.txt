third quarter," said senior Corey
Griffin, a member ol the Axe C om
mittee. "They shouldn't have come
in until the last tew minutes of the
fourth quarter. It shouldn't have
been the parade that it was.
"It definitely took away from a
few minutes of what is a very impor
tant game for both teams." he added.
Junior Jeff Cooper, a yell leader,
said he believed the Stanford Police
Department was trying to prepare
for a "worst-case scenario."
"What they were trying to do was
set a precedent of people not rushing
onto the field." he said. "But I think
they could have gotten away with less
security."
Cooper added that the appear
ance of the police may have com
pelled students to act out even more.
"In one way. you could look at it
as causing more problems." he said.
Though the police presence was
controversial among students and
fans, it was simply part of the Univer
sity's increased safety measures.
I lubbard told the Associated Press.
"There was a lot of concern about
this, and 1 said. "We want to send a
message," " I lubbard said. "We want
a safe game."
The new security measures were
prompted by safety concerns for stu
dents and the destruction of the play
ing fields in the past two Big Games.
Last year, fans charging the UC-
Berkeley field after the Stanford vic
tory injured three police officers. In
19%. fans rushed the field and at
tacked the Tree, tearing apart the
costume.
Cooper maintains that the police
presence "caught everyone off
guard."
"The presentation was done
abysmally badly." he said, referring
to the point when police marched
onto the field in a single-file line. "It
utterly defeated the morale of our
whole section. Basically, the whole
fourth quarter was dead silent be
cause people were too busy booing
the cops. It was really a shame."
