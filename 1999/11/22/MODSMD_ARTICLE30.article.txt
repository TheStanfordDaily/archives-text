# Distinct grammar, vocabulary set African-American speech apart
## Linguist says Ebonics is a dialect 
### Susan Cameron 
Jacquelyn Rahman, a doctoral
student in linguistics, spoke last Fri
day on "Attitudes to Black English,
Standard and Vernacular," the
penultimate lecture in the African
and Afro-American Lecture Series.
The audience present at Rah
man's speech was large, filling Room
30 in Building 2(K).
Rahman said that there are two
types of black English: Black Stan
dard English (BSE) and African
American Vernacular English
(AAVE). commonly referred to as
Ebonics. BSF maintains the gram
mar and structure of Standard Eng
lish. yet varies the intonation, pro
nunciation and word choice.
AAVE, on the other hand, is anoth
er dialect of English, just like British
English. Australian English. Indian
English or any of the ot her variations
of the language found around the
world.
Rahman emphasized that
"AAVE is not inferior to other di
alects. It has structure and rules that

govern its usage, just as other di
alects do."
Rahman has been conducting a
study on campus to determine what
the attitude is toward black language
and how that attitude affects black
students. Rahman found that black
students "feel language is very close
ly related to their economic success."
The black community finds itself
held to a double standard, she said.
In the workplace, they are expected
to speak Standard English (SE). yet
if they speak this way to close friends
or other black people, they are stig
matized as an "Oreo" or a "Carl
ton." a character from the television
show "The Fresh Prince of Bel Air."
Although she said the use of both
BSE and AAVE has caused prob
lems. Rahman also found that the
black community takes pride in their
dialect. One student who participat
ed in Rahman's study said that "It's
like jazz. It's ours."
Just like the African-American
community, Rahman pointed out
that America as a whole has a "love
hate relationship with black lan

guage." On the one hand, America
stigmatizes the use of the black di
alect. while at the same time adopt
ing many of its phrases, she said.
Rahman hypothesized that the
reason black teenagers are constant
ly inventing new words is so they can
have something that is theirs and
that has not yet been stolen by main
stream society.
It is unclear, however, if the com
mon use of black phrases in pop cul
ture represents a growing accep
tance of the black dialect, or if the
"African American Vernacular is
only accepted as a marketing strate
gy." as sophomore Jerri Kay said
during the question-and-answer pe
riod following the speech. "On the
everyday level, it is still thought to be
a mark of poor education."
Rahman believes that "classes
that teach linguistic tolerance are
necessary to counter linguistic pre ju
dices." Rahman concluded by saying
that she wants America to educate
itself about the true nature of
A AVE. so that all can speak without
fear of stigmatization.
