## Stanford defeats Cal in Big Game to make first Rose Bowl trip in 28 years. 
### TIM KANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
An indelible image of the Stanford football
team filled the sideline under the cloudy Satur
day afternoon sk v — that of stars and reserves,
seniors and freshmen, players and coaches
alike, all raising the same object toward the
heavens.
A rose.
In the l()2nd Big Game, the Cardinal defeat
ed California 31-13 iti front of K0.746 rain

soaked fans at Stanford Stadium, and managed
to accomplish what had eluded their predeces
sors for 28 years — an outright conference
championship and a berth in the Rose Bowl,
against Big I'en champ Wisconsin.
"It's a great feeling, for our seniors, for our
coaches, for everybody involved with our pro
gram. to have this moment, to have this oppor
tunity. to be the undisputed [Pacific 10 Confer
ence] champion and Rose Bowl representative.
It feels great." said an unusually exuberant head
coach Tyrone Willingham following the victory,
sporting a grin from ear to ear for the first time
in recent memory.
The crucial point in the game occurred at the
beginning of the fourth quarter with the Cardi
nal up 21-13. Irom his own six-yard line. Stan
ford sophomore fullback Casey Moore sped

through a gaping hole in the Cal defensive line
and rumbled yards into the end zone to give
tin' Stanford some breathing room and put the
game out of reach at 2S-13.
There weren't exactly a lot of surprises in this
Big Game. It was common knowledge that Cal
had a below-average offense, Stanford had a lot
of offense, and Deltha O'Neal is an outstanding
football player. Sure enough, all of these things
were confirmed Saturday — and also. Stan
ford's maligned defense turned in an impressive
performance that may keep the critics off their
back for a while, albeit against a very weak op
ponent.
"Words don't describe how proud I am of
this group." said Stanford defensive coordina-

tor Kent Baer. "All they read all
week long is how good ( al's defense
is, and they are. They deserve it. But
sooner or later that wears on you, and
I saw earlier in the week that our kids
took this to heart. When you have as
much riding on this game, you worry
about over-preparing, hut these kids
were right up where they needed to
be."
Calling Cal's offense weak might
be an understatement. Led by third
string quarterback and first-time
starter Wes Dalton, Cal generated a
mere 70 yards of offense and three
first downs through the third quarter,
ending the game with 130 yards on of
fense and zero points produced. Cal
was saved from a goose egg on the
scoreboard by its one-man wrecking
crew, senior cornerback / kick re
turner O'Neal.
O'Neal returned a kickoff KM)
yards and a punt 5K yards, both for
touchdowns, despite Willingham's
efforts to take him out of the game.
"The plan with Deltha was for him
not to touch the football, whatever it
took for him not to touch the football.
We were good for a couple occasions,
and a couple occasions we were not
that good." Willingham s;iid in what
might be termed as a massive under
statement.
"I think you have to take your hat
off to Deltha.... For him to return
those balls in the manner that he did.
it's just fantastic. We were trying
everything we could to keep [the ball]
away from him, and every time he
touched it.he made something big

happen. I le's a fantastic player, as
good a player as I think there is in the
Pac-10 Conference."
Stanford also turned a subpar per
formance offensively in comparison
to its typical output. The Cardinal
piled up 410 yards, no small amount
but below its season average of 472.
Todd I lusak threw for 21(i yards on
11-of-26 passing along with one
touchdown, while Moore con
tributed 1 l(i yards on six carries and
senior Hanker Troy Walters hauled in

six catches for 126 yards.
With its first possession, the Stan
ford offensive machine showed why
it was ranked fourth in the nation —
a Troy Walters reception followed by
three Brian Allen runs staked the
Cardinal to a 7-0 lead in less than two
minutes. On the ensuing kickoff,
however, O'Neal managed to make
the Stanford kickoff unit look help
less, running up the middle, cutting to

O'Neal certainly did his part on
defense as well. Blanketing Walters
in the end zone, he intercepted a
Husak pass for his NCAA-leading
ninth pick of the year, halting a Stan
ford drive in the first half. For most of
the afternoon, O'Neal generally
locked up whichever receiver he hap
pened to be covering at the time, nar
rowing Husak's options and con
tributing to his lower-than-normal
passing numbers.
The Cardinal would take the lead
on a one-yard dive by Moore into the
end zone during the second quarter.
Later in the quarter O'Neal torched
the Stanford punting unit, taking ad
vantage of a low line drive kick by
Sean Tolpinrud and, much like the
first time, cutting and running his way
to the end zone. Junior defensive
tackle Willie Howard would block
the extra point, keeping Stanford
ahead at 14-13.
Husak led the Stanford offense
back on a five-play, 81 -yard drive cul
minating in a lofting pass to junior
wideout Dave Davis over the middle
good for a 36-yard touchdown, in
creasing Stanford's lead to 21-13
going into the half. From that point
on, Stanford made the wise decision
not to let O'Neal near the ball on
kickoffs; kicker Mike Biselli deliber
ately kicked the hall short or out of
bounds rather than give the Cal star
another chance to run into the end
zone.
The third quarter, unfortunately,
turned out to be perhaps one of the
ugliest quarters of the year. Stan
ford's offense suddenly lost its
rhythm. Cal's offense continued to
lack any semblance of a rhythm and
the two teams combined for eight
punts during the quarter. Not sur
prisingly, no one scored, leaving the
score at 21 -13, Stanford.
The closest the Cal offense came
to a drive was at the beginning of the
fourth quarter, when the Bears
gained 41 yards on 10 plays, before
stalling and punting. The Cardinal
found itself pinned back deep in its
own territory, but Moore brought the
Stanford faithful to their feet with his
exciting run on second down.
"1 knew had some decent
speed I was just hoping they
wouldn't catch me." said the sopho
more fullback about his long run to
the end zone, which was the second
longest in Stanford history and
longest in Big Game history.
At this point, the handwriting was
on the wall for Cal. The Bears were
plagued by penalties all afternoon,
and still found themselves unable to
consistently move the ball on offense.
Stanford bled time off the clock with
each possession, until the outcome of
the game because clear with about
five minutes left, when the Cardinal
faithful took up the "Rose Bowl.
Rose Bowl" chant. The players
began holding up the roses with
about two minutes left, and after the
final whistle sounded it was time for
the celebration to begin.
"It's something I appreciate now
and I cherish right now, but 1 think
it's something for in 20 years, when
we look back and say 'We did it. That
was our ultimate goal and we
reached it.' They're going to talk
about us like we talk about the '7J
team, that they were a great team and
they came together when they need
ed to." Husak said.
Notre Dame awaits Stanford next
week, in a game that will mean very
little — the Cardinal has clinched a
trip to the Roses, and the Fighting
Irish became ineligible for a bowl
with a loss to Boston College Satur
day. For Cardinal fans, their thoughts
will be not on the Irish, but rather on
Jan. 1, when Stanford will travel
down to Pasadena to meet NCAA
career rushing leader Ron Dayne
and the Wisconsin Badgers in the
Rose Bowl.
Hopefully the next trip to the
Rose Bowl for the Cardinal won't be
28 years from now. but this team will
be remembered nonetheless
picked to finish eighth in the Pac-1()
in the preseason media poll, over
coming a potentially devastating loss
at Texas in the first game of the sea
son and rebounding from an upset
loss to San Jose State to reach the
pinnacle of the Pac-10. All season
long, the players were disparaged,
the coaches criticized, but when all is
said and done, this team has earned
the right to call themselves champi
ons.
Champions of the Pac-10.
