Stanford in the Rose Bowl?
What?
" This is a real sense of euphoria,"
said Stanford head coach Iyrone
Willingham. "You've accomplished
something that a lot of people just
don't understand."
To say "a lot of people don't un
derstand" is a glaring understate
ment. How could a team that started
the season limping back from I cxas
after a 69-17 shellacking at the hands
of the Longhorns, ranked dead last
of Division I football teams in total
defense for three weeks and lost to a
struggling San Jose State team at
midseason be going to the Rose
Bowl?

But after Saturday's game, those
questions didn't matter to the ('ardi
nal.
"It's something I appreciate now
and I cherish right now. but I think
it's something for in 20 years, when
we look hack and say 'We did it."
They're going to talk about us like
we talk about the '71 team," s;iid se
nior quarterback Todd I lus;ik.
And if "they" talk about 1999
with just a little bit more confusion in
their voices, so be it. The Cardinal
which has relied on sleight-of-hand
and the alignment of the stars as
much as it has on their potent of
fense to win the Pacific 10 Confer
ence — is making no excuses.
For Saturday night at least, ques
tions of "how" didn't bother the
Cardinal.
"That was really cool," Husak
said. "It's kind of surreal right now.
Getting to the Rose Bowl was some
thing our team set as a goal last Jan
uary." he said to reporters after the
game. "But if we had said that, you
guys would have laughed at it."
Husak wasn't the onlv one tloat

ing in the clouds.
"The granddaddy of 'em all."
senior Hanker Tro\ Walters. "It still
hasn't sunk in."
Eventually, the Cardinal
preparing for its Jan. 1 game against
Wisconsin in Pasadena — will have
to take stock of where the team is
and where it will have to be to have a
chance ;ig;iinst the Badgers. So how
has the Cardinal done it?
Perhaps the most surprising in
gredient h;is been a surprise running
game. Stanford started the season
with a sure-bet receiving corps,
headed by preseason All-America
candidate Troy Walters. Walters
was joined by proven forces in junior
Dave Davis and senior Deßonnie
Pitts. Add in senior quarterback
Todd I lusak. and at least the Cardi
nal's air game looked solid before
the first snap.
Hie running game, however, was
a huge question maik. Last season's
team averaged a painful 1? yards per
game; and the team's onlv solid run

in Big Game history — which broke open the game early in the fourth quarter.
