# The
						Magic of Big Game
## Players, fans and coaches celebrate redemption with convincing win.

Willie I Eoward stood in the lock
er room after Saturday's 102 nd Big
Game, still wearing his lull set of
pads. In one hand he held a single
red rose, and, in the other, his hel
met, covered with grass stains and
mud. Around his neck hung a metal
chain, the symbol of Stanford's
"Trench Dogs", the interior line
men who helped anchor a Stanford
defense that often bent, but seldom
broke, and came through with a
masterful performance in Big
Game.
Howard, the physical and emo
tional leader of the Stanford de
fense. seemed to stand much taller
than his 6-foot, 4-inch frame as the
other players, reporters and coaches
milled about the locker, awash with
the energy that carried Stanford on
the field against California and
throughout the course of the season.
I loward's face, a mask of fierce
intensity throughout the game, bore
a look of complete happiness and
contentment.
I he look of mothers and fathers
who see their newborn children for
the first time.
The look of young children sur
veying all of their Christmas pre
sents underneath the tree.
The look of a warrior. A football
player who endured winning just
four games in his high-school career;
who saw his team picked to finish
eighth in the conference at the sea
son's outset; who saw Stanford lose
its first contest of the season 69-17 to
Texas.
I he look of a man who saw his
and Ins teammates' commitment to
overcome all the obstacles and win
an outright conference title and a
trip to Pasadena for the first time in
28 years fulfilled.
112 inally, Willie Howard could
smile.
And so could the Stanford play
ers. coaches, fans and alumni who
have suffered through a 2N-year
Rose Howl drought.
I he emotion was clearly on dis
play at game's end as the celebration

began while the precious few sec
onds ticked off the clock.
As the rain clouds parted and the
dusk sun shone majestically over the
golden rim of Stanford Stadium, it
truly was one of sport's magical mo
ments.
Fans serenaded players with
chants of "Rose Bowl", as it begun
to sink in. just as it did for Willie
Howard. Players celebrated in front
of the student section, each clutch
ing a long-stemmed red rose.
That "it"was the realization that
the Stanford football team, ma
ligned bv critics all season for its
losses to Texas and San Jose State,
for its chronically shaky defense and
for playing in the "weak" Pac-1(),
had earned sole possession of the
conference title and a berth in the
Rose Bowl.
And how sweet "it"was.
The Stanford team, which had
suffered not only this season, but in
the past two, had reason to let loose

with all the emotion players could
muster.
Some danced wildly and
screamed, pounding each others'
shoulder pads, while others were
more subdued, calmly taking stock
of the magnitude of the situation.
Yet, no matter how they cele
brated, each and every player felt
the overwhelming sense of accom
plishment in their achievement.
Players jubilantly filed into the
locker room for the postgame dis
cussion. Although these are closed
to the press, the door was left
cracked.
All that could be heard above the
din of the celebration was a chant
led by an unknown member of the
team. The words "Whose house
C'-House! Whose house .... Our
1 louse! " rang out in steady cadence,
growing louder and louder with
each iteration.
As the look on Willie Howard's
face could attest, the Stanford foot
ball team had proven again to the
players and fans from Cal, and now
to the Pac-1() and to the nation, that
this was our house.
