# Oft-maligned defense shines throughout rain-soaked game
## ”Trench Dogs“ prove bite is mightier than bark on Saturday. 
### BEN FREDA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Usually, the Cardinal plays the
annual Big Game against archrival
California.
Hut this year, it played against a
man named Deltha O'Neal. And
O'Neal was able to keep it close for
a quarter and a half.
Until a few minutes before half
time. O'Neal, a senior cornerback
who anchors Cal's defense — and
their whole team for that matter —
had kept the Bears virtually tied
with Stanford by virtue of two spec
tacular plays: a thrilling 100-yard
kickoff return that tied the score at 7
and a 58-yard punt return that
brought Cal to within one at 14-13.
Those 13 points — all created by
a single defensive and special-teams
player - were all that the Bears
could muster.
Then, he stalled a Cardinal drive
and scoring threat — by inter
cepting a pass from senior Todd
Husak to All-America candidate
Troy Walters.
But his performance wasn't a sur
prise. O'Neal's reputation as a mag
ical kick-returner and incredible
athlete had preceded him.
"We tried to do everything we
could to keep the ball away from
him." said Stanford head coach Ty
rone Willingham. "The plan was for
Deltha to not touch the ball."
"They were crazy to kick it to
him." said Cal head coach Tom Hol
moe.
In fact, after being bitten twice by
the Deltha bug. the Cardinal sent all
the rest of its punts and kickoffs
safely away from O'Neal, even tak
ing an out-of-bounds penalty rather
than put the ball in his hands.
And. luckily for the Cardinal,
that simple move sealed the game.
Without O'Neal — who only plays
on defense and special teams, not on

offense — touching the ball, the
Bears did little more than struggle
and drown.
"There weren't enough Deltha's
to go around," I lolmoc said.
But here's the point. The fact that
O'Neal was Cal's only weapon
means one thing: the Cardinal de
fense — the same defense that spent
the season weathering criticism as
the weakest in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence — stopped Cal's offense cold
on the field yesterday.
The Cardinal stymied Cal's pass
ing game throughout the game,
throwing filth-year quarterback
Wes Dalton off balance with mixed
blitzes and heavy rushing. He was
sacked six times, lost 2X yards rush
ing. had mounds of trouble timing
the offense and finished the day 11
for 25 with 119 yards.
Stanford linebacker Mark Stock
baucr spent more time in the Cal
back field than any of the Cal run
ning backs.
Stanford didn't let Cal's rushing
game have much more. Only fresh
man running back Joe Igber finished
with positive yards for the Bears
with a paltry 53.
But what does that mean? Does
it mean that the Cardinal defense,
the same squad that for three weeks
this autumn sat dead last among Di
vision I schools in total offense but
was able to rise to No. 113 of 114
teams before Saturday's game,
learned its trade to perfection over
the last week?

"We've been beat up pretty good
in the press," said defensive coordi
nator Kent Baer, "but I've said ail
along that you've got to he a pretty
good defense to win seven games in
this conference.
"I'd take the No. 114 defense in
the country and go the Rose Bowl
rather than be No. 1 in the country
and not go to the Rose Bowl."
Truth be told, the Cardinal de
fense did look a lot healthier yester
day than it has so far this season. The
secondary — which on some days
looks like Swiss cheese — was able
to stick with Cal's receivers, tight
enough to knock down many of Dal
ton's passes, despite the loss of se
nior cornerback Ruben Carter.
And the defensive line had the
sort of day that comes rarely. Stock
bauer. fellow seniors Andrew Cur
rie and Willie Howard and junior
Riall Johnson, members of Stan
ford's "Trench Dogs", had an excep
tional game, smothering Dalton for
sacks twice and recovering a fumble.
"I don't know if it was my best
game, but it was one of the most
fun," Stockbaucr said. "It's the one
I'll remember forever."
So maybe the Cardinal defense
does perform better in the clutch. But
the ultimate test will be in Pasadena
Jan. l.whcn the Cardinal defense will
be called upon to contain the Bad
gers' Ron Daync, who last week
broke the NCAA career record for
rushing yardage. Payne might be the
best college running back ever.
