With more than 50 years of teach
ing on the Farm behind him. Art
Prof. Matt Kahn holds the unofficial
record as the most senior professor
to ever teach at Stanford.
To commemorate his long teach
ing career, which began when he was
just 21. Kahn gave a lecture on Nov.
19 entitled "Cyclops," in reference to
the single eye of a camera. T he audi
ence. which had more than 350 peo
ple, overflowed out of Annenberg
Auditorium.
In his introduction to Kahn's pre
sentation. Nate Oliveira, a former
colleague of Kahn's in the art de
partment, said. "The primary ingre
dient of his identity and accomplish
ments is that they've been surround
ed by love for anything he touches
and anvthing he cares about."

Celebrating 50
years of teaching
art at Stanford,
Art Prof. Matt
Kahn embraces a
friend and sup
porter in a recep
tion at the Art
Gallery following
his speech in An
nenburg Audito
rium.
Kahn was horn in New York City,
where he attended the I ligh School of
Music and Art and began teaching at
Stanford the year he graduated from
Cranbrook Academy in 1949 at age
21.
Kahn headed the design program
here for many years, and began the
joint program between design and
mechanical engineering, which has
experienced overenrollment nearly
every year since its creation.
He also taught studio art at Stan
ford in Florence, and this influence
was clearly visible in his body of work,
for. as he said, "the Cyclops comes
alive on foreign territory."
He began by illustrating light as
the primary subject of any photo
graph. using slides of the Arno river,
the Matterhorn. jack-o-lanterns. the
Washington Monument and a Cadil
lac hood ornament, among others.

Additionally, he spoke about the
creative process, particularly in the
art of photography.
"We don't take pictures, we make
pictures," Kahn said. "Sometimes we
find great thrust in our subject, and it
we follow it. we may find a pot of gold
at the other end."
Unfortunately, as he taught stu
dents who have increasingly ad
vanced equipment, he often found his
students to be "far, far better
equipped technologically than cultur
ally."
In his half-century of teaching.
Kahn has no doubt done a great deal
to equip several generations of Stan
ford students with that cultural and
creative knowledge.
From his first words about light
through his speaking of the composi
tion of his photos and the roles
human figures play in them, it he
came clear to the audience, which
filled the aisles and doorways in addi
tion to the seats, that art for Kahn is
about love for the creative process.
