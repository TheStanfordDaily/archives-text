Editor's Note: This story on Stan
f'ord alumni and former University
President Herbert Hoover is the third
in (i series of Jive about the top five
Stanford individuals of the century
who have left a lasting legacy at the

University and the
community, and in
Hoover's case, the
nation and the
world.
Hoover, who is
ranked third, has
been a great influ
ence on Stanford

in terms of his tenure as I 'niversity
president, us well as liis numerous
< attributions, financial aml academ
ic, to the University. I lis work in pub
lic service and the government, most
notablv his four years as U.S. presi
dent, has also left a mark on Ameri
can history and the way Stanford re
members this famous alumnus.

It is possible that no one else in

this century has shaped and con
tributed to the growth of Stanford as
Herbert I loover did.
His most familiar legacies are
those buildings students and faculty
pass bv everyday: the University
president's house, the Graduate
School of Business, the Food Re
search Institute, the Hoover Institu
tion on War. Revolution and Peace
and I loover Tower, which is so con
spicuous that it became a trademark
of the campus the day of its comple
tion.
One of Stanford's first graduates.
Hoover carried his unique college
experience throughout his life and
eventually achieved international
fame and tremendous wealth. He
was. among many things, a mining
engineer, an international entrepre
neur. a philanthropist, a well-known
benefactor, a prominent public ser
vant and president of the United
States.
Hoover started making personal
donations to the University almost


immediately after graduation. He
was a member of the Board of
Trustees for 50 years until his death
in 1%4. All of the administrative
policies made during that tumul
tuous period have borne his stamp,
for better or for worse.
"Hoover had always personified
the Stanford Spirit," said Charles
Palm, deputy director of the Hoover
Institution. "I le was Mr. Stanford."
Get into the game
Born in a small village in lowa on
Aug. 10, 1874, Herbert Clark
Hoover was the second child of a
blacksmith father, who was also a
Quaker minister, and an evangelist
mother. Both Ins parents died before
he was 10. so in 1885. he moved with
his uncle's family to ()regon. Besides
working as an office assistant for a
small company, he attended night
classes in Salem.
According to a book by I larvard
historian George Nash, "Herbert
Hoover and Stanford University, in
1891 Hoover learned that a "new.
ambitious, modern university devot
ed to the ethic of usefulness" had
been founded by Sen. I.eland Stan
ford in C 'alilornia in memory of Stan
ford's only son. Lager to make deci
sions for his own life. Hoover ig
nored the arrangements made by rel
atives and took the Stanford en
trance exam in Portland. Although
not doing well in every subject, he
impressed the interviewer. Prof.
Joseph Swain, with his "strength of
will" and "method of work."
Lour months later, at the age of
17, he found himself in the first class
of Stanford University. And, togeth
er with a friend from ()regon, he was
literally the first to occupy a room in
the men's dormitory, Lncina 11 a 11.
"It was a smaller community back
then, around 500 students," said
Margaret Kimball. University
archivist for Stanford Libraries, re
telling to Stanford's first class. "It
was a group of young men and

some young women — starting at a
young university."
At Stanford. I loover worked for
Dr. John Branner of the geology de
partment and was elected treasurer
of the \ss l
Four years of college not only
nurtured Hoover's expertise,
preparing him for his future career,
but also trained him in public service,
which later became a significant part
of his life.
On May 29, 1895, Hoover re
ceived his bachelor's degree in geol
ogy. I le was one of the first graduates
the University produced, a member
of the group affectionately called the
Pioneer Class. <
At Commencement, then-Uni
versity President David Starr Jordan
addressed the assembled Pioneers.
"(iet into the game, somehow, some
v\ here. C an y your thoughts over into
action. Do your part, and the greatest
surprise of your life will come the day
when you find out how great that
part may be."
These words no doubt had an en
duringeffect on theyounggraduates.
" •( iet into the game,' "said Palm,
speaking ol I loover. " These are the
words that make this man."
I hese words inculcated in
I loover the will of participation and
a passion for adventure. Armed with
the expertise and resourcefulness ac
quired in class, this pioneer would al
ways bear a strong consciousness of
being a part of the game.
The University's first success story
After graduation, I loover worked
in Australia as a technical consultant
for a London-based mining compa
ny. In 1899, he married his college
sweetheart, Lou llenry. Class of
1898, who he met as a senior in t he ge
ology department when she was a
freshman. The day after their wed
ding, they sailed from San Francisco
to ( Tiina, where I loover worked as a
chief engineer for two years.
From then on, I loover was on his
own as an international freelance
mining engineer and financier.
Based in London and working
around the world, he very quickly

rose to fame and success. By the sum
mer of 1914 he had already become
the director of IS mining and finan
cial companies, with assets of $55
million and interests on every conti
nent.
"Hoover was very hard working,"
Palm said. "He also knew how to
profit from what he was doing. They
prospected and then found ores
around the world and quickly be
came rich and famous."
Hoover was in England when
World War I broke out in 1914. He
helped those Americans who were
trapped in Europe find food and
shelter as well as tickets to sail back
to the United States. When Belgium
fell to German invasion. Hoover cre
ated the Commission for Relief in
Belgium to feed the civilian popula
tion. The CRB made him a hero and
also gave him first-hand experience
of the tragedy of war.
In 1917 Hoover returned to Unit
ed States as a world-renowned hu
manitarian. He served President
Woodrow Wilson as head of the U.S.
Food Administration, dealing with
domestic economic issues. In the
meantime, he was also director-gen
eral of the American Relief Admin
istration. providing aid for millions
starving in Europe.
I loover later became Secretary of
Commerce under Warren I latding's
administration.
" I le did a great job. 1 le turned the
Department of Commerce into one
of the prominent and dynamic de
partments." Palm said. "Because of
his complete success. Hoover kept
his job when [Calvin] Coolidge be
came the president."
In 192K Hoover ran for president
of the United States as the Republi
can nominee and won the election by
a landslide. Despite his concern
about economic trends, the Great
Depression struck one year later, ac
cording to Nash's book.
I lis rigidity and aloofness during
the economic meltdown made him
appear distant and insensitive to the
public, which blamed him for policy
mistakes. Consequently, in the 1932
presidential election, he lost by a
large margin to the Democratic can

didate, Franklin D. Roosevelt.
After the defeat, I loover traveled
around the nation and gave speeches
defending his character. He ;ilso
wrote several books, including a per
sonal memoir. He returned to his
original source of fame when Presi
dent Harry Truman invited him to
head up the effort to feed the world's
starving population after World War
11.
He was also active in various
other charities.
Eventually, Nash wrote, he won
back the respect of the American
people and repaired the image tar
nished by a turbulent time in history.
I jfelong alumnus, benefactor
Hoover began making donations
to his alma mater in 1897 when lie
was still .living in Australia. From
there, he put up a one-man scholar
ship fund, which came from a large
chunk of his salary. The fund helped
his relatives and some intimate
friends complete their education at
Stanford.
In the early 1900s I loover became
a member of Stanford's Board of
Trustees. I le helped reform alco
holism among students, raised the
faculty salary and turned a money
losing institution into a solvent body
as he had for the ASSIJ when he
served as its treasurer 20 years be
fore.
I le funded numerous projects, in
cluding the earthquake investigation
of the geology department after the
1906 San Francisco tremor. He also
contributed generously to the Uni
versity's growing library with rare
books he had acquired on his trips
overseas, according to "Herbert
Hoover and Stanford I University."
His efforts in making Stanford
one of nation's leading institutions
might be best illustrated by the
founding of the Hoover War li
brary. later known as the I loover In
stitution on War. Revolution and
Peace.
1 lis WW I experience showed him
human atrocities on a appalling
scale. Inspired by Andrew White, the
first president of Cornell University.

Hoover resolved to collect "suitable
library material on the war for Stan
ford University." He also promised
to provide financial support.
Hoover's objective was to build a
collection on the Great War, and he
thought it was ideal to keep the col
lection at Stanford. Financed by
Hoover's generous funding, histori
ans scoured the European continent
for war documents.
The Hoover war collection ex
panded rapidly during that time.
"By 1921, there were about
SO.(MH) items in the collection." Palm
said. Several years later, the number
of items numbered more than one
million, and physical space became a
problem.
F inally, in 1938. a building plan
for the I loover War Library materi
alized. Again, the building was made
possible by the Hoover Foundation.
I loover Tower was completed in
1941 the 50th anniversary of Stan
ford.
Joined by later buildings, the
Hoover War Library was renamed
the I loover Institution on War. Rev
olution and Peace in 1957.
In a statement submitted to the
Board of Trustees in 1959. Hoover
said. " The overall mission of the In
stitution is. from its records, to recall
the voice of experience against the
making of war. and by the study of
these records and their publication,
to recall man's endeavors to make
and preserve peace and to sustain for
America the safeguards of the
American way of life."
"lie had always been a trustee,
even when lie was the president of
the United States." said Kimball.
"I le appointed [ Ray Lyman] Wilbur
(a former classmate) as the nation's
Secretary of the Interior. They cared
about the University."
Wilbur was Hoover's "buddy"
from undergraduate years and later
became president of Stanford.
"|Hoover and Wilbur] were peo
ple who had a long history with the
I 'niversitv. people who were shaped
by the University and who conse
quently had a vision for it. They are
firmly rooted within the I 'niversitv."
said Kimball.

and I loover Tower, which is so con

of the campus the day of its comple

One of Stanford's first graduates.
Hoover carried his unique college
experience throughout his life and
eventually achieved international
fame and tremendous wealth. He
was. among many things, a mining
engineer, an international entrepre

Hoover started making personal
donations to the University almost


immediately after graduation. He
was a member of the Board of
Trustees for 50 years until his death
in 1%4. All of the administrative
policies made during that tumul

for better or for worse.
"Hoover had always personified
the Stanford Spirit," said Charles
Palm, deputy director of the Hoover
Institution. "I le was Mr. Stanford."
Get into the game
Born in a small village in lowa on
Aug. 10, 1874, Herbert Clark
Hoover was the second child of a
blacksmith father, who was also a
Quaker minister, and an evangelist
mother. Both Ins parents died before
he was 10. so in 1885. he moved with
his uncle's family to ()regon. Besides
working as an office assistant for a
small company, he attended night
classes in Salem.
According to a book by I larvard
historian George Nash, "Herbert
Hoover and Stanford University, in
1891 Hoover learned that a "new.
ambitious, modern university devot
ed to the ethic of usefulness" had
been founded by Sen. I.eland Stan
ford in C 'alilornia in memory of Stan
ford's only son. Lager to make deci
sions for his own life. Hoover ig
nored the arrangements made by rel
atives and took the Stanford en
trance exam in Portland. Although
not doing well in every subject, he
impressed the interviewer. Prof.
Joseph Swain, with his "strength of
will" and "method of work."
Lour months later, at the age of
17, he found himself in the first class
of Stanford University. And, togeth
er with a friend from ()regon, he was
literally the first to occupy a room in
the men's dormitory, Lncina 11 a 11.
"It was a smaller community back
then, around 500 students," said
Margaret Kimball. University
archivist for Stanford Libraries, re
telling to Stanford's first class. "It
was a group of young men and

some young women — starting at a
young university."
At Stanford. I loover worked for
Dr. John Branner of the geology de
partment and was elected treasurer
of the \ss l
Four years of college not only
nurtured Hoover's expertise,
preparing him for his future career,
but also trained him in public service,
which later became a significant part
of his life.
On May 29, 1895, Hoover re
ceived his bachelor's degree in geol
ogy. I le was one of the first graduates
the University produced, a member
of the group affectionately called the
Pioneer Class. <
At Commencement, then-Uni
versity President David Starr Jordan
addressed the assembled Pioneers.
"(iet into the game, somehow, some
v\ here. C an y your thoughts over into
action. Do your part, and the greatest
surprise of your life will come the day
when you find out how great that
part may be."
These words no doubt had an en
duringeffect on theyounggraduates.
" •( iet into the game,' "said Palm,
speaking ol I loover. " These are the
words that make this man."
I hese words inculcated in
I loover the will of participation and
a passion for adventure. Armed with
the expertise and resourcefulness ac
quired in class, this pioneer would al
ways bear a strong consciousness of
being a part of the game.
The University's first success story
After graduation, I loover worked
in Australia as a technical consultant
for a London-based mining compa
ny. In 1899, he married his college
sweetheart, Lou llenry. Class of
1898, who he met as a senior in t he ge
ology department when she was a
freshman. The day after their wed
ding, they sailed from San Francisco
to ( Tiina, where I loover worked as a
chief engineer for two years.
From then on, I loover was on his
own as an international freelance
mining engineer and financier.
Based in London and working
around the world, he very quickly

rose to fame and success. By the sum
mer of 1914 he had already become
the director of IS mining and finan
cial companies, with assets of $55
million and interests on every conti
nent.
"Hoover was very hard working,"
Palm said. "He also knew how to
profit from what he was doing. They
prospected and then found ores
around the world and quickly be
came rich and famous."
Hoover was in England when
World War I broke out in 1914. He
helped those Americans who were
trapped in Europe find food and
shelter as well as tickets to sail back
to the United States. When Belgium
fell to German invasion. Hoover cre
ated the Commission for Relief in
Belgium to feed the civilian popula
tion. The CRB made him a hero and
also gave him first-hand experience
of the tragedy of war.
In 1917 Hoover returned to Unit
ed States as a world-renowned hu
manitarian. He served President
Woodrow Wilson as head of the U.S.
Food Administration, dealing with
domestic economic issues. In the
meantime, he was also director-gen
eral of the American Relief Admin
istration. providing aid for millions
starving in Europe.
I loover later became Secretary of
Commerce under Warren I latding's
administration.
" I le did a great job. 1 le turned the
Department of Commerce into one
of the prominent and dynamic de
partments." Palm said. "Because of
his complete success. Hoover kept
his job when [Calvin] Coolidge be
came the president."
In 192K Hoover ran for president
of the United States as the Republi
can nominee and won the election by
a landslide. Despite his concern
about economic trends, the Great
Depression struck one year later, ac
cording to Nash's book.
I lis rigidity and aloofness during
the economic meltdown made him
appear distant and insensitive to the
public, which blamed him for policy
mistakes. Consequently, in the 1932
presidential election, he lost by a
large margin to the Democratic can

didate, Franklin D. Roosevelt.
After the defeat, I loover traveled
around the nation and gave speeches
defending his character. He ;ilso
wrote several books, including a per
sonal memoir. He returned to his

of his life.
On May 29, 1895, Hoover re
ceived his bachelor's degree in geol
ogy. I le was one of the first graduates
the University produced, a member
of the group affectionately called the
Pioneer Class. <
At Commencement, then-Uni
versity President David Starr Jordan
addressed the assembled Pioneers.
"(iet into the game, somehow, some
v\ here. C an y your thoughts over into
action. Do your part, and the greatest
surprise of your life will come the day
when you find out how great that
part may be."
These words no doubt had an en
duringeffect on theyounggraduates.
" •( iet into the game,' "said Palm,
speaking ol I loover. " These are the
words that make this man."
I hese words inculcated in
I loover the will of participation and
a passion for adventure. Armed with
the expertise and resourcefulness ac
quired in class, this pioneer would al
ways bear a strong consciousness of
being a part of the game.
The University's first success story
After graduation, I loover worked
in Australia as a technical consultant
for a London-based mining compa
ny. In 1899, he married his college
sweetheart, Lou llenry. Class of
1898, who he met as a senior in t he ge
ology department when she was a
freshman. The day after their wed
ding, they sailed from San Francisco
to ( Tiina, where I loover worked as a
chief engineer for two years.
From then on, I loover was on his
own as an international freelance
mining engineer and financier.
Based in London and working
around the world, he very quickly

rose to fame and success. By the sum
mer of 1914 he had already become
the director of IS mining and finan
cial companies, with assets of $55
million and interests on every conti
nent.
"Hoover was very hard working,"
Palm said. "He also knew how to
profit from what he was doing. They
prospected and then found ores
around the world and quickly be
came rich and famous."
Hoover was in England when
World War I broke out in 1914. He
helped those Americans who were
trapped in Europe find food and
shelter as well as tickets to sail back
to the United States. When Belgium
fell to German invasion. Hoover cre
ated the Commission for Relief in
Belgium to feed the civilian popula
tion. The CRB made him a hero and
also gave him first-hand experience
of the tragedy of war.
In 1917 Hoover returned to Unit
ed States as a world-renowned hu
manitarian. He served President
Woodrow Wilson as head of the U.S.
Food Administration, dealing with
domestic economic issues. In the
meantime, he was also director-gen
eral of the American Relief Admin
istration. providing aid for millions
starving in Europe.
I loover later became Secretary of
Commerce under Warren I latding's
administration.
" I le did a great job. 1 le turned the
Department of Commerce into one
of the prominent and dynamic de
partments." Palm said. "Because of
his complete success. Hoover kept
his job when [Calvin] Coolidge be
came the president."
In 192K Hoover ran for president
of the United States as the Republi
can nominee and won the election by
a landslide. Despite his concern
about economic trends, the Great
Depression struck one year later, ac
cording to Nash's book.
I lis rigidity and aloofness during
the economic meltdown made him
appear distant and insensitive to the
public, which blamed him for policy
mistakes. Consequently, in the 1932
presidential election, he lost by a
large margin to the Democratic can

didate, Franklin D. Roosevelt.
After the defeat, I loover traveled
around the nation and gave speeches
defending his character. He ;ilso
wrote several books, including a per
sonal memoir. He returned to his
original source of fame when Presi
dent Harry Truman invited him to
head up the effort to feed the world's
starving population after World War
11.
He was also active in various
other charities.
Eventually, Nash wrote, he won
back the respect of the American
people and repaired the image tar
nished by a turbulent time in history.
I jfelong alumnus, benefactor
Hoover began making donations
to his alma mater in 1897 when lie
was still .living in Australia. From
there, he put up a one-man scholar
ship fund, which came from a large
chunk of his salary. The fund helped
his relatives and some intimate
friends complete their education at
Stanford.
In the early 1900s I loover became
a member of Stanford's Board of
Trustees. I le helped reform alco
holism among students, raised the
faculty salary and turned a money
losing institution into a solvent body
as he had for the ASSIJ when he
served as its treasurer 20 years be
fore.
I le funded numerous projects, in
cluding the earthquake investigation
of the geology department after the
1906 San Francisco tremor. He also
contributed generously to the Uni
versity's growing library with rare
books he had acquired on his trips
overseas, according to "Herbert
Hoover and Stanford I University."
His efforts in making Stanford
one of nation's leading institutions
might be best illustrated by the
founding of the Hoover War li
brary. later known as the I loover In
stitution on War. Revolution and
Peace.
1 lis WW I experience showed him
human atrocities on a appalling
scale. Inspired by Andrew White, the
first president of Cornell University.

Hoover resolved to collect "suitable
library material on the war for Stan
ford University." He also promised
to provide financial support.
Hoover's objective was to build a
collection on the Great War, and he
thought it was ideal to keep the col
lection at Stanford. Financed by
Hoover's generous funding, histori
ans scoured the European continent
for war documents.
The Hoover war collection ex
panded rapidly during that time.
"By 1921, there were about
SO.(MH) items in the collection." Palm
said. Several years later, the number
of items numbered more than one
million, and physical space became a
problem.
F inally, in 1938. a building plan
for the I loover War Library materi
alized. Again, the building was made
possible by the Hoover Foundation.
I loover Tower was completed in
1941 the 50th anniversary of Stan
ford.
Joined by later buildings, the
Hoover War Library was renamed
the I loover Institution on War. Rev
olution and Peace in 1957.
In a statement submitted to the
Board of Trustees in 1959. Hoover
said. " The overall mission of the In
stitution is. from its records, to recall
the voice of experience against the
making of war. and by the study of
these records and their publication,
to recall man's endeavors to make
and preserve peace and to sustain for
America the safeguards of the
American way of life."
"lie had always been a trustee,
even when lie was the president of
the United States." said Kimball.
"I le appointed [ Ray Lyman] Wilbur
(a former classmate) as the nation's
Secretary of the Interior. They cared
about the University."
Wilbur was Hoover's "buddy"
from undergraduate years and later
became president of Stanford.
"|Hoover and Wilbur] were peo
ple who had a long history with the
I 'niversitv. people who were shaped
by the University and who conse
quently had a vision for it. They are
firmly rooted within the I 'niversitv."
said Kimball.
