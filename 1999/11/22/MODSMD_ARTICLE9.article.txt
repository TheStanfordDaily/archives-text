## 
### Megan Knize Contributing writer 
It was a dancer's dream Saturday
evening at Roble Gym as alumni of
the Dance Department and the
Friends of Stanford Dance show
cased more than 40dancers in a truly
eclectic performance set called
"Stanford, Dancing: Bringin' it
Home."
This was the seventh-annual ben
efit for the Mary Fdith Clifford
Foundation, which provides a grant
for a Stanford alumnus to choreo
graph a performance.
A crowd of nearly 200 people
watched the performance, which
featured dances ranging from
bizarre to outright funny. The show
began as the Academy of Danse
Libre presented four Victorian-style
dances, including a Polonaise and
"Champagne Gallop."
The vintage dances were con
trasted with an improvisational
dance with two men doing rolls and
handstands in an attempt to eat a bar
of chocolate.
The third performance was titled
"Andante" and was choreographed
by Lily Wang, this year's Mary Edith
Clifford Foundation Award Winner.
Wang was hand-picked last
spring by the co-directors of the per
formance as the choreographer for
this year's show. Wang graduated
with a master's degree from Stanford
in dance education in 1992 and now
works full-time as an analyst at
I lewlett-Packard.
"I am deeply indebted to all the
performers for their energy and in

spiration," Wang said before the per
formance.
Other performances included
rhythmic gymnast Laura Scrghiou;
"Strange World," a series of three
humorous dances and accompany
ing dialogues set in the 19505; and a
contemporary dance to party la
vorite "Marnbo No. 5."
"We are here to celebrate the

huge diversity of dancing that Sum
ford offers." said event co-organizer
Diane Frank, a Drama Department
lecturer.
Freshman Caroline Clabaugh
said she was impressed by the
dances.
"1 liked the variety of dances that
were presented," she said.
Mary Fdith Clifford was not a

dancer herself. When she was 70. she
discovered dance at Stanford and
underwrote the first two Mary Edith
( lifford dance performances.
After her death. Stanford dance
alumni decided to continue what she
started. Wang, the winner of the
award, was given $500 to choreo
graph Saturday's dance perfor
mance.
