In the nineteenth century,
American tourists, scholars,
evangelists, writers, and
artists flocked to Palestine as
part of a "Holy Land mania."
Many saw America as a New
Israel, a modern nation
chosen to do God's work on
Earth, and produced a rich
variety of inspirational art and
literature about their travels
in the original promised land,
which was then part of
Ottoman-controlled Palestine.
Combining keen literary and
historical insights and careful
attention to the context of
other American writings about
Palestine, this book throws
new light on the construction
of American identity in the
nineteenth century.
Hilton Obenzinger is a critic,
novelist, and poet. Winner of
the American Book Award, his
previous works include New
York on Fire and Cannibal
Eliot and the Lost Histories
of San Francisco. He teaches
American literature and
writing at Stanford University.
