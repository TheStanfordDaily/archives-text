### Melissa Lambert 
Yesterday at 8:25 a.m.. when
freshman Alana Aldag returned to
her Cedro single after taking a show
er. she found a well-dressed white
male in his mid-s()s going through her
suitcase. I le was about 6 feel tall and
had dark gray thinning hair and a
short heard.
Her door, which she had left
closed but not locked, was now wide
open. Unsure of the man's emotional
stability and "not wanting to triuger

anything." Aldag said, "Excuse me
sir. can I help you?"
Me jumped and turned around,
holding her nightgown in his hand.
Me asked, "Is this Susan's room?"
and she answered "No." According
to Aldag. there is no one named
Susan in Cedro.
The intruder threw down the
nightgown and left the room. After
walking partway down the hall, he
turned around and started coming
back toward Aldag's room. She shut
her door and 15 minutes later dialed

-911. Before the police could arrive,
the intruder was seen leaving the
building holding a pile of clothes.
1 le was first spotted in the second
floor restroom of the Wilbur dorm at
about 4 a.m. yesterday.
"Someone might have let him into
the dorm. " said Wilbur Residence
Dean Andy 1 lernandez, "but I sus
pect one of the dorm's outside doors
was left propped open overnight."
The intruder was wearing khakis
and a polo shirt and his beard was
well groomed. Most students who

saw him assumed that he was anoth
er student's father.
He was seen taking a shower in the
men's bathroom on the third floor at
6:30. Freshman Raymond Zimmer
said he saw him "washing his hands
and going in and out" of the coed first
tloor restroom around N:()5 a.m.
To Zimmer, the man looked "re
ally out of place" â€” he said the in
truder "didn't say anything but acted
like he lived here." Although Zim
mersaid he thought the man's behav
ior was strange, he "let it go."
Some Cedro residents also said
they saw the intruder walking around
topless and others said they saw him
carrying a pile of clothes. Aldag's sin
gle is the only room he is known to
have entered.

On her way to the shower. Aldag
had passed the intruder in the lull It
wasn't until she got to the bathroom
that other girls there told her an in
truder had been walking around the
dorm all morning.
Although "this is an unusual
case." said Stanford Police I t. Del
Bandy. "Almost every single one ol
our dorm burglaries and there
have been dozens ol them this year
are because of unlocked doors,"
