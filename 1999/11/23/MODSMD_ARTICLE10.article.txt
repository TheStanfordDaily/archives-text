### My Scott Dorfman Contributing writer 
The fields of public service and
scholarship will converge next quar
ter in a new course offered by the Po
litical Science department entitled
Political Science I5 I >R: Issues in Pub
lic Service.
The cliiss aims to "introduce stu
dents to the history of public serv ice
in the United States and moral and
ethical dilemmas people encounter
when doing service." according to
Asst. Prof. Rob Reich, who will teach
the class.
Reich says thai the main purpose
of the class will be to fuse the areas ol
scholarship and public service into a
single focus.
" There was a personal and an in
structional impetus for this class,"
said Reich. "I have always been inter
csted in the conflict between the
academy and real life. I he goal ol the
class is to find a way to bridge the gap
between the academy and service

work."
I he five-unit course will receive
assistance from the I laas ( enter For
Public Service.
I caching assistants for the class.
I laas Service !-earning Faculty Co
ordinator Heather Rann're/ and
Haas Student Development Pro
gram Advisor ( athy Avila. will help
with the class. In addition, informa
tion ab<nit specific service opportuni
ties will be made available to students
tluough I laas.
"Since the idea for the course
stai ted. our role lias been to aid in the
planning and development of the
course," said Ramirez. "Both
Nadinne Cruz (Interim Director of
the I laas ( enter) and [AvilaJ. as well
as myself, have worked to develop a
course that gives students a real
world perspective on public service."
I he original idea for the course
was formulated last year at the Stan
ford Faculty Service Learning Insti
lute. Discussions between professors
Al ( amarillo. I uis Fraya and Debra

Sat/ laid out the original framework
for the class, and ( amarillo took the
lead in developing a planning com
mittee of professors and I laas stall
members to develop the course.
Reich later signed on to teach.
I he class will focus on two case
studies to give students a perspective
on issues of public service.
The first case study will be an ex
amination of the Teach for America
program, an organization that places
recent college graduates into teach
ing jobs at underdeveloped schools
throughout America.
"By learning about the experi
ences of Wendy Kopp (the founder
of IT A) in starting Teach for Ameri
ca, Stanford students can gain an in
sight into some of the real world
problems of public service," said
Reich.
The second case study will be a
look at the recent experiences of var
ious Stanford students in public ser
vice.
"Interviews were done with ten

Stanford students doing service
now," said Reich. "We found a wide
variety of motivations and opinions
on service. By looking at these case
studies, we can tease out the question
of service and find out if there can
only be just one definition of service,
or if such a characterization is inade
quate."
The class will also look at some of
the ethical dilemmas that students
encounter when doing service.
"In a specific sense, we will look at
questions such as, 'What happens if
one is subjected to sexual harassment
while performing public service?'"
said Reich. "Of course, all sorts of is
sues of cultural diversity also arise
with service."
Political Science 15 l )R will be
open to freshmen and sophomores
who are interested in "preparing for
intensive community-based research,
field study, internships and service
learning courses required by their
majors," said Suzanne Abel, director
of External Relations at Haas.
