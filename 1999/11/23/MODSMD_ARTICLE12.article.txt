# 'Stanford After Midnight' starts soon
## Plan would keep campus open later 
### Alice Brown Editorial staff 
It's no secret that many Stanford
students are awake in the wee hours
of the morning. Beginning winter
quarter, though, they'll have an
added incentive to stay up.
The ASSU, in conjunction with
the Dean of Students' office, recent
ly announced "Stanford After Mid
night," a new plan to extend the
hours that certain campus facilities
are open.
"The concept behind Stanford
After Midnight is simple — find
those places that students use most
on campus to study, eat and hang
out, and keep them open later at
night, in all possible cases until 2 a.m.,
seven nights a week." said ASSU
President Mike Levin, a junior.
According to a statement put out
by the ASSU, last year the Dean of
Students' office released a study
showing that students, on average,
go to sleep at 2:31 a.m. "Currently,
most University facilities close some
where between 10 p.m. and mid
night. if not before then, and that just

doesn't serve students very well,"
said ASSIJ Vice President John
Mills, a genetics doctoral student.
Mills also noted that within the
next several years there will he hun
dreds of new graduate students living
on campus and that the freshman
class will not have cars, increasing the
demand for on-campus student facil
ities.
Stanford After Midnight has
been in the works for more than
three months, and in January a com
plete list of the facilities extending
their hours will be announced.
" Right now, we have several done
deals and partnerships made," said
Levin. "We can't wait to make a big
splash when students return winter
quarter."
Levin said that more than half of
the facilities that are on the list ol po
tential participants in the After Mid
night program are confirmed. "In
fairness to all of the departments and
vendors we have already come U>
agreement with — as well as thosi>
that we're trying to get to join the ini^
tiative we arc goinu to make on
bitt announcement of participants i

laiutar\ rather than a partial an
nouncement this quarter." says the
/XSSI J's statement.
! he Alter Midnight program will
officially beginning with a Cirand
()penint> celebration on Jan. 13.

ll'students use the facilities during
their later hours, the facilities will re
main open. "I hope students take ad
vantage of this opportunity during
the winter quarter so that it may con
tinue in the future," said Dean of Stu

dents Marc Wais.
Both Levin and Mills are excited
that this project has finally material
ized into tangible benefits. Said
Levin. "Students are up after mid
night. Now. Stanford will be too."
