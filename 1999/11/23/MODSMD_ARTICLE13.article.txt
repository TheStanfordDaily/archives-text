## Churches across Holy Land close in protest 
### 
NAZARETH. Israel (AP) —
The gates of churches across the
Holy Land swung shut in protest
Monday as church leaders made a
final attempt to block the building
of a mosque in the heart of
Nazareth, the town of Jesus' boy
hood.
I'he two-day, Vatican-backed
closure highlights the increasingly
volatile relations between Chris
tians and Muslims as well as
Israel's ambiguous — some claim
politically tainted — role as media
tor.
The dispute has also spilled over
into Mideast peace talks, with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
backing the Christians in Nazareth
in hopes they will support him
when he negotiates the future of
Jerusalem with the Israelis.
Saudi Arabia, the guardian of
Islam's holiest shrines, supported
Arafat's efforts, offering to pay for
a new mosque at an alternate spot
in Nazareth, away from the Basili
ca of the Annunciation. u> avoid
friction.
The church closures, just weeks
before the last Christmas of the
millennium, left many pilgrims dis
appointed. Some endorsed the
protest, while others said Chris
tians should set examples of toler
ance and not block construction of

the mosque.
"Nazareth should be a city for
everyone." said Jozeph Wietsiers.
54. a Roman Catholic who had
walked more than 2.400 miles since
May on a pilgrimage from his
hometown in Oss, I lolland. only to
find the Basilica closed.
But the highest Roman Catholic
authority in the Holy Land. Latin
Patriarch Michel Sabbah, said the
Christians, a tiny minority of about
100.000, had to take a stand.
"We closed the churches so the
world can hear, and the world did."
Sabbah told a news conference in
Jerusalem.
The dispute is uncharacteristic
of Israel's Christians, who usually
keep a low profile to avoid friction
with Muslims.
Sabbah hinted that Pope John
Paul li s visit to Israel and the
Palestinian areas, set for March,
could still be called off if the
Nazareth dispute was not resolved.
The argument began two years
ago. when the city's Christian
mayor. Ramez Jeraisi. announced
plans to build a tourist plaza on a
half-acre plot outside the Basilica
to make the congested, noisy
downtown more appealing to mil
lennium \ isitors.
The city's Islamic movement
said some of the land was Muslim

owned and set up a protest tent on
the lot.
In a compromise brokered by
the Israeli government, the
mosque is to be built on one-third
of the land, the plaza on the
remainder.
Jeraisi reluctantly accepted the
deal, saying he wanted to avoid
more strife, but was overruled by
Roman Catholic. Armenian and
Greek Orthodox patriarchs who
said a mosque near the church was
unacceptable.
On Monday, a Vatican
spokesman, the Rev. Ciro
Benedettini, said the Holy See
"clearly supports" the church clo
sures, but stressed the decision was
made by the various local authori
ties in charge of the churches.
Churches closed across the I loly
Land, including in Jerusalem,
Bethlehem and the Galilee. Some
neighborhood churches stayed
open, including a Greek Orthodox
church in Nazareth and the
Ethiopian Orthodox-controlled
section of Jerusalem's Church of
the Holy Sepulcher.
Israel has denied allegations b\
church leaders that it favored the
Muslims because they have more
political clout. I'he vast majority of
Israel's 1 million Arabs are Muslim.
On Mondav, Muslims and Chris

tians in Nazareth, who have long
lived in harmony, said the dispute
has left them suspicious of one
another. Christians make up only
about 30 percent of the city's 60.000
residents but until recently were
dominant in politics and business.
Christian Nassim Ma//av i. who
owns a jewelry store next to the
Basilica, said he felt the Muslims
were being rewarded for using
threats and force.
A few yards down the road from
his store, dozens of Muslims knelt
in prayer on colorful carpets mark
ing the spot where the mosque is to
be built. In the area surrounding
them, bulldozers leveled ground
for the plaza, taking a break only
for the duration of the prayer.
Worshipper Bilal Mitwali. 36.
said he had expected his Christian
friends to support his quest for a
mosque. None did. "That proves
that we are not really brothers," he
said.
The cornerstone lor the mosque
was to be laid Tuesday, despite a
last-minute appeal by the top Mus
lim cleric in Jerusalem. Ikrenia
Sabri. to postpone the ceremony.
Sabri was apparently acting at the
behest of Arafat, who is eager not
to hurl his relationship with Chris
tian leaders whose support he
needs when he negotiates the

future of Jerusalem with the
Israelis.
I he Palestinians hope to estab
lish their capital in east Jerusalem,
home to major Christian shrines.
The Israeli government, fearing
a challenge to its sovereignty, has
told Arafat to stay out of the dis
pute.
However. Sabbah, the Latin
Patriarch, indirectlv confirmed that

church leaders had pressured
Arafat to intercede with the Islam
ic moveme.i
"The issue of whether there is a
relationship between Nazareth and
Jerusalem, 1 say there is one," Sab
bah said.
The patriarch said Arafat
explained to the Islamic Movement
that "if you win in Nazareth, we
lose in Jerusalem."
