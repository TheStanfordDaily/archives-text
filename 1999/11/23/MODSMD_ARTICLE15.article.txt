His skates have been at the Hall
since he retired April IS. The shrine

conceivable piece of Gretzky mem

Wayne has turned out to be such a
great individual." his father. Wal

hockey achievements are one
thing, but he's also a very fine per

Despite Gretzky's best efforts,
the focus of the morning ceremony
never left the player known for
skating with the right side of his
jersey tucked in. a habit from his
childhood when his special ability
put him in oversized uniforms
against older kids.
Thin and shifty with an
unmatched ability to anticipate,
Gretzky scored more goals (8 l ) 4)

anyone before him. His assists
alone exceed the 1.850 total points
of the No. 2 career scorer. Howe,
who played past age 50.
