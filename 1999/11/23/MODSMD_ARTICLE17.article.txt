The new Stanford After
Midnight program will
help student life

During Winter quarter, the
ASSU and the Office of
the Dean of Students
will launch the Stanford After
Midnight program, an effort to
keep facilities commonly used by
students open until as late as 2:00
a.m., seven days a week. Accord
ing to the ASSU, this program
will focus on locations where stu
dents "study, eat and hang out,"
and it is intended to "tangibly
improve Stanford student life."
We applaud the coordinators
of Stanford After Midnight for
doing something very positive for
the students. After some ques
tionably restrictive motions taken
by the University (such as the
policy to keep incoming freshmen
from having cars), a measure
which promotes an increased
social atmosphere on campus is
most welcome.
(liven the students' late-night
waking habits, it is good that the
Office of the Dean of Students
has recognized the demand for
certain businesses and resources
during the post-midnight hours.
The extra hours of service will be
critical to freshmen beginning
next year. The Stanford After
Midnight might also bring about
new late-night pastimes and
increased business to campus
stores and restaurants.
The organizers of Stanford
Alter Midnight have not finalized

their list of facilities for the pilot
program, but it is plain to see
which places would benefit stu
dents the most.
First, we should keep the
Tresidder food venues, particular
ly those that provide caffeine,
open past midnight. Tresidder
Express, the Corner Pocket and
Polio Rey immediately come to
mind. The Coffee House has tra
ditionally stayed open past mid
night; perhaps its hours could be
extended further.
Tresidder facilities such as the
Pulse and Tresidder Fitness could
also turn out to be useful to stu
dents after midnight. The Stan
lord Alter Midnight coordinators
should consider opening these
places late on a trial basis.
Finally, academic resources,
including libraries and computer
clusters, should definitely extend
their hours. Certain tracks of
study have already made Sweet
Hall into a 24-hour facility; a 24-
hour Green Library may not be
such a bad idea.
As the hours for Tresidder
Union, White Plaza and the
libraries are extended, there must
be a secondary effort to increase
campus transportation and safety.
The Marguerite shuttle service
will need extended hours and
routes. Lighting between dorms
and the student centers may need
to be brighter.
The Stanford After Midnight
program will make many stu
dents happy. It is a big step
toward increasing the vibrancy of
University life.
