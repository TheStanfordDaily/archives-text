Stanford students unfairly
punished
It seems that we Stanford students have
committed a grave offense, but none of us
know what it is. For those readers of The
Daily who were not at Big Game, during the
third quarter, some 30 police officers
dressed in full riot gear stepped out onto the
track and took up position in front of the
Stanford and Berkeley student sections.
Riot police carry an arsenal of weapons
which can cause serious injury. On top of
the visible night sticks and batons, they also
carry tear gas and mace. The message was
clear: despite the fact that Stanford students
are a peaceful group, the administration was
prepared to inflict bodily harm on us
(including those innocent people in front
who might be pushed down onto the police
by those behind them).
But this incident was only the last of a
series of indignities which we endured as
Big C iame approached. I could go on at
length, but I wish to focus on the censoring
of the Band. The Band's halftimc show at
Big Game has always been insulting to
Berkeley. That is why the Band exists and is
what makes Stanford's side of the rivalry so
unique. And yet on Saturday, they were not
allowed to even mention the word "Cal."
One might be inclined to think that the
administration has some reason to take such
a stance. Do Stanford students deserve such
punishment for past deeds? Surely not!
In the four Big Games I have seen, Stan
ford fans have never misbehaved or caused
any serious damage. It was Berkeley who
assaulted the Tree three vears ago. It was

Berkeley who ripped clown goal posts two
years ago. It was Berkeley who threw hot
ties and other projeetiles at celebrating
Stanford fans on the field last year. It was
Berkeley who threw bottles at the riot
police this year. Yet Stanford has been pun
ished.
Perhaps the administration feels that it is
being "lair" by affording us the same treat
ment by the riot police as Cal and censoring
the band, but there is nothing more unfair
than punishing a group of people for some
thing that they did not do.
If Berkeley students cannot control
themselves, then the responsibility falls to
the administration to control them, not us.
We demonstrated that we do not need riot
police to stop us; a fence will do. Give us our
traditions back, and let the riot police con
trol those who need controlling.

Alternative security measures
should have been sought
On Saturday afternoon, a very large
number of people from the Stanford com
munity witnessed our football team's
tremendous win over C'al, which secured us
a berth in the Rose Bowl. Unfortunately,
this same group experienced a militant
takeover of the stadium and the surround
ing area.
In the middle of the third quarter, what
seemed like a hundred guards, armed with
helmets, clubs and hand grenades, marched
onto the track in Stanford Stadium. Thev

were greeted with boos and jeers from the
crowd, and their presence immediately
changed the character of this year's Big
Game.
The team mascots were "escorted" out
of the stadium well before the end of the
game, and the yell leaders and Dollies were
displaced by the guards and eventually dis
possessed of their responsibilities.
Even more armed guards soon descend
ed down the stadium steps to form another
"wall," this time inside the fences, leaving
spectators apprehensive and uncomfort
able.
Being ordered to stay in place, threat
ened with arrest and intimidated by heavily
armed guards is quite scary. Ours is not a
society ruled by a military dictatorship, nor
should it be: we are not used to being treat
ed as members of a crazy and dangerous
mob.
The organizers of this year's Big Game
may have succeeded in keeping fans off of
the field after the game, but their true suc
cess was in expressing severe distrust of and
disrespect for the crowd of students and
alumni who came to enjoy the game, in a
belligerent and obnoxious display of power.
Understandably, the University was try
ing to prevent injury and damage in the
aftermath of Big Game. However, there are
ways to do this in a less threatening manner.
If the University doesn't want people to
get trampled as the crowd storms the field,
why doesn't it remove the fences so that we
can all freely enter the field at the end of the
game? If the University doesn't want angry
crowds destroying the goal posts, then why
doesn't it guard the goal posts, as Cal did at

last year's Big Game?
Watching and being a part of the swarm
of fans on the court in Maples Pavilion after
our men's basketball team clinched the Pac
-10 championship last year let us all feel a
part of their glorious achievement. We were
able to share this achievement with our
team. The celebration was spontaneous, it
was sincere and it was glorious. This is the
kind of experience that every single Stan
ford fan in the stands missed out on this past
Saturday.
As spectators in what University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper called tine of the most
prestigious sporting events in the country,
we deserve to be treated with decency and
respect, not to be enclosed and intimidated
by heavily armed riot police. We should not
be vilified or represented as automatons of
a mob mentality.
This past Saturday, the Stanford football
team clinched sole possession of the Pac-1()
championship and a spot in the Rose Bowl.
It is unfortunate that for many the lasting
image of the day will not be a play that
occurred on the field or some particularly
heartening cheer from the stands. Instead
we will remember most clearly the line of
riot police with clubs held out at their sides,
marching onto our field and imposing their
militant version of order.

Display of force insulting to
students

I he University's decision to station
dozens ot police in riot gear at Big Game, to
parade them through the aisles of the stu
dent sections of both schools, to march them
around the track in step and to allow them to
brandish their batons to the crowd raises an
interesting question: Was it worthwhile?
Were the benefits that Stanford gained
for such an unabashed display of force of
such paramount importance that a historic
victory for the football team and a poten
tially joyous moment for the University

needed to be sullied?
Is the sanctity of the football field so
great that it had to be preserved at the cost
of a palpable fear among students? Is the
risk of lawsuits so high that the University
feels inclined to treat its own student body
as a rock-hurling, gate-charging, panic
inducing mob? Is an ideal of subdued
behavior meaningful if it is earned through
naked and obvious terror?
Is it not also worth contemplating what
might have happened? What if students
had rushed onto the field? Would the obvi
ously frightened deputies have clubbed stu
dents into submission? Would those officers

who were armed have fired into the air?
Would the Hashing cameras that promised
to capture "trespassing" students have also
gushed tear gas? Would a few intoxicated
students have their careers at Stanford
ended, their aspirations restrained and their
lives endangered for a little childish behav
ior at a football game?
Even in the more likely case that the
massive law enforcement presence was
intended merely for show, that the troops
would have yielded il the gates were pressed
open, is it not worth asking what this
demonstration of force means to students
and to Stanford?

These questions seem obvious and press
ing in the aftermath of a moment that for
me and many of my friends will be remem
bered not as a glorious athletic achievement
nor as an exhilarating vindication of school
spirit but as the moment that Stanford
stopped being a place where the University
trusts the students.
The true gravity of the University's new
policy of aggression became clear to me as 1
listened to student after student say how the
sight of armed officers clad in green sum
moned visions of Kent State â€” surely not a
proper analogy, but a profound statement
nonetheless of what the University's deci

sions this weekend meant to its students.
In my five years at Stanford. I have been
proudest of this institution as a place where
conduct is governed by honor and where
the suspicion and antagonism that defines
student-administration relations at other
universities is noticeably absent. But this
weekend proved me to be naive.
1 he University's utter lack of regard for
honor and respect has left me deeply sad
dened and incurably disillusioned. I will
never think of Stanford as 1 did before.
