Alter a year-long hiatus, the
Catholic Community at Stanford
has re-opened its ministry for gay
and lesbian Catholics.
The group plans to meet regu
larly to pray, share, study and so
cialize. They also hope to sponsor
speakers, go on field trips and oth
erwise offer encouragement and
support to one another and infor
mation to the entire community.
The organization was started
two-and-a-half years ago, primarily
among graduate students. Com
posed of only half-a-dozen stu
dents. it was nevertheless very ac
tive.
Last year, however, the group
closed after several members grad
uated.
In response to the renewed in
terest of students, the Gay and I es
bian Catholic Community re
opened its doors at an organization
al meeting Nov. 15.
After two meetings, there is
some visible "positive response."
said senior Dominie Yu. a member
of the Gay and Lesbian Catholic
Community.
"It was very short notice, but lots
of people e-mailed expressing in
terest," said Yu. "They are happy to
have such a group."
"It's a good place to meet les
bians and gays who are Catholics,"
said Father Patrick La Belle, chap
lain to Stanford's Catholic commu
nity. "Conversation is helpful in
providing solidarity."
Rev. I). Maurice Charles, associ
ate dean for Religious I ile. empha
sized similarly, "What I can say is
that at least 15-20 students have
told me that they would like to have
a group to discuss queer / religious
issues and also to have the freedom
to pray and worship together with
out having to hide or bracket their
sexuality."
There are still many issues to
solve, though.
"The group is still very new and
firm purposes have not vet been de
veloped." Laßelle said. " The group

itsell will determine its nature. We
will keep trying until something
good strikes.
Organizers hope to establish a
long-term role for the group.
"Ben Davidson [president ol
LGBCC | and I will continue to put
our heads ti igcther to address \\ hat I
see as a growing need for providing
supportive chaplaincy services to
this community which are not always
so crisis driven." ( harlcs said.
