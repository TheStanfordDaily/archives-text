## Mike Rosenbluth Mike's guide to e-signatures 
### 
Finals week and
large project dead
lines are soon
approaching. We all
know what this means:
we find new and more
creative ways to procras
tinate.

What better way to waste time than
making a brand spanking new e-mail sig
nature? Well, your Tuesday columnist has
put together a handy e-mail signature
guide just for you.
With this list of tips, you can successful
ly delay work until the last minute and also
impress that special someone (such as
Govind Dandekar's newly purchased pet
woolly mammoth clone) with a drawing or
pithy witticism placed in the last lines of
your e-mail.
The ASCII Character Pictorial Collage.
In order to pull this off. you must pick any
one of your certainly many non-academic
activities, preferably a sport such as sailing
or Ultimate Frisbee. Then form a poorly
composed non-aligned picture of it with
any array of ASCII characters, especially
the slash, underscore and asterisk. Be sure
that this picture will not appear correctly
in different e-mail programs. To really
knock your recipients off their socks, don't
limit yourself to the 26 letters and 10 num
bers on your keyboard. Impress them with
your knowledge of the Microsoft charac
ter map by throwing in the oft-underused
playing card symbols.
The Fortune Cookie. Need to ask your
l-Hum teaching assistant a question?
Nothing exudes Zen philosophy more
than the thought-provoking, five-word

long fortune cookie-esque quotes, such as
"Value what is really important" or "Be
what you want, but always be you." If your
TA has a sense of humor, be sure to add
"in bed" in parentheses at the end.
The Biographical Information. Sending
off an e-mail about the commencement
speaker to class-of-2()()()@lists? Be sure to
tack on any and all applicable contact
information so any crazed psycho can find
you. This includes your phone number,
P.O. Box, dorm address, home address,
Web site address, e-mail password, SIJID.
Wells Fargo PIN number, mother's maid
en name and the name of your Sea Mon
key (for security purposes). Separate this
information from the body of the e-mail
by any repeating array of ASCII charac
ters mentioned above. To be especially
snazzy, frame it on the top and the bottom.
The "I'm a Hotmail Whore. " So you got
attached to the lightning fast speed and
bulletproof security of your Hotmail c
mail account you had over the summer
while being stuffed inside a restricted ven
tilation cubicle in Santa Clara. But what
you really liked was the complimentary
non-optional signature telling all of your
friends to join Hotmail; it took the pres
sure off of thinking up a signature your
self. Don't fret. Though you now enjoy the
prestige of an @leland address, you can
simply copy your old signature and paste it
into Eudora 4.2. This way, you'll really
impress the Microsoft Network at your
Career Development Center interview.
The Song Lyric. Look through your CD
collection and pick any Dave Matthews
Band album or a washed up band that
used to be popular in the '80s. Open up

the lyrics booklet and go to track three.
Use the first four lines. If these lines have
any insightful meaning, go to the next four
lines. Repeat this process until your signa
ture makes no sense. After two weeks, go
to track four and make a new signature.
The Had Movie. Do you have a movie
that has profoundly affected or inspired
you but no one else? Well, throw it in the
VCR. In a similar manner to the song lyric
signature, fast forward to any random
point and write down the first line you
hear spoken. Again, if it makes any sense,
fast-forward to a line that doesn't.
The Philosophy Quote. Do you feel that
some part of your personality represents a
deeper cosmic understanding that you
can't express in your own words? Then the
philosophy quote is good for you. Be sure
that the author has been dead for at least
200 years. If the signature is less than twice
as long as any e-mail you send, then it is
too short.
The Bible Verse. Nothing converts the
damned more than slapping on Luke 4:21
on the end of your e-mail. For you witty
born-agains, add "in bed" in parentheses
to the end of the quote.
I hope this guide was of help to all in
need. And may the Stanford community
bask in the freshness of new e-mail epi
grams!

Mike Rosenbluth is looking forward to his
aunt's Thanksgiving turkey. If he wanted to,
he could describe the turkey's heat loss
behavior as a function of time once it is
taken out of the oven. Hut he doesn 't.
