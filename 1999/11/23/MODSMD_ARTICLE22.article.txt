BLOOMING I ON. Ind.

NCAA Championships have be
come known for small-margin up
sets.
In 1996, Stanford won its first
title with a five-point win over Vil
lanova. The next year, the Cardi
nal was upset when BYU came out
two points on top. Last year. Vil
lanova held off BYIJ hv four and
Stanford by five.
The crowd at Indiana Universi
ty's cross country course for Yes
terday's NCAA championships
knew this history and thus knew
better than to award the winning
trophy to No. 1 ranked Stanford
Cardinal before the race was over.
But they didn't expect Stanford to
be beaten by 55 points and wind up
in third place behind winner BYI l
and second-place Arkansas, ei
ther.
Stanford's front-runners went
out aggressively with the race's big
guns and early on things looked
good for the Cardinal. Under
overcast skies, in 60-plus degree
weather, the Cardinal's front trio
of Julia Stamps, Erin Sullivan and
Lauren Fleshman charged to the
front, attacking the course's first

and biggest hill. Heading into the
lirst-kilometer marker, Arkansas'
Amy Yoder and Tracy Robertson
were lighting it out with the Cardi
nal women in a tight pack, with the
leader going through in a conserv
ative time of 3 minutes, 18 sec
onds.
Lhe front pack remained
bunched through the first mile,
with Stamps crossing first in a time
of 5:30. At this point in the race,
the crowd was enjoying the specta
tor-friendly course, which ap
peared to be displaying a duel be
tween third-ranked Arkansas and
Stanford. Though Stanford's
fourth runner, senior captain Sally
(ilynn. was far off the leaders,
going into the three-kilometer
marker, all eyes were on Yoder,
Stamps. Arkansas' Lilli Kleinman,
Fleshman, Sullivan and Wiscon
sin's Erica Palmer.
While spectators were definite
ly wondering where Stanford's
four and live runners were, the ex
citement of the race for the indi
vidual title kept them from waiting
in one spot too long. After the
third kilometer, the pace was ac
celerated as the Stanford trio was
dragged by Kleinman. Yoder,
Palmer and North Carolina State's
