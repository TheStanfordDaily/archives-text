## Stanford runners fare well at cross country nationals Women's squad falls to disappointing third spot

BLOOMING I ON. Ind.
Hie women's cross country
NCAA Championships have be
come known for small-margin up
sets.
In 1996, Stanford won its first
title with a five-point win over Vil
lanova. The next year, the Cardi
nal was upset when BYU came out
two points on top. Last year. Vil
lanova held off BYIJ hv four and
Stanford by five.
The crowd at Indiana Universi
ty's cross country course for Yes
terday's NCAA championships
knew this history and thus knew
better than to award the winning
trophy to No. 1 ranked Stanford
Cardinal before the race was over.
But they didn't expect Stanford to
be beaten by 55 points and wind up
in third place behind winner BYI l
and second-place Arkansas, ei
ther.
Stanford's front-runners went
out aggressively with the race's big
guns and early on things looked
good for the Cardinal. Under
overcast skies, in 60-plus degree
weather, the Cardinal's front trio
of Julia Stamps, Erin Sullivan and
Lauren Fleshman charged to the
front, attacking the course's first

and biggest hill. Heading into the
lirst-kilometer marker, Arkansas'
Amy Yoder and Tracy Robertson
were lighting it out with the Cardi
nal women in a tight pack, with the
leader going through in a conserv
ative time of 3 minutes, 18 sec
onds.
Lhe front pack remained
bunched through the first mile,
with Stamps crossing first in a time
of 5:30. At this point in the race,
the crowd was enjoying the specta
tor-friendly course, which ap
peared to be displaying a duel be
tween third-ranked Arkansas and
Stanford. Though Stanford's
fourth runner, senior captain Sally
(ilynn. was far off the leaders,
going into the three-kilometer
marker, all eyes were on Yoder,
Stamps. Arkansas' Lilli Kleinman,
Fleshman, Sullivan and Wiscon
sin's Erica Palmer.
While spectators were definite
ly wondering where Stanford's
four and live runners were, the ex
citement of the race for the indi
vidual title kept them from waiting
in one spot too long. After the
third kilometer, the pace was ac
celerated as the Stanford trio was
dragged by Kleinman. Yoder,
Palmer and North Carolina State's

Freshman Erin Sullivan, seen here competing at the Stanford Invita

NCAA championship meet yesterday. Fleshman placed fifth overall,
while Sullivan finished in seventh.

Palmer, who blasted a 3:09 final
kilometer en route to a winning
time of 16:39.5. dominated the final
portion of the race. Yoder and
Kleinman crossed the line next
with Heshman not far behind in
fifth (16:50.9) and Sullivan in sev
enth (16:56.2). Stamps had the most
trouble in the last stretch, holding
on for 14th (17:02.4).
With the focus on the lead run
ners throughout the race. RYU qui
etly showed why it was the best
team in the nation yesterday. With
no runners in the top ten. BYIJ tal
lied an amazingly low 72 points by
putting all five runners, led by Eliz
abeth Jackson's 11 th place finish, in
26th or better.
Stanford's C ilynn, the fifth-place
finisher at last year's meet, finished
a disappointing 45th in her last
cross country race, and Laura
Turner ended up 100 th to finish the
tally for the Cardinal. Arkansas to
taled 125 points compared to Stan
ford's 127.
"We knew all year it was going
to be a close race even though
everybody thought it was going to
be a runaway." said Stanford head
coach Vin Lananna. "I've been
coaching long enough to know that
BYU and Arkansas would be good
teams. When BYU had five people
within 10 seconds of each other at
their regional meet. I knew they
were going to be tough. They did a
good job. I'm not sure that we could
have beaten them today no matter
what we did."
Despite the less-than-ideal team
finish, both Heshman and Sullivan
capped off incredible seasons in
grand fashion. Heshman. the run
ner-up to Sullivan in the 1998 Foot
locker (high school) National ( ross

Country Championships, had
placed third in both the Pacific 10
Conference Championships and
the Western Regional Qualifiers,
while Sullivan became Stanford's
first Pac-10 champion ever and
then went on to finish second at the
regional meet.
"1 approached this race with a
little more confidence than Foot
lockers because I had a team here,
where at the Foot lockers you're
only an individual," Fleshman said.
"So I felt a lot more comfortable
going in with my teammates, the
people that I've trained with all
season."
Sullivan also showed tremen
dous composure for a newcomer.
"I tried to treat it the same way
we we've been treating all of our
previous races â€” just to really stay
relaxed and just go for it and take
the opportunity." Sullivan said. "I
felt a little more uptight than I have
in previous races because of the
hype that it was NCAAs and be
cause of the crowd, but I tried to
settle in as best as I could. 1 don't
think that this can take away from
anything we've accomplished all
season."
For Stamps, who finished fourth
her freshman year and sixth last
year, a 14th-place finish didn't live
up to expectations, but still earned
her a respectable place on the
awards stand.
"It was an extremely tactical race
and it came down to who could win
the game, who could be the most
tactical." Stamps said. "I think this
race has definitely been the most
competitive race that I've been in
[during] the past three years."
In addition to its fourth-consec
utive trophy-winning performance,
the team took away another year of
experience and holds high hopes
for next year. Stanford loses only
(ilynn and Mary I luang to gradua
tion.

NCAA Championships have be
come known for small-margin up
sets.
In 1996, Stanford won its first
title with a five-point win over Vil
lanova. The next year, the Cardi
nal was upset when BYU came out
two points on top. Last year. Vil
lanova held off BYIJ hv four and
Stanford by five.
The crowd at Indiana Universi
ty's cross country course for Yes
terday's NCAA championships
knew this history and thus knew
better than to award the winning
trophy to No. 1 ranked Stanford
Cardinal before the race was over.
But they didn't expect Stanford to
be beaten by 55 points and wind up
in third place behind winner BYI l
and second-place Arkansas, ei
ther.
Stanford's front-runners went
out aggressively with the race's big
guns and early on things looked
good for the Cardinal. Under
overcast skies, in 60-plus degree
weather, the Cardinal's front trio
of Julia Stamps, Erin Sullivan and
Lauren Fleshman charged to the
front, attacking the course's first

and biggest hill. Heading into the
lirst-kilometer marker, Arkansas'
Amy Yoder and Tracy Robertson
were lighting it out with the Cardi
nal women in a tight pack, with the
leader going through in a conserv
ative time of 3 minutes, 18 sec
onds.
Lhe front pack remained
bunched through the first mile,
with Stamps crossing first in a time
of 5:30. At this point in the race,
the crowd was enjoying the specta
tor-friendly course, which ap
peared to be displaying a duel be
tween third-ranked Arkansas and
Stanford. Though Stanford's
fourth runner, senior captain Sally
(ilynn. was far off the leaders,
going into the three-kilometer
marker, all eyes were on Yoder,
Stamps. Arkansas' Lilli Kleinman,
Fleshman, Sullivan and Wiscon
sin's Erica Palmer.
While spectators were definite
ly wondering where Stanford's
four and live runners were, the ex
citement of the race for the indi
vidual title kept them from waiting
in one spot too long. After the
third kilometer, the pace was ac
celerated as the Stanford trio was
dragged by Kleinman. Yoder,
Palmer and North Carolina State's

Freshman Erin Sullivan, seen here competing at the Stanford Invita
tional, and classmate Lauren Fleshman led the Cardinal effort at
NCAA championship meet yesterday. Fleshman placed fifth overall,
while Sullivan finished in seventh.
('hristy Nichols.
Palmer, who blasted a 3:09 final
kilometer en route to a winning
time of 16:39.5. dominated the final
portion of the race. Yoder and
Kleinman crossed the line next
with Heshman not far behind in
fifth (16:50.9) and Sullivan in sev
enth (16:56.2). Stamps had the most
trouble in the last stretch, holding
on for 14th (17:02.4).
With the focus on the lead run
ners throughout the race. RYU qui
etly showed why it was the best
team in the nation yesterday. With
no runners in the top ten. BYIJ tal
lied an amazingly low 72 points by
putting all five runners, led by Eliz
abeth Jackson's 11 th place finish, in
26th or better.
Stanford's C ilynn, the fifth-place
finisher at last year's meet, finished
a disappointing 45th in her last
cross country race, and Laura
Turner ended up 100 th to finish the
tally for the Cardinal. Arkansas to
taled 125 points compared to Stan
ford's 127.
"We knew all year it was going
to be a close race even though
everybody thought it was going to
be a runaway." said Stanford head
coach Vin Lananna. "I've been
coaching long enough to know that
BYU and Arkansas would be good
teams. When BYU had five people
within 10 seconds of each other at
their regional meet. I knew they
were going to be tough. They did a
good job. I'm not sure that we could
have beaten them today no matter
what we did."
Despite the less-than-ideal team
finish, both Heshman and Sullivan
capped off incredible seasons in
grand fashion. Heshman. the run
ner-up to Sullivan in the 1998 Foot
locker (high school) National ( ross

Country Championships, had
placed third in both the Pacific 10
Conference Championships and
the Western Regional Qualifiers,
while Sullivan became Stanford's
first Pac-10 champion ever and
then went on to finish second at the
regional meet.
"1 approached this race with a
little more confidence than Foot
lockers because I had a team here,
where at the Foot lockers you're
only an individual," Fleshman said.
"So I felt a lot more comfortable
going in with my teammates, the
people that I've trained with all
season."
Sullivan also showed tremen
dous composure for a newcomer.
"I tried to treat it the same way
we we've been treating all of our
previous races â€” just to really stay
relaxed and just go for it and take
the opportunity." Sullivan said. "I
felt a little more uptight than I have
in previous races because of the
hype that it was NCAAs and be
cause of the crowd, but I tried to
settle in as best as I could. 1 don't
think that this can take away from
anything we've accomplished all
season."
For Stamps, who finished fourth
her freshman year and sixth last
year, a 14th-place finish didn't live
up to expectations, but still earned
her a respectable place on the
awards stand.
"It was an extremely tactical race
and it came down to who could win
the game, who could be the most
tactical." Stamps said. "I think this
race has definitely been the most
competitive race that I've been in
[during] the past three years."
In addition to its fourth-consec
utive trophy-winning performance,
the team took away another year of
experience and holds high hopes
for next year. Stanford loses only
(ilynn and Mary I luang to gradua
tion.
