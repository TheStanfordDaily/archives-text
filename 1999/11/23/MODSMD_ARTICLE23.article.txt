"We went into the meet thinking
that it was our last chance to compete
until mid-January," said sophomore
Mike O'Neil. "So we wanted to take
advantage of that."
"It was a good chance to practice
our racing skills before the month
and a half layoff," said junior Clayton
Jones.
The Cardinal was led by sopho
mores O'Neil and Mark Siebert, who
won two events each. O'Neil won
both the 1000-meter freestyle and
the 200-meter individual medley,
while Siebert captured wins in both
the 50-meter and 100-meter
freestyles.
The Cardinal dominated the
Gators, finishing in at least first and
second in each event. The win was a
true team effort, with several Stan
ford swimmers contributing to the
final point total.
"Ouite a few people were really
pleasantly surprised with how they
swam," O'Neil said. "Most ol the
competition really came from within
our own team."
Freshman Thomas Zachowski
won the 200-meter freestyle, with ju
nior Brian Rodde finishing second.
Senior co-captain Kurt Spenser took
the l(X)-meter butterfly, followed
closely by junior Anthony Robinson

and freshman Lee Leatherman. who
finished in second and third, respec
tively.
Junior Steven Brown continued
to be a key contributor, winning the
100-meter backstroke. Freshman
Brad Kleinjans came in second, and
sophomore Pete Lennox-King fin
ished third.

with Robinson and Spenser, claimed
the 200 medley relay. In the 200
freestyle relay. Stanford not only
won the race, but also took second
place.
After winning a fatiguing double
distance meet on Thursday against
California, the Stanford team was
slightlv worn down. Friday's meet
against San Francisco proved to be a
good measure of the team's strength
and endurance, allowing it to see the
payoff of such a rigorous preseason
workout.
"We got to come back the next
day [after the double-distance meet]
and see how the competitions the day
before affected us." ()'Neil said. "We
were able to see our hard work pay
off and see what it meant."
The Cardinal will now go back to
training for approximately seven
weeks until the regular season starts
in January. Most of the training will
be done in the water, as opposed to
dry land workouts.
"It'll be pretty intense." Jones
said. "But it'll get us ready for a pret
ty fun and hopefully successful sea
son in the winter."
