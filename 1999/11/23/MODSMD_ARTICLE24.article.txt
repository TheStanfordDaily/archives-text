BLOOMINCTON, Ind. —
Three All-America performances
boosted the Stanford men to a
fourth-place finish in yesterday's
NCAA Championship meet in
Bloomington. Ind.
Led by the top-tier finishes of
junior Thomas Murley in 16th (30
minutes, 56.2 seconds), senior
Jake Maas in 17th (30:59.9) and
junior Jonathon Riley in 20th
(31:01.8), Stanford tallied 223
points to finish behind defending
champ Arkansas (58), Wisconsin
(185) and North Carolina State
(201) in the 31-team field.
"Being the fourth-best team in
the nation — that's nothing to
hang your head about," team cap
tain Maas said. "We would, of
course, like to do better, but we
didn't. The other teams had a bet
ter day than us."
Arkansas captured its record
10th cross country championship
with the win, and its 127-point
spread over Wisconsin was also a
record.
The pace was fairly conserva
tive from the outset of the 10-kilo
meter (6.2 miles) race, as the lead
pack plowed through the first mile
in 4:52.

Home-crowd favorite Tom
Chorny of Indiana bolted out to
control the early pace and held a
three-meter lead through two
miles.
Further back, Stanford sopho
more Gabe Jennings joined Riley
just behind Murley and Maas,
packing between 30th and 40th
position.
Sophomore Jamey Gifford and
freshmen Adam Tenforde and
Seth I lejny tried to move up from
near 60th, while Arkansas was in
control of the team battle, holding
five of the top 15 spots.
As the race wore on, the Stan
ford troops struggled to maintain
the composure that head coach
Vin Lananna had indicated as a
key to success.
"It was hard not to get anxious
when everyone is yelling at you —
it's just deafening in the first two
or three kilometers," Murley said.
"Hverv time 1 started to feel that
way. I tried to keep myself com
posed.
"I think Jake and I really kept
composed and settled nicely. 1
wasn't sure if were pushing the
pace, especially since we didn't
see Jonathan or Gabe."
At the midway point, the indi
vidual race began to develop, while
Stanford attempted to remain in
contention for a spot among the
top four teams, which was Lanan
na's pre-race goal.
David Kimani of Southern Al
abama took Oregon's Steve Fein
and Arkansas' Michael Power
through five kilometers in 15:11
and Chorny began to fade.
Maas and Murley moved up to
solidify positions in the top 20
while Kilev remained mired near
40th position and Jennings faded
back to near 70th.
"I got good position but on
some of the twists and turns, Gabe
and I got split up," Riley said. "On
some of the turns and hills we got
pushed further and further back,
and I wasn't having the best day.
"I felt it was just impossible to
relax and run like Thomas and
Jake did. They did what we were all
supposed to do."
Meanwhile, Tenforde was also
suffering nearly a minute behind
the leaders.
The race broke at five miles
(24:22), when Kimani made his
move. Arkansas kept three run
ners in the top 10, while Riley
seemed to come alive and began
gunning down whoever was in his
sights.
"1 kept seeing Thomas and Jake
and tried to get up with them."
Riley said. "My goal was to catch
up to them and. at the end, get as
many people as possible."
Over the final mile, Riley
charged up to the top 20 and Maas
and Murley held strong. Farther
back, Hejny caught up to the fad
ing Jennings and tried to maintain
position among the top 1 (K) scorers.
At the finish, it was Kimani —
just a freshman — who prevailed

over all with a time of 30:06.6, bet
tering Bob Kennedy's old course
record.
Arkansas sealed the team victo
ry with three individuals in the top
10, and Stanford's top three gar
nered All-America honors.
Maas and Murley are first-time
All-Americans on the trails, while
Riley received the award for the
third-consecutive year.
Hejny finished 104 th (32:07.1,
80th) and Jennings was 123 rd
(32:21.8.96 th) to cap off Stanford's
scoring. Gifford placed 137 th over
all in 32:34.4, and Tenforde came in
237 th place at 34:45.9.
Despite the success of the Car
dinal's top three, the team did not
feel as though its best efforts were
on display.
"We had a good run for it. but
we lost the confidence we had at
districts — that excitement — for
this meet," Murley said.
"1 think it was definitely the
pressure of an NCAA champi
onship. We tried to treat it like it
was any old meet, but its hard to ig
nore all that goes along with it."
And though Stanford was sec
ond at last year's championships,
the No. 4 finish was still impressive,
considering that the Cardinal grad
uated four of it's top seven athletes
last year and used this season to re
load.
"When you get to the national
championships there are 31 teams
that go to the line," Lananna said.
"The gun goes off and you do the
best you can-you've got to be 'on'
that day.
"You run this race 10 times,
maybe we're 3rd. maybe we're sec
ond. We did as strong a job as we
could have done based on the per
sonnel we had here today."
"1 think these guys can learn
from the experience." sad Maas.

come back hungry next year."

BLOOMINCTON, Ind. —
Three All-America performances
boosted the Stanford men to a
fourth-place finish in yesterday's
NCAA Championship meet in
Bloomington. Ind.
Led by the top-tier finishes of
junior Thomas Murley in 16th (30
minutes, 56.2 seconds), senior
Jake Maas in 17th (30:59.9) and
junior Jonathon Riley in 20th
(31:01.8), Stanford tallied 223
points to finish behind defending
champ Arkansas (58), Wisconsin
(185) and North Carolina State
(201) in the 31-team field.
"Being the fourth-best team in
the nation — that's nothing to
hang your head about," team cap
tain Maas said. "We would, of
course, like to do better, but we
didn't. The other teams had a bet
ter day than us."
Arkansas captured its record
10th cross country championship
with the win, and its 127-point
spread over Wisconsin was also a
record.
The pace was fairly conserva
tive from the outset of the 10-kilo
meter (6.2 miles) race, as the lead
pack plowed through the first mile
in 4:52.

Home-crowd favorite Tom
Chorny of Indiana bolted out to
control the early pace and held a
three-meter lead through two
miles.
Further back, Stanford sopho
more Gabe Jennings joined Riley
just behind Murley and Maas,
packing between 30th and 40th
position.
Sophomore Jamey Gifford and
freshmen Adam Tenforde and
Seth I lejny tried to move up from
near 60th, while Arkansas was in
control of the team battle, holding
five of the top 15 spots.
As the race wore on, the Stan
ford troops struggled to maintain
the composure that head coach
Vin Lananna had indicated as a
key to success.
"It was hard not to get anxious
when everyone is yelling at you —
it's just deafening in the first two
or three kilometers," Murley said.
"Hverv time 1 started to feel that
way. I tried to keep myself com
posed.
"I think Jake and I really kept
composed and settled nicely. 1
wasn't sure if were pushing the
pace, especially since we didn't
see Jonathan or Gabe."
At the midway point, the indi
vidual race began to develop, while
Stanford attempted to remain in
contention for a spot among the
top four teams, which was Lanan
na's pre-race goal.
David Kimani of Southern Al
abama took Oregon's Steve Fein
and Arkansas' Michael Power
through five kilometers in 15:11
and Chorny began to fade.
Maas and Murley moved up to
solidify positions in the top 20
while Kilev remained mired near
40th position and Jennings faded
back to near 70th.
"I got good position but on
some of the twists and turns, Gabe
and I got split up," Riley said. "On
some of the turns and hills we got
pushed further and further back,
and I wasn't having the best day.
"I felt it was just impossible to
relax and run like Thomas and
Jake did. They did what we were all
supposed to do."
Meanwhile, Tenforde was also
suffering nearly a minute behind
the leaders.
The race broke at five miles
(24:22), when Kimani made his
move. Arkansas kept three run
ners in the top 10, while Riley
seemed to come alive and began
gunning down whoever was in his
sights.
"1 kept seeing Thomas and Jake
and tried to get up with them."
Riley said. "My goal was to catch
up to them and. at the end, get as
many people as possible."
Over the final mile, Riley
charged up to the top 20 and Maas
and Murley held strong. Farther
back, Hejny caught up to the fad
ing Jennings and tried to maintain
position among the top 1 (K) scorers.
At the finish, it was Kimani —
just a freshman — who prevailed

over all with a time of 30:06.6, bet
tering Bob Kennedy's old course
record.
Arkansas sealed the team victo
ry with three individuals in the top
10, and Stanford's top three gar
nered All-America honors.
Maas and Murley are first-time
All-Americans on the trails, while
Riley received the award for the
third-consecutive year.
Hejny finished 104 th (32:07.1,
80th) and Jennings was 123 rd
(32:21.8.96 th) to cap off Stanford's
scoring. Gifford placed 137 th over
all in 32:34.4, and Tenforde came in
237 th place at 34:45.9.
Despite the success of the Car
dinal's top three, the team did not
feel as though its best efforts were
on display.
"We had a good run for it. but
we lost the confidence we had at
districts — that excitement — for
this meet," Murley said.
"1 think it was definitely the
pressure of an NCAA champi
onship. We tried to treat it like it
was any old meet, but its hard to ig
nore all that goes along with it."
And though Stanford was sec
ond at last year's championships,
the No. 4 finish was still impressive,
considering that the Cardinal grad
uated four of it's top seven athletes
last year and used this season to re
load.
"When you get to the national
championships there are 31 teams
that go to the line," Lananna said.
"The gun goes off and you do the
best you can-you've got to be 'on'
that day.
"You run this race 10 times,
maybe we're 3rd. maybe we're sec
ond. We did as strong a job as we
could have done based on the per
sonnel we had here today."
"1 think these guys can learn
from the experience." sad Maas.

come back hungry next year."
