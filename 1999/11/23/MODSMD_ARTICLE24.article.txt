BLOOMINCTON, Ind. —
Three All-America performances
boosted the Stanford men to a
fourth-place finish in yesterday's
NCAA Championship meet in
Bloomington. Ind.
Led by the top-tier finishes of
junior Thomas Murley in 16th (30
minutes, 56.2 seconds), senior
Jake Maas in 17th (30:59.9) and
junior Jonathon Riley in 20th
(31:01.8), Stanford tallied 223
points to finish behind defending
champ Arkansas (58), Wisconsin
(185) and North Carolina State
(201) in the 31-team field.

control of the team battle, holding
five of the top 15 spots.
As the race wore on, the Stan
ford troops struggled to maintain
the composure that head coach
Vin Lananna had indicated as a
key to success.
"It was hard not to get anxious
when everyone is yelling at you —

"Hverv time 1 started to feel that

"I think Jake and I really kept
