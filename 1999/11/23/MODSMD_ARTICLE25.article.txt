While the football team enjoyed
a Big (lame victory, things didn't
come up roses for every Stanford

MEN S WATER POLO
â–  Saturday: No. 4 ('alifornia (12-10.
4-4 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) 10. No. 2 Stanford ( P)-3,7-1) 6.

I lie good news for the Cardinal
is that "in the overall scheme of
things the loss has no bearing on the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
Tournament or the NCAAs." ac
cording to Stanford head coach
I)antc I)cttamanti.
Because Stanford (19-3, 7-1
MPSF) and Cal (12-10. 4-4) had al
ready secured their seeds at next
weekend's MPSF Tournament, sec
ond and fourth respectively, the
outcome of Saturday s game had no
national implications. I lowever. the
game was yet another in a long and
intense rivalry and the winner can
claim bragging rights until next
year's Big Splash.
Clearly fueled by the rivalry and
the thousands of fans surrounding
deCiuerre pool, the Bears seemed
to forget that they had already been
beaten bv the Cardinal twice this

season. Led by lour goals from ju
nior Jerry Smith. Cal took an early
lead and never let up. finding the
net every time the Stanford squad
tried to pull itself haek into the
game.
After scoring the lone goal of the
first period, the Bears took a 2-0

lead off a goal by sophomore Joe
Kaiser, electrifying the heavily
blue-and-gold-clad audience. Stan
lord quickly responded with a goal
by sophomore Onno Koelman. But
the Bears put in a man-up goal in
the last minute of the half to go up 3-

Two major turning points came
in the third quarter. Only 30 sec
onds into the period, a two-point
goal by Cal senior Albert Won dou
bled the Bears' lead from two to
four. A minute and a half later.
