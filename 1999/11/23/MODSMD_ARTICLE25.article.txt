# Cal comes away with Big Splash win
## 
### Erin Bouchier Staff writer 
While the football team enjoyed
a Big (lame victory, things didn't
come up roses for every Stanford
team on Saturday. In its final regu
lar-season match, the Big Splash,
the No. 2 men's water polo team
was upset by No. 4 California 10-6.

MEN S WATER POLO
■ Saturday: No. 4 ('alifornia (12-10.
4-4 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) 10. No. 2 Stanford ( P)-3,7-1) 6.

I lie good news for the Cardinal
is that "in the overall scheme of
things the loss has no bearing on the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
Tournament or the NCAAs." ac
cording to Stanford head coach
I)antc I)cttamanti.
Because Stanford (19-3, 7-1
MPSF) and Cal (12-10. 4-4) had al
ready secured their seeds at next
weekend's MPSF Tournament, sec
ond and fourth respectively, the
outcome of Saturday s game had no
national implications. I lowever. the
game was yet another in a long and
intense rivalry and the winner can
claim bragging rights until next
year's Big Splash.
Clearly fueled by the rivalry and
the thousands of fans surrounding
deCiuerre pool, the Bears seemed
to forget that they had already been
beaten bv the Cardinal twice this

season. Led by lour goals from ju
nior Jerry Smith. Cal took an early
lead and never let up. finding the
net every time the Stanford squad
tried to pull itself haek into the
game.
After scoring the lone goal of the
first period, the Bears took a 2-0

lead off a goal by sophomore Joe
Kaiser, electrifying the heavily
blue-and-gold-clad audience. Stan
lord quickly responded with a goal
by sophomore Onno Koelman. But
the Bears put in a man-up goal in
the last minute of the half to go up 3-

Two major turning points came
in the third quarter. Only 30 sec
onds into the period, a two-point
goal by Cal senior Albert Won dou
bled the Bears' lead from two to
four. A minute and a half later.

Senior Andy Walburger winds up for a shot against the California defense on Saturday, as senior
Michael Lipinski looks on. Stanford dropped the 10-6 Big Splash decision to the Golden Bears.
Stanford had a chance to yet hack
into the game as a Cal player was
kicked out. However, the referrees
kicked out Stanford freshman Peter
Hudnut as well, squandering the
( animal's man-up opportunity.
With Cal scoring a minute later
on it's own 6-on-5. "instead of a 5-2
score, we were facing a 6-1 score."
Dettanianti said. "Water polo is a
short game, so it's really hard to
conic from so far behind."
Stanford tried to come hack,
pulling to within three at the end of
the third quarter, after goals by
Hudnut and senior Sean Joy. Bui
once again the Bears prevented the
( animal from getting back into the
game. ( al defense slopped a ( ardi
nal goal on an early fourih-pcriod
man-up opportunity. And within
the next two minutes Smith and
I Idad I la/or scored for the Bears to
give ( al an N-3 lead. Irom there the
Bears never looked back.
I lie loss left the Cardinal per
plexed.

"I don't know why we were play
ing so poorly. There's no reason
they should have scored 10 goals
against us." Dettanianti said.
And while the Stanford defense
should not have allowed so many
points, the real problem lies with the
Cardinal's offense. The squad has
been mired in a scoring slump for
the last month. As the team heads to
the MPSF Tournament next week
end. it has to "find some ways to
score some more goals." according
to Dettanianti
Fortunately for the Cardinal, the
road ahead is clear. The winner of
the MPS! Tournament will earn an
automatic bid to December's
NCAA Tournament. Stanford will
have to beat No. 6 Pepperdine and
then likely No. 3 I JSC in order to
reach the MPSI I ournament final.
" I he guvs realize what we have
to do and the outcome of the Cal
game doesn't change that.," Detta
nianti said. " l liey're going to have
to i isc to the occasion this weekend.
It's down to do or die. We know ex
actly what we need to do to reach
the NCAA Tournament. We have
to win two games."
