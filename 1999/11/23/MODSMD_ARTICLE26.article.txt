## 
### Emily Cadei Contributing writer 
With ;i share of the Pacific 10
Conferences title in the bag. the No.
2 Stanford women's volleyball team
(25-2) would love to look ahead to
the NCAA tournament, but before it
can receive its seed for the 19W play
offs next Sunday, the squad has to
face off against unranked Santa
Clara (20-9) tonight.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Tonight: No. 2 Stanford (25-2) at
Santa Clara (2()- 1 )), 7 p.m.

To overlook a hungry Broncos
squad fighting for its postseason life
would be a mistake. A victory over
the Cardinal would make Santa
Clara's season and likely propell
them into the NCAA tournament,
simultaneously destroying Stan

ford's chances at a top seed. And
while the Broncos are not exactly
among the nation's elite, they have
proven this season that they can play
with top squads, defeating then-No.
21 San Diego earlier in November
and just last weekend extending No.
8 Peppcrdine to five games in a close
ly contested match. In other words,
while a Tuesday night road game
against an unranked team might
seem a hit of a drag, it is imperative

that the Cardinal not go on Thanks
giving break a day early.
The Broncos present an offensive
threat in the form of junior outside
hitter Yncz Carrasco. who set a
school record with 35 kills against
San Diego. Sophomore middle
blocker Brook Terhune also supplies
consistent offense for Santa Clara.
On defense, Stanford outside hit
tcrs will have to deal with the strong
middle blocking tandem of senior
I aura beholds and junior Amy
Kohl.
Stanford will look to its big guns
senior outside hitter kerri Walsh
and freshman outside hitter Logan
lorn, both All-America candidates
i' > lead the wav ayainst the Bron-

Cos. Middle blockers junior Jenn
I )etmer and sophomores Tara ( on
rad and Sara Sandrik. will be kept
busy attempting to silence the likes
of ( arrasco. but if the defense con
tinues the domination of the net it
has displayed of late, this should not
he a problem for the ('ardinal.
Overall, if Stanford maintains its
focus against Santa Clara, il should
have no problem disposing of the
Broncos. I hen the team can really
start its Thanksi>i\ ing break.
