Stanford alumni Victor Velcules
cu and I .isa Goodrich recently won
the prestigious Amersham Pharma
cia Biotech and Science Magazine's
Young Scientist Prize.
Established in 1995, the Young
Scientist Prize provides support lor
molecular biologists at the beginning
of their career. Each regional winner
receives $S.(XX). and the grand prize
winner receivess2.\(XX).
I his year's applicants had to have
earned their Ph. D.sin 1998 and had
to submit a I.(KX)-word essay based
on their dissertations.
The four regional winners and
grand prize winner will be honored
on Dec. 9 at Uppsala University in
Sweden in a ceremony coinciding
with the Nobel Prize festivities.
Velculescu, a 29-year old cancer
researcher at the Johns I lopkins On
cology ( enter in Baltimore, was the
grand prize winner for his enterpris
ing work on a technique that pro
vides a "snapshot" of all active genes
inside a cell.
The human genome contains ap
proximately HX).(XX) genes but only a
fraction of them are "turned on" at
any given time. Velculescu's method,
known as SAGF. (serial analysis of
gene expression), allows scientists to
zoom in quickly into these genes.
I he technique promises to be a
boon for scientists worldwide search
ing for cures for cancer and other dis
eases.
Velculescu, a native of Romania,
moved to California in 1977 and
studied biology and biochemistry at
Stanford before enrolling in a joint
M l). / Ph.l), program at I lopkins.
"I must credit my early interest in
biomedical sciences to my experi-

ences at Stanford," he said.
Newly wed. he intends to contin
ue his research in genetics and
human disease but has no definite
plans for the grand prize money. "I'll
probably give some to charity," he
told Science. "Oh, and maybe pay off
some honeymoon debts."
Winner of the region USA award,
Goodrich is currently at UC-San
Francisco.
Goodrich identified a gene in
mice that may lead to the develop
ment of drugs to treat certain birth
defects and a common form of skin
cancer. This gene was previously
known only in fruit flies.
Its discovery in mammals adds to
the growing body of evidence that
cancer is caused by malfunction of
normal systems.
The other three regional winners
were Toshirnasa Yamauchi (Japan
region), Marilia Cascalho (Europe
region-Portugal) and Giles Harding
ham (Europe region-UK).
On the eve of the completion of
the Human Genome Project, these
discoveries anticipate the next mil
lennium's scientific challenge — to
uncover the function of the thou
sands of genes in the human body.
In a press release put out by Sci
ence, Floyd Bloom, editor in chief of
Science, said the winners should be
"proud to take part in recognizing
this cutting-edge research," and that
he "would like to congratulate all of
this year's winners on their outstand
ing contributions to molecular biolo
gy-"
Ron Long, an executive of Amer
sham Pharmacia Biotech, said to Sci
ence, "Support and recognition for
[these young scientists'] achieve
ments is essential for the continued
discovery of new drugs and thera
pies."
