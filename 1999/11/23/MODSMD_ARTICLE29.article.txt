# Ripple makes waves at FINA meeet
## 
### Mary Cobb Editorial staff 
Stanford athletes have a history
of breaking records — sometimes
even world records. Sophomore
Shelly Ripple got to experience this
Cardinal record-breaking tradition
first-hand when she participated in
the I INA (The International Feder
ation of Swimming) World Cup
meet in College Park. Md.. in which
three world records were broken.
Ripple, not new to the scene of
international competition, (a gold
medallist as a member of the 4xloo
medley relay team at the 199K
Goodwill Games and a finalist in
four events at the 19% Olympic Tri
als), traveled to Maryland with
Stanford alum Jenny Thompson
and three-time ()lynipian Dara I or
res.
Between the three of them, thev

broke one world record, set two
U.S. Open records, won six gold
medals, two silver medals, two
bronze medals and garnered top-10
honors in 16 events.
Ripple, while leaving the world
record-breaking task to Thompson,
took on another task of equal diffi
culty: breaking all her previous best
limes. She did it though, and came
away with a gold medal in the 200-
meter butterfly in a time of 2 min
utes. 10.02 seconds, as well as fourth
place in the 100 1M (1:03.2). fifth in
the 200IM (2:14.69), sixth in the 100
butterfly (1:00.27) and seventh in
the 50 butterfly (27:01)
What does she attribute this feat
to?
"The environment of the meet.
There were three world records bro
ken. The environment just makes
you forget about how (bad or tired]
you are feeling."

Apparently Thompson forgot
how she was feeling as well, at least
during the second day of the event,
when she broke three records of
varying kinds. After winning the 100
freestyle in a U.S. Open-record time
of 53.49, she rested for an hour,
came back to set another U.S Open
record in the 100 IM with a time of
1:01.(X). rested for 16 minutes, and
then came back again to set a world
record in the 50 fly, replacing her
previous world record time of 26.05
with a new time of 26.00.
Torres, the third member of the
Stanford-affiliated contingency that
traveled to Maryland, has her own
reasons to be proud. After taking a
seven-year break from competition,
she has returned, and is now. under
the coaching skills of Stanford head
coach Richard Ouick. hoping to be
the first woman ever to make it to
four Olympic Games. At the U.S

Open, which was her first major
competition since the 1992
Barcelona Olympic Games, she set
lifetime bests in all her events and
took home two silver medals, in the
50 and 100 free, and two bronze
medals in the 200 free and 50 fly. All
this was enough to make Ripple
think that "Torres did awesome".
The trio of Ripple. Thompson
and Torres witnessed and experi
enced the same degree of heroism
and shock that all the Stanford fans
did last Saturday at the football
game.
The only difference, perhaps, is
that while the Cardinal football
team is now preparing to compete
against the best of the Big 10 Con
ference, the swimming trio, and the
rest of the Stanford swim team, will
be preparing to compete against the
best in the world. Now that calls for
some crowd control.
