I he question of excitement is no longer whether
Stanford will play in the Rose Bowl, but rather how
students w ill manage to attend.

As many consider whether to forego pre
vious New Year's Lve plans for the Jan.

I game in Pasadena, Calif., the Ath
letic Department is seeking ways to
subsidize the expensive $115 tick
ets.

According to Cheryl Lcvick,
the department's senior associ
ate athletic director, "The en
thusiasm at Big Game was phe
nomenal."
"Students are the group we re
ally want down there."

The Athletic Department would
like students — graduate and under-

graduate — to purchase as many of the
33,000 tickets the Department is responsible for
selling as possible.
So far, it is certain that a ticket will be available for
every student willing to pay in cash, check or money

order at the ticket office on Dec. 2 or 3.
The Athletic Department will accept no phone or
ders and ni) credit cards.
Levick hopes more than 5,000 students will show
up. but she said they have found "no luck with (a sub
sidy J so far."

Though many die-hard fans such as those

willing to sleep out in the rain the night
before Big Game against California
last Saturvdav will find a way to go

to the Rose Bowl no matter what,
other students may face difficul
ties after purchasing a ticket.
Sophomore Jacob Young
would go "for sure," except for
one difficulty.
"Transportation, trans
portation. transportation." he
said.
"I definitely want to go. but I'm not

sure I want to deal with the hassle of
getting a plane ticket and a ride to the
game."
While the Athletic Department has no plans to
transport students to Pasadena, it will announce the
price for tickets later this week.
