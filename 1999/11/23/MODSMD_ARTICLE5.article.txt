# Surgeon bridges 'medicine gap' in talk
## 
### Amy Lin 
As part of an effort to spotlight the need
for using standard protocols in the treatment
of traumatic head injuries. Iranian neurosur
geon Dr. Jamshid (ilia jar spoke last night to
an audience of about SO at Kresge Auditori
um.
Ghajar is chief of neurosurgery at Ja
maica I iospital in New York, clinical associ
ate professor of neurosurgery at Cornell
I Jnivcrsity and the founder and president ol
the non-profit Brain Trauma Foundation.
Entitled From Art to Science: The New
Era of Traumatic Brain Injury Treatment,
his presentation consisted of a lecture, a
showing of an episode from ABC' I'rimetimc
that features Ghajar "s work and question
and-answer sessions.
"The theme of the talk." Ghajar said, "is

about the gap between science and the prac
tice of medicine."
In IWS, Ghajar and other experts in the
field of head trauma developed a set of
guidelines for treating head injuries by re
viewing 3.000 research articles in the field
and culling the most scientifically sound
practices.
I heir findings were compiled into The
Guidelines for the Management of Severe
I lead Injury, which has been sent to neuro
surgeons across the country in an attempt to
decrease the variability of treatments used
from one trauma center to another.
Despite this. Ghajar has seen a slow in
crease in the implementation of these tech
niques. Over the 10 years that they have
been promoted, there has been only a 10-
percent rise in the techniques' usage.
I his resistance. Ghajar said, is due partly

to resident physicians' learning "in a very
practical, hands-on manner, and it's very dif
ficult to change thereafter." What is done in
clinical practice is often "an experimental
art: there's no real scientific basis."
Critical aspects of the treatment guide
lines are the monitoring of intereranial pres
sure and the use of medication to keep blood
pressure above brain pressure, so that the
brain receives adequate oxygen and blood
supplies. Though relatively simple to per
form. these procedures apparently pose ad
ditional unwanted hassles to medical per
sonnel. thus discouraging their use.
"Care is not what it should be. not ac
cording to the evidence," Ghajar said.
Dara Gharemani, Ghajar's half-brother
and a doctoral student in psychology at Stan-


Katrin Cowan Daily
Dr. Jamshid Ghajar spoke to a crowd of 80 students last night about the "gap be
tween science and the practice of medicine."
ford, echoed Ghajar's sentiments: "I
was very surprised that he's had to
fight so hard for these guidelines.
Most of the public believes that the
standard of care in hospitals is the
best that you can find."
"One thing that I've always taken
for granted with him." said Ghare
mani, "is that he actually cares for pa
tients. .. I le's always wanted to do
the best for people."
Using his techniques, Ghajar
saved the life of a young concert pi
anist who was brutally beaten in Cen

tral Park in 19%. Since then, his wot k
has been profiled in New Yorker
Magazine and on Coma, a PBS
N( )VA program.
"It's not my procedure." Ghajar
stressed. "I like to think ol myself as
an enabler."
Bita Mizani. an Iranian woman in
the audience, expressed why she at
tended the presentation. "I was intci
ested in the new technology because I
was involved in an accident myself."
At the end of the presentation.
(ihajar was giv en a plaque b\ the Pei
sian Student Association, which
sponsored the event, in recognition ol
being an "outstanding member < >1 the
Iranian community."
