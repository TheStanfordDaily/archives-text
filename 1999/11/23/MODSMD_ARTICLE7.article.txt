# UC approves hospital split
## Regents seal merger's fate 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
With a unanimous vote by the
University of California Board of
Regents, another nail was placed in
the coffin of the U('SI--Stanford
Hospitals merger. The UC regents
formally approved the dissolution of
the merger last Thursday.
The unraveling of the merger will
take years. I lowever, the financial
hardship that forced the dissolution
of the merger is causing more imme
diate effects. UCSF's Mount Zion
Hospital emergency room is sched
uled to close at midnight tonight.
The immediate closing of the
emergency room is unexpected. Ted
Schrock, chief medical officer for
IJC-San Francisco, told the San
Francisco Chronicle that the decision
to close Mount Zion was made only
last Friday.
The plans for closing operations
at Mount Zion have been as troubled
as its recent financial history.
The initial decision to close the

emergency room at Mount Zion was
made on Sept. 23. On the same date,
administrators filed a notice to the
state of California, serving a 9()-da\
notice of the Hospital's closing
Under the notice, emergency room
service would continue until I )ec. 23.
Complications arose when the
contracts of emergency room doc
tors extended only through today.
In an October interview. Dr
Brian Ciodell. acting chief adminis
trative office for IJCSF Stanford
said. "(letting physician coverage in
the emergency room will be chal
lenging. We can't guarantee any
thing past Nov. 23."
Despite this uncertainty, early last
week it appeared as if emergency ser
vices at Mount Zion would remain
open for another month. At a public
hearing early last the week. Ciodell
said interim doctors had been found
and the emergency room could re
main open.
However, last Fridav. officials de
cided that it was unsafe to allow the
emergency room to remain open.
"It's a hard decision. We've been
stewing over it. But patient saletv re
quires it." led Sell rock. I K SI chief
medical examiner, told I he Chroni
cle.
An additional factor, he said, was
the departure of three emergence
room nurses, which further de
creased the level of nursing staff.
Carl Bloice. spokesman for the
California Nurses Association, said
stalling levels were not low enough to
warrant the closing. " The nurses
deny that emphatically." he said.
" The nurses say they have been
begging to keep the emergency room
open." Bloice said, "and that there
are ample nurses to keep the emer
genev room open."
When the doors to the emergency
room close tonight, emergency pa
ticnts will be routed to IK SI Med
ical C enter on Parnassus Avenue.
Parnassus is expected to have 10 new
emergency room beds available b\
today, to replace those lost b\ the
closing.
Bloice said these beds ma\ not be
sufficient. "\\ e are glad to know lhe\
are putting in extra beds But given
the reports we have been given, the
Iobedsma\ not be enough." lie said

I lie closing of the emergency
room at Mount Zion was initiated as
a cost cutting measure by the UCSF-
Stanford hospital system. A state
audit blamed the hospital for up to
$60 million of the merger's $K6-mil
lion loss for the most recent fiscal
year. I'he mounting financial losses
proved to be too much for UCSF-
Stanford. On Oct, 2K, in what he
named as one of the most anguishing
decisions of his presidency. Universi
ty President Clerhard Casper called
for dissolving the merger.
In voting for the dissolution, the
I ( regents agreed with ('asper's rec
ommendation. The Stanford Board
ol Trustees has yet to vote on the de
rision to dissolve the merger.
I he breakup ol the merger will be
finished March I, at the earliest. IJC
I xecutive Vice President William
(iurtner told I'he Chronicle.
I he breakup of the merger could
pr< >ve to be as tumultuous as its short
life. ( urrent dissolution plans call for
each school to reclaim their assets
and split the losses half and half, ac
cording to the Associated Press.
I lowcver. this will not be without
cost. I'he merger's creation cost $7 I J
million, and dissolution costs could
be even higher.
Have you ever seen a divorce
that was cheaper than the wedding?"
I)i Ice (ioldman, UCSI-" acting vice
chancellor for medical affairs, asked
the Associated Press.
