# Stanford math profs, join protest

### Udara Fernando Contributing writer 
About 200 mathematicians and
scientists, including a team of profes
sors at Stanford I Iniversity, sent a let
ter last week to U.S. Secretary of Hd
ucation Richard W. Kiley advising
him to withdraw the federal govern
ment's sup|x>rt for 10 mathematics
programs for schoolchildren.
The letter criticizes the Depart
ment of Education for endorsing the
10 programs, which are already in use
across the country. The authors of the
letter said the proposed programs
have "serious mathematical short
comings."
According to Mathematics Prof.
James Milgrani, a co-author of the
letter, one of the fundamental prob
lems with the proposed programs is
that certain characteristics of proven

math programs are either not repre
sented or are very weakly represent
ed.
"All of the programs suppress al
gebra," he added, pointing out that
the department itself had recently re
leased a study showing that the high
est correlation between courses
taken ink-12 and success in college
were for Algebra 1 and 2. "Several
Haws with the department's endorse
ments can be traced to its aim to cre
ate a common core of mathematics
ili.it all students can master."
I he authors of the letter are
against this "dumbing down" of cur
i icula.
"We want to see programs that
aie aimed at the average students."
Milgram said, "but what we have
here are programs aimed at the
weakest kills." I he result of this re
adjustment of the standard is that

overall achievement in mathematics
and sciences will dramatically de
crease.
For example, the percentage of
students needing to take remedial
math courses in colleges in the C'ali
fornia State system have risen from
23 percent to 56 percent in the last
decade. I he letter blames this on pro
grams such as those recommended
by the Department of Education,
"There are curricula out there that
have proven to be effective," said
Milgram, "but if these are going to be
introduced, the changes have to take
place gradually and delicately."
Milgram cited the mathematical
curricula of counties such as Singa
pore. Russia and Japan as examples
of successful, though more advanced.
"II these countries can achieve suc
cess over such a wide range of the
population, there's no reason to think

that American kids can't do the
same," he said.
Although the government does
not have the power to mandate cer
tain curricula for schools to use, rec
ommendations by the Department of
Education can pressure school dis
tricts to adopt certain curricula. "We
want to provide educators with sup
port to counter the department's rec
ommendations." Milgram said.
The signers of the letter include
Stanford Math Dept. Chair Leon
Simon and the Caltech math depart
ment chair, as well as professors from
the IJC-Berkeley, the University of
Chicago and Stanford, Harvard and
Princeton Universities.
Two winners of the Fields Medal
and four Nobel laureates in Physics,
including laureate and Stanford
Physics Prof. Steven Chu, also signed
the letter.
