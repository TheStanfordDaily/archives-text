# Terman transformed Stanford
## 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
To anyone who has even
glimpsed the gigantic Frederick M.
Terman Engineering Center, it
might seem inconceivable that the
building's namesake once carried
out his engineering research in a
soggy basement lined with pans to
catch leaks.
One of his research assistants, a
young Bill Hewlett, boosted
morale by stocking the pans with
goldfish.
As provost during the 1950s

and 60s, Ter
man led Stan
ford's emer
gence as a pre
mier research
university. Dur
ing his remark
able career at
Stanford, Ter-

man served as the head of the
Electrical Engineering Depart
ment and dean of the School of
Engineering, as well as provost,
until his retirement in 1965.
"More than any other single
person, he's responsible for mov
ing Stanford from its previous po
sition. as a not-bad regional uni
versity. to a world-class universi
ty," said Hob Rosenzweig, former
University vice president for pub
lic affairs.
Many would say his influence
extends even further. The so
called "Father of Silicon Valley"
founded the Stanford Industrial
Park and shaped the development
of numerous technology compa
nies.
Steeples of Excellence

Terman, who died in IW2, be
lieved strongly that in order for
Stanford to compete with presti
gious East Coast universities, it
had to have top faculty and staff.
His philosophy revolved
around the concept of "steeples of
excellence" — the recruitment of
individuals at the tops of their
fields.
"To build eminence," Terman
said. Stanford needed to "get peo
ple who have really good ideas of
their own. and let them get the
grants that will support what they
want to do."
This concept radically changed
Stanford's hiring practices, ac
cording to Rosenzweig. A depart
ment might hire fewer professors
but pay them higher salaries.
According to Statistics Prof.
Emeritus Albert Bowker. a col
league of Terman's and a former
chancellor of UC-Berkeley, Ter
man's mission was not without ob
stacles.
"When you begin to raise the
quality and standards for faculty,
the faculty who were there don't
appreciate it." Bowker said.
Father of the Silicon Valley
Terman was widely known as a
strong supporter of both students
and colleagues with big ideas,
many of whom used their Stanford
experience to launch into industry.
1 lis most famous proteges were
Hewlett and David Packard, but
he brought many others to Stan
lord. including Russell Varian and
Ed Gin/ton of Varian Associates,
William Schockley of Bell Labs
and Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi.
He-also ofteiLiUied royalties from

the sales of his extremely success
ful textbooks to help his associates
start companies.
Sparked by Terman's efforts,
the University established the
Stanford Industrial Park in 1951 to
further collaboration between
academia and the budding high
tech industry.
The park became a model for
future industrial parks worldwide,
while Stanford and Silicon Valley
still benefit today.
"Stanford has gained a lot of its
strength by being able to leverage
from close relationships with in
dustry," said University Provost
John Hennessy.
Government Contracts
In 1942, Terman left Stanford
to head Harvard's Radio Research
Lab in developing countermea
sures against enemy radar. He
later returned to the West Coast
with a commendation from the
British government and the U.S.
government's highest award for
civilians, the Medal for Merit.
Terman also brought back a
firm conviction that the future of
academic research lay in federal
funding.

"|Terman| believed quite
strongly that the government
should make an investment in
basic research for the health of the
country," said Hennessy. "He saw
it as an opportunity to build the
University."
In bringing millions of dollars
worth of government research
contracts to Stanford in the post
war years, Terman was influential
in creating standards for federally
funded research.
According to these standards,
research must have an educational
focus, and be guided by the inter
ests of the faculty and not adminis
trators. A faculty member's role
on a project should be to research,
rather than manage, and the uni
versity should cooperate by reduc
ing the teaching load.
"On the one hand, it brought
money and opportunity and peo
ple to Stanford, said Rosenzweig.
"On the other hand, it brought
classified research to the Universi
ty, secret research."
Stanford, along with most other
universities, agreed to keep some
government research secret dur
ing the height of the Cold War.
These policies came under fire


Terman

during the anti-Vietnam War
movement of the late l%()s, when
the University was accused of con
tributing to the war effort through
its research.
Also, the research grants that
Terman brought to the University
were predominantly in engineering
and the sciences. He felt that suc
cess in the sciences would eventual
ly trickle down to the liberal arts.
'Uncommon .Man"
In IM7K, Terman received the
"Degree of the Uncommon Man,"
an award created to recognizc
unique and outstanding service to
Stanford.
Among his other accolades were
the Stanford Alumni Association's
Herbert Hoover Medal for Distin
guished Service, the first member
for-life designation from the Amer

ican Institute for Electrical Engi
neers and membership in the Na
tional Academy of Sciences along
side his father, Lewis Terman.
The elder Terman, a Stanford
psychology professor and develop
er of the Stanford-Binet intelli
gence tests, applied his unique
child-rearing philosophy to young
Fred. Encouraged to roam freely
and to explore his own interests by
his parents, Terman, who was born
in Indiana, didn't enter school or
learn to read until the age of eight
and a half.
When Lewis Terman was hired
by Stanford, his son knew that he
had found a new home. "During
my early years ... 1 fished for black
bass in Felt Lake. I learned to swim
in Lagunita," Fred Terman said in
his 1%5 commencement speech.
Terman, described as "over
poweringly organized" and known
tor working seven days a week, was
once asked about taking vacations.
"Why bother." he responded,
"when your work is more fun?"

his parents, Terman, who was born
in Indiana, didn't enter school or
learn to read until the age of eight
and a half.
When Lewis Terman was hired
by Stanford, his son knew that he
had found a new home. "During
my early years ... 1 fished for black
bass in Felt Lake. I learned to swim
in Lagunita," Fred Terman said in
his 1%5 commencement speech.
Terman, described as "over
poweringly organized" and known
tor working seven days a week, was
once asked about taking vacations.
"Why bother." he responded,
"when your work is more fun?"
To anyone who has even
glimpsed the gigantic Frederick M.
Terman Engineering Center, it
might seem inconceivable that the
building's namesake once carried
out his engineering research in a
soggy basement lined with pans to
catch leaks.
One of his research assistants, a
young Bill Hewlett, boosted
morale by stocking the pans with
goldfish.
As provost during the 1950s

and 60s, Ter
man led Stan
ford's emer
gence as a pre
mier research
university. Dur
ing his remark
able career at
Stanford, Ter-

man served as the head of the
Electrical Engineering Depart
ment and dean of the School of
Engineering, as well as provost,
until his retirement in 1965.
"More than any other single
person, he's responsible for mov
ing Stanford from its previous po
sition. as a not-bad regional uni
versity. to a world-class universi
ty," said Hob Rosenzweig, former
University vice president for pub
lic affairs.
Many would say his influence
extends even further. The so
called "Father of Silicon Valley"
founded the Stanford Industrial
Park and shaped the development
of numerous technology compa
nies.
Steeples of Excellence

Terman, who died in IW2, be
lieved strongly that in order for
Stanford to compete with presti
gious East Coast universities, it
had to have top faculty and staff.
His philosophy revolved
around the concept of "steeples of
excellence" — the recruitment of
individuals at the tops of their
fields.
"To build eminence," Terman
said. Stanford needed to "get peo
ple who have really good ideas of
their own. and let them get the
grants that will support what they
want to do."
This concept radically changed
Stanford's hiring practices, ac
cording to Rosenzweig. A depart
ment might hire fewer professors
but pay them higher salaries.
According to Statistics Prof.
Emeritus Albert Bowker. a col
league of Terman's and a former
chancellor of UC-Berkeley, Ter
man's mission was not without ob
stacles.
"When you begin to raise the
quality and standards for faculty,
the faculty who were there don't
appreciate it." Bowker said.
Father of the Silicon Valley
Terman was widely known as a
strong supporter of both students
and colleagues with big ideas,
many of whom used their Stanford
experience to launch into industry.
1 lis most famous proteges were
Hewlett and David Packard, but
he brought many others to Stan
lord. including Russell Varian and
Ed Gin/ton of Varian Associates,
William Schockley of Bell Labs
and Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi.
He-also ofteiLiUied royalties from

the sales of his extremely success
ful textbooks to help his associates
start companies.
Sparked by Terman's efforts,
the University established the
Stanford Industrial Park in 1951 to
further collaboration between
academia and the budding high
tech industry.
The park became a model for
future industrial parks worldwide,
while Stanford and Silicon Valley
still benefit today.
"Stanford has gained a lot of its
strength by being able to leverage
from close relationships with in
dustry," said University Provost
John Hennessy.
Government Contracts
In 1942, Terman left Stanford
to head Harvard's Radio Research
Lab in developing countermea
sures against enemy radar. He
later returned to the West Coast
with a commendation from the
British government and the U.S.
government's highest award for
civilians, the Medal for Merit.
Terman also brought back a
firm conviction that the future of
academic research lay in federal
funding.

"|Terman| believed quite
strongly that the government
should make an investment in
basic research for the health of the
country," said Hennessy. "He saw
it as an opportunity to build the
University."
In bringing millions of dollars
worth of government research
contracts to Stanford in the post
war years, Terman was influential
in creating standards for federally
funded research.
According to these standards,
research must have an educational
focus, and be guided by the inter
ests of the faculty and not adminis
trators. A faculty member's role
on a project should be to research,
rather than manage, and the uni
versity should cooperate by reduc
ing the teaching load.
"On the one hand, it brought
money and opportunity and peo
ple to Stanford, said Rosenzweig.
"On the other hand, it brought
classified research to the Universi
ty, secret research."
Stanford, along with most other
universities, agreed to keep some
government research secret dur
ing the height of the Cold War.
These policies came under fire


Terman

during the anti-Vietnam War
movement of the late l%()s, when
the University was accused of con
tributing to the war effort through
its research.
Also, the research grants that
Terman brought to the University
were predominantly in engineering
and the sciences. He felt that suc
cess in the sciences would eventual
ly trickle down to the liberal arts.
'Uncommon .Man"
In IM7K, Terman received the
"Degree of the Uncommon Man,"
an award created to recognizc
unique and outstanding service to
Stanford.
Among his other accolades were
the Stanford Alumni Association's
Herbert Hoover Medal for Distin
guished Service, the first member
for-life designation from the Amer

ican Institute for Electrical Engi
neers and membership in the Na
tional Academy of Sciences along
side his father, Lewis Terman.
The elder Terman, a Stanford
psychology professor and develop
er of the Stanford-Binet intelli
gence tests, applied his unique
child-rearing philosophy to young
Fred. Encouraged to roam freely
and to explore his own interests by
his parents, Terman, who was born
in Indiana, didn't enter school or
learn to read until the age of eight
and a half.
