## Hillary Clinton says she will run for Senate from N.Y. 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Promising
lo curtail her duties as lirsi lady,
Hillary Rodham Clinton ended
speculation Tuesday that she was
getting cold leet about a Senate
campaign.
" I he answer is yes. I intend to
run." she said, telling supporters she
would live in New York and only
appear in Washington "Ironi time
to time" while President hill Clin
ton finishes his term in the White
I louse.
Mrs. Clinton made the comment
after United Federation of Teach
ers President Randi Weingarten, an
ardent supporter, asked her: "So. is
it ves. or is it no?"

Several dozen teachers and
union representatives in the room at
UlT's Manhattan headquarters
hurst into cheers as Mrs. Clinton
confirmed her intention.
•"I will make a formal announce
ment after the first of the year," she
added.
Mrs. Clinton made her commit
ment to the race amid rumblings
from both critics and supporters
that her potential candidacy against
likely Republican challenger New
York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was
floundering. Her advisers said the
announcement was choreographed
to head off Democratic defections
and end speculation she was having

second thoughts about seeking the
seat.
Last week, state Democratic
Chairwoman Judith Hope politely
suggested it was time for Mrs. Clin
ton to "give up her day job." On
Saturday. City Councilwoman Ron
nie Eldridge, a Democrat, said she
thought Mrs. Clinton shouldn't run.
And on Tuesday, state Senator ('arl
Kruger of Brooklyn, also a Demo
crat, endorsed Giuliani.
Mrs. Clinton took their cue and
assured her supporters that she
would move to "my house" in
Westchester County as soon as the
Secret Service allows.
"I will still be in Washington

from time to time. I have to be." she
said. " There are many things that I
will still have to attend to. but I will
be living in Westchester and I'll be
traveling around the state and cam
paigning."
Mrs. Clinton is running for the
seat being vacated next year by
retiring Democratic Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan.
'Two-thirds of the American pub
lie approve of the job Mrs. ('linton
is doing as first lady, according to a
Gallup poll released Tuesday. More
than six out of 10 think she is quali
fied to be a U.S. senator, compared
to sevcn-out-of-l() who felt that was
six months ago. And about six out

of-10sa\ ii wold he appropriate for
her to end her duties as lirst lady
and move to New York where she
can run lull-time for the Senate.
I he telephone poll ol 1.010 peo
ple was taken Nov. 18-21 and has an
ei roi margin of plus or minus } per
centage points.
Bruce I'eitelbaum, who is run
ning (iiuliani's nascent campaign,
dismissed Mrs. ( linton s statements
luesdav as "political douhletalk. I(
was actualh a non-announcement.
Seems to me that what happened
today was an announcement about
a press conference to announce that
she intends to announce next year."
But Hank Sheinkopf. a New

York-based Democratic consultant.
s;iid Mrs. C linton's announcement
"puts New York Democrats more
at ease, squelches the rumors that
she may not go and puts more direc
tion back into her campaign."
Tuesday's event was Mrs. Clin
ton's lirst appearance in New York
since returning I'rom the Middle
Hast. The trip has been portrayed as
a political disaster by her critics
because she sat silently while Yass
er Arafat's wife accused the Israelis
of using poison gas against the
Palestinians. Mrs. Clinton later con
demned Soha Arafat's allegations
as baseless, and she defended her
conduct again Tuesday.
