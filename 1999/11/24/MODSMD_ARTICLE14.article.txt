## Editors Notebook Friendly competition 
### 
Rivalry between Stanford
and UC Berkeley should
not get out of hand

This is a reprint of a Daily editor 's arti
cle which appeared in Tuesday's Daily
California//, UC-llerkclcy's student
newspaper.
As a Stanford student, I want to
distance myself from the small
but vocal minority on this
campus who are too caught up in the
petty details of the I K '-Berkeley-Stan
ford rivalry to look at the larger picture
in the whole issue: Ibgcther the two
schools constitute one of the premier
centers of academic learning in the
United States, have many close con
tacts, share ;i common past and are
arguably the best public and private
â–  institution pair in the country.
I would like nothing more than
some friendly competition between
Berkeley and Stanford. There's no
harm in some good-natured humor at
the expense of another institution that
is a sister school.
My older brother having attended
Berkeley, I developed a certain fond
ness for the University and the city
during family trips. 1 still have that
interest in the eitv and respect for the
I Iniversity. Furthermore, with all my
close friends from high school now <il
Berkeley, if anything the connection
has been strengthened.
I lowever, I really can't stand all the
gratuitous Stanford-bashing from the
other side of the Bay. For some reason,
when Berkeley students criticize Sum
lord, it takes a mean, vitriolic and
somewhat violent angle. I know a
number of people who wouldn't feel
safe or comfortable walking around
Berkeley wearing a Stanford T-shirt.
I lie reverse is definitely not true for
this campus.
Also, witness the Daily Cal colum

nisi who made a tasteless and degrad
ing reference Id our school's mosi
famous student in a pre Big < lame eol
umn two years ago. I ;istl\. who eai

"I uck Slanfurd" I shirts worn b\ si
many students at Big (iamc? What ;
display of creativil\.
Whenever I meet someone Iron
U(-Berkele\. the conversalion seem*
to turn to Stanford's academies ani.

policies arc. Other times. I"\e heart.
Stanford described as m cxpensiu
and elitist country club that tries u
model itself on the schools of the l\\
league. Stanford sliulenls are al
greedy and money-hungry, while
Bci keley students arc siipposcdK vci \
socially conscious and anti-clilist.
< >n more than one occasion. I've
found myself defending mv decision t<

envy and resentment from llic othei
parly.
Let's face facts. As students al Iwo
of the most academically elite iini\ci si
ties in the world, evcrvone is part ol
"the system." No matter how much
they vilify lis fot the institution we
belong to, remember that Berkeley
students too, have accepted anil are
part of the social and economic elite.
Kveryonc in our positions has
adhered to the rules of the game, no
matter how much we may like to
entertain fantasies of being "revolu
tionaries." If we hadn't, we wouldn't be
here.
I'urthcrmore. let's not allow this
rivalry to gel out ol hand. I'coplc on
both sides ol the Ba\ need to grow up
and realize that tins is jiisi ,i competi
tion between two universities, not a
war. What does ii matlei if vou lose a
damn football game? Ilell. Berkelev
has been doing il I'oi li\c straight scats.
()r, for whatcvcr reason, docs ii mean
more than that to some?
