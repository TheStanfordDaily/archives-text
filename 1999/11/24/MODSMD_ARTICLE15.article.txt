Security presence mis the
price to pay Jor actions of a
few
Ol coursc it was demeaning, not being
able to celebrate our own team's victory in
Rig (iame and the glorious dream of the
Rose Howl. ()l course it was a frightening
sight to see the police fully and properly
equipped for any contingency walk into
Stanford Stadium. I had old friends from out
of state at the game, and they were shocked.
But let's talk about it factually, not with
wikl imagination and exaggeration, as letter
writers did in Monday's Daily, and get to the
real reason for it all.
'Iliere were not KM) police, but 40; it was
easy enough to count them, even from my
end /one seat. Ihe administration was not
"prepared to inflict bodily harm" on us.
There were no hand grenades.
Just remember the last few Big (iamcs.
The Tree was mangled and injured in l l >%.
At Berkeley last year, where there is no
fence, I've never seen such a frightening sight
(and I was in row 60) as that mob of ( al stu
dents that poured onto the field and overran
those poor civilians in their yellow jackets
who were formed into a line, trying to stop
them from getting close to the Stanford sec
tion. And it barely worked, but there were
fights and injuries, including that of one
police officer.
And can you remember the Cal students
breaking down the fence in Stanford Stadi
um two years ago and coming on the field?
So what are the two university presidents
to do? Censoring the band was one small
step, and as an old alum. I was saddened

but the Band did a beautiful job. didn't it?
I here's no was they can put the cops in
Iron t ol solely Ihe ( al section. Inter universi
t\ relations would be irreparably hainicd. So
the police have to he put in front ol both sin
dent sections.
Stanford students suffered, unfortunately
I can understand the frustration ol ( ;il slu
dents, with one Bit» (innic loss al'lei .1 not her.
But how sail it is that a group ot hooligans
among them wrecks the entire jovous oeea
sion for everyone else.

Daily Editorial about Big
(iame security right on target
I could not agree more with Mondav's
editorial ("All excessive displav ol torcc")
about the University's use of riot police at
Big (iame. I am utterly offended that the
University thought it was necessary to hire
mercenaries to "control" its own students at
an athletic event. I understand their need to
ensure fan safety, however their tactics to
ensure this were just plain wrong.
Instead of working with the students, the
University took an antagonistie approach,
going even so far as to threaten to take pic
tures of students rushing the field and use
them to later identify ami prosecute those
students.
We arc not animals. By treating us in this
manner, the University UH>k away from the
students'enjoyment of what is truly a historic
day in Stanford athletics and also managed to
convcv to the rest of the world cxacllv what

little respect ii has lor its student population.
I hi. University's action did work; there
were not as many skirmishes after the game
and students did not rush the field. I lowev
ei. the situation the University ereated had
lai more potential for danger to spectators at
the fame than simply allowing students to
rush the field.
Were those clubs the riot police had
merely for show? Had we rushed the field,
would tliey have been used? I low many peo
ple would have been injured by those officers
out there to protect our safety? How many
people could have been injured by pressing
up against fences that would not allow them
through? I low many people could have been
injured by tripping in the bleachers in the sta
dium while trying to push through the
lences? I lell less sale at the end of this Big
(ianu than any of the other Big Games I
haw attended. In the future I hope the Uni
versity considers its actions a little more care
fully before acting in such a ridiculous man
ner.

Thanking Jans for their sup
port
I lie Stanford Athletic Department and
the Stanford football program would like to
thank all Stanford students for their tremen
dous support not only in last Saturday's Hig
< iamc but also during the entire IW season.
It was a great team effort.
I lie Rose Bowl presents all members of
the Stanford community with an exciting

opportunity to go to Pasadena and enjoy all
the festivities. The Athletic Department is
working with the University and student
leadership to put together a package for all
students.
After the Thanksgiving holiday, it is our
hope to have this information available to
everyone. Once again, your support is truly
appreciated. We hope all Stanford students
will be in Pasadena to celebrate the New
Year and our Rose Bowl appearance.

Berkeley students might have
been right to oppose riot
police
I don't think that Stanford University
went far enough to ensure safety after the
game: putting barbed wire around the field,
giving every policeman a (ierman shepherd
and maybe putting 50,(XX) volts through the
fence would have been much more effective
in preventing students from expressing their
emotions. Keep that in mind next year!
Also, stop pointing fingers at Berkeley
students for the arrests — they reacted in an
absolutely normal way for individuals who
think that they live in a free society — seeing
police in riot gear coming toward you can
provoke nothing else but violence and hatred
toward the oppressing force. Don't forget
that "those who give up their liberty for safe
ty deserve neither liberty nor safety."
