## Corey Griffin On our way to Pasadena

The 1 02 nd Big
Game is over. It
didn't end with
the Axe floating amongst
a sea of Stanford fans and
players.
It didn't end without ( a I
students getting arrested.

Il didn't end without a huge portion of
I' >lli sitiik'iii sections being offended by
i he showcase put on by the riot police.
Il didn't even end with "All Right
N< >w."
While Ihe result is what the police
wanted no students rushed the field
after the game I hope that the Stanford
Sheriffs don't think for one second they
were successful.
(I ranted that the three Big Games
before last Saturday have shown an uglier
side of die rivalry, and one way to make
siiii no one got hurt this year was to keep
students oil the field. In retrospect, if I
hadn't been on the field at Berkeley last
\eai. I wouldn't have been hit in the face
wiili a fio/en orange.
Yes. I know having students on the
field real In isn't the problem. I've seen pie
lures from the good ol' days" with the
Axe in the midst of a huge crowd of Stan
lord t ins celebrating a Big Game win.
I here were no altercations, no shoe
throwing ("al students.
I lie problem is how people behave
once ilu \ re on the field. Unfortunately,
tin administration (which is totally out of
touch with students) couldn't have the
name of Stanford associated with another
post Biu Game fiasco even if it was the

malicious Weenies who were throwing
fruit and bottles at lis in previous Big
Games. I'hey needed to have some con
trol, and fortunately or unfortunately that
control came in the form of magnetically
locked gates, video cameras just waiting to
capture students and increased police to
keep the students off the field.
In the end. staying off the field was a
request that most students (at least the
Stanford students) didn't think was unrea
sonable. I'ven the Axe Committee was
willing to go around to house meetings to
encourage people not to rush the field for
everyone's safety and in order to celebrate
this awesome victory the. right way.
Besides, we need the football field in one
piece to kick some Notre Dame butt this
weekend.
However, the execution of this plan by
the police for lack of a better word
sucked.
Hnough has been said in multiple let
ters to The Daily about the Gestapo-like
riot police. If everyone was so concerned
that the on-field students — such as the
Band, the Tree, the yell leaders and the
Axe C ommittee — would provoke Oil
students to rush the field, why in the world
would you march in a parade of riot-gear
clad officers? If anything incited those Gal
students who got arrested, it was those
mace- and nightstick-carrying police.
I lie Band was supposed to be able to
play in the stands until 15 minutes after
the game, but the police decided — for no
reason — to end our celebration early.
I he Axe had to hide indoors because
the police felt it wasn't safe to present the

Axe to the Stanford student section at the
end of the game even though the Stanford
students stayed in the stands and were not
anywhere near rioting.
My hope is that everyone involved with
planning Big Game will see that (a) even
though the precautions taken this year
kept students off the field, the means to
this end were excessive, offensive and
should definitely not he the standard for
future Big Games and (b) maybe those
planning should show a little more trust
and work with students.
I truly believe the most successful move
by all those involved in planning Big
Game was to have students go around to
house meetings and explain why students
should stay in the stands, and not the
extraordinary amount of brute force 011
the field and in the stands.
It will be quite some time before the
Stanford Sheriffs and those who planned
Big Game will be in the good graces of the
students again, but those groups could
definitely start with an apology.
The most unfortunate thing about all of
this is that we have to dwell 011 this nega
tive aspect of Big Game when our football
team is going to Pasadena for the first time
in 2N years. I only hope the Rose Bowl
committee doesn't call out the riot police
in the third quarter.
