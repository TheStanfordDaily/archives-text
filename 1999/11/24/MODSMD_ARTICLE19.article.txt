## What's a molecular motor? 
### Katharine Miller Contributing writer 
When as a kid I learned that we are
made up of tiny cells that can be seen under
a microscope, 1 pictured cells as small blobs
that are all linked together into the great
big hulk that is a person. What was inside
these cells? Who knew?
It turns out there are motors in there —
tiny molecules that can move things where
they need to go. In a talk last week. Profes
sor of Biochemistry James Spudich
described his research into how some of
those motors work.
As a child, it certainly never occurred to
me that cells contained little "motors" to
move things within what already seems like
a pretty tiny space. Of course, on a molecu
lar scale cells are fairly large. There are no
single molecules anywhere near as big as a
cell.
So there's really lots of room in there —
too much, in fact, for all the things that
need to happen in a cell to occur without
something moving things where they need
to go.
Why Motors Matter
To the uninitiated, the title of Spudich's
recent lecture might sound like foreign lan
guage: "Single Molecule Biomechanics and
the Myosin Family of Molecular Motors."
But the name "molecular motors" really
makes a lot of sense.
For one thing, they are really important.
Without them, our hearts wouldn't beat,
our nerves wouldn't work and, more
importantly, our cells wouldn't divide. Mul
ticellular life as we know it would not exist
without the help of these mini-motors.
Spudich's talk focused on the function of

two specific motors: myosin II and myosin
V. There are actually 13 different myosins
that do very diverse things in the body.
Myosin II is in all of our muscles and in
our heart tissue. Mutations in myosin II can
lead to human hypertrophic cardiopathy —
the disease that makes athletes keel over
without notice. Their hearts just stop.
Myosin V. on the other hand, moves
pigments around and also moves the
organelles around in nerve cells. Mutations
in Myosin V cause neurological problems
and defects in pigmentation.
The One-Armed Bandit: Myosin II
The curious thing about these two
myosins is how differently they work.
Myosin II molecules are like lots of arms
waving in the air. When an arm is out
stretched, it can attach to a fiber in the cell
(an actin filament) and move it approxi
mately the length of one elbow bend (five
nanometers) before letting go.
Because each molecule can only hold on
for about two milliseconds, other molecules
have to pitch in to keep the filament mov
ing.
Spudich showed slides of fluorescent
actin filaments being moved across a plate
by myosin II molecules attached to the
plate. Little glowing worms moved smooth
ly at a rapid clip — the same velocity that
muscles move. If less myosin II is put on the
plate, the motion of the filaments stalls.
But how do the myosin II molecules
work together? During cell division, when
the myosin attaches to filaments in the cell
to pull one cell apart to make two, the
myosin forms into its own thick filaments.
These are bipolar (charged), which proba
bly helps the molecules to line up, hold
onto each other and function in a coordi

nated manner.
The Javelin Carrier Myosin V
Because Myosin V has a different job to
do. it looks and acts quite differently. It is
more like two arms waving from a stem.
Instead of letting go of its cargo, it carries it
without letting go — hut also without mov
ing itself.
Picture lifting one end of a long javelin
over your head. Using both hands and
standing still, pass the javelin overhead
from hand to hand until you reach the
other end of it.
When you get there, you can either let it
go or feed it back through your hands until
you get to the other end.
A single myosin V molecule (attached
to a slide) moves a single actin filament
back and forth in this manner.
Spudieh determined how much energy
the myosin V molecule used to move the
actin filament. It turned out to be an
extremely efficient motor, effectively using
70-87 percent of the energy supplied.
Where Did These Motors Come From?
One of Spudich's colleagues. Colleen
Murphy, has found that among different
organisms there is a certain uniformity in
the makeup of the myosins with different
functions.
That is. important portions (the so
called "surface loops") of cardiac myosin
in people look like the same portions of
cardiac myosin in other animals.
The same can be said about the other
types of myosin. This suggests that further
research could reveal how myosins
evolved to be what they are today and that
those surface loops may be a critical part of
how myosins work.


How molecular
motors work
Step 1:
A myosin protein lacking a
bound nucleotide molecule is
locked tightly onto an actin fila
ment.

A
Step 2:
When the myosin binds a
molecule of ATP, a conforma
tion change occurs, and the
myosin head is released from
the actin filament.

Step 3:
The ATP molecule is then
hydrolyzed, causing the myosin
head to slide along the actin fila
ment.

Step 4:
The hydrolyzed ADP is released,
generating energy in the form of
a power stroke. The myosin
head reattaches onto the actin
filament but has moved to a
new position along the filament.

Step 5:
At the end of the cycle, the
myosin head is again bound to
the filament.

back and forth in this manner.
Spudieh determined how much energy
the myosin V molecule used to move the
actin filament. It turned out to be an
extremely efficient motor, effectively using
70-87 percent of the energy supplied.
Where Did These Motors Come From?
One of Spudich's colleagues. Colleen
Murphy, has found that among different
organisms there is a certain uniformity in
the makeup of the myosins with different
functions.
That is. important portions (the so
called "surface loops") of cardiac myosin
in people look like the same portions of
cardiac myosin in other animals.
The same can be said about the other
types of myosin. This suggests that further
research could reveal how myosins
evolved to be what they are today and that
those surface loops may be a critical part of
how myosins work.


How molecular
motors work
Step 1:
A myosin protein lacking a
bound nucleotide molecule is
locked tightly onto an actin fila
ment.

A
Step 2:
When the myosin binds a
molecule of ATP, a conforma
tion change occurs, and the
myosin head is released from
the actin filament.

Step 3:
The ATP molecule is then
hydrolyzed, causing the myosin
head to slide along the actin fila
ment.

Step 4:
The hydrolyzed ADP is released,
generating energy in the form of
a power stroke. The myosin
head reattaches onto the actin
filament but has moved to a
new position along the filament.

Step 5:
At the end of the cycle, the
myosin head is again bound to
the filament.
