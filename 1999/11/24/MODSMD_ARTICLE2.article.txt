# Stanford's tenure history
## Professors have pushed boundaries of acceptable behavior 
### Marisa Pavlik Staff writer 
Perhaps the only desire as strong
as wanting to get into Stanford is
wanting tenure at Stanford.
Tenure is an odd institution —
corporations would consider a guar
antee of lifetime employment ludi
crous. Moreover, the subjective and
confidential process of granting
tenure periodically sparks contro
versies.
Four cases over the past hundred
years — those of professors Edward
Ross, H. Bruce Franklin, Akhil
Gupta and Karen Sawislak —
demonstrate how the contentious
process has affected Stanford's his
tory.
"It has taken on a life larger than
its own real dimensions," wrote for
mer University President Donald
Kennedy about tenure in his 1997
book "Academic Duty."
"It has become a label that em
bodies more than security and more
than simple economics. It is. in short,
so much a part of the American aca
demic fabric that it exists all by itself,
as a symbol of accomplishment and
seniority that might be needed even
il it were empty of real significance."
The Founding Grant gave the
Board of Trustees the power to "em

ploy professors and teachers at the
University." But I.eland Stanford, a
man accustomed to power, added
that the president of the University
could "remove professors and
teachers at will." This authority be
came a point of controversy soon
after Stanford made this statement.
The Ross Case
When the University was just
nine years old in 19(H). a landmark
case raised the twin issues of job se
curity and academic freedom.
Edward Ross, an economics pro
fessor at Stanford, was known for his
anti-capitalist and anti-Asian immi
grant sentiments. In one speech in
San Francisco, he advocated shoot
ing at ships filled with Japanese im
migrants.

Jane Stanford felt his anti-capi
talist views were slurs on her hus
band's achievements and detested
his racial bias, as Stanford had been
making an effort to include Asian
students in its classes.
She asked President David Starr
Jordan not to re-appoint Ross for
the next year, and Jordan reluctant
ly complied. Ross took his case to
the newspapers and framed it as an
attack on academic freedom and his
support of free coinage of silver in
the IK% presidential campaign.
In protest, six professors re
signed. Other professors handed to
gether into a formal organization, a
precursor of today's Faculty Senate.
