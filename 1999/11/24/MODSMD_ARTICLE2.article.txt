# Stanford's tenure history
## Professors have pushed boundaries of acceptable behavior 
### Marisa Pavlik Staff writer 
Perhaps the only desire as strong
as wanting to get into Stanford is
wanting tenure at Stanford.
Tenure is an odd institution —
corporations would consider a guar
antee of lifetime employment ludi
crous. Moreover, the subjective and
confidential process of granting
tenure periodically sparks contro
versies.
Four cases over the past hundred
years — those of professors Edward
Ross, H. Bruce Franklin, Akhil
Gupta and Karen Sawislak —
demonstrate how the contentious
process has affected Stanford's his
tory.
"It has taken on a life larger than
its own real dimensions," wrote for
mer University President Donald
Kennedy about tenure in his 1997
book "Academic Duty."
"It has become a label that em
bodies more than security and more
than simple economics. It is. in short,
so much a part of the American aca
demic fabric that it exists all by itself,
as a symbol of accomplishment and
seniority that might be needed even
il it were empty of real significance."
The Founding Grant gave the
Board of Trustees the power to "em

ploy professors and teachers at the
University." But I.eland Stanford, a
man accustomed to power, added
that the president of the University
could "remove professors and
teachers at will." This authority be
came a point of controversy soon
after Stanford made this statement.
The Ross Case
When the University was just
nine years old in 19(H). a landmark
case raised the twin issues of job se
curity and academic freedom.
Edward Ross, an economics pro
fessor at Stanford, was known for his
anti-capitalist and anti-Asian immi
grant sentiments. In one speech in
San Francisco, he advocated shoot
ing at ships filled with Japanese im
migrants.

Jane Stanford felt his anti-capi
talist views were slurs on her hus
band's achievements and detested
his racial bias, as Stanford had been
making an effort to include Asian
students in its classes.
She asked President David Starr
Jordan not to re-appoint Ross for
the next year, and Jordan reluctant
ly complied. Ross took his case to
the newspapers and framed it as an
attack on academic freedom and his
support of free coinage of silver in
the IK% presidential campaign.
In protest, six professors re
signed. Other professors handed to
gether into a formal organization, a
precursor of today's Faculty Senate.
The Academic Council, made up of
assistant, associate and full profes

sors. gave the faculty a consolidated
voice in I Jniversity decisions.
I he Academic Council later de
creed that their Advisory Board
must vote on faculty dismissals by
the president.
"Professors at the University, be
fore Ross, had positions that were
more precarious," History Prof.
C iordon ( hang said. "The positions
of even senior professors, like him.
could be in jeopardy."
I lie Franklin ( use
11. Bruce Franklin. I nglish pro
fessor and avowed Maoist, gave two
speeches in February to crowds
01 anti-Vietnam W;ir protesters in
White Plaza and the Computation
( entei. I le urged them to ignore po
lice orders to disperse and "use
methods ol people's war."
Altera six-week trial in late 1971.
a seven membci faculty advisory
board, chaired by Kennedy, voted 5-
2 to fire him for "urging and inciting
students and others to disrupt IJni
versity functions."
I he case tested the bounds of
academic freedom.
" I lie fundamental issue of the
Franklin case was the need for facul
ty not to engage in activities that are
disruptive of the University's core
mission." said current University
Provost John I lennessy.
Testimony ;il the trial focused on
whether a tenured professor s free
speech rights allowed him to advo
cate violence against his employer,
the University, without fear of dis
missal, according to Kennedy's hot >k
and I Jniversity press releases.

"Nobody who has my political
philosophy will be able to express
those ideas at Stanford or any other
American college campus,"
Franklin told Hie Daily in 1971. He
said the charges against him were
based on a belief that "words have
magic power to drive people crazy."
Ciregory Davis Jr., an instructor
at the College of San Mateo, wrote
in the same year that "One of the
most serious aspects of the Universi
ty's decision to fire 112 ranklin is the ef
fect this action is going to have on
other institutions, as well as the
'chilly effect' it is bound to have on
the expression of dissent by faculty
on the Stanford campus."
Davis felt that Stanford's deci
sion would influence how other uni
versities handle radical professors.
Franklin was granted tenure at
Rutgers, and the American Civil
l.iberties Union fought the Univer
sity in court into the I9<S(K over his
firing. A Santa ( lara ( ounty Superi
or Court judge ruled that Franklin
was guilty, and the California
Supreme ('ourt refused to review his
appeal. Franklin remains the only
tenured professor in Stanford's his
tory to be fired.
Public response on campus was
generally favorable toward him. In
1972 I lie Daily noted "howcommu
nistically pro-Bruce Franklin [the
campus| is."
I'lie process
Because Stanford is both a re
search and teaching university, pro
lessors need to show distinction in
scholarship and commitment to
teaching in order to gain tenure.
However, there is no hard and
fast criteria lor tenure. Furthermore,
assistant professors feel the pressure

to "publish or perish" because pub
lished books and articles in academ
ic journals carry far more weight
than teaching skills in the tenure
process.
"One does not "earn* tenure,"
University President Gerhard
( asper wrote in a Dec. 9, 1998 letter
to former I listory Asst. Prof. Sawis
lak, who was denied tenure despite
protest from her department and
her students. "Instead, the Universi
ty makes complex judgments on the
basis of which lifetime appointments
are granted or withheld. The future
quality of the University is at stake in
every appointment and promotion."
Although the procedure differs
from department to department, the
process begins when an assistant
professor finishes his or her seven
year appointment and the depart
ment votes it he or she should be rec
ommended for tenure. A senior fac
ulty promotion committee, the dean
of the school, the provost, the facul
ty Advisory Board and the Universi
ty president all pass judgement on
each case, based on recommenda
tions hv colleagues, students and ex
perts in the field. A rejection at any
level generally spells doom for a can
didate's prospects, though there are
appeal mechanisms.
I he importance of student input
has increased in recent years.
" Teaching receives more atten
tion. as does the advising and men
toring of grad students." Hennessy
said.
"It's a very difficult process, and
it doesn't always work very well,"
Chang said. "The reason is that it
comes down to subjective evalua
tion."
"There is a tendency to duplicate
the existing body of aeademia,"
( hang said. I lesaid that during peer

review, it is easier to evaluate one's
closest peers.
I le cited the Gupta and Sawislak
cases as examples of failings.
Anthropology Assoc. Prof.
Gupta, who studies gender roles in
South Asia, was deemed to be going
in a different direction than much of
the department, Gupta told The
Daily in 1997. His tenure bid was fi
nally approved by then-Provost
Condeleezza Rice.
Sawislak, who specialized in
19th-century U.S. labor history, was
denied tenure in 1997 and went
through a long grievance process in
which a faculty advisory board voted
4-2 to grant her tenure but whose
decision was overruled by Casper.
She is now attending UC-Berkc
ley's Boalt Law School, and is pursu
ing a discrimination complaint
against the University with more
than two dozen other Stanford facul
ty members through the U.S. De
partment of Labor.
Kennedy said he agrees that non
traditional research has a harder
time getting judged accurately.
"Breaking new paths is difficult," he
said, adding that the judges are those
who succeeded in the old rules.
"It's striking against human na
ture for every department to consid
er non-traditional research as com
pletely as traditional," he added.
"People who work in non-tradition
al fields simply have to expect that
the bar will be raised. It's not right,
but it's expected."
"If somebody is extremely suc
cessful in an interdisciplinary new
field, it's an easy case," Hennessy
said.
"I think that the tenure system
works well at Stanford," Kennedy
said. "If we gave it up. there would
be a challenging effect on the free

dom of faculty to proceed [on re
search] without fear of intrusion."
Kennedy said tenure does not re
inforce homogeneity, but he is wor
ried about how it protects people
who aren't performing well. As a re
form, he advocates post-tenure re
view, where results are linked to
compensation.
Stanford has adopted a standard
tenure policy, where assistant pro
fessors bid for tenure after seven
years.
In contrast, Kennedy said Har
vard has an ad-hoc committee sys
tem, where the president convenes a
committee to make the final deci
sion, taking it out of the hands of the
departments.
"I'm not sure it's any worse
I'm not sure it's any better,"
Kennedy said.
One of the most recent important
changes to the tenure policy was the
ending of mandatory retirement in
the 1980s. Before Congress made it
illegal, most professors had to retire
at age 65.
"Now we have people going past
70," Kennedy said. "It's illegal for
anyone in the U.S. to force retire
ment at a certain age — it's age dis
crimination."
The future of tenure
Current issues in tenure are the
representation of women and mi
norities. Presently, 13.3 percent of
tenured professors at Stanford are
women. Nationally, women make
up 25 percent of tenured faculty
ranks.
Hennessy said the problem of
matching the student body's diversi
ty in the faculty is due to the slow re
placement of faculty.
"We can move much faster on

students than we can on faculty." he
said. "It will take a long time" to get
equal diversity.
He also said he sees a "pipeline
problem causing the underrepresen
tative of women and minorities."
Kennedy said he finds affirma
tive action a troubling term. "It
means different things to different
people," he said. "But steps should
be taken to ensure a wide search [ol
candidates) and to enrich portals of
underrepresented minorities."
Hennessy said that the process
"works very well, in the big picture
view It provides faculty with the
long-term freedom to pursue re
search topics and scholarship with
out having to worry about continu
ity."
Tenure is "trying to address ques
tions of whether we believe if a per
son will continue to be a leader,
long-term," Hennessy said.
Stanford tenures 45 to 50 percent
of assistant professors. Some schools
give tenure to 90 percent of their ju
nior professors; some give tenure to
less than 25 percent.
Hennessy said the the process is
"constantly examined.... I don't
think there is something fundamen
tally broken."
He said he rejects the idea of af
firmative action at the promotion to
tenure level. "The basic policy is that
there is one standard for all. If we
had two, we'd be discriminating. We
couldn't support that."
Hennessy believes that Stan
ford's tenure process is better than
at other schools. "At other places,
there is a political element some
times," he said. "It's tough hut fair
here. I feel good about where we are.
In our system, we can say to every ju
nior faculty member that you have
an opportunity to get tenure."
Perhaps the only desire as strong
as wanting to get into Stanford is
wanting tenure at Stanford.
Tenure is an odd institution —
corporations would consider a guar
antee of lifetime employment ludi
crous. Moreover, the subjective and
confidential process of granting

versies.

Anthropology Assoc. Prof.

in a different direction than much of
the department, Gupta told The

nally approved by then-Provost
Condeleezza Rice.
Sawislak, who specialized in
19th-century U.S. labor history, was
denied tenure in 1997 and went
through a long grievance process in
which a faculty advisory board voted
4-2 to grant her tenure but whose
decision was overruled by Casper.
She is now attending UC-Berkc

against the University with more

Kennedy said tenure does not re

who aren't performing well. As a re

Stanford has adopted a standard

One of the most recent important
changes to the tenure policy was the
ending of mandatory retirement in
the 1980s. Before Congress made it
illegal, most professors had to retire
at age 65.
"Now we have people going past
70," Kennedy said. "It's illegal for
anyone in the U.S. to force retire
ment at a certain age — it's age dis

The future of tenure
Current issues in tenure are the
representation of women and mi
norities. Presently, 13.3 percent of
tenured professors at Stanford are
women. Nationally, women make
up 25 percent of tenured faculty
ranks.
Hennessy said the problem of
matching the student body's diversi
ty in the faculty is due to the slow re
placement of faculty.
"We can move much faster on

students than we can on faculty." he
said. "It will take a long time" to get
equal diversity.
He also said he sees a "pipeline
problem causing the underrepresen
tative of women and minorities."
Kennedy said he finds affirma
tive action a troubling term. "It
means different things to different
people," he said. "But steps should
be taken to ensure a wide search [ol
candidates) and to enrich portals of
underrepresented minorities."
Hennessy said that the process
"works very well, in the big picture
view It provides faculty with the
long-term freedom to pursue re
search topics and scholarship with
out having to worry about continu
ity."
Tenure is "trying to address ques
tions of whether we believe if a per
son will continue to be a leader,
long-term," Hennessy said.
Stanford tenures 45 to 50 percent
of assistant professors. Some schools
give tenure to 90 percent of their ju
nior professors; some give tenure to
less than 25 percent.
Hennessy said the the process is
"constantly examined.... I don't
think there is something fundamen
tally broken."
He said he rejects the idea of af
firmative action at the promotion to
tenure level. "The basic policy is that
there is one standard for all. If we
had two, we'd be discriminating. We
couldn't support that."
Hennessy believes that Stan

there is a political element some
times," he said. "It's tough hut fair
here. I feel good about where we are.
In our system, we can say to every ju

an opportunity to get tenure."
Perhaps the only desire as strong
as wanting to get into Stanford is
wanting tenure at Stanford.
Tenure is an odd institution —
corporations would consider a guar
antee of lifetime employment ludi
crous. Moreover, the subjective and
confidential process of granting
tenure periodically sparks contro
versies.
Four cases over the past hundred
years — those of professors Edward
Ross, H. Bruce Franklin, Akhil
Gupta and Karen Sawislak —
demonstrate how the contentious
process has affected Stanford's his
tory.
"It has taken on a life larger than
its own real dimensions," wrote for
mer University President Donald
Kennedy about tenure in his 1997
book "Academic Duty."
"It has become a label that em
bodies more than security and more
than simple economics. It is. in short,
so much a part of the American aca
demic fabric that it exists all by itself,
as a symbol of accomplishment and
seniority that might be needed even
il it were empty of real significance."
The Founding Grant gave the
Board of Trustees the power to "em

ploy professors and teachers at the
University." But I.eland Stanford, a
man accustomed to power, added
that the president of the University
could "remove professors and
teachers at will." This authority be
came a point of controversy soon
after Stanford made this statement.
The Ross Case
When the University was just
nine years old in 19(H). a landmark
case raised the twin issues of job se
curity and academic freedom.
Edward Ross, an economics pro
fessor at Stanford, was known for his
anti-capitalist and anti-Asian immi
grant sentiments. In one speech in
San Francisco, he advocated shoot
ing at ships filled with Japanese im
migrants.

Jane Stanford felt his anti-capi
talist views were slurs on her hus
band's achievements and detested
his racial bias, as Stanford had been
making an effort to include Asian
students in its classes.
She asked President David Starr
Jordan not to re-appoint Ross for
the next year, and Jordan reluctant
ly complied. Ross took his case to
the newspapers and framed it as an
attack on academic freedom and his
support of free coinage of silver in
the IK% presidential campaign.
In protest, six professors re
signed. Other professors handed to
gether into a formal organization, a
precursor of today's Faculty Senate.
The Academic Council, made up of
assistant, associate and full profes

sors. gave the faculty a consolidated
voice in I Jniversity decisions.
I he Academic Council later de
creed that their Advisory Board
must vote on faculty dismissals by
the president.
"Professors at the University, be
fore Ross, had positions that were
more precarious," History Prof.
C iordon ( hang said. "The positions
of even senior professors, like him.
could be in jeopardy."
I lie Franklin ( use
11. Bruce Franklin. I nglish pro
fessor and avowed Maoist, gave two
speeches in February to crowds
01 anti-Vietnam W;ir protesters in
White Plaza and the Computation
( entei. I le urged them to ignore po
lice orders to disperse and "use
methods ol people's war."
Altera six-week trial in late 1971.
a seven membci faculty advisory
board, chaired by Kennedy, voted 5-
2 to fire him for "urging and inciting
students and others to disrupt IJni
versity functions."
I he case tested the bounds of
academic freedom.
" I lie fundamental issue of the
Franklin case was the need for facul
ty not to engage in activities that are
disruptive of the University's core
mission." said current University
Provost John I lennessy.
Testimony ;il the trial focused on
whether a tenured professor s free
speech rights allowed him to advo
cate violence against his employer,
the University, without fear of dis
missal, according to Kennedy's hot >k
and I Jniversity press releases.

"Nobody who has my political
philosophy will be able to express
those ideas at Stanford or any other
American college campus,"
Franklin told Hie Daily in 1971. He
said the charges against him were
based on a belief that "words have
magic power to drive people crazy."
Ciregory Davis Jr., an instructor
at the College of San Mateo, wrote
in the same year that "One of the
most serious aspects of the Universi
ty's decision to fire 112 ranklin is the ef
fect this action is going to have on
other institutions, as well as the
'chilly effect' it is bound to have on
the expression of dissent by faculty
on the Stanford campus."
Davis felt that Stanford's deci
sion would influence how other uni
versities handle radical professors.
Franklin was granted tenure at
Rutgers, and the American Civil
l.iberties Union fought the Univer
sity in court into the I9<S(K over his
firing. A Santa ( lara ( ounty Superi
or Court judge ruled that Franklin
was guilty, and the California
Supreme ('ourt refused to review his
appeal. Franklin remains the only
tenured professor in Stanford's his
tory to be fired.
Public response on campus was
generally favorable toward him. In
1972 I lie Daily noted "howcommu
nistically pro-Bruce Franklin [the
campus| is."
I'lie process
Because Stanford is both a re
search and teaching university, pro
lessors need to show distinction in
scholarship and commitment to
teaching in order to gain tenure.
However, there is no hard and
fast criteria lor tenure. Furthermore,
assistant professors feel the pressure

to "publish or perish" because pub
lished books and articles in academ
ic journals carry far more weight
than teaching skills in the tenure
process.
"One does not "earn* tenure,"
University President Gerhard
( asper wrote in a Dec. 9, 1998 letter
to former I listory Asst. Prof. Sawis
lak, who was denied tenure despite
protest from her department and
her students. "Instead, the Universi
ty makes complex judgments on the
basis of which lifetime appointments
are granted or withheld. The future
quality of the University is at stake in
every appointment and promotion."
Although the procedure differs
from department to department, the
process begins when an assistant
professor finishes his or her seven
year appointment and the depart
ment votes it he or she should be rec
ommended for tenure. A senior fac
ulty promotion committee, the dean
of the school, the provost, the facul
ty Advisory Board and the Universi
ty president all pass judgement on
each case, based on recommenda
tions hv colleagues, students and ex
perts in the field. A rejection at any
level generally spells doom for a can
didate's prospects, though there are
appeal mechanisms.
I he importance of student input
has increased in recent years.
" Teaching receives more atten
tion. as does the advising and men
toring of grad students." Hennessy
said.
"It's a very difficult process, and
it doesn't always work very well,"
Chang said. "The reason is that it
comes down to subjective evalua

"There is a tendency to duplicate

his racial bias, as Stanford had been
making an effort to include Asian
students in its classes.
She asked President David Starr
Jordan not to re-appoint Ross for
the next year, and Jordan reluctant
ly complied. Ross took his case to
the newspapers and framed it as an
attack on academic freedom and his
support of free coinage of silver in
the IK% presidential campaign.
In protest, six professors re
signed. Other professors handed to
gether into a formal organization, a
precursor of today's Faculty Senate.
The Academic Council, made up of
assistant, associate and full profes

sors. gave the faculty a consolidated
voice in I Jniversity decisions.
I he Academic Council later de
creed that their Advisory Board
must vote on faculty dismissals by
the president.
"Professors at the University, be
fore Ross, had positions that were
more precarious," History Prof.
C iordon ( hang said. "The positions
of even senior professors, like him.
could be in jeopardy."

11. Bruce Franklin. I nglish pro
fessor and avowed Maoist, gave two
speeches in February to crowds
01 anti-Vietnam W;ir protesters in
White Plaza and the Computation
( entei. I le urged them to ignore po
lice orders to disperse and "use
methods ol people's war."
Altera six-week trial in late 1971.
a seven membci faculty advisory
board, chaired by Kennedy, voted 5-
2 to fire him for "urging and inciting
students and others to disrupt IJni
versity functions."
I he case tested the bounds of
academic freedom.
" I lie fundamental issue of the
Franklin case was the need for facul
ty not to engage in activities that are
disruptive of the University's core
mission." said current University
Provost John I lennessy.
Testimony ;il the trial focused on
whether a tenured professor s free
speech rights allowed him to advo
cate violence against his employer,
the University, without fear of dis
missal, according to Kennedy's hot >k
and I Jniversity press releases.

"Nobody who has my political
philosophy will be able to express
those ideas at Stanford or any other
American college campus,"
Franklin told Hie Daily in 1971. He
said the charges against him were
based on a belief that "words have
magic power to drive people crazy."
Ciregory Davis Jr., an instructor
at the College of San Mateo, wrote
in the same year that "One of the
most serious aspects of the Universi
ty's decision to fire 112 ranklin is the ef
fect this action is going to have on
other institutions, as well as the
'chilly effect' it is bound to have on
the expression of dissent by faculty
on the Stanford campus."
Davis felt that Stanford's deci
sion would influence how other uni
versities handle radical professors.
Franklin was granted tenure at
Rutgers, and the American Civil
l.iberties Union fought the Univer
sity in court into the I9<S(K over his
firing. A Santa ( lara ( ounty Superi
or Court judge ruled that Franklin
was guilty, and the California
Supreme ('ourt refused to review his
appeal. Franklin remains the only
tenured professor in Stanford's his
tory to be fired.
Public response on campus was
generally favorable toward him. In
1972 I lie Daily noted "howcommu
nistically pro-Bruce Franklin [the
campus| is."
I'lie process
Because Stanford is both a re
search and teaching university, pro
lessors need to show distinction in
scholarship and commitment to
teaching in order to gain tenure.
However, there is no hard and
fast criteria lor tenure. Furthermore,
assistant professors feel the pressure

to "publish or perish" because pub
lished books and articles in academ
ic journals carry far more weight
than teaching skills in the tenure
process.
"One does not "earn* tenure,"
University President Gerhard
( asper wrote in a Dec. 9, 1998 letter
to former I listory Asst. Prof. Sawis
lak, who was denied tenure despite
protest from her department and
her students. "Instead, the Universi
ty makes complex judgments on the
basis of which lifetime appointments
are granted or withheld. The future
quality of the University is at stake in
every appointment and promotion."
Although the procedure differs
from department to department, the
process begins when an assistant
professor finishes his or her seven
year appointment and the depart
ment votes it he or she should be rec
ommended for tenure. A senior fac
ulty promotion committee, the dean
of the school, the provost, the facul
ty Advisory Board and the Universi
ty president all pass judgement on
each case, based on recommenda
tions hv colleagues, students and ex
perts in the field. A rejection at any
level generally spells doom for a can
didate's prospects, though there are
appeal mechanisms.
I he importance of student input
has increased in recent years.
" Teaching receives more atten
tion. as does the advising and men
toring of grad students." Hennessy
said.
"It's a very difficult process, and
it doesn't always work very well,"
Chang said. "The reason is that it
comes down to subjective evalua
tion."
"There is a tendency to duplicate
the existing body of aeademia,"
( hang said. I lesaid that during peer

review, it is easier to evaluate one's
closest peers.
I le cited the Gupta and Sawislak
cases as examples of failings.
Anthropology Assoc. Prof.
Gupta, who studies gender roles in
South Asia, was deemed to be going
in a different direction than much of
the department, Gupta told The
Daily in 1997. His tenure bid was fi
nally approved by then-Provost
Condeleezza Rice.
Sawislak, who specialized in
19th-century U.S. labor history, was
denied tenure in 1997 and went
through a long grievance process in
which a faculty advisory board voted
4-2 to grant her tenure but whose
decision was overruled by Casper.
She is now attending UC-Berkc
ley's Boalt Law School, and is pursu
ing a discrimination complaint
against the University with more
than two dozen other Stanford facul
ty members through the U.S. De
partment of Labor.
Kennedy said he agrees that non
traditional research has a harder
time getting judged accurately.
"Breaking new paths is difficult," he
said, adding that the judges are those
who succeeded in the old rules.
"It's striking against human na
ture for every department to consid
er non-traditional research as com
pletely as traditional," he added.
"People who work in non-tradition
al fields simply have to expect that
the bar will be raised. It's not right,
but it's expected."
"If somebody is extremely suc
cessful in an interdisciplinary new
field, it's an easy case," Hennessy
said.
"I think that the tenure system
works well at Stanford," Kennedy
said. "If we gave it up. there would
be a challenging effect on the free

dom of faculty to proceed [on re
search] without fear of intrusion."
Kennedy said tenure does not re
inforce homogeneity, but he is wor
ried about how it protects people
who aren't performing well. As a re
form, he advocates post-tenure re
view, where results are linked to
compensation.
Stanford has adopted a standard
tenure policy, where assistant pro
fessors bid for tenure after seven
years.
In contrast, Kennedy said Har
vard has an ad-hoc committee sys
tem, where the president convenes a
committee to make the final deci
sion, taking it out of the hands of the
departments.
"I'm not sure it's any worse
I'm not sure it's any better,"
Kennedy said.
One of the most recent important
changes to the tenure policy was the
ending of mandatory retirement in
the 1980s. Before Congress made it
illegal, most professors had to retire
at age 65.
"Now we have people going past
70," Kennedy said. "It's illegal for
anyone in the U.S. to force retire
ment at a certain age — it's age dis
crimination."
The future of tenure
Current issues in tenure are the
representation of women and mi
norities. Presently, 13.3 percent of
tenured professors at Stanford are
women. Nationally, women make
up 25 percent of tenured faculty
ranks.
Hennessy said the problem of
matching the student body's diversi
ty in the faculty is due to the slow re
placement of faculty.
"We can move much faster on

students than we can on faculty." he
said. "It will take a long time" to get
equal diversity.
He also said he sees a "pipeline
problem causing the underrepresen
tative of women and minorities."
Kennedy said he finds affirma
tive action a troubling term. "It
means different things to different
people," he said. "But steps should
be taken to ensure a wide search [ol
candidates) and to enrich portals of
underrepresented minorities."
Hennessy said that the process
"works very well, in the big picture
view It provides faculty with the
long-term freedom to pursue re
search topics and scholarship with
out having to worry about continu
ity."
Tenure is "trying to address ques
tions of whether we believe if a per
son will continue to be a leader,
long-term," Hennessy said.
Stanford tenures 45 to 50 percent
of assistant professors. Some schools
give tenure to 90 percent of their ju
nior professors; some give tenure to
less than 25 percent.
Hennessy said the the process is
"constantly examined.... I don't
think there is something fundamen
tally broken."
He said he rejects the idea of af
firmative action at the promotion to
tenure level. "The basic policy is that
there is one standard for all. If we
had two, we'd be discriminating. We
couldn't support that."
Hennessy believes that Stan
ford's tenure process is better than
at other schools. "At other places,
there is a political element some
times," he said. "It's tough hut fair
here. I feel good about where we are.
In our system, we can say to every ju
nior faculty member that you have
an opportunity to get tenure."
