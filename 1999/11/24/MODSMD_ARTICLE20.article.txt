## New anti-inflammatory drug found to have little side effects 
### Cindy Lin Contributing writer 
Patients taking the new, heavily pre
scribed anti-inflammatory and pain reliev
ing drug celecoxih can be assured by a
recent study by Stanford researchers that
reports a low risk of dangerous gastroin
testinal side effects.
Celecoxib is a prescription alternative
to traditional non-steroidal anti-inflamma
tory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin,
ibuprofen or naproxen used to control the
pain and inflammation accompanying
rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.
Approved by the FDA last December,
more than 12 million prescriptions of cele
coxib have been issued since January,
when it was released to the market.
While NSAIDs have been used effec
tively to control the symptoms of rheuma
toid arthritis and osteoarthritis, long-term
usage of these NSAIDs has been shown to
cause severe gastrointestinal side effects.
Gurkirpal Singh, an assistant professor
of medicine in the Department of
Immunology and Rheumatology, and his
colleagues reported that patients taking
traditional NSAIDs are nearly three times
more likely to suffer from stomach bleed
ing, which can be fatal.
Approximately 16,500 NSAID-related
deaths occur each year in the U.S.
The researchers looked at FDA reports
of adverse side effects from celecoxib over
the six-month period of January through
June 1999, during which 6.5 million pre
scriptions were issued.
According to George Triadafilopoulos,
professor and Chief of Gastroenterology
at the Palo Alto Veterans Administration
Medical Center, data was compiled in
terms of "patient days" taking the drug
because the data was given in terms of the
prescription period of each patient. More
than 285 million patient days were ana
lyzed.
"The data was given in terms of X num
ber of patients using the drug for X num
ber of days." Triadafilopoulos said.
The results were compiled under the
conservative assumption that only 5 per
cent of events were reported.
According to Senior Research Assis
tant Dena Ramey, results indicated that
the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding
in celecoxib users is no higher than in peo
ple taking no drugs at all.

"The rate of adverse events found in
celecoxib users is comparable to that in the
general population," Ramey said.
"For example, ulcers can occur due to
stress even when a person is not taking
these types of medications."
While occasional usage of NSAIDs
confers only a slight risk, when they are
taken over a long period of time, they can
cause ulcers and bleeding in the stomach
lining.
Stomach bleeding occurs because
NSAIDs interfere with the synthesis of
protaglandins, chemicals that cause pain
and inflammatory response and maintain
the lining of the stomach and intestinal
tract.
Protaglandins are made by cyclooxyge
nase (cox) 1 and 2 enzymes. Cox-1 is
responsible for the synthesis of pro
taglandins in many cells, but cox-2 is con
centrated in cells responding to inflamma
tory signals that cause arthritic pain.
Traditional NSAIDs block both cox-1
and cox-2. However, celecoxib targets only
the prostaglandin synthetic pathway con
trolled by cox-2.
While the cost of celecoxib is higher
than that of over-the-counter NSAIDs. the
benefits outweigh the costs, say experts.
"Celecoxib is still cheaper than most
brand-name drugs," Singh said. "It is the
cheapest of all patent drugs and definitely
a safer drug due to the decreased inci
dence of heart burn, ulcer and stomach
bleeding."
According to Triadafilopoulos, elderly
patients are at a much higher risk of gas
trointestinal side effects, but celecoxib can
also be used to treat pain and inflamma
tion due to other causes in people at high
risk.
"Patients older than 50 arc at a high
risk, especially if they are taking steroids
or blood thinners as well," Triadafilopou
los said.
"While the bulk of the usage of the drug
is for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthri
tis, it can also be used for sprains, tendini
tis and menstrual cramps."
Using the results of the research, Singh
and colleagues developed a Standardized
Calculator of Risk Events with questions
to determine risk level for gastrointestinal
side effects. It is available online at
www.seniors.org.

subsidiary G.D. Searle and Company.
