# Alternative cancer treatments
## 
### Jane Morril Contributing writer 
The 1990s have witnessed an increase in
the number of cancer patients who seek
alternative or complementary treatments
to help cure their disease. "Alternative"
treatments include any cancer treatment or
cure that is used instead of mainstream
oncology care. "Complementary" theories,
in contrast, are used in addition to main
stream cancer treatments to target specific
symptoms and improve the overall quality
of life for cancer patients.
The rise in the use of complementary
and alternative medicines is attributed to
many factors, including increased adver
tisement through the Internet and a ten
dency for patients to want to take control of
their own health care.
"Many of the patients who seek alterna
tive medicine are those for whom tradition
al medicine has failed, for example some
one with cancer for whom there is no good
available therapy. Others seek alternatives
because they believe them to be more nat
ural," said Dr. Charlotte Jacobs, an oncolo
gist at Stanford Medical School.
Examples of complementary medicines
include meditation, reflexology, food sup

plements, vitamin supplements and home
opathy. Alternative treatments vary from
metabolic therapies, high-dose vitamins,
electromagnetic cures and many products
sold over the counter or delivered intra
venously in alternative clinics.
Patients who use either complementary
or alternative treatments tend to be female,
better educated, of higher socioeconomic
status and younger than those who do not,
according to an article published in Journal
of Clinical Oncology.
Approval of CAM is not unanimous
among mainstream doctors. Some scientists
object to the integration of CAM into
mainstream medicine, fearing it might
undermine more traditional treatments.
This disapproval has not stopped the
spread of either complementary or alterna
tive treatments. Complementary therapies
in particular are becoming more widely
accepted throughout the country. Health
insurance programs, for example, increas
ingly cover CAM services.
Information available on CAM varies
widely in its validity. For example, the
Internet, while making it much easier to
find alternative therapies, also allows pro
ponents to make any claim on a "cure" or
treatment for cancer.

"Some patients fail to realize that there
is no professional review of material on the
Internet, as there is for results published in
medical journals," Jacobs said. "My moth
er. a wonderful housewife, could offer an
alternative therapy on the Internet.
Patients should beware."
Patients should also discuss possible
complementary medicines with their doc
tors. Doctors may be able to distinguish
between helpful and harmful therapies and
can also assure that alternative treatments
do not interfere with normal cancer thera
py-
In addition, it is important to remember
that vitamins and herbs are not necessarily
gentle and harmless medicines. When
taken in large doses, vitamins can be pow
erful chemicals that can have an array of
side effects.
While no alternative treatments have
been shown to be more effective than tra
ditional therapies, some complementary
therapies, such as group theory, have been
shown to be beneficial, Jacobs said.
The most beneficial complementary
theory of all. according to Jacobs, may be
following general health regimens such
as exercise and a low-fat and high-fiber
diet.
