# Europe's largest volcano explained
## 
### Bruce Wang Editorial staff 
Mt. Etna. Europe's highest active volcano, has long perplexed
geophysicists bccause-it gushes out lava that is chemically distinct
from volcanoes caused by plate tectonics.
Recently, Stanford Geophysics Prof. Amos Nur and colleague
Zohar Gvirtzman of the Institute of Earth Sciences at Hebrew
University of Jerusalem proposed a model that explains the ori
gin of Europe's largest volcano.
Etna's lava How is caused by a process called "slab rollback."
According to their model, a portion of the Tyrrhenian plate
broke off, opening up a narrow basin of magma that is sucked up
from under the nearby African plate. This magma is what Mt.
Etna has been erupting periodically for thousands of years.
Most of the Earth's volcanoes are situated where one tecton
ic plate is sliding underneath another. As one plate slides under
another, melting occurs where the two plates converge and is
spewed out as lava through faults or cracks in the Earth's surface.
Mt. Etna, on the other hand, is located near but not on a sub
duction zone where three plates of Africa and Europe are con
verging.
Geologists believe that Sicily, where Mt. Etna is located, was
once part of Corsica and Sardinia but separated, opening up what
is now the Tyrrhenian Sea. The geological records suggests that
the opening of a basin between the plates occurred rapidly, at the

speed of several centimeters per year.
The rapid creation of such basins has long been a puzzle for
geophysicists. Nur and Gvirtzman approached the problem using
a three-dimensional mechanical model of the plates involved in
the process.
They first calculated the suspected thickness of the solid upper
mantle of the earth's crust based on the observed surface eleva
tions of the region and what they knew about the structure of the
Earth's crust and their buoyancy.
Then using their mechanical model of the three plates, they
determined that a localized disturbance could dislodge a narrow
part of the subducted plate that would sink rapidly, leaving
behind a "back-arc" basin.
According to Nur. the basin created is very narrow, which
allows for sideways How of magma from underneath. This
magma is then sucked up to the surface when the descending
plate descends into the Earth's mantle.
The lirst recorded eruptions of Mt. Etna date back to 475
8.C., when Aeschylus wrote about eruptions occurring. Its
numerous and voluminous eruptions suggest that it contains a
large underground fuel tank. The most recent eruption occurred
in 1971.
Perhaps 15 to 20 other volcanoes in the world have similar ori
gins, according to Nur. as they seem to also defy conventional
plate tectonic models. These volcanoes may be a case of "the
exception proving the rule," Nur said.
