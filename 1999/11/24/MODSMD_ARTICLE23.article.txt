## From the cheap seats Ben Jones Tragedy in Texas 
### 
Stanford celebrated one of its
greatest athletic triumphs in re
cent memory t his weekend, de
feating arch-rival C alifornia to earn
the Cardinal's first Rose Howl berth
in 28 years.
Seeing Stanford's players clutch
ing red roses amidst chants of "Rose
Bowl" from the student body was
one of those magic moments that
sports can produce like almost no
other human endeavor.

Yet in the celebration of this vic
tory. we are also reminded just how
easily the scales of emotion can he
tipped in the other direction.
Last week, the college community
as a whole and the entire nation suf
fered a tremendous loss as 12 stu
dents were killed and numerous oth
ers injured in the collapse ol the Bon
fire al Texas A&M I 'niversity.
I he tradition of the Bonfire dates
hack to l ( )() ( ). Students work
throughout the fall semester to con
struct the nearl\ (id-foot structure,
which is set ablaze the eve before the
Aggies' game against lexas the
Texan equivalent of Big (lame.
The burning Bonfire is a sight that
is intense and picturesque at the
same time a combination of tow
cring flames and an almost visible
sense of spirit and honor that Hows
from the crowd.
Students at A&M work through
out the fall semester to build the mas
sive structure, which is the center
piece of preparation for the game
against l exas. as well as one of the
focal points of a campus and commu
nity built upon tradition.
Speaking with my friends at
A&M. it is almost impossible to un
derstand and to convey the sense of
loss that the university is feeling. 1
don't think am of us at Stanford can
truly understand the magnitude of
the tragedy to have students die
while involved in an event so steeped
in honor and tradition.
I Tie collapse of the Bonfire was
onlv the crescendo of what has been

a tragic semester on the A&M cam
pus. I Earlier in the year, a plane carry
ing members of the school's skydiv
ing club crashed, killing those
aboard, and in ()ctober. a traffic acci
dent on campus claimed the lives of
six students, including one Aggie.
Stanford senior wide receiver
Troy Walters, whose father coached
at Texas A&M and who graduated
from A&M Consolidated High
School in ( ollege Station, took a mo
ment's pause from the jubilant cele
bration in the locker room to reflect
on the tragedy.
"My heart goes out to everyone at
Texas A&M," Walters said. "This
puts a damper on such a great rivalry.
"It truly is a tragedy."
I lis last statement sums up the sit
uation succinctly and eloquently.
I he events at A&M are just that,
nothing but a tragedy. Just as with a
natural disaster or other unforeseen
accident, the collapse of the Bonfire
pile occurred without warning and
resulted not from human error.
A single bright spot that has
emerged in this darkest hour is the
response from students across the
country, especially those at A&M's
bitter rival lexas.
" I he most impressive thing to me
is not the way weve pulled together
that is to be expected," said Adam
I-vans, a junior at A&M. "But the
outpouring of support and love by
everyone else especially I T."
I ric ()piela. the student body vice
president of lexas, attended a
memorial service at Reed Arena on
the A&M campus and spoke about
the unity and power of the student
community.
"Texas A&M,The T.ycsofTexas
are Upon You," Opiela said, "and
they look with sincere sympathy
upon a family that has been through
so much tragedy this semester."
The eyes not only of Texas but of
the world are on the students at
A&M. and I hope that as we cele
brate our victory here at Stanford, we
take a moment to remember those
who will no longer be able to share in
such glory.
lien Jones, a junior, sends his thoughts
midprayers to the families ami friends
<>l (ill those toadied by the tragedy in
( allege Station as well as everyone in
the Aggie family. I lie friends and fam
ily members you lost will be remem
bered with love and honor.
