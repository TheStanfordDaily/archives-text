## But first, team will tune up against Cal-State Bakersfield 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Don't mind Stanford if it looks a
little confused next week. The next
few days might be a little jarring.

Tonight Cal-State Bakersfield (1
0), a Division II power that is ar
guably the worst team on Stanford's

schedule, comes to Maples Pavilion.
Then, Saturday in Anaheim, the Car

No.Stanford (3-0) will play all year,
in the John Wooden Classic.
()ne game should be a warm up. an
opportunity for Stanford to regain its
bearings after an unimpressive win
over UC-Santa Barbara last Satur

game of national importance, one
that could even affect how Stanford is
ranked in the NCAA Tournament
come March.

preeminent name in Division 11, and

proudly so. 1 lowever, Bakersfield is
recovering from a down year. For the
first time in 12 years, the team did not
play in the NCAA Division II Tour
nament. The team did not even win
its conference, finishing fifth.
I'he real test for Stanford this
week will come against Auburn. The
Tigers, who earned a No. I seed in the
NCAA Tournament last season be
fore falling in the Sweet Sixteen, are
not hurting for athletes. But they're
also not hurting for characters, led by
head coach Cliff Ellis.
Ellis, a good old Southern coach,
loves to talk about the ostrich farm he
ran for a time. In fact, he loves to talk
about anything — especially flam
boyant senior Chris Porter — en

dearing him to Auburn's suddenly
bursting legion of fans.
Porter, a muscular 6-foot, 7-inch
forward, has a wide smile, a stylish
afro and a game to match. In his first
year at Auburn after transferring
from a Florida junior college. Porter
averaged 16 points and <5.6 rebounds
per game last season. An outstanding
leaper and ferocious dunker. Porter
was a consensus preseason All-
American.
While Porter's face always says
something, point guard Doc Robin
son usually looks like he is about to
fall asleep. But the senior from
Selma, Ala., is also an All-America
candidate. Alter scoring 11.5 points
and dishing out five assists per game,
Robinson was described by Basket
ball Weekly as "smooth and fluid,
like hot butterscotch slowly cascad
ing down a perfectly round scoop of
vanilla on a steamy southern summer
day."
Then there's junior shooting
guard Scott Pohlman, who looks as
unassuming as the little kid next
door. But Pohlman, whose shaggy
red hair and freckled face drew many
to call him Opie after Ron I loward's
character on the Andy Griffith Show,
is a gunner. Last season, Pohlman av
eraged almost 12 points per game,
shooting nearly 40 percent from
three-point territory.
Not to be overlooked, there's also
center Mamadou N'diaye. a seven
footer from Senegal by way of
Maine, and small forward Jav "The

Microwave" Heard, so-called be
cause he heats up so quickly, who will
start after being the Tigers stellar
sixth man last season.
But it's Auburn's athleticism that
should scare Stanford, not its person
alities. While Stanford has a quicker
team than ever before and has been
running the floor more often this sea
son, its ability to keep up will be test
ed early and often by Auburn.
Tin order to win. Stanford will
probably have to turn the game into a
halfcourt battle.
To allow the Jason and Jarron
Collins room inside, though, the Car
dinal will have to knock down its
perimeter shots, something it did not
do against Santa Barbara.
If the Cardinal can re-acquire its
shooting touch Saturday, Stanford
has a good chance to beat Auburn.
That may not be enough, though.
The real question might be whether
the Cardinal has the speed, the quick
ness, and the vertical leap to counter
Auburn's speed, strength and style.
Don't mind Stanford if it looks a
little confused next week. The next
few days might be a little jarring.
