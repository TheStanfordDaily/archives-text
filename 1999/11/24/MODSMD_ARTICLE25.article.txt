"We know we're going to have our hands
full on Friday," said Stanford head coach l ata
VanlXTvccr. Hut she said the team welcomes
the challenge.
Tennessee enters the 1999-2000 season with
six players with NCAA Tournament experi
ence. The Lady Vols were National Champi
ons in 19%. 1997 and IWN. The team made it to
the I lite Tight last year as well.
"I have a lot of respect for what Tennessee
has accomplished." Van Derveer said. "[And| I
think what we've accomplished is incredible."
"We're excited about our team." she said.
"We're excited about our team's improve
ment."
The Fady Vols are very athletic and very
deep, with an unusually high total of 13 on the
roster. ()ne of the nation's top recruiting class
es has joined the I ady Vols this season. All ol
the four freshman on the squad were high
school Ail-Americans. and Ireshmen guard
forward Kara Fawson and center-lorward
Owen Jackson were in double figures in the
I .adv Vols \ ictory over Tennessee-Martin.
I he Tennessee defense will be a force to be
reckoned with this season. Two veteran lady
Vols who should play important roles in this

defense. Kyra Flzy and Niya Butts, return
healthy this year after injuries last season. With
their height and quickness, the two pose seri
ous defensive threats.
Two Tennessee juniors, forward Tamika
( atchings and guard Semeka Randall, were
named Associated Press preseason All-Amer
icans. Catchings and Randall have been consis
tent scorers in the early season for the Fady
Vols. Catchings has spent her last couple of
years overshadowed by Chamique 1 loldsclaw,
1999 WNBA Rookie of the Year for the Wash
ington Mystics, but has been a consistent scor
er for the team. She will be a huge scoring
threat for the Tennessee offense and well-com
plimented by Randall on the outside.
VanDerveer said it would be important for
the Cardinal to have sophomore center Cori
Fnghusen in the game. Although prone to foul
trouble, Enghusen has the potential to be a
major scoring threat inside. She played only
eight minutes in Sunday's win over then-No. 6
lowa State and finished with four personal
fouls.
VanDerveer said sophomore forward
Bethany Donaphin and junior forward-center
Carolyn Moos will also need to be important
contributors in Friday's game. Donaphin had a
career high of 26 points on Sunday. Moos was
the Cardinal's leading scorer and rebounder,
with 16 points and 12 rebounds, in the 75-64
win over San Francisco last Friday.

openers — taking eare of the ball,
making smart decisions and getting
the ball to their teammates to score.
Flores had 19 points and nine assists
against lowa State.
"Milena and Jamie are hard to
pressure," VanDerveer said.
The l.ady Vols lost their first
game to Louisiana Tech 69-64, end
ing a 41-game winning streak at
home. Catchings was the team's
leading scorer for the game with 16
points. Randall contributed 15
points.
In the second game of the season,
fhe Lady Vols thrashed Tennessee
Martin 133-60, the most points ever
scored by a Tennessee team. Head
coach Pat Summitt played the entire
bench, and each of the 13 players on
the squad scored. The team shot 59
percent for the game and out-re

bounded its opponent 54-21.
"Tennessee will be, by far. the
best offensive rebounding team
we've played against as yet," Van-
Derveer said.
Lawson was the leading scorer
against Tennessee-Martin with 23
points. Five other Lady Vols were in
double figures. Catchings had 15
points, and Jackson added 14 more.
As a team, the Lady Vols scored 56
points off of 35 Tennessee-Martin
turnovers.
Tennessee will present a bal
anced attack to the Cardinal with
Catchings, Butts, sophomore
Michelle Snow and Jackson as scor
ing threats inside, and Lawson and
Randall putting it up on the pei ime
ter. The Tennessee defense will also
be a matter of concern for the Cardi
nal because of the Lady Vols quick
ness, which might throw Stanford
into fits.
"Tennessee has a way of making
you look bad," VanDerveer said. "It
will be an intense game."

bench, and each of the 13 players on
the squad scored. The team shot 59
percent for the game and out-re

bounded its opponent 54-21.
"Tennessee will be, by far. the
best offensive rebounding team
we've played against as yet," Van-
Derveer said.
Lawson was the leading scorer
against Tennessee-Martin with 23
points. Five other Lady Vols were in
double figures. Catchings had 15
points, and Jackson added 14 more.
As a team, the Lady Vols scored 56
points off of 35 Tennessee-Martin
turnovers.
Tennessee will present a bal
anced attack to the Cardinal with
Catchings, Butts, sophomore
Michelle Snow and Jackson as scor
ing threats inside, and Lawson and
Randall putting it up on the pei ime
ter. The Tennessee defense will also
be a matter of concern for the Cardi
nal because of the Lady Vols quick
ness, which might throw Stanford
into fits.
"Tennessee has a way of making
you look bad," VanDerveer said. "It
will be an intense game."
