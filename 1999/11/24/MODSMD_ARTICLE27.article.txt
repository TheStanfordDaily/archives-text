MEW'S WATER POLO
â–  Friday-Sunday: No. 3 Stanford at
the Mountain Pacific Federation
Tournament in Irvine. Calif.

Hut the Stanford squad won't be
the only team in Irvine with this goal.
All nine MPSF teams hope to win
this weekend's tournament and
thereby earn a spot in December s
national semifinals.
With the top nine teams in the
country making up its field, the
Mountain Pacific Tournament is the
"most competitive tournament in the
United States. It's the ultimate as far
as water polo goes." said Stanford
head coach Dante Dettamanti.
"What you've done during the sea
son doesn't matter, all nine teams
have a chance to go to the NCA As."
Stanford's road to the NCAA
Tournament will begin Friday as the
second-seeded Cardinal (W-4) takes
on No. 5 Pcpperdine (12-11). the sev

enth seed in the tournament. While
the Waves are a relatively low seed,
they cannot be overlooked. Last
year Pepperdinc was seeded fifth but
made it to the MPSF Tournament
final, falling to Stanford 11 -8 in over
time. And in IW, Pepperdinc was
the national champion.
This season, the Cardinal and the
Waves have met once, a 12-8 victory
for Stanford. Hut since that game
Pepperdinc lias turned it on. beating
then-No. 5 Long Beach Slate last
week.
The Waves are led by four potent
scorers, sophomore Cireg Lon/o (52
points on the season), juniors Sean
Hylton (33) and Peter Joseph (33)
and freshman holeman Mike llaus
mann (2.5). In order to win. Stanford
will need to focus its defensive efforts
on these four.
A win against Pepperdinc will
earn the Cardinal a Saturday semifi
nal matchup, which will likely be
against No. 1 USC (20-4). the third
seed. The two teams have faced off in
each of the last five MPSF Tourna
ments. They have played four in
tense and close games this season,
with Stanford winning three times.
Having just defeated then-No. 1
UCLA last Saturday, the Trojans
"are playing pretty well right now,"
Dettamanti said. They arc led by se
nior defender Allen Basso and senior
goalie Richard McEvoy, both of
whom have been named MPSF Play
er of (he Week twice this season.
As they enter the Tournament,
the only negative for the Trojans is
that they may be forced to play with
out their coach Jovan Vavic, who is
currently suspended for a variety of
infractions during earlier games
igainst Stanford and IJC'LA.
If the Cardinal is able to overcome
lhe Trojans, the squad will be pro
pelled into Sunday's final game,
which will likely be against No. 2
I J( I A. II Stanford wins the Tourna
ment, it will be handed an automatic
bid to the national championship.
I lowever. if Stanford simply makes it
to the final match, the squad will also
likely be given a spot in the N( 'AA's
since a second bid is given to the team

remaining with the best overall
record.
The team is unequivocally fo
cused on its national title goal. After
the recent loss to California, "it's
amazing the change in attitude this
week," Dettamanti said. "These guys
are really intense, focused and seri
ous."
The team will be led by its five se
niors: Brian Heifferon. Sean Joy,
Mike I.ipinski, Jon Skaalen and
Andv Walburger. For these seniors,
it is "their last chance to win an
N( A A championship, and these five
haven't won one vet. which is unusu
al at Stanford." Dettamanti said.
"They'll be ready to go."
The team will spend this week
preparing by working on shooting,
something the Cardinal has had trou
ble with in the last month. A particu
lar focus will be on shooting at the
end of the counterattack. The Cardi
nal hopes the extra work this week
will help the offense come away with
more counterattack goals.
