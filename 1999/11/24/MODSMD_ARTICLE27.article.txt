MEW'S WATER POLO
â–  Friday-Sunday: No. 3 Stanford at
the Mountain Pacific Federation
Tournament in Irvine. Calif.

Hut the Stanford squad won't be
the only team in Irvine with this goal.
All nine MPSF teams hope to win
this weekend's tournament and
thereby earn a spot in December s
national semifinals.
With the top nine teams in the
country making up its field, the
Mountain Pacific Tournament is the
"most competitive tournament in the
United States. It's the ultimate as far
as water polo goes." said Stanford
head coach Dante Dettamanti.
"What you've done during the sea
son doesn't matter, all nine teams
have a chance to go to the NCA As."
Stanford's road to the NCAA
Tournament will begin Friday as the
second-seeded Cardinal (W-4) takes
on No. 5 Pcpperdine (12-11). the sev

enth seed in the tournament. While
the Waves are a relatively low seed,
they cannot be overlooked. Last
year Pepperdinc was seeded fifth but
made it to the MPSF Tournament
final, falling to Stanford 11 -8 in over
time. And in IW, Pepperdinc was
the national champion.
This season, the Cardinal and the
Waves have met once, a 12-8 victory
for Stanford. Hut since that game
Pepperdinc lias turned it on. beating
then-No. 5 Long Beach Slate last
week.
The Waves are led by four potent
scorers, sophomore Cireg Lon/o (52
points on the season), juniors Sean
Hylton (33) and Peter Joseph (33)
and freshman holeman Mike llaus
mann (2.5). In order to win. Stanford
will need to focus its defensive efforts
on these four.
A win against Pepperdinc will
earn the Cardinal a Saturday semifi
nal matchup, which will likely be
against No. 1 USC (20-4). the third
seed. The two teams have faced off in
each of the last five MPSF Tourna
ments. They have played four in
tense and close games this season,
with Stanford winning three times.
Having just defeated then-No. 1
UCLA last Saturday, the Trojans
"are playing pretty well right now,"
