A group of Stanford scholars discussed the
current situation in Chechnya last night and ex
amined its potential impact on U.S.-Russian re
lations. Their discussion was called "The New
War in Chechnya."
Each panelist offered his or her views on the

crisis, attacking the topic from different angles.
Gail Lapidus, a senior fellow at the Institute
for International Studies and a courtesy profes
sor of Political Science, concentrated on the na
ture of the conflict itself, specifically the ques
tion of whether it is a war or simply a major
counter-terrorist activity, as the Russians are
calling it.

She suggested that the Russian labeling of
the campaign in Chechnya as an anti-terrorist
action is an attempt to make their actions justi
fiable to the United States.
John Dunlop, a senior fellow at the I loover
Institution, agreed that the situation in Chech
nya did not fit the definition of an anti-terrorist
act. but offered an even bleaker picture of its

real nature.
The population of Chechnya was only
350,(XJ() before the conflict began, and accord
ing to Russia only IK.(XX) people remain in the
rebel-controlled area. Dunlop sees it as not just
a war. but as an act of genocide that the Rus-
sians are attempting to justify as a re
action to attacks against them.
Andrew Kuchins, an associate di
rector at the Center for International
Security and Cooperation, took an

entirely different approach, examin
ing the effects of the war on Ameri
can relations with Russia. From his
point of view, the state of shock that
Russia is experiencing as a result of its
fall from superpower status makes
Russia more hostile to foreign at
tempts to intervene in its own prob
lems.

Commentator Thomas Simons, a
consulting professor of history and
former U.S. ambassador to Poland
and Pakistan, speculated on possible
scenarios that might result trom U.S.
intervention. He questioned the
panel on how they felt intervention
might influence the upcoming elec
tions in Russia.
