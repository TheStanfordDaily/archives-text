# $6 million and 6 years later
## University not bugged by Y2K 
### Alex Vartan 
As the hype surrounding Y2K
computer disasters reaches massive
proportions in the next few weeks,
Stanford students and faculty
shouldn't have to worry about any
disruptions to the University's
computing systems, according to
Steve Jung, management sponsor
of the Y2K Readiness Task Force
and director of Internal Audit.
That's because over the last six
years, Information Technology
Systems and Services has dedicated
scores of programmers and more
than $6 million to bring Stanford
systems up to date.
Jung said that all core system up
grades were completed and "for
ward-date tested" by the start of
Autumn quarter.
This means that Stanford stu
dents can rest easy over winter
break, knowing that billing, tuition
payments, financial aid. transcript
information and StanfordCardPlan
balances are safeguarded against
Y2K failure.
On the eve of the millennium,
most Stanford computer systems
will be up and running as usual,
with the exception of Axess, which
will be off-line for 24 hours. Com
puter and network administrators
will also be on-call to handle any
unforeseen problems.
The "Y2K. bug" refers to the
problem that occurs when comput
ers designed to record only, the last

two digits of a year are faced with
the rolling over into a new century.
Large and complicated computer
systems must be re-engineered to
accept four digits, frequently at a
very high cost.
Compared with other schools of
comparable size, however, Jung
says that Stanford's cost to upgrade
has been "relatively lower than
peer institutions."
"The core of our administration
computing systems were pro
grammed years ago in a language
developed at Stanford called
SPIRES. This language was de
signed from the start to support
four-digit dates."
"While updates still were re
quired, we didn't have to make
some of the wholesale changes
other institutions did. Our unique
SPIRES language was a significant
factor in easing the update
process," Jung said.
Though the computer and net
work systems are Y2K-compliant,
Jung stressed that the University is
taking adequate precautions
against external Y2K effects, espe
cially with regard to students trav
eling back to campus from winter
break. A comprehensive contin
gency plan is in place for students
who may be delayed in their trav
els.
"If students are forced to come
back to campus late because of any
