## Chechen speaks 
### Ani khondkaryan 
Lyoma Usmanov, the Chechen
representative to the U.S govern
ment, spoke yesterday at Terman
Auditorium concerning the recent
bombing of Chechnya by the Rus
sians.
Since Chechnya has not been
recognized as an independent
country by any other country, Us
manov is also not an official ambas
sador.
Nevertheless, he believes that
he represents the Chechen people
and the Chechen government.
Russian troops moved into
Chechnya in late September in an
effort to get rid of Chechen sepa
ratist terrorists blamed for several
bombings of apartment buildings in
Moscow and other cities. Since
then, the Russians have bombed
Chechen towns and villages.
Usmanov began by talking
about the details of the invasion,
mentioning the Russian bombings
of communication buildings,
schools and power plants.
"These have nothing to do with
[targeting] any extremists," Us
manov said.
He said 4,(XX) Chechen civilians
have been killed since October and
15().(XX) refugees have had to flee
the country to escape slaughter.
"Russia is waging a war not
against criminals but against the
civil population." Usmanov said.
He said that despite the current
situation, the Chechens have a
good relationship with the Russian
people, but not with the Russian
government.
I le then said although the West
has not condemned Russia for this
humanitarian catastrophe, it is start
ing to change its position.
"Our purpose is to survive as an
ethnic unit." IJsmanov said in con
clusion.
Alter the speech, IJsmanov
stayed to answer questions.
During the question-and-answer
pcriod, several me mbersof t he audi -
ence started yelling out comments in
opposition to the speaker's state
ments, especially those concerning
the Russian government's inten
tions.
"Passions about the issue are very
high, and they get in the way of ob
jectivity," said junior Eren Tasar
about the outbursts.
After the speech and the official
question-and-answer period, Us
manov stayed on to speak to those
who had more questions.
He mentioned the recent bomb
ings of Russian buildings, which he
said the Russian government
blamed on the Chechens and used as
a pretext for the invasion.
" I here is 110 proof that C 'hechcns
had anything to do with this," Us
manov said. "It is more likely that
they were done by people close to
the Kremlin."
1 le then said that Russian Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin's populari
ty has sharply risen in the wake of
the war.
After the presentation, several
students expressed their opinions 011
the speech and the conflict.
"The presentation meant to
spark awareness on the plight of the

Chechens," said senior Ayesha
Khan, president of the Muslim Stu
dents' Awareness Network. "It
needs to be brought to the attention
of the campus."
"Usmanov clearly staked out the
plight of the Chechens and clarified

the government's stance on the inva
sion." said junior Murad Akhter.
"It was very interesting to get the
position of someone from the area
about the whole situation. There
aren't many Chechens in the United
States," said Tasar.
