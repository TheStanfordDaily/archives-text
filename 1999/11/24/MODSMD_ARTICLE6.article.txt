### Ani khondkaryan 
Lyoma Usmanov, the Chechen
representative to the U.S govern
ment, spoke yesterday at Terman
Auditorium concerning the recent
bombing of Chechnya by the Rus
sians.
Since Chechnya has not been
recognized as an independent
country by any other country, Us
manov is also not an official ambas
sador.
Nevertheless, he believes that
he represents the Chechen people
and the Chechen government.
Russian troops moved into
Chechnya in late September in an
effort to get rid of Chechen sepa
ratist terrorists blamed for several
bombings of apartment buildings in
Moscow and other cities. Since
then, the Russians have bombed
Chechen towns and villages.
Usmanov began by talking
about the details of the invasion,
mentioning the Russian bombings
of communication buildings,
schools and power plants.
"These have nothing to do with
[targeting] any extremists," Us
manov said.
He said 4,(XX) Chechen civilians
have been killed since October and
15().(XX) refugees have had to flee
the country to escape slaughter.
"Russia is waging a war not
against criminals but against the
civil population." Usmanov said.
He said that despite the current
situation, the Chechens have a
good relationship with the Russian
