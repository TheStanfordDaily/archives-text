sky, a former colleague of Craig's.

tory Prof. Carolyn Lougee-Chap
pell, chair of the History Depart
ment. According to Sheehan, the
department saw the coincidence of
( 'raig's birthday and the publishing
of his work as a good opportunity
to honor the noted historian.

many years at Stanford and of his
quite extraordinary record as a
scholar and increasingly as a public
intellectual," Sheehan said in a
press release.
Sheehan's presentation cele
brated Craig's career at Princeton,
where Craig taught for 11 years
after receiving his undergraduate
and doctorate degrees.
" There were, in those first years
(of teaching), other moments of
mutual incomprehension between
my students and me," ('raig said in
a press release.
"Sometimes after a lecture, I
found myself thinking of a remark
made by Sir Walter Raleigh,... I
rather think that when I come
nearest pleasing myself my class re
gards me as a kind of monster.... I
might just as well he set to feed
hedgehogs with cheesecakes.' I
imagine that we have all felt that
way at one time or another." he
said.
Craig later received two hon
orary degrees in history from
Princeton. Before he began teach
ing, however, Craig spent two
years as a Rhodes Scholar at Ox
ford University, where Sheehan
