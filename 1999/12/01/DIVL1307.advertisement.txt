In the philosophical tradition of George
Orwell and Isaiah Berlin, Robert Conquest
presents a brilliant work of history and
meditation, one that examines the political
ideologies that have corrupted the twentieth
century and, in the process, sent millions to
the slaughterhouse. The main responsibility
for our century's cataclysms, Conquest
maintains, lies not in impersonal economic
or social forces-like revolutionary Marxism
or German National Socialism--but in the
distortions that polluted human minds with
the detritus of absolutist ideas. Conquest
finds the failure to understand these
phenomena as epidemic in Western civic
culture, which has so far--barely—prevailed.
Whether discussing Kierkegaard or Koestler
or the disasters posed by the new European
Economic Union, Conquest has a remarkable
ability to fuse literature and history,
philosophy and prognostication, and
presents here a grand synthesis of our
century, seen through its most deeply
flawed ideologies. Robert Conquest is
currently Senior Research Fellow at the
Hoover Institution at Stanford University.
His other books include The Great Terror
and The Harvest of Sorrow.
