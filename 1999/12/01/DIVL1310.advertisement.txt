Stanford isn't one of the top universities for noth
ing. To stay ahead of the competition, you're
going to have to plan out the most effective and
efficient way to get that important information
off the printed page?.
Consider the C-Pen 200. It's shaped like a pen,
hut it does something that no other pen can do.
It can read. I low/ It's a powerful computer with
a 2Mh memory that accurately copies printed
text, translates it into a computer format, and
transfers it to your PC. So you can note down
that sonnet, theory, or philosophical argument in
a fraction of a second.
Weighing less than six ounces, it's capable of
scanning text at 100 characters per second and
storing up to 100 pages. It even has an address
hook feature. Despite being the most advanced
pen on the planet, it's also intuitively simple to
use. The New York Times declared that the C-
Pen "works like a digital variation on the popular
yellow highlighter."
So why take notes when you can take the C-Pen
with you instead? Use it at the library, the lecture
hall, or at your desk when you're pulling an all
nighter.
Fora small investmenf of just $199,
you'll never be at a loss for words.
