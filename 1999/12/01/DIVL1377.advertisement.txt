ing. Lose the notes. Open
a vein. Sound familiar? Try X:Drive. The world's first
free Internet hard drive on the desktop. It delivers any
where, anytime access from any Web ready computer.
Wouldn't it be easier if everyone had access to the
same files, notes, and timetables—no matter where
they are on campus? No more running around, missed
meetings, or jive excuses. And whenever someone
adds to a file, you can track the updates on the Web.
Plus X: Drive gives you 25 megs of space free
(that's about the same as the 17 virus-infected floppies
you won't have to schlep around anymore.) Which
means you'll have plenty of room to stash all your per
sonal stuff. MP3s, video, groovy pics. The works.
(Relax. Private files are password-protected, even if
you're mooching off your roommate's computer.)

best freebie on the Web.
