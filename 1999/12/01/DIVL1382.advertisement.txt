Graduate Program in
Molecular
and Medical
Pharmacology
niversity of California, Los Angeles
The graduate program in the Department of Molecular and Medical
Pharmacology, UCLA School of Medicine is seeking outstanding students
who are interested in pursuing a Ph.D. degree and research training in
integrative biology and molecular medicine. Our faculty specializes in
areas as diverse as genomics, molecular basis of disease, signal trans
duction, neurobiology, virology, biological imaging, immunotherapy, and
gene therapy. A primary mission of our Department is to bring gifted stu
dents, scientists, and physicians together to understand the life-sustain
ing biological mechanisms that regulate the functions of the body, the
molecular errors that lead to disease, and to explore the pharmacological
means to correct them. In this regard, the Department has numerous
transgenic, chimeric, and human cell transplant mouse models of disease,
corresponding to human diseases studied in our clinical research program.
The Department is visionary and places equal emphasis on hypothesis
and technology-driven research.
The Department's recent scientific accomplishments were recognized by
the Nobel Prize in Medicine to Dr. Louis J. Ignarro for his pioneering work
on nitric oxide, and the Enrico Fermi Presidential Award to our
Department Chair, Dr. Michael E. Phelps, for his invention and develop
ment of positron emission tomography. Both Drs. Ignarro and Phelps are
members of the National Academy of Sciences. In addition, the
Department is a world-leader in biological imaging and is the home
department for the Crump Institute for Biological Imaging, the Laboratory
of Structural Biology and Molecular Medicine, and the Ahmanson Biological
Imaging Clinic.
Candidates must possess a B.S. or B.A. degree in a relevant field. Women
and minorities are strongly encouraged to apply. For additional informa
tion on application and research opportunities, please visit our website at:
