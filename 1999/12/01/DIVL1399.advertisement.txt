THIS YEAR A LOT OF COLLEGE
SENIORS WILL BE GRADUATING
INTO DEBT.
Under the Army's Loan Repayment program, you
could get out from under with a three-year enlistment.
Each year you serve on active duty reduces your
indebtedness by one-third or $1,500, whichever
amount is greater, up to a $65,000 limit.
The offer applies to Perkins Loans, Stafford Loans,
and certain other federally insured loans, which are not
in default.
And debt relief is just one of the many benefits
you'll earn from the Army. Ask your Army Recruiter.
