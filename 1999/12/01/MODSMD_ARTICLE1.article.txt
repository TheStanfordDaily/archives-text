earthquakes of l l HX) and IVS9 were
two of tin' most significant occur
rences in ilie /nisi century of Stanford
history, liotli disasters resulted in
physical damage, decades of rebuild
ing and eniotii >nal trauma.
Stanford as an institution was
forced to fin e llie concept that it could
not always prepare for every eventual
ity, and that tragedy, in earthquake
country, could occur at any time. I lie
l l M>6 iiml l ( >W earthquakes both
make up ///<â–  top story of the century,
because tlii ir lingering effects on the
Universu , i's people and the commu
nity are felt to this day.

Stanford University has weath
ered its share of disasters since its

founding in 1891.
In its relatively short history, the
IJniversity has faced prospects for fi
nnncial ruin in the early years, tenure
controversies and the occasional
scandal.
Still, nothing in the past IOS years
has threatened the physical founda
tion and visionary mission of the Uni
versity like the devastating 1906
earthquake and the 1989 Loma Pri
eta earthquake.
Ihe 1 1 )( >(i disaster occurred during
the "second Stone Age." a period
when Stanford was just beginning to
overcome financial and legal difficul
ties and to expand its educational op
portunities. The timing of the quake
sorely tested the collective faith stu
dents and faculty had placed in the
I Jniversity.
