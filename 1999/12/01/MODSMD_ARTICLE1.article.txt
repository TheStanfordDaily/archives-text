Stanford University has weath
ered its share of disasters since its

founding in 1891.
In its relatively short history, the
IJniversity has faced prospects for fi
nnncial ruin in the early years, tenure
controversies and the occasional
scandal.
Still, nothing in the past IOS years
has threatened the physical founda
tion and visionary mission of the Uni
versity like the devastating 1906
earthquake and the 1989 Loma Pri
eta earthquake.
Ihe 1 1 )( >(i disaster occurred during
the "second Stone Age." a period
when Stanford was just beginning to
overcome financial and legal difficul
ties and to expand its educational op
portunities. The timing of the quake
sorely tested the collective faith stu
dents and faculty had placed in the
I Jniversity.

The Loma Prieta earthquake di
rectly affected fewer members of the
University, and the reconstruction
period spanned 10 years. Though this
4 time Stanford was no longer an "edu
cational experiment" but an estab
lished. prestigious institution, the
quake reinforced the already proven
resiliency of the University through
natural and manmade disaster alike.
University Archivist Maggie Kim
ball said that as a result of the earth
quakes, this University has become
used to dealing with crises.
"It is the lesson of earthquake and
fire that man cannot be shaken and
cannot be burned," University Presi
dent David Starr Jordan wrote in
1906. "The houses he builds are hous
es of cards, but he stands outside of
them and can build again."
The 1906 earthquake
Bv all accounts, the l c )(>6 class en

lured Stanford under auspicious cir
cumstances. For the first time, stu
dents were reliev ed of financial prob
lems earlier classes had experienced.
The estate left by the late Leland
Stanford was out of the courts, litiga
tion by the U.S. government threat
ening to close the University was set
tled and according to English Prof.
Edith Mirrilees. Economics Prof. Ed
ward Ross was a forgotten name.
In "Stanford, the Story of a Uni
versity." Mirrilees wrote that in IWi.
"prosperity was in full view."
This optimism, however, all
changed in a matter ol seconds. Sud
denly. at 5:12 a.m. on April IS. the
earthquake of 1906 ruptured the at
mosphere of peace anil stability that
the founders, students and faculty of
the University had worked so hard to
achieve.
The lirst great shock measured an
impressive N.25 magnitude and lasted
47 seconds, according to Orrin Elliot,
University registrar.
Jordan, like almost all Bay Area
residents, was awakened by the
quake.

He wrote in his 1921 autobiogra
phy. "In less than a minute the solid
earth between us and the mountains
had been torn open to a depth of no
one knows how many miles and then
clapped together again as if nothing
had happened!"
1 4 XW>: Student reaction
Student reaction to the disaster
ranged from sadness to shock, with
most feeling lucky just to be alive.
"The two chimneys had both fall
en crashing through the roof, but not
touching the four girls directly under
neath." one girl wrote, as quoted in
Elliot's book "Stanford University:
the First Twenty-Five Years."
Another co-ed wrote: "All the
doors in the house were jammed in
such a manner that we were unable to
leave our rooms until the disturbance
ceased!"
Despite the shock of waking up to
an earthquake, many believe the lim
ing of the quake to be a stroke of good
luck.
"1 lad the shock occurred later in

the day. when classes were in session,
the loss of life would undoubtedly
have been large." wrote Elliot.
As it was. two men were killed by
falling chimneys. Otto C icicles, a fire
man. was killed in the powerhouse,
and Junius R. I lanna. a student from
Pennsylvania, w as crushed to deal h in
Encina I fall, then an all-male dormi
tory housing about 3(H) students.
After the rescue of the men in
Encina, Jordan spoke to the crowd
amassed in front of the building.
"The doors of this institution shall
never close." Jordan reportedly said.
I lowever, as the campus itself sus
tained heavy damage, many doors
did fall down.
Jordan wrote: "where the [Memo
rial] Arch had stood lay huge heaps of
jagged rock, the [Memorial) Church
was a sickening ruin, the ()uter (Quad
rangle a depressing sight with tipsy
walls and a fringe of rubble, the site of
the new Library and Gymnasium a
desolation of brick and stone, the ex
tensive additions to the Museum an
apparently hopeless wreck!"
For some, the damage to the quad

rangle w as heartbreaking.
"Oh. you cannot imagine the
quadrangle as it looks to-day; it is the
saddest sight 1 ever saw." wrote one
female student toiler parents. "Some
of the people were simph sobbing
this morning when the\ saw the grand
old quad in perfect ruins."
Other students were thankful for
their good luck.
A student wrote to las family: "
I )earest hoiks: Strange to sa\ I m still
alive! We are hoping for the best and
are really quite cheerful. 1 can t tell
sou how perfect!) miraculous it is that
we are alive," as quoted in 1 lliot's
book.
Incitement and subdued hysteria
often found their vent in humor.
"It is terrible, but everyone is jok
ing or fooling about it. which relieves
the atmosphere somewhat," wrote
the student upset about damage to
the Ouad.
After the earthquake hurled a
statue of zoologist I .ouis Agassi/ into
the pavement, a Stanford faculty
member remarked that "Agassi/, was
meat in the abstract but not in the

concrete."
Response and reconstruction

known as the l);nlv t'alo Alto, three

which are invincible," wrote Kather

Disaster strikes again in 1989
A cousin of the 1906 earthquake,
formed along the San Andreas Fault.
' truck the Bay Area in 1989
At 5:04 p.m. on Oct. 17, 1989, the
Loma Prieta earthquake stopped
Stanford's Clock Tower and moved
everything else on campus. The initial
shock measuring 7.1 on the Riehter
scale was followed by four major af
tershocks. all measuring over 4.0 on
the Riehter scale.
Falling chimneys claimed two
lives in 1906, and. according to the
Stanford Daily, a Phi Psi student
studying on the first floor deck avoid
ed the same fate in 1989 by moving
away in time.
Faculty members remembered
similar close calls.
"I literally just got out of the Old
Library [the recently re-opened Bing
Wing of (ireenj where I'd taught a

seminar, which was scheduled to end
at 5:05," History Prof. Joseph Corn
recalled. "A librarian had been talk
ing to my students and finished a bit
early, so we all left about 4:55 or so. 1
had just gotten out of the buildingand
was talking to a student on the grass
in front when, all of a sudden, she and
I were on our hands and knees, face
to-face like dogs, for we'd been
thrown to the ground."
Vice Provost John Bravman said
he remembers a miracle.
When the quake hit. Bravman
"ran downstairs, out the door, and
right behind me, as I ran out, a roof
tile tell and smashed on the ground. I
think I had an angel looking after me
at that moment."
In contrast to the 1906 earth
quake, there were only 30 minor in
juries and no major utility disruption,
according to the Stanford News Ser
vice.
Still, more than 200 campus build
ings were damaged, about two do/en
so badly that they had to be shut
down immediately.
Campus historical buildings, in

cluding Memorial Church, parts of
the Quad. Green Library Wesi and
the Museum, were hardest hit.
Tempered reactions
Unlike the 1906 earthquake,
which closed down the University for
the remainder of the school year,
classes were canceled for only one
day in 1989. Campus reaction to this
disaster was more about sentiment
than subdued hysteria.
History Prof. Albert Camarillo
said he reacted most strongly to the
damage in Memorial Church and
Green Library.
"They were some of the greatest
architectural gems on campus, and I
had spent so much time in Green
over the years." Camarillo said.
In contrast to Bittncr's entreaties
in 1906, this time the Stanford com
munity reacted with tempered con
cern and implicit faith in the Univer
sity.
"Many, including myself, felt anx
ieties for months afterwards. But my
sense was that students rolled with
the catastrophe, no pun intended.

and that no major impact was evi
dent." Corn said.
Then-University President Don
ald Kennedy said the impact of the
disaster on University buildings and
finances were solved with some ad
ministrative inconvenience.
"If there had been loss of life, it
would have been terrible; it was just a
matter of creating plans to deal with
considerable inconvenience and ne
gotiating with the government."
Kennedy said.
Reconstruction and new awareness
Like the IWS earthquake, the ef
fects of Loma Prieta were felt for
years to come.
Reconstruction on damaged
buildings began five years later in
IW4 when the 112 ederal Emergency
Management Agency agreed to pay
$50 million of the University's repair
costs, according to Stanford News.
Another $N 1 ).7 million came from
Stanford donors, including hundreds
who responded to a Stanford
Restoration 112 und campaign started
in 1994.

Cantor Arts Center, opened last
year, and the newly completed Bing
Wing of Green Library both benelit
ed from reconstruction. And of the
117 Stanford buildings thought to
pose a risk to lives at the time of the
quake, all but six have been fortified,
and work has been scheduled lor
most of the others, wrote Stanford
News.
Since the mid 19905, the Universi
ty has promoted awareness of earth
quake safety. Housing and Dining
Services now give a copy of "Be
Quake Safe' at Stanford" to each
student. Dorms routinely perform
earthquake drills, and according to
Stanford News, now enough food,
water and emergency items are
stored on campus to take care of
I0.(XX) students for three days.
Kennedy said. "We got a better
physical plant than we had before."
Kennedy said of reconstruction. "It
was hard to perceive it at the time, but
our success in dealing with FEMA
and success in fundraising have really
produced some great improvements
in this place."

In "Stanford, the Story of a Uni

"prosperity was in full view."
This optimism, however, all
changed in a matter ol seconds. Sud

earthquake of 1906 ruptured the at

the founders, students and faculty of
the University had worked so hard to
achieve.
The lirst great shock measured an
impressive N.25 magnitude and lasted
47 seconds, according to Orrin Elliot,
University registrar.
Jordan, like almost all Bay Area
residents, was awakened by the
quake.

He wrote in his 1921 autobiogra
phy. "In less than a minute the solid
earth between us and the mountains
had been torn open to a depth of no
one knows how many miles and then
clapped together again as if nothing
had happened!"
1 4 XW>: Student reaction
Student reaction to the disaster
ranged from sadness to shock, with
most feeling lucky just to be alive.
"The two chimneys had both fall
en crashing through the roof, but not
touching the four girls directly under
neath." one girl wrote, as quoted in
Elliot's book "Stanford University:
the First Twenty-Five Years."
Another co-ed wrote: "All the
doors in the house were jammed in
such a manner that we were unable to
leave our rooms until the disturbance
ceased!"
Despite the shock of waking up to
an earthquake, many believe the lim
ing of the quake to be a stroke of good
luck.
"1 lad the shock occurred later in

the day. when classes were in session,
the loss of life would undoubtedly
have been large." wrote Elliot.
As it was. two men were killed by
falling chimneys. Otto C icicles, a fire
man. was killed in the powerhouse,
and Junius R. I lanna. a student from
Pennsylvania, w as crushed to deal h in
Encina I fall, then an all-male dormi
tory housing about 3(H) students.
After the rescue of the men in
Encina, Jordan spoke to the crowd
amassed in front of the building.
"The doors of this institution shall
never close." Jordan reportedly said.
I lowever, as the campus itself sus
tained heavy damage, many doors
did fall down.
Jordan wrote: "where the [Memo
rial] Arch had stood lay huge heaps of
jagged rock, the [Memorial) Church
was a sickening ruin, the ()uter (Quad
rangle a depressing sight with tipsy
walls and a fringe of rubble, the site of
the new Library and Gymnasium a
desolation of brick and stone, the ex
tensive additions to the Museum an
apparently hopeless wreck!"
For some, the damage to the quad

rangle w as heartbreaking.
"Oh. you cannot imagine the
quadrangle as it looks to-day; it is the
saddest sight 1 ever saw." wrote one
female student toiler parents. "Some

Disaster strikes again in 1989
A cousin of the 1906 earthquake,
formed along the San Andreas Fault.
' truck the Bay Area in 1989
At 5:04 p.m. on Oct. 17, 1989, the
Loma Prieta earthquake stopped
Stanford's Clock Tower and moved
everything else on campus. The initial
shock measuring 7.1 on the Riehter
scale was followed by four major af
tershocks. all measuring over 4.0 on
the Riehter scale.
Falling chimneys claimed two
lives in 1906, and. according to the
Stanford Daily, a Phi Psi student
studying on the first floor deck avoid
ed the same fate in 1989 by moving
away in time.
Faculty members remembered
similar close calls.
"I literally just got out of the Old
Library [the recently re-opened Bing
Wing of (ireenj where I'd taught a

seminar, which was scheduled to end
at 5:05," History Prof. Joseph Corn
recalled. "A librarian had been talk
ing to my students and finished a bit
early, so we all left about 4:55 or so. 1
had just gotten out of the buildingand
was talking to a student on the grass
in front when, all of a sudden, she and
I were on our hands and knees, face
to-face like dogs, for we'd been
thrown to the ground."
Vice Provost John Bravman said
he remembers a miracle.
When the quake hit. Bravman
"ran downstairs, out the door, and
right behind me, as I ran out, a roof
tile tell and smashed on the ground. I
think I had an angel looking after me
at that moment."
In contrast to the 1906 earth
quake, there were only 30 minor in
juries and no major utility disruption,
according to the Stanford News Ser
vice.
Still, more than 200 campus build
ings were damaged, about two do/en
so badly that they had to be shut
down immediately.
Campus historical buildings, in

cluding Memorial Church, parts of
the Quad. Green Library Wesi and
the Museum, were hardest hit.
Tempered reactions
Unlike the 1906 earthquake,
which closed down the University for
the remainder of the school year,
classes were canceled for only one
day in 1989. Campus reaction to this
disaster was more about sentiment
than subdued hysteria.
History Prof. Albert Camarillo
said he reacted most strongly to the
damage in Memorial Church and
Green Library.
"They were some of the greatest
architectural gems on campus, and I
had spent so much time in Green
over the years." Camarillo said.
In contrast to Bittncr's entreaties
in 1906, this time the Stanford com
munity reacted with tempered con
cern and implicit faith in the Univer
sity.
"Many, including myself, felt anx
ieties for months afterwards. But my
sense was that students rolled with
the catastrophe, no pun intended.

and that no major impact was evi
dent." Corn said.
Then-University President Don
ald Kennedy said the impact of the
disaster on University buildings and
finances were solved with some ad
ministrative inconvenience.
"If there had been loss of life, it
would have been terrible; it was just a
matter of creating plans to deal with
considerable inconvenience and ne
gotiating with the government."
Kennedy said.
Reconstruction and new awareness
Like the IWS earthquake, the ef
fects of Loma Prieta were felt for
years to come.
Reconstruction on damaged
buildings began five years later in
IW4 when the 112 ederal Emergency
Management Agency agreed to pay
$50 million of the University's repair
costs, according to Stanford News.
Another $N 1 ).7 million came from
Stanford donors, including hundreds
who responded to a Stanford
Restoration 112 und campaign started
in 1994.

Cantor Arts Center, opened last
year, and the newly completed Bing
Wing of Green Library both benelit
ed from reconstruction. And of the
117 Stanford buildings thought to
pose a risk to lives at the time of the
quake, all but six have been fortified,
and work has been scheduled lor
most of the others, wrote Stanford
News.
Since the mid 19905, the Universi
ty has promoted awareness of earth
quake safety. Housing and Dining
Services now give a copy of "Be
Quake Safe' at Stanford" to each
student. Dorms routinely perform
earthquake drills, and according to
Stanford News, now enough food,
water and emergency items are
stored on campus to take care of
I0.(XX) students for three days.
Kennedy said. "We got a better
physical plant than we had before."
Kennedy said of reconstruction. "It
was hard to perceive it at the time, but
our success in dealing with FEMA
and success in fundraising have really
produced some great improvements
in this place."

Stanford University has weath

In its relatively short history, the
IJniversity has faced prospects for fi

controversies and the occasional
scandal.
Still, nothing in the past IOS years

Ihe 1 1 )( >(i disaster occurred during

when Stanford was just beginning to

sorely tested the collective faith stu

The Loma Prieta earthquake di

period spanned 10 years. Though this

natural and manmade disaster alike.
University Archivist Maggie Kim

"It is the lesson of earthquake and

Disaster strikes again in 1989
A cousin of the 1906 earthquake,
formed along the San Andreas Fault.
' truck the Bay Area in 1989
At 5:04 p.m. on Oct. 17, 1989, the
Loma Prieta earthquake stopped
Stanford's Clock Tower and moved
everything else on campus. The initial
shock measuring 7.1 on the Riehter
scale was followed by four major af
tershocks. all measuring over 4.0 on
the Riehter scale.
Falling chimneys claimed two
lives in 1906, and. according to the
Stanford Daily, a Phi Psi student
studying on the first floor deck avoid
ed the same fate in 1989 by moving
away in time.
Faculty members remembered
similar close calls.
"I literally just got out of the Old
Library [the recently re-opened Bing
Wing of (ireenj where I'd taught a

seminar, which was scheduled to end
at 5:05," History Prof. Joseph Corn
recalled. "A librarian had been talk
ing to my students and finished a bit
early, so we all left about 4:55 or so. 1
had just gotten out of the buildingand
was talking to a student on the grass
in front when, all of a sudden, she and
I were on our hands and knees, face
to-face like dogs, for we'd been
thrown to the ground."
Vice Provost John Bravman said
he remembers a miracle.
When the quake hit. Bravman
"ran downstairs, out the door, and
right behind me, as I ran out, a roof
tile tell and smashed on the ground. I
think I had an angel looking after me
at that moment."
In contrast to the 1906 earth
quake, there were only 30 minor in
juries and no major utility disruption,
according to the Stanford News Ser
vice.
Still, more than 200 campus build
ings were damaged, about two do/en
so badly that they had to be shut
down immediately.
Campus historical buildings, in

cluding Memorial Church, parts of
the Quad. Green Library Wesi and
the Museum, were hardest hit.
Tempered reactions
Unlike the 1906 earthquake,
which closed down the University for
the remainder of the school year,
classes were canceled for only one
day in 1989. Campus reaction to this
disaster was more about sentiment
than subdued hysteria.
History Prof. Albert Camarillo
said he reacted most strongly to the
damage in Memorial Church and
Green Library.
"They were some of the greatest
architectural gems on campus, and I
had spent so much time in Green
over the years." Camarillo said.
In contrast to Bittncr's entreaties
in 1906, this time the Stanford com
munity reacted with tempered con
cern and implicit faith in the Univer
sity.
"Many, including myself, felt anx
ieties for months afterwards. But my
sense was that students rolled with
the catastrophe, no pun intended.

and that no major impact was evi
dent." Corn said.
Then-University President Don
ald Kennedy said the impact of the
disaster on University buildings and
finances were solved with some ad
ministrative inconvenience.
"If there had been loss of life, it
would have been terrible; it was just a
matter of creating plans to deal with
considerable inconvenience and ne
gotiating with the government."
Kennedy said.
Reconstruction and new awareness
Like the IWS earthquake, the ef
fects of Loma Prieta were felt for
years to come.
Reconstruction on damaged
buildings began five years later in
IW4 when the 112 ederal Emergency
Management Agency agreed to pay
$50 million of the University's repair
costs, according to Stanford News.
Another $N 1 ).7 million came from
Stanford donors, including hundreds
who responded to a Stanford
Restoration 112 und campaign started
in 1994.

Cantor Arts Center, opened last
year, and the newly completed Bing
Wing of Green Library both benelit
ed from reconstruction. And of the
117 Stanford buildings thought to
pose a risk to lives at the time of the
quake, all but six have been fortified,
and work has been scheduled lor
most of the others, wrote Stanford
News.
Since the mid 19905, the Universi
ty has promoted awareness of earth
quake safety. Housing and Dining
Services now give a copy of "Be
Quake Safe' at Stanford" to each
student. Dorms routinely perform
earthquake drills, and according to
Stanford News, now enough food,
water and emergency items are
stored on campus to take care of
I0.(XX) students for three days.
Kennedy said. "We got a better
physical plant than we had before."
Kennedy said of reconstruction. "It
was hard to perceive it at the time, but
our success in dealing with FEMA
and success in fundraising have really
produced some great improvements
in this place."
Editor's Note: I lie Hay Area
earthquakes of l l HX) and IVS9 were
two of tin' most significant occur
rences in ilie /nisi century of Stanford
history, liotli disasters resulted in
physical damage, decades of rebuild
ing and eniotii >nal trauma.
Stanford as an institution was
forced to fin e llie concept that it could
not always prepare for every eventual
ity, and that tragedy, in earthquake
country, could occur at any time. I lie
l l M>6 iiml l ( >W earthquakes both
make up ///<■ top story of the century,
because tlii ir lingering effects on the
Universu , i's people and the commu
nity are felt to this day.

Stanford University has weath
ered its share of disasters since its

founding in 1891.
In its relatively short history, the
IJniversity has faced prospects for fi
nnncial ruin in the early years, tenure
controversies and the occasional
scandal.
Still, nothing in the past IOS years
has threatened the physical founda
tion and visionary mission of the Uni
versity like the devastating 1906
earthquake and the 1989 Loma Pri
eta earthquake.
Ihe 1 1 )( >(i disaster occurred during
the "second Stone Age." a period
when Stanford was just beginning to
overcome financial and legal difficul
ties and to expand its educational op
portunities. The timing of the quake
sorely tested the collective faith stu
dents and faculty had placed in the
I Jniversity.

The Loma Prieta earthquake di
rectly affected fewer members of the
University, and the reconstruction
period spanned 10 years. Though this
4 time Stanford was no longer an "edu
cational experiment" but an estab
lished. prestigious institution, the
quake reinforced the already proven
resiliency of the University through
natural and manmade disaster alike.
University Archivist Maggie Kim
ball said that as a result of the earth
quakes, this University has become
used to dealing with crises.
"It is the lesson of earthquake and
fire that man cannot be shaken and
cannot be burned," University Presi
dent David Starr Jordan wrote in
1906. "The houses he builds are hous
es of cards, but he stands outside of
them and can build again."
The 1906 earthquake
Bv all accounts, the l c )(>6 class en

lured Stanford under auspicious cir
cumstances. For the first time, stu
dents were reliev ed of financial prob
lems earlier classes had experienced.
The estate left by the late Leland
Stanford was out of the courts, litiga
tion by the U.S. government threat
ening to close the University was set
tled and according to English Prof.
Edith Mirrilees. Economics Prof. Ed
ward Ross was a forgotten name.
In "Stanford, the Story of a Uni
versity." Mirrilees wrote that in IWi.
"prosperity was in full view."
This optimism, however, all
changed in a matter ol seconds. Sud
denly. at 5:12 a.m. on April IS. the
earthquake of 1906 ruptured the at
mosphere of peace anil stability that
the founders, students and faculty of
the University had worked so hard to
achieve.
The lirst great shock measured an
impressive N.25 magnitude and lasted
47 seconds, according to Orrin Elliot,
University registrar.
Jordan, like almost all Bay Area
residents, was awakened by the
quake.

He wrote in his 1921 autobiogra
phy. "In less than a minute the solid
earth between us and the mountains
had been torn open to a depth of no
one knows how many miles and then
clapped together again as if nothing
had happened!"
1 4 XW>: Student reaction
Student reaction to the disaster
ranged from sadness to shock, with
most feeling lucky just to be alive.
"The two chimneys had both fall
en crashing through the roof, but not
touching the four girls directly under
neath." one girl wrote, as quoted in
Elliot's book "Stanford University:
the First Twenty-Five Years."
Another co-ed wrote: "All the
doors in the house were jammed in
such a manner that we were unable to
leave our rooms until the disturbance
ceased!"
Despite the shock of waking up to
an earthquake, many believe the lim
ing of the quake to be a stroke of good
luck.
"1 lad the shock occurred later in

the day. when classes were in session,
the loss of life would undoubtedly
have been large." wrote Elliot.
As it was. two men were killed by
falling chimneys. Otto C icicles, a fire
man. was killed in the powerhouse,
and Junius R. I lanna. a student from
Pennsylvania, w as crushed to deal h in
Encina I fall, then an all-male dormi
tory housing about 3(H) students.
After the rescue of the men in
Encina, Jordan spoke to the crowd
amassed in front of the building.
"The doors of this institution shall
never close." Jordan reportedly said.
I lowever, as the campus itself sus
tained heavy damage, many doors
did fall down.
Jordan wrote: "where the [Memo
rial] Arch had stood lay huge heaps of
jagged rock, the [Memorial) Church
was a sickening ruin, the ()uter (Quad
rangle a depressing sight with tipsy
walls and a fringe of rubble, the site of
