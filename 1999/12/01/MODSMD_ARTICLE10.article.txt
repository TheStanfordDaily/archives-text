### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
Chinese poet and exile Bei Dao
read his poems, both personal and
political, to an audience tilling
Kresge auditorium on Monday
evening.
As the final presidential lectur
er of the autumn term. Dao read
his work in Chinese. Translator
Eliot Weinberger followed each of
Dao's recitations, collectively ti
tled "Unlock," with a reading in
English.
Dao prefaced each poem with
an English explanation of its con
text. noting that he had been told
that "American audiences like sto
ries."
Dao read his very first poem.
"A Bouquet," written in 1973.
which he said dates back to his first
experience of falling in love.
He also read "Landscape Over
Zero" and a requiem to his late sis
ter who drowned at age 23.
"Poetry is not meant to be un
derstood." Dao said.
Assoc. Prof, of Asian Lan
guages Haun Saussy introduced
Dao, noting that Dao is •'simulta
neously the best known Chinese
poet and exile."
Along with other artists and
writers sympathetic to pro-democ
racy activism. Dao was exiled in
1989. following the Tiananmen
Square Massacre.
Recalling the circumstances of

past exiled poets such as Dante,
Milton and Victor Hugo, Saussy
said "exile" was not the most fit
ting term in the context of Chinese
politics.
While exile refers to a banish
ment beyond a political boundary,
in China, exile means banishment
to a "distant and unimportant cor
ner of Chinese space," he said.
Poets in exile are both "sublime
and ridiculous," Saussy said. They
are presented with "more repre
sentative power than an individual
can bear."
In Dao's case, he was exiled for
editing an independent magazine,
Jintian Today!, and for writing
poems, both conventional "ivory
tower" activities far removed from
public activism, Saussy said.
Yet, in the 19705, Dao devel
oped a new school of poetry with
"anti-authoritarian implications,"
Saussy said. This school, also
known as "misty poetry," drew in
part on the traditions spun by
Western poets such as Lorca,
Whitman and Elliot.
Misty poetry was thus "an obvi
ous target" of government repres
sion. Saussy said.
Saussy cautioned against read
ing Dao's poetry as politically
coded.
"American viewers [are used
to) seeing politics everywhere in
Bei Dao's work."
"It comforts our ignorance," he
said.
