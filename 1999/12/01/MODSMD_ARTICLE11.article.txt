# RFs enjoy living with 'extended family'
## 
### Margaux Hall Contributing writer 
It's the ideal family: two parents
tucked into a cozy house, two chil
dren sitting at the piano practicing
their scales not to mention 100
freshmen running up and down the
halls. This large extended family is
what greets Resident Fellow and
Dean of Students Marc Wais, along
with many other RFs, each evening
after a long day's work.
Wais, who lives with his wife Sue
Wais and seven- and five-year-old
daughters Ashleigh and Jennifer,
said the freshmen living in Junipero
have provided him with a greater
understanding of students' com
plete Stanford experience.
"As an RF, I've had the ability to
appreciate students' talents above
academic and intellectual
prowess," Wais said. "It is amazing
to see them excel not only intellec
tually, but outside of the academics
as well."
For many faculty members, the
opportunity to serve as an RF in a
residential setting offers a chance
for them to understand the multi
dimensional life of a typical Stan
ford student, beyond his or her aca
demic pursuits.
"I wanted to get to know my stu
dents better and immerse myself
into the Stanford student culture,"
Wais said. "Living with students 24
/ 7 affords an individual that unique
perspective."
Resident fellows, of which there
is at least one in each student resi
dence, act as educational and intel
lectual leaders in their residential
environments, according to Direc
tor of Residential Education Jane
Camarillo.
They are usually Stanford facul
ty members, although occasionally

senior administrative staff mem
bers fulfill the role as well.
Besides interacting with stu
dents, the RF is also responsible for
selecting and supervising the stu
dent residence staff, including the
dorm's resident assistants.
Each spring quarter, the RFs
read application files for residence
stall positions, and they conduct in
terviews with prospective candi
dates.
During the course of the year,
RFs are in charge of sponsoring
house programs that encourage ex
ploration of intellectual interests
and various philosophies, accord
ing to Res Ed's RF job description.
Each year, ResEd actively re
cruits RFs to live in each student
residence.
During this recruitment period,
"we share the information about
the Resident Fellow appointment,
its responsibilities and time com
mitment." C amarillo said.
The RF applicants submit an ap
plication. alter which a search com
mittee of ResEd representatives,
including the director and existing
residential staff members, inter
view each prospective candidate,
according to Camarillo.
Camarillo is ultimately responsi
ble for the selection of RFs. As she
evaluates the applicants individual
ly. she said she requires that "can
didates be prepared to support stu
dents during this transitional stage
of their lives and have familiarity
with some of the challenges for
people at this time."
In addition Camarillo said the
University looks to include a di
verse group of persons in its resi
dence staff. Currently, about half of
the resident fellows are either a
member of a minority group or are
female.

Following the RF selection.
ResEd assigns RFs to various va
cant residences on campus accord
ing to the candidate's specific re
quests, the si/e of their household
and the population or theme of the
dorm.
Camarillo added that there is
traditionally a greater preference
among RFs for four-class resi
dences over all-freshman ones.
RF Tom Gratz of Casa Zapata
said he sees the four-class environ
ment as a unique and special resi
dential setting.
"The freshmen bring excitement
and a sense of wonder to the dorm,
which rubs off on the upperclass
men. who provide a sense of knowl
edge and experience for lower
classmen," Gratz said.
For Wais, however, serving as
RF in Junipero's all-freshman envi
ronment has offered him the
unique opportunity to help stu
dents elect their course of study
and their respective majors.
In addition Wais said the wide
enthusiasm of freshmen makes his
job particularly enjoyable.
"One of my favorite parts of my
job is witnessing the energy and ex
citement generated by I'irst-vear
students, who are so eager to ab
sorb the new campus environ
ment," Wais said.
For RFs who decide to live in
theme environments, such as in one
of the four ethnic theme houses on
campus, there are special consider
ations to ensure all students, re
gardless of ethnicity, are incorpo
rated into the residential setting.
"There are added challenges in
[working in] a theme house be
cause there are misconceptions
about the dorm," said Nadinne
Cruz, who serves as Interim Direc
tor at the Haas Center and an RFin

Okada, the Asian-American theme
dorm.
Cruz added that the residential
stall in Okada makes a concerted
effort to ensure that all students are
comfortable in the theme house.
"We are careful with oui lan
guage as well so that when \\v sa\
'we.' ii represents-all tin* residents
in the dorm." ( ruz said.
T he RFs in such theme houses
work with the residence stall to 01
eanize house programs that ad
dress the ethnic theme and issues
that are relevant to it.
As part of its Asian American
programs. Okada offers two coins
es on Asian / Pacific-lslandei men
and women, respectively, accord
ing to Cruz.
"We put extra special thought
into how we do programming so
that it's inclusive of all residents,
but specific enough to be part of the
theme," Cruz added.
Many RFs agreed that such pro
gramming. coupled with there
sponsibility to lead the educational
and intellectual atmosphere ol the
house, can require a large, but a
warding, time commitment.
"My most precious commodity
is time, given that I must split mv
time between being a dean, an Rl
a father and a husband." said Wais.
" I rving to give each component
appropriate time is a daily chal
lenge for me."
(â€¢ rat/ said RFs. by accepting the
position, agree to devote a certain
amount of time to the residential
experience, and they gain a unique
impression of students' lives by
spending that time in the resi
dences with them.
"We see you in your home, so we
get to know you. or at least we can
present the opportunity to do so."
C j rat/ said.
