George W. Bush is getting a Stanford ed
ucation for free.
The Texas governor, gunning for the Re
publican presidential nomination in 2000,
has amassed a staff of more than a hundred
advisers from around the country. Eight of
the most important members of that group
are Hoover Institution fellows and Stanford
professors.
One of the most involved fellows is Martin
Anderson, a senior fellow at Hoover who
also advised Presidents Nixon and Reagan.
Anderson, currently writing a book on presi
dential campaigns, said Bush's network of
advisers is critical to the candidate's chances.
"Unless you have an army of intellectu
als," he said, "you are not going to win a pres
idential campaign."
All of Bush's advisers work in their spare
time for the governor, and none are paid.
Their work is done primarily through phone
and e-mail correspondence, as well as in their
meetings with Bush. All of their discussions
are confidential.
The relationship has both benefits and
drawbacks for the University.
Professors who advise candidates bring
back valuable political experience that can
enhance their work and student learning.

said Williamson Evers, a Hoover research
fellow and Bush education adviser.
But some fear that a Bush win would lead
to a mass exodus of Stanford professors to
appointments in Washington.
Evers downplays that threat.
"No one has any idea at to who will be
asked or who will leave," said Evers.'"lt is
quite possible that no one will leave."
None of the Stanford advisers will even
face that choice if Bush doesn't win next No
vember. To improve his chances of victory,
the governor began courting Stanford minds
before lie decided to run.
Bush's assembly of the Hoover fellows
began to take shape in March 1998 when
Business Prof. George Shultz. invited 10 fel
lows — including Economics Profs. Michael
Boskin and John Taylor, Hoover Senior Fel
low Martin Anderson, Senior Research Fel
low Annelise Anderson and Political Science
Prof. Condoleezza Rice — to his Palo Alio
home to discuss political issues with Bush.
"We thought he was terrific," Anderson
said of the would-be candidate. "Everyone
was very impressed."
Then, in July 199 K. Bush invited Rice,
Boskin. Schultz and Anderson to the gover
nor's mansion in Austin for the first of many
Texas meetings. Anderson said that the four
