# Bush's Stanford connections run deep
## 
### Mills Schenck Contributing writer 
George W. Bush is getting a Stanford ed
ucation for free.
The Texas governor, gunning for the Re
publican presidential nomination in 2000,
has amassed a staff of more than a hundred
advisers from around the country. Eight of
the most important members of that group
are Hoover Institution fellows and Stanford
professors.
One of the most involved fellows is Martin
Anderson, a senior fellow at Hoover who
also advised Presidents Nixon and Reagan.
Anderson, currently writing a book on presi
dential campaigns, said Bush's network of
advisers is critical to the candidate's chances.
"Unless you have an army of intellectu
als," he said, "you are not going to win a pres
idential campaign."
All of Bush's advisers work in their spare
time for the governor, and none are paid.
Their work is done primarily through phone
and e-mail correspondence, as well as in their
meetings with Bush. All of their discussions
are confidential.
The relationship has both benefits and
drawbacks for the University.
Professors who advise candidates bring
back valuable political experience that can
enhance their work and student learning.

said Williamson Evers, a Hoover research
fellow and Bush education adviser.
But some fear that a Bush win would lead
to a mass exodus of Stanford professors to
appointments in Washington.
Evers downplays that threat.
"No one has any idea at to who will be
asked or who will leave," said Evers.'"lt is
quite possible that no one will leave."
None of the Stanford advisers will even
face that choice if Bush doesn't win next No
vember. To improve his chances of victory,
the governor began courting Stanford minds
before lie decided to run.
Bush's assembly of the Hoover fellows
began to take shape in March 1998 when
Business Prof. George Shultz. invited 10 fel
lows — including Economics Profs. Michael
Boskin and John Taylor, Hoover Senior Fel
low Martin Anderson, Senior Research Fel
low Annelise Anderson and Political Science
Prof. Condoleezza Rice — to his Palo Alio
home to discuss political issues with Bush.
"We thought he was terrific," Anderson
said of the would-be candidate. "Everyone
was very impressed."
Then, in July 199 K. Bush invited Rice,
Boskin. Schultz and Anderson to the gover
nor's mansion in Austin for the first of many
Texas meetings. Anderson said that the four

spent the day with the governor
and agreed to help him set up a pol
icy shop.
In time, those meetings grew to
include hundreds of experts from
around the country, whom Bush
would ask for advice on issues
ranging from the environment to
the federal budget.
Evers described the meeting as
informal gatherings in which advis
ers discuss the central aspects of
important issues.
"[Bush] can integrate informa
tion he gets in briefings and papers
into a conclusion without a lot of
trouble," said Evers. "He has lots

of ideas of his own."
Bush's policy network now con
sists of three main groups — for
eign affairs, economy and budget
and domestic policy — in addition
to a permanent staff in Austin.
Rice, who stepped down as provost
last year, serves as the chief foreign
affairs and defense adviser.
Both Steve Forbes and U.S.
Sen. John McCain, Bush's two top
Republican challengers, have com
paratively small groups of advisers.
Members of the Stanford group
said for Bush, the benefits of a wide
network are evident.
"He is able to confidently put
forth his ideas on issues," Evers
said, "and he is backed by experts."
With the support and input of so
many intellectuals, Anderson com

pares Bush's campaign to those of
Kennedy, Nixon and Reagan.
Many of those currently advis
ing Bush have had significant polit
ical experience already. Taylor and
Rice advised Bush's father when
he was president, while Boskin
chaired President Bush's Council
of Economic Advisers.
Bush's other Stanford advisers
are both Senior Hoover Fellows:
Edward Lazear is an economics
professor, and John Cogan is a
public policy professor.
Anderson said the group's
members enjoy working as advis
ers.
"These people will give advice
to anyone who asks for it,"says
Anderson. "The problem is that
the candidates don't ask."
