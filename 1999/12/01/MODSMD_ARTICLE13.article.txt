# THE 						TURN OF THE MILLENNIUM

### Megan Knize Contributing writer 
Fifty years ago, Stanford adminis
trators had some interesting ideas
about the future of the University.
They thought a desirable total enroll
ment would be less than 7.(XK) stu
dents. They thought there would be
twice as many graduate students as
undergraduate students. They
thought Stanford would need a
tremendous amount of money to
continue. But as 1999 comes to a
close, predictions made in 1949 have
yet to come true.
Today, Stanford is home to more
than 14, (XX) students, with about half
undergraduates and half graduate
students. According to a 1949 Stan
ford Daily article, then-University
President Wallace Sterling said both
schools would be emphasized equal
ly, but the goal was to "develop both
according to the highest educational
standards."
The goal today seems relatively
the same.
"There is definitely more of an
emphasis on undergraduate students
now," said Robert Kinnally, dean of

admissions.
Kinnally said that within the past
ten years, enrollment numbers have
fluctuated slightly, but there is Little
indication that there will be huge
changes in the near fdture. I le said
such changes take a long time and
that the focus will not shift too dra
matically.
But will technology cause dramat
ic changes for Stanford's future class
es?
"We don't know what education
will look like," he said. "For all we
know, we may not be educated at a
place anymore."
But regardless of where the edu
cation takes place, the question of
where the money comes from to fund
it is still present. Fifty years ago. Uni
versity officials stated that "Money
has become the number one concern
of Stanford," and embarked on an
ambitious program to increase lag
ging endowments.
" The market never really recov
ered from the crash from 1929 to
1933," said Laurie Hoagland. presi
dent of the Stanford Management
Company. "Basically. Stanlord was
trvinu to recover from that and deal

with inflation from World War II."
Hoagland said Stanford's invest
ment has gone through three phases
since 1949. The first phase was very
prosperous for Stanford until it
ended in 1966. Investment was at a
low period from 1966 to 1982, as in
creased inflation rates hurt endowed
institutions and faculty salaries were
adjusted.
"There are long, sweeping cycles,
and you pretty much get carried
along," he said. But currently, the fi
nancial situation looks promising for
Stanford.
"Now. there is a very good invest
ment market coupled with declining
inflation," I loagland said.
I'he University manages $6 bil
lion, which represents just IS percent
of the University's budget.
What does he see in the Universi
ty's financial future?
"It would be prudent for the Uni
versity community to assume that
after 17 years of great markets, the
markets may go down." said
1 loagland.
And so, on the brink of the new
millennium, Stanford begins the next
glorious 50 years.
