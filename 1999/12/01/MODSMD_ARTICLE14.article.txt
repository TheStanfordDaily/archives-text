Internet commerce and innovation
well into the next centurv.

Steven Chu — Co-recipient of the
IW7 Nobel Prize for Physics and .1
current physics professor, he is cur
rently working 011 developing Project
Bio X with the help of Netscape co
founder Jim Clark's donation of $150
million. Bio X is an unprecedented ini
tiative designed to create an interdisci
plinary science program.

Tiger Woods — I Jnquestionahly the
most dominant force in golf today,
this former student and Stanford goll
team leader will remain one ol the
most visible figures in sports well into
