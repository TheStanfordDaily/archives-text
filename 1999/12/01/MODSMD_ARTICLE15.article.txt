# Campus now most earthquake-safe in area Retrofitting nears completion

Ten years ago, a 7.1 earthquake
decimated the Stanford campus, and
the University has learned its lesson.
Thanks in large part to federal dis
aster aid, private donations and Uni
versity funds that could have bought
earthquake insurance, Stanford is
nearing completion of a retrofitting
plan that has made it the most earth
quake-safe campus in the Bay Area.
For 15 seconds on Oct. 17, 1989,
University grounds grumbled and
shook, as the now-infamous Loma
Prieta earthquake rocked the North
ern California coast.
Remarkably, there were no major
injuries. However, 242 campus build
ings were not so lucky. Twenty of
them closed pending major repairs.
Five hundred students lost their
homes after dorms were ripped
apart, Memorial Church's mosaic
tiles decorated the floor instead of
the ceiling and hundreds of thou
sands of books fell off the shelves in
Green Library, one of the most se
verely damaged buildings.
The Stanford Museum of Art was
almost completely destroyed, includ
ing 14 ceramic sculptures on loan
from the Belgian government.
The campus, which had no earth
quake insurance, sustained $120 mil
lion in damage.
The probability of a repeat quake
still looms large today, because Stan
ford is located a mere 4.5 miles from

the San Andreas fault. But the Uni
versity stands pat without insurance.
"The deductible would have been
$ 150 million, so we wouldn't have ac
tually collected anything," said Jef
frey Seilbach, the University's direc
tor of risk management. "If we had
used another company with a smaller
deductible, they would not have been
financially viable to cover our losses."
Seilbach added that money that
would have gone to insurance is
being channeled into retrofitting
buildings, in the hopes that "preven
tative activities will create a safer en
vironment and also cut back on mon
etary losses in the event of another
major quake."
Repairs, though slow to get start
ed due to delays in receiving aid from
the Federal Emergency Manage
ment Agency, are now nearing com
pletion. The Bing Wing of Green Li
brary and the Cantor Center for the
Visual Arts re-opened this year.
The agency provided a total of
about $50 million in relief aid. The
State of California supplemented
that with an additional $5 million
through its disaster assistance pro
gram. The remainder of the money
came from the University.
Seismic experts praise the thor
oughness and thoughtfulness in
volved in retrofitting the historic
sandstone buildings. By implement
ing plywood sheathing, reinforced
concrete and reinforcing bolts, Stan
ford has gone from being one of the

least prepared schools to being per
haps the best prepared.
In 1989 the University contained
90 percent of the unreinforced ma
sonry buildings in Santa Clara Coun
ty outside of San Jose. Today, the
benefits of the $250 million seismic
retrofitting are apparent.
Craig Comartin, a Stockton struc
tural engineer who served as a con
sultant to Stanford, said in an inter
view with the San Jose Mercury news
that Stanford is "way ahead of other
(universities) in the Bay Area."
Almost all of the buildings on the
high-priority list have been retrofit
ted, said Jean Barnes, a project man
ager with the Capital Planning and
Management Office. The three main
buildings still needing attention are
the old chemistry building, the HRP
anatomy building and Encina Gym.
The final decision about whether
to retrofit these buildings or keep
them empty is pending. However,
Barnes believes that "something will
be happening soon."
Although Stanford is well pre
pared, Comartin noted in the inter
view with the San Jose Mercury that
there is still "quite a bit more work
they need to do."
Comartin's main concern is the
post-quake reliability of power and
water supplies. This is of particular
importance at a major research uni
versity, such as Stanford, because im
portant scientific research could be
ruined for lack of electricitv.
