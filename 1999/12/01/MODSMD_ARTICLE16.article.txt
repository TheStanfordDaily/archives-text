# Tree cut down by DUI charge
## 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
Following a recent plea of no con
test to a drunken driving charge, ju
nior Evan Meagher, the Stanford
Band's Tree mascot, will be required
to complete nine days in the Santa
Clara County Sheriff s work alterna
tive program.
On the morning of June 11,
Meagher collided with the side of
the pool around the Claw on his 1979
maroon Puch moped. Deputy Dis
trict Attorney Bud Porter told the
Palo Alto Daily News. At a blood al
cohol level of .27, more than three
times the legal limit of .OS, Meagher
was arrested and charged with dri
ving under the influence.
"It was not his intention to violate
the law," said Meagher's attorney
Todd Emanuel, speaking for
Meagher. "He expresses his re

morse, and thanks the Band and the
community for their support, and
looks forward to the Rose Bowl."
Meagher's arrest has generated
local interest, after his legal proceed
ings were covered by several local
newspapers including the Daily
News and the San Jose Mercury
News.
Meagher will not go to jail, as was
reported by those papers, according
to Emanuel. He will instead report
to the work program for eight hours
on each of nine days.
According to Emanuel, the inci
dent had nothing to do with
Meagher's role as the Stanford Tree.
While Meagher accepts full respon
sibility, "[his] conduct was far less
egregious than a typical DUI case,
involving a car or truck on a high
way," Emanuel said.
According to Emanuel, there is
no legal distinction between driving

a moped on campus and driving a
car on a highway. However.
Meagher's old moped, outfitted with
bicycle pedals, represents "much
less of a danger," Emanuel said.
In Meagher's courtroom ap
pearance Nov. 22. he pleaded no
contest to two separate misde
meanors, driving under the influ
ence and having a blood alcohol
level of .20 or higher.
Meagher will complete his work
alternative program hours in Janu
ary, following his appearance as
Tree at the Rose Bowl Jan. 1.
Meagher also must pay fines and
court costs of $1,261, and must com
plete .so hours ot community service,
as well as a drinking and driving ed
ucation program for first offenders,
the Daily News reported.
Also, his driver's license will be
restricted fora year to travel to
school and Band practices.
