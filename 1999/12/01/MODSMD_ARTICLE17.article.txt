# Hospital safety to be evaluated
## 
### Denali DeGraf 
Ten years ago, the Loma Pri
eta earthquake rocked the Bay
Area, and Stanford was not
spared its destruction. Most of
the $250 million in damages has
been repaired, as Green Library
and the Cantor Arts Center re
opened this year, but concerns
about earthquake preparedness
still loom over the University,
particularly concerning Stanford
I jospital.
According to Senate Bill 1953,
all hospitals with overnight pa
tient-care facilities must submit
the results of a seismic evalua
tion and a compliance plan to the
California Office of Statewide
Health Planning and Develop
ment by Jan. 1. 2001.
Then, all hospitals must prove
that they meet the structural per
formance category codes (essen
tially saying that the building it
self is earthquake-safe) by Jan. 1,
2008, and the nonstructural pcr

formanee category codes (mean
ing everything in the building is
earthquake-safe) by Jan. 1, 2030.
While that may be quite a few
years away, more than 50 percent
of California hospitals do not
meet the criteria to be labeled
earthquake-safe, leaving them
two options: the hospital can be
retrofitted to comply with earth
quake regulations or it can shut
down and stop doing business.
Shutting down a hospital
rather than renovating it may
seem unlikely, but in the case of
the Mt. Zion Hospital in San
Francisco, retrofitting was
deemed too costly and the hospi
tal was closed.
The Stanford Hospital was
built with money available from
Medicare before the 1971 codes
were even created, so concern
for its readiness in ease of an
earthquake are present, accord
ing to Per Schenck. the Hospi
tal's environmental health and
safety coordinator.

Because the retrofitting pro
cedure is quite costly and time
consuming. plans must be put
into place in the next 12 to 1S
months.
According to Mike Lassiter, a
spokesman for the hospital, the
Lucile Packard Children's Hos
pital, built in 1991, already meets
all of the safety standards and
needs no additional work.
However. Lassiter said, the
main Medical Center is a differ
ent story. I lie sections that
opened in 1959 — which make up
approximately 30 percent of the
hospital, including most of the
guest beds and operating rooms
— need no work done.
The other 70 percent was built
in 1 C )5 C ). and is currently being
evaluated to meet the standards
by 2008.
"The current estimate is that
it will cost under $10 million."
Lassiter said, "but we don't
