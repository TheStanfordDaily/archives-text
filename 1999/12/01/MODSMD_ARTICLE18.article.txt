The Stanford Post Office renova
tion is behind schedule, according to
Hill Johnston, the student P. C). Box
coordinator for the ()ffice ot the Reg
istrar. Students, he said, should disre
gard any notices stating that key dis
tribution to undergraduates ;md
graduates will take place on Dec. I
and Dec. 2.
" The Post Office is simply waiting
for the new P. O. Boxes to arrive. It
may be another week before the
boxes come in." Johnston said.
"However, rather than inconve
niencing students in the middle ol
their finals, we have scheduled the
key distribution to take place on Jan.
3 to Jan. 5 from K:3O a.m. to 3:30 p.m.
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium." he said.
To recap the changes taking place,
it is important to note that all students
will be receiving new boxes and keys,
although not all students will be re
ceiving new P. (). Box numbers.
"For those students that are only
picking up their new key. all that is
needed is an SUM). I or efficiency's
sake, we ask that those students being
re-assigned new P. (). Box numbers
bring their new number and SIJID;
although the new number is not nec
essary to receive the new key." said
Johnston.
Students can check the lists posted
near the Registrar's Office in Old

I Jnion lor their new P. O. Box num
bers. The renovation primarily af
feets students with combination
boxes.
"l or those students staying on or
near campus over winter break, keys
will be available for pickup during the

break; although an exact date is diffi
cult to determine," Johnston said.
Students with an SUID card will
be able to pick their keys at the post
office only during the break. In order
to avoid miscommunications. John
ston asks that students planning to

pick their keys up during break call
his office aj 3-5667 to ensure that the
boxes and jceys have arrived.
Johnston plans to continually up
date his voice mail recording to keep
students updated on the renovation's
progress. 1
