parking spacers.
The construction has cost the
University arc)und $68 million.
"Housing lottery is the most
stressful time of the year," Stromberg
said. "Depending on what you draw,
you could end up paying $2( H) more
per month. Half the people in my
apartment didn't get housing at some
time in the University."
Although the construction at Es
condido Village has caused some in
creased noise ; nd dust in the area,
the office of S udent Housing Ser
vices has received few complaints.
"People doh't like construction
where they live, but so far. students
have been ve(y understanding,"
Conklin said. |
The office hajs tried to address po
tential student concerns about the
construction by hosting social hours
for student updi tes and by setting up
a hotline, through which students
could receive in brmation about the
status of the construction.
"Students have been very patient
and supportive of the process,"
