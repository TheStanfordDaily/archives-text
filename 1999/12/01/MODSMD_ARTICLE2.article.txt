# Dish parking may disappear
## Accidents along Stanford Ave. prompt University request for ban 
### T.J. Babbitt Editorial staff 
Visiting the Stanford Foothills
along Junipero Serra Boulevard
may soon become significantly hard
er for people who use a car to get
there. Stanford has asked Santa
Clara County to ban parking along
Stanford Avenue, a street that feeds
into Junipero Serra and whose edges
turn into an impromptu parking lot
for foothill visitors.
The parking ban has the support
of the University, many residents
who live on that part of the Stanford
campus and Stanford Police Chief
Marv Harrington. At issue are safe
ty concerns arising from the way
people park on the side of the road
and what some neighbors call intru
sive and annoying traffic and noise.
"We have experienced two in
jury-accidents on that stretch of
Stanford Avenue in the past year,"
said Harrington at a public meeting
Monday night. The meeting sought
community input before the county
takes action.
1 larrington said both of the acci
dents were attributable to the park
ing situation, which involves cars
pulling on and off the shoulder of

Stanford Avenue in an area with a
lot of foot and bike traffic.
He said hundreds of vehicles
drive on and off the road each day to
park. Neighborhood residents at the
meeting complained that the drivers
of those vehicles often come tp com
plete stops in the middle of the road,
back up into makeshift parking
places and make unsafe U-turns.
Another concern is that parked
cars might limit fire-truck access to
homes along the street.
Stanford Avenue remains as a
sort of last oasis of easy parking close
to the Dish and the Stanford
Foothills, which are widely used by
the surrounding community as an
open space in which to jog and hike.
Over the years, Santa Clara County
has limited parking on Junipero
Serra and Stanford has curtailed
parking (in Campus Drive and those
residential parts of campus near the
Foothills where it has the authority
to do so. Now, Stanford has asked
fora ban from Junipero Serra to
Peter Coutts Road, though the
county may consider different
stretches.
If parking on Stanford Avenue
were limited, there would he no con
venient parking options near the

Dish for people without Stanford
parking permits. Andv Coe, Stan
ford's director of community rela
tions, said visitors should consider
using the Tresidder parking lot a
mile away on the central campus.
Santa Clara County has hired the
TJKM consulting company to look
at the issues affecting Stanford Av

enue. After holding two more public
meetings, the consulting firm will
present its findings to the County,
and the Board of Supervisors will
vote on any proposed changes.
