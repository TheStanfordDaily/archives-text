## Special fee return statistics released 
### Nathaniel Tulloch Contributing writer 
Special Fee refund statistics arc
out, along with the big winners and
losers in the student group populari
ty game. With 1% and IL/7l L /7 requests,
respectively, the ASSU Speakers
Bureau and ASSU Legal Counseling
received the least requests for under
graduate fee refunds.
ASSU President Mike Levin said
he was pleased with the low figures.
"We are hopeful that students will
continue to find these fees worth
while." he said. Overall, 357 under
graduates requested a refund from at
least one group.
Few students also requested fee
refunds from the SPOON Hunger
Relief Network.
The bigfee fund losersamong stu
dent organizations were the Stanford
Model UN. the Solar Car Project,
MEChA (an umbrella organization
for Chicano / Latino student groups)
and the Black Student Union, each of
which garnered more than 30() re
fund requests.
Graduate students requested fee
refunds at a much higher rate, de

spite their much lower overall fee.
A total of 665 graduate students
requested at least one refund from
the seven groups their fees help fund.
To request a fee refund, students
had to fill out the fee request form on
the ASSU Web site. Groups who
have students refund their fee re
ceive a list of the ID numbers of those
students and are entitled to deny
them services.
This voluntary fee refund option
is not a choice available on all univer
sity campuses.
Recently, some conservative stu
dents at the University of Wisconsin
have objected to their mandatory
student fees funding liberal groups.
The students recently argued before
the U.S. Supreme Court that their
First Amendment right to free
speech should allow them not to fund
groups with whom they disagree.
The university has countered
these objections, saying that these
groups promote diversity of speech
on campus and that some of them
would not be able to survive without
these fees.
The court's decision is expected
by June of next year.
