# Innovation addresses computer security
## 
### Jess Dang Contributing writer 
Computer usage on campus has
continued to expand in the past
few years as more students are
using Internet technology to listen
to the news, watch television and
communicate with friends and
family. However, with the devel
opment of these recent communi
cation accessibilities, Internet se
curity again becomes a salient
issue.
Currently, Stanford researchers
have been developing programs to
provide the best source of security
for users of these new communica
tion capabilities.
Computer Science Asst. Prof.
Dan Boneh has developed a new
authentication program for users
of these new Internet communica
tion devices with his team of re
searchers.
His research group, which in
cludes about eight students, spe
cializes in cryptography research.
This project is one of many for
the group, which aims to find solu
tions to the latest security prob
lems among computers today.
The program can be currently
used with Real Audio software and
is available for the public to down
load for free at http://crypto.stan
ford.edu/~nagendra/projects/Strea
mAuth/Stream Auth.html.
The purpose of the program is
to provide Internet users with an
authentication tool for the infor
mation thev receive through Real

Audio software.
Internet security has become a
dominant issue, especially for col
lege students, ever since e-mailing
became a popular source of com
munication. In dealing with e-mail
security, encryption programs
have been made to ensure the au
thenticity of all information that is
being sent.
However, the new communica
tion methods call for separate se
curity needs, which involve the en
crypting of transmitted video and
voice packets.
Boneh and his group of re
searchers wanted to target these
security needs as early as possible
to provide Internet users with the
necessary security.
"Without this new security,
people have the capability to inject
pornography or inappropriate ad
vertisements into child television
shows or into a conversation you
are having with your friend,"
Boneh said. "This new security
program stops these unsolicited
acts from happening."
The program authenticates
voice and video packets that are
transmitted through Real Audio.
When someone tries to inject video
or voice packets that are not part of
the original stream of data, the pro
gram stops the-information from
coming through.
"People should really take ad
vantage of this new program to en
sure the most security when com
municating over the Internet,"
Boneh said.
