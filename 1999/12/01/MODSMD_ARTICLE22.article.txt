Stanford students will mark the
ninth annual World AIDS Day
today by displaying a portion of the
AIDS quilt and passing out pam
phlets and condoms.
Activities, organized by the
World AIDS Day Committee, a
campus student group, and the
Health Promotion Services, a part of
Cowell Student Health Service, will
also include a service at Memorial
Church.
Organizers say the event is more
relevant than ever on campus.
"Stanford is a very educated
community. Most people here know
the facts about HIV and AIDS, but
they don't put them into practice,"
said senior Anita Ratnathicam, who
is the co-director of the Sexual
Health Peer Resource Center and
one of the organizers. "We are hop
ing that the planned events will
make people more aware of the
issue."
From 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., the Book
store will display a portion of the
AIDS Quilt.
Meanwhile, volunteers in White
Plaza will hand out pamphlets with
AIDS-related information, red rib
bons and condoms.

At 4:30 p.m., there will be a secu
lar commemoration in Memorial
Church, which will include student
speakers and an a cappella perfor
mance. Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs James Montoya and Rev. Mau
rice Charles, an associate dean of re
ligious life, will participate.

The quilt will be moved from the
Bookstore to Memorial Church for
the service.
Throughout the service, students
will be able to light candles at tables
set up in the Quad.
"This year's theme is 'End the Si
lence,' and it's especially pertinent
to Stanford because we've become
too complacent," said Director of
Health Promotion Services Carole
Pertofsky. "Students need to be
aware that the virus is hitting cam
puses."
To raise awareness, the Health

Promotion Services provided part of
the funding for the planned activi
ties.
According to statistics provided
by Cowell, one of every S(X) college
students is HIV positive, and the
group with the fastest rising number
of HIV infections is women in the
18-24 age group.
"This is a Stanford University
community day. because AIDS has
affected everyone here in some
way," said senior Stephanie Blos
som, Inter-Sorority Council presi
dent and one of the event's organiz
ers.
"We hope that the students, the
faculty and the staff will come to
gether and participate."
"I've always been interested in
the issue, and it's extremely impor
tant right now because no cure has
been found," said senior Annie En-
Yi Liu, another organizer.
As part of its continuous fight
against AIDS, Cowell provides free
and anonymous HIV testing, as well
as peer counselors.
Student groups that will also par
ticipate in the organization of the
event include the ASSU, Volunteers
Increasing Visibility of AIDS, the
LGBCC, the Safer Sex Shoppe and
the SHPRC.
