# Student MP3 worries renewed
## Carnegie Mellon penalizes 71 students 
### Amy Christeson Contributing writer 
This fall. Carnegie Mellon University officials have
penalized 71 students for illegally posting uploaded
music in MP3 format on that university's computer net
work. according to The New York Times.
Carnegie Mellon's actions have renewed some Stan
ford students' worries that their online MP3 collections
might get them into trouble.
SUNet, Stanford's computer network, allows stu
dents and faculty to communicate via computer with
anyone on campus. It also allows anyone with a SUNet
ID to access anything posted on the network.
Stanford's copyright policy states that "computer
users must respect copyrights and licenses," including
musicians' copyrights on most music that is exchanged in
MP3 format.
Last year, two Florence Moore Hall residents were
threatened with lawsuits for putting copyrighted music
onto their personal Web pages. Though most students
don't realize it, it is illegal to post MP3s on an internal
network as well.
This fall, freshman MP3 fan Toan Ton sent an e-mail
to his dorm warning other students to protect their music
after hearing that students were being punished for post
ing pirated music on the network. He secured his own
MP3 collection with a password so that he could not be
penalized, and shared the password with his dorm.
According to a Daily article from April 23, Stephen
Hansen, the University computer security officer, ex

plained that "at this point I figure everybody's been
warned."
"People shouldn't wait around for me to find out"
that they have pirated MP3s, Hansen said. "If the record
companies find [them] first, you're gonna have to deal
with their lawyers. You're violating federal law. It's a
felony."
The Carnegie Mellon students' dorm-room Internet
access was revoked for one month. They were required
to take a 90-minute class on issues concerning copyrights
and write an essay on what they had learned.
Paul Fowler, associate dean of student affairs at
Carnegie Mellon, said the students' actions were "a vio
lation of copyright law and [the university's] computing
code of ethics," according to the Times. The students'
MP3s were on the school's network, which made them
available to 11 ,(XX) people.
MP3s, short for Moving Pictures Expert Group,
Layer 3, are easy to make, trade and listen to. For these
reasons, they are popular among college students and
feared by the recording industry.
The Recording Industry Association of America has
recently filed lawsuits against Web sites that post pirated
MP3s. For the past two years, the RIA A has been sup
porting the Secure Digital Music Initiative in an attempt
to prevent pirating. The SDMI would place a "water
mark" on digitized music that would prevent piracy.
Hilary Rosen, president and CEO of the RI AA, said
she feels the initiative will "encourage artists and others
in the music industry to make their music available in
new ways, knowing that it will be more secure."
