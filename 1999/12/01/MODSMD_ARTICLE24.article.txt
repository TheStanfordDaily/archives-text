among public and private libraries
in ( alifornia.
Ii is more comprehensive and
technologically oriented than pre

I lerkovic, who manages Founda
tion Relations and Strategic Pro
jects lot Stanford's library system.
I he idea is to remove the prob
lem ol geography in providing citi
zens will) necessary information re
soui ccs. he said. Stanford libraries
already share many of their re
sources. including more than 7 mil
lion books, with other libraries.
I he grants, which total more
than 00.000. will support projects

that use Stanford resources to de
velop new ways to deliver library
services to California.
One grant funds the Stanford-
California State Library Institute
on 21st-century Librarianship. a
joint venture between the Stanford
University Libraries and the Cali
fornia State Library.
" The focus of the institute is to
provide information and training
to working library staff that will
give them tools — particularly in
areas of information technology,"
to improve the quality of their ser
vices. according to a Stanford News
Service press release.
Anne Marie Gold, executive di
rector of the institute, said "Stan
lord will be hosting the first annual
institute, [meeting] in August 2000
it will be a week-long residential
seminar for 150 librarians aimed at
providing them with hands on
training to transform their li
braries.
She added, "Students at Stan
ford will benefit from the back
grounds and opportunities that the
institute attendees bring to cam

pus. Stanford library staff will have
the opportunity to network with in
stitute attendees,"
Michael Keller, Stanford's head
librarian, told Stanford News Ser
vice, "We hope that cross-fertiliza
tion of ideas and solutions, inten
sive interaction among participants
and lasting informal ties will be
among the distinctive qualities of
the program."
The second grant will support
the Digital Delivery of Interlibrary
Loan Monographs. The grant will
pay to digitize and deliver materi
als requested by other libraries, the
project will contribute to the
longer-term goal of building digital
collections.
Previously non-circulating ma
terials, such as archival material or
fragile books, can now be made
available to other libraries in digi
tal format.
Another grant will sustain the
development of a statewide Cali
fornia Preservation Clearinghouse.
This program provides information
about preservation and disaster
preparedness.

The clearinghouse will establish
a Web site, an e-mail forum and a
database regarding disaster pre
paredness and response resources.
Walter Henry, acting head of
Media Preservation for Stanford's
libraries, noted, "This is a coopera
tive project involving Stanford and
five other library systems, both aca
demic and public, as well as five re
gional preservation networks.
Stanford itself is a participant of
BAPNet," the Bay Area Preserva
tion Network.
He continued, "The program
[clearinghouse) involves essential
ly librarians and thus does not af
fect students directly. It is our con
tribution to the library world. But
preserving resources is fundamen
tal because it ensures they are
available to everyone."
Herkovic emphasized that the
program is long-term, and might
not have visible immediate effects.
"The projects will help students
in a generic, global, and future-ori
ented way," he said. "The Library
of California is, after all. an idealist
vision for the state of California."
