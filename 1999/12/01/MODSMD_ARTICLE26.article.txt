## Stanford's music man in tune with position CAMPUS PROFILE 
### Solarina Ho 
In the tidy, cozy and brightly lit of
fice in room 120 of Bruun Music Cen
ter. the youthful-looking 40-\ear-old
director of choral studies recalls a
memory from his childhood.
"When I was in pre-school. I used
to carry around the libretto for La
Traviata' — a Verdi opera — instead
of a security blanket. That was my se
curity blanket." he explains half-jok
inglv.
It is a memory that reveals much
of the source of Stephen Sano's musi
cal roots.
"I was three years old. M v dad and
mom loved [*La Traviata'|. and they
listened to it all the time at home. We

had this old I oscanini recording of it
and it was the libretto from that — I
can still picture it — the cover from
the box set and the picture on the li
bretto." he recollects.
His parents never had formal
training in music, and his own did not
begin until he was 5, but the constant
music at home was something that
has been with him ever since he can
remember. Music has been an "enor
mous focus for me even when I was
really young."
His relaxed and easy-going de
meanor as he talks about his child
hood and current projects contrasts
with how immersed and extremely
busy he has been over the last several
years with his teaching.
Sano. w ho is also an associate pro
fessor. has been at Stanford since
1989. Part of those years was spent
doing his Masters and Doctorate in
choral and orchestral conducting.
When Sano finished his studies his
adviser also retired, so Sano spent the

next lour years as an interim director
of choral studies until a national
search was done in 1996. He was cho
sen by the department to begin the
appointment officially, and is now
finishing up his seventh year. There
have been huge changes with this ap
pointment, most of them involving
being able to implement long-range
goals lor his students and the overall
program.
"I couldn't think in a three-to-five
year plan before, because I wasn't
sure it 1 was still going to be here."
These plans have been impressive
and even ambitious, but have not de
terred him or his colleagues from pur
suing them — successfully.
"We're not a school of music or a
conservatory — we're just a little de
partment in this enormous place and
yet there's this really high participa
tion in performing here from all cor
ners of the University," he says.
There was never a touring pro
gram in place for the Stanford Cham
ber Chorale, but since his appoint
ment, Sano has been able to plan
ahead with annual domestic tours
and international tours every three
years.
1 le has taken his students from
Los Angeles and Seattle, to England
and Scotland, and this year, plans are
in place fora trip to I lawaii. I le is able
to look ahead now as far as 2(X)2.
Trips for the following years are
planned for Japan and Washington,
D.C. The plans have not simply been
touring hut to simultaneously give
Stanford more visibility wherever
they go. A concert was given in Seat
tle last year to admitted students. The
trips take the ensemble to schools in
the area they tour. Some of those high
schools are given master classes as
well.
"It is a premier ensemble," Sano
says enthusiastically and he has used
the opportunity to do an incredible
amount of outreaching and recruit
ing. including the local high schools.
A pilot program was started two
years ago with the chamber chorale
called project choraleXchange,
where contact people were provided
lor the high schools. Fifty area high
schools and even some elementary
schools have been given subsidized
admission to concerts. The purpose is
multi-fold, explains Sano.
"1 realized this was something we
needed here," he explains, "1 grew up
in Palo Alto, and I never came to
Stanford for concerts. I never knew
what was going on here. We're isolat
ed here geographically from the
town, yet we draw a huge number of
applicants from the area for under
graduate study here, and it just makes
sense to be out there and be visible
and make those concerts."

Sano and the director of orches
tras J. Karla Lemon have begun ac
tive arts recruiting in the last couple
of years in cities such as Chicago,
New York and Boston. They have
held site auditions for those who want
to combine that with their regular ap
plication.
"It gives a real Stanford presence
in traditional Ivy places like Boston."
Sano's"satisfaction comes partially
from student and parent feedback.
1 le says."I always get comments that
none of Stanford's peer institutions
do this, and it's amazing to see Stan
ford out there supporting the arts, re
cruiting specifically with the arts in
mind."
In addition to conducting, he
teaches a variety of courses, including
seminars on North American Taiko,
I lawaiian music and an interdiscipli
nary course called "Work of Art and
the Creation of Mind" with the de
partments of drama, dance, visual art
and the School of Education. The
I University Singers, another group he
conducts performs tonight in Memo
rial Church at 8 p.m.
1 lis passion for music is communi
cated to his students, many of whom
have known him for years. Amy
Hunn. a Masters student studying
performance practice — specifically
in conducting — met Sano in her
Freshman year at Stanford in 1991.
She took an introductory course with
Sano in conducting in her junior year,
which was what sparked her interest.
Since then, she has continued to study
with him.
"Steve is wonderful. I le's really an
extraordinary musician and teacher,
and he's a good friend too."
It was not entirely a life of music
for Sano however. It is only one of his
passions: "A huge one." he asserts,
"but after undergrad. I left music for
a number of years — it was nine years
before I came back to grad school."
He was a piano performance
major at San Jose State University
but for about five years after, he
didn't do music at all.
"I barely touched a piano," he
says."I worked in the mountaineer
ing equipment industry, because it
was another passion. At the time it
was a needed break."
Sano has always lived in, or
around Palo Alto.
"I have no desire to move else
where — I love it here, my family is
still here. It is an area that spoils you
geographically. More than anything
else," continues Sano, "the job in
many ways is a dream job. The cal
iber of the students is so high, they're
so exciting to work with. There's
wonderful support for the depart
ment from the university as a whole
which is great."

the area they tour. Some of those high
schools are given master classes as
well.
"It is a premier ensemble," Sano
says enthusiastically and he has used
the opportunity to do an incredible
amount of outreaching and recruit
ing. including the local high schools.
A pilot program was started two
years ago with the chamber chorale
called project choraleXchange,
where contact people were provided
lor the high schools. Fifty area high
schools and even some elementary
schools have been given subsidized
admission to concerts. The purpose is
multi-fold, explains Sano.
"1 realized this was something we
needed here," he explains, "1 grew up
in Palo Alto, and I never came to
Stanford for concerts. I never knew
what was going on here. We're isolat
ed here geographically from the
town, yet we draw a huge number of
applicants from the area for under
graduate study here, and it just makes
sense to be out there and be visible
and make those concerts."

Sano and the director of orches
tras J. Karla Lemon have begun ac
tive arts recruiting in the last couple
of years in cities such as Chicago,
New York and Boston. They have
held site auditions for those who want
to combine that with their regular ap
plication.
"It gives a real Stanford presence
in traditional Ivy places like Boston."
Sano's"satisfaction comes partially
from student and parent feedback.
1 le says."I always get comments that
none of Stanford's peer institutions
do this, and it's amazing to see Stan
ford out there supporting the arts, re
cruiting specifically with the arts in
mind."
In addition to conducting, he
teaches a variety of courses, including
seminars on North American Taiko,
I lawaiian music and an interdiscipli
nary course called "Work of Art and
the Creation of Mind" with the de
partments of drama, dance, visual art
and the School of Education. The
I University Singers, another group he
conducts performs tonight in Memo
rial Church at 8 p.m.
1 lis passion for music is communi
cated to his students, many of whom
have known him for years. Amy
Hunn. a Masters student studying
performance practice — specifically
in conducting — met Sano in her
Freshman year at Stanford in 1991.
She took an introductory course with
Sano in conducting in her junior year,
which was what sparked her interest.
Since then, she has continued to study
with him.
"Steve is wonderful. I le's really an
extraordinary musician and teacher,
and he's a good friend too."
It was not entirely a life of music
for Sano however. It is only one of his
passions: "A huge one." he asserts,
"but after undergrad. I left music for
a number of years — it was nine years
before I came back to grad school."
He was a piano performance
major at San Jose State University
but for about five years after, he
didn't do music at all.
"I barely touched a piano," he
says."I worked in the mountaineer
ing equipment industry, because it
was another passion. At the time it
was a needed break."
Sano has always lived in, or
around Palo Alto.
"I have no desire to move else
where — I love it here, my family is
still here. It is an area that spoils you
geographically. More than anything
else," continues Sano, "the job in
many ways is a dream job. The cal
iber of the students is so high, they're
so exciting to work with. There's
wonderful support for the depart
ment from the university as a whole
which is great."

Music Prof. Steven Sano conducts an orchestra rehearsal. Sano has
been at Stanford since 1989.
In the tidy, cozy and brightly lit of
fice in room 120 of Bruun Music Cen
ter. the youthful-looking 40-\ear-old
director of choral studies recalls a
memory from his childhood.
"When I was in pre-school. I used
to carry around the libretto for La
Traviata' — a Verdi opera — instead
of a security blanket. That was my se
curity blanket." he explains half-jok
inglv.
It is a memory that reveals much
of the source of Stephen Sano's musi
cal roots.
"I was three years old. M v dad and
mom loved [*La Traviata'|. and they
listened to it all the time at home. We

had this old I oscanini recording of it
and it was the libretto from that — I
can still picture it — the cover from
the box set and the picture on the li
bretto." he recollects.
His parents never had formal
training in music, and his own did not
begin until he was 5, but the constant
music at home was something that
has been with him ever since he can
remember. Music has been an "enor
mous focus for me even when I was
really young."
His relaxed and easy-going de
meanor as he talks about his child
hood and current projects contrasts
with how immersed and extremely
busy he has been over the last several
years with his teaching.
Sano. w ho is also an associate pro
fessor. has been at Stanford since
1989. Part of those years was spent
doing his Masters and Doctorate in
choral and orchestral conducting.
When Sano finished his studies his
adviser also retired, so Sano spent the

next lour years as an interim director
of choral studies until a national
search was done in 1996. He was cho
sen by the department to begin the
appointment officially, and is now
finishing up his seventh year. There
have been huge changes with this ap
pointment, most of them involving
being able to implement long-range
goals lor his students and the overall
program.
"I couldn't think in a three-to-five
year plan before, because I wasn't
sure it 1 was still going to be here."
These plans have been impressive
and even ambitious, but have not de
terred him or his colleagues from pur
suing them — successfully.
"We're not a school of music or a
conservatory — we're just a little de
partment in this enormous place and
yet there's this really high participa
tion in performing here from all cor
ners of the University," he says.
There was never a touring pro
gram in place for the Stanford Cham
ber Chorale, but since his appoint
ment, Sano has been able to plan
ahead with annual domestic tours
and international tours every three
years.
1 le has taken his students from
Los Angeles and Seattle, to England
and Scotland, and this year, plans are
in place fora trip to I lawaii. I le is able
to look ahead now as far as 2(X)2.
Trips for the following years are
planned for Japan and Washington,
D.C. The plans have not simply been
touring hut to simultaneously give
Stanford more visibility wherever
they go. A concert was given in Seat
tle last year to admitted students. The
trips take the ensemble to schools in
the area they tour. Some of those high
schools are given master classes as
well.
