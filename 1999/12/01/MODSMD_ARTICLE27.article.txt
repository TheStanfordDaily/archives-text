# Row chefs trade high stress for home cooking
## 
### Chris Crowell 
Most students on the Row agree
that their everyday eating experi
ences are better than other dining op
tions on campus. Here, we pay
homage to three very special faces be
hind the food.
Charles Dean, chef at the French
I louse, has been cooking for 21 years.
I lis resume includes work as a flight
cook at the Portland airport, where
he routinely made 2.000 cheese
omelets at a time, and a three-year
stint running his own restaurant, lint
the years started to take their toll.
"I was tired of the stress, tired of
being screamed at by the guy v\ In > was
m ad because he was being screamed
at by the next guy up the line, and so
on." Dean explains.
So. when he heard about the job at
Stanford through a friend, he jumped
at the chance. "It seemed too good to
be true." Dean said, citing the vaca
tion time and the chance to "meet
people's needs on a personal level" as
particular benefits of the job.
"I thrive on feedback, because
everyone deserves to eat. When they
don't, it makes me feel bad."
Steve Rubin, who works at Haus
Milt, shares Dean's love for the job.
Rubin has cooked more than 50.000
meals in his three years at Stanford,
and he sees himself as a musician.
"I have a set list, but I'm trying to
change it up all the time."

Rubin lias found another outlet
for hisereative energies by hosting his
own weekly cooking show on S( BN.
On the show Rubin combines step
by-step meal preparation instructions
with culinary movie clips which relate
to that week's food item. The show is
on sabbatical until January, when
Rubin will be coming back with all
new episodes.

Arthur, who asked to be identified
only by his first name, is in his first
year at Muwekma-tah-ruk House.
"It's hard to cook for different
tastebuds, especially now when
everyone's on their big health kick.
People want more veggies and pasta;
they don't want to eat fried chicken
and mashed potatoes," he said.
Despite the stress and frustration.

though. Arthur confirmed that the
job could be very satisfying when he
was able to make people happy.
And overwhelmingly, residents
do appear satisfied with their fare.
Daniel Moreau. a sophomore res
ident in the French House, said it
best: "This food is some of the best
I've ever had. and fora really good
price, too."
