### Chawadee Nualkhair 
Odds arc. most Stanford stu
dents won't be ringing in the year
2000 while hunkered down in
hunkers with cans of flaked tuna for
company.
Despite the fact that the millen
nium technically begins on the first
day of the year 2001, most people
aren't eager to pass up the chance to
do some hard-core celebrating.
For example, the widely-publi
cized champagne shortage has shot
prices for already-expensive bottles
of Dom Perignon up more than
double its original $89. According to
The Topeka Capital-Journal, some
state legislatures have even passed
laws allowing liquor to be served in
their statehouses on New Year's
Eve and New Year's Day. Finally,
a majority of Stanford students
themselves already have plans for
their own millennium celebrations
and they don't involve getting
ready for the upcoming apocalypse.
Students will be traveling to exot
ic locales, spending valuable down
time with friends and family, re-as
sessing their lives in the dawn of a
new millennium, or even trekking
down to Pasadena to support the
Cardinal in its first Rose Bowl since
1972.
Dave Durante, a sophomore,
said he was willing to deal with the
Rose Bowl ticket prices, ominous
traffic and heavy demand for tickets
in order to be part of the event.
"I figure, how many times is
Stanford going to make it to the
Rose Bowl?"
Others will be heralding in the
beginning of 2(XH) with the different
perspectives afforded by travel.
"I'm heading to Japan for the
first time in my life," said Wade
Henning. a graduate student in
aerospace engineering. He said he
had been studying Japanese for
more than a month in order to pre
pare for the trip to Japan, w here he
will be visiting a fellow student's
family.
Henning will be in the air when
the Y2K hug is purported to come
into effect. I le smiled when asked if
thoughts of airplane malfunctions
may have crossed his mind.
"That freaked me out." he ad
mitted. "I just felt that traveling

maybe 10 days after would have
been more practical." However, he
added that the idea of missing more
than a week of vacation in Japan
made fora much less attractive New
Year's celebration.
Luerecia Santibanez, a graduate
student in education, is heading
south of the border for her New
Year's.
"I'm going to Cancun. I will be
there with my whole family and we
are organizing a party with some
friends who will be there," she said,
smiling. When asked about the omi
nous prospect of a Y2K disaster, she
laughed. "As long as I can get some
money out of the ATM on the 31st,
everything will be fine," she said.
"I'm going to New York City
with my family." said Stephanie
Sam, a freshman. "I'm from New
Jersey, so we're going to go into the
city, where my aunt has an apart
ment. If anything goes down, we can
stay with my aunt." she said, refer
ring to the possibly riotous celebra
tions in Times Square after the drop
of the big bail.
And some students have chosen
to be far away from the dazzling
lights and party confetti of a typical
New Year's.
"I'm going hiking into the Mo
have Desert with my friends," said
Jeff Cho, a junior.
Not everyone is celebrating his
or her New Year's in far-away
climes. Some find the creature com
forts of home more alluring than
anything Mexico or Japan can offer.
"I'm staying around." said Ta
tiana Mclguizo. an education doc
toral student.
"There are a bunch of students
planning to have a party in the city."
said Hui Fen, a business student. "I
might go to that."
Ming Chuu is also going back
home to New York City. A native
Long Islander, he looks forward to
celebrating the millennium at a
perennially popular destination.
When asked if the celebratory at
mosphere at Times Square might
become overwhelming, he said he
was ready for anything the New
Year's could bring.
"I would like to be there [at
fimes Square]," he said laughingly.
" There are probably going to be a
lot of fights."
