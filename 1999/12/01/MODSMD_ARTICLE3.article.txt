In a hail of rubber bullets and tear
gas canisters. Seattle police cracked
down on groups of protesters at
tempting to disrupt the annual meet
ing of the World Trade ()rgaiiization.
Eleven Stanford students were
among the tens of thousands who
demonstrated yesterday.
The protest has created a unique
svmbiosis of labor unions, environ

mental activists and human rights or
ganizations. Indeed, the Stanford stu
dents represented diverse groups, in
cluding Students for Environment
Action at Stanford, Redwood Action
Team at Stanford and Amnesty In
ternational. Representatives from
the United Stanford Workers labor
union also participated.
Sophomore Lauren Inouye
demonstrated in Seattle on behalf of
SF.AS and human rights causes.
"It's been amazing, with so many

different people and so many differ
ent issues all here together... I • very
one has been extremely coopera
tive," Inouye said.
Junior Louise Aucrhahn, a mem
ber of SEAS who took part in the
events, described the protest as a
"huge convergence" of four separate
marches: a student march of thou

Inouyc said the WTO is not ac
countable lor its actions. '"It is sup
posed to promote free trade, but
there's no organization to counter
that with concern for the environ
ment or human rights," she said.
Protesters engaged in a wide
range of activities in order to inter
rupt the organization's meeting. The
efforts were largely successful, as
WI () organizers were forced to can
eel opening ceremonies and delay
meetings by five hours.

Yesterday saw the most heated
protests as downtown Seattle was
placed under curfew until sunrise
today. The National Guard was
called in after a state of emergency
was declared by, Mayor Paul Schell in
response to the increasingly violent
demonstrations.
A Seattle Police Department
spokesman announced last night that
22 arrests had been made, a total that
was likely to rise in coming days as po
lice moved through the downtown
area behind a wall of tear gas. arrest
ing protesters and clearing streets.
Inouye said the police's use of tear
gas was excessive.

"I am very concerned with the
police brutality. We were walking
home and without warning we heard
loud explosions [of tear gas canis
ters! behind lis. People there were
completely nonviolent, have not
even been asked to move, and all of
a sudden were tear-gassed," she
said.
Auerhahn said one police officer
pulled a gun on protesters, but was re
strained by another officer.
Seattle Police indicated that ii was
the violent behavior of a small frac
tion of the protesters that precipitat
ed the forceful response.
"We have demonstrators who are

continuing to express their point of
view."' Police Chief Norm Stamper
said. "More are doing it nonviolently,
some are doing it violently."
Security will be stepped up today
with the arrival of 200 National
(iuardsmen. in part due to the arrival
of President Clinton, who is sched
uled to address the WTO today.
Inouye said protesters are hoping
for peaceful demonstrations today.
"Everybody has been stressing the
need to be nonviolent and nonde
structive: if we shut down the WTO
again tomorrow, there is the potential
that they may cancel the proceed
ing." she said.
