## U.S., Mexican authorities search for bodies along border 
### 
CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico
(AP) — FBI forensic experts joined
Mexican soldiers and ski-masked
police I uesday in searching two
desert ranches near the border for
the bodies of more than 100 Mexi
can and U.S. citizens, apparent vic
tims of a drug gang.
A convoy of lb vehicles, many
with U.S. license plates, rumbled
through the white iron gates of Ran
cho de la Campana, 10 miles south
west of Ciudad Juarez, at midmorn
ing — joining scores of Mexican sol
diers and police already working
around the baby blue buildings in
the hilly, scrub desert. Some vehi
cles had newspaper taped over the

windows to conceal what, or who,
w as inside.
Attention seemed concentrated
around a concrete barn-like struc
ture where workers were using a
backhoe.
Attorney General Jorge Madra
zo said that while the number of
bodies in the ranches was unknown,
the number of people reported
missing in the area, located just
across the border from El Paso,
Texas, was around 1()() people —
including 22 Americans.
"1 don't want to say that there
are more than 100 cadavers in those
places where we are now searching,
but that in all in C'iudad Juarez

between 1994 and 1996 the list we
could make is of about ICK) per
sons," Madrazo told the TV Azteca
network.
He told the Televisa television
network that investigators suspect
the victims were killed by the Juarez
drug cartel, once Mexico's largest
cocaine smuggling outfit.
In Washington. Assistant FBI
Director Thomas Pickard said, "We
believe these people were killed for
their knowledge of or for being wit
nesses to drug trafficking."
"Most of the information we
have shows these individuals were
buried there at least two to three
vears ago, so it's not a recent situa

tion," he said.
U.S. officials, speaking on condi
tion of anonymity, expressed skepti
cism on Madrozo's estimate of 22
Americans among the dead, saying
only four or five Americans had
been reported missing in the area
over the past several years numbers.
Authorities were led to the
ranches by an informant who
approached the FBI early this year,
a federal law enforcement official
said in Washington. The informant
said there might be as many as 1(H)
bodies there, including people who
had been providing information to
U.S. drug agents, according to the
official, who spoke on condition of

anonynnty.
Eighteen-year-old Rodrigo Fal
con said his family had been taking
care of one of the ranches for the
property owner. Other nearby resi
dents who refused to give their
names said they had seen parties at
the ranch in the past, but it had
seemed abandoned recently. While
there were stables for horses, the
only animal visible was a scrawny
dog.
Pickard said digging began late
Monday and part of one body had
been recovered by midday Tuesday.
68 FBI agents and forensic experts
and other U.S. personnel were at
the ranches, he said. Madrazo. how

ever, told TV Azteca that so far
"there has not been any body
found."
"We've been discussing this fora
period of time with the Mexicans,"
Pickard said. "We've been getting
outstanding cooperation from Mex
ico."
Pickard said elaborate prepara
tions were required to decide where
to start digging, to secure the sites
and to "make sure we thoroughly
cover the sites with ground-piercing
radar," using techniques the FBI
developed in Kosovo. The FBI sent
forensic teams to Kosovo twice this
year to exhume bodies in a search
for evidence of war crimes by Serbs.
