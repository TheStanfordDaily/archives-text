Students should take
advantage of subsidized
Rose Bowl tickets

The Athletic Department has
done a great service to the
University and its students
by subsidizing half of the cost of
student tickets to the Rose Bowl on
New Year's Day.
The department lias shown its
willingness to back the football
team in whatever way possible by
making it easier for fans to be able
to attend the expensive event. With
tickets now at $55 instead of the
usual $115. more students are likely
to attend the game against Wiscon
sin.
The football team has surprised
the entire nation this year, and
Stanford fans have responded in
turn. The subsidy, while a great
attempt to boost attendance among
the Stanford contingency, is also a
good way to reward the football
team and its fans fora truly special
season.
()f course, the students must take
the next step. II they're fans of the
team, they should do whatever they
can It) take advantage of this
opportunity.
Last year, Wisconsin played
UCLA in the Rose Bowl. Since the
Bruins play in Pasadena for all of
their regular-season home games,
the Rose Bowl was pretty much a
home game.
Yet UC LA fans — who were
apparently disappointed with the
team for losing its bid for the
national title in the I iesta Bowl -

let down their team, as the Badgers
brought a larger fan base to the
Rose Bowl.
Stanford, though much smaller
in attendance than UCLA and not
nearly as close to Pasadena, does
not want a similarly disappointing
showing.
With the year 2(HK) looming, the
entire world is scrambling to find
the perfect way to ring in the new
millennium.
Editors note: We are aware of the
fact thai next millennium technically
begins in 2001. We don 't care, so
stop blocking our sunshine.
What way could possibly be bet
ter for Stanford football fans than
to watch the team in its first Rose
Bowl game in 28 years? Remember
that most current students, gradu
ate and undergraduate, weren't
even alive the last time the Cardinal
won an outright conference title.
As amazing as this season has
been, the truth is that this may be a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. ( ol
lege football can be very fickle, and
despite the talent of players and
coaches, conference titles can be
few and far between. UC-Berkeley
hasn't been to a Rose Bowl since
1 C >5S. Arizona, the preseason Pacif
ic 10 Conference favorite this year,
has never been lo this granddaddy
of 'em all.
So make the most of this chance.
Buy your ticket tomorrow, spend
New Year's Eve among friends in
Southern California, watch the
Band march in the Rose Parade
and cheer on the team when they
face Wisconsin.
See you in Pasadena.
