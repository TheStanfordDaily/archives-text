Land use should he open for
future changes
Soon after World War 11. the overrid
ing community message to Stanford was to
build housing on its land. After starting
what is now known as the Stanford Mills
subdivision (just to the west of Sand Mill
Road, near the Stanford 1 inear Accelera
tor). the University correctly decided to
keep its foothills in what is called an "aca
demic reserve." I'his opened the way for
the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve and
SI.AC and remains the largest single cate
gory of land use at Stanford.
The academic reserve sets Stanford
apart from all other major American uni
versities. It is In far its most valuable phys
ical asset. I he University would be foolish
to develop it rapidly, denying future gen
orations options that none of us can imag
ine.
Designating certain areas open space
for 10 years recogni/es the community's
strong current consensus. But it also
leaves the door open and quite proper
ly so. in my opinion for future changes
in land use that could prove critical to the
I Jnivorsity, surrounding communities and
the region.
If public officials designate substantial
ly more land permanently as open space,
however popular it is now, the long-term
loss could extend well beyond Stanford's
borders. Short-term, the result could be
deeply divisive â€” and costly litigation.

Foothills should be set aside
as permanent open spaee
When il comes to protection of the
foothills. Stanford's final Community Plan
and General Use Permit Application
released on Nov. 15 is virtually the same as
the first draft.
This time the plan includes an academ
ic growth boundary (ACiH) but states.
"Ten years following the delineation of
the ACIH. a comprehensive review should
occur to determine if the ACJB contains at
a minimum sufficient land for the growth
projected over the next 10 years, and if it
does not, to re-establish a minimum 10-
year supply of land within the ACiH."
In other words, the ACiH would not be
permanent and could be re-negotiated in
10 years.
Furthermore, the proposed ACiH
extends west of Junipcro Scrra Boulevard
to include the golf course and the area
around the Behavioral Sciences Center
area is currently designated "aca
demic reserve and open space"). The plan
would allow 20.000 square feet of develop
ment in the foothills over the next 10 years
and potentially much more after that.
If the plan is approved, this area would
be designated "academic campus," allow
ing development similar to that on the
core campus.
Stanford should do the right thing for
the community and set aside the foothills
as permanent open space.

Open space preservation
needed
Now is the time for Stanford to show
the vision and leadership that is so often
ascribed to it.
The Land Use Plan currently under dis
cussion will act as a vector for planning
decisions that will guide Mid-Peninsula
communities well into the next century.
The question of open space preservation is
one of the most crucial ingredients feeding
both environmental and social policy plan
ning decisions.
I urge Stanford planners to summon
the courage and wisdom necessary to do
the right thing by offering permanent open
space protection for the Stanford toothills
and drawing a permanent academic
growth boundary at Junipero Serra Boule
vard.

Land use plan lacks vision
Last week Stanford came out with a
revision of its 10-year Land Use Plan. That
plan places both a middle school and mul
tiple new office buildings on the west side
of Junipero Serra Boulevard.
Stanford's plan would generate hun
dreds of new car trips through the city's
busiest intersections because no one lives
near the proposed school site. Parents
would be forced to drive their children to
school, and workers in the proposed new
offices would have to drive just to go out

to lunch.
Most modern city planners have
learned that urban sprawl destroys a place.
Stanford's planners, on the other hand, are
operating as though it were 1950. Back
then, the idea of everyone taking a car
with them everywhere was thought to be
desirable. One of the most valuable
aspects of Palo Alto is that it is a truly
walkable community. Why can't Stanford
honor that instead of trying to destroy it?
If this new plan exhibits no modern
urban planning concepts, it does exhibit
obvious political motivations. In placing
the middle school on formerly designated
open space, Stanford is attempting to pit
the schools supporters against the envi
ronmentalists.
Middle schools need to be near neigh
borhoods, like on Stanford Avenue and El
Camino Real. Office buildings need to be
near services, like at Palm Drive and El
Camino Real. This community values
walkability and open space more than
sprawl. Stanford is a more desirable uni
versity because Palo Alto has succeeded in
preserving these values up until now.

Stanford should commit to
preservation of Foothills
As a 30-year resident of this area, I
have found myself at odds with Stanford
on a number of occasions. Throughout
these various episodes, I have always
