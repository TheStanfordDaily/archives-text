Land use should he open for
future changes
Soon after World War 11. the overrid
ing community message to Stanford was to
build housing on its land. After starting
what is now known as the Stanford Mills
subdivision (just to the west of Sand Mill
Road, near the Stanford 1 inear Accelera
tor). the University correctly decided to
keep its foothills in what is called an "aca
demic reserve." I'his opened the way for
the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve and
SI.AC and remains the largest single cate
gory of land use at Stanford.
The academic reserve sets Stanford
apart from all other major American uni
versities. It is In far its most valuable phys
ical asset. I he University would be foolish
to develop it rapidly, denying future gen
orations options that none of us can imag
ine.
Designating certain areas open space
for 10 years recogni/es the community's
strong current consensus. But it also
leaves the door open and quite proper
ly so. in my opinion for future changes
in land use that could prove critical to the
I Jnivorsity, surrounding communities and
the region.
If public officials designate substantial
ly more land permanently as open space,
however popular it is now, the long-term
loss could extend well beyond Stanford's
borders. Short-term, the result could be
deeply divisive — and costly litigation.

Foothills should be set aside
as permanent open spaee
When il comes to protection of the
foothills. Stanford's final Community Plan
and General Use Permit Application
released on Nov. 15 is virtually the same as
the first draft.
This time the plan includes an academ
ic growth boundary (ACiH) but states.
"Ten years following the delineation of
the ACIH. a comprehensive review should
occur to determine if the ACJB contains at
a minimum sufficient land for the growth
projected over the next 10 years, and if it
does not, to re-establish a minimum 10-
year supply of land within the ACiH."
In other words, the ACiH would not be
permanent and could be re-negotiated in
10 years.
Furthermore, the proposed ACiH
extends west of Junipcro Scrra Boulevard
to include the golf course and the area
around the Behavioral Sciences Center
area is currently designated "aca
demic reserve and open space"). The plan
would allow 20.000 square feet of develop
ment in the foothills over the next 10 years
and potentially much more after that.
If the plan is approved, this area would
be designated "academic campus," allow
ing development similar to that on the
core campus.
Stanford should do the right thing for
the community and set aside the foothills
as permanent open space.

Open space preservation
needed
Now is the time for Stanford to show
the vision and leadership that is so often
ascribed to it.
The Land Use Plan currently under dis
cussion will act as a vector for planning
decisions that will guide Mid-Peninsula
communities well into the next century.
The question of open space preservation is
one of the most crucial ingredients feeding
both environmental and social policy plan
ning decisions.
I urge Stanford planners to summon
the courage and wisdom necessary to do
the right thing by offering permanent open
space protection for the Stanford toothills
and drawing a permanent academic
growth boundary at Junipero Serra Boule
vard.

Land use plan lacks vision
Last week Stanford came out with a
revision of its 10-year Land Use Plan. That
plan places both a middle school and mul
tiple new office buildings on the west side
of Junipero Serra Boulevard.
Stanford's plan would generate hun
dreds of new car trips through the city's
busiest intersections because no one lives
near the proposed school site. Parents
would be forced to drive their children to
school, and workers in the proposed new
offices would have to drive just to go out

to lunch.
Most modern city planners have
learned that urban sprawl destroys a place.
Stanford's planners, on the other hand, are
operating as though it were 1950. Back
then, the idea of everyone taking a car
with them everywhere was thought to be
desirable. One of the most valuable
aspects of Palo Alto is that it is a truly
walkable community. Why can't Stanford
honor that instead of trying to destroy it?
If this new plan exhibits no modern
urban planning concepts, it does exhibit
obvious political motivations. In placing
the middle school on formerly designated
open space, Stanford is attempting to pit
the schools supporters against the envi
ronmentalists.
Middle schools need to be near neigh
borhoods, like on Stanford Avenue and El
Camino Real. Office buildings need to be
near services, like at Palm Drive and El
Camino Real. This community values
walkability and open space more than
sprawl. Stanford is a more desirable uni
versity because Palo Alto has succeeded in
preserving these values up until now.

Stanford should commit to
preservation of Foothills
As a 30-year resident of this area, I
have found myself at odds with Stanford
on a number of occasions. Throughout
these various episodes, I have always
admired Stanford and remained favorably
disposed toward the institution for one
reason.
Almost every day for the past 30 years
I have traveled hy or hiked on the open
Stanford lands west of Junipero Serra
Boulevard. They have been the daily
reminder for me and thousands of others
that even at its most uncaring, Stanford
and its Trustees have preserved this island
against the encroaching sprawl which has
obliterated so much of the natural beauty
of this area.
II this remaining evidence of this con
tinued commitment to being a good neigh
bor and standing lor values more lasting
than unrestrained growth is lost, I can
assure the Trustees that the well of residu
al good feelings toward Stanford will final
ly go dry. They will have lost not only their
claim that Stanford is a world-class institu
tion but the reservoir of good will that
their stewardship of this priceless asset has
afforded them.
Forever after the name Stanford will be
equated with "Enemy," and those in this
community who have been willing to com
promise with or overlook the Trustees'
often heavy-handed methods will become
Stanford's intransigent foes on every
front.
I urge the Trustees to stale unequivo
cally and for ;ill time their commitment to
the preservation in their present state ol
the foothill lands over which they are the
appointed stewards.

I Irge Stanford to develop in
sustainable manner
B ing a native ol Palo Alto. I have
,ii countless hours running, hiking and
connecting with the wonders of nature in
the Stanford foothills. I have a deep, long
standing bond with this land. Six years
ago. I even sat on those hills to welcome
the morning sun with friends upon gradu
ating from Palo Alto I ligh School.
I nfortunatcly, Stanford's development
plan threatens this precious open space.

not only for its recreational uses but also
for the native plants and animals that
make up the true heritage ol our region.
Stanford is proposing to expand the
core campus into the foothills, allowing
office buildings and urban development to
be built. They are also proposing to
enlarge the campus square footage by
more than one-third of its existing size. All
this without providing permanent open
space protection in the foothills as com
pensation. This glaring oversight must be
rectified if this valley is to keep some of
the magic that makes it a great place to
work, study and live.
I urge people to speak out on this issue
because if we don't, Stanford's plan will
not incorporate permanent protection for
the Foothills, and we will all suffer the
consequences of living in a sprawling
urban jungle.
1 know that Stanford can develop in a
sustainable manner, but we need to let
them know that we will stand for no less.

Land use plan promotes
irresponsible development
In the Community Plan that Stanford
recently submitted, they boldly announced
their plan to start developing the foothills.
They are planning to build 4().<)()() square
feet in the foothills, including a building
for the Carnegie Foundation perched on a
hill above Junipero Serra Boulevard.
Their plan essentially asks for special
treatment. Any other landowner in the
county would face restrictions that would
limit their ability to build so recklessly in
the foothills.
While Stanford has done a tremendous
amount for the region, the University
needs to be held to the same standards as
other developers because its development
causes similar impacts. In addition to fair
ness, Stanford's plan should be judged on
its merits as a planning document.
It is hard to imagine that sprawling the
campus into the foothills makes sense for
Stanford or for the community. Open

space serves many important purposes in
the county, and Stanford should develop
in a way that is sensitive to this value.
I here is a tremendous amount of unde
veloped land on the 1.7(H) acres that make
up Stanford's current core campus area,
and this land is more than sufficient for the
University's current development plans if
plans il used wisely.
While Stanford has the right to develop
its land, it must comply with County goals
and policies that require protection of the
foothills and open space. The County
needs to hold Stanford accountable for the
significant impacts that are going to be
generated from development.
Other developers are routinely
required to dedicate permanent open
space in exchange for development rights,
and Stanford should not be exempt.
Stanford should be allowed to develop
in a responsible way that meets its aca
demic needs if it can do so without damag
ing the surrounding community. The Uni
versity's current plan is a long way from
achieving this.

Athletic Department should
make Rose Bowl tickets free
An article 011 the front page of hist
Monday's Daily talked briefly about how
the Athletic Department "hopes to subsi
dize" the cost of the $115 tickets to the
Rose Bowl 011 Jan. 1.
At first glance, it would seem very cost-
Iv for the Athletic Department to partially
pay for the 33,000 tickets that are avail
able. Hut Stanford Athletics will get a
tremendous sum of money just for appear
ing in the Rose Bowl.
Last year, the payout per team lor the
Rose Bowl was $12.3 million, according to
CNN / SI. That's $12.3 million per team,
regardless of winning or losing.
I! this year's Rose Bowl prize is similar
to last year's, we honestly don't see what
"Rosey dilemma" the Athletic Depart
ment is facing with subsidization of tickets.
In fact, for $12.3 million the Athletic

Department could afford to subsidize the
entire $115 ticket price for all 33,000 tick
ets and still have more than $8.5 million
left over to spend on recruiting, renova
tions and other resources.
This is the biggest thing to happen to
Stanford football fora while, and many
students who are excited about the game
are citing the cost of tickets as being the
biggest obstacle in attending the game.
Senior associate Athletic Director
Cherl Levick was quoted in the article as
saying, "Students are the group we really
want down there." Well, if that's what the
Athletic Department wants, then they can
make it happen by making it easier on our
wallets: Make the tickets available for
free.

Riot police a welcome pres
ence at Big Game
In my four Big Games, 1 have seen a lot
of stupid violence and violence-inducing
behavior come from the "intelligent"
Stanford students that everyone's been
talking so much about.
I've seen students smashed against the
fence in Stanford Stadium, students
pushed down and trampled on the way
down the steps, poorly-aimed fruit thrown
at Cal students that hit the Band, a drunk
en student falling and knocking down
three rows of band members and our stu
dents taunting their students from a few
feet away.
The presence of the riot police at the
game forced our intelligent students to
think twice — or even three times -
about rushing the field. I wouldn't want to
rush the field it I thought there was even a
chance that I might get clubbed and then
arrested. The violence surrounding Big
Game has gotten out of hand in the past
several years, so the administration want
ed to scare us into being good.
It worked. It is likely that the ominous

force of riot police is the only thing that
kept a repeat of the last several years from
happening. The University's actions did
not "make a mockery of the student
body." They merely set up a situation
which virtually assured that no one would
get on the field.
I saw no "blatantly hostile measures,"
nor was there any violence displayed by
the riot police (whose face shields were
down because our students were throwing
oranges and various other projectiles at
them). They merely stood, ready for the
worst.
If the extreme use of police forces truly
"ruined the atmosphere" for fans, those
people should have been paying more
attention to the game. And maybe they
should have been excited that such a force
was present, wondering what would ensue.
I will admit that it was a little scary
watching them parade down the ramp and
position themselves in front of the stu
dents. but once they were there, I had a
perfectly grand time watching the rest of
the game, and I was pleasantly surprised
when 1 was not run over and killed by
mobs of students trying to get past me.
There weren't any.
It was a little disappointing that the
Band was not allowed on the field for their
traditional post-game show, but overall I
was happy. And 1 went home without hav
ing experienced the adrenaline rush that
comes from truly fearing for one's own
physical safety — the fear that I have felt
at my three other Big Games.
We at Stanford try to think that all
riotous behavior at the last few Big Games
is Cal's fault, but we are wrong. We have
been inciting the Cal students to the point
where their aggression and animosity get
the better of them.
Maybe we're not stupid enough to
destroy our own field, tear down their goal
post when we lose, rip apart and beat up
Oski or rush the field full of riot police, but
we're still pretty stupid. It's called mob
mentality, and no one is above it, not even
Stanford students.

Now is the time for Stanford to show
the vision and leadership that is so often
ascribed to it.
The Land Use Plan currently under dis

The question of open space preservation is
one of the most crucial ingredients feeding
both environmental and social policy plan

Land use plan lacks vision
Last week Stanford came out with a
revision of its 10-year Land Use Plan. That
plan places both a middle school and mul
tiple new office buildings on the west side
of Junipero Serra Boulevard.
Stanford's plan would generate hun
dreds of new car trips through the city's
busiest intersections because no one lives
near the proposed school site. Parents
would be forced to drive their children to
school, and workers in the proposed new
offices would have to drive just to go out

to lunch.
Most modern city planners have
learned that urban sprawl destroys a place.
Stanford's planners, on the other hand, are
operating as though it were 1950. Back
then, the idea of everyone taking a car
with them everywhere was thought to be
desirable. One of the most valuable
aspects of Palo Alto is that it is a truly
walkable community. Why can't Stanford
honor that instead of trying to destroy it?
If this new plan exhibits no modern
urban planning concepts, it does exhibit
obvious political motivations. In placing
the middle school on formerly designated
open space, Stanford is attempting to pit
the schools supporters against the envi
ronmentalists.
Middle schools need to be near neigh
borhoods, like on Stanford Avenue and El
Camino Real. Office buildings need to be
near services, like at Palm Drive and El
Camino Real. This community values
walkability and open space more than
sprawl. Stanford is a more desirable uni
versity because Palo Alto has succeeded in
preserving these values up until now.

Stanford should commit to
preservation of Foothills
As a 30-year resident of this area, I
have found myself at odds with Stanford
on a number of occasions. Throughout
these various episodes, I have always
admired Stanford and remained favorably
disposed toward the institution for one
reason.
Almost every day for the past 30 years
I have traveled hy or hiked on the open
Stanford lands west of Junipero Serra
Boulevard. They have been the daily
reminder for me and thousands of others
that even at its most uncaring, Stanford
and its Trustees have preserved this island
against the encroaching sprawl which has
obliterated so much of the natural beauty
of this area.
II this remaining evidence of this con
tinued commitment to being a good neigh
bor and standing lor values more lasting
than unrestrained growth is lost, I can
assure the Trustees that the well of residu
al good feelings toward Stanford will final
ly go dry. They will have lost not only their
claim that Stanford is a world-class institu
tion but the reservoir of good will that
their stewardship of this priceless asset has
afforded them.
Forever after the name Stanford will be
equated with "Enemy," and those in this
community who have been willing to com
promise with or overlook the Trustees'
often heavy-handed methods will become
Stanford's intransigent foes on every
front.
I urge the Trustees to stale unequivo

the preservation in their present state ol
the foothill lands over which they are the
appointed stewards.

I Irge Stanford to develop in
sustainable manner
B ing a native ol Palo Alto. I have
,ii countless hours running, hiking and
connecting with the wonders of nature in
the Stanford foothills. I have a deep, long
standing bond with this land. Six years
ago. I even sat on those hills to welcome
the morning sun with friends upon gradu
ating from Palo Alto I ligh School.
I nfortunatcly, Stanford's development
plan threatens this precious open space.

not only for its recreational uses but also
for the native plants and animals that
make up the true heritage ol our region.
Stanford is proposing to expand the
core campus into the foothills, allowing
office buildings and urban development to
be built. They are also proposing to
enlarge the campus square footage by
more than one-third of its existing size. All
this without providing permanent open
space protection in the foothills as com
pensation. This glaring oversight must be
rectified if this valley is to keep some of
the magic that makes it a great place to
work, study and live.
I urge people to speak out on this issue
because if we don't, Stanford's plan will
not incorporate permanent protection for
the Foothills, and we will all suffer the
consequences of living in a sprawling
urban jungle.
1 know that Stanford can develop in a
sustainable manner, but we need to let
them know that we will stand for no less.

Land use plan promotes
irresponsible development
In the Community Plan that Stanford
recently submitted, they boldly announced
their plan to start developing the foothills.
They are planning to build 4().<)()() square
feet in the foothills, including a building
for the Carnegie Foundation perched on a
hill above Junipero Serra Boulevard.
Their plan essentially asks for special
treatment. Any other landowner in the
county would face restrictions that would
limit their ability to build so recklessly in
the foothills.
While Stanford has done a tremendous
amount for the region, the University
needs to be held to the same standards as
other developers because its development
causes similar impacts. In addition to fair
ness, Stanford's plan should be judged on
its merits as a planning document.
It is hard to imagine that sprawling the
campus into the foothills makes sense for
Stanford or for the community. Open

space serves many important purposes in
the county, and Stanford should develop
in a way that is sensitive to this value.
I here is a tremendous amount of unde
veloped land on the 1.7(H) acres that make
up Stanford's current core campus area,
and this land is more than sufficient for the
University's current development plans if
plans il used wisely.
While Stanford has the right to develop
its land, it must comply with County goals
and policies that require protection of the
foothills and open space. The County
needs to hold Stanford accountable for the
significant impacts that are going to be
generated from development.
Other developers are routinely
required to dedicate permanent open
space in exchange for development rights,
and Stanford should not be exempt.
Stanford should be allowed to develop
in a responsible way that meets its aca
demic needs if it can do so without damag
ing the surrounding community. The Uni
versity's current plan is a long way from
achieving this.

Athletic Department should
make Rose Bowl tickets free
An article 011 the front page of hist
Monday's Daily talked briefly about how
the Athletic Department "hopes to subsi
dize" the cost of the $115 tickets to the
Rose Bowl 011 Jan. 1.
At first glance, it would seem very cost-
Iv for the Athletic Department to partially
pay for the 33,000 tickets that are avail
able. Hut Stanford Athletics will get a
tremendous sum of money just for appear
ing in the Rose Bowl.
Last year, the payout per team lor the
Rose Bowl was $12.3 million, according to
CNN / SI. That's $12.3 million per team,
regardless of winning or losing.
I! this year's Rose Bowl prize is similar
to last year's, we honestly don't see what
"Rosey dilemma" the Athletic Depart
ment is facing with subsidization of tickets.
In fact, for $12.3 million the Athletic

Department could afford to subsidize the
entire $115 ticket price for all 33,000 tick
ets and still have more than $8.5 million
left over to spend on recruiting, renova
tions and other resources.
This is the biggest thing to happen to
Stanford football fora while, and many
students who are excited about the game
are citing the cost of tickets as being the
biggest obstacle in attending the game.
Senior associate Athletic Director
Cherl Levick was quoted in the article as
saying, "Students are the group we really
want down there." Well, if that's what the
Athletic Department wants, then they can
make it happen by making it easier on our
wallets: Make the tickets available for
free.

Riot police a welcome pres
ence at Big Game
In my four Big Games, 1 have seen a lot
of stupid violence and violence-inducing
behavior come from the "intelligent"
Stanford students that everyone's been
talking so much about.
I've seen students smashed against the
fence in Stanford Stadium, students
pushed down and trampled on the way
down the steps, poorly-aimed fruit thrown
at Cal students that hit the Band, a drunk
en student falling and knocking down
three rows of band members and our stu
dents taunting their students from a few
feet away.
The presence of the riot police at the
game forced our intelligent students to
think twice — or even three times -
about rushing the field. I wouldn't want to
rush the field it I thought there was even a
chance that I might get clubbed and then
arrested. The violence surrounding Big
Game has gotten out of hand in the past
several years, so the administration want
ed to scare us into being good.
It worked. It is likely that the ominous

force of riot police is the only thing that
kept a repeat of the last several years from
happening. The University's actions did
not "make a mockery of the student
body." They merely set up a situation
which virtually assured that no one would
get on the field.
I saw no "blatantly hostile measures,"
nor was there any violence displayed by
the riot police (whose face shields were
down because our students were throwing
oranges and various other projectiles at
them). They merely stood, ready for the
worst.
If the extreme use of police forces truly
"ruined the atmosphere" for fans, those
people should have been paying more
attention to the game. And maybe they
should have been excited that such a force
was present, wondering what would ensue.
I will admit that it was a little scary
watching them parade down the ramp and
position themselves in front of the stu
dents. but once they were there, I had a
perfectly grand time watching the rest of
the game, and I was pleasantly surprised
when 1 was not run over and killed by
mobs of students trying to get past me.
There weren't any.
It was a little disappointing that the
Band was not allowed on the field for their
traditional post-game show, but overall I
was happy. And 1 went home without hav
ing experienced the adrenaline rush that
comes from truly fearing for one's own
physical safety — the fear that I have felt
at my three other Big Games.
We at Stanford try to think that all
riotous behavior at the last few Big Games
is Cal's fault, but we are wrong. We have
been inciting the Cal students to the point
where their aggression and animosity get
the better of them.
Maybe we're not stupid enough to
destroy our own field, tear down their goal
post when we lose, rip apart and beat up
Oski or rush the field full of riot police, but
we're still pretty stupid. It's called mob
mentality, and no one is above it, not even
Stanford students.

Land use should he open for
future changes
Soon after World War 11. the overrid
ing community message to Stanford was to
build housing on its land. After starting
what is now known as the Stanford Mills
subdivision (just to the west of Sand Mill
Road, near the Stanford 1 inear Accelera
tor). the University correctly decided to
keep its foothills in what is called an "aca
demic reserve." I'his opened the way for
the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve and
SI.AC and remains the largest single cate
gory of land use at Stanford.
The academic reserve sets Stanford
apart from all other major American uni
versities. It is In far its most valuable phys
ical asset. I he University would be foolish
to develop it rapidly, denying future gen
orations options that none of us can imag
ine.
Designating certain areas open space
for 10 years recogni/es the community's
strong current consensus. But it also
leaves the door open and quite proper
ly so. in my opinion for future changes
in land use that could prove critical to the
I Jnivorsity, surrounding communities and
the region.
If public officials designate substantial
ly more land permanently as open space,
however popular it is now, the long-term
loss could extend well beyond Stanford's
borders. Short-term, the result could be
deeply divisive — and costly litigation.

Foothills should be set aside
as permanent open spaee
When il comes to protection of the
foothills. Stanford's final Community Plan
and General Use Permit Application
released on Nov. 15 is virtually the same as
the first draft.
This time the plan includes an academ
ic growth boundary (ACiH) but states.
"Ten years following the delineation of
the ACIH. a comprehensive review should
occur to determine if the ACJB contains at
a minimum sufficient land for the growth
projected over the next 10 years, and if it
does not, to re-establish a minimum 10-
year supply of land within the ACiH."
In other words, the ACiH would not be
permanent and could be re-negotiated in
10 years.
Furthermore, the proposed ACiH
extends west of Junipcro Scrra Boulevard
to include the golf course and the area
around the Behavioral Sciences Center
area is currently designated "aca
demic reserve and open space"). The plan
would allow 20.000 square feet of develop
ment in the foothills over the next 10 years
and potentially much more after that.
If the plan is approved, this area would
be designated "academic campus," allow

preservation of Foothills
As a 30-year resident of this area, I
have found myself at odds with Stanford
on a number of occasions. Throughout
these various episodes, I have always
admired Stanford and remained favorably
disposed toward the institution for one
reason.
Almost every day for the past 30 years
I have traveled hy or hiked on the open
Stanford lands west of Junipero Serra
Boulevard. They have been the daily
reminder for me and thousands of others
that even at its most uncaring, Stanford
and its Trustees have preserved this island
against the encroaching sprawl which has
obliterated so much of the natural beauty
of this area.
II this remaining evidence of this con
tinued commitment to being a good neigh
bor and standing lor values more lasting
than unrestrained growth is lost, I can
assure the Trustees that the well of residu
al good feelings toward Stanford will final
ly go dry. They will have lost not only their
claim that Stanford is a world-class institu
tion but the reservoir of good will that
their stewardship of this priceless asset has
afforded them.
Forever after the name Stanford will be
equated with "Enemy," and those in this
community who have been willing to com
promise with or overlook the Trustees'
often heavy-handed methods will become
Stanford's intransigent foes on every
front.
I urge the Trustees to stale unequivo
cally and for ;ill time their commitment to
the preservation in their present state ol
the foothill lands over which they are the
appointed stewards.

I Irge Stanford to develop in
sustainable manner
B ing a native ol Palo Alto. I have
,ii countless hours running, hiking and
connecting with the wonders of nature in
the Stanford foothills. I have a deep, long
standing bond with this land. Six years
ago. I even sat on those hills to welcome
the morning sun with friends upon gradu
ating from Palo Alto I ligh School.
I nfortunatcly, Stanford's development
plan threatens this precious open space.

not only for its recreational uses but also
for the native plants and animals that
make up the true heritage ol our region.
Stanford is proposing to expand the
core campus into the foothills, allowing
office buildings and urban development to
be built. They are also proposing to
enlarge the campus square footage by
more than one-third of its existing size. All
this without providing permanent open
space protection in the foothills as com
pensation. This glaring oversight must be
rectified if this valley is to keep some of
the magic that makes it a great place to
work, study and live.
I urge people to speak out on this issue
because if we don't, Stanford's plan will
not incorporate permanent protection for
the Foothills, and we will all suffer the
consequences of living in a sprawling
urban jungle.
1 know that Stanford can develop in a
sustainable manner, but we need to let
them know that we will stand for no less.

Land use plan promotes
irresponsible development
In the Community Plan that Stanford
recently submitted, they boldly announced
their plan to start developing the foothills.
They are planning to build 4().<)()() square
feet in the foothills, including a building
for the Carnegie Foundation perched on a
hill above Junipero Serra Boulevard.
Their plan essentially asks for special
treatment. Any other landowner in the
county would face restrictions that would
limit their ability to build so recklessly in
the foothills.
While Stanford has done a tremendous
amount for the region, the University
needs to be held to the same standards as
other developers because its development
causes similar impacts. In addition to fair
ness, Stanford's plan should be judged on
its merits as a planning document.
It is hard to imagine that sprawling the
campus into the foothills makes sense for
Stanford or for the community. Open

space serves many important purposes in
the county, and Stanford should develop
in a way that is sensitive to this value.
I here is a tremendous amount of unde
veloped land on the 1.7(H) acres that make
up Stanford's current core campus area,
and this land is more than sufficient for the
University's current development plans if
plans il used wisely.
While Stanford has the right to develop
its land, it must comply with County goals
and policies that require protection of the
foothills and open space. The County
needs to hold Stanford accountable for the
significant impacts that are going to be
generated from development.
Other developers are routinely
required to dedicate permanent open
space in exchange for development rights,
and Stanford should not be exempt.
Stanford should be allowed to develop
in a responsible way that meets its aca
demic needs if it can do so without damag
ing the surrounding community. The Uni
versity's current plan is a long way from
achieving this.

Athletic Department should
make Rose Bowl tickets free
An article 011 the front page of hist
Monday's Daily talked briefly about how
the Athletic Department "hopes to subsi
dize" the cost of the $115 tickets to the
Rose Bowl 011 Jan. 1.
At first glance, it would seem very cost-
Iv for the Athletic Department to partially
pay for the 33,000 tickets that are avail
able. Hut Stanford Athletics will get a
tremendous sum of money just for appear
ing in the Rose Bowl.
Last year, the payout per team lor the
Rose Bowl was $12.3 million, according to
CNN / SI. That's $12.3 million per team,
regardless of winning or losing.
I! this year's Rose Bowl prize is similar
to last year's, we honestly don't see what
"Rosey dilemma" the Athletic Depart
ment is facing with subsidization of tickets.
In fact, for $12.3 million the Athletic

Department could afford to subsidize the
entire $115 ticket price for all 33,000 tick
ets and still have more than $8.5 million
left over to spend on recruiting, renova
tions and other resources.
This is the biggest thing to happen to
Stanford football fora while, and many
students who are excited about the game
are citing the cost of tickets as being the
biggest obstacle in attending the game.
Senior associate Athletic Director
Cherl Levick was quoted in the article as
saying, "Students are the group we really
want down there." Well, if that's what the
Athletic Department wants, then they can
make it happen by making it easier on our
wallets: Make the tickets available for
free.

Riot police a welcome pres
ence at Big Game
In my four Big Games, 1 have seen a lot
of stupid violence and violence-inducing
behavior come from the "intelligent"
Stanford students that everyone's been
talking so much about.
I've seen students smashed against the
fence in Stanford Stadium, students
pushed down and trampled on the way
down the steps, poorly-aimed fruit thrown
at Cal students that hit the Band, a drunk
en student falling and knocking down
three rows of band members and our stu
dents taunting their students from a few
feet away.
The presence of the riot police at the
game forced our intelligent students to
think twice — or even three times -
about rushing the field. I wouldn't want to
rush the field it I thought there was even a
chance that I might get clubbed and then
arrested. The violence surrounding Big
Game has gotten out of hand in the past
several years, so the administration want
ed to scare us into being good.
It worked. It is likely that the ominous

force of riot police is the only thing that
kept a repeat of the last several years from
happening. The University's actions did
not "make a mockery of the student
body." They merely set up a situation
which virtually assured that no one would
get on the field.
I saw no "blatantly hostile measures,"
nor was there any violence displayed by
the riot police (whose face shields were
down because our students were throwing
oranges and various other projectiles at
them). They merely stood, ready for the
worst.
If the extreme use of police forces truly
"ruined the atmosphere" for fans, those
people should have been paying more
attention to the game. And maybe they
should have been excited that such a force
was present, wondering what would ensue.
I will admit that it was a little scary
watching them parade down the ramp and
position themselves in front of the stu
dents. but once they were there, I had a
perfectly grand time watching the rest of
the game, and I was pleasantly surprised
when 1 was not run over and killed by
mobs of students trying to get past me.
There weren't any.
It was a little disappointing that the
Band was not allowed on the field for their
traditional post-game show, but overall I
was happy. And 1 went home without hav
ing experienced the adrenaline rush that
comes from truly fearing for one's own
physical safety — the fear that I have felt
at my three other Big Games.
We at Stanford try to think that all
riotous behavior at the last few Big Games
is Cal's fault, but we are wrong. We have
been inciting the Cal students to the point
where their aggression and animosity get
the better of them.
Maybe we're not stupid enough to
destroy our own field, tear down their goal
post when we lose, rip apart and beat up
Oski or rush the field full of riot police, but
we're still pretty stupid. It's called mob
mentality, and no one is above it, not even
Stanford students.

Land use should he open for
future changes
Soon after World War 11. the overrid
ing community message to Stanford was to
build housing on its land. After starting
what is now known as the Stanford Mills
subdivision (just to the west of Sand Mill
Road, near the Stanford 1 inear Accelera
tor). the University correctly decided to
keep its foothills in what is called an "aca
demic reserve." I'his opened the way for
the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve and
SI.AC and remains the largest single cate
gory of land use at Stanford.
The academic reserve sets Stanford
apart from all other major American uni
versities. It is In far its most valuable phys
ical asset. I he University would be foolish
to develop it rapidly, denying future gen
orations options that none of us can imag
ine.
Designating certain areas open space
for 10 years recogni/es the community's
strong current consensus. But it also
leaves the door open and quite proper
ly so. in my opinion for future changes
in land use that could prove critical to the
I Jnivorsity, surrounding communities and
the region.
If public officials designate substantial
ly more land permanently as open space,
however popular it is now, the long-term
loss could extend well beyond Stanford's
borders. Short-term, the result could be
deeply divisive — and costly litigation.

Foothills should be set aside
as permanent open spaee
When il comes to protection of the
foothills. Stanford's final Community Plan
and General Use Permit Application
released on Nov. 15 is virtually the same as
the first draft.
This time the plan includes an academ
ic growth boundary (ACiH) but states.
"Ten years following the delineation of
the ACIH. a comprehensive review should
occur to determine if the ACJB contains at
a minimum sufficient land for the growth
projected over the next 10 years, and if it
does not, to re-establish a minimum 10-
year supply of land within the ACiH."
In other words, the ACiH would not be
permanent and could be re-negotiated in
10 years.
Furthermore, the proposed ACiH
extends west of Junipcro Scrra Boulevard
to include the golf course and the area
around the Behavioral Sciences Center
area is currently designated "aca
demic reserve and open space"). The plan
would allow 20.000 square feet of develop
ment in the foothills over the next 10 years
and potentially much more after that.
If the plan is approved, this area would
be designated "academic campus," allow
ing development similar to that on the
core campus.
Stanford should do the right thing for
the community and set aside the foothills
as permanent open space.

Open space preservation
needed
Now is the time for Stanford to show
the vision and leadership that is so often
ascribed to it.
The Land Use Plan currently under dis
cussion will act as a vector for planning
decisions that will guide Mid-Peninsula
communities well into the next century.
The question of open space preservation is
one of the most crucial ingredients feeding
both environmental and social policy plan
ning decisions.
I urge Stanford planners to summon
the courage and wisdom necessary to do
the right thing by offering permanent open
space protection for the Stanford toothills
and drawing a permanent academic
growth boundary at Junipero Serra Boule
vard.

Land use plan lacks vision
Last week Stanford came out with a
revision of its 10-year Land Use Plan. That
plan places both a middle school and mul
tiple new office buildings on the west side
of Junipero Serra Boulevard.
Stanford's plan would generate hun
dreds of new car trips through the city's
busiest intersections because no one lives
near the proposed school site. Parents
would be forced to drive their children to
school, and workers in the proposed new
offices would have to drive just to go out

to lunch.
Most modern city planners have
learned that urban sprawl destroys a place.
Stanford's planners, on the other hand, are
operating as though it were 1950. Back
then, the idea of everyone taking a car
with them everywhere was thought to be
desirable. One of the most valuable
aspects of Palo Alto is that it is a truly
walkable community. Why can't Stanford
honor that instead of trying to destroy it?
If this new plan exhibits no modern
urban planning concepts, it does exhibit
obvious political motivations. In placing
the middle school on formerly designated
open space, Stanford is attempting to pit
the schools supporters against the envi
ronmentalists.
Middle schools need to be near neigh
borhoods, like on Stanford Avenue and El
Camino Real. Office buildings need to be
near services, like at Palm Drive and El
Camino Real. This community values
walkability and open space more than
sprawl. Stanford is a more desirable uni
versity because Palo Alto has succeeded in
preserving these values up until now.
