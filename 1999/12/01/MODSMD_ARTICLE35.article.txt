It's 366 miles to Pasade
na, we've got a full
tank of gas, two coolers
of Water, it's dark and I'm
wearing a skirt.
Hit it.
"Joliet" Jon Stemmle is
putting tiie Stanford Band

together fora Millennium gig at the Pacific
10 conference's own Palace Hotel Ballroom.
All he said he needs is "four whole fried
chickens, some dry white toast and a Coke."
Of course, he's got some help from Tani
eia "You'd better think" Perry, who in her
semi-retirement from drum major has
opened up a soul-food cafe and a Kinko's
downtown.
"I've been saying 'We're going' since
before we left for U$C," Perry said. Even at
the Washington game, where the light was
blocked out momentarily by 73.1 KM) in pur
ple and gold and five guys in zebra suits, she
still saw the light.
And when you're trying to put 2(X) musi
cians on Colorado Boulevard at the dawn
literally — of The Next Thousand Years,
you need a little divine intervention.
Sure, the seniors, the staff, the Old Folks
will be there. They've got their horns uphol
stered in red and white shag, playing their
regular gig at the 1 loliday Inn — er. Shera
ton. They are the nerve center of the
World's Largest Rock and* Roll Band.
But you've gotta get some new horns,
some new blood, if you're gonna shake your
tail feather for five-and-a-half miles and two
field shows.
You need the freshmen. Some say you'll
never net them out of them high-studvin'

gigs and into black- and white-checkered
pantsuits complete with sunglasses.
But they're coming. They've never
spelled out "Austin Roadtrip 1999" in rib
bones at The County Line, seen the Conrad
arid Holly Show or watched Stanford whip
the pants off a favored Big 10 team come
New Years' time.
You remember 1996. Michigan "Oh no,
they run the ball" State. A guy who painted
himself green and biked all the way from
East Lansing.
The score was 38-0 Stanford, and we
were knocking on the door again when
Tyrone called off the dogs and ran out the
clock.
Joliet Jon remembers that year too. After
all. it was knocking over that Norwest Bank
in LI Paso to pay for the Band's Coca-Cola
bill at the Country Bunker that landed him
in the joint in the first place. It drove his
partner, John "Mr. Fabulous" Chase, to
marriage.
Most definitely, the freshmen are going
to be there this year.
"Of course we're on a mission from
God," said Li/. "Puff" Zeratsky, a drummer
who hails from a land where they know
cheese and Badgers: Green Lake, Wise. "It's
the destiny — the Band will play in Pasade
na."
Zeratsky's been thinking "Band road
trip!" since seeing the Band during her
junior year of high school.
"You can't exactly fathom what's going
to happen before you go," she said, "and
you can't quite explain it when you get
back."
"I'll walk out of my room in my polka-

dot disco suit, and people will just look at
me. I don't know if they know I'm in the
Band or not."
Zach "Tiny" Myers, another drummer,
signed on as one of the Band's two roadies
for the next year too.
What he's picked up from Band so far?
As a drum, he explains, "I've learned to use
my left hand as well as my right."
The Band's adventures bring them in too.
"I decided to join the Band when I read
about the Notre Dame thing in Dear
Abby," said tenor sax Alyson "Duct Tape"
Thomas. "I'm Irish and Catholic — I
thought it was hilarious that anyone would
get that upset."
A life-changing moment? "Definitely."
"After the first two weeks" in Band,
Thomas said, "nothing is weird anymore."
Becca "Brat" Katz is an alto sax from
Eau Claire, Wise.
"My mom's really proud of me being in
the Band for some reason," Katz said, even
though "every time I walk into the Band
Shak, I kinda figure I can't explain it to any
one."
The Band, freshmen and all, is ready to
shake things up. The team is plotting to stop
Ron Dayne one down at a time. But there's
one more piece of the puzzle — 33,(XX) tick
ets, waiting for the Cardinal faithful.
Do you see the light?

Evan "Elwood" Nordby wholeheartedly
recommenfls that on your next Blockbuster
night, you review "The Blues Brothers."
He'll be lining up for the Rose Parade with
the rest of the Band at 3 a.m. Jan. I.
