## Habitat flux and mating chances 
### Bruce Wang Editorial staff 
When nature alters the environ
ment, the social hierarchy within an
animal population may change as a
result.
Work by Hans Hofmann, a post
doctorate fellow in Pyschology Pro
fessor Russell Fernald's laboratory
with African cichlid fish has shown
that habitat instability plays a cru
cial role in triggering social interac
tions that may affect social status
and reproduction.
African cichlids, Haplochromis
burtoni, are found naturally in Lake
Tanganyika. The fish reside in shal
low pools that rim the lake's edge.
These ponds are in constant struc
tural flux due to daily winds, falling
leaves and even playful baby hip
pos.
In each habitat, dominant male
cichlids are able to defend territo
ries, which attract females who
enter to graze. Research by Fer
nald's lab has found that constant
fluctuations in habitat cause other
male cichlids to challenge the dom
inant male more often, causing
greater turnover in the dominant
male position.
This result suggests that envi
ronmental changes give a larger
number of males mating opportuni
ties.
While a number of laboratories
study how changes in the brain
affect behavior, the Fernald group
is one of the few laboratories
worldwide that study the opposite
process â€” how changes in behav
ioral interactions can modify cells
in the brain.
The striking physical changes

that accompany social dominance
in male African cichlids make
social status easy to track. Within a
few seconds of beating out another
male, the victor sports an eye stripe
and bright yellow or blue col
oration. These color expressions
are controlled by cells similar to
those of a chameleon.
Over the course of the next sev
eral weeks, the dominant male
undergoes a series of physiological
changes that include increased
muscle development and a dashing
new appearance. Vertical black
bars develop along the body as well
as red coloring on the tip of a dor
sal fin. a black spot on the tip of
each gill cover and a reddish
splotch in the back of each gill.
There is also an approximate
eight-fold increase in brain cells
that produce gonadotropin-releas
ing hormone, a hormone governing
sexual development. This leads to
the maturation of the sex organs,
allowing the dominant male cichlid
to produce sperm.
Importantly, these changes
occur only after the male cichlid
has achieved social dominance and
are a result of his changed social
position rather than a cause.
Although delayed gonad devel
opment in the presence of other
dominant males is often seen in
other animals, the African cichlid is
one of the only organisms where
sexual maturity occurs cyclically.
Creatures such as mandrills and
stoplight parrot fish also exhibit
delayed sexual maturity, but the
cichlid male's sexual maturity can
reverse after losing its position as
the dominant male.
When another male defeats a

dominant male cichlid, the physio
logical changes reverse, changing
the previously territorial fish back
to a muted, female-like appear
ance. Later on, the loser may regain
his dominant position and thus
regain his physical appearance and
sexual potency.
When a male cichlid gains a
dominant position, his behavior
encounters somehow alter his
GnRH-producing brain cells, which
triggers changes in body structure.
The stress-triggered fight-or-flight
hormone Cortisol appears to play a
role as a mediator in this process.
Continuous high levels of Corti
sol are known to keep non-domi
nant males in a female-like physical
appearance, with a nondescript col
oration that is unlikely to attract
predators. Conversely, Cortisol lev
els in dominant fish plummet once
the social system stabilizes.
In humans, a parallel phe
nomenon exists and is responsible
for stress-related dwarfism, or the
"Peter Pan syndrome."
In these cases, children subject
to psychologically toxic conditions
fail to grow even with normal levels
of nutrition. Removal of these chil
dren to a more positive environ
ment results in rapid catchup of
growth in height.
The stunting of growth by high
Cortisol levels could represent the
evolutionary underpinning of this
condition.
The observation that male cich
lid growth rate was related to terri
toriality was made by an undergrad
uate Mark Benson, now a medical
student at Dartmouth. As Benson
cleaned the fish tanks, he inadver
tently disrupted the habitats.

To lest the effect of social domi
nance on growth rate, the investiga
tors placed individually marked
males into aquaria with approxi
mately the same number of
females. To mimic the natural habi
tat in Lake Tanganyika, the aquar
ia were carpeted with gravel, and
flowerpots were arranged in the
tanks to serve as fish hideouts.
The social structure of each fish
community was monitored through
changes in coloration and the
change in male fish size over the
period of one week was recorded.
From their experiments, Fcr
nald's group concluded that an
alternating pattern of weight gain
and loss underlies the cyclical pat
tern of being the winner and then

the loser in male African cichlids.
Non-territorial males grew at a
faster rate than average, while terri
torial males showed slower growth,
and in some cases even shrank in
size.
The losers gained weight faster
than the winners, who were too
involved in territory defense and
mating to eat properly.
This allowed the losers to
become physically stronger and
eventually overcome the dominant
male, thus restarting the cascade of
physical changes.
"With the same genes, you can
get profound phenotypic changes,
probably through differences in
gene expression," said I lofmann.
The information gained from

African cichlid studies may he
broadly applicable across the ani
mal kingdom because of the con
servation of genetic code through
evolution. The gene coding fora
hormone in fish may be similar to
one in humans, and the mecha
nisms of hormonal control may also
be similar. Fernald said.
"We can capture the essence of
how the system works in this fish
model," Fernald said.
The finding could also impact
animal conservation programs.
"Dynamic habitat may give animals
a chance to change social status."
said Fernald. "Making habitats
more constant may result in conse
quences for animals we can't possi
bly anticipate."

African male cichlid fish sport a flashy appearance (bottom) and are sexually mature after becoming
the dominant male. After losing the dominant position, they return to a muted, female-like appearance
(top) and are unable to mate.
