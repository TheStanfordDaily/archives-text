## The 						effects of stress on health 
### Monya De Contributing writer 
In this week of crowded computer clusters, massage
workshops and neurotic chocolate consumption, Stan
ford students really mean it when they let out a primal
scream. Unfortunately, one moment at midnight isn't
enough to protect yourself from the long-term effects
of stress.
Stress is "a physical, mental or emotional reaction to
changes in your life," according to Kaiser I lospitals.
When \he body is faced with an alarming or pressure-

fille.. situation,
chemicals released in
the brain trigger a
"fight-or- flight"
response. Survival of
the human species
was partly depen
dent on this mecha
nism.
That's great if
you're acting in a
Shakespearean play
and really do have to
"Exit, pursued by a
bear." Positive stress
can motivate you to
win a competition or
get out of danger.
Many people love
the excitement of
"working under pres
sure." But humans
get into trouble when
they turn on the
fight-or-flight
response and don't
turn it off.
For instance, you
might feel that your
professors are pursu
ing you as they pile
on the work toward
the end of the quar
ter. The adrenaline
rush that gets you
through papers and

problem sets might he good for your grades, hut your
hody won't escape its detrimental effects.
When you remain in a state of alarm even after the
danger has passed — say your Economics 1 final is over
but Chemistry 31 is coming up in two days — the body
experiences excess wear and tear from pumping blood
too fast and the flood of stress hormones.
Over time, such prolonged reactions to stressful sit
uations without any "down time" can lead to peptic
ulcers, high blood pressure, stroke, heart disease,
migraine headachcs and other ailments.

Robert Sapolsky, professor of biological sciences,
has applied research on baboon glucocorticoids, hor
mones released during stressful periods, to humans. A
simple saliva sample reveals a person or primate's glu
cocorticoid level, which varies directly with the amount
of stress.
The human glucocorticoid Cortisol weakens bacte
ria-eating macrophages in the body. This explains why
we are more likely to get sick during times of prolonged
stress.
In his book "Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers,"
Sapolsky explains that most animals experience stress

only in times of
real danger, such
as being chased by
a cheetah. But
because they don't
have deadlines to
meet and bosses
to impress, ani
mals almost never
display symptoms
of long-term stress
damage.
Sapolsky's
research now indi
cates that gluco
corticoids can even
endanger the brain
bv hastening neu
ron death. This is
especially serious
because neurons
are irreplaceable
cells.
If you notice
that your palms
are sweaty, your
neck and back are
tense, your stom
ach is upset and
you have been
breathing rapidly,
it's probably time
to slow down.
Other indicators of
excessive stress
include cynicism.

depression and a feeling of being besieged.
Successful stress management consists of regular
exercise, reduced caffeine consumption, adequate
sleep, maintenance of a calm work environment and
decisiveness in challenging situations.
Another good tactic is to take notice of what has a
calming effect on you individually. If a certain type of
music or scent makes you feel relaxed, try to have it on
hand for those trying times.
Research also suggests that social support mitigates
stress.
