# Nostrils smell odors differently
## 
### Bruce Wang Editorial staff 
Ever wondered why sometimes
one nostril sucks in air faster than
the other when you breathe? A new
report shows that the difference may
be because your two nostrils smell
things differently.
According to a new study pub
lished by Dr. Noam Sobel and Asso
ciate Professor of Psychology John
Gabrielli, each nostril of the human
nose is tuned to smell some odors
better than others. This specializa
tion may even move back and forth
from one nostril to another.
When consciously sniffing, one
nostril often inhales faster than the
other. The difference in airflow
through the nostrils allows one nos
tril to better detect the odor of some
substance while the other nostril bet
ter detects others.
The nostrils' different percep
tions bear some resemblance to spe
cialization in sight and hearing,
Sobel said. Each eye sees slightly dif
ferently to allow for better depth
perception. Each ear also hears a lit
tle differently, which enables spatial
localization of sounds.
"It's a reasonable assumption
that the difference in nostril percep
tion might be a basis for the funda
mental properties of the sense of

smell, and we are just now finding
out what they are," Sobel said.
According to Sobel, the differ
ences in perception of the nostrils
are very subtle and probably cannot
be detected bv most people. To
establish that there was a difference
between the nostrils, the researchers
mixed equal amounts of two chemi
cals. octane and 1-carvonc, whose
odors are sorbed at different rates.
People in the study were told that
the chemicals were mixed in differ
ent proportions for each trial and
were asked to guess the proportions,
using one nostril at a time, seventeen
of the 20 subjects judged the identi
cal mixture to consist of a greater
proportion of octane when they used
the low-airflow nostril and a greater
amount of 1-carvone when they used
the high-airflow one.
Eight of the subjects were retest
ed several hours later when the high
and low-airflow rates switch nostrils.
The odorant perceptions also
switched.
The model that the researchers
came up with to explain this phe
nomenon is based on the interaction
of airflow and chemical sorption
rates. I or an odor to act on the olfac
tory receptors, it must first cross a
mucous membrane in the nostril, the
mucosa, to reach olfactory receptors.
Blood How to the tissue surrounding

the nostril varies so that when it is
high, the passageway is narrowed,
which slows airflow.
If a high-sorbant chemical is
inhaled by a high-airflow nostril, the
molecules of the odorant will want to
sorb rapidly. However, if they are
flowing along at a fast rate, a lot of
receptors are involved in the
response. On the other hand, if that
same chemical is brought in at a slow
flow rate, it will sorb before it gets
very far. and less receptors will be
involved, resulting in a weaker
response.
According to Sobel. with a low
sorbing odorant at a high How rate,
the fact that the molecules sorb slow
ly probably means most of them
reach the respiratory system and
throat before there is much chance
for the olfactory receptors to detect
them.
"If that same low-sorbing odor
ant comes in slowly, it has time to
sorb, and again you will have a large
nasal portion involved in the
response," Sobel said.
The difference is not as dramatic
as smelling apples with one nostril
and oranges with the other. Sobel
said. "It's a difference subtle enough
that we had to have a careful experi
ment to tease it out."
Researchers haven't established
how often the nostrils switch roles.
