## 
### Alice Brown Editorial staff 
Athletic Department Director
led Leland announced yesterday
that the Athletic Department will be
subsidizing student Rose Bowl tick
ets, allowing students to buy tlieni for
$55 rather than the lull price of $115.
According to Leland, the Athlet
ic Department realized that $115
was probably going to be too expen

sive for many students to afford.
Aside from winning the Rose Bowl,
he said, "our number one priority is
to get a lot of students in the
stands."
Ihe Department's board of direc
tors voted to donate $25(),(XX) to be
used for subsidizing Student tickets.
Leland said S,(HX) tickets have
been reserved for students, and S,(XX)
have been reserved for "partner tick
ets." Students are allowed to buv two

tickets, one for the subsidized price
and the second for full price.
"This was really [head football
coach Tyrone] Willinghams's initia
tive," Leland said.
Tickets go on sale tomorrow at
the Gate 2 ticket office and will be on
sale Friday and Saturday ;is well.
Next week, tickets will be sold Mon
day through Wednesday.
