# Smoking linked to heart disease

Secondhand smoke is linked with lung cancer, heart
disease, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), nasal
sinus cancer and a host of other diseases in both adults
and children, reported a study by the National Cancer
Institute.
Secondhand smoke, or environmental tobacco smoke
(H I S), has been thought to cause lung cancer and a vari
ety of other illnesses as early as 1986. In 1992. the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency reported that second
hand smoke caused lung cancer but that few studies were
available to assess its relationship to heart disease and
other illnesses.
This report, compiled by the California Environmen
tal Protection Agency, includes 18 epidemiological stud
ies linking ETS to coronary heart disease.
" The weight of the scientific evidence is now more
than sufficient to conclude that the relationship between
environmental tobacco smoke and heart disease is real."
said David Satcher. U.S. Surgeon General and Assistant
Secretary for Health.
According to the report, between 35.()0() and 62,000
coronary heart disease deaths occur each year due to
ETS exposure in the U.S.

"ETS exposures are related to much more than heart
disease," said Donald Shopland, coordinator of NCl's
Smoking and Tobacco Control Program.
"When the thousands of ETS-related lung cancers
and other diseases are considered, ETS clearly is a major
cause of death in the United States." Shopland said.
ETS is a complex mixture formed from lighted
cigarettes, pipes and cigars. Thousands of chemicals are
found in the ETS mixture including hydrogen cyanide,
carbon monoxide and do/ens of compounds that are
known carcinogens, tumor promoters or initiators. Many
of these chemicals are identified as hazardous and regu
lated by federal and state agencies.
Some of the most troubling findings in the new report
are those related to increased morbidity and mortality in
children due to their ETS exposure.
The report documents that secondhand smoke is now
associated with SIDS. middle ear infections, asthma,
bronchitis and pneumonia.
The increased risk of SIDS in infants of mothers who
smoke during pregnancy has been shown by several
studies. Some epidemiological studies have now deter
mined that postnatal I TS exposure may be an indepen
dent risk factor for SIDS.
Satcher called on everyone involved in public health
to "renew their efforts in creating a smoke-free society."
