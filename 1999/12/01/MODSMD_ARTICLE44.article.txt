## Stanford makes rosy plans for new year Cardinal squares off with Big 10 champs 
### Tim Kane Contributing writer 
No what-if scenarios lel t.no more close games to sweat
out, no lie-breakers to ponder over. The Stanford Cardi
nal is in the Rose Bowl.
Go ahead and repeat it a couple times — it's the truth.
Take a deep breath il necessary.

FOOTBALL

■ New Year's Day: No. 22 Stanford (N-3) vs. No. 4 Wis
cousin ( I J-2), 2 p.m.. Rose Bowl.

Now thai most people have accepted the fact that the
Cardinal will be battling Wisconsin in Pasadena on New
Year's Day, it's time to concentrate on the issue at hand

the game. In all the hoopla about Stanford making its
first visit to the Rose Howl in 2K years, the relative weak
ness of the Pac-10 and speculation about the Stanford
Band's halftime show, the game tends to be forgotten.
Stanford will enter Pasadena off a momentum build
ing 40-37 win against Notre Dame in its regular-season fi
nale — albeit barely, thanks to a Mike Biselli field goal as
time expired. Quarterback Todd llusak and receiver
Troy Walters gave Badger coaches something to think
about over the holidays as they hooked up for two long
touchdown plavs, and the offense piled up its usual huge
amount of yardage (472 yards) for the game.
Outside of Drew Brees and Purdue. Stanford has the
best passing offense Wisconsin will have seen all season.
In addition to Walters, who was named Pac-10 Offensive
Player of the Year and is a finalist for the Biletnikoff
Award (given to the best wide receiver in college foot
ball). the Cardinal has viable big-play threats in senior
Deßonnie Pitts and junior Dave Davis.
It will be up to Badgers standout cornerback Jamar
Fletcher to contain Walters in all likelihood, hut even
Cal's Deltha O'Neal, a probable All-American, had
problems with the fleet receiver during Big C lame.
All three of Stanford's top receivers have more receiv
ing yards than Wisconsin's leading receiver, Chris ( ham
be rs„ but the Wisconsin offense isn't about passing — it's
all about Ron Duyne. The Badgers' senior tailback will
present a huge problem for Cardinal defensive coordina
tor Kent Baer and his crew.
Although the Stanford defense has done fairly well
against the run — ranked 58th in the country — the squad
hasn't come up against a rushing attack anything like Wis
consin's, which is third in the nation and has played
against perhaps the toughest conference in the country,
the Big 10.
Even worse for the CCardinal, the team may be without
the services of the head "Trench Dog" himself, junior de
fensive tackle Willie Howard. I loward has been the de
fense's most consistent player all year and has made life
miserable for opposing offensive linemen and any run
ning backs going through the middle.
As of press time. 1 loward was scheduled to undergo an
MRI yesterday on the light knee he injured against Notre
Dame, after which his status for the Rose Bowl will be de
termined. Without 1 loward to clog the middle. Daync will
have a much easier time finding gaps in the line, after
which he can use his 4.5 in the 40 speed to streak up the
field.
Stanford's own running game, which enjoyed a revival
of sorts this season altera miserable season last year, may

have problems with Wisconsin's defensive line. The Bad
gers' rushing defense is 33rd in the nation, and sports its
own stout defensive tackle in sophomore defensive tack
le Wendell Bryant, who is about the same si/e as I loward
and causes just as much havoc.
Sophomore Brian Allen lias been the ('ardinal's most
consistent runner all year, though he has gained only 159
yards rushing in the past three games after gaining more
than I(K)yards in consecutive weeks. Junior ( oy Wire and
freshman Kerry Carter will also get carries, but the run
ning backs must keep Wisconsin honest to set up Stan
lord's passing attack.
l or perhaps the tirst time since the team's season
opener against Texas, a 69-17 loss the Cardinal would
rather forget. Stanford will take the field with the entire

nation watching. On all the preview shows, analysts will
point to this stat and that stat and conclude that Stanford
has utterly no chance of slowing down Dayne and the
Badgers as they march to a second consecutive Rose
Bowl victory.
This will be nothing new for the Cardinal — people
have been saying all year the team wasn't good enough to
win this game or that game, that eventually the team
would come back down to earth and be exposed. This
year's squad relishes in being the underdog, and will
march in to Pasadena with every intention of proving
their doubters wrong yet again.
And i! they pull off an upset, people won't have to
think twice about seeing the Cardinal in the Rose Bowl on
New Year's Day.
