No. the squad did not win this
weekend's Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation Tournament, narrowly
ceding the league crown to No. 2
UCLA in an overtime loss. But the
team's fine play was rewarded with
the coveted at-large hid to the na
tional tournament.
And as Stanford head coach
Dante Dettamanti puts it. "We're
disappointed that we didn't win the
tournament, hut we're excited to go

to the NC 'A As and have another shot
at UCLA. I would definitely trade a
win at the MPSF Tournament fora
win at the NCAAs."
The Cardinal's road to the nation
al tournament began Friday as Stan
ford (21 -5) took on No. 5 Pepperdine
(12-14). Three goals from senior
Brian I leifferon and excellent team
defense highlighted the game for
Stanford. The score was knotted at
two after the first quarter, but then
Stanford's defense kept the Waves
scoreless until there were only two
minutes remaining in the game. The
result was a 6-3 C Ordinal victory.
After the first-round win. the Car
dinal was expecting to see No. I I ISC
in Saturday's semifinal. However, in
the tournament's biggest upset, the
No. 7 University of the Pacific (14-
13) beat the Trojans 9-8, earning a
second-round meeting with the Car
dinal.
"To avoid USC in the semifinal
game was a big break for us." Dctta
manti said.
Led by seniors Jon Skaalen and
Andy Walburger. who each had two
goals, the Cardinal notched another
tournament victory, N-ft.
Against the Tigers, Stanford final
ly broke its month-long scoring
slump, with six different players com
bining to score eight goals. The offen
sive output and continued good de
fense prevented Pacific from ever
taking a lead, but the Tigers stayed
close. The insurance goal came at the
beginning of the fourth period when
Pacific's defense crashed on holeman
Peter Hudnut, who kicked the ball
out to an open Jeff Nesmith, who
used a spinner lob to put the ball into
the net.
The semifinal win earned Stan
lord a spot in Sunday's final against
No. 2 11(1 A. More importantly, the
victory assured the ( 'ardinal a spot in

this weekend's national tournament.
Sunday's winner would receive the
spot reserved for the MPSF Champi
on, while the loser would receive the
at-large bid for the team with the best
remaining record in the nation.
Knowing that his team was a lock
for the NCAAs, Dettamanti decided
to play everyone who had made the
trip. The result was impressive.
"We played a very good game,
probably our best game in a month,"
Dettamanti said.
Fans at Sunday's game were also
pleased, witnessing an exciting game
that included eight ties and an over
time period. Stanford got on the
board first and led more often than
the Bruins. In fact, the Cardinal led as
time wound down in the fourth quar
ter and again after the first overtime
period. However, two goafs by
UCLA's Blake Wellen with 57 and
two seconds left in the second over

time lifted UCLA to a 12-11 victory.
Seven different players scored, all
five seniors and the two freshmen.
Their fine play also earned seniors
Heifferon and Sean Joy and redshirt
freshman goalie Nick Ellis All Tour
nament honors.
While the loss in the title game
dropped Stanford's record to 1-3
against the Bruins this season, the
close game "showed the guys that
we're capable of beating UCLA."
I lowever. before the Cardinal gets
a rematch with the Bruins, the team
will have to beat No. 9 UC-San Diego
(19-10) in the NCAA's first round.
The Tritons, the NCAA tournament
hosts, earned the third seed by win
ning the Western Water Polo Associ
ation title. Stanford and UC-San
Diego have met twice this season at
the SoCal and NorCal Tournaments.
Stanford claimed both matches, 7-5
and 13-4.
