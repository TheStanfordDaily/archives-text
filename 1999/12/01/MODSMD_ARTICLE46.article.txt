Tradition. A national following. New Year's Day
howls on a regular basis. Everything Notre Dame foot
ball stands for, Stanford and head coach Tyrone Will
ingham aspire to achieve.

FOOTBALL

■ Saturday: No. 22 Stanford (8-3) 40, Notre Dame (5-7)
37.

No wonder Willingham is smiling more these days. In
this magical season lor the Cardinal, the roles have been
reversed. This year, Stanford is the one with the winning
record. This year, Stanford is the one playing on New
Year's Day — in the Rose Bowl. And this year. No. 22
Stanford is simply better than Notre Dame.
Putting an exclamation point on its Pacific 10 Con
ference championship season in front of a national tele
vision audience, Stanford (<S-3) squeezed by the lighting
Irish (5-7) 40-37, as junior kicker Mike Biselli calmly
booted a 22-yard field goal through the uprights with
time expiring. The Stanford offensive juggernaut rolled
up its usual massive amount of yardage, with senior
quarterback Todd I lusak throwing for 334 yards on 24-
of-34 passing and senior Hanker Troy Walters hauling in
six passes for 183 yards. In his final game in Stanford Sta
dium. Walters also caught two touchdown passes and
added the Pac-10 record for single-season receiving
yardage to his long list of accomplishments at the Farm.
"It feels great to come back after an emotional win
last week [over Cat] and still play well in my last game. It
shows the character of this team, never quitting." Wal
ters said.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, the one thing that no
Stanford fan wanted to happen in this meaningless game
did — an injury to an important player. Standout junior
defensive tackle Willie Howard went down with a knee
injury at the end of the first quarter, which was later di
agnosed as a strained right knee and will be further eval
uated later in the week. Not having 1 foward to face Wis-
consin running back Ron Dayne in
the Rose Bowl would be a huge ob
stacle for the Cardinal to overcome
— a point driven home when Notre
Dame began piling up rushing

yardage in Howard's absence.
Stanford jumped out to a 14-0 lead
in the first 1 minute. 28 seconds. The
Cardinal would add a field goal later
in the quarter, but the Irish scored on
a one-yard touchdown run by Tony
Fisher at the end of the first quarter.
Left uncovered by the Stanford
secondary. Fisher struck again a

minute into the second quarter on a
42-vard touchdown pass from Jarious
Jackson to cut the lead to 17-14.
Biselli made a 47-yard field goal, but
Fisher gave the Irish their first lead at
21-20 on a nine-yard run.
Biselli. in what was becoming a
common sight, kicked a 34-yard field
goal at the end of the first half to give

the Cardinal a halftimc lead, at 23-21.
Julius Jones staked Notre Dame
to a 29-23 lead with a 24-yard run
early in the third quarter, but Stan
ford retook the lead on a beautiful
play-action pass from 1 lusak to Wal
ters, good for 39 yards, a touchdown,
and a 30-29 lead. Later in the quarter
Cardinal backup quarterback Joe
Borchard. giving Husak a breather,
faked the handoff to Coy Wire and
ran untouched into the end zone on a
bootleg to put Stanford up at 37-29.
The Notre Dame offense took ad
vantage of a fumble by Stanford
sophomore tailback Brian Allen and
drove 32 yards to cut the Card's lead
to 37-35 before the point after. A two
point conversion by Irish flanker
Joey Getherall tied the score at 37
with 1:32 left.
Utilizing the clock brilliantly,
I lusak moved the Stanford offense
down the field quickly — 15 yards to
junior wideout Dave Davis, a 15-yard
roughing the passer penalty on the
Irish. 11 yards to Davis again, 20
yards to senior wideout Deßonnie
Pitts, setting up Biselli for his game
winning kick.
"Walking in tonight, it's a sad
thing to think about that we'll never
go out |on the Stanford field] in Stan
ford colors. At the same time. I
couldn't be happier with the legacy
that we've left. II you asked four
years ago how I'd like to go out
beating Notre I Dame and going to the
Rose Bowl as Pac-10 Champions, it
couldn't have worked out any bet
ter." Husak said.
