ANAI II IM. Calif. Auburn's Chris I'orter and Ma

! lie Cardinal kept itself undefeated by once again win
ning the rebounding battle and playing good defense —
Stanford had 17 more rebounds than Auburn and kept the
Tigers at less than 30 percent shooting from the field. And
though the team sometimes looked shaky against
Auburn's pressing defense, Stanlord was able to adjust,
committing only three turnovers in the second half alter
giving it away 13 times in the first.
"I knew it would be physical," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. Hut "as long as you defend and as long
as you board, you can win basketball games."

Freshman Curtis Borchardt blocks a shot under the basket In the Cardinal's stunning
67-58 victory over then-No. 2 Auburn. It was one of Borchardt's four blocks.
with foul trouble, added only two
points of his own.
Borchardt's defensive presence
could account for some of that. The
6-foot, 11-inch center recorded four
blocks, including one on Porter that
sent a stunning message. As Porter
attacked the hoop with the ball
raised in pure dunking form. Bor
chardt reached his long arms over
Porter's famous afro and smacked
the ball off the backboard.
But it was Borchardt's offense
that was even more surprising and,
possibly, even niyre important.
With just under three minutes left
and Stanford nursing a one-point
lead, he hit an IN-footer from the left
baseline to push the C 'ardinal lead to
three. After Auburn senior Doc
Robinson knocked down a three
pointer to tie it. Borchardt countered
with a three of his own.
laking the pass from sophomore
Cony (iiovacchini at the top of the
key with the game tied and only one
and a half minutes on the clock, the
freshman didn't bat an eye, living

Stanford a three-point lead it would
never relinquish.
"I missed one earlier in the sec
ond half and I told myself if I was
open, I wouldn't hesitate to shoot
again," said Borchardt, who led
Stanford with 15 points. "In high
school, I shot whenever I was open
and here I'll shoot when I'm open."
Stanford should not have needed
such heroics, though. Alter scratch
ing out a nine-point lead with nine
minutes left in the second half, the
Cardinal looked to be in control of
the game.
But within seconds, the'momcn
tum was gone. The lead was soon to
follow.
First senior guard David Moseley
was called fora foul on the offensive
end. Moments later, he was called for
a flagrant foul for knocking
Auburn's Scott Pohlman to the
ground as Pohlman tried to run
through the lane.
After Pohlman sank one of two
free throws, he was fouled on the en
suing play by junior Jarron Collins.
The call set off Montgomery, who
was called fora technical foul.
Pohlman. who led the Tigers with
21 points, made all four free throws

two for the foul, two for the tech
nical — a three-pointer from the
baseline on the ensuing play and
then a 16-foot jumper to give
Auburn a 50-49 lead with 6:52 to go.
"I made a stupid play," Mont
gomery said, referring to the techni
cal. "The kids had enough guts and
toughness and mental courage to
come through."
The toughness was more than ap
parent.
As Porter and N'diaye attempted
to assert themselves inside, Bor
chardt and the Collinses held their
ground, egged on a hit by Moseley.
"Their intensity and manner of
play is in your face and you can't
back down." said Jarron Collins, who
posted 13 points and six rebounds.
"At the beginning of the game, we
were kind of'quiet. But then Moseley
started talking and they started talk
ing back and things started heating
up."
"The personality of our team is a
little reserved," Mosely said. "But
I'm the type of player who won't take
that. I like street ball. I like to play on
the concrete. II they want to try and
intimidate us. we can play that
game."

Cal State-Bakersfield, who Stan
ford played in a tuneup last Wednes
day. did not exactly elicit the same
kind of intensity. Though the Road
runners are a power in Division 11.

Borchardt recorded a school
record six blocks and walk-on senior
Alex Gelbard. a long-time crowd fa
vorite, scored a career-high five
points on perfect 2-for-2 shooting, in

Stanford will have a much easier
road over winter break.
Dec. 11, the Cardinal travels to
Atlanta to take on Georgia Tech (3-

inside game featuring Alvin Jones
and Indiana transfer Jason Collier.
However, in Tech's 84-70 loss to
Kansas Saturday night, Jones some
times looked lost and Collier ap
peared to be trying too hard to carry
