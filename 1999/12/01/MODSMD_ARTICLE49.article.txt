### Ellie Ritch Contributing writer 
The No. 2 Stanford women's vol
leyball team has its sights set on
spending winter break in Hawaii.
The thought of travelling to Hawaii
is always sweet for these 13 women,
but it is an even sweeter thought
when it means travelling to the 1999
Final Four.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL

■ Thursday: NCAA first round: No.
2 Stanford (26-2) vs. Florida Atlantic
(17-2), 7:30 p.m.. Maples Pavilion.

The Cardinal (26-2) received the
top seed in the Pacific Regional
bracket of the 1999 NCAA
Women's Volleyball Tournament
on Sunday night. The team held a
special dinner after practice and
waited to hear its tournament status
as a whole.
Stanford sets out on the long
road toward Hawaii and its fifth na
tional title of the decade this week,
as it hosts the first two rounds of
tournament action. The Cardinal
matches up against Florida Atlantic
(17-12) at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday at
Maples Pavilion.
Santa Clara (20-10) will play
Cincinnati (28-6) in a first-round
match on Thursday at 5:00 p.m. The

winners of Thursday's matches will
play on Friday at 7:(X) p.m. Should
Stanford prevail in the first two
rounds, it will maintain home-court
advantage for the third and fourth
rounds, scheduled for next week
end.
Thursday will mark the first time
that the Cardinal squad has faced
Florida Atlantic, and the team will
watch films in order to prepare for
Florida's style of play. One problem
with the Pacific Regional is that
there are many teams that the Car
dinal has already played this season.
As head coach Don Shaw ex
plained. "There are a number of
teams we have already played in
our region. Santa Clara is a pretty
solid team. There is a good chance
we could see Santa Clara. Arizona,
and Texas again in the first few
rounds of the tournament."
Cincinnati is another team that
Stanford has yet to play, a team that
is known for its somewhat untradi
tional strategies. But Shaw will have
his team prepared.
"I've been watching their tapes
in case we match up against them in
the second round. They run a lot of
one-foot attacks where the middle
hitters run the attacks in front of the
setter. They will also be hard to
block because they move their set
ter around so frequently."

Although the Cardinal defeated
Santa Clara last Tuesday (15-7, 15-
12,15-5), it is not a team to overlook
either.
"Even though we won in three
[games] last week, they made us
work for everything," Shaw said.
Stanford's region is certainly
viewed as tough, if not the toughest
of the allotted groupings.
"If all goes according to seeding,
we will be competing against very
strong teams such as UC-Santa Bar
bara. Nebraska, and Texas in the
third and fourth rounds," Shaw
said.
The other top seeded teams of
the tournament include No. 1 Penn
State (Central Regional), No. 3
Hawaii (Mountain Regional) and
No. 5 Pacific (East Regional). A
further advantage of the Cardinal's
top seed in the region is that Stan
ford cannot possibly face the other
three top seeds until the Final Four.
Stanford will look to senior out
side hitter Kerri Walsh and fresh
man outside hitter Logan Tom to
lead the squad on the path toward
Hawaii throughout the next two
weeks of competition.
Walsh was recently named Pac
-10 Player of the Year for the second
straight year and is in the running
for 1999 National Player of the
Year. Tom has already made her

self known on the collegiate scene
by being selected as the Pac-10
Freshman of the Year.
The home-court advantage has
proven prosperous in the past for
the Cardinal, as it has now won 41
home matches in a row, and 91 out
of its last 92 at Maples. Stanford
looks to take advantage of the
home -court bonus it has earned as
a result of its competitive play and
hard work throughout regular sea
son.
Last year, the Cardinal did not
have a strong enough season to re
ceive home court advantage for the
NCAA tournament. Stanford fal
tered in the early rounds of the 1998
NCA As in part because of the diffi
culty of playing a top team in an
away match, especially during post
season competition.
Shaw expressed that the NCAA
committee had done quite a good
job with the seedings this year. A
national board puts together the
brackets based on win-loss records,
strength of schedule, and oppo
nent's strength of schedule.
"I was only surprised at a couple
of things," Shaw said. "One, that
none of the other regions is as deep
as ours; and two, that the Big 10 got
eight of its teams in while other de
serving teams were not taken into
consideration."
