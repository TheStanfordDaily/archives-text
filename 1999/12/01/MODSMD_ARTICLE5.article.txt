# Stanford's First Lady
## University a tribute to Jane Stanford's presence 
### Nadira Hira Contributing writer 
Editor's note: This is the fifth in a
scries of five articles commemorating
the five most important people in
Stanford's history. At No. I is Jane
Stanford. After the passing of her hus
band and University founder Leland
Stanford, she managed the University,
seeing it through a period of financial
worry. Her dedication to the areas of
education, women's rights and chari
ty, as well as her perseverance in mak
ing Stanford a top-level University,
distinguish Jane Stanford as the Uni
versity's most important person of the
20tlt century.

"The legend of Jane Stanford is
remarkable," said School of I luman
ities and Sciences Dean Malcolm
Beasley. "I suspect the reality is pret
ty amazing, too."
Certainly few would argue with
the former statement and.in these
days of frenzied progress and fading
history.
In 1893. in the face of sweeping fi
nancial panic, the overwhelming task
of starting a successful university and

her own grief at her husband's death,
Jane Stanford managed to save the
University that she and her husband
had dreamed of and put it well on its
way to international fame.
Throughout this time. Jane Stan
ford remained a friend of the
women's movement, an advocate for
underprivileged children and a
strong supporter of quality education
for students of all classes.
"Students today owe a real debt of
gratitude to Jane," said University
Archivist Maggie Kimball. "She re
fused to allow the University to close
when legal and financial problems
seemed insurmountable. She made
sure that Stanford would survive her
and carry on far into the future."
A privileged childhood
Jane Eliza Lathrop was born on
Aug. 25. 1828 in Albany, NY. the

great-granddaughter of Reverend
John Lathrop, the minister of Old
South Church in Boston, whose ser
mon led to the revolutionary Boston
Tea Party.
The child of relatively wealthy, so
cially aware parents. Jane Lathrop
was brought up in a very duty-con
scious and religious household. She
was educated at the Albany Female
Academy, which provided Jane with
;i solid educational background that
was standard for women of her status
;il the time. Jane was being educated
at the time the American women's
movement was beginning to gain mo
mentum.
life with J-cliiikl
Oil Sept. 30, I<S5(). when Jane was
22. she married Leland Stanford, an
enterprising young lawyer and a fel

low Albany resident of similar family
background. After a number of
moves that went from Michigan to
California and back to Albany, the
Stanfords finally settled in California,
where Leland was named president
of the new Central Pacific Railroad
Company of California and inaugu
rated governor of California on Jan.
10.1862.
Leland served one term as gover
nor before dedicating his energy en
tirely to the railroad and achieving a
great deal of success there. In the
midst of Leland Stanford's growing
fame and fortune, Leland Stanford
Jr.. the Stanfords' first child after IS
years of marriage, was born on May
14. IX6B.
The Stanfords raised their son
with the express goal in mind of
grooming him to fill his father's busi
ness positions. His academic curiosi
ty. particularly in the areas of foreign
language and historical collecting,
was greatly encouraged, which often
resulted in a great deal of travel for
Leland Jr.
It was on one such trip that the
Stanford heir became ill with typhoid
fever and died on March 13. 1884, in
Florence, Italy, two months before
his 16th birthday.
Founding of a dream
This tragedy, along with Leland
Sr.'s dream, in which he woke with
the words, "The children of Califor
nia shall he our children." on his lips,
prompted the Stanfords to found a
university in their son's honor.
Within a year of his son's death.
Leland Sr. became a California sena
tor and established plans for the Uni
versity. The Stanfords appointed a
Board of Trustees and David Starr
Jordan was named the University's
first president after leaving his post as
president at Indiana University.
The University opened on Oct. 1.

1891, six years after the Stanfords
founded it. with 465 students of both
sexes and 15 instructors. Although
Jane Stanford had agreed and
planned to speak at the University's
opening, she chose not to. and Inter
wrote to Jordan explaining why.
In her letter, quoted in (iunther
Nagel's 1975 book "Jane Stanford:
I Icr Life and Letters," she explained.
"My heart grew faint at such an or
deal, and I could not bring my mind to
face such an audience and read this
address."
She also enclosed a copy o! the ad
dress she had planned to read.
"While Mr. Stanford has dilated
on book education," she wrote, "I de
sire to impress upon the minds of
each one of these students, both male
and female, that we have at heart and
very closely hope that you will each
strive to place before yourselves a
high moral standard; that you will re
solve to go forth from these class
rooms determined in the future to be
leaders with high aims and pure stan
dards; and live such lives that it will be
said of you that you are true to the
best you know."
Jane Stanford on co-education
Jane Stanford also paid particular
attention in her address to the matter
of co-education, which she under
stood to be central to the I Jniversity's
mission.
"Jane Stanford and her husband
[were| committed to gender equity at
Stanford, something rare at the time
of the founding of the University,"
said School of 1 ducation Dean
Richard Shavelson.
Jane Stanford wrote in her ad
dress, "I am also anxious that these
young men should treat the young
ladies who have entered this institu
tion with the greatest deference;" she
wrote, "that they will be helpful in
aiding and cheering them in their am
bition fora thorough education.
"We have started you both on the
same equality, and we hope for the
best results."

Coping with death
Shortly after the University's
opening, after spending a consider
able amount ol time traveling to dif
ferent spas in hopes of bolstering Le
land Stanford Sr.'s ailing health, the
Senator died in his sleep on June 21.
1K93 at the age of 69. Jane Stanford
was 65 at the time.
Jane Stanford described the days
following the Senator's death some
years later in her dedication for the
Thomas Wclton Stanford Library,
dated Nov. I. IN9B.
She said ol the time after her hus
band's death. "There followed this
dreadful sorrow , developments and
experiences such as the world could
not understand or believe. ... Fora
while I fell like one on a sinking ship
on a tempestuous sea ... 1 wanted to
join my loved ones and was not afraid
to die.
"Suddenly there loomed up be
fore me the blessed work left to my
care by my loved ones, and I felt that
my course was cowardly. I was so im
pressed by the new light which
dawned over me it brought the first
tears to my eyes."
Jane Stanford had played an equal
role in plans for the University, but
maintained her role as wife and
mother as her central occupation.
I lowever. with the death of her hus
band. Jane Stanford stepped into the
toreground to carry their shared
dream.
Financial troubles
I his proved to be a more difficult
task than anyone could have antici
pated. Iceland Stanford Sr.'s estate
was tied up in probate court, which
meant that officials were evaluating
the distribution of the estate's wealth
and this money could not be used
until the process was complete. Since
the Stanfords were using their per
sonal funds tooperate the University,
there were no moneys available from
the estate to keep the University run

ning.
Although the Stanfords had in
tended the estate to essentially serve
as the University's endowment, this
had not been documented formally,
so the Court could not recognize that
the estate had any monetary respon
sibility to the University.
To make matters worse, the entire
country was in the throes of a finan
cial panic that threatened to bank
rupt all the Western railroads, includ
ing the Central Pacific Line of which
Leland Stanford Sr. had been presi
dent.
Anticipating this disaster, the U.S.
government filed suit against the
Stanford estate, demanding that all
outstanding railroad construction
loans be paid immediately. None of
the loans were due yet and. thus, it
seemed that the government had no
legal grounds for their case, but the
outcome of the lawsuit was still un
certain.
Everyone concerned with the af
fair advised and expected Jane Stan
ford to close the University. They saw
no way to operate the University
without a reliable source of funding.
Working through the problems
After two weeks of seclusion and
meditation following Leland Stan
ford Sr.'s death, Jane Stanford an
nounced that the University would
remain open with the $ 1 ().(KK) award
ed her bv the probate court for the es
tate's regular monthly expenses.
Though the estate had spent this
full amount in the past. Mrs. Stanford
trimmed the estate's expenses to
$350. keeping only three household
personnel of an original group of 1 7.
The remaining balance, in addition to
the income from students' $20 regis
tration fee. was used to pay professor
salaries, which were reduced by 10
percent, and also served to keep the
University afloat.
Upholding the Stanfords' original
plan for the University, Jane Stanford
chose not to require students to pay
tuition. She explained her reasoning

later in an Oct. 3, 1 1 >()2. address that
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya discussed.
"She described the University as a
place that should 'resist the tendency
to the stratification of society." "
Montoya said. "Mrs. Stanford be
lieved that the University should be
open to deserving students coming
from all stations of life, and that a
spirit of equality should be main
tained within the University."
This decision against tuition re
mained in effect until 1920 and. ac
cording to Montoya. "our financial
aid program allows us to stay true to
her vision."
Jane Stanford also resolved to
honor her husband's wish of running
the University without soliciting
funds from sources beyond the es
tate. This decision did not remain
long, as many faculty members, and
finally, Jane Stanford herself, were
forced to seek outside support for
their specific needs.
Meanwhile, since the government
had filed its suit against the Stanford
estate on June 3. 1894, two years
passed with the district and circuit
courts, which found in favor of Stan
ford. The circuit court decision was
long in coming, however, and the
University had little time to spare.
Faced with these circumstances.
Jane Stanford traveled to Washing
ton to seek President (irover Cleve
land's help in expediting the circuit
court process so as to make the
Supreme ( ourt 's October calendar.
"She told him our story." recount
ed University President Jordan in his
March I l *) 1 ) Founders' Day speech in
honor of Jane Stanford, "and bc
seechcd him to use his influence fora
speedy settlement.... At last. Presi
dent Cleveland saw his duty, and
through his influence the Stanford
case was placed on the calendar of the
United States Supreme Court for
speedy trial."
Despite her efforts, many still ac
cused Jane Stanford of keeping the
Stanford fortune for her own use. She

responded to this in a letter dated
Nov. 24. 1895, which Jordan quoted
in hisspeeeh.
"It has been my policy to say as lit
tie about my financial affairs to the
outside world as possible, but 1 leel
sure that I am doing myself and our
blessed work injustice by allowing the
impression among all classes to feel
certain there is plenty of money at m\
command, the future is assured, the
battle fought and won.
"I only ask righteous justice. I ask
not for myself, but that I may be able
to discharge my duty and loyalty to
the one who trusted me, and loved
me, and loves me still. I am so poor
myself that I cannot this year give to
any charity; not even do I give this fes
tive season to any of my family."
Students, perhaps more than any
others, felt the impact of Jane Stan
ford's struggle.
In a letter dated Jan. 28. 1896.
C harles Burncll of the 1895 Pioneer
Class (the University's first gradual
ing class), wrote to Jane Stanford.
"We of '95, who have seen the
I 'niversity at its birth, who have seen
its noble founders watching over it
with such loving care, whose future
lives have been shaped by its influ
ence," he wrote, "we of '95 watch
with you for the first break of dawn
that shall end the long night of watch
ing. waiting, hoping, and fearing."


Jane Stanford
On March 2, 18%, the Stanford
community received the news that
the long night had ended.
The Supreme Court ruled unani
mously in favor of Jane Stanford in
the case of United States of America
vs. Jane L. Stanford, Executrix.
Jane Stanford released a state
ment to the ecstatic students.
"I thank you one and all for your
loyalty throughout the past year of
doubt and uncertainty and now you
can rejoice to your heart's content
while I will quietly remain at home
and be thankful."
This put Stanford at the end of its
"Dark Days," as Jordan called them.
However, there were still more than
$7 million of debt to be paid and, with
Jane Stanford nearing 70, many wor
ried she would not live to pay all of it.
Jane Stanford was determined to
see the University succeed, however.
"At one time, we have the pathet
ic figure of the good woman going to
the Queen's Jubilee in London, with
all her own possessions, half a million
dollars' worth of jewels, in a suit case
carried in hand," remembered Jor
dan in his Founders' Day speech.
"She hoped to sell these to advan
tage, when all the world was gathered
in London. But the market was good,
and three-fourths of them she
brought back to California again."
After much sacrifice and work.

Jane Stanford and others finally man
aged to put the University back into
working order in 1898.
Building up the University
By 1848. Jordan and Jane Stan
lord. who had spent the Universi
ty's early years struggling to keep it
alive, found themselves at odds
about how to continue building the
University.
Jane Stanford saw no reason for
extensive expansion, while Jordan
thought growth was essential to en
suring the University's success.
Former Stanford history doctor
al student Roxanne Nilan. author
of "The Tenacious and Courageous
Jane L. Stanford," printed in the
Winter 1985 edition of Sandstone
and Tile, writes that Jordan and
Jane Stanford disagreed often and
battled over each expense every
year, but outwardly the relation
ship remained mutually respectful.
In addition. Jane Stanford trav
eled considerably and, thus, left
much of the daily workings of the
University to Jordan, which suited
him, according to Nagel.
Despite Jane Stanford's feelings
about unnecessary expansion, she
remained devoted to realizing her
husband's architectural goals for
the University.
To this end. she took charge of
what later came to be called the
Stanford "stone age." overseeing
the building of Memorial Church.

which, according to Nilan, she felt
had a crucial influence upon stu
dents' development.
"The church stood not fora par
ticular doctrine, but for moral con
science," writes Nilan.
Nilan quotes Jane Stanford:
"Don't think that I believe that any
particular creed or that even the
church itself is capable of making
saints of some folks.
"Such things are not matters of
creed; ... 1 mean that men and
women should be sound at the
core, whatever their doctrines may
be."
Jane Stanford also oversaw the
building of the museum, and a li
brary and gymnasium, all along
Palm Drive. The library and gym
nasium were greatly damaged in
the 1906 earthquake.
For these new buildings, Jane
Stanford deviated from the original
campus scheme and chose a neo
classical style of architecture.
She chose to build the library
and gymnasium along Palm Drive,
away from the Main Quad and out
side the original plan, to balance
against the existing museum and
chemistry buildings.
In her later years. Jane Stanford
became more involved in the gen
eral workings of the University.
"She had her own ideas as lo
what needed to be done and was
not afraid to speak her mind and
see that work was done." said Kim
ball.

Women at the University
One of Jane Stanford's greatest
concerns during this period sur
rounded the moral reputation of
Stanford students, particularly the
women. She expressed a strong belief
that the University should adopt a
code of rules for students so that out
siders could not question the Univer
sity's stance on proper conduct.
The Board of Trustees avoided
formalizing this request and the Uni
versity's Advisory Board eventually
decided against it.
Some questions also arose sur
rounding Jane Stanford's feelings
about women's rights. This resulted
from Jane Stanford's decision to cap
the number of female students admit
ted to the University at 500.
At the time of her decision in 1899,
the University's student body was 40
percent female.
Though many interpreted this as a
move against women. Jane Stanford
later explained that she began the
University with women in mind, but
she did not wish for it to gain a repu
tation as a "women's school."
Although she was an ardent sup
porter of the women's rights move
ment, Jane Stanford felt that the ris
ing percentage of women at the Uni
versity would be inappropriate at a
school memorializing her son.
Also, she felt that a University
with a high percentage of women
would be looked down upon by peer
institutions, such as Harvard and
Yale Universities, which were still not

admitting women.
Concern for child welfare
Jane Stanford also continued her
interest in child welfare. In 1899, she
donated the Sacramento home that
had served as the Stanfords' "gover
nor's mansion" as a day nursery for
children of single parents in the
Sacramento area.
She also established and main
tained six free kindergartens in San
Francisco, serving more than 600 un
derprivileged children of both sexes.
In addition to the six San Francisco
based schools, she also supported one
in Menlo Park and one in Mayfield.
In an interview with the Cheyenne
Sun in Feb. 1892 quoted by Psycholo
gy Prof. Alberta Siegel in her
Founder's Day speech on Apr. 5.
1998, Jane Stanford explained how
her interest in children's issues began.
After supporting a preschool for
disadvantaged children in San Fran
cisco. she visited the school with her
son and brought gifts for the children.
"1 had lived all my life up to that
time entirely lor my own pleasures,
but the experience of that day and the
joy expressed by the children over the
insignificant gilts I had brought them
... opened my eyes to a phase of life
that 1 did not realize existed, and I
thank God I have never closed them
since." Jane Stanford said.
"When we came out. my boy said
'Mamma. 1 think that is the best thing
you ever did in your life.' My whole
life changed from that hour."

Her legacy
In the end it was this love of young
people and a commitment to their de
velopment that motivated Jane Stan
ford to achieve the goals she and her
husband set when their son died.
"I could lay down my life for the
University," she wrote in a letter
dated Dec. 14, 19(X). quoted by Jor
dan in his Founder's Day speech.
"Not for any pride in its perpetu
ating the names of our dear son and
ourselves, its founders," she contin
ued. "but for the sincere hope I cher
ish in its sending forth to the world
grand men and women who will aid in
developing the best there is to be
found in human nature."
Jane Lathrop Stanford died on
Feb. 28,1905, at the age of 76 while on
holiday in Honolulu.
At that time, Jordan, her long
time personal friend and sometime
business rival, said. "No one outside
the University can understand the
difficulties in her way in the final es
tablishment of the University, and
her patient deeds of self sacrifice can
be known only to those who saw
them from day to day.
"Some day the world may under
stand a part of this. It will then know
her for the wisest, as well as the most
generous, friend of learning in our
time."

from all stations of life, and that a
spirit of equality should be main
tained within the University."
This decision against tuition re
mained in effect until 1920 and. ac
cording to Montoya. "our financial
aid program allows us to stay true to
her vision."
Jane Stanford also resolved to
honor her husband's wish of running
the University without soliciting
funds from sources beyond the es
tate. This decision did not remain
long, as many faculty members, and
finally, Jane Stanford herself, were
forced to seek outside support for
their specific needs.
Meanwhile, since the government
had filed its suit against the Stanford
estate on June 3. 1894, two years
passed with the district and circuit
courts, which found in favor of Stan
ford. The circuit court decision was
long in coming, however, and the
University had little time to spare.
Faced with these circumstances.
Jane Stanford traveled to Washing
ton to seek President (irover Cleve
land's help in expediting the circuit
court process so as to make the
Supreme ( ourt 's October calendar.
"She told him our story." recount
ed University President Jordan in his
March I l *) 1 ) Founders' Day speech in
honor of Jane Stanford, "and bc
seechcd him to use his influence fora
speedy settlement.... At last. Presi
dent Cleveland saw his duty, and
through his influence the Stanford
case was placed on the calendar of the
United States Supreme Court for
speedy trial."
Despite her efforts, many still ac
cused Jane Stanford of keeping the
Stanford fortune for her own use. She

responded to this in a letter dated
Nov. 24. 1895, which Jordan quoted
in hisspeeeh.
"It has been my policy to say as lit
tie about my financial affairs to the
outside world as possible, but 1 leel
sure that I am doing myself and our
blessed work injustice by allowing the
impression among all classes to feel
certain there is plenty of money at m\
command, the future is assured, the
battle fought and won.
"I only ask righteous justice. I ask
not for myself, but that I may be able
to discharge my duty and loyalty to
the one who trusted me, and loved
me, and loves me still. I am so poor
myself that I cannot this year give to
any charity; not even do I give this fes
tive season to any of my family."
Students, perhaps more than any
others, felt the impact of Jane Stan
ford's struggle.
In a letter dated Jan. 28. 1896.
C harles Burncll of the 1895 Pioneer
Class (the University's first gradual
ing class), wrote to Jane Stanford.
"We of '95, who have seen the
I 'niversity at its birth, who have seen
its noble founders watching over it
with such loving care, whose future
lives have been shaped by its influ
ence," he wrote, "we of '95 watch
with you for the first break of dawn
that shall end the long night of watch
ing. waiting, hoping, and fearing."


Jane Stanford
On March 2, 18%, the Stanford
community received the news that
the long night had ended.
The Supreme Court ruled unani
mously in favor of Jane Stanford in
the case of United States of America
vs. Jane L. Stanford, Executrix.
Jane Stanford released a state
ment to the ecstatic students.
"I thank you one and all for your
loyalty throughout the past year of
doubt and uncertainty and now you
can rejoice to your heart's content
while I will quietly remain at home
and be thankful."
This put Stanford at the end of its
"Dark Days," as Jordan called them.
However, there were still more than
$7 million of debt to be paid and, with
Jane Stanford nearing 70, many wor
ried she would not live to pay all of it.
Jane Stanford was determined to
see the University succeed, however.
"At one time, we have the pathet
ic figure of the good woman going to
the Queen's Jubilee in London, with
all her own possessions, half a million
dollars' worth of jewels, in a suit case
carried in hand," remembered Jor
dan in his Founders' Day speech.
"She hoped to sell these to advan
tage, when all the world was gathered
in London. But the market was good,
and three-fourths of them she
brought back to California again."
After much sacrifice and work.

Jane Stanford and others finally man
aged to put the University back into
working order in 1898.
Building up the University
By 1848. Jordan and Jane Stan
lord. who had spent the Universi
ty's early years struggling to keep it
alive, found themselves at odds
about how to continue building the
University.
Jane Stanford saw no reason for
extensive expansion, while Jordan
thought growth was essential to en
suring the University's success.
Former Stanford history doctor
al student Roxanne Nilan. author
of "The Tenacious and Courageous
Jane L. Stanford," printed in the
Winter 1985 edition of Sandstone
and Tile, writes that Jordan and
Jane Stanford disagreed often and
battled over each expense every
year, but outwardly the relation
ship remained mutually respectful.
In addition. Jane Stanford trav
eled considerably and, thus, left
much of the daily workings of the
University to Jordan, which suited
him, according to Nagel.
Despite Jane Stanford's feelings
about unnecessary expansion, she
remained devoted to realizing her
husband's architectural goals for
the University.
To this end. she took charge of
what later came to be called the
Stanford "stone age." overseeing
the building of Memorial Church.

which, according to Nilan, she felt
had a crucial influence upon stu
dents' development.
"The church stood not fora par
ticular doctrine, but for moral con
science," writes Nilan.
Nilan quotes Jane Stanford:
"Don't think that I believe that any
particular creed or that even the
church itself is capable of making
saints of some folks.
"Such things are not matters of
creed; ... 1 mean that men and
women should be sound at the
core, whatever their doctrines may
be."
Jane Stanford also oversaw the
building of the museum, and a li
brary and gymnasium, all along
Palm Drive. The library and gym
nasium were greatly damaged in
the 1906 earthquake.
For these new buildings, Jane
Stanford deviated from the original
campus scheme and chose a neo
classical style of architecture.
She chose to build the library
and gymnasium along Palm Drive,
away from the Main Quad and out
side the original plan, to balance
against the existing museum and
chemistry buildings.
In her later years. Jane Stanford
became more involved in the gen
eral workings of the University.
"She had her own ideas as lo
what needed to be done and was
not afraid to speak her mind and
see that work was done." said Kim
ball.

Women at the University
One of Jane Stanford's greatest
concerns during this period sur
rounded the moral reputation of
Stanford students, particularly the
women. She expressed a strong belief
that the University should adopt a
code of rules for students so that out
siders could not question the Univer
sity's stance on proper conduct.
The Board of Trustees avoided
formalizing this request and the Uni
versity's Advisory Board eventually
decided against it.
Some questions also arose sur
rounding Jane Stanford's feelings
about women's rights. This resulted
from Jane Stanford's decision to cap
the number of female students admit
ted to the University at 500.
At the time of her decision in 1899,
the University's student body was 40
percent female.
Though many interpreted this as a
move against women. Jane Stanford
later explained that she began the
University with women in mind, but
she did not wish for it to gain a repu
tation as a "women's school."
Although she was an ardent sup
porter of the women's rights move
ment, Jane Stanford felt that the ris
ing percentage of women at the Uni
versity would be inappropriate at a
school memorializing her son.
Also, she felt that a University
with a high percentage of women
would be looked down upon by peer
institutions, such as Harvard and
Yale Universities, which were still not

admitting women.
Concern for child welfare
Jane Stanford also continued her
interest in child welfare. In 1899, she
donated the Sacramento home that
had served as the Stanfords' "gover
nor's mansion" as a day nursery for
children of single parents in the
Sacramento area.
She also established and main
tained six free kindergartens in San
Francisco, serving more than 600 un
derprivileged children of both sexes.
In addition to the six San Francisco
based schools, she also supported one
in Menlo Park and one in Mayfield.
In an interview with the Cheyenne
Sun in Feb. 1892 quoted by Psycholo
gy Prof. Alberta Siegel in her
Founder's Day speech on Apr. 5.
1998, Jane Stanford explained how
her interest in children's issues began.
After supporting a preschool for
disadvantaged children in San Fran
cisco. she visited the school with her
son and brought gifts for the children.
"1 had lived all my life up to that
time entirely lor my own pleasures,
but the experience of that day and the
joy expressed by the children over the
insignificant gilts I had brought them
... opened my eyes to a phase of life
that 1 did not realize existed, and I
thank God I have never closed them
since." Jane Stanford said.
"When we came out. my boy said
'Mamma. 1 think that is the best thing
you ever did in your life.' My whole
life changed from that hour."

Her legacy
In the end it was this love of young
people and a commitment to their de
velopment that motivated Jane Stan
ford to achieve the goals she and her
husband set when their son died.
"I could lay down my life for the
University," she wrote in a letter
dated Dec. 14, 19(X). quoted by Jor
dan in his Founder's Day speech.
"Not for any pride in its perpetu
ating the names of our dear son and
ourselves, its founders," she contin
ued. "but for the sincere hope I cher
ish in its sending forth to the world
grand men and women who will aid in
developing the best there is to be
found in human nature."
Jane Lathrop Stanford died on
Feb. 28,1905, at the age of 76 while on
holiday in Honolulu.
At that time, Jordan, her long
time personal friend and sometime
business rival, said. "No one outside
the University can understand the
difficulties in her way in the final es
tablishment of the University, and
her patient deeds of self sacrifice can
be known only to those who saw
them from day to day.
"Some day the world may under
stand a part of this. It will then know
her for the wisest, as well as the most
generous, friend of learning in our
time."

Editor's note: This is the fifth in a
scries of five articles commemorating
the five most important people in
Stanford's history. At No. I is Jane
Stanford. After the passing of her hus
band and University founder Leland
Stanford, she managed the University,
seeing it through a period of financial
worry. Her dedication to the areas of
education, women's rights and chari
ty, as well as her perseverance in mak
ing Stanford a top-level University,
distinguish Jane Stanford as the Uni
versity's most important person of the
20tlt century.

"The legend of Jane Stanford is
remarkable," said School of I luman
ities and Sciences Dean Malcolm
Beasley. "I suspect the reality is pret
ty amazing, too."
Certainly few would argue with
the former statement and.in these
days of frenzied progress and fading
history.
In 1893. in the face of sweeping fi
nancial panic, the overwhelming task
of starting a successful university and

her own grief at her husband's death,
Jane Stanford managed to save the
University that she and her husband
had dreamed of and put it well on its
way to international fame.
Throughout this time. Jane Stan
ford remained a friend of the
women's movement, an advocate for
underprivileged children and a
strong supporter of quality education
for students of all classes.
"Students today owe a real debt of
gratitude to Jane," said University
Archivist Maggie Kimball. "She re
fused to allow the University to close
when legal and financial problems
seemed insurmountable. She made
sure that Stanford would survive her
and carry on far into the future."
A privileged childhood
Jane Eliza Lathrop was born on
Aug. 25. 1828 in Albany, NY. the

great-granddaughter of Reverend
John Lathrop, the minister of Old
South Church in Boston, whose ser
mon led to the revolutionary Boston
Tea Party.
The child of relatively wealthy, so
cially aware parents. Jane Lathrop
was brought up in a very duty-con
scious and religious household. She
was educated at the Albany Female
Academy, which provided Jane with
;i solid educational background that
was standard for women of her status
;il the time. Jane was being educated
at the time the American women's
movement was beginning to gain mo
mentum.
life with J-cliiikl
Oil Sept. 30, I<S5(). when Jane was
22. she married Leland Stanford, an
enterprising young lawyer and a fel

low Albany resident of similar family
background. After a number of
moves that went from Michigan to
California and back to Albany, the
Stanfords finally settled in California,
where Leland was named president
of the new Central Pacific Railroad
Company of California and inaugu
rated governor of California on Jan.
10.1862.
Leland served one term as gover
nor before dedicating his energy en
tirely to the railroad and achieving a
great deal of success there. In the
midst of Leland Stanford's growing
fame and fortune, Leland Stanford
Jr.. the Stanfords' first child after IS
years of marriage, was born on May
14. IX6B.
The Stanfords raised their son
with the express goal in mind of
grooming him to fill his father's busi
ness positions. His academic curiosi
ty. particularly in the areas of foreign
language and historical collecting,
was greatly encouraged, which often
resulted in a great deal of travel for
Leland Jr.
It was on one such trip that the
Stanford heir became ill with typhoid
fever and died on March 13. 1884, in
Florence, Italy, two months before
his 16th birthday.
Founding of a dream
This tragedy, along with Leland
Sr.'s dream, in which he woke with
the words, "The children of Califor
nia shall he our children." on his lips,
prompted the Stanfords to found a
university in their son's honor.
Within a year of his son's death.
Leland Sr. became a California sena
tor and established plans for the Uni
versity. The Stanfords appointed a
Board of Trustees and David Starr
Jordan was named the University's
first president after leaving his post as
president at Indiana University.
The University opened on Oct. 1.

1891, six years after the Stanfords
founded it. with 465 students of both
sexes and 15 instructors. Although
Jane Stanford had agreed and
planned to speak at the University's
opening, she chose not to. and Inter
wrote to Jordan explaining why.
In her letter, quoted in (iunther
Nagel's 1975 book "Jane Stanford:
I Icr Life and Letters," she explained.
"My heart grew faint at such an or
deal, and I could not bring my mind to
face such an audience and read this
address."
She also enclosed a copy o! the ad
dress she had planned to read.
"While Mr. Stanford has dilated
on book education," she wrote, "I de
sire to impress upon the minds of
each one of these students, both male
and female, that we have at heart and
very closely hope that you will each
strive to place before yourselves a
high moral standard; that you will re
solve to go forth from these class
rooms determined in the future to be
leaders with high aims and pure stan
dards; and live such lives that it will be
said of you that you are true to the
best you know."
Jane Stanford on co-education
Jane Stanford also paid particular
attention in her address to the matter
of co-education, which she under
stood to be central to the I Jniversity's
mission.
"Jane Stanford and her husband
[were| committed to gender equity at
Stanford, something rare at the time
of the founding of the University,"
said School of 1 ducation Dean
Richard Shavelson.
Jane Stanford wrote in her ad
dress, "I am also anxious that these
young men should treat the young
ladies who have entered this institu
tion with the greatest deference;" she
wrote, "that they will be helpful in
aiding and cheering them in their am
bition fora thorough education.
"We have started you both on the
same equality, and we hope for the
best results."

Coping with death
Shortly after the University's
opening, after spending a consider
able amount ol time traveling to dif
ferent spas in hopes of bolstering Le
land Stanford Sr.'s ailing health, the
Senator died in his sleep on June 21.
1K93 at the age of 69. Jane Stanford
was 65 at the time.
Jane Stanford described the days
following the Senator's death some
years later in her dedication for the
Thomas Wclton Stanford Library,
dated Nov. I. IN9B.
She said ol the time after her hus
band's death. "There followed this
dreadful sorrow , developments and
experiences such as the world could
not understand or believe. ... Fora
while I fell like one on a sinking ship
on a tempestuous sea ... 1 wanted to
join my loved ones and was not afraid
to die.
"Suddenly there loomed up be
fore me the blessed work left to my
care by my loved ones, and I felt that
my course was cowardly. I was so im
pressed by the new light which
dawned over me it brought the first
tears to my eyes."
Jane Stanford had played an equal
role in plans for the University, but
maintained her role as wife and
mother as her central occupation.
I lowever. with the death of her hus
band. Jane Stanford stepped into the
toreground to carry their shared
dream.
Financial troubles
I his proved to be a more difficult
task than anyone could have antici
pated. Iceland Stanford Sr.'s estate
was tied up in probate court, which
meant that officials were evaluating
the distribution of the estate's wealth
and this money could not be used
until the process was complete. Since
the Stanfords were using their per
sonal funds tooperate the University,
there were no moneys available from
the estate to keep the University run

ning.
Although the Stanfords had in
tended the estate to essentially serve
as the University's endowment, this
had not been documented formally,
so the Court could not recognize that
the estate had any monetary respon
sibility to the University.
To make matters worse, the entire
country was in the throes of a finan
cial panic that threatened to bank
rupt all the Western railroads, includ
ing the Central Pacific Line of which
Leland Stanford Sr. had been presi
dent.
Anticipating this disaster, the U.S.
government filed suit against the
Stanford estate, demanding that all
outstanding railroad construction
loans be paid immediately. None of
the loans were due yet and. thus, it
seemed that the government had no
legal grounds for their case, but the
outcome of the lawsuit was still un
certain.
Everyone concerned with the af
fair advised and expected Jane Stan
ford to close the University. They saw
no way to operate the University
without a reliable source of funding.
Working through the problems
After two weeks of seclusion and
meditation following Leland Stan
ford Sr.'s death, Jane Stanford an
nounced that the University would
remain open with the $ 1 ().(KK) award
ed her bv the probate court for the es
tate's regular monthly expenses.
Though the estate had spent this
full amount in the past. Mrs. Stanford
trimmed the estate's expenses to
$350. keeping only three household
personnel of an original group of 1 7.
The remaining balance, in addition to
the income from students' $20 regis
tration fee. was used to pay professor
salaries, which were reduced by 10
percent, and also served to keep the
University afloat.
Upholding the Stanfords' original
plan for the University, Jane Stanford
chose not to require students to pay
tuition. She explained her reasoning

later in an Oct. 3, 1 1 >()2. address that
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya discussed.
"She described the University as a
place that should 'resist the tendency
to the stratification of society." "
Montoya said. "Mrs. Stanford be
lieved that the University should be
open to deserving students coming
from all stations of life, and that a
spirit of equality should be main
tained within the University."
This decision against tuition re
mained in effect until 1920 and. ac
cording to Montoya. "our financial
aid program allows us to stay true to
her vision."
Jane Stanford also resolved to
honor her husband's wish of running
the University without soliciting

Editor's note: This is the fifth in a
scries of five articles commemorating
the five most important people in
Stanford's history. At No. I is Jane
Stanford. After the passing of her hus
band and University founder Leland
Stanford, she managed the University,
seeing it through a period of financial
worry. Her dedication to the areas of
education, women's rights and chari
ty, as well as her perseverance in mak
ing Stanford a top-level University,
distinguish Jane Stanford as the Uni
versity's most important person of the
20tlt century.

"The legend of Jane Stanford is
remarkable," said School of I luman
ities and Sciences Dean Malcolm
Beasley. "I suspect the reality is pret
ty amazing, too."
Certainly few would argue with
the former statement and.in these
days of frenzied progress and fading
history.
In 1893. in the face of sweeping fi
nancial panic, the overwhelming task
of starting a successful university and

her own grief at her husband's death,
Jane Stanford managed to save the
University that she and her husband
had dreamed of and put it well on its
way to international fame.
Throughout this time. Jane Stan
ford remained a friend of the
women's movement, an advocate for
underprivileged children and a
strong supporter of quality education
for students of all classes.
"Students today owe a real debt of
gratitude to Jane," said University
Archivist Maggie Kimball. "She re
fused to allow the University to close
when legal and financial problems
seemed insurmountable. She made
sure that Stanford would survive her
and carry on far into the future."
A privileged childhood
Jane Eliza Lathrop was born on
Aug. 25. 1828 in Albany, NY. the

great-granddaughter of Reverend
John Lathrop, the minister of Old
South Church in Boston, whose ser
mon led to the revolutionary Boston
Tea Party.
The child of relatively wealthy, so
cially aware parents. Jane Lathrop
was brought up in a very duty-con
scious and religious household. She
was educated at the Albany Female
Academy, which provided Jane with
;i solid educational background that
was standard for women of her status
;il the time. Jane was being educated
at the time the American women's
movement was beginning to gain mo
mentum.
life with J-cliiikl
Oil Sept. 30, I<S5(). when Jane was
22. she married Leland Stanford, an
enterprising young lawyer and a fel

low Albany resident of similar family
background. After a number of
moves that went from Michigan to
California and back to Albany, the
Stanfords finally settled in California,
where Leland was named president
of the new Central Pacific Railroad
Company of California and inaugu
rated governor of California on Jan.
10.1862.
Leland served one term as gover
nor before dedicating his energy en
tirely to the railroad and achieving a
great deal of success there. In the
midst of Leland Stanford's growing
fame and fortune, Leland Stanford
Jr.. the Stanfords' first child after IS
years of marriage, was born on May
14. IX6B.
The Stanfords raised their son
with the express goal in mind of
grooming him to fill his father's busi
ness positions. His academic curiosi
ty. particularly in the areas of foreign
language and historical collecting,
was greatly encouraged, which often
resulted in a great deal of travel for
Leland Jr.
It was on one such trip that the
Stanford heir became ill with typhoid
fever and died on March 13. 1884, in
Florence, Italy, two months before
his 16th birthday.
Founding of a dream
This tragedy, along with Leland
Sr.'s dream, in which he woke with
the words, "The children of Califor
nia shall he our children." on his lips,
prompted the Stanfords to found a
university in their son's honor.
Within a year of his son's death.
Leland Sr. became a California sena
tor and established plans for the Uni
versity. The Stanfords appointed a
Board of Trustees and David Starr
Jordan was named the University's
first president after leaving his post as
president at Indiana University.
The University opened on Oct. 1.

1891, six years after the Stanfords
founded it. with 465 students of both
sexes and 15 instructors. Although
Jane Stanford had agreed and
planned to speak at the University's
opening, she chose not to. and Inter
wrote to Jordan explaining why.
In her letter, quoted in (iunther
Nagel's 1975 book "Jane Stanford:
I Icr Life and Letters," she explained.
"My heart grew faint at such an or
deal, and I could not bring my mind to
face such an audience and read this
address."
She also enclosed a copy o! the ad
dress she had planned to read.
"While Mr. Stanford has dilated
on book education," she wrote, "I de
sire to impress upon the minds of
each one of these students, both male
and female, that we have at heart and
very closely hope that you will each
strive to place before yourselves a
high moral standard; that you will re
solve to go forth from these class
rooms determined in the future to be
leaders with high aims and pure stan
dards; and live such lives that it will be
said of you that you are true to the
best you know."
Jane Stanford on co-education
Jane Stanford also paid particular
attention in her address to the matter
of co-education, which she under
stood to be central to the I Jniversity's
mission.
"Jane Stanford and her husband
[were| committed to gender equity at
Stanford, something rare at the time
of the founding of the University,"
said School of 1 ducation Dean
Richard Shavelson.
Jane Stanford wrote in her ad
dress, "I am also anxious that these
young men should treat the young
ladies who have entered this institu
tion with the greatest deference;" she
wrote, "that they will be helpful in
aiding and cheering them in their am
bition fora thorough education.
"We have started you both on the
same equality, and we hope for the
best results."

Coping with death
Shortly after the University's
opening, after spending a consider
able amount ol time traveling to dif
ferent spas in hopes of bolstering Le
land Stanford Sr.'s ailing health, the
Senator died in his sleep on June 21.
1K93 at the age of 69. Jane Stanford
was 65 at the time.
Jane Stanford described the days
following the Senator's death some
years later in her dedication for the
Thomas Wclton Stanford Library,
dated Nov. I. IN9B.
She said ol the time after her hus
band's death. "There followed this
dreadful sorrow , developments and
experiences such as the world could
not understand or believe. ... Fora
while I fell like one on a sinking ship
on a tempestuous sea ... 1 wanted to
join my loved ones and was not afraid
to die.
"Suddenly there loomed up be
fore me the blessed work left to my
care by my loved ones, and I felt that
my course was cowardly. I was so im
pressed by the new light which
dawned over me it brought the first
tears to my eyes."
Jane Stanford had played an equal
role in plans for the University, but
maintained her role as wife and
mother as her central occupation.
I lowever. with the death of her hus
band. Jane Stanford stepped into the
toreground to carry their shared
dream.
Financial troubles
I his proved to be a more difficult
task than anyone could have antici
pated. Iceland Stanford Sr.'s estate
was tied up in probate court, which
meant that officials were evaluating
the distribution of the estate's wealth
and this money could not be used
until the process was complete. Since
the Stanfords were using their per
sonal funds tooperate the University,
there were no moneys available from
the estate to keep the University run

ning.
Although the Stanfords had in
tended the estate to essentially serve
as the University's endowment, this
had not been documented formally,
so the Court could not recognize that
the estate had any monetary respon
sibility to the University.
To make matters worse, the entire
country was in the throes of a finan
cial panic that threatened to bank
rupt all the Western railroads, includ
ing the Central Pacific Line of which
Leland Stanford Sr. had been presi
dent.
Anticipating this disaster, the U.S.
government filed suit against the
Stanford estate, demanding that all
outstanding railroad construction
loans be paid immediately. None of
the loans were due yet and. thus, it
seemed that the government had no
legal grounds for their case, but the
outcome of the lawsuit was still un
certain.
Everyone concerned with the af
fair advised and expected Jane Stan
ford to close the University. They saw
no way to operate the University
without a reliable source of funding.
Working through the problems
After two weeks of seclusion and
meditation following Leland Stan
ford Sr.'s death, Jane Stanford an
nounced that the University would
remain open with the $ 1 ().(KK) award
ed her bv the probate court for the es
tate's regular monthly expenses.
Though the estate had spent this
full amount in the past. Mrs. Stanford
trimmed the estate's expenses to
$350. keeping only three household
personnel of an original group of 1 7.
The remaining balance, in addition to
the income from students' $20 regis
tration fee. was used to pay professor
salaries, which were reduced by 10
percent, and also served to keep the
University afloat.
Upholding the Stanfords' original
plan for the University, Jane Stanford
chose not to require students to pay
tuition. She explained her reasoning

later in an Oct. 3, 1 1 >()2. address that
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya discussed.
"She described the University as a
place that should 'resist the tendency
to the stratification of society." "
Montoya said. "Mrs. Stanford be
lieved that the University should be
open to deserving students coming
from all stations of life, and that a
spirit of equality should be main
tained within the University."
This decision against tuition re
mained in effect until 1920 and. ac
cording to Montoya. "our financial
aid program allows us to stay true to
her vision."
Jane Stanford also resolved to
honor her husband's wish of running
the University without soliciting
funds from sources beyond the es
tate. This decision did not remain
long, as many faculty members, and
finally, Jane Stanford herself, were
forced to seek outside support for
their specific needs.
Meanwhile, since the government
had filed its suit against the Stanford
estate on June 3. 1894, two years
passed with the district and circuit
courts, which found in favor of Stan
ford. The circuit court decision was
long in coming, however, and the
University had little time to spare.
Faced with these circumstances.
Jane Stanford traveled to Washing
ton to seek President (irover Cleve
land's help in expediting the circuit
court process so as to make the
Supreme ( ourt 's October calendar.
"She told him our story." recount
ed University President Jordan in his
March I l *) 1 ) Founders' Day speech in
honor of Jane Stanford, "and bc
seechcd him to use his influence fora
speedy settlement.... At last. Presi
dent Cleveland saw his duty, and
through his influence the Stanford
case was placed on the calendar of the
United States Supreme Court for
speedy trial."
Despite her efforts, many still ac
cused Jane Stanford of keeping the
Stanford fortune for her own use. She

responded to this in a letter dated
Nov. 24. 1895, which Jordan quoted
in hisspeeeh.
"It has been my policy to say as lit
tie about my financial affairs to the
outside world as possible, but 1 leel
sure that I am doing myself and our
blessed work injustice by allowing the
impression among all classes to feel
certain there is plenty of money at m\
command, the future is assured, the
battle fought and won.
"I only ask righteous justice. I ask
not for myself, but that I may be able
to discharge my duty and loyalty to
the one who trusted me, and loved
me, and loves me still. I am so poor
myself that I cannot this year give to
any charity; not even do I give this fes
tive season to any of my family."
Students, perhaps more than any
others, felt the impact of Jane Stan
ford's struggle.
In a letter dated Jan. 28. 1896.
C harles Burncll of the 1895 Pioneer
Class (the University's first gradual
ing class), wrote to Jane Stanford.
"We of '95, who have seen the
I 'niversity at its birth, who have seen
its noble founders watching over it
with such loving care, whose future
lives have been shaped by its influ
ence," he wrote, "we of '95 watch
with you for the first break of dawn
that shall end the long night of watch
ing. waiting, hoping, and fearing."


Jane Stanford
On March 2, 18%, the Stanford
community received the news that
the long night had ended.
The Supreme Court ruled unani
mously in favor of Jane Stanford in
the case of United States of America
vs. Jane L. Stanford, Executrix.
Jane Stanford released a state
ment to the ecstatic students.
"I thank you one and all for your
loyalty throughout the past year of
doubt and uncertainty and now you
can rejoice to your heart's content
while I will quietly remain at home
and be thankful."
This put Stanford at the end of its
"Dark Days," as Jordan called them.
However, there were still more than
$7 million of debt to be paid and, with
Jane Stanford nearing 70, many wor
ried she would not live to pay all of it.
Jane Stanford was determined to
see the University succeed, however.
"At one time, we have the pathet
ic figure of the good woman going to
the Queen's Jubilee in London, with
all her own possessions, half a million
dollars' worth of jewels, in a suit case
carried in hand," remembered Jor
dan in his Founders' Day speech.
"She hoped to sell these to advan
tage, when all the world was gathered
in London. But the market was good,
and three-fourths of them she
brought back to California again."
After much sacrifice and work.

Jane Stanford and others finally man
aged to put the University back into
working order in 1898.
Building up the University
By 1848. Jordan and Jane Stan
lord. who had spent the Universi
ty's early years struggling to keep it
alive, found themselves at odds
about how to continue building the
University.
Jane Stanford saw no reason for
extensive expansion, while Jordan
thought growth was essential to en
suring the University's success.
Former Stanford history doctor
al student Roxanne Nilan. author
of "The Tenacious and Courageous
Jane L. Stanford," printed in the
Winter 1985 edition of Sandstone
and Tile, writes that Jordan and
Jane Stanford disagreed often and
battled over each expense every
year, but outwardly the relation
ship remained mutually respectful.
In addition. Jane Stanford trav
eled considerably and, thus, left
much of the daily workings of the
University to Jordan, which suited
him, according to Nagel.
Despite Jane Stanford's feelings
about unnecessary expansion, she
remained devoted to realizing her
husband's architectural goals for
the University.
To this end. she took charge of
what later came to be called the
Stanford "stone age." overseeing
the building of Memorial Church.

which, according to Nilan, she felt
had a crucial influence upon stu
dents' development.
"The church stood not fora par
ticular doctrine, but for moral con
science," writes Nilan.
Nilan quotes Jane Stanford:
"Don't think that I believe that any
particular creed or that even the
church itself is capable of making
saints of some folks.
"Such things are not matters of
creed; ... 1 mean that men and
women should be sound at the
core, whatever their doctrines may
be."
Jane Stanford also oversaw the
building of the museum, and a li
brary and gymnasium, all along
Palm Drive. The library and gym
nasium were greatly damaged in
the 1906 earthquake.
For these new buildings, Jane
Stanford deviated from the original
campus scheme and chose a neo
classical style of architecture.
She chose to build the library
and gymnasium along Palm Drive,
away from the Main Quad and out
side the original plan, to balance
against the existing museum and
chemistry buildings.
In her later years. Jane Stanford
became more involved in the gen
eral workings of the University.
"She had her own ideas as lo
what needed to be done and was
not afraid to speak her mind and
see that work was done." said Kim
ball.

Women at the University
One of Jane Stanford's greatest
concerns during this period sur
rounded the moral reputation of
Stanford students, particularly the
women. She expressed a strong belief
that the University should adopt a
code of rules for students so that out
siders could not question the Univer
sity's stance on proper conduct.
The Board of Trustees avoided
formalizing this request and the Uni
versity's Advisory Board eventually
decided against it.
Some questions also arose sur
rounding Jane Stanford's feelings
about women's rights. This resulted
from Jane Stanford's decision to cap
the number of female students admit
ted to the University at 500.
At the time of her decision in 1899,
the University's student body was 40
percent female.
Though many interpreted this as a
move against women. Jane Stanford
later explained that she began the
University with women in mind, but
she did not wish for it to gain a repu
tation as a "women's school."
Although she was an ardent sup
porter of the women's rights move
ment, Jane Stanford felt that the ris
ing percentage of women at the Uni
versity would be inappropriate at a
school memorializing her son.
Also, she felt that a University
with a high percentage of women
would be looked down upon by peer
institutions, such as Harvard and
Yale Universities, which were still not

admitting women.
Concern for child welfare
Jane Stanford also continued her
interest in child welfare. In 1899, she
donated the Sacramento home that
had served as the Stanfords' "gover
nor's mansion" as a day nursery for
children of single parents in the
Sacramento area.
She also established and main
tained six free kindergartens in San
Francisco, serving more than 600 un
derprivileged children of both sexes.
In addition to the six San Francisco
based schools, she also supported one
in Menlo Park and one in Mayfield.
In an interview with the Cheyenne
Sun in Feb. 1892 quoted by Psycholo
gy Prof. Alberta Siegel in her
Founder's Day speech on Apr. 5.
1998, Jane Stanford explained how
her interest in children's issues began.
After supporting a preschool for
disadvantaged children in San Fran
cisco. she visited the school with her
son and brought gifts for the children.
"1 had lived all my life up to that
time entirely lor my own pleasures,
but the experience of that day and the
joy expressed by the children over the
insignificant gilts I had brought them
... opened my eyes to a phase of life
that 1 did not realize existed, and I
thank God I have never closed them
since." Jane Stanford said.
"When we came out. my boy said
'Mamma. 1 think that is the best thing
you ever did in your life.' My whole
life changed from that hour."

Her legacy
In the end it was this love of young
people and a commitment to their de
velopment that motivated Jane Stan
ford to achieve the goals she and her
husband set when their son died.
"I could lay down my life for the
University," she wrote in a letter
dated Dec. 14, 19(X). quoted by Jor
dan in his Founder's Day speech.
"Not for any pride in its perpetu
ating the names of our dear son and
ourselves, its founders," she contin
ued. "but for the sincere hope I cher
ish in its sending forth to the world
grand men and women who will aid in
developing the best there is to be
found in human nature."
Jane Lathrop Stanford died on
Feb. 28,1905, at the age of 76 while on
holiday in Honolulu.
At that time, Jordan, her long
time personal friend and sometime
business rival, said. "No one outside
the University can understand the
difficulties in her way in the final es
tablishment of the University, and
her patient deeds of self sacrifice can
be known only to those who saw
them from day to day.
"Some day the world may under
stand a part of this. It will then know
her for the wisest, as well as the most

ford Sr.'s death, Jane Stanford an
nounced that the University would
remain open with the $ 1 ().(KK) award
ed her bv the probate court for the es
tate's regular monthly expenses.
Though the estate had spent this
full amount in the past. Mrs. Stanford
trimmed the estate's expenses to
$350. keeping only three household
personnel of an original group of 1 7.
The remaining balance, in addition to
the income from students' $20 regis
tration fee. was used to pay professor
salaries, which were reduced by 10
percent, and also served to keep the
University afloat.
Upholding the Stanfords' original
plan for the University, Jane Stanford
chose not to require students to pay
tuition. She explained her reasoning

later in an Oct. 3, 1 1 >()2. address that
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya discussed.
"She described the University as a
place that should 'resist the tendency
to the stratification of society." "
Montoya said. "Mrs. Stanford be
lieved that the University should be
open to deserving students coming
from all stations of life, and that a
spirit of equality should be main
tained within the University."
This decision against tuition re
mained in effect until 1920 and. ac
cording to Montoya. "our financial
aid program allows us to stay true to
her vision."
Jane Stanford also resolved to
honor her husband's wish of running
the University without soliciting
funds from sources beyond the es
tate. This decision did not remain
long, as many faculty members, and
finally, Jane Stanford herself, were
forced to seek outside support for
their specific needs.
Meanwhile, since the government
had filed its suit against the Stanford
estate on June 3. 1894, two years
passed with the district and circuit
courts, which found in favor of Stan
ford. The circuit court decision was
long in coming, however, and the
University had little time to spare.
Faced with these circumstances.
Jane Stanford traveled to Washing
ton to seek President (irover Cleve
land's help in expediting the circuit
court process so as to make the
Supreme ( ourt 's October calendar.
"She told him our story." recount
ed University President Jordan in his
March I l *) 1 ) Founders' Day speech in
honor of Jane Stanford, "and bc
seechcd him to use his influence fora
speedy settlement.... At last. Presi
dent Cleveland saw his duty, and
through his influence the Stanford
case was placed on the calendar of the
United States Supreme Court for
speedy trial."
Despite her efforts, many still ac
cused Jane Stanford of keeping the
Stanford fortune for her own use. She

responded to this in a letter dated
Nov. 24. 1895, which Jordan quoted
in hisspeeeh.
"It has been my policy to say as lit
tie about my financial affairs to the
outside world as possible, but 1 leel
sure that I am doing myself and our
blessed work injustice by allowing the
impression among all classes to feel
certain there is plenty of money at m\
command, the future is assured, the
battle fought and won.
"I only ask righteous justice. I ask
not for myself, but that I may be able
to discharge my duty and loyalty to
the one who trusted me, and loved
me, and loves me still. I am so poor
myself that I cannot this year give to
any charity; not even do I give this fes
tive season to any of my family."
Students, perhaps more than any
others, felt the impact of Jane Stan
ford's struggle.
In a letter dated Jan. 28. 1896.
C harles Burncll of the 1895 Pioneer
Class (the University's first gradual
ing class), wrote to Jane Stanford.
"We of '95, who have seen the
I 'niversity at its birth, who have seen
its noble founders watching over it
with such loving care, whose future
lives have been shaped by its influ
ence," he wrote, "we of '95 watch
with you for the first break of dawn
that shall end the long night of watch
ing. waiting, hoping, and fearing."


Jane Stanford
On March 2, 18%, the Stanford
community received the news that
the long night had ended.
The Supreme Court ruled unani
mously in favor of Jane Stanford in
the case of United States of America
vs. Jane L. Stanford, Executrix.
Jane Stanford released a state
ment to the ecstatic students.
"I thank you one and all for your
loyalty throughout the past year of
doubt and uncertainty and now you
can rejoice to your heart's content
while I will quietly remain at home
and be thankful."
This put Stanford at the end of its
"Dark Days," as Jordan called them.
However, there were still more than
$7 million of debt to be paid and, with
Jane Stanford nearing 70, many wor
ried she would not live to pay all of it.
Jane Stanford was determined to
see the University succeed, however.
"At one time, we have the pathet
ic figure of the good woman going to
the Queen's Jubilee in London, with
all her own possessions, half a million
dollars' worth of jewels, in a suit case
carried in hand," remembered Jor
dan in his Founders' Day speech.
"She hoped to sell these to advan
tage, when all the world was gathered
in London. But the market was good,
and three-fourths of them she
brought back to California again."
After much sacrifice and work.

Jane Stanford and others finally man
aged to put the University back into
working order in 1898.
Building up the University
By 1848. Jordan and Jane Stan
lord. who had spent the Universi
ty's early years struggling to keep it
alive, found themselves at odds
about how to continue building the
University.
Jane Stanford saw no reason for
extensive expansion, while Jordan
thought growth was essential to en
suring the University's success.
Former Stanford history doctor
al student Roxanne Nilan. author
of "The Tenacious and Courageous
Jane L. Stanford," printed in the
Winter 1985 edition of Sandstone
and Tile, writes that Jordan and
Jane Stanford disagreed often and
battled over each expense every
year, but outwardly the relation
ship remained mutually respectful.
In addition. Jane Stanford trav
eled considerably and, thus, left
much of the daily workings of the
University to Jordan, which suited
him, according to Nagel.
Despite Jane Stanford's feelings
about unnecessary expansion, she
remained devoted to realizing her
husband's architectural goals for
the University.
To this end. she took charge of
what later came to be called the
Stanford "stone age." overseeing
the building of Memorial Church.

which, according to Nilan, she felt
had a crucial influence upon stu
dents' development.
"The church stood not fora par
ticular doctrine, but for moral con
science," writes Nilan.
Nilan quotes Jane Stanford:
"Don't think that I believe that any
particular creed or that even the
church itself is capable of making
saints of some folks.
"Such things are not matters of
creed; ... 1 mean that men and
women should be sound at the
core, whatever their doctrines may
be."
Jane Stanford also oversaw the
building of the museum, and a li
brary and gymnasium, all along
Palm Drive. The library and gym
nasium were greatly damaged in
the 1906 earthquake.
For these new buildings, Jane
Stanford deviated from the original
campus scheme and chose a neo
classical style of architecture.
She chose to build the library
and gymnasium along Palm Drive,
away from the Main Quad and out
side the original plan, to balance
against the existing museum and
chemistry buildings.
In her later years. Jane Stanford
became more involved in the gen
eral workings of the University.
"She had her own ideas as lo
what needed to be done and was
not afraid to speak her mind and
see that work was done." said Kim
ball.

Women at the University
One of Jane Stanford's greatest
concerns during this period sur
rounded the moral reputation of
Stanford students, particularly the
women. She expressed a strong belief
that the University should adopt a
code of rules for students so that out
siders could not question the Univer
sity's stance on proper conduct.
The Board of Trustees avoided
formalizing this request and the Uni
versity's Advisory Board eventually
decided against it.
Some questions also arose sur
rounding Jane Stanford's feelings
about women's rights. This resulted
from Jane Stanford's decision to cap
the number of female students admit
ted to the University at 500.
At the time of her decision in 1899,
the University's student body was 40
percent female.
Though many interpreted this as a
move against women. Jane Stanford
later explained that she began the
University with women in mind, but
she did not wish for it to gain a repu
tation as a "women's school."
Although she was an ardent sup
porter of the women's rights move
ment, Jane Stanford felt that the ris
ing percentage of women at the Uni
versity would be inappropriate at a
school memorializing her son.
Also, she felt that a University
with a high percentage of women
would be looked down upon by peer
institutions, such as Harvard and
Yale Universities, which were still not

admitting women.
Concern for child welfare
Jane Stanford also continued her
interest in child welfare. In 1899, she
donated the Sacramento home that
had served as the Stanfords' "gover
nor's mansion" as a day nursery for
children of single parents in the
Sacramento area.
She also established and main
tained six free kindergartens in San
Francisco, serving more than 600 un
derprivileged children of both sexes.
In addition to the six San Francisco
based schools, she also supported one
in Menlo Park and one in Mayfield.
In an interview with the Cheyenne
Sun in Feb. 1892 quoted by Psycholo
gy Prof. Alberta Siegel in her
Founder's Day speech on Apr. 5.
1998, Jane Stanford explained how
her interest in children's issues began.
After supporting a preschool for
disadvantaged children in San Fran
cisco. she visited the school with her
son and brought gifts for the children.
"1 had lived all my life up to that
time entirely lor my own pleasures,
but the experience of that day and the
joy expressed by the children over the
insignificant gilts I had brought them
... opened my eyes to a phase of life
that 1 did not realize existed, and I
thank God I have never closed them
since." Jane Stanford said.
"When we came out. my boy said
'Mamma. 1 think that is the best thing
you ever did in your life.' My whole
life changed from that hour."

Her legacy
In the end it was this love of young
people and a commitment to their de
velopment that motivated Jane Stan
ford to achieve the goals she and her
husband set when their son died.
"I could lay down my life for the
University," she wrote in a letter
dated Dec. 14, 19(X). quoted by Jor
dan in his Founder's Day speech.
"Not for any pride in its perpetu
ating the names of our dear son and
ourselves, its founders," she contin
ued. "but for the sincere hope I cher
ish in its sending forth to the world
grand men and women who will aid in
developing the best there is to be
found in human nature."
Jane Lathrop Stanford died on
Feb. 28,1905, at the age of 76 while on
holiday in Honolulu.
At that time, Jordan, her long
time personal friend and sometime
business rival, said. "No one outside
the University can understand the
difficulties in her way in the final es
tablishment of the University, and
her patient deeds of self sacrifice can
be known only to those who saw
them from day to day.
"Some day the world may under
stand a part of this. It will then know
her for the wisest, as well as the most
generous, friend of learning in our
time."

Editor's note: This is the fifth in a
scries of five articles commemorating
the five most important people in
Stanford's history. At No. I is Jane
Stanford. After the passing of her hus
band and University founder Leland
Stanford, she managed the University,
seeing it through a period of financial
worry. Her dedication to the areas of
education, women's rights and chari
ty, as well as her perseverance in mak
ing Stanford a top-level University,
distinguish Jane Stanford as the Uni
versity's most important person of the
20tlt century.

"The legend of Jane Stanford is
remarkable," said School of I luman
ities and Sciences Dean Malcolm
Beasley. "I suspect the reality is pret
ty amazing, too."
Certainly few would argue with
the former statement and.in these
days of frenzied progress and fading
history.
In 1893. in the face of sweeping fi
nancial panic, the overwhelming task
of starting a successful university and

her own grief at her husband's death,
Jane Stanford managed to save the
University that she and her husband
had dreamed of and put it well on its
way to international fame.
Throughout this time. Jane Stan
ford remained a friend of the
women's movement, an advocate for
underprivileged children and a
strong supporter of quality education
for students of all classes.
"Students today owe a real debt of
gratitude to Jane," said University
Archivist Maggie Kimball. "She re
fused to allow the University to close
when legal and financial problems
seemed insurmountable. She made
sure that Stanford would survive her
and carry on far into the future."
A privileged childhood
Jane Eliza Lathrop was born on
Aug. 25. 1828 in Albany, NY. the

great-granddaughter of Reverend
John Lathrop, the minister of Old
South Church in Boston, whose ser
mon led to the revolutionary Boston
Tea Party.
The child of relatively wealthy, so
cially aware parents. Jane Lathrop
was brought up in a very duty-con
scious and religious household. She
was educated at the Albany Female
Academy, which provided Jane with
;i solid educational background that
was standard for women of her status
;il the time. Jane was being educated
at the time the American women's
movement was beginning to gain mo
mentum.
life with J-cliiikl
Oil Sept. 30, I<S5(). when Jane was
22. she married Leland Stanford, an
enterprising young lawyer and a fel

low Albany resident of similar family
background. After a number of
moves that went from Michigan to
California and back to Albany, the
Stanfords finally settled in California,
where Leland was named president
of the new Central Pacific Railroad
Company of California and inaugu
rated governor of California on Jan.
10.1862.
Leland served one term as gover
nor before dedicating his energy en
tirely to the railroad and achieving a
great deal of success there. In the
midst of Leland Stanford's growing
fame and fortune, Leland Stanford
Jr.. the Stanfords' first child after IS
years of marriage, was born on May
14. IX6B.
The Stanfords raised their son
with the express goal in mind of
grooming him to fill his father's busi
ness positions. His academic curiosi
ty. particularly in the areas of foreign
language and historical collecting,
was greatly encouraged, which often
resulted in a great deal of travel for
Leland Jr.
It was on one such trip that the
Stanford heir became ill with typhoid
fever and died on March 13. 1884, in
Florence, Italy, two months before
his 16th birthday.
Founding of a dream
This tragedy, along with Leland
Sr.'s dream, in which he woke with
the words, "The children of Califor
nia shall he our children." on his lips,
prompted the Stanfords to found a
university in their son's honor.
Within a year of his son's death.
Leland Sr. became a California sena
tor and established plans for the Uni
versity. The Stanfords appointed a
Board of Trustees and David Starr
Jordan was named the University's
first president after leaving his post as
president at Indiana University.
The University opened on Oct. 1.

1891, six years after the Stanfords
founded it. with 465 students of both
sexes and 15 instructors. Although
Jane Stanford had agreed and
planned to speak at the University's
opening, she chose not to. and Inter
wrote to Jordan explaining why.
In her letter, quoted in (iunther
Nagel's 1975 book "Jane Stanford:
I Icr Life and Letters," she explained.
"My heart grew faint at such an or
deal, and I could not bring my mind to
face such an audience and read this
address."
She also enclosed a copy o! the ad
dress she had planned to read.
"While Mr. Stanford has dilated
on book education," she wrote, "I de
sire to impress upon the minds of
each one of these students, both male
and female, that we have at heart and
very closely hope that you will each
strive to place before yourselves a
high moral standard; that you will re
solve to go forth from these class
rooms determined in the future to be
leaders with high aims and pure stan
dards; and live such lives that it will be
said of you that you are true to the
best you know."
Jane Stanford on co-education
Jane Stanford also paid particular
attention in her address to the matter
of co-education, which she under
stood to be central to the I Jniversity's
mission.
"Jane Stanford and her husband
[were| committed to gender equity at
Stanford, something rare at the time
of the founding of the University,"
said School of 1 ducation Dean
Richard Shavelson.
Jane Stanford wrote in her ad
dress, "I am also anxious that these
young men should treat the young
ladies who have entered this institu
tion with the greatest deference;" she
wrote, "that they will be helpful in
aiding and cheering them in their am
bition fora thorough education.
"We have started you both on the
same equality, and we hope for the
best results."

Coping with death
Shortly after the University's
opening, after spending a consider
able amount ol time traveling to dif
ferent spas in hopes of bolstering Le
land Stanford Sr.'s ailing health, the
Senator died in his sleep on June 21.
1K93 at the age of 69. Jane Stanford
was 65 at the time.
Jane Stanford described the days
following the Senator's death some
years later in her dedication for the
Thomas Wclton Stanford Library,
dated Nov. I. IN9B.
She said ol the time after her hus
band's death. "There followed this
dreadful sorrow , developments and
experiences such as the world could
not understand or believe. ... Fora
while I fell like one on a sinking ship
on a tempestuous sea ... 1 wanted to
join my loved ones and was not afraid
to die.
"Suddenly there loomed up be
fore me the blessed work left to my
care by my loved ones, and I felt that
my course was cowardly. I was so im
pressed by the new light which
dawned over me it brought the first
tears to my eyes."
Jane Stanford had played an equal
role in plans for the University, but
maintained her role as wife and
mother as her central occupation.
I lowever. with the death of her hus
band. Jane Stanford stepped into the
toreground to carry their shared
dream.
Financial troubles
I his proved to be a more difficult
task than anyone could have antici
pated. Iceland Stanford Sr.'s estate
was tied up in probate court, which
meant that officials were evaluating
the distribution of the estate's wealth
and this money could not be used
until the process was complete. Since
the Stanfords were using their per
sonal funds tooperate the University,
there were no moneys available from
the estate to keep the University run

ning.
Although the Stanfords had in
tended the estate to essentially serve
as the University's endowment, this
had not been documented formally,
so the Court could not recognize that
the estate had any monetary respon
sibility to the University.
To make matters worse, the entire
country was in the throes of a finan
cial panic that threatened to bank
rupt all the Western railroads, includ
ing the Central Pacific Line of which
Leland Stanford Sr. had been presi
dent.
Anticipating this disaster, the U.S.
government filed suit against the
Stanford estate, demanding that all
outstanding railroad construction
loans be paid immediately. None of
the loans were due yet and. thus, it
seemed that the government had no
legal grounds for their case, but the
outcome of the lawsuit was still un
certain.
Everyone concerned with the af
fair advised and expected Jane Stan
ford to close the University. They saw
no way to operate the University
without a reliable source of funding.
Working through the problems
After two weeks of seclusion and
meditation following Leland Stan
ford Sr.'s death, Jane Stanford an
nounced that the University would
remain open with the $ 1 ().(KK) award
ed her bv the probate court for the es
tate's regular monthly expenses.

her interest in children's issues began.
After supporting a preschool for
disadvantaged children in San Fran
cisco. she visited the school with her
son and brought gifts for the children.
"1 had lived all my life up to that
time entirely lor my own pleasures,
but the experience of that day and the
joy expressed by the children over the
insignificant gilts I had brought them
... opened my eyes to a phase of life
that 1 did not realize existed, and I
thank God I have never closed them
since." Jane Stanford said.
"When we came out. my boy said
'Mamma. 1 think that is the best thing
you ever did in your life.' My whole
life changed from that hour."

Her legacy
In the end it was this love of young
people and a commitment to their de
velopment that motivated Jane Stan
ford to achieve the goals she and her
husband set when their son died.
"I could lay down my life for the
University," she wrote in a letter
dated Dec. 14, 19(X). quoted by Jor
dan in his Founder's Day speech.
"Not for any pride in its perpetu
ating the names of our dear son and
ourselves, its founders," she contin
ued. "but for the sincere hope I cher
ish in its sending forth to the world
grand men and women who will aid in
developing the best there is to be
found in human nature."
Jane Lathrop Stanford died on
Feb. 28,1905, at the age of 76 while on
holiday in Honolulu.
At that time, Jordan, her long
time personal friend and sometime
business rival, said. "No one outside
the University can understand the
difficulties in her way in the final es
tablishment of the University, and
her patient deeds of self sacrifice can
be known only to those who saw
them from day to day.
"Some day the world may under
stand a part of this. It will then know
her for the wisest, as well as the most
generous, friend of learning in our
time."
