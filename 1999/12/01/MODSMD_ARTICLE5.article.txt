Editor's note: This is the fifth in a
scries of five articles commemorating
the five most important people in
Stanford's history. At No. I is Jane
Stanford. After the passing of her hus
band and University founder Leland
Stanford, she managed the University,
seeing it through a period of financial
worry. Her dedication to the areas of
education, women's rights and chari

fused to allow the University to close
when legal and financial problems
seemed insurmountable. She made
sure that Stanford would survive her
and carry on far into the future."
