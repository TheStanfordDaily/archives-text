## Tennessee overcomes Cardinal with late-game run 
### Kelsey Colvin Contributing writer 
Not often does a loss at home re
sult in a standing ovation from the
fans. But the 6,122 in attendance for
Friday night's women's basketball
game gave the Cardinal just that, de
spite the fact that Tennessee beat the
Stanford hosts 79-73.

■ Friday: No. 5 Tennessee (2-1) 79
No. 23 Stanford (2-1) 73.

" This is as good as it gets in terms
of college atmosphere — with great
fans, very enthusiastic," said Cardinal
head coach Tara VanDerveer. "I
think both teams gave the fans every
thing they could ask for in terms of
the intensity and how well the game
was played.'*
And it most definitely was very in
tense. Tennessee attacked the Cardi
nal with ferocity on both ends. The
team disrupted the Stanford offense
with a barrage of different defenses,
ranging from full-court pressure to a
three-fourths trap.
But the Stanford team was able to
respond, led by the consistently
scrappy play of senior guard Milena
Flores.

"Milena. I thought, did a great job
of breaking people down. I think she
was tht_* best guard on the floor,"
VanDerveer said. "She gave us a
chance to win the game."
T he Cardinal held the lead at half
time by a score of 41-39, behind the
play of senior guards Flores and
Christina Batastini. Flores had 12
points at the half (she finished the
game with 14), and Batastini had nine
after being 6 lor 6 at the free-throw
nnrr
Much of the first half was played at
the free-throw line. The Cardinal
made 13 of 17 free throw attempts,
while the Lady Vols were at the line
only 11 times, making 10.
Tennessee head coach Pat Sum
mitt said a deciding factor in the out
come of the game was that her team
had only five fouls in the second half,
allowing the ("ardinal only three free
throw attempts. The Cardinal was
called for 12 fouls in the second half,
allowing the Lady Vols 16 free-throw
attempts.
Sophomores Cori Enghusen and
Bethany Donaphin spent most of the
game on the bench in foul trouble,
which disabled the Cardinal offense.
Donaphin had only two points for the
game and played only 12 minutes be
fore fouling out with four minutes, 46

seconds left to go in the game. En
ghusen played only six minutes but
she did not score.
Junior forward-center Carolyn
Moos stepped up for the Cardinal in
the key. She was the leading scorer
for the team with 16 points. Moos hit
a three-pointer with 4:06 to go in the
game, giving the Cardinal a lead that
lasted until Tennessee forward Tami
ka Catchings hit a three-pointer with
just more than a minute to go.
Moos, Flores, junior forward
Sarah Dimson and sophomore wing
Enjoli Izidor led the Cardinal with
five rebounds a piece. This was the
first game in the Cardinal's regular
season in which it was out-rebounded
by the opponent. Tennessee had 40
rebounds to the Cardinal's 26, and
made 23 second-chance points.
"I was disappointed with our re
bounding," VanDerveer said. "If we
want to be playing with Tennessee or
teams like Tennessee, we have to re
bound better."
But it was anybody's game to win
with less than a minute to go. Moos
and freshman guard Jamie Carey hit
some important shots in the final
minutes of game — Carey ended the
game with 14 points, 11 in the sec
ond half. And the play was charged,
with the momentum balanced

equally in the aggressive play of
both teams.
But Stanford turnovers led to
Tennessee opportunities. An offen
sive rebound and putback by Ten
nessee center Michelle Snow put the
Lady Vols up by four with 16 seconds
left in the game. The Tennessee vic
tory was solidified by two free throws
by Tennessee freshman Kara Law
son with only five seconds in the
game. ' -
"1 thought we played a grcafTT 1 "'
minutes. Unfortunately we had some
turnovers at the end of the game,
didn't finish on some shots, they got
some offensive boards," Van-
Dcrveer said.
"1 thought tonight was a great win
for our basketball team. I told them
they should be proud of themselves."
Summitt said. "Stanford made some
incredible shots, the kind that really
can just break you if you let it break
you. And I thought we did a great job
of stepping out of bounds. Abound
ing the ball and attacking them as op
posed to really letting them affect
us."
" I think it would be an insult to our
team if I was happy," VanDerveer
said. But she added, if there is such
a thing as a good loss, it is a good
loss."
