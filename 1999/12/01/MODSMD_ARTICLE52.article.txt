## Stifling the Great Dayne 
### 
Ben Jones

They say that everything in Texas
is big. Ron Dayne is not from
Texas, and he is big too.
ITie 5-foot, 10-inch, 252 — let's
call it 275 pound — bowling ball with
eyebrows has racked up some big
yardage as well this season.

This year, Dayne has rumbled for
1 ,X34 yards on the ground fora career
total of 6,397 yards. With a 216-yard
performance against lowa in Wis
consin's season finale, Dayne broke
Kicky Williams' year-old record for
career rushing yardage.
And this could mean big trouble
in the Rose Bowl fora Stanford de
fense that has had its trouble this
year.
Sports Illustrated's prediction
when Stanford clinched its berth in
the granddaddy of 'em all was that
Dayne would collapse from exhaus
tion after posting 400 yards against
the Stanford defense in a 42-41 Wis
consin victory.
Okay, that's the hype.
Now fora dose of reality.
Yes, Ron Dayne will be successful
running the ball against the Stanford
defense. Yes, he could make the dif
ference in the game. But, yes, Stan
ford has a chance to stop Dayne and
come away with a win.
What? The Stanford team that's
currently ranked No. 110 in the coun
try in total defense having played
most of its games in the "weak" Pa
cific I0( onference has a shot at beat
ing the No. 4 Badgers, who have put
together a stellar 9-2 season in the
perennially difficult Big 10?
That's right, the same Stanford
team that rebounded from a 69-17
shellacking at the hands of Texas to
win eight games this season. The
same Stanford team that oVercame
a loss to the usually hapless San Jose
State Spartans to reach the No. 22
spot in the country, the first time a
Stanford team has been ranked in
the top-25 since 1997. The same
Stanford team that was picked to
finish eighth in the Pac-10 and won
the conference title outright with a
7-1 record.
The Cardinal will likely be dou
ble-digit underdogs against the
Badgers, but Stanford has been un
derdogs all year.
I here are two reasons Stanford
will have a chance to prove the crit
ics wrong Jan. I.
l irst, if the Y2K bug shuts down

the power grid and the lights in the
Rose Bowl.. .just kidding.
Stanford has a legitimate chance
to win because the Cardinal match
es up well against Wisconsin and be
cause Stanford is playing with the
most valuable of intangibles
heart.
The Cardinal offense, ranked
No. 4 in the nation, will be among
the toughest the Badgers will face
all year. Stanford's passing attack,
ranked 11th in the nation behind se
nior quarterback I'odd llusak and
receiving corps led by the recently
named Pac-1() Offensive Player of
the Year Troy Walters will test the
Badger pass defense in a way that
only Purdue and Drew Brees have
so far this year.
The Cardinal attack is also aided
by the emergence of an improved
running game as offensive coordi
nator Bill Diedrick's running back
by committee lineup of Brian Allen.
Kerry Carter, Casey Moore and
Coy Wire have begun to show signs
of big-play ability in the season's
closing games.
The Cardinal defense also match
es up relatively well against the Wis
consin offense. Stanford has strug
gled this year against the pass, giving
up big chunks of yardage through the
air to Texas, San Jose State and
Washington, but Wisconsin comes
into the game ranked 10th in the Big
10 in pass offense, averaging an ane
mic 145 yards per game.
The game likely will hinge, pre
dictably. on Stanford's ability to stop
Dayne and the Badger rushing game.
The Cardinal are currently ranked
sixth in rushing defense in the Pac-10,
giving up nearly 14K yards per game
on the ground. The Cardinal interior
lineman and linebackers will have to
step up to stop Dayne's rhinocerous
esque charges through the middle.
None of these statistics take into
account the heart factor though,
which has propelled the Cardinal
through much of this season. From
the "Trench Dogs" to the pledge bv
the seniors after 199K's Big Game
that the Cardinal would, in tact, be
playing in this year's Rose Bowl, the
Stanford season has been one domi
nated by emotion. Such determina
tion is evident just in the obstacles
that this year's team has overcome.
And one can never discount the
importance of will and desire to influ
ence the outcome of a football game.
The emotional leadership of se
niors such as Walters and defensive
lineman Willie I loward will have the
Cardinal ready fora showdown in
Pasadena with Dayne and Badgers.

7-inches that not everything in lex as is
