# Rose Bowl perfect end to Hollywood season
## Football squad overcomes adversity for a berth in the granddaddy of 'em all 
### Ben Freda Editorial staff 
Maybe it's fitting that the Rose
Bowl is in Pasadena, so close to the
home of movie stars and I lollywood
bigwigs. Because Stanford's season,
which will end there Jan. I, has been
perfect enough to be taken straight
from the script of a blockbuster hit.
The ('ardinal's season had charac
ters. Adversity. I Jps and downs. And.
most important, irony. ()h boy, did it
have irony.
I .ike "being pickcd to finish ninth
in the Pacific 10 Conference, in front
of only a pitiful Washington State
team, but insisting that the team was
going to prove its detractors wrong
and surprise a lot of'people. TTie team
said it had a chance for the title, and it
was going to start to prove it in the
team's first game.
And what happened? Stanford
lost — no, got destroyed — 69-17 at
Texas in a game where the Cardinal
resembled a VW Bug getting
smashed by a Mack truck.
And now the VW Bug is ranked
No. 22 and is going to the Rose Bow l?
Ironic.
Irony, like starting the season with

a solid offense but an unproven de
fense. And having that defense go
from second-worst in the Pac-10 to
worst in the Pac-10, and. by the time
the Cardinal was embarassed by a
San Jose State team that was having a
tough time in the Western Athletic
Conference, worst in all of Division I
A football.
And now that defense is going to
face No. 5 Wisconsin and its potent
running back Ron Dayne, who two
weeks ago broke the record for most
career rushing yards ever in the
NCAA. Dayne may be the best run
ning back ever to play the game. And
it will be up to Stanford defense to
stop him. Ironic.
But as any I lollvwood producer
will tell you, blockbuster movies are
all about characters. And there was
no shortage of chracters on the Car
dinal squad.
Enter the coach. Taciturn and
silent, Tyrone Willingham's face be
trays zero emotion. A few days be
fore Big Game, which was it) be the
biggest game of Willingham's career
because if the Cardinal won it the
team would go to the Rose Bowl, a
reporter asked Willingham if he was
excited for his team. The question

was a slow-pitch soft ball, one that was
designed so that Willingham would
be able to slam it out of the park, talk
at length about his team and give the
reporters in attendance a long quote
from Willingham.
So Willingham took the question.
I le paused, sat back, took a breath,
and answered: "1 am."
But the characters who would
command more of the focus are actu
ally on the field. Enter the seniors.
This year's football team was led.
emotionally and physically, by se
niors Todd I lusak and Troy Walters.
I lusak. the Cardinal quarterback
who was named lo the first-team All-
Pac-10 Team Monday, led the most
explosive offense the Farm has seen
since John Elway. After the opening
day loss to Texas, the team went on a
rampage, scoring 104 points over the
next two games and beating then-No.
IIJl l J Arizona and then-No. 17 UCLA
in the ensuing weeks. Husak, al
though he missed part of the UCLA
game and all of the loss against San
Jose State, is largely responsible for
running an offense that is a constant
threat.
Alter Saturday's last-second vic
tory over Notre Dame, 1 lusak'scom

ments belied his trust in the explo
siveness of the Cardinal offense.
"I like the way it ended with a two
minute drive," he said. "1 thought
they had made a mistake giving us a
minute and a half. Any time you have
receivers like we do, it puts a lot of
pressure on the defensive backs."
Husak is referring to receivers
such as Walters, a senior who was
turning heads even before the season
started. Monday, his record-setting
season earned him Pac-10 Offensive
Player of the Year honors. Walters
set a new Pac-10 record with 1,456
yards receiving. He also netted Pac
-10 career records in receptions (245)
and receiving yards (3,995).
Walters was also involved in the
longest passing play in Pac-10 history
when quarterback Joe Borchard
passed to him from the 2-yard line.
Walters ran 98 yards fora touch
down.
"You could talk for four years and
still be talking about what Troy has
done for Stanford," Willingham said.
But those characters, and the rest
of the Stanford team, have one more
act to go. It opens Jan. 1, and there's
only one showing. All the story needs
is an ending.
