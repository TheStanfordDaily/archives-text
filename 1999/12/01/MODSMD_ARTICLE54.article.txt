# Dayne leads powerful Badger attack
## RB, tough defense to greet Cardinal 
### Tim Kane Contributing writer 
Analyzing the Wisconsin football
team isn't too difficult. Even before
viewing a single videotape or reading
a single scouting report. Stanford
coaches know it comes down to one
thing — stopping Ron Dayne.
Of course, when you consider
Dayne is 5 feet. 10 inches, weighs in at
252 pounds with 4.5 speed in the 40-
yard dash and levels linebackers like
a Mack truck, "stopping" becomes a
relative term. The frontrunner for the
Heisman Trophy, Dayne broke
Ricky Williams' career college rush
ing record of 6,279 yards and current
ly stands at 6,379 yards for his career,
with 1,834 of those yards coming this
season.
Averaging 166 yards a game.
Dayne will represent a huge chal
lenge for Stanford's maligned de
fense, especially if defensive tackle
Willie Howard is unable to play.
Head coach Barry Alvarez led
Wisconsin to a 9-2 record and an
undisputed Big 10 championship,
with a 7-1 record in the conference.
While Wisconsin's nonconference
opponents are somewhat less than
impressive — Murray State is in Divi
sion I-A A, and Ball State and Cincin
nati both finished last in their confer
ences — the Big 10 is undoubtedly
one of the toughest conferences in
the country, unlike the oft-criticized
Pac-10.
Incrediblv, the Badgers lost their

game at Cincinnati, which is at the
bottom of Conference USA. 17-12.
Sound familiar? Stanford lost at
home to Western Athletic Confer
ence cellar-dweller San Jose State 44-
39.
Unlike the Cardinal, which is
making its first postseason trip to
Pasadena in 28 years, the Rose Bowl
is nothing new for Dayne and the
Badgers. Last year, the Wisconsin
running back went into Pasadena to
face a UCLA team with a defense
ranked just under l(X)th in the coun
try, much like Stanford this year.
What did Dayne do? He flattened
the Bruin defense for 246 yards and
four touchdowns, receiving Rose
Bowl MVP honors for his effort.
In stark contrast to Stanford, the
Badgers' offense entirely relies upon
its running to win games, as their
passing game ranks 97th out of 114
Division 1-A teams, and the team's
leading receiver. Chris Chambers,
has only 502 yards on the year. Red
shirt freshman Brooks Bollinger
starts at quarterback for the Badgers,
and is learning on the job — but his
primary role is to hand the ball off to
Dayne and get out of the way.
Wisconsin's pass defense will give
the Cardinal fits. Ranked fifth in the
country, comerback Jamar Fletcher
and safety Jason Doering lead a
tough, quick unit that will attempt to
clamp down on Stanford's receiving
trio of Troy Walters, Deßonnie Pitts
and Dave Davis.
Alvarez is one of the nation's

finest coaches — in a state without a
significant amount of talent, he has
built Wisconsin into a national power
in 10 years in Madison, taking a last
place team in 1 WO and directing it lo
three Rose Bowls during his tenure.
After undergoing a hip replacement
operation in October and a knee re
placement, Alvarez has coached
from the press box. but his leadership
and strategic aptitude have apparent
ly not been affected, as the Badgers
have been perfect in his "absence."

Badger fans are some of the most
rabid in the country, and will accept
nothing less than a decisive victory,
especially in a year where the Pac-10
is presumed to be weak. Unlike Stan
ford, which may suffer from the "just
happy to be here" syndrome, the
Badgers have been in this position
before and know what it takes to win
the big games. It will take a phenom
enal performance by Stanford's ma
ligned defense to stop Ron Dayne
and bring the roses back to Palo Alto.
