# A 						key question
## Cardinal defense to lose baddest "dog"? 
### Ben Freda Editorial staff 
The pundits are already talking
about how the Cardinal's next game
— against Wisconsin in the Rose
Bowl Jan. 1 —will probably be an
out-and-out scorefest.
Usually, that would be alright for
the Cardinal. It usually wins those
games; witness Saturday's 40-37
shootout against Notre Dame.
But something occurred on the
field Saturday that should make
Cardinal fans just a little bit more
weary of Wisconsin's powerful run
ning game: senior Willie Howard
suffered a right knee strain in the
first quarter and was carted out of
the stadium.
It was unclear after the game ex
actly how serious the injury was.
"I feel good." Howard, who un
derwent an MRI on Monday, said.
"It'll be what the MRI and the
coaches say."
The results of the MRI were not
avaiable by press time.
Head coach Tyone Willingham
was more exacting.
"I'm not entirely sure." he said of
Howard's chances of returning
soon. "It looks like he'll miss two
weeks, maybe up to bowl practice,
which might lead to him missing
some of the game. I'm not sure."
The loss of 11oward is particular
ly frightening because the Cardinal
defensive line, which he anchors,
has been crucial to the Cardinal's
success.
The Cardinal defense is far from
perfect; in fact, it spent several
weeks this autumn as the last
ranked defense in all of Division 1-
A football. Currently it's ranked
No. 110 out of 114.
But a team doesn't usually go to
the Rose Bowl if its defense is real
ly that bad. One of the hidden se
crets of the oft-disparaged Stanford
defense is that it consistently makes
big plays at all the right times.
All season, defensive coordina
tor Kent Baer has been saying that
the Cardinal defense is better than
the numbers might indicate —
mostly because of this big-play po
tential.
"I want these kids to get credit
because they work hard and they
are better than everyone thinks
they are," Baer said after the Cardi
nal's victory at Arizona State.
There are plenty of examples of
the Cardinal defense's ability to pull
out a big play to put a game away.
In a crucial game against USC in
October, for example. Stanford
was ahead 35-31 and had the ball
with two minutes left. But after the
Cardinal failed to convert on
fourth-and-inches at midfield, the
Cardinal defense found itself on
the field, trying to contain a streak
ing Trojan offense with a minute
left to score a touchdown and grab
the victory.
But with no time on the clock, se

nior safety Tim Smith came up with
a huge interception at the Stanford
7-yard line that sealed the victory
and preserved Stanford's position
at the top of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence.
The Stanford defense, in typical
big-play form, stepped up again two
games later against Arizona State.
While the defense had some trouble
stopping the Sun Devils on third
downs in the second half, it was able
to come up with two huge plays —
an interception by senior Andrew
Currie that gave Cardinal quarter
back Todd Husak the ball on the
team's own 6-yard line and a fumble
return fora touchdown by Howard
— that strongly contributed to the
team's victory.
The game was typical of a de
fense that, despite its pitiful rank
ing, can rely on big plays to keep its
team afloat.
"The statistics can't be lying,
they're the truth." Howard said be
fore Big Game in an effort to de
fend the Cardinal defense, some
thing the squad has had to do often
this year. "But I think the part that's
not written down is our ability to
make big plays. We're winning this
way. If we try to change things, we
might start losing."
And therein lies the rub. The de
fense survives by making the big
play. And it is Howard who is the
center of this strategy.
But if Howard is out for the Rose
Bowl, the defensive squad will be
worse for it. How much worse is the
question.
"If he's not in the Rose Bowl, it
presents an opportunity for some
one else on the football team," Will
ingham said. "Will it be big foot
steps. big shoes to fill? No doubt."
On Saturday against Notre
Dame, senior Dorean Kass, a re
serve. stepped in for Howard and
made 10 tackles. But Kass won't be
able to replace I loward's emotional
leadership, which has led the team
to call itself "The Trench Dogs" and
wear heavy chains around their
necks.
Even without Howard, the de
fensive line is a formidible entity.
Senior outside linebacker Riall
Johnson leads the team in sacks and
has an uncanny ability to force
quarterbacks to flee the pocket.
Monday, he was named to the All-
Pac-10 Second Team. And senior
inside linebacker Marc Stockbow
er. who leads the team in tackles
with SI. will be able to step up as
well, if his stunning performance in
Big Game is any indication.
In any event, it won't just be
Howard whose eyes are focused on
MRI results. All of the Stanford de
fense — and the rest of the team —
will be straining to sec the results.
And if. God forbid, they say that
Howard can't play in the Rose
Bowl, the Cardinal defense will
have to figure out how to make big
plays without their big plavmaker.

team afloat.
"The statistics can't be lying,
they're the truth." Howard said be
fore Big Game in an effort to de
fend the Cardinal defense, some
thing the squad has had to do often
this year. "But I think the part that's
not written down is our ability to
make big plays. We're winning this
way. If we try to change things, we
might start losing."
And therein lies the rub. The de
fense survives by making the big
play. And it is Howard who is the
center of this strategy.
But if Howard is out for the Rose
Bowl, the defensive squad will be
worse for it. How much worse is the
question.
"If he's not in the Rose Bowl, it
presents an opportunity for some
one else on the football team," Will
ingham said. "Will it be big foot
steps. big shoes to fill? No doubt."
On Saturday against Notre
Dame, senior Dorean Kass, a re
serve. stepped in for Howard and
made 10 tackles. But Kass won't be
able to replace I loward's emotional
leadership, which has led the team
to call itself "The Trench Dogs" and
wear heavy chains around their
necks.
Even without Howard, the de
fensive line is a formidible entity.
Senior outside linebacker Riall
Johnson leads the team in sacks and
has an uncanny ability to force
quarterbacks to flee the pocket.
Monday, he was named to the All-
Pac-10 Second Team. And senior
inside linebacker Marc Stockbow
er. who leads the team in tackles
with SI. will be able to step up as
well, if his stunning performance in
Big Game is any indication.
In any event, it won't just be
Howard whose eyes are focused on
MRI results. All of the Stanford de
fense — and the rest of the team —
will be straining to sec the results.
And if. God forbid, they say that
Howard can't play in the Rose
Bowl, the Cardinal defense will
have to figure out how to make big
plays without their big plavmaker.
