### 
On Nov. 20th one could
find two big signs at
Memorial Auditorium
that said in bright red lettering:
"PROHIBITED ITEMS —
WEAPONS, DRUGS, ALCO
HOL AND BACKPACKS."
Yes, hip-hop recently invad
ed Stanford University. And de
spite apparent apprehension,
the show was a spectacular suc
cess. Oh, and it was peaceful too.
The "Legendary Roots Crew
from Philly" rocked a sold-out
Mem Aud on the night of Big
Game. In an unprecedented
show of support for hip-hop cul
ture, nearly 1,500 students and
members of the surrounding
community witnessed The Roots
play a two-hour concert.
The group ended the show
with a spontaneous jam that in
cluded the theme songs to sever
al popular television shows, in
cluding "Diff'rent Strokes,"
"Good Times" and "Cheers."

Jonah Berger, the director of
the Stanford Concert Network,

was very pleased. "The show was vi
cious," he said. "I think it's definitely
the best show Stanford has seen in a
while. People came out. When The
Roots came on, people started moving
their feet. People definitely felt it!"
The Roots have recently been travel
ing a lot. Over a three-night span they
performed in San Francisco, Palo Alto
and Los Angeles. Catching up with a
band that spends about two-thirds of the
year performing is difficult, but Inter
mission managed to track down ?uest
love, the band's drummer and unofficial
spokesman, just before he headed out to
the bus.
Intermission: Tell me about how you
ended off the show tonight. What was
going through your head?
?uestlove: Oh, we're just stir crazy.
We've only done TV themes like five
times, you know. It just depends on
what the mood is. I just felt like crooning
to the ladies [laughter]. So I just picked
the song at that moment. Ladies love
TV. If the theme to "Dynasty" had some
lyrics to it, I'd be the first to be crooning
it!

I: What elements do you think make a
good stage show?
?: Entertainment, humor and talent.
I: What's the importance of the crowd
to your show?
?: Well, they warmed up to us in the last
part. So we gave it back. If the crowd
ain't responding — we've done shows
where we've stopped the show, turned
the equipment around and played for
the wall. I'm not saying we don't give a
s—, but it's like we perform for us and us
first. But it's for the crowd's enjoyment.
I: How often do you tour?
?: We don't even say we're on tour no
more because we just do dates. This year
we'll do about 250 shows. In 1999. Out
of 365 days. It's like three months are
dedicated to the States, and then two
months are dedicated to Europe and a
month for other miscellaneous places
like Asia, South America, Australia and
other spots.
I: Where was the last place you played
overseas?
?: Ee did Brazil back in October.

I: How did the crowd respond to you
over there?
?: They're more enthusiastic over there
than they are here. Because here you get
it everyday. There, they don't take it for
granted, so they're very open, very en
thused about it.
I: Tell me about the actual show in
Brazil.
?: It's the same. The shows that you get
here are the results of us doing it over
there, you know what I mean? We ex
periment over there first and then give it
to y'all here.
I: How do the media treat you over
there, in Brazil or Japan?
?: The media is relative, you know what
I'm saying? It's like who's covering it? It
just depends on who likes you. We're
not commercial, so we ain't on MTV
every three seconds, but the media's
cool.
I: Tell me a little bit about your Web
site.
?: We have the No. 1 artist-related Web
site on the net: www.okayplayer.com.
100,000 hits a day! We are just bum

rushing the system. We got D'Angelo.
We got Common. We got Black Star.
We got De La [Soul]. We got The Roots.
We got Erykah [Badu]. We got — milk!
[laughter] We got everything!
I: When did the okayplayer.com thing
come about? Were you involved in it
from the beginning?
?: Yeah, I'm the head of it. I'm the pres
ident. It came about the day our album
["Things Fall Apart"] came out.
I: And what made you decide to go on
the Internet this time?
?: Because that's the future. That's the
future of the world.
I: I wonder how come more artists don 7
go along with what Chuck D's doing on
the 'net?
?: They don't know. That's why I'm
scooping. That's why I got D'Angelo.
That's why I got Common. No one
knows about it. I could add the whole
world of black music right now because
they don't know or care about the Web,
you know what I'm saying? So I'm going
to take them over and show them the
way.

I: How do the media treat you over
there, in Brazil or Japan?
?: The media is relative, you know what
I'm saying? It's like who's covering it? It
just depends on who likes you. We're
not commercial, so we ain't on MTV
every three seconds, but the media's
cool.
I: Tell me a little bit about your Web
site.
?: We have the No. 1 artist-related Web
site on the net: www.okayplayer.com.
100,000 hits a day! We are just bum

rushing the system. We got D'Angelo.
We got Common. We got Black Star.
We got De La [Soul]. We got The Roots.
We got Erykah [Badu]. We got — milk!
[laughter] We got everything!
I: When did the okayplayer.com thing
come about? Were you involved in it
from the beginning?
?: Yeah, I'm the head of it. I'm the pres
ident. It came about the day our album
["Things Fall Apart"] came out.
I: And what made you decide to go on
the Internet this time?
?: Because that's the future. That's the
future of the world.
I: I wonder how come more artists don 7
go along with what Chuck D's doing on
the 'net?
?: They don't know. That's why I'm
scooping. That's why I got D'Angelo.
That's why I got Common. No one
knows about it. I could add the whole
world of black music right now because
they don't know or care about the Web,
you know what I'm saying? So I'm going
to take them over and show them the
way.
