# Emmylou Harris and Friends come to Stanford
## Six performers contribute to a concert for a land mine-free world 
### 
Emmylou Harris has always possessed a singular
voice. From her early days as Gram Parson's an
gelic vocal partner to her 1995 triumph as a shat
tered ghost on the endlessly moving "Wrecking Ball,"
Harris has always followed her own path.
Paradoxically, she has created starkly traditional
country ("Roses in the Snow") while also refusing to ac-

cept the genre boundaries
that confine country, rock,
folk and any other label in
flicted upon music by the
industry. The point is not
that she is a country singer
willing to tackle Jimi Hen
drix's "May This Be
Love," but that in doing
so, she created an achingly
beautiful and quietly dar
ing recording — challeng-

ing us to categorize it.
Indeed, Harris's independent spirit extends outside
the musical world as well. Joining forces with the Viet
nam Veterans of America Foundation (VVAF), Harris
has brought together a talented group of singer/song
writers to produce a series of Concerts fora Landmine
Free World. The performances are meant to raise pub
lic consciousness of the urgent need to address the neg
ative effects of land mines on a global scale.
The VVAF was a co-recipient of the 1997 Nobel
Peace Prize for its efforts in the International Campaign
to Ban Landmines. The aim of that initiative was an in
ternational treaty outlawing the manufacture, export,
stockpiling and use of antipersonnel land mines. Al
though 124 nations have already given their support, the
United States has not yet accepted the treaty.
Thus, the concerts intend to spark public discourse
concerning the U.S.'s reluctance to join the initiative.
The first performance will be on Dec. 1 at Stanford's
Memorial Auditorium, presented by Stanford Lively
Arts. The artists appearing include Harris, Bruce Cock
burn, Steve Earle, Patty Griffin, Nanci Griffith and John
Prine.
Like Harris, most of these singer / songwriters exist
in the difficult-to-classify "contemporary folk" category,
which emphasizes individuality over commercialism.
While these artists all have ties to Nashville, thay are, as
Cockburn puts it, living "outside the pail."
Steve Earle, for instance, has pursued a fiercely inde
pendent career in which he refused to get sucked into
the Nashville machine. After emerging with the promis
ing country-rock of "Guitar Town" in 1986, Earle deliv
ered a disturbing, acerbic masterpiece with "Copper
head Road," an album that chronicles the isolation and

paranoia of a Vietnam Veteran with
nothing left to lose.
Earle is now in the midst of a career
revival after surviving and overcoming
life-threatening chemical addictions in
the early '90s. His latest albums, such as
"Train A Comin'," "I Feel Alright,"
and "El Corazon," are moving testa
ments to the importance of overcom
ing one's own demons. Simply put,
Earle refused to die as a young legend.
Furthermore, these artists are all in
volved in the political world, as evi
denced by their participation in this
string of concerts. These convictions
have often come through in their music
— take a listen to Prine's wry "Your
Flag Decal Won't Get You Into Heav
en Any More," for an example.
Bruce Cockburn's career, in partic
ular, has taken a strong political slant
ever since the early '80s. Cockburn at
tributes this change to his first visit to
Central America. After experiencing
the chasm that separated the richest
from the poorest, he realized that "if 1
am going to live a privileged life, 1 am
going to have to give something back.
We have to learn what it really means
to love our neighbors."
Thus, Cockburn has adopted a
number of causes over the last two
decades. In his words, land mines have
created a "plague-like atmosphere"
throughout much of t! e world by
killing and maiming "those who are
completely innocent without any warn
ing."
Cockburn goes on to emphasize
that the land mine epidemic is "a pure
ly modern development which we have
inflicted upon ourselves," suggesting
that the industrialized nations bear re-

sponsibility for bringing this weapon
into developing regions. The treaty, which would ban all
antipersonnel land mines, is portrayed as a way of ac
cepting this responsibility.
Hence, the concert is an attempt to make the public
aware of the United State's reluctance to sign the treaty.
Cockburn describes the five California shows as "an ex
perimental leg" which might lead to broader plans to
bring the issue to more audiences across the country.
The format will be that of a "folk festival workshop,"

in which the singers will participate together, trading
songs back and forth. Therefore, their individualism will
blend together, both musically and politically.
In particular, many believe that Emmylou Harris's
greatest gift is joining her crystal soprano in harmony
with other voices. However, her gift seems to extend be
yond the musical realm. On Wednesday night, she and
her companions will give their vision for creating tangi
ble harmony in the real world.
