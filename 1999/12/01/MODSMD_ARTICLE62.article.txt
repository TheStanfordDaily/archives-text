# A 						Hunter in the City:
## Stephen Raphael interviews innovative guitarist Charlie Hunter

Charlie Hunter is certainly something
of an anomaly among musicians. Near
ly I0 years ago, he developed his eight
string guitar, which allows him to play
both bass and guitar simultaneously.
Since then, he has played with many
different groups, playing nearly every

play tonight at Bimbo's 365 club in San
Francisco. Recently, Intermission had
the opportunity to speak with Charlie
about his current tour and music in
general.

Intermission: Let's start by talking
about what it's like playing in a duo
setting. Do you find that it's a lot
more challenging playing with only
one other musician?
Charlie Hunter: Oh, definitely. I
mean, you're out there, you can't hide.
You're pretty exposed. But, that's also
the great thing, the thing I like about
it, the thing that really makes it a lot of
fun. I mean, no matter what music
you're playing, you should never go on
automatic pilot. But playing in a duo
makes it impossible to go on auto-pilot
because you have to be there, com
pletely present, 100 percent of the
time. There's just the communication
between myself and Adam when we're
up there, that's it.
I: I'm curious, it was a pretty revolu
tionary idea to try to cover the entire
rhythm section using an eight-string
guitar. Where did you come up with
that?
CH: It just came out of playing regular
guitar and trying to expand on the
ideas of people like Joe Pass and Tuck
Andress. And then I started to say,
well, I want to have more bass. And
I've just been developing it since then.

trying to develop the rhythmic
counterpoint, all that stuff. I kind
of had to teach myself, since no
one else was really doing it.

I: When you're playing, how do
you conceptualize the bass and
the guitar parts?

CH: Well, they're two separate
parts, but they also create a third part
when you play them together. There's
so many little facets to it and so many
different levels that it is hard to de
scribe it really. I try to think what
would sound good here, what would
sound good there, then mix them to
gether, and that's what it becomes.
It's like trying to take apart the
components of a drum beat. You know
the bass drum sounds good if it's going
"boom, ch boom, ch boom, boom
boom." And the snare drum will be
doing something else. But what I'm lis
tening to is the whole as well as the in
dividual parts.
I: We've talked about where you're
coming from and what you're doing
now. Where do you see yourself going
next?
CH: I just want to keep developing my
own thing and hope I keep being
happy and satisfied with working on it,
you know? I'm going to make a record
with a couple percussionists and a cou
ple horn players next, maybe a brass
and a reed instrument, and we'll see
where that takes me. I expect to be
doing that this January.
I: Speaking of new albums, is there
anybody in the current music scene
who you're excited about?
CH: God, you know, I wish that were
the case. But the pop music scene is so
sad. It just seems like no one is really
very musical on it. And the jazz scene,
I don't know. I mean, there's Leon
Parker and Adam Cruz, who I play
with.
1 just like music where people are
truly playing what's honest and what
comes naturally to them. I just haven't
really heard enough stuff from people
my age or younger who are really play

ing honest and true music that makes
me excited.
I: Do you think there's some genera
tional reason for that?
CH: Well, it's the music industry in
general. I mean, there's always great
music out there. But the music indus
try is in such terrible shape right now.
And, I think that the all-round greed
and incompetence of the people work
ing within the record industry has
made it so that young artists don't get
a chance to be developed the way they
need to be
So it's a real shame. But there's a lot
of great, great, great music waiting to
happen out there, and it's very difficult
for it to happen. But I have faith that
there's a bunch of people out there
doing great stuff, and it will come out.
I think that we're just in a real time of
flux right now. The music industry as
we have known it for the last 60 or 70
years has got to pretty much fall apart.
The means of getting the music to the
people has got to be reinvented, you
know? It's a real monopoly right now.
I mean, take MTV for example.
You turn on MTV, and you see the
same 10 videos in rotation. That's not
really much choice of music. And by
the time those videos have been made,
so many people in the music
industry — A&R [Artists &
Repetoire] people, presidents, vice
presidents, producers, directors —
have had such a say in that music and
have molded it to fit a market — or
what they think the market wants —
that there's really none of the real con
tent left.
The only thing that I really like
that's been out on the pop scene lately
is Lauryn Hill. And 1 think Sheryl
Crow is pretty musical too. D'Angelo,

when his record comes out, is going to
blow people away.
I: / understand that you were actually
involved with D'Angelo's latest
album.
CH: Oh yeah, that was great. He's a
great musician, and he plays the music
that he wants to play. And it was a
great experience. We just spent a cou
ple days in the studio playing, and t
guess that's what got on the record. I
don't think it's been released yet.
though.
I: Is there an underlying message he
hind your music?
CH: Yeah, I think that in most cul
tures, music has a spiritual component
that exists between the musicians and
the people who are listening. The mu
sicians aren't just there to make a ton
of money or whatever, although they
do get paid and make a living. But, it's
a musician's job to bring people's spir
its out, whether it means playing
gospel music for the glory of whoever
your God might be, or being a jazz mu
sician and just trying to get inside the
thing and make the groove happen and
work with the audience to make that
special thing happen. That's what I'm
trying to do. I just feel that's what's
missing in most of the music I hear,
and I just try to listen to music that
makes me feel that way.
There was a time when I would try
to play stuff that I thought was really
neat and intellectual and would attract
people into thinking that I was a nifty,
clever guy. But that wasn't me, I was
just subverting my natural tendencies.
I just feel like if you have the courage
to be yourself, which is a very, very
hard thing to do, the music will just
come out that way.
