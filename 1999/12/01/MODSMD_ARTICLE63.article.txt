# Kool Keith
## Black Elvis/ Lost in Space 
### 
Growing up near a small state col
lege, I would often make my
way onto campus after school.
There was always this guy there, portly,
bearded, with glasses. He would talk
about various topics. I remember dis
tinctly witnessing one conversation be
tween him and an illegally parked
American-made car discussing the mer
its of the ClA's hand in the JFK ordeal,
an argument that, at the time, I felt to be
reasonable. The conversation then ma
neuvered into the likelihood of Elvis ac
tually being dead, which was pretty
mundane if not for the argument that
"where do you think the people making
music these days get such fantastic
ideas?"
I, having recently purchased the Dig
ital Underground's "Sons of P," was in
clined to agree. Where were they getting
these ideas? Were they stealing them
using some futuristic time machine? In
deed, argued the portly man, it was
Elvis, living comfortably on a fully auto
mated, government-constructed space
ship, beaming signals back to earth, sig
nals portending his imminent return. I
sat and pondered this: One day Elvis
would return from space. That day
would be good.

I pick up the
new Kool Keith
album. Kool Keith,
if you're unaware,
has been described
as an "insane," "in
fluential," "schizo
phrenic," "sex
freak," "visionary"
"genius."
The album
cover is green with
pictures of Kool
Keith in numerous
vaguely futuristic
poses, with an Elvis
pompadour. You
can purchase this
pompadour for
$20. The CD is also
green, and vaguely
futuristic, more so
than most CD's are

vaguely futuristic. The liner notes are in
sane, hilarious. But the real fun starts
when the CD goes in the CD player...
"Black Elvis/Lost in Space," is a
conglomeration of funky, crazy beats
and rhythms, outlandish textures of
sounds and weird, wild effects. The com
bination is challenging and bizarre, yet

unconventionally smooth. Added to this
are strange hooks, often sung by a
vaguely feminine computer.
The kickers, of course, are the insane
stylings of Mr. Kool Keith himself,
stylings that range from an odd, para
noid sing-speak intro, to taut, complex
flows, to kinky, schizophrenic rapping,
to more smooth, styled-out deliveries.

The album, though flat at times, is an in
teresting, bizarre, challenging direction
into the future of hip-hop, which pro
vides funky, head-bobbing beats, over
layed with smooth, mellow hooks and
furious, insane flows. The Black, Elvis
has landed.
