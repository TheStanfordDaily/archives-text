## From Here to Eternity

When listening to the review copy of this live CD, my neighbor, who
I'd never seen, came by to tell me to turn it down. How punk rock.
Well, actually, it's not punk rock, but it's what passes for punk these
days.
You see, punk is dead. Any deluded soul who would like to debate this
point should listen to the Clash's 1982 album "Combat Rock." The over
produced, radio-friendly record made the question "Should I Stay or Should 1
Go?" seem rhetorical.
Against all reason the Clash stayed and excreted "Cut the Crap" in 1985
(showing punk not just dead but dismembered and interred) before calling it
quits. But it wasn't always like that.
Unlike fellow punks the Sex Pistols, the Clash have resisted the urge fora
cynical cash-in reunion. But then they always represented a very different
brand of British punk. While the Pistols made an asset out of musical igno
rance, the Clash actually experimented with different styles, such as the ska of

"(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais" and the reggae cover "Armagideon
Time."
Even when pounding out primitive tunes, they coupled the aggressive music
with equally potent lyrics, as in "Career Opportunities" and "What's My
Name." The Clash also showed a remarkable reverence to their musical pre
cursors, covering Bobby Fuller's "I Fought the Law" (with a misogynist
change of lyric) and name-checking Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs in "Cap
ital Radio."
In an era when punk often meant nihilism at best and nonsense at worse, the
Clash wrote songs about racism, repression and resistance. Their message was
defiant and positive, and songs such as "Guns of Brixton" and"The Magnifi
cent Seven" easily maintain their power.
This album was recorded between 1978 and 1982 and has all the above songs
along with others from the Clash canon such as "Complete Control" and
"Clash City Rockers." Given the span of dates, the sound is remarkably con
sistent. Everything sounds clear, and the audience is almost entirely absent,
except between tracks.
In fact, at times it's easy to forget you're listening to a live album, which
begs the question: why did they release one? Their self-titled debut and "Lon
don Calling" make better introductions to the band and certainly don't lack in
energy.
Perhaps (as the title hints) it's because now, 20 years later, the talent, ener
gy and message of the band have established them as one of rock's milestone
artists. So pick up this CD and relive the Winter of Discontent when you were
living in the cold-water flat in Hackney.
