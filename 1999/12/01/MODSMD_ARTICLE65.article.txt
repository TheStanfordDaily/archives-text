# The 						Charlatans UK
## 'Us and Us Only' 
### 
The Charlatans UK have really
horrible haircuts, and the cover
of this CD shows them off to per
fection. I would implore you to buy this
CD so that the Charlatans UK could af
ford better haircuts — this album is so
bad, they will have to keep cutting it

themselves.
"Us and Us Only" would he indie
roek if indie roek was really had. Their
sound goes from wannabe folk to
wannabe rock. In between these two
genres is a vast wasteland that this hand
seems to inhabit.
This is not to say that there are no
good songs on this CD. "Good
Witch / Bad Witch" is a moody, bass
heavy song with great distorted vocals. It
is a little bit goth, a little bit techno and a
little bit rock — altogether quite good.
The usually ordinary voice of Tim
Burgess, the cloying lead singer, is dis
torted just enough to make him sound as
though he has a future in my CD player.

One good song does not an album
make, however, and the Charlatans UK
are to be slapped on the hands heartily
for making the rest of the album. It is not
nearly the worst thing 1 have ever heard,
but it is so mediocre that I wonder why
they would bother even producing this
piece.
There are some good points, of
course, such as great bass lines — the
thumping, humping, deep bass on this
album is quite excellent, and one wishes
that it was not spoiled by the annoying
singing and completely vile harmonica.
The album is further ruined by the cover,
which looks decent from a distance but
for your own sake — do not look too
closely.
The cover includes numerous pic
tures of the fairly unattractive band
members trying to look artsy, along with
really bad lyrics printed on the sleeve.
The music is not quite as bad as the cover
suggests, but it is not much better either.
Thus, if you are into mediocrity,
please check out "Us and Us Only."
