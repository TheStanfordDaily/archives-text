The Artist Formerly Known as
I'rince hasn't recorded an album
in almost two years. His only pub
lic appearance in months was this sum
mer's MTV Music Video Awards. Origi
nally scheduled to perform "1999," the
Artist backed out at the last moment and
only agreed to introduce another per-

former.
The Artist's vacation from the spot
light has ended with the release of "Rave
Un 2 The Joy Fantastic."
The Artist is back, and with a scream.
"Rave" is an energetic compilation of
dance, techno, funk and anything else
that the Artist fancies. The album begins
with a scream that's patently Prince and is
completed with help from the talent of No
Doubt's (iwen Stefani, Sheryl Crow and
Ani DiFranco.
Like previous recordings,"Rave" is in
tensely erotic and about as overtly sug
gestive as an album can be. Tracks such as
"Hot Wit U" and "Silly Game" are never
crass, just extremely explicit.
In addition to these titles, "Rave" in
cludes both several fast dance runs (the

title track and second extra track, "Pretty
Man," are destined to be classics) as well
as softer, folkier tunes set to the rhythm of
funk. "Tangerine" explores the Artist's
recent obsession with colors and senses.
"Rave Un 2 The Joy Fantastic" goes
full force with the Artist's unique short
hand of U's and numbers replacing
words. The multimedia portion of the
album points you to two Web sites
(www.love4oneanother.com and
www.newfunk.com), which both use the
same shorthand. The site says it "takes a
little while 2 download, please b patient,"
but the visit is well worth the wait.
Both sites expose much of what makes
the Artist unique, such as his own reli
gious convictions, strong-held feelings
against animal abuse and. of course, love.
The Web site reports that a special edi
tion of "Rave" will be released soon. The
artist is allegedly going to perform next at
the New Year's Eve "Millennium of the
World" bash in Cairo.
Thus, "Rave Un2The Joy Fantastic" is
a powerful testament to the Artist's re
siliency and intense musical talent. After
all the shouting is done. Prince is still the
king of pop.
