# Save Ferris
## 'Modified' 
### 
It's hard not to like Save Fer
ris. How can you not like a
band that offers 12 straight
foot-tapping, heart-pounding
tracks on one CD? "Modified,"
which was released by Epic
Records on Oct. 19, is a pleasant
surprise from the California ska
band.
Much like their first hit, a
cover of "Come On Eileen," the
songs on "Modified" are full of
infectious energy and catchy
melodies. The highlights of the
album include "Mistaken," "The
Only Way To Be," "Let Me In"
and the hidden title track, "Mod
ified." "Modified" in particular
showcases lead singer Monique
Powell's deep, charismatic voice
and the band's ability to create
songs that get stuck in listeners'
heads.
Save Ferris emerged from the
ska underground around 1995
when four members of the band
Los Pantelones — guitarist
Brian Mashburn, bassist Bill
Uechi, saxophonist Eric Zamora
and trumpeter Jose
Castellanos — joined forces with
classically trained singer Powell
and trombonist T-Bone Willy.
Their newest album also intro
duces drummer Evan Kilbourne
and features an agglomeration of
guest musicians, including Beck's
DJ Swamp.
The band has toured exten
sively. notably with bands Sugar
Ray and Reel Big Fish, and ap
peared in last year's Touchstone
Pictures film "Ten Things I Hate
About You."
Their newest album features a
wide variety of musical genres.
The songs range from classic ska
to jazzy grooves, and some tracks

even border on reggae and rock.
Most of the tracks are upbeat
and energetic, but the last listed
song, "Let Me In", reveals a
more melancholy, emotional
side of Save Ferris. Uechi, Mash
burn and Powell particularly
shine on this number.
"Modified" is undoubtedly an
instrumental success; the musi
cians expertly execute the

melodies with attitude and spirit.
Powell's voice also has great
range and is full of character.
The band's only weakness is
songwriting. Powell and Mash
burn, who co-wrote most of the
tracks, come up with catchy lyrics
but express nothing too pro
found. The lyrics consist of the
typical rhyming words and in
your-face declarations of ska

music in general. For example,
on "I'm Not Crying For You,"
Powell declares, "Please listen
when I say / That there's no way
that I will stay" and "Nothing
that I say / Will bring back yester
day."
On the whole, however,
"Modified" is a rocking good
time. Producer John Travis, who
has also worked with Sugar Ray

and Kid Rock, lends a hand in
creating this album, but "Modi
fied" primarily shines because of
the musical talent of Save Ferris's
members. The band asks you,
through the title of the albums
first track, to "Turn It Up," and
that's exactly what you'll want to
do.
