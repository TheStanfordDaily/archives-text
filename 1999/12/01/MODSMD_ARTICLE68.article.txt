## 'To The Teeth' 
### 
Another 10 months, another Ani DiFrancoalbum.
Actually, in addition to the two solo albums
DiFranco came out with in 1999, there's an
alburn she made with folk legend Utah Phillips, the first
two non-DiFranco releases for her self-owned record
label, Righteous Babe, and a guest appearance on the new
album by The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.
Artie (as Ani calls him) returns the favor on her newest
album, "To the Teeth," and he is a sign of her limes. Like
The Artist, Ani sings of both politics and love, both inno
vates and recombines and takes a stab at both the one
(wo)man band and funk mega-band approaches. ITiis is
also an album full of samples, hip-hop beats and guests
such as singer, saxophonist and soul legend Maceo Park
er, who opened for DiFranco on her last tour.
'Hie folk-rock hip-hop mix is a hard sell. Though she's
ventured in this area a bit before, and though this album
does recall January's transitional "Up Up Up Up Up Up,"
this is her first album that uses hip-hop elements in nearly
every song.
At first, the mix is hard to get used to, and this fact
combined with an average song length of five and a half
minutes makes "To The Teeth" a disappointing first lis
ten. This work isn't the rockfest most of her albums have
been.
After a while, though, the mellow groove catches a
hold of you, and the disappointment turns to enjoyment.
Even before then, you're sold on DiFranco's great lyrics;
in spite of the rate of an album or two a year, she never
runs out of things to say or extraordinary ways of saying
them.
Lyrically, the album contains perhaps the most explic
itly political lyrics DiFranco has written since her early
days.
ITie opening song, "To The Teeth," condemns those
who "profit off our blood" — the corporate sponsors of
American gun violence, the media and the gun lobbyists.
She closes, "And if I hear one more time about a fool's
right to his tools of rage, I'm gonna take all my friends and
I'm gonna move to Canada, and we're gonna die of old
age."
Poetry inspired by a topical issue could easily degener
ate into raw emotion or tired cliche. "1 lello Birmingham,"
about "pro-life" murders, instead touches a nerve both in
the heart and in the mind.
In spite of the provocative nature of the more political

songs, the overall feel of the album is quite low-key; it's the
type of album that one listens to late at night just before
going to bed. Most of the songs are introspective or ob
servational, and DiFranco excels at these artistic tasks.
There are some livelier songs — the tour song "Freak
show," the funky yet introspective "Wish I May" and the
jam song "Swing." In fact, most of the album is quite up
beat. The experimental "The Arrival's Gate" — a remix
and redo of "lip Up Up Up Up Up's" "Angry Any
more" — is a true joy.
However, the overall production keeps a lid on the
whole affair, which is good for "To The Teeth" but may
not necessarily be a good thing for the future. The album

is produced by DiFranco and engineered by her husband,
Andrew Gilchrist, and seems to be toned-down largely
because of this. A lot of these songs could be real rockers
if produced by someone else, but on this album their
grooves are, for better or worse, tamed.
"To The Teeth" is among DiFranco's strongest al
bums, but one can't escape the feeling that future albums
will be served by a bit of a change. Flowever, change has
always been a hallmark of DiFranco's work, so in the year
2(XX)... well, we shall see. For now, pick up a copy of "To
The Teeth."
