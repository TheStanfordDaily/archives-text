# Mogwai
## EP+2 
### 
I hate when the first song of a CD is so good that you
can't stop listening to it, and you neglect all the
other songs just because track one happens to re
mind you of that time with your boyfriend in the rain in
Prague or the sad day when you buried your guinea pig
or the year that you wore all black and quoted Niet
zsche.
Eventually guilt takes over, and resigned, your finger
hits the fast-forward button.
And guess what? Inevitably, tracks two, three, four
and five have nothing to do with Prague, dead pets or even
nihilism, and thus you find yourself returning to song nu
mero uno, realizing that record companies really know

what they're doing when they release the first song of a
CD as a radio single.
Such would be the case with Mogwai's lovely but
rather uneventful new EP. "Stanley Kubrick," the open
ing song, easily could have been the theme song for East
ern Europe or alienation, with quiet guitars guiding an el
egant melody and delicate drumming sustaining the
rhythm. Kids, believe me — the song is perfect.
Unfortunately, everything after that seems to be a sat
isfactory but less interesting rehash of "Stanley Kubrick."
Mogwai, which consists of five boys from Glasgow, are
the self-proclaimed pioneers of "sportz goth" (whatever
that is) and could best be described as a unique mix of

post-rock, Rachcl's and Spiritualized. They have gained
quite a rep for crafting intriguing, vocal-less songs that
blend both the quiet and the loud.
On this CD, Mogwai appears to have left behind its
past usage of fast and loud elements, and this change
makes fora collection that is a bit too uniform in its sound,
providing few surprises from one song to the next.
Hut this Mogwai ED is hardly bad and makes for great
rainy background music. "Stanley Kubrick." however, is
non-weather specific and perfectly tailored for your in
dulgence in overblown, indelible memories of yesteryear.
