## 'Joy: A Holiday Album' 
### 
Christmas albums generally fall into two
categories: the extremely traditional
ones that promote sing-alongs and the
ones that contain songs that the artists them
selves have created to be "holiday" songs. With
"Joy: A Holiday Collection," Jewel has man
aged to strike a balance between these two ap
proaches, offering a mix of holiday songs that
are touched by her own eclectic style.
The album is divided into two parts. The first
half contains renditions of classic holiday songs
such as "Joy to the World" and "Ave Maria." A
choir accompanies Jewel's melodic voice in
some of these folksy interpretations and for the
most part avoids sounding too cheesy.
The second half bears her own pop / folk
holiday material such as "Face of Love" and
"Gloria." To her credit. Jewel's creations are
enjoyable and not as embarrasing as some
"original" songs on other artists' Christmas al
bums.
However, Jewel makes some questionable
stylistic interpretations. For example, tradi
tionalists might feel that yodeling and the
Hawaiian slack key guitar do not belong in
"Winter Wonderland." She tries to be cute on
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" by
singing it with a twang and syncopation. Rather

than being charming, the song becomes annoy
ing.
Fortunately, Jewel's voice is as clear and nu
anced as ever. She varies from using her nasal,
attitude-filled voice reminiscent of "Who Will
Save Your Soul" from her debut album, to an
airy, operatic voice on "Ave Maria" and "Glo
ria." There are times when her voice has to
stretch to hit the high notes, such as on "O Holy
Night," but her voice is euphonious on songs
that stick to the octaves in the alto range.
There are indeed some gems on this album.
A soulful version of "Go Tell it on the Moun
tain" is accompanied by a gospel choir in a
rousing chorus. "Silent Night" and "Hark! The
Herald Angels Sing" are kept in their tradition
al forms, yet Jewel adds her own silvery touch
es to make the songs sound new.
On the whole, the album is enjoyable and a
worthy addition to any CD collection. The gen
eral crescendo throughout the album — the
first songs being subdued and traditional, the
second half being more upbeat and lively —
makes this album great for background dinner
music or quiet study-time accompaniment
throughout the holidays.
