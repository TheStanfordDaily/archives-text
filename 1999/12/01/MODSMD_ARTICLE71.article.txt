# Vitro 'Distort'
## 
### 
Vitro, a British techno band,
debuts on the States' front
with the album "Distort,"
produced by American Recording's
Rick Rubin. The group, formed in
1994 by singer / guitarist Wayne
Simms, bassist / keyboardist Dave
Googe, drummer Jason Puncher and

keyboardist Darren Jelly, does a few
things well and have managed to grab
some acclaim for their accomplish
ments.
Rick Rubin's American Record
ing Company promotes such acts as
Slayer, System of a Down and the
Black Crowes. "Distort's" first and
best song, "Mentally Dull," showed
up on "South Park's" "Chef Aid"
album heayily remixed and almost
unrecognizable — and with Mr.Gar
rison speaking over it. But on Distort,
"Mentally Dull" is catchy, not too syn
thesizer-laden and slightly reminis
cent of teen-angst music.
Moving further into the album I
started to notice how much Vitro
sounds like Silverchair. I found this
odd as I figured that Australian
teenagers would have a fairly distinct
sound, at least when compared to 20-
somethings from the Essex country
side. I guess I was wrong.

"Orange" could come off of Silver
chair's "Frogstomp," and "Cynics"
sounds like a tainted mixture of
Garbage and Silverchair. Somehow,
these British rockers can sound both
feminine and Aussie. Go figure.
"Coming Down," the sixth track
on the album, slows down the pace

and sounds much more mellow
than the tracks surrounding it.
"Why don't you listen/To
what von know?" asks sinper

wnai yuu miuw : a;>K.;> Miigei
Simms, who wants "To be left
alone/Til I'm ready." Thus, Simms
sells himself as a poor man's Trent
Reznor — some guy who wants to be
left alone to stew in his own misery.
So Vitro sounds like a contorted
mixture of Nine Inch Nails, Silver
chair and Garbage. What redeems
this band? Good question. Vitro
sounds strong on a few tracks, but the
overall album is painfully inconsis
tent. If you like the aforementioned
groups, check out this band — this ef
fort shows how hard it can be fora
band to develop a distinctive sound.
Final verdict: this disc makes a
great Frisbee, long-range weapon or
way to annoy your roommate. My
roommate commented that "It's fair
ly strange." This comes from a guy
who has over 2000 MP3s. Save your
money.
