## Catching up with a band called moe. Ryan Blitstein interviews drummer Vinnie Amico 
### 
Over Thanksgiving weekend, virtuosic
upstate New York rockers moe. slopped in
fora two-day run at the Fillmore in San
Franscisco, then headed south to
Palookaville in Santa Cruz the following
Tuesday.
moe. 's diverse, tough-to-pigeonhole
sound has won the hand thousands of
loyal fans, many of whom travel great dis
tances to see the group in action. Drum
mer Vinnie Amico, the rocker behind the
hand's rhythmically complex songs,
spoke with Intermission last week while on
tour in Tucson, Ariz.
Intermission: Thanks for taking the time
to talk with us. Who were your big influ
ences grttwing up?
Vinnie: Well, there were quite a few, but
starting out on drums, most kids my age
are the same. [Led Zeppelin's] Jon Bon
ham and [Rush's] Neil Peart were the
main influence I had as far as drumming
goes.
1: What about outside of music? Was
there anyone you looked up to?
V: My dad was a pretty big influence as
well. He was a musician though. Because
he was a jazz musician, he's someone I al
ways wanted to impress once I started

doing it myself.
I: Have the influences changed?
V: My influences are constantly chang
ing. If I hear something cool, all of a sud-

den I'm like, "Wow,
that's cool," and 1 lis
ten to it, and it influ
ences the way 1 play.
Over the years the
[Grateful] Dead
drummers influenced
me a lot. Santana and
his different drum
mers as well, his per
cussion players. 1 got
a big influence from
them. A lot of jazz
players — Philly Joe
Jones, Max Roach —
all those guys.
I: At what point did
you move from rock
to jazz as a player

and listener? Or was
it the other way around?
V: My dad was a jazz trumpet player so I
was always brought up listening to jazz.
So it was kind of a change listening to
rock and roll, but then I had these roots in

We do get compared
to the Grateful Dead
and Phish a lot, which
isn't a bad thing, be
cause they're two of
the largest, best tour
ing acts of all time. But
people that say that
are usually just lump
ing us in because
they've never heard
us.

jazz. But 1 never just sat down and lis
tened to Miles Davis or any of that stuff. I
would listen to whatever my dad had on
the stereo, and then he'd take me to gigs.
Here 1 am, this little 6-, 7-year-old kid, in

a bar with a bunch
of 50-year-olds
smoking and
drinking, and I'm
sitting there
watching the
drummer going,
"Holy s—!"
I: Before you
joined the band,
moe. had been
around fora few
years and gone
through quite a
few other drum
mers. What were
they like when you
first saw them?
V: I was doing a

gig in a Dead cover
band called Sonic Garden, and the first
time I saw moe. they opened up for us at
Broadway Joe's in Buffalo. It was a Hal
loween show, and they were all dressed in
costumes and everything. It was a pretty

packed show, and they came out and
rocked the house. I thought, these guys
are f—ing good. I had already known all
the guys before that. John Topper was the
manager, snd he and I lived together.
And Jim, the drummer, was a good friend
of mine. But this was the first time I saw
them play. They used to play with a lot of
hard rock and alternative bands in Buffa
lo that I wasn't all that interested in, so I'd
never go and see them. The first time I got
to see them was when they opened up for
us. I thought, these guys are rocking. 1 was
into it.
I: How did you end up in the band?
V: Topper, the manager, and I are good
friends and had kept in touch throughout
the growth of moe. And every time they'd
lose a drummer, he'd call me. Like after
Jim quit, Topper said, "Jim's quitting.
Would you be interested in playing?"
And I asked, "Well, how much is it gonna
pay?" And he told me, and I said, "No, 1
can't do it." And their third drummer,
Mike, I think his name was, quit. And
Topper called me again and said, "Drum
mer's quitting." And he told me how
much it was gonna pay, and I just couldn't
do it. Then, they signed a deal with Sony,
and they had a drummer, Chris Mazur.


Coppertop, ln(
And Topper called one day and said,
"Things aren't working out with Mazur,
would you be interested in playing?"
He'd always call me and talk about it be
fore the band would even talk about it.
Topper figured that if he could find a
drummer first, they wouldn't have to go
looking for one, and they'd save on the
auditioning and all that stuff. So this time
there was actually a salary and health in
surance involved, and my wife was preg
nant. Long story short, they asked me the
fifth time, and I said "OK."
1: Do you feel like you're finally pretty
solid as a member of the band?
V: Pretty much. I don't think anything in
the music industry is ever solid, but I think
I'm pretty much at that level now.
I: Jim Loughlin has been playing percus
sion and various instruments during the
tour. Is he"in the band" now?
V: Like I said, nothing's permanent, hut
he's been added to the band kind of in
definitely.
I: Does the extra percussionist free you
up?
V: Yeah. In all my years of playing "pro
fessionally," which is basically playing in
bars and making money, I almost always
played with another drummer. 1 feel that
the groove is a lot stronger when there's
another drummer there that knows what
he's doing. It can be a drag when the other
drummer doesn't have good time or
whatever, but otherwise it usually
strengthens up the groove a little bit.
I: Jamming is a huge part of moe. Do you
practice improvisation, or do you only
jam on stage?
V: That's it. When we rehearse, it's basi
cally just writing. We don't really ever go
over old stuff, we just write new stuff in re
hearsals. Then when we play, we just play.
I: A good portion of the songs are credit
ed to all of moe., does everyone help in
the songwriting?
V: Certain tunes, whoever conies in with
a full idea and the song — bam, we put it
out. A lot of times it's just an idea, and we
have to come up with a bunch of jams
around the idea, and that's how the song
comes about, and that's pretty open,
everybody puts in an idea. But the main
ideas are still put in by the original person
who came up with the song.
I: Do you have any favorites of the songs
you guys do?
V: I can't even remember the names of
half the songs that we play. I do like most
of the songs that we do, but I can't really
say I have any favorites.
I: Is there any band that you think that
moe. sounds like or that you're "afraid"
of sounding like, besides obvious influ
ences like the Dead?
V: Not really. We show our influences in

a lot of tunes. Certain tunes sound a little
bit like this, a little bit like that, but I don't
think moe. really sounds like anybody
else. We do get compared to the Grateful
Dead and Phish a lot, which isn't a bad
thing, because they're two of the largest,
best-touring acts of all time. But people
that say that are usually just lumping us in
because they've never heard us. It's an
easy way to generalize what we sound
like, but for the most part, o""*'" people
hear us they don't think that we sound
like Phish or the Dead.
1: Many moe. fans felt that the recent Oc
tober shows in Vermont were a high point
for the band. What did you guys think?
V: Well, it's hard for me to say that it was
a high point because I do this every single
day. If some people had seen those two
shows, and those were the only two shows
of that time they'd seen, or thev saw five

shows in that time
and those were the
best two, they could
say that's a high
point. For me, I've
been on 40 shows in
the last 50 days. 1
might have thought
that a show two and
a half weeks ago
was the best show
we played. But they
were really good
shows, and we did
have [Phish's] Jon
Fishman sit in, and
Jamie Masefield
from Jazz Man-

dolin Project. It's
always a lot of fun when you have other
musicians come and sit in, and a lot of
times they add something to the hand, es
pecially if you see it in the same concoc
tion, the same lineup every day. To have
a couple added players, especially good
players like them, it definitely adds to the
mix.
I: Besides those, can you think of any
shows that you feel are the best moe.
shows since you've been in the band?
V: There probably are a lot of them.
We've done so many; we've been touring
a lot. The Fillmore show [ in San Francis
co, 9/27/97] from a couple years ago, with
Bob [Weir, of the Grateful Dead] —
every time we've played the Fillmore, ac
tually. The Halloween show we just did
was really good, the New Year's Eve
show in Philadelphia last year was good.
A lot of the "bigger" shows turn out real
ly well because of the energy that's in the
room; the overall vibe of it turns it into a
good show. The Vermont shows were
pretty good, as were the shows in D.C. a
couple weeks before that. There's lots of
different things that happen; when you do
what we do where we try to improv and
make every show different, there are dif
ferent points in each show that stick out.
We try to make it different each time.

And nobody could find
Ray when we rere
leased [the album), to
talk to him about how
he's gonna get paid, so
we're looking to find
him so that we can
count him in. We're on
a Quest for Ray.

I: It's interesting that when you listen to
high-pressure shows, like New Year's
shows for instance, from a band like the
Dead, the shows really aren't all that
amazing. It's always the night before,
when the pressure is off, that they perform
really well. With moe., it seems to be the
opposite situation. When the pressure is
on, you make it happen. Do you prepare
for those shows differently than for oth
ers'.'
V: It just kind of happens that way; it's
kind of a vibe thing. We've had shows like
that that don't work either because of the
high pressure, like our families are there
or something else. There's so much going
on around the show that you can't even
concentrate fullv on playing the music.
But the last few times we've gone out to
the big show, we've showed up and
"played the game." I love the big show,

because the vibe is
so much better. I
usually go out there
and start playing
like a friggin' nut
case, start wailing
away.
I: You mentioned
the Fillmore. Are
you doing anything
special for the up
coming shows
there?
V: We're pretty ex
cited about them.
We're actually going
to be recording

them.
I: Fora live album?
V: Fora record release, we're recording a
bunch of shows. We recorded two shows
at the 9:30 Club, and we recorded one the
other night in Austin, Texas. Then two
this week in Boulder, Colo., then the two
in Los Angeles at the House of Blues, and
the two at the Fillmore. Most of the two
day "runs" we're doing, we're trying to
record them and compile a bunch of ma
terial that we can release.
I: What about the studio? Do you have
plans logo back any time soon?
V: We've been compiling some studio
stuff, too. We've gone in a couple times
this year already and gotten some stuff
down, and the week off between the
shows in L.A. and the Fillmore we're
going to be out recording in San Franscis
co that whole week, trying to get a bunch
of other stuff down then. Next summer,
we're going to try and go in and come up
with enough stuff to release a record.
I: Are hit records or MTV goals for the
band, or would you be happy with a loyal
tour following?
V: We were gearing some of this writing
that we just did toward radio, maybe get
ting some songs on the radio, because of

course radio is put out to the masses and
sells records. But it's not as important to
us. I think everybody would like to have a
radio hit, but if it doesn't happen, as long
as we continue to grow our fan base and
continue to go out live, get bigger and big
ger and more successful, that's the main
goal. If we can use radio to do it, that
would be wonderful. If it doesn't work out
that way, but we can continue the growth,
that's fine.
1: Do you feel any different now that
thousands of people have bought your al
bums and come to your shows, or are you
the same guy who used to play in bars?
V: You get a little bit spoiled with some of
the places that you play and some of the
situations. If you go back into a bar, some
times you feel a little bit... you definite
ly feel sort of spoiled with stuff, but it goes
both ways. Sometimes you'd kind of like
to go back to the bar, just to do it, to have
fun and not to be a big show, a big profes
sional thing, like you did in the old days.
But like 1 said, it goes both ways. Usually
the sound systems suck, and you can't
hear anything because you get used to the
bigger shows where you get better equip
ment and things go a little more smooth
ly. It's a little more professional, more like
a show. When you go back into the bar,
it's like, set up your own gear, plug it in
and go; who cares how it sounds?
I: What did you think about the Summer
Sessions lour with Galactic; Government
Mule, Phil l.esh and the String Cheese
Incident? Did you think it was a success?
V: For the most part. It got all of the bands
to be in front of some fans that might not
have seen us otherwise. I'm sure there's
some String Cheese fans that had never
seen us before and some moe. fans that
had never seen Government Mule or
Galactic or whatever. Just a musical mix,
a bunch of good bands out there, a bunch
of great guys all getting together and play
ing. The ones with Phil and Friends —
that was awesome because all of a sudden
we were put in front of B,(XX) people in
stead of just 2,(XX), so everybody got to see
everybody.
I: What is the Quest for Ray Tour?
V: Ray Schwartz was the first drummer in
moe., the one that's on "Fatboy," which
was just rereleased. And nobody could
find Ray when we rereleased it, to talk to
him about how he's gonna get paid, so
we're looking to find him so that we can
count him in. We're on a Quest for Ray.
I: So what are moe. 's future plans?
V: To take over the world!!! Actually, we
just want to continue to do what we do,
keep growing and be successful at what
we do until we're ready to retire.
1: So you think it will last a while?
V: We're hoping it does. So tell every
body to come our shows and buy our
records, and we'll keep doing it.

sional thing, like you did in the old days.
But like 1 said, it goes both ways. Usually
the sound systems suck, and you can't
hear anything because you get used to the
bigger shows where you get better equip
ment and things go a little more smooth
ly. It's a little more professional, more like
a show. When you go back into the bar,
it's like, set up your own gear, plug it in
and go; who cares how it sounds?
I: What did you think about the Summer
Sessions lour with Galactic; Government
Mule, Phil l.esh and the String Cheese
Incident? Did you think it was a success?
V: For the most part. It got all of the bands
to be in front of some fans that might not
have seen us otherwise. I'm sure there's
some String Cheese fans that had never
seen us before and some moe. fans that
had never seen Government Mule or
Galactic or whatever. Just a musical mix,
a bunch of good bands out there, a bunch
of great guys all getting together and play
ing. The ones with Phil and Friends —
that was awesome because all of a sudden
we were put in front of B,(XX) people in
stead of just 2,(XX), so everybody got to see
everybody.
I: What is the Quest for Ray Tour?
V: Ray Schwartz was the first drummer in
moe., the one that's on "Fatboy," which
was just rereleased. And nobody could
find Ray when we rereleased it, to talk to
him about how he's gonna get paid, so
we're looking to find him so that we can
count him in. We're on a Quest for Ray.
I: So what are moe. 's future plans?
V: To take over the world!!! Actually, we
just want to continue to do what we do,
keep growing and be successful at what
we do until we're ready to retire.
1: So you think it will last a while?
V: We're hoping it does. So tell every
body to come our shows and buy our
records, and we'll keep doing it.
Over Thanksgiving weekend, virtuosic
upstate New York rockers moe. slopped in
fora two-day run at the Fillmore in San
Franscisco, then headed south to
Palookaville in Santa Cruz the following
Tuesday.
moe. 's diverse, tough-to-pigeonhole
sound has won the hand thousands of
loyal fans, many of whom travel great dis
tances to see the group in action. Drum
mer Vinnie Amico, the rocker behind the
hand's rhythmically complex songs,
spoke with Intermission last week while on
tour in Tucson, Ariz.
Intermission: Thanks for taking the time
to talk with us. Who were your big influ
ences grttwing up?
Vinnie: Well, there were quite a few, but
starting out on drums, most kids my age
are the same. [Led Zeppelin's] Jon Bon
ham and [Rush's] Neil Peart were the
main influence I had as far as drumming
goes.
1: What about outside of music? Was
there anyone you looked up to?
V: My dad was a pretty big influence as
well. He was a musician though. Because
he was a jazz musician, he's someone I al
ways wanted to impress once I started

doing it myself.
I: Have the influences changed?
V: My influences are constantly chang
ing. If I hear something cool, all of a sud-

den I'm like, "Wow,
that's cool," and 1 lis
ten to it, and it influ
ences the way 1 play.
Over the years the
[Grateful] Dead
drummers influenced
me a lot. Santana and
his different drum
mers as well, his per
cussion players. 1 got
a big influence from
them. A lot of jazz
players — Philly Joe
Jones, Max Roach —
all those guys.
I: At what point did
you move from rock
to jazz as a player

and listener? Or was
it the other way around?
V: My dad was a jazz trumpet player so I
was always brought up listening to jazz.
So it was kind of a change listening to
rock and roll, but then I had these roots in

We do get compared
to the Grateful Dead
and Phish a lot, which
isn't a bad thing, be
cause they're two of
the largest, best tour
ing acts of all time. But
people that say that
are usually just lump
ing us in because
they've never heard
us.

jazz. But 1 never just sat down and lis
tened to Miles Davis or any of that stuff. I
would listen to whatever my dad had on
the stereo, and then he'd take me to gigs.
Here 1 am, this little 6-, 7-year-old kid, in

a bar with a bunch
of 50-year-olds
smoking and
drinking, and I'm
sitting there
watching the
drummer going,
"Holy s—!"
I: Before you
joined the band,
moe. had been
around fora few
years and gone
through quite a
few other drum
mers. What were
they like when you
first saw them?
V: I was doing a

gig in a Dead cover
band called Sonic Garden, and the first
time I saw moe. they opened up for us at
Broadway Joe's in Buffalo. It was a Hal
loween show, and they were all dressed in
costumes and everything. It was a pretty

packed show, and they came out and
rocked the house. I thought, these guys
are f—ing good. I had already known all
the guys before that. John Topper was the
manager, snd he and I lived together.
And Jim, the drummer, was a good friend
of mine. But this was the first time I saw
them play. They used to play with a lot of
hard rock and alternative bands in Buffa
lo that I wasn't all that interested in, so I'd
never go and see them. The first time I got
to see them was when they opened up for
us. I thought, these guys are rocking. 1 was
into it.
I: How did you end up in the band?
V: Topper, the manager, and I are good
friends and had kept in touch throughout
the growth of moe. And every time they'd
lose a drummer, he'd call me. Like after
Jim quit, Topper said, "Jim's quitting.
Would you be interested in playing?"
And I asked, "Well, how much is it gonna
pay?" And he told me, and I said, "No, 1
can't do it." And their third drummer,
Mike, I think his name was, quit. And
Topper called me again and said, "Drum
mer's quitting." And he told me how
much it was gonna pay, and I just couldn't
do it. Then, they signed a deal with Sony,
and they had a drummer, Chris Mazur.


Coppertop, ln(
And Topper called one day and said,
"Things aren't working out with Mazur,
would you be interested in playing?"
He'd always call me and talk about it be
fore the band would even talk about it.
Topper figured that if he could find a
drummer first, they wouldn't have to go
looking for one, and they'd save on the
auditioning and all that stuff. So this time
there was actually a salary and health in
surance involved, and my wife was preg
nant. Long story short, they asked me the
fifth time, and I said "OK."
1: Do you feel like you're finally pretty
solid as a member of the band?
V: Pretty much. I don't think anything in
the music industry is ever solid, but I think
I'm pretty much at that level now.
I: Jim Loughlin has been playing percus
sion and various instruments during the
tour. Is he"in the band" now?
V: Like I said, nothing's permanent, hut
he's been added to the band kind of in
definitely.
I: Does the extra percussionist free you
up?
V: Yeah. In all my years of playing "pro
fessionally," which is basically playing in
bars and making money, I almost always
played with another drummer. 1 feel that
the groove is a lot stronger when there's
another drummer there that knows what
he's doing. It can be a drag when the other
drummer doesn't have good time or
whatever, but otherwise it usually
strengthens up the groove a little bit.
I: Jamming is a huge part of moe. Do you
practice improvisation, or do you only
jam on stage?
V: That's it. When we rehearse, it's basi
cally just writing. We don't really ever go
over old stuff, we just write new stuff in re
hearsals. Then when we play, we just play.
I: A good portion of the songs are credit
ed to all of moe., does everyone help in
the songwriting?
V: Certain tunes, whoever conies in with
a full idea and the song — bam, we put it
out. A lot of times it's just an idea, and we
have to come up with a bunch of jams
around the idea, and that's how the song
comes about, and that's pretty open,
everybody puts in an idea. But the main
ideas are still put in by the original person
who came up with the song.
I: Do you have any favorites of the songs
you guys do?
V: I can't even remember the names of
half the songs that we play. I do like most
of the songs that we do, but I can't really
say I have any favorites.
I: Is there any band that you think that
moe. sounds like or that you're "afraid"
of sounding like, besides obvious influ
ences like the Dead?
V: Not really. We show our influences in

a lot of tunes. Certain tunes sound a little
bit like this, a little bit like that, but I don't
think moe. really sounds like anybody
else. We do get compared to the Grateful
Dead and Phish a lot, which isn't a bad
thing, because they're two of the largest,
best-touring acts of all time. But people
that say that are usually just lumping us in
because they've never heard us. It's an
easy way to generalize what we sound
like, but for the most part, o""*'" people
hear us they don't think that we sound
like Phish or the Dead.
1: Many moe. fans felt that the recent Oc
tober shows in Vermont were a high point
for the band. What did you guys think?
V: Well, it's hard for me to say that it was
a high point because I do this every single
day. If some people had seen those two
shows, and those were the only two shows
of that time they'd seen, or thev saw five

shows in that time
and those were the
best two, they could
say that's a high
point. For me, I've
been on 40 shows in
the last 50 days. 1
might have thought
that a show two and
a half weeks ago
was the best show
we played. But they
were really good
shows, and we did
have [Phish's] Jon
Fishman sit in, and
Jamie Masefield
from Jazz Man-

dolin Project. It's
always a lot of fun when you have other
musicians come and sit in, and a lot of
times they add something to the hand, es
pecially if you see it in the same concoc
tion, the same lineup every day. To have
a couple added players, especially good
players like them, it definitely adds to the
mix.
I: Besides those, can you think of any
shows that you feel are the best moe.
shows since you've been in the band?
V: There probably are a lot of them.
We've done so many; we've been touring
a lot. The Fillmore show [ in San Francis
co, 9/27/97] from a couple years ago, with
Bob [Weir, of the Grateful Dead] —
every time we've played the Fillmore, ac
tually. The Halloween show we just did
was really good, the New Year's Eve
show in Philadelphia last year was good.
A lot of the "bigger" shows turn out real
ly well because of the energy that's in the
room; the overall vibe of it turns it into a
good show. The Vermont shows were
pretty good, as were the shows in D.C. a
couple weeks before that. There's lots of
different things that happen; when you do
what we do where we try to improv and
make every show different, there are dif
ferent points in each show that stick out.
We try to make it different each time.

And nobody could find
Ray when we rere
leased [the album), to
talk to him about how
he's gonna get paid, so
we're looking to find
him so that we can
count him in. We're on
a Quest for Ray.

I: It's interesting that when you listen to
high-pressure shows, like New Year's
shows for instance, from a band like the
Dead, the shows really aren't all that
amazing. It's always the night before,
when the pressure is off, that they perform
really well. With moe., it seems to be the
opposite situation. When the pressure is
on, you make it happen. Do you prepare
for those shows differently than for oth
ers'.'
V: It just kind of happens that way; it's
kind of a vibe thing. We've had shows like
that that don't work either because of the
high pressure, like our families are there
or something else. There's so much going
on around the show that you can't even
concentrate fullv on playing the music.
But the last few times we've gone out to
the big show, we've showed up and
"played the game." I love the big show,

because the vibe is
so much better. I
usually go out there
and start playing
like a friggin' nut
case, start wailing
away.
I: You mentioned
the Fillmore. Are
you doing anything
special for the up
coming shows
there?
V: We're pretty ex
cited about them.
We're actually going
to be recording

them.
I: Fora live album?
V: Fora record release, we're recording a
bunch of shows. We recorded two shows
at the 9:30 Club, and we recorded one the
other night in Austin, Texas. Then two
this week in Boulder, Colo., then the two
in Los Angeles at the House of Blues, and
the two at the Fillmore. Most of the two
day "runs" we're doing, we're trying to
record them and compile a bunch of ma
terial that we can release.
I: What about the studio? Do you have
plans logo back any time soon?
V: We've been compiling some studio
stuff, too. We've gone in a couple times
this year already and gotten some stuff
down, and the week off between the
shows in L.A. and the Fillmore we're
going to be out recording in San Franscis
co that whole week, trying to get a bunch
of other stuff down then. Next summer,
we're going to try and go in and come up
with enough stuff to release a record.
I: Are hit records or MTV goals for the
band, or would you be happy with a loyal
tour following?
V: We were gearing some of this writing
that we just did toward radio, maybe get
ting some songs on the radio, because of

course radio is put out to the masses and
sells records. But it's not as important to
us. I think everybody would like to have a
radio hit, but if it doesn't happen, as long
as we continue to grow our fan base and
continue to go out live, get bigger and big
ger and more successful, that's the main
goal. If we can use radio to do it, that
would be wonderful. If it doesn't work out
that way, but we can continue the growth,
that's fine.
1: Do you feel any different now that
thousands of people have bought your al
bums and come to your shows, or are you
the same guy who used to play in bars?
V: You get a little bit spoiled with some of
the places that you play and some of the
situations. If you go back into a bar, some
times you feel a little bit... you definite
ly feel sort of spoiled with stuff, but it goes
both ways. Sometimes you'd kind of like
to go back to the bar, just to do it, to have
fun and not to be a big show, a big profes
sional thing, like you did in the old days.
But like 1 said, it goes both ways. Usually
the sound systems suck, and you can't
hear anything because you get used to the
bigger shows where you get better equip
ment and things go a little more smooth
ly. It's a little more professional, more like
a show. When you go back into the bar,
it's like, set up your own gear, plug it in
and go; who cares how it sounds?
I: What did you think about the Summer
Sessions lour with Galactic; Government
Mule, Phil l.esh and the String Cheese
Incident? Did you think it was a success?
V: For the most part. It got all of the bands
to be in front of some fans that might not
have seen us otherwise. I'm sure there's
some String Cheese fans that had never
seen us before and some moe. fans that
had never seen Government Mule or
Galactic or whatever. Just a musical mix,

of great guys all getting together and play
ing. The ones with Phil and Friends —
that was awesome because all of a sudden

the two at the Fillmore. Most of the two
day "runs" we're doing, we're trying to
record them and compile a bunch of ma
terial that we can release.
I: What about the studio? Do you have
plans logo back any time soon?
V: We've been compiling some studio
stuff, too. We've gone in a couple times
this year already and gotten some stuff
down, and the week off between the
shows in L.A. and the Fillmore we're
going to be out recording in San Franscis
co that whole week, trying to get a bunch
of other stuff down then. Next summer,
we're going to try and go in and come up
with enough stuff to release a record.
I: Are hit records or MTV goals for the
band, or would you be happy with a loyal
tour following?
V: We were gearing some of this writing
that we just did toward radio, maybe get
ting some songs on the radio, because of

course radio is put out to the masses and
sells records. But it's not as important to
us. I think everybody would like to have a
radio hit, but if it doesn't happen, as long
as we continue to grow our fan base and
continue to go out live, get bigger and big
ger and more successful, that's the main
goal. If we can use radio to do it, that
would be wonderful. If it doesn't work out
that way, but we can continue the growth,
that's fine.
1: Do you feel any different now that
thousands of people have bought your al
bums and come to your shows, or are you
the same guy who used to play in bars?
V: You get a little bit spoiled with some of
the places that you play and some of the
situations. If you go back into a bar, some
times you feel a little bit... you definite
ly feel sort of spoiled with stuff, but it goes
both ways. Sometimes you'd kind of like
to go back to the bar, just to do it, to have
fun and not to be a big show, a big profes
sional thing, like you did in the old days.
But like 1 said, it goes both ways. Usually
the sound systems suck, and you can't
hear anything because you get used to the
bigger shows where you get better equip
ment and things go a little more smooth
ly. It's a little more professional, more like
a show. When you go back into the bar,
it's like, set up your own gear, plug it in
and go; who cares how it sounds?
I: What did you think about the Summer
Sessions lour with Galactic; Government
Mule, Phil l.esh and the String Cheese
Incident? Did you think it was a success?
V: For the most part. It got all of the bands
to be in front of some fans that might not
have seen us otherwise. I'm sure there's
some String Cheese fans that had never
seen us before and some moe. fans that
had never seen Government Mule or
Galactic or whatever. Just a musical mix,
a bunch of good bands out there, a bunch
of great guys all getting together and play
ing. The ones with Phil and Friends —
that was awesome because all of a sudden
we were put in front of B,(XX) people in
stead of just 2,(XX), so everybody got to see
everybody.
I: What is the Quest for Ray Tour?
V: Ray Schwartz was the first drummer in
moe., the one that's on "Fatboy," which
was just rereleased. And nobody could
find Ray when we rereleased it, to talk to
him about how he's gonna get paid, so
we're looking to find him so that we can
count him in. We're on a Quest for Ray.
I: So what are moe. 's future plans?
V: To take over the world!!! Actually, we
just want to continue to do what we do,
keep growing and be successful at what
we do until we're ready to retire.
1: So you think it will last a while?
V: We're hoping it does. So tell every
body to come our shows and buy our
records, and we'll keep doing it.
Over Thanksgiving weekend, virtuosic
upstate New York rockers moe. slopped in
fora two-day run at the Fillmore in San
Franscisco, then headed south to
Palookaville in Santa Cruz the following
Tuesday.
moe. 's diverse, tough-to-pigeonhole
sound has won the hand thousands of
loyal fans, many of whom travel great dis
tances to see the group in action. Drum
mer Vinnie Amico, the rocker behind the
hand's rhythmically complex songs,
spoke with Intermission last week while on
tour in Tucson, Ariz.
Intermission: Thanks for taking the time
to talk with us. Who were your big influ
ences grttwing up?
Vinnie: Well, there were quite a few, but
starting out on drums, most kids my age
are the same. [Led Zeppelin's] Jon Bon
ham and [Rush's] Neil Peart were the
main influence I had as far as drumming
goes.
1: What about outside of music? Was
there anyone you looked up to?
V: My dad was a pretty big influence as
well. He was a musician though. Because
he was a jazz musician, he's someone I al
ways wanted to impress once I started

doing it myself.
I: Have the influences changed?
V: My influences are constantly chang
ing. If I hear something cool, all of a sud-

den I'm like, "Wow,
that's cool," and 1 lis
ten to it, and it influ
ences the way 1 play.
Over the years the
[Grateful] Dead
drummers influenced
me a lot. Santana and
his different drum
mers as well, his per
cussion players. 1 got
a big influence from
them. A lot of jazz
players — Philly Joe
Jones, Max Roach —
all those guys.
I: At what point did
you move from rock
to jazz as a player

and listener? Or was
it the other way around?
V: My dad was a jazz trumpet player so I
was always brought up listening to jazz.
So it was kind of a change listening to
rock and roll, but then I had these roots in

We do get compared
to the Grateful Dead
and Phish a lot, which
isn't a bad thing, be
cause they're two of
the largest, best tour
ing acts of all time. But
people that say that
are usually just lump
ing us in because
they've never heard
us.

jazz. But 1 never just sat down and lis
tened to Miles Davis or any of that stuff. I
would listen to whatever my dad had on
the stereo, and then he'd take me to gigs.
Here 1 am, this little 6-, 7-year-old kid, in

a bar with a bunch
of 50-year-olds
smoking and
drinking, and I'm
sitting there
watching the
drummer going,
"Holy s—!"
I: Before you
joined the band,
moe. had been
around fora few
years and gone
through quite a
few other drum
mers. What were
they like when you
first saw them?
V: I was doing a

gig in a Dead cover
band called Sonic Garden, and the first
time I saw moe. they opened up for us at
Broadway Joe's in Buffalo. It was a Hal
loween show, and they were all dressed in
costumes and everything. It was a pretty

packed show, and they came out and
rocked the house. I thought, these guys
are f—ing good. I had already known all
the guys before that. John Topper was the
manager, snd he and I lived together.
And Jim, the drummer, was a good friend
of mine. But this was the first time I saw
them play. They used to play with a lot of
hard rock and alternative bands in Buffa
lo that I wasn't all that interested in, so I'd
never go and see them. The first time I got
to see them was when they opened up for
us. I thought, these guys are rocking. 1 was
into it.
I: How did you end up in the band?
V: Topper, the manager, and I are good
friends and had kept in touch throughout
the growth of moe. And every time they'd
lose a drummer, he'd call me. Like after
Jim quit, Topper said, "Jim's quitting.
Would you be interested in playing?"
And I asked, "Well, how much is it gonna
pay?" And he told me, and I said, "No, 1
can't do it." And their third drummer,
Mike, I think his name was, quit. And
Topper called me again and said, "Drum
mer's quitting." And he told me how
much it was gonna pay, and I just couldn't
do it. Then, they signed a deal with Sony,
and they had a drummer, Chris Mazur.


Coppertop, ln(
And Topper called one day and said,
"Things aren't working out with Mazur,
would you be interested in playing?"
He'd always call me and talk about it be
fore the band would even talk about it.
Topper figured that if he could find a
drummer first, they wouldn't have to go
looking for one, and they'd save on the
auditioning and all that stuff. So this time
there was actually a salary and health in
surance involved, and my wife was preg
nant. Long story short, they asked me the
fifth time, and I said "OK."
1: Do you feel like you're finally pretty
solid as a member of the band?
V: Pretty much. I don't think anything in
the music industry is ever solid, but I think
I'm pretty much at that level now.
I: Jim Loughlin has been playing percus
sion and various instruments during the
tour. Is he"in the band" now?
V: Like I said, nothing's permanent, hut
he's been added to the band kind of in
definitely.
I: Does the extra percussionist free you
up?
V: Yeah. In all my years of playing "pro
fessionally," which is basically playing in
bars and making money, I almost always
played with another drummer. 1 feel that
the groove is a lot stronger when there's
another drummer there that knows what
he's doing. It can be a drag when the other
drummer doesn't have good time or
whatever, but otherwise it usually
strengthens up the groove a little bit.
I: Jamming is a huge part of moe. Do you
practice improvisation, or do you only
jam on stage?
V: That's it. When we rehearse, it's basi
cally just writing. We don't really ever go
over old stuff, we just write new stuff in re
hearsals. Then when we play, we just play.
I: A good portion of the songs are credit
ed to all of moe., does everyone help in
the songwriting?
V: Certain tunes, whoever conies in with
a full idea and the song — bam, we put it
out. A lot of times it's just an idea, and we
have to come up with a bunch of jams
around the idea, and that's how the song
comes about, and that's pretty open,
everybody puts in an idea. But the main
ideas are still put in by the original person
who came up with the song.
I: Do you have any favorites of the songs
you guys do?
V: I can't even remember the names of
half the songs that we play. I do like most
of the songs that we do, but I can't really
say I have any favorites.
I: Is there any band that you think that
moe. sounds like or that you're "afraid"
of sounding like, besides obvious influ
ences like the Dead?
V: Not really. We show our influences in

a lot of tunes. Certain tunes sound a little
bit like this, a little bit like that, but I don't
think moe. really sounds like anybody
else. We do get compared to the Grateful
Dead and Phish a lot, which isn't a bad
thing, because they're two of the largest,
best-touring acts of all time. But people
that say that are usually just lumping us in
because they've never heard us. It's an
easy way to generalize what we sound
like, but for the most part, o""*'" people
hear us they don't think that we sound
like Phish or the Dead.
1: Many moe. fans felt that the recent Oc
tober shows in Vermont were a high point
for the band. What did you guys think?
V: Well, it's hard for me to say that it was
a high point because I do this every single
day. If some people had seen those two
shows, and those were the only two shows
of that time they'd seen, or thev saw five

shows in that time
and those were the
best two, they could
say that's a high
point. For me, I've
been on 40 shows in
the last 50 days. 1
might have thought
that a show two and
a half weeks ago
was the best show
we played. But they
were really good
shows, and we did
have [Phish's] Jon
Fishman sit in, and
Jamie Masefield
from Jazz Man-

dolin Project. It's
always a lot of fun when you have other
musicians come and sit in, and a lot of
times they add something to the hand, es
pecially if you see it in the same concoc
tion, the same lineup every day. To have
a couple added players, especially good
players like them, it definitely adds to the
mix.
I: Besides those, can you think of any
shows that you feel are the best moe.
shows since you've been in the band?
V: There probably are a lot of them.
We've done so many; we've been touring
a lot. The Fillmore show [ in San Francis
co, 9/27/97] from a couple years ago, with
Bob [Weir, of the Grateful Dead] —
every time we've played the Fillmore, ac
tually. The Halloween show we just did
was really good, the New Year's Eve
show in Philadelphia last year was good.
A lot of the "bigger" shows turn out real
ly well because of the energy that's in the
room; the overall vibe of it turns it into a
good show. The Vermont shows were
pretty good, as were the shows in D.C. a
couple weeks before that. There's lots of
different things that happen; when you do
what we do where we try to improv and
make every show different, there are dif
ferent points in each show that stick out.
We try to make it different each time.

And nobody could find
Ray when we rere
leased [the album), to
talk to him about how
he's gonna get paid, so
we're looking to find
him so that we can
count him in. We're on
a Quest for Ray.

I: It's interesting that when you listen to
high-pressure shows, like New Year's
shows for instance, from a band like the
Dead, the shows really aren't all that
amazing. It's always the night before,
when the pressure is off, that they perform
really well. With moe., it seems to be the
opposite situation. When the pressure is
on, you make it happen. Do you prepare
for those shows differently than for oth
ers'.'
V: It just kind of happens that way; it's
kind of a vibe thing. We've had shows like
that that don't work either because of the
high pressure, like our families are there
or something else. There's so much going
on around the show that you can't even
concentrate fullv on playing the music.
But the last few times we've gone out to
the big show, we've showed up and
"played the game." I love the big show,

because the vibe is
so much better. I
usually go out there
and start playing
like a friggin' nut
case, start wailing
away.
I: You mentioned
the Fillmore. Are
you doing anything
special for the up
coming shows
there?
V: We're pretty ex
cited about them.
We're actually going
to be recording

them.
I: Fora live album?
V: Fora record release, we're recording a
bunch of shows. We recorded two shows
at the 9:30 Club, and we recorded one the
other night in Austin, Texas. Then two
this week in Boulder, Colo., then the two
in Los Angeles at the House of Blues, and
the two at the Fillmore. Most of the two
day "runs" we're doing, we're trying to
record them and compile a bunch of ma
terial that we can release.
I: What about the studio? Do you have
plans logo back any time soon?

I: Are hit records or MTV goals for the
band, or would you be happy with a loyal
tour following?
V: We were gearing some of this writing
that we just did toward radio, maybe get
ting some songs on the radio, because of

course radio is put out to the masses and
sells records. But it's not as important to
us. I think everybody would like to have a

ferent points in each show that stick out.
We try to make it different each time.

And nobody could find
Ray when we rere
leased [the album), to
talk to him about how
he's gonna get paid, so
we're looking to find
him so that we can
count him in. We're on
a Quest for Ray.

I: It's interesting that when you listen to
high-pressure shows, like New Year's
shows for instance, from a band like the
Dead, the shows really aren't all that
amazing. It's always the night before,
when the pressure is off, that they perform
really well. With moe., it seems to be the
opposite situation. When the pressure is
on, you make it happen. Do you prepare
for those shows differently than for oth
ers'.'
V: It just kind of happens that way; it's
kind of a vibe thing. We've had shows like
that that don't work either because of the
high pressure, like our families are there
or something else. There's so much going
on around the show that you can't even
concentrate fullv on playing the music.
But the last few times we've gone out to
the big show, we've showed up and
"played the game." I love the big show,

because the vibe is
so much better. I
usually go out there
and start playing
like a friggin' nut
case, start wailing
away.
I: You mentioned
the Fillmore. Are
you doing anything
special for the up
coming shows
there?
V: We're pretty ex
cited about them.
We're actually going
to be recording

them.
I: Fora live album?
V: Fora record release, we're recording a
bunch of shows. We recorded two shows
at the 9:30 Club, and we recorded one the
other night in Austin, Texas. Then two
this week in Boulder, Colo., then the two
in Los Angeles at the House of Blues, and
the two at the Fillmore. Most of the two
day "runs" we're doing, we're trying to
record them and compile a bunch of ma
terial that we can release.
I: What about the studio? Do you have
plans logo back any time soon?
V: We've been compiling some studio
stuff, too. We've gone in a couple times
this year already and gotten some stuff
down, and the week off between the
shows in L.A. and the Fillmore we're
going to be out recording in San Franscis
co that whole week, trying to get a bunch
of other stuff down then. Next summer,
we're going to try and go in and come up
with enough stuff to release a record.
I: Are hit records or MTV goals for the
band, or would you be happy with a loyal
tour following?
V: We were gearing some of this writing
that we just did toward radio, maybe get
ting some songs on the radio, because of

course radio is put out to the masses and
sells records. But it's not as important to
us. I think everybody would like to have a
radio hit, but if it doesn't happen, as long
as we continue to grow our fan base and
continue to go out live, get bigger and big
ger and more successful, that's the main
goal. If we can use radio to do it, that
would be wonderful. If it doesn't work out
that way, but we can continue the growth,
that's fine.
1: Do you feel any different now that
thousands of people have bought your al
bums and come to your shows, or are you
the same guy who used to play in bars?
V: You get a little bit spoiled with some of
the places that you play and some of the
situations. If you go back into a bar, some
times you feel a little bit... you definite
ly feel sort of spoiled with stuff, but it goes
both ways. Sometimes you'd kind of like
to go back to the bar, just to do it, to have
fun and not to be a big show, a big profes
sional thing, like you did in the old days.
But like 1 said, it goes both ways. Usually
the sound systems suck, and you can't
hear anything because you get used to the
bigger shows where you get better equip
ment and things go a little more smooth
ly. It's a little more professional, more like
a show. When you go back into the bar,
it's like, set up your own gear, plug it in
and go; who cares how it sounds?
I: What did you think about the Summer
Sessions lour with Galactic; Government
Mule, Phil l.esh and the String Cheese
Incident? Did you think it was a success?
V: For the most part. It got all of the bands
to be in front of some fans that might not
have seen us otherwise. I'm sure there's
some String Cheese fans that had never
seen us before and some moe. fans that
had never seen Government Mule or
Galactic or whatever. Just a musical mix,
a bunch of good bands out there, a bunch
of great guys all getting together and play
ing. The ones with Phil and Friends —
that was awesome because all of a sudden
we were put in front of B,(XX) people in
stead of just 2,(XX), so everybody got to see
everybody.
I: What is the Quest for Ray Tour?
V: Ray Schwartz was the first drummer in
moe., the one that's on "Fatboy," which
was just rereleased. And nobody could
find Ray when we rereleased it, to talk to
him about how he's gonna get paid, so
we're looking to find him so that we can
count him in. We're on a Quest for Ray.
I: So what are moe. 's future plans?
V: To take over the world!!! Actually, we
just want to continue to do what we do,
keep growing and be successful at what
we do until we're ready to retire.
1: So you think it will last a while?
V: We're hoping it does. So tell every
body to come our shows and buy our
records, and we'll keep doing it.
