Over Thanksgiving weekend, virtuosic
upstate New York rockers moe. slopped in
fora two-day run at the Fillmore in San
Franscisco, then headed south to
Palookaville in Santa Cruz the following
Tuesday.
moe. 's diverse, tough-to-pigeonhole
sound has won the hand thousands of
loyal fans, many of whom travel great dis
tances to see the group in action. Drum
mer Vinnie Amico, the rocker behind the
hand's rhythmically complex songs,
spoke with Intermission last week while on
tour in Tucson, Ariz.
Intermission: Thanks for taking the time
to talk with us. Who were your big influ
ences grttwing up?
Vinnie: Well, there were quite a few, but
starting out on drums, most kids my age
are the same. [Led Zeppelin's] Jon Bon
ham and [Rush's] Neil Peart were the
main influence I had as far as drumming
goes.
1: What about outside of music? Was
there anyone you looked up to?
V: My dad was a pretty big influence as
well. He was a musician though. Because
he was a jazz musician, he's someone I al
ways wanted to impress once I started

doing it myself.
I: Have the influences changed?
V: My influences are constantly chang
ing. If I hear something cool, all of a sud-

den I'm like, "Wow,
that's cool," and 1 lis
ten to it, and it influ
ences the way 1 play.
Over the years the
[Grateful] Dead
drummers influenced
me a lot. Santana and
his different drum
mers as well, his per
cussion players. 1 got
a big influence from
them. A lot of jazz
players — Philly Joe
Jones, Max Roach —
all those guys.
I: At what point did
you move from rock
to jazz as a player

and listener? Or was
it the other way around?
V: My dad was a jazz trumpet player so I
was always brought up listening to jazz.
So it was kind of a change listening to
rock and roll, but then I had these roots in

We do get compared
to the Grateful Dead
and Phish a lot, which
isn't a bad thing, be
cause they're two of
the largest, best tour
ing acts of all time. But
people that say that
are usually just lump
ing us in because
they've never heard
us.

jazz. But 1 never just sat down and lis
tened to Miles Davis or any of that stuff. I
would listen to whatever my dad had on
the stereo, and then he'd take me to gigs.
Here 1 am, this little 6-, 7-year-old kid, in

a bar with a bunch
of 50-year-olds
smoking and
drinking, and I'm
sitting there
watching the
drummer going,
"Holy s—!"
I: Before you
joined the band,
moe. had been
around fora few
years and gone
through quite a
few other drum
mers. What were
they like when you
first saw them?
V: I was doing a

gig in a Dead cover
band called Sonic Garden, and the first
time I saw moe. they opened up for us at
Broadway Joe's in Buffalo. It was a Hal
loween show, and they were all dressed in
costumes and everything. It was a pretty

packed show, and they came out and
rocked the house. I thought, these guys
are f—ing good. I had already known all
the guys before that. John Topper was the
manager, snd he and I lived together.
And Jim, the drummer, was a good friend
of mine. But this was the first time I saw
them play. They used to play with a lot of
hard rock and alternative bands in Buffa
lo that I wasn't all that interested in, so I'd
never go and see them. The first time I got
to see them was when they opened up for
us. I thought, these guys are rocking. 1 was
into it.
I: How did you end up in the band?
V: Topper, the manager, and I are good
friends and had kept in touch throughout
the growth of moe. And every time they'd
lose a drummer, he'd call me. Like after
Jim quit, Topper said, "Jim's quitting.
Would you be interested in playing?"
And I asked, "Well, how much is it gonna
pay?" And he told me, and I said, "No, 1
can't do it." And their third drummer,
Mike, I think his name was, quit. And
Topper called me again and said, "Drum
mer's quitting." And he told me how
much it was gonna pay, and I just couldn't
do it. Then, they signed a deal with Sony,
and they had a drummer, Chris Mazur.
