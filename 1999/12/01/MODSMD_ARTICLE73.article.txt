## Another formulaic, yet satisfying, Bond adventure 
### 
There's something wonderful about the for
mulaic nature of James Bond films. While
they can be somewhat predictable (you
know that somewhere in the film he'll respond to
"Who are you?" with "Bond ... James Bond"),

The World Is Not Enough
Pierce Brosnan
Robert Carlyle
128 minutes
Kated PG-13

you can always ex
pect a winning com
bination of action,
sexiness and light
humor.
Bond's latest
adventure, "The
World Is Not
Enough," takes a

few too many liberties (such as a title that has
nothing to do with the plot), but overall it proves
to he an entertaining film worthy of the (X) 7 saga.
"T.W.1.N.E." has a fresh opening scene; rather

than making his now-standard dive from a plane or an es
cape from the Russians, Bond (Pierce Brosnan) finds the
action a little closer to home when a spy terrorizes the
MI-6 London headquarters. After a great boat chase
down the River Thames, Bond falls from a hot-air bal
loon and injures his shoulder.
As Bond nurses his wounds, he is briefed on a villain
who seems physically invincible. Renard (Robert Car
lyle), who sustained a gunshot wound to the head, can no
longer feel pain, and this ticking time-bomb of a man is

threatening the beautiful oil tycoon Elektra King (So
phie Marceau). Bond has to protect Elektra and prevent
Renard from using a stolen nuclear weapon.
Thanks to an experienced Brosnan and a sharp writ
ing crew, there arc some new facets to the standard
Agent (X) 7 material. Bond has an uncharacteristic physi
cal weakness (his shoulder) that haunts him throughout
the movie. When he goes to a casino and orders a vodka
martini — "shaken, not stirred" — he's not just there to
look good in a tuxedo; he starts a fistfight as his drink is

poured to show he means business. He even starts
telling women that he's been using them, which
gives him some moral depth.
Many of the action sequences in "T.W.1.N.E."
are instant classics, including the boat chase, a ski
chase, an underground explosion and a high-speed
ride through an oil pipe.
However, the movie gets a little sluggish be
tween these scenes as it tries to do a Bond no-no:
develop a complicated plot with tragic characters.
1 guess it was hard to build a perfect chemistry be
tween director Michael Apted (the man behind
the brilliant "Up" documentary series), the writers
and the actors.
1 wasn't terribly impressed with the placement
of the new characters, either. Renard doesn't live
up to his potential as an "invincible" villain, and
he's not very intimidating once you realize that
he's shorter than his girlfriend. And Denise

Richards as nuclear scientist Dr. Christmas Jones — let's
just say there's one too many one-liners about her
name — simply can't be taken seriously when she's
wearing those skimply outfits.
in any case, between "T.W.1.N.E." and the Arnold
Schwarzegger flick "End of Days," you should definitely
be able to get your action movie fix for the holidays.
