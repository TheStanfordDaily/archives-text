# Whimsical 'Toy Story' sequel is pure perfection

### 
I know what you're thinking: "A perfect score fora se
quel?" I didn't expect it to happen either, so just hear
me out.
" Toy Story 2" is an awesome movie and a wonderful
experience. Just try — I dare you — try to avoid walking
out of the theater with a humongous smile.
The writing is tremendous. The artwork is fantastic.
The technical work is great. And it even ends with

Okay, but what
about the story? Well, we
are reintroduced to a cast
of toys — including
Andy's favorites, cowboy
Woody (voiced by Tom

Hanks) and space cadet Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) —
who come to life when their owners are out of sight.
While trying to save an abandoned toy from being
sold in a yard sale, Woody is spotted by a toy collector
who proceeds to steal him. Woody is then introduced to
a new world, circa 1957. in which he and three other toys
are the stars of a popular children's Western adventure
show, "Woody's Roundup."
Woody and the other toys — Cowgirl Jessie (Joan
Cusack, the"In & Out" bride), prospector Stinky Pete
(Kelsey Grammer, "Frasicr" and"The Simpsons") and
Woody's trusty horse Bullseye (David Ogden Stiers,
"Beauty and the Beast" narrator) — begin to grow clos
er under these difficult circumstances.
The collector holding them captive plans to sell this
scarce "Woody's Roundup" set to a Japanese museum
fora high sum of money, thus ending their lives in stor
age. Woody is torn by his love for his old life and the

fondness for his new friends
and possible immortality, al
beit under glass.
In the meantime, Andy's
other toys have sent out a
search-and-rescue team to
liberate Woody. Unprepared
fora world of expressways,
skyscrapers and Barbie dolls,
these toys plug on with hilari
ous results. Those who recall
"Toy Story" will have some
idea of the bent but not nec
essarily the magnitude of fun
which follows.
And this all sounds great..
. for kids. But The Daily isn't
oriented toward a younger
audience, so I should empha-

size that older kids and adults
will get more out of it than the tykes. References to "Star
Wars," the first "Toy Story," Sputnik and pop culture in
general are sprinkled throughout the film.
The rich world of "Toy Story 2" is colored by excel
lent computer animation and voice talent. The original
"Toy Story" was the first feature-length computer-ani
mated film. In the four years that have passed, techno
logical advancements have allowed a greater variety of
actions and detail, with better quality than ever.
The same goes for the talented cast. In addition to the
Oscar-winning Hanks, Allen, Cusack and Grammer,
there is a stellar showcase of world-class character actors,
such as comedy veteran Don Kickles (Mr. Potato Head),
"Ernest" star Jim Varney (Slinky Dog), "The Princess
Bride" actor Wallace Shawn (Rex), "Cheers" survivor

John Ratzenberger (Hamm) and Newman-from-"Sein
feld" Wayne Knight (the inept villain).
Randy Newman returns with realistic '50s theme
music to " Woody's Roundup" and Jessie's bittersweet
reminiscence, "When She Loved Me," performed by
Sarah McLachlan. The former adds to the fun, while the
latter adds to the story of love lost. Yes, this story even
has a lesson about love, appropriate for all ages.
The 10 directors, producers and writers of "Toy Story
2" never allow the movie to be anything less than excel
lent. If this is the sequel, I can't wait fora third film. In the
meantime, "Toy Story 2" is an experience which should
not be missed by kids of any age.
