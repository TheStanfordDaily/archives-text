The
tale begins
in a forgot
ten village
of Japan's
past, where
children

are trained as warriors and tradition is the
only law. The opening scene develops in a
flurry of panic: the young Prince Ashitaka
(voiced by Billy Crudup) is valiantly
fighting off a Demon God — a giant boar
possessed by worm-like creatures.
Ashitaka slays the beast, but not be
fore it leaves its curse on the heroic
prince's forearm and infects him with a
fatal disease. The village seer warns that
he must leave his clan forever and venture
to the West to have the malediction lifted.
His magical and violent quest features
encounters with bloodthirsty samurai, a
corrupt priest and docile forest gnomes.
Eventually, the prince arrives at the great
forest and is befriended by Lady Eboshi

(Minnie Driver), who operates a giant
ironworks with the help of social misfits
— lepers, prostitutes — under her guid
ance.
Ashitaka finds himself thrust into a
struggle between the factory and the for
est families of boars, wolves and the like,
who are being killed off in the name of in
dustrial expansion. For generations, these
creatures have lived in the harmony and
sanctuary of the Deer God. With her ig
norant troop of men. Lady Eboshi has
been able to subvert the laws of nature

with her one special weapon: gunpowder.
Allegiances are further clouded by the
arrival of Princess Mononoke, or San
(Claire Danes). She not only runs with the
wolves, but she also considers herself one
of them. San doesn't know what to make
of the young Ashitaka, though he finds
her beautiful.
And thus the legend of "Princess
Mononoke" unfolds. Up until a casual de
capitation about 20 minutes into the
movie, 1 was completely engrossed. The
entire production is excellent, unparal

leled by any of Disney's animated movies
(the closest thing to Japanese anime,
though to seriously compare the two is an
injustice to both genres).
However, I have realized Miyazaki's
masterpiece is not without its flaws. First,
I felt there are too many open questions
left at the end of the movie. What of
Ashitaka's old life and clan? Is he so res
olute in his sense of duty that he refuses to

think about them?
Also, Lady Eboshi is supposedly the
only intelligent human, leading an igno
rant troop of outcasts against a forest of
Gods and Demons. From where does her
power accrue? How is it she is even able to
battle the Gods and Demons?
I was disappointed I did not know the
future of this world I had grown to love.
Perhaps this is Miyazaki's intent, as a tes
tament to the fact that this struggle be
tween man and nature continues today.
Despite these concerns, I still say that
this movie is refreshingly novel. "Princess
Mononoke" is an excellent film from
Japan's most acclaimed animator.
