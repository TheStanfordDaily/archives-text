# The 						power of 'Pokèmon' mania triumphs again
## 
### 
It is difficult to separate
"Pokemon: The First
Movie" from the general
Pokemon mania that has invad
ed American kid culture in the
past two years.
Pokemon — Japanese-creat
ed "pocket monster" characters
— have also become important
symbols in business and family
cultures. The most popular
Pokemon, Pikachu, can be
glimpsed gracing the pages of
"The New Yorker" (he got a
cover) and "Business Week."
And according to his hard
core marketers, Pikachu and his
precious friends are here to stay.
The "New York Times" review
begins with a vision of the future
in which all subjects are ex-

plained with reference to Pokemon. In other words,
Pokemon is an important cultural phenomenon, and un-

less you work or live with
kids, you're missing out.
That's why I decid
ed to review "Pokemon."
It was time to embrace my
inner Pokemon (in the
movie, the trainers' Poke
mon seem to reflect their
own personalities) and try

to understand what has kids so excited, teachers so frus
trated and parents so broke. What I found: a world of re
ally cute characters, games that encourage community, a
mixed bag of anti-violence messages, anthropocentric
ideology, fierce competition and an incredibly shrewd
(though embarrassingly forthright) marketing plan.
When I bought my ticket at the theater, I instantly be
came a Pokemon trainer. I received my first Pokemon
card (it was Mewtwo, the genetically engineered Poke

mon). Of course it's a gimmick — there are four cards
you can only get at the movies or by shopping at a Warn
er Brothers store.
I sat through a painful series of previews and an even
more painful preview of the Pokemon soundtrack (Vita
min C is one of the featured artists).
Then it was time for "Pikachu's Vacation," the car
toon short attached to the feature. There is very little lin
ear narrative in the short; its purpose is to show us as
many cute Pokemon as possible in 20 minutes. (There
are 151 types of Pokemon. Or there were until the movie.
Now there are 154.) "Pikachu's Vacation" gives us a
glimpse of how Pokemon interact when there are no
human trainers around to force them to fight. "Pokemon
prefer cooperation to confrontation,'' a computer ani
mated voice tells us. Of course they do.
The human trainers return at the end of "Pikachu's
Vacation," and they get to control most of the Pokemon
throughout the movie. In fact, the central problem of the
movie involves a powerful Pokemon named Mewtwo

who doesn't want to be trained.
Mewtwo was genetically engi
neered from the DNA of Mew,
an especially cute, rare and pow
erful Pokemon. Mewtwo sounds
suspiciously like Brain from
"Pinky and the Brain" and even
wants to take over the world with
a genetically engineered batch of
super-Pokemon.
But to do that, he has to at
tract all of the world's best train
ers. He schedules a mysterious
tournament at his island villa,
and the trainers arrive to make
their Pokemon fight each other.
Pokemon don't fight to the death
— they just knock each other un
conscious. The censors consider
that less violent.
1 fell asleep during the battle

scene, which features the original Pokemon fighting their
genetically engineered doubles. They push against each
other for about 10 minutes while Mew and Mewtwo fly
around the room in glowing bubbles.
There are many social critiques that could'be made
about Pokemon. The game is about subjugation — the
trainers have absolute power over their Pokemon,
though they think of them as "friends." Kids play the
game in communities, but the community itself is based
on fighting. Pokemon evolve, and the movie deals with a
hot cultural topic: genetic engineering.
But (a) no one cares, as long as the kids and Nintendo
are happy, and (b) all of these issues can be introduced
without seeing "Pokemon." If you're interested in the
Pokfcmon phenomenon, visit a Web site — there are
hundreds of them, many pro-Pokemon and at least a few
anti-Pokemon. The only reason to see this movie is if
you've got five 8-year-olds in tow.
