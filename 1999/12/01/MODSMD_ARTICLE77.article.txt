endless plot twists. Taking place in real
time, the 103-minute film presents plenty
of nonstop action and fast-paced excite
ment. '

The premise of the movie is simple.
Shy housewife Miyako (Kyoka Suzuki)
has written a drama which won a contest
at a local radio station. The drama is to be
broadcast live at midnight, which is in 15
minutes. Without warning, the leading
lady in the story decides that she doesn't
like her character name, Ritsuko, and de
mands that it be changed to Mary Jane.
The director, forever trying to keep
everyone happy, feels forced to oblige
her.
When the other actors hear of this,
they each demand to have their names
changed also. One thing leads to another,
and soon the sentimental drama about a
small town Japanese fisherman's wife

metamorphosizes into a story of a high
profile lawyer in Chicago.
Moreover, the farther the story goes,
the more outrageous it becomes as the
staff scrambles to keep the rapidly chang
ing details consistent with the evolving
plot. For every problem that is resolved,
three more spring up.
By the end, everyone has realized that
the drama is out of control. But with a lit
tle creativity and rebellion, they manage
to find a resolution. Although this drama
may not have been the mythical "show we
can be completely satisfied with," it ends
up being good enough to keep everyone
happy.
In fact, one listener is so moved that he

feels the need to stop by the station just to
shake the hand of the person responsible
for the drama. Soon enough, plans for the
sequel are being discussed.
"Mr. McDonald" is a breath of fresh
air. In an era where filmmakers are striv
ing for the biggest and best special effects,
the simplicity of "Mr. McDonald" re
minds the viewer what a good film should
be. Rather than hiding behind huge ex
plosions, "Mr. McDonald" thrives on
quality writing and brings to the forefront
the natural humor that comes from peo
ple trying to make the best of a difficult
situation.
