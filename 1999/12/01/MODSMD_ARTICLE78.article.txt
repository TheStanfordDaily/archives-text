# An intense look at 'Boys' and girls in Nebraska
## 
### 
£ m oys Don't Cry," currently playing at the Los
r - £ Gatos Cinema, is a gripping and often insight
ful look into the beauty and horror of human
ity. It is certainly not a movie for all tastes — or even for
most.
In trouble with the law and unhappy with her life, a
young woman from Lincoln, Neb., Teena Brandon (Hi-

Boys Don'/ Cry
Hilary Swank
Chloe Sevigny
116 minutes
Rated R
Now playing in select cities

lary Swank, "The Next
Karate Kid"), tries to pass
off as Brandon Teena, a
young man on the road.
Macho but physically
weak, Brandon first
charms a girl, and when
others find out her identi
ty, she escapes them and

the law, winding up in Falls City, Neb.
All throughout Teena's life, she has only been places
where one could only be normal or a "fag," and what
Brandon really wants to be is a young man. With a bit
more experience (and a sock) under his belt, he confi
dently befriends members of a patchwork family. These
people are what we would probably call "white trash," as
in people stuck in a hick town.
One of these people is Lana (Chloe Sevigny, "Kids"),
who has developed a hard shell to protect her from the
inanity and insanity of her small town life. Her friends

and family protect her, but not from their own reckless
ness. They love her, but not enough to allow her any in
dependence.
Ex-con John (Peter Sarsgaard, "Dead Man Walk
ing") is perhaps the most dangerous of the group. Rough
and rowdy, John more than once puts himself and others
in serious danger.
Brandon falls hard for Lana the moment he lays eyes
on her. Lana soon falls for Brandon too, as he is probably
the first person to show her any real passion or tender
ness. In the world they have together, everything seems
ecstatic, but Lana's friends resent the disruption in their
family structure and are horrified when they find out the
magnitude of this disruption.
The undercurrent of the entire film is dark and fore
boding, although nothing could prepare a viewer for
what occurs after Brandon's secret is exposed. "Boys
Don't Cry" presents us with the absolute best and worst
in ourselves: jealousy, bravery, rage and love.
Brandon is not moral; he deceives those he cares
about to fit into the role he wants and breaks laws to get
things he wants. However, he is ultimately a beautiful
person — he is trying to be what is in his nature as best he
can, and he authentically cares about Lana, even to the
point of risking his life and well-being to make sure she is
all right.
And although other members of the group — even

Lana's own mother — do horrifying things once they
find out that Lana's been "tainted," they do try to form a
family that nurtures happiness and protects those inside
it.
The acting, camerawork and story are all wonderfully
done. Every scene seems real. One can physically see
Lana's transformation from cynical trailer trash to a ra
diant woman in love. The fright Brandon feels whenever
it seems he might be found out is real, from the look on
his face to the poise of his body. And of course for the
movie to work at all Swank has to spend most of it being
a man in addition to being a believable character in gen
eral.
Based on a real-life tragedy, "Boys Don't Cry" shows
that honesty and goodness are not the same thing, and in
this society, some people have to be dishonest in order to
be true to themselves and to survive. Not everyone is as
good or bad as they first appear, and things aren't usual
ly black and white.
I'd recommend this movie by first-time director Kim
berly Peirce, but be sure you know what you're getting
into. People like to be scared and see tragic love, but only
when they know there's a certain distance. This may be a
wonderful and thought-provoking movie, but it's proba
bly too realistic for most people.
