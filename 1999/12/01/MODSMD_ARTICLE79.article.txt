order to star and help produce his life-long dream of a
movie: a horror flick named "Coven."
Mark is the movie. His dedication to movie-mak
ing despite all the hindrances keeps "American
Movie" going in the beginning. Pure sadistic interest
keeps the viewer enthralled as Mark's dirty underwear
is aired to the world.
Mark is the quintessential American Guy. Just like
the rest of us, he has problems with money, relation-

ships and parents. Bui his dedication sets him apart, as nothing will keep him from re
alizing his dreams of making a feature-length independent film.
His engaging and forceful nature is humorous at times, but the real laughs come
from his sidekicks Mike Schank and uncle Bill Borchardt. Mike is comically brain
dead, blessed with a mellow and drawn-out laugh that is enough to bring the audience
to chuckling by itself. Mike's simplistic view of the world serves to dampen Mark's de
pression at times in the movie, just as a sidekick should.
Mike tells the story of how Mark and he became friends: "We were downstairs in my
house partying one time, and I wanted to party hard, but no one wanted to drink this
bottle of vodka with me until Mark said he would. Then we would always go out and
get a fifth of vodka — we were always drinking vodka — and that made me happy."
Uncle Bill is the financial backer for Mark's "Coven," lavishing in the attention
Mark pays him, all the while cynical of Mark's chances of paying him back. His mum
bling pieces of wisdom are periodically hilarious, and his part in "Coven" had me
rolling. His interactions with Mark also show Mark's tender side, as Mark serves as an
honorary nurse for the aging family member.
The clips taken from Mark's filmography are also quite funny. His inauspicious
debut was as a 14-year-old drinking vodka with Mike in the cemetery before their
slaughter in"The More the Scarier." Combined with some clips from the sequels, these
out-takes are nearly enough to make me want to see "American Movie" again.

Notable are the men-behind-the-men-behind-the-scenes: director Chris Smith pulls
off the mockumentary style without a hitch, while the rest (including co-producer
Michael Stipe) play their roles well enough to disappear into the credits.
There is more to the movie than laughs and the ever-present beer. Mark constantly
questions himself while his efforts are constantly being sabotaged, and in a powerful
scene, he declares, drunk, that he will never "work a f— ing nine-to-five" and that he
will never be the American factory worker.
And really, that is what is American about "American Movie:" the refusal to be cat
egorized, the constant re-evaluation of values and the determination to succeed not
only for the "nice house and cars" but also for one's own sense of pride. Go see this at
the Aquarius and other select theatres nationwide.
