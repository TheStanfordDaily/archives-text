£ r I lrain of Life" is a fable set in a
Holocaust-period Jewish vil-
JL lage. It is not, however, strictly
a tear-jerkfng drama. It is instead a com
edy flavored with slapstick and a "sur
*prise" dramatic ending.

Now playing in select cities

The
film is
about a
Jewish vil
lage faced
with immi
nent attack
by German
forces. The

so-called village idiot, Schlomo (Lionel
Abelanski), suggests using a fake depor
tation train to remove the citizens from
the danger.
This suggestion is the basis of the
somewhat dopey "Train of Life" — some
villagers dress up as German soldiers,
others as prisoners. But they all jolly their

way through the Nazis
amidst the "hilarity"-of the
Holocaust.
The major flaw in "Train
of Life" is that it is unin
spired. The ending redeems
it to a large extent, but this
still doesn't make the viewer
feel much better about sup
porting an hour and a half of
French "comedy."
Perhaps the movie would
seem less bad if it hadn't
been beaten to the box office
by other "feel-good" geno
cide stories such as "Jakob
the Liar" and "Life is Beau
tiful."

While I cannot recommend the cine
matic aspect of this film, 1 can recom
mend it to those interested in klezmer
music. I do not jest — this movie has
some really great sounds. Unfortunately,

these are pretty incongruous with the plot
and action.
The other redeeming feature of
"Train of Life" is that it is in French and
directed and written by a Romanian,

Radu Mihaileanu. In my book, the multi
ethnicity factor is pretty cool. But little
else makes the movie worth watching.
