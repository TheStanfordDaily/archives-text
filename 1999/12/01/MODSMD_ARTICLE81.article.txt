# 'Journey' is another cryptic critical favorite
## 
### 
Director Atom Egoyan is one tough cookie to
crumble. Two of his previous movies, "Exotica"
(1994) and"The Sweet Hereafter" (1997), are
highly acclaimed dramas. I've seen both. While "Exoti
ca" is a finely crafted and sensual moviegoing experi
ence, "Hereafter" needs to be buried away in some ob-

scure art-film analysis
text. "Felicia's Journey,"
Egoyan's latest, suffers
from the same main defi
ciency as "Hereafter:" a
pointless story.
In "Hereafter," a
bus accident tears apart a

small Canadian town,
which falls under investigation by a lawyer. The drama of
bouncing between opinionated townsfolk really drags to
the point where I fell into a deep sleep. And I hardly ever
fall asleep in movies.
"Journey" similarly lacks throttle. Felicia (Elaine
Cassidy) is a pregnant teenage Irish girl who moves to
England in search of her boyfriend Johnny (Peter Mc-
Donald). All she knows is that he works in a factory— a
lawnmower factory, to be precise. Her voyage to Eng
land on a large cruise boat harkens back to the glory days

of "Titanic." 1 almost wish she had jumped
to end the movie right there. But alas, she
didn't.
Things really bog down once she meets
middle-aged catering manager Joseph
Hilditch (Bob Hoskins). Together, they
learn nuances about each other that they
themselves didn't even realize. 1 won't re
veal any crucial plot developments since
they're supposedly the reason why the
movie works.
The music in "Journey" is jarring and ir
ritating. The selections can be interpreted
this way or that, but at the base level, the
screeching military notes only make the
viewer uncomfortable and unhappy.
I remember Hoskins as Mario in the
dreadful "Super Mario Bros." While he
performs much better here as an old-fash-

ioned, secretive man in "Journey," his efforts are largely
wasted with a tedious script and boring plot. Who hon
estly cares if she finds Johnny? Why is Joseph so screwed
up in his head?
Critics also poured adulation on "Leaving Las Vegas"
because it showed the real heart and soul of depressed

human beings. Yes, agreed, but the movie was too cum
bersome to watch. "Felicia's Journey" is no different
from "Vegas" or "Hereafter." Cinematically nice on the
eyes, they all lose viewer interest very quickly.
