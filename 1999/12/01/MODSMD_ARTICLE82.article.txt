In the pouring rain, we navigated our
way through the maze that led to the
West Valley College Campus The
atre. After more than one misstep, we fi
nally found the theatre.
Upon entering and seating ourselves,
the first thing we couldn't help but notice
is the nature of the seats, which sink down
markedly in the middle, somewhat like a
cloth-covered toilet seat. I think it must
have been impossible to get comfortable
in those seats.
The theatre darkened, and clips from
an old black-and-white television show
played on a screen above the stage. Then
the actual play began with Lucas, who as
the narrator introduces the audience to
the setting.
Lucas has just gotten a job writing for
one of the most popular comedy shows on

television. However, in the 1950s Mc-
Carthyism era in which the play is set,
everyone has to be careful about what is
said. Max, the head of the show, is furious

Many of the jokes are
witty plays on words
that had the audience
roaring with laughter.

that the show is about to be shortened
from an hour and a half to an hour, as well
as several other NBC-induced changes
that will impede the show.
Much of the play focuses on the con
versations between the many writers as

they try to write the script for the next
show. They are forced to deal with Max's
anger about the changes as well as a po
tential drug problem, another writer's
hypochondria and various other issues
that arise.
The overall feel of the play is that of a
group of smart asses sitting around mak
ing wisecracks at one another. Many of
the jokes are witty playson words that had
the audience roaring with laughter.
However, as one character in the play
notices, there is an overabundance of
racial and ethnic jokes thrown back and
forth between writers. Finally, the wise
cracks just get old and repetitive, and with
bruised bottoms, we gladly found our way
back out into the rain.
