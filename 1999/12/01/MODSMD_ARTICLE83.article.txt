when talking to "Giant
Robot" (GR).
Shimizu was one of
the top models in 1995; the
slender Asian model with
scant hair and arms covered
with tattoos appeared in
the Calvin Klein One cam
paign. She is one of the

nany stars who has been featured in GR.
Her GR interview is like so few interviews of models
ind like so many interviews in GR. The interview is per

sonal, and the style is honest. In the interview, Shimizu
talks about drugged-up runway models, prank calls to
Charles Barkley from Madonna's Mercedes and a rap
music session from Shaquille O'Neal to Madonna's
home phone.
Eric Nakamura and Martin Wong, the editors of GR,
said their interview approach is to avoid star gazing. Un
like other magazines, they bring stars back to earth. GR
is an independent magazine focused on Asia and Asian-
American pop culture.
Wong said, "We cover what is cool, not what is con
sidered 'hot' by the Man or big business." Nakamura
continued, "We don't cover just anyone who's Asian —
the person needs to be awesome, not an ass-—
Besides interviews, GR features range from skate
boarding, sumo wrestling, Hong Kong films, Asian and
Asian American history, computers, anime, video games

and cooking. The magazine has a circulation of 120,000
and is sold in stores in the U.S. and Japan. Half the read
ership is non-Asian, and 70 percent is male.
Nakamura and Wong are speaking at Stanford today
from 8 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. in the Asian American Activities
Center Couchroom in Old Union. "Talk with 'Giant
Robot' Magazine: Publishing and Asian American Cul
ture" will cover GR's progression from a photocopied
staple-and-fold magazine to a glossy covered magazine.
The talk will address the issues of design, Web and
magazine publishing and the process of the interview
story. Aspects of Asian-American culture will also be
presented. The event is sponsored by Reflections, the
Korean American literary journal, the Asian American
Activities Center and The ASSU Speakers Bureau.
