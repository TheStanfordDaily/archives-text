## 'Sixties' tribute overemphasizes politics 
### 
The cover of Richard Avedon's
book "The Sixties" features a
huge neon red, purple and green
image of John Lennon. It seems to
promise the reader an exploration of the
psychadelia of the '60s.

tographs of
Frank
Zappa, Bob

Dylan, Andy Warhol, Allen Ginsberg, a
pair of naked hippies, neon images of the
Beatles and a two-page spread of Janis
Joplin.
This gives a browsing reader a grave
misrepresentation of the true nature of
this book. The majority of the book fo
cuses on political issues, with only a little
bit of music, art and psychadelia mixed in
for good measure. "The Sixties" forsakes
Woodstock and free love in favor of such
political events as the Vietnam War and
the Chicago Seven Conspiracy Trial.
The book is the product of Avedon's
collaboration with writer Doon Arbus. It
is a combination of photographs and
quotes relating to significant people and
events from the '60s.
For those readers unfamiliar with the
significant events of the '60s, there is a
timeline as well as individual biographies
of everyone featured in the book. Al
though it is well-hidden in the back of the
book, I would recommend reading the
timeline first. Understanding the back
ground of the speakers gives additional
meaning to the quotes and photographs
in the book and allows the reader to know
to whom the quotes are referring.

"The Sixties" presents this well-docu
mented decade through the words of
the people who lived it. It leaves the ob
jective history to the index, choosing in
stead to present controversial opinions,
thoughts and ideas straight from the
horses' mouths. For someone well
versed in the politics of the '60s, it pre
sents the rare opportunity to see and
hear directly from the people who made
things happen.
The interspersing of words and im
ages helps the book flow nicely. At
times, I found myself unable to stop
turning pages out of curiosity of what
would come next. However, after a
while, it became evident that there is no
underlying consistent structure to the
book.
Some photographs are randomly in
serted to add variety. For example, the
book moves from a discussion of the
Chicago Seven Conspiracy Trial to a set
of photographs featuring a neon shot of
Sly Stone in midair, a topless actress, a
couple shots of overweight guys expos
ing their guts and a set of drag queens.
Following this, it returns to the discus
sion of the Conspiracy Trial.
It feels like the authors' interests lie in
the politics of the '60s, but they were
told that a book of photographs about
politics would never sell to the general
public. So they added some random
shots of musicians, artists and drag
queens and tried to pass the book off as
something that it is not.
It's a shame, because "The Sixties"
feels like it could almost be something
special.
