# A 						whirlwind journey back to Medieval times awaits Crichton fans

Just like most of Michael Crichton's previous
books, "Timeline" is an intriguing look at future
science and how it may someday revolutionize our
world. In "Sphere," he pitted man against artificial in
telligence; in "Jurassic Park," he brought back the di-

nosaurs; here in "Time
line," he introduces the
even more fantastic no
tion of time travel.
As an inevitable re
sult of writing about time

travel, this 450-page
book is set partly in modern times and partly in the past.
This combination of science fiction and historical fic
tion definitely makes for an interesting read. After
Crichton has explained the science of the time machine
in his usual serious way, he changes his style to a more
casual one and takes the characters on an adventure to
Medieval France.
The story begins to unfold when one of corporate
giant ITC's premier scientists suddenly turns up in the
middle of the desert. While he is miles away from the
nearest town, he is neither dehydrated nor sunburned.
The only things that seem wrong with him are his bab
bling about medieval times and the lack of blood circu
lation in his fingertips, leading doctors to believe that he
is suffering from frostbite.
While ITC manages to make the scientist's death

look like a suicide, the researchers begin to realize that
they can't hide their secrets much longer.
Because ITC is about $2 billion short to finish its
time travel project, it needs to produce some interme
diary results to get investors interested again. It decides
to pressure a team of Yale scientists working at an ITC-

sponsored archaeological dig in France's
Dordogne Valley to reconstruct their me
dieval village as quickly as possible.
When Professor Johnston, the lead sci
entist on the dig, enters the time machine
and doesn't return, ITC recruits four of
his top students and sends them to 14th
century France to rescue him. Obviously,
if time travel were as easy as described,
they could have gotten him back by inter
cepting him before he even left for the
past, but that would have made fora pret
ty boring book.

The four recruits are a varied group. Marek has al
ways imagined that he lived in medieval times, and as a
result he is skilled in the language, the customs and
most of the combat techniques of the day. Chris is the
skirt-chaser who loves to study the old customs but who
wants no part of the actual thing. Kate is the wholesome
American girl who loves climbing any surface that will
allow it, and Stern is the techie who understands physics
and computers but not history.

When the Yale students arrive in the 14th century,
they are immediately faced with dangers modern-day
people couldn't even comprehend. They are ruthlessly
pursued by a group of blood-thirsty knights, nearly get
killed in a jousting match and become entwined in the
intrigues of the town.

Crichton's scientific explanations of
the concept of time travel, quantum me
chanics, teleportation and quantum foam
are perfectly tailored for the average
reader. When I suspended my own disbe
lief, the explanations he has written all
made perfect sense. Unfortunately, his
explanation of the grandfather paradox
(what happens when you go back in time
and kill one of your ancestors) is pretty
weak.
While the corporate types at ITC are
blamed for messing with such a delicate

thing as time travel for the purpose of entertainment,
Crichton himself is just as guilty. There's no doubt we
will soon have a movie and a theme-park ride based on
"Timeline."
In the meantime, this latest book is a real treat for
Crichton fans and anyone who wants an easy and fun
read for winter break.
