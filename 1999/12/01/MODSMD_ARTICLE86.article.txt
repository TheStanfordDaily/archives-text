## Decent Y2K manual for hippies and suburbanites 
### 
There are three basic responses
people make when asked about
the potential crisis of Y2K. One
might say, "With the advanced technolo
gy we have today and the computer ge
niuses out there, there'll be no problem."

The Hippy Survival Guide to Y2K
by Mike Oehler
$14.95 paperback

The next response is to admit there
may be minor problems in less important
sectors of business but to maintain Y2K
won't bring any major changes.
The last kind of response people make
falls somewhere between, "Be ready fora
revolution," and, "It's the end of the
world." Survival expert Mike Oehler
tackles this last response in his handbook,
"The Hippy Survival Guide to Y2K."
A self-described hippie, Oehler has
lived in a hand-built, underground house

since the early '70s. Over the years, he has
become somewhat of an expert on living
off the land. When he heard the dire pre
diction that computer programs all over
the world are far from ready to handle the
transition to the year 2000, Oehler took
on the mission of teaching jt he's
learned over the years to the general pub
lic.
The book begins with a diary of
Oehler's investigation of the Y2K issue.
With research from an array of sources,
one senses that Y2K may bring a greater
crisis than anyone realizes or will admit.
Oehler's careful and honest research pre
dicts problems with defense, energy and
health care systems. This will lead to
chaos as people struggle to live without
running water and electricity.
The next section discusses survival
strategies for urban, suburban and rural
communities in case Y2K is as serious a
threat as some predict. Oehler discusses
how to get clean water if water systems
fail, how to grow your own food and how
to build shelter. He also mentions other
useful strategies for coping during the po-

The book ends with a
discussion of how
modern social and
political problems
could be solved with
an overall change in
lifestyle.

tential crisis, including organizing com
munity outreaches and settling personal
and financial records.
The book ends with a discussion of so
cial and political problems in the modern
world that could be solved with an overall
change in lifestyle and philosophical
mindset, guided by Oehler's personal
manifesto. Oehler's philosophy is a blend
of Eastern religion and New Age spiritu
ality. While it is interesting, this section
lacks integration with the rest of the
guide, making it the weakest part of the

book.
While this book provides intriguing
predictions and ideas, I found it difficult
to get through the long descriptions about
Oehler's personal history and battles with
his local community and vegetable gar
den. As Oehler admits, "The Hippy
Guide" is written with urgency and under
great pressure, which gives it a somewhat
haphazard feel. It seems Oehler could not
decide whether he wanted to write a per
sonal diary or a handbook, which weak
ens some of the power of his arguments
and solutions.
As we come closer to the end of the
year, it is still difficult for us to really know
what the year 2000 will bring. Still, in the
event that we do find ourselves left with
out power as the clock strikes midnight,
Oehler's book seems a useful tool to have
around.
