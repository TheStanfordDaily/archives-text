nity of approximately
40 artists who rent
gallery space in down
town Palo Alto.
Built in 1926 by
Birge Clarke to house
Phelps-Terkel's colle
giate clothing, the
building is located on
a street frequented by

rich ladies in their limousines from San Francisco until
the Depression started. Visitors enter through a
blood-red door with an old-fashioned mail slot and
fancy ironwork; the floor is artistically studded with
red, green and blue tiles.
This particular exhibit showcases an extraordinary
variety of mediums and styles, ranging from flesh-col
ored fish sculptures to silver curlicue jewelry with
jasper and agate semi-precious stones. The most
unique pieces, though, are mainly sculpture. Theresa
Robinson's playful folk art images are wood-carved,
painted and given wings and names such as "The
Winged Knight."
In stark contrast, there are black Japanese-like
vases and fountains that seem to be made of slate rock,
but in actuality Barbara Brown sculpts them from clay
and applies her own dark glazes.
With startling originality, Christina Macpherson
and Richard Bostrom display several pieces of gor
geous sculpture that differ most significantly from the
other works. Pegasus-like figures and rocking horses

made from clay are
painted in demure
greens and blues by
acpherson. Their
conical snouts, blank
faces and random
arrangement on blocks
with squatting frogs
and naked women
leave a memorable im
pression.
Bostrom's pieces
are gentle enough to be
associated with a chil
dren's room, but they
are made of a seeming
cacophony of polished
wooden kitchen uten
sils. Portions are paint
ed with flush rainbows.

yet he stated that they "have an undercurrent of risk or
danger."
There are also a vast amount of paintings made of
oils, acrylics, charcoal, pencil and batik on silk. Twen
ty-six of the co-op's members are painters, and their
interests span the art spectrum. Joan Hancock's vi
brant prints have folk art quality to them, but the gor
geous purple trunks of the orange trees and golden
lion have the exactness and color reminiscent of Indi
an art.
There are also some wonderful pieces by Henkel-
Wallace that look a bit like Cezanne's fruit pictures en
larged and smoothed. Solitary grapes and pears cast
tinges of green and purple into their own shadows, re
flecting the Impressionist idea of color exchange.
Similar but distinct, Cat Roberts concentrates on
fruit as well, but these paintings are more two-dimen
sional and modernist, an almost still-life Peter Max.
The hanging lemons here have bright turquoise shad
ows, and the Granny Smith apple is outlined in scarlet.

A small amount of photogaphy, landscapes and in
ternational work is also part of the exhibition, includ
ing a piece showing two rhinos surrounded by ethere
al mist and pastel landscape by Michael Tarr, who is a
photographer working on a series about India.
Not only is the art enjoyable, but the titles, such as
Cathy Young's "Morning Dove Mandala," are cre
ative. When painting, Young "considers any widely
held, archetypal significance that the image might
carry, as well as any possible relevance to her own life
circumstances."
For 39 years the co-operative has been part of the
Palo Alto art scene, allowing local artists to display
their work fora small membership fee and certain
staffing requirements. In this manner, The Gallery
House is able to be entirely self-supporting. The
"Think Art" exhibit is open through Dec. 24, and it is
something well worth attending.
