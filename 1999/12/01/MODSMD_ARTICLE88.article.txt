## Feeling sexy on the inside 
### Roxy Sass Staff writer 
Miss Sass believes that every woman should own a minimum of one in
credibly sexy bra and pair of panties. Nothing is quite as feminine as beauti
ful lingerie, and wearing such undergarments, even when never seen, can
give a woman an assured demeanor. A person's appearance influences sell
image, and lingerie can produce a steady voice, an unabashed gaze and a de
liberate walk.
Sexuality is empowering. Many women find power and control in an
drogyny and escape sexual minimization by avoiding sexuality. However,
overcoming sexual discrimination requires acknowledging gender. Miss
Sass finds even greater power, control and self-confidence in possessing her
own sexuality.
A woman's undergarments should reflect her personality and her sexual
fantasies. Lingerie falls into three general categories â€” the good girl, the
bad girl and the queen. Outfits range from mere suggestions of genre to full
fledged costumes. A woman may want attire from all three categories so she
can match her underwear to her mood.
Good-girl personas include the baby doll, the angel and the virgin. These
lingerie are often lace, cotton, satin and chiffon and are highly adorned with
frills, feathers, ruffles and sparkles. Common colors are white, pastels and
red and the fabric may have flower or heart patterns.
The bad girl is the dominatrix, the vampire or the prostitute. These out
fits are generally made of leather, lycra, spandex or other glossy materials.
Typically red or black, they may be accented with chains, buckles and ani
mal print.
The queen wears rich fabrics such as satin and velvet, dyed deep reds,
blues, greens or metallics. This lingerie may have an exotic flair and is often
ornamented with pearls, gems, furs and fine trim.
Within each group, lingerie ranges from concealing to highly exposing.
And many outfits, such as crotchless panties, morph from one to the other.
Don't confuse concealing with conservative. Humans, and men in partic
ular, are extremely visual creatures, and such stimulation releases testos
terone into the blood. However, sometimes what a person sees with the
mind's eye is more erotic and tantalizing than a real visual feast, which is why
many men prefer to masturbate to the Victoria Secret catalog than to Play
boy.
Lingerie in its most basic form is a bra and panties, but many more elab
orate garments exist. A woman may wear a bustier in place of her bra. This
corset-like article covers the breasts and ribcage and can proceed down to
the hips, molding the woman into an hourglass. It may be strapless and is
often laced up the front. Bustiers are striking when accompanied by a garter
belt and stockings.
The teddy is a one-piece bra and panty synthesis resembling a leotard or
bodysuit. A camisole is a loose and slinky tank top. Lacking support, the
camisole-and-panty combo is most practical for sleepwear.
The baby doll and the chemise are both dresslike lingerie impractical for
anything other than sexual play. The baby doll is generally a bra and panty
set with sheer fabric draped from the bottom of the bra to create a very short
dress. The chemise is simply a very short dress with matching panties.
All of these lingerie outfits can be accessorized, and the options are truly
endless. A woman can add gloves, shoes, a boa, a robe, panty hose, leg
garters or a garter belt with thigh-high stockings. And each accessory comes
in an immense array of styles.
When shopping for lingerie, a woman must avoid becoming so involved
in appearance that she forgets her own comfort. Regardless of how she
looks, she won't feel very sexy if she's in pain. If at all possible, she should try
these garments on because poorly fitting lingerie is excruciatingly uncom
fortable. The fabric should feel good to the touch on both sides. Many syn
thetics are like burlap on the underside and will chafe.
Wires, fabric edges and thick seams can jab, poke or cut, and tight elastic
bands can cut off circulation. Anything too small will be constricting and se
verely unflattering.
1 ligh French-cut panties may not stay put on a woman's rump. The cut
may flatter the leg. but the wedgie will be unattractive as well as uncomfort
able.
Also, a woman should never wear anything that makes her feel ridiculous
or otherwise self-conscious. Undergarments should make a woman feel
beautiful and erotic, and when she's with a partner, she should get pleasure
from the pleasure her outfit gives that partner. Otherwise, her lingerie con
verts her into a sexual gift adorned solely for the gratification of another.
A woman should wear lingerie for herself. When used correctly, lingerie
can empower a woman in her daily life and eroticize her sexual life. Lingerie
helps a woman celebrate her femininity. Let the festivities begin.
