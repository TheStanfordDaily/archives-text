# What the hell is cuisine?
## I'm Going to France! (In Search of Falafel) 
### 
Nothing hits the spot like a good falafel. Nothing. Couple that great fact with last
issue's mediocre Cali-vege shawerma, and you've got two reviewers craving some of
the tasty Mediterranean "cuisine" we found in France. Ah, Paris.
The Latin Quarter's Greek falafel was crisp and greenish, with tahini and optional french
fries on top. The Marais (Jewish Quarter) falafel at L'As du Fallafel was quite flavorful, com
plete with its wide variety of chopped vegetables (fried eggplant optional) and snapshots of
patrons Lenny Kravitz and Jean-Claude Van Damme lining its walls.
But wc can't always head over to the Continent fora quick pita with Lenny, nor can we go
to the falafel's country of creation. So, fueled by the memory of the sort of treat we found at
those street-side falafel vendors and the need to find a satisfying surrogate nearby, your faith
ful food columnists went in search of a Palo Alto equivalent to the eat-and-go falafel "stand."
Wait; before we proceed, you may be asking, "What the hell is a falafel?" Well, since we're
no strangers to essay filler and short-sighted research tactics, we decided to consult the "Ox
ford English Dictionary" to assure you of the "right" definition. Of the seven listed, the first
refers to "Filafil — broad beans, garlic, onions, 0i1... form mixture into balls and fry them."
Fora slightly less "spoken-word" definition, the "OED" also provides this definition: "Fe
lafel. (Bought off a stand in a street) is made of a highly spiced mixture of deep-fried balls of
ground chickpea, small peppers and pickled cucumbers, served hot between halves of peeta.
It can be ordered hot (pepper hot) or mild." Back here in the South Bay, however, we've
heard some West Coast "cowboys" refer to the falafel as "the hamburger of the Middle East"
or the "Arabian taco."
Tres-Ex:
This falafel-to-go comes in three different brands that all inevitably end up in plastic wrap.
Though the same sogginess and loss of freshness happens to every packaged attempt — be it
at Whole Foods or Safeway — we still have to give a resounding thumbs-down to the soggy
blandness of these sad sacks of mush.
Flo-Mo:
The "falafels" plunked down on our seasoned dorm veteran trays have typically been a dried
up ball with the rubbery texture of a stale donut-hole. Wendy has even seen kids play bad
minton with these inedible bad boys after dinner in the courtyard. Something is wrong with
this picture, don't you think?
The un-named co-op and the non-specified Mirrielees kitchen:
The trouble with making the cuisine attempt yourself is that you probablv won't have the ex
perience and vats of frying oil that have both matured with years of use. Shirley's falafel
ended up tasting just like that of the un-named co-op: somehow, each crunchy bite ended up
tasting only of oil and air.
Mediterranean Wraps:
This little restaurant is conveniently open late (even on Sunday!) and just a short hop from a
Marguerite stop on California Ave. Mediterranean Wraps is pretty popular with Stanford
students and locals alike, but perhaps its main draw is its über-friendlv atmosphere. The chip
per part-time engineers who run this outfit have been known to implore, "Why are you tak
ing this falafel to go? Please, have a seat out front. It's such a nice day today."
The counter-top spread of snacks, which includes baklava (a Turkish dessert made from
thin pieces of flaky pastry, honey and nuts), pistachio shortbread cookies, halawa (a sweet
sesame dessert paste), yogurt drinks and Brazilian and Turkish ground coffees, are just as
charming as the staff.
Their falafel wrap, however, is a bit short on the flavor side of things. Perhaps the problem
is an emphasis on quantity over quality; the Mediterranean falafel is a huge affair bundled in
side a grilled "wrap" tortilla, and the actual falafel balls are on the dry side — more texture
than taste! We might have better liked the "deluxe" option with added fried potato and egg
plant if only it was less oily and, well, tastier.
Robaii's Persian Bites:
Like Mediterranean Wraps, Robaii's offers inexpensive Persian eats in a very casual eat-in
or take-out setting. Open six days a week until 8 p.m., Robaii's is also a short trip from the bus
stop. But that's pretty much where the similarities end. Robaii's is not much of a social scene,
but the food is delicious. Their falafel "sandwich" consists of several moist and flavorful
falafel balls with lettuce, tomato, tahini and hot sauce in a pita.
Along with the typical tabouli and hummus sides, they also offer an interesting variety of
dining options, including a pomegranate paste dish and the obligatory yogurt drink. But the
grand finale of any meal at Robaii has to be their rose-water and nut baklava, a sweet and
moist flaky pastry triangle that puts Mediterranean Wraps' baklava to shame. To shame!
And so, we salute you, Persian Bites, for providing the tastiest falafel and trimmings
around. It's a pilgrimage any student should and can make without the added baggage of re
ligious fervor and / or a huge travel budget.
