PASADE-NA, Calif. — Next
year, the spectacle w ill happen again.
•The visits to Disneyland and jokes
with Jay Leno. storylines revolving
• jiround point spreads and injuries, vi
cious insults traded between oppos
ing fans, and finally, two teams doing
, battle down on the historic field of
the Rose Bowl.
All what will be left of this year's
game will be this notation in the pro
gram: 2(KH) — Wisconsin 17. Stan
ford 9. And that is a shame.
"Wisconsin 17. Stanford 9"
doesn't do the players of Stanford's
football team justice, li doesn't de
ascribe the grit of Troy Walters and
Willie How; ird, starting in the Rose
Bowl after sustaining serious injuries
that supposedly ruled them out of
this, the biggest game of their lives. It
doesn't describe the heart shown by
the Stanford defense in limiting the
Wisconsin offensive machine to 17
points and stuffing Ron Davne
throughout most of the game, after
m , ,
enduring ridicule from critics for an
entire season. It doesn't describe the
intensity brought by every single
Stanford player onto the field — si
lencing their doubters once and for
all.
But in the end. what really mat
ters? Wisconsin 17. Stanford 9. Just
ask Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham.
"I don't believe in moral victo
ries." Willingham said. "When you
walk in a locker room after a game of
this nature and you see the emotions
of our guys: the crying, the disap

pointment — that's not a moral vic
tory in my mind."
The way the game unfolded was a
bit shocking, because the story of the
Cardinal's season has been the di

chotomy between its offense and de
fense. As senior quarterback l odd
Husak and the offense averaged a
whopping 4(i7 yards and 37 points
per game, the defense gave most of it

right back, surrendering 453 yards
and 32 points per contest.
The Stanford offense ranked near
the top of NCAA Division 1-A at
filth overall in total offense; the de

fense down with the Buffalos and
Nevadas at 110 th of 114 teams in
total defense.
So when the Stanford defense
sent the Badger offense back to the

bench wilh three consecutive three
and-outs to start the game, many of
the spectators were, say, a little
