enduring ridicule from critics for an

intensity brought by every single
Stanford player onto the field — si

But in the end. what really mat

ask Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham.
"I don't believe in moral victo

walk in a locker room after a game of
this nature and you see the emotions

The way the game unfolded was a
bit shocking, because the story of the
Cardinal's season has been the di

chotomy between its offense and de
fense. As senior quarterback l odd
Husak and the offense averaged a
whopping 4(i7 yards and 37 points
per game, the defense gave most of it

right back, surrendering 453 yards
and 32 points per contest.
The Stanford offense ranked near
the top of NCAA Division 1-A at
filth overall in total offense; the de

fense down with the Buffalos and
Nevadas at 110 th of 114 teams in
total defense.
So when the Stanford defense
sent the Badger offense back to the

bench wilh three consecutive three
and-outs to start the game, many of
the spectators were, say, a little

stunned. Perhaps it was payback to
the media who had ripped the Stan
ford defense over its statistics end

FOOTBALL

■ Saturday: No. 21 Stanford 9, No. 4
Wisconsin 17.

Of course, the fact that Howard
was even playing was stunning in its
own right. The head "Trenchdog"
injured his knee in Stanford's regu
lar season finale against Notre
Dame, and was pronounced out for
the Rose Howl with an injured ACL.
Without him, the task of stopping
the NCAA I)iv. I-A all-time leading
rusher went from difficult to better
pray-for-a-miracle. Stanford coach
es hinted at his return all week, and
sure enough, on Wisconsin's first of
fensive play, who was in to tackle
Ron Dayne? None other than
1 loward.
It's hard to imagine a worse day to
be a Stanford fan than last Tuesday
— the day Troy Walters tearfully an
nounced he would be missing the
Rose Bowl with a dislocated wrist.
Already with Howard supposedly
out, the Cardinal appeared to be

without its two best players on each
side of the ball — at least for the mo
ment.
"Thursday the doctors came up to
me and told me that they had re
searched the injury and that there
was no further risk," Walters said.
"They asked me how it felt and
|since| it was getting better each day.
they put a cast on, the same thing I
wore on. I could catch the ball, and
so Thursday afternoon I knew I had
a chance, and then it just got better
and better. [Friday] 1 knew I was
going to play."
The injuries don't stop there —
senior center Mike McLaughlin, who
had started 45 straight games for the
Cardinal and is the team's best offen
sive lineman, tore his right ACL in
practice last week. McLaughlin actu
ally started the game to keep his
streak alive. After the first play, the
senior went back to the bench while
Zack Quaccia moved into his spot at
center and Joe Fairchild took over
for Quaccia at left guard.
It probably was not a coincidence
that as McLaughlin went down, the
Stanford running game went down
with him. The Stanford running
backs might have left their game
back at the team hotel — all told, the

net rushing total on the day for the
Cardinal was negative five yards,
lime after time, whether it was Coy
Wire, Kerry Carter or Brian Allen,
the holes just were not there for the
Cardinal.
In contrast, the man who was sup
posed to flatten the Stanford de
fense, Heisman Trophy winner
Dayne, did end the game with 2(K)
yards on 34 carries and a touchdown.
He was, in fact, named the Rose
Bowl MVP for the second year in a
row. But Dayne found little running
room initially, as the Stanford defen
sive front, led by Howard and senior
linebacker Sharcus Steen, plugged
up the holes created by the massive
Wisconsin offensive line.
Meanwhile, Wisconsin's redshirt
freshman quarterback. Brooks
Bollinger, looked more like a lost
rookie than the Big 10 Freshman of
the Year. Bollinger badly overthrew
receivers in the first half and could
not get his offense into a rhythm, es
pecially with Dayne going nowhere.
"I don't think he was as sharp today
as he's been all year," Alvarez said.
"Maybe he was long 011 a couple
throws and maybe he was flushed
(out of the pocket) a bit quickerin
crunch time I did see him step up and

perform better." Bollinger finished 7
of 14 for 105 yards on the day.
Wisconsin wasn't the only one
having offensive problems. For the
first time since the Texas game, four
months and a lifetime ago, the Stan
foal offense had met its match.
Husak, feeling pressure from
Badger defensive end Wendell
Bryant, had little time to make his
reads and rushed throws to his re
ceivers. It wasn't until the end of the
first quarter before the Cardinal of
fense finally got moving — Husak
moved the ball quickly down the
field as four different receivers
caught balls. The first quarter ended
with goose eggs up for both teams,
and many bored fans in the seats —
quite a contrast to the supposed of
fensive showdown that had been
hyped all week.
Stanford took the first lead with a
28-yard field goal by junior Mike
Biselli
It certainly didn't help when the
Cardinal's long snapper went down.
John Sande sprained his ankle on a
punt in the first half — which led to
his backup, Anthony Gabriel, snap
ping the ball over 1 lusak on an extra
point attempt — denying the Cardi
nal an extra point. Sande gutted it up

and went back out for a field goal at
tempt by Biselli, but again the snap
was bad, this time behind Husak. By
the time I lusak got the ball set, Wis
consin blocked the kick and kept its
lead at 10-9.
That would be as close as the Car
dinal got. Thanks to a 31-yard punt
by Stanford's Sean Tolpinrud, Wis
consin started at the Cardinal 40-
vard line, and three rushes by Dayne
set up a huge fourth and two at the
32-yard line with 8:48 left in the
game.
With a one-point lead, and the
game possibly in the balance,
Bollinger faked the handoff to
Dayne, and fired a pass over the mid
dle to seldom-used tight end John
Sigmund, who hobbled and juggled
and finally caught the ball for a Wis
consin first down. Sigmund got the
ball on the next play as well, a 22-
yard pass that took the Badgers to
the Stanford 3. Bollinger ran a quar
terback sneak to give Wisconsin the
touchdown, and after the extra point
the Badgers were up 17-9 with 7:22
left.
Fisetsky later missed a chance to
put Wisconsin up by two scores,
pushing his 34-yard field goal try to
the left. Husak, who finished 17-of

34 for 258 yards, and the Stanford of
fense had the ball on their own 20
with 2:19 left and one timeout. The
season, ranging from the low point at
Texas to the highlight against Cal,
had come down to one drive.
Husak worked the ball twice to
Tafiti Uso, and after two Cardinal
false starts and a sack by Wisconsin,
he managed to get the ball to
Deßonnie Pitts for 15 yards. After a
delay of game, Stanford was left with
a fourth and 12 at the Badger 46.
Husak took the snap in the shot
gun, faked the handoff to Wire, and
then slipped and fell down.
Just like that, the game was over.
Wisconsin ran the clock out, and
took possession of the Rose Bowl
trophy for the second year in a row,
the first time a Big 10 team had ac
complished such a feat.
"Am I proud of our young men?"
Willingham said. "Without question.
I think our football team showed
themselves well, and I think the
country saw a football team and a
football program that is an outstand
ing football team and an outstanding
football program."
And that is something that Stan
ford fans will always remember, win
or loss.

FOOTBALL

■ Saturday: No. 21 Stanford 9, No. 4
Wisconsin 17.

Of course, the fact that Howard
was even playing was stunning in its
own right. The head "Trenchdog"
injured his knee in Stanford's regu
lar season finale against Notre
Dame, and was pronounced out for
the Rose Howl with an injured ACL.
Without him, the task of stopping
the NCAA I)iv. I-A all-time leading
rusher went from difficult to better
pray-for-a-miracle. Stanford coach
es hinted at his return all week, and
sure enough, on Wisconsin's first of
fensive play, who was in to tackle
Ron Dayne? None other than
1 loward.
It's hard to imagine a worse day to
be a Stanford fan than last Tuesday
— the day Troy Walters tearfully an
nounced he would be missing the
Rose Bowl with a dislocated wrist.
Already with Howard supposedly
out, the Cardinal appeared to be

without its two best players on each
side of the ball — at least for the mo
ment.
"Thursday the doctors came up to
me and told me that they had re
searched the injury and that there
was no further risk," Walters said.
"They asked me how it felt and
|since| it was getting better each day.
they put a cast on, the same thing I
wore on. I could catch the ball, and
so Thursday afternoon I knew I had
a chance, and then it just got better
and better. [Friday] 1 knew I was
going to play."
The injuries don't stop there —
senior center Mike McLaughlin, who
had started 45 straight games for the
Cardinal and is the team's best offen
sive lineman, tore his right ACL in
practice last week. McLaughlin actu
ally started the game to keep his
streak alive. After the first play, the
senior went back to the bench while
Zack Quaccia moved into his spot at
center and Joe Fairchild took over
for Quaccia at left guard.
It probably was not a coincidence
that as McLaughlin went down, the
Stanford running game went down
with him. The Stanford running
backs might have left their game
back at the team hotel — all told, the

net rushing total on the day for the
Cardinal was negative five yards,
lime after time, whether it was Coy
Wire, Kerry Carter or Brian Allen,
the holes just were not there for the
Cardinal.
In contrast, the man who was sup
posed to flatten the Stanford de
fense, Heisman Trophy winner
Dayne, did end the game with 2(K)
yards on 34 carries and a touchdown.
He was, in fact, named the Rose
Bowl MVP for the second year in a
row. But Dayne found little running
room initially, as the Stanford defen
sive front, led by Howard and senior
linebacker Sharcus Steen, plugged
up the holes created by the massive
Wisconsin offensive line.
Meanwhile, Wisconsin's redshirt
freshman quarterback. Brooks
Bollinger, looked more like a lost
rookie than the Big 10 Freshman of
the Year. Bollinger badly overthrew
receivers in the first half and could
not get his offense into a rhythm, es
pecially with Dayne going nowhere.
"I don't think he was as sharp today
as he's been all year," Alvarez said.
"Maybe he was long 011 a couple
throws and maybe he was flushed
(out of the pocket) a bit quickerin
crunch time I did see him step up and

perform better." Bollinger finished 7
of 14 for 105 yards on the day.
Wisconsin wasn't the only one
having offensive problems. For the
first time since the Texas game, four
months and a lifetime ago, the Stan
foal offense had met its match.
Husak, feeling pressure from
Badger defensive end Wendell
Bryant, had little time to make his
reads and rushed throws to his re
ceivers. It wasn't until the end of the
first quarter before the Cardinal of
fense finally got moving — Husak
moved the ball quickly down the
field as four different receivers
caught balls. The first quarter ended
with goose eggs up for both teams,
and many bored fans in the seats —
quite a contrast to the supposed of
fensive showdown that had been
hyped all week.
Stanford took the first lead with a
28-yard field goal by junior Mike
Biselli
It certainly didn't help when the
Cardinal's long snapper went down.
John Sande sprained his ankle on a
punt in the first half — which led to
his backup, Anthony Gabriel, snap
ping the ball over 1 lusak on an extra
point attempt — denying the Cardi
nal an extra point. Sande gutted it up

and went back out for a field goal at
tempt by Biselli, but again the snap
was bad, this time behind Husak. By
the time I lusak got the ball set, Wis
consin blocked the kick and kept its
lead at 10-9.
That would be as close as the Car
dinal got. Thanks to a 31-yard punt
by Stanford's Sean Tolpinrud, Wis
consin started at the Cardinal 40-
vard line, and three rushes by Dayne
set up a huge fourth and two at the
32-yard line with 8:48 left in the
game.
With a one-point lead, and the
game possibly in the balance,
Bollinger faked the handoff to
Dayne, and fired a pass over the mid
dle to seldom-used tight end John
Sigmund, who hobbled and juggled
and finally caught the ball for a Wis
consin first down. Sigmund got the
ball on the next play as well, a 22-
yard pass that took the Badgers to
the Stanford 3. Bollinger ran a quar
terback sneak to give Wisconsin the
touchdown, and after the extra point
the Badgers were up 17-9 with 7:22
left.
Fisetsky later missed a chance to
put Wisconsin up by two scores,
pushing his 34-yard field goal try to
the left. Husak, who finished 17-of

34 for 258 yards, and the Stanford of
fense had the ball on their own 20
with 2:19 left and one timeout. The
season, ranging from the low point at
Texas to the highlight against Cal,
had come down to one drive.
Husak worked the ball twice to
Tafiti Uso, and after two Cardinal
false starts and a sack by Wisconsin,
he managed to get the ball to
Deßonnie Pitts for 15 yards. After a
delay of game, Stanford was left with
a fourth and 12 at the Badger 46.
Husak took the snap in the shot
gun, faked the handoff to Wire, and
then slipped and fell down.
Just like that, the game was over.
Wisconsin ran the clock out, and
took possession of the Rose Bowl
trophy for the second year in a row,
the first time a Big 10 team had ac
complished such a feat.
"Am I proud of our young men?"
Willingham said. "Without question.
I think our football team showed
themselves well, and I think the
country saw a football team and a
football program that is an outstand

And that is something that Stan
ford fans will always remember, win
