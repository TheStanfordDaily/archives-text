Dayne was the Stanford coaching
staff's forbidden apple. The Cardi
nal decided it wanted a running
game, and it paid for it.

Though the Stanford defense
was able to shut down the I Icisman
Trophy-winner in the first half, all
he needed to change the game was
one big play. Stanford coaches un
doubtedly wanted one similar play
on their side of the ball, but never
got it.

en route to earning his second con

The fact that Stanford's defense
could be considered successful
after Dayne ran for 200 yards,
scored what was effectively the

game-winning touchdown and was
named the game's M Vl' says a Int.
In comparison, Stanford's lead
ing rusher was junior Coy Wire,
who had six yards on five carries.
In all, the Cardinal netted negative
five yards rushing.
It's understandable that Stan
ford coach Tyrone Willingham
would want to establish a ground
game, but by the fourth quarter he
was beating a dead horse.
The Cardinal offense's last play
was a perfect example. On fourth

its last chance, quarterback Todd

The defense did all it could. It
held Wisconsin to three points at
halftime, the lowest point total for
the Badgers in any half this season.
