k It wasn't just his stats or his
touchdown run or anything about
performance in particular.
Dayne was the Stanford coaching
staff's forbidden apple. The Cardi
nal decided it wanted a running
game, and it paid for it.

Though the Stanford defense
was able to shut down the I Icisman
Trophy-winner in the first half, all
he needed to change the game was
one big play. Stanford coaches un
doubtedly wanted one similar play
on their side of the ball, but never
got it.
Wisconsin's senior tailback
rushed for 200 yards on 34 carries
en route to earning his second con
secutive Rose Bowl MVI' trophy.
The fact that Stanford's defense
could be considered successful
after Dayne ran for 200 yards,
scored what was effectively the

game-winning touchdown and was
named the game's M Vl' says a Int.
In comparison, Stanford's lead
ing rusher was junior Coy Wire,
who had six yards on five carries.
In all, the Cardinal netted negative
five yards rushing.
It's understandable that Stan
ford coach Tyrone Willingham
would want to establish a ground
game, but by the fourth quarter he
was beating a dead horse.
The Cardinal offense's last play
was a perfect example. On fourth
and 22 and with Stanford down to
its last chance, quarterback Todd

llusak lines up in the shotgun,
takes a snap and fakes a draw to
Wire.
lakes a draw?
The fans weren't fooled. Wis
consin wasn't fooled. The only
people who seemed fooled were
llusak and Wire, who collided on
the fake, llusak slipped and was
sacked. Game over.
The defense did all it could. It
held Wisconsin to three points at
halftime, the lowest point total for
the Badgers in any half this season.
