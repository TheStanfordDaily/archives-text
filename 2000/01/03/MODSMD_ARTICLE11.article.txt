# A 						flock of Badgers

What I want to know is, while
Wisconsin played in the Rose
Bowl, who, exactly, was left in the
state of Wisconsin?
As the throng of Badger fans de
scended on the greater Los Angeles
area, there couldn't have been more
than three or four people in Green
Bay and two in Milwaukee.
Hopefully the last person out re
membered to turn off the lights and
put the cheese on ice.

Everywhere you looked in Los
Angeles, you could not help but see
the unmistakable visage of a Badger
backer.
You could throw a hunk of Ched
dar anywhere in the southern Cali
fornia area and be guaranteed to hit a
Badger.
At the airport they unloaded suit
cases of clothing, cheese-heads and
bratwurst. They strolled down Sun
set amidst models and movie stars,
their pale skin tones a stark contrast
to the red of Bucky the Badger on
their shirts. Even as the Stanford
Band rallied the Santa Monica pier,
there stood the Badger faithful.
One could only imagine their re
actions to the antics of the band.
"Gee, honey, why is that man
wearing only underwear and playing
a keg like a drum?"
"We 11... unim ... you sure don't
see that in Kenosha."
Despite their ecccntricities and
the fact that their team outlasted the
Cardinal in the Rose Bowl 17-9. two
obvious facts about the Wisconsin
fans remain.
One, they are great football fans.

While their only cheer may be the
off-beat chorus of "Ron Dayne", the
Wisconsin fans love their Badger
football, and have provided invalu
able support to a team that became
the first Big 10 Conference team in
history to capture two consecutive
Rose Bowl crowns.
Just as they love the Packers, Wis
consin fans come out in droves for
their beloved Badgers.
In last year's Rose Bowl game
against UCLA, the Badger fans out
numbered Bruin supporters in a
game played in UCLA's home stadi
um.
Such support, an unquestionable
mark of excellence in college football
(see: Nebraska, Tennessee and Flori
da), is a big part of the Wisconsin
phenomenon that has swept over the
Big 10 during Barry Alvarez's highly
successful coaching career.
And two, gosh darn it, they're just
nice people. While gametime ten
sions between the two cheering sec
tions may have been high, you take
the football away from the Badgers
and out come the smiles. Every Wis
consin fan I talked to over the week
end (which was a lot, as we estab
lished their omnipresence earlier)
was unfailingly nice and polite.
In my hotel, an older lady wearing
an outrageous Bucky the Badger T
shirt wished me luck with school and
a safe trip back up North just as the
Wisconsin players had finished man
handling the Stanford rushing attack
with vicious determination.
I would be proud to share a beer
and a brat with any of the Wisconsin
fans I met â€” although I'd have a hard
time matching the red T-shirt, khaki
shorts, black socks and tennis shoes
ensemble that seemed to be the stan
dard dress code.
Phis is not to say, however, that
the Stanford fans weren't up to the
Badger gauntlet. After two disap
pointing seasons of football on the


Ben
Jones
Farm, the student body and the alum
ni have been energized by this year's
trip to the Rose Bowl.

Stanford sold its entire allotment
of student tickets, and while the
bright red of the Badger horde
seemed to dominate the Rose Bowl
panorama, there was a lot of Cardinal
in the stands too.
As Stanford drove in an attempt to

score a game-tying touchdown late in
the fourth quarter, every Todd Husak
pass completion was greeted with a
deafening roar, and watching the
faces of the members of the Band, the
yell leaders and the fans as Wisconsin
stopped the Cardinal on fourth and

-12 to end the rally, you knew some
thing special had happened.
In the look of sadness on the faces
of the Cardinal fans, you knew Stan
lord football had returned.
Stanford senior wide receiver
Troy Walters spoke after the game

about the importance of the fans in
Stanford's shocking rise to the top of
the PacK) this year. Hopefully with a
few more seasons like this one, and a
few more trips to Pasadena under our
belts, it will be Palo Alto, not just
Madison, that's left empty on Stan

ford game days.

Ben Jones, a junior, would like to con
gratulate tlwplayers, fans and universi
ties at Stanford and Wisconsin who
helped make.the Rose Howl as magic
as it could he.
