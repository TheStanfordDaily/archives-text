# Defensive resurgence leads Cardinal charge 1
## 
### Ben Freda Editorial staff 
PASADENA, Calif. — This season,
Stanford's defense has hardly been the team's
strong suit.
But at the Rose Bowl on Saturday, there
was a deep rumbling from the Stanford de
fensive squad. Despite the 17-9 loss, the
team's defense looked good — even against
Wisconsin's offensive leader: a 265-pound
running machine named Ron Dayne.
Granted, Dayne — this year's Heisman
Trophy winner — finished the game with 2(X)
yards on 34 carries. True, he did score a touch

down and led the Badgers offensive resur
gence in the second half.
But the real heroic story on Saturday be
longed to Stanford's defense, which almost
single-handedly turned a game that was sup
posed to he a blowout in the Badgers' favor to
a hard-fought gridiron war.
Simply: in the Rose Bowl, Stanford's de
fense came to play in Pasadena.
Against the backdrop of the Cardinal sea
son. what happened Saturday was about far
more than Wisconsin's offense. Rather, it was
an amazing testament to the surprising and
gutsy performance of a much-maligned Car
dinal defense that has been the brunt of jokes

and ridicule for much of the season.
Stanford entered the game with the fifth
worst defense in the nation. And what was
even more worrisome for Stanford fans was
what that defense was up against: one of the
best runners in NCAA history, senior Ron
Dayne of Wisconsin, an on-the-ground nim
bler extraordinaire.
Conservative betters were putting the line
at 10 points. Most others had Stanford blown
out by far more than that.
But in the entire first half, and most of the
second. Dayne — and, by extension, the en
tire Wisconsin offense — was shut down com
pletely by gutsy play by the Stanford defen

sive squad.
In the first half, Dayne was rendered ut
terly useless. In the entire first quarter, the
team could score only three points by half
time. Dayne managed only 46 yards on 12
carries in the first half for 3.8 yards per carry.
On the second play in the second half,
however, Dayne caught a break and was able
to rumble 64 yards before he was caught by
senior cornerback Frank Primus and brought
down a few yards from the end zone, setting
up his four-yard touchdown run a few plays
later.
But on the drive after the 64-yarder,
Dayne again looked surprisingly human, far

from the Heisman-deserving superstar Stan-'
ford expected. In fact, it wasn't until the
fourth quarter, when Wisconsin put itself
ahead by eight points on a well-executed
eight-play, 40-yard drive, that Dayne seemed
in control of the game.
The point? The game was less about Wis
consin's offense and Dayne, and more about
a stunning performance by a Stanford de
fense that was able to find a touch of redemp
tion in the 17-9 loss.
And even head coach Barry Alvarez was.
able to hint at that after the game.
"I don't think anyone thought it would be
a defensive struggle," he said. "But it was." •'
