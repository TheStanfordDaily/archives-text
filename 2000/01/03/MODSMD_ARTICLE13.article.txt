# Even dislocated wrist can't sideline Walters

### Ben Freda Editorial staff 
PASADENA. Calif. — Any
time you take away a team's top play
er, it will make a difference in a game.
But if you take away two top players?
Things start to look very different.
And after senior flanker Troy
Walters landed hard on his bent wrist
last Tuesday in practice, Stanford was
facing exactly that possibility — a
frightening proposition that the team
somehow narrowly averted.
Stanford could have been without
both Walters and senior defensive
lineman Willie Howard, who had
been a huge playmakcr all season and
was perhaps the most important de
fensive reason the Cardinal had
made it to the Rose Bowl.
Howard injured his knee in the
Cardinal's game against Notre
Dame. Doctors said he would proba
bly have to miss the Rose Bowl.
Playing without Howard and Wal
ters looked like a real possibility, but
the team wasn't ready to throw in the
towel.
"We could have folded several
times this season," senior quarter
back Todd Husak said before the
Rose Bowl. "This is just one more ob
stacle we have to get over as a team."
Husak did seem shaken by the
news, however.
"1 was sick to my stomach," he
said about his reaction to news of
Walters injury. "I was talking to Troy
about a half-hour after he hurt the
wrist, and just the look on his face—
1 would trade places with him in a
heartbeat," he added. "If any player
on this team deserves to play in this
game, it is him. He has put everything
into this season and this team. As a
team, we will just have to go out and
play our best and hope that the young
guys can step it up."
The Cardinals' fortunes were
looking cloudy Tuesday afternoon
after Walters fell on his bent wrist.
"It happened in practice when I
was going up for a pass and a defen

sive back hit me," he said. "I got up
and it was sore and I didn't really
know the extent of it. It wasn't
swollen but it was painful."
By the time doctors had examined
the wrist and determined that it had
been dislocated, Walters was told
that his chances of playing in Satur
day's game were slim.
"It's tough because you work so
hard to get to this point," he said the

dav after the injury. "But I've done so
much in my career that you can't
complain about this. I know other
guys are going to step up and play.
We'll have a good time and we're in
the Rose Bowl.
Walters tried to put as positive a
spin on the situation as possible.
"1 want to go into coaching after I
play, so this might be a good time to
go into the box and help [offensive

coordinator Bill] Diedrick call plays,"
he said on Wednesday.
But Walters' next sentence belied
that he was still hoping to play.
"I guess there's a possibility that I
could play a play," he conceded.
Walters had to wear a cast on his
right arm Saturday and was under
doctor's orders to not carry the ball
with it. The instructions limited Wal
ters' involvement in the Cardinal's of

fensive attack, but he ran patterns in
many of the team's plays and finished
with three catches for 54 yards.
As for I toward, it was announced
only on the final day of practice —
Thursday, two days before the Rose
Bowl — that the defensive specialist
would be playing.
1 loward was eager to contribute
any way he could.
"If I can get in for just two plays.

then I will give it 1(H) percent and play
my butt off," he said.
Howard played most of the game
and finished with two tackles and'
three assists.
The Cardinal may have lost, but
who knows how badly it could have
been if Walters and Howard had not
been involved. One hundred percent
or not. the team was visibly pumped
by their teammates return.
