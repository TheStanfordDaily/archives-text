# Penn State knocks off Cardinal in Hawaii for national title
## Stanford one win short of paradise 
### Emily Cadei Ellie Ritch Contributing writers 
HONOLULU — There was no
storybook ending for the Stanford
women's volleyball team this time.

After an outstanding NCAA tourna
ment run in which it defeated Florida
Atlantic, Santa Clara, No. IN Ari
zona. No. 8 UC-Santa Barbara, and
No. 6 Long Beach State, the No. 2
Cardinal inexplicably self-destructed

in the championship match, falling to
No. 1 Penn State, 15-2. 15-10.15-7 on
Dec. IS in I lonolulu.
The loss — which head coach Don
Shaw deemed "a total breakdown,"
was a bitterly disappointing end to

an otherwise outstanding season, but
overall the year was a triumph as the
Cardinal (31-3) reestablished itself as
one of the elite teams in the nation.

What was expected to be an excit
ing and closely contested champi
onship match turned out to be noth
ing of the sort, as the Cardinal came
out nervous and out-of-syne and was
never able to regain its composure.
Penn State, on the other hand, played
composed and confidently from the
start, and its hunger to win the team's
first national championship after los
ing in the finals for the past two years
was evident.
The Nittany Lions* (36-1) early
aggressive play helped them capital

momentum in their favor. Led by an
outstanding trio of seniors — All-

and outside hitter Carrie Schonveld

Nittany Lions, up 8-0 at one point,

After losing the opening game,

With all its major offensive
threats tallying negative hitting per
centages, the Cardinal morale grew
consistently smaller as the match
went on. With each Penn State kill or
block, one could almost visibly see
the Nittany Lions confidence swell
and the Cardinal's shrink. Although
Stanford put up a fight in game two,
it was not enough to turn the tide, as
Penn State won 15-10.
With the momentum clearly on its
side and its opponent on the ropes,
Penn State went up 11-6 in game
three. Although Stanford mounted
some resistance, it couldn't put to

play to regain its confidence or pre

As the shell-shocked Stanford
players and most of the crowd
looked on in disbelief, Penn State
rushed to the middle of the court to
celebrate its national championship.
A key statistic that reflected the
nature of the Cardinal's collapse was
its negative hitting percentage as a
team. Shaw summed up the sheer ab
normality of this occurrence, saying
"I don't think we've ever hit negative
for a match. Period." The cause for
this offensive breakdown can be at
tributed in part to simple lack of exe
cution and chronic passing woes, but
the suffocating defense of Penn State
can also be given much of the credit.
It seemed impossible that this
Stanford team playing in the finals
could be the same squad that just two
nights before had dismantled de
fending champion Long Beach State
(31-4). Against the 49ers in the semi
finals, the Cardinal offense was hit
ting on all cylinders, with recently
named Ail-Americans Walsh firing
off jump serves and Tom pounding a
career-high 27 kills.
Stanford came out energetic and
aggressive in the first game to battle
for a 15-10 win. Despite struggling
some in the second in a tight, back

and-forth game, the Cardinal was
able to pull it out with a late run,
again 15-10. The third game was all

close out the 49ers, went up 13-0 be

The key to the game, Shaw point

error-free execution. Walsh, proving
why she deserved NCAA Co-Player
of the Year honors, notched 14 kills
and eight digs and provided leader
ship and energy on the court.
Junior setter Lindsay Kagawa
also had a big night with 54 assists, as
did freshman outside hitter Lindsey
Yamasaki. who racked up 13 kills as

HONOLULU — There was no
storybook ending for the Stanford
women's volleyball team this time.

After an outstanding NCAA tourna
ment run in which it defeated Florida
Atlantic, Santa Clara, No. IN Ari
zona. No. 8 UC-Santa Barbara, and
No. 6 Long Beach State, the No. 2
Cardinal inexplicably self-destructed

in the championship match, falling to
No. 1 Penn State, 15-2. 15-10.15-7 on
Dec. IS in I lonolulu.
The loss — which head coach Don
Shaw deemed "a total breakdown,"
was a bitterly disappointing end to

an otherwise outstanding season, but
overall the year was a triumph as the
Cardinal (31-3) reestablished itself as
one of the elite teams in the nation.

What was expected to be an excit

ing of the sort, as the Cardinal came
out nervous and out-of-syne and was
never able to regain its composure.
Penn State, on the other hand, played
composed and confidently from the
start, and its hunger to win the team's
first national championship after los

was evident.
The Nittany Lions* (36-1) early

and outside hitter Carrie Schonveld
Penn State never let the Cardinal
