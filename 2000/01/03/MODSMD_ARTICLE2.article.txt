HONOLULU — There was no
storybook ending for the Stanford
women's volleyball team this time.

No. 6 Long Beach State, the No. 2
Cardinal inexplicably self-destructed

in the championship match, falling to
No. 1 Penn State, 15-2. 15-10.15-7 on
Dec. IS in I lonolulu.
The loss — which head coach Don
Shaw deemed "a total breakdown,"
was a bitterly disappointing end to

an otherwise outstanding season, but
overall the year was a triumph as the
Cardinal (31-3) reestablished itself as
one of the elite teams in the nation.

first national championship after los

was evident.

aggressive play helped them capital

outstanding trio of seniors — All-
America middle blocker Lauren
Cacciamani, setter Bonnie Bremner
and outside hitter Carrie Schonveld
Penn State never let the Cardinal
get in the game.
The tone of the match was set in
game one. with Stanford struggling
on offense and making uncharacter
istic unforced errors. Most signifi
cantly. the Cardinal's passing game
completely broke down, leading to
poor hitting opportunities. The Car
