While the rest of the world cel
ebrated the turn of the millenni
um. the Stanford community lost
one its members in an unforesee
able tragedy as assistant wrestling
coach I'od Surmon, Class of 1996,
suffered a fatal accident while cel
ebrating New Year's Eve in l.as
Vegas.
Surmon fell to his death from a
30-foot light pole, after being
electrocuted while steadying him
self on two wires running from the
pole.
Fresh off a come-from-behind
win at the Midlands Champi
onship. a collegiate-style
wrestling event in Evanston, 111.,
Surmon, an all-American at Stan
ford and Olympic hopeful, had
flown directly from Chicago to
Las Vegas for the New Year's fes
tivities.
"He had planned on going to
I .as Vegas all along for the millen
nium. and I had planned to go to
the Rose Bowl," said Stanford
head coach Chris Horpel.
"Tod is someone who celebrat
ed life with everything he did. So
knowing that he can be a little bit,
I think, too risky in some of the
things he does, I warned him,
'please be careful in l.as Vegas.'
"He looked at me and smiled
and said, 'You know I won't.' "
Friends of Surmon's and fel
low members of the Stanford ath
letic community remember him
as a fearless risk-taker both on the
mat and off.
"[Surmon) was a risk-taker, a
little bit of an adrenaline junkie,"
said Horpel.
Despite the revelry of New

Year's Eve. those who know Sur
mon doubt that alcohol was a fac
tor in the accident.
"He was a fearless individual."
said teammate and fellow ail-
American Beau Weiner. [but] he
wasn't a big drinker or big boozer.
He wasn't a guy who would do
stupid things."
Surmon's daring spirit carried
him on the wrestling mat during
his Stanford career and as his
competitive career has continued.
He won the University's Jake
Gambel award, given annually to
the athlete with the best competi
tive spirit.
In his final season, Surmon re
bounded from a potentially debil
itating injury to record an unde
feated season, losing only in the
NCAA tournament to the even
tual champion in a controversial
decision.
At the Midlands Champi
onship he wrestled Steve Black
ford from Arizona State, winning
the match in dramatic fashion,
rallying in the final seconds to win
by one point.
"He was just really stoked, ec
static," said Horpel.
For Horpel. the loss of Surmon
is the second tragedy in four
years. He lost another assistant
coach in 1996 when former
Olympic wrestler Dave Schultz
was gunned down by John E.
DuPont in a widely-publicized
murder in suburban Phildelphia.
"So this is the second wrestler
in a four-year period that's been
killed," Horpel said. "I'm just
starting to wonder what it is. It's
been a heartbreaking time."
Surmon is survived by his par
ents, Dave and Linda Surmon of
Albany, Ore., and two sisters.
