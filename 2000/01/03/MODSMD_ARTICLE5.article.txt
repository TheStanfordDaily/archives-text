## Stock market expected to climb as Y2K fear fizzles! 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock
market averages powered their way
to record highs as 1999 ended,
despite some lingering worries about
the 2(XX) computer conversion. Now.
with markets worldwide reporting
no major troubles, many analysts
expect stocks to soar anew.
"We could see a new wave of
money coming into the market
based entirely on the good news
about Y2K," said Jim Weiss, deputy
chief investment officer for equities
at State Street Research and Man
agement Co. in Boston.
All major U.S. stock market indi
cators ended 1999 at record highs,
with the Nasdaq composite index

capping a spectacular rise of nearly
K6 percent for the year. The Nasdaq.
Dow Jones industrial average and
the Standard & Poor's S(K) all com
pleted an unprecedented fifth
straight year of double-digit percent
age gains.
Many major world stock market
indicators also are beginning the new
year at all-time highs.
This weekend's smooth sailing on
Y2K removed one obstacle to a con
tinued stock-buying binge.
Market analysts and Y2K gurus
caution that the full impact of the
computer conversion isn't known
yet. and may not be clear for days or
weeks. But weekend tests and early

trading in Asia Monday showed little
evidence of the problems many had
feared.
In New York, banks, stock
exchanges and other financial ser
vices companies said their systems
were fully operational on Saturday
and will be ready for Monday busi
ness. The 4K organizations reporting
to the Financial Services Coordina-;
tion and Communication Center
also includes electronic communica
tions networks, which trade stocks
online, and government securities
dealers.
Overseas, stock exchanges in
Hong Kong and Singapore opened
for trading Monday with no prob

lems reported from the Y2K bug. In
Tokyo, a few brokerages reported
glitches in a record-keeping system
over the weekend, but officials
expected the problem to be fixed
before trading reopens on Japanese
markets on Tuesday. Tokyo markets
were closed Monday for a national
holiday.
The Kuwait Stock Exchange
offered one of the first true tests,
opening for a full trading session on
Sunday. Safaak al-Rukeibi, deputy
general manager, told the Kuwait
News Agency that "all trading oper
ations were normal and there were
no problems whatsoever."
Market officials in Cairo and

Rome also proclaimed their readi
ness for trading this week. That's
good news to market watchers in the
United States, who believe business
es and financial exchanges here are
the best prepared in the world.
"The U.S. and Europe have been
aware of Y2K lor far too long, and
have spent far too much money, to
have left things unchecked," Weiss
said. "Most big systems have been
subjected to three to six months of
testing, and should be more than
ready."
With market enthusiasm running
high, a smooth conversion could pro
vide some extra punch. Weiss added.
"There has been a bit of a cau

tionary approach in the way
investors have allocated nejv
money," he said, citing an influx frf
money into more conservative
money market funds. That coujd
change if investors perceive the suc
cessful conversion to Y2K as reason
♦
to pour money into the buoyarit
stock market.
Year 2(KX) worries weren't the
market's only concern, howevor.
The market's course in early 2()0O
will be determined largely by the
Federal Reserve, which raised inter
est rates three times in 1999 but loft
rates unchanged at its last meeting ()f
the year, saying it wanted to hejp
ensure a smooth transition into Y2K.
