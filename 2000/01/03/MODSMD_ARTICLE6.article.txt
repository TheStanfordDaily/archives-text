## Editorial Stanford is Y2-OK 
### 
Preparation for year
2000 problems was
not done in vain

As many expected, at the
stroke of midnight on
Dec. 31 the much antici
pated Y2K problem came and
wfcnt with little fanfare throughout
tt>e world. Despite dire predictions
from many doomsday pundits, the
so-called millenium hug apparent
lyÂ£ failed to disrupt critical services
ir> even the least technologically
prepared nations.
this is all a testament
to the strength of the Y2K
response or evidence of the hype
surrounding the problem remains
tcj be seen. Nevertheless, the Uni
versity was correct in taking extra
precautions in preparation for this
efent.
!The Y2K Readiness Task Force
sliould be lauded for its organiza

tional efforts in preparing Stanford
for the year 2(XX). The task force
took the situation as seriously as a
major catastrophe, while taking
care to send letters to students and
parents to alleviate any concerns.
The University was also correct
to create contingency plans for stu
dents with delayed travels, includ
ing extending the tuition payment
deadline to Jan. 9 and asking pro
fessors to be lenient with first
week assignments. With many
sold-out and canceled flights on
the first few days of the year, these
measures will definitely be appre
ciated.
Meanwhile, Information Tech
nology Systems and Services com
pleted a 6-year, $6-million effort to
make all Stanford computer sys
tems Y2K compliant. The relative
ease with which this was done
demonstrates our institution's
excellence in technology and indi
cates that we will be on top of
things for years to come.
