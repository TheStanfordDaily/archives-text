Ticket sales mismanaged
The AthPetic Department claims that stu
dents are the most important group of fans
to them, but given how they treat us, that is
really hard to believe.
i called the Athletic Ticket Office the
day before student Rose Bowl tickets went
on sale to ask if it would be possible for my
group of friends to sit together at the game.
The person on the phone told me that we
would as long as we all came in for tickets at
the same time. So we organized our group
the night before and all agreed to get up
early the next morning to get a good place in
line. For some of us, this meant missing 9
a.m. classes, which was worth it for the
chance to sit together at the Rose Bowl.
Naturally, we were very shocked and dis
appointed when we arrived at the Ticket
Office to learn that our group would be split
up and that there was no way we would be
allowed to be together. The ticket line was
divided alphabetically, and only those with
similar last names would get tickets that
were near each other. The reason they did
this was to make the line move faster.
What perplexes me about this whole sit
uation is that it would have been incredibly
easy to make the line move faster, allow
everyone to sit together who wanted to and
still make sure that no one bought multiple
tickets. The most efficient way to do this
would have been a computer or card-swip
ing system.
I am grateful for the $250,000 that the
Athletic Department donated for students,
but I for one would rather have paid full
price for the ticket and still have been able
to sit with my friends.

Promote a sensible expansion
plan
There are many parts of the proposed
Stanford expansion plan which are just fine.

They offer a good approach to growth the
University certainly needs at a pace that is
reasonable.
Other parts focus excessively on short
term needs. In particular, the possible
development of both ends of the foothills is
a real mistake. The present plan, of course,
proposes only that two chunks of the hills
could be developed, but that is the begin
ning of a process that I feel should not hap
pen.
The claims that only a tiny percent of the
land will be developed are misleading, since
the access roads and impact on the charac
ter of the hills will affect far more of the
land than the actual footprints of the build
ings. The nibbling away will quickly (in the
time frame of a university) reduce the char
acter of the hills to something ordinary and
of much diminished value.
Ten years from now, presumably, a new
administration will propose a few more
buildings in the open space, and so it will go.
I think that more buildings and roads in
the foothills are avoidable; room could be
made on the core campus to build equiva
lent facilities that would suffice for years to
come.
Obviously there are tremendous pres
sures to build, but other values should pre
vail at least once in a while. As the peninsu
la moves inexorably toward suburbaniza
tion, the value of a chunk of land so close by
and big enough to be a reasonably natural
ecosystem will be incalculable, for humans
and for wildlife. Stanford people stand to
profit from this the most. A policy of
foothills development is pretty much irre
versible, while preservation of the hills will
never really preclude later development.
Stanford can obviously "succeed" in the
end by gradually encroaching on the hills
until we have just another manicured park
with some nice buildings scattered about. I
would hope that something much more spe
cial will happen, with leadership and vision
from people who anticipate what this
already crowded peninsula will be like in
decades to come. I know that many Univer

sity people share my feelings and are mak
ing a genuine effort to find a good solution,
and I am writing to urge them on.
