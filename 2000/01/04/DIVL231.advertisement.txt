Undergraduate Journal Clubs
Tuesdays 12:05-1:05
Section 1, Exploring Genetic Model Systems, will be a rapid tour of many of the
amazingly diverse organisms that Stanford faculty use as models to study important
biological problems. Our format will be that each week students present a review
and a research paper in a discussion facilitated by a guest faculty member who uses
that system in their own research. The guest faculty will include Chris Somerville
(Arabidopsis), Alfred Sporman (Myxobacteria), William Talbot (Zebrafish), Anne
Villeneuve (C. elegans) and Liqun Luo (Drosophila).
First class: Tuesday, January 4, 2000, Gilbert Room 117
Limited enrollment! Contact Dr. Kristin Black (kblack@leland)
Section 2, Ecological Interactions, will be an introduction to current and historical
research on species interactions in ecological communities. Topics include
competition, predation, mutualism, herbivory, pollination, and multi-species
interactions. Students will read, present, and discuss articles from the primary
literature.
First class: Tuesday, January 4, 2000, Building 420 Room 147
