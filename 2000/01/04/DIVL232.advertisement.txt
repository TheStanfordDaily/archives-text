STANFORD DIALOGUES ON RACE AND ETHNICITY

dialogues in 17 residences. Students majoring in Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity held their own race dialogues last year
because they believed it to be essential to their education, and a
Jewish Arab Muslim dialogue group is entering its second year. The
Office of Multicultural Education hosted a Stanford Dialogue Is
Action conference that brought 75 campus and local community
dialogue leaders together. Through these programs, Stanford
students joined and expanded the national conversation about race
that began when President Clinton launched the President's Race
Initiative in 1997. Hundred of other community groups have held
dialogues around the country.

and collectively identify issues they wish to discuss. Dialogue groups
