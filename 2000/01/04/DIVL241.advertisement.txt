Japanese Society and Culture
Using anthropological literature as a baseline, discusses the problem of knowing
and representing Japanese people, history, and culture. Beginning with a basic
problematizing of any unreflective idea of "Japanese society and culture,"
students are introduced to diverse lives and historically situated experiences to
make them aware of the problems entailed in representation. Student interviews
of Japanese people, ethnographic reports. GER:3b,4a (DH:2 or 9)

of life in the region known commonly as the Middle East. Peoples living in
rural, urban and nomadic settings. Through a close reading of ethnographies and

Introduction to Approaches in Archaeology
Over recent decades, archaeology has seen a vigorous debate about approaches
to interpretation of the past. Why these approaches matter in the contemporary
world: objective scientific universals about cultural development vs. individuals
use of the past to create identities for themselves in the present. Their
application to specific sites and problems: the explosion of symbolism in the
Upper Palaeolithic, the adoption of farming at Catalhoyuk in I\irkey, the
adoption of farming in the New World, the experience of prehistoric
monuments in Europe and N. America, the archaeology of indigenous peoples,
gender archaeology, internet archaeology. GER:3b

Asian American Immigration and Health
Employing a critical medical anthropological approach, focus is on the
experience and meanings of illness for Asian immigrants newly arrived in the
U.S. Beginning with a study of immigrants as a feared source of disease and
contagion, issues of power, race, and nationhood in the ideology and practice of
biomedicine. The immigrant's navigation of the U.S. health care system and the
attribution of culture in the construction of the sick. Topics: post-traumatic stress
disorder, AIDS, culture bound syndrome, risk assessment and preventative health.
