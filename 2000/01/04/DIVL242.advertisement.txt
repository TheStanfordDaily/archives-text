A Message from Phi Beta Kappa, Stanford Chapter
Phi Beta Kappa is a nationwide society honoring students for the excellence and breadth of their undergraduate
scholarly accomplishments. Membership in the Stanford Chapter (Beta of California) is open to undergraduates
of all majors. To be elected to Phi Beta Kappa at Stanford, a student mast achieve academic distinction in the
major as well as in courses across a broad range of fields.
Approximately a tenth of the members of a graduating class are elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Of this number, about
one fifth are chosen in their junior year, the remainder in their senior year.
The Chapter's election guidelines (revised July, 1997) define "breadth" of study as excellence beyond the major
field. To be considered for election, a student must have taken, by the time elections are held early in the Spring
Quarter, at least three courses in each of the following three major domains of knowledge: Humanities; Science,
Engineering and Math; and Social Sciences. To be considered for election, transfer students must have taken at
least two courses at Stanford in two of these major domains and must have completed a minimum of 75 units of
academic work at Stanford by the end of Winter Quarter.
Examples of courses that will satisfy the Phi Beta Kappa breadth criterion include those listed in the BULLETIN
for the undergraduate General Education Requirements (GER) in Areas 2 to 4. Courses taken for GER Area 1
will not be considered as satisfying the PBK breadth criterion.
Agradeof'V or'CR" is not considered a sign of distinction. Minimally satisfying the "breadth" criterion is not
considered a sign of distinction.
The academic records of all students are automatically reviewed, so no special action is required for students
wishing to be considered for membership. Anonymity in the election process is ensured by removal of students'
names from their academic records before consideration. Students who desire that their records not be made
available for consideration by the Stanford chapter of Phi Beta Kappa should inform the Registrar, room 133, Old
Union.
