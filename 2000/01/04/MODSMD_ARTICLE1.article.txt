# Gingrich holds question-answer session with SIG
## 
### Alice Brown Editorial staff 
Former Speaker of the House
Newt Gingrich gave a Dead Week
talk at the Hoover Institution to a
group of about 20 Stanford in Gov
ernment members.
Gingrich spent the majority of
his two hours with SIG answering
questions from students and fin
ished his time by speaking about
the necessity of dramatically im
proving the quality of elementary
education.
Students took turns asking ques
tions on topics including Gingrich's
opinion on the upcoming presiden
tial race and what he believes the
most important issues of the future
will be.
Before launching into his an
swers of these questions and
dozens of others. Gingrich spoke
about his time as speaker of the
house — both the actual experi
ence and his perspectives two years
out of office.
While speaking about his time as
speaker, Gingrich detailed how he
led the first Republican majority in
40 years, describing the Contract
with America as his management
document.
He called himself "the most
public speaker of the house ever"
and described the Republican ma
jority as "policy driven." He said
the Republicans created an agenda
and followed through on it.
Gingrich attributed the accep
tance of this agenda to a "weak
presidency in 1995." He said Presi
dent Bill Clinton decided that re

election was worth accepting the
Republican agenda.
Gingrich said he worked 100
hours a week on average as speak
er. It is "unbelievably hard to lead
at that level," he said, and he admits
he made mistakes — and made
them "too much."
"Every day 1 was drowning be
cause of the way the system works,"
Gingrich said. He described his job
as "very exhilarating, but very tir
ing."
He called the government shut
down of the winter of 1995-96 one
of the miscues. "It hurt us," he said.
"On the other hand, it cut $3 billion
out of federal spending."
Gingrich emphasized the diffi
culty of his job. explaining that "ac
tually getting something done is
enormously hajd. ... If something
was easy, somebody else had al
ready done it."
Gingrich credits his success to a
specific "leadership model." the
key to his "planning model." "Lis
ten, learn, help and lead," are the
keys words of the leadership
model, and the planning model
consists of "vision, strategy, pro
jects and tactics."
"I have zero doubt that it
works," he said.
Gingrich said the legislature is
much harder to organize than the
executive branch, due to thj num
ber of people involved in it.
"1 was an effective leader as long
as I could convince people that I
was the head coach." Gingrich said.
The second main difference, ac
cording to Gingrich, is that the
news media is triggered to the

White House. "The media asks
Congress dumb questions," Gin
grich said. In addition, he said that
the president gets constant news
coverage, while this is not true of
the legislative leader.
Gingrich called the Monica
Lewinsky scandal — a time of im
mense media scrutiny of the presi
dent — ail "astonishing moment in
American history." He referred to
Clinton as "one of the smartest
men ever to be president — one
who could've accomplished amaz
ing things. He should've stayed fo
cused."
Gingrich cited the most amazing
part of the whole situation as the in
tensity of the coverage of Indepen

dent Counsel Kenneth Starr's re
port. "The public reaction
would've been different had the
Starr report been handled differ
ently."
Social security reform topped
his list of issues for the future.
"Your generation should be
screaming about social security."
he said. "Social security is a '35
Chevy."
Gingrich called the reform of el
ementary and adolescent educa
tion equally crucial. He said the
present system is currently in a cri
sis.
"We're not going to be leading
the planet with one more genera
tion of education under the current

vision." he said. " The models we've
inherited need to he replaced."
Gingrich offered only a brief po
litical prediction. 1 le predicted that
although Bill Bradley is presenting
stiff competition, Al Gore will
probably win the Democratic nom
ination for president and that
George Bush will be the Republi
can nominee.
If this is the case, Gingrich
guesses that Bush will win 60 per
cent of the vote and Gore 40 per
cent.
Now that he is out of office Gin
grich said lie is having the "time of
his life. 1 don't need to be back in
power, but if 1 had to, I'd do it
again."
