## Editorial A 						successful season 
### 
Many factors combined to
make this a memorable
year for Stanford foootball

Though the Cardinal did not
top Wisconsin at the Rose
Bowl, the experience
shared there this past weekend hy
the players, coaches and fans will
not soon be forgotten.
A special thanks should be
given to the Athletic Department
for subsidizing student tickets. If
they had not decided to offer stu
dents tickets at a reduced price of
$55 from the original price of
$115, many fans might not have
been able to partake in the New
Year's festivities in Pasadena.
That Stanford sold all of its
allotted tickets to the game is a
testament to the loyalty of Stan
ford fans to the football team.
Though Wisconsin is renowned
for the dedication of its fans to the
team, the Stanford community
could be heard cheering as loudly
as the Badger fans throughout the
game.
Ihe students, faculty and alum
ni who trekked to Pasadena on a
holiday weekend to support the
Cardinal in its attempt to win the
Rose Bowl deserve a hardy thanks
for their dedication.
The Band, yell leaders. Dollies
and Tree were invaluable in their
rallying of support for the team
before and during the game. If the

cheering of Stanford fans waned
at any point during the game,
these spirited people all immedi
ately stepped up to motivate them
again.
The football team and staff,
though, deserve the hardiest con
gratulations and thanks. Without
their extraordinary efforts this
season, Stanford's appearance in
the Rose Bowl would have
remained an unfulfilled goal, and
another team would have faced
Wisconsin. The decision of
both Troy Walters and Willie
Howard to play despite injuries
that might have kept them on the
sidelines demonstrates how dedi
cated the team was to fulfilling
their dreams. Their perserverence
exemplifies the spirit of a football
team that was picked for the Pacif
ic 10 Conference's basement
before the season.
The season should not be
remembered for the Rose Bowl
loss. It should be remembered as
the season of surprises and suc
cess. Who would have predicted
that after an embarrassing first
game loss of 69-17 to Texas that
the Cardinal would rebound to be
Pac-10 champions and that they
would make an appearance in the
famed Rose Bowl?
Many congratulations to coach
Tyrone Willingham and his team
on a successful season. We look
forward to cheering them on next
fall.
