£ ~"W"~ "T"ey Mike, want
I Itogo to Vegas
.JL JLagain next
year?" my friend asked me.
I spent New Year's Eve
1998 in Las Vegas. Though
it was fun running around
the streets of Vegas with a

box of Fran/ia on my back and watching
people stage dive 20 feet from a statue of
Caesar and his horse, it was not something I
was sure 1 wanted to do again — especially
after a hangover-ridden five- hour drive back
home.
My decision was sealed after I heard
about the prices that hotels were trying to
charge. Our off-strip hotel (a wholly unim
pressive place), which had charged $2(X) for
the night of New Year's Eve 1998 and $50 for
the night before was now charging $350 a
night with a three-night minimum stay for
New Year's Eve 1999. And 1 would have had
to pay $2(X) to stay at the Excalibur with 12
other people in a single hotel room, where I
was guaranteed sleeping quarters some
where between the toilet and the shower.
So when a friend graciously (and perhaps
stupidly) offered his parentless home in
Southern California for New Year's festivi
ties this year, I sprung on it.
And most people did the same thing.
When I got home and had the chance to read
the Los Angeles Times cover to cover (for
lack of better things to do), I was happy to
see Las Vegas packages getting cheaper
every day as hotels were still half-empty. The
Circus Circus, which was initially charging

$450 a night with a three-night minimum
stay, had reduced its prices out of despera
tion to $149 a night with a two-night mini
mum stay. And I don't even think anyone
was taking that.
And similar happenings occurred for
music concerts. Jimmy Buffett had originally
attempted to charge $1,5(X) per ticket for a
seat at his Universal Amphitheater "Millen
nium Concert." By mid-December, when
the concert was less than half sold, the tickets
were reduced to $50() (still completely ridicu
lous). It really felt as though Jimmy had
taken advantage of his fans by extorting
them so they could have the ultimate turn-of
the-millennium experience.
The Jewel Alaska concert was a big flop,
too. ITiough she was only charging $50 per
ticket (which apparently is very expensive
for a concert in Alaska), her hometown audi
ence was unwilling to pay, and she ended up
canceling.
Hotels and concert promoters knew that
everyone wanted to have an unforgettable
experience at the turn of the millennium, and
they tried to make everyone pay for it.
Though some may claim that fear of Y2K
(which did inspire the ingenious marketing
ploy by the Stanford Athletic department
that helped our team to be Pac-10 champs)
and terrorist threats kept people at home, I
really think that people just weren't willing
to pay for their millennium memories. I
wasn't, and neither was almost everyone I
knew as they elected to go to dozens of small
parties spread over Southern California (in
preparation for the Rose Bowl, of course).

This behavior even led a friend of mine to'
claim that the new millennium's greatest'
movement is the "transfer from regionalized)
to localized parties."
And my localized party yielded perhaps'
the best New Year's I ever had. 1 was quite
toasted on quality alcohol by 9 p.m. and was*
in charge of an excellent fireworks show pur--,
chased by myself for $ 14.95 on the side of the!
highway. t
There were minor problems. For reasons!
beyond explanation, I did end the evening*
with a hairless chest and bruises from
and sliding across the main hallway's tile*
floor. And I did get to hear a cacophony of ,
snoring as 1 fell asleep on the floor of my 1
friend's parents' master bedroom.
But besides these issues and the future \
embarrassment of walking to the bathroom J
with a stubbly chest, being at a 30-person '
party was much better than anything else
could have been, at a fraction of the cost.
And we were a short one hour to the Rose ■
Bowl (which was still not the most enjoyable
drive at 10 a.m. the next day). i
In an America of growing consumerism,
the commercial Hop of the new millennium
was a "screw you" to everyone who thought
that people were willing to pay anything for
a memory. Go us.

Mike Rosenbluth commends our football
team for playing a hard-fought, close game.
He looks forward to Corey Griffin's in-depth
analysis of school spirit and the Rose Howl
tomorrow.
