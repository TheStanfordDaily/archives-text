■ Dec. 4-5: Stanford finishes second
at the NCAA championship tourna
ment.

This marks the second year in a
row that the national championship
has eluded Stanford; the Cardinal lost
to USC by one goal in 1998. But in
spite of the heartbreak. Stanford
coach Dante Dettamanti praised his
team after the loss.
"I'm proud of the fact that we
were able to return to the final after
losing five seniors [including three
All-Americans from the 1998 team]."
Dettamanti said. "That's really a tes
tament to our returning players and
our new players."
After last year's disappointing
overtime loss. Stanford jumped out to
a two-goal first-half lead. But the Car
dinal couldn't stop UCLA's Sean
Kern, as he scored three of his four
points in the second half to lead the
Bruins to victory.
The Cardinal got on the board first
as senior Andy Walburger put in the
rebound of a man-up shot. The Bru
ins responded with a goal by junior
holeman Kern on the next posses
sion.
But Stanford regained momen
tum as freshman Peter Hudnut made
a two-point goal, giving Stanford a 3-
1 lead with two minutes to go in the
first quarter.
The second quarter was marked
by the fine play of the Stanford bench.
With four minutes to go. redshirt
sophomore Mark Amott drew a four

meter penalty against the Bruins.
With senior Brian Heifferon rest
ing on the bench, the duties of taking
the penalty shot were handed to
freshman Jeff Nesmith. The fresh
man converted, silencing the Bruins'
fans.
As the clock ran down in the half,
junior Adam Wright was able to con
vert a man-up opportunity for the
Bruins. However, as the teams went
to the locker rooms, the Cardinal held
a commanding 4-2 lead.
While the story of the first half was
Cardinal scoring, Stanford's offense
seemed to disappear in the second
half.

"We played good defense, led by
[goalie] Nick [Ellis]," Dettamanti
said. "But Kern beat us and we
couldn't score enough goals."
Kern was indeed hard to stop.
Two minutes into the third period, he
scored on a backhanded wet shot to
narrow Stanford's lead to one. Two
minutes later, with a man-up advan
tage, Kern found the net once again
to tic the score at four.
A surprising shot from UCLA se
nior Matt Armato with one second
left in the third period gave the Bruins
their first lead and changed the
game's momentum. Two minutes
into the final quarter. Kern scored his

fourth point of the game, putting the
Bruins up by two.
Still, Stanford was not ready to
give up. A minute later, with a man
up advantage, redshirt sophomore
Pasi Dutton scored off a pass from
Nesmith, closing the gap to one.
It was time for last-minute Cardi
nal heroics, and Stanford had many
chances.
The Cardinal managed a few shots
on goal, including a final skip shot by
Heifferon, but none found the net.
"The story of the game was that
we really had trouble scoring in the
second half," Dettamanti said.
The most telling statistic was that

Cardinal players were ejected eight
times to three ejections for UCLA.
While the Bruins converted only
two of those eight man-up opportuni
ties, the numerous Cardinal ejections
tired the players and made it difficult
for the offense to get going in the sec
ond half.
Just earning the right to face the
Bruins in the final was difficult.
After watching UCLA easily de
feat Massachusetts 14-6 in the first
semifinal, Stanford took on UC-San
Diego in a game that most expected
the Cardinal to win.
Yet the Triton players weren't
ready to just hand the match to Stan

ford — Sati Diego jumped out to a 3-
0 lead, electrifying the home crowd.
Battling back at the end of the first
period and the opening of the second,
the Cardinal closed the gap with man
up and two-point goals of it's own hy
Walburger and senior Jon Skaalcn
respectively. But the Tritons man
aged two more goals to Stanford's
one. giving San Diego a 5-4 advan
tage at the half.
After the ( ardinal's sluggish start,
the second half was all Stanford.
As the third quarter opened. Lip
inski drew an ejection and Skaalen
was ahle to convert his second two
point goal of the game, giving Stan
ford its first lead.
After managing only four points in
the first half, the (Cardinal scored four
more times in the third period, with
goals from 1 leifferon. Amott, Ne
smith and Hudnut. A skip shot by
Pasi Dutton in the fourth quarter pro
duced a final score of 11 -7.

coach Denny Harper particularly
praised the play of Skaalen. saying.
"Jon's two two-pointers |which tied
an NCAA Tournament record for

in a hard-fought and exciting match.

MEN'S WATER POLO
■ Dec. 4-5: Stanford finishes second
at the NCAA championship tourna
ment.

This marks the second year in a
row that the national championship
has eluded Stanford; the Cardinal lost
to USC by one goal in 1998. But in
spite of the heartbreak. Stanford
coach Dante Dettamanti praised his
team after the loss.
"I'm proud of the fact that we
were able to return to the final after
losing five seniors [including three
All-Americans from the 1998 team]."
Dettamanti said. "That's really a tes
tament to our returning players and
our new players."
After last year's disappointing
overtime loss. Stanford jumped out to
a two-goal first-half lead. But the Car
dinal couldn't stop UCLA's Sean
Kern, as he scored three of his four
points in the second half to lead the
Bruins to victory.
The Cardinal got on the board first
as senior Andy Walburger put in the
rebound of a man-up shot. The Bru
ins responded with a goal by junior
holeman Kern on the next posses
sion.
But Stanford regained momen
tum as freshman Peter Hudnut made
a two-point goal, giving Stanford a 3-
1 lead with two minutes to go in the
first quarter.
The second quarter was marked
by the fine play of the Stanford bench.
With four minutes to go. redshirt
sophomore Mark Amott drew a four

meter penalty against the Bruins.
With senior Brian Heifferon rest
ing on the bench, the duties of taking
the penalty shot were handed to
freshman Jeff Nesmith. The fresh
man converted, silencing the Bruins'
fans.
As the clock ran down in the half,
junior Adam Wright was able to con
vert a man-up opportunity for the
Bruins. However, as the teams went
to the locker rooms, the Cardinal held
a commanding 4-2 lead.
While the story of the first half was
Cardinal scoring, Stanford's offense
seemed to disappear in the second
half.

"We played good defense, led by
[goalie] Nick [Ellis]," Dettamanti
said. "But Kern beat us and we
couldn't score enough goals."
Kern was indeed hard to stop.
Two minutes into the third period, he
scored on a backhanded wet shot to
narrow Stanford's lead to one. Two
minutes later, with a man-up advan
tage, Kern found the net once again
to tic the score at four.
A surprising shot from UCLA se
nior Matt Armato with one second
left in the third period gave the Bruins
their first lead and changed the
game's momentum. Two minutes
into the final quarter. Kern scored his

fourth point of the game, putting the
Bruins up by two.
Still, Stanford was not ready to
give up. A minute later, with a man
up advantage, redshirt sophomore
Pasi Dutton scored off a pass from
Nesmith, closing the gap to one.
It was time for last-minute Cardi
nal heroics, and Stanford had many
chances.
The Cardinal managed a few shots
on goal, including a final skip shot by
Heifferon, but none found the net.
"The story of the game was that
we really had trouble scoring in the
second half," Dettamanti said.
The most telling statistic was that

Cardinal players were ejected eight
times to three ejections for UCLA.
While the Bruins converted only
two of those eight man-up opportuni
ties, the numerous Cardinal ejections
tired the players and made it difficult
for the offense to get going in the sec
ond half.
Just earning the right to face the
Bruins in the final was difficult.
After watching UCLA easily de
feat Massachusetts 14-6 in the first
semifinal, Stanford took on UC-San
Diego in a game that most expected
the Cardinal to win.
Yet the Triton players weren't
ready to just hand the match to Stan

ford — Sati Diego jumped out to a 3-
0 lead, electrifying the home crowd.
Battling back at the end of the first
period and the opening of the second,
the Cardinal closed the gap with man
up and two-point goals of it's own hy
Walburger and senior Jon Skaalcn
respectively. But the Tritons man
aged two more goals to Stanford's
one. giving San Diego a 5-4 advan
tage at the half.
After the ( ardinal's sluggish start,
