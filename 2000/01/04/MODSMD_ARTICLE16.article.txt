# Men stay atop hoops ranks with dominant wins
## 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
College basketball rankings don't
mean much in December and Janu
ary. The bruising conference season
and the NCAA Tournament still lie
in the distance, ready and willing to
wreak havoc with a team's highest as

pi rat ions.
But for Stanford (11-O), which be
came the No. I team in the nation for
the first time ever while picking up six
relatively easy wins over the break,
the early-season rankings have taken
on a bigger significance than ever —
even if head coach Mike Mont
gomery doesn't like to .idmit it.

"We're No. 1 because the right
people lost and we didn't," he said.
"It's just a number until the end of the
season."
Stanford has risen to such un
precedented heights by doing what it
has always done in Montgomery's 13-
plus seasons at the helm: defending
hard and playing as a team.
Two stats tell the tale of the Cardi
nal season so far: Stanford's sixth man
leads the team in scoring with less
than 13 points a game, and the team
leads the nation in opponents' field
goal percentage, holding foes to 30
percent shooting.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Winter Kreak: No. 1 Stanford de
feats Georgia Tech. Nevada, Sacra
mento State, Mississippi State, New
Hampshire and Davidson.

And it has done the majority of the
work without its top player and only
returning starter from last season, se
nior forward Mark Madsen. who re
turned from a thigh injury Dec. 29
against New Hampshire to play for
the first time since the season opener.
After just barely beating Georgia
Tech, 64-61, in overtime in Atlanta,
and disposing of Nevada. Sacramen
to State and Mississippi State, the
Cardinal welcomed Madsen back for
easy wins over the Wildcats and
Davidson at the Stanford Invitation
al.
Madsen was not back to his usual
"Mad Dog" self just yet, but he still
managed to put up eight points
against New Hampshire and 13
against Davidson. In the latter game,
he also pulled down a team-high eight
rebounds.
"He just needs to get comfort
able," Montgomery said. "He needs
to get back his recklessness. Of
course, considering he hasn't played
in seven weeks, he's looking good."
While Madsen was finding his way
back, others took up the slack.
Junior Ryan Mcndez threw in 18

points on 8-of-12 shooting to lead the
blowout of Davidson (4-5) on Dec.
30. Freshman Casey Jacobsen, Stan
ford's stellar sixth man who averages
a team-high 12.9 points per game,
added 15.
Against New Hampshire, Jacob
sen put up a season-high 26 points
and junior Jarron Collins, second on
the team in scoring with 12.4, chipped
in 19. Sophomore point guard Tony
Giovacchini scored a career-high 14
after hitting all five of his shots, four
of which were three-pointers.
Playing its first game as the top
ranked team in the country, Stanford
cruised to a 20-point victory over Mis
sissippi State in Oakland at the Pete
Newell Challenge, named for Cali
fornia's legendary former coach.
The Cardinal had only a six-point
lead over the Bulldogs at halftime,
but established control with a 15-0
run in the middle of the second half.
Bolstered by four blocks from
freshman Curtis Borchardt. who is
rapidly creeping up in the school's
record books. Stanford recorded a
school-record 12 blocks.
Senior David Moseley scored 22
points on 8-for-l 1 shooting, while Jar
ron Collins added 16 points and a
team-high 10 rebounds.
The Cardinal ascended to the top
spot after polishing off Sacramento
State 78-56 on Dec. 18. Stanford
looked troubled by the Hornets' full
court defense at the outset of the
game.
However, after calming down, the
Cardinal blew open the game in the
second half with stellar shooting from
the outside.
But the emphatic victory wasn't
what pushed Stanford to the top. In
stead, the real difference-maker was
previously-No. 1 Cincinnati's loss to
Xavier as the Cardinal watched on
television.
Against Georgia Tech earlier in
the month at the Yellow Jackets'
Philips Arena home, Stanford looked
decidedly unlike the top team in the

country. The Cardinal shot only 3\
percent from the field as Georgia
Tech pounded the ball down low to
Jason Collier, who posted a game
high 17 points, and Alvin Jones, who
added 10 points and 15 rebounds.
While Montgomery said Jones
and Collier played the Cardinal "to a
standoff down low." Stanford's back
court had trouble picking lip the
slack, allowing the Yellow Jackets to
remain in the game.
Tech's Tony Akins sent the game
to overtime with a three-pointer with
one second in regulation and had a

chance to tic the game in overtime as
well. However. Akins lavup would
not fall and Collier's follow up also
rolled off the rim, giving Stanford the
win after Jarron ('ollins added a free
throw with .03 seconds remaining.
Like the Cardinal's overtime vic
tory over Duke in the season opener
and its close win over Auburn. Stan
ford did what «t had to do to beat
Georgia lech
"We've made big plays when we
had to." Montgomer\ said. "We've
been better at the end of games."
So far.at least.
