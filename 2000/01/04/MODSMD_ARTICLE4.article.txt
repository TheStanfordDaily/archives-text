In an effort to boost advanced
research laboratories at Stanford,
the Howard Hughes Medical In
stitute awarded a $1.6 million
grant to the School of Medicine
last month.
According to Hughes Institute
President Purnell Choppin. the in
stitute's grant, part of a $92 million
package given to 41 schools across
the country, represents an effort
to strengthen research capabilities
at medical schools in a climate
where funding for research is
dwindling due to managed care
and various other factors.
"Medical schools are where a
great many of the most important
biomedical advances occur, yet
they are being squeezed by the
growth of managed care, new gov
ernment policies and other
changes," Choppin said in a press
release.
"These resources will help
medical schools to maintain the
critical basic and clinical research
facilities, purchase major equip
ment and foster collaborations
among basic scientists and clinical
researchers," he added.
The grant, which extends over
four years, will allow the Medical
School to support its existing re
search facilities by creating new
high-end labs. The labs will em
ploy cutting-edge techniques in
cluding monoclonal antibodies,
transgenic and "knockout" mice
DNA micro arrays.
â€¢ Dr. Harry Greenberg, senior
associate dean for research at the
Medical School, said the labs will
work with a diverse range of re
searchers to facilitate their current
investigations.
"We are extremely grateful to
the Hughes Institute," Greenberg
said in the release.
Greenberg also mentioned
that John Boothroyd, the chair of
the Microbiology Deparment at
Stanford, headed the committee
that in part responsible for
writing the grant. "He's the one
who deserves all the credit."
