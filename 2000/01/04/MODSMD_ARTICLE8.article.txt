## Clinton mediates peace talks for Israel and Syria 
### 
SHEPHERDSTOWN. W.Va.
(AF) — President Bill Clinton
brought Israel and Syria back to the
peace table Monday for the second
time in less than a month, but the
two antagonists failed to meet face
to-face.
Clinton did meet separately with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa. as did Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright. The
only face-to-face meeting between
the Israeli and the Syrian was at a
picture-taking session with the
president.
A source close to the Syrian del
egation said there was disagree
ment over the timing of discussions
on an Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan Heights — at the beginning
of the talks, as Syria wanted, or at
the end, which Israel preferred.
Barak, before coming here, cau
tioned that Israel could not negoti
ate a withdrawal without first tak
ing up with Syria the kind of peace
President I lafcz Assad was offering
as well as security arraangements
on the two countries' borders.
But an Israeli source, insisting
on anonymity, told The Associated
Press that Barak was calling on all
parties to take steps needed for the
process to move forward.
"The procedure and the sub
stance are wrapped together at this
,stage in the discussion," said State
Department spokesman James
Rubin. "They have not agreed on a
work plan yet."
i Even before the talks began.

administration officials were play
ing down the possibility that 50
years of differences would be
resolved during this round of talks.
Protests in Syria served as a stark
reminder of the difficulties the two
sides face.
Among issues on the table are
security — a major worry for Israel
— sharing of water resources, the
extent of Israel's withdrawal from
the strategic Golan Heights, a
timetable for that pullout and the
character of peace between the two
Middle East neighbors.
Asked why an expected three
■way negotiating session did not
occur. White I louse spokesman Joe
Lockhart said the Albright meet
ings went "longer than anticipat
ed."
"The feeling is that these are
very hard issues, that you cannot
have a fully scripted procedure in a
discussion that is complex," Rubin
said. "Today has been serious and
substantive."
I Ie added. "There is not a reluc
tance on either part to have joint
meetings, and the job of the facili
tator here is to try to decide what
the right rhythm amd the pace of
the discussions is."
After Clinton and his team
decided against trying to bring the
two sides together Monday night,
the president held another separate
session with al-Sharaa before
returning to Washington.
Administration officials had
billed the tulks as a "historic oppor
tunity" to end a half-century of hos

tility between the two old foes.
With Mideast peace a top for
eign policy goal for 2000. Clinton
was prepared "to invest as many
days as are appropriate and con
structive" to reach a settlement.
Lockhart said. There was no indica
tion whether h would return to the
talks Tuesday.

On Monday, the president
joined the two Mideast leaders in a
stroll across a 200-foot-long pedes
trian bridge at the National Conser
vation Training Center of the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service.
Afterward, as he leaded for the
main site of the talks, the semi
secluded Clarion Hotel and Con

ference Center, Clinton halted his
motorcade in the town center and
stepped out to greet scores of
cheering residents. He ignored
questions about the negotiations.
Dozens of Israeli and Syrian del
egates have for the first time joined
the talks, enabling the two sides to
address the technical issues before

them.
"What we are hoping to achieve
is to have an opportunity to discuss
all of the ... issues that have not
been discussed face-to-face with
experts in all the areas," Rubin said
at a briefing.
Talks held under U.S. auspices
last month in Washington — the
first after an almost four-year hia
tus — did not go deeply into the
key subjects, but focused on proce
dural issues, the spokesman said.
"In these negotiations, the devil
is in the details,'" he said.
As the talks were under way,
about 50 protesters, mostly univer
sity students, staged a sit-in in Syria
at the offices of the International
Committee of the Red Cross,
denouncing Israel and demanding
the release of Syrian prisoners in
Israeli jails.
"There can be no peace as long
as Israel keeps our men impris
oned," said Maymouna al-Maqet,
whose two brothers have been
jailed in Israel since 1985.
In Israel, former Prime Minister
Shimon Peres said Israel expects
Syria's Assad to agree in the near
future to meet with Barak. He said
the talks under him broke off in
1996 over Assad's refusal to settle
on a date for a meeting with him.
The reclusive Assad rarely
appears in public, even at home,
and his trips abroad are even rarer.
In addition, he may be waiting until
he is sure of success before associ
ating himself with the peace pro
cess.
