Nationwide tributes made as 4 Peanuts' strip ends
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — "AACK! I can't stand it!!" Cathy shouts
Monday as she reads the last new daily "Peanuts'" strip. In "Doone*-
bury," a drug-addled Zouker in a Charlie Brown-stvle zigzag shirt
stretches out on Snoopy's doghouse.
Comic strip artists, political cartoonists and newspapers paid tribute
the best way they knew how to a cancer-stricken Charles Schulz. whose
last new daily "Peanuts" strip ran on Monday.
Many of the 2.600 newspapers that carry "Peanuts" ran the farewell
strip on their front page.
"Cathy" artist Cathy Guisewite and "Doonesbury" creator Garry
Trudeau inserted "Peanuts" in their comic strips. Jason, a character in
the strip "Foxtrot." appeared as Pigpen. The characters in "Jump Start"
mentioned Schulz and Charlie Brown.
Kirk Anderson of the St. Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press, drew a picture
of Snoopy typing a story: "A shy local boy puts pen to paper, not know
ing he will become the most successful and beloved cartoonist of all
time.
"He raises the cartoon to high art: brings psychology, philosophy and
theology into the comics: changes pop culture forever, gives the world
characters as allegorical as Shakespeare's ..."
"I hope this has a happy ending!" Snoopy then thinks, his mouth a
worried squiggle.
Similarly poignant farewells have come from ;ill corners of the globe
for Schulz. 77. who is undergoing chemotherapy for colon cancer diag
nosed in November. He alone wrote, drew, colored and lettered
"Peanuts" for nearly 50 years.
The final daily "Peanuts" strip had a drawing of Snoopy at his type
writer. but there was no gag. just a letter signed by Schulz. In it.he
thanked editors and"the wonderful support and love expressed to me
by fans." I le called the strip "the fulfillment of my childhood ambition."

Computer problem in Boston delays air traffic
NASI II !/\. N.I I. (AP) A computer malfunction at the Federal Avi
ation Administration's Boston Center here delayed flights at airports in
Massachusetts. New Jersey-and New York Monday night.
The main computer at the air traffic control center went down around 7
p.m.. said Jim Peters, spokesman, for the PAA in New England. 1 le said the
problem was corrected by about 10 p.m. I he center used a backup com
puter system during the outage.
"As a result of the outage we incurred extensive delays throughout the
Northeast, both for flights arriving and departing," he said.
Peters said PAA officials would not know what caused the malfunction
until Tuesday.
"Without knowing what has caused the problem, it would be premature
to speculate," he said. "It may turn out to be something other than Y2K."
In Washington. Eliot Brenner, PAA assistant administrator for public
affairs, said: " The problems in Boston are not Y2K related and they are
over now."
The Boston Center controls flights over more than 160.0(X) square miles
of air space from the Atlantic Ocean to western New York and from the
Canadian border to south of 1 .ong Island in New York.
Departures and arrivals at Logan International Airport in Boston were
delayed by at least 30 minutes because of the malfunction, according to air
port officials.
In Chicago, radar displays used to direct traffic into O'Hare Interna
tional Airport went down for about two minutes Monday afternoon, caus
ing minor delays.
The FAA said <iir traffic controllers never lost audio contact with the five
planes in the air and the five on the ground at O'l late at the time.
MCI. which runs the system that failed, blames the outage on a power
surge at an O'Hare generator. PAA spokesman Tony Molinaro said the
problem was not Y2K-related. and planes were never in jeopardy.

Vicious winter weather hits multiple states
OWENSBORO. ky. (AF) — A strong storm that spawned at luast one
tornado ripped through this western Kentucky city on Monday, damaging
hundreds of homes and a college campus. At least IK people were injured.
The springlike storm that struck on a halmv winter day also downed
trees and power lines and unleashed flash flooding in this city of about

"We were sitting at home and the wind started picking up. and then it
started pouring down rain and things started to fly," said Marti Fenwick, a
mother of three whose home was damaged by the storm.
At least IS people were treated at Owensboro Mercy Hospital, said
supervisor Janice Sweeney. Police and emergency medical services were
going door to door and more injuries were possible, she said.
The storm was part of a band of unstable weather that rolled across the
nation's midsection on Monday. Thunderstorms knocked out power in
Arkansas and tornadoes and thunderstorms moved through southeast Mis
souri.
Twisters also touched clown in Mississippi, destroying homes and injur
ing about a half-dozen people, including a couple whose manufactured
home was flipped off its foundation near New Albany. The couple were in
stable condition al a hospital.
Thunderstorms and a possible tornado damaged more than 20 homes in
Southern Illinois.
Kentucky State Police in Henderson received reports of several torna
does in the Owensboro area, a dispatcher said. The National Weather Ser
vice confirmed that one tornado touched down in Owensboro.
A state of emergency was declared in Owensboro, and a curfew was
imposed between 6 p.m. and fi a.m. Tuesday to keep people off the streets
as emergency crews assessed damage and began the cleanup.
The storm damaged 750 homes and 35 businesses and caused
widespread power outages, said Ray Bowman, a state emergency official.
