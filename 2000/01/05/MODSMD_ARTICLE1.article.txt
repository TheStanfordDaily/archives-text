# Biz School will add e-commerce center
## 
### Eileen Chao Contributing writer 
Already known as the breeding
ground for technological successes
such as Yahoo and Hewlett-
Packard. Stanford University
plans to add a new dimension to
the Business School — the Center
for Electronic Business and Com
merce.
In December the I Jniversity an
nounced $20 million in donations
to fund the center, which will study
aspects of Internet business and
economics.
The initial funding for this cen
ter was provided mostly by broker
age firm Charles Schwab & Co.,
private equity firm General At
lantic Partners and Internet auc
tion company eßay. Other flinders
include General Motors and BP
Amoco.
"These funds will enable us to
engage in the research that is so
necessary for managers to fully un
derstand the breadth and impact of
the [Internet commerce) phenom
enon." said Business Prof. Garth
Saloner, co-director of the center,
in a press release, "and to quickly
diffuse the ideas throughout the
curriculum and back out to corpo
rations."
Business School Dean Robert
Joss believes that the center will
play a key role in achieving the
Business School's goal of becom
ing the leading school for research
and education on electronic com
merce.
" The impact of electronic com
merce on all aspects of business
will be profound," Joss said in the
press release. "Given our proximi
ty to Silicon Valley — the heart
and origin of these changes — the
top priority for me is that we re
main the leading school in the re
search and teaching of electronic
commerce issues.
"These partnerships with cor
porate leaders will provide us with
the financial resources as well as
leadership in ideas to enable us to
stay at the forefront." Joss said.
Currently, Stanford is one of
only a few leading business schools
in the country that require a course

on electronic business in order to
earn an MBA.
The center's research will gen
erate even more courses in this
area. However, there will be no
separate degree in electronic com
merce.
"To stay at the forefront of this
fast-moving, in format ion-rich
area, we will focus our research
and accelerate the creation and
dissemination of knowledge." co
director Maim Mendelson said in
the press release. "The Internet
captures data from customers,
users and Web site visitors in a vol
ume and at a speed never before
experienced. The center will pro
vide Opportunities for ground
breaking research through the ac
quisition of unique data sets in this
area."
Some of the specific topics that
the center will research are the be
havior of online communities, the
pricing of Internet goods and In
ternet law.
A new Business School e-com
merce class, "Electronic Com
merce," is being offered this quar
ter. Another class, "Evaluating E-
Business Opportunities" will be
offered next year.
These classes, along with cours
es that are already part of the e
business curriculum at the Busi
ness School, are in high demand
among students, according to Mar
got Sutherland, the center's execu
tive director.
" The center has generated a
great deal of interest," Sutherland
said. "Individuals and companies
have been contacting us about par
ticipating in the seminar series and
taking courses of the GSB. We
look forward to disseminating the
research generated by [the center]
out to the interested parties."
Along with the bi-weekly semi
nars, which begin on Jan. 12 and
will feature industry and faculty
speakers, the center also plans to
hold other special events such as e
commercc conferences for CEOs
and student research projects su
pervised by faculty.
