Creation of new (iSB
e-commerce center is a
step in the right direction

While it may appear all
too easy to jump on the
ever popular e-com
merce bandwagon that seems to
be riding through Silicon Valley,
the creation of a new research
center dedicated to this growing
field at the Graduate School of
Business is a sensible compromise.
The Center for Electronic Busi
ness and Commerce has received
$20 million in first-round funding
from brokerage Charles Schwab
& Co., private equity firm Gener
al Atlantic Partners and online
auction company eßay Inc.,
among others.
I he Center "will act as a clear
inghouse and library for faculty
research and e-commerce case
studies." Additionally, it "will pro
vide support for curriculum devel
opment and student activities
related toe-commerce," according
to the GSB.
The importance of e-commerce
in today's business world needs lit
tle further explanation, particu
larly given the University's prox
imity to Silicon Valley and its posi
tion as an engine of growth in the
high-tech industry.
In fact, many other business
schools have already begun to
offer a separate concentration or
certificate in electronic commerce.
Such moves may be somewhat
premature, however, as schools
have not had sufficient time to

fully study the field of e-com
merce and offer a full range of
course offerings on the topic.
Stanford's approach would he
to integrate e-commerce research
and courses into the entire cur
riculum rather than establishing a
separate degree. This allows
enough time not only lor develop
ment of this area hut also deals
with the crucial issue at hand: that
e-commerce is taking on an inte
gral role in all aspects of the busi
ness world.
It is not a stand-alone concept
in business today as some would
imagine, but rather, is becoming a
phenomenon that will be part and
parcel of every facet of the busi
ness world.
Hopefully, the Center will also
serve to fully educate and inform
about the true complexities of e
commerce. All too often, the Hash
and hype surrounding this topic
has overshadowed sound reason
ing. E-commerce may certainly be
the wave of the future, but that
does not rid it of its own problems.
This is made more pertinent in
light of yesterday's steep NAS
DAQ decline, with the much
vaunted technology stocks leading
the losses.
CiSB Professor and Codirector
of the Center, Garth Saloner,
emphasizes that "within five years
the effects of electronic commerce
and electronic business-to-busi
ness transactions will be ingrained
into all aspects ol' our curriculum."
Such moves will ensure Stan
lord's pre-eminence in the world
of technology and academics.
