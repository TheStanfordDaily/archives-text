# Fighting the good fight
## Whining the loud whine 
### 
Corey Griffin

I've failed. I've fallen
short of my promise to
you and to myself that
I made when I started writ
ing my column, and I'm
sorry. As someone all too
appropriately pointed out
by titling my last column

"Whining the Loud Whine" on the Daily
Web site. I've been whining, and rather bit
terly.
Who the hell am I to attack the yell lead
ers? I was upset about the sorry state of our
student section after the San Jose State fans
out-cheered us. and the still-learning yell
leaders were an easy target for my frustra
tions.
I should be working with those who can
be catalysts tor motivating the student bodv,
not attacking them. But maybe that column
helped: I've never heard the Stanford stu
dent section sound better during Big (lame
(even if we didn't do my all-time favorite
"Beat the Weenies . . . beat, beat the Wee
nies" cheer).
After helping plan for the 102 nd Big
Game and giving my cooperation to keep
students in the stands, I felt betrayed when
the riot police came on the field, as I had
never been told about them. Consequently,
the Stanford Sheriffs not a serious lashing in
my last column.
What good did that column do? Besides
now having my license plate number and
photo in the hands of every Sheriff and unin
tentionally pissing off my friends who work
for Fvent Management, not much as far as I
can tell I doubt the Sheriffs will apologize to
anyone for their actions.
Finally, I bet you're tired of me telling you
how apathetic you are. From advising to sup

porting athletics to just caring about bigger
issues outside your little world. I've berated
you for not caring about almost everything.
If the column made you angry, or if it just
made you think, you never told me. No e
mails. no letters to The Daily, no nasty looks
as I rode by on mv bike. I felt like I might as
well have written another column about how
wonderful it is to go overseas because it
seems everyone was too busy reading (and
writing) more letters to The Daily about the
Cirapes Vote (please indulge that last bit of
bitterness).
So why waste my time and your time
being so negative? What's the point?
There isn't one. 1 thought I could use a
Daily column for something different than
the usual attempts at humor or revealing
"life lessons" through anecdotes. Now, I
really feel like I've wasted my time. Not only
that, I've been bringing people down with
each column. I even had a friend stop me
outside of Sunday Flicks to tell me to write
about something happy for a change.
I said in my first column that 1 would hold
up those parts of Stanford I thought could be
changed, and you all know I've more than
done that. But I also said I would uphold the
good parts about Stanford as well.
It's about time I got to the good stuff, so
here's a list of my favorite things, in no par
ticular order, that I will remember long after
I leave Stanford: late afternoon sun in the
arcades ol the Quad, Larkin, seeing Hoover
Tower as 1 come down Sand Hill from the
2NO. Doug Oshcroff, Sunday Flicks, mv
friends, the Axe. the Rodin sculpture garden,
I listorv ('IV. standing on top of the Stadium
press box.
For being given all of these things and
experiences, I'm ready to actually make

Stanford a better place with the last two
quarters I have here, and I realize now it's
not going to he through this column. Right
now is as good a time as any for resolutions,
and so here are my two.
First off, I'm sending out an early invita
tion to the leaders of all the spirit-related
groups on campus: the Band management,
the Tree, the yell leaders, the chairman of the
Axe Committee, representatives from the
Sixth Man Club, folks from Gaieties and
even a class president or two. It's past time
that we start working together instead of
against one another, so I suggest a regular
(monthly at the most) meeting in order to
start the dialogue that should have begun
long ago.
My second invitation is to all those inter
ested in architecture as a career and those
who want to pursue (or have been pursuing)
architecture as a part of your major at Stan
ford. The support network for those who are
interested in architecture is weak, to say the
least, especially for those who, heaven for
bid, decide to major in something other than
Urban Studies. All of you out there interest
ed in learning more about pursuing architec
ture at Stanford and all those who want to
help establish an advising network for those
interested underclassmen, e-mail me and
keep your ears open.
Meanwhile, I've got about two columns
left, and I'm going to try to make the best of
them.

Corey is a senior majoring in Architectural
Engineering, and von can e-mail him at
corey@leland. He and his other suite/nates
w ant to wish the often-quoted Ryan and the
always-mysterious John happy birthdays!
