## Women's hoops heats up as Pac-10 play looms 
### Kelsey Colvin Contributing writer 
What started off as a very disap
pointing winter break for the Stan
ford women's basketball team has
ended in a five-game winning streak
as the Cardinal begins conference
play.
An 18-point loss to Massachusetts,
74-69. Dec. 12 began the Cardinal's
string of seven games over the last
three weeks.
The loss came despite an 18-point
performance by sophomore guard
Lauren St. Clair. Junior center Car
olyn Moos contributed 13 points and
nine rebounds and senior guard Mile
na Flores continued her consistent
play with 11 points and six assists.
The loss to Massachusetts was fol
lowed by an even more disappointing
69-41 loss to St. Joseph's —the lowest

point total for the Cardinal since the
1983-84 season.
The Cardinal had 17 turnovers to
St. Joseph's five. The team shot poor
ly from the field, and scored only 17
points in the second half.
The losing stopped there. Led by
the increasingly consistent play of
Moos, the Cardinal has won the last
five non-conference regular-season
games.
The 80-66 win over Western
Michigan on Dec. 18 ended the three
game losing streak started by the
tough 79-73 loss to Tennessee in late
November. Four Cardinal players
scored in the double digits.
Moos had a career-high of 23
points. She contributed 12 rebounds,
nine on offense, and five steals. St.
Clair again proved herself a three
point threat, sinking five and finishing
the game with 15 points. Freshman

guard Jamey Carey contributed 14
points and six assists and sophomore
forward Enjoli Izidor had 10 points.
Junior forward Sarah Dimson was an
important force on the boards, gar
nering four offensive and seven de
fensive rebounds for a game total of
11.
Moos continued to lead the Car
dinal offensively in a 70-55 victory
over Pacific on Dec. 20. She scored 22
points and grabbed nine rebounds.
Sophomore forward Bethany
Donaphin stepped up her game that
night as well, scoring 19 points. Dim
son and Donaphin lead the team in
rebounds with 11 each as the Cardi
nal dominated the boards outre
bounding Pacific 58-29.
Flores made her way into the Stan
ford athletic record books during the
Cardinal's subsequent 77-65 win
against St. Mary's. Her four assists for
the game made her only the fourth
Stanford women's basketball player
to pass the 500 career assist mark. She
also had a career-high of nine steals
and contributed 14 points to the Car
dinal victory.
Donaphin was the leading scorer
for the Cardinal with 21 points. She
also contributed seven rebounds. 'ITie
Cardinal had a season high of IS
steals against St. Mary's and forced 27
turnovers.
St. Mary's also saw the return of
sophomore guard Lindsey Yamasa
ki. Yamasaki has missed the season
so far because she also plays on Stan
ford's volleyball team, which finished
second in the NCAA tournament
earlier in the month.
Yamasaki was named to the Pac
-10 All-Freshman team last season
and figures to make an impact on
both sides of the ball as the year con
tinues.
The Cardinal's winning streak
continued with a 57-48 victory over
Utah on Dec. 19. Moos again was the
dominating offensive presence for
the Cardinal with 20 points. She also
led the team in rebounding with six.

a strong force in the backcourt. scor
ing 10 and nine points respectively.
Carey had six steals and St. Clair
had five to lead the team to a total of
17 for the game. Both Moos and Dim
son contributed three blocks each in
the win.

started off the new year with a bang.

48 in Maples Pavilion Jan. 2 and
Moos was named the Pacific 10 Con
ference Women's Basketball Player
of the Week for Dec. 20-Jan. 2.
Moos led the Cardinal with a

game-high 18 points. She also proved
herself a defensive presence with
three blocks and three steals.
Flores was 5-for-5 from the three
point line in the first half and finished
the game with 17 points. She was the
second leading rebounder for the
team with seven, and had four assists
as well.
Donaphin was also a big contribu-

lor. recording a double-double with
16 points and ll rebounds. Senior
guard Christina Batastini had a team
high of seven assists for the game, and
Izidor had nine points.
The Cardinal continues to
dominate with scrappy play.
