## The 						GQ of sportswriting

Having had the opportunity to
cover the Rose Bowl from the press
box, I've come to one definite conclu
sion.
That Big l() run defenses are
tougher than anything Stanford faced
in conference play this year? Nope.

That Troy Walters ended his Stan
ford career with the heart and class of
a true champion? Well, that's of
course true, but it's not what I was
thinking of.
I now know that when I grow up I
don't want to be a sportswriter — at
least not one of the ones I saw at the
game.
Never before had I seen such a
motley crew of middle-aged, slightly
to completely overweight folks in cof
fee-stained shirts with more bags
under their eyes than in the luggage
system at the new Denver airport.
Now Armani may not be my mid
dle name, but I do know that a purple
and green paisley shirt does not go
well with chocolate brown slacks.

Black wingtips and white tube socks?
Also a big no-no.
These guys wouldn't know Bar
ney's in New York from the lovable
purple dinosaur.
And the free buffet — don't even
get me started on the free buffet. In
every football press box there is a free
buffet of food for the writers ranging
from quite good stuff at the LA Coli
seum to Stanford's cold turkey sand
wiches.
Your standard professional
sportswriter spends more time at the
free buffet than Ponce de Leon spent
in Florida looking for the Fountain of
Youth. Being a poor college student,
I never pass up the opportunity for a
free meal, but there's a finite limit on
how many hot dogs and how much
potato salad a person can eat. Or so I
thought.
I'm entering that period of my life
where future employment plans have
become a hot topic of conversation.
My parents, my friends, my parents'
friends and even all those nice Wis
consin fans I met in LA are beginning
to ask where this grand Stanford edu
cation is heading in terms of a J-O-B.
And since I haven't taken any
Fcon classes outside of Econ I. I can
throw consulting and I-banking right
out the window. That leaves, well
journalism and something along the
lines of Deuce Bigalow. So that
leaves journalism.

So, you're thinking "bring on the
free buffet," right?
Not so fast.
Because sports, and sportswriting
for that matter, are about far more
than free buffets.
Sports are some of life's most
unique endeavors. They are able to
reveal our deepest emotions —joy in
victory and agony in defeat.
Sportswriters are given a glimpse
into heroic feats on the field and off.
Watching Troy Walters return to
play in the Rose Bowl and seeing the
dejection on the faces of the Stanford
players as time expired in the game
really are those "magic moments"
that I've spoke of many times in this
column.
Sports gives us something that
nothing else truly can — almost a syn
thesis of the ferocity of war and the
serenity of peace.
I've been lucky to have the chance
to spend so much time around the
Stanford athletic community during
my work as a writer, and moments
like the Rose Bowl will never be for
gotten.
Now, will I go on to a career in
sportswriting? It's definitely tempt
ing. but I just don't know if I can pull
off the wardrobe.

Ben Jones, a junior, does not own any
purple and green paisley shirts... yet.
