## Lightning upsets the distant sky 
### Bruce Wang Editorial staff 
Within roughly a second of a single lightning Hash in Texas,
electrons can precipitate out of the Earth's radiation belts onto the
upper atmosphere above an area spanning Oklahoma to South
Dakota, researchers at Stanford have found.
This is the first indication that lightning can have such a far
ranging effect. I he lightning temporarily changes the composition
ol the radiation belts and the ionosphere below it within an area of
several hundred thousand square miles.
I he tindings suggest "lightning could be an important contrib
utor to the loss of electrons from the Earth's radiation belt, and
thus helps us better understand the Earth's near-space environ
ment. said Umran Inan. Electrical Engineering Prof, in Stan
ford's STARLab (Space. Telecommunications and Radioscience

Laboratory).
Inan and graduate student Michael Johnson made the observa
tions by using a network of low-frequency radio receivers in the
Midwest that can sense changes in the ionosphere â€” the conduct
ing portion of the Earth's atmosphere that begins some 4() miles
above ground.
Scientists have known for several decades that the electromag
netic waves from lightning cause electrons to rain out of the radi
ation belt, "but this result indicates it occurs on a huge scale at
night," Inan said.
"It also must occur during the day, but the effect on the iono
sphere is relatively small compared to solar ionization. At these
mid-latitudes, we now think the nighttime ionosphere may be
dominated by these lightning effects."
According to Inan. electrons trapped in the Earth's magnetic
field come in from the sun as solar wind. They become trapped in
the radiation belts where they bounce from one end of the mag
netic field line to the other, until some other process comes along
to release them.
Lightning performs that function by launching waves upward
nearly along the Earth's magnetic field lines, scattering high-ener
gy particles in both momentum and pitch angle along the route.
Deflected from their trapped orbit, the electrons precipitate
out into the atmosphere where they produce light. X-rays and
ionization.
Previously, researchers thought effective precipitation of elec
trons was only caused by waves traveling in tiny tubes of ioniza
tion along magnetic field lines called ducts, with lightning only
affecting those trapped electrons that are confined to these nar
row paths in space.
The new finding indicates that electromagnetic waves from
lightning populate large regions of the radiation belts from which
they precipitate electrons, which means they could potentially
influence loss rates of trapped particles on a global scale.
Not every lightning flash behaves this way, Inan said. He and
Johnson are now trying to determine when it does and doesn't.
"You can imagine in a thunderstorm, particularly after a solar
blast has built up the particles in the radiation belt, that you could
get these splashes of particles precipitating out every second,
which would have a large effect on the ionosphere," Inan said.
The team has found dozens of examples, including one strike in
a group of flashes that lit up the sky near Austin, Texas, in the
early morning hours of Oct. 18. 1998. The precipitated energetic
electrons began raining down about a second after the strike and
over a huge area beginning several hundred miles to the north of
Austin and ending in South Dakota.
"The effect may have kept on going further north," Johnson
said, "but that's how far we were able to track it from our existing
network."
