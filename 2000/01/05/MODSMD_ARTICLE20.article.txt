## New germs in your mouth 
### Bruce Wang Editorial staff 
People may believe that their mouths are
pristine after a good brushing and flossing.
But the truth is that the human mouth is home
to so many microbes that some researchers
compare it to a rain forest for the diversity of
life and vast territory yet to be explored.
A study by Stanford researchers supports
this analogy by identifying 37 new kinds of
bacteria thriving between the teeth and gums.
The research brings the total known species of
oral wildlife to about 500, some of which are
permanent residents, while others may just be
passing through.
"The mouth is a plush ecosystem unto
itself, and we are just beginning to see what is
really there," said David Relman, the study's
team leader and an assistant professor of
medicine and microbiology. "People like to
go to Africa to stare at animals, but micro
organisms are far more diverse."
Knowing more about the bacteria that
reside in a normal, healthy mouth may help
physicians understand changes in the bacteri
al population that can lead to gingivitis, peri
odontitis and tooth decay.
"Our data suggest that a significant pro
portion of the resident human bacterial flora
remain poorly characterized, even within this
well-studied and familiar microbial environ
ment," said Relman.
According to Relman, the subgingival
crevice — the deep gum pocket cradling each
tooth — has been repeatedly scrutinized in
the search for microbes. Even though almost
500 bacterial strains have been identified
already, Relman believes this may be only a
fraction of the bacteria living in this oral
groove.
Oral bacteria have traditionally been stud

ied by taking a sample from inside the mouth,
growing them in the laboratory and then iden
tifying different species according to biochem
ical tests and the type of food source that each
bacteria prefers. Using this method, the Rel
man team identified bacteria found in a sam
ple of plaque taken from the subgingival
crevice.
They also searched the sample using
molecular techniques. They prepared DNA
directly from the plaque and studied each
genetic sequence that had a bacterial signa
ture. Comparing the results, they found that
the molecular method yielded many new bac
teria. Not only did the method reveal strains
that had never before been found in the
mouth, but many were bugs that had not yet
been documented by microbiologists.
The team discovered 31 bacteria using the
molecular method. In contrast, the traditional
approach, which only identifies bacteria that
can be cultivated in the lab. uncovered only
six new strains
"Sequence-based environmental microbial
surveys have taught us that cultivation meth
ods woefully underrepresent the true extent
of bacterial diversity," said Relman.
Although the cultivation method tradition
ally used by clinical microbiology labs did not
uncover the bacterial diversity revealed by the
molecular technique, the researchers found
that some bacteria were more readily recov
ered the old way, indicating that DNA analy
sis and cultivation both have a role in the com
prehensive study of human microbial popula
tions.
Characterization of previously undocu
mented oral bacteria is part of the Relman
team's larger effort to identify rare and unusu
al microbes that make their home in the
human body — many cohabiting benignly but
some causing mysterious human disease.
