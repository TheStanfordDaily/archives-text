# Campus escapes unscathed from Y2K bug
## Preparations by task force credited for trouble-free transition 
### Sameer Ahmed Contributing writer 
Stanford's entrance into the year
2(KK) was much like the rest of the
world's — fairly uneventful.
Because of thousands of staff
members from Facilities Operations,
Information Technology Systems
and Services, Communications,
Housing and Dining Services and
Public Safety who helped with Stan
ford's Y2K Readiness Program over
the past seven years, all systems were
operating normally as the new year
ticked over.
As the Stanford football team was
preparing to compete in the Rose
Bowl, about 250 workers on a special
Y2K Operations Team spent the
weekend on campus completing
preparations for Stanford's transition
to the year 2(KK).
These stall members carried out
planned activities designed to pre
vent or identify and fix Y2K-rclated

problems and communicated the sta
tus of campus operations to members
of the Stanford community.
"We had very positive results."
said Stanford Y2K Project Manager
Karl Heins. "In terms of everyday
functioning, there were no major de
lays. I have already contacted 24
areas on the task force, and they are
all at lull readiness."
On the eve of the millennium,
most Stanford computer systems
were up and running as usual, with
the exception of Axcss. which was
off-line for 24 hours. ('omputer and
network administrators were on
call to handle any unforeseen prob
lems.
The task force wasextremely busy
earlier during winter break fixing
known Y2K-compatibility problems.
One problem they had to fix was
with the I Jniversity payroll system, so
that faculty, students and other em
ployees can receive their paychecks
on Jan. 7.

"Because of the hard work of our
task force and readiness program, we
were able to fix many problems be
fore they could occur." said Steven
Jung, director of internal audit and
managing sponsor for the Y2K
Readiness Program.
Another problem the Y2K task
force fixed was with the I luman Re
sources system, which tracks employ
ment on campus. Without that sys
tem. Stanford could not process any
personnel actions.
While no major problems oc
curred during the Y2K transition, the
University has still taken certain steps
to mitigate possible adverse effects
on students who decided to delay
their return to campus because of
Y2K concerns.
In a letter to the Stanford commu
nity, Provost John Hennessy and
Vice Provost James Montoya staled.
"Although we feel confident in Stan
ford's Y2K readiness, we cannot and
do not vouch for the Y2K readiness

systems and services outside of Stan
ford — for example, transportation
and communication systems."
Because of these reasons, dead
lines for payment of Winter Quarter
tuition and room and board fees has
been extended from Jan. 3 to Jan. 7.
Alternative procedures have been
designed for class signups that nor
mally take place the first Monday of
the quarter. Housing assignments for
students moving into University
housing at the beginning of Winter
Quarter weren't canceled if they
were unable to arrive by Jan. 2 due to
travel delays or concerns. And lastly,
the Winter Quarter start dates at
Stanford's overseas programs were
delayed so that no student needed to
fly before Jan 3.
As for the future, Jung stated that
there is ;i slight possibility that some
Y2K glitches might emerge. There
fore. the task force plans to continue
to monitor all of the systems through
out the next few months.
