# Cox Committee Report re-assessed
## Stanford group says Chinese weapons spying un-confirmed 
### Megan Knize Contributing writer 
Stories of a Chinese nuclear spy
scandal made international news last
spring — but a recent report by the
Stanford Institute for International
Security and Cooperation concluded
that there may have been no spying
at all.
Five international security ex
perts from the institute authored the
Cox Committee Assessment, re
leased Dec. 15. which concludes,
"there is no credible evidence pre
sented or instances described of actu
al theft of U.S. missile technology."
Most of the fears of espionage
began in 1998, when a congressional
committee led by Rep. Christopher
Cox released a report detailing 20
years of nuclear espionage by China.
According to institute officials,
th e K( X )-page C \ >x C om m it tee Report
mainly addressed the supposed sale
or "theft" of missile-launch technolo
gy from national weapons laborato
ries, such as Los Alamos and
Lawrence Livermore.
"The reason why we did this was
that there was a concern over the
original report," said Andrew
Kuchins, associate director of the in
stitute. "There were many factual er
rors and issues of interpretation."
Michael May. the co-director of

the institute, wrote in the report's in
troduction that the researchers
wished to refute the "spectacular ac
cusations" against government
sponsored research institutions.
The authors said in the report that
Cox's claims are "dramatic" and the
conclusions "unwarranted." They re
fute the 1998 report by addressing
Chinese politics, economics and nu
clear doctrine; nuclear weapons; in
teractions between U.S. and Chinese
nuclear weapons laboratories; and
missile technology.
The Cox Committee disputes the
institute's findings because the insti
tute's researchers didn't have access
to classified documents.
"There was some concern about
the impact of the report," Kuchins
said. "The Cox Committee Report
was released last spring and the inter
est had quieted down, but in order for
us to do a good job. it takes time."
The initial response to the report
was greater than expected.
"It definitely attracted a fair
amount of attention," Kuchins said.
"On the first day it was published.
4.5(H) copies were downloaded from
our Web site." The report was also
covered in several Northern Califor
nia papers and the Washington Post.
This was the first time CISAC held a
press conference for one of the their
publications.
