## 
### T.J. Babbitt Editorial staff 
Stanford has charged at least
one student with a violation of the
Fundamental Standard in relation
to the racist e-mail that was sent
last spring.to many campus e-mail
accounts. Vice Provost for Student
Affairs James Montoya announced
yesterday.
Montoya said that the student
whose account was used to send the
message was not responsible for the
incident, something which the Uni
versity has believed all along and is
now ready to confirm. He also said
that there were parts of the investi
gation that were continuing, but de

clined further comment and said he
would release no further details re
garding the incident or surrounding
the investigation.
"1 attempted to convey as much
information as I could given the
constraints of the Student Judicial
Charter." he said.
The e-mail, which contained
slurs against blacks and Latinos
and contained a link to a Web site
with anti-Semitic, anti-black text,
was sent from a computer server in
Escondido Village last spring, ac
cording to computer security offi
cials.
The charge will now be adjudi
cated by a judicial panel consisting
of four students and two faculty or

staff members, under the system
for handling Honor Code and Fun
damental Standard violations that
has been in place since 1998. I'his
process is used for disciplining cur
rently enrolled students.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
also declined to comment on the
specifics of the investigation, but he
did say that it was conducted on
three levels: by Judicial Affairs, by
Stanford computer security work
ers and by federal law enforcement
officials.
Federal law enforcement had
asked Stanford not to pursue any
disciplinary action until they had
completed their own investigation.
According to Montova, Stanford

honored that request but began its
own investigation of the incident
last fall, because of the six-month
statute of limitations in the Student
Judicial Charter.
Montova said he hoped that in
the aftermath of the incident more
students would be engaged in com
bating racism on campus.
"[Assistant Dean of Students]
Tommy Woon will soon be launch
ing another series of Race Dia
logues on campus, and my hope is
that many more students will par
ticipate than in the past. We each
have a personal responsibility to
maintain a community that values
and supports diversity," Montova
said.
