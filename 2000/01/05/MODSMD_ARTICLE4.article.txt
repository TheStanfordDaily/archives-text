### Melissa Lambert Contributing writer 
In I lousingand Dining Services' Dec. 7 meet
ing with United Stanford Workers. University
negotiators conceded to two of the union's six
demands for Dining Services workers, accord
ing to workers who attended the meeting.
But union members are still upset over what
they perceive as Dining Services' unfair labor
practices. Among other complaints, they allege
that food quality has decreased as Dining Ser
vices has shuffled workers between kitchens and
used more temporary workers.
Outcome of the meeting
According to Dining Services workers ;md
the union, management agreed not to call ill em
ployees at home to ask questions about their ill
ness and when they planned to come back to
work.
"It is the employee's responsibility to report
whether they are sick," said Bruce Gresham,
who has been a Dining Services worker for the
past 25 years.
In a November interview with Eida Uorna,
asst. director of Dining Services, I lorna s;iid that
management did not call ill employees at home
to intimidate them.
"It is not our policy to call or threaten work
ers into coming in to work." I lorna said. "I don't
want to say that no one is ever called at home,
but I am confident our managers would never

threaten anyone."
According to Dining Services workers and
the union, management also agreed to tell work
ers how much vacation and sick time they have
accrued.
"It is depressing because it took so much
work to get something that is standard" else
where at Stanford, said Julia Scheulke, the di
rector of Education and Special Districts for the
union. "I would expect that Stanford would be
sophisticated enough to get this standard infor
mation to workers on a regular basis, but unfor
tunately the\ needed a lot of union and public
pressure to do the right thing."
Keith Smith, labor relations manager for the
University, refused to comment directly on the
negotiations, but he characterized the dialogue
as "very positive, productive and constructive."
"Both sides are satisfied that progress is
being made toward resolution of issues of mutu
al concern." he said.
Arroyo's case
Some workers believe the death of Florence
Moore Hall kitchen worker Daniel Arroyo on
Oct. 5. which they allege was due to a "hostile
work environment," is representative of the
treatment of all Dining Services employees in
the past two years as they have worked under
largely new management.
()nc woman, who was working alongside Ar
royo on the day he died, said that earlier that day
Arroyo had complained of chest pain but was

"afraid he would be fired if he went home, so he
didn't go to the doctor."
According to Smith, "The issues around
which we are focused are not connected to [Ar
royo's] death."
Yet Schuelke said, "The death got the atten
tion of top management. It made them realize
that they can't cover up their problems anymore
but that they have to deal with them."
Whether or not Arroyo's work environment
contributed to his death, workers say their hick
of job stability and their treatment by the new
management has decreased the quality of food
they serve to students.
According to Gresham, many Dining Ser
vices workers have been at Stanford for 20 years
or more and until a few years ago, their supervi
sors had been worÃŸTngat the University for just
as long.
But in the past few years, he said, many expe
rienced supervisors have left. Gresham said
workers believe that the new supervisors and
lower-level managers have not been trained ad
equately and treat them like they "are less than
human."
At the beginning of this school year. Stanford
implemented a new "Value Enhancement Pro
gram." According to Dining Services, the pro
gram is "aimed at improving the actual and per
ceived value of student meal plans."
But workers say the program lias split apart
experienced teams of workers by re-assigning
