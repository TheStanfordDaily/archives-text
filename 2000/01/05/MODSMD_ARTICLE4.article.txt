### Melissa Lambert Contributing writer 
In I lousingand Dining Services' Dec. 7 meet
ing with United Stanford Workers. University
negotiators conceded to two of the union's six
demands for Dining Services workers, accord
ing to workers who attended the meeting.
But union members are still upset over what
they perceive as Dining Services' unfair labor
practices. Among other complaints, they allege
that food quality has decreased as Dining Ser
vices has shuffled workers between kitchens and
used more temporary workers.
Outcome of the meeting
According to Dining Services workers ;md
the union, management agreed not to call ill em
ployees at home to ask questions about their ill
ness and when they planned to come back to
work.
"It is the employee's responsibility to report
whether they are sick," said Bruce Gresham,
who has been a Dining Services worker for the
past 25 years.
In a November interview with Eida Uorna,
asst. director of Dining Services, I lorna s;iid that
management did not call ill employees at home
to intimidate them.
"It is not our policy to call or threaten work
ers into coming in to work." I lorna said. "I don't
want to say that no one is ever called at home,
but I am confident our managers would never

threaten anyone."
According to Dining Services workers and
the union, management also agreed to tell work
ers how much vacation and sick time they have
accrued.
"It is depressing because it took so much
work to get something that is standard" else
where at Stanford, said Julia Scheulke, the di
rector of Education and Special Districts for the
union. "I would expect that Stanford would be
sophisticated enough to get this standard infor
mation to workers on a regular basis, but unfor
tunately the\ needed a lot of union and public
pressure to do the right thing."
Keith Smith, labor relations manager for the
University, refused to comment directly on the
negotiations, but he characterized the dialogue
as "very positive, productive and constructive."
"Both sides are satisfied that progress is
being made toward resolution of issues of mutu
al concern." he said.
Arroyo's case
Some workers believe the death of Florence
Moore Hall kitchen worker Daniel Arroyo on
Oct. 5. which they allege was due to a "hostile
work environment," is representative of the
treatment of all Dining Services employees in
the past two years as they have worked under
largely new management.
()nc woman, who was working alongside Ar
royo on the day he died, said that earlier that day
Arroyo had complained of chest pain but was

"afraid he would be fired if he went home, so he
didn't go to the doctor."
According to Smith, "The issues around
which we are focused are not connected to [Ar
royo's] death."
Yet Schuelke said, "The death got the atten
tion of top management. It made them realize
that they can't cover up their problems anymore
but that they have to deal with them."
Whether or not Arroyo's work environment
contributed to his death, workers say their hick
of job stability and their treatment by the new
management has decreased the quality of food
they serve to students.
According to Gresham, many Dining Ser
vices workers have been at Stanford for 20 years
or more and until a few years ago, their supervi
sors had been worÃŸTngat the University for just
as long.
But in the past few years, he said, many expe
rienced supervisors have left. Gresham said
workers believe that the new supervisors and
lower-level managers have not been trained ad
equately and treat them like they "are less than
human."
At the beginning of this school year. Stanford
implemented a new "Value Enhancement Pro
gram." According to Dining Services, the pro
gram is "aimed at improving the actual and per
ceived value of student meal plans."
But workers say the program lias split apart
experienced teams of workers by re-assigning
some workers to different dining
hails. Since each cook has theirown
equipment and style, ii takes time
for the workers to become accus
tomed to working with them.
Some workers said the new as
signments create confusion, decreas
ing the efficiency of production and
the quality ol the food they serve.
Mares, who has worked in Stan
ford dining services for 35 years, said
of the program. "On paper il looks
good, but in reality it doesn't work."
(iresham said that management
has tried to cut costs by buying
"lower quality meat and food in
general" and using inexperienced
temporary workers.
"Stanford pays consultants a

salary to figure out how to cut costs
instead ol asking the people who
work here how to do it."he said.
The remaining union demands
include increasing staffing levels and
converting temporary employees
into regular employees with Stan
ford benefits.
The Value Enhancement Pro
gram currently in place aims to
"leverage full-time employees and
reduce reliance on temporary staff."
but (iresham said that when perma
nent employees have retired or quit,
the University hasn't rehired new
regular employees to replace them,
instead using temporary workers to
fill their spots.
Although many of the temporary
workers have been employed by
Stanford lot more than a year.
Schuelke said, they don't get any
benefits and aren't paid "livable

wages." (iresham said management
"abuses" temporary workers, work
ing them for lour hours straight
without giving them the break to
which regular employees are enti
tled.
Schuelke said temporary work
ers are .1 burden upon the regular
employees, who have to work along
side them and train them.
I he union is also demanding that
management "pay employees ac
cording to the job classification as
signed to work. " ('urrently. employ
ees are only paid the higher salary ol
a cook il tliev work more than 50
percent of the time in that capacity.
I o cut costs, the I : niversity has
been using lower-paid workers to
perform many of the tasks of cooks,
according to Mares.
Because these workers are
switched around to perform many

different tasks, they say that they
cannot spend enough time in one
part of the kitchen to become accus
tomed to and skilled at a certain job.
Mares said this leads to job dissatis
faction and causes the quality of the
food to suffer.
Supervisors' training is also an
issue. When the University hires
lower-level dining service managers
and supervisors, they "send them to
a seminar and call them trained."
said (iresham. "They need more
training on how tp talk to people. In
most jobs, training lasts fit) to 90
days. He continued. "The new
management changes every two
years. 11 they don't last, something is
w long."
Negotiations are ongoing. An
other meeting was held Dec. 15. but
neither side was available to discuss
the outcome.
