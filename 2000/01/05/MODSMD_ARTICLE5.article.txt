Stanford's bedtime is soon to be
pushed back to 2 a.m. most places
on campus due to a collaborative
effort by the ASSIJ and Dean of
Students Marc Wais.
The initiative, called "Stanford
after Midnight." goes into effect
tomorrow in response to student
requests to better match service
and facility to hours when students
want to use them.
According to a time study eon
ducted last year, the average stu
dent bedtime was 2:31 a.m.
"Students over the years have
commented that they would rather
have services open later to acco
modate their lifestyle." Wais said.
"A number of students suggested
that problems with alcohol may in
fact decrease if there were other
options available."
Starting Thursday, many facili
ties will remain open until 2 a.m.
every day, including the Tresidder
computer Lair, the Treehouse (for
merly Polio Rev), meeting rooms
in Tresidder Union. Tresidder l it

ness, the Ford Center basketball
courts and the deGuerre racquet
ball courts.
Late Night dining facilities in
Stern Hall and Lakeside Dining
will be open until 2 a.m. Sunday
through Thursday.
The newly remodeled Coffee
House will be open until 2 a.m.
Sunday through Thursday and
until midnight Friday and Satur
day; the Pulse will be open until 2
a.m. Monday through Thursday,
until midnight Friday, and from b
p.m. until 2 a.m. on Sunday - self
service options only after 5 p.m.
each day.
The Bookstore is extending its
hours until II p.m. on Fridays, and
Tresidder Express will be open
until I a.m. Sunday through Thurs
day and until midnight on Fridays.
The two businesses arc trying out
the new hours for a six-week trial
period.
Later this quarter, the first two
floors of Meyer Library will be
come a 24-hour study facility.
Because campus facilities will
be open later at night, there will be
an increased presence of Stanford
Police and SURE Escort services,
according to Wais.
In a recent e-mail concerning
the Stanford after Midnight initia
tive. Wais urged students to be es
pecially careful out at night: "Stu

dents, as always, are ultimately re
sponsible for their own personal
safety. Please he sure to travel with
at least one other student and avoid
dark, vacant or deserted areas," he
said.
Wais urged students to make
good use of the changes. "It's a
very expensive undertaking and
very much a trial program," he
said. "We're hoping students take
advantage of it."
