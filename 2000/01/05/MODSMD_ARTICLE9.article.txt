## Nasdaq suffers from record loss 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Stock
prices plummeted Tuesday as grow
ing fears of higher interest rates gave
investors a reason to sell shares and
capture gains from last year's spec
tacular performance. The Nasdaq
composite index, the best performer
in 1999, suffered its worst point loss
in history.
The Dow Jones industrial aver
age fell 359.58, to close at 10,997.93,
its fourth-worst point decline ever
and a drop of 3.17 percent. The blue
chip index had dipped as much as
38() points earlier in the session.
Broader stock indicators also sus
tained sharp losses. The Standard &
Poor's 500 fell 55.80 to 1.399.42, and
the Nasdaq composite index
plunged 229.46 to 3,901.69. In per
centage terms, the Nasdaq's 5.6 per
cent decline was the eighth-worst in
history.
The retreat, on top of Monday's
decline of 140 points, brought the
Dow down its lowest level since New.
30. The Nasdaq's close was the low
est since Dec. 20.
Investors continued a wave of
selling that began Monday as the
market balanced good news about a
smooth conversion to the Year 2(MH)
with concern that runaway econom
ic growth will prompt the Federal
Reserve to resume raising interest
rates as a way to curb inflation.
"The toggle switch moved from
'off to 'on' regarding interest-rate
worries," said Hank Herrmann,
chief investment officer at Waddell
& Reed of Overland Park, Kan.
Herrmann said investors had
been able to brush off concerns
about rising rates while Y2K loomed
as a potentially greater threat to the
market. With worries about comput
er troubles now mostly alleviated,
interest rates are once again rattling

investors.
In 1999. only technology stocks
proved immune to the Fed's three
rate increases, breaking out of a

springtime lull to move to record
breaking highs by the end of the
year.
While inflation fears and the

Fed's rate increases put many stocks
into a protracted slump in the second
half of the year, tech shares helped
the major market indexes to new
records at year's end.
The Fed left rates unchanged at
its December meeting, hoping to
ensure monetary stability while Y2K
concerns played out around the
world. Now, central bankers are like
ly to focus on continued signs of eco
nomic growth.
Rising interest rates typically hurt
stocks by cutting into corporate prof
its as it becomes more expensive to
borrow money. Higher rates can be
especially devastating to younger,
fast-growing companies, whose
promise of future earnings growth
may be threatened.
Ironically, a decline in U.S. shares
now could help assuage the Fed.

the main engines of economic

of its concern over stocks' lofty valu
ations.
"If economic growth is too high,
the Fed must continue raising rates,
and the stock market has become a
real factor in that decision." said
I lerrmann.
Still, most analysts believe Tues
day's selloff was a temporary drop in
a market that still feeds on strong
corporate profits and moderate eco
nomic growth. A steep decline in
stocks was to be expected, and could
leave the market in better shape for
another advance, said Richard E.
C "ripps. chief market strategist for
I.egg Mason in Baltimore.
"The market has had a very
strong run." said Cripps. "Higher
interest rates are providing a catalyst
for some selling that probably needs
to take place before it can go any
higher."
