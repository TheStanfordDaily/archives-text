### Kristin Rose Contributing writer 
The Stanford Race and Ethnic
ity Dialogues, a program created
by Tommy Lee Woon, assistant
dean of students and multicultural
educator, are expanding this quar
ter in the spirit of the President's
Initiative on Race.
Trained facilitators will lead
Race and Ethnicity Dialogues in
various dormitories during winter
quarter. The goal is for students to
meet in their dorms to discuss is
sues of race, ethnicity, religion and
intolerance. The program aims "to
create a mechanism for bringing
people together to address histori
cal divides between racial and eth
nic groups," Woon said.
Woon chose a quote from au
thor Elie Wiesel to illustrate the
principle behind the dialogues:
"People become the stories that
they tell."
The Race and Ethnicity Dia
logues will begin in the third week
of winter quarter. Groups of eight
to 16 students will meet in their
dorms for six one-hour meetings.
The meetings will begin with trust
building activities and the sharing
of personal experiences with
racism. As the quarter progresses,
the groups w ill discuss campus ten
sions over race and will brainstorm
possible remedies.
Over the past two years, 220
Stanford students have participat-

Ed in race dialogues in 17 resi
dences. Nathan Osborne, a senior,
participated in a dialogue in Ham
marskjold House. He said, "It was
a truly enlightening experience and
the stories that people told were in
tense."
Osborne said the dialogue
opened his mind to the "deepness
of racial issues and diverse racial
background of people here on
campus."
Students majoring in Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity
have held their own race dialogues
that they have found to be impera
tive to their course of study.
Due to the positive responses to
previous race dialogues, "a num
ber of students, staff and faculty
have expressed interest in promot
ing more dialogues and [expand
ing] their scope this year," Woon
said.
"Nothing good can happen to
overcome racism and other diversi
ty challenges without open and
honest discussions."
Sally Dickson, director of cam
pus relations, has led staff race dia
logue groups for the past three
years and said she has found them
very successful.
Dickson said her goal as a facili
tator was to help participants gain
"a deeper understanding of differ
ences and identities." She said the
kev to conducting dialogues is to
create a comfortable forum that
provides a feeling of safety so that
participants can reflect on their
identities.
Dickson added that the dia
logues are a process of building
trust so that participants can un
derstand "the commonality of hu
manity that we all experience."
In 1997 President Bill Clinton
created the President's Race Ini
tiative. In response, Stanford stu
dents participated in this national
conversation concerning race
through the Stanford Dialogue is
Action ( onl'erence.
The conference brought togeth
er more than 75 campus and com
munity leaders.
