# Israelis, Syrians begin peace talks

SHEPHERDSTOWN. W.Va.
(AP) — Israel and Syria finally are
beginning their first substantive dis
cussions in nearly four years, resum
ing the chase for elusive peace after
settling a dispute on what to talk
about first.
Committees of experts from both
countries as well as the United
States, which is playing the role of
facilitator, were to begin the chal
lenging job today of narrowing the
gaps that have divided Israel and
Syria for more than half a century.
Here for the first two days of
talks. President Bill Clinton made
other plans today while keeping in
touch with the committees.
At the White House, spokesman
Jim Fallin said Clinton would make
a decision Thursday what steps he
might next take in the attempt to
mediate between Syria and Israel.
State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin said the committees
would meet over the next couple of
days to tackle outstanding issues
between the two countries. Rubin
did not elaborate on which commit
tees would convene or even their
number.
"They have a work plan and an
organizational structure." Rubin
said Tuesday.
But the key issues dividing the
two foes include the extent of an
Israeli pullout from the strategic
Golan Heights that Syria lost in

-1%7, water rights, the character of
peace, security arrangements and a
timetable for the withdrawal.
A source close to the Syrian del
egation said the convening of the
working groups was a sign of
progress in the negotiations. 1 le said
President Hafez Assad is being
updated on all developments in the
talks.
A confidant of Israeli Prime Min
ister Ehud Barak raised another
major issue: Syria's alliance with
Iran. "If someone seriously desires
peace with us. he will have to break
off alliances with people who to this
day talk about destruction of
Israel," Deputy Defense Minister
Ephraim Sneh told Israel radio
today.
Sneh noted Iranian ruler Ali
Khamenei as recently as Friday had
called for annihilation of Israel.
Sneh said also that Syria would
have to ensure that Iran-backed
Hezbollah guerrillas in southern
Lebanon are disarmed.
The source close to the Syrian
delegation, commenting on Snch's
remarks, said Israel "cannot dictate
its will on the Syrians."
Marking another milestone in the
Mideast peace process, Israel today
began transferring 5 percent of the
West Bank to Palestinian control.
By Jan. 20. the Palestinians are due
to control 40 percent of the territory.
Israel and the Palestinians have

set a Feb. 13 deadline for agreement
on the framework fora final peace
treaty.
In the talks with Syria. Israel had
wanted to discuss security first. But
Syria insisted on taking up the with
drawal issue — how much land
Israel would yield and the timetable
for the pullback. The dispute led to
the cancellation of a three-way ses
sion on Monday that was to bring
together Clinton, Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
That hurdle was overcome Tues
day with an American proposal that
the committees meet simultaneous
ly, according to the source close to
the Syrian delegation. Speaking on
condition of anonymity, he told The
Associated Press the committees
were assigned to deal with border
demarcation, water, security and
normalization of relations.
The source said the border
demarcation committee and the
water committee held brief, infor
mal talks Tuesday.
The decision to proceed with the
committee meetings came after the
first face-to-face discussions
between Barak and al-Sharaa
under the auspices of Clinton —
since this second round of negotia
tions began Monday.
Rubin called the session "more
of a general discussion" than negoti
ations over hard issues. But he said
the three leaders had "a verv con

structive and productive discussion
that put the process clearly on
track."
They "reaffirmed their commit
ment to the process." Rubin said,
but he added that Barak and al-
Sharaa still apparently did not shake
hands.
Despite his relatively upbeat
assessment of the first meeting,
Rubin said it was unlikely an accord
could be reached by the end of the
week.
Later Tuesday, Clinton gave a
reception for the Israeli and Syrian
delegations before returning to
Washington, about 70 miles away.
The source close to the Syrian dele
gation said five members of every
delegation, including the U.S. team,
attended the reception in addition to
Clinton. Barak and al-Sharaa. He
said the atmosphere was more cor
dial than it has been in the past two
days.
This is the first time in almost
four years that Israel and Syria have
met to deal with issues of substance.
The talks broke off in 19% following
suicide attacks in Israel. They were
resumed in Washington last month.
Having Barak and al-Sharaa talk
about those issues face-to-face,
under Clinton's auspices, gives new
meaning to the decades-old U.S.
drive to gain Arab recognition of the
Jewish state in exchange for Israeli
held territory.
