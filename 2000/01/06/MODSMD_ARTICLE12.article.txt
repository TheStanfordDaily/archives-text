ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) — A militant
Islamic group battling Indian soldiers in disputed
Kashmir says the five hijackers of an Indian pas
senger plane are still in Afghanistan.
The report runs counter to claims by the Tal
iban religious army that rules Afghanistan. The
Taliban have said the hijackers left the country
with the two militants and a Muslim cleric freed by
India in exchange for the 155 hostages held aboard
an Indian Airlines jet.
India insists the five fugitives fled into Pakistan,
a charge the Pakistani government denies.
"According to our information, they are still in
Kandahar," the city in southern Afghanistan
where the plane was held, said Sved Salahuddin.
chief of the Islamic Jehad Council, an umbrella
group that represents more than one dozen Mus
lim militant groups battling Indian troops in dis
puted Kashmir. Many of these groups reportedly
receive training in Afghanistan.
Salahuddin was speaking to reporters late
Tuesday and didn't elaborate on his sources.
Kashmir has been divided between India and
Pakistan since 1947 and both countries claim the
territory in its entirety. Muslim militants have

been waging an insurgency in Indian-held Kash
mir. demanding either independence for the Mus
lim-majority region or union with Pakistan.
The hijackers and the three freed prisoners,
who were major figures in the Kashmiri insurgen
cy. have not been seen since the eight-day hijack
ing drama ended last Friday in Kandahar.
Pakistan says its border security has been put
on alert and the hijackers will be arrested if they
cross into Pakistan, a difficult task given the length
of the border and the multitude of access points
from neighboring Afghanistan.
Salahuddin, who also heads the radical Hezb
ul-Mujahcdeen. said the hijackers can remain in
Afghanistan in relative safety because the war
wracked nation already is ostracized.
The United Nations imposed sanctions on
Afghanistan on Nov. 14 to punish the ruling Tal
iban for giving shelter to Saudi dissident Osama
bin Laden, accused by the I Jnited States of bomb
ing its embassies in Africa in August 1998.
Salahuddin said neither Kashmiri militant
groups nor the Pakistani government was
involved in the hijacking.
"As a matter of policy, we condemn hijacking.

It's an international crime." he said.
He speculated that the hijackers may have
acted independently to protest India's military
crackdown against the decade-long insurgency in
Kashmir. International human rights groups, Pak
istan and militant Islamic groups have sharply crit
icized India's heavy handed approach to Kashmir,
charging massive human rights violations.
In Islamabad, meanwhile. Pakistani officials
demanded that India make public information it
claims to have on the hijackers' identities.
India says the hijackers arc Pakistani, although
they were masked throughout the ordeal. India
also has accused the Pakistani government of
being involved in the hijacking. Pakistan has
strongly condemned the hijacking and denied
involvement.
"Fabrication of allegations without a shred of
evidence is reprehensible." a foreign ministry
statement said.
India's home minister. L.K. Advani. said India
has "irrefutable evidence of Pakistan's involve
ment in cross-border terrorism and in this particu
lar hijacking." He said India has not yet offered
the prwf to other countries.
