## Editor's Notebook A
						commercial Co Ho 
### 
Hopefully students will
breathe old atmosphere
into new setting

I guess it started with a health
conscious joint called Jamba
Juice. Then they took a
respectable Mexican food estab
lishment, renamed it The Tree
house, and started serving assort
ed burgers. With today's opening
of a Coffee House that serves
Starbucks Coffee, the yuppie-iza
tion of Tresidder Union is com
plete.
As a senior who has come to the
Coffee House many a time over
the past three years to meet a
classmate, see a small band per
form or seek "liquid sleep" in the
form of a mocha, it was a little
awkward for me to walk in and see
the track lighting, the sharp
Formica counter and the neat new
tables and chairs.
"Oh, the place doesn't look like
a dump anymore!" said a girl who
I hope was an underclassman and
didn't know any better.
I don't know about you, but I
kind of liked the Co Ho when it
was a dump. Or at least I didn't
have many complaints about it. It
had a great homey feel, a place to
kick back and let the chatter, the
wall art and the occasional guitar
or piano player take you away
from the world of books and
midterms. It was tough finding
space on the beat-up couches at
times, but as long as I got my caf
feine it was cool.
Okay, so maybe I'm being a lit
tle harsh on the new Coffee

House, since the students haven't
really had enough time to proper
ly breathe life into it. I actually
don't mind the new look, as long
as it's still a fun place to hang out.
Maybe the shine of the white-tile
ceiling will combine with the cof
fee to help wake me up on long
nights.
And thankfully the manage
ment decided to keep some ele
ments of the old decor. Some of
the couches and lacquered wood
en tables remain, as does one of
the big murals. There's still a piano
and a raised area for performing.
The menu shouldn't be much
different, either. 1 caught a
glimpse of some shiny new equip
ment in the kitchen, so my guess is
that they'll be cooking up more
than the standard club .sandwich
es. The list of bottled alcohol and
beer on tap looks longer than
before. And I'm sure Starbucks
will provide a wide array of caf
feinated products.
So throw in a hundred or so
kids on a hopping weeknighl
(open until 2 a.m.!), allow a week
or two for adjustment to the new
furniture, and the Coffee House
should return to "business as
usual." The Stanford Concert Net
work might even start booking
acts by the end of the quarter.
It reeks just a little of commer
cialism, but the CoHo will hope
fully inspire good times as it
always has. Besides, how many
places can you think of that serve
Starbucks lattes and Newcastle
Ale from the same counter?
