# Meaning in the macro
## Sasha Polonsky Christmas-Past and New Technology 
### 
Before the lofty and
inspired New
Year's resolutions
arrived with cross-the
hoard re definitions of the
self for the next great mil
lennium, the gift season
reigned like never before.

A brand new thousand years suddenly at
our disposal called fora more advanced
technology of gilt-giving, an excuse to go
all-out.
My visits to Massachusetts malls or win
dow shopping on the Upper West side of
Manhattan revealed nonchalant shoppers
shelling out for new flat-screen computers.
Direct"TV, DVDs, PDAs and all kinds of
other pricey play-toys. And I had to ask,
will half these people really know how to
use the stuff?
In my house, the gift-giving ritual was a
bit of a maverick. My Jewish and open
minded parents have always struggled with
their approach to the holiday season. Some
how our sorry show of "festival of lights" in
the kitchen window has characteristically
been overshadowed by the colored displays
and festive Santa decor Haunted across our
neighbors' shrubbery.
This year we actually had to talk my
father out of calling the house across the
street to suggest that they let Santa know he
was 110 longer obligated to his perch 011
their roof. After all, Christmas had passed,
and nobody likes working overtime.
My parents hoped to engender some
sense of Jewish value throughout progres
sive seasons of Yule tide in my childhood.
At the same time, they always worried that
my sister and I would feel excluded from
the holiday excitement with no Christmas
tree and no stockings filled with special
treats from a white-bearded benefactor in
red velvet.
Santa may have bypassed the Polonsky
household time and time again, but fora
lew years of my youth we did experiment

with the Christmas tree as a complement to
the much-acclaimed menorah. This was
cause for some religious introspection and
improvisation, but mostly it was just an arti
ficial displacement of the Chanukah calen
dar to a date that worked with the Chris
tians as well.
Fora few years we tried different
approaches. After my Bat Mitzvah we
nixed the tree and tried alternating
Chanukah gift-giving days. Four family
members meant each person had two nights
to be responsible for presents.
This method worked until we became
too lazy to do individual shopping. Our sub
sequent approach was a family trip to the
mall on Dec. 26, in time for the sale extrav
aganzas and after the historical commemo
ration of the Macabees.
The prospect of Year 2(KM) invited new
creativity. We decided to pick out our own
presents and to buy en masse.
My parents chose new twin cell phones.
This was partially out of desire to enter the
new year technologically more sound and
partially a way to replace my father's prized
two-pound Sprint PCS which I managed to
lose somewhere in a Boston bar.
The phone-choosing process on Christ
mas Eve was relatively painless. Challenges
came with programming the new identical
phones, which seemed to me to have a
rather intuitive design.
My sister and 1 played around and quick
ly managed to change the screens to French,
sound a variety of different alarms and set
our numbers 011 speed dial. With each
move, our parents demanded instruction
and then needed to see it repeated several
times. They were dumbstruck with our
immediate skill.
I sat in the kitchen laboriously re-pro
gramming numbers after my father realized
he had labeled each phone with the wrong
name (my mother had wanted the number
easier to remember). Suddenly, the house
phone rang and my mother yelled, "Wait!

Don't answer that; it's me!"
That was not the last time she acciden
tally called a number in a failed effort to
change the ringer sound.
The best was in the car driving to New
York. My father turned on the radar
machine, and my mom answered her phone
in a frantic leap. "Hello? Hello! There's
nobody there, 1 don't understand," she said
as we howled from the back seat.
I worried that 1 was crippling my parents'
sense of technological mastery in making
such a joke out of their unease. But it didn't
stop with phones.
While watching a movie, my mother
kept barking commands like, "Turn the vol
ume up! Can you rewind that?" when the
clicker was right next to her chair. She has
never dared to program the VCR.
I think the clincher was the Sunday night
when she realized she had a 7:30 a.m. Mon
day patient and needed to set her alarm
clock because my dad was away at a confer
ence.
"Sash, could you set my clock for 6:45
a.m.?" she asked me. I told her to do it her
self.
"But I don't know how."
Technophobia at its apogee. A doctor
who doesn't know how to set her alarm
clock. I had to laugh.
But suddenly I wondered if this is in fact
that rare, or if the technophobe will be me
in several years, swallowed in a sea of dot
coms and Internet fever.
This prophecy will likely come to fruition
in time for my kids to berate me for my lack
of techno-savvy. But while I am still above
water, 1 recognize the need to indulge. Uno
riginal as it is, 1 think I'm ready for my own
cell phone.

column of the new year to Alka, Cris and
Karen, the lovely senior women of an incred
ible staff.
