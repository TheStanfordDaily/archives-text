### Jonathan Stull Jim Tankersley Staff writers 
January brings a sigh of relief for the
Pacific 10 Conference.
A tumultuous lall football season
lowlightcd by a series ot miserable non
conference showings and Pac-10 losses in
tour ol five bowl games — cost the
league national respect. Men's basket
ball. which begins its conference cam
paign this weekend, offers a chance to
win it back.

10. Washington State
Coach of the Year:

What better sport to bring the Pac-I()
out of a slump? Ihe league's men's
hoops teams enjoyed a solid deeade in
the '90s, winning two national titles and
sending four teams to the Final Four.
And it enters 2000 with the No. ! and No.
5 teams in the country.
National commentators are already
tabbing the Pac-10 one of the top confer
ences in the NCAA. Bui their predic
tions — and the league's fortunes — rest
largely on the strength of two teams.
Stanford and Arizona figure to turn
the Pac-10 into the Pac-2 this year thanks
to their young talent and the schizo
phrenic nature of the rest of the league.
Both the Wildcats and the Cardinal
are stocked with athletic underclassmen,
giving them balanced, up-tempo attacks.
Arizona's starting five hold a slight edge
in talent, but Stanford counters with
depth and senior leadership.
I'he rest ol the conference is anyone's
guess. UCLA, which two months ago
looked like a conference title contender,
has fallen into shambles due to inconsis
tent play and the loss ol star Jaßon Rush
to NCAA suspension. Oregon could
make .i postseason push, but the Ducks
fell out of the l op 25 after a home loss to
Fresno State.
I'he bottom six squads will likely fight
f(i>r Nil bids. Cal is overachieving, USC
iS talented but untested, Arizona State is
iiji Fddie I louse. Oregon State is incon
sistent. and the Washington schools
etwld be lucky to break double-digits in
combined conference wins.

Youth will prevail in the league, with
freshmen playing key roles at Stanford,
Arizona, California and UCLA. And
parity among lower teams should make
for exciting games (and a big upset or
two).
Most of all. the Pac-10 needs its top
teams to make strong showings in the
NCAA tournament in order to wash
away the taste of the 19W football season
once and for all. Here's how the league
should shake out, in expected order of
finish:
1. Stanford (11-0) — The Cardinal will
not finish the year undefeated, even if
loopy fox Sports analyst George Ravel
ing says so. But with its unmatched inside
strength and solid outside shooting,
Stanford will still do enough to come
awav with its second straight Pac-10 title.
While Mike McDonald has done a
serviceable job replacing Art Lee at
point guard, hew ill probably have to step
up his game for the Cardinal to prevail.
However, with All-American forward
Mark Madsen back in the mix. McDon
ald might not have to worry about doing
much. In Madsen's absence, head coach
Mike Montgomery has done a great job
of using the towering Collins twins and
energetic freshman Curtis Borchardt
down low. With freshman Casey Jacob
sen. senior David Moseley and junior
Ryan Mendez hitting from outside, this
team is tough to stop.
2. Arizona (11-2) — Three years ago. a
young Wildcat team finished fifth in the
Pac-10. But, led by freshman point guard
Mike Bibby, the senior-less team upset
three No. 1 seeds in the NCAA tourna
ment to win the National Championship.
This season Arizona will likely finish
much higher than fifth. However, with a
similar team that starts two freshman,
two sophomores and a junior, the Wild
eats could once more walk away with the
NCA A crown.
Coach Lute Olson does not have
much bench to work with, but he does
have a wealth of talent in the starting
lineup. Power forward Michael Wright
will contend for Conference Player of
the Year honors and freshmen guards
Jason Gardner and Gilbert Arenas al
ready comprise the Pac-10's top back
court.
Dates vs. Stanford: Jan. S. March 9 in
Tucson
3. Oregon (K-2) — The Ducks, tradition
ally tough at home on Mac Arthur Court,
may finally have become a good road
team with wins over Gonzaga and Wake
Forest in the Rainbow Classic. The
Ducks will have a chance in every con
ference game they play this year and
should make the NCAA tournament
easily.
Guard Alex Scales and senior for
ward A.D. Smith, who averaged 21.7

points over three games in the Classic,
lead one of the most athletic Oregon at
tacks in recent memory.
Dates vs. Stanford: Jan. 15 in Lugene.
Feb. 10.
4. UCLA (K-2) — I he Bruins may only
have two losses, but I his storied program
is teetering on the brink. I very year head
coach Steve Lavin brings in the best play
ers, and every year his team falls short,
sometimes far short ol expectations.
UCLA still has ample opportunity to
salvage its season, and with its un
matched talent, it still might. However,
after losses to Gonzaga and Colorado
State and awful wins over South Florida.

Pepperdine and Purdue, the team's
morale is in 'doubt. In faet, forward
Jerome Moiso said postgame that it the
Bruins had lost to Pepperdine — they es
caped with a controversial two-point vic
tory — he would have quit the team.
While point guard Larl Watson has
been up-and-down trying to replace
NBA lottery pick Baron Davis, it has
been freshman Jason Kapono who has
provided the poise and continuity. For
UCLA to do well, he might even have to
step in as coach.
Dates vs. Stanford: Feb. 3 in Los An-
