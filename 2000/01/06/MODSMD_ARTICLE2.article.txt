# Revamped Tresidder eateries open
## Co Ho brewing; Polio Rey now The Treehouse 
### Keith Ito 
With the long-awaited re-open
ing of the Coffee House and the re
birth of Polio Rey as The Treehouse,
students returning from winter
break are discovering a revitalized
Tresidder Student Union.
The Coffee House is set to re
open its doors today after nearly
seven months of renovation work
that has given it a new look.
Many of the changes can be seen
as soon as one walks in the door. The
walls are now a light beige color and
the room is illuminated by a recessed
lighting system. New flooring and
carpeting have been installed, and
lower countertops were designed for
wheelchair access.
However, the original tables and
murals have been retained in an at
tempt to preserve some of the old at
mosphere. In addition, a counter
with electrical outlets was added so
that students can plug in laptop com
puters. Bon Appetit is also planning
on adding network access from this
counter.
The direction of traffic flow
through the Coffee House has been
reversed: the cash registers and deli
sandwiches are located near the
White Plaza entrance, while the
espresso machines and beer taps are
at the Tresidder back patio en
trance.
This new layout is designed to de
crease congestion around the
counter and reduce the amount of

time that students spend waiting for
their orders to be filled.
The Coffee House has also re
ceived funds to purchase a big
screen television, which is scheduled
to arrive next week.
"It seems like a nice place," said
first-year graduate student Magnus
Alnigrem as he looked in the win
dow. "Palo Alto is sometimes too far
away, and we need an escape on
campus."
But some students do not share
Almgrem's enthusiasm, and wonder
whether a hit of Stanford tradition
was lost in t he change.

"It looks like it lost a lot of its at
mosphere," said sophomore Linsey
Mallory. "It used to have a nice char
acter, but now it looks really imper
sonal. It's been mainstreamed, I
guess."
With the Coffee House open
daily until 2 a.m. under the new
"Stanford After Midnight" initia
tive, returning students will once
again have a place to hang out on
campus, and members of the fresh
man class will get their first opportu
nity to experience this part of Stan
ford tradition.
"I'm looking forward to it be

cause we need a place on campus to
hang out." said freshman Farzad
Solcimani. "I'm also always looking
fora coffee place that's open that
late."
The Coffee House was originally
scheduled to re-open at the begin
ning of fall quarter. However, the
regulator) process added an unex
pected delay to the construction
process. Although actual construc
tion took just 64 days, Bon Appetit,
the catering company that runs the
Coffee I louse, spent more than five
