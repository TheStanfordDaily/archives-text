# Revamped Tresidder eateries open
## Co Ho brewing; Polio Rey now The Treehouse 
### Keith Ito 
With the long-awaited re-open
ing of the Coffee House and the re
birth of Polio Rey as The Treehouse,
students returning from winter
break are discovering a revitalized
Tresidder Student Union.
The Coffee House is set to re
open its doors today after nearly
seven months of renovation work
that has given it a new look.
Many of the changes can be seen
as soon as one walks in the door. The
walls are now a light beige color and
the room is illuminated by a recessed
lighting system. New flooring and
carpeting have been installed, and
lower countertops were designed for
wheelchair access.
However, the original tables and
murals have been retained in an at
tempt to preserve some of the old at
mosphere. In addition, a counter
with electrical outlets was added so
that students can plug in laptop com
puters. Bon Appetit is also planning
on adding network access from this
counter.
The direction of traffic flow
through the Coffee House has been
reversed: the cash registers and deli
sandwiches are located near the
White Plaza entrance, while the
espresso machines and beer taps are
at the Tresidder back patio en
trance.
This new layout is designed to de
crease congestion around the
counter and reduce the amount of

time that students spend waiting for
their orders to be filled.
The Coffee House has also re
ceived funds to purchase a big
screen television, which is scheduled
to arrive next week.
"It seems like a nice place," said
first-year graduate student Magnus
Alnigrem as he looked in the win
dow. "Palo Alto is sometimes too far
away, and we need an escape on
campus."
But some students do not share
Almgrem's enthusiasm, and wonder
whether a hit of Stanford tradition
was lost in t he change.

"It looks like it lost a lot of its at
mosphere," said sophomore Linsey
Mallory. "It used to have a nice char
acter, but now it looks really imper
sonal. It's been mainstreamed, I
guess."
With the Coffee House open
daily until 2 a.m. under the new
"Stanford After Midnight" initia
tive, returning students will once
again have a place to hang out on
campus, and members of the fresh
man class will get their first opportu
nity to experience this part of Stan
ford tradition.
"I'm looking forward to it be

cause we need a place on campus to
hang out." said freshman Farzad
Solcimani. "I'm also always looking
fora coffee place that's open that
late."
The Coffee House was originally
scheduled to re-open at the begin

process. Although actual construc
tion took just 64 days, Bon Appetit,
the catering company that runs the
Coffee I louse, spent more than five

months getting the necessary per
mits in a complex process that in
volved the University zoning office
and county officials.
"We went around and around
about five times before we got
everyone to agree on the plans," said
Matthew Alameda, general manag
er of Bon Appetit. "We did our best
to get [the Coffee HouseJ back as
fast as we could because we know
how much students missed having us
here."
Also in the hopes of increasing ef
ficiency, the kitchen space was ex
panded. and a new refrigerator and

food preparation areas were in
stalled.
The changes also bring the Cof
fee House up to standards set forth
in the Americans with Disabilities
Act and state and local building
codes. The lower counters, wider
aisles, fire sprinklers and low-energy
lights make the Coffee House com
pliant with various regulations.
Along with the renovation, Bon
Appetit contracted with new ven
dors for food and beverages. The
Coffee House will serve Starbucks
coffee instead of Java City coffee to
provide variety. In addition, it will
begin serving Boar's Head deli
meats and Tea & Company teas.
Despite the move to bigger-name
suppliers. Almeida said that the Cof

fee House will remain in the hands
of students, with more than half of its
staff hired from the student body.
Also returning are the nightly
performances that made the Coffee
House a popular student hangout.
Several bands have been booked for
tomorrow night, and Monday night
will mark the return of the Jazz Jam
Session.
Plans to renovate the Coffee
1 louse were first proposed five years
ago. Focus groups organized by the
Tresidder Advisory Board worked
out the details. The board is com
posed of students, administrators
and members of the Stanford Man
agement Company, which partially
funded the renovation with Bon Ap
petit.

The revamped Coffee House is
not the only change to hit Tresidder
in recent days. About two weeks ago
the Mexican restaurant previously
known as Polio Rey changed its
name to The Treehouse as a result of
a contest sponsored by the ASSU. In
addition to the name change, the
restaurant added hamburgers, fries
and wings to the menu and reduced
prices to reflect the desires of the
student population.
The restaurant also plans on in
stalling a new counter and a big
screen television.
"We just listened to what the stu
dents wanted," said Erick Ciuzman,
catering coordinator at the Tree
house. " The only reason we're at
Stanford is because of the students."

aisles, fire sprinklers and low-energy
lights make the Coffee House com
pliant with various regulations.
Along with the renovation, Bon
Appetit contracted with new ven
dors for food and beverages. The
Coffee House will serve Starbucks
coffee instead of Java City coffee to
provide variety. In addition, it will
begin serving Boar's Head deli
meats and Tea & Company teas.
Despite the move to bigger-name
suppliers. Almeida said that the Cof

fee House will remain in the hands
of students, with more than half of its
staff hired from the student body.
Also returning are the nightly
performances that made the Coffee
House a popular student hangout.
Several bands have been booked for

Plans to renovate the Coffee
1 louse were first proposed five years
ago. Focus groups organized by the
Tresidder Advisory Board worked
out the details. The board is com
posed of students, administrators
and members of the Stanford Man
agement Company, which partially
funded the renovation with Bon Ap
petit.

The revamped Coffee House is
not the only change to hit Tresidder
in recent days. About two weeks ago
the Mexican restaurant previously
known as Polio Rey changed its
name to The Treehouse as a result of
a contest sponsored by the ASSU. In
addition to the name change, the
restaurant added hamburgers, fries
and wings to the menu and reduced
prices to reflect the desires of the
student population.
The restaurant also plans on in
stalling a new counter and a big
screen television.
"We just listened to what the stu
dents wanted," said Erick Ciuzman,
catering coordinator at the Tree
house. " The only reason we're at
Stanford is because of the students."
