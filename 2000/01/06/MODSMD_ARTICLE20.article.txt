Months away from March Madness, with the presea
son out of the way, the eyes of the college basketball
world will turn to Maples Pavilion this Saturday. The
steady Stanford Cardinal, undefeated and ranked No. 1
in the nation, will welcome the flashy Arizona Wildcats,
the fifth-ranked team in the country that features what
could be college basketball's most talented starting line

But if the Cardinal plans on going into that marquee
matchup with momentum, Stanford (11-0) will have to
make sure the house doesn't go up in flames against Ari
zona State (8-3) tonight in its Pacific 10 Conference sea
son-opener.
In fact, Stanford's defense, which is holding oppo
nents to an NCAA-low 31.1 percent shooting percent
age. might literally have to throw water on the Sun Dev
ils' stellar Eddie House. The junior guard, averaging
more than 35 points per game in his last four contests, is
as close to on fire as a player can get.
"House is one of those guys that if you don't mind
your p's and q's he can go and get 50 on you, and he's
dang near done that twice," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery, referring to recent games in which
1 louse scored 46 and 42 points. "When he gets to feeling
it and gets the ball where he wants to. he's virtually un
stoppable."
But stop him is just what the Cardinal must do. Cer
tainly, Stanford has looked at tapes of Arizona State
playing Brigham Young earlier this season. In a 78-67
kiss to the Cougars. House took 16 shots and missed
them all.
While that tape might be encouraging for Stanford
coaches, I louse's next outing might look more like a hor
ror flick. Against San Diego State, House hit fora
school-record 46 points, 37 of which came in the first half.
Arizona State's biggest problem is that if House is in
effective. the team is too — all three of ASU's losses
have occurred when House scored less than 20 points.
The Sun Devils have virtually no inside game and even
less when opposing defenses do not
have to extend themselves on the
perimeter to cover the mad bomber.
Stanford comes into the game on
a roll.
Of course, for the last few, Mont
gomery hasn't had to do much more
than start the engine as the Cardinal
has cruised to easy wins over peren
nial pushovers New I lampshire and
Davidson. But the games gave Stan
lord the chance to throw senior for
ward Mark Madsen back into the
mix. Madsen had been out with a
thigh injury suffered in the season
opener against Duke seven weeks
ago, but returned looking almost like
his old "Mad Dog" self. Against New
I lampshire, he scored 13 points and
pulled down eight rebounds.
"He's starting to get comfort
able," Montgomery said. "We're
starting to see a little bit of the old
competitiveness start to come out,
where he's slowly but surely mental
ly getting over the idea that he was in
jured and now starting to focus on
going and getting each and every
ball."
Even with Madsen back in action,
Arizona State is dangerous at
Maples. In the past few seasons, the
Sun Devils have played Stanford well
in Palo Alto. Two years ago, Arizona
State beat the then-No. 4 Cardinal,
yO-87, in overtime. Last season, the
Sun Devils were leading by two at

hall time before losing to Stanford 87-
77 in an intense, hard-fought game.
Arizona (11-2) also lost the last
game it played at Stanford. The Car
dinal ran away from the Wildcats and
Pac-1() Player of the Year Jason
Terry to clinch the school's first Pac
-10 title in one of Stanford's most an
ticipated games in years. Apparently,
the atmosphere made its impression
on Arizona's young players.
"Playing up there last year was a
learning experience for me," said
sophomore Michael Wright, a pre
season All-Conference pick. "Com
ing in as a freshman, I was kind of
amazed at how the crowd would
shake the floor and taunt us."
But don't expect Arizona's young
lineup to be intimidated. Starting a 7-
foot, I-inch junior transfer at center
in Loren Woods, two talented, ath
letic sophomores at forward in
Wright and Richard Jefferson and a
pair of freshman dubbed "Batman
and Robin" in the backcourt, head
coach Lute Olson has his best nation
al championship contender since...
well, two seasons ago.
The Arizona game is especially
important for Stanford to solidify its
national reputation because, though
the Wildcats have two losses, they
have played the tougher schedule by
far. Arizona has beaten No. 10 Michi
gan State, No. 16 Texas and No. 24
Kentucky and lost to No. 2 Connecti
cut.
And, more importantly, it's a con
ference game against Stanford's
biggest rival for the league title

But if the Cardinal plans on going into that marquee
matchup with momentum, Stanford (11-0) will have to
make sure the house doesn't go up in flames against Ari
zona State (8-3) tonight in its Pacific 10 Conference sea
son-opener.
In fact, Stanford's defense, which is holding oppo
nents to an NCAA-low 31.1 percent shooting percent
age. might literally have to throw water on the Sun Dev
ils' stellar Eddie House. The junior guard, averaging
more than 35 points per game in his last four contests, is
as close to on fire as a player can get.
"House is one of those guys that if you don't mind
your p's and q's he can go and get 50 on you, and he's
dang near done that twice," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery, referring to recent games in which
1 louse scored 46 and 42 points. "When he gets to feeling
it and gets the ball where he wants to. he's virtually un
stoppable."
But stop him is just what the Cardinal must do. Cer
tainly, Stanford has looked at tapes of Arizona State
playing Brigham Young earlier this season. In a 78-67
kiss to the Cougars. House took 16 shots and missed
them all.
While that tape might be encouraging for Stanford
coaches, I louse's next outing might look more like a hor
ror flick. Against San Diego State, House hit fora
school-record 46 points, 37 of which came in the first half.
Arizona State's biggest problem is that if House is in
effective. the team is too — all three of ASU's losses
have occurred when House scored less than 20 points.
The Sun Devils have virtually no inside game and even
less when opposing defenses do not
have to extend themselves on the
perimeter to cover the mad bomber.
Stanford comes into the game on
a roll.
Of course, for the last few, Mont
gomery hasn't had to do much more
than start the engine as the Cardinal
has cruised to easy wins over peren
nial pushovers New I lampshire and
Davidson. But the games gave Stan
lord the chance to throw senior for
ward Mark Madsen back into the
mix. Madsen had been out with a
thigh injury suffered in the season
opener against Duke seven weeks
ago, but returned looking almost like
his old "Mad Dog" self. Against New
I lampshire, he scored 13 points and
pulled down eight rebounds.
"He's starting to get comfort
able," Montgomery said. "We're
starting to see a little bit of the old
competitiveness start to come out,
where he's slowly but surely mental
ly getting over the idea that he was in
jured and now starting to focus on
going and getting each and every
ball."
Even with Madsen back in action,
Arizona State is dangerous at
Maples. In the past few seasons, the
Sun Devils have played Stanford well
in Palo Alto. Two years ago, Arizona
State beat the then-No. 4 Cardinal,
yO-87, in overtime. Last season, the
Sun Devils were leading by two at

hall time before losing to Stanford 87-
77 in an intense, hard-fought game.
Arizona (11-2) also lost the last
game it played at Stanford. The Car
dinal ran away from the Wildcats and
Pac-1() Player of the Year Jason
Terry to clinch the school's first Pac
-10 title in one of Stanford's most an
ticipated games in years. Apparently,
the atmosphere made its impression
on Arizona's young players.
"Playing up there last year was a
learning experience for me," said
sophomore Michael Wright, a pre
season All-Conference pick. "Com
ing in as a freshman, I was kind of
amazed at how the crowd would
shake the floor and taunt us."
But don't expect Arizona's young
lineup to be intimidated. Starting a 7-
foot, I-inch junior transfer at center
in Loren Woods, two talented, ath
letic sophomores at forward in
Wright and Richard Jefferson and a
pair of freshman dubbed "Batman
and Robin" in the backcourt, head
coach Lute Olson has his best nation
al championship contender since...
well, two seasons ago.
The Arizona game is especially
important for Stanford to solidify its
national reputation because, though
the Wildcats have two losses, they
have played the tougher schedule by
far. Arizona has beaten No. 10 Michi
gan State, No. 16 Texas and No. 24
Kentucky and lost to No. 2 Connecti
cut.
And, more importantly, it's a con
ference game against Stanford's
biggest rival for the league title
