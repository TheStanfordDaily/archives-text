But if the Cardinal plans on going into that marquee
matchup with momentum, Stanford (11-0) will have to
make sure the house doesn't go up in flames against Ari
zona State (8-3) tonight in its Pacific 10 Conference sea
son-opener.
In fact, Stanford's defense, which is holding oppo

more than 35 points per game in his last four contests, is
as close to on fire as a player can get.
"House is one of those guys that if you don't mind

school-record 46 points, 37 of which came in the first half.
Arizona State's biggest problem is that if House is in
effective. the team is too — all three of ASU's losses
have occurred when House scored less than 20 points.
The Sun Devils have virtually no inside game and even
