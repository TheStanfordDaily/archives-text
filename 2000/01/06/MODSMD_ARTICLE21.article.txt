MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
â–  Today-Tomorrow: Stanford at the
UC-Santa Barbara Collegiate Tour
nament, Santa Barbara, Calif.

At the beginning of last season,
the team lost All-Americans Gabe
Gardner and Andy Witt along with
teammates Robin Lamb and Larry
Witt. However, what remained of
the team persevered and posted a
10-12 record with a respectable
fifth-place finish in the Pacific Divi
sion of the Moutain Pacific Sports
Federation, a conference tradition
ally strong in men's volleyball.
This season, the team faces an
other set of unexpected hurdles due
to injuries incurred in the presea
son. Captain Josh Palacios. who is
the sole senior on the squad, is out
indefinitely due to a shoulder in
jury. Junior setter Brad Griffith is
most likely out for the season as a
result of torn ligaments in his knee.
The injuries leave the team with
a young, inexperienced squad and
give junior Josh I ukens sole re
sponsibility of the setter position.
Although the injuries come as a

disappointment, head coach Ruben
Nieves and his team are trying to
stay positive, as the\ have with ob
stacles of the past.
Redshirt freshman and outside
hitter Scth Ring noted the positive
effects of last year's truncated
squad.
"Last year's departures gave
other players valuable playing ex
periences for this year." he said.
"They were great players, but when
they left, it opened up positions for
others to gel that experience."
That experience will prove ad
vantageous for this season as the
team is again forced to play short
handed.
Nieves admits that carrying only
one setter, which is the most spe
cialized and technical position on
the court, could be risky this season.
And should Lukens get injured,
"the drop-off would be significant."
But there are also some positive
aspects. Every player will get used
to playing with the same setter and
Lukens will receive repetitions in
training and playing important to
the game.
"We just have to keep our fin
gers crossed and deal with it in a
positive way. which the team is
doing, and then we will be success
ful." Nieves said. "In a short
amount of time, the team has really
come together on and off the court

and have formed a solid team spir
it."
Working together will be impor
tant this season fora young team
not laden with individual standouts.
"In the past we've had strong in
dividuals." Ring said. "This year
our strength will be in how well we
play as a team."
The team returns only four unin
jured players with collegiate experi
ence: juniors Lukens, outside hitter
Curtis Graham, and middle blocker
Brett Youngberg as well as sopho
more outside hitter Marcus Skacel.
Joining the returnees are eight
players with freshman status, in
cluding top recruit, middle blocker
Curt Toppel. Toppel. a Pacific Pal
isades. Calif., native who earned
two Mission League Most Valuable
Player awards at Loyola High
School, is also a member of the U.S.
Junior National Team.
"Curt did some things on the
court this fall that no one else on
this team can do." Nieves said.
"Our expectations for him are high
and his expectations for himself are
even higher. He's a big part of the
offense."
Nieves also looks to Ring as a
promising talent for his debut on
the court this season.
"Seth really emerged during the
fall as a key player," Nieves said.
"He has real leadership qualities,

which is exceptional fora young
player. He will handle the serve-re
ceives along with Marcus. It's one of
the most pressure responsibilites,
but he is ready to make that step.
He benefited greatly from redshirt
ing, and he is much more prepared
now."
Along with the eight new faces
on the court this season, the team
will also have to adjust to a new po
sition. The position of the libero
makes its men's collegiate volley
ball debut this season. The libero
plays just in the back row and is not
allowed to attack the net or serve.
"It's like a designated hitter in
baseball." Nieves said. "It gives
everybody a lot more flexibility and
it is easier fora player who is not
complete to have an impact."
Nieves is considering redshirt
freshman Jon Palacios for the posi
tion.
Despite the changes for the team
this season, Nieves says the men
can't get caught up in the obstacles,
but rather it needs to face the chal
lenges. and he is confident that his
young team can do just that.
"We're not ranked, which is new
for us, but it doesn't surprise us."
Nieves said. "In order to be success
ful we absolutely need to improve
steadilv, we have to be one of the
