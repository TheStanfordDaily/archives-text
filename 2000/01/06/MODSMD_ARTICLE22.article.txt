I larry Press never stops working
for journalism at Stanford.
A Daily managing editor from
1938-1939, associate editor of the
Stanford News Service lor 20 years,
editor of the Stanford Observer,
and JohnS. Knight Fellowship man
aging director for 21 years, Press,
Class of' 39. has spent most of his life
improving the quality of reporting
at Stanford.
Now. he aims to do so again
through a scholarship with Stanford
philanthropist Lorry Lokey.
Known as the I larry Press / Lorry
Lokey Stanford Daily Staff Award,
the grant gives $2.(XM) to an out
standing Daily scholar between his
or her junior and senior years. Re
cipients can use the grant to assist in
obtaining journalism internships.
"The Daily turns out a lot of fine
young professionals," Press said. He
said he hopes the award will "help
someone determined to be a long
time journalist."
Lokey, Class of '49, has be
stowed several such endowments
upon Stanford in honor of faculty
and students who aided in his pro
fessional development. "Lokey is a
very good friend to Stanford." Press
said.
Soon after entering Stanford in
1944, Lokey was drafted and sent to
Japan at the close of World War 11.
While there, he wrote for the mili
tary newspaper Stars and Stripes.
Upon returning to Stanford, he
said he immersed himself in The
Daily. "It showed in my grades," he
admitted.
After graduating, I .okey worked
as a night wire editor for United
Press and eventually started Busi
ness Wire, a corporate wire service.
"Lokey felt somewhere along his
way of development as a newspa

perman. I had helped him," recalled
Press, who knew I .okey profession
ally and as a close friend.
When Lokey wanted to honor
Press through a Stanford endow
ment, Press was "flattered" and
chose to award the money to Daily
writers.
"The Daily was just about my
whole life at Stanford," Press said.
"I wasn't much of a student — but I
got out."
Press said that during his stint at
The Daily, there were no internship
opportunities. After graduating
from Stanford, Press found work as
a copy boy at the San Francisco
Chronicle.
After World War 11, Press
worked for the San Francisco News,
the San Francisco News Call-Bul
letin and the San Francisco Examin
er. He recalls this time fondly, espe
cially the "marvelous competition"
and "great newspapering" in the
days when San Francisco was home
to four daily newspapers.
"We were friends and competi
tors — hard-nosed competitors,"
Press reminisced.
In I9(#> Press returned to Stan
ford as associate editor of the News
Service and editor of the Stanford
Observer, a monthly alumni news
paper (now Stanford Magazine). In
1968 lie became managing director
of the Knight Fellows. 1 le held these
positions until the late 1980s.
Robin Tenold, director of alum
ni relations for The Daily, expressed
admiration for Press.
"He's been an active alumni
member with The Daily for 50
years," Tenold said. "He's got some
great stories about The Daily and
everything else."
Tenold said she believed the
award would "really open the door
for older staff writers" to follow in
Press' footsteps
