seems to be tiring of
his mundane child
hood existence and is
increasingly intrigued
by the hippie lifestyle.
A "sophisticated"

new friend and frequent hitchhiking trips to
nearby beach and canyon communities intro
duce Ben to the exciting world of drugs and
free love.
The book's title stems from the list of sins
Ben's friend Graham, a new Catholic, col
lects to ensure he has enough to reveal during
his confessions. Intrigued by the concept of
keeping a diary of sins, Ben begins to keep
lists of his own sins, good deeds and "really
good" deeds. Initially, the concept of record
ing sins sparks deep reflection in the reader,
but by the end of the book, one becomes ex
hausted by the constant references to Ben's
lists.
Early on, we discover that Ben's sins and
good deeds are complexly intertwined. Ben
and Graham are exploring the sewers when
they come across the body of an unconscious
woman named Vickie. Eventually Ben and
another friend, Jackson, rescue her, but not
before Ben has explored her genital and nip
ple piercings, which he discovered in the
process of checking her breathing. After the
dramatic rescue, Vickie gives Ben and Jack
son a sexual lOU. At first, they are reluctant,

but very tempted to make good on her
promise.
Sexual temptation seems to haunt Ben
throughout this story. His girlfriend, Connie,
is dying of cancer and becomes pregnant with
his child. At the same time as he feels a pity
ing love for her, Ben also feels great desire for
Vickie, whom he later discovers is a prosti
tute. He also falls half in love with Frannie, a
hippie he meets in the canyon.
By the end of the novel, Ben says goodbye
to all three and embarks on a new and health
ier relationship. Unfortunately, the constant
memories of Ben's prior relationships,
graphically and sometimes insensitively cap
tured by Sobel, leave one wary of caring
about what will happen next in Ben's love
life.
Despite Ben's good deeds and intentions,
his "sins" begin to pile up by the end of the
novel, and there arc only so many times one
"can think a deed is not the most admirable
but can understand how someone would do
something like that." Also, because these as
pects of the '60s have been explored so often
that they have become cliche, this reminis
cence seems a bit stale.
Frannie, upon her departure from "Col
lecting Sins," comments sadly how the excite
ment of the hippie era seems to have passed
her by. She is left only with the remnants of
the true passion of the various movements of
the '60s. Likewise, Sobel is merely able to
capture the leftovers of an era already mag
nificently captured by other writers before
him.
