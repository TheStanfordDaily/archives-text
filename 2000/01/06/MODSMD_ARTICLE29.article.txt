fects on the emotionally beleaguered
daughter. While the movie is refresh
ing because of its talented cast, its plot
line and ending leave something to be
desired.
The movie starts off depicting the
whimsical Mary Jo Walker
(McTeer), who is constantly quitting
jobs and relocating with little plan
ning or thought for Ava (Brown).
The two eventually end up in Califor
nia after deciding that its beaches are
nice. En route, a truck driver named
Jack Ranson (Gavin O'Connor)
stops to help the stranded duo, and
Mary Jo flirts with him in the open,
which disgusts her jaded daughter.
In California, Mary Jo sees Jack by
chance at a bar, and the two move in
together. Ava gets settled into school
and really takes a liking to drama and
her new friends. Jack turns out to be a
dud — he is oppressive and tempera
mental, especially with Ava. Ava

hates her mom's boyfriend becausc
he is so quick to anger and she docs
not see why her mom likes him. This
dynamic marks the movie and pro
vides emotional texture.
The problem with "Tumble
weeds" is its rash ending, which might
reflect Mary Jo's character. Jay 0.
Sanders is introduced as Dan Miller, a
widowed husband whose kindness to
Ava saves the mother and daughter
from Jack's aggressive attitude. The
movie leaves the viewer wondering
what has been achieved, if anything.
That is, will the mother and daughter
continue to live in California? Has the
mother settled down? Is the daughter
happy, or even satisfied?
On the other hand, McTeer and
Brown give memorable, genuine per
formances as mother and daughter.
O'Connor embodies male impu
dence and insensitivity perfectly. His
directing is not especially noteworthy,
although his sparse sets and extensive
use of natural lighting work well to
show the blandness of the surround
ings and give the movie its tone of in
constancy and evanescence. He has
constructed a very blue-collar, de
pressing misery in many shots, to
manifest the depression Ava goes
through in living with Jack.
While the ending does not work
entirely, the movie is sure to be a hi;
with female audiences becausc of its
premise and strong emotional fire
works set off by the talented cast.
