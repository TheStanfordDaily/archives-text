### Corinne Yates Contributing writer 
Business School student and former Juno On
line senior vice president Matthew Battles has
been named as a defendant in a sexual harassment
lawsuit against the Juno Online service, according
to various news services.
Former Juno software engineer Lori Park filed
the lawsuit in New York on New. 26. She sued for
$10 million in damages.
Park, 25, allegedly dated Battles while she
worked at the New York-based Juno. Her claim
said Battles was abusive toward her and that he
told her she would be fired if she broke up with him.
A police report filed by Park in July 1999 is at

tachcd to the complaint. It alleged that Battles
dragged her down Manhattan's Ninth Avenue,
slapped her and punched her in the stomach. Park
resigned from Juno that same month.
The lawsuit also says that Battles made sexual
remarks about other female employees. Park said
when she complained to the human resources de
partment, a Juno executive took her into a room
lor eight hours and "harangued and abused" her.
Park said "the entire atmosphere was sexually
charged." She also alleged that there were no
women in upper management, that she was not in
vited to the same meetings as the men in her group
and that she was paid less than men who had the
same job.
Juno, however, denies the allegations.

A statement made by Juno said, "We are confi
dent that Juno treated Ms. Lori Park in a profes
sional manner while Ms. Park was our employee.
Our firm has strict policies and procedures to pro
tect our employees against any mistreatment in the
workplace."
Battles could not he reached for comment. Ac
cording to CNET.com, Battles is no longer with
Juno.
Park was not the first to make claims of sexual
harassment against Juno. Four months earlier, in
August 1999, former employee Lisa Bongiorno
also filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Juno
for $10 million. She alleged that she was fired from
Juno within 10 days of ending a sexu
al relationship with a manager.
"We believe the allegations in the
complaint are without merit, and we
deny them absolutely," Juno said in a
statement.
The company went on to say Bon
giorno was fired because of "issues
related to her job performance" and
that the decision was"in accordance
with company policy."
Juno wishes to dismiss Bon
giorno's lawsuit on the grounds of ar
bitration.
Park also signed an employee
agreement that had an arbitration
clause, but she claimed that it should
be deemed invalid because she was
allegedly forced to sign it.
