# A 						wacky 'Kung Pao' evening in San Francisco
## 
### 
How was your break? I don't know about where
you went, but here the Christmas season seems
to dominate things, no matter how secularized it
may be. Depending on who you are, December may be a
time of celebration, depression or desperation.
But there are others who just feel left out. In San Fran
cisco, two of the oldest non-Christian communities — the
Jewish and Chinese — are among those for whom Christ
mas is more a business cycle than a holiday.

When Dec. 24 and
25 roll around, to replace
staying at home or attend
ing a nearly abandoned
movie theater, a new tra
dition has sprung up in the
'90s: "An Evening of

Kung Pao Kosher Comedy
Herbst Theatre
401 Van Ness Ave.
San Francisco
December 26

Kung Pao Kosher Comedy," at New Asia Restaurant in
Chinatown. Since 1993, Jews, Chinese and other ex-patri
ots of Christmas hype can enjoy a meal (or hors d'oeuvres
at the late show) and the comedy of several Jewish per
formers. For those who may be busy those nights, there's
an additional show at Herbst Theatre (this year held on
Dec. 26th). It was this show that I attended.
The show was entertaining, to say the least. However,
it goes a little heavy on the Jewish in-jokes, with its share
of jokes from and about the lesbian, gay and bisexual com
munity as well. The mistress of ceremonies, Lisa
Geduldig, a member of both communities, began the
show by warming up the audience — which included San
Francisco Mayor Willie Brown — with a number of jokes

about the Christmas season.
Then, local comic Dan Rothenberg did a set of obser
vational humor on various relevant topics — Christmas,
Jews, the Queer movement. Apparently, the only reason
for the name "queer" is to rhyme with "here," and Dan's
Jewish mother — when told he was moving on from an ex
boyfriend to a new girlfriend — asked, "So is she gay,
too?"
Next came Betsy Salkind — former staff writer for
"Roseanne" and the most interesting of the bunch — who
did a number of topical jokes with unique mannerisms but
stole the show with her impressions, primarily of wildlife
and Jewish life. Nicknamed "The Squirrel Lady," she
would be especially appreciated by residents of Stanford.
The evening closed with Carol Leifer, inspiration (and
writer) for Elaine on "Seinfeld." As one might expect of a
Seinfeld alum, her set was also peppered with observa
tional humor, ranging from gyms to Jewish families.
Overall, it was a good night, and even the gentiles
seemed to have a good time. Proceeds from the show
helped to benefit The Holocaust Center of Northern Cal
ifornia's Tolerance Education Program — a group edu
cating children about racism, past and present — and
Breast Cancer Action, which is an educational and ad
vocative grassroots organization.
There are funnier and more accessible comedy shows
at other times of the year, but on Christmas, this is the only
game in town, and it's no losing proposition.
