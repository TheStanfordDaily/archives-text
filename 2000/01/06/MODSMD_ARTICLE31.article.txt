# 'Galaxy Quest' goes where no movie has gone before

What if aliens do watch our
television programs?
"Galaxy Quest," a period
ically funny parody of "Star Trek"
and all other things sci-fi, is not as bad
as you might think. I don't consider
myself a Trekkie or a "Star Wars" fa-

natic by any means, but I have heard
about conventions and opening-night
events where people laboriously
dress up and seek out autographs and
other show memorabilia. So I played
along, and 1 was pleasantly surprised
at the laugh quotient of "Galaxy
Quest."
During the holiday season,
movies tend to get longer and more
dramatic. It's Oscar time, so Dream
works may have pulled off a great
counter-programming move (at
least for one week of decent rev

enues) by releasing this lightweight
comedy. Anyone can enjoy "Galaxy
Quest," especially those who can
catch all the soft jabs at the inherent
ridiculousness of many sci-fi films
and television shows.
"Galaxy Quest" is the title of a cult
TV show starring Jason Nesmith
(Tim Allen) as Commander Peter
Quincy Taggart. Jason is really a
cocky man who does not shy away
from publicity appearances.
Allen coolly slides into the role be
cause he plays a similar character on
"Home Improvement," a program
that also is essentially a parody of
"This Old House" and other home
shows. His commander role is made
famous by his "Never surrender,
never give up" line. Cheese to the
max, but do the aliens know that?
Jason is, in fact, contacted by four
aliens who have disguised themselves
as slightly odd-looking humans via
appearance and language chips. He
thinks this is all a fan-created hoax...
but the joke is on him once he realizes
he is millions of miles from Earth on
an actual interplanetary mission.
The aliens, believing Commander
Taggart's on-screen heroism to be

real, have created a replica of his ship
in the name of "Galaxy Quest." At
one point, Jason has to try to explain
why he and his crew are not fit to bat
tle the evil Sarris. A tough task, in
deed.
Backing up Allen are Sigourney
Weaver as a buxom translator and
Alan Rickman as an alien doctor.
Rickman's character has become
embittered of late for all of the pain
the show has caused him, while
Weaver's character has always been
mad about her tiny role on the pro
gram. When her part turns into real
ity on the spaceship, she defends her
words with passion (as any actor
would do).
"Galaxy Quest" has many clever
and amusing elements that, if omit
ted, would have made this moviego
ing experience very droll and boring.
I had fun watching this sci-fi send-up;
as an X-Phile, I can relate to how far
Trekkies may go in supporting their
cause. While this won't earn any cov
eted awards, I'm sure it will win over
hearts dear to the Force, the Federa
tion or the Truth.
