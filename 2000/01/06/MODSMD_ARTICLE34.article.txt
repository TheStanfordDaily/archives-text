## Alanis Morissette MTV Unplugged 
### 
£ "W" "T" nplugged" by now is almost a dis-
I ease. It started as a vehicle to
reintroduce established artists
such as Paul McCartney and reinvent hot
artists such as Nirvana. Eric Clapton's and
Neil Young's concerts were among the most
notable early Unplugged performances and
subsequent albums.
M'I"V (and the record labels) saw a good
thing and ran with it, even Unplugging such
acoustic veterans as Bob Dylan and Tony
Bennett. Now Alanis Morissette is next on
the block for an Unplugged album, fresh
from her sophomore slump, "Supposed For
mer Infatuation Junkie" (not counting her
early now-disowned Canadian teen dance al
bums).
ITiis is the same woman critics booed as
she topped the charts over greater talents
such as Liz Phair and tourmate Tori Amos.
Would this album reveal, reiterate or revolt?
To be fair, Alanis — in spite of her hip
hop background and critical scorn —is a
good candidate for the Unplugged treat
ment. One of her best early tracks was an in
spired acoustic treatment of "Perfect" from
"Jagged Little Pill." Still, without the alter
na-sound that helped propell her to mass
success, what would her more upbeat num
bers sound like?
Stripped naked of their hip-hop beats
(which are sometimes merely replaced with
drumming), the songs reveal their lyrics, the
oh-so-polarizingcoreof Alanis'material. Her
lyrics are quite simple yet cryptically emo
tional and observational. There is a certain
beauty in this simplicity, which evokes those
most primal of emotions: sorrow, madness,
joy and pain.
We are thankfully spared the most hack
neyed of Alanis' songs, such as the over
played "Hand in my Pocket" and " Thank U.'

However, "Thank U," along with at least
one other song, was performed at the show
yet left off the album.
Perhaps this is an artistic decision,
but to me it reeks of commercialism — the
tracks will be available to "major retail
chains, involving them in unique campaigns
that will marry digital downloads with in
store retail promotions."
So much for the concept of a con-

cert album. Now it's a concert promotional
vehicle. It would be nice to include the
extra tracks, if only as bonus tracks we
would be free to skip if desired.
As it stands, "Unplugged" con
tains four "Jagged" tracks, four "Junkie"
tracks and four new tracks. Of the latter,
three are new compositions by Alanis and
certainly not throw-aways. The other is a
capable if unremarkable cover of Sting's
"King of Pain." We also get to hear Moris
sette's song introductions in a lilting voice I
hadn't expected from the banshee she
evokes on her most emotional tracks.
Because her lyrics are ultimately
so simple and her instrumental abilities un
remarkable, little is added with the elec
tricity subtracted, though it is at least a new
and relatively pleasant way of listening to
her.
Fans will eat it up, while detrac
tors won't be impressed, but Unplugging
Alanis wasn't as bad an idea as it may have
first seemed. Others might just want to
check out "Alanis Morissette MTV Un
plugged" to see what Alanis can do. musi
cally and emotionally, in a more sedate en
vironment than the one that produced the
caustic, multi-platinum "Jagged Little
Pill."
