## Early Days: The Best of Led Zeppelin, Volume One 
### 
I was a bit skeptical when I heard
about Led Zeppelin's new "best-of"
CD. Although "Stairway to Heav
en" is perhaps the most requested song
ever, they simply weren't a singles band.
So how does one go about deciding
which songs to include?
Most Zeppelin fans will have heard
all of the 13 songs on the CD already, but
the album is still an enjoyable listen. By
presenting their more famous songs in
chronological order, the listener is able
to hear the evolution of the band. How

ever, beacuse Led Zeppelin was an
album-oriented band, some purists
might argue that these songs are being
heard out of the context from the origi
nal albums.
While there might be some truth to
this claim, I felt that the slightly different
order was refreshing. After all, I never
expected to hear "Dazed and Confused"
followed by "Communication Break
down" and "Whole Lotta Love."
More importantly, the disc works —
the collection is just one good song

after another. In some cases, this new
sequencing even makes it more listen
able. For example, the decision to make
"Stairway to Heaven" the last track is a
wise one, especially because the song is
on the long side, making it a good clos
er.
A majority of the tracks on this com
pilation are from their first four albums,
and the second and third album seem to
get short-changed because they are rep
resented by only two tracks each. (A sec
ond volume will cover their later al

bums.) And inevitably, one of your fa
vorite songs may have been left off.
But considering that many of the peo
ple who buy this CD may not be very fa
miliar with Led Zeppelin, this collection
serves its purpose as a good way to skim
the surface of the group's music before
delving into the actual albums. As a
bonus, the CD includes a video of "Com
munication Breakdown" that can be
played on a computer.
