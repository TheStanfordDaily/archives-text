# Skinny Puppy
## The 						Singles Collect; The B-sides Collect 
### 
The remnants of industrial music seem to have
diffused into the popular music landscape,
melding in like funk, old country and all the
other influences that, when in their injancy, also
seemed immiscible with rock. Industrial gained popu
lar acceptance with bands such as Ministry and Nine

Inch
Nails,
but their
contem-

porary. Skinny Puppy, was equally influential before
the breakthrough of the genre in the early '90s.
By this time, however, the Canadian group slowly
met its destruction, falling apart with personal and nat
ural disasters hastening their end. They formally dis
banded in 1996 after the death of member Dwayne
Goettel and the posthumous release of "The Process."
This end period is not addressed by two new single-
CD Skinny Puppy compilations, "The Singles Collect"
and"The B-sides Collect," which cover the rest of
their recording career from 1984 to 1991. These discs
mean to distill the Puppy story — previously told on
the multimedia odds and sods compilation "Brap" —
as well as to serve as a one-stop shop for those who
want the rare tracks in digital format.
However, what was once a gothic, horrifying

soundscape sounds almost quaint — or at least
dated — in light of the power of Ministry, the depth of
Nine Inch Nails, the humor and ironic posturing of
Marilyn Manson and the danceability of The Prodigy.
In terms of talent and innovation, Skinny Puppy
may have had the aforementioned groups beat, but
honestly I'd much rather listen to the bands which
rode their coattails to the mass success Skinny Puppy
never enjoyed. By '90s standards. Puppy's tracks are
just not as accessible.
Much of the problem is that the screamed vocals —
while forceful — are often unintelligible, and the sam
ples seem the only clue to the message for those who
don't already know the lyrics. The fact that "Singles
Collect" and "B-sides Collect" only have the barest of
liner notes — with no lyrics or other track information
— only adds to this problem.
Once deciphered, the lyrics often reveal haunting
sketches of personal and political torment — beings
living in assorted hells — in the fine tradition going
back to Frank Zappa and Throbbing Gristle andjump
ing forward to Rage Against the Machine and Nine
Inch Nails. It is an evocative and angry stream of con
sciousness, which paints a fairly complete picture — if
you can hear and understand it.
Ironically, "B-sides Collect" is a more engaging listen

than "Singles Collect." As with many artists, the B-sides
are where Skinny Puppy diverged from their tried and
true formula, sampling and remixing to their hearts' de
light, unconcerned with the overall structure of an album.
The album is spotty, but whose B-sides (excepting
the Beatles) aren't? I'd say that the average Puppy fan
should definitely start with the "B-sides" and then
only move to the "Singles" if they cannot help but
complete their collection. A non-fan will have to pro
ceed with caution.
Skinny Puppy's music is nothing if not heart-pump
ing, but it's sort of like listening to the Velvet Under
ground. Having come in late on the influential oeuvre,
most listeners will have encountered the work it influ
enced first and not be fully able to appreciate its most
innovative qualities.
The spare packaging and nonchronological se
quencing of the CDs also diminish their impact, mak
ing what could have been a general introduction to
Skinny Puppy into a compilation for Puppy comple
tionists. Fora band that could be cited as the missing
link between Metallica and Marilyn Manson and that
pioneered the harsh world of industrial music, that's a
disappointment.
