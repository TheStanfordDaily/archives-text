## Man on the Moon Soundtrack 
### 
The much-awaited movie, "Man
on the Moon," finally came out'
in December, bathed with glow
ing reviews and kudos for Jim Carrey's
channeling of Andy Kaufman. The ener
gy and amazement of this accomplish
ment (and, by extension, Kaufman's life)
is captured on the "Man On The Moon"
soundtrack.
This album is not the type to listen to
while studying or getting into a certain
mood. Much like the movie, it grabs your
attention, with spoken-word segments,
comedic songs, straight songs and scor
ing. The bulk of the work falls on
R.E.M., who more than a decade ago an
nounced "We do soundtracks" in liner
notes. "Man on the Moon" director
Milos Forman finally took them up on
their offer.
REM. is joined by Kaufman — both
as himself and as tasteless alter ego Tony
Clifton — played by both the original
Kaufman and Carrey. (Unfortunately, in
the marketing blitz, the studio chose not
to tell the customer which were which,
although the humorous duet with
R.E.M. on "This Friendly World" is
probably Carrey, and the 1983 appear
ance on Letterman is probably Kaufman.)

The soundtrack is a souvenir for the
film or for fans of Kaufman, Carrey or
R.E.M. The only new original song from
the soundtrack is R.E.M.'s above-par "The
Great Beyond," which may be a disap
pointment for those who expected more.
However, the archive songs — the
cheesy "Mighty Mouse Theme," the very
'70s hit "Kiss You All Over" and R.E.M.'s
stock "Man on the Moon" — are top
notch, the scoring is pleasant and the Kauf
man performances, well, that will depend
on what you think about him.
Although the soundtrack is quite
funny, Kaufman was always more about
getting reactions than getting laughs, so
some of the voice-overs are just plain weird
or tasteless. But, by their own standards,
they work.
The same thing can be said about the
soundtrack. It may not meet expectations
(and, with only one new song and only 37
minutes, it is rather skimpy), but it works
for what it is. I love it, from the opening
Mighty Mouse bit until Kaufman's swan
song, "One More Song for You." Your
mileage may vary; I suggest you see the
movie first.
