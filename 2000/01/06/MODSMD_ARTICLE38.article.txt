## Our Top Forty 
### 
Strangely enough, the greatest annoyance at the end of the millenium has not been the Y2K bug but the on
slaught of lists of "greatest" people, moments, movies, albums, etc. Nonetheless, Intermission is enthusiastical
ly jumping on the bandwagon by having four of our top writers compile their lists of the top 10 albums of the
'90s: At least we waited until the decade was over before making our picks.

derbelly. Thus, rockers such as "Divorce Song" and the aptly-titled "Mesmerizing"
are given an air of deperate triumph. Phair may be suffering, but at least she knows
why.
#5 "Time Out of Mind" — Bob Dylan 1997
It's not dark yet / But it's getting there
Artist of the decade? How about Daniel Lanois, who produced masterpieces by U2,
Emmylou Harris and Willie Nelson. However, his greatest accomplishment was wak
ing up America's greatest songwriter for one last croak of greatness. Dylan's voice is
in tatters, but he has never sounded better. Further, for the first time since "Highway
61 Revisited," the music matches the intensity of the lyrics. The graveyard rattle of
"Dirt Road Blues" and "Cold Iron Bounds" are terrifying— Dylan is living in a land
of dusk, half-dead and half-alive.
#6 "Stranger's Almanac" — Whiskeytown 1997
Don 7 you ask me how I'm doing/ When everything I do says / miss you
If the American pop machine had any imagination, singer / songwriter Ryan Admas
would be a star. His voice has the strained vulnerability of Paul Westerberg, and his
songs are dramatic gems. "Yesterday's News," "Everything I Do," and "Turn
Around" pack a punch reminiscent of Stax / Volt soul, not '90s alt-country. Unlike his
contemporaries, Adams understands the reasons why Gram Parsons covered Aretha
Franklin's "Do Right Woman." Whiskeytown's music should be playing on car radios
across the country. Instead, the group has splintered multiple times, and the Back
street Boys are on the cover of Rolling Stone.
#7 "You Gotta Sin To Get Saved" — Maria McKee 1993
Now I pray the Lord won't scorn me if I make an honest vow/To someday wear a dress
of white / Cause scarlet's what I'm wearing now
From the opening gallop of "I'm Gonna Soothe You" to the closing swing of the title
track, this album is a triumph of maturity. McKee's over-hyped original band. Lone
Justice, collapsed under the pressure of bringing country-rock to the '80s. However,
when no one was paying attention, the group held a virtual reunion in 1993 to record
McKce's second solo album, and the results are breath-taking. In particular, "1 l or
give You" is a burning chunk of soul which can overwhelm an unprepared listener.
McKee's stunning voice is unstrained, confident and triumphant.
#8 "The Bends" — Radiohead 1995
/ wish it was the sixties I wish I could be happy/1 wish I wish I wish that something
would happen
Listening to "The Bends" is an exhilirating experience. Few bands this decade were
willing to put their reputation on the line and produce unrepentent anthemic rock.
While their contemporaries hid behind coy irony, Radiohead aimed straight for the
gut — the guitar .climaxes of the title track and "Just (You Do I To Yourself)" are
transcendent. Further, on tracks like "Bones" and "Black Star," lead singer Thorn
Yorke turns rock into high drama. Radiohead went for broke on their second album
and hit gold.
#9 "Rock'n Roll Duds" — The Cruel Sea 1995
Breaks my heart to hear you whistle my tune
What happens to bands whose instrumental strengths far outclass their songwntmg
abilities? Generally they turn in "jam bands" and waste people's time. Not the ( ruel

#1 "Slanted and Enchanted"
— Pavement 1992
Lies and betrayals / Fruit-covered
nails
On this stunning debut, Steve Malk
mus and company quite simply rein
vent pop music. The songs themselves
are little more than sound collages in
terspersed with 10-fi guitar noise, bub
ble-gum harmonies and unnerving
screams. However, the songs never
lose their pulse, and the rhythm guitar
recalls the Velvet Underground at
their peak. Further, the nonsense

lyrics are delivered with such shocking confidence that the album holds together
against all odds. From the delicate and enchanting "Here" to the irresistible "Summer
Babe (Winter Version)" and "Trigger Cut/ Wounded Kite at :17," the results are
pure magic.

#2 "Wrecking Ball" — Emmylou Harris 1995
Don 7 waste your breath / Don 7 waste your heart / Don 7 blister your heels / Running
in the dark
Emmylou Harris has carried Gram Parson's torch for so long that many have forgot
ten she holds her own artistic vision. With "Wrecking Ball," she delivers the best
album of her career, an endlessly moving meditation on loss, regret and faith. Daniel
Lanois's ethereal production cradles Harris's aching soprano in a middle ground be
tween genres. The snare drum snaps, the piano echoes and the guitars shimmer, giv
ing Harris's interpretation of the music of Lanois, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Steve
Earle, and Lucinda Williams an ageless quality rarely achieved in popular music.
#3 "Achtung, Baby" — U2 1991
/ 'd join the movement /If there was one I could believe in /I'd break bread and wine / If
there was a church I could receive in
Trapped beneath the monumental success of "The Joshua Tree," U2 retreated to Eu
rope and prouduced the "Who's Next" of their career. Not only did the group broad
en their sonic palette through heavy distortion of the Edge's guitar and Larry Mullen's
drums, but they also delivered their most consistent and engaging collection of songs.
The group finally learned to rock without pretention, helping fans forget embarass
ments like "Bullet The Blue Sky." Met with confusion at its initial release, "Achtung,
Baby'"s mixture of irony and despair can now be seen as U2's most prophetic and bril
liant moment.
#4 "Exile In Guyville" — Liz Phair 1993
But if I d known how that would sound to you /1 would have stayed in your bed for the
rest of my life/Just to prove I was right / That it's harder to be friends than lovers
Phair raised eyebrows when she claimed that her debut double-album was a song-by
song response to the Stones' masterpiece "Exile on Main Street." Unfortunately,
what likely began as a publicity stunt threatened to overshadow an astonishingly pow
erful recording. Although Phair tries to foster a bad-girl persona, soft, mournful tracks
such as "Explain It To Me," "Girls! Girls! Girls!," and "Shatter" reveal her soft un-

#3 "Achtung, Baby" — U2 1991
/ 'd join the movement /If there was one I could believe in /I'd break bread and wine / If
there was a church I could receive in
Trapped beneath the monumental success of "The Joshua Tree," U2 retreated to Eu
rope and prouduced the "Who's Next" of their career. Not only did the group broad
en their sonic palette through heavy distortion of the Edge's guitar and Larry Mullen's
drums, but they also delivered their most consistent and engaging collection of songs.
The group finally learned to rock without pretention, helping fans forget embarass
ments like "Bullet The Blue Sky." Met with confusion at its initial release, "Achtung,
Baby'"s mixture of irony and despair can now be seen as U2's most prophetic and bril
liant moment.
#4 "Exile In Guyville" — Liz Phair 1993
But if I d known how that would sound to you /1 would have stayed in your bed for the
rest of my life/Just to prove I was right / That it's harder to be friends than lovers
Phair raised eyebrows when she claimed that her debut double-album was a song-by
song response to the Stones' masterpiece "Exile on Main Street." Unfortunately,
what likely began as a publicity stunt threatened to overshadow an astonishingly pow
erful recording. Although Phair tries to foster a bad-girl persona, soft, mournful tracks
such as "Explain It To Me," "Girls! Girls! Girls!," and "Shatter" reveal her soft un-

Strangely enough, the greatest annoyance at the end of the millenium has not been the Y2K bug but the on

derbelly. Thus, rockers such as "Divorce Song" and the aptly-titled "Mesmerizing"
are given an air of deperate triumph. Phair may be suffering, but at least she knows
why.
#5 "Time Out of Mind" — Bob Dylan 1997
It's not dark yet / But it's getting there
Artist of the decade? How about Daniel Lanois, who produced masterpieces by U2,
Emmylou Harris and Willie Nelson. However, his greatest accomplishment was wak
ing up America's greatest songwriter for one last croak of greatness. Dylan's voice is
in tatters, but he has never sounded better. Further, for the first time since "Highway
61 Revisited," the music matches the intensity of the lyrics. The graveyard rattle of
"Dirt Road Blues" and "Cold Iron Bounds" are terrifying— Dylan is living in a land
of dusk, half-dead and half-alive.
#6 "Stranger's Almanac" — Whiskeytown 1997
Don 7 you ask me how I'm doing/ When everything I do says / miss you
If the American pop machine had any imagination, singer / songwriter Ryan Admas
would be a star. His voice has the strained vulnerability of Paul Westerberg, and his
songs are dramatic gems. "Yesterday's News," "Everything I Do," and "Turn
Around" pack a punch reminiscent of Stax / Volt soul, not '90s alt-country. Unlike his
contemporaries, Adams understands the reasons why Gram Parsons covered Aretha
Franklin's "Do Right Woman." Whiskeytown's music should be playing on car radios
across the country. Instead, the group has splintered multiple times, and the Back
street Boys are on the cover of Rolling Stone.
#7 "You Gotta Sin To Get Saved" — Maria McKee 1993
Now I pray the Lord won't scorn me if I make an honest vow/To someday wear a dress
of white / Cause scarlet's what I'm wearing now
From the opening gallop of "I'm Gonna Soothe You" to the closing swing of the title
track, this album is a triumph of maturity. McKee's over-hyped original band. Lone
Justice, collapsed under the pressure of bringing country-rock to the '80s. However,
when no one was paying attention, the group held a virtual reunion in 1993 to record
McKce's second solo album, and the results are breath-taking. In particular, "1 l or
give You" is a burning chunk of soul which can overwhelm an unprepared listener.
McKee's stunning voice is unstrained, confident and triumphant.
#8 "The Bends" — Radiohead 1995
/ wish it was the sixties I wish I could be happy/1 wish I wish I wish that something
would happen
Listening to "The Bends" is an exhilirating experience. Few bands this decade were
willing to put their reputation on the line and produce unrepentent anthemic rock.
While their contemporaries hid behind coy irony, Radiohead aimed straight for the
gut — the guitar .climaxes of the title track and "Just (You Do I To Yourself)" are
transcendent. Further, on tracks like "Bones" and "Black Star," lead singer Thorn
Yorke turns rock into high drama. Radiohead went for broke on their second album
and hit gold.
#9 "Rock'n Roll Duds" — The Cruel Sea 1995
Breaks my heart to hear you whistle my tune
What happens to bands whose instrumental strengths far outclass their songwntmg
abilities? Generally they turn in "jam bands" and waste people's time. Not the ( ruel

#1 "Slanted and Enchanted"
— Pavement 1992
Lies and betrayals / Fruit-covered
nails
On this stunning debut, Steve Malk
mus and company quite simply rein
vent pop music. The songs themselves
are little more than sound collages in
terspersed with 10-fi guitar noise, bub
ble-gum harmonies and unnerving
screams. However, the songs never
lose their pulse, and the rhythm guitar
recalls the Velvet Underground at
their peak. Further, the nonsense

lyrics are delivered with such shocking confidence that the album holds together
against all odds. From the delicate and enchanting "Here" to the irresistible "Summer
Babe (Winter Version)" and "Trigger Cut/ Wounded Kite at :17," the results are
pure magic.

#2 "Wrecking Ball" — Emmylou Harris 1995
Don 7 waste your breath / Don 7 waste your heart / Don 7 blister your heels / Running
in the dark
Emmylou Harris has carried Gram Parson's torch for so long that many have forgot
ten she holds her own artistic vision. With "Wrecking Ball," she delivers the best
album of her career, an endlessly moving meditation on loss, regret and faith. Daniel
Lanois's ethereal production cradles Harris's aching soprano in a middle ground be
tween genres. The snare drum snaps, the piano echoes and the guitars shimmer, giv
ing Harris's interpretation of the music of Lanois, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Steve
Earle, and Lucinda Williams an ageless quality rarely achieved in popular music.
#3 "Achtung, Baby" — U2 1991
