# Intermission's reviewers choose the best albums of the '90s

Sea, however, who have produced a string of successful albums which have focused on
the sonic texture of rock and roll. Not surprisingly, the Australian group's strongest
work is this collection of cover songs and instrumental. "Looks Like It's Gonna
Rain" and "Copper's Waltz" are moving, both literally and emotionally. The group
also tackles the Velvet Underground, Queen, Tony Joe White, Jim Croce, Led Zep
pelin and John Lee Hooker with similar success, particularly their menacing, swamp
rock on White's "High Sheriff Of Calhoun Parish."
#10 "Central Reservation" — Beth Orton 1999
And I can't waste another second / Living in hell like it's some kind of heaven
Orton's smoky voice first garnered attention on the Chemical Brothers' "Exit Planet
Dust." Her solo work, however, establishes her as an artist of singular importance.
This haunting album jumps wildly from jazz to folk to techno without breaking its
spell. Orton sings with gorgeous abandon, turning the acoustic "Blood Red River"
and "Feel To Believe" into paralyzing performances. Further, on tracks such as
"Stolen Car" and "Pass In Time," she slides effortlessly through complex sound
scapes. "Central Reservation" is a disarmingly powerful album, making Orton an
artist to watch in the next decade.

#1 "Nevermind" — Nirvana
1991
Load up on guns and bring your
friends / It's fun to lose and to pretend
What can be said that hasn't been said
before? A thunderous album that bold
ly destroyed the old and ushered in the
new — literally, by knocking Michael
Jackson out of Billboard's No. 1 spot.
An album that introduced the world to
flannel and the Seattle sound. The
album that finally broke punk to the
whole world since the England and

New York underground couldn't 14 years earlier. Cobain was elevated to rock-god
status following his suicide. A band who, second only to the Sex Pistols, represent
everything that punk should be. If you have to ask...

#2 "To Bring You My Love" — PJ Harvey 1995
I've traveled over/ Dry earth and floods / Hell and high water/ To bring you my love
After indie sounding "Dry" and straight ahead rocker "Rid of Me," PJ Harvey fol
lowed in the footsteps of U2 and enlisted the services of producer Flood for 1995's "To
Bring You My Love." While contemporary Alanis comes at you screaming, Harvey
slyly, seductively attempts to gain your favor. The album has a murky feeling through
out with relief only on the acoustically driven "C'mon Billy" and "Down By The
Water." With slinky grooves and driving beats. Harvey wrestles with her femininity
and makes you feel the pain of a love lost, not just the question of whether or not the
woman after her would be willing to perform oral sex in public.
#3 "The Downward Spiral" — Nine Inch Nails 1994
/ take you where you want to go/1 give you all you need to know/1 take you down /
use you up / Mr. Self Destruct
From the S&M intro to the rock-bottom end, "The Downward Spiral" takes the lis
tener on a journey that no one would want to experience. On the way down, we are
shown all of Reznor's pitfalls: sex ("Big Man With A Gun"), religion ("Heresy '), sui
cide ("The Downward Spiral") and drugs ("Hurt"). Reznor distances himself from his
industrial peers with his use of organic sounds within the jagged exterior commonly
associated with the genre. He also understands that whispering in your ear can some
times be more persuasive than beating something into your forehead.

#4 "OK Computer" — Radiohead 1997
When I am king you will be first against the wall / With your opinions which are of no
consequence at all
Probably the most consistently great band of the '90s, Radiohead produced three suc
cessful albums: 1993's "Pablo Honey," 1995's "The Bends" and the group's peak —
1997's "OK Computer". Singer Thorn Yorke's crooning voice serves as an appropri
ate counterpoint to guitarist Jonny Greenwood's fuzzy, distorted riffs. The album it
self portrays a futuristic, emotionally controlling world that continually stifles its in
habitants until they are nothing more than "a pig in a cage on antibiotics" as the pro
paganda declares on "Fitter Happier." One would expect that just as "Dark Side of
the Moon" plays along with "The Wizard of Oz," "OK Computer" would comple
ment "Brave New World."
#5 "Dig Me Out" — Sleater-Kinney 1997
Don 7 come any closer / That s good enough / Don 7go away /1 can 7 stand the thought
It is tough fora female rock outfit to make a really great rock statement while still re
taining some level of feminity. Usually they ending up going too far over the top (L7)
or give in to their emotional side (Bangles). On 1997's "Dig Me Out" Sleater-Kinney
manages to walk the line perfectly. Building on the bass-less music of Pussy Galore
and Jon Spencer, "Dig Me Out" is driven by the marvelous interplay between singer
/ guitarists Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein and the powerful drumming of Janet
Weiss. You are forced to hear what they have to say on their own terms, and you like
it.
#6 "Play" — Moby 1999
Ride at night, ride through heaven and hell/Come back and feel so well
Most mainstream rock fans have a problem when it comes to breaching the realm of
dance music. But Moby's music and personality are both very approachable on 1999's
"Play." He has taken a step back from the straight-ahead dance music that he nearly
perfected on 1995's "Everything is Wrong" to create an album with a more human
feel. Sampling heavily from early 20th-century black spiritual music, Moby brings a
real, personal face to what can be the unapproachable monolith of dance music. Moby
also picks up the mic himself for several songs, including the beautiful, sweeping
"South Side."
#7 "Girlfriend" — Matthew Sweet 1991
Gonna need you a key to open the door to her heart / Or are you afraid her body is miss
ing that part?
After two unsuccessful albums and a humbling divorce, Matthew Sweet recorded
"Girlfriend," which stands as one of the greatest guitar-pop albums of all time. Build
ing heavily upon Neil Young and Big Star, Sweet successfully crafts songs that span
the gap from country ballads ("Winona," "You Don't Love Me") to straight-ahead
rockers ("Does She Talk?," "Girlfriend"). Smartly moving away from the syrupy pop
sounds of his first two solo efforts. Sweet enlisted the help of two veterans of the '70s
New York punk scene: Robert Quine (Richard Hell and the Voidoids) and Richard
Lloyd (Television) to give the album a more solid, guitar-based sound.
#8 "Natural Born Killers: A Soundtrack For An Oliver Stone Film"
— Various Artists 1994
'Mickey and Mallory are the best thing to happen to mass murder since Manson.'' Yeah,
but they're way cooler.'
Not until recently has the idea of putting movie dialogue on soundtracks become a
