# Intermission's reviewers choose the best albums of the '90s

### 
Sea, however, who have produced a string of successful albums which have focused on
the sonic texture of rock and roll. Not surprisingly, the Australian group's strongest
work is this collection of cover songs and instrumental. "Looks Like It's Gonna
Rain" and "Copper's Waltz" are moving, both literally and emotionally. The group
also tackles the Velvet Underground, Queen, Tony Joe White, Jim Croce, Led Zep
pelin and John Lee Hooker with similar success, particularly their menacing, swamp
rock on White's "High Sheriff Of Calhoun Parish."
#10 "Central Reservation" — Beth Orton 1999
And I can't waste another second / Living in hell like it's some kind of heaven
Orton's smoky voice first garnered attention on the Chemical Brothers' "Exit Planet
Dust." Her solo work, however, establishes her as an artist of singular importance.
This haunting album jumps wildly from jazz to folk to techno without breaking its
spell. Orton sings with gorgeous abandon, turning the acoustic "Blood Red River"
and "Feel To Believe" into paralyzing performances. Further, on tracks such as
"Stolen Car" and "Pass In Time," she slides effortlessly through complex sound
scapes. "Central Reservation" is a disarmingly powerful album, making Orton an
artist to watch in the next decade.

#1 "Nevermind" — Nirvana
1991
Load up on guns and bring your
friends / It's fun to lose and to pretend
What can be said that hasn't been said
before? A thunderous album that bold
ly destroyed the old and ushered in the
new — literally, by knocking Michael
Jackson out of Billboard's No. 1 spot.
An album that introduced the world to
flannel and the Seattle sound. The
album that finally broke punk to the
whole world since the England and

New York underground couldn't 14 years earlier. Cobain was elevated to rock-god
status following his suicide. A band who, second only to the Sex Pistols, represent
everything that punk should be. If you have to ask...

#2 "To Bring You My Love" — PJ Harvey 1995
I've traveled over/ Dry earth and floods / Hell and high water/ To bring you my love
After indie sounding "Dry" and straight ahead rocker "Rid of Me," PJ Harvey fol
lowed in the footsteps of U2 and enlisted the services of producer Flood for 1995's "To
Bring You My Love." While contemporary Alanis comes at you screaming, Harvey
slyly, seductively attempts to gain your favor. The album has a murky feeling through
out with relief only on the acoustically driven "C'mon Billy" and "Down By The
Water." With slinky grooves and driving beats. Harvey wrestles with her femininity
and makes you feel the pain of a love lost, not just the question of whether or not the
woman after her would be willing to perform oral sex in public.
#3 "The Downward Spiral" — Nine Inch Nails 1994
/ take you where you want to go/1 give you all you need to know/1 take you down /
use you up / Mr. Self Destruct
From the S&M intro to the rock-bottom end, "The Downward Spiral" takes the lis
tener on a journey that no one would want to experience. On the way down, we are
shown all of Reznor's pitfalls: sex ("Big Man With A Gun"), religion ("Heresy '), sui
cide ("The Downward Spiral") and drugs ("Hurt"). Reznor distances himself from his
industrial peers with his use of organic sounds within the jagged exterior commonly
associated with the genre. He also understands that whispering in your ear can some
times be more persuasive than beating something into your forehead.

#4 "OK Computer" — Radiohead 1997
When I am king you will be first against the wall / With your opinions which are of no
consequence at all
Probably the most consistently great band of the '90s, Radiohead produced three suc
cessful albums: 1993's "Pablo Honey," 1995's "The Bends" and the group's peak —
1997's "OK Computer". Singer Thorn Yorke's crooning voice serves as an appropri
ate counterpoint to guitarist Jonny Greenwood's fuzzy, distorted riffs. The album it
self portrays a futuristic, emotionally controlling world that continually stifles its in
habitants until they are nothing more than "a pig in a cage on antibiotics" as the pro
paganda declares on "Fitter Happier." One would expect that just as "Dark Side of
the Moon" plays along with "The Wizard of Oz," "OK Computer" would comple
ment "Brave New World."
#5 "Dig Me Out" — Sleater-Kinney 1997
Don 7 come any closer / That s good enough / Don 7go away /1 can 7 stand the thought
It is tough fora female rock outfit to make a really great rock statement while still re
taining some level of feminity. Usually they ending up going too far over the top (L7)
or give in to their emotional side (Bangles). On 1997's "Dig Me Out" Sleater-Kinney
manages to walk the line perfectly. Building on the bass-less music of Pussy Galore
and Jon Spencer, "Dig Me Out" is driven by the marvelous interplay between singer
/ guitarists Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein and the powerful drumming of Janet
Weiss. You are forced to hear what they have to say on their own terms, and you like
it.
#6 "Play" — Moby 1999
Ride at night, ride through heaven and hell/Come back and feel so well
Most mainstream rock fans have a problem when it comes to breaching the realm of
dance music. But Moby's music and personality are both very approachable on 1999's
"Play." He has taken a step back from the straight-ahead dance music that he nearly
perfected on 1995's "Everything is Wrong" to create an album with a more human
feel. Sampling heavily from early 20th-century black spiritual music, Moby brings a
real, personal face to what can be the unapproachable monolith of dance music. Moby
also picks up the mic himself for several songs, including the beautiful, sweeping
"South Side."
#7 "Girlfriend" — Matthew Sweet 1991
Gonna need you a key to open the door to her heart / Or are you afraid her body is miss
ing that part?
After two unsuccessful albums and a humbling divorce, Matthew Sweet recorded
"Girlfriend," which stands as one of the greatest guitar-pop albums of all time. Build
ing heavily upon Neil Young and Big Star, Sweet successfully crafts songs that span
the gap from country ballads ("Winona," "You Don't Love Me") to straight-ahead
rockers ("Does She Talk?," "Girlfriend"). Smartly moving away from the syrupy pop
sounds of his first two solo efforts. Sweet enlisted the help of two veterans of the '70s
New York punk scene: Robert Quine (Richard Hell and the Voidoids) and Richard
Lloyd (Television) to give the album a more solid, guitar-based sound.
#8 "Natural Born Killers: A Soundtrack For An Oliver Stone Film"
— Various Artists 1994
'Mickey and Mallory are the best thing to happen to mass murder since Manson.'' Yeah,
but they're way cooler.'
Not until recently has the idea of putting movie dialogue on soundtracks become a

popular idea. Thanks to producer Trent Reznor, this album does it so well that one
does not even need to see the film to know what is happening. We can follow the re
lationship of Mickey and Mallory from love ("You Belong to Me," Bob Dylan) to
murder ("S***list," L7) to downfall ("Something I Can Never Have," Nine Inch
Nails). It does have great music, but that is not why it is on this list. The soundtrack
shines because of the seamless integration of sound-bytes from the film into the
album.
#9 "I Feel Alright" — Steve Earle 19%
/ got everything you want or need / Your darkest fear, your fondest dream
Most modern country music is crap. But when there is a lot of bad music there can usu
ally be found a few individuals who are driven to rescue a genre from itself. Steve Earle
is one such person. Unfortunately, after releasing the promising albums "Guitar
Town" and "Copperhead Road" in the late '80s, Earle succumbed to addiction and
prison. After cleaning up in 1994, he rededicated himself to music, resulting in 1995's
low-key "Train A Comin' " and 1996's masterful "I Feel Alright." Earle artfully crafts
everything from ballads ("Valentine's Day") to country-rock (the amazing duet
"You're Still Standin' There," with Lucinda Williams). Owing just as much to the Bea
tles as Johnny Cash, this album is what '90s country should have been.
#10 "I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got" — Sinead O'Conner 1990
These are dangerous days / To say what you feel is to dig your own grave
An album devoted to relationships gone bad and social injustice, 1990's "I Do Not
Want What I Haven't Got" is as diverse musically as it is brutally honest lyrically.
Drawing from hip-hop ("I Am Stretched On Your Grave") as much as from pop
("The Emperor's New Clothes"), the album bridges the gap from the '80s to the '90s.
Her rendition of Prince's "Nothing Compares 2 U," along with its simplistically bril
liant video, was a huge success despite having no sexual bribe behind it. She also
played a major role in paving the way for the entire Lilith Fair generation of female
artists.

#1 "Being There" — Wilco 19%

Music is my savior / And I was
maimed by rock and roll
If Gram Parsons had joined the
Stones right after "Let It Bleed"
they might have recorded an album
much like this. Wilco combines
acoustic instruments with heavy
electric guitar and pounding drums
and folk / country arrangements
with jarring dissonance, often in the
same song. There is also an emo
tional progression in the song cycle.
Jeff Tweedy's cracked, world-weary
voice mixes resignation and endur
ing hope combined with a belief in
redemption through music. There-

suit is timeless and spiritual as well as strikingly original. By turns both meditative and
raw, this album reinvigorates the whole idea of rock music.

#2 "Seamonsters" — The Wedding Present 1992
You 've told him lies now for so long / Still he's ready to forf>i ve / He's got you hack and
that's all he wants / It's a lot more than I'm left with
Singer / songwriter David Gedge has built a career around the suffering caused while
groping towards love or trying to satisfy lust. On "Seamonsters," the band complete
ly fuses Gedge's lyrics and the band's wall-of-sound, resulting in a uniquely powerful
album of betrayal, obsession and pain. Some of the songs are churning, distorted
howls of anger, frustration and self-loathing while others are quiet, melancholy re
flections. The flip side of every banal love song, this is a cathartic listening.
#3 "Dusk At Cubist Castle ..." — The Olivia Tremor Control 19%
Feel the atmosphere breathe with life/ Modeled port rait-heads of Gertrude Stein
The Olivia Tremor Control saved psychedelia from the wank-rock of Phish and other
tiresome jam bands. While drawing on the concise lysergic pop of the Beatles and the
spacey explorations of early Fink Floyd, the OTC's songwriting elevates this album

beyond a mere synthesis of influences. The beautiful melodies, harmony vocals and
uplifting lyrics contribute to a buoyant, joyful and trippy album — as if rock evolution
was re-started in the autumn of 1967, without the arrogance or cynicism of the inter
vening years. The OTC have created something both willfully naive and mischie
vously intelligent.
#4 "Museum" — The Blueberries 1994
When my head it clears/ The wasted years all came flooding back/ All the pain tluit
brings / Makes all these things my heart attacks
Like confessional songwriters such as Neil Young, Alex Chilton and Paul Westerberg.
the Blueberries hide their emotional complexity behind a boozy / stoned attitude. On
"Museum," their strong songwriting and knowing lyrics combine to great effect.
Touches of accordion, mandolin and fiddle embellish certain songs without stylisti
cally dominating them, and the roots-rock backing lends the music an earthiness that
keeps it honest. The band can sing about heartache without self-pity, about abortion
without being preachy and about love without being maudlin. They are truly the
thinking man's drinking band.
#5 "Gideon Gaye" — The High Llamas 1995
And clutching the music so varied and sweet/ Half in tune, half complete
The world may never get a chance to hear Brian Wilson's lost masterpiece, "Smile,"
but at least we have "Gideon Gaye." Lush harmonies, stately piano and serene strings
dominate a restrained and gentle song cycle of note-perfect construction. Lyrically im
pressionistic, the most upbeat song on the album is about death, while two others arc
told from the points of view of a collie and a goat. For those tired of histrionic singing
and guitar cliches, "Gideon Gaye" provides a refreshing antidote. Although the 1 ligh
Llamas have drifted away from their early promise, this pastoral album remains a joy.
#6 "Too Far To Care" —Old 97's 1997
What's so great about the barrier reef / What's so fine about art / What's so good about
a Good Times Van / When you 're working on a broken man
From the opening salvo of "Timebomb" to the closing feedback screech of "Four Leaf
Clover," the Old 97's third album is a high-energy romp. The band, which frequently
sounds like Buck Owens on speed, is one of the best to come out of the vital alt-coun
try scene. Rhett Miller's witty lyrics, a rough-and-ready rhythm section and Ken
Bethea's versatile guitar are combined with strong, melodic songwriting to produce an
album where every tune is distinct, appealing and entertaining. This is a fun, intelli
gent album from an incredibly talented crew.
#7 "Painful" —Yo La Tengo 1993
Pull a woolen blanket across my eyes/ Dream a quiet place for us to find
This is the ridiculously prolific Yo La Tengo's sixth album, and the first to effectively
gel their disparate influences. Finally, strong songs are crafted out of the band's trade
mark sonic dreamscapes of barely controlled distortion or gentle chiming guitars and
floating organ. The mysterious vocals, mixed low under relentless drums and growl
ing bass, alternate between guitarist Ira Kaplan's thin quaver and drummer Georgia
Hubley's guileless innocence. Sometimes hard listening, this album continues and up
dates the pioneering guitar explorations of bands such as the Velvet Underground.
Television and Sonic Youth.
#8 "Gone Too Far" — Liar 1998
Well my heart is in ashes/My love is all dust/What is left of my hope/Has died with
my trust
Continuing in the vein of eclecticism and instrumental prowess of bands such as
Camper Van Beethoven, Liar's sophomore album combines amphetamine country,
ersatz gypsy folk and skewed rock with seemingly effortless skill and grace. All four
musicians are imaginative, and some of the strongest songs here are instrumentals
where the guitar and violin almost seem to be dueling. However, this is not a noodling
jam band, and the songs are not just excuses for fretboard grandstanding. Cryptic
lyrics, gravelly vocals and the occasional dose of humor combine with the music to cre
ate a rich and rewarding album.
#9 "Cafe Reggio" — Holiday 1997
Show me how you 're living / Blissfully day to day / Could you show me how to live life
that way?
If Burt Bacharach and Pavement ever had a bastard child, this is what it would sound
like. In a decade where grunge gave dominance to a legion of lank-haired guys with

distorted guitars and poetic pretensions, the subtle melodicism of Holiday was a
breath of fresh air. Half of this album is from the band's early days in 1993, and the
other half is from their final 1997 sessions. As a result, it spans their noisy 10-fi origins
and their later pop perfectionism. Josh Gennet's breezy vocals, Matt Snow's pithy gui
tar fills and punchy horn arrangements fill out some of the catchiest songwriting since
the golden days of AM radio.
#10 "Shleep" — Robert Wyatt 1998
I realised my goose was cooked /1 wandered shipshaped on the shore
The one constant in Robert Wyatt's nearly 35-year career has been his frail tenor voice
and his insightful and self-deprecating wit, both of which are used to great effect on
"Shleep." Here he collaborates with Paul Weller, Brian Eno and other friends to cre
ate a diverse selection of minimalist songs influenced by post-bop jazz, world music
and avant-garde experimentation. Like many others in the Canterbury scene he
helped create, Robert Wyatt's music is difficult to categorize, but it is an acquired taste
well worth cultivating. "Shleep," his strongest album in many years, is a good place to
start.

#1 "Enter The Wu-Tang
(36 Chambers)" — Wu-
Tang Clan 1993
And I'm the dirtiest thing in
sight / Matter of fact bring out
the girls and let's have a mud
fight
They form like Voltron, each
with his unique skill that mes
merizes. Never had such a
large group been able to
demonstrate such a variety of
sounds. This album demon
strated Ol' Dirty Bastard's
crazy nature, Ghostface and
Raekwon's lyrical combat
and Method Man's bass-

heavy, distinctive sound. Hailing from Shoalin, The Clan's imagination combined
with the RZA's sharp beats were the underlying ingredients fo their sound. Every
song was an instant classic whether it be "Chessboxin," " Wu-tangClan Ain't Nutin To
F*** wit," "C.R.E.A.M." or "Method Man."
#2 "Doggystyle" — Snoop Doggy Dogg 1993
I stop breathin. Damn, / see demons / Dear God, I wonder can ya save me?
Admit it, you own "Doggystyle" and can recite word for word from it. He had every
one singing along to songs like the catchy "What's My Name," the smooth "Gin and
Juice" and the hilarious "Ain't No Fun." Snoop's silky smooth vocals rolled perfectly
over Dre's finely engineered tracks. This album proved that Death Row records was
on top. The release of the album corresponded with Snoop's murder trial, amplifying
Snoop's image aseternal gangster. With tracks titled "Murder Was The Case," he had
everyone listening.
#3'illmatic" — Nas 1994
Understandable smooth s*** that murderers move wit/ The thief s theme, play me at
night, they won't act right
Nicknamed "Nasty," Nas came out of nowhere with this l()-song album. With a strong
message on every track, "Illmatic" had a young Nas pouring his heart into an album
that should be analyzed word by word to appreciate the full effort put forth. Although
Nas has drifted from his days as Nasty Nas with three lackluster follow-ups, he will for
ever be remembered for tracks such as "Halftime," "One Love" And"The World Is
Yours." He brought his audience into his mind and let them see the world through his
eyes.
#4 "The Chronic" — Dr. Dre 1992
So sit back, relax and strap on your seatbelt / You never been on a ride like this before
This album immortalized gangsta rap. Dre provided classics such as "Nuthin' But A
G' Thang" and "Wit Dre Day (And Everybody's Celebratin')," to which everyone

soon knew the words. Most importantly, this album introduced a young puppy named
Snoop Doggy Dogg and proved that Dre did not need NWA to succeed. Although it
had the strong West Coast G-Funk sound, it attracted the whole country. Although
his message was shallow and demoralizing, the music was so good that all anyone
wanted to do was smile and bounce their heads to Dre's infectious beats.
#5 "All Eyez on Me" — Tupac 1996
I heard a rumor I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized... But that was fiction,
some coward got the story twisted
Tupac was hip-hop's lost poet. Controversial yet sentimental, his music was defined
by its emotion, which flooded his opus "All Eyez On Me." In a move unprecedented
in hip hop, Tupac put together a double album, and as a result of its success, a number
of other artists would follow his footsteps and do the same. It had the perfect balance
of commercial hits and thugged-out anthems. What made this album so unsettling was
how Tupac would predict his bloody end yet claim he was still alive, creating rumors
that he never died,
#6 "Ready To Die" — Notorious 8.1.G. 1994
/ made the change from a common thief/ To up close and personal with Robin Leach
All hail the King of New York, who was once and forever established with the release
of this album. There was no question Biggie could make people dance with songs such
as "One More Chance," "Juicy" and "Big Poppa." However, he also had the ability to
tell stories about street struggle while contemplating suicide as the world seemed to
close in on him. The vivid images he would paint on tracks such as "Everyday Strug
gle," "The Warning" and "Ready to Die" can never be forgotten.
#7 "The Low End Theory" — A Tribe Called Quest 1991
No batteries included, and no strings attached/No holds barred, no time for move
fakin'
Tribe had a string of strong albums, but this was their strongest as Ali, Q-Tip and Phife
all contributed equally in just the right amounts. Each song had its own personality,
whether asking questions on "What" or silencing critics with "Scenario." Tribe was
fun yet spiritual. They could make people dance but would make any hip-hop head
rewind the tape to hear what was just said. Q-Tip's dolphin voice meshed perfectly
with Phife's enthusiastic flow. Bottom line: "Low End Theory" made you happy.
#8 "Only Built For Cuban Linx ..." — Raekwon 1995
Hut yo, guess who's the black Trump?
The ability to tell a story goes a long way, and Raekwon did so in spitting an array of
"darts" (Raekwon's word for lyrics) on his first solo album. Within a series of inter
ludes from A1 Pacino's "Scarface," Raekwon discussed everything from wallabee
shoes to how to categorize females like flavors of ice cream to questions about heav
en and hell. The album also demonstrated the amazing abilities of RZA behind the
production boards and had a plethora of guests, including nearly everyone in the Wu
tangClan.
#9 "Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde" — The Pharcyde 1992
We drove into the drive-in and she didn't have to pay/Because we dressed her up to
look just like a Chevrolet
The Pharcyde came out of nowhere with their comedic verses and unexpected antics
to make rap fun once again. In a time when gangsta rap's grim presence controlled hip
hop, the Pharcyde produced a light-spirited album that laughed at everything from
themselves to other people's mothers. Although the album did not break through
commercially, it created a buzz with the instant classic "Passing Me By," which dis
cussed their inabilities to attract the opposite sex.
#10 "Illadelph Halflife" — The Roots 1996
The principles of true hip-hop have been forsaken / It's all contractual and about money
making
The Roots established themselves as the first live hip-hop band and then began the
hip-hop / jazz fusion. On their third album, they put together their strongest effort by
showing their incredible versatility to do anything and everything. They had a beat
box, political awareness, live instruments, troubling issues of lost love, the devotion for
hip-hop and much more. The album featured the bass-infected "Clones" and the
opera-like "Concerto of the Desperado." Never had a hip-hop album connected on so
many different fronts.
