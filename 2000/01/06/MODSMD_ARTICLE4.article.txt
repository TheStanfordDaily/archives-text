## 
### Nathaniel Tulloch Contributing writer 
The latest construction on cam
pus is apparent to everyone with a
Stanford mailing address: renova
tions are about to begin on the post
office in White Plaza. Meanwhile,
on Monday the temporary facility,
located under a tent on Levin Field
next to Florence Moore Hall,
opened for business.
The temporary facility may
have longer full-service lines. Ac
cording to Bill Johnston of the
Registrar's Office, although the
number of total employees re
mains th esam e, th e number of win -
dow clerks has been reduced from
five to three, due to space limita
tions.
"The lines are really long,"
freshman Dave Kenny said. "Even
worse than at the old post office."
However, Johnston insists that
the post office is doing well. "They
really bent over backwards for us
here. This temporary facility cost
$S(K),(KK). and Stanford didn't have

The temporary post office facility on Levin Field has been plagued by long lines at full-service counters,
as the trailer has forced postal officials to reduce the number of counters from five to three.
to pay for any of it."
Construction of the temporary
facility started in late September; it
is expected to be in use until next
September. The renovated post of
fice in White Plaza is scheduled to
be finished by the start of fall quar
ter.
When asked how he thinks the
transition was carried out, freshman
Matt Hooks said, "I think it was
done pretty well. It was really easy
to gel my key, and the building isn't
that faraway."
This week, the old building is un
dergoing asbestos removal. Con
struction will then begin. The build
ing is being gutted and refurbished
to provide a setup much like the

temporary facility. P.O. boxes will
be located in alcoves set up around
the main office.
The whole facility will be en
closed in a lighted, glass-walled
building, accessible 24 hours a day.
When the reconstruction is finished,
the P.O. boxes of the temporary fa
cility will be moved to the renovated
building. Students will not need to
change box numbers or keys again.
By today, all of the mail left in the
old boxes should be relocated to the
new facility. Mail sent to the old box
addresses will be rerouted to the
new ones for about 15 months.
New P.O. box listings are avail
able on Axess and are also posted in
Tresidder lounge. Keys are avail
able in the lower-level room B-6 in
Old Union on Jan. 5 and 6; after
that, students can pick them up at
the temporary facility.
