## Andrew Curry talks to Bob Zmuda 
### 
Comedian Andy Kaufman's edgy performance art forever changed American humor.
More than 15 years after his death, Jim Carrey and director Milos Forman have brought
his career hack into the spotlight with their new movie, "Man on the Moon." Intermis
sion interviewed Kaufman's close friend and long-time writer Boh Zmuda to get the in
side scoop on Kaufman, Carrey and the making of the movie.

It's hard not to watch Andy Kaufman. Looking at old clips of Kaufman performing,
you quickly realize that it's almost impossible to look away. Andy Kaufman at his best

was like a multiple-injury pileup on the freeway — a uisturD
ing spectacle you can't stop watching, no matter how much
you might like to. It wasn't like he had an offensive act;
rather, it was that he had no act, that he often wasn't funny,
that he was determined to live his life as an elaborate private
joke with no punch line.
Though Kaufman is most famous for his role as the sweet,
befuddled Latka Gravas on the sitcom "Taxi," his true lega
cy lies elsewhere. Kaufman's exploits still rank high among
the edgiest stuff ever broadcast on national television. He

brought a touch of the bizarre to the first "Saturday Night Live'" episode, sipping from
a glass of water and lip-synching to the "Mighty Mouse" theme song; shattered David
Letterman's composure in an infamous explosion with pro wrestler Jerry Lawler that
must have pushed "Late Night's" censors to their limits; angered audiences across the
country by giving "The Great Gatsby" readings instead of the stand-up they expected;
baffled fans with his single-minded devotion to wrestling women; and crossed into
schizophrenia with his alter-ego, the abusive lounge lizard Tony Clifton.
Kaufman's comedy was all about messing with people's heads. He was an expert at
taking audiences to the edge of discomfort and then beyond it, leaving them unsure
what was part of the act and what was real. In a "New Yorker" interview, Kaufman ex
plained the origins of his comedy. "1 realized that all my life I'd been laughed at, and I
used to not like it, and that's why I was so unhappy. So I started using it. Not being
laughed with, being laughed at."
It's easy to forget many people at the time just didn't get it. After years as a regular
guest on "Saturday Night Live," the show's viewers voted him off the show in 1982;
people not only didn't find him funny but found his off-stage antics offensive.
Kaufman's career ended in 19H4, when he succumbed at the age of 35 to a rare form
of lung cancer. His greatest fear, Kaufman's friend and writer Bob Zmuda said in our
interview, was being remembered as a sitcom star.
"Andy Kaufman, on his deathbed, asked me to do two things. One was write a book
about him and the other was to produce a movie about him," Zmuda said. "He was
very aware when he was dying that a young corpse could propel him to legendary fame.
He was very afraid of being remembered as Latka on Taxi, of that being his claim to
fame. That scared him worse than death."
With "Man on the Moon," a biopic starring a magnificent Jim Carrey as Kaufman
in all his pop-eyed intensity, Kaufman's legacy as an artist on the edge should be safe.
The movie has sparked a surge of interest in his work and focuses more on Kaufman's
relentless battles with conformity than on the "Taxi" work that made him famous.
"Man on the Moon," which gets its title from an R.E.M. song about Kaufman, is di
rected by Milos Forman, the Academy Award-winning director of such tormented
loner-genius films as" Amadeus," "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and"The Peo
ple vs. Larry Flynt." Though Forman's direction is good, the real force behind the
movie is Carrey, who goes so far beyond impersonating Kaufman that he seems to be
channeling the late comic's ghost.
Carrey's acting captures the essence of Kaufman, who was more of a performance
artist than a comedian. "Andy Kaufman's about the practical joke, the hoax, the put
on. It's a lost art form," Zmuda said. "Jim really loved bringing that back, and I think
you'll see a lot of Kaufman-esque influences in his work over the next couple of years."
Carrey's obsession with Kaufman is obvious in the depth of the personality he cre
ates through the movie. The lengths he went to in playing Kaufman were legendary
even before the movie came out. Carrey stayed in character for the entire shoot, in
sisting on being addressed as Andy by the rest of the cast and maintaining the role even
after hours.
Most surprising, Carrey even insisted on using the method-acting approach when it
came to Kaufman's offensive alter ego, the garish lounge singer Tony Clifton. Played
alternately by Kaufman and Zmuda, the Clifton character so offended audiences that
when he opened for Rodney Dangerfield the producers strung chicken wire across the
stage for protection against thrown bottles. Carrey embraced this dark side of Kauf
man, capturing the whole person.
"Jim [Carrey's] approach to this role was to look at Kaufman's blueprint Jim
made the decision to approach this role just as Andy Kaufman would have," Zmuda
explained. "We shot for K5 days, and Jim Carrey was only there for two, and that was
only because we needed voice-overs, Tony was out sick and Jim's a good impression
ist. For [the rest of the shoot], half the time he was Andy, the rest he was Tony He'd
come in separate cars, and his contract insisted on two separate parking spaces, one
with Andy's name on it and the other with Tony's."
The method acting sometimes reached absurd heights, such as the day Carrey (as

Clifton and Kaufman) got in a fight with
himself on the set.
"One day we had a half-day shoot — the
first half was Tony Clifton and the second
half was Andy," Zmuda recalled. "Well, the
next thing we knew people on the set were
very upset. Andy showed up with a bloody
nose, saying that he had passed Tony Clifton
as he was leaving the studio and that Tony
had punched him out. I don't know if it was
real blood or stage blood, but the medic was
brought in, and he was treated."
By all accounts, Carrey has been a Kauf
man fan for ages. On "A Comedy Salute to
Andy Kaufman," a television tribute taped
in 1995, Carrey cites Kaufman as an inspira
tion and model. "Jim Carrey is the biggest
Andy Kaufman freak in the world," Zmuda
said. "If he wasn't Jim Carrey he could trav
el the country lecturing on Kaufmanism.
He's very influenced by him and thought
Kaufman was one of the most influential
people in American humor."
Carrey's obsession with Kaufman (they
even share birthdays) made him the
perfect — if not the most obvious — choice
to play Kaufman in the film. Yet when cast-

ing for "Man on the Moon" started, Forman insisted on audition tapes, unheard of for
the crowd of A-list Hollywood stars looking to play Kaufman.
"I was not a believer in the beginning — I always thought Nicholas Cage looked
more like Andy Kaufman, and this was before "The Truman Show," when he was still
eating the scenery in 'Ace Ventura,' " Zmuda said. "So he calls me to ask if I'll come
over to look at his audition tape, and I'm driving over there convinced the thing's
gonna suck eggs He puts the tape in and it isn't even on fora minute and I'm cry
ing like a baby. If somebody had given me this tape and hadn't told me it was Jim, I
would have thought it was Andy. Once everybody saw the tape, he had the role —
there was just something about him."
That something made Carrey almost manic in his pursuit of the tiniest details about
Kaufman's character, his personality and his life. Getting everything exactly right was
especially important in a biopic of a comic who is still on TV in reruns and old clips.
"He was just unrelenting in his knowledge about Kaufman. He downloaded me,
Lynn Margulies [Kaufman's girlfriend) and George Shapiro months before we first
started shooting," Zmuda said. "Come day 21 [of shooting] he began to exhibit Kauf
man-esque behavior that none of us had told him about, which freaked out Lynn and
some of the crew members, who thought he was channeling Andy.... 1 don't believe
in that stuff. I think he was so good at method acting that he knew just how Andy would
react."
The rest of the "Man on the Moon" cast reinforces the accuracy of the biography.
With the exception of Danny DeVito, who plays Kaufman's agent George Shapiro in
the movie, Kaufman's fellow "Taxi" cast members play themselves, and Carrey blends
into the recreated scenes perfectly. Pro wrestler Jerry Lawler and David Letterman
play themselves in the infamous clash on Letterman's show.
Other cast choices also keep the biography rolling, with only slight fictionalization.
A decent Courtney Love plays longtime Kaufman girlfriend Lynn Margulies, and
character actor Paul Giamatti plays Zmuda.
For anyone interested in finding out more about Kaufman's life, "Man on the
Moon" is a great film. Where Forman and the screenwriters, Larry Karaszewski and
Scott Alexander, the same team that put together "The People vs. Larry Flynt," fall
short is in explaining who Kaufman was. The movie plays more like a dramatized trib
ute, full of reenacted comedy highlights, than an exploration of an incredibly complex
character.
The Kaufman character in "Man on the Moon" makes the most sense. Carrey plays
Kaufman as a lovable, wily comic genius who worked hard at creating a controversial
public image. The reality, though, was far more complex and far less comprehensible.
Kaufman held down a minimum wage job as a busboy while still a "Taxi" cast mem
ber, something that wasn't publicized until after his death. Wrestling women was much
more than a publicity stunt — he wrestled close to 4(X) women, and Zmuda says he had
to be specially taped down before his "Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion" matches so
his erections wouldn't show on TV. For Kaufman, there was no line between public
and private — he was always on, always unsettling.
Turning Kaufman into a sympathetic hero may be the movie's greatest failing.
"Man on the Moon" plays out Kaufman's life the way Kaufman would have hated —
as a hilarious joke the audience is in on the whole time. The result is a genuinely funny
movie that gives away Kaufman's secrets. In the process, it loses all of the embarrass
ing, uncomfortable tension Kaufman created so effortlessly in his act and his life.
