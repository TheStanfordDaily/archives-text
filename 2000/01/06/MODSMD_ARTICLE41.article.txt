# Woody Allen's latest is more 'Sweet' than 'Lowdown'
## 
### 
To be honest, 1 was worried about seeing Woody
Allen's latest film, "Sweet and Lowdown." Al
though he has long been one of my favorite direc
tors, his previous two movies, "Celebrity" and "Decon
structing Harry," though occasionally hilarious, had
been quite dark and difficult to enjoy. Furthermore, the
film stars Sean Penn, an actor whom, despite his obvious

talent, 1 often find unlikable.
So it is a tribute to both
Allen's exceptional skill as a
writer / director and Penn's
charisma that the actor, while
playing an egotistical, klepto
maniacal, selfish and dim-wit
ted misogynist, not only carries
the picture but comes off as

quite sympathetic.
"Sweet" is about the life of a mythical '30s jazz gui
tarist, Emmet Ray (Penn). Narrated in the present day
by various jazz historians as well as Allen himself, the
story unfolds as these men talk about Emmet's legendary
exploits. The technique is similar to Allen's 1984 classic
"Broadway Danny Rose," and it allows him to blend fan
tasy and reality in a way that lightens the tone of what
could have been quite a dark piece.
While Emmet never existed, his character is very rec
ognizable: the tempramental artistic genius whose in
credible musical prowess is rivaled only by his self-de
structive tendencies. Despite this familiarity, however,
the film feels quite fresh. Indeed, unlike most movies
about a "troubled" artist, "Sweet" maintains its humor, a
key component to most Woody Allen films.

"Sweet" never gets bogged down in psy
chological analysis of how Emmet came to
be this way. Instead, the film does mock
Uma Thurman's character, Blanche, a pre
tentious socialite who tries to probe into
Emmet's childhood for clues to his psyche.
The acceptance of the musician for what he
initially is (i.e. a vain, uneducated braggart
deeply afraid of commitment who, like all
Allen protagonists, is relentlessly neurotic)
allows fora subtle look at what it is that
changes him.
Central to this change is Emmet's rela
tionship with a mute laundress, Hattie,
played touchingly by Samantha Morton.
Hattie is a near-angelic presence in the pic
ture and mirrors many of Emmet's sweet
characteristics, such as his generosity, his
child-like innocence and his occasional star-

struck blackouts. He faints whenever he sees the leg
endary gypsy musician Django Reinhardt, the only gui
tarist in the world whom Emmet admits is better than
him; Hattie goes into a trance-like state when kissed by a
movie star. The difference between the two is that, unlike
Hattie, Emmet tries to hide his true nature behind a care
free, tough-guy facade.
While Woody Allen's funny and bittersweet screen
play is, as always, skillfully written, what elevates "Sweet
and Lowdown" to the upper echelon of the director's
work is Sean Penn's acting and the film's musical score.
Penn is mesmerizing, and though he is on the screen al
most the entire movie, we never tire of him. The '30s jazz

guitar pieces, chosen by Dick Hyman and played by
Howard Alden. are spectacular. The film's numerous
musical interludes, which could potentially have stopped
the movie dead in its tracks, instead enrich it, capturing
the attention of even the most casual jazz fan.
Perhaps "Sweet and Lowdown" signals a return by
Allen to the warmth of films like "Everyone Says 1 Love
You" and "Radio Days." Having rid himself of the bit
terness and venom of his past couple pictures, he will
hopefully continue to make movies filled with characters
he actually likes.
