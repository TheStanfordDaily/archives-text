# A 						miracle 'Mile' everyone should visit

### 
Director Frank Darabont has
nearly outshined his previous
Steven King adaptation. "The
Shawshank Redemption," now more
than five years old, is easily one of the top
five films of this decade. Now, with Tom

Hanks as a
believable
death-row
prison guard
in"The
Green
Mile,"
Darabont
employs ele-

ments of religious faith and humor not
found in "Shawshank."
As Paul Edgecomb, Hanks does not
have a particularly flashy role, and he

wisely allows other characters to pace the
film. Most notable is Michael Clarke
Duncan, who should garner a supporting
actor Oscar nomination for his amazing
turn as the slow-witted healer, John Cof
fey. "Like the liquor, only spelled differ
ently," John would always say. John is
central to the whole plot, which consists of
his placement on death row — for two
murders he probably didn't commit.
What could have bogged into a series
of mindless episodes with idiosyncratic
prisoners never forms. Instead, we are
treated to a mouse-caretaker, Eduard
Delacroix (Michael Jeter), and a particu
larly evil brat, "Wild Bill" Wharton (Sam
Rockwell). As an aside, criticisms that the
mouse is downright annoying are over
played and exaggerated. The mouse is an

important element from start to finish,
and it actually provides a moment or two
of light laughter in the midst of a very dif
ficult and moving film.
One of the more amusing and well
drafted characters is Percy Wetmore
(Doug Hutchinson), who is a weaselish
man with high connections and very few
wits about him. His integrity is, well, just
about flushed down the toilet once he be
latedly finally realizes how much of an un
likable scoundrel he has become.
And my personal favorite, James
Cromwell, has a small role as Warden Hal
Morris, whose wife is suffering from a life
threatening brain tumor. Ever since his
career-making turn in "Babe," Cromwell
has tackled movies such as "L.A. Confi
dential" and"The General's Daughter."

Here he shines again, this time turning on
the emotional juices up a notch.
The symbolic meaning does not be
come too heavy-handed, and it is intrinsic
to how the movie propels itself. John can
perform some amazing stunts, and these
may need to encompass some light and
sound effects. It makes the story itself a bit
whimsical, but that also can play in the
movie's favor. A very believable fable.
Oh, and you might find one thing par
ticularly deft, regardless of whether you
see "The Green Mile." Think a moment
about the healer's initials.
In any case, symbolism and characters
aside, "The Green Mile" is one tough, ex
hausting film completely worthy of your
time. Hopefully the Academy will also
take the three hours to consider all of its
multi-faceted roles and complex themes.
