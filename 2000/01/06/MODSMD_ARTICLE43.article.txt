						'Mother lode of humanity and warmth in Spain
## 
### 
As tasteful as it is eccentric, Pedro Almodivar's
"All About My Mother" is beauty for the eye
and soul. The film's simple humanity captures
the lives of four very different women living in Spain as
their worlds collide with the death of a teenage boy.
Manuela, wonderfully portrayed by Cecelia Roth, is a

nurse who coordinates the
transplant program at a local
hospital in Madrid. Having
left her husband in Barcelona
about two decades ago, she
lives alone with her teenage
son Esteban (Eloy Azorin).
Estaban loves his mother
but feels his life is incomplete

without any information about his father. On his 17th
birthday, he wanted to ask his mother to tell him about

his father as a birthday present. However, on the night of
his birthday, he dies while chasing a car fora autograph
of diva Huma Rojo (Marisa Paredes), whom he has just
seen in a performance of "A Streetcar Named Desire."
Manuela is devastated by the loss and ironically must
make the decision of whether to transplant his organs.
While she handles such procedure every day, Manuela's
heart is broken, and she cannot face the loss of her son.
In an attempt to escape her sadness, Manuela leaves
her job and flees to Barcelona in hopes of finding her hus
band Lola and telling him about their only son. She
knows that when she left Lola years ago he had already
become a transveslite, and when she searches the areas
he used to frequent she runs into an old friend, transves
lite prostitute La Agrado (Antonia San Juan).
To help her look fora job. La Agrado leads Manuela
to a beautiful young nun, Sister Rosa. However,

Manuela is suddenly hired by Huma Rojo, the diva who
is now performing "A Streetcar Named Desire in
Barcelona." Manuela visits her backstage one evening
and Huma immediately trusts her and asks her to be a
personal assistant to the actresses of the show.
As the stories of each woman unravels, one is sur
prised by how much beauty and commonality can exist
between a middle-aged mother in mourning, a young
nun, a transvestite and a diva of the stage.
Without losing its heart, the film features cinematog
raphy that captures each scene's mood. Throughout the
movie, the audience sees Spain through the eyes of
Manuela, for whom each moment is a discovery, re
demption and hope that love will overcome loss.
The film is in Spanish and the women are unfamiliar
ly eccentric, but "All About My Mother" touched me in
a very simple and basic way, reminding me of my most in
describable emotions: loss and love.
