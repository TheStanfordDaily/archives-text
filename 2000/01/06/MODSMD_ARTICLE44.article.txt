Sentimen-

tal cheese? You bet. But don't let that stop you from
missing one of the better films out there, as evidenced by
its Best Screenplay award from the National Board of
Review or its two Golden Globe nominations for screen
play and supporting actor.
In the somewhat tired coming-of-age genre, "The
Cider House Rules" goes beyond typical movie fodder
with sparkling acting and Lasse Hallstrom's excellent di
rection. A lot of credit goes to John Irving himself, who
spent more than a decade working on the film's screen
play.
Tobey Maguire heads the cast of relative unknowns
as Homer Wells, an orphan who grows up in the back
country of 1940s Maine at an orphanage called St.
Cloud's. Under the tutelage of head doctor Wilbur
Larch, played superbly by Michael Cainc, Homer learns
the importance of being "of use" no matter where his life

may lead him.
Dr. Larch's personal convictions, which
include giving illegal abortions to women in
need, seem to clash with Homer's anti
abortion stance despite the fact that his ob
stetrical-gynecological skills have been
honed as a result of growing up as the doc
tor's assistant.
When Homer makes the decision to
leave the orphanage to see the world, he
finds himself stationed with an apple-pick
ing team of African-Americans (headed by
Delroy Lindo) at a cider house. Tacked up
on the wall is a list of rules — hence the
title.
Meanwhile, he gets to know a couple,
Candy and Wally, who recently visited St.
Cloud's for abortion purposes. Wally goes
off to the war, and Candy and Homer be
come involved in a risky love affair that be
comes complicated with Wally's imminent
return.

Charlize Theron's Candy is a bit one-dimensional,
most likely due to the fact that a more expanded devel
opment of her character torn between two men could not
find its way into a two-hour movie. Indeed, Irving's novel
spanned Homer's entire life, with a lot of emphasis on his
childhood years that have been cut from the screen ver
sion entirely.
But it is Tobey Maguire's acting as Homer, and the re
lationship he develops with Caine's Dr. Larch that really
allow this movie to shine. The types of life lessons that
Homer learns on his journey — as in how one sometimes
needs to break the standard rules and create one's own

rules in order to be appropriately useful to oneself and
everyone else — are the lovey yet gratifying ideals that
always seem to permeate John Irving's expansive, styl
ized writing.
"The Cider House Rules" may not be as compelling
as its literary counterpart, but what Irving has drafted
onto the screen works impressively well. It just goes to
show what kind of a quality movie can spring out when a
screenwriter also happens to be a real writer and not
some Hollywood corporate whore making films for prof
it's sake alone.
