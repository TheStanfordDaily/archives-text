# New 'Heights' reached by latest Levinson film
## 
### 
With his charming new film "Lib
erty Heights," Barry Levinson
goes back to hi's roots, back to
the beloved Baltimore that has already
given him such wonderful material
("Diner," "Tin Men," "Avalon"), and
emerges with a sweet, thoughtful and
often hilarious film about growing up
Jewish in 1950s Baltimore.

The movie opens with a curious juxta
position. It is the autumn of 1954 — a
time suggesting unrest, with the Brown v.
Board of Education decision reintegrat
ing schools. The film examines the confu
sion between the minorities and the viru
lent discrimination against Jews and
blacks—for example, one of the first
scenes focuses on a sign that reads "No
Jews, Dogs or Coloreds."
But the movie also begins with the
idyllic sounds of birds chirping and
schoolchildren playing, with a casual
serenity that reflects the true nature of

this very heartfelt film. The plot follows a
relaxed trajectory, unfolding unhurriedly
in a series of small vignettes, interweaving
the stories of the three males of the Kurtz
man family.
The film's social issues underscore
each episode in the film, but eventually
we become more concerned with the
workings of this delightful family and with
the uncertainty of adolescent romance as
seen through the eyes of brothers Van
(Adrien Brody) and the younger Ben
(played by the adorable and skillful new
comer Ben Foster).
Ben's voice-over narration frames
"Liberty Heights." His tales digress into a
recollection of his youth, including when
he ate lunch at a friend's house and was
slightly disturbed that the bread was
white, not wheat, and not even toasted. A
confused Ben goes to his mother (Bebe
Neuwirth) for guidance and learns that
his friend is a gentile — the oft-whispered
about "other kind" — and that really, 99
percent of the world is "the other kind."
We see that Ben lacks a sense of histo
ry and of religion. This a kid who dresses
up as Hitler for Halloween and who
equates the daily recitation of the 23rd
psalm with the singing of "The Star-Span
gled Banner" — a necessary step before
the game begins. I le also naively underes-

Both brothers are drawn
to the forbidden 9 girl;
just as Ben tries to step
across color lines, Van
attempts to bridge the
gap between Jew and
gentile.

timates the repercussions of his pursual of
one of the new black girls in the class,
Sylvia (Rebekah Johnson).
Both brothers are drawn to the "for
bidden" girl; just as Ben tries to step
across color lines, Van attempts to bridge
the gap between Jew and gentile. Van's
story begins when he goes to a Halloween
party and falls for beautiful, blond ice
princess Dubbie (Carolyn Murphy) who
is dressed as a fairy queen, complete with
magic wand and tiara.
The male trio is completed by their fa
ther, whose trouble centers around ailing
business ventures. Nate's burlesque
house is going under, and his even less
reputable business, the under-the-table
numbers racket, has hit an unforeseen
glitch. Plus, he's in debt to a small-time

black criminal named Little Melvin (Or
lando Jones).
The film is sentimental, no doubt, yet it
is tempered with irony and ebullient vital
ity, such as when Ben goes to an all-black
theater to see James Brown. Levinson
fans will appreciate the boys retreat to a
familiar haunt, the Fells Point Diner (the
same one featured in "Diner") to swap
random thoughts on the finer points ol
love and religion. Just as in "Diner," these
fresh dialogues are filled with typical
inane hypotheticals that provide hilarious
insight into the male psyche.
At times, Levinson dips into goofy
melodrama — I had a hard time taking
Little Melvin's ghetto-drug-dealer type
seriously, and in general, the father's
whole burlesque / numbers racket sub
plot is not quite as captivating as his sons'
fumbling attempts at romance.
The film ends on a note of rueful nos
talgia as the ever-wise Ben laments the
loss of images from childhood: "If 1 knew
things would no longer be," he says,"I
would have tried to remember them bet
ter." But Levinson seems to have no trou
ble recreating his uncertain but exuberant
adolescence with wonderfully vibrant
precision and poignancy.
