# A
						fiery Tom Cruise leads an all-star cast in 'Magnolia

From the get-go, it's hard to take your eyes off of
Paul Thomas Anderson's "Magnolia." In fact, my
advice to you is that you pay close attention to the
first 10 minutes of the film, because you won't realize its
importance until the whirring events over the next 170
minutes whiz by.
Yes, there are a lot of characters to focus on. Yes,

these characters will
eventually (and pre
dictably) interact
with each other. But
Anderson's follow
up to his astounding
"Boogie Nights"
boasts a deft touch to
moviemaking seen

in few other directors or screenwriters.
Tom Cruise, already tapped fora Golden Globe sup
porting actor nod, is the sure-fire highlight. His role as
Frank T.J. Mackey, a fire-and-brimstone misogynist, is
perhaps one of his most difficult to pull off with serious
ness. And frank he is. At times, it is hard to sit through his
hateful and sexist remarks, but in a way I am reminded of
religious preachers or Zhirinovsky-like nationalists who,
for whatever reason, have poured countless hours and
energy into destroying the opposition.
He fits into one of three story mainframes. Also in
volved with Frank are Linda (Julianne Moore) and a
dying Earl Partridge (Jason Robards), along with nurse
Phil Parma (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Moore and

Hoffman picked up National Board of Review honors
for supporting actress and actor. This is probably the
most compelling portion of the movie, as we have to en
dure periodic flip-flops between plots.
The second plot focuses on Jimmy Gator, a veteran
game show host, who is also in his last days. He seeks help

from his wife Rose (Melinda Dillon) and

his daughter Claudia (Melora

Walters). For reasons re-

vealed in the movie,

Claudia is reluctant

to help out her fa
ther.

The final part
of the triumvi
rant structure
involves Stan
ley (Jeremy

Blackman), a
child prodigy on

Jimmy's game show.

He is strongly paralleled

with "Whiz Kid Donnie

Smith" (William H. Macy, in an-

other good performance), a previous

winner on the same program. Donnie eventually be-

comes so desperate with his life that he commits a crime,
and good-hearted, pious police officer Jim Kurring
(John C. Reilly) is there to put things into perspective.
This probably sounds way too confusing. The prob

lem is the similarity and seeming banality of elements.
Both Linda and Claudia are crazily yelling or complain
ing for much of their screen time, and Earl and Jimmy are
both cancer-stricken with wives at their side and plenty
of guilt buried in their hearts.
But I guess therein lies part of the magic of "Magno-

lia," which takes full advantage of coin-

one time you should definitely stop to

cidence to map out a day in

Southern California's San

Fernando Valley. I

can't say this film is

perfect or com-!
, pletely likeable.l

What I can at
test to is An
derson's vi
sionary ability
to make the au-

' dience think and
react, even if it's in

an uncomfortable

manner. "Magnolia" is

a one long haul to sit

through in its entirety, but this is

smell the flowers.
