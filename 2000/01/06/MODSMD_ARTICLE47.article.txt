# Jewel's debut 'Ride' is a little bumpy
## 
### 
£ ■ Ide with the Devil," a new Civil War
drama currently in limited release, is the
JL of movie you stop thinking about
soon after leaving the theater. Now there is a place
for those kinds of movies, but it is obvious that this
movie is trying to be a "significant human drama,"

and it falls a tad short.
The movie's
main failing is its frag
mented story. It's hard
to say something dra
matically significant
happens until halfway
into the film. Plus, it is
quite difficult to identi-

fy with the characters. This is certainly not the
sweeping epic director Ang Lee ("The Ice Storm")
was going for.
As it is, the movie functions as a number of in-

teresting tales with humorous moments, which isn't too bad for something that could
have wound up as a grandiose yet overstuffed war story. The stories are quite modest,
tracing the travels of Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire), who is of Northern descent but
was raised Southern and joins a rag-tag group fighting the Union in Kansas and Mis
souri.
These are, by large, men of honor, or so Roedel believes. He sees the Southerners
as having honor and the Northerners as lacking it, and the Northerners as wanting to
control the Southerners and Southerners as wanting to be leit alone. Of course, such
simple characterizations are betrayed when his Southern allies decimate a town,
slaughtering its male inhabitants. When Roedel refuses to do so, he gets a little "friend
ly fire" as his honorable reward.

Also among Roedel's close-knit group
are his best friend, Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ul
rich), fellow Southerner George Clyde (Simon
Baker-Denny) and Clyde's right-hand man, Holt
(Jeffrey Wright). Holt is technically a slave but is
treated as a free man by Clyde. Holt is especially
good at killing Yankees, we are told. Of course, his
loyalties change as the film progresses.
The big buzz of the movie is singer
Jewel's acting debut as the token love-interest,
Sue Lee Shelley, and she neither impresses nor
disappoints. Shelley shows the prejudices of the
time and place, but is otherwise the warm yet re
served Southern belle we'd expect.
The great moments in this otherwise av
erage film are ones of humor and reflection, which
get to the heart of the morbid issues of war. Such
a scene occurs after Roedel loses a finger and in a
moment of dark humor says it's a good thing be-

cause at least his comrades will be able to identify his body when he dies on the battle
ground. Roedel isn't too happy about being deformed, though. He recognizes he is the
runt and, with Northern heritage, the outsider — and thus the most likely to die. Still,
he keeps his sense of humor and tries to keep his grounding when it seems to be slip
ping away for other^.
In Roedel's war, as in most wars, hate trumps idealism when atrocities are viewed
from up close. Eventually the weariness of war affects the attitudes and activities of the
survivors. "Ride with the Devil" succeeds in telling this story, in spite of its lack of focus
and its higher aspirations.
