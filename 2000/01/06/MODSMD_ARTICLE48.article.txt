# 'Talented' storymaking leaves too many stones unturned

There's no question: "The Talented Mr. Ripley" is
in the same vein as director Anthony Minghella's
previous acclaimed effort, "The English Patient."
It's definitely love it or hate it for most people. For me, I
see both films as high-quality fare, and I actually buy into
the concept of "Ripley" more than "Patient." Still, there

Matt Damon and Jude Law
exude the sort of acting tal
ents one might expect from
this time of the year.

Damon in particular has chosen a difficult role as the re
pressed, crafty Tom Ripley. There are times when
Damon makes you stare in awe as he impersonates,
forges and transforms his way into others' lives with ease.
But first the story, which is not that complex. Tom is
sent to Europe to retrieve Dickie Greenleaf (Law), who
has been milking his father's funds to playboy his life
away. Dickie's girlfriend. Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth
Paltrow), takes a liking — at least initially — to Tom
once they bump into each other.

Tom, you see, is one of those ticking time
bombs. He has led a very droll life, and he is
shown back in the States as a man who seeks to
obtain the lifestyle of the rich and famous. Well,
he gets his chance after joining Dickie on nights
out to swanky jazz clubs and parties.
The problem I had during the movie (as well
as for several days afterward) is Tom's ultimate
goal and motivation. 1 understand he has no pre
meditated plan to go to Europe, but once he's
there, it is unclear why he does what he does.
Let's just say it involves just about anything and
everything, from the ridiculous to the unsettling.
You also have to speculate about the other char
acters' intentions, an ambiguity that makes the
film a bit frustrating.
I can't fault any of the actors, including a fine
supporting cast led by Cate Blanchett and Philip
Seymour Hoffman as two separate socialites fig
uring heavily into the Italian scenery. I also feel
that even though "Ripley" is about 20 minutes

shorter than "Patient," the movie periodically feels just
as long. The suspense at least kept me going, as a few un
expected events happen in Tom's life.
I'd encourage people to see "The Talented Mr. Rip

ley" even if they've heard negative things about it from
friends. After all, I think we can all identify with wanting
to be a fake somebody than a real nobody once in a while.
