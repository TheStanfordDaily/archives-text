# 'Days' disappoints

### 
Let me make this easy: DO NOT SEE THIS
MOVIE. (Editor's note: It's probably 100 late by
now, but perhaps you 'II agree with this reviewer's
pain.) Now you've been warned. "End of Days" isn't
even for Arnold die-hards, myself ineluded, since this is
his worst film by far. That's right, it ranks lower than
"Batman and Robin."
The plot: who cares. Satan comes to earth. The rea
son it's of interest is that it coincides with the millenni
um. He has to conceive a child at a specific time to open

the gates of Hell, and
Schwarzenegger has to
protect the girl and stop the
had guy, James Caan.
Oh wait, I'm get
ting this mixed up with an
other movie, "Eraser." I
found this happening to me
a lot during "End of Days."

We have the psycho derelict apartment of "Seven," the
moronic wise-cracking partner from "True Lies," and a
silly subway crash scene from "Speed." The writers
even have the audacity to blatantly swipe word-for
word the"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled ... "
line, one of the single most ingenious and recognizable
lines in recent film history, from"The Usual Suspects."
The acting leaves much to be desired. Arnold should
stick to either straight action flicks or films where he
gets to make fun of himself, such as "Twins" and "Ju
nior." Kevin Pollack is unbelievably irritating as
Schwarzenegger's cliched wiseguy partner, adopting a
role virtually identical to that of Tom Arnold in "True
Lies," only amazingly even more annoying and less
funny.
Gabriel Byrne is the only decent actor of the bunch,
but his role is just an identical carbon-copy of that of A1
Pacino in"The Devil's Advocate," only much duller.
To top it all off, moral issues such as the existence of
God and the apocalypse are insultingly simple and
heavy-handed. Go see "Dogma" instead.
Even the new Guns n' Roses song on the soundtrack
sucks too. Good Lord, "End of Days" sucks!
