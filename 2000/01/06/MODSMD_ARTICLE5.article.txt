## Petroleum Engineering Dept. loses two greats 
### Amy Christeson Contributing writer 
The Department of Petroleum
Engineering witnessed the passing
of two of its emeritus professors
last month. Frank Miller died of
liver cancer at the age of BX, and
Alvah Horn died at 82 after three
years of poor health.
Miller was the "father of.. . the
modern Department of Petroleum
Engineering,'" according to the de
partment's current chair, Roland
Home, in a letter announcing
Miller's and Horn's deaths. Miller
spent more than 20 years on Stan
ford's faculty.
After joining the faculty in 1953,
Miller helped develop the curricu
lum structure and authored nu
merous technical papers. He was
chair from 1957 to 197(i, during
which time lie increased the com
munication between the depart
ment and major oil companies.
Although Miller retired in 1976,
he continued to visit campus and
students until his death Miller is
remembered by the Frank (i.
Miller Fellowship, an honor given
each quarter to the highest-achiev
ing student in petroleum engineer
ing classes.
Miller spent many years at IJC-
Berkelev, where he earned his
bachelor's, master's and doctoral
degrees. He also served a major
in the U.S. Army during World
War 11.
After his retirement from Stan
ford. he was one of the principal in
vestigators for California's largest
geothernial geyser project.
He also served as an interna
tional eneruv consultant in loca

tions including Germany, Chile
and New Zealand.
Miller is survived by his daugh
ter, Patricia Miller Baldridge.
Horn served on the Stanford
faculty for 14 years, during which
time he was honored with the title
"One of Those Remarkable
Teachers at Stanford."
Horn was a consulting profes
sor, an oil and gas advisor to the
Board of Trustees and, as Dean of
Earth Sciences Franklin Orr stated
in a press release, a "much loved
member of (the] faculty."
He was also noted for his flair
and style, which included riding to
class on an energy-efficient moped
and lecturing about the Persian
Gulfs oil situation in Middle-East
ern attire. In 1979 I lorn was the Se
nior Class Day Speaker.
The annual Horn Lecture on
Energy that started in 1991 is also
one of Horn's legacies. Sir John
Brown, the CEO of BP-Amoco,
will give this spring's lecture.
I lorn was born in New Orleans.
He attended Stanford and received
his bachelor's degree in chemistry
in 1939.
After working for the Standard
Oil Company, Horn joined the
U.S. Navy during World War 11.
Before returning to Standard Oil
in 194fi. he earned a master's de
gree in acrological engineering
form the U.S. Naval Postgraduate
school. Horn and the late Ruth
Thornburg were married lor 50
years
Horn is survived by one broth
er. Steve Horn, two daughters,
Cindy Feshbach and Lynn Mc-
Carthy. six grandchildren and
three exeat-nrandchildrcn.
