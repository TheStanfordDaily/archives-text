Fantasia / 2000

★★ ★ ★

of hiking across Pasadena on New
Year's Day, I was almost too exhaust
ed to drive to the Irvine Spectrum

Center to join my folks
fora screening of "Fan
tasia / 2(XX)." Given my
previous track record
with IMAX movies
(that movie about
sharks had me snoring in
less than 10 minutes)
and my lack of patience
for sitting through the
1940 "Fantasia," I ex
pected to get a good
post-Rose-Bowl nap.
So I was surprised to
find myself not only
awake through the end
credits but more excited
and inspired by a Disney
movie than I have been
in years. Sure, movies
such as "Toy Story" and
"The Lion King" are to
tally e'ntertaining, but

"Fantasia/2000" gets you to appreci
ate the work of animators as pure art.
As the movie explains, Walt Dis
ney's vision with "Fantasia" was to
periodically release a series of anima
tions set to classical music. It's been
nearly 60 years since the first install
ment of this "work-in-progress," but
the quality of the seven new se
quences is a testament to how much

Disney animation has progressed
over the decades. Take the sequence
set to Respighi's "Pines of Rome," in
which a group of computer-animated
whales goes into an otherworldly mi
gration pattern. The combination of
computer models and hand drawings
isn't seamless, but the strengths of
both are used to create a feeling of
power and grandeur.
The increasing use of computers in
Disney animation is apparent here,
but some of the sequences stick to a

completely hand-drawn style. For
Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue," di
rector Eric Goldberg pays tribute to
A1 Hirschfeld, using the famous cari
caturist's line-based style in a Jazz
Age city setting. Gershwin's piece
clocks in at about 15 minutes, but
Goldberg's team did a great job of
holding our attention without dia
logue by creating Depression-weary

characters that immediately capture
our sympathy.
My favorite sequence is "The
Steadfast Tin Soldier," a Hans Chris
tian Andersen fairy tale set to part of
a Shostakovich piano concerto. It's a
bit like "Toy Story" in that it's com
puter-animated and gives breath to a
tin soldier, a music box ballerina and
a mean jack-in-the-box. But the com
puter models are so well-textured and
blended that you'd think this was a
picture-book of watercolor paintings

come to life. It's innova
tive, amazing stuff.
Celebrities such as
Steve Martin and Penn
and Teller make appear
ances to introduce each
segment. Some Disney fa
vorites are also featured:
Mickey Mouse and 'The
Sorcerer's Apprentice" —
arguably the best part of
the original "Fantasia" —
are restored from the 194()
film, and Donald Duck is
an assistant on Noah's Ark
on a sequence set to
"Pomp and Circum
stance."
"Fantasia / 20(H)"
is shorter than the typical
full-length Disney feature
and longer than the typical
IMAX production.

Moviegoers will find it hard to not be
entertained by at least one of the
eight segments, so I suggest that you
get some dormmates together and
take a trip to an IM AX theater (the
Tech Museum in San Jose, or the
Sony Metreon in San Francisco) as
soon as you can.

"The Steadfast Tin Soldier" is the best Disney addition to
the "Fantasia" experience.
