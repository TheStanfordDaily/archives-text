# Better than a Deuce' but not close to a 10

Consider why I had major doubts about "Deuce
Bigalow: Male Gigolo:" 1) The idea that some
movie exec thought Rob Schneider could carry
an entire movie; 2) the, um, subject matter; 3) a character
whose name is way more contrived than Christmas
Jones' in"The World is Not Enough." At least Christmas
was kept out of that title. In any case, "Deuce" should be

seen on the small
screen, if at all, and
preferably on a care
free night when the
mind is most willing.
"Deuce" isn't shy
about recycling
movies. Taking cues
from "Fast Times at

Ridgemont High," "The Full Monty" and — best of
all — "The Matrix," it takes (insert name of Adam San
dler movie here) and adds a bit of Schneider. But if you
think back to Sandler's great versatility on "Saturday
Night Live" (Cajun Man, Opera Man, etc.) compared to
what you remember Schneider for ("Ruuuth. Maaakin'
caaaw-peees."), you might get an idea of the difference in
quality.
The story begins inauspiciously as we are forced to go
along with the notion that Deuce Bigalow, a friendless
fish-tank cleaner, is also practically a vet. As he studies
the fish tank at the estate of a gigolo, Antoine (Oded
Fehr), he rattles off a diagnosis fora sluggish $8(X) fish.
Antoine has been called to Switzerland on "business," so
he enlists Deuce to baby-sit the fish while he is gone,
threatening him with death by medieval weapon if any-

thing in the house is damaged.
Predictably enough. Deuce screws up be
yond his worst nightmare. (The events lead
ing up to the destruction of Antoine's giant
fish tank are actually quite funny.) When a
friend in the fish-tank business tells him how
much it would cost to replace it. Deuce gets
desperate. The answer to his problems, he
finds, is on the other end of Antoine's phone
line.

Unschooled in the ways of "man-whor
ing," Deuce has some ugly run-ins, including
a fight over money with a female prostitute
that is redeemed only by her gymnastics
ability. Luckily, a pimp named T.J. with a
penchant for wet food arrives on his
doorstep and transforms him into a desir
able man.
At this point, Schneider fares much bet-

ter as he delves into material easier on his acting ability,
i.e., Mr. Nice Guy. His conscience gets the better of him,
and instead of sleeping with the women, T.J. arranges for
him to meet and make them feel good about themselves.
This is fortunate, as each of them by coincidence has a
bizarre condition that has been keeping her away from a
normal dating life. His most touching feat involves a
woman with Tourette's syndrome, yet it also exposes the
limits of Schneider's screenwriting range. The film ulti
mately relies too much on painful medical conditions for
laughs.
Even though T.J. warns him never to fall in love, and
an insecure cop with a burning desire to bust Antoine is

on his tail for prostitution, Deuce falls for one of his
dates, a Gwyneth Paltrow lookalike with yet another
bizarre occupation (hair transplant technician; Deuce's
father is a men's room attendant). Their almost-chem
istry and Deuce's generosity are a breather from the
cheap (and I mean cheap) bathroom humor.
If you can block out dramatized diarrhea and focus on
the flashes of absurdist creativity, you might enjoy
"Deuce Bigalow." T.J. and Antoine get the laughs, but
Rob Schneider has a long way to go before he makes a
"Wedding Singer."

Rob Schneider tries to keep a straight face as a male gigolo.
