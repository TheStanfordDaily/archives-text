The 1990s have been witness to the trend of chil
dren's movies becoming family movies, using
adult jokes and pop-culture aspects that an older
sibling or parent can enjoy while the little ones take in the
simpler pleasures of such films.
This is a trend that "Stuart Little" does not follow.
"Stuart" is an innocent fable targeted squarely at chil-

dren and loosely based
on the E. B. White book
series. Although it does
have its hip and snide
moments, the dominat
ing element is the simple
tale of Stuart, a mouse
adopted by the Little
family and treated as a

full-fledged member.
Of course, it helps somewhat that Stuart can talk and
generally do all the mental and physical things that a
human could do — provided that humans were only a
few inches tall. What is not so simple about "Stuart" is
the computer graphics rendering of a realistic mouse.
Some critics have called Stuart a bit too rodent-like, but
any way you cut it, he is seamlessly melded into this mov
ing family portrait. The realism is not so much to be ad
mired but rather is effective as a method by which this
old-fashioned story can be told with live action.
The Little family consists of Mrs. Little (Geena Davis,
"The Accidental Tourist"), Mr. Little (Hugh Laurie,
"Sense and Sensibility"), son George (Jonathan Lipnic-

ki, "Jerry Maguire") and family housecat Snow
ball (voiced by Nathan Lane, "The Birdcage").
They all feel something is missing from their fam
ily, so Mr. and Mrs. Little go to an adoption
agency headed by Mrs. Keeper (Julia Sweeney,
"Saturday Night Live").
They eventually get their pick of the litter, so to
speak, among several orphaned children and one
charming mouse, Stuart (voiced by Michael J.
Fox, "Spin City"). Although Mrs. Keeper advises
against interspecies adoption, the Littles know
that Stuart was meant to be with them.
George isn't too thrilled with his parents'
choice for his long-awaited younger brother, and
Snowball, well, he's thrilled fora different (and
not unexpected) reason. The family sets him
straight, but the conflicts are set in motion.
Can Stuart fit into the human world? Will
George and other family members learn to accept
Stuart as an equal? And will Snowball succeed in
ridding the house of the mouse, via his stomach or

the window? These are worked through various se
quences which are engaging, if not altogether unpre
dictable and devoid of cliche.
Although made for children, the movie can be enjoy
able even for those over the age of nine. The action
scenes are surprisingly thrilling, and the tender scenes —
though occasionally saccharine — are generally cute
and touching.
And like all fables, this one has a message, one not

only of tolerance but also of love and acceptance for
those who may seem different from us. Somehow people
are brought together into loving groups called families,
and who among us can say they cannot include a little
mouse?
Especially if he is as interesting and funny as Stuart
Little.
