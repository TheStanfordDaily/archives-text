## Killer Caresses

Sex. Alas for the days when
getting some was a person's sole
concern. Today, sexual contact
can expose you to a plethora of
sexually transmitted diseases
(STDs).
If you are, have been or ever
plan on becoming sexually ac
tive, you should know how to
best protect yourself. Otherwise,
you may lead a very short sex
life. And wouldn't that be a
shame?
Although the symptoms of
some STDs are simply unpleas
ant, most can lead to sterility,
cancer, complicated pregnancies
and even death.
All sexually active people
should complement safer sex
with an annual medical checkup
that includes an STD test. Speak
frankly about your sexuality
with your clinician to receive the
best possible care. If you experi
ence any pain or change in geni
tal appearance, smell or dis
charge, get tested immediately.
There are more than 30 dif
ferent STDs, and more than one
in four Americans will contract
at least one. People at highest
risk of contracting STDs are
those with multiple partners, a

prior history of STDs or an in
fected partner. Not surprisingly,
a disproportionate number of
these people are adolescents and
young adults.
Women account for about
half of all sexually transmitted
infections each year. However,
they tend to suffer more severe
long-term consequences than
men. Women are physiological
ly more susceptible to infection
and less likely to experience
symptoms, making detection
more difficult until serious prob
lems develop.
Unfortunately, only phone
sex and cyber sex are truly safe.
Any sexual contact with anoth
er human carries risk. Howev
er, safer sex techniques plus an
nual medical checkups can
help.
Ask for your partner's sexual
history early enough so that you
can make an educated decision
about whether to have inter
course. Bear in mind, however,
that many people lie out of
shame, embarrassment and dis
honesty.
Vaginal and anal intercourse
are the riskiest forms of contact.
During intercourse, latex con
doms protect most effectively
against both viral and bacterial
STDs ,as well as against preg

nancy. They form a physical bar
rier between you and your part
ner's bodily fluids. When used
with a condom, chemical contra
ceptives can increase protection
against pregnancy, but when
used alone, these methods have
greater failure rates and don't
protect against viruses such as
HIV.
Although safer than coital in
tercourse. oral sex also presents
a risk of STDs. Men should wear
a condom, and women should
use a dental dam, a sheet of latex
held between the female genitals
and her partner's mouth. A per
son performing oral sex should
not brush his or her teeth within
two hours of sexual contact be
cause toothbrushes create small
lacerations in the gums, which
increase the chances of contract
ing a disease.
When used correctly, con
doms rarely fail. Even so, pro
tected sex is not safe sex. Hepati
tis 1} can be spread through kiss
ing as well as sexual contact. Al
though a vaccination exists,
200,000 unvaccinated people
contract this STD annually, and
il untreated, it can cause liver
disease and death. Make sure
you've been vaccinated.
Condoms only cover the shaft
of the penis. Consequently, they

don't protect against genital
warts or genital herpes, common
STDs that affect the skin
throughout the male and female
genital regions. Caused by the
human papillomavirus (HPV),
genital warts can cause soft and
firm lesions. Herpes causes peri
odic outbreaks of blistery sores
that may itch and burn. Both are
spread by skin-to-skin contact.
Skin is most contagious when it
bears visible signs of infection
but even unaffected skin can
transmit the STDs.
Condoms can break or tear,
especially when worn improper
ly. Failure can expose you to a
host of STDs, with HIV being
the most famous. Between
650,(XX) and 9(X),000 Americans
are now living with HIV, and at
least 40,(XX) new HIV infections
occur each year. While new
drugs can increase the life quali
ty and expectancy of victims, this
STD is always lethal and has no
cure.

Other common STDs include
syphilis, chlamydia and gonor
rhea. All three are usually
asymptomatic but can be suc
cessfully treated with antibiotics.
Chlamydia, the most commonly
transmitted STD in the U.S., in
fects about 4 million Americans
each year and can cause sterility,
arthritis and blindness if untreat
ed. Syphilis can cause serious
damage to the nervous system,
heart, brain or other organs, pos
sibly leading to death. Gonor
rhea can cause sterility, arthritis
and heart problems.
It's a shame that sex today is
so scary. Once the coming to
gether of two people, sex is now
the union of two people and all
their microorganisms.
However, sexuality is still a
normal and enjoyable part of
being human. When handled re
sponsibly, sexual activity can be
enjoyed with as little risk as pos
sible. Keep the condoms com
ing.
