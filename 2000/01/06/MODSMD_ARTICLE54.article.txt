# A 						'Man' fit to be king of the schmaltz

Ido have to admit that "Bicentennial
Man" is a step up for Robin Williams
from the downright miserable "Patch
Adams." I admire director Chris Colum
bus for finding a way to constrain the fla
grantly wacky and at times annoying
Williams — here, he plays a coming-of
age robot for the Martin household.
The main issue I have with "Bicenten
nial Man" is not the underlying message
(which is largely benign and wholesome)

Bicentennial Man
Robin Williams
Sam Neill
132 minutes
Rated PC]
Flaying everywhere

but rather the overarching scope and lack
of meaningful drama. What could have
been an excellent 9()-minute holiday fea
tuic suffers from Titanic-sized schmaltz.
You know you're in for some tears if
James Horner, who penned the "Titanic"
score, is on Ixuird for the music. Actually,
he does a decent job jacking up the chords
when the moments are right. Take for in
stance the moment when Andrew

(Williams) is named by Little Miss (Hallie
Kate Eisenberg, the Pepsi commercial
girl), or when Andrew sees his master,
Richard (Sam Neill), pass away.
The duration of the movie turns out
to he 2(X) years, which makes fora long
sit for the kiddies. Come to think of it,
"Bicentennial Man" is far from being a
standard children's (or even family)

film. Issues ranging from sex to death
randomly pop up as Andrew grows from
being an infantile slave to a thinking
adult. 1 doubt anyone under 13 will get
more out of this film than the older folks
who may have been dragged along
against their will.
My personal favorite in the movie is
Oliver Piatt as mad scientist Rupert Bums.

Rupert stands for the radical changes in
science that Isaac Asimov (whose short
story is the basis for "Bicentennial Man")
may have envisioned. In fact, the sci-fi twist
on the drama is the only thing that really
kept me going. The visionary fantasy of a
futuristic San Francisco, complete with liv
ing cars and towering skyscrapers, is not
entirely unfeasible, at least within our gen
eration.
The emotional force is heavy-handed,
as we are supposed to feel for the grown
up Portia (Embeth Davidz, who also plays
the grown-up Little Miss), the grand
daughter of Little Miss who is slated to
marry the wrong man. Andrew and a Mar
tin, together at last? Spare me the melo
drama.
Regardless, "Bicentennial Man" is a so
so take on what place robotics may have in
the future. The symbolic overturning of
Andrew's enslavement and of society's
conventions is easy for us to see; what is not
so clear at the end is whether this money
happy future is inevitable, based on our
current capitalistic motivations. Robin
Williams Robots are fine and dandy, but
the imperfections of humans are immea
surable in terms of wealth.
