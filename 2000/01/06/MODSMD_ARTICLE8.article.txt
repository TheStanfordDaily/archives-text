## Chechen rebels persist 
### 
GROZNY, Russia (AP) —
Chechen fighters launched a strong
counterattack against Russian
forces in Grozny's northern out
skirts today, despite Moscow's
claims that the rebels were close to
collapse.
Rebel fighters retook parts of
the Grozny suburb of Khankala,
which Russian forces claimed to
have occupied days ago. By this
morning. Chechen militants con
trolled the southern half of the area.
An Associated Press reporter
witnessed heavy fighting today in
several other parts of Grozny and
its outskirts that the Russians had
claimed to have taken over in
recent days.
Russian soldiers, who spoke on
condition they not be named, said
that in one attack in Grozny's
southwest, rebel fighters captured
60 Russian troops. Russian officials
did not confirm the claim.
Chechen leaders said the attacks
marked the start of a change in the
war, adding that the Russian
advance into Chechnya would be
halted. A major Chechen counter
attack could be embarrassing to the
Russian government, which has
claimed it is close to defeating the
rebels.
"The period of the Russian
army's triumphant march through
Chechnya is over. A turning point
in the second war in Chechnya is
about to occur," said Chechen pres
idential administration chief Apti
Batalov, according to the Interfax
news agency.
But the Chechen offensive could
be short-lived. The rebels in
Grozny are reportedly short of
ammunition, although their spirits
appear to be high and they have
vowed to hold the shattered capital.
Khankala's streets were almost
empty by midday, with Chechen
snipers taking up positions in sever
al of the area's high-rise apartment
buildings.
Chechen commanders said they
had killed two Russian soldiers in
the fighting, but exact casualty fig
ures from both sides were not avail
able.
The Russian Defense Ministry
denied that the Chechen counterat
tack made any progress, and said
that eight Russian soldiers had been
killed in the past 24 hours across
Chechnya.
1 The attacks came a day after
Russia sent fresh ground troops

into the offensive to take Grozny
and claimed to have rebels trapped
in the city center.
Emerging from a meeting with
acting President Vladimir Putin in
Moscow today, Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev said federal forces
were regrouping in Grozny so that
rebel fighters wouldn't be able to
break out. He insisted that the Rus
sian offensive was not in trouble.
"The operation in Chechnya is
going according to plan. Acting
President Putin did not give the
forces additional objectives,"
Sergeyev said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
Federal forces kept up an
intense air and artillery attack of
Grozny today.
Russia has been wary of making
frontal assaults in Grozny, anxious
to avoid the huge losses it suffered
in a full-on attack during the IW4-
% war. In the current Chechnya
fighting, Russia has bombarded the
city with artillery and jets for
months, making probing ground
attacks.
Putin, whose popularity has
been boosted by his tough handling
of the war, said Tuesday that the
campaign had to be won to avoid
the disintegration of Russia and
that victory was his top priority.
"I'm absolutely convinced that
we won't be able to solve economic
or social problems if the state disin
tegrates. So, there is nothing unusu
al about us now paying such atten
tion to combating terrorism. We
must bring it to an end," he said in
an interview with the ORT televi
sion network.
The Russians claimed success in
southern Chechnya today, report
ing that they had taken control of
the Nozhai-Yurt district, near the
border with the Russian region of
Dagestan, Interfax said.
Scattered units of rebels who
had been in Nozhai-Yurt were
retreating southward under the
pressure of the Russian attack,
Interfax reported, citing sources in
the Russian Defense Ministry.
Russia quickly took control of
Chechnya's northern lowlands after
its campaign began in September,
and has directed much of its atten
tion in recent days to capturing the
southern mountains. But the fight
there was expected to drag on
because the rebels have strongholds
in the south, and the mountains
favor their hit-and-run tactics.
