NEW YORK (AP) â€” NBC said
today it will seek out more minori
ty writers, producers and directors
fbr its television shows, ending the
threat of an NAACP boycott
dgainst the network.
Similar deals may be near with
ABC, CBS and Fox, Kweisi
Mfume, president of the National
Association for the Advancement
Of Colored People, said as the deal
with NBC was announced.
What began last summer as a
protest against the scarcity of
minority cast members on the fall's
schedule of new network shows
eventually resulted in a deal that
almost exclusively affects people
behind the cameras.
If more minorities are in posi
tion to create shows and decide
what gets on the air, more diverse
casts and programming options will
naturally follow. Mfume said.

"We are continuing our work
with the other networks, but the
NBC model really becomes the
model for emulation," he said.
"NBC has come to realize that
we can and must do more," NBC
President Bob Wright said.
NBC has agreed to hire at least
one new minority writer next fall
for all its second-year shows, and is
encouraging producers to hire
minorities for free-lance writing
jobs. The network will also boost its
support for various job training and
internship programs to get more
minorities.
The NAACP had threatened a
boycott after complaining about
the "virtual whitewash" in new
programming. The organization
said if negotiations with other net
works don't bear fruit within the
next 10 days, it may still resort to a
boycott against them.
