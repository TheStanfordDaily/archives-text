## Editor's Notebook Reflecting on the past 
### 
At the end of the cen
tury, a Daily editor
looks back on his life

The year 2(XH) has arrived, and
people have been talking
change.
The Coffee House has been
revamped. Polio Key has been
changed to Hie Treehouse — "A Tra
dition at Stanford"? ITie freshmen
have been here longer than The Tree
house. The Graduate School of Busi
ness is expanding into electronic com
merce.
II the new Land Use Plan is
approved, even Maples Pavilion's
days are numbered.
On vacation during winter break, I
realized that I don't look back upon
my life enough. Iliis whole turn-of
the-millennium hype has had me
thinking about the future far too
much. So as we got closer and closer to
Armageddon, I couldn't help but
think of all those memories I've
ignored for a long time.
I remember my parents' Toyota
Cressida wagon. We sold that car off
years ago, but I still see it now and
again. It reminds me of heading to a
mountain cabin and my brother's
paper route and silting on my dad's
lap, pretending to drive.
1 remember fighting with my niece,
Vanessa, who is less than three years
my junior. I'm the youngest of my par
ents' children. Ilie second-youngest is
eight years older. Vanessa is really
more like a sibling than my five real
brothers and sisters. As kids, she hated
me, and I hated her. We both cried
when her mom re-married and moved
them off to Minnesota a lew years ago.
I remember my cousin Ulysses in

Mexico. He was my best friend there,
a brother for me when I was so far
from home. I remember his death. He
and a friend were playing with a gun,
and it went off accidentally. That was
four years after I had last seen or spo
ken to him. He's the only person I've
been close to and lost forever.
I remember Dodger games and
Fernando Valenzuela pitching. 1
remember Magic Johnson and Show
time. ITiey're a big reason why I'm in
journalism.
1 remember waking my brothers up
at 5 a.m. every December morning to
see if the gilts were under the tree yet.
I still don't know how my parents
managed to hide everything so well.
1 remember each day that I found
out my sisters were pregnant with my
nieces — except Vanessa. We hated
each other, remember? I remember
the day they were each born.
1 remember my first kiss, though I'd
often like to forget it. Middle school
can' be so akward.
I remember countless nights in my
friend Alben's garage. I'd roadie for
his band and we'd spend way too
many nights up until dawn, smoking
cigarettes and pondering all the things
high school boys deem important
enough to ponder: girls.
I remember getting into college. I
remember opting for Stanford instead
of Mi l', my first choice throughout
high school. Thank (iod I wised up.
I remember a lot of friends. Many 1
haven't spoken to or thought of in
years, but 1 remember a lot of phone
numbers and get tempted.
So for me, the book hasn't closed
on the 20th century yet. I'll never let it.
There have been too many laughs and
cries and people and places. I'll just
keep writing instead.
