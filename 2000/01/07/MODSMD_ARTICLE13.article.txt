Feedback to the Bridge
In an attempt to improve our services,
The Bridge Peer Counseling Center would
like feedback from the Stanford community.
For those unfamiliar with us. The Bridge is
an anonymous 24-hour peer counseling, and
information and referral service.
We have been an integral part of the
Stanford community since 1971, when Vin
cent D'Andrea created The Bridge as a drug
counseling center. Since then our services
have expanded to include more general
counseling as well as outreach programs
(massage and depression workshops) and a

class to teach counseling skills to anyone
interested.
Since we are anonymous we rarely get
feedback from those who use our service.
I lowcver, we value the opinions of those we
serve and would like to hear about experi
ences you have had with The Bridge,
whether they be positive or negative. II you
have any other suggestions for our service
please submit these as well.
Your opinions can be submitted anony
mously by mailing them to:
The Bridge
563 Salvatierra Walk
Stanford, CA 94305

Clinton for Stanford
presidency
Reading a recent New York Times article
reporting on President Clinton's latest mus
ings on what he'll do to post-presidency and
learning recently that The Farm's own pres
ident, Gerhard Casper, is retiring soon, 1
could not help but put two and two together.

Bill Clinton lor the Stanford presidency!
He has college teaching experience (he
taught at the University of Arkansas law
school), has a prestigious academic back
ground (Yale, Oxford and a Rhodes Schol
arship) and is widely respected for his intel
lect and his leadership abilities. Could you
imagine how much fundraising this man
could do (talk about high-level connec
tions)?
I think he'd make a fine University Pres
