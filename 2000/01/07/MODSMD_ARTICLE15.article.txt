## Alcohol, I love you more... 
### 
To give you an idea
of the kind of per
son I am, I'll tell
you that I spent the last
moments of 1999 asking
people if they knew who
wrote "Auld Lang Syne."
Of eourse. I was some-

what inebriated at the time, which brings
me to the topic of my column: alcohol.
A lot of people seem to be a fan of this
particular chemical, and when I say "a lot,"
I mean enough to comprise a large market
share 0f... everything. Other people, how
ever, maintain that alcohol may not in fact
be the best thing ever created by man and
like to quote statistics about drunk driving,
dying brain cells and decaying livers.
lo my thinking though, alcohol is a cen
tral foundation of modern society. Consid
er. for example, fraternities. Fraternal orga
nizations have been around now for a good
hundred years.
The purpose of these organizations, of
course, has been to socialize the next gener
ation of the ruling class and allow them to
establish a social network among them
selves in order to expand their power base
when they exploit the working class.
This being their central objective, we can
ask. "How do fraternities actually func
tion?" And to all outside appearance they
function mostly by having their members
get drunk out of their minds as often as pos
sible.
Of course, this is a bit of a cliche, but nev
ertheless it's basically the truth. Perhaps this
only shows that young men like to drink,
which is true. But still to me the fact that

society encourages the next generation of
its rulers to drink such copious amounts
must imply, at some level, a connection
between alcohol and power.
Besides sometimes making your teeth
numb and seriously impairing your ability
to operate heavy machinery, alcohol also
causes you to start caring about things you
would never think to care about when you
were sober.
Think about it: depending on the type of
guv you are. if someone flirts with your girl
friend a little too much, normally you'd
probably be a little annoyed, but you may
not necessarily try to lay him out cold. How
ever. if you have some alcohol in you, you
are actually much more likely to make
something of it. This is one of the main rea
sons why "bar fight" is a well known cliche
while "coffee house fight" is not.
Seriously though, alcohol causes you to
realize that life is made up of all the little
insults and signs of respect and tenderness
that people often like to write off as senti
mentalities. It is this awareness. I think, that
forms the connection between alcohol and
power. It is an awareness of and preoccupa
tion with all the "lovely intangibles" of this
world, such as honor and respect and love.
There are some religious people, such as
monks and Zen Buddhists, who say that
one should not worry about insults and
should "turn the other cheek." These peo
ple also sometimes say that one should not
worry about wealth, since money is not real
ly all that important. This is a fine, peaceful
theory and may even be true, hut it is not a
philosophy that will lead a person to wealth
and power.

And this is my point: in order to achieve
influence in the world, a person has to care
an awful lot about certain things, which
more "enlightened." or sober people, scoff
at.
And this is where alcohol comes in.
because if you drink enough, eventually you
begin to inherit certain of these beneficial
traits of inebriation while still able to walk
straight. You start caring about respect and
position and that sort of thing and. more
importantly, you start doing something
about them, which is an absolute prerequi
site for getting along with people.
We tend to think of alcohol as somewhat
of a foreign element in an otherwise sober
world. But in truth, the majority of crucial
decisions of world history were probably
made by drunk men.
Imagine in the 17 l X)s: Napoleon makes a
drunken wager with his advisors that he will
conquer all of Europe ami Russia. Or. a few
centuries earlier, Henry VIII decides to
show the Catholie Church what he really
thinks of it once and for all.
The world has been founded, molded
and established by alcohol. The Christians
tell us even God used to drink wine with the
prostitutes.
So here's to that remarkable compound:
it keeps the peasants content, the world
turning and the distilleries distilling.

Davis Kopp is a junior majoring in math
ematics, but he is still familiar with the
more famous works of Robert Burns, the
IHth century Scotch Poet.
