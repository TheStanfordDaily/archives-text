## Bench leads Card 
### Jim Tankersley Senior staff writer 
With four minutes gone by in
last night's 86-67 Stanford win
over Arizona State, Cardinal
head coach Mike Montgomery
turned to his bench and mo
tioned two players into the game.
One was a preseason All-
American. The other was the
team's leading scorer. Together,
they would dust off the Sun Dev
ils.
Senior Mark Madsen and
freshman Casey Jacobsen —
Montgomery's super-subs du
jour — combined for 38 points to
lead No. 1 Stanford to victory in
its Pacific 10 Conference opener.
Jacobsen topped all Cardinal
scorers with 24 points, and Mad
sen pulled down a game-high 13
rebounds.
After Jacobsen scored seven
first-half points and Madsen es
tablished a strong defensive pres
ence inside, Montgomery put
both men on the court to start the
second half. He stuck with them
the rest of the way, particularly
Jacobsen, who got hot from out
side and didn't sit until seven
minutes remained.
That two of the Cardinal's top
three scorers came off the bench
says a lot about the team's depth.
But Montgomery and his players
insist it doesn't mean a lineup
controversy is brewing.
"We all have roles on this
team," Jacobsen said. "No team
is going to be good without
everyone playing their role. Of
course, I'd like to get 40 minutes
a game, but I know that's not re
alistic."
Madsen, never one to talk
about himself, said the pieces fit
well regardless of the order in
which they're placed.
"We have a lot of firepower
from one to 12 on this team." he
said. "To have Casey come off
the bench is a plus. He's the best
pure shooter in college basket
ball."
Jacobsen has thrived all year
in the sixth-man role behind
David Moseley. Last night, the
pair took turns trying to contain
Sun Devil standout Eddie
House, who scored 24 points.
But the tag-team appeared to
wear House down in the second
half.
Moseley's playing time didn't
suffer with Jacobsen's big night
— the senior finished with 28
minutes to Jacobsen's 32. In
stead, junior starter Ryan
Mendez, who scored Stanford's
first seven points of the game,
found himself on the bench for
much of the second half.
Still. Jacobsen may not start
all year. But Madsen figures to
crack the lineup again soon. The
lone returning starter from last
year's Pac-10 championship
team and a preseason All-Amer
ica selection, Madsen started the
season opener New. 11 against
Duke but missed the next eight
games with a hamstring injury
He played 28 minutes against
Arizona State, his most since re
turning to action Dec. 29, and his
place as the team's senior leader
is well-secured. He flashed his
trademark Mad Dog intensity
late in the first half, when on one
possession he blocked a shot and
took a charge, giving the team a
needed lift into the locker
room.
If Montgomery knows if and
when Madsen will start again, he
isn't saying.
"I don't know,"he said.
"Might be next game, might be
March. 1 don't want it to be the
focal point."
