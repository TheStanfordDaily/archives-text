# Cardinal locks down the 'House' in win
## Jacobsen, Madsen lead Stanford to 86-67 win over pesky ASU 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Arizona State may have brought
Eddie House, but Stanford brought
its whole team.
Top-ranked Stanford (12-0, 1-0
Pacific 10 Conference), behind the
scoring of its freshman super-sub
Casey Jacobsen, and the reemer
gence of senior All-American Mark
Madsen, remained undefeated after
pulling away from Arizona State (8-
4,0-1) last night at Maples Pavilion in
the Pac-10 season opener for both
teams.
The 86-67 victory set up a highly
anticipated matchup Saturday with
No. 5 Arizona, which defeated Cali
fornia 65-61 in Berkeley Thursday.
"That's exactly what we expected
for the conference," said Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery. "A
win. especially a 20-point win, is hard
to come by."

While the Sun Devils took an
early seven-point lead, the Cardinal
moved back into the lead under the
unexpected leadership of sopho
more point guard Tony Giovacchini.
Giovacchini, who replaced Mike Mc-
Donald when he picked up his sec
ond foul early in the game, scored
five points and dished out four assists
to push Stanford to a 38-31 halftime
cushion.
"We like to get guys out with two
fouls who are in key positions,"
Montgomery said. "Tony gave us
some good relief. He seemed like he
was comfortable back there."
The Cardinal slowly built its lead
in the second half as it continued to
pound the ball inside, taking advan
tage of the Sun Devil's weaker front
court. Though Arizona State outre
bounded the Cardinal, foul trouble
eventually depleted the Sun Devils
presence.
"It's difficult for a team like ours,
which is not physical, to compete
with a team like Stanford," said Ari
zona State head coach Rob Evans.
"We played well for 27 or 28 minutes.
They finally wore us down late in the
game."
While the Sun Devils' superstar,
Eddie House, managed to score 24
points, his impact was limited, espe
cially in the second half.
"The coaches kept telling [senior
David Moseley] and me to minimize
his shot selection," said Jacobsen,
who had to guard 1 louse for much of
the evening. "They said keep him
under 30 points and we'll have a good
chance to win tonight."

That turned out to be true be
cause, as expected. House had little
support to augment his attack. While
the Sun Devils had some success con
trolling Stanford inside, they could
not get many points, other than from
sophomore center Chad Prewitt.
Prewitt scored 18 hard-earned points
to go along with 10 boards.
"Eddie House played well, but we
needed to get a little bit more help
from our other older guys," Evans
said.
While Madsen struggled early in
his role off the bench, he seemed
more than acclimated in the second
half, finishing with 14 points and 13
rebounds. And though junior Ryan
Mendez struggled with foul trouble
in the first half, he still was able to
post 13 points after scoring the Cardi
nal's first seven of the game.
While the 19-point margin might
appear like a blowout, the sometimes
sloppy, strangely officiated win was
indicative of what the defending Pac
-10 champion expects to see against
conference opponents.
"We have to say 'let all comers
come,"' Madsen said. "We can't ex
pect to get any calls. We have to play
through bad calls."
That's exactly what Stanford had
to do. especially in the first half.
With slightly more than three
minutes gone in the game, Mendez
was called for a questionable offen
sive foul as he collided with 1 louse on
a lavup. When Montgomery threw
his hands up and yelled in exaspera
tion, official Rich Ballestero called a
quick technical foul on the coach for
what Ballestero said was "a demon
strative gesture." Montgomery, and
the raucous Stanford crowd, would
not let Ballestero forget about it.
"That was bogus," Montgomery
said following the game. "That was
an agenda technical. If he could see
that, he should go home to Lois Lane
— his wife."
While Arizona barely survived a
scare from Cal at Haas Pavilion, the
Wildcats will surely bring a tougher
test. Still, the key could be Stanford's
overwhelming depth.
The Wildcats, depleted by trans
fers, have only eight scholarship play
ers on the roster.
Stanford, meanwhile, plavs a
good lOdeep. In fact, the Cardinal
subs outscored Arizona State's 43-14
Thursday.
