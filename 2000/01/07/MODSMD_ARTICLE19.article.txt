### 
BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) â€” Outworked and
outhustled by California, Arizona relied on
smarts and a little luck down the stretch.
Loren Woods scored 23 points, including two
key baskets over the final 1:30, and No. 5 Ari
zona beat California 65-61 Thursday night in the
teams' Pacific 10 Conference opener.
The Wildcats (12-2,1-0 Pac-10) staved off the
upset bid with clutch shooting and mistake-free
play in the late going after a slow start.
"As bad as we played for 20,25 minutes, that's
a relief," Woods said.
Cal (9-4, 0-1), which started four freshmen,
hurt itself by committing 14 of its 21 turnovers in
the second half, including two critical giveaways
in the last four minutes.
"It's obvious the team that played the hardest
didn't win," said Arizona coach Lute Olson,
whose Wildcats were outrebounded 46-31. "Cal
killed us on the inside boards and went to the
glass relentlessly each time underneath. (But) in
the end, they played like a young team and made

bad decisions and had too many turnovers."
Cal coach Ben Braun said the Bears' mistakes
were too much to overcome despite the intense
effort.
"We really played harder than Arizona. I
talked to Lute after the game and he even told
me that," Braun said. "This is a tough game to
swallow because we feel we were definitely good
enough tonight to get the win."
Michael Wright added 15 points and the
freshmen backcourt of Gilbert Arenas and Jason
Gardner had 10 points each for the Wildcats,
who won their conference opener for the third
time in four years while giving Olson his 599 th
career victory.
Olson will seek his next one Saturday, when
Arizona plays top-ranked Stanford.
"This trip is not going to be a picnic," Olson
said.
Nick Vander Laan's 14 points led Cal. while
Dennis Gales and Sean Lampley added 12 points
each.

The Wildcats were trailing 56-51 when they
put together a 7-0 burst, moving in front 58-56 on
a putback and two free throws by Wright.
Lampley grabbed an offensive rebound and
dunked to tie it at 58 but Arizona scored six
straight points, starting with Luke Walton's 6-
foot runner in the lane. Woods had a driving
layup off a feed from Gardner and then hit a
short turnaround jumper with 50 seconds re
maining.
Brian Wethers came back with a three-point
er but that was the last score for Cal. Gardner
made one of two free throws with 18 seconds left
and Joe Shipp and Lampley missed long jumpers
for Cal in the final seconds.
Arizona went in front 51-50 behind an 11-3
run that included three-pointers from Gardner
and Walton but Cal scored the next six points,
starting with a 15-foot jumper by Lampley to re
gain the lead.
Vander Laan scored 10 of his points in the
first half, when Cal led 40-35.
