# Express ticket to the Farm
## 470 admitted in early decision 
### Anne Cortina 
Alter months of waiting, 470 high school seniors
can breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that they will he
moving to the Farm in September. These early deci
sion applicants are the lucky ones out ofa pool of 2,087
Stanford hopefuls.
According to Robert Kinnally, dean of admission
and financial aid. the applicant pool was as strong as he
has come to expect in his three years at Stanford.
"As a group, the early decision applicants are al
ways outstanding." Kinnally said.
The accepted students, who are now committed to
attending Stanford, comprised 22.5 percent of the
early decision applicant pool. This is slightly lower
than last year, when 24 percent of early decision appli
cants received admission letters. The number of early
decision applicants was up slightly, from 2.009 last year
to 2.087.
This year marks the second year that Stanford has
had only one early decision option. Prior to that.
"Early Decision One" and "Early Decision Two" al
lowed applicants to choose between an earlier and
later date.
This option was eliminated last year because multi
ple deadlines were deemed confusing and unneces

sary.
"We consolidated the two rounds into one." said
Kinnally, based on the advice of high school guidance
counselors who complained of the complicated appli
cation procedures.
Similar results have come from both this year and
last year's early decision rounds. In addition to the
similar number of admitted students, the number of
deferred students is roughly the same as last year. In
1999, 250 were deferred, while in 2000. 257 were
passed along to the next round.
This year 1,356 applicants were denied admission.
The next step in the admissions process is to evalu
ate the regular decision applicants. According to Kin
nally, the number of applications received is similar to
last year's amount.
"We're starting on the regular applications today."
Kinnally said yesterday.
With less than 30 percent of the class of 2004 ac
counted for already, the regular and deferred early de
cision applicants may be facing a slightly stricter stan
dard this year. This year's unusually large freshman
class leaves less space for next year's class.
Though the space crunch was not a factor for early
decision applicants. Kinnally admitted, "it may be an
issue with the regular decision applicants."
