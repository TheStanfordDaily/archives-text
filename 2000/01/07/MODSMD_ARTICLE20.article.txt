### Katie Fitzpatrick 
The No. 11 women's Gymnastics team will
preview its 2(KX) season with a "Meet the
Team" event scheduled for tonight at 7p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion. The event will consist of
exhibitions of new skills and routines by the
gymnasts accompanied with narration by
third-year head coach Mark Cook.
Tonight's "Meet the Team" is an opportu
nity for the gymnasts to prepare for their first
competition in a relaxed atmosphere. As the
season approaches, the team will find it help

ful to perform their routines in front of a
crowd to simulate a competitive atmosphere.
"It's a good chance for some of our class
mates to watch us in a fun and non-stressful
setting," said sophomore Becky Meldrum.
Fellow sophomore Kristin Jensen agrees.
"It's a good opportunity for our fans to learn
about gymnastics."
Gymnasts will perform on all four appara
tus: vault, uneven parallel bars, balance beam
and floor exercise.
Vault performances will include 1998
NCAA Vault Champion Larissa Fontaine,

junior Jenny Wilson and freshman Alissa
Cooper. Uneven parallel bars will be high
lighted by Second Team Ail-American
Jensen, freshman sensation Abbv Gair and
freshman I.auren Cileitman.
School record holder Jennifer Exaltacion
will perform on the balance beam, as will
sophomore Katy Herbert and former Junior
Olympic National Champion Kclsey Still
inger.
Senior All-Amcrican Sarah Harding will
demonstrate a newly choreographed routine
in the floor exercise featuring a series of more

difficult tumbling passes and her trademark
artistic style.
This year's team returns three All-Ameri
cans: Fontaine, Harding and Jensen, as well
as nine letter-winners from last year's squad
which had one of the best seasons in Stanford
gymnastics history.
With the addition of five freshmen, this
squad will provide another year of excite
ment and will again challenge for the Pacific
10 Conference championship. The Cardinal
opens itsregular season Friday, Jan. 14, at
Arizona State.
