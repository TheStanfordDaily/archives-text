Can Stanford women jog at night
on campus and feel safe? ITie Stan
ford Intersorority Council hopes so
and this Sunday it is doing its part to
make make safety for Stanford
women at night a reality.
In an effort to increase awareness
about women's safety, the ISC is
sponsoring the Women's Safe Night
Run which begins this Sunday, Jan. 9
at 8 p.m. at the Tresidder Bollards.

Events will include a presentation on
safety at night and an informal 2.2
mile run / walk.
Previously this event has been
held in the spring, but because of the
attack on a runner at the dish on Oct.
17,1999, the ISC decided to "get the
event planned and ready sooner," ac
cording to ISC President Stephanie
Blossom.
Besides calling attention to this at
tack. Blossom hopes the event will
"raise awareness on campus about

night safety" while also promoting fit
ness. This event is being promoted
through e-mail and flyers around
campus and Blossom expects 50 to 60
women to participate but hopes that
100 or more will attend.
Jen Avery, ISC vice president of
programming and member of Chi
Omega, plans on participating in the
event and believes that is has the "po
tential to be a great event." Avery
said she believes she is safe on cam
pus but she only runs at night if she is

accompanied by a friend.
Victor M. Madrigal, associate di
rector of alumni programs for the
Stanford Alumni Association, be
lieves that such events are creative
and fun ways to "spread a positive
message about campus safety." He
said that it is important for campus or
ganizations to support events that
"promote a safe and healthy campus
environment" and the Alumni Asso
ciation is proud to support the
Women's Safe Night Run.
