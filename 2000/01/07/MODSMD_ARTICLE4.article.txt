## 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
In yet another change for the
Stanford Medical ( enter. I Jniversity
President Gerhard Casper an
nounced Wednesday that he was
separating the positions of vice presi
dent and dean of the medical center.
The idea of splitting the two posi
tions was originally explored in 1994.
I lowevcr. the plan was never imple
mented because of the merger be
tween IJCSF and Stanford.
In an open letter written Wednes
day. Casper said that in the wake of
the dissolution of the merger, it is
"highly desirable to revisit the 1994
reorganization plans."
Casper also said the separation
was necessary because of the size and
complexity of the medical center.
"The Medical Center is such a large,
complex and important part of the
university that all those in leadership
positions... are at times overextend
ed." he said.
Dr. Eugene Bauer, who is cur
rently dean and vice president of the
School of Medicine, will serve as vice
president of the School of Medicine.
I'rovost John Hennessv will appoint
a search committee to find candi
dates for the position of dean.
Casper said that due to the "ur
gent need to attend to issues resulting
from the dissolution of UCSF Stan
ford I lealth Care" the search com
mittee will be asked to nominate can
didates within a month.

Because of the depth of knowl
edge the new dean should possess
about the medical center. Casper
said he expects the committee to
focus on internal candidates. I iowev
er. he did not rule out the possibility
of the committee considering "very
promising outside candidates."
Bauer will continue to serve as
both vice president and dean until a
new dean is found.
" This is a critical time for Stanford
University and the Medical Center."
Bauer said. "Given the range and
complexity of the issues involving
land use and long-term planning, it is
crucial to put the decision-making
and planning under a single individ
ual."
As vice president. Bauer will hold
responsibility for creating a overall
clinical strategy and will have over
sight of Medical Center operations
and external affairs.
"One of the most exciting areas of
my new responsibilities will be the
opportunity to work together with
the new dean and leadership of the
hospitals... to forge a strong Medical
C 'enter alliance." Bauer said.
The dean will supervise the med
ical school's academic affairs and re
port to the provost.
"The new dean will oversee a ...
time in the field of medicine at Stan
ford. a period that will see increased
collaboration between the hard sci
ences such as chemistry and physics
and the life sciences such as biology
and medicine." Bauer said.
