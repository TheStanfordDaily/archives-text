loin Stoppard. the well known
author of both "Shakespeare in
Love" and the plav "Arcadia," will
be hosting a discussion as part of the
Stanford Book Program on Monda\
evening.
I he Book Program, instituted in
I WN by the Introduction to the I lu
manities program, aims to "unite the
freshman class, define their first year
at Stanford, and excite students
about the humanities." said Associ
ate Director of the l-llum Program
( hcri Ross.
As part of the program, freshmen
were given a complimentary copy of
the year's selected book. "Arcadia."
Participation in the Freshman
Book Program is voluntary.
"We simply encourage freshman
to read and discuss the book with
their friends and advisors," Ross said.
Since the class of 2(H)3 is neither re

quired to read "Arcadia" nor attend
the talk, the I-Hum program direc
tors "would be happy if at least one
third of the class came." Ross said.
Freshman (iabriel Montessaid. "I
think it was a neat opportunity that
we received the book for free, and it's
neater that [Stoppard] is coming
here. So if you don't go, it's a lost op
portunity."
Active participation in the event
will be integral to the question and
answer discourse. I-HIJM Teaching
Fellow Keila Diehl said. "I believe
[Stoppard] only agreed to come if the
event was purely a question / answer
dialogue, so it is important that the
students come prepared with ques
tions about 'Arcadia' and his other
work."
Stoppard's "Arcadia" fulfills a
purpose of I-Hum, added Diehl.
"()ne of the goals of the I-I lum pro
gram is to blur students' perceptions
of [science and humanities] bound-

Aries and encourage them to under
stand the relevance different disci
plines / departments have for one an
other," she said. "Stoppard exempli
fies this admirably in his work."
The l-l lum program chooses the
featured book and speaker through
an Area One Governance Board
nomination process. Ross says that
the Freshman Book is "chosen on its
merits as a text that is engaging, com
plex. and worthy of multiple read
ings."
Anyone interested in nominating
a book for the Freshman Book Pro
gram should e-mail

In addition to freshmen, other
Stanford community members and
