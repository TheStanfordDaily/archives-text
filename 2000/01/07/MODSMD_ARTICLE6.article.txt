Already anticipating next year's applications,
the Office of Undergraduate Admissions is com
mencing a project to update and improve its infor
mational video for prospective applicants.
Avery Willis, Class of 1999, is overseeing pro
duction of a 12 to 14 minute video that will high
light life at Stanford and the University's academ
ic stature.
The myriad changes to academic and student
life since the last video was produced in 1995 have
necessitated a new video.
In particular, the new video will highlight fresh
man and sophomore seminars.
It will also seek to capture an updated view of
Stanford student life and academics. "The prima
ry focus will be academic life," Willis said.
According to Willis, this new project will go be
yond just updating the old work and will take a dif
ferent approach It will be in a "film style," as op

posed to the interview and documentary styles of
previous videos.
Cameras will be distributed to a number of stu
dents so they can document their lives at Stanford.

Stanford's admissions video will be
among the finest in the country, if
not the best.'

These images will he combined with faculty
profiles and in-depth looks into the lives of five to
seven students.
The Admissions Office is in the process of se

video. The producers will follow these students,
get to know their lives at Stanford and convey
them to the viewers. Applications are still avail
able at the Admissions Office's Web site.

This video will be designed to reach the widest
audience possible and it will be accessible through
the Admissions Office's Web site.

of Admissions Office presentations around the
country and world.
It will be sent to approximately 7.500 high
schools around the nation. In addition, it will be
available free of charge to any applicant who re
quests it.

signed to be a key component in the recruiting and
admissions process in the coming years.

will be a representation of Stanford that is of the
highest quality.
"I am confident that under [Willis's] artistic and
creative leadership Stanford's admissions video
will be among the finest in the country, if not the
best." Wais said.
