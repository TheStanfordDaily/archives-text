## Abortion rates lowest since 1975 
### 
; ATLANTA (AP) — The num
ber of abortions in the United
States fell in 1997 to the lowest
ievel in two decades, despite new
drugs that make it easier to termi
nate a pregnancy.
The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention reported Thursday
that 20 of every I,(XH) women of
reproductive age (15 to 44) had
abortions in 1997, the same rate as
ihe previous two years and the low
est since 1975.
The number of abortions for
every I,(MM) live births dropped from
314 in 1996 to 305 in 1997 — also
the lowest since 1975, the CDC said.
The preliminary estimate of
1,184,758 legal abortions in 1997

was 3 percent less than the
1.221,585 abortions in 1996 and was
the lowest number performed since
1978.
The CDC cited several factors
for the decline, including reduced
access to abortion, an increased
willingness to use contraception
and possibly different attitudes
about the moral implications of
abortion.
For the first time, the annual
CDC report included a breakdown
from some states of which abor
tions were performed with surgery
and which with drugs. Previously,
states had reported only the total
number of abortions.
In 1997, 16 states reported 2,988

abortions induced by drugs. The
Alan Guttmacher Institute, an
abortion rights research organiza
tion. estimated there were 4.300
drug-induced abortions in all of the
United States during the first half
of 1997 alone.
The medications are touted as a
way to make the procedure more
private and convenient, without the
need for surgery. Women take the
medications under a doctor's super
vision during the first 49 days of
pregnancy.
Those on both sides of the
debate said the medications are
unlikely to affect the overall num
bers of abortions but might shift the
method away from surgery.
