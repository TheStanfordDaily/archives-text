Is it a Cold? Flu?
There's no way to cure a cold (it's a
virus, so antibiotics don't help).
But it you have influenza, quick
action can spare you many miser
able days. There are now medica
tions for the tin that reduce symp
toms and duration, but you must
get them early (within 24 - 48
hours).
The main characteristic of a cold is
a stopped-up, runny nose that lasts
three to seven days. Flu seldom
affects the nose, and is more
severe. I he chart below will help
you sort out what you've got.

In 1918 these Stanford students were
acutely aivare of the flu epidemic
that killed 501),000 in the United
States, and 20 million worldwide.
Now there's a shot to prevent flu,
and a pill to stop it in its tracks.
Colds
A cold is an infection of the upper
respiratory tract caused by one of
almost 2(X) different viruses. Stress,
fatigue, and a pixir diet can increase
your susceptibility to colds. Fortu
nately, you gradually become
immune to many of the common
ones in the environment, and catch
fewer and less severe ones.
Cold symptoms depend on the
particular virus you've caught.
They can include a runny nose,
sneezing, coughing, chills, sore
throat, and congestion.
What to do: Stay home to give
yourself a chance to get well, and to
spaa* others. An ordinary cold lasts
five to seven days. But call the
Medical Services Advice Line if it
lasts longer than ten days.
You can't cure the common cold,
but you can treat the symptoms:
■ Stay at home in a warm (but
not overheated) room
■ Increase the moisture in the air
(use a vaporizer or humidifier)
■ Drink at least two quarts of
fluids every day
■ Fake acetaminophen or ibupro
fin (if you're not allergic to them)
for aches and pains
■ Choose cold preparations that
have decongestants (i.e. pseude
phedrine); avoid antihistamines
(i.e., diphenhydramine)
FLU
■ Reserve cough suppressants
for nighttime
Flu
Flu (influenza), like a cold, is
caused by a virus, but the
symptoms are different. They come
on quickly (over hours), and are
severe. The main ones include a
fever of 101° or more, severe body
aches, and cough (though usually
mild). Typical cold symptoms -
runny nose, congestion, and sore
throat - are absent.
What to do: The best strategy for
the flu is to prevent getting infected
by getting a flu shot. If you have flu
symptoms, call the Medical Advice
Line a.s.a.p. to see if you should take
one of the new flu medications.
Amantidine and Rimantidine treat
influenza A; Relenza and Tamiflu
treat flus A and B. If you have had
close contact with someone who
has the flu, these medications can
also be taken to prevent it.
Is it Something Else?
The following symptoms may
indicate something other than a
cold or flu, so consult the Advice
Line - 4-CARE (4-2273) and press
#4 - if you have them.
■ A temperature of over 102°
■ Severe headaches or a stiff neck
■ Pain around your eyes or
over your sinuses
■ Throbbing ear pain
■ Severely swollen glands
■ Wheezing or chest pains when
you breathe
■ Close contact with someone
with strep throat
The upshot is this: tune into your
symptoms early on, and take appro
priate action. You'll feel better
sooner if you do.Q
