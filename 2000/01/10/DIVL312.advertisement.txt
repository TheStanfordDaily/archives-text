What would you do with
$250 billion?
At Janus, plenty. From day one, Janus research analysts help invest our $250 billion in assets by
digging deep. Searching for the best companies in the world. Which means getting way out of the
office. Visiting companies. Meeting captains of industry. Their employees. And their competition.
Basically, finding out what makes a company tick.
We're interested in analysts for general equities, technology, and biological sciences. If you're
interested in exploring a position with Janus as a research analyst, please submit your cover letter and resume
via email to Tom Malley at Janus (tom.malley@janus.com) byjanuary 19, 2000.
