The Organization of Business in Comparative Perspective

Professor Robert Freeland
Winter Quarter — Monday & Wednesday 1:15-2:30
(Classroom:GESB 124)
In the last two decades, the dramatic success and seeming superiority of
Japanese, German, and other foreign businesses over competitors in the
U.S. have inspired researchers to look outside America to the global
stage of business. Following this trend, this course examines the
relationship between business organizations, state economic policies,
and market competition in the U.S., Russia, Italy, Japan, China, Korea,
Taiwan, and other countries. The class will focus on how business
organizations and markets are organized, governed, and changed
within these societies and will take particular note of the state's role in
shaping these outcomes.
