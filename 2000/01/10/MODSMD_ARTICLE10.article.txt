MOZDOK. Russia (AP) —
Russian helicopter gunships rocket
ed rebel positions in Chechnya's
capital on Sunday as heavy street
fighting resumed after a brief lull
during Orthodox Christmas.
Russian troops were continuing
their push to take Grozny, the capi
tal. But in yet another sign that Rus
sia is still far from victory, rebel
forces launched new attacks outside
Grozny, assaulting federal trcxjps in
three towns and ambushing a Rus
sian troop column.
After steadily retreating over the

last few months, the rebels have
gone on the offensive in the past
week in Grozny and other parts of
the breakaway republic.
The Defense Ministry said its
forces encountered stiff resistance
from well-armed Chechen fighters
in Grozny but insisted that the
rebels were suffering high casualties.
The military said Sunday that it
was still refraining from bombard
ment of central Grozny, where
many civilians are hiding — and
where federal troops are trying to
overrun rebel positions. But artillery

continued to support ground units
trying to advance deep into Grozny,
and the ban on air bombardment
did not appear to extend beyond the
center of the city.
Commanders announced a
pause in bombing in Grozny's cen
ter on Friday, saying it was meant to
mark the Orthodox Christmas holi
day and to allow the thousands of
civilians trapped in Grozny to flee.
Only about 400 people left the
capital on Friday and Saturday, the
ITAR-Tass news agency quoted the
Ministry for Emergency Situations

as saying. Some 20.(XK) people are
believed to still be in the city, the
ministry said.
