SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va.
(AP) — Despite President Bill
Clinton's renewed intervention,
Israel-Syria negotiations on a land
for-peace treaty appeared to be
nearing a close Sunday without
even a tentative agreement.
The Israeli prime minister,
Ehud Barak, describing the week
long talks over territory, peace
terms, water and security as com
plex and difficult, was making
plans to depart for home Monday.
Diplomatic sources said Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa
was likely to follow on Tuesday.
On the sensitive issue of estab
lishing a new border, once Israel
pulls back on the Golan Heights,
Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy said "nothing has been
agreed upon."
Clinton, who had intervened in
the negotiations four times before
Sunday, headed back to the site of
the talks at nightfall Sunday. "He's
going for meetings." a White
I louse official said. "The process
continues."
Committees met Sunday on all
the key issues, and the State
Department spokesman James P.
Rubin said the two sides respond
ed positively to a statement pre
sented Friday by the United States.
The seven-page document,
which is a summary of points of
accord and discord, could become
the basis for an eventual "core
agreement." Rubin said.
But he said Israel and Syria still
faced "enormous decisions" and
"we don't expect those decisions
to be made in a matter of days."
American mediators had not
offered "bridging proposals"

designed to close the gap where
the two sides were in disagree
ment. Rubin added.
Barak and al-Sharaa could
leave behind experts to continue
deliberations. But Rubin said
there was no decision on how
negotiations would proceed,
although he said the United States
wanted full-blown negotiations to
reconvene "sooner rather than
later."
"There is no doubt that the
negotiation is difficult," Barak told
Israeli reporters while touring the
Antietam National Battlefield, a
Civil War site in Sharpsburg, Md.,
with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
In his first public remarks since
the talks began Jan. 3, Barak said
"the negotiation is very complex."
The prime minister, speaking
Hebrew, also gave assurances to
the Israeli public that "we will not
sign an agreement unless, in our
opinion, it will strengthen the secu
rity of Israel and address its vital
needs."
Israel is contemplating a with
drawal from the Golan Heights, a
border highground with a com
manding view of Syria, in
exchange for a peace treaty.
Barak, his wife, Nava, and Levy
were shown a documentary film
recreating the Antietam battle in
which North and South suffered
22,726 casualties on Sept. 17, 1862.
Albright then hosted a lun
cheon for Barak at Hillsboro, her
Virginia retreat across the border
from West Virginia, and returned
to the secluded negotiations site
just outside Shepherdstown to
meet with al-Sharaa.
