New admission video
should highlight unique
opportunities at Stanford

Imagine yourself as a high school
senior and a prospective Stan
ford applicant. You don't know
much about this "Farm," and
throughout your childhood you've
been encouraged to attend a certain
school or two in Massachusetts.
Then you see the new Stanford
admissions video. Clips of Big
Game, the Mausoleum Party and
Sunday Flicks run next to images of
Hoover Tower, Lane Lectures and
Faculty Night. You make the sudden
revelation that it is possible to enjoy
the sun while studying for a
midterm.
Maybe we don't spend all our
days in the sun, but the Stanford
undergraduate experience still goes
far beyond the Nobel Prize-winner
statistics and the academic advising
system.
Now the Office of Undergraduate
Admissions has provided the oppor
tunity to produce an informational
video from the perspective of cur
rent students. Past videos have
included sit-down interviews and
shots of laboratories and red-tiled
roofs â€” an effective method, but
one that isn't all-encompassing in
terms of student life. By putting
cameras in the hands of students for
"self-documentaries" and placing a
recent graduate, Avery Willis, in
charge of production, the University
can be confident that its next video
will be innovative and engaging to
high schoolers.
According to Willis, the new video

will focus primarily on academic life.
Given our students' traditional aca
demic excellence, this is the right
thing to emphasize, and the special
focus on freshman and sophomore
seminars is a great idea.
On the other hand, everyone in
the world is already aware of Stan
ford's strong academic reputation.
The new video should also open
prospective students' eyes to the
things that people don't know about
Stanford.
Why not show our students having
lots of fun? From ski trips at Lake
Tahoe to the rowdy Sixth Man Club,
undergraduates here find big ways to
unwind from the stress of classes.
Our video should highlight a capella
groups and Ultimate Frisbee, and it
would be practically worthless if it
didn't feature the spirit of the Band.
The new video should show the old
and the new. Green Library and the
Cantor Arts Center have been
restored to a new brilliance. Students
enjoy priceless works of art such as
Rodin's "The Thinker," and they have
the freedom to attend lectures online.
Prospective applicants might also
be interested in the success of our
alumni. It wouldn't hurt to show the
prominence of Stanford graduates in
politics, post-graduate academia and
Silicon Valley.
Most importantly, the new admis
sion video should ensure that the
right people become interested in
Stanford. We should be honest and
open about the hard work and its
payoffs, the facets of residential life
and the diversity of our students.
The closer this video comes to cap
turing the genuine Stanford experi
ence. the richer our application pool
will be.
