## Questions for the millennium

Govind Dandekar

The champagne has
been imbibed, Ihe
fireworks have
exploded and the new mil
lennium is already upon
us. Already, this new
epoch has presented
mankind with many
daunting philosophical

questions such as, "Will humans ever devel
op an internal combustion engine that uses
fecal matter as a source of power?" and
"Will the Kappa Sigs ever realize that most
Stanford students would prefer to be
repeatedly run over by a bus rather than
watching their pledges parade around in
bikinis?"
The answer to both of these questions is
a resounding and undeniable "No." Now
that I've settled these questions, let's move
on to my analysis of the upcoming presi
dential election.
Over winter break, most Stanford stu
dents return home to the sunnv beaches of
Southern California or the medical-waste
strewn beaches of the Northeast. I. howev
er. return to lowa. For those of you that
don't know what I'm referring to. lowa is a
large, square state. It lies in the vast and
mostly uncharted area of the country com
monly referred to as the "Midwest."
I ho benefits of returning to lowa for
winter break are twofold. One, if I stay out
side for more than 10 minutes, the extreme
temperature will cause my fingers to turn
green and fall off. Two, 1 get to find out
what raving imbeciles most presidential
candidates are six months before the rest of
the country does.
You see. everv four vears, lowa is the

first state to hold its presidential caucus.
These grassroots caucuses are quickly fol
lowed bv the first presidential primary in
the "Granite State" — New Hampshire.
Evidently, there is absolutely nothing more
exciting in New I lainpshire than granite, so
state residents were forced to make that the
state nickname. In order to compensate for
this rather bland nickname, citizens of New
Hampshire decided they needed a festive
and jovial state motto to draw in tourist dol
lars. They logically chose "Live Free or
Die."
And now, every political eye in the
nation is watching these two states. The
result is that lowa, a stale that consists of
roughly 3 million fickle farmers, and New
I lampshire, a state that consists of roughly I
million senile granite miners, carry as much
or more political clout than any other state
in the union.
The result of this attention is predictable.
Droves of presidential candidates fly to
lowa in futile attempts to win over the pop
ulation. And the lowans graciously accept
the advertising dollars of the candidates.
During the most intense campaign
months of December and January, candi
dates (especially the more desperate ones)
will go to any length to win votes. Two days
alter I came home from break, my dad
asked me to go outside to shovel some
snow, liy the time I put my coat on and
stepped outside, Orrin Hatch had already
cleared the driveway and sidewalk for me.
A few days later, my dad asked me to
pick up a suitable Christmas tree. In the
time it took me to walk to niv car, Steve
Forbes had already planted a redwood
sapling, nursed it to life, cut it down and

neatly mounted it on my living room floor.
Not surprisingly, George W. Bush hos a
significant (hut narrowing) lead over j{>hn
McCain in lowa. Bush, who grossed .more
money over the summer than "The Phan
tom Menace," is no longer paying for adver
tisement time or space in lowa. He simply
used his campaign money to buy out of
the major television and radio stations; and
has ordered them to constantly run "Biisli
for President" propaganda.
lowans are socially conservative, «£nd
there was much concern that Bush
lose the lowa vote when allegations about
his rumored drug use surfaced. Bush
allayed the fears of lowa voters by publicly
announcing in Cedar Rapids that hesjiad
not smoked crack in the past eight to-10
minutes.

However, Bush may have lost sonic
votes when a scheming newspaper reporter
asked him, "Who is Tony Blair?" A. con
fused Bush incorrectly identified Blair-qyhis
coke dealer back at Yale. Later in the'sipnc
interview. Bush misidentified the WTC> as
"the professional wrestling federation that
Hulk Hogan betrayed."
Sadly, the one GOP candidate that nlliny
lowans want to meet has wholly ignored the
state. John McCain has concentrated
112 -
almost all of his campaign resources ortNeu
Hampshire. So. on behalf of all lowajvi. I
would like to personally invite Mr. McCain
to come to lowa, preferably after a heV>
snowfall. JV
