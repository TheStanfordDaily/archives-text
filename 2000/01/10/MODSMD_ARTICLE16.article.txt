Sixth Man disappoints again
We felt the need to write this letter fol
lowing the men's basketball game against
Arizona. In the first priority game of the
season, Stanford's "most dedicated" fans
were supposed to be able to show their
unparalleled support for the men against
the nation's number four team. Instead, it
was the most disappointing exhibition of
fan support we have ever seen in our lives.
When a team faces its biggest rival, the
fans should step up their support when the
team needs it the post. But as usual, the
Sixth Man Club was quietest at the most
critical times, when the team was down a
few points and needed the inspiration to
make a comeback.
The five of us lost our voices during that
game, and that's how everyone should
leave. Instead it was so quiet that we could
hear a small number of Arizona fans cheer
ing their hearts out. Our cheers should
drown them out. It was so quiet; we could
even hear the players talking with each
other on the court from the back row of the
bleachers.

Our biggest concern is of fan support
when we are on the offensive end. This
should not be considered a 35-second
respite; it should be a time to increase
momentum and weaken the other team.
Not only did most fans not cheer at this
time, but we were repeatedly told by other
students to not cheer when we were on
offense.
Are you afraid we are going to psyche
out our own players? As elite athletes, they
have played in front of hostile crowds their
entire lives. The last time they had to play
in a silent gym was probably in third grade.
The players appreciate the positive energy
we transmit to them, and they feed off it.
To not cheer on offense is to silence your
self for half the game, and that is a shame.
The last year has also seen extensive
debate over how to judge the dedication of
student fans. Well, there is only one way to
judge them, and that is not by who shows
up at 6 a.m., who owns a silly white shirt or
who attends the most games. It should be
on how each fan supports their team during
the game.
Athletes are judged on a lot of things:

attitude, practicc ability and talent, but
what they are ultimately judged on above
all else is how they play on the court from
the opening tip to the final buzzer. Well,
Sixth Man members should be judged on
how they cheer from the opening tip to the
final buzzer too.
Until Stanford students realize that what
matters is the 40 minutes of game time and
not anything else, the Sixth Man Club will
continue to exist as a second-rate institu
tion at a first-class university.
Every person who didn't give their
entire effort during that game should be
embarrassed to have taken a floor seat
from more dedicated fans up in the rafters
or who had to stay home. Being a fan is not
about just seeing the game; that's what a
TV is for. Being a fan is about doing every
thing you can do to help your team win.
Stanford fans did noticeably rise to the
occasion at least once during the game. The
goal of every Sixth Man should be to be
warned at least four times a game for shak
ing the floor, starting at tip-off. With three
seconds left to play, the fans finally suc
ceeded in getting to the Arizona players.

Just imagine what we could do if we dis
played that kind of intensity for the entire
game.
People may criticize this letter for its
negative tone and lack of positive sugges
tions, but a list of suggestions has been sent
to [Sixth Man coordinator] John Hopkins,
and if lie feels any of them are worthwhile,
hopefully he will pass them on to the |e
mail] list.
As we left Maples Pavilion, we were not
ashamed of our team for one second; we
were proud that they played their hearts
out for 40 minutes. But we were ashamed
to be cheering when everyone else was
silent. We were ashamed that we sat next to
people who told us not to support our team.
And we were ashamed to be wearing Sixth
Man shirts. We hope we never have to feel
that way again.
