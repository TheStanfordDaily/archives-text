## Wildcats end Cardinal unbeaten streak Cold shooting plagues Card 
### Jim Tankersley Senior staff writer 
Casey Jacobsen learned a
hard lesson of college basketball
Saturday: Some days, the shots
just don't fall.
Mark Madsen jlist got a re
minder.
Jacobsen. the freshman phe
nom who has led Stanford in
scoring average this season
largely on the strength of his out
side shot, hit a major dry spell
against No. 5 Arizona Saturday,
Rallying just five points'on 2-of- c )
shooting. I le missed all six three
pointers he took.
I le had company in his woes.
Cardinal sharpshooters made
only 24 percent from beyond the
arc against the Wildcats; take
away senior David Moseley's 4-
for-8 performance, and the team
shot a miserable 2 for 17 from
downtown.
—- • Senior forward Madsen had
the most frustrating day down
low for Stanford. In his first start
since injuring a hamstring in the
team's season opener, the pre
season All-American made just
one of seven shots, going score
less until the last two minutes of
the game.
The Wildcats, meanwhile,
nailed five of seven three-point
ers and rolled to a 68-65 win to
take an early Pacific 10 Confer
ence lead.
A lired-up Arizona defense
deserves much of the credit for
Stanford's poor shooting Satur
day. The Wildcats stuck to Ja
cobsen. Moseley. Ryan Mendez,
Mike McDonald and l ony (iio
vacchini all afternoon, denying
the ball and putting a hand in the
lace of nearly every shooter.
The effort impressed Arizona
head coach I Lite ()lson. Stanford
has "unbelievable three-point
shooters," he said, "but they did
not have many open looks at
threes. I think our defense had a
lot to do with how they shot."
Stanford players, no strangers
to tight perimeter defense, had
their share of good looks at
three-pointers. But they suffered
a collective cold night shots
that fell lhursday against Ari
zona State and earlier in the pre
season |List wouldn't go down
Saturday.
Ihey also hurried through a
critical live-minute stretch at the
beginning of the second half,
when Arizona opened a 10-point
lead it would never give tip. In
that stretch, Madsen said, "we
rushed our shots."
"We quit making the extra pass,
finding the open guy," Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery
said. "Some of the shots were out of
rhythm, hut some of them were
shots we normally make."
The Cardinal's corps of big bod
ies inside means it can suffer
through a tough day from the out

side and still win games.
Saturday, though, one-footers
were bouncing off the rim just like
the 25-footers.
On several possessions, Cardi
nal post players tipped the ball
three or four times around the bas
ket, only to watch it roll every
which way but into the hoop.
Outside struggles can heap pres
sure on a team's front line to take
up the slack, but Stanford's men in
the post refused to blame their
teammates after the Arizona game.
"It is more difficult for the inside

players when the shots aren't drop
ping," Madsen said. "But 1 don't
think that was the case [Saturday]. I
missed a lot of open shots."
Both Madsen and Jacobsen —
the leaders in Thursday's 86-67
pounding of Arizona State —
played their worst games of the
year. But Montgomery doesn't
seem too worried about either the
veteran or the rookie.
"There's nothing to solve here,
it's not a problem set," he said. "We
have to play better. We need to
learn from this."
