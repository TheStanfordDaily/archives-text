I thought the better team won
today." said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "They came in
very poised in a tough environment.
lhe\ got open shots and they hit
open shots."
While Arizona had a lead as large
as 1 2 points in the second half, a furi
ous rally from the Cardinal cut it to
one with three seconds left in the
game.
I lowcver. alter being fouled by ju
nior Mike Mel)onaldon the inbound
play. Ari/ona freshman point guard
Jason (iardner iced the game by
calmk hitting two free throws, lie
fore shooting, (iardner. the game's
leading scorer with 22 points, em
ployed a favorite tactic of Ari/ona
coach I .ute Olsen by having the ref
erees force the crowd, specifically the
Sixth Man Section, to quit jumping
on the trampoline-like floor of
Maples Pa\ ilion.
Senior David Moselev's despera
tion heave at the buzzer from near

half-court would have sent the game
to overtime, hut the shot fell short.
While the ending was exciting, the
outcome of the first Pac-1() contest
between top-five teams in 11->l l -> years
was not much of a nail-biter.
After junior Ryan Mende/ re-es
tablished Stanford's nine-point lead
on a layup with <5:47 left in the first
half, the Wildcats took complete con
trol of the game, save for the last,
frantic 30 seconds.
The Cardinal's top two players.
Madsen and C'ascv Jacobsen. were
held to two and five points, respec
tively. on 3-of-16 shooting.
Though he pulled down eight re
bounds. Madsen's only points came
on a dunk with I:3b remaining. Earli
er. Madsen had missed two crucial
free throws, with just less than six
minutes remaining, and airballed a
five-foot jump hook and a jumper
from the free-throw line. Jacobsen
wast) forbbehind the three-point line
and was similarly unsuccessful in his
attempts to attack the basket.
"Mark is not a glide-and-slide
player," Montgomery said. "lie's a
grinder. Part of what he needs to do is
feel comfortable inside. I le's obvi
ously not as good as he would've
been had he not missed seven
weeks."
While Madsen said he is 1(H) per
cent healthy, he admitted his game
was not full-strength.
"I felt like 1 had my rhythm be
fore. but tonight I guess I didn't."
Madsen said.
Arizona's stilling defense must get
some of the credit for Stanford poor
offensive production. It held Stan
ford to 24 percent shooting from
three-point territory and 33.3 percent
overall.
Wright and Woods continually es
tablished superior position in the
frontcourt and effectively denied all
Inil the best placed entry passes into
the low post. When the Cardinal tried
lo kick the bal' outside, (iardner and
freshmen Gilbert Arenas and I .like
Walton, a replacement for starter
Richard Jefferson, w ho broke a bone
in his foot early in the first half, al
lowed few open looks.
"Wright is a warrior." Madsen
said, "lie is 245 pounds and very
quick, and Loren Woods is a great
shot blocker. That combination in
side is pretty dynamic."
Olsen seemed even more im
pressed with the job Walton did in
helping to limit the Cardinal's outside
attack.
"Luke Walton did a great job de
fensively." Olsen said. "We won
dered whether he'd be quick enough,
but he showed he's smart enough lo
make lip for it."
Woods, who finished with l(i

points. 12 rebounds ami loin blocks,
said the Wildcats' defense was even
more effective because of the ( ardi
nal's impatience on offense.
"I think Stanford played into our
hands b\ taking quick shots." Woods
noted.
While the los> crushed an\ far
fetched and enlirek unrealistic
dreams of Stanford finishing with I he
first undefeated season in Division I

since liuliniiii wen! .VvO in 1976. the
game might actually have worse long
lerm implications lor Arizona.
I lie loss ol'.lclTerson. an athletic,
slashing wing forward with unlimited
potential, adds to the Wildcats' al
rcad\ weights personnel problems.
Prioi to the game. Arizona had onl\
eight scholarship players on its roster.
With Jefferson and his 13 points and
("i\e rebounds now gone I<>i upward

of eight weeks, the \\ ildcats could be
down to seven scholarship players for
the length of the I'ac 1 0 season.
' I hat's a difficult thing lot us to

picked up his (il)Oth careei win. "Rut.

Redshirt freshman Jason Collins goes up for a shot against two Arizona guards during the Cardinal's
68-65 loss to the Wildcats on Saturday. Collins posted 11 points during the match.
Stanford, meanwhile, can use the
game as a learning experience. With
two months of conference games to
go and a dangerous trip to Oregon
State and Oregon this weekend, the
Cardinal has more than enough op
portunities to prove its strength.
"Nobody likes to lose at home,"
Montgomery said. "[But] we knew
at some point we were going to get
beat. These kids aren't going to dwell
on this."
And while the loss will knock
Stanford from the top of the polls, it
is not necessarily viewed as a bad
thing.
"It's disappointing to lose, but it's
sort of a nice not to have to worry
about that." Madsen said. "When we
became No. 1. David Moseley said
"now we'll have a bullseye on our

coach I .ute Olsen by having the ref

Sixth Man Section, to quit jumping
on the trampoline-like floor of
Maples Pa\ ilion.
Senior David Moselev's despera
tion heave at the buzzer from near

half-court would have sent the game
to overtime, hut the shot fell short.
While the ending was exciting, the
outcome of the first Pac-1() contest
between top-five teams in 11->l l -> years
was not much of a nail-biter.
After junior Ryan Mende/ re-es
tablished Stanford's nine-point lead
on a layup with <5:47 left in the first
half, the Wildcats took complete con
trol of the game, save for the last,
frantic 30 seconds.
The Cardinal's top two players.
Madsen and C'ascv Jacobsen. were
held to two and five points, respec
tively. on 3-of-16 shooting.
Though he pulled down eight re
bounds. Madsen's only points came
on a dunk with I:3b remaining. Earli
er. Madsen had missed two crucial
free throws, with just less than six
minutes remaining, and airballed a
five-foot jump hook and a jumper
from the free-throw line. Jacobsen
wast) forbbehind the three-point line
and was similarly unsuccessful in his
attempts to attack the basket.
"Mark is not a glide-and-slide
player," Montgomery said. "lie's a
grinder. Part of what he needs to do is
feel comfortable inside. I le's obvi
ously not as good as he would've
been had he not missed seven
weeks."
While Madsen said he is 1(H) per
cent healthy, he admitted his game
was not full-strength.
"I felt like 1 had my rhythm be
fore. but tonight I guess I didn't."
Madsen said.
Arizona's stilling defense must get
some of the credit for Stanford poor
offensive production. It held Stan
ford to 24 percent shooting from
three-point territory and 33.3 percent
overall.
Wright and Woods continually es
tablished superior position in the

lowed few open looks.
"Wright is a warrior." Madsen
said, "lie is 245 pounds and very
quick, and Loren Woods is a great
shot blocker. That combination in
side is pretty dynamic."
Olsen seemed even more im
pressed with the job Walton did in
helping to limit the Cardinal's outside
attack.
"Luke Walton did a great job de
fensively." Olsen said. "We won
dered whether he'd be quick enough,
but he showed he's smart enough lo
make lip for it."
Woods, who finished with l(i

points. 12 rebounds ami loin blocks,
said the Wildcats' defense was even
more effective because of the ( ardi
nal's impatience on offense.
"I think Stanford played into our

noted.

Redshirt freshman Jason Collins goes up for a shot against two Arizona guards during the Cardinal's
68-65 loss to the Wildcats on Saturday. Collins posted 11 points during the match.
Stanford, meanwhile, can use the
game as a learning experience. With
two months of conference games to
go and a dangerous trip to Oregon
State and Oregon this weekend, the
Cardinal has more than enough op
portunities to prove its strength.
"Nobody likes to lose at home,"
Montgomery said. "[But] we knew
at some point we were going to get
beat. These kids aren't going to dwell
on this."
And while the loss will knock
Stanford from the top of the polls, it
is not necessarily viewed as a bad
thing.
"It's disappointing to lose, but it's
sort of a nice not to have to worry
about that." Madsen said. "When we
became No. 1. David Moseley said
"now we'll have a bullseye on our
chest.' It'll be good to not have that
anymore."
1 1 was supposed to be a tri
umphant return forsertior All-Amer
ican Mark Madscn to No. 1 Stan
lord's starting lineup. But Michael
\\ right and fifth-ranked Arizona
would have none of it.
In an earlv-season matchup of the
Pacific 10 Conference's two heavy
weights. the Wildcats (13-2. 2-0 Pac
10) dominated the inside behind
Wright and 7-foot. 1-inch center
l.oren Woods and shut down the
("ardinal's (12-1. 1 -1) deadly perime
ter shooters to take a (iS-05 victory at
Maples Pax ilion.
The loss means Stanford will al
most certain!) fall from its position ;it
the top of the rankings — a spot
w hich it held for the past three weeks
when the Associated Press releas
