The Stanford Society of Asian
American Engineers (SSAE) is
once again launching a pivotal pro
gram to take the technological and
entrepreneurial spirit of the Univer
sity and the Silicon Valley area into
Asia.
As the Asia Technology Initia-

tive (ATI ).;i brainchild of the SSAE
seeking to "promote cross-cultural
understanding between Stanford
and Asian students through the joint
vehicles of technology education
and teamwork." enters its second
year, the goals of the program have
been revamped and expanded into a
more real-world, implementation
focused setting.
The summer of 1999 witnessed
the initial execution of the ATI pro
gram. where live Stanford business
and engineering students taught a
six-week course on Internet tech
nology and entrepreneurship to a
group of students at the Peking Uni
versity Attached I ligh School.
In spite of the widespread media

recognition and all-around success.
Stanford students who participated
in the program found the high
school, seminar-oriented program's
goals limited in scope and impact.
"This year we have expanded
upon our vision and shifted focus
from high school students to univer
sity students â€” individuals with im
mediate impact potential." said
Lingxian Ding, a junior computer
science major at Stanford who
taught in the program last year.
ATI 20(H) will set up start-up "in
cubators" in Hong Kong and Bei
jing. In each location, a five-person
Stanford team will join a similar
number of Chinese students from
the Chinese University of Hong
Kong and the Peking University for
10 to 12 weeks to run a real start-up
working on a small-scale e-com
merce project. "We want to foster a
cooperative, collaborative atmos
phere with college students in Asia."
said SSAE President Alex l.iu. a se
nior majoring in electrical engineer
ing.
The teams will have all the roles
of a real company, such as CEO and
technical lead In Hong Kong, stu
dents will also collaborate with the
Hong Kong Productivity Council
(HKPC), a government institution
that encourages academic/industry
collaboration, as well as entrepre
neurship. particularly in high-tech
nology sectors.
"What the HKPC brings to our
project, more than any specific fig
ure of support, is the imprimatur ol
government support, which'carries
more weight in Asia than it does
here." said Liu.
Another important element is
sponsorship by multinational com
panies. "The sponsoring companv is
