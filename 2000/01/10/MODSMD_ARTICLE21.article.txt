showed that wecancitmpetewith the
best teams and proved that we're
going to be a good team considering
that we are so voting with such few re
turning starters
Stanford started off the touma
ment on I hursday morning with a
three-game \ictoi \ over California
(15 S. 15 7.15-12). In a game fueled b\
the historic rivalry as well as the pres
sure of the season opener for both
teams, the Cardinal busted out earls
and nevet looked back.
" I he closest part of the match was
in the first hall ot the first game.' head
coach Ruben Nicves s;iid. 'Both
teams had a lot ol side outs and points
were hard to come by. But we pulled
away toward the end and then we
were in control of the match "
Nicves noted the strong passing of
outside hitters Seth Ring, a redshirt
freshman, and Marcus Skacel, a
sophomore. Ring also contributed to
the strong offensive effort with 10 kills
for a .571 hitting percentage, while
freshman Kyle Strache posted four
kills and a .666 hitting percentage.
Stanford advanced to play No. 3
seed UCSB and again shut down its
opponent in three games, 15-13,15-2,
15-12.
Junior middle blocker Brett
Youngberg led the offense with 20
kills, while Skacel boasted 15 and Ring
followed with 13. Nieves also praised
the strong offensive play of Lukens,
who went on to be named to the all
tournament team.
"It was a good win for us because
they are a conference opponent that
we had struggled to beat in a close five
game match this fall," Nieves said of
the team's preseason matchup with
the C jauchos. "It makes us feel good in

our improvement as a team."
On Friday, Stanford met Pepper
dine, a team ranked fourth nationally.
The C ardinal got off to a slow start and
had trouble putting the ball away on a
strong blocking team. In game two,
however, the Cardinal picked up the
tempo and improved its hitting and
spiker coverage.
"Although we lost the second
game," Nieves said. "We got momen
tum and turned around and controlled
game three."
Stanford went on to lead game four
4-0 before falling 15-12.
Freshman middle blocker and top
recruit Curt Toppel led with 19 kills.
Youngberg was close behind with 16
kills, and freshman middle blocker
Paul Bocage posted six kills in his first
collegiate start.
In the consolation round. No. 12
Loyola Marymount sent Stanford
home with a fourth-place finish.
Although Stanford did not pull out
the win, the game was beneficial as it
gave players who had seen little tour

nament time a chance to play.
"Because we were no longer in
contention for the championship and
the same group of players had played
plenty, and you don't want to risk in
jury due to overplaying," Nieves said.
"We played a completely different
group of players."
In his first collegiate start, fresh
man outside hitter William Curtis led
the offense with 20 kills, while fellow
freshman outside hitter Kyle Strache
contributed 13.
While all the tournament games
were deemed exhibition, the team
hopes to move to a l-() record this
weekend with its first conference
matchup, against UC-San Diego.
"Because we're a young team,
we're up and down like a roller coast
er," Lukens said. "We need to work
on keeping our focus and intensity.
But we have a gotxl chance of doing
well. We should make playoffs and be
one of the elite teams in the Pacific Di
vision [of the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation]."
