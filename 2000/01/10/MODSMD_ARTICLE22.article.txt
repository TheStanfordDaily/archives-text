Fitr, marking the end of Ramadan
with joint prayers and approximate
ly 12,(XX) Bay Area Muslims. The
celebration also featured the annual
Eid dinner, held this year at the New
Ma's Chinese food restaurant in
Mountain View.
"It's a time for Muslims to cele
brate, and to celebrate together. It's
no fun to be alone on Eid. We didn't
want anyone to feel like they had to
be just because they weren't with
family." ISSU officer Savra Khan

dekar, a junior, said.
"The main goal is for everyone to
just enjoy themselves and to be
thankful to God for this blessed
month," ISSU president, junior
Narjes Misherghi said.
Saturday marked the end of the
Muslim holy month of Ramadan, a
time of prayer and reflection where,
from sunrise to sunset. Muslims ab
stain from food and drink. In the
evening, 40 people attended the Eid
dinner hosted by the ISSU. They
served halal Chinese food, where
the meat was prepared in an Islamic
fashion.
"A few of us left campus at seven
in the morning and did not return

until at ten at night." Shaffique
Adam, a senior and ISSU officer,
said.
"It was nice to get together with
the ISSU family to celebrate Eid to
gether," Adam continued.
"As each person came in, we said
the Eid greeting to each other and
hugged according to tradition,"
Khandekar said.
"Before we left, we took pictures
and hugged again and reflected on
how our Eid had been. It was noth
ing monumental, but definitely
meaningful," she continued.
The ISSU put a lot of planning
into the Ramadan observation. The
ISSU Ramadan committee, led bv

doctoral candidate Hossam Fahmy,'
began planning for Ramadan in
September.
During the month, the ISSU hold
daily dinners called iftars, followed
by spiritual discussions and optional
prayers attended by 30 to 75 people
each night.
Khandekar said, "The month of
Ramadan and events like those for
Fid are possibly the most important
for the ISSU. in my opinion. It's so
hard to leave home and practice re
ligion on your own. Having a com
munity to encourage you, no matter
the community, is more important
than most people realize for the col
lege / university experience."
