# Soto's new dog makes triumphant appearance
## 
### Corinne Yates Contributing writer 
The lights went down Thursday
night in the Soto lounge as current
and former Soto residents united for

the unveiling of
the new Soto con
crete dog. Wilbur
Hall's Soto dorm
was named after
Leland Junior's
pet dog. which, as
legend goes, laid
down its life to
save the young

boy's.
Soto Head Advising Associate
Tony Doric, a junior, gave a dramat
ic retelling of the Soto legend as other
staff members acted out the story.
According to legend. Leland Ju
nior was given Soto as a puppy on his
fourth birthday. When the boy was
12. they went on a picnic far from
their home, near where Wilbur Hall
is now located. While Leland Junior
was climbing a tree, ravenous rac
coons attacked him. Soto jumped in
to protect Leland Junior, but in the
process received a gaping wound to
his stomach that would be fatal. He
supposedly died in the boy's arms
and was buried in a field near pre
sent- day Wilbur Hall.
"Greater love has no man than
this, that he lay down his life for a
friend." Soto Resident Fellow Bruce
O'l iara quoted Leland Junior's jour
nal that inspired the naming of the
Soto dorm in the fall of 1955.
"Ladies and gentlemen, may 1
present to you the new and improved
Soto," exclaimed Dorie as a concrete
dog was unveiled. Former and cur
rent residents burst out in applause
and cheering.
In the past, the four-class dorm re
membered the dog with a concrete
statue. Traditionally, the statue was
stolen by other residences and taken
to random places to get pictures.
"One fraternity stole Soto and

took it to Disneyland and got pic
tures of it riding on the Matterhorn,"
O'Hara said.
"Another time, it was painted or
ange and left in a fountain," he con
tinued.
The thieves usually left ransom
notes to tell the dorm how to get back
their beloved concrete dog. but two
years ago an unnamed party stole the
statue and never returned it.
"We think it was an insider job,"
said Soto Resident Assistant Ben
Mossawir, a senior who was a Soto
resident at the lime. The statue was
U-locked to a stairwell, but O'Hara
said that that did not stop the pranks.
"People came with liquid nitrogen
tanks!" he said with a laugh.
Searching continued all last year,
when the Soto dorm was, for the first
and only time, all freshmen. Soto res
idents from last year never knew the
legend of Soto. Some of them felt left
out.
"It's a dog? I thought Soto was a
beaver." joked sophomore Brian
Chan, a Soto resident from last year.
"We tried hard to get Soto back."
said sophomore Mike Starbird. both
a current and former Soto resident as
well as last year's Soto secretary of
defense. "I had some leads, but they
never panned out."
After more than a year of search
ing for the dog, the Soto staff decided
that it was time to bring back the leg
end.
The statue, weighing about 1 (K)
pounds, is less wolf-like than the orig
inal statue, but it is in a similar pose.
Sophomore Jonathan Kolstad, a
former Soto resident, said of the new
statue, "A cement canine is a cement
canine. I'm just glad he's back at
home."
"DNA testing has confirmed that
this dog is in fact an offspring of
Soto," O'Hara said.
As far as keeping the statue safe
from future pranksters, an extensive
defense system is under develop
ment.
