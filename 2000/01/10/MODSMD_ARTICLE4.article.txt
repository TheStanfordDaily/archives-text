# SSE puts lecture notes online
## 
### Eileen Chao Contributing writer 
I or less money and more convenience,
lecture notes from the Stanford Student
I -nterprises w ill be available online starting
Jan. 23.
I his is due to a new partnership be
tween SSL's Lecture Notes and
Versity.com. SSL. believes that this
arrangement will be more efficient for stu
dents who want lecture notes.
"Students can purchase the notes online
by using their credit card." said SSL Distri
bution Manager I'hillina Lai. "It's easier
and less trouble than having the student go
to the Student Store every week [to buy a
hard copy]."
\ ersity.com is an online provider of lec
tuix notes for colleges and universities all
over the country. It also includes links and
discussion groups. Despite the changes in
distribution, the quality and process of
Stanford's Lecture Notes will remain in
tact.
"The notetaker interface and distribu
tion of notes is on Versity .com. but we are
still in charge of getting the content of the

notes, overseeing the quality of the notes
and hiring notetakers." said Dan Kinna
mon. Manager of Lecture Notes. "Al
though applications for being a note-taker
are on Versity .com. we are the people who
look at the apps and hire the students."
I his partnership will provide many ben
efits. however. Before. Lecture Notes sold
actual copies of notes in the Student Store
even Sunday afternoon. Now. they will be
available at any time of day for students to
purchase.
"Students won't have to wait a whole
week because notes will be submitted 24
hours after the lecture |and can be immedi
ately posted 011 the Web]." Kinnamon said.
"Plus they don't even have to leave the
room anymore to gel them."
Students will have an access code that
allows them into the Web site to print out
notes. I his access code limits the number
ol \ iews they have of the notes. The limit is
enough for students to use it as many times
as necessary, but not enough for one stu
dent to print out multiple copies for unreg
istered friends.
1 ai cited another efficiency of the access
code. "|Willi an access code], students

don't have to keep up with the subscription
card, where they used to have to pay a fee if
they lost [the notes]." Lai said. "The access
code can easily be replaced for free."
1 lowever. with the access code, students
will only be allowed to sign onto the Web
site a limited number of times. They will
have 60 viewing times allowed to protect
the organization from people who sign on
and print out notes for their friends who
aren't registered.
Another benefit of providing the notes
online is the new. lowered prices. Before,
they were sold for about $25 per quarter.
Because they can be provided online, costs
for Xeroxing, paperwork and manual labor
have been cut down, now allowing students
to purchase notes for $15 for the quarter.
In addition to greater convenience and
lowered prices, the partnership between
Versity.com and Lecture Notes also al
lowed for the expansion of the range of
classes covered by Lecture Notes.
"Because the production costs are
lower, we have more time and resources to
diversify the selection." Lai said. "Usually
we only provide notes for the Social
Sciences and Natural Sciences. Now
we're going to get more from the En
gineering Department and upper di
vision classes."
The idea of online distribution of
notes has caused some worries, ac
cording to Lai.
The SSE must get professors' ap
proval to sell their classes' notes, and
Lai said some of them are more wary
simply because on the Web, anyone
is able to have access to the informa
tion.
"Some professors just have moral
concerns with lecture notes," Lai
said. "They think that students
should take their own notes for their
own benefit."
Nevertheless, Lai said most pro
fessors who thought that Lecture
Notes were a good idea in the first

place have no problem with them
being posted on the Web. She want
ed to emphasize that the main rea
son for putting the notes online was
for the student's benefit.
"We're not doing this for any
kind of profit; we're doing this to
help students gain easier access to
Lecture Notes," Lai said.
"Last quarter, Versity.com was
our competition. Now we are work
ing together, and hopefully it will
make everyone's lives easier," she
added.
This quarter is only a trial period
for Lecture Notes to work with Ver
sity.com, but Lai hopes it will work
out and become permanent. Kinna
mon also has high hopes for the part
nership.
"I'm really excited about [it],"
Kinnamon said. "It puts together
two organizations, allowing each to
capitalize on their strengths in order
to provide a higher quality product
for a lower price."
