I or less money and more convenience,
lecture notes from the Stanford Student
I -nterprises w ill be available online starting
Jan. 23.
I his is due to a new partnership be
tween SSL's Lecture Notes and
Versity.com. SSL. believes that this
arrangement will be more efficient for stu
dents who want lecture notes.
"Students can purchase the notes online
by using their credit card." said SSL Distri
bution Manager I'hillina Lai. "It's easier
and less trouble than having the student go
to the Student Store every week [to buy a
hard copy]."
\ ersity.com is an online provider of lec
tuix notes for colleges and universities all
over the country. It also includes links and
discussion groups. Despite the changes in
distribution, the quality and process of
Stanford's Lecture Notes will remain in
tact.
"The notetaker interface and distribu
tion of notes is on Versity .com. but we are
still in charge of getting the content of the

notes, overseeing the quality of the notes
and hiring notetakers." said Dan Kinna
mon. Manager of Lecture Notes. "Al
though applications for being a note-taker
are on Versity .com. we are the people who
look at the apps and hire the students."
I his partnership will provide many ben
efits. however. Before. Lecture Notes sold
actual copies of notes in the Student Store
even Sunday afternoon. Now. they will be
available at any time of day for students to
purchase.
"Students won't have to wait a whole
week because notes will be submitted 24
hours after the lecture |and can be immedi
ately posted 011 the Web]." Kinnamon said.
"Plus they don't even have to leave the
room anymore to gel them."
Students will have an access code that
allows them into the Web site to print out
notes. I his access code limits the number
ol \ iews they have of the notes. The limit is
enough for students to use it as many times
as necessary, but not enough for one stu
dent to print out multiple copies for unreg
istered friends.
1 ai cited another efficiency of the access
code. "|Willi an access code], students

don't have to keep up with the subscription
card, where they used to have to pay a fee if
they lost [the notes]." Lai said. "The access
code can easily be replaced for free."
1 lowever. with the access code, students
will only be allowed to sign onto the Web
site a limited number of times. They will
have 60 viewing times allowed to protect
the organization from people who sign on
and print out notes for their friends who
aren't registered.
Another benefit of providing the notes
online is the new. lowered prices. Before,
they were sold for about $25 per quarter.
Because they can be provided online, costs
for Xeroxing, paperwork and manual labor
have been cut down, now allowing students
to purchase notes for $15 for the quarter.
In addition to greater convenience and
lowered prices, the partnership between
Versity.com and Lecture Notes also al
lowed for the expansion of the range of
classes covered by Lecture Notes.
"Because the production costs are
lower, we have more time and resources to
diversify the selection." Lai said. "Usually
