# Econ dept. faces changes
## Econ 50M now prerequisite for 50 
### Greg Page Contributing writer 
A recent change in the Economics Department has cre
ated quite a stir, especially among Economics and Interna
tional Relations majors.
In the past, the math requirement for Econ 50 stipulat
ed that students needed either Math 51 or Econ 50M. a
two-unit, pass / fail course. Typically, students would regis
ter lor Econ 50 and Econ 50M concurrently. Four weeks
into the quarter. Econ 50M students would take a math
lest. Those who passed remained in Econ 50. while those
who failed the test were forced to drop Econ 50.
Now. the policy has been changed: students can no
longer simultaneously enroll in Econ 50 and EeonsoM. In
stead. they must have completed either Math 51 or Econ
50M in a previous quarter.
The source of controversy for most students is not the
change in policy, but its handling. Students did no find out
about the change on the first day of class.
" This seriously messes up my whole schedule. Now I
have to rearrange my academic plans at a moment's no
lice." said sophomore Josh Magee.
Sophomore Lydia Poon said. "What bothers me most
about this whole situation is the lack of previous notice. It
was such a shock to walk into Econ 50M and be handed a
syllabus that said I couldn't take Econ 50 as I had planned."
Economics Prof. Peter Hammond said. "The decision
[ to change the policy) came from the Vice Provost. In some
previous quarters, there were a number of students who
registered for 50 and 50M concurrently, but did not pass
the 50M exam. Therefore, they were unable to continue
and they lost seven units of credit, which in some cases led
to academic probation.
"It is much better if students really do get the needed
math background before Econ 50. This is a better way for
people to learn, ahead of time, if Economics is the right
academic discipline for them."
Hammond did not rule out the possibilities that some
students might still be able to simultaneously enroll in both
Econ 50 and 50M or that the change might be postponed
until next quarter. "I suspect that this might be allowed for
special reasons, such as pending graduation. Also, there is
discussion going on right now as to whether students will
be able to enroll in both courses for this quarter." lie
added. "There is a pre-F.con 50M diagnostic test. If stu
dents pass this test ;it the beginning of the quarter, they can
bypass Econ 50M altogether."
