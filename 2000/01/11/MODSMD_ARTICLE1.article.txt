# Stanford in love with Stoppard
## 
### Megan Knize Contributing writer 
At 4:30 p.m. yesterday, three
eager Tom Stoppard fans lined up
outside of Kresge Auditorium. By
6:30 p.m., the auditorium was packed
and people began sitting in the aisles.
And at 7 p.m. Tom Stoppard began
to entertain more than 700 students,
faculty and guests with what he called
a "scintillating question-and-answer
period."
Stoppard. the author of this year's
freshman book, "Arcadia." came to
Stanford as part of the Introduction
to the Humanities Freshman Book
Program. Stoppard's two-hour visit
attracted an audience of students
from other colleges and from local
high schools.
Cathleen Candia, 17. is a senior at
St. Francis High School in Mountain
View. She was among the first to wait
for Stoppard.
"We travel around to see him."
she said. "We're big fans."
About 12 people were able to ask
questions, and one of the most enter
taining parts of the evening was Stop
pard's dialogue with the audience,
she said.
"He makes fun of his questioners
for their pretentiousness, but that's
cool because I can go home and say. I
was insulted by Tom Stoppard!" said
freshman Eric Hultgren, who asked a
question about Stoppard's inspira
tion for the play, "Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are Dead."
Freshman Eric Lai also received a
humorous response to a question he
asked about his high school English
teacher's use of the word "Stop
pardesque" to describe his writing

style.
"I can't think of anything nicer
than to he an adjective," Stoppard
said. "Better than a preposition."
But Stoppard addressed more se
rious matters too. including passion
and his inspiration for the plays.
"When you expose yourself to
meaning in a poem or work, it ought
to create a response in you." he said.
Most of the evening's questions
were focused on "Arcadia." which is
a story about a room that stays the
same over a long time lapse.
Stoppard said he doesn't organize
his plays, hut rather tries to write
from whim.
"I thought the big thing to do was
to get liberated from pre-meditation.
I thought I couldn't write until 1 had
everything worked out, but you can't
know everything," he said. "Now
that I'm working on a new play, I'm
conscious that with Arcadia, I did
better by not planning anything."
Stoppard worked as a journalist
for six years and then freelanced for a
short time.
"I wanted to make my mark be
yond journalism." he said. "And 1
didn't want to get up in the morning."
He began writing for the theater in
the 19605.
"Theater is an event, not a text,"
he said.
Many Stoppard fans agree.
Christina Falcone, a sophomore at
Swarthmore College in Pennsylva
nia. saw a Stoppard interview in De
cember. She liked last night's perfor
mance better than the interview she
saw before.
"This was wonderful." she said.
"In person he lives up to the depth
and complexity of his plays."
