### 
Economics Department
should delay implementa
tion of new policy

One of Ihe qualities that makes
Stanford unique is the oppor
tunity it gives its undergradu
ates to shop elasses for the first two
weeks of the quarter.
Though students might appreciate
the fact that they need not register for
classes a quarter prior to taking them,
the shopping period does not allow
for them to return to school without
any forethought as to what classes
they intend to enroll in.
Hie reason for this is that at Stan
ford a substantial amount of work is
assigned even during the first few
days of the quarter. If a student does
not want to fall behind in his or her
course work, he or she needs to know
what classes lie or she is taking and
attend them from the beginning.
The Economics Department
should thus have considered the
implications of its decision to
announce on the first day of class that
Econ 50M is now a prerequisite for
Econ SO. Since Econ 50M could be
taken concurrently with Econ 50
prior to this decision, most students
didn't anticipate the change. They are
now left in a bind.
It would only be fair to these stu
dents if the Economics Department
decided to hold its implementation of
the new policy at least until next
quarter. This would allow the stu
dents who planned to enroll in both
Econ 50M and Econ 50 this quarter
not to have to rearrange their sched
ules.
If the Department wanted to
implement the change for this aca
demic quarter, they should have
clearly announced their decision
prior to winter break to all interested

students through the use of fliers,
dorm and house e-mail lists and aca
demic advisers.
Though the method the Eco
nomics Department used to
announce their new policy cannot be
praised, the decision itself can be
extolled.
In the past, the math requirement
for Econ 50 stipulated that students
lake and pass either Math 51 or Econ
50M. Students typically enrolled in
Econ 50 and Econ 50M during the
same quarter, and four weeks into
this quarter they would take a test for
Econ 50M. Passing meant remaining
in Econ 50, while failing meant drop
ping both Econ 50 and Econ 50M.
Having to withdraw from these
classes meant a loss of seven units,
which often resulted in academic pro
bation for many students.
Now students are asked to pass
Math 51 or Econ 50M prior to
enrolling in Econ 50. This will allow
students to determine whether they
are capable of doing the math
required for Econ 50 and if they
enjoy the material or not.
A final thing to remember here is
that prerequisites at Stanford are not
absolutely enforced. The Economics
Department has stated that although
it would be against the recommenda
tion of professors and administrators,
students can enroll in Econ 50 without
having taken Math 51 or Econ 50M.
However, the curriculum for Econ
50 will probably now assume com
plete understanding of Econ 50M
material at the beginning of the quar
ter where it might have previously
delayed such assumptions for stu
dents taking the classes concurrently.
If a student walks into Econ 50 with
out the proper preparation, his or her
grade will likely suffer. It is ultimate
ly up to students to choose whether
they are ready to handle the class.
