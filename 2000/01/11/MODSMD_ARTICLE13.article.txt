# Outside the box
## Coffee House, where have you gone?

The newly renovated
Stanford Coffee
House is finally
open. Initially, when I
thought about writing this
eolumn. I had a definite
tone and message to get
across: it sucks.

The tables are purple
formica, the lighting is ultra-bright fluores
cent. the decorative highlights are a flower
arrangement and a mural (whose additive
values are at the least seriously questioned),
the coffee is Starbucks, the coffee drip trays
look like they are out of a Nature Conser
vancy catalog (which is nice and all. but in
the Co Ho?), the ceiling resembles one in
an industrial office building, the walls are
puke yellow, the rug is purple, the employ
ees have to wear uniforms that match the
apparent color scheme of the place (purple
T-shirts with yellow print), there is a bar
which directly faces a wall, the price of a
small coffee went up from $1.(X) to $1.24,
and it took six months to complete.
Since my first visit on Thursday, I was
disappointed to say the least in the new ren
ovations at the Co Ho. Like most people. 1
thought that the atmosphere of the old.
dark dank place had disappeared and was
replaced with the likeness of a cafeteria. 1
liked the crowded walkways, the battered
walls, the multi-levels and everything else
that made the Co Ho the Co Ho (OK,
maybe not the miserably slow service). Its
atmosphere made it feel like a true student
establishment.

But I thought that maybe I didn't give
the new Co Ho a fair evaluation. I mean, it
is now handicapped accessible, which is cer
tainly good, and there might be other good
things as well. So on Sunday night. I decid
ed to go there with a new neutral attitude
and sec what it was really like.
And it wasn't so bad. The place was
filled when I got there at 7 p.m. and stayed
fairly filled the whole evening. At a point
somewhere around 9 p.m.. the place was
packed, with people loitering around and
talking with friends — it had a pulse of the
old Co Ho. And the Stanford Concert Net
work brought in a rock I punk band from
San Diego that blasted the hell out of the
place, reminding everyone that this was no
Starbucks. Sure I had some difficulty talk
ing with my friend about our stupid prob
lem set when a speaker was placed three
feet from my ear. but hey. what are college
hangouts for?
The place still did feel a bit cold, howev
er. even with a full house of students. With
this in mind, here are my suggestions to get
some spirit back into the Co Ho.
1. Cover the walls. The place looks
empty. Get some bad student art in the
place to liven it up.
2. Replace the fluorescents. Fluorescent
lights kill any sort of atmosphere. The ener
gy wasted by normal lights is well worth the
improved atmosphere.
3. The managers should remind them
selves that the Co Ho is in a student union
and not in the yuppified Palo Alto. Behave
accordingly (i.e. out with the flower

arrangements).
4. Rip out the purple formica. OK, that
may he a little rash; I take that back.
5. Put up the "Staßu" sign currently in
Kairos from Gaieties 1997 (for everybody
who missed that attempt at a show, it was
about how Stanford sold out to corpora
tions and the Co Ho became a Starbucks.
Ironic, don't ya think?). If the Co Ho is
going to serve Starbucks coffee, we might as
well have a sense of humor about it.
6. Add some tables! With all the extra
space, some more seating is in order.
7. Please, don't make the employees
wear shirts that match the walls.
S. Hawaiian shirt day every other
Wednesday.
9. Have tag night. Everyone comes with
their favorite color of spray paint and goes
crazy.
What going to the Co Ho on Sunday
night reminded me most of is that the Co
Ho is what we, the students, make of it. It is
simply a forum for us to meet and share our
friendships, ideas and the occasional prob
lem set. As long as it keeps serving coffee
and beer (and the rest of Palo Alto closes at
10 p.m.), it will be adequate enough, even if
it does faintly resemble a cafeteria.

Mike Rosenbluih wants to know what you
think of the new Co Ho. Write your com
ments to letters@daily.stanford.edu. He also
invites everyone to check out The Tree
house's new map of America. Apparently,
it is a Stanford tradition.
