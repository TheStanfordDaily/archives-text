## Tennis squads striving for championship form Men's team looks to continue dominance 
### Sameer Ahmed Contributing writer 
Winning 16 national champi
onships in the past 27 years and five in
a row from 1995-98, the men's tennis
team has been, without a doubt, the
most successful Stanford athletic pro
gram in recent history.
However, last year's first-round
loss to Baylor in the final 16 of the
NCAA Championship seemed to be
devastating for the team, which fin
ished the season ranked eighth in the
country. Although last year's defeat
was the earliest exit from the final 16
for the Cardinal since 1977. with five
starters returning and four outstand
ing freshmen, this year's team, cur
rently ranked No. 3 in the country be
hind UCLA and LSU, is definitely
ready to compete for another nation
al championship in May.
The team has already demonstrat
ed its dominating form in two presea
son tournaments and one match this
fall. The team competed at the ITA
Men's Tennis All-American Cham
pionship, the first of four collegiate
grand slams, in Austin, Texas, from
Oct. 12 to 18. Sophomore K.J. Hip
pensteel took the singles title while
teammates Geoff Abrams, a senior,
and Alex Kim, a junior, won the dou
bles title. Freshman David Martin
won the consolation singles title.
The team continued its excellent
performance at the ITA Men's Ten
nis Regional Championship in Seat
tle, Washington from Nov. 6 to 9.
Kim won the singles title by defeating
teammate and doubles partner
Abrams. while Uippensteel and Mar
tin captured the doubles title.
During Thanksgiving break, the
team enjoyed a relaxing vacation in
Honolulu while concluding its pre
season by destroying Hawaii 7-0.
"I was really pleased with our ac
complishments in the two tourna
ments this fall," Head coach Dick
Ciould said. "The guys played phe
nomenally and the rankings are a re
sult of that."
Because of all of their achieve
ments so far, the players have re
ceived many individual honors. Uip
pensteel was not only named the ITA
national player of the month of Octo
ber in singles, but is also ranked first
in the ITA preseason singles rank
ings. Kim, who was named the ITA
national player of the month of No
vember, is ranked fourth in the coun
try while Abrams is ranked sixth. In
doubles, Kim and Abrams were cho
sen as the ITA national players of the
month of October and are ranked
first in the ITA preseason doubles
rankings. In addition. Uippensteel
and Martin are ranked fifth.
However, these rankings do not
necessarily reflect how the players
compare to the entire field.

"The rankings can bcA-Jittle mis
leading," Gould said. "Elffht to 10 of
the top players in the country were
not in school during the fall quarter
and were not ranked because of that.
Yet, I still believe that we have three
guys who are capable of being ranked
in the top of the country."
The next major test for many of
the players is the ITA Individual In
doors Championship, the second col
legiate grand slam, from Feb. 3 to 6 in
Dallas, Texas. Here, the Stanford
players who qualified for the tourna
ment — Uippensteel. Kim, Abrams
and Martin — will compete against
the top players from many schools
across the country.
Although the collegiate grand
slams are extremely important to the
individual rankings of the players, the
team competition doesn't begin until
Jan. 26. w hen Stanford hosts Hawaii.
"Starting in February, our season
really picks up." Gould said. "After
playing two good nonconference op
ponents in San Diego State and
Georgia Tech. the difficult Pacific 10
Conference season begins with
matches against Washington and

One of the team's most important
advantages is its depth and experi
ence. The only player the team lost
from last year was captain and No. 1
player Ryan Wolters. To make up for
the loss of Wolters, who finished last
season ranked fourth in the country,
the team has added four extremely
talented freshmen. The freshmen,
Martin, Carter Morris, Scott Lipsky
and Ryan Haviland, were all ranked
in the top seven in the country during
the past three years.
"We don't have a ladder set yet."
Gould said. "But with five returning
starters and four outstanding fresh

top six positions. The next three

One of the team's most important
advantages is its depth and experi
ence. The only player the team lost
from last year was captain and No. 1
player Ryan Wolters. To make up for
the loss of Wolters, who finished last
season ranked fourth in the country,
the team has added four extremely
talented freshmen. The freshmen,
Martin, Carter Morris, Scott Lipsky
and Ryan Haviland, were all ranked
in the top seven in the country during
the past three years.
"We don't have a ladder set yet."
Gould said. "But with five returning
starters and four outstanding fresh
men. it will be a real dogfight for the
top six positions. The next three
weeks are really crucial in deciding
those spots."

Classic in Thousand Oaks. Calif.

The members of the No. 3 Stanford men's tennis squad have already
racked up numerous honors in the preseason. Sophomore K.J. Hip
pensteel, seen here at practice yesterday, is ranked first in the ITA
preseason singles rankings.
Winning 16 national champi
onships in the past 27 years and five in
a row from 1995-98, the men's tennis
team has been, without a doubt, the
most successful Stanford athletic pro
gram in recent history.
However, last year's first-round
loss to Baylor in the final 16 of the
NCAA Championship seemed to be
devastating for the team, which fin
ished the season ranked eighth in the
country. Although last year's defeat
was the earliest exit from the final 16
for the Cardinal since 1977. with five
starters returning and four outstand
ing freshmen, this year's team, cur
rently ranked No. 3 in the country be
hind UCLA and LSU, is definitely
ready to compete for another nation
al championship in May.
The team has already demonstrat
ed its dominating form in two presea
son tournaments and one match this
fall. The team competed at the ITA
Men's Tennis All-American Cham
pionship, the first of four collegiate
grand slams, in Austin, Texas, from
Oct. 12 to 18. Sophomore K.J. Hip
pensteel took the singles title while
teammates Geoff Abrams, a senior,
and Alex Kim, a junior, won the dou
bles title. Freshman David Martin
won the consolation singles title.
The team continued its excellent
performance at the ITA Men's Ten
nis Regional Championship in Seat
tle, Washington from Nov. 6 to 9.
Kim won the singles title by defeating
teammate and doubles partner
Abrams. while Uippensteel and Mar
tin captured the doubles title.
During Thanksgiving break, the
team enjoyed a relaxing vacation in
Honolulu while concluding its pre
season by destroying Hawaii 7-0.
"I was really pleased with our ac
complishments in the two tourna
ments this fall," Head coach Dick
Ciould said. "The guys played phe
nomenally and the rankings are a re
sult of that."
Because of all of their achieve
ments so far, the players have re
ceived many individual honors. Uip
pensteel was not only named the ITA
national player of the month of Octo
ber in singles, but is also ranked first
in the ITA preseason singles rank
ings. Kim, who was named the ITA
national player of the month of No
vember, is ranked fourth in the coun
try while Abrams is ranked sixth. In
doubles, Kim and Abrams were cho
sen as the ITA national players of the
month of October and are ranked
first in the ITA preseason doubles
rankings. In addition. Uippensteel
and Martin are ranked fifth.
However, these rankings do not
necessarily reflect how the players
compare to the entire field.

"The rankings can bcA-Jittle mis
leading," Gould said. "Elffht to 10 of
the top players in the country were
not in school during the fall quarter
and were not ranked because of that.
Yet, I still believe that we have three
guys who are capable of being ranked
in the top of the country."
The next major test for many of
the players is the ITA Individual In
doors Championship, the second col
legiate grand slam, from Feb. 3 to 6 in
Dallas, Texas. Here, the Stanford
players who qualified for the tourna
ment — Uippensteel. Kim, Abrams
and Martin — will compete against
the top players from many schools
across the country.
Although the collegiate grand
slams are extremely important to the
individual rankings of the players, the
team competition doesn't begin until
Jan. 26. w hen Stanford hosts Hawaii.
"Starting in February, our season
really picks up." Gould said. "After

ponents in San Diego State and
