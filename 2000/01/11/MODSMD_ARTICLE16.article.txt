# Younger players pace talented women's group
## 
### Bill Hanson Staff writer 
After a rocky start to the season,
senior Teryn Ashley proved over
the weekend that she is better than
her 74th spot in the national rank
ings.
Ashley demonstrated that she
has fully recovered from a nagging
wrist injury by turning in a runner
up performance at the Pacific 10
Conference Women's Tennis In
door Championships in Seattle,
Wash.
Ashley, ranked sixth in the na
tion at the end of last season, has
been one of Stanford's most consis
tent competitors over the last three
years.
Unfortunately, persistent ten
dinitis in her wrist, coupled with
some mediocre results in the past
few months, left Ashley with the dis
mal 74th ranking at the end of 1999.
This weekend, however, while
pounding her trademark flat ground
strokes and formidable first serve,
Ashley emphatically showed that
she is not content with her current
ranking.
After sweeping through the
draw, Ashley succumbed to third
seeded Kristina Kraszewski, 6-1. 6-
4. in the title match.
"I think she's back now," said
head coach Frank Brennan. "When
you're back from an injury, you
want to make sure you can still
play."
Ashley showed that she is still a
top contender, although her game
was a little rusty during the tourna
ment.
"Wii.huva; to gel her match
toughness and her game going
again," Brennan said. "She's about
where she should be now."

Before falling to the hard-hitting
Kraszewski in the final, Ashley
posted straight-set wins over several
top collegiate players, including
Arizona State's Allison Bradshaw,
Arizona's Lindsay Blau and Cali
fornia's Claire Curran.
"My wrist was a little sore, but
adrenaline took over," Ashley said.
"I competed really well. There are a
few things I need to work on. but I
felt great hitting the ball. I know I'm
better than the 74th player in the
country."
Sophomore Lauren Kalvaria,
who fell to teammate Laura
Granville in the finals of Intercolle
giate Tennis Association's Regional
Championships in November, also
made a dent in the draw, dropping a
tight three-setter to Kraszewski in
the third round.
Kalvaria, currently ranked 13th
in the nation — her highest ranking
ever — is hoping to capitalize on the
momentum she had at the end of
last year.
"Lauren is very serious right
now." Brennan said. "I feel very
confident about her performance
for the rest of the season."
Brennan is less confident, how
ever, about the doubles duo of
Kalvaria and sophomore Gabriela
Lastra.
Although Kalvaria and Lastra
have been teammates since their ju
nior days. Brennan feels that the
tandem is currently not reaching its
potential.
Over the weekend, the duo was
defeated by Arizona State's Allison
Bradshaw and Celena McCoury. 8-
2, in the doubles final.
"Gabby and Lauren probably
should have won that match." Bren
nan said. "Their team chemistry has
not been great lately and that was

their strong point. Something has
gone out of that, and they need to
get their chemistry back."
Lastra fell in the first round of
the singles competition to Washing
ton's Zuzana Stunova, a player
ranked several spots below her. The
result, however, may be misleading.
"The tournament was played on
Washington's home courts." Bren
nan said. "Stunova was very much
at home on that indoor court specif
ically. So was Kraszewski. They get
confident and just start hammering
the ball. Indoors. Washington did a
job on us. but 1 think we'll beat them
on our home courts."
Next weekend, three other mem
bers of the Cardinal squad —
Granville, senior Jennifer Heiser
and sophomore Keiko Tokuda —
head down to Thousand Oaks"
Calif., to take part in the National
Collegiate Tennis Championships..
"I think Granville should be very
competitive down there, and Toku
da and Heiser can also do very
well." Brennan said. "We didn't
actly shine up in Seattle this week*
end, hut I'm very confident about
the season. v
And Brennan should he confi
dent — after all. his squad captured
the NCAA team championship lasf
season, and every starter has re£
turned.
Moreover, sophomore Marissa
Irvin. who reached the finals of th£
NCAA individual competition last
season and finished the season
ranked second in the nation, has not
yet competed this season.
"Irvin's in Australia right noW
for the Australian Open." Brenn;|«
said. "Next month, she'll be ready
come back and establish herself
the best collegiate player in the nn*
tion." >
