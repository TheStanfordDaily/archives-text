## Literary and cultural critic to speak tonight in Law School 
### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
Literary and cultural critic Mar
jorie Garber will deliver the first
Presidential Lecture of winter quar
ter at 7 p.m. at the Law School, room
290.
Comparative Literature doctoral
student Matthew Tiews, who is help
ing coordinate the series, said Garber
is known both for her Shakespeare
scholarship, as well as her cultural
criticisms.
Garber has held a place "interest
ingly in a kind of intellectual public
sphere," Tiews said.
"I think she's definitely consid
ered someone who doesn't play the
traditional academic game," he said.
In addition to her reputation for
putting forth productive and interest
ing ideas, Tiews said, Garber is often
hailed as a gifted writer and speaker.
She is known for a "certain kind of
stylistic elegance," Tiews said.
Garber also serves as the Director
of the Center for Literary and Cul

tural Studies at Harvard.
A professor of English at Harvard
University, Garber has written sever
al books of literary and cultural criti
cism, including "Vested Interests"
and "Vice Versa."
Both books explore cultural con
structions of gender identity.
In "Vested Interests," Tiews said,
Garber "takes niarginality and ambi
guity as foundational... for the pro
duction of culture, ... the kind of
move that makes her the slightly rad
ical figure she is perceived to be."
According to a biographical
sketch of Garber written by Glen
Worthey for the Presidential Lec
tures Web site (http://prelectur.stan
ford.edu), Garber is known for her
ability to integrate serious literary
scholarship with an affinity for word
play.
In an excerpt from her latest b<x>k,
"Symptoms of Culture," Garber
writes, "One of the most striking
symptoms of culture in our time has
been the phenomenon of the so
called 'culture wars,' a conflict that

might be located precisely in the clash
between the timeless, ahistorical, uni
versalizing, decontextualizing func
tion of the 'symbol' and the histori
cally contingent, specific and overde
termined function of the 'symptom.'"
Since its inception in the fall of
1997, the Presidential Lecture series
has brought speakers from a range of
humanistic disciplines to investigate
new directions in humanities scholar
ship.
The series has brought to campus
a varied roster, including literary crit
ics Frederic Jameson and Harold
Bloom, among other distinguished
speakers.
Through the series, Tiews said, the
University community is hopefully
gaining a "sense of how the humani
ties work. [We're] discussing particu
lar questions and bringing people to
gether [to do so]."
In this final stretch of the series in
its present form, Tiews said, the main
interest is in finding out "what kinds
of possibilities are open to the hu
manities."
