# Students walk in to housing
## 
### Marianna Stacey Lopez 
Even with the added stress of
housing an extremely large fresh
man class, the Office of Residential
Education has once again success
fully fulfilled its guaranteed housing
promise for students seeking to ob
tain housing for winter quarter. The
walk-on process began on Jan. 3.
"Winter quarter is usually fairly
difficult in terms of assigning hous
ing, but we have successfully man
aged to uphold our commitment to
guaranteed housing," said John Ju
dicki, Undergraduate Housing As
signment supervisor.
According to Judicki, "As of Jan.
3, 31 men and 39 women were as
signed housing. Fifteen men were
not assigned housing and of those
15, one man passed up his option to
live on campus. On the other hand,
13 women were unassigned and 10
of those 13 opted to live off campus.
"Finding housing after Jan. 4 was

and continues to be relatively easy
less stressful. In fact, we currently
have spaces available for walk-ons,"
said Judicki.
Furthermore, when asked
whether or not study rooms had
been converted into sleep rooms, J u
dicki responded, "Absolutely not,
each walk-on student that was guar
anteed housing was given ample
housing options. Whether the stu
dents chose to accept their housing
assignment was a matter of prefer
ence."
When asked to comment on this
year's walk-on process as compared
to last year's process, Judicki said,
"We tended to offer the same num
ber of spaces to students as we did
last year, and we have been success
ful in housing students promised
guaranteed housing."
In contrast, "the graduate stu
dent walk-on process was a lot less
stressful when compared to last
year," said Melissa Piker, Graduate

Housing supervisor.
"A total of 34 students, 12 women
and 22 men, all single, were housed
on campus this quarter," said Piker.
As of yesterday afternoon, three
spaces are available for graduate
students hoping to attain on campus
housing.
Piker offered an explanation for
this year's availability of graduate
housing. "The subsidized off cam
pus apartments, new as of last year,
have helped to reduce the stress of
finding housing."
While the winter walk-on process
was relatively smooth, it was never
theless a stressful experience for stu
dents making their way back to the
Farm.
Junior Carinne Johnson, who
walked into Haus Mitteleuropa said,
"Even though I got a really good
housing assignment, it's still very
stressful to have to come back to
campus not knowing where you're
going to live."
