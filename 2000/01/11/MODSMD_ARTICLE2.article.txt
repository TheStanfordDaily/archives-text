# Students vote to eat grapes
## Most dorms, houses won't boycott 
### Alice Brown Editorial staff 
After a three-year boycott, most
campus kitchens have regained the
option of serving grapes.
The results of a November vote,
released this week, show that for the
first time since Stanford began vot
ing on whether or not to support the
United Farm Workers' table grapes
boycott in dining halls, more stu
dents voted to oppose the boycott
than support it.
According to a press release from
Associate Dean of Students Tommy
Woon, 908 students voted against
the boycott while 668 students were
in favor of the boycott.
Students voted from Nov. 15 to
Nov. 19.
Last year, the votes for and
against the boycott were equally di
vided, a decrease from previous
years.
The information from Woon
shows that Florence Moore, Laguni
ta and Stern Hall supported the boy
cott. while Manzanita, Ricker and
Wilbur opposed it.
In total, 27 kitchens and dining
facilities opposed the boycott, 15
kitchens and facilities supported it
and five houses had different results.
The press release estimates that
2,000 students voted on the issue,
but because 10 houses did not report

participation rates only 1,576 votes
were actually recorded. One thou
sand twenty students voted on the
Web, and an additional 556 voted
through other ways.
If the boycott had been unani
mously supported, it would have
prohibited the University from pur
chasing any non-United Farm
Workers table grapes. United Farm
Workers called for a boycott on
table grapes in 1984 to protest pesti
cides used in the growing process.
Those dining halls that defeated
the boycott now have the option of
serving grapes. Dining halls that
supported the boycott will not pur
chase grapes.
The grape vote dates back to a
three-day hunger strike staged by
four students in 1994. The Universi
ty's refusal to ban grapes was a main
reason for the hunger strike.
Stanford is not the only Universi
ty to confront the dilemma of the
grape boycott. Grape Workers and
Farmers Coalition spokesperson
Gary Calorosu said in a November
interview that Harvard and Yale
Universities have dropped the boy
cott and have resumed serving table
grapes.
Woon was not available for com
ment.
An analysis containing student re
actions and additional numbers will
appear in tomorrow s paper.
