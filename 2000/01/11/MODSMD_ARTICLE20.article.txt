After a 12-hour drive, members
of the Stanford Solar Car Project
have returned from the 2000 Inter
national Consumer Electronics
Trade Show in Las Vegas, where
they showed off their most recent
racer, the Third Degree Burner, to
more than 90,000 attendees.
Nestled among 1,500 other ex
hibitors on 1.1 million square feet of
floor space, Stanford Solar was the
only student group to attend what
has become the largest annual con
sumer technology trade show in the
world.
Over the course of the four-day
show that ended Sunday, Stanford

Solar members discussed the
process of designing, building and
racing solar vehicles with some of
the biggest names in the consumer
electronics industry.
"CES provided us first-hand con
tact with all the movers and shakers
of the new economy," said team
member Trevor Lofthouse, a senior.
Among the notable figures who
attended the show were Microsoft
CEO Bill Gates and Sun Microsys
tems CEO Scott McNealy.
"1 was thrilled to find representa
tives of some of the biggest high-tech
companies in the world showing
genuine interest in our project," said
team member Joel Segre, a sopho
more.
"We would be talking to Mi

crosoft representatives about some
of our custom software one mo
ment, and then to GM about our
chassis construction the next," he
said.
According to Segre, these types
of exchanges are crucial to the
team's success. More than 80 per
cent of the car's development costs
are met only through the continued
support of Stanford Solar's corpo
rate sponsors, a number of whom at
tended the show.
The Stanford Solar Car Project is
currently designing its fifth-genera
tion solar-powered racer, which will
participate in the North American
Sunrayce 2001 as well as the 2001
World Solar Challenge across Aus
tralia.
