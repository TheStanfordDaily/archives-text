# Committee reviews TA training
## 
### Megan knize Contributing writer 
Last quarter, senior Brian Milch
was a teaching assistant for Comput
er Science 221: Artificial Intelligence,
but his only preparation for the class
was a two-hour training session for
Computer Science TAs.
Milch's instruction was part of the
guidelines established one year ago
by the Stanford oversight committee,
which supervises TA training. Now.
they will examine the guidelines and
review each department's prepara
tion of TAs.
"TAs are an extremely important
part of the undergrad experience."
said Michele Marineovich. the direc
tor for the Center for Teaching and
Learning. "The institution is taking
steps to make sure they are pre
pared."

While each department develops
specific training classes for TAs. the
committee guidelines are designed to
improve teaching quality. " This com
mittee is uncommon; most research
institutions have some kind of train
ing but we're ahead of most other
places in terms of requiring training,"
Marincovich said.
The guidelines encourage depart
ments to appoint a professor to mon
itor the progress of TAs, identify ap
propriate skills necessary for effec
tive teaching and oversee training.
Marincovich said the larger depart
ments. such as Chemistry. Physics
and Economics, will be evaluated
first.
"The point of the committee is to
be advisory to school deans," said
Tom Wasow, associate director of
graduate policy. "We want to find
ways to help departments do a better

job. rather than he policemen."
Wasow also believes Stanford's
commitment to TAs is unusual.
"We pay more attention to TA
training than most campuses," he
said. The training has two parts: a
class in university policies, such as
sexual harassment and the Honor
Code, and instruction in effective
methods of teaching.
"What we want to do is provide
the means for TAs to get help,"
Marincovich said. "After a TA teach
es their first class, we want a way for
them to be evaluated."
However, Milch knows from ex
perience that TA training isn't always
a class. "Most of how I learned to be
a TA was being in a class taught by
TAs," Milch said.
Just as each department develops
the training for its TAs, it also decides
who will be TAs. Although being a
TA is usually reserved for graduate
students, many computer science and
biology classes ask undergraduates to
teach.
Milch was given the opportunity
to work as a TA after he spent a sum
mer doing research with his advisor,
who asked him to be a TA for C'S 221.
"1 thought. 'Gosh, it's a lot of
work,' but I'm glad I did it,"he said.
"It was a great thing to be able to do
as a senior."
Marincovich said a passionate un
dergraduate is more effective than
some graduate students are.
Milch agrees. "I think that often
an undergrad who is TAing is more
enthused than a grad student who is
tired of doing it,"he said. "Many
sophomores TA, and they know the
material cold."
The oversight committee was cre
ated as a point of stability to review
TAs. The committee was proposed in
November IW7 by the Faculty Sen
ate in response to an ASSIJ request
to "review and evaluate the status, ef
fectiveness and training of teaching
assistants."
