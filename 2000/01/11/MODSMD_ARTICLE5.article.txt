# Editor ditching Stanford for Standard
## 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Staff writer 
Forgive Boh Cohn il lie's feel
ing some deja vu.
After four years of late nights
and tight deadlines. Cohn is leav
ing Stanford. Again. Fifteen years
since he graduated with bachelor's
degrees in communication and
American Studies, Cohn will wrap
up his second Stanford stint at the
end of the month.
Cohn — the man many credit
with guiding Stanford, the Univer
sity's alumni maga/ine, from a
time of trouble to national promi
nence — will step down as the
magazine's editor and publisher
on Jan. 28. Mark Robinson, cur
rent managing editor of the maga
zine. will serve as interim acting di
rector.
A 1985 Stanford graduate,
Cohn returned to the Farm in 19%
with his wife and nine-week old
daughter to preside over the merg
er between the formerly indepen
dent alumni publication Stanford
magazine and the University
sponsored Stanford Observer.
He replaced Bruce Anderson,
the magazine's previous editor,
who resigned due to conflicts with
the Alumni Association. Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper had
previously lodged a formal com
plaint about an article the maga
zine ran on gays at Stanford.
"I came in during a tense peri
od," Cohn said.
Cohn has seen his share of con
troversy as editor, though, covering
sensitive issues such as affirmative
action, faculty diversity, sexual ha
rassment and the campus housing
crunch.
"We don't shrink from writing
about things that are important to
our readers," he said, "even if
they're controversial. Basically,
we're trying to connect readers
back to Stanford, by being informa
tive, entertaining, even nostalgic.

"It's really important that we
look at any issues affecting higher
education, especially at Stanford,
and give our readers some insight
into how those issues are playing
out here."
Despite the potential for con
flict, Cohn said he has maintained
friendly relations with the adminis
tration. And officials at the Alumni
Association, which merged with
the University last year, praise his
work.
"He's a wonderful, vibrant col
league," said Marie Earl, director
of services and systems for the
Alumni Association. "He's really
smart, engaging and principled."
The magazine plays a unique
role in connecting alumni with the
University, Earl said.

"The magazine is our flagship
service to alumni," she said, "the
single thing that we offer that they
value the most."
One of Cohn's largest tasks was
folding a campus news section,
which formerly existed only as an
insert, into Stanford's main pages.
"Bob has consolidated the two in a
really seamless way, giving the
magazine a new look and a new
life," Earl said.
In addition to redesigning the
magazine, Cohn has supervised its
rise to national prominence.
Folio Magazine recognized
Stanford as Best University Maga
zine in 1999, and Cohn's staff has
also won awards for higher educa
tion reporting and staff writing
from the Council for the Advance

mcnt and Support of Education.
Although the editorial demands
of his job allowed Cohn to author
only two long pieces for the maga
zine. an article on affirmative ac
tion at Stanford and a co-authored
storv on President Casper's tenure,
both were well-received.
The affirmative action piece
won Best Article of the Year in
1997 from C ASE.
That award doesn't hang on his
office walls — he's not even sure
where it is — though he does dis
play several honors for Supreme
Court coverage at Newsweek.
The remaining space depicts a
veritable chronology of his career.
A print of the Quad adorns one
wall, while a large photo of the
White House faces a framed Stan

ford magazine fold-out cover fea
turing 10 Stanford athletes.
In the photo session for that
cover, Cohn's favorite, he pitched
tennis balls to Stanford tennis star
Rvan Wolters and helped volley
ball standout Kerri Walsh with her
spike. "It was a lot of fun." he said.
His own time as a Stanford un
dergraduate, when he served as
managing editor for The Daily and
stringer for several newspapers,
shaped Cohn's love for journalism.
After college, he took a six
month internship with Newsweek
in Washington, D.C., which be
came a 10-year career, covering the
Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hear
ings, the Whitewater investigation
and several legal and foreign policy
issues.

Known as an energetic whirl
wind around the office. Cohn could
face a difficult transition to his new
post as executive editor for devel
opment at Industry Standard, a San
Francisco-based weekly news
magazine with a focus on the Inter
net economy.
The magazine's publication
schedule is hectic at best.
"I wanted to try something
new," Cohn said, "with a young and
exciting company in a young and
exciting industry.... Some might
call it suicidal."
Cohn didn't rule out a return to
Stanford in the future. "It seems
like every 10 years, I spend four
years at Stanford.... Maybe I'll be
able to come back in another
decade. I really love this place."
