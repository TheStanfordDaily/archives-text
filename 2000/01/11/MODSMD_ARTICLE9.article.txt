## AOL buys Time Warner in corporate merger 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — You've
got mail. And movies. And music.
And magazines.
In the most dramatic instance yet
of new media supplanting old
media, America Online is buying
lime Warner, the largest media and
entertainment conglomerate in the
world, for $162 billion.
The deal would be the biggest
corporate merger of all time, as well
as an aggressive bet that online
delivery of media is the wave of the
future.
"This merger will launch the
next Internet revolution," said
Steve Case. America Online'schair

man and chief executive, told a
news conference Monday. "We're
still just scratching the surface."
Case will he chairman of the new
company, which will be called AOL
Time Warner Inc. and headquar
tered in New York. Time Warner
chairman Gerald Levin will be its
chief executive. Ted Turner, who
owns 9 percent of Time Warner,
will retain his title of vice chairman.
America Online shareholders
will own 55 percent of the company,
and Time Warner shareholders the
rest. AOL Time Warner's brands
would include AOL, CompuServe,
CNN. Time, Netscape, TBS. TNT,

Cartoon Network. HBO, Warner
Music Group, Fortune. Sports Illus
trated. Entertainment Weekly and
Looney Tunes.
The deal values Time Warner at
about $108 a share, a rich premium
over its price of $64.75 a share
before Monday. Time Warner
shares soared 39 percent on news of
the deal, climbing $25.31 1/4 to
$90.06 1/4 a share on the.New York
Stock Exchange. AOL shares fell
$1.75 to $72.
Analysts expect competing
Internet and entertainment compa
nies to seek similar deals in hopes of
keeping pace with AOL and Time

Warner, and some of those stocks
also got a lift Monday. Disney
jumped $4.81 1/4 to $35.93 3/4 and
News Corp. rose $7.31 1/4 to 45.06
1/4 on the NYSE. Lycos leaped $9
to $79.75 and Yahoo! climbed
$28.81 1/4 to $436.06 1/4 on the Nas
daq Stock Market.
The deal marks a major turning
point in the media industry, high
lighting the massive power and
value that Internet companies like
AOL have built up in a relatively
short time.
America Online, based in Dulles.
Va., has more than four times the
net profit of Time Warner, earning

$762 million in the fiscal year that
ended June 30, even though Time
Warner's revenues of $26.8 billion
dwarf AOL's $4.8 billion.
In combining the leading Inter
net company with the leading tradi
tional media company, the deal also
shows that new media and old
media need each other more than
ever before.
AOL needed access not only to
Time Warner's media content
machine — which produces films,
music, TV shows and magazines —
but also to Time Warner's large net
work of cable TV lines, which is sec
ond onlv to AT&T's and reaches 20

percent of U.S. households.
Time Warner, like other major
media companies, has been in the
middle of a major effort to reinvent
its own Internet strategy. Last year
it set aside $500 million to invest in
Internet opportunities.
With the AOL deal, Time Warn
er acquired an online platform of 22
million subscribers — including
CompuServe customers — for
delivering its content to computer
users, a goal it has had for some
time. "This really completes the dig
ital transformation of Time Warn
er," Levin said. "These two compa
nies are a natnral fit "
