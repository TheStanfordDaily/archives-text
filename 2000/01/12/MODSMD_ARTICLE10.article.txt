# Clinton performs roles reserved for vice president and first lady
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — It's
beginning to look like a lame-duck
year. President Clinton's schedule
shows him performing some duties
often left to the vice president and
the first lady — both busy campaign
ing elsewhere.
A funeral, a White House prayer
session, an environmental preserva
tion program, another unpacking
and decorating session in Chap
paqua. N.Y.. and a little Democratic
fund-raising occupied much of the
president's week.
True. Clinton has just finished the
heavy business of husbanding Mid
dle East peace talks in Shepherd
stown, W.Va. And the While I louse
is hiis\ shaping ('linton's final State
of the Union address, which aides
say will be a major summing-up of
his time in Washington, as well as
working out numbers for the 2(H)1
budget plan that Clinton delivers to
Congress next month.
But this is the lame duck long
stretch, the final year of the C linton-
Gore administration, and Clinton
often finds himself home alone.
"It's duty by default." said Amer
ican University government profes
sor and White House-watcher
Richard Semiatin. It's not surprising.

Semiatin said, that Clinton is willing
to stand in at "ceremonial duties" for
his vice president and his wife.
"Clinton has had such a close
relationship with his vice president,
and he wants him to have enough
time to campaign," Semiatin added.
"You have the unprecedented situa
tion with his wife running for Senate,
and who's left holding the bag when
they're off campaigning?"
Clinton seemed to enjoy himself
the other day when he welcomed
Muslim clerics to the White House
for a celebration to mark the end of
the holv month of Ramadan.
Heretofore, first lady Hillary Rod
ham Clinton presided at the annual
event, but as Clinton explained to Ins
guests, she was out of town.
And he was cleat ly moved later
Monday, when he tenderly laid a
hand upon the casket of retired
Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. after
eulogizing the crusading former
chief of naval operations.
Clinton called Zumwalt a friend,
and he might have attended the
funeral no matter what. Still, funer
als are almost always the province of
a vice president.
Meanwhile, both Mrs. Clinton
and Vice President Al Gore were in

New York, a vital primary state {in
the presidential race Gore hopes lo
win in November and the state
where Mrs. Clinton hopes to r>e
elected senator ihis year.
Gore was there to deliver a major
speech at the United Nations in N<Jw
York that may help mollify A1I)S
activists who have dogged his presi
dential campaign. |
Mrs. Clinton was also in New
York in the morning, then returned
lo Washington in time to attend the
Zumwalt funeral. She later returned
to New York, where she said Tues
day she hopes to have her husband
and daughter at her side for a formal
announcement of her candidacy
next month.
On Tuesday, Clinton used i(ie
Grand Canyon for a backdrop as he
announced establishment of new
national monuments, a designation
that the administration says w ill help
protect threatened lands.
Gore has been the administration
point man on the environment for
seven years, and lie accompanied
Clinton the last time the president
visited the majestic canyon. But
Gore was in lowa, site of the presi
dential caucuses less than two weeks
hence.
