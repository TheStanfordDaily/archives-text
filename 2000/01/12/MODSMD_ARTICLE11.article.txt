# Chinese stowaways found on ship from Hong Kong
## 
### 
SEATTLE (AP) — Three Chi
nese stowaways were found dead
this week in a cargo container that
arrived aboard a ship from Hong
Kong — the first known deaths in
what has suddenly become one of
the busiest methods of smuggling
immigrants into the United States.
Crammed into 4()-foot. canvas
topped corrugated-metal boxes, the
stowaways try to survive on bottled
water and little food for the two
week voyage across the Pacific from
China.
Immigration officers have
stepped up efforts to catch the
immigrants and the smugglers they
pay up to $5(),(J(K) to make the trip,
but the boxes keep coming.
"Until now, the prices migrants
have paid for illegal passage to the
United States have been high in
terms of dollars," said Bob Cole
man, acting director of the Immigra
tion and Naturalization Service in
Seattle, "but in a situation like this,
where lives are lost, the cost is
unfathomable."

On Monday, federal officials
boarded the Cape May, a Japanese
owned freighter that left Hong
Kong for Seattle on Dec. 27, and
found three dead Chinese and 15
others in threadbare clothes and
bare feet. All of them required med
ical care, and four remained hospi
talized Tuesday. The cause of death
was not immediately released.
On Tuesday morning. 19 more
immigrants, all in relatively good
health, were found in a container
from a ship that likewise docked in
Hong Kong before arriving here.
INS spokeswoman Irene Mor
tensen said conditions inside the
container from the Cape May were
deplorable. People barely had
enough room to lie down, and had
only the bedding and survival gear
they brought with them.
Food consisted of slowly rotting
vegetables and crackers. The only
toilet was a bucket: the only ventila
tion came from holes cut in the can
vas roof.
For anywhere from three to

seven days, the 15 survivors, many
of them seasick, lay next to the bod
ies of the dead.
Last month, authorities in Long
Beach, Calif., arrested 30 illegal
immigrants from China after they
arrived in cargo containers.
ITieir travel conditions were bet
ter than those of the group caught in
Seattle. The containers had ftxxl,
water, battery-powered lights,
portable potties, cell phones and
ladders for climbing out.
For years, Chinese smugglers
called "snakeheads" have been
bringing illegal immigrants to this
country aboard ships to both coasts
and through Canada. But the use of
the sealed containers is a relatively
new twist, and Monday's deaths
were the first known to have
occurred through that method.
In the past year, authorities
caught 203 people smuggled via
container to West Coast ports in the
United States and Canada. How
many more make it through isn't
known.
