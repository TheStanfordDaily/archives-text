Oversight committee's
review of departments
benefits students

At a moderately large research
university where class sizes
are just too high for profes
sors to give individual attention to
everyone, it is inevitable that much of
the personalized attention that goes
on in the academic experience will fall
to Teaching Assistants.
Furthermore, when the number of
undergrads far exceeds the number of
graduate students available — partic
ularly in the sciences at Stanford
those working as TAs will be less and
less academically experienced: in
many cases they will be undergradu
ates themselves.
It therefore goes without saying
that ensuring that every TA receives
sufficient preparation should be a
very high priority. Keeping that in
mind, the work of the Stanford over
sight committee, which will now

examine guidelines and review each
department's preparation of TAs, is
crucial.
Developed a year ago, the commit
tee supervises TA training and is now
becoming more involved in the pro
cess at the departmental level.
Whether an undergraduate is an
appropriate choice lor a TA position
remains to be seen. Provided that the
undergraduate shows a comparable
proficiency in and enthusiasm for the
subject as a graduate student, many
claim that it would be difficult to
argue against such a practice — espe
cially if there is a shortage of potential
graduate student TAs.
However, making sure that every
TA receives a certain basic standard
of training is a goal everyone should
agree to. And since departments are
usually the ones deciding who will be
a TA and what subject training they
will receive getting involved at that
stage of the process is the best way to
ensure that the students are not the
losers in the whole process.
