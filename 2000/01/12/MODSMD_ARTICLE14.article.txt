New I-Hum hook pro
gram looks to enhance
the freshman experience

By bringing playwright Tom
Stoppard to Kresge Auditori
um on Monday, the Introduc
tion to the Humanities Program lias
continued an institution that will he
an excellent part of the freshman
experience at Stanford.
Through the I-Hum Freshman
Book Program, all freshmen were
asked to read Stoppard's "Arcadia."
Prospective freshmen can now look
forward to the program and its speak
ers as part of their Stanford career.
The best aspect of the program is
the early interaction with a high-pro
file personality. Stoppard's dialogue
with freshmen brought him down to
earth and injected them with a dose
of confidence.
The big problem was 1-Hurn's
advertising of the event as open to
the general public, when in reality it

gave priority to freshmen and had to
turn many upperclassmen and gradu
ate students away. The Stoppard fans
who showed up early were the only
non-freshmen to be allowed in kres
ge-
Because this is a freshman pro
gram, the l-llum organizers have the
right to use this priority system. Il is
unfortunate, though, that the people
who have put in more time at Stan
ford were rather ignored in the pro
cess.
The l-l lum organizers should have
taken upperclassmen into better con
sideration, such as publicizing a
broadcast on the Stanford Channel.
They might have also elected to hold
a lecture by such a popular speaker at
Memorial Auditorium (which holds
about twice as many people as Kres
ge). giving freshmen priority for sit
ting closer to the podium for "intima
cy" during the question and-answer
period. Ideally, a public speaker
ought to be shared with the entire
Stanford community.
