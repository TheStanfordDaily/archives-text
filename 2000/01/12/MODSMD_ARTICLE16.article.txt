# Fighting the good fight
## Corey Griffin There's no truth about the bonfire 
### 
Mark Twain said
there are three
kinds of lies: lies,
damn lies and statisties.
To that list, I'd like to add
anything the University
administration has told
you and will tell you about

the traditional Big Game Bonfire in Lake
Lagunita.
I'm not trying to say there is some sort of
conspiracy about the bonfire. The adminis
tration isn't trying to cover something up.
University President Gerhard Casper sim
ply decided that there are things more
important than tradition at Stanford,
including graduate housing, money and
relations with neighboring communities.
I have been fortunate enough — or
unfortunate enough, depending on how you
look at it to be involved in past efforts to
bring back the bonfire, and I decided I
couldn't leave Stanford without passing on
what I know.
So much has been said about the bonfire
in the past few years, it seems like the facts
and history have gotten all muddled to the
point where it's easy for the administration
to say. "There is no bonfire because of the
tiger salamander."
But that isn't the whole story.
In 1993. students voluntarily stopped the
traditional bonfire in Lake Lagunita after
the discovery of the California tiger sala
mander with the understanding that a study
would be conducted to see if the bonfire
impacted the salamander and what could be
done lo both continue the bonfire tradition
and protect the salamander.
The study by Stanford's Center of the
Conservation of Biology took longer than
expected. When the study was completed,
the administration would not release the
results. I inallv in 1996, students obtained

the results that were eventually made public
in 1997, almost five years after the last bon
fire in the lake bed.
Without going into too much detail, the
study states that only 13 percent of the sala
manders in the lake bed would be "impact
ed" — not killed.
Moreover, the salamanders only begin
their migration to Lake Lagunita "in late
November or early December when the
first heavy rainfall occurs and Lagunita
begins to fill with water." Water in Lake
Lagunita, signaling the beginning of the
salamanders' time in the lakebed, also
means the bonfire would have to be held
elsewhere.
So if a bonfire would at most only mini
mally impact the salamanders, why did
administrators shoot down the latest
attempt to bring hack the bonfire for the
l(K)th Big Game in 1997?
Imagine a strange card game with the
University playing against environmental
ists, government and local communities.
They have three cards in their hand: the
Lyman graduate housing complex, the Sand
Hill expansion project and the bonfire.
They can only play two of the cards, so they
choose the Sand Hill project because that
brings money and Lyman because more
graduate housing means better graduate
students, better research and a better repu
tation for Stanford. Hoping students aren't
watching, he discards the bonfire. After all,
what tangible benefits does it bring Stan
ford?
It seems the University forgot about
alumni giving. It's events like the old Big
Game Bonfires that alumni remember long
after leaving Stanford. Without touchstones
and traditions that reach all undergradu
ates. why give money?
According to Laura Jones in the plan
ning office, the University even signed an

agreement with State and Federal govern
ments to make every effort to protect the
California tiger salamander that included a
promise to stop the bonfires. Yet, today the
University continues planning to build even
more permanent buildings, especially grad
uate student housing, near the lakebed and
salamander habitat. How is that making
every effort to protect the salamander?
Furthermore, the university continues to
mow the weeds in the lakebed with a heavy
tractor. I wonder how many salamanders
that tractor and it's blades "impact."
Now, with the General Use Permit
(GUP) hanging over the heads of the
administration, no one will even talk about
the bonfire.
The administration is counting on you to
forget all about the bonfires of old. It's been
more than seven years since the last fire,
and administrators think it will only take
another four before people like me stop
talking about, stop asking about and stop
caring about it. They hope this thorn in their
collective side will simply disappear.
My hope is that the next president of this
awesome university will not only be more
open and willing to listen to the students but
also balance student concerns with those of
reputation, housing and money. I hope the
presidential search committee underway
right now looks for a president that values
tradition as much as the Stanford students
do.
Otherwise, one of the longest standing
Stanford traditions will truly be gone forev
er, and who knows which tradition will be
next.
