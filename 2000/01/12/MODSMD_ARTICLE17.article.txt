Stop pare! event demonstrat
ed poor planning
I wns bitterly disappointed by the poor
planning for Tom Stoppard's visit. I am one
of the probably 20(1 people that were
turned away from the talk.
Monday night's event should have been
held in a larger auditorium. I was told it
was scheduled for Kresge to provide an
intimate setting for the freshmen. I can
accept that, but don't advertise it as open to
the public.
An ideal solution for this event would
be to hold the talk in Kresge to provide
intimacy, but then have a video feed to
another auditorium so others in the com
munity could hear Stoppard talk. I saw sev
eral people watching the talk through a
crack in the curtains: clearly this is ridicu
lous.
As an avid Stoppard fan. I am upset that
I was not able to see him talk. What is the
point of coming to an institution that has
prominent speakers if the events are so
poorly planned that large groups of people
do not get to see it?
The organizers of Monday's talk clearly
anticipated that they would be turning peo
ple away because they had photocopied
signs to post when the auditorium was full.
Instead of making signs, they should have
devised a solution that would allow all the
people that wanted to see the talk in to sec
it.

New Coffee House lacks
atmosphere
I too have always loved the dark, cozy
and yes, crummy atmosphere of the old Co
Ho. Despite the painfully slow service, the
food was yummy, and I could always melt
into the crowd and feel perfectly at home.
Today I walked into the new Co Ho,
looked around and walked out. What a dis
appointment! The place is antiseptic, harsh
with its lighting and uniform in more than
just the employees' attire. My heart sank.
Where's the dark wood, the booths, the
chalk board, the interesting art, the smells
and the warmth? Even on this rainy day, it
chilled me to be inside the building more
than it did outside. Something has got to be
done, starting with the dreadful lighting!

Post office needs self service
stamp machines
Perhaps the post office could make up
for fewer window personnel by putting in
some self-service stamp machines that actu
ally function. If you look closely at the
photo in Thursday's paper, there is a
machine, but it sports an "out of order"
sign.
