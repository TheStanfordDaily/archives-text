## Women's gymnastics prepare for season openers Veteran-led Cardinal squad ready to fly against Sun Devils, Terrapins and Buckeyes 
### Katie Fitzpatrick 
The No. 11 Cardinal opens its
regular season on Friday against No.
7 Arizona State. No. 18 Maryland,
and No. 20 Ohio State.
The gymnasts are excited to
begin their season. "It's when all the
hard work pays off," junior Jenny
Wilson said.
Although it's early in the season
and the Cardinal has time for im
provement. it is right on schedule ac
cording to assistant coach Wayne
Wright.
"We don't want to be our
strongest until the end of the sea
son." said Wilson.
The senior class seeks to comple
ment their already impressive ca
reers with a trip to NCAA Nationals
and a spot in the "Super Six" team fi
nals this year. Leadership and expe
rience will be instrumental in such
an effort.
Senior co-captain Kim Young
has played a significant role in the
rise of the Cardinal program during
her career. A strong performer on
the beam last season, she will add
depth to the beam lineup after re
cently returning to training.
Senior Ail-American Larissa
Fontaine, a vocal team leader, will
provide consistency and depth in
possibly every event this year. Hin
dered by a chronic elbow injury, she
only recently began training uneven
parallel bars after more than a year.
She is on schedule to reenter the bar
lineup later this season.
Fontaine is no stranger to adver
sity. Last season, the 1998 NCAA
vaulting champion overcame a near
season ending injury to compete on
three events for Stanford and placed
third on the vault at Nationals.

"Larissa is incredible," fellow senior
All-American Sarah Harding said.
Harding is also poised to have a
big impact on the team. Alter mak
ing tremendous progress in the pre
season. 1 larding should be a force in
the uneven bar lineup as well as the
anchor in the floor lineup with a re
vamped, more difficult routine.
Harding should be a contender
again this year for the NCAA floor
title.
Juniors Jennifer Exaltacion and
Jenny Wilson were two strong all
arounders for the Cardinal last year
and they should again have a large
impact on the team. Exaltacion
seeks to improve her already im
pressive resume. The school record
holder on beam had a great presea
son and is looking strong, according
to assistant coach Rene Lyst-Cook.
Exaltacion, a 1996 Canadian
Olympian, will anchor a solid beam
lineup of seasoned competitors.
Wilson, a powerful athlete, fin
ished third last year in the Ail-
Around at the NCAA Region IV
Championships. A strong vault per
former. she should again be a staple
of the lineup.
The sophomore class is led by
1999 Region IV beam co-champion,
Katy I lerbert. Herbert will be a top
Cardinal performer and be strong
on every event. During the presea
son she increased the difficulty of
her routines and will be instrumen
tal in the Cardinal's success.
Sophomore All-American
Kristin Jensen has also looked
strong in the preseason. Her floor
routine will be showcased by diffi
cult tumbling passes. According to
Cook, she is one of the strongest
tumblers on the team and should
have one of the most difficult floor

routines in the nation.
Fellow sophomore Becky Mel
drum will provide the leadership she
demonstrated last year. Her consis
tency on the beam will likely place
her in the opening spot in the beam
lineup — a crucial position that sets
the tone for the rest of the beam ro
tation.
Sophomore Kristen Derr is re
covering from a wrist injury and
making good progress toward being
at full strength.
The freshman class of Alissa
Cooper. Abby Gair, Lauren Gleti
man. Jules McCrawand Kelsey Still
inger brought with them impressive
credentials. In Tempe. they will
have their first opportunity to see
their routines judged on the colle
giate level.
"We're relying a lot on our fresh
man." said Fontaine.
Gair. an all-around performer,
will need to step up for the Cardinal.
Cook has been impressed with her
ability and fierce desire to compete.
Her unique routine on bars should
produce high scores.
Stillinger. the 19 l ) 7 Junior Olympic
National beam champion, will be a
performer to watch on beam, while
adding depth in other areas.
Cooper's preseason perfor
mance has earned her spots in the
vault and uneven bar lineups. Gleit
man has also had a strong preseason
and will also add depth to the floor
lineup.
The Cardinal expects to have a
solid start against formidable Ari
zona State."It will be a tough meet
against two teams with national ex
perience." Wright said.
