# Students comment on grapes vote results and low voter turnout
## 
### Melissa Lambert Contributing writer 
When senior Nate Gillespie
first came to Stanford, he "went
along" with most of his freshman
dorm in voting to support the Stan
ford grape boycott.
But Gillespie, a resi
dent assistant in Cardenal, voted
against the boycott himself and
said most people in his house had a
" 'So what?' attitude about the
whole thing."
Gillespie is not alone. Increas
ing apathy and discontent with the
boycott appears to be campus
wide.
For the first time since Stanford
began voting on whether or not to
support the United Farm Work
ers' table grapes boycott in dining
halls, a majority of students voted
this past November to oppose it.
The grape boycott has been an
issue at Stanford since 1994. when
four students staged a three-day
hunger strike to protest the condi
tions of grape workers.
The University struck down re
quests for a campus-wide grape
boycott and turned the matter
over to the Office of Residential
Education.
Residences now vote on the
issue in November of each year,
after a month in which information
is provided to each residence in the
form of fliers and videos that rep
resent the pros and cons of the
boycott.
But according to Gillespie,
"Those people who were there and
witnessed [the hunger strike] are
all gone now. Most people today
don't really understand why they
are supposed to care."
"The [grapes debate] video ...
was trying so hard to put out so
many different viewpoints, it
ended up saying nothing," he said.
"The LJniversity .. .didn't do a
very good job clarifying why this
should be the big issue of debate."
He added. "People who have
been here a while are getting
weary of the process itself.... A
no vote is more a vote against the
whole grapes debate process itself
than against the boycott."
Said sophomore Josh Hawley,

"As we get more and more re
moved from [the hunger strike],
people have much less of an emo
tional link to either side of the
issue. 1 also believe there is a con
tinual decline at Stanford of any
political activism."
Despite this, a small but vocal
minority still strongly supports the
boycott.
Senior Jorge Manzano, an eth
nic theme associate at Casa Zapa
ta. said, "Over the years, the grape
boycott has become the symbol of
our fight for living in unity. If an in
stitution like Stanford can throw
its weight behind the boycott,
some change can be made."
But even Manzano said, "At
the beginning, when the boycott
started, it was more of a live issue.
Now it is more institutionalized â€”
you just have to log in and vote yes
or no."
Manzano explained the low
turnout of voters and lack of sup
port for the boycott by saying,
"Stanford students are so con
cerned with their l-banking future,
they don't care about real social
concerns."
For him. he said. "It's not so
much a boycott, it's people earning
the right to live in a healthy envi
ronment. We all want that."
Freshman Gabriela Rico said
her support of the boycott is
deeply personal, as her mother
worked as a migrant farm worker
in California for 15 years picking
strawberries.
"My mother couldn't afford a
babysitter, so I had to go during
the day and wait in the fields while
she worked," Rico said. "The bliss
es harassed a lot of the women, and
thev were never careful about
what pesticides they exposed the
workers to."
Rico remembers once when her
mother was working when the
field was sprayed with pesticide.
The pilot said he couldn't see the
workers because it was foggy, but
"because there were about 24
workers in the Field, I don't see
how it could have been acciden
tal."
