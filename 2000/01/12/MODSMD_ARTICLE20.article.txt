# From the cheap seats
## Ben Jones Stanford gives a heartfelt goodbye to another old friend 
### 
Although I'm as tired of V2K as
kids al Stem are of eating eereal
for dinner. I must make one last ref
erence to the new era. In this time of
"millenniums." things really are
changing.

Out with the old. in with the new,
right?
Even the world of athletics here at
Stanford is not immune to a changing
oft he guard.
Nowhere will this he more appar
ent than when the men's volleyball
season kicks off this month.
The 2(HH) season marks the first
time the men's squad will play its
home games 111 Maples Pavilion
rather than the friendly confines of
Burnham Pavilion. And while the
team has upgraded to a more modern
facility with quite a hit more seating,
we've all lost a little something with

the continued fading of the old Hum
ham gym into the background of the
Stanford sports landscape.
If you never went to a men's game
at Burnham. my friend, you missed
out. This was spectator sports person
ified.
First off. the rickety bleachers ex
tended right onto the court, giving
fans the opportunity to energize play
ers. and in true Stanford tradition,
taunt opponents. Think the Sixth
man disrupts opponents trying to
shoot free throws or run the half court
offense? At Burnham. you get "in a
player's kitchen "without raising your

voice above a whisper. Every player
that retreated back near the fans to
serve was subjected to a barrage of in
sults that would evoke a wave of
laughter and cheers among the fans in
earshot.
And if you wanted to scream, a
group of 10 to 12 fans was all it took to
sound like the entire right field
bleachers at Yankee Stadium.
Second, fans were almost as much
a part of the action as players. With
spikes rtxketing off the arms of out
side hitters and middle blockers, any
one not paying attention to the game
could have been rewarded with a

screaming volleyball to the chin.
Many an errant ball sent fans scatter
ing in all directions and the usually
toddler-aged ball kids scrambling
under the bleachers to retrieve them.
After games, the fans walk right
down onto the court to mingle with
players. The visiting team would have
to go out into the lobby bathrooms to
change for the bus ride home.
The fans ate hot dogs, popcorn
and red vines, not sushi or garlic fries.
And the ball echoed off the walls
no matter where it hit on the court.
But more than anything. Burn
ham is a gym in the truest sense of the

word.
Almost all of us can fondly re
member times spent in gyms just like
it. That Ã¼biquitous smell, the hard
wood floors, the bleachers.
From YMCA games in fourth
grade to those earlv-niorning basket
ball practices in eighth grade when
the gym somehow managed to be 20
degrees below zero and your failed
athlete/failed drill instructor coach
sounded louder than the amplifier at
a Sir-Mix-a-Lot concert. From mid
winter wrestling matches to volley

Jones
