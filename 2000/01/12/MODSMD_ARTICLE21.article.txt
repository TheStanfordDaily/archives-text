## Cell to cell communication in the Arabidopsis plant 
### Katharine Miller Contributing writer 
"This picture shows you the most impor
tant thing on Earth." Elliot Meyerowitz of
the California Institute of Technology pro
elaimed at the beginning of his talk titled
"Cell-Cell Communication in the Arabidop
sis Shoot Apex."
The audience laughed. The photo showed
a blobby. humpy mass reminiscent of the
enlarged pollen grains you see in ads for hay
fever medicine. In fact, it was not pollen but
the shoot apical meristem of an Arabidopsis
plant.
Many scientists might think that the sub
ject of their research is the most important
thing on earth, but unlike them. Meyerowitz
might be right — even if many of us have
never heard of a shoot apical meristem.
All of the above-ground parts of all plants
on earth are derived from cells in the shoot
apical meristem. Without plants, there could
be in) life as we know it — there would be
insufficient oxygen to breathe, too much car
bon dioxide in the atmosphere, nothing to
eat and no petroleum products (derived
from plant remains) to burn.
Since the shoot apical meristem produces
all of the cells that become leaves, stems,
flowers and seeds, it may indeed be the most
important thing on earth.
Meyerowitz studies the meristem in the
Arabidopsis plant, a small flowering plant
that would fit in the palm of your hand.
Despite its diminutive size, studying the Ara
bidopsis shoot apical meristem is useful for
understanding all plants because it functions
much the same way in all plants — including
very large ones, such as an oak tree or giant
Sequoia.
The shoot apical meristem
The meristem is a dome-shaped group of
about 3CK) cells at the tip of a plant. The cells
are undifferentiated-like embryonic cells —
and remain that way throughout the life of
the plant.
The meristem exhibits several properties,
suggesting the need for cell-cell communica
tion.

Although cell division never stops in the
meristem. the meristem itself stays the same
size. Thus, cells are leaving the meristem (to
become flowers, stems, leaves, etc.) at the
precise rate at which they are being replicat
ed within the meristem.
Moreover, the rate of cell division is dif
ferent in different parts of the meristem. In
the "central zone" it is slow; in the peripher
al zone (which is in a ring around the central
zone) and the rib zone (the core of the
dome) it is faster.
Cell-to-cell communication
As in much scientific research, to under
stand how something works, you study what
doesn't work. Meyerowitz looked at mutant
plants in which the meristem grows exces
sively instead of staying a constant size.
He found that what was missing from
some of these mutant plants (called Clavatal
mutants) was a molecule that normally
extends from inside a rib zone cell into the
space outside the cell — as a kind of TV
antenna to receive molecular messages from
other cells.
The molecule is called a transmembrane
receptor kinase — a type of protein. This
kinase has a segment that repeats one partic
ular amino acid — leucine — more than oth
ers. Such a segment is often important for
binding to a protein outside of the cell.
In another type of mutant plant (called
Clavata3 mutants) with the same excessive
growth, a different protein is missing — a
protein normally found in cells in the central
zone of the meristem.
Meyerowitz hypothesized that in nonmu
tants, the Clavata3 protein is the messenger
that binds to the Clavatal receptor in the rib
zone cells to reduce the rate of cell growth in
that region.
The more central zone cells there are, the
more the Clavata3 protein is produced —
telling more rib zone cells to stop or slow
down their replication.
When either of these proteins is absent,
the system fails, and the meristem grows out
of control.
To test his hypothesis, Meyerowitz first
produced plants that would overexpress the

Clavata3 protein. The result: the meristem
gradually disappeared, and the plant stopped
growing. Thus, it seemed that the Clavata3
protein was telling the rib zone cells not to
reproduce.
In a related test, Meyerowitz produced
Clavatal mutant plants (essentially remov
ing the receptor from the rib zone cells) that
would also overexpress Clavata3 protein.
Since the rib zone cells had no reefcptor to
receive the Clavata3 message (telling the
cells to stop replication), the meristem grew
out of control. This seems to confirm
Meyerowitz's hypothesis that Clavata3 is the
messenger to the Clavatal antennae.

Other pathways
The research described above is just the
tip of the iceberg. There are several other
possible pathways of controlling cell
growth and replication.
In addition, if transmembrane receptor
kinases such as the Clavatal protein are a
key to cell-cell communication, there are
hundreds more similar molecules in Ara
bidopsis alone.
There are only about 50 cell types in the
Arabidopsis plant, and many of the kinas
es are produced only by particular cell
types. This suggests that these hundreds of

similar lcucine-rich kinases offer more
than enough potential methods of commu
nication between different parts of the
plant.
One upshot of Meverowit/.'s work could
be the development of plants mutated to
have favorable traits: stouter stems in
wheat, larger fruit, more beautiful flowers.
As Meyerowitz explained. "There are
ways to make the fruit bigger without
understanding the process. But what we're
trying to do is understand the process."
And there's a beauty in doing that
even if it might not really be the most
important thing on earth.

The apical meristem is located near the tips of roots and shoots, and is responsible for primary growth, or growth in length.
The cells of the meristem are broken down into the central zone, the peripheral zone and the rib zone meristem cells.

The molecule is called a transmembrane
receptor kinase — a type of protein. This
kinase has a segment that repeats one partic
ular amino acid — leucine — more than oth
ers. Such a segment is often important for
binding to a protein outside of the cell.
In another type of mutant plant (called
Clavata3 mutants) with the same excessive
growth, a different protein is missing — a
protein normally found in cells in the central
zone of the meristem.
Meyerowitz hypothesized that in nonmu
tants, the Clavata3 protein is the messenger
that binds to the Clavatal receptor in the rib
zone cells to reduce the rate of cell growth in
that region.
The more central zone cells there are, the
more the Clavata3 protein is produced —
telling more rib zone cells to stop or slow
down their replication.
When either of these proteins is absent,
the system fails, and the meristem grows out
of control.
To test his hypothesis, Meyerowitz first
produced plants that would overexpress the

Clavata3 protein. The result: the meristem
gradually disappeared, and the plant stopped
growing. Thus, it seemed that the Clavata3
protein was telling the rib zone cells not to
reproduce.
In a related test, Meyerowitz produced
Clavatal mutant plants (essentially remov
ing the receptor from the rib zone cells) that
would also overexpress Clavata3 protein.
Since the rib zone cells had no reefcptor to
receive the Clavata3 message (telling the
cells to stop replication), the meristem grew
out of control. This seems to confirm
Meyerowitz's hypothesis that Clavata3 is the
messenger to the Clavatal antennae.

Other pathways
The research described above is just the
tip of the iceberg. There are several other
possible pathways of controlling cell
growth and replication.
In addition, if transmembrane receptor
kinases such as the Clavatal protein are a
key to cell-cell communication, there are
hundreds more similar molecules in Ara
bidopsis alone.
There are only about 50 cell types in the
Arabidopsis plant, and many of the kinas
es are produced only by particular cell
types. This suggests that these hundreds of

similar lcucine-rich kinases offer more
than enough potential methods of commu
nication between different parts of the
plant.
One upshot of Meverowit/.'s work could
be the development of plants mutated to
have favorable traits: stouter stems in
wheat, larger fruit, more beautiful flowers.
As Meyerowitz explained. "There are
ways to make the fruit bigger without
understanding the process. But what we're
trying to do is understand the process."
And there's a beauty in doing that
even if it might not really be the most
important thing on earth.

The apical meristem is located near the tips of roots and shoots, and is responsible for primary growth, or growth in length.
The cells of the meristem are broken down into the central zone, the peripheral zone and the rib zone meristem cells.
