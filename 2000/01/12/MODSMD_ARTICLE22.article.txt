# Top 20 tech flops of the century
## 
### Bruce Wang Editorial staff 
To commemorate the century
that gave birth to Murphy's Law
("Whatever can go wrong, will go
wrong"), the people at the Annals of
Improbable Research have selected
the centuries top 20 tech flops. AIR
is the science humor magazine that
awards the annual Ig Nobel Frizes,
honoring "achievements that cannot
or should not be reproduced."
Here are the 20 top tech screw
ups of the 20th century.
20. April 14. I ( )12: The ocean
liner Titanic, described bv its manu
facturers as unsinkable, sank on her
maiden voyage.
19. In the early 19705, Boston's
new. 60-story Hancock Tower in
Boston began shedding its 500-
pound mirrored windows. The win
dow material had been used in much
smaller buildings, where it caused
similar problems; the Hancock
designers overlooked this fact. The
building also caused neighboring
utility lines and foundations to crack
and induced nausea in its occupants
when heavy winds blew.
15. May 6, 1937: The hydrogen
filled dirigible Hindenberg, arriving
in Lakehurst, N.J., after a transat
lantic flight, caught fire and disinte
grated.
17. Nov. 7. 1940: The Tacoma
Narrows Bridge, in Washington
state, twisted wildly and collapsed.
The twisting was caused by wind
forces the designers had ignored.
16. In the early and middle parts
of the century, powerful new antibi
otic drugs were developed, saving
countless millions of lives. By the
century's end. careless over-use of
these drugs fueled many microbes to
evolve resistance to them, thus
endangering countless millions ol
lives.
15. Sept. 1. 1983: A Soviet Su-15
jet fighter mistakenly shot down a
Korean Air civilian airliner near
Sakhalin Island. USSR, killing 26M
people.
14. July 3. 1988: The U.S. naval
vessel Vincennes mistakenly shot
down an Iran Air civilian airliner,
killing 290 people.
13. Jan. 28. 1956: The space shut

tle Challenger exploded shortly after
liftoff because a sealing ring failed.
The sealant material was known to
be brittle in the cold, and the rocket
had spent many hours sitting in cold
weather before launch.
12. During World War I. nearly
all the world's technological innova
tion was poured into the battlefields
of Europe. Both sides expected their
technology to quickly break the
impasse. Instead, it produced three
years of deadlocked trench, barbed
wire, rifle, grenade, machine gun.
artillery, gas, tank and airplane war
fare and the death of millions.
11. April 1986: The Chernobyl
nuclear power plant in Russia suf
fered a partial meltdown due to
design deficiencies and sloppy main
tenance. More than 30 people were
killed in the short term, thousands
more suffered severe illness and / or
impairment and a vast expanse of
land, water and air was laced with
radioactive contaminants.
10. In 1903. physicist Rene Pros
per Blondlot of the University of
Nancy. France, announced a new
discovery: a new kind of radiation
called "N-rays." After seeing a
demonstration of Blondlot's N-ray
detector, American physicist R.W.
Wood secretly removed the guts
from the machine and asked Blond
lot to repeat the demo. Although
Blondlot insisted that he was still
seeing N-rays. no one else did.
9. Dec. 3. 1984: The Union Car
bide chemical plant at Bhopal. India,
leaked toxic gas. killing more than
6.000 people.
8. Dec. 5. 1959: The Malpasset
Dam in the Reyran Valley on the
French Riviera cracked and burst.
Its foundation, which was seated
next to a seam of clay the designers
had ignored, had shifted, causing the
crack. More than 420 people died.
7. In 1989. Martin Fleischmann
and Stanley Pons, chemists at the
University of Utah, announced their
discovery of "Cold Fusion," a sim
ple. inexpensive way to produce
nuclear fusion. The announcement
triggered wild financial speculation
and frenzied, unsuccessful attempts
worldwide to reproduce the results.
Later, it appeared that Fleischmann
and Pons had based their claim on

poorly documented, sloppy experi
ments and were refusing to discuss
the details. The two scientists — and
their idea — became pariahs to
much of the science community.
6. In 1952, the de Havilland
Comet, a commercial jet aircraft,
made its dehut. Twenty-one were
built. Seven of them crashed due to a
kind of metal fatigue the designers
had not considered.
5. In 1962, Mariner 1, the first
U.S. spacecraft sent to explore the
planet Venus, went off-course short
ly after launch because of an error in
its guidance computer program. The
error was small: a wrong punctua
tion character in one line of code.
Instead of going to Venus, Mariner 1
went into the Atlantic Ocean.
4. From 1958 to 1962 a Chinese
government-mandated technologi
cal revolution called "The Great
Leap Forward" caused food produc
tion to plummet, which led to mas
sive famine.
Under orders, people over-used
and misused techniques that were
copied from the Soviet Union (soil
was plowed too deeply, seeds plant
ed too densely, irrigation projects
engineered badly, if at all, etc.)
Bureaucracy on all levels exacerbat
ed the problem by decreeing that
there was no problem.
The death toll from the famine is
estimated at 30 to 50 million people.
3. July 17, 1938: Pioneer aviator
Douglas (ever after to be called
"Wrong Way") Corrigan, took off
for California from an air field in
Brooklyn, N Y. He landed in Ire
land.
2. Juan Pablo Davila worked for
the Chilean government-owned
Codelco Company. In 1994. while
trading commodities via computer,
Davila accidently typed "buy" when
he meant to type "sell." After realiz
ing his mistake, he went into a fren
zy of buying and selling, ultimately
losing approximately 0.5 percent of
the country's gross national product.
His name thereupon became a verb,
"davilar," meaning "to screw up roy
ally."
1. And finally comes the Y2K
computer bug, the nature of which is
all Ux> well known to turn-of-the
centurv readers.

Later, it appeared that Fleischmann
and Pons had based their claim on

poorly documented, sloppy experi
ments and were refusing to discuss
the details. The two scientists — and
their idea — became pariahs to
much of the science community.
6. In 1952, the de Havilland
Comet, a commercial jet aircraft,
made its dehut. Twenty-one were
built. Seven of them crashed due to a
kind of metal fatigue the designers
had not considered.
5. In 1962, Mariner 1, the first
U.S. spacecraft sent to explore the
planet Venus, went off-course short
ly after launch because of an error in
its guidance computer program. The
error was small: a wrong punctua
tion character in one line of code.
Instead of going to Venus, Mariner 1
went into the Atlantic Ocean.
4. From 1958 to 1962 a Chinese
government-mandated technologi
cal revolution called "The Great
Leap Forward" caused food produc
tion to plummet, which led to mas
sive famine.
Under orders, people over-used
and misused techniques that were
copied from the Soviet Union (soil
was plowed too deeply, seeds plant
ed too densely, irrigation projects
engineered badly, if at all, etc.)
Bureaucracy on all levels exacerbat
ed the problem by decreeing that
there was no problem.
The death toll from the famine is
estimated at 30 to 50 million people.
3. July 17, 1938: Pioneer aviator
Douglas (ever after to be called
"Wrong Way") Corrigan, took off
for California from an air field in
Brooklyn, N Y. He landed in Ire
land.
2. Juan Pablo Davila worked for
the Chilean government-owned
Codelco Company. In 1994. while
trading commodities via computer,
Davila accidently typed "buy" when
he meant to type "sell." After realiz
ing his mistake, he went into a fren
zy of buying and selling, ultimately
losing approximately 0.5 percent of
the country's gross national product.
His name thereupon became a verb,
"davilar," meaning "to screw up roy
ally."
1. And finally comes the Y2K
computer bug, the nature of which is
all Ux> well known to turn-of-the
centurv readers.
To commemorate the century
that gave birth to Murphy's Law
("Whatever can go wrong, will go
wrong"), the people at the Annals of
Improbable Research have selected
the centuries top 20 tech flops. AIR
is the science humor magazine that
awards the annual Ig Nobel Frizes,
honoring "achievements that cannot
or should not be reproduced."
Here are the 20 top tech screw
ups of the 20th century.
20. April 14. I ( )12: The ocean
liner Titanic, described bv its manu
facturers as unsinkable, sank on her
maiden voyage.
19. In the early 19705, Boston's
new. 60-story Hancock Tower in
Boston began shedding its 500-
pound mirrored windows. The win
dow material had been used in much
smaller buildings, where it caused
similar problems; the Hancock
designers overlooked this fact. The
building also caused neighboring
utility lines and foundations to crack
and induced nausea in its occupants
when heavy winds blew.
15. May 6, 1937: The hydrogen
filled dirigible Hindenberg, arriving
in Lakehurst, N.J., after a transat
lantic flight, caught fire and disinte
grated.
17. Nov. 7. 1940: The Tacoma
Narrows Bridge, in Washington
state, twisted wildly and collapsed.
The twisting was caused by wind
forces the designers had ignored.
16. In the early and middle parts
of the century, powerful new antibi
otic drugs were developed, saving
countless millions of lives. By the
century's end. careless over-use of
these drugs fueled many microbes to
evolve resistance to them, thus
endangering countless millions ol
lives.
15. Sept. 1. 1983: A Soviet Su-15
jet fighter mistakenly shot down a
Korean Air civilian airliner near
Sakhalin Island. USSR, killing 26M
people.
14. July 3. 1988: The U.S. naval
vessel Vincennes mistakenly shot
down an Iran Air civilian airliner,
killing 290 people.
13. Jan. 28. 1956: The space shut

tle Challenger exploded shortly after
liftoff because a sealing ring failed.
The sealant material was known to
be brittle in the cold, and the rocket
had spent many hours sitting in cold
weather before launch.
12. During World War I. nearly
all the world's technological innova
tion was poured into the battlefields
of Europe. Both sides expected their
technology to quickly break the
impasse. Instead, it produced three
years of deadlocked trench, barbed
wire, rifle, grenade, machine gun.
artillery, gas, tank and airplane war
fare and the death of millions.
11. April 1986: The Chernobyl
nuclear power plant in Russia suf
fered a partial meltdown due to
design deficiencies and sloppy main
tenance. More than 30 people were
killed in the short term, thousands
more suffered severe illness and / or
impairment and a vast expanse of
land, water and air was laced with
radioactive contaminants.
10. In 1903. physicist Rene Pros
per Blondlot of the University of
Nancy. France, announced a new
discovery: a new kind of radiation
called "N-rays." After seeing a
demonstration of Blondlot's N-ray
detector, American physicist R.W.
Wood secretly removed the guts
from the machine and asked Blond
lot to repeat the demo. Although
Blondlot insisted that he was still
seeing N-rays. no one else did.
9. Dec. 3. 1984: The Union Car
bide chemical plant at Bhopal. India,
leaked toxic gas. killing more than
6.000 people.
8. Dec. 5. 1959: The Malpasset
Dam in the Reyran Valley on the
French Riviera cracked and burst.
Its foundation, which was seated
next to a seam of clay the designers
had ignored, had shifted, causing the
crack. More than 420 people died.
7. In 1989. Martin Fleischmann
and Stanley Pons, chemists at the
University of Utah, announced their
discovery of "Cold Fusion," a sim
ple. inexpensive way to produce
nuclear fusion. The announcement
triggered wild financial speculation
and frenzied, unsuccessful attempts
worldwide to reproduce the results.
Later, it appeared that Fleischmann
and Pons had based their claim on

poorly documented, sloppy experi
ments and were refusing to discuss
the details. The two scientists — and
their idea — became pariahs to
much of the science community.
