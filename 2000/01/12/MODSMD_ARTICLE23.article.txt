## All you need to know about asthma 
### Monya De Contributing writer 
As anyone who has gasped
through the sixth-grade mile run
knows, asthma, especially in child
hood, is a common ailment. So com
mon, in fact, that it affects 20 million
Americans and ranks seventh in
incidence among all chronic dis
eases.
An asthmatic is identified by his
or her sensitivity to triggers such as
cigarette smoke, cold air, exercise,
medications, perfumes and pollen.
Even fear or stress can trigger the
physical symptoms, which consist of
coughing, wheezing, shortness of
breath and chest tightness.
Internally, the trigger causes the
lungs to make more mucus than
normal. This causes swelling and
muscle tightness, bringing on the
narrowing of the airways that
makes it difficult to breathe. The
condition can be mild to life-threat
ening.
Despite popular belief, children
do not "outgrow" asthma; it simply
has a tendency to go into remission,
and asthma can occur at any stage
of life.
The inhaler is the most common
form of asthma medication. Used
properly, it can provide the sufferer
with the ability to lead a normal life.
There are actually two types of
asthma medicines that comc out of
a little plastic inhaler or a pill, pow
der or injection. Bronchodilators
give relief during an asthma attack.
They relax the muscles of the air
way, allowing the patient to

breathe.
Anti-inflammatories, on the
other hand, work to keep the airway
open all of the time so that the
patient can avoid asthma attacks
altogether.
These medicines reduce the
swelling in the airway and decrease
the mucus. Their benefit occurs
over several weeks rather than
instantaneously.
Often a doctor will prescribe a
bronchodilator-anti-inflammatory
combination. The action of the
bronchodilator allows the anti
inflammatory to spread through the
body more easily, maximizing its
medicinal effect.
Another way to get the most out
of asthma medicine is to use a plas
tic spacer with an inhaler. The spac
er prevents the medication from
getting trapped in the mouth
instead of making it to the lungs.
Although anabolic steroids such
as prednisone are commonly pro
scribed for asthma patients, the
chance of steroid-related side
effects is present only when the
steroid is taken in pill or liquid form
over a long period of time.
More likely side effects from the
medication include rapid heartbeat,
loss of appetite or insomnia.
Research is underway at universi
ties and the National Institutes ol
Health to find more types of asthma
treatment.
Asthma management varies with
the severity of the case. Treatment
regimens range from simply toting
an albuterol inhaler for use before
or during physical activity, when a

person has "exercise-induced asth
ma." to frequent hospitalization for
voung children. I ighty percent of
the cost of asthma to the healthcare
system is due to the most severe
cases involving hospitalization.
Ik ing able to recognize the onset
of a severe asthma attack can save
lives. The patient becomes breath
less and unable to talk. The lips and
fingernails may turn bluish gray.
The patient should take his or her
medicine and get to an emergency
room right away.
In any type ol attack, only the
person's prescribed medication
should be taken, even if it takes a
while to have an effect. Cough syrup
will not help.
Personal asthma management
begins with identifying your trig
gers. I his gives you control. Ihe
result is that when and ii v<>u have
attacks, there's a good chance that
thev will be less severe and you
won't have as many.
For example, do vou get an asth
ma attack aftei you exercise'.' II you
do. you should tell youi doctor. on
can get help. You can still exercise
when you have asthma but you
may need to take rest breaks while
vou exercise. The doctor may tell
you to take your asthma medicine
before you exercise.
Avoiding the other common
triggers will help you breathe easier
too. Smoking and second hand
smoke should be avoided complete
ly Children are especially suscenti
ble to damage bom smoke: many
asthmatics and ncquent bronchitis
sufferers are children ol smokers.
