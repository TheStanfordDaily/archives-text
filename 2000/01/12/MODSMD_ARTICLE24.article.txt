# Garber discusses the balance of disciplines

### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
Envy between academic disci
plines, often fiercest between sibling
subjects, is inevitable and unlikely to
disappear from the American acade
my, literary and cultural critic Mar
jorie Garber told an audience last
night at the Law School in a talk titled
"Discipline Envy."
As the first presidential lecturer of
winter quarter, Garber spoke of the
bickering between history, philoso
phy, literature and cultural studies as
both a driving force of original schol
arship as well as an expression of ide
alized notions of academic inquiry.
The phrase "discipline envy"
draws on F-'reud's work on the "nar
cissism of minor differences," Gar
ber said, adding that this narcissism is
a "symptom of academic culture."
"Disciplinary turf battles both in
spire and depend upon such trespass
ing (on disciplinary boundaries],"
said Garber, who teaches English at
Harvard University.
The eminence of theory over
practice, for example, has elevated
abstract fields such as philosophy
over their less theoretical peer disci
plines in the academic hierarchy,
Garber said.
Another concrete consequence of
discipline envy can be found in the
social sciences, Garber suggested,
where the perception of rigor that ac
companies "number-crunching" has
sparked a movement toward quanti
tative social science scholarship.
The growing emphasis on neuro
scicnce in respected psychology de
partments and the fixation on ratio
nal choice theory and "math for
math's sake" in departments of eco
nomics are signs of this movement,
Garber said.
The rivalries between academic
disciplines are similar to the rivalries
between Englishmen and Scots, Gar
ber said.

In these rivalries, one category de
fines itself by its difference from the
other closely-related category, its
"evil twin."
"Similarity and contiguity breed
... self-doubt. [The] family resem
blance needs to be disavowed," Gar
ber said.
Discipline envy, then, is in part the
wish to appropriate the terms of an
other discipline, Garber said.
In the time of Plato, philosophy
was distinguished from sophistry,
where sophistry implied "fallacious
argumentation" as opposed to the
philosophical search for truth, Gar
ber said.
Although philosophers dismissed
sophistry by appealing to purity, the
differences have "come back to
haunt" philosophy, she said.
The solution to discipline envy,
Garber said, is the idea of genius.
Contemporary notions of "ge
nius" focus on the notion of "free
standing, unpropped" talent or ef
fortless originality, the product of
"innate mental dispositions."
We see the genius as the "bearer
of authenticity," Garber said, adding
that American culture has developed
a "crush" on the genius.
Genius in the humanities is often
seen as the "property of the past" and
is associated with figures such as Pin
dar, Homer and Shakespeare, Gar
ber said.
This view of genius as a phenome
non of the past follows from the idea
that geniuses produce disciples and
do not conform to the rules of any
particular existing discipline.
A genius creates a truly "interdis
ciplinary" moment, a "new object
which belongs to no one," Garber
said.
In the wake of discipline envy,
scholarly "aspirations [submit] to
regimented authority," Garber said.
A discussion with Garber will
take place this afternoon from 4 p.m.
to 6 p.m. in Building 460. room 426.
