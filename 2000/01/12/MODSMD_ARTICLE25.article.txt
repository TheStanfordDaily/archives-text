# New Tressider parking meters to accept credit cards, dollar bills by quarter's end
## 
### Eileen Chao Contributing writer 
Two new pay machines will be
added to the Tresidder parking lot at
the end of this quarter, taking away
the two-hour free parking that has
existed there since the lot was reno
vated.
TTie original parking meters were
removed at the beginning of the year
because the lot was being repaved
and relined.
The meters would not have lined
up with the new parking spaces, ac
cording to Parking and Transporta
tion Services Manager Greg Gleich
man.
The meters haven't been re
placed yet because Parking and

Transportation Services has had dif
ficulty in finding reliable machines.
"We already have one in the
Memorial Auditorium lot and the
Track House Lot," Gleichman said.
"But the one in the Memorial Audi
torium lot breaks down a lot and is
difficult to use. We will replace that
one along with adding the two in
Tresidder."
In addition to coins, the new me
ters will accept credit cards and bills.
Once paid, the machines will dis
pense a receipt that has the expira
tion time on it. Drivers then put this
receipt on the dashboard of their
cars.
"We decided to switch to these
pay machines for the convenience of
our customers," Gleichman said.

"Before, people who stayed more
than a few hours would have to put
in 20 quarters or something. With
the new machines, they could put in
five dollars or use their credit card."
There are also plans to put these
pay machines on Lomita Drive, in
front of the Cantor Arts Center.
"There, we have the same prob
lem," Gleichman said. "People who
want to visit the museum for the
whole day don't have enough
change."
One pay machine can cover 50 to
100 parking spaces, but the overall
cost is equivalent to the cost of hav
ing individual meters. Total, the ex
pense will be at least $20,000.
As of now, parking at Tresidder is
free for the first two hours. People

staying more than two hours can
purchase a visitor's scratcher permit
for $8 by the ticket office at Tresid
der.
Campus parking is also undergo
ing other changes. A parking lot on
Panama Drive, behind Roble Field,
is two weeks from completion. Over
the summer, lots were added at Jor
dan Quad and Lagunita Court, and
370 spaces were built in Escondido
Village to accompany the new grad
uate housing. Plans to add a parking
structure to the Stock Farm lot, near
the Stanford Golf Course, are un
derway for this summer.
The lot on Campus Drive East,
built for contractors working on the
new graduate housing, is only tern
porary.
