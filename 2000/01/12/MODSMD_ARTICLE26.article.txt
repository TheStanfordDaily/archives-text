# Transportation plans for Class of '04 developing
## 
### Eileen Chao Contributing writer 
This will be the last year fresh
men will be able to bring their cars
on campus, clue to a new regula
tion announced by administration
in April 1999. But the Task Force
on Frosh Transportation hopes to
quell nightmares about stranded
students and limited opportunities
for college life.
Formed last quarter, the task
force will consult with both stu
dents and faculty members to
come up with viable transporta
tion alternatives for incoming
freshmen.
The committee is comprised of
ASSU senators, two resident fel
lows, several faculty members and
representatives from Parking and
Transportation Services.
"We wanted to get the maxi
mum student input we could," said
Troy Gilbert, assistant to the vice
provost of Student Affairs. "The
ASSU prioritized this as one of its
most important issues, so we called
upon some ASSU senators [to
help us come up with ideas). It has
been a very productive group."
The task force has been dis
cussing several possible pilot pro
grams that would allow for student
transportation around the vicinity
of the Stanford campus. Already,
the task force did a survey on gen
eral student trip patterns at Stan
ford. The ASSU played a large
p<lrt in designing the surveys and
circulating them around campus.
l*"Not only arc we generating
ideas, but we're really collecting
information to help us figure out
the best programs for freshmen,"
spjd Susan Law, a representative
for Parking and Transportation
Services.
One proposed idea was a new
Marguerite route that would go to
Mountain View, the San Antonio

Shopping Center, Menlo Park's
Safeway and other shopping are
nas.
"We're thinking of calling it the
'Shopping Express,'" Law said.
"Kind of like the 'Midnight Ex
press,' but it would take students
to stores such as Target, Wal-Mart,
Sears and would run during the
day on weekends."
Other proposals include ob
taining rental cars for students,
buses and vans for transportation
to dorm activities and working
with delivery services Webvan or
Peapod, maybe even for discount
ed prices.
"We definitely don't want the
freshmen to be stranded on cam
pus," Law said. "We want to give
them the chance to leave campus
regularly, to do things like errands
or to go to movies or to eat out."
However, ideas for getting to
movies seem to be at a shortage.
"They could easily go to the
downtown movie theaters, but ide
ally people would be able to get to
the | AMCJ Mercado," said senior
Steven Aronowitz, chairman of
the Undergraduate Senate and co
chair of the task force. "We
haven't come up with an idea for
that yet."
Besides providing alternative
transportation, the task force
hopes to save funds for on-campus
freshman activities.
"We want to set aside money to
promote frosh events such as par
ties or dances — things that would
make them feel less 'stuck' on
campus," Aronowitz said.
According to ASSU Senator
Dan Liu, a senior, these ideas are
"being actively explored by ad
ministration," but are in no way
guaranteed to happen. Liu be
lieves that student support is a key
factor in obtaining the success
hoped for by the committee.
"Students really need to push for
these initiatives and say they're nec
essary." Liu said. "Administration
definitely is in good faith, but I know
it'll be easier to implement these
ideas if there was active student sup
port for it."
The task force's goal is to have its
program in place starting next quar
ter, so it can be tested before the
new freshmen arrive. Law said they
want to make sure everything works
out so they'll be able to have a full
program ready in the fall.
"Inevitably there will be some

glitches and inconveniences, but
hopefully it will ... make up for
some of the transportation vacuum
that will happen next year,'* Liu said.
The new program will be open to
all students, so the task force hopes
to benefit everyone on campus.
However, its main goal is to provide
future motorless freshmen with
more convenience.
"I still think it would be optimal
for the frosh to have their own cars,"
Aronowitz said. "But the decision
was made in April, and given this
decision, the administration has
been willing to spend a lot of money
and time on this matter. They are
definitely trying to make it better
and less burdensome, which is
good."
