### Walter Shen 
Given the CHOICE, more dis
advantaged high school students
are looking at college.
CHOICE, which stands for Col
lege and Health Options: Ideas
Creating Excellence, is a new stu
dent-run program at Stanford that
aims to inform disadvantaged high
school students about post-gradua
tion options, particularly those
leading into medicine.

Stanford junior Andrea Jackson,
a co-director of the program, said
the program's target audience is
low-income students, older stu
dents who attend alternative high
schools and students who have to
support their families.
"[We] focus on low-income
youth, hoping to motivate them,
and help prepare them for college,"
explained School of Education doc
toral student Va Lecia Adams, ex
ecutive director of the Stanford

Medical Youth Science Program,
CHOICE'S parent program.
The goal of CHOICE is to pre
sent these students with as many
options as possible and help them
make informed decisions about life
after high school, through a live
week series of workshops at local
high schools. Adams said.
She added that CI K )l( I volun
teers hope to serve as role models
for the students as well.
Stanford junior Chaumanix

Duiton. also a co-director, said that
the group is looking tor "anyone
who's interested [or) sensitive to
the needs of continuation students
[in alternative high schools].*'
Jackson adds that participation
in C HOICE is good for those who
want to gain teaching experience.
The program also counts as a
I luman Biology internship.
C I lOICE began last year as the
brainchild of Jackson, as a result of
her involvement in the youth sci
ence program.
In the science program, 23 disad
vantaged high school students are
selected from a pool of more than
350 applicants to spend the summer
at Stanford learning the basic sci
ences such as human anatomy, or
ganic chemistry, microbiology and
physiology.
Seeing that many of the appli
cants every year were well quali
fied. but could not be accepted due
to the limited size of the program.
Jackson proposed a program for

local students who could not partic
ipate. , ,
Last year. CHOICE focused on
local area schools such as Woodside
High School. However, this year
CHOICE is focusing mostly on al
ternative schools such as Redwood,
High School and Alta Vista High
School.
CHOICE is funded by the Stan
ford Medical School's Center of Ex,-
cellence, various foundations ancj
private donors. Faculty involved ip,
CHOICE include Marilyn Winkle
by. the founder of the youth science
program and a senior research sci
entist at the Medical School.
