# Chess team takes third-place at Pan-Ams
## 
### Chris Crowell 
From Dec. 26 to 29, while most
were enjoying a well-earned winter
break rest, four Stanford students
were hard at work. The Chess Team
travelled to Toronto, Canada, to at
tend the Pan-American Intercolle
giate Chess Championship and re
turned with an impressive third-place
finish.
"Maryland and the University of
Texas at Dallas beat us, but both
those schools recruit players and
offer full scholarships," explained
freshman Philip Wang. Wang is one
of the top three national champions
in the country in his age group and
has won five national titles.
The competition was indeed in
tense. More than 35 schools attended
the event, some from as far away as
Peru and Argentina. Each team is a
group of four, but many brought
along alternates to ease the mental
strain on each player. The Stanford
delegation had no such advantage.
"We were all playing two games a
day, which often meant up to twelve
hours of chess in one sitting," said
Eton llfeld, a sophomore. "As team
captain. I was impressed with our sta
mina and our ability to play as a team
when it really mattered."

llfeld singled out David Pecora, a
first-year Computer Science masters
student, as an example of the team's
calm-under-pressure attitude. Peco
ra won five out of six games, one of

which was crucial to secure Stan
ford's third-place finish.
So how did the players deal with
the tournament's stress? llfeld noted
that while tournaments are fun. the

club's main purpose is recreational.
To that end, the club invites anyone,
regardless of ability, to attend meet
ings on Mondays at 7:30 p.m. in
Building 550.
