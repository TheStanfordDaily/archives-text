### Marisa Pavlik Staff writer 
In the first Undergraduate Sen
ate meeting of winter quarter last
night, ASSU President Mike Levin,
a junior, announced that "the Stan
ford After Midnight program is
now in full effect."
"We've got over a dozen partici
pating vendors and already hun
dreds of students have taken ad
vantage of the extended hours," he
said.
Also, the Undergraduate Senate
approved more than $15,000 in
funding for six student groups, the
largest amount yet this year.

"I'm really happy to see us give
that much money out to student
groups that are doing good things,"
said Undergraduate Senate Chair
Steven Aronowitz, a senior.
"That's an important responsibility
of the ASSU to distribute fees that
will enhance the Stanford experi
ence."
The groups that recieved funding
include the newly formed SALSA!,
the Caribbean Students Associa
tion. the Stanford Ethiopian Stu
dent Union, East House, Henry's
Place and Sisters in Stanford.
"Last quarter we made student
space into an issue, found solutions
to the ban on freshman cars and

connected students to the ASSU.
This quarter, I know we can do
even more," Aronowitz said.
The Senate also continued its ef
forts to turn the old Roble Dining
Hall into a performing arts space. A
group of Roble residents, staff and
members of the performing arts
community will further investigate
the possibility in a meeting next
Tuesday at 7 p.m. in the old Roble
Dining Hall.
"The need for increased perfor
mance space is well documented."
said Aronowitz. "We think it can be
done in a way that makes Roble an
even better place to live. This
would be an incredible win-win."

He predicts this quarter "weil
going to see concrete gains in stu
dent space, including hopefully tfiÂ«>
Roble theatre, and see a lot of et*>
thusiasm for the new
tion program." he said.
The Task Fprce on Freshman
Transportation includes the possi
bility of a Stanford-only car-rental
program.
"With the Stanford After Mid-'
night program and many other ini-'
tiatives. last quarter was an excel-'
lent one for the ASSU. We are
hopeful that we can do an even bet
ter job of representing student con
cerns and improving student life
this quarter." Levin said.
