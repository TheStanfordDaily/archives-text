# Endowment returns surge
## 
### Meredith Rowe Editorial staff 
Recovering from the summer
1998 Asian financial crisis, the re
turn on the University's endow
ment for the fiscal year ending in
August skyrocketed to 36.3 percent
from the 1997-98 level of 1.3 per
cent.
The large increase, which will be
detailed in a report released by the
Stanford Management Company in
February, can be attributed to
growth stocks, according to Lau
rance Hoagland, CEO of the Stan
ford Management Company.
"We happened to have an enor
mous rise in the past year by tech
nology and Internet stocks," he
said. "That's what really drove the
strong return. The end of the Asian
financial crisis was a good starting
point for the past fiscal year."
The Stanford Management
Company, established in 1991,
manages the University's $6.2-bil
lion endowment. The endowment
contributes 5.25 percent of its value
in interest each vear to the Univer

sity's budget, with the rest of the re
turn left to grow the endowment.
Assets are divided into several
investment areas, ineluding 30 per
cent in domestic stocks, 23 percent
in international stocks and 18 per
cent in alternative investments.
The University's venture capital
partnerships, held in alternative in
vestments. had a return of 232 per
cent for the fiscal year, according to
the upcoming report.
These venture capital invest
ments have boosted the Universi
ty's return past the returns of other
schools, Hoagland said.
"For the three years ending last
Sept. 30, it would appear that Stan
ford's return is a little better than
Harvard's, Yale's or Princeton's,"
he said. "Our position in the Silicon
Valley has helped us to get access to
the best growth companies."
Alumni donations were also a
factor in the growing endowment,
he added.
"Contributions have certainly
been helpful." he said. "They're
also running very strong in the cur
rent fiscal vear."

Also, despite the concerns of
some, fluctuations in the stock mar
ket over the past month will proba
bly not have a noticeable impact on
the University's endowment or the
annual budget, according to
Hoagland.
Hoagland said the Stanford
Management Company uses "three
lines of defense" to protect the en
dowment in times of volatility, in
cluding strategic allocation of
stocks in different markets, a wide
ly diversified portfolio and a finan
cial reserve placed in the budget by
the provost.
These strategies all help to even
out the effects of market fluctua
tions over time, he said.
"For the budget to feel the im
pact of a stock market decline, it
would take three years or more."
"We don't try to outguess the
market," Hoagland added. "We
leave the strategic allocations in
place."
Financial market analysts have
also predicted that technology
stocks will continue to boost the
market.
"Because of technology, I think
we'll see growth for the next five to
six years," said Charles V. Payne,
founder and CEO of Wall Street
Strategies, in a chat hosted by Busi
ness Week Online on America On

line on Jan. 6.
Hoagland, who will be stepping
down from his position this year,
said his successor should "keep in
mind that the investment environ
ment can change at any time."
"It has been an extremely favor
able investment environment for
the past 18 years," he said. "This
may change, but we'd like to think
we have some pretty sound policies
in place."
