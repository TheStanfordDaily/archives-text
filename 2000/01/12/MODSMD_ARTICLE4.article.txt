# Stanford hit by flu season, but numbers low in comparison to nation-wide trend

The llu that is hitting, many parts
cit the nation partieulary hard this
winter has made its way to the Stan
lord campus.
The Center for Disease Control
says flu cases have been reported in
49 states, with widespread out
breaks in 35.
In fact, many U.S. and British
hospitals have had to cancel surg
eries in order to take care of flu pa
tients.
Although many other parts of
the country are experiencing a par
ticularly nasty flu season, members
of the Stanford community aren't
being affected in any greater num
bers than usual, according to Dr.
Robyn Tepper, Chief of Medical
Services at Cowell Student Health
Service.
"It's very busy here, but no
busier than usual for flu season."
Tepper explained. "At this time
last year, the numbers were actual
ly very similar. [Higher flu inci
dences! are typical after students
return from break where they were
exposed to different bugs on air
planes and at home."
Symptoms of the influenza virus
appear rapidly.
According to a Cowell pam
phlet. in only a matter of hours a
student can go from feeling perfect
ly normal to having fevers of 101
degrees or higher, body aches and
sometimes a dry cough or mild sore
throat.

Master's student Henry Smyth,
who has had the flu since New
Year's Day, said. "I feel extremely
weak and just have that awful blah'
feeling."
Flu symptoms are much differ
ent than the runny nose, congestion
and sore throat that accompany the
common cold, a virus many people
often confuse with the flu.
"Unlike colds, if someone fits

the criteria of influenza A or B,
there are a couple of medicines
available to lessen the duration of
the virus." said Tepper.
These medicines include Aman
tadine and Rimantadine, which
treat influenza A. and two newer
drugs. Relenza and Tamiflu, which
treat both influenza A and B.
These newer drugs are much
higher priced, often costing $64 per

dosage.
Most insurance companies
won't cover the cost, either. But the
good news is that these newer,
more expensive drugs that cover
both strains of the flu are often un
necessary since most cases of the
flu that Cowell sees are influenza
A.

The flu season has hit early and hard nationwide, but Stanford has seen no unusual rise in the number of
flu cases on campus.
