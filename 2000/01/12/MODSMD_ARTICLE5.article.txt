could captivate the audience and invigorate the
young people about the civil rights efforts being

Schwerncr, Goodwin and Chancy disappeared
on their trip. Forty-four days later, their bodies
were found.
"The summer of 1964 was the last time I was to
see this earth," Jones said. "I was supposed to have
been the fourth one."
"Their murders scared me, but that incident has
made me the strong person that I am." Jones said
"I will never forget that."
Jones didn't let the murders impede his ac

tivism. I le went on to integrate the Meridian pub
lic school system with the help of his brother. Jones

ment his father's involvement in the
Civil Rights Movement.
"When I read about the Civil
Rights movement or read informa
tion for my thesis, it's not foreign or

abstract to me because I have a per
sonal connection with it," Jones said.
"It's important that my genera
tion not forget that the gains made
then will be less valuable if we don't
go back and do something for our
communities."
