## Doctors rule General Pinochet unfit to stand trial 
### 
LONDON (AP) — Doctors ruled that
Gen. Augusto Pinochet was unfit to
stand trial, the government announced
Tuesday, opening the possibility that the
former Chilean dictator could win his
battle against extradition to Spain.
The Home Office said a medical team
who examined Pinochct on Jan. 5 unani
mously agreed that he was too ill to face
trial for alleged human rights abuses,
"and that no change to that position can
be expected."
The statement also said Home Secre
tary Jack Straw felt he should not allow
Pinochet's extradition until hearing argu
ments from parties to the case.
The statement did not immediately
make available details on why he was
considered unfit. But The Sunday limes
reported in London last weekend that
the doctors had found Pinochet was suf
fering from a viral infection, diabetes,
heart disease and the effects of two mild
strokes. His diabetes reportedly has
caused a loss of sensation in his hands
and feet.
The decision could lead to Pinochet's
release on humanitarian grounds, halt
ing efforts to try him in connection with
the disappearances and killings of thou
sands of Chileans during his 17-year rule
there.
The statement read that Straw "is
minded ... to take the view that no pur
pose would be served by continuing the
present extradition proceedings and that
he should therefore decide not to extra
dite."
The statement also said Straw would
hear arguments from Spain and other
parties to the case before making final
decision.

Human rights groups including
Amnesty International and Human
Rights Watch also have been invited to
submit comment.
The news was greeted with protest
and support in Chile.
Officials with the Organization of Rel
ative* of Missing Detainees, a group ded
icated to dissidents who disappeared
alter being arrested under the Pinochet
dictatorship, said they were disappointed.

This is a tremendous frustration
and sorrow. A wonderful legal
process has been frustrated.'
— Mireya Garcia

"This is a tremendous frustration and
sorrow. A wonderful legal process has
been frustrated." said Mireya Garcia,
vice president of the organization. "We
believe that although Pinochet is indeed
very old and has problems, he was in
shape to stand trial."
Retired army Gen. Rafael Villarroel.
a close aide to Pinochet, said, "this is
going to be good for Chile, for our father
kind. because a process starts to restore
its sovereignty and dignity."
Congressman Alberto Cardemil. also
a close associate of Pinochet, called the
British decision "a victory for a national
cause, a cause of the country."
There was no immediate reaction
from interested groups in Spain, where it
was near midnight when the announce
ment was made.
The 84-year-old Pinochet has been
under detention in Britain since his arrest
in a London hospital nearly 15 months

ago. He was arrested on a Spanish war
rant for alleged human rights violations
committed during his rule in Chile. ,
Last week's medical exam was doije at
the Chilean government's request. Tne
general was seen by a neurologist jand
two geriatric specialists during a seven
hour consultation at Northwick Park
Hospital in north London.
In its statement, the Home Office
the Chilean Embassy advised the govern*
ment on Oct. 14 that Pinochet's healtlj
had deteriorated.
According to an official report by the
civilian government that succeeded
Pinochet, 3,197 people, mainly
but also some Spaniards, were killed or
disappeared after he seized power in a
1973 coup.
Since his arrest, Pinochet has waged
an aggressive fight against being extradit
ed to Spain. «
His lawyers have already appealed a&
Oct. 8 ruling by a London magistrate thajt
he can be extradited. A hearing is sched
uled to begin March 20. *
Straw can consider Pinochet's health
in making a final ruling. But even if hi'
were to agree to release the general diit
to health concerns. Spain could appeal
that ruling, further prolonging the genef
al's stay in England. \
Pinochet also faces more than 50 indt
vidual lawsuits in Chilean courts, whioh
the government has said he should faceV
he returns. The government has nevur
pressed charges against him.
Former Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, one of Pinochet's mojt
forthright supporters, said Tuesday: *1
would trust the home secretary's judg
ment. 1 le is a verv fair man." ♦
