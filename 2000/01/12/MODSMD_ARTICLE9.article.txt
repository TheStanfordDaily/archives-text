# Virginia Tech case spawns debate over rape lawsuits in federal courts
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€”
Supreme Court justices appeared
to doubt whether Congress can try
to protect women against violence
by letting rape victims sue their
attackers in federal court.
Hearing arguments Tuesday in
the case of Christy Brzonkala, a
former Virginia Tech student who
wants to sue two football players
she says raped her, the justices
noted such issues are traditionally
left to state courts.
"Your approach ... would jus
tify a federal remedy for alimony
or child support," Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor told Solicitor Gen
eral Seth Waxman as he asked the
justices to reinstate a key portion
of the 1994 Violence Against
Women Act.
Julie Goldseheid, Brzonkala's
lawyer, argued along with Wax
man that the federal law, thrown
out by an appeals court, is needed
because gender-based violence
restricts women's choices in jobs
and travel.
Justice Antonin Scalia said all
types of crime could have similar
effects. Such logic "would allow
general federal criminal laws on all

subjects because all crime affects
interstate commerce," he said.
Michael E. Rosman. represent
ing the two former football play
ers, said the law encroaches on tra
ditional state powers and does not
come under Congress' authority to
regulate interstate commerce.
Allowing Congress to enact
such laws could "relegate the
states to a trivial and unimportant
role," Rosman said.
The nation's highest court has
increasingly tipped the balance of
power away from the federal gov
ernment and toward the states in a
series of 5-4 decisions, including a
ruling Tuesday that shielded state
governments against federal age
bias claims by their employees.
It seemed likely that the Vio
lence Against Women Act case
could follow the same pattern
when it is decided by this summer.
Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., the
law's author, said after the argu
ment session that the court should
show deference to Congress' con
clusion that states were not doing
enough to protect rape victims.
Waxman told the justices
Congress found that "archaic prej

udices and improper stereotypes"
about women were affecting the
outcome of cases instate courts.
The government's court brief con
tended violent crime against
women costs the nation at least $3
billion a year.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
formerly a pioneering women's
rights advocate, suggested that the
Violence Against Women Act
could be seen as an "alternative
remedy."
Congress could be saying, "We
aren't taking over the states'
domain. We are just complement
ing what the states do." Ginsburg
said. "Why isn't that satisfactory?"
But Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist questioned whether
people who sue their attackers
would fare any better in federal
court than instate court. Juries
generally are drawn from similar
pools of people, he said.
Thirty-six states are siding with
Brzonkala and are asking the
court to reinstate the federal law.
Rosman said Congress can use
its interstate-commerce authority
only to regulate activity related to
commercial transactions.
