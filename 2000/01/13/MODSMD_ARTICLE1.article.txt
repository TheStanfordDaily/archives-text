Cyberspace can be a scary place,
but on Monday, U.S. Attorney
General Janet Reno attended a
conference at Stanford geared to
ward issues of safety and crime on
the Internet.
The National Association of At
torneys General, together with the
Law School, hosted the confer
ence, which focused on how the In
ternet impacts the mission of attor
neys general.
Law School Dean Kathleen Sul
livan said, "We were greatly hon
ored to be able to sponsor such an
event." The conference included
19 state attorneys general, as well
as Reno.
The highlight of the conference
was Reno's speech, in which she
outlined plans and problems in
controlling the emerging problem
of "cyber crime."
Reno spoke of the importance
and difficulty of fighting "the dark
side of the Internet," referring to
security problems, hackers and
computer viruses.
She said she sees the problem as
a global one that requires global
cooperation.
"International borders don't
mean anything" to cyber criminals,
Reno said.
"When committed via the Inter
net. [someone] can transform a
local scam into a crime that circles

the globe."
The conference was particularly
timely, as it closely followed Presi
dent Bill Clinton's announcement
that the government will increase
spending on cyber security by 17
percent to $2 billion.
His plan includes training for
"cyber sleuths" to track down In
ternet criminals. However. Sulli
van said she sees problems inher
ent in the regulation of Internet ac
tivity.
Sullivan stressed the need for
officials to keep the "important
first principles of freedom of
speech and privacy firmly in mind
as we tackle new problems."
She added that officials should
look to benefits of new technology
in fighting cyber crime.
What people need, according to
Sullivan, is "not regulations, but
new ways to use technology to reap
the benefits and contain some of
the harm" of technology on the In
ternet.
The event, which attracted sev
eral hundred participants from the
field of law enforcement, was co
sponsored by the Law School's De
partment of Law, Science and
Technology.
According to Law School Direc
tor of Events Julia Erwin-Weiner.
Stanford chose to host the event
because the issues were "closely
aligned with the interests of the de
partment."
