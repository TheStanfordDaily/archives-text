### 
Apathy toward grape boy
cott demonstrates need for
new approach to the issue

With the results of the
grapes vote now out, it's
obvious that the overall
mood of students toward this issue is
-One of apathy.
The passion over this issue that
.once existed on this campus has
dwindled greatly since four students
held a hunger strike in 1994 to con
vince the University to act on it. Stu
dents don't have the same fervor
;ihat they did. In fact, even the Unit
ed Farm Workers aren't as passion
ate about the grapes boycott as they
Once were.
The efforts of the students in sup
port of a grapes boycott are com
mendable. However, with the
•change in times and mood there has
come a need fora change in
approach.
The issue at hand isn't grapes. The
issue is the treatment of field work
ers. That isn't something that begins
and ends with grapes; it's time to
stop treating it as such.
If the vote is to continue and be
truly meaningful, it must be
changed. A "grapes vote" doesn't
begin to describe the issue, and in
the real world, you can't expect stu
dents to just jump in and learn all
they can about the treatment of farm
workers.
I; The onus falls upon those who
Support the boycott to convince stu
dents to become involved. Forget
;grapes. They aren't as relevant as
Ithey used to be.
Those students passionate about
•Supporting the boycott and the
;issues it encompasses must strive to

better communicate their ideas to
the entire student body.
An effective way to do this could
be by holding an awareness week.
During this week, advocates for bet
tering the treatment of field workers
could organize speakers to hold dis
cussions at various dorms and hous
es. I lolding them during house meet
ings or during dinner would ensure
that a vast majority of the student
body is being reached.
If activists still feel the need to
culminate their efforts in a vote, per
haps an election held at the end of
the week on whether to ban inorgan
ic produce could be held.
One concern brought up by those
who support the boycott is that the
use of pesticides in the fields can
lead to health risks for laborers. The
organic / inorganic debate addresses
this directly. It isn't the sole issue,
but it's a start, and a relevant one at
that.
Also, more work must be done to
publicize the issue,
strong efforts were made to create a
dialogue on this year's vote, they
relied too much on student motiva
tion.
Activists for this issue must be
more aggressive. The climate we live
in isn't exactly radical when com
pared to that of earlier eras. If you
want people to react, you have to try
harder.
Students seeking to better the
conditions for workers in the fields
can take pride in their efforts to bet
ter the lives of others. It's a compas
sion and a dedication that, unfortu
nately, not everyone has.
The old approach isn't working
anymore. It's time to stop and think
of new ideas. Hopefully, we can
develop something meaningful.
