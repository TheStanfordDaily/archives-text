Missing the Co Ho of yore
• lam writing in response to Mike Rosen-
Huth's column, "Coffee House, where have
you gone?" that ran in Tuesday's Daily.
1 too miss the slightly-dirty-yet-definitely
eomfortable atmosphere of the old Coffee
House. In an attempt to rejuvenate my
beloved old tradition of hanging out at the
Co Ho, I went there the morning of their
reopening to have a mocha and do a bit of
reading, and this is what I found.
First of all, the mocha was repulsive. Even
though it was delivered much more speedily

than a similar order at the ()ld (\> Ito would
have been, I would rather they had spent that
extra time actually mixing my beverage for
me. The last few sips were chocolate sludge
that made me gag even more strongly than
that barren new yellow and purple look
they're cultivating.
Though discouraged after my first try. I
decided to return this week to give it another
chance (once a Co Ho rat, always a Co Ho
rat). Deftly avoiding the deadly mocha con
coction that nearly sent me to Cowell last
week, I ordered a simple cup of hot tea. Now,

tea usually costs about 50 cents because all
you get is hot water and a little tea bag, but
the Co Ho's tea now costs $1.45 ($1.57 with
tax). I soon found out why.
The tea they serve is very fancy designer
tea. The tea bag is cloth stitched into a pouch,
and the cup arrives covered with a plastic
contraption designed to house the tea bag
when you are done with your brewing. When
I showed it to one of my friends, she offered
me a free, normal tea bag from her backpack
and asked if mine was made out of silk. I
wasn't sure.

The tea itself was tasty, and they even
gave me a second cup of hot water for free,
but I still missed the old Co Ho feeling. I do
have one solution to their un-lived-in feeling,
though; I have some "bad student art" like
Mike suggested to liven up the atmosphere. I
would love to exhibit my photography pro
ject, "Developing the Designer's I," on their
new, fluorescently lit walls — that is, if they'll
let me spoil their sterile yellow and purple
theme.
