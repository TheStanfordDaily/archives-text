# Meaning in the macro
## Sasha Polonsky Tapping into the college keg 
### 
I feel like I'm regressing
into prudism in my old
age. Finally a senior. 1
find myself joking with
friends about how we
vaguely remember going
to parties back in the day
when binge drinking was

the name of the weekend.
At the risk of sounding like a has-been
past her party-going peak, 1 have to admit
that college alcohol trends concern me a bit.
I realize that this comment may appear
laced with hypocrisy in light of my many
alcohol binges from parties past, but only
recently have I come to consider the very
reality of overdoing it.
I have no message by way of underage
drinking, nor do 1 wish to convey any sense
of holier-than-thou abstentionism from
having a few drinks. 1 suppose my hope is
simply to generate some reflection on why
our dependence on alcohol has grown to be
a necessity — perhaps even a fifth food
group in many cases. This is not at all a
political column.
Binge drinking is defined as something
like four or five drinks fora girl, maybe six
or seven fora guy. Give me a break, I told
my mother when she reported the stats to
me during my freshman year. That's noth
ing. I do that every Thursday night.
But think about it. Yes, 1 like margaritas.
And after some time in Japan, I do like the
taste of beer. But when do you ever sit
down at a restaurant and order six Cokes?
You'd probably face a good deal of ridicule
if you did. Endless comments about repeat
ed trips to the bathroom would be inter
spersed with cuts about storing up for hiber
nation. This is not a logical thing to do.
And vet, when it comes to parties and
beer, we do it time and time again — after
we're photographed passed out with our
pants off sitting on the toilet, after we wake
up beside someone we've never met before,

after wc break an arm from falling down the
stairs in a drunken leap to try to fly. And
we're talking Natty-light here. A broken
arm for beer that tastes no better than toilet
water.
I never fully questioned this behavior
before this year. I thought it was funny
when people couldn't speak clearly or walk
without assistance, and 1 got a rush out of
losing my sense of rationale and feeling no
consequences. Along with my friends, 1 felt
I deserved to get wasted after a big exam,
after a hard week or just for the sake of get
ting trashed.
What is it that is so great about that
rush? It suddenly occurred to me to won
der. You feel it first in the "social zone," as
termed by Ralph Castro at Cowell. This is
the marker period where you feel like you
own the party, before you plummet into the
sloppy zone, the loss of inhibitions, the loss
wf-conlrol zone. s
It seems logical that one trip beyond the
social zone and into the world of vomiting
and piercing next-day hangovers would be a
red Hag that drunkenness is not all that.
It seems only natural that two recent
alcohol-related deaths at MIT and countless
others where people have fallen from third
story windows or crashed their cars on the
trip home would be some kind of wakeup
call for us college students. Our peers are
dying because they can't responsibly handle
alcohol, and we continue with the same old
shot-gunning and keg stands.
Which is not to say we should stop. I am
hardly advocating a dry environment, and I
am hardly saying there is anything wrong
with parties.
1 have heard the arguments about alco
hol acting as a remedy for an activity dearth,
which may be a contributing factor on this
campus. A lot of people argue that other
social options might lure us away from the
kegs and mixers. And that may be.
But the fact remains that we spend very

little time effectively addressing the prob
lem. The way 1 see it, alcohol awareness is
dealt with in such a way that students are
fairly universally made to feel subordinate
and accused. We hate talking about the
issues with administrators and parents, who
see college drinking as a travesty and some
thing that needs to be immediately curtailed
or eradicated.
In essence, we like drinking. We like how
it makes us feel, and we resent the fact that
it is popularized as debaucherous and in
most cases dangerous. Drinks in responsible
amounts can be really great.
When a dorm does a program on alcohol
awareness, people groan and often don't
show up. At the age of 18 or older, they
don't want to be lectured, and they don't
want corrective advice. Regardless of the
program's intentions, this is what they
expect.'
So I am proposing that we in this catego
ry at least take a chance to articulate what is
so great about drinking. My new idea has
been trying to list reasons beforehand for
why 1 feel the need to get drunk. If I can
make a convincing argument, I'll go ahead
and get hammered and suffer the conse
quences in the morning.
But sometimes I just can't get beyond, "I
really want to get drunk." Think about it.
I'm asking why. I'm just curious as to where
a little introspection gets us.
So go ahead and keep bingeing if it's
doing something productive for you. But if
you are content to stay in the social zone for
a while and consider whether two drinks
could suffice for once instead of eight, I
really recommend it. I've discovered that
the social zone is a great place.

alcohol, and we continue with the same old
shot-gunning and keg stands.
Which is not to say we should stop. I am
hardly advocating a dry environment, and I
am hardly saying there is anything wrong
with parties.
1 have heard the arguments about alco
hol acting as a remedy for an activity dearth,
which may be a contributing factor on this
campus. A lot of people argue that other
social options might lure us away from the
kegs and mixers. And that may be.
But the fact remains that we spend very

little time effectively addressing the prob
lem. The way 1 see it, alcohol awareness is
dealt with in such a way that students are
fairly universally made to feel subordinate
and accused. We hate talking about the
issues with administrators and parents, who
see college drinking as a travesty and some
thing that needs to be immediately curtailed
or eradicated.
In essence, we like drinking. We like how
it makes us feel, and we resent the fact that
it is popularized as debaucherous and in
most cases dangerous. Drinks in responsible
amounts can be really great.
When a dorm does a program on alcohol
awareness, people groan and often don't
show up. At the age of 18 or older, they
don't want to be lectured, and they don't
want corrective advice. Regardless of the
program's intentions, this is what they
expect.'
So I am proposing that we in this catego
ry at least take a chance to articulate what is
so great about drinking. My new idea has
been trying to list reasons beforehand for
why 1 feel the need to get drunk. If I can
make a convincing argument, I'll go ahead
and get hammered and suffer the conse
quences in the morning.
But sometimes I just can't get beyond, "I
really want to get drunk." Think about it.
I'm asking why. I'm just curious as to where
a little introspection gets us.
So go ahead and keep bingeing if it's
doing something productive for you. But if
you are content to stay in the social zone for
a while and consider whether two drinks
could suffice for once instead of eight, I
really recommend it. I've discovered that
the social zone is a great place.
