and picked up second team All-Mis
sion League honors. The following
season. Toppel earned first team
honors and for his junior and senior
seasons, was named MVP of his team
and league, as well as Loyola Athlete
of the Year in 1999.
"Curt stood out at a very early
age." Nieves said."lt was pretty clear
he'd be a top recruit by his senior
year. 1 saw him play the summer be
tween his freshman and sophomore
years. He was already tall and had
good coordination fora ninth-grad
er."
When Toppel wasn't helping his
high school team reach its four con
secutive League Championships, he
was busy playing for his I.os Angeles
Athletic Club team with fellow Car
dinal freshman teammate Billy
Strickland.
The Under-16 team snagged the
Junior Olympic silver medal in 1996,
which was followed by gold in 1997,
when Toppel was named National
MVP. I.ast year with the Under-IS
squad. Toppel led the team to a sec
ond Junior Olympic championship
and he received All-Tournament
Team honors.
"He used to cry on the play
ground." Strickland said, remember
ing their elementary school days.
"Now he's very mentally tough, he
doesn't get shaken easily, lie's a
great athlete."
Toppel had to grow up fast in
order to play with older players on
the Junior National Travel Team
that he joined the summer after his
sophomore year. In three years. Top
pel traveled to Italy. Guatemala and
Argentina, playing as a starter for the
squad gaining international experi
ence in KS matches.
I.ast summer's trip to Argentina
with fellow Cardinal teammate,
sophomore Marcus Skacel, was an
undefeated effort for the team, which
played the Argentinean Junior Na
tional team in eight different cities.
"With the international program I
played with all older guys so it made

me have to do my best," Toppel said.
"The higher level and playing with
college players helped me get adjust
ed to the college game."
"By the end of his junior year,
what separated him from others was
his physical maturity," Nieves said.
"He grew tall and grew into his hody
quickly. Often it takes other athletes
longer."
And it was because of his maturi
ty that come senior year the accom
plished and experienced Toppel was
atop most every recruiting list, but
for Toppel the choice was easy.
"I knew that academically Stan
ford was one of the best." Toppel
said. "It's great academically and ath
letically as well; it seemed like a per
fect match."
Toppel was sold on the Farm after
an unofficial recruiting visit during
his junior year.
"Stanford became the frontrun
ners at that point." Nieves said.
" Then it was just a matter of holding
off recruiting competition and it was
up to Curt to perform in the class
room. We got the job done from a re
cruiting standpoint and he got it done
from an academic standpoint."
So far Toppel seems to have
found in Stanford that perfect fit he
was looking for, as he's already made
his presence known on the court.
Preseason, Toppel boasted IS kills
and a .4(K) hitting percentage in the
team's three-game loss (15-11, 15-2,
15-8) to No. 7 UCLA.
At last week's UC-Santa Bar

nal with 19 kills in a hard-fought loss
to No. 4 Pepperdine (15-6, 15-12, 5-
15. 15-7).
"In the UCSB tournament Curt
had a good performance," Nieves
said. "It was a great start and with ex
perience in dealing with bigger
blockers and better defenders."
While there is little doubt that Top
pel will indeed develop into a more
complete player, Toppel is quick to
agree that he is not there yet.
"I hope to really gel with the team
and be a team player," he said.
"Hopefully I will play a good role on
the team and keep improving."

When Toppel wasn't helping his
high school team reach its four con
secutive League Championships, he
was busy playing for his I.os Angeles
Athletic Club team with fellow Car
dinal freshman teammate Billy
Strickland.
The Under-16 team snagged the
Junior Olympic silver medal in 1996,
which was followed by gold in 1997,
when Toppel was named National
MVP. I.ast year with the Under-IS
squad. Toppel led the team to a sec
ond Junior Olympic championship
and he received All-Tournament
Team honors.
"He used to cry on the play
ground." Strickland said, remember
ing their elementary school days.
"Now he's very mentally tough, he
doesn't get shaken easily, lie's a
great athlete."
Toppel had to grow up fast in
order to play with older players on
the Junior National Travel Team
that he joined the summer after his
sophomore year. In three years. Top
pel traveled to Italy. Guatemala and
Argentina, playing as a starter for the
squad gaining international experi
ence in KS matches.
I.ast summer's trip to Argentina
with fellow Cardinal teammate,
sophomore Marcus Skacel, was an
undefeated effort for the team, which
played the Argentinean Junior Na
tional team in eight different cities.
"With the international program I
played with all older guys so it made

me have to do my best," Toppel said.
"The higher level and playing with
college players helped me get adjust
ed to the college game."
"By the end of his junior year,
what separated him from others was
his physical maturity," Nieves said.
"He grew tall and grew into his hody
quickly. Often it takes other athletes
longer."
And it was because of his maturi
ty that come senior year the accom
plished and experienced Toppel was
atop most every recruiting list, but
for Toppel the choice was easy.
"I knew that academically Stan
ford was one of the best." Toppel
said. "It's great academically and ath
letically as well; it seemed like a per
fect match."
Toppel was sold on the Farm after
an unofficial recruiting visit during
his junior year.
"Stanford became the frontrun
ners at that point." Nieves said.
" Then it was just a matter of holding
off recruiting competition and it was
up to Curt to perform in the class
room. We got the job done from a re
cruiting standpoint and he got it done
from an academic standpoint."
So far Toppel seems to have
found in Stanford that perfect fit he
was looking for, as he's already made
his presence known on the court.
Preseason, Toppel boasted IS kills
and a .4(K) hitting percentage in the
team's three-game loss (15-11, 15-2,
15-8) to No. 7 UCLA.
At last week's UC-Santa Bar
bara/ Elephant Bar Collegiate Invi
tational. Toppel again led the Cardi
nal with 19 kills in a hard-fought loss
to No. 4 Pepperdine (15-6, 15-12, 5-
15. 15-7).
"In the UCSB tournament Curt
had a good performance," Nieves
said. "It was a great start and with ex
perience in dealing with bigger
blockers and better defenders."
While there is little doubt that Top
pel will indeed develop into a more
complete player, Toppel is quick to
agree that he is not there yet.
"I hope to really gel with the team
and be a team player," he said.
"Hopefully I will play a good role on
the team and keep improving."
