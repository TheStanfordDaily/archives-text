### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Corvallis, Ore. Last march, Stan
ford was angling fora No. 1 seed in
the NCAA tournment when Oregon

State upset the Pacific 10 Conference
champions. 59-45, in the regular sea
son finale.
The No. 1 seed went toConneticut
the eventual national champion.
Stanford was given the No. 2 seed,

setting up an eventual loss to upstart
Gonzaga in only the second round of
the tournament.
With the season's end still two
months away, the outcome of third
ranked Stanford's game in Corvallis
tonight does not hold the same im
portance.

But if Stanford (12-1, 1-1 Pacific
10 Conference) finds itself thinking
too much about its loss to No. 2 Ari
zona at home last Saturday or if the
Cardinal is peeking ahead to Satur
day's showdown with an Oregon
team finally garnering some national
respect. Oregon State (8-4. 0-1) and
its rabid, long-suffering fans could
pose problems.
"I do not know so much about
'what happend' last year, " chuckled
head coach Mike Montgomery. "But.
we have to have a little bounce back
from the Kiss to Arizona."
Against the Wildcats. Stanford
shot an anemic 33 percent from the
field and only 24 percent from behind
the three-point arc. While the Ari
zona defense was instramental in
shutting down the Cardinal's in

side/outside attack, patience was also
a huge factor.
"We have to be more patient."
said Montgomery. "We have to take
better shots, and if we miss shots, the
solution is not to shoot it faster the
next time."
The Beavers offense is not exactly
wreaking havoc either. In the "Civil
War" against Oregon on Saturday at
Oregon State's Gill Colusium. the
Beavers scored less than 50 points.
Losing 67-45 in its Pac-10 opener..ac
tually. Oregon State looked quite
bad.
The Beavers are relatively deep,
rotating numerous players into the
frontcourt. However, the man who
runs the show, junior point guard
Deaundra Tanner, rarely leaves the
floor.
Tanner, a preseason all-confer
ence selection, averages more than 35
minutes a game. His 15.5 points per
game, second only to freshman phe
nom Brian Jackson's 16.7 points per
game, but his 4.8 assists lead the team
and his 4.2 rebounds ranks fourth.
Not bad fora 6-foot 2-inch point
guard.
Jasckson. one of the Beavers
biggest recruits in years, has recov
ered from an early season knee in
jury. After missing Oregon State's
first five games, he has scored in dou
ble figures in six of the last seven
games. I lis 32 points against Tex
as A&M Corpus Christi set a fresh
man record for the Beavers.
The biggest thing going for Ore
gon State is its cour — Beaver fans
pack Gill Coluism even when the
product on the floor leaves some
thing to be desired.
But if Stanford can shut out the
crowd, and regaiirHs'cbfhposiirc of
fensively, the Cardinal, which saw its
12-0 record and No. 1 ranking fall by
the wayside, should be able to start
work on its new winning streak.
