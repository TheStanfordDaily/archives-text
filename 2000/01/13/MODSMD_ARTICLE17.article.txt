# Ruggers ready to tame the Gaels
## 
### Jon Cohen Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's rugby team has had more
than nine months to ponder its agonizingly early
exit from the last year's Pacific Coast playoffs.
On Saturday, the squad's drive for redemption
will hit the home stretch when league play begins
against St. Mary's at New Maloney Field.
When they arrive in Palo Alto, the Gaels will
face a Stanford team riding a two-game winning
streak. 1 hnvever, last season, St. Mary's defeated
the Cardinal for first time in their last 10 meetings.
This past Saturday, the Cardinal trounced
Santa Clara 60-10 in what amounted to a tuneup

game. It followed that performance with a 25-10
road victory over a tough ( 'a I Poly-San I uis ()bis
po squad, in which a total of six Stanford players
were banged up.
Despite these two wins, head coach Franck
Boivert is far from satisfied with his squad's play
over the weekend.
"We beat two teams which were mediocre."
said Boivert."We'll have to play a lot better
against a physical St. Mary's team."
In particular, Boivert questioned the lack ol in
tensity he saw in some of his players in their first
two games, though he was encouraged enough by
practice this week to expect a hungrier Cardinal
team on Saturday.

While Boivcrt was disappointed in the play of
some of his returnees, he was quite impressed
with the energy and overall play of three new
comers. seniors Che' Holloway. Chuks Amajor
and Adam Yarnold.
Despite his coach's frustration, senior captain
Mike Ceballos thinks the team is headed in the
light direction.
"We're looking really good," said Ceballos. "
If we just clean up the ball control we'll be a real
exciting team."
Stanford's high hopes for this season are
based not only on its success Saturday and Sun-
day', but on its stellar play over the
fall Season.

reached the national semifinals.

biggest hurdle for the Cardinal, but

collegiate player in the country in

if we can contain him. we've got a

While the other teams in the
league lack the talent, depth and ex
perience of the Ciolden Bears, none
of the games will be a walk in the
park.
"Every league game is a grudge
