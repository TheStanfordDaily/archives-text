## 
### Kelsey Colvin Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's basket
ball team brings il back to the Farm
ihis weekend, battling Oregon
State tonight and No. 23 Oregon
Saturday.
Tonight's game marks the third
contest in the Cardinal's confer
ence season, and their first confer
ence game at home. The team is
currently 1-1 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference after losing to Arizona
State 74-68 on Jan. 6. then beating
No. 15 Arizona 98-95 the following
Saturday.
"Everyone knows it's a big
weekend for us." said head coach
Tata VanDerveer. "It's nice play
ing at home."
The Oregon State Beavers are
currently suffering a 14-game los
ing streak on the road, as well as a
nine-game Pac-10 losing streak.
The Cardinal is currently 4-1 at
home and 13-0 against OSU at
Maples Pavilion.
The Beavers have shown them
selves to be a consistent presence
on the boards. They lead the Pac
-10 in rebounding with an average
of nearly 42 per game and have out
rebounded their opponents in nine
of their last 13 games.
OSU also leads the conference
in offensive rebounds with an aver
age of 18.3 per game. By contrast.

the Cardinal has been averaging
around 37.8 rebounds a game.
The Beavers might also prove to
be a challenge defensively. They
average 9.8 steals and force 20.5
turnovers a game. They have held
their opponents to a 40.2 shooting
percentage from the field.
The Cardinal also mightbe hin
dered offensively by the uncertain
health of freshman guard Jamey
Carey. Carey has been playing the
last couple weeks on a sprained
ankle, but VanDerveer is unsure
whether she will be able to play in
tonight's game.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Tonight: Stanford (4-4, 1-1 Pacific
10 Conference) vs. Oregon State (4-
9,0-1). 7:30 p.m.. Maples Pavilion.

Carey is part of the dynamic duo
of Stanford's backcourt, which in
cludes senior guard Milena I lores.
Carey has taken a lot of the ball
handling pressure from Flores. and
is second in the conference in
three-point shooting percentage at
.435. She closely trails teammate
sophomore guard Lauren St. Clair,
who leads the Pac-10 at .436.
But Stanford is not a team de
pendant upon its individual players
and VanDerveer is not concerned
about the Cardinal's offense.
"Our offense has not been a
problem." said VanDerveer. "We

have a lot of offensive weapons."
Beavers head coach Judy Spoel
stra seems equally concerned
about the Stanford offense.
"They are getting a lot of bal
anced scoring and it seems like any
given day any one of a number of
players can hurt you," Spoelstra
said in an OSU press release. "You
have to really do a good job defen
sively and cover everyone and not
let anyone have a big game,"
"At the same time, we need to
go down there and be able to score
against them," Spoelstra contin
ued. "Our defense and rebounding
can hold their own. but it is our of
fense that we need to work on and
find that third or fourth consistent
scorer."
Hopefully Stanford won't give
OSU's offense much of a chance to
discover potential scorers.
Although VanDerveer ex
pressed discontent with the Stan
ford defense after the loss to Ari
zona State, she suggested that de
fense had become a primary focus
of the Cardinal's practice.
"We've been working a lot
harder on our defense." Van-
Derveer said.
Saturday's game against the
Oregon Ducks will give Stanford
another great chance to prove
themselves with an upset.
The Ducks tied UCLA for the
Pac-10 regular season title last vear

and made it to the second round of
the NCAA Tournament. I hey arc
10-3 for the season and have only
played one conference game, a 68-
51 win against OSU.
The team plays California on
Thursday and then laces Stanford
on the Farm Saturday for its 10th
straight game away from home.
Oregon is a strong defensive
team and leads the conference in
points generated from its defense.
They have defeated three teams
this season by more than 30 points
and have held their opponents to
an average field-goal percentage of
37.1.
I lie Ducks are led in scoring by
sophomore Shaquala Williams.
Williams was named Pac-10
Freshman of the Year last season
and is currently second in scoring in
the conference with an average of
17.9 points per game.
The Ducks have the second
highest record and are ranked
fourth in the conference.
VanDerveer said that although
Oregon is strong, assumptions can
not be made about their level of
plav relative to Stanford's.
"It's so early in the season [that |
everything is open," VanDerveer
said. "We're going to have to play
really well."
With strong Cardinal offensive
play and tenacious defense. Stan
ford has all the tools to win.

can hold their own. but it is our of
fense that we need to work on and
find that third or fourth consistent
scorer."
Hopefully Stanford won't give
OSU's offense much of a chance to
discover potential scorers.
Although VanDerveer ex
pressed discontent with the Stan
ford defense after the loss to Ari
zona State, she suggested that de
fense had become a primary focus
of the Cardinal's practice.
"We've been working a lot
harder on our defense." Van-
Derveer said.
Saturday's game against the
Oregon Ducks will give Stanford
another great chance to prove
themselves with an upset.
The Ducks tied UCLA for the
Pac-10 regular season title last vear

and made it to the second round of
the NCAA Tournament. I hey arc
10-3 for the season and have only
played one conference game, a 68-
51 win against OSU.
The team plays California on
Thursday and then laces Stanford
on the Farm Saturday for its 10th
straight game away from home.
Oregon is a strong defensive
team and leads the conference in
points generated from its defense.
They have defeated three teams
this season by more than 30 points
and have held their opponents to
an average field-goal percentage of
37.1.
I lie Ducks are led in scoring by
sophomore Shaquala Williams.
Williams was named Pac-10
Freshman of the Year last season
and is currently second in scoring in
the conference with an average of
17.9 points per game.
The Ducks have the second
highest record and are ranked
fourth in the conference.
VanDerveer said that although
Oregon is strong, assumptions can
not be made about their level of
plav relative to Stanford's.
"It's so early in the season [that |
everything is open," VanDerveer
said. "We're going to have to play
really well."
With strong Cardinal offensive
play and tenacious defense. Stan
ford has all the tools to win.

Sophomore Bethany Donaphin applies tough defense in a matchup
with the women's national team. Unfortunately, Stanford freshman
Jamey Carey might not be able to play as the Cardinal looks to grab
its second win in the Pac-10 against struggling Oregon State.
