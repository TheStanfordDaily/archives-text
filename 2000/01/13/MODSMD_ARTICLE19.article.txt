# Top UN leader talks nuclear disarmament

### Greg Page Contributing writer 
Jayantha Dhanapala, the United
Nations Under-Secretary-General
for Disarmament Affairs, spoke to
a crowded room of 150 last night in
Encina Hall as part of a lecture se
ries titled "Ethics and Global Chal
lenges of the New Millennium."
Advocating "a progressive re
duction in the stock of nuclear
weapons, leading to eventual total
elimination of such weapons,"
Dhanapala spoke of recent gains
and setbacks in the quest for nu
clear disarmament, and outlined
disarmament goals for the future.
Dhanapala cited recent progress
in the global disarmament agenda.
For instance, he said, "there has
been a consistent downward trend
(in total numbers of nuclear

weapons] since the height of the
Cold War. Also, the Comprehen
sive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty has
been signed by 155 countries, 51 of
whom have ratified (the Treaty]."
As for recent setbacks,
pala mentioned the nuclear tests
carried out by India and Pakistan in
May 1998. He remained optimistic,
however, saying, "In my prediction,
it is a matter of time before India
and Pakistan sign the Comprehen
sive Test Ban Treaty."
He also expressed frustration
that Cuba and Israel had not signed
the treaty and lamented the lack of
an international nuclear weapon
index.
Dhanapala stressed the need for
a uniform, harsh response to nu
clear tests, criticizing the current
standard response, "a customary,
ephemeral statement expressing re

gret.
He cautioned against the ten
dency to identify certain nations as
"rogue states," calling such labeling
a "troubling development." He
pressed for unity and respect, cast
ing off the idea espoused by some
political commentators that "if we
disarm the rogues, all will be well."
During a question-and-answer
session following his speech,
Dhanapala was asked if the threat
of nuclear warfare has prevented,
and can continue to prevent, the
clash of world superpowers.
Though he did not completely
reject this notion, he said. "A world
without nuclear weapons would be
a much safer place than a world
with nuclear weapons as they are
now."
Stephen Stedman, senior re
search scholar at the Center for In

ternational Security and Coopera
tion and organizer of the lecture se
ries, touted Dhanapala as an exem
plary diplomat. "As Under-Secre
tary-General for Disarmament Af
fairs, he has carried out innovative
initiatives in non-proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction, the
control of light weapons and exten
sion of the global land mine ban,"
he said.
Political Science Prof. Scott
Sagan also applauded Dhanapala's
accomplishments. "I think [Dhana
pala is | a real global resource, both
because he's one of the world's spe
cialists on non-proliferation and he
has enormous diplomatic skill. In
as head of the negotiations to
review and extend the Non-Prolif
eration Treaty, he uniformly and
broadly built a consensus between
nuclear and non-nuclear states."
