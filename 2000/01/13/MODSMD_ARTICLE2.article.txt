# Dems turn to Biz School prof for fundraising
## 
### Ben Alexander-Bloch Contributing writer 
Last Tuesday the Democratic
National Committee announced
the appointment of Joel Hyatt, a
professor at the Graduate School
of Business, as one of three new
DNC finance chairs, in an effort to
boost the party's lagging fundrais
ing efforts for the 2(H)() elections.
Sunday's New York Times re
vealed that the party's funds fall far
short of their Republican competi
tors. In a presidential campaign
where advertising and sniear cam
paigns have dramatic effects on the
polls, some experts believe the De
mocrats' problems with fundraising
could cost them the election.
Hvatt is the co-author of "The

Long Boom," a respected analysis
of the new economy, and Business
Week named him one of the top 50
business leaders in the United
States.
"Hyatt is extremely bright and
personable, and he seems well-con
nected in Silicon Valley's new
wealth. He is a new style of entre
preneur with a strong social con
science," said Carl Wood, a mem
ber of the California Public Utili
ties Commission, where Hyatt
worked before his new appoint
ment.
The DNC appointed Hyatt
along with Carol Pensky, the
DNC's Women's Leadership
Forum founder, and Chicago attor
ney Joe Cari Jr.
"The stakes for the 2000 presi

dential elections are high, as the
president of the new millennium
will select five new Supreme Court
Justices and have a dramatic effect
on who controls Congress," said
DNC Deputy Press Secretary Rick
Hess.
The Democrats' fundraising
troubles stem partly from having to
cancel many fundraising events.
To raise money, the party holds
events known as "principals,"
which the president and vice presi
dent attend to encourage dona
tions.
Hess said that in the past, the
DNC has canceled some of these
principals because the president
and vice president had to deal with
urgent matters, including unrest in
the Balkans and the shootings at

Columbine I ligh School last year.
Another factor in the Democra
tic Party's financial troubles is that
the DNC lacked a finance chair
man for more than three months
before last week's appointments.
"I do think the DNC was slow
putting a finance leadership team
in place ... but the fact is the De
mocratic Party is going into this
presidential campaign year better
off financially than it did four years
ago," Hyatt said.
According to Hyatt, Democrats
accept that the Republican Party
will have more funds and therefore
more abundant advertising. But,
Hyatt said. "It is our message, as
contrasted to the Republicans'
message, that will win the election
in 2()()()."
