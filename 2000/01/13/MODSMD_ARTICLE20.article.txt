## 
### Greg Page Contributing writer 
Yesterday, former Secretary of
State George Shultz spoke to a
crowd of 120 scholars, students and
community members at the Hoover
Institution.
Shultz works with the foreign pol
icy advising team of Republican
presidential front-runner George W.
Bush. The team is headed by former
University Provost Condoleezza
Rice.
Shultz's speech covered four
broad topics: big-power diplomacy,
international economic issues,
human rights and the importance of
demographic changes in the world.
Shultz began by criticizing Presi
dent Bill Clinton's stance toward
Russia. He cited a Time magazine

interview in which Clinton praised
former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and did not express concern
over the Russian invasion of Chech
nya.
Shultz called Yeltsin "the most
erratic, episodic ruler of a great na
tion that has ever existed," and in
sisted, "There isn't a shred of evi
dence that suggests the Chechens
were responsible for the Moscow
bombing."
"Our interests are not to be sup
porting what |{he Russians] are
doing in Chechnya," he said.
Shultz stressed the importance of
world trade, while cautioning that
world financial institutions such as
the International Monetary Fund
should establish their role as "limit
ed purpose organizations," with ex
plicit restrictions as well as explicit

powers.
With regard to human rights,
Shultz said the United States must
he "clear and consistent (in oppos
ing] repression and political persecu
tion." He reminded the audience
that with human-rights issues, "quiet
work in most cases gets you better
results."
1 le called the situation in East
Timor "a blight 011 the human-rights
movement," because free elections
were held before the Indonesians
could set up a stable government.
Shult/ cited shifting demograph
ics as an important factor in future
world politics, lie attributed the
aging of populations in industrial
ized nations to two factors: decreas
ing fertility rates and increasing lifes
pans.
He said that in many such na

tions, labor force as a percentage of
population is "dropping like a
stone," and that its decline "may
lead to a shift in investment flow to
low-income countries."
Sluiltz concluded with an opti
mistic outlook, tempered by warn
ings of potential problems.
"The road ahead is a potentially
fantastic road." he said. "People all
over will have learned to find eco
nomic policies that will lead to pros
perity. Certainly, difficulties can
arise because of bad policies, as well
as real threats of weapons of mass
destruction. However, we can get
back to policies that work with a re
alistic, interest-based diplomacy."
The speech, titled "The Road
Ahead," was part of a I loover-spon
sored U.S. and World Affairs Semi
nar Series.
