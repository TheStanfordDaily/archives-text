# Stanford unimpressed by anti-plagiarism Web site
## 
### Corinne Yates Contributing writer 
Officials in the Office for Judi
cial Affairs report that they have
used Plagiarism.org, an anti
cipating Web site developed by
UC-Berkeley, in two cases of sus
pected plagiarism.
According to its Web site, Pla
giarism.org "compiled a massive
database of digital material by
continually cataloging and index
ing online academic works."
The site lets professors check
the originality of students' writing
against a database of papers found
online.
While the site claims wide
spread success in finding plagia
rists, Stanford Judicial Advisor
Laurettc Beeson said that the ser
vice did not help in either of the
two cases of suspected plagiarism.
"We tried it a couple of times,
but it hasn't been particularly use
ful. It only seems to compare [pa
pers] to other things that have
been submitted," Beeson said.
"They say that they are trying
to hook up with an online library
service, which would be much
more helpful, but that hasn't hap
pened yet," she said.
As for the use of Plagiarism.org
in other University departments,
Beeson said she had no knowl
edge of it being used in any acade
mic departments outside of the
two cases in Judicial Affairs.
"It is something that the Facul
ty Senate would have to discuss,
especially as far as for where it
stands with the Honor Code," she
said.
When talk of Plagiarism.org
first came up at Stanford in No
vember, Allison Katsev, a Stan
ford teaching fellow, said that
there was no need for widespread
use of such a device.
"To me that seems like a viola
tion of the Honor Code," she said.

Freshmen Theodore Marentis
said Plagiarism.org might have
been more useful in high school. "1
do not know much about the site,
but I am pretty sure my English
teachers back in high school
would have a field day over it,"he
said.
Plagiarism.org especially tar
gets students who use what they
call "term paper mills" — online
Web sites that either give away or
sell term papers.
"I don't think online plagiarism
is really an issue at a school like
Stanford," said junior Armen
Berjikly, the resident computer
coordinator for Otero.
"In any case where it happens, I
think that it is because most peo
ple don't know how to properly
cite online sources," Berjikly
added.
Despite the somewhat negative
response from Stanford, Plagia
rism .org is getting a lot of atten
tion from other universities.

Prof. David Presti told the San
Francisco Chronicle that when he
used the service in his classroom
he found that, even though he had
cautioned his class about the site,
more than one-tenth of the stu
dents plagiarized.
According to Soto RCC Kelvin
Chin, a junior, an idea similar to
Plagiarism.org is in place in the
Computer Science Department.
Chin said that in some classes,
students submit their work elec
tronically, and it is compared to a
database of assignments collected
over the years. One such class is
this quarter's Computer Science
244A.
"I personally believe that there
are about five students in each big
CS class that plagiarize," Chin
said. "1 think that's an issue."
As for Plagiarism.org, Beeson
said, "It's just one more investiga
tion tool."
