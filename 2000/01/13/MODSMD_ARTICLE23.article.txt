# Prof says glass ceiling not yet broken

Despite advances in breaking the
"glass ceiling" hindering women in
the workplace. Engineering Visiting
Prof. Debra Meyerson said she be
lieves more subtle barriers remain in
the foundations of the business
world.
Meyerson addressed this issue in
her article entitled "A Modest Man
ifesto for Shattering the Glass Ceil
ing" in this month's issue of the Har
vard Business Review.
Meyerson's article, which she co
wrote with Joyce Fletcher of Sim
mons Graduate School of Manage
ment, contends that while incidents
of blatant discrimination against
women have become less common,
hidden gender biases, such as the
emphasis on individual achievement
and unstructured scheduling, are in
herent in workplace culture.
"Not only are the biases difficult
to see, but there are also ideologies
that make it difficult for individuals
to see the patterns [of discrimina
tion]," Meyerson said. "We tend to

attribute failure to individuals, and
we don't see the patterns."
The article notes that in the past,
organizations have attempted to
deal with discrimination in three
ways: by teaching women to fit into a
male-oriented culture, by accommo
dating the needs of women with spe
cial programs and by funneling
women into more "appropriate"
tasks.
Meyerson said she believes these
methods will fall short of their goals
because they are "piecemeal fixes"
that only deal with the symptoms of
discrimination, ignoring deeply-em
bedded cultural causes. She advo
cates taking small steps in identify
ing problems in the structure of
workplace culture.
The gender inequality Meyerson
describes has created controversy at
many universities. Recently, some
members of Stanford's faculty have
complained that University hiring
and promotion practices are unfair.
In 1998 a group of female faculty
members submitted a 4(X)-page re
port to the Department of Labor
that indicated a trend of gender dis

crimination. The report noted that
women compose only 18 percent of
the faculty at Stanford and typically
have lower salaries. Last year, Karen
Sawislak, a former assistant profes
sor of history, complained that she
was unfairly denied tenure due to
her gender.
Although Meyerson declined to
address specific recent controversies
at Stanford, she pointed out that the
tenure system is an example of a
practice that seems gender neutral
but isn't.
"Tenure is a classic example of an
institution that has a differential im
pact on men and women," she said.
She noted that the most important
years in working toward tenure, ages
27 to 40, are also the years when
many women start families.
Although Stanford attempts to
accommodate women, allowing an
extra year before a tenure review if
they have been pregnant, Meyerson
said, "If you simply add a year to the
clock and say it's fixed, that inter
vention has to be explicitly linked to
the notion that the tenure clock is an
institution that is differentially

linked to men and women."
In other words, Meyerson be
lieves it is important that any adjust
ments to a discriminatory system
must be seen as addressing the prob
lem, not merely as steps to help
women.
Meyerson noted that other top
schools have been centers of unin
tentional discrimination. In 1999 a
five-year study revealed that MI T
had maintained a negative environ
ment for women, often giving them
smaller labs that resulted in fewer
publications and thus fewer chances
for promotion.
"When an individual woman
would complain about it, she was
seen as whining," said Meyerson.
"[MIT officials] wouldn't see the
larger pattern of discrimination."
According to Meyerson, ad
vances in combating discrimination
in the workplace are essential to im
proving society as a whole.
"[The workplace] is a place
where people spend most of their
lives," she said. " The notion that it's
a reflection and a producer of soci
ety is very important."
