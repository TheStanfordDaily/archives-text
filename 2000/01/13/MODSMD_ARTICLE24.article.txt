# GSC debates religious funding, land use
## 
### Mills Schenck Contributing writer 
In its weekly Wednesday meeting
at the Bechtel International Center,
the Graduate Student Council dis
cussed a controversial funding re
quest by a religious student group,
approved this year's elections com
mission and agreed on a letter to the
Santa Clara Board of Supervisors
supporting Stanford's new Land
Use Plan.
In a matter that will ultimately be
decided by the Constitutional Coun
cil, the GSC rejected the Inter-Var
sity Graduate Christian Fellow
ship's request for $1 for their annual
retreat near Big Basin state park.

The action was necessary for the
issue to be considered by the Consti
tutional Council. The Council will
likely meet next week to decide the
issue.
Mike Bartsch. a third-year doc
toral candidate in Mechanical Engi
neering, said, "It's the job of the
Constitutional Council to tell us if
we can fund a religious group."
Because it is unclear whether the
legislative bodies of the ASSIJ are
allowed to give money to student re
ligious groups, the Inter-Varsity Fel
lowship had been working with the
GSC to find funding from other stu
dent groups.
Having failed so far, the GSC de
cided it was time to pass the matter

on to the Constitutional Council.
"It's time we made a choice on
this issue," said Chris Strombery, a
second-year graduate student in
Chemistry. "We need to stop wast
ing these people's time."
Mark Wistey, a third-year doc
toral candidate in Electrical Engi
neering and a member of the fellow
ship, said, "I would like to find out if
Inter-Varsity is to be treated as any
other student group."
In other business, the GSC ap
proved the members of this year's
Elections Commission, a group that
runs student officer elections.
The group has many familiar
faces from last year, including Elec
tions Commissioner Jason Kang.

The other members are Jasper
Cody, Kim Chan, Katie Young and
Eric Albert.
"I'm excited that so many people
are coming back," said ASSU Presi
dent Mike Levin.
The CiSC also approved an offi
cial letter to the Santa Clara Board
of Supervisors supporting the Uni
versity's proposition to build 1.000
new single graduate student apart
ments.
Graduate housing has been a se
rious concern of the GSC over the
past two years. The letter voices the
Council's support for Stanford's
Land Use Plan to be approved by
the Santa Clara County Board of Su
pervisors.
