# Leland E-mail system revamped to alleviate forwarding confusion

### Amy L. Kovac 
During winter break, changes in the campus e-mail
system temporarily caused problems for people using
Stanford mailing list servers. The e-mail system was
streamlined by merging all "username@leland.stan
ford.edu" and "username@stanford.edu" e-mail ad
dresses into the same system.
According to Acting Manager of Leland Systems
Mary Washburn, the merger should help eliminate con
fusion between the two different e-mail systems and re
quire fewer machines to handle e-mail.
In addition, the system managers "wanted to offer
users one place where they could change their forward
ing information," Washburn said.
Prior to Dec. 20, if students wanted to change their
forwarding information, they had to login to a Sweet
Hall cluster machine to forward username@leland.stan
ford.edu mail; username@stanford.edu changes were
done through the World Wide Web.
Now all users can change forwarding addresses at
http://stanfordyou.stanford.edu.
Also, those who receive e-mail from Stanford ac
counts will now see the username@stanford.edu address
listed as the sender's address.
Washburn stressed that these changes do not affect

the way that users receive their e-mail; e-mail sent to
username@leland.stanford.edu and username@stan
ford.edu will reach the same location.
Despite the long-term benefits of altering the system,
there have been some short-term problems. Until Jan. 5.
a bug in the mailing list program prevented the system
from equating username@leland.stanford.edu with
username@stanford.edu addresses.
As a result, majordomo. the list server, erroneously
informed some users that their addresses were not mem
bers of certain lists or that their address did not have
posting permission.
This confused users on campus who regularly use
lists. Junior Yaneeka Huq, resident computer coordina
tor for Lantana, said some of her residents were con
fused by the messages they received.
However, she said she believed that the resulting
problem was more due to a "failure to communicate to
all list owners about the impact of the changes for lists"
than anything else.
According to Huq, while this was temporarily incon
venient, "it wasn't that big of a problem."
The problem has been corrected, and users should
now be able to post to lists as before. Anyone still expe
riencing problems should contact majordomo
owner@lists.stanford.edu.
