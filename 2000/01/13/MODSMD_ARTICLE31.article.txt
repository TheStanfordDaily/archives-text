# Bela Fleck and the Flecktones
## Music Greatest Hits of the 20th Century Bauhaus Gotham 
### 
Bela Reck and the Flecktones have a reputation as
mavericks. Moving effortlessly from deeply tradi
tional bluegrass to the outer reaches of experi
mental jazz, they've managed to draw contemporary audi
ences to their unique brand of jazz- and rock-inflected
bluegrass.
Commercial and critical success have followed natural
ly. The track "Sinister Minister," which leads their recent-

ly released
compila
tion
"Greatest

Hits of the 20th Century," won a Grammy for Best Pop In
strumental Performance and managed to land in heavy ro
tation on VH-1 without a single vocal to be heard.
Those new to the Flecktones funk will enjoy "2()th Cen
tury," which is an accessible introduction to the band's
unique style. The album collects highlights from a decade
of the band's work, which began in 1990 with the epony
mous "Bela Fleck and the Flecktones" and has gotten
stronger and more diverse despite many changes to the
band's lineup. Always at its heart is banjo wizard Bela
Fleck, who has not only mastered an incredibly difficult in
strument but turned it to uses Nashville probably never
imagined.
Critics have always had trouble pigeonholing the band.
After listening to the album, it's easy to understand why
the group moves effortlessly from the banjo-virtuoso blue
grass of "Road House Blues" to the butter-smooth jazz of
"Vix 9," from the slow, melancholy roll of the bizarrely ti
tled "Flight of the Cosmic Hippo" to the lightning riffs of
"Shocktime." "Big Country" mixes low-key traditional
bluegrass with Jeff Coffin's lilting saxophone work.
The album holds some pleasant surprises for the fan of
what passes for college-rock these days, including a collab
oration with Dave Matthews, whose followers will enjoy
his vocal performance on "Communication." The rest of
us can draw solace from Fleck's delicate banjo backing and
the strung work of band member Coffin's mellow sax and
founding member Victor Wooten on bass.

The surprising "Resurrection" tour broke the 15-year si
lence of what was to be Bauhaus's unfortunate demise in
1983. As bassist David J uttered the words "Rest in peace"
at their last live show in New York City, a reunion of this seminal
band appeared quite unlikely.
Yet with the cult status Bauhaus acquired throughout the
years since their breakup, the post-punk goth luminaries' return
engagement in the summer of 1998 certainly warranted much ex
citement from old and new fans. The nostalgia and sense of histo
ry felt by the band's postmortem listeners was to finally be re
placed by the unforeseen tour.
For the unfortunate few who missed Bauhaus onstage back
in 1983 or in 1998, a live recording at the Hammerstein Ball
room in New York City, appropriately titled "Gotham," doc
uments and reunites fans with the band's notoriously intense
live shows.
Considering most dubiously produced performance record
ings, "Gotham" is extremely well-done, maintaining the raw

darkness of their live sound while the group's characteristic ele
ments come through as clean, edgy and emotive as in past studio
releases.
Peter Murphy's powerful and intimidating vocals, laden with
seductive grunts and moans, are best felt on "A God In Ari Al
cove" and "Boys," while the menacing bass-line and goth guitar
sway on "She's In Parties" perhaps surpasses the album version.
The only new track is a cover of Dead Can Dance's "Sever
ance," featured both live (the album's goth-club hit) and as a stu
dio version, consequently Bauhaus's first recording since their
last release "Burning From The Inside." The singles and hits
sound significantly undated, with legendary tracks such as the
opener "Double Dare" and "Bela Lugosi's Dead" undoubtedly
pointing to the band's timelessness.
Ironically, the "Gotham" album resurrects something quite
undead.
