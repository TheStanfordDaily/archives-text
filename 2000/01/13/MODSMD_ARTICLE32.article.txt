# Join Ram's Head for three satisfying 'One Acts'
## Theatre 
### 
In her own words, Avery Willis, Class
of '99, is "no longer afraid of uri
nals."
She's had plenty of time to get used to
them while directing a one-act play, "Be
tween Cleanings," that takes place en
tirely in bathrooms.
It's just one example of the surprising
theatrical situations that one associates
with Ram's Head's "Original Winter
One Acts," which open this weekend.
Three of the most intense, satisfying
scripts to hit the Nitery in years promise
a memorable night of theater.
Megan Mickley, a senior in Human
Biology, is producing this year's show.
"One Acts," which are entirely student
written, -acted, and -staffed, are a

laugh, cry and laugh some more.
Between Cleanings
Senior Art Schram, an English major
and "One Acts" veteran, takes on the
mystery of what goes on in the bar bath
room in his play, "Between Cleanings."
The boss, Mr. Dahlberg, and his under
lings are faking their way through a com
pany party at the Che/. Rufus when se
crets and egos begin to spill in the bath
rooms.
In a pattern similar to that of the film
"Short Cuts," the vignettes begin to
weave together in set designer Andrew
Leeds' convincing restrooms. There is
trouble in store for just about everyone
except the philosophical janitor (Nick
Beckman).
It all starts innocently enough with
urinal-side business deals and a hilarious
red-carpet entrance for Dahlberg and
his wife, but things get tense when two
subordinates insult the boss and his tro
phy wife spills a dastardly secret to the
Vice President of Marketing.
All the males have angst in their pants
just waiting to be let out, from the subor
dinates clawing their way through the
work day to Dahlberg himself. Linoleum
and stalls get to play all their roles at
once as a place for sex, female bonding,
male bonding, dirty talk, gossip, black
mail, fistfights, threats, business, confes
sion, drunkenness, sanctuary and hiding.
It is truly the small but powerful "for
gotten corner of modernized technocrat
ic society." Willis and Schram deftly ex

pose the primal, base nature of life in
stark contrast to the impossible ideals of
success envisioned by Dahlberg's over
worked subordinates.
The play's brand of "bathroom
humor" has campy Mafia moments and
plenty of sight gags. Blink and you'll miss
the "passing of the torch" and the candy
bar that won't go away. Sara Neff, who
plays the strong-willed but dateless Vice
President Kate, said "I have really en
joyed being in 'One Acts' and can't wait
for the performance. ['One Acts'] is an

extremely special thing because this is
the only [dramatic] show done at Stan
ford which is entirely student-created,
from the writing to the lights."
Standouts in the strong ensemble cast
include Lindsay Dunagan's drunken tro
phy wife and Chantel Benson as a lusty
secretary. The rest of the cast is com
prised of Beckman, Neff, Ali Zaidi, Scott
Lowe, Chris Labrum, Robert Martinez,
David Endelman and Alexis Halaby.
Schram had high praise for the improvi
sational skill and creativity of the cast of
"Between Cleanings." He marveled,
"They really made my script into some
thing good."
"Are you going to buy me a BMW?
Well, are you?" demands the secretary
of the tipsy workaholic in her arms.
Maybe in this time of salary comparisons
and shallow get-rich-quick dreams, we
should all watch "Between Cleanings"
as a reminder that "success" can go, well.

down the toilet.
The Christmas Feast
"There's nothing wrong with base
ball."
Like "Between Cleanings," "The
Christmas Feast" begins with the only
normal character in the play introducing
the chaos that is about to ensue. This
time around, though, the microscope is
on a different, even more sordid "safe
place" — the family living room at
Christmastime. Here is where the sim-

plest comment or the tenderest term of
endearment can be as crushing as a fist
when tension is high.
Nathaniel, a young man of 19, relates
that his composition about a family
Christmas feast 10 years prior got him an
F, clicking tongues from the school psy
chologists and ostracism. But, he adds,
"it was the first honest thing I had ever
written."
From the forced politeness to the
tough love between the characters, it
doesn't get much more brutally honest
than "The Christmas Feast." Nathaniel
is joined by his parents, Noelle and Nick,
his wistful aunt Kate, a grandmother
quite reminiscent of Amanda Wingfield
and joking uncle Carl, who is really dying
inside. All the characters are somewhat
detached from reality, as though ignor
ing their problems will heal the festering
sore common to them all. They adhere
to rituals because it is all they have left.

Truth is finally realized in the form of
a harrowing, nightmarish encounter. But
the story is about survival, and Noelle
and Nathaniel's courage in the face of
that which they are dependent on.
Noelle passes on her staunch hope to
Nathaniel with a wish that nothing but
truth flow from the pen with which he
writes.
Watch for Ava Roy's tart delivery as
Noelle's sister Kate. Galen Davis as
Nathaniel, Nick Beckman as Nick,
Aaron Shaw as Carl and Sarah Price as
Mildred round out the cast.
Memento Mori
"And that's why you love your fa
ther?"
Directors Jennifer Gadda, a senior
drama major, and Geoff von Oeyen, a
senior urban studies major, knew right
away when they read it that they wanted
to direct Paul "Corpuscle Casanova"
Kerschen's "Memento Mori."
Gadda said, "It's a very powerful
piece, particularly the ending, but the
fact that it's a farce means that it's still a
lot of fun."
Kerschen, a senior in English, added
that he had no problems turning his
work over to the two directors. "Theii
idea for what the play should look like
really jived with mine."
The show is a terrific showcase of
rapid-fire, hilarious dialogue. Adrian
(freshman Jonathan Kaplan) is a miser
able file clerk with an unusual son of
baggage. He doesn't see dead people; lie
sees Death. The cloaked figure has beei
following him around for the past year,
filling in the Sunday crosswords and
lounging around in his apartment.
"Memento Mori" (literally, "remem
ber to die") begins when he visits a
crazed psychiatrist in an attempt to un
derstand why he has been chosen to be
plagued in such a manner. Ultimately,
though, the play reminds us that exis
tence — or the lack of it — is the ultimate
secret that nothing, not even "One
Acts," can divulge.
Senior Cody Harris shines in the role
of Dr. Oliver Omnibus, the high-strung,
Freud-worshipping psychiatrist bent on
turning Adrian's misery into a landmark
conference topic. Ilyssa Silverman is a
riot as Omnibus' receptionist.
Harris played a small role in a 1998
one-act, "Solitaire for Two." This year,
along with having a much larger part, he
appreciated that the casts were required
to watch each other's rehearsals, making
fora more meaningful experience.
Mandana Khosnevisan plays the
scene-stealing Death with some serious
attitude. Of her "One Acts" experience,
Khosnevisan said, "It's been fun biking
home with a scythe."
Kaplan, ironically a psychology
major, stated, "Being in Ram's Head is
like starting with a block of wood and
carving it into something beautiful."
And high quality wood it is.

Memento Mori
"And that's why you love your fa
ther?"
Directors Jennifer Gadda, a senior
drama major, and Geoff von Oeyen, a
senior urban studies major, knew right
away when they read it that they wanted
to direct Paul "Corpuscle Casanova"
Kerschen's "Memento Mori."
Gadda said, "It's a very powerful
piece, particularly the ending, but the
fact that it's a farce means that it's still a
lot of fun."
Kerschen, a senior in English, added
that he had no problems turning his
work over to the two directors. "Theii
idea for what the play should look like
really jived with mine."
The show is a terrific showcase of
rapid-fire, hilarious dialogue. Adrian
(freshman Jonathan Kaplan) is a miser
able file clerk with an unusual son of
baggage. He doesn't see dead people; lie
sees Death. The cloaked figure has beei

lounging around in his apartment.
"Memento Mori" (literally, "remem
ber to die") begins when he visits a
crazed psychiatrist in an attempt to un
derstand why he has been chosen to be
plagued in such a manner. Ultimately,
though, the play reminds us that exis
tence — or the lack of it — is the ultimate
secret that nothing, not even "One
Acts," can divulge.
Senior Cody Harris shines in the role
of Dr. Oliver Omnibus, the high-strung,
Freud-worshipping psychiatrist bent on
turning Adrian's misery into a landmark
conference topic. Ilyssa Silverman is a
riot as Omnibus' receptionist.
Harris played a small role in a 1998
one-act, "Solitaire for Two." This year,
along with having a much larger part, he
appreciated that the casts were required
to watch each other's rehearsals, making
fora more meaningful experience.
Mandana Khosnevisan plays the
scene-stealing Death with some serious
attitude. Of her "One Acts" experience,
Khosnevisan said, "It's been fun biking
home with a scythe."
Kaplan, ironically a psychology
major, stated, "Being in Ram's Head is
like starting with a block of wood and
carving it into something beautiful."
And high quality wood it is.

In her own words, Avery Willis, Class
of '99, is "no longer afraid of uri
nals."
She's had plenty of time to get used to
them while directing a one-act play, "Be

tirely in bathrooms.
It's just one example of the surprising
theatrical situations that one associates
with Ram's Head's "Original Winter
One Acts," which open this weekend.
Three of the most intense, satisfying
scripts to hit the Nitery in years promise
a memorable night of theater.

laugh, cry and laugh some more.
Between Cleanings
Senior Art Schram, an English major
and "One Acts" veteran, takes on the
mystery of what goes on in the bar bath
room in his play, "Between Cleanings."
The boss, Mr. Dahlberg, and his under
lings are faking their way through a com
pany party at the Che/. Rufus when se
crets and egos begin to spill in the bath
rooms.
In a pattern similar to that of the film
"Short Cuts," the vignettes begin to
weave together in set designer Andrew
Leeds' convincing restrooms. There is
trouble in store for just about everyone
except the philosophical janitor (Nick
Beckman).
It all starts innocently enough with
urinal-side business deals and a hilarious
red-carpet entrance for Dahlberg and
his wife, but things get tense when two
subordinates insult the boss and his tro
phy wife spills a dastardly secret to the
Vice President of Marketing.
All the males have angst in their pants
just waiting to be let out, from the subor
dinates clawing their way through the
work day to Dahlberg himself. Linoleum
and stalls get to play all their roles at
once as a place for sex, female bonding,
male bonding, dirty talk, gossip, black
mail, fistfights, threats, business, confes
sion, drunkenness, sanctuary and hiding.
It is truly the small but powerful "for
gotten corner of modernized technocrat
ic society." Willis and Schram deftly ex

pose the primal, base nature of life in
stark contrast to the impossible ideals of
success envisioned by Dahlberg's over
worked subordinates.
The play's brand of "bathroom
humor" has campy Mafia moments and
plenty of sight gags. Blink and you'll miss
the "passing of the torch" and the candy
bar that won't go away. Sara Neff, who
plays the strong-willed but dateless Vice
President Kate, said "I have really en
joyed being in 'One Acts' and can't wait
for the performance. ['One Acts'] is an

extremely special thing because this is
the only [dramatic] show done at Stan
ford which is entirely student-created,
from the writing to the lights."
Standouts in the strong ensemble cast
include Lindsay Dunagan's drunken tro
phy wife and Chantel Benson as a lusty
secretary. The rest of the cast is com
prised of Beckman, Neff, Ali Zaidi, Scott
Lowe, Chris Labrum, Robert Martinez,
David Endelman and Alexis Halaby.
Schram had high praise for the improvi
sational skill and creativity of the cast of
"Between Cleanings." He marveled,
"They really made my script into some
thing good."
"Are you going to buy me a BMW?
Well, are you?" demands the secretary
of the tipsy workaholic in her arms.
Maybe in this time of salary comparisons
and shallow get-rich-quick dreams, we
should all watch "Between Cleanings"
as a reminder that "success" can go, well.

down the toilet.
The Christmas Feast
"There's nothing wrong with base
ball."
Like "Between Cleanings," "The
Christmas Feast" begins with the only
normal character in the play introducing
the chaos that is about to ensue. This
time around, though, the microscope is
on a different, even more sordid "safe
place" — the family living room at
Christmastime. Here is where the sim-

plest comment or the tenderest term of
endearment can be as crushing as a fist
when tension is high.
Nathaniel, a young man of 19, relates
that his composition about a family
Christmas feast 10 years prior got him an
F, clicking tongues from the school psy
chologists and ostracism. But, he adds,
"it was the first honest thing I had ever
written."
From the forced politeness to the
tough love between the characters, it
doesn't get much more brutally honest
than "The Christmas Feast." Nathaniel
is joined by his parents, Noelle and Nick,
his wistful aunt Kate, a grandmother
quite reminiscent of Amanda Wingfield
and joking uncle Carl, who is really dying
inside. All the characters are somewhat
detached from reality, as though ignor
ing their problems will heal the festering
sore common to them all. They adhere
to rituals because it is all they have left.

Truth is finally realized in the form of
a harrowing, nightmarish encounter. But
the story is about survival, and Noelle
and Nathaniel's courage in the face of
that which they are dependent on.
Noelle passes on her staunch hope to
Nathaniel with a wish that nothing but
truth flow from the pen with which he
writes.

Noelle's sister Kate. Galen Davis as
Nathaniel, Nick Beckman as Nick,
Aaron Shaw as Carl and Sarah Price as
Mildred round out the cast.
