## Tim Roth Speaks Out about his first time... behind the camera. 
### Eno Sarris Contributing writer 
Tim Roth, a favorite of Quentin
Tarantino fans, recently made the transi
tion from acting to directing. His directo
rial debut, "The War Zone," has been in
limited release, buoyed by strong critical
acclaim. Intermission jumped at the op
portunity to speak with Roth about the
controversial thematic material of the film
as well as his thoughts on the film indus
try.
Intermission: How long had you been
thinking about directing before you
chose to direct "The War Zone?"
Tim Roth: I think since the beginning, re
ally. I mean I've been on the film set for
about 15 years, but I've been around di
rectors for about 20. I've always thought
it was a great job, but it wasn't my first
choice. My first choice would have been
cinematography, but that requires train
ing, and I'd have to go to college and start
all over again. I was already on track with
the acting thing. Directing, I just as
sumed, was sort of what I had grown up
to do. I was told by a lot of directors that
I should direct.
I: How easy was it to take over the tech
nical aspect of directing?
TR: I loved that bit. That was not diffi
cult. I knew a lot already. I knew what I
wanted to do with the frame and all that.
But then I hired these great technicians,
so if I have a question or a problem, I just
ask them, and they provide me with a so
lution. As long as I can be articulate
enough to get across what I want to emo
tionally put forward, they can give me a
million options and ways to do it, be
cause they are very good at what they do.
All the actors would just go back to their
trailer. I understand going back to your
trailer to have a sleep, if you haven't had
a good night's sleep the night before. But
there's so much going on; it's a fascinat
ing place.
I: Which of the directors that you worked
with most influenced you?
TR: I think the first one that I worked
with on film, which was Alan Clarke —

he's an English director. He was extra
ordinary. And then, I've worked with
some really good people. But I think the
bad directors that I've worked with are
the strongest influences, because to be
directed by someone badly is an abomi
nation. It's a very tough lesson to learn,
but it's a good one to learn. They would
be the biggest influences, really, and I've
worked with a lot of bad directors. I
mean, maybe in films that you think are
good, but the directors were atrocious.
I: As far as acting, what has been your
favorite role?
TR: "Made in Britain" [directed by Alan
Clarke]. Just because it was the begin
ning, and it was a real great set to be on. I
look at it now, as I saw it quite recently,
and it was very naive, but that's probably
what was good about it. I could just see
me working stuff out about acting while
it was going on. Some of it worked, and
some of it didn't, but overall [it worked].
It wasn't my best performance, but it's
the one I like best.
I: How did you get picked for "Made in
Britain?"
TR: I was looking fora bicycle pump at
the time, at this theater that I worked at.
And they said, "We don't have a pump,
but there are these auditions going on
this week if you want to go." And I did,
and I got the job. That gave me the confi
dence to take non-actors and put them
into this film. And not only in the film,
but also in incredibly challenging roles,
more so than they will probably ever ex
perience in their lives as actors, I would
imagine.
I: It seems like you've fallen out of love
with acting. Is that true?
TR: I 've fallen out of love with aspects of
it. Certainly not all of it. I love actors, es
pecially considering what these guys
went through. But I just stopped going to
see films that I was in. I was starting to
become a bit bored with it. I mean I just
wasn't interested anymore in what I was
doing. So I'm changing that. I've found
another job, something that maybe I was
supposed to do in the first place. Every
thing was training for doing this. But then

I'm going to go out and do something
completely different in the acting world
anyway.
I: / was interested in how you were work
ing with two untrained actors. Could
you talk more about the coaching you
had to give the actors, especially for the
big scene?
TR: They each required a different style
of direction — the actors and the non-ac
tors. To be honest with you, I thought it
was going to he that I would take two
young people that hadn't acted before,
and if I put them amongst really high
grade actors, it would rub off on them.
That was the case, but the opposite was
also true, that they rubbed off on the
["real") actors. I started to see that the
performances coming from the people
that had experience were of a much high
er caliber than they had ever given be
fore, because they were looking at these
two who've had no restrictions placed
upon them — these two weren't restrict
ed by experience — and were coming up
with some stuff that was real raw and real
intelligent. Those that had experience re
membered doing that when they started,
so they started to lose all the actor bulls
- that they'd learned and just tried to get
the characters right. It was a very good
mix, and I'm going to do it again.
I: The girl was spotted just shopping in a
market. Was she not even intending to
audition?
TR: No, she didn't know what we were
we up to. What the deal was that [the
casting people] would go to colleges, to
schools. The brief was: no actors. It was
just a certain age — an age for the boy
and an age for the girl, and that was it.
The casting people would also walk
around the street, and walk about and
just go up to people and say, "Do you
want to read fora film?" Most people
would say, "No, go away." But some
would say yes. I think they saw 4() that
way. And she was one of that group. She
thought we were going to steal her purse,
and she said, "Yeah, I'll do that." They
gave her the script immediately. I saw a
picture of her, a Polaroid, and I said,
"That's looking right. Give her the script

to read." She looked completely differ
ent than what she looks in the film.
I: What was the age of the boy's charac
ter in the movie?
TR: Sixteen, that was how old he was. 1
thought I'd go younger, but it would have
been very difficult as far as hours that
you can work with someone so young. 1
actually liked him being in complete hor
monal turmoil, anyway. His character
was really withdrawn.
I: Did he have to work on that?
TR: No, I made him like that. He's a kid
that's not that way. I wanted him to be a
little different going into it.
I: What did you guys do to calm every
body after the day?
TR: It was party central. It was, absolute
ly. We had a budget put aside for
parties — parties every weekend, every
night meeting in the pub, practical jokes
constantly on set. The crew were cast and
auditioned like actors would. Anyone
that started moaning was fired. They
were written a really good letter of rec
ommendation, but they were immediate
ly fired. Because you can't have that
around these people — everyone's gotta
want to come to work. It's tough. And it
was tough, but it was also fun. It was a
great experience for those people. I de
signed it that way.
I: You mentioned that you've verified the
reality of the abusive situations in the
movie. You did so with experts on
abuse?
TR: Many victims worked on this film.
I've been taking it around the world and
doing question and answer sessions after
screenings. There have been a lot of peo
ple who have worked with pedophiles
and victims. They've absolutely ap
proved of the film. Also, victims have
seen it, and we always get a great re
sponse from them. It's the critics you've
got to watch. We recently took it to a con
ference of 1,50() people who deal with the
subject and are specialists.
I: And the response was good?
TR: Yeah. Absolutely fabulous. I think


Rolf Konow — Cinecom
they all end up using it as a tool. This
conference was in Madison, Wis. There
was no press allowed — we wouldn't let
anyone near it. So actually people were
open in conversation. The problem is,
I've had to change my method of doing
[0 and A] because sometimes some
body will start talking for the first time,
and it will be in the press the next day.
That's not fair. So if I know journalists
are in the audience—journalists may
be victims and also might be abusers —
they're fair game, but 1 have to let every
one know. They're not exactly the most
trustworthy people, generally, because
they are looking fora story. If they are
going to speak, they have to be aware
that they are speaking possibly more
publicly than they want to. We've had
the opposite, too. We've had absolutely
furious people, leaving screaming and
shouting. That happened once in Toron
to. I say, if you're going to leave, leave
quietly. Respect other people's rights to
see the movie.
I: At these Q and A sessions, are you in
the audience, watching people's reac
tions?
TR: After the film, I'd sit and talk about
anything. Except if there are journalists
there, then it all gets shut down, and the
nature of it changes. The ones without
journalists are extraordinary, they really
are. I'm not against journalists at all, but
they tend to not realize that they have an
extreme responsibility. There's a guy
that 1 know, a very famous actor, who
punched the s— out of a journalist once
because the journalist had not only
wrecked his wedding day by announcing
the location, the date and the time, but
had then gone on and found his mother,
who he was having serious problems
with since he was a little kid, and got her
to sell her story. Not only did he get
beaten by this actor, but then he got beat
up by the actor's wife as well, and then
another friend of mine jumped in. Then
he left the country, but we know where
he lives. He still hasn't apologized.
I: Is there a difference between Ameri

can journalism and British journalism?
TR: I actually have been treated better
by the press here. The journalists in my
own country tend to hide behind a sort
of liberal faqade, apart from the lunatics,
the tabloids. The British are very
strange. They also always try and de
stroy anyone of their own that has had
any success. They went for Gary [Old
man); they've gone fora whole bunch of
us. And they don't expect we would go
for them. I think they're finding it a little
more difficult to get interviews with all
of us right now. There's a move afoot to
actually step away from all of them.
1: Are you going to base yourself in Eng
land or Hollywood?
TR: I'm in L.A. My problem with stay
ing in L.A. is that the gun thing is a prob
lem for me. I have children, and I don't
want guns around my children. My chil
dren are American, and my wife is
American. I've been employed here,
and I've been treated incredibly well
here. But guns are still a problem. I don't
know what to do about it, except leave.
And I don't know if I want to go back to
Britain. I'll definitely be directing my
next film there anyway, but it's not a
place I want to live. But you have this
huge addiction to guns ovei here. I don't
want my kids to be the victim of a ran
dom bullet. It's just too easy to get guns.
The only gun law you can have is an ab
solute ban on guns. An absolute ban.
and they're not going to do that. Give
them amnesty, two years. All the guns
off the streets by two years, otherwise
it's a criminal act. Unless that's going to
happen, I don't know how anyone can
operate. Where else in the world does
this problem exist? It's not helped by
various bad actors' attitudes toward cer
tain gun organizations.
I: / noticed that nudity was treated very
liberally in"The War Zone." Is that a
difference between American and
British cinema?
TR: That's about this family. That's
about inappropriate behavior. There's
something wrong with this family. I

think there comes a time when you stop
taking your clothes off in front of your
children. There comes a time, and that
time has not happened in this family. So
we can look at it and go, "There's some
thing wrong here." The audience also
struggles with it. They struggle with their
feelings toward seeing those naked bod
ies considering the dilemma that the
characters are going through. I like that
the audience has a tough time with that.
They have an animal action to a naked
body. There is a natural reaction to a
naked human body. If your intentions
are good, it's OK. I want the audience to
examine what their intentions are.
1:1 was really interested in how you left

a lot of open-ended questions. You
mentioned that being part of your vi
sion.
TR: If I gave you answers, it might make
the problem go away in your minds. The
thing is not to do that; the thing is to ask
the questions. The danger with a film
like this is that it becomes relegated to
just being an issue film, and then people
can just dismiss it. By turning it into cin
ema as well as dealing with a sensitive
subject, then we can all go and discuss.
But if I give you an answer, if I give you
a solution, then it'll get lost, because you
can neatly package it and throw it away.
There are no answers to any of these
questions, only in specific cases. There
are no general answers.

TR: I think the first one that I worked
with on film, which was Alan Clarke —

he's an English director. He was extra
ordinary. And then, I've worked with
some really good people. But I think the
bad directors that I've worked with are
the strongest influences, because to be
directed by someone badly is an abomi
nation. It's a very tough lesson to learn,
but it's a good one to learn. They would
be the biggest influences, really, and I've
worked with a lot of bad directors. I
mean, maybe in films that you think are
good, but the directors were atrocious.
I: As far as acting, what has been your
favorite role?
TR: "Made in Britain" [directed by Alan
Clarke]. Just because it was the begin
ning, and it was a real great set to be on. I
look at it now, as I saw it quite recently,
and it was very naive, but that's probably
what was good about it. I could just see
me working stuff out about acting while
it was going on. Some of it worked, and
some of it didn't, but overall [it worked].
It wasn't my best performance, but it's
the one I like best.
I: How did you get picked for "Made in
Britain?"
TR: I was looking fora bicycle pump at
the time, at this theater that I worked at.
And they said, "We don't have a pump,
but there are these auditions going on
this week if you want to go." And I did,
and I got the job. That gave me the confi
dence to take non-actors and put them
into this film. And not only in the film,
but also in incredibly challenging roles,
more so than they will probably ever ex
perience in their lives as actors, I would
imagine.
I: It seems like you've fallen out of love
with acting. Is that true?
TR: I 've fallen out of love with aspects of
it. Certainly not all of it. I love actors, es
pecially considering what these guys
went through. But I just stopped going to
see films that I was in. I was starting to
become a bit bored with it. I mean I just
wasn't interested anymore in what I was
doing. So I'm changing that. I've found
another job, something that maybe I was
supposed to do in the first place. Every
thing was training for doing this. But then

I'm going to go out and do something
completely different in the acting world
anyway.
I: / was interested in how you were work
ing with two untrained actors. Could
you talk more about the coaching you
had to give the actors, especially for the
big scene?
TR: They each required a different style
of direction — the actors and the non-ac
tors. To be honest with you, I thought it
was going to he that I would take two
young people that hadn't acted before,
and if I put them amongst really high
grade actors, it would rub off on them.
That was the case, but the opposite was
also true, that they rubbed off on the
["real") actors. I started to see that the
performances coming from the people
that had experience were of a much high
er caliber than they had ever given be
fore, because they were looking at these
two who've had no restrictions placed
upon them — these two weren't restrict
ed by experience — and were coming up
with some stuff that was real raw and real
intelligent. Those that had experience re
membered doing that when they started,
so they started to lose all the actor bulls
- that they'd learned and just tried to get
the characters right. It was a very good
mix, and I'm going to do it again.
I: The girl was spotted just shopping in a
market. Was she not even intending to
audition?
TR: No, she didn't know what we were
we up to. What the deal was that [the
casting people] would go to colleges, to
schools. The brief was: no actors. It was
just a certain age — an age for the boy
and an age for the girl, and that was it.
The casting people would also walk
around the street, and walk about and
just go up to people and say, "Do you
want to read fora film?" Most people
would say, "No, go away." But some
would say yes. I think they saw 4() that
way. And she was one of that group. She
thought we were going to steal her purse,
and she said, "Yeah, I'll do that." They
gave her the script immediately. I saw a
picture of her, a Polaroid, and I said,
"That's looking right. Give her the script

to read." She looked completely differ
ent than what she looks in the film.
I: What was the age of the boy's charac
ter in the movie?
TR: Sixteen, that was how old he was. 1
thought I'd go younger, but it would have
been very difficult as far as hours that
you can work with someone so young. 1
actually liked him being in complete hor
monal turmoil, anyway. His character
was really withdrawn.
I: Did he have to work on that?
TR: No, I made him like that. He's a kid
that's not that way. I wanted him to be a
little different going into it.
I: What did you guys do to calm every
body after the day?
TR: It was party central. It was, absolute
ly. We had a budget put aside for
parties — parties every weekend, every
night meeting in the pub, practical jokes
constantly on set. The crew were cast and
auditioned like actors would. Anyone
that started moaning was fired. They
were written a really good letter of rec
ommendation, but they were immediate
ly fired. Because you can't have that
around these people — everyone's gotta
want to come to work. It's tough. And it
was tough, but it was also fun. It was a
great experience for those people. I de
signed it that way.
I: You mentioned that you've verified the
reality of the abusive situations in the
movie. You did so with experts on
abuse?
TR: Many victims worked on this film.
I've been taking it around the world and
doing question and answer sessions after
screenings. There have been a lot of peo
ple who have worked with pedophiles
and victims. They've absolutely ap
proved of the film. Also, victims have
seen it, and we always get a great re
sponse from them. It's the critics you've
got to watch. We recently took it to a con
ference of 1,50() people who deal with the
subject and are specialists.
I: And the response was good?
TR: Yeah. Absolutely fabulous. I think


Rolf Konow — Cinecom
they all end up using it as a tool. This
conference was in Madison, Wis. There
was no press allowed — we wouldn't let
anyone near it. So actually people were
open in conversation. The problem is,
I've had to change my method of doing
[0 and A] because sometimes some
body will start talking for the first time,
and it will be in the press the next day.
That's not fair. So if I know journalists
are in the audience—journalists may
be victims and also might be abusers —
they're fair game, but 1 have to let every
one know. They're not exactly the most
trustworthy people, generally, because
they are looking fora story. If they are
going to speak, they have to be aware
that they are speaking possibly more
publicly than they want to. We've had
the opposite, too. We've had absolutely
furious people, leaving screaming and
shouting. That happened once in Toron
to. I say, if you're going to leave, leave
quietly. Respect other people's rights to
see the movie.
I: At these Q and A sessions, are you in
the audience, watching people's reac
tions?
TR: After the film, I'd sit and talk about
anything. Except if there are journalists
there, then it all gets shut down, and the
nature of it changes. The ones without
journalists are extraordinary, they really
are. I'm not against journalists at all, but
they tend to not realize that they have an
extreme responsibility. There's a guy
that 1 know, a very famous actor, who
punched the s— out of a journalist once
because the journalist had not only
wrecked his wedding day by announcing
the location, the date and the time, but
had then gone on and found his mother,
who he was having serious problems
with since he was a little kid, and got her
to sell her story. Not only did he get
beaten by this actor, but then he got beat
up by the actor's wife as well, and then
another friend of mine jumped in. Then
he left the country, but we know where
he lives. He still hasn't apologized.
I: Is there a difference between Ameri

can journalism and British journalism?
TR: I actually have been treated better
by the press here. The journalists in my
own country tend to hide behind a sort
of liberal faqade, apart from the lunatics,
the tabloids. The British are very
strange. They also always try and de
stroy anyone of their own that has had
any success. They went for Gary [Old
man); they've gone fora whole bunch of
us. And they don't expect we would go
for them. I think they're finding it a little
more difficult to get interviews with all
of us right now. There's a move afoot to
actually step away from all of them.
1: Are you going to base yourself in Eng
land or Hollywood?
TR: I'm in L.A. My problem with stay
ing in L.A. is that the gun thing is a prob
lem for me. I have children, and I don't
want guns around my children. My chil
dren are American, and my wife is
American. I've been employed here,
and I've been treated incredibly well
here. But guns are still a problem. I don't
know what to do about it, except leave.
And I don't know if I want to go back to
Britain. I'll definitely be directing my
next film there anyway, but it's not a
place I want to live. But you have this
huge addiction to guns ovei here. I don't
want my kids to be the victim of a ran
dom bullet. It's just too easy to get guns.
The only gun law you can have is an ab
solute ban on guns. An absolute ban.
and they're not going to do that. Give
them amnesty, two years. All the guns
off the streets by two years, otherwise
it's a criminal act. Unless that's going to
happen, I don't know how anyone can
operate. Where else in the world does
this problem exist? It's not helped by
various bad actors' attitudes toward cer
tain gun organizations.
I: / noticed that nudity was treated very
liberally in"The War Zone." Is that a
difference between American and
British cinema?
TR: That's about this family. That's
about inappropriate behavior. There's
something wrong with this family. I

think there comes a time when you stop
taking your clothes off in front of your
children. There comes a time, and that
time has not happened in this family. So
we can look at it and go, "There's some
thing wrong here." The audience also
struggles with it. They struggle with their
feelings toward seeing those naked bod
ies considering the dilemma that the
characters are going through. I like that
the audience has a tough time with that.
They have an animal action to a naked
body. There is a natural reaction to a
naked human body. If your intentions
are good, it's OK. I want the audience to
examine what their intentions are.
1:1 was really interested in how you left

a lot of open-ended questions. You
mentioned that being part of your vi
sion.
TR: If I gave you answers, it might make
the problem go away in your minds. The
thing is not to do that; the thing is to ask
the questions. The danger with a film
like this is that it becomes relegated to
just being an issue film, and then people
can just dismiss it. By turning it into cin
ema as well as dealing with a sensitive
subject, then we can all go and discuss.
But if I give you an answer, if I give you
a solution, then it'll get lost, because you
can neatly package it and throw it away.
There are no answers to any of these
questions, only in specific cases. There
are no general answers.

Tim Roth, right, made a name for himself in Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs."
Tim Roth, a favorite of Quentin
Tarantino fans, recently made the transi
tion from acting to directing. His directo
rial debut, "The War Zone," has been in
limited release, buoyed by strong critical
acclaim. Intermission jumped at the op
portunity to speak with Roth about the
controversial thematic material of the film
as well as his thoughts on the film indus
try.
Intermission: How long had you been
thinking about directing before you
chose to direct "The War Zone?"
Tim Roth: I think since the beginning, re
ally. I mean I've been on the film set for
about 15 years, but I've been around di
rectors for about 20. I've always thought
it was a great job, but it wasn't my first
choice. My first choice would have been
cinematography, but that requires train
ing, and I'd have to go to college and start
all over again. I was already on track with
the acting thing. Directing, I just as
sumed, was sort of what I had grown up
to do. I was told by a lot of directors that
I should direct.
I: How easy was it to take over the tech
nical aspect of directing?
TR: I loved that bit. That was not diffi
cult. I knew a lot already. I knew what I
wanted to do with the frame and all that.
But then I hired these great technicians,
so if I have a question or a problem, I just
ask them, and they provide me with a so
lution. As long as I can be articulate
enough to get across what I want to emo
tionally put forward, they can give me a
million options and ways to do it, be
cause they are very good at what they do.
All the actors would just go back to their
trailer. I understand going back to your
trailer to have a sleep, if you haven't had
a good night's sleep the night before. But
there's so much going on; it's a fascinat
ing place.
I: Which of the directors that you worked
with most influenced you?
TR: I think the first one that I worked

see films that I was in. I was starting to
become a bit bored with it. I mean I just
wasn't interested anymore in what I was
doing. So I'm changing that. I've found
another job, something that maybe I was
supposed to do in the first place. Every
thing was training for doing this. But then

I'm going to go out and do something
completely different in the acting world
anyway.
I: / was interested in how you were work
ing with two untrained actors. Could
you talk more about the coaching you
had to give the actors, especially for the
big scene?
TR: They each required a different style
of direction — the actors and the non-ac
tors. To be honest with you, I thought it
was going to he that I would take two
young people that hadn't acted before,
and if I put them amongst really high
grade actors, it would rub off on them.
That was the case, but the opposite was
also true, that they rubbed off on the
["real") actors. I started to see that the
performances coming from the people
that had experience were of a much high
er caliber than they had ever given be
fore, because they were looking at these
two who've had no restrictions placed
upon them — these two weren't restrict
ed by experience — and were coming up
with some stuff that was real raw and real
intelligent. Those that had experience re
membered doing that when they started,
so they started to lose all the actor bulls
- that they'd learned and just tried to get
the characters right. It was a very good
mix, and I'm going to do it again.
I: The girl was spotted just shopping in a
market. Was she not even intending to
audition?
TR: No, she didn't know what we were
we up to. What the deal was that [the
casting people] would go to colleges, to
schools. The brief was: no actors. It was
just a certain age — an age for the boy
and an age for the girl, and that was it.
The casting people would also walk
around the street, and walk about and
just go up to people and say, "Do you
want to read fora film?" Most people
would say, "No, go away." But some
would say yes. I think they saw 4() that
way. And she was one of that group. She
thought we were going to steal her purse,
and she said, "Yeah, I'll do that." They
gave her the script immediately. I saw a
picture of her, a Polaroid, and I said,
"That's looking right. Give her the script

to read." She looked completely differ
ent than what she looks in the film.
I: What was the age of the boy's charac
ter in the movie?
TR: Sixteen, that was how old he was. 1
thought I'd go younger, but it would have
been very difficult as far as hours that
you can work with someone so young. 1
actually liked him being in complete hor
monal turmoil, anyway. His character
was really withdrawn.
I: Did he have to work on that?
TR: No, I made him like that. He's a kid
that's not that way. I wanted him to be a
little different going into it.
I: What did you guys do to calm every
body after the day?
TR: It was party central. It was, absolute
ly. We had a budget put aside for
parties — parties every weekend, every
night meeting in the pub, practical jokes
constantly on set. The crew were cast and
auditioned like actors would. Anyone
that started moaning was fired. They
were written a really good letter of rec
ommendation, but they were immediate
ly fired. Because you can't have that
around these people — everyone's gotta
want to come to work. It's tough. And it
was tough, but it was also fun. It was a
great experience for those people. I de
signed it that way.
I: You mentioned that you've verified the
reality of the abusive situations in the
movie. You did so with experts on
abuse?
TR: Many victims worked on this film.
I've been taking it around the world and
doing question and answer sessions after
screenings. There have been a lot of peo
ple who have worked with pedophiles
and victims. They've absolutely ap
proved of the film. Also, victims have
seen it, and we always get a great re
sponse from them. It's the critics you've
got to watch. We recently took it to a con
ference of 1,50() people who deal with the
subject and are specialists.
I: And the response was good?
TR: Yeah. Absolutely fabulous. I think


Rolf Konow — Cinecom
they all end up using it as a tool. This
conference was in Madison, Wis. There
was no press allowed — we wouldn't let
anyone near it. So actually people were
open in conversation. The problem is,
I've had to change my method of doing
[0 and A] because sometimes some
body will start talking for the first time,
and it will be in the press the next day.
That's not fair. So if I know journalists
are in the audience—journalists may
be victims and also might be abusers —
they're fair game, but 1 have to let every
one know. They're not exactly the most
trustworthy people, generally, because
they are looking fora story. If they are
going to speak, they have to be aware
that they are speaking possibly more
publicly than they want to. We've had
the opposite, too. We've had absolutely
furious people, leaving screaming and
shouting. That happened once in Toron
to. I say, if you're going to leave, leave
quietly. Respect other people's rights to
see the movie.
I: At these Q and A sessions, are you in
the audience, watching people's reac
tions?
TR: After the film, I'd sit and talk about
anything. Except if there are journalists
there, then it all gets shut down, and the
nature of it changes. The ones without
journalists are extraordinary, they really
are. I'm not against journalists at all, but
they tend to not realize that they have an
extreme responsibility. There's a guy
that 1 know, a very famous actor, who
punched the s— out of a journalist once
because the journalist had not only
wrecked his wedding day by announcing
the location, the date and the time, but
had then gone on and found his mother,
who he was having serious problems
with since he was a little kid, and got her
to sell her story. Not only did he get
beaten by this actor, but then he got beat
up by the actor's wife as well, and then
another friend of mine jumped in. Then
he left the country, but we know where
he lives. He still hasn't apologized.
I: Is there a difference between Ameri

can journalism and British journalism?
TR: I actually have been treated better
by the press here. The journalists in my
own country tend to hide behind a sort
of liberal faqade, apart from the lunatics,
the tabloids. The British are very
strange. They also always try and de
stroy anyone of their own that has had
any success. They went for Gary [Old
man); they've gone fora whole bunch of
us. And they don't expect we would go
for them. I think they're finding it a little
more difficult to get interviews with all
of us right now. There's a move afoot to
actually step away from all of them.
1: Are you going to base yourself in Eng
land or Hollywood?
TR: I'm in L.A. My problem with stay
ing in L.A. is that the gun thing is a prob
lem for me. I have children, and I don't
want guns around my children. My chil
dren are American, and my wife is
American. I've been employed here,
and I've been treated incredibly well
here. But guns are still a problem. I don't
know what to do about it, except leave.
And I don't know if I want to go back to
Britain. I'll definitely be directing my
next film there anyway, but it's not a
place I want to live. But you have this
huge addiction to guns ovei here. I don't
want my kids to be the victim of a ran
dom bullet. It's just too easy to get guns.
The only gun law you can have is an ab
solute ban on guns. An absolute ban.
and they're not going to do that. Give
them amnesty, two years. All the guns
off the streets by two years, otherwise
it's a criminal act. Unless that's going to
happen, I don't know how anyone can
operate. Where else in the world does
this problem exist? It's not helped by
various bad actors' attitudes toward cer
tain gun organizations.
I: / noticed that nudity was treated very
liberally in"The War Zone." Is that a
difference between American and
British cinema?
TR: That's about this family. That's
about inappropriate behavior. There's
something wrong with this family. I

think there comes a time when you stop
taking your clothes off in front of your
children. There comes a time, and that
time has not happened in this family. So
we can look at it and go, "There's some
thing wrong here." The audience also
struggles with it. They struggle with their
feelings toward seeing those naked bod
ies considering the dilemma that the
characters are going through. I like that
the audience has a tough time with that.
They have an animal action to a naked
body. There is a natural reaction to a
naked human body. If your intentions
are good, it's OK. I want the audience to
examine what their intentions are.
1:1 was really interested in how you left

a lot of open-ended questions. You
mentioned that being part of your vi
sion.
TR: If I gave you answers, it might make
the problem go away in your minds. The
thing is not to do that; the thing is to ask
the questions. The danger with a film
like this is that it becomes relegated to
just being an issue film, and then people
can just dismiss it. By turning it into cin
ema as well as dealing with a sensitive
subject, then we can all go and discuss.
But if I give you an answer, if I give you
a solution, then it'll get lost, because you
can neatly package it and throw it away.
There are no answers to any of these
questions, only in specific cases. There
are no general answers.


Miramax Films
Tim Roth, right, made a name for himself in Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs."
Tim Roth, a favorite of Quentin
Tarantino fans, recently made the transi
tion from acting to directing. His directo
rial debut, "The War Zone," has been in
limited release, buoyed by strong critical
acclaim. Intermission jumped at the op
portunity to speak with Roth about the
controversial thematic material of the film
as well as his thoughts on the film indus
try.
Intermission: How long had you been
thinking about directing before you
chose to direct "The War Zone?"
Tim Roth: I think since the beginning, re
ally. I mean I've been on the film set for
about 15 years, but I've been around di
rectors for about 20. I've always thought
it was a great job, but it wasn't my first
choice. My first choice would have been
cinematography, but that requires train
ing, and I'd have to go to college and start
all over again. I was already on track with
the acting thing. Directing, I just as
sumed, was sort of what I had grown up
to do. I was told by a lot of directors that
I should direct.
I: How easy was it to take over the tech
nical aspect of directing?
TR: I loved that bit. That was not diffi
cult. I knew a lot already. I knew what I
wanted to do with the frame and all that.
But then I hired these great technicians,
so if I have a question or a problem, I just
ask them, and they provide me with a so
lution. As long as I can be articulate
enough to get across what I want to emo
tionally put forward, they can give me a
million options and ways to do it, be
cause they are very good at what they do.
All the actors would just go back to their
trailer. I understand going back to your
trailer to have a sleep, if you haven't had
a good night's sleep the night before. But
there's so much going on; it's a fascinat
ing place.
I: Which of the directors that you worked
with most influenced you?
TR: I think the first one that I worked
with on film, which was Alan Clarke —

he's an English director. He was extra
ordinary. And then, I've worked with
some really good people. But I think the
bad directors that I've worked with are
the strongest influences, because to be
directed by someone badly is an abomi
nation. It's a very tough lesson to learn,
but it's a good one to learn. They would
be the biggest influences, really, and I've
worked with a lot of bad directors. I
mean, maybe in films that you think are
good, but the directors were atrocious.
I: As far as acting, what has been your
favorite role?
TR: "Made in Britain" [directed by Alan
Clarke]. Just because it was the begin
ning, and it was a real great set to be on. I
look at it now, as I saw it quite recently,
and it was very naive, but that's probably
what was good about it. I could just see
me working stuff out about acting while
it was going on. Some of it worked, and
some of it didn't, but overall [it worked].
It wasn't my best performance, but it's
the one I like best.
I: How did you get picked for "Made in
Britain?"
TR: I was looking fora bicycle pump at
the time, at this theater that I worked at.
And they said, "We don't have a pump,
but there are these auditions going on
this week if you want to go." And I did,
and I got the job. That gave me the confi
dence to take non-actors and put them
into this film. And not only in the film,
but also in incredibly challenging roles,
more so than they will probably ever ex
perience in their lives as actors, I would
imagine.
I: It seems like you've fallen out of love
with acting. Is that true?
TR: I 've fallen out of love with aspects of
it. Certainly not all of it. I love actors, es
pecially considering what these guys
went through. But I just stopped going to
see films that I was in. I was starting to
become a bit bored with it. I mean I just
wasn't interested anymore in what I was
doing. So I'm changing that. I've found
another job, something that maybe I was
