Tim Roth's directorial debut, "The War Zone," is completely unlike the vi
olent crime movies that made him famous. The subject matter of incestual
child molestation itself makes the movie an ambitious one.
Roth doesn't think like that, though. As he introduced the movie at a press
screening, he declared that "The War Zone" was what cinema is to him and that
he was presenting us with his vision.

Wow. What a vision it is. Undoubtedly, the
subject matter will overshadow discussions of his di
rectorial prowess because of its deep roots within all
of our shadows. People may have violent reactions,
but then again the movie may also prove cathartic, as
it already has at some of the advance screenings.
But hopefully his skill won't be overlooked.
For an actor taking over the directorial reigns, his

technical skill was surprising. He also coached amazing performances out of his
cast, which included a couple of First timers in Lara Belmont and Freddie Cunliffe.
Belmont plays the molested 17-year-old Jessie incredibly. Her emotions all feel
raw, her reactions believable and her situation inconceivable. Cunliffe plays the
main character of the movie, her 16-year-old brother Tom and the discoverer of
the nature of the relationship between his sister and his father. His reality is one of
adolescent discomfort compounded by the move from London to unknown
Devon — a fragile reality that gets shattered by his discovery.
Both actors were discovered unconventionally. Belmont was shopping, while
Cunliffe was accompanying a friend to the mass auditions they held in England.
Both were stunning in their debuts, and Roth's coaching had a bit to do with it. Any
director that can bring a young girl convincingly through some of the scenes that
"The War Zone" puts forth deserves major kudos. That Roth did so on his first try
is just ridiculous.
Visually, Roth was amazing. He presents the English countryside as the family,
straight from London, would probably see it. Huge, panoramic shots with Tom or
Jessie dwarfed by their surroundings give us the incredible bleakness of the Eng
lish shore. The rookie director also uses visual metaphor well, as the family house
looks boarded up by virtue of lighting. Much of the "action" also occurs at a bunker
on the rocky coastline, which feels like another appropriate symbol for the war rip
ping the family apart.
"The War Zone" is also successful in that it poses more questions than it does
answers. Roth felt he didn't want to wrap the issue up comfortably, as it was an un
comfortable issue. You can't leave this movie without a racing mind, and you won't
be able to avoid discussing the many unanswered issues. Jessie declares to Tom at
a crucial moment between them, "You want everything to be nice and sweet, but
it isn't," and this gets at the heart of the movie.
If you put the effort in and care about this movie, you will receive. Otherwise,
you will be overwhelmed by all the questions about the depth of the character's de
pravity and awareness, and you may leave early — as many have done at screen
ings.
The only reason not to see this movie is if you feel like seeing some frivolous
waste of two hours. It is hard to see a movie like "The War Zone," and it definite
ly is not a family night at the movies. But otherwise, raise some questions! Make
yourself uncomfortable! Think!
