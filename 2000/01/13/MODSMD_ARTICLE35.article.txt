liance with the strong, character-driven
drama that just completely blew me away.
I: It must have been very difficult to whittle
down a 500-pius-page hook into a feature
film length script.
SH: Yes, and there were certain things I
wanted to do. I didn't want to have
voiceover. I wanted to have the Japanese-
American point of view, not just Ishmael.
So I did a lot of work on re-writing it to fit
my vision of the film.

Rarely does Intermission get the opportunity to interview
a top person in the media — let alone two. First, Intermis
sion talks with "Snow Falling on Cedars"director Scott
Hicks, the force behind the critically praised "Shine."
Intermission: I want to congratulate you on your new
film, and I would like to ask you what attracted you to
the project? How involved were you in the process of
turning it into a script?
Scott Hicks: Well, I read the hook actually. I hadn't even
finished "Shine" yet. It was late in 1995, and I was in Or
lando prepping a documentary that I was planning for
the Discovery Channel. At the airport newsstand, one of
my colleagues drew me to the hook. I read it on the flight
home, and i was completely captivated by it. It was like
another world. It was a whole world that I knew nothing
about, and I was immersed in the details, in the story. I
guess it was a braid of three different mysteries: the love,
the trial and the story of what happened during the war
to the Japanese. It was really the combination of that bril-

I: That's one of the things I like most about the film, that
you didn't explain every little thing with voice-over. /
don't think I have ever seen a film where the main char
acter has so little dialogue; but it came off beautifully.
SH: Once I had taken out the voice-over, you are left
with a very solitary character who has little interaction
with people. It was creating a challenge for Ethan
[Hawke], one that 1 think he rose to incredibly. There
were scenes like the one where Ishmael drops Hatsue off
with her father, in the blizzard, and it just wasn't working.

In its examination of Japanese-American relations,
'Snow Falling on Cedars' is a rare Hollywood release.

So I said, "Look, this isn't happening, what do we do?"
And we decided to play it without the dialogue. Both
Ethan and Youki [Kudoh) loved that. The scene wassud
dcnly so much more powerful.
I: You understand more about the character even though
you are hearing less. Just like the flashbacks that ex
plain so much without really saying anything.
SH: Yeah, that's exactly what the story is about. It's
about memory, about the way your mind works as much
as anything. Here you have a situation that looks like a
courtroom drama, but it's not. The courtroom is actually
the time present where everybody is gathered together,
and they are forced to confront their memory. For Ish
mael, he is confronting his memory up in the balcony,
staring down through the bars in this little cage, looking
back at the past almost literally. It seemed to me more
about memory than the details about the trial. The court
room is the perfect environment for that.
I: You use the silence well even in the courtroom, too, be
cause it comes almost as a jolt to hear Kazuo speak with
an American accent when he opens his mouth toward
the end of thefilm. It drives home the impression that the
non-Japanese community had of the Japanese.
SH: Yes. This impression of the silent Japanese, like a
Samurai sitting there. And when he opens his mouth, he
is wholly American. I was trying to show that he is a part

of the community.
1: Was it a struggle to portray that complexity in such a
visual film?
SH: Sometimes I think it's play. Television has made us
so used to constant talking, expressing every single thing
we feel. Most of the time when we communicate verbal
ly we are not really saying what we feel, what we think.
So there is a much more powerful language in looks,
glances, body language and attitude. It is a lot more cine
matic, the power of image and what the image conveys, i

used to do a thing when 1 was a student of watching TV
with the volume off and still being able to tell the story. It
is a test of whether it is a good film or not if you can tell
the story without the sound.
I: You seem to deliberately use very few colors in the
film, and / noticed you mostly stick to green and brown
and white. How did you develop the palette that you
used for the film?
Sli: It was mostly my impression of the environment in
the book. The story is very dark, dank and overcast. How
the snow and the snowstorm make everything mono
chromatic. When 1 first started talking to Bob Richard
son, the cinematographer, we would go through all these
books of stills together trying to find a common language.
He devised a bleach bypass process that actually seems to
narrow the spectrum where you get these dense, rich
blacks and silvery whites.
I: The visuals were incredible, especially the opening
scene in the fog that gives you such a sense of the place
and the time. What did you do with that scene? Was it a
sound stage?
SH: What I wanted the scene to be was emblematic of the
whole film — nothing is that which it appears to be. You
gradually get closer and closer until you eventually shed
light on it. "What is that? Oh, is that a boat? Is that a
face?" 1 wanted the whole movie to be a mystery like
