liance with the strong, character-driven
drama that just completely blew me away.
I: It must have been very difficult to whittle
down a 500-pius-page hook into a feature
film length script.
SH: Yes, and there were certain things I
wanted to do. I didn't want to have
voiceover. I wanted to have the Japanese-
American point of view, not just Ishmael.
So I did a lot of work on re-writing it to fit
my vision of the film.

Rarely does Intermission get the opportunity to interview
a top person in the media — let alone two. First, Intermis
sion talks with "Snow Falling on Cedars"director Scott
Hicks, the force behind the critically praised "Shine."
Intermission: I want to congratulate you on your new
film, and I would like to ask you what attracted you to
the project? How involved were you in the process of
turning it into a script?
Scott Hicks: Well, I read the hook actually. I hadn't even
finished "Shine" yet. It was late in 1995, and I was in Or
lando prepping a documentary that I was planning for
the Discovery Channel. At the airport newsstand, one of
my colleagues drew me to the hook. I read it on the flight
home, and i was completely captivated by it. It was like
another world. It was a whole world that I knew nothing
about, and I was immersed in the details, in the story. I
guess it was a braid of three different mysteries: the love,
the trial and the story of what happened during the war
to the Japanese. It was really the combination of that bril-

I: That's one of the things I like most about the film, that
you didn't explain every little thing with voice-over. /
don't think I have ever seen a film where the main char
acter has so little dialogue; but it came off beautifully.
SH: Once I had taken out the voice-over, you are left
with a very solitary character who has little interaction
with people. It was creating a challenge for Ethan
[Hawke], one that 1 think he rose to incredibly. There
were scenes like the one where Ishmael drops Hatsue off
with her father, in the blizzard, and it just wasn't working.

In its examination of Japanese-American relations,
'Snow Falling on Cedars' is a rare Hollywood release.

So I said, "Look, this isn't happening, what do we do?"
And we decided to play it without the dialogue. Both
Ethan and Youki [Kudoh) loved that. The scene wassud
dcnly so much more powerful.
I: You understand more about the character even though
you are hearing less. Just like the flashbacks that ex
plain so much without really saying anything.
SH: Yeah, that's exactly what the story is about. It's
about memory, about the way your mind works as much
as anything. Here you have a situation that looks like a
courtroom drama, but it's not. The courtroom is actually
the time present where everybody is gathered together,
and they are forced to confront their memory. For Ish
mael, he is confronting his memory up in the balcony,
staring down through the bars in this little cage, looking
back at the past almost literally. It seemed to me more
about memory than the details about the trial. The court
room is the perfect environment for that.
I: You use the silence well even in the courtroom, too, be
cause it comes almost as a jolt to hear Kazuo speak with
an American accent when he opens his mouth toward
the end of thefilm. It drives home the impression that the
non-Japanese community had of the Japanese.
SH: Yes. This impression of the silent Japanese, like a
Samurai sitting there. And when he opens his mouth, he
is wholly American. I was trying to show that he is a part

of the community.
1: Was it a struggle to portray that complexity in such a
visual film?
SH: Sometimes I think it's play. Television has made us
so used to constant talking, expressing every single thing
we feel. Most of the time when we communicate verbal
ly we are not really saying what we feel, what we think.
So there is a much more powerful language in looks,
glances, body language and attitude. It is a lot more cine
matic, the power of image and what the image conveys, i

used to do a thing when 1 was a student of watching TV
with the volume off and still being able to tell the story. It
is a test of whether it is a good film or not if you can tell
the story without the sound.
I: You seem to deliberately use very few colors in the
film, and / noticed you mostly stick to green and brown
and white. How did you develop the palette that you
used for the film?
Sli: It was mostly my impression of the environment in
the book. The story is very dark, dank and overcast. How
the snow and the snowstorm make everything mono
chromatic. When 1 first started talking to Bob Richard
son, the cinematographer, we would go through all these
books of stills together trying to find a common language.
He devised a bleach bypass process that actually seems to
narrow the spectrum where you get these dense, rich
blacks and silvery whites.
I: The visuals were incredible, especially the opening
scene in the fog that gives you such a sense of the place
and the time. What did you do with that scene? Was it a
sound stage?
SH: What I wanted the scene to be was emblematic of the
whole film — nothing is that which it appears to be. You
gradually get closer and closer until you eventually shed
light on it. "What is that? Oh, is that a boat? Is that a
face?" 1 wanted the whole movie to be a mystery like

that, and gradually it all coalesces together and falls into
focus. Like those 3D posters that take you forever to see.
I think people gradually surrender and see it.
I: How did you end up casting Ethan and the rest of the
actors?
SH: Casting is a major part of the job, and 1 love putting
it all together. Ethan was really hungry for the role. He
made a big play for it; he came out from New York. We
talked about it at great length, and he really impressed
me with his sincerity, dedication and eagerness. It was a
surprisingenvironment for me in L.A. There are all these
young actors, and you get their agents saying "Oh, is this
an offer?" I say, "Not yet," and they say, "Oh, 1 won't let
you read him without an offer." So 1 say, "Ok, no
thanks." And then there is Ethan, who has been in
movies half his life, and he actually came out there to talk
to me, so I said, "That's what I need." 1 don't need some
sort of vanity thing. You need to give yourself over to the
process. A lot of the other cast, like the Japanese Amer
icans, were difficult to find. There doesn't seem to be a
big pool of Asian-American talent that wanted to be
emotionally exposed in that way. So I pulled Youki out
of Tokyo. She had been in a small movie, and she had this
amazing access to her emotions and a delicacy to her.
I: Being from Australia, did you have to do a lot of re
search on the post-war atmosphere in America?
SH: As an outsider, I was so aware of the possibility of
creating a cultural blunder. 1 was educated on the cul
ture. and I had people hunt out hundreds of photographs
from the Japanese camps. Not just to get the hats right,
but to get the feeling of what was in those photographs. I
carry them around with my script as reminders of not
only the detail but the feeling. It was very important to
recreate the event as if we were there, in the way Ansel
Adams and photographers who were commissioned by
the government to take those photographs would cap
ture them. The point was not so you can feel guilt; it was
just so you can realize this shouldn't have happened and
this should never happen.
Now, Intermission puts David Guterson, the author of
"Snow Falling on Cedars," on the spot about his thoughts
on the film and the book.
I: How long did the hook take you to write?
DC: I spent a couple of years just thinking about it. I had
a couple of aborted attempts. I stopped and wrote an
other thing. Then I got distracted by teaching. It was

more of a hobby than anything, so it took about 10 years.
I: What is your impression of thefilm? Was it difficult to
watch them cut parts out of the book?
David Guterson: The difficulties of turning a novel into a
film are something you accept. It is a false expectation to
think that everything you write in the novel is going to be
seen in the film. You want to honor the essence of the
novel on which it is based, but you don't want to have
such a strong allegiance to it that you undermine the in
tegrity of the film. My role was not to regurgitate the
novel, but to participate in the process that was honoring
the novel. It put me in a position to be of service to the di
rector.
I: The director of "LA. Confidential" said that the role
of the author in the making of his work into a movie is
to keep his mouth shut. How much participation did you
have in it?
DG: A lot of writers just sell the rights and walk away,
thankful that they paid you. If you don't like it, you can
just take your name out of the credits. The other option
is to immerse yourself in the process even though you
don't have any real control in how it turns out. It is a very
odd role in a relationship to your own story. It could have
been an odd feeling, except that from the beginning, the
director and I were of like mind. If Scott Hicks hadn't
come to me right at the outset, and if I hadn't quickly de
termined that he and I were kindred spirits, I probably
would have just walked away and just let it be whatever
it is.
I: You've gotta feel good about the fact that this film is
in Oscar position.
DG: 1 feel great about this film. I really think the story
matters; I think it does positive work and more. It makes
an important contribution to our shared life. A lot of peo
ple who walk out of the theater will be prompted to re
flect on their inner life, on the way cause and effect work.
I: Do you have any ambition or dream of seeing this
book becoming something that is studied as a classic?
DG: The interesting thing is, increasingly it is. It has
shown up on many high school and college curriculums
already. It is very teachable and lends itself to both histo
ry and English departments. The thought that it will be
read by generations to come is wonderful.
I: / know you probably got a lot of (he ideas for the story
from liainbridge Island, where you live, and the people

you are surrounded by. Is the book based on people you
know?
DG: I was born on Puget Sound and have spent my life
there, and I live in a community where the internment of
Japanese Americans is the seminal factor of our commu
nal life. It seemed to me incredibly fertile ground for sto
rytelling. Here is a net of great sweeping historical mag
nitude that permeated the lives of these people. Some of
my students are the children of people who had been in
terned. Everybody remembered this and was haunted by
it. To me, it was an incredibly romantic possibility for sto
rytelling. Also, I started this novel the quarter after I was
teaching "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Romeo and Juli
et" in high school. I think you can definitely see the in
fluence of those stories on my novel.
I: When the novel first came out, you talked about "To
Kill a Mockingbird" and said you have a debt to it.
DG: The thing about that book is that people have re
sponded with an incredible amount of depth of emotion
to that story, and it has left an indelible impression on
people. I have seen students who years later tell me they
have not forgotten that story. I think it shapes their sen
sibilities and their values. There are all kinds of works of
literature that shape people. It's one of the great things
that stories do — you become a part of the inner life of
the individuals. And "To Kill a Mockingbird" is one of
those books that becomes a part of people's world views.
I told myself that when it came time to write my own
novel, that I would want to write one with that kind of im
pact. I didn't want to write a book just to write one or just
to entertain. I wanted to make a book that would seize
people and become a part of their humanity.
I: How have the people from Bainbridge Island reacted
to your novel, and what kind of an audience were you
imagining as you wrote the book?
DG: I have always considered my audience to be literate
human beings from the present and the future. There is
something sort of universal about my books. They are
something people 1 (K) years from now could grasp. I
don't write for the intellegencia or to be respected by the
academia, just to catch the attention of critics. 1 write for
people. I take that view of my audience. The people of
Bainbridgc Island are thrilled. They feel like their story
is being told in the culture at large. We know that we ex
perienced something special, and to communicate that to
the world, and for me to be the communicator of that is
really great. Satisfying.
