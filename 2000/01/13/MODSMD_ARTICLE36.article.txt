# An epic adaptation of a best-selling novel
## 
### 
Scott Hicks' "Snow Falling on Cedars," based on David Guterson's book, is a vi
sual feast and a moving, deeply emotional story. The film is a courtroom drama,
a love story and a historical observation of the Japanese internment during World
War 11. all wrapped with cinematographic mastery into two gripping hours that follow
a murder,'flashbacks to a tragic romance and the racial tensions that tore apart the fic-

tional Puget Sound town of San Piedro during
the war.
"Cedars" is likely to put Hieks in the run
ning for more Oscar nominations despite the
mixed reviews it is receiving, and it will hope
fully draw more readers to enjoy David Outer
son's novel, which has already topped best
seller lists since it came out five years ago. The

common frustration of seeing a wonderful hook turned into a bland movie is not an
issue here, as Hicks transfers the essence of the novel into something quite incredible.
Don't expect this to be anything like his last film, "Shine." which gave Hicks the
weight he needed in Hollywood to put "Cedars" onto the big screen. "Cedars" is
unique in that it is an entirely inward story that is told with very little dialogue and a lot
of achromatic, mood-infused scenery of the Pacific Northwest. I he landscape and
dream-like memories of youth are utilized to describe the inward world of Ishmael
(Ethan Hawke), who is watching Kazuo (Rick Yune), the husband of Hatsue (Youki
Kudoh) — the woman whom he has loved since childhood — go on trial for murder.

Ishmael is in an interesting situation: he is a newspaper reporter who has the power
tosliupe the public's view of the trial and also comes across information that might help
the jury favor Kazuo. The racially weighted trial is clearly unfair, and it is up to Ishmael
to overcome his lifetime love for Hatsue if justice is to he served. The mystery of the
murder itself unfolds for the audience just as it does for Ishmael, which is another rea
son why this is not another mindless Hollywood adaptation.
Hicks allows the audience to sit in on the trial as if it were there, and the audience is
put in an unusual position in that it knows absolutely nothing more than the characters
do (which if you think about it, is unusual fora film). We follow Ishmael internally
through his flashbacks by watching him experience events externally with virtually no
voiceover, so the audience is left to think for itself. Quite a concept.
As David Guterson suggested, this story was inspired by a rough mix of "To Kill a
Mockingbird" and " Romeo and Juliet." Guterson went on to state that he considers his
work in the ranks of these classics — which I wouldn't quite agree with — but the adap
tation of his story is worth seeing even if only for the beautiful visual impressions of the
Puget Sound. The film is enhanced further by excellent acting from the entire cast,
which manages to tell a story with few words — a difficult task.
Be prepared to leave the theater in an altered state if you see "Snow Falling on
Cedars." It will take you through several time warps and into a dark world brought to
light by truth and love, which Ishmael redefines for himself by the end of the story.
