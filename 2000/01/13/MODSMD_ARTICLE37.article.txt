## A 						passionate 'Affair' to remember 
### 
Based on the somewhat autobio
graphical Graham Greene ro
mance, "The End of the Affair" is
a noble but soppy attempt at contrasting
pure love and its distant cousin, jealous
love. The simplicity to the plot is the sav
ing grace of the film, which overdoes
everything else.
The story follows flashbacks to an af
fair between the unhappily married
Sarah Miles (Julianne Moore) and the

obsessively jealous — but sexy — Mau
rice Bendrix (Ralph Fiennes). Sarah's
clueless husband Henry (Steven Rea)
does not realize that his wife is unsatisfied
with their sexless marriage until she has
left him. After their first sexual en
counter, Sarah responds to Maurice's
concerns that Henry might have heard
her moaning with the statement "he
wouldn't recognize the sound."
"The End of the Affair" itself begins
two years after the affair has ended, when
Maurice hires a private detective to stalk

Sarah be
cause he
never even
got close to
getting over
her. This
leads Mau
rice and the

audience to believe that Sarah is making
love with everyone from her doctor to her
priest.

After stealing her diary, however, the
story starts over from her point of view,
and we find out more than simply Mau
rice's cynical imagination. The strength
of the film lies in the moment when this
diary is opened, when we realize that re
ality may truly lie wholly in the eye of the
beholder.
While pondering the meaning of love
by showing its different embodiments,
"The End of the Affair" also has deep un
dercurrents of Catholic mysticism, some
thing quite rare and daring in cinema dur

ing an era where religion is more often
turned into an X-file or a Woody Allen
movie.
Despite a series of melodramatic love
scenes that are set during air raids, the
love story becomes increasingly believ
able toward the end of the film. Perhaps it
was simply due to a timid editor, but the
first hour of this film could have been cut
down to about 20 minutes.
It is difficult not to note the similarities

between Maurice in this story and the
character whom Fiennes played in"The
English Patient." Maurice is passionately
in love with a married woman who cheats
on her boring husband with him, and the
two become somewhat tragically bound
for life.
The two stories also conclude in a sim
ilar manner, and although director Neil
Jordan does not create such obvious par
allels on purpose, it is difficult for some
one like me (who has seen "The English
Patient" four times) not to notice them

after a while.
Despite the fact that both Fiennes and
Moore are excellent actors, both seem
strained in their interactions, and this
makes the believability of their love affair
and the sacrifices they make for each
other far less effective than they could be.
I am a big fan of a good, steamy sex scene,
but "The End of the Affair" chooses to
opt for an abundance of bad ones be
tween two characters who lacked the out-

of-bed chemistry needed to make the
screen melt.
There are frustrating moments when
the flaws of the film become obvious and
almost laughable. Still, "The End of the
Affair" is worth seeing. The religious
qualities of the film are not nauseatingly
obvious, and there is a very inspiring mes
sage about sacrifice in the story that re
vives a faith in purity and true love from
the first part of the film.
