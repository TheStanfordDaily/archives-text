Any film based on a book is at an immediate disad
vantage because the odds are 10 to one that the
hxxik is better than the movie. However, I must
commend "Mansfield Park" for both doing justice to the
early 19th-century book and being a splendid movie in its
Ll /I A II A

own right (but you really must
read the book).
The genius of this
movie is its difficult balance be
tween comedy and real depth,
which on the whole is executed
beautifully. The film is not as
lightheaded as some of Jane
Austen's other works, but it

does well not to be so. There is signifieant use of dark light
mirroring the evils of slavery and snobbery, but thankfully
this technique does not interfere with the romantic themes.
This is the story of Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor), a
ptxir niece who moves into the English house of her wealthy

uncle, Thomas Bertram. The members of the household — Mrs. Bertram, their spoiled
son Tom, their moral son Edmund, the daughters Miss Maria and Julia — treat Fanny
as snobby people treat poor relations. That is, all except her cousin Edmund (Jonny Lee
Miller), who is the very kind and slightly martyred younger son.
Their relationship contains the blossom of true friendship, a friendship which is of the
utmost importance to Fanny. Life becomes more interesting with the arrival of Henry
and Mary Crawford (Alessandro Nivola and Embeth Davidtz), independently wealthy
siblings.
Mary and Edmund have entered into an understanding, much to Fanny's dismay, and
Henry decides to torment Miss Fanny. But her angelic character and superior virtues
capture his heart unaware, and Fanny is forced to decide between Henry and her obvi-

ously doomed love for the engaged cousin Edmund.
The movie is much more interesting than this abbreviated
plot summary. O'Connor and Nivola really do a superb job.
More controversial issues, such as Sir Thomas' incestual at
traction toward Fanny, also bring this movie to a higher level.
Not only this, but there is a large preoccupation with sex
ual connotations. Sir Thomas, Edmund, Henry Crawford,
Mary Crawford and even Fanny's own father are all intent
on aggravating poor, inhibited Fanny. The lesbian relation
adds quite a unique perspective, not at all one I would infer
from the book. Yet it raises many questions about not only
homosexuality during the time period but about genetic at
tractions between families.
For the second unusual addition. I cite the emphasis on the
abolitionist movement and the English manner of slavery.
While regretfully ignored in the original novel, the point,
though a tad out of place, is well taken. The slavery theme
brought to mind the modern indifference to third-world
countries and other distant lands that are supposedly sup-

pressed and misused by large corporations.
As for the filming, I disliked the slow shots, which reasonably try to represent the
inner feelings of a character during some fractious moment but always seem to connote
a lack of technique. The camera swings a lot — down, up, slow, fast — in an effort to
highlight the emotions of the characters, which is understandable fora modern audience,
since Jane Austen is often portrayed as stiff. Yet this docs not add to the finesse of the
movie the way the shadows and dark light contribute a refined impression.
But for all my criticizing, "Mansfield Park" is an absolutely wonderful movie. All I
can say is when are the other Jane Austen films coming out?
