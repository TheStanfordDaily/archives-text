Capitalists: bad! The working man:

thought-provoking "Cradle Will Rock."

eral Theater
Project, one
of the many
organiza
tions that
fell under
Roosevelt's
Federal

Works Project. The FIT funds plays for
the hard-working American people, and
its latest play, "Cradle Will Rock," has
come under fire due to its controversial
subject matter: a pro-union, anti-capital
ist look at the 19305.
On the day of the play's opening, the
cast and crew arrive at the theater only to
be told that the show has been shut down,
and that as union members the actors are
forbidden to take the stage. But The Man
cannot stop art! The actors proceed with
the performance in another locale, rising
from their seats in the audience to accom
pany the composer, who sits alone on
stage with his piano.
Writer-director Robbins doesn't stop
there, weaving in too many subplots: the
actors' personal lives, the quest of a ven
triloquist and an FTP worker to weed out
the "Reds" from the art world and the
1937 conflict between Nelson Rockefeller
(John Cusack) and Diego Rivera (Ruben
Blades), whose commissioned mural in

Rockefeller Center
featured Lenin as the
cure to Depression
woes. We end up with
a superficial look at
just about every per
son — and his dog —
who lived during the
19305.
Subplots aren't the
only problem with
"Cradle Will Rock."
The viewer is need
lessly bombarded with
the continuous juxta
position of the life of
the workers (guod,
hardworking people!)
with that of the rich
capitalists {bad, idle
schemers!).
Subtle it isn't. For
example, while we see
the squalid living con
ditions of the various
artists, (bad) Rocke-

feller and other (bad) capitalists sit at a
gleaming table, discussing the possibility
of restructuring the ideals of the art world
by supporting only innocuous, politically
neutral art.
Meanwhile, Robbins' experienced
cast doesn't quite seem to know what to
do with the script: while Emily Watson
and John Turturro attempt sympathetic
portrayals of their characters, Vanessa
Redgrave (a clueless arts patron) and Cu
sack turn in entertainingly exaggerated
performances.
However, among the many Holly

wood stars who march and dance on be
half of "Cradle Will Rock," Bill Murray
stands out as an aging ventriloquist who is
funded by the FTP to give lessons to un
talented, aspiring comics.
Attempting to make a correlation be
tween the past and the present, the final
sequence transitions from the 1930s to a
brief flash of present day, neon-flushed
New York. What ever could this mean?
Bad capitalists still exist? There's a paral
lel between the troubles of the FI'P and,
say, the NEA? The government tries to
censor politically charged works?

Nah, too obvious, right?
In his preaching on behalf of the free
dom of art, expression and thought, Rob
bins misses the fact that he spends two
hours force-feeding us his movie, clutter
ing the screen with too many characters
and plot lines.
Thus, the only conclusion to which we
can arrive without his help is that it's too
bad Robbins' innocuous tale wasn't sup
pressed by the evil capitalist machine or
Bill Gates.
