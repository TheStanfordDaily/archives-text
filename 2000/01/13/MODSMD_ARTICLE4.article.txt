After more than six years of liti
gating on the University's behalf,
Stanford General Counsel Michael

Roster is step
ping down to
take on a job at
a major bank
ing group. I le is
handing over
his current po
sition to Debra
Zumwalt, who

will take over
as acting general counsel on Feb. \.
Roster. Class of 1%7 and Law
School Class of 1973, is headed for
Golden West Financial, a $5()-bil
lion Oakland banking firm, where
he will serve a management role in
addition to general counsel.
"This is sort of a surprise in many
ways. 1 had not been looking to do
anything else." Roster said.
Zumwalt said she is looking for
ward to taking over. "I 'm very excit
ed. .. Mike Roster's been a great
general counsel for Stanford.
They're big shoes to fill, but I'm
looking forward to the challenge of
working with inside and outside
lawyers all working for Stanford."
Roster said he has worked on a
number of memorable cases and is
sues during his tenure at Stanford.
For the first few years after he ar
rived in August 1993, much of Ros
ter's time was devoted to litigating
on behalf of Stanford during the in
direct-costs scandal, in which gov
ernment officials investigated the
University for misallocating federal
research funds. The University was
eventually cleared of the charges.
"Working through the indirect
costs controversy was quite chal
lenging." he said.
Another major area Roster dealt
with was the organization of the
Medical Center and Stanford Hos
pital.
"I started on Aug. I. 1993, and
(University President) Gerhard
Casper called me into his office al
most immediately [to deal with the
Medical Center]."
The following month. Roster
began working on the formation of
Stanford Health Services, the man

agement body created by Casper to
oversee clincial operations at the
Medical Center.
In 19% Roster was assigned to
work on the Medical Center's merg
er with UCSF to form UCSF-Stan
ford Health Care, and he was also
heavily involved with carrying out
the merger's recent dissolution due
to financial troubles.
Roster's work this year has also
focused on the controversy sur
rounding Stanford's Land Use Plan,
which has been met with opposition
by many neighbors and Santa Clara
County officials.
Under Roster's leadership, the
legal office has streamlined its oper
ations and reduced the number of
cases it takes on per year from more
than 250 when he first arrived to
roughly 1(H) at present.
Zumwalt currently works as the
managing partner at the Silicon Val
ley office of the nationwide law firm
PiUsbury Madison & Sutro.
I lowever, she has worked close
ly with Stanford's legal office for
several years, serving as the lead
lawyer for the indirect-costs litiga
tion and working for many years as
an in-house lawyer for Stanford.
This will facilitate the transition
process, according to Roster. "She
knows everything going on here
right now,'' he said.
Zumwalt, a member of the Law
School class of 1979. said Stanford is
filled with plenty of legal challenges
she is eager take on.
"There are always a lot of inter
esting and complex legal issues fac
ing Stanford, as our students and
faculty are doing things on the Iron
tiers of knowledge and the cutting
ledge of research." she said.
Zumwalt will hold the general
counsel post on an interim basis,
serving for the remainder of the aca
demic year. When the departing
Casper's replacement is installed as
president in August, he or she will
decide whether to retain Zumwalt.
Roster said the job he is leaving is
an expansive one. "Virtually every
thing that goes on at the University
comes through the legal office one
way or another. If it has any major
economic or business ramifications,
or is a complex problem, it's proba
bly here."
