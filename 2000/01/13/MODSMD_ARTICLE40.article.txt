# Jodie Foster stars in a revitalized 'The King and I'

It must have been an intimidating prospect try
ing to do "The King and I" without any of the
elements that made the original such an in
stant classic — namely, musical numbers, racial
stereotypes, white actors playing the major roles
and cloying heated romance. In the 1999 version,

' "Anna and the
King" has a leading
lady in Jodie Foster
who shows that like
Anna Leonowens,
the based-on-a-real
person English tutor
. to the Siamese royal

family, she's not intimidated by anything.
Foster stars next to Chow Yun-Fat, who seems
to he making a transition from action roles to
more dramatic fare with his role as King Mongkut
of mid-19th-century Siam.
In a tale drawn loosely from the diaries of the

real-life Anna Leonowens, the king summons the re
cently widowed tutor to teach his herd of children and a
few of his 20-odd wives and concubines English and the
ways of the world. For as Anna tells her own young son
early in the movie, "The ways of England are the ways of
the world." At first, at least, she's there to impress the fact
of English superiority on the backward royal family.
Predictably enough, the movie tells the story of
Anna's personal realization that English ways, while they
may be the ways of the world, aren't always the best ways.

Her gradual disillusionment with the chauvinist power
politics of her country's empire and increasing fascina
tion with Siam is spun out alongside the development of
an unspoken, unconsummated love for King Mongkut.
The two are held hack by the constraints of their posi
tions— Anna by her position as a proper English
woman, loyal to the Empire and to the memory of her
British officer husband, the king by the demands of rule
and the angry suspicions of reactionaries opposed to his
efforts to modernize and change the country.

The film's climax comes when one of these tra
ditionalists leads a treacherous attack on the king
and his family. When it becomes clear that the be
trayal is supported by the British, seeking to ex
pand their empire into the one sliver of Southeast
Asia that remains independent of colonial rule,
Anna is forced to question her personal loyalties
and the "ways of England" she once placed so
much faith in.
Director Andy Tennant deserves credit fora
movie free of the racism that could have easily
turned the movie into a "Jodie of the Jungle"
joke. Though the script gets bogged down in too
many sideplots that don't contribute much to the
action, the film moves along at a decent clip.
The king is portrayed as sophisticated and com
petent, if harsh, and the magnificent sets depict an
empire at a lush peak. At times, the movie swings
too far toward political correctness — the Eng
lish, with the exception of Anna, are portrayed as

haughty backstabbers with no real depth.
Interestingly, "Anna and the King" was banned in
ITiailand, where King Mongkut's Chakri Dynasty still
rules. The film, shot in Malaysia because Thai officials re
fused to allow location shoots, was deemed disrespectful
to the Thai king and his ancestors' memory. According to
censors, about 20 minutes needed to be cut before this
movie (which does drag) would be shown in Thailand.
