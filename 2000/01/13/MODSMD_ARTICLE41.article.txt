icle exploring war's futility.
Starring A1 Pacino,
Cameron Diaz, Dennis
Quaid and Jamie Foxx,
"Any Given Sunday" has
great chemistry among the
actors, who bring a decided
ly sober feel to the sport

and, more significantly, Oliver Stone's perception of
football's rich tradition.
The Miami Sharks rest at the end of a dynasty, much
like today's Dallas Cowboys. Once unbeatable, the for-

mer AFFA (Associated Football Franchises of Ameri
ca) champion Sharks are relegated to second-tier status.
The sports team is loaded with aging stars and selfish
players. Quaid plays a Dan Marino-esque 38-year-old
quarterback named Jack "Cap" Rooney, who has taken
a few too many hits to compete at the championship
level.
In one quarter of an important game, Quaid and the
second-string quarterback are injured, and third-string
wonder Willie "Steamin'" Beamin (Foxx), an unknown
on the national scene, enters the game. With hundreds of
thousands of eyes on him, Beamin chokes and chunks up
on the field. Not so good for the Sharks!

B u t
Willie
recov
ers and
shows
promise
that de
vel op s

throughout the season as he rebuilds the Sharks' playoff
hopes. However, this movie cannot be simply accepted
as a football movie with no other meaning. Returning to
Stone's passion, the game represents the extremes of war
and battle with a modern model. Players live large, and
the flashiest of all, Julian Washington (rapper-turned
actor L.L. Cool J), demonstrates how the riches afforded
by playing football can twist the value system of its play-

ers. ~ —-
With his character, Foxx, a former Texas high-school
quarterback himself, represents the purity that should be
prevelant in the game. Willie plays with an integrity miss
ing in Stone's romanticized football world, an integrity
that he suggests the authentic world of football lacks as
well.
Stone ambitiously attempts to connect the sport's past
with its present by blurring the distinctions of SO years of
athletic revolution. The uniforms resemble coats-of
arms, decorated with rich, deep colors and mystical sym
bols, such as the Dallas Knights' Celtic cross over the
breastplate.

At almost every critical snap,
of which there are seemingly
thousands in the movie, Willie
glances into the cheering crowd,
which eerily melts away into
retro-footage of crowds in black
and-white games long since
played and won. At first, the cine-

matic artistry is appealing, but by the 15th time the same
crowd view returns, you roll your eyes and wonder why
Stone couldn't have found more film clips.
Another weakness of the film is the incessant use of
slow motion. When football plays take longer than
Rambo's first escape from the jungle, you begin to won
der how any of the games ever finish. Of course, once you
realize this movie is as long as a real football game, you

have a new understanding of "slo-mo."
Cameron Diaz plays the beautiful Christina Pagniac
ci, a strong-wilted, busiaes^jninded heiress of the
Sharks' franchise.
So the final score on this flick? It'd be a 30 in Arena
Football, a 14 in the NCAA and a pair of field goals in the
NFL. See it if you love football or war movies.
1 liked it, most of the time. I could have used a half
time and maybe a hot date to pay attention to during the
subplots, but as far as football flicks go, "Any Given
Sunday" is worthwhile.
