# This 'Hurricane' is more like a portable fan

In "The Hurricane," Denzel Washington, much
like the character he portrays, faces insurmount
able odds: the plot is trite, the directing is
mediocre and the editing is even worse. Although
Washington's acting is superb, not even he can over
come these many obstacles. "The Hurricane" is a
long, manipulative and corny movie that has the un
canny ability to bore and annoy simultaneously.

"The Hurricane"
tells the true story of
Rubin "Hurricane"
Carter (Washington), a
middleweight boxer who
was wrongfully impris
oned on trumped up,
racist murder charges

during the '60s. Carter re
mains in prison for 20 years until a young African-
American kid named Lesra (Vicellous Shannon)
reads his autobiography and convinces his house
mates to fight for Carter's cause.
Lesra's housemates are three very strange Cana
dians who apparently found him on the streets of
Brooklyn and decided to take him back to Toronto.

According to Lesra, these housemates make a living
fixing up old houses, but we never see them do any
thing but act with patronizing kindness.
Equally confusing is their relationship with each
other. I spent most of the time trying to figure out
who was dating who. Is Lisa (Deborah Karah Unger)
dating Sam (Liev Schreiber) or Terry (John Han
nah)? Are the men dating each other? Are they all
just friends?
The director, Norman Jewison ("Moonstruck"),
left no clear indication either way. In one shot, Lisa
would be holding hands with Terry; in the next, with
Sam. There is even an insinuation of a developing re
lationship between Lisa and Carter.
The rest of the plot unravels like a made-for-TV
movie. "The Hurricane" follows a set formula offer
ing no surprises and very little insight into the logis
tics of Carter's case. Halfway through the movie,
Jewison inserts a fictional scene where Carter loses a
boxing match because of racist fight judges. Aren't
the details of Carter's life depressing enough?
I might have been able to live with all these other
problems had the cinematography been better. Yet
even this fell short. The boxing scenes come across as

a poorly executed rip-off of "Raging Bull." The shots
of the prison are glossy and unrealistic. Why, for ex
ample, would any prison switch from white to red
light at night? Is it supposed to help the inmates sleep
or simply drive them all insane?
The one redeeming aspect of the movie is Denzel
Washington's rousing performance in the title role.
A natural heavyweight, Washington lost around 60
pounds and trained extensively for the part. At
times, his solid acting job transforms his poorly
drawn, one-dimensional character into something
more.
Of particular note is a scene documenting Carter's
nine-month stint in solitary confinement. Washing
ton brilliantly captures the effects of such inhumane
imprisonment upon the soul. Through a clever use of
crosscutting, his mind becomes a battleground be
tween his violent and his self-pitying sides.
At the end of the movie, I couldn't help leaving
"The Hurricane" with a bad taste in my mouth. If
only Denzel Washington could learn to pick better
filmmakers.
