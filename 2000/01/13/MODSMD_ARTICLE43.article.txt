## Parisian art never looked so exotic 
### 
In the brightly lit rooms, the mingling French syllables help paint the atmosphere
warm, exotic, even exuberant. Soft accents and sparkling eyes are turned toward
the often unexpected, always unique paintings as a warm French breeze sweeps
through the Palo Alto gallery. It is the opening reception of "The Talk of Paris," a 1999
winter exhibition at La Galerie Internacionale that will conclude on Friday, Jan. 14.
To represent that French feeling are 14 international artists selected for their suc
cess in Paris. Most reside in France and have sent their artwork to the U.S. gallery.
While each opens up a different angle of the French story, most speak in the brilliant,

vibrant colors of the Provencal landscapes.
It is just as what the gallery's owners Linda and
Bernard Renot intended. "We were trying to open a
window of the warm side of France," said Linda, who
contacted Parisian Gallery "Everarts" for names of
contemporary French artists.
Finally, many custom checks later, the exquisite

works hung safely on the gallery walls basking in a protective light and admiration.
Jan Wroblewski, an art teacher in Krakow, Poland, has done much restoration of
antiques and frescoes and has participated in many 1999 French exhibitions. In her two
exhibited pieces, space becomes molded into concrete forms that acquire liveliness
through very particular use of color. The presence of occasional and eye-catching neon
orange in an otherwise calm, angular landscape adds an unexpected twist to an already
interesting landscape of forms.
Lydie Allaire, awarded first prize in a 1999 Versailles exhibit, reveals a refreshing
impressionistic style through her long brush strokes. Her paintings, including "Les
Genets," are ethereal yet very tangible with a summer's beauty in bright yellows,
greens and reds.
Jean-Claude Cure also employs vivid pigments, but his style embraces a modern
rather than Impressionist look. Art pieces resembling collages depict segments of
scenes from French seaport life. The texture of the land is evoked as the pieces unite to
become the veins of land and life. Images of fishing boats, next to fish and the map-like
segments of France, help set the mood, point to a location and paint a culture.
Anne Chesne's two pieces also capture a culture, but her thick Impressionist strokes
describe the bright and glowing Northern France rather than that of the fishermen. In
Chesne's "Fete Foraine" and "Fete Foraine I," the eye wanders amid the colors of the
lit-up night sky during a celebration.
The same is true of Albiolo's painting, where color unifies and describes the paint
ing. But with Albiolo's piece, the eye is also given passages to traverse using subtle tran
sitions from one color into another and layering techniques that cause the work to sug
gest without insisting. The final piece resists identification, forming a pastel world
where each twist introduces a new possibility, a new impression.
Joseph Guerin's pieces also enter into the world of imagination, only seemingly
from a child's perspective. Bright, primary colors and basic shapes compose a child's
playground. Also using the primary palette, Anita Maison departs from the concrete
into the surreal. In one of her pieces, "Tension," rigid lines show the process of creation
of greens as yellows blend with blues.
Two of the exhibited artists also attended the opening reception. Leningrad-born
Yuri Schiller and Svetlana Trumm work side by side in pastels in a large format. Using
careful manipulation of color with elongated features such as the head, their created
human forms gracefully curve space into fascinating forms. Undauntedly gazing at the
viewers, the beautifully molded figures are captivating in their unique, stylized beauty.
Patricia Miquau finds beauty through a dreamlike world series where human forms
dance in pastel purples, oranges and pinks and are enveloped by bubbles of imagina
tion that become a part of the sky.
Sylvie Kajman's iconic pieces depart from those of other artists through a general
use of darker colors that draw attention to the figures she portrays more than anything
else. They appear united in one space and simultaneously separate and detached from
one another. Questioning the destiny of the human race, Kajman tries to promote the
necessity of tolerance of differences and mutual respect. She believes that art is sacred
in that it addresses itself to the highest part of the human spirit.
Kajman's work highlights the need for the understanding of the human spirit, as the
other " The Talk of Paris" artists appeal to the human spirit to appreciate, learn and ex
perience a culture different from the observers'. Whether impressionist or more con
temporary, their skillfully created art encapsulates slices of Southern France and leaves
behind beautiful, warm and colorful afterimages.
