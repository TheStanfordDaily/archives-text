## The 						Heart-Hunter's Guide to Sexual Attraction 
### Roxy Sass Staff writer 
Rcccntly. Miss Sass has been entertained
by the courtship follies of her friends. Ro
mance is. for all intents and purposes, a game
complete with offensive and defensive ma
neuvers, advances and retreats, fakes, truces,
victories and defeats. There are common
strategies but no established rules, and par
ticipants give subtle signals that can easily be
misread.
The stakes are high. Naked emotions are
as vulnerable as the naked body, and a mis
calculation can result in rejection. The more a
the more he or she risks los
ing.
Consequently, in the early stages of ro
mance, couples dance around each other like
tentative boxers. And throughout the
process, each participant wonders whether
he is circling a partner or merely chasing after
that person's heels like a neglected puppy.
1 his is where Miss Sass poor friends are —
trying to get some while wondering if there
really is some to be had.
When you're in this anxiety-ridden stage,
your greatest adversary is yourself. You're
too close to everything happening around
you to see clearly, and your hypersensitivity
to your environment disrupts your instincts.
Actions that mean nothing assume huge sig
nificance, and obvious signals become hard
to read.
Hut thankfully, there are clues you can
look for. Of course, none of these signals
alone are clear indications of interest. That
would be too easy. But the more signals you
find, the greater your chances of romance.
On the flip side, if your prospective partner
isn't doing a darn thing, maybe you should
move on.
Pay attention to how your special some
one relates to your personal space. Does that
person sit a little too close? So close, perhaps,
that your legs accidentally touch? When you
speak does he or she lean in your direction?
Are the hands in an easy to see, easy to reach
location?
Look for changes in mannerisms. When
you talk, does that person mimic your move
ments? Does he or she compliment you? In
your company, does that person become
strangely loud, flustered or quiet?
Now does that person respond to you?

When you're with your prospective, does that
person hold your gaze a tad too long, or is he
or she incapable of meeting your eyes? Does
your someone return your smile with a huge
grin or a blush?
Notice the little things — they conceal big
meanings. Flushed skin and dilated pupils in
dicate arousal. Finicking reveals tension.
And when people lick or chew their lips, they
are often thinking about something more
sensual than the conversation at hand.
People like to look sexy for their special
someone. When you meet, do your honey's
clothes look nice and maybe newly donned?
If your prospective is a woman, is her make
up fresh and her hair recently brushed? Can
you nmuii puriunip or cologne? When he or
she speaks, do you get a whiff of toothpaste or
mouthwash?
Can you identify these behaviors in your
self?
People seek out the company of those they
like. Does your interest stop by when there's
nothing to say'' Does he or she stay too long?
When you're in a crowd, does this person
seem to somehow always stand next to you?
If you hug goodbye, does the hug linger?
Look for changes in your sweetie's behav
ior. You want sign that your special some
one has recognized you and made a distinc
tion between you and the rest of the herd.
Remember, your someone has just as
much at stake as you do and is consequently
just as reluctant to give a clear indication of
intent. That's why most of these clues are nor
mal actions pushed a little too far. You must
rely on your instincts to recognize them. And
if your heart is fluttering already, a judgment
of degrees might be hard to make. Miss Sass
sympathizes.
Realize that your prospective is looking
for the same signals in you to reaffirm his or
her interest. Be sure you're giving them, and
make them as clear as possible. Otherwise,
your someone might move on to more recep
tive game.
The more you give, the more your partner
becomes comfortable giving until, suddenly,
the charade explodes, and you can both
speak frankly about what you have been con
cealing for so long. Or, recognizing the futili
ty of your advances, you lick your wounds
and start over with another special someone.
Such are the risks and the glory of the
hunt.
