Rainier" is the story of one man's fascination with Mount
1 Rainier. Author Bruce Barcott became so obsessed with the
mountain that he quit his job, his girlfriend left him and he reorganized his
entire life. This book is the result of his labors.
A far cry from the standard mountain climbing story, "The Measure of
a Mountain" explores Mount Rainier through every discipline imagin-

able, including geology,
volcanology, glaciolo
gy, entomology,
botany, biology and
taxonomy. Barcott did
not approach the
mountain with the goal
to conquer it, reach the
summit and move on;
rather, his goal was"the
moment when I would
know the mountain as
perfectly as myswlf."
Toward this end, he
probes endlessly into
every facet of Mt.
Rainier. Beginning as
an inexperienced city
dweller, Barcott takes
us along as he gets
equipment and begins
his first long backpack
ing trip around the
mountain. He is defeat
ed and forced to turn
back from this first trip,
but by the end of the
book he has circled the
entire mountain, spo
ken to innumerable ex
perts about its different

aspects and finally, after much deliberation, reached its summit.
"The Measure of a Mountain" is the definitive text about Mt. Rainier,
and a large portion of the book is dedicated to the details of the mountain.
Barcott intermingles personal stories with factual information to create a

pleasurable read that ends up teaching the
reader more than one would ever guess. It's
almost unbelievable how much information
Barcott has gathered. Yet rarely docs the
book become tedious with detail, as Bar
cott's flair for writing and his clear enthusi-

asm for everything Rainier-related gives the entire book a personal feel.
Barcott is an amazing writer, and clearly he has spent an enormous
amount of time doing his background research. Mountain climbers tend
to be elitist, describing feats that most people would never dream of. Yet
Barcott's down-to-earth attitude pervades the book, showing the reader
the clear progression from observer to hiker to climber and back to ob
server again without ever sacrificing the feeling that Barcott is one of us.
Reading it, one simultaneously has the urge to lace up one's own boots
and join Barcott on Mt. Rainier and the feeling that one has already vic
ariously explored the mountain from top to bottom.
