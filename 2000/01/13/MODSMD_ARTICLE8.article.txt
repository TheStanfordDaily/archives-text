## Controversial encryption software to be sold abroad 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Clinton administration disclosed
relaxed rules Wednesday allowing
high-tech companies to sell even
the most powerful data-scrambling
software overseas with virtually no
restrictions.
The new rules had encountered
strong opposition within the
administration. Top law enforce
ment and defense officials argued
that relaxing rules would allow
criminals and terrorists to more
easily transmit scrambled electron
ic messages the government could
not decipher.
But the technology industry, an

increasingly powerful force in
Washington circles, successfully
countered that the software
already was widely available out
side the United States for anyone
with access to the Internet.
"You have to be a fairly stupid
criminal not to have encryption
now," said Piper Cole, a vice pres
ident at Sun Microsystems Inc.
"It's available all over the world
for downloading free from Web
sites."
"That bridge has already been
crossed," agreed Robert Holley
man, president of the Washington
based Business Software Alliance.

"It was only being kept out of the
hands of law-abiding citizens
around the world."
Industry experts said the
change by the Bureau of Export
Administration at the Commerce
Department will encourage more
widespread use of data-scrambling
products — and make them easier
to use. Even the most popular
encryption software now can be
awkward and not intuitive for con
sumers.
"Companies have been prepar
ing products to begin shipping
worldwide, and they'll begin doing
that right away," Holleyman pre

dicted. "It's a big plus for comput
er users. There will be more and
more improvements."
Wider use of powerful encryp
tion also could reassure consumers
who have been reluctant to pur
chase products or services over the
Internet because of fears about
fraud or theft.
"It will give people a level of
trust," Cole said. "You're looking
at it impacting a huge market."
The White House decided in
September to largely reverse its
long-standing opposition to liber
alizing the rules that U.S. compa
nies must follow to export the most

powerful software to scramble dig
ital messages.
It was a concession to the indus
try over the objections of law
enforcement and national security
officials because it will help those
companies in overseas competition
— and help consumers worldwide
guarantee the privacy of their e
mail and online credit-card pur
chases.
"This announcement clearly
sets the stage for the next big
growth phase of the Internet," said
Eric Schmidt, chairman of Novell
Inc.
The administration said it still

will require companies to seek per
mission to sell the scrambling tech
nology to a foreign government or
military, and will maintain bans on
selling to seven nations accused of
supporting terrorism: Iran, Iraq.
Libya, Syria, Sudan, Norlh Korea
and Cuba.
Previously, the administration
allowed companies to sell the most
powerful scrambling technology
only to specific industries overseas;
other foreign customers were gen
erally limited to so-called 56-bit
encryption products, meaning
those with 72 quadrillion unlock
ing combinations.
