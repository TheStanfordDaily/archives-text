# Sentence for young murderer spares him life in prison

### 
PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) — One
of the youngest murderers in U.S.
history — a boy who shot a stranger
at age 11 — was spared life in prison
Thursday and sent away to a juvenile
detention center until he turns 21.
Judge Eugene Moore said the
tough 1997 Michigan law that
allowed Nathaniel Abraham to be
prosecuted as an adult is "fundamen
tally flawed" and that the boy has a
chance of being rehabilitated.
He said the case was a wake-up
call "that our youth are in trouble."
"1 urge the Legislature to lean
toward improving the resources and
programs within the juvenile justice
system rather than diverting more
youth into an already failed adult

system," Moore said.
Nathaniel, who turns 14 next
week, did not speak at the hearing.
He turned around and looked at his
mother and other relatives when he
entered the courtroom but showed
no emotion when the judge passed
sentence.
A defense attorney said he had to
explain to the boy what had hap
pened.
Nathaniel was the first youth
charged with first-degree murder
under the 1997 law. which allows
children of any age to be prosecuted
as adults for serious offenses. I lie
case stirred debate across the coun
try over efforts to crack down on
juvenile crime.

1 ie was convicted in November of
second-degree murder for shooting
Ronnie Greene Jr., 18, outside a
Pontiac convenience store in 1997
with a stolen rifle from about 70
yards awav. The sixth-grader was
arrested two days later, his face
painted for I lalloween. and has been
held in a juvenile facility ever since.
Prosecutors said Nathaniel had
told a friend that he was going to
shoot somebody, practiced his aim
on stationary targets, shot Greene in
the head and bragged about it the
next day.
The defense said that Nathaniel
was shooting at trees and that
Greene was struck by a bullet that
ricocheted off a tree. The defense

also said Nathaniel had the mind of a
6- to 8-year-old and could not form
the intent to commit murder or
understand the charges against him.
Amnesty International chose his
frightened face to illustrate the cover
of a 1998 report condemning Ameri
ca's justice system as too harsh on
juveniles.
The judge had several options,
ranging from life in prison with a
chance of parole to a sentence of
time already served. Prosecutors had
sought a combination sentence of
juvenile detention until age 21. fol
lowed by a decision on whether to
send him to an adult prison.
Hut the judge said that if society is
committed to preventing future

criminal behavior, rehabilitation
through the juvenile system is the
answer.
"Hopefully, far into the future,
the Greenes will be able to take
some comfort in knowing that their
son's death was not in vain, but
rather was a wake-up call for our
community and to the nation that
our youth are in trouble and we need
to pay attention." Moore said.
The judge told Nathaniel. "Your
shooting and killing of Ronnie
Greene has destroyed the lives of
many people."
"We as a community have failed
you. but you have also failed us and
yourself.... The only thing you can
do to repair the damage you have

caused the Greene family is suc
ceed. Don't let Mr. Greene's death
be in vain. Help us help you and in
turn help many other children in
this community. No one can do it
for you. You must do it for your
self."
Prosecutors had argued it was
impossible to know whether the boy
would be rehabilitated by age 21.
"Why bind your hands? It doesn't
make sense." prosecutor Lisa
1 ialushka told the judge.
Robin Adams, Greene's mother,
said she hopes Nathaniel learns from
his mistake. "I hope he realizes what
he did was wrong. He took a life,"
she said. "I think he needs to put
God in his life."
