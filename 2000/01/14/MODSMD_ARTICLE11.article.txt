A Daily editor reflects
on a trip to India over
winter break

Unlike past years, where I
would spend a slothful
three weeks at home dur
ing winter break, this year I was
fortunate to have spent the time
traveling and doing research in
South India.
Naturally, the weeks before the
trip were filled with a lot more
planning and apprehension than
normally accompanied the typical
winter vacation. Not only would I
be going to a distant and vastly
different land, but this would be
my first time to South Asia and
outside the West ... since I left
more than 13 years ago.
Consequently, I braced myself
for the culture shock that
inevitably takes place when you
live in one place for so long and
step into what amounts to anoth
er world altogether. At the same
lime, having lived in the subconti
nent previously (just not in India)
and possessing a very strong
understanding of the issues of that
region, this visit would not be a
completely alien experience to
me. I firmly believed that I would
know what to expect when I
arrived there. And that 1 did, to a
large extent.
What I could have hardly pre
dicted, however, was the effect
this trip would have on me. I was
certain that I would return to the
United States a different person.
Exactly how different, and to
what extent, I was unsure of.
I thought that maybe I would
return home with some "special"

or hitherto "undiscovered"
knowledge that I didn't have. Per
haps floating in the back of my
subconscious mind were all those
tales of travelers going to India
and "finding themselves." Little
did I know that an issue that I was
so concerned by and had read and
studied so much about would
have the greatest impact on me:
poverty.
Many of us (including myself)
have heard all the figures and sto
ries about the extent of global
poverty. However, such an issue
never really does hit home until
you see it with your own eyes. The
confines of Stanford and Palo
Alto sometimes make it all too
easy to "hide" from and theorize
about the social problems that
exist in this world, even when
they are sitting right in our back
yard â€” namely East Palo Alto.
Traveling in India, however, I
found that wherever I went there
was no end to the sight of pover
ty. Rich and poor exist side by
side, and the economic disparities
are much starker. As someone
not used to seeing this on a daily
basis, it was difficult not to be dis
turbed.
To be fair, India is a beautiful
and exceedingly fascinating coun
try that is invariably more com
plex than I could have ever imag
ined or I could ever describe here.
Furthermore, given the wealth of
historical, political and cultural
issues of concern to me there, it
would be difficult for me not to be
intensely interested by such a
country. However, I think, some
of the most simple things I saw
there were an education alone.
