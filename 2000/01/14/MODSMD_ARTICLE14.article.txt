# A 						Little Good Ol' Capulet Thumb-Bitin'

I've wanted my own
newspaper column
ever since high
school, when one of my
friends had an opinion
column in our school
paper. The great thing
about his column was

that he was able to get all kinds of people
angry at him, from cheerleaders to jocks to
socialists. Now that may not sound all that
great, but you have to admit every now
and then it's fun to raise some ire.
I figured that California would be a
great place to have a column, that offend
ing activists would be like shooting fish in
a barrel. So after each column I've smugly
leaned back with a satisfied smile and
waited for the bushels of irate letters to
pour in from people at whom I could then
merrily laugh. Between the vegans and the
tree-savers and the Tibct-frecrs and even
the Christians, I certainly expected at least
a few letters from offended sensibilities.
Unfortunately, as far as I know, noth
ing I've written so far has elicited even one
response. I've been wondering what the
reason for this is, and I've decided it's
because the vast majority of people on
campus actually couldn't care less.
I thought there would be a few true
believers around — people willing to give
their lives for the tears of the redwoods or
the political freedom of the third world or
some nonsense like that. And to tell the
truth I actually like the activists and revo

lutionaries. Don't get me wrong, most of
them are definitely on the goofy side. But
1 respect them for believing in something:
the revolution, the ecosystem, the equality
of men. It may be only a delusion, but at
least they value something greater than
themselves, beyond themselves.
A lot of people around here like to say
they have a cause, because it makes them
sound important and savvy. But really
most til us. I think, are just here to put our
selves into the "system." The system now
which pretends that it's not actually the
"system," even that it's "anti-system." But
still every day there's more and more
rules, more hoops to jump through. We,
my friends, are being corralled.
You say you want to help people. You
want to become a doctor, for example. But
when you graduate, you know, you're
going to be working for the Man. When
someone comes in and wants you to heal
them, you're going to follow the formula:
you're going to make sure they have insur
ance, you're going to send them down the
hall to the X-ray man, even if you know
they don't need an X-ray. you're going to
have them sign waivers and releases and
every kind of paper work. You will be a
single cog in an ever-growing depersonal
ized machine.
We have been trained to follow the
rules. We follow the maze, because we're
afraid to complain, afraid to be offended
by any attack whatever on our personal
diunitv as long as it comes from the svs

tem. Heaven forbid anyone should think
we are "out of line" or disorderly, or that
we should upset anyone who is merely
doing their job, following orders.
In the film "Clerks", Randal, a video
store employee, postulates that "title does
not dictate behavior" and proceeds to gra
tuitously demonstrate this point by spit
ting a mouthful of water at a customer.
You know that some people just need to
be spat upon, but when was the last time
you did anything about it? I don't know
about you. but I think it's probably worth
a few thousand dollars of lost earning
potential to be able to occasionally lay
into someone who's annoying or someone
who tells you your ideals are junk (you
crazy tree-hugging liberals).
John Keats wrote, "The commonest
man shows grace in his quarrels." Perhaps
that's the only grace or dignity we ever
get, because you've got to have enough
self respect to really care about something
anything — and to give someone hell
for being wrong. So please, I urge you,
someone be offended by my column here.
Write in; I'm sure one of you must have an
irrational self-righteous letter to the editor
within you. Don't be shy. I'm here to
laugh at you.

I ravis kopp is a junior majoring in math
amities, and for the sake of argument In
wants to hum the rain forests and rob tin
blind.
