Bonfire issue not a big secret
If Corey Griffin thinks lie's revealing
some grand and glorious secret with his bon
fire column, lie's plain wrong. Most of the
facts in his column were printed in I lie Daily
on Nov. 7.19 ( )7, and several times since. This
includes the fact that the University agreed
not to reinstate the bonfire as part of the
agreement that allowed them to build
Lyman Graduate Residences.
Everyone who bothered to look has
known this for two years; the I Iniversity has
not lied about the subject. And 1 think most
rational members of the Stanford communi
ty, if confronted with a choice between a
bonfire and a large stretch of graduate hous
ing. would pick the housing.
Certainly there has been more
widespread and coherent student activism in
favor of housing. All the bonfire controversy
has generated is a whole bunch of self-serv
ing and profoundly stupid windbagging from
the ASSIJ and others. This has in turn led to
an unjustified feeling among the student
body that we all got a raw deal.
If Corey Griffin really thinks a bonfire is
more important than housing for 2(K)-(xid
students, he should say that explicitly.
Instead, all his column does is rewrite history

to make the administration seem like villains.
I'o say "they should have consulted the
student body" is a meaningless argument. II
it were put to a vote, the student body would
have voted for Lyman rather than a bonfire.
At least I sure hope so.
I never got to see a real Big Game bon
fire. and I'm sorry about that. I would have
enjoyed it tremendously. On the other hand,
the bonfire regularly caused loud complaints
from everyone living anywhere even vaguely
close to it. In addition, 12 people just died
building one of these things in Fexas. II there
was ever a chance we'd see a bonfire again,
that tragedy ended it. I'd advise folks to just
get reconciled to this and stop trying to find
someone to blame.

Earn 50 Prof, explains
impetus behind department
change
The decision in December to make
Lconomics 50M a prerequisite for Eco
nomics 50, rather than just encouraging
students strongly to take it earlier, has

everybody involved faced with a difficult
situation.
The Daily's editorial on Tuesday does
suggest that the fault lies with the Eco
nomics Department for this sudden change
in procedures. It should be understood,
however, that we were simply responding
to pressures elsewhere in the University. If.
it had been up to the Economics Depart
ment alone, there would have been no
change in the rules governing entry into
Econ 50 until at least Autumn 2000.
The Department was caught between a
request from the administration for an
immediate change in the rules and the pre
dictable unfortunate consequences for
many of our undergraduate students. We
regret very much the inconvenience and
distress imposed on students by the sud
denness of these changes, but the surprise
was not of our making.
In addition. I would like to comment
briefly on the last two paragraphs of your
editorial. First, the department has now
formalized arrangements allowing students
to register for both Econ 50M and Econ 50
this quarter, provided that both they and
their academic advisers sign a statement
acknowledging that there is a possibility of
being placed on academic probation if they

do not pass Eicon 50M and thus become
ineligible to receive credit for Econ 50.
This arrangement is far from ideal, but
it does help students who planned to regis
ter for both courses, as the Stanford Bul
letin indicates is possible.
I would also like to assure students tak
ing both classes concurrently that the
material in the first few weeks of Econ 50
does not make use the multivariate calcu
lus that is the main topic covered in Econ
50M. That will be an important tool for the
latter part of Econ 50, after Econ 50M is
over.
Thus, students who have not yet met the
Econ 50M prerequisite should not find them
selves at an undue disadvantage, provided
they have sufficient ability in single-variable
calculus as taught in, for example. Math 41,
which is a prerequisite for Econ 50M.
The present arrangements are seen as
temporary. The Economics Department
will be giving more thought to the teaching
of Econ 50M. 50 and 51 in the near future,
and the written views of students who went
through this sequence recently would be
especially valuable.
