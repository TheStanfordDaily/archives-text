# Ri2K is A-OK!
## New Daily EIC arrives glitch-free 
### Gloria Steinem Editorial staff 
Womyn, the glass ceiling has
been broken.
Freeing The Daily from three
volumes of male oppression, junior
and feminist vegetarian Ritu Bhat
nagar was elected editor in chief
last night.
As the victorious Bhatnagar and
her entourage made the short walk
from her campaign headquarters in
the Fire Truck House to I lie
Daily's offices, the masses assem
bled outside broke into her cam
paign mantra: "No meat! No men!
No problems!"
"We have been subjegated for

too long," she told the revelers.
"They can scream at us for taking
seven hours to write a 40-inch
story, but they can never take our
freedom! Today begins a new day
for the subcontinent and for
womyn everywhere."
Fntering the offices, Bhatnagar
issued a 20-page statement detail
ing the "vices" that will be banned
from the Storke Publications
Building beginning Feb. 1. Among
the contraband are white meat,
dark meat, red meat, beer, wine,
liquor, cigarettes, pornography,
miniskirts, makeup and bras.
"I'm outta here," said current
editor in chief (ill Lope/.
In fact, Bhatnagar plans to insti

tute a complicated caste system
designating the sports department
"untouchable" and to change the
name of the newspaper to "The
Stanford Delhi."
Not all welcomed her victory,
however. When reached yesterday
evening at their home in Saratoga,
Bhatnagar's parents responded
with great confusion.
"You must he mistaken," Dr.
Bhatnagar said. "My daughter is
preparing to enter Harvard Med
ical School. She's always dreamed
of being a doctor. Working at a
newspaper would only distract
her."
Bhatnagar denied plans of a
medical career. "I can't believe you
called my daddy," she whined. "It's
noooot lair. He thinks I'm still
Hum Bio."
After calming her down, womyn
news editor Meredith Rowe ex
plained Bhatnagar had many plans
for the paper.
"She'd like to run a number of
■packages,' " she said. "We did that
all the time last quarter, and it
worked out really well."
Indian news editor Anuj Gupta
explained that "packages" are
"groups of nebulous stories with
complicated graphics that explain
next-to-nothing and never get as
signed to anyone."
Bhatnagar plans to print her
lirst package, on the tenure strug
gles of vegetarian professors,
sometime during the spring of
2005.
The packages will be a key com
ponent of Bhatnagar's new two
section Daily.
By moving special content, clas
sifieds and sports to a "B" section
in each day's paper, Bhatnagar
plans to make more room in the
front of the paper for her own opin
ions.
" The revolution has begun," she
said. "This is the new millennium.
This is Ri2K!"
Et tu. Rim?
