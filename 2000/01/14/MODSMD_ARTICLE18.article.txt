# Works of student playwrights take center stage in One Acts
## 
### Monya De Contributing writer 
A few weeks into last quarter,
most students were still easing back
into Stanford life, meeting up with
friends and generally kicking back.
But three sleepless writers were
busy perfecting the scripts that, un
beknowst to them, would come to
life in the 2000 Ram's Head Origi
nal Winter One Acts, which
opened yesterday.
Bv the October deadline for
scripts, senior Megan Micklev, the
Ram's Head Executive Producer,
One Acts Assistant Producer Ka
teri Mc√üae, a junior, and two
Ram's Head board members were
"up to their necks" in original work
by Stanford students.
Twenty-five scripts were sub
mitted and were judged based on
three categories: overall dramatic
excellence, technical demands and
general reaction to all aspects of the
show.
"Between Cleanings" by senior
Art Sehram, "The Christmas
Feast" by Andrew Hinderaker and
"Memento Mori" by senior Paul
Kerschen were the plays chosen to
he performed at One Acts.
Mickley said she is "ecstatic"
about the shows and emphasized
the unique personalities of each
play.
The three authors said their
plays came about partly by sudden
inspiration.
Schram, who has previously
acted in One Acts, said, "I wrote
Between Cleanings' because I sud
denly felt compelled to set a play in
a bathroom. The storv grew out of

the location. 1 used the idea ol an
executive function for a new hot
shot company because young high
rollers with a lot to lose appealed to
me. I tried to make the script tight
enough to be funny and yet main
tain an edge."
Kerschen had never written for
the stage before.
"Most of what I write is poetry
and short fiction," he said. "'Me
mento Mori' was written more or
less as an experiment. I'd never
done anything related to the the
ater. so when Winter One Acts
called for scripts it seemed like a
good chance to try writing a play
and see if anything came of it."
Although Kerschen said he
"churned out" his play in the week
before scripts were due, the idea for
the play took shape two years ago.
when he was inspired to write a
piece about a man who is followed
around by a personified Death.
Still, he said, he has laced the
scripts with plenty of inside jokes.
Hinderaker's participation in
the script contest was rooted in his
desire to try something new.
"Up until 'The Christmas Feast,'
I had only written short stories and
a bit of had poetry," he said. "Win
ter One Acts gave me a wonderful
excuse to try my hand at dramatic
work."
Hinderaker also completed
most of his play in the week before
the looming deadline, and said he
was blessed with timely inspiration.
"I was lying in bed one night,
and I know it sounds a hit bizarre,
hut I could see the beginnings of the
first scene," he said. "A middle
aged man, the weird uncle that no

one in the family really talks about,
reasoning out why Superman must
have a small penis. And so I just de
cided to start there and see where it
took me."
"The Christmas Feast," a tale of
a dysfunctional family, was finished
four hours before scripts were due.
Hinderaker said he was "shocked
and thrilled" when Mickley called
him.
Since then. One Acts production
has continued at a rapid pace, the
directors said. Directors and all
staff were interviewed and chosen,
rehearsal schedules were set, audi
tions and callbacks took place and
rehearsals started within a two
week span.
Senior Geoff von Oeyen, direc
tor of "Memento Mori," was drawn
to the script for its farcical humor
and high quality.
"Thoughtfully constructed and
beautifully written. Paul's script ex
cels far beyond what is expected of
a student-written play," he said.
Last year's One Acts producer,
Avery Willis, took on directing
"Between Cleanings" because she
enjoyed its fast pace and humor. A
playwright herself, she said she
strove to create a highly entertain
ing experience for the audience.
In contrast, director Jessica
Donaghy said she liked the chal
lenge of working with the heavily
dramatic material in " The Christ
mas Feast."
Although the writers have dif
ferent plans for the future, all said
they have enjoyed seeing their
work produced and giving their di
rectors the experience of working
with fresh material.
