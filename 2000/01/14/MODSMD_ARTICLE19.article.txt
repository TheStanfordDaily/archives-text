■ Today-Tomorrow: No. 2 Stanford at No. 9 Michigan

There is a King history of competitive meets between
the Cardinal and the Wolverines. While Stanford has won
the previous five encounters with Michigan and are fa
vored to win this meet, the Wolverines are still optimistic
about the meets today and tomorrow.
"It's the pride of the school that's on the line in a meet
like this," said Michigan head coach Jon Urbanchek. "If
you match up us and Stanford by times, Stanford wins 10
of 11 on paper. But we don't compete on paper."
The Cardinal showed very well in preseason competi
tion. going 2-1. Stanford beat the University of British Co
lumbia and Pacific 10 Conference rival California in a
double-distance dual meet. Its only loss came to No. I
Texas by a small margin.
During preseason competition, Stanford was led by a
wide spectrum of swimmers that included both returners
and freshmen. Juniors Steven Brown, Rob Canales,
Adam Messner and Anthony Robinson made strong ap
pearances during the preseason and lived up to their All-
American status.
Several freshmen, including Randall Bal, John Waters
and Dan Wescott, also made good first impressions. Bal
finished first on numerous occasions in backstroke events
while Waters and Wescott showed exceptionally well in
the freestyle events.
Urbanchek acknowledged that Stanford's depth and
talent will be difficult to beat.
"Stanford has a very well-balanced, outstanding
team," he said. "They look very good all around, have a
strong senior class and a very strong freshman class. Not

to mention that they probably have
the best junior class in the NCAA."
The Wolverines are coming off
of a 1-1 weekend, defeating Ari
zona State, but losing to Arizona.
Some Wolverine swimmers to keep
an eye on will be juniors Chris
Thompson and Ail-American Scott
Werner, and sophomores Jeff I lop
wood. Tim Siciliano and Mike
McWha.
"We are very strong in the dis

tance-oriented events," said Ur
banchek. "Like the 400- and 800-
meter events."
IJrbanchek said both Werner
and 1 lopwood should be good com
petition for Stanford's Canales in
the 200-meter breaststroke. All
three are among the nation's top 10
in the 200-yard breaststroke.
Stanford's Messner, Brown and
Gustin should also get some strong
competition in the freestyle events
from Michigan's Thompson, Sicil
iano and McWha.
Although the matchup between
the two top-10 teams is an inipor

tant one with regard to national
rankings, it will not necessarily play
a large role in NCAA qualifica
tions. Since conference competi
tion mostly determines whether a
team advances to the NCAA meet
in March, non-conference meets
will most likely be looked at simply
in reference to the teams' final
records.
The meeting of the Cardinal and
the Wolverines takes two Stanford
swimmers back to familiar territo
ry. Both Messner and senior Kurt
Spenser left their homes in Ann
Arbor to attend Stanford.

"There are some interesting ties
between us and Stanford," said Ur
banchek. "Two Ann Arbor boys
left here to go to Stanford, and
[sophomore Reid] Gustin's sister
went to Michigan."
Similarly, Michigan's Hopwood
graduated from Palo Alto High
School.
Today's meet is purely for exhi
bition, while tomorrow's meet will
be recorded and count toward sea
son records.
"We expect a lot of good
matchups," said Urbanchek.
"These are two very strong teams."
