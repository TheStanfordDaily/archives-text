double-distance dual meet. Its only loss came to No. I

finished first on numerous occasions in backstroke events

the freestyle events.

talent will be difficult to beat.
"Stanford has a very well-balanced, outstanding
team," he said. "They look very good all around, have a
strong senior class and a very strong freshman class. Not
