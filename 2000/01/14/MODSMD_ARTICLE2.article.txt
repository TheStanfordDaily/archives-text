# Hospital ends coverage of Medicare HMO patients
##

In another effort to cut costs. UC'SF-Stan
ford I lealth Care mailed approximately 1 .(HH>
letters in late November informing its
Medicare 11 MO patients that it will no longer
accept their coverage plans.
Although UCSF-Stanford Health Care
made the decision, only Stanford Medical
Center's Medicare HMO contracts are affect
ed. IJCSFhas not announced any plans to fol
low the Medical Center's lead on this issue.
I lospital financial analysts have calculated
that the move should save the institution $2
million per year.
Although the decision not to serve
Medicare IIMO patients is one many hospi
tals have made. Stanford spokesman Mike
Goodkind stressed that as a teaching hospital.
Stanford Medical Center has an even greater
interest in refusing to be a provider for insur
ance companies with very low service reim
bursement rates.
"At academic medical centers, such as
Stanford, it's costing us a lot more because
under the I IMO we don't get any money to
pay for interns and residents to cover the
added costs of caring for patients." (ioodkind
said.
Goodkind emphasized that the hospital
was not refusing to serve Medicare patients,
but only Medicare HMO patients. Seniors
often enroll in Medicare 11 M( )s because thev
offer perks such as prescription drug coverage
and few or nocopayments.

With a Medicare 1I MO, there are no pre
miums. (icodkind said. "Instead of paying for
your health care the government gives the
money [it would have spent on you] to the in
surance company and lets them take care of
you."
Traditional Medicare does not cover pre
scription drugs and requires participants to
contribute to the cost of their care, often in the
form of copayments for certain services or
procedures.
" The cost of prescription drugs is just too
much for most seniors on the income they
have, and this pushes seniors into HMO
plans." said Marian Lowe, executive director
of the California affiliate of the American
Nurses Association.
"If enough Bay Area hospitals drop these
plans, patients will have no other choice but to
convert back to the traditional Medicare plan.
And then they're in a financial pinch," she
added.
Lowe also said statistical evidence sug
gests seniors often don't fill prescriptions or
take smaller doses than are prescribed when
they cannot afford to pay for their full drug
treatment.
Stanford's decision. Lowe predicted, is just
one of many that will eventually force Con
gress to include prescription drug coverage in
Medicare.
It's important to remember. Goodkind
said, that all affected patients can seamlessly
shift into regular Medicare coverage and con-
tinuc to receive care at the Medical
Center.
Most of the affected patients are
former Stanford employees or their
dependents, Cioodkind said.

Because HMO coverage has been
available in the Bay Area and to
Stanford employees for close to 20
years. Goodkind speculated that the
affected patients had chosen HMO
plans in retirement partly because
they were already familiar with them.
Economics Prof. Victor Fuchs,
who specializes in the economies of

health care, was concerned by the
lack of dialogue surrounding this de
cision. He noted that he had not seen
press coverage of the initial proposal
to drop Medicare HMO patients.
"The issues 1 would raise are not
only about the conclusion reached,
but also the basis of the conclusion
and the lack of debate," Fuchs said.
