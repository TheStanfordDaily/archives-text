MEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Yesterday: No. 3 Stanford 73, Oregon
State 45

While the Beavers came out strong
in the first half, the Cardinal (13-1, 2-1
Pacific 10 Conference) buckled down
and made Oregon State (8-5, 0-2) play
Stanford-style basketball.

"At the start, they were really ag
gressive," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "They were taking
it at us. But then we settled down.
"We grinded a bit offensively, but we
were much more patient. Needless to
say. this was huge for us."
The Beavers looked pumped up for
the game early and swarmed around the
ball every time a Cardinal player had it
in his hands.
But after Oregon State center Jason
Heide and all-conference point guard
Deaundra Tanner were each called for
their second fouls within a span of eight
seconds, Stanford began to assert itself
behind the play of senior guard David
Moselev. He finished with 15 points, 13
of which came in the first half.
Behind its increased defensive pres
sure, Stanford went on a 12-0 run at the

end of the half to take a 29-18 lead into
the locker room.
The start of the second half was no
different. While the crowd came back
ready for a run from the Beavers, an
other 12-0 Stanford streak blew the
game wide open. Freshman Casey Ja
cobsen, who led all scorers with lb
points in his first collegiate start, scored
seven of his points during the five
minute run.
"We had to weather the storm early,
but after that it was our game to win."
said Jacobsen, who struggled with only
five points in Saturday's loss to Arizona.
"I was excited to start. But I was excited
to just get on the floor to erase my game
against Arizona."
Stanford, which leads the conference
in rebounding and defensive field goal
percentage, outrebounded the Beavers

42-30 and held Oregon State to 20 per
cent shooting from the field, only 14
percent from three-point territory.
The Beavers 45 points was a season
low output.
Stanford was so successful partly be
cause it was able to shut down Oregon
State's biggest stars.
While Tanner scored the first three
points of the game on a driving lay up
and ensuing foul shot, he never scored
another point. Tanner, who averages
more than 15 points per game, finished
the night 1 for 11 from the field.
"1 just knew 1 had to pick it up on de
fense. because otherwise he was going
to go off," said Stanford point guard
Mike McDonald, who matched up with
Tanner. "We just knew we had to
square him up and that we couldn't
let him get into the paint because
that's where he can do a lot of dam
age."
The Beavers star freshman and
leading scorer. Brian Jackson, was
also shut down. While it seemed
like he might have an advantage
against Stanford senior Mark Mad
sen. who guarded him much of the
evening. Madsen negated Jackson's
quickness with superior position
ing.

"I felt like him missing his first
shot really allowed me to take him
out of his game," Madsen said. "Be
cause he didn't have his shot, I
could take a step hack and negate
his drive."
While Jacohsen's solid offensive
effort was most notable, he also
turned in what could have been his
best defense of the year.
"In high school", to be honest, I
didn't play a lick of defense," Ja
cobsen said. "But in college, 1 have
to guard the quickest guvs in the na
tion. I really have been concentrat
ing on my defense."
It showed. Jacobsen allowed

Oregon State's starting shooting
guard. Josh Steinthal, to take only
two shots, both of which he missed.
Junior forward Ryan Mendez,
who was out of the starting lineup
for Jacobsen, took a while to get
into the game and then took a while
to score. Hut Mendez, who was on
the bench because he missed two
days of practice to attend his grand
mother's funeral in Texas, finally
broke through with 10 minutes, 50
seconds left in the game, scoring 10
consecutive points for the Cardinal.
Stanford's offensive perfor
mance was exceptional, especially
in the second half. The Cardinal fin

ished the contest shooting 56 per
cent. 50 percent from beyond the
three-point arc. However, it was
Stanford's defensive effort that was
the story of the game.
"We won this game on guts and
determination." Madsen said, 'it
started from David Moseley on
down. We won this game on effort."
The win sets up a crucial early
season conference game against
Oregon (11-2,2-0) tomorrow at the
Duck's Mac Arthur Court. Oregon,
which destroyed the Beavers last
Saturday in Corvallis, polished off
California 83-68 last night to keep
its conference record perfect.
