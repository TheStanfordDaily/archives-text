State 45

While the Beavers came out strong
in the first half, the Cardinal (13-1, 2-1
Pacific 10 Conference) buckled down
and made Oregon State (8-5, 0-2) play
Stanford-style basketball.

"At the start, they were really ag
gressive," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "They were taking
it at us. But then we settled down.
"We grinded a bit offensively, but we
were much more patient. Needless to
say. this was huge for us."
The Beavers looked pumped up for
the game early and swarmed around the
ball every time a Cardinal player had it
in his hands.
But after Oregon State center Jason
Heide and all-conference point guard
Deaundra Tanner were each called for
their second fouls within a span of eight
seconds, Stanford began to assert itself
behind the play of senior guard David
Moselev. He finished with 15 points, 13
of which came in the first half.
Behind its increased defensive pres
sure, Stanford went on a 12-0 run at the

end of the half to take a 29-18 lead into
the locker room.
The start of the second half was no

"We had to weather the storm early,
but after that it was our game to win."
said Jacobsen, who struggled with only
five points in Saturday's loss to Arizona.
"I was excited to start. But I was excited
to just get on the floor to erase my game
against Arizona."
Stanford, which leads the conference
in rebounding and defensive field goal
percentage, outrebounded the Beavers

42-30 and held Oregon State to 20 per
cent shooting from the field, only 14
percent from three-point territory.
The Beavers 45 points was a season
low output.
Stanford was so successful partly be
cause it was able to shut down Oregon
State's biggest stars.
While Tanner scored the first three
points of the game on a driving lay up
and ensuing foul shot, he never scored
another point. Tanner, who averages
more than 15 points per game, finished
the night 1 for 11 from the field.
"1 just knew 1 had to pick it up on de
fense. because otherwise he was going
to go off," said Stanford point guard
Mike McDonald, who matched up with
Tanner. "We just knew we had to
