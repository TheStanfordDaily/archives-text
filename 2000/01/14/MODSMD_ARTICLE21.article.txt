WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Yesterday: Stanford 78, Oregon State

"I thought that wasa really hard fought
20-point win." said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "Oregon State came out and re
ally jumped on us early, and our team re
sponded well at the end of the first half."
And respond the team did. Fueled in
the last minute of the first half by a fast
break basket from senior guard Christina
Batastini and a last-second three-point
shot by sophomore guard Lindsey Ya
masaki. the Cardinal (9-4,2-1 Pacific 10
Conference) took the lead. It didn't
change hands again.
The game extends the Cardinal's win
streak in Pac-10 home openers to 14 and
marks Oregon State's (8-5, 0-2) 15th
straight loss on the road.
But more importantly, last night the
Cardinal played like a team. Four players
scored in the double figures and nearly
every player who set foot on the court
contributed in rejuvenating the Cardi
nal's momentum.
"Our idea of going in and being intense
was that defensively we needed some
stoppers and we needed to come out and
pick up the energy level." Yamasaki said.
"I'm fine coming off the bench and com
ing in and contributing as much as I can."
Although she missed part of the season
because of conflicts with Stanford's
women's volleyball team, Yamasaki has
established herself as an important part of
the Stanford lineup. She scored 12 points
against the Beavers and was 3 for 4 from
three point range.

"She showed a lot of poise," Van-
Dervecr said. "And just helped us out in
key situations."
Junior forward Carolyn Moos proved
herself again to be a highly versatile of
fensive threat, scoring a game-high 17
points. She dominated the frontcourt
scoring in the paint, from the field and
from behind the three-point line.
Foul trouble in the last few games has
forced sophomore center Cori Enghusen
to recede into the depths of the Cardinal
bench, but she shouted her return yester
day by scoring 12 points and grabbing
seven rebounds.
"What has held Cori back is that she's
gotten in foul trouble in a lot of games,"
VanDervecr said. "And this game I think
she only had one foul and it was way at the
end. And that really helped us — the fact
that she really played smart."
Sophomore forward Bethany
Donaphin was queen of the boards last
night, snatching a game-high 12 rebounds.
She also scored nine points and made
some strong moves in the paint.
"Bethany didn't finish as well as she
has been." VanDervecr said. "But she re
bounded really well for us."
VanDervecr said the success of cou
pling Moos and Enghusen in the front
court might take pressure off of
Donaphin to score in the paint while in
spiring her to work harder and competi
tively defend her position in the lineup.
Senior guard Milcna Flores had a great
game as well. I ler composure during her
39 minutes on the court maintained the
Cardinal's intensity and productivity. She
scored 13 points and was 3 for 3 from be
hind the three-point arc. She also dished
out eight assists.
Freshman guard Jamie Carey, Flo
t es's partner in the backcourt, started de
spite an ailing ankle. She played 27 min
utes. contributing five baskets and six as
sists.
"I always feel like I'm putting this

puz/le together." VanDervecr said. "We
have the 12 pieces and have to figure out
who plays well together and who plays
well against the team we're playing and
what they're doing and who can guard
people. It really comes down to the peo

pie helping us at both ends of the floor."
"There arc some constants to the puz
zle." she continued. "Milena's running
the show and I think she's doing a great
job. That's where it's really steads. u Inch
I like. I like steady hackeourt plav."
