Senior K.J. Hippensteel, currently the No. 1 colle
giate tennis player in the nation, will be one of
four Cardinal players going to this weekend's Na
tional Collegiate Tennis Classic in Thousand
Oaks, Calif.
In doubles, Kim and Abrams,
the No. 1 doubles team in the
country, will play together, as will
Hippensteel and Martin, the No. 5
doubles team in the country.
The outcome of this tourna
ment will help determine if the
players' present rankings, set in

the preseason, are justified. Gould
indicated that the rankings might
be misleading because eight to 10
of the top players in the country
were not in school during the fall
quarter and were not ranked be
cause of that.
"While I believe that we have
three players [Hippensteel, Kim
and Abrams] who are capable of
being ranked in the top of the
country, this tournament will help

determine how good they really
are compared to the rest of the
players," Gould said.
Located at the SherwOod Coun
try Club, the National Collegiate
Tennis Classic, nicknamed the
"Wimbledon of Collegiate Ten
nis" is the first major invitational
collegiate tournament of the sea
son. It usually extends invitations
to those teams that finished in the
top eight in the country at the end

of the prior season. Stanford has
been invited to the National Colle
giate Tennis Classic for more than
20 years in a row.
Although the National Colle
giate Tennis Classic will have an
important impact on the individual
rankings of the players, team com
petition does not begin until Jan.
26, when Stanford hosts Hawaii.
I'his marks the actual beginning of
the men's tennis season.
