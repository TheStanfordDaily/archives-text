enth and sixth respectively, be
hind fifth-place Stanford in the
conference.
Stanford's plav at last week's
UC-Santa Barbara / Elephant
Bar Collegiate Invitational was
good enough for fourth place and
gave the young squad vital game
experience playing together.
"In the Santa Barbara tourna
ment, we had success when we
dictated the action and were ag
gressive," head coach Ruben
Nieves said. "We took advantage
and converted opportunities that
our opponents gave us."
The team, which boasts eight
players with freshman status, has
already proved that it can't be
overlooked this season. This
weekend, the men hope to give
Stanford fans further confidence
in their potential.
UCSD. which finished 5-20
last season, will be a good chance
for the men to ease into their sea
son. In the past three years. Stan
ford has only dropped one game
to the Tritons in six matches.
Though ranked No. (i among di
vision 111 teams, the Tritons are
the only division 111 team in the
conference, and their record re
veals the disadvantage.
"There's no hiding the fact
that they've struggled." Nieves
said of the Tritons. "But certain
ly we have to approach it as an
important match and a chance to
get to a 1-0 start. It's an opportu
nity to continue the momentum
started in the Santa Barbara
tournament."
Returning for UCSD is junior
outside hitter Zack Hite, who led

the team with 303 kills and aver
aged 3.74 kills per game last sea
son. New to the squad is head
coach Ron Larsen, hoping to
turn around a streak of unsuc
cessful seasons for the Tritons.
Although coming off a
year term as head men's and
women's coach at Rutgers;!
where he claimed the New Jersey
Athletic Conference Coach of
the Year in 1996 and 1998,
Larsen is no stranger to West
Coast volleyball. In the 1980's,
Larsen led California's club vol
leyball team to a 102-29 record
before assisting at St. Mary's and
UC-Davis.
On Sunday, the Cardinal will
battle the Aztecs. Last season,
Stanford claimed both victories
against the team, dropping only
one game to San Diego State,,
who finished 3-17, but the Cardk
nal isn't taking anything for
granted this year.
"San Diego State has typically
been a much more athletic and
physical team than UCSD,"
Nieves said. "This year should be
no exception. The game against
San Diego State should be much
more of an even matchup."
As for the new home court,
Nieves doesn't expect it to pose a
problem for his team. Other sea
sons, the team has played one or
more matches in Maples, so the
transition should not come as a
big shock.
"We enjoyed the intimacy of
Burnham Pavilion," Nieves said,
"but we've reached a point in the
development of the program that
we should be in Maples. I don't
expect a full house, but in terms
of continuing to develop as a pro
gram. we need to play in
Maples."
