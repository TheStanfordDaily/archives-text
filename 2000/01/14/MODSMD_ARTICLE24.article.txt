# Struggle over Land Use Plan continues

### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Staff writer 
Stanford's land use plan, including
the proposed construction of a 20.(XX)
square-foot think tank in the foothill
region south of Junipero Serra
Boulevard, continues to face contro
versy from the community.
Although the University has vet to
gain approval of its General Use Per
mit, Stanford has leased a plot of land
south of Junipero Serra to the
Carnegie Foundation for the Ad
vancement of Teaching, a think tank
for research and policy studies on
teaching and learning, according to
Ciay Clyburn, the foundation's direc

tor of communication.
"We have an offer from Stan
ford." said Clyburn. "[They] invited
us to locate our research center on
land that they own."
According to Clyburn, the
Carnegie Foundation is currently lo
cated in Menlo Park. "We are a re
search and policy center for teach
ing." she said. "We will of course col
laborate with Stanford and all of the
other educational providers in the
state."
The possibility of development in
has angered those seeking open space
protection in the foothills.
The revised development plan
submitted to Santa Clara County on

Nov. 15 delineated an academic
growth boundary, encompassing
lands south of Junipero Serra and ex
tending into the foothills. The plan is
intended to guide the use of Universi
ty land in Santa Clara County for the
next 10 years.
The proposed Carnegie think tank
would join the Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences,
which is already located in the area
under discussion.
Adding to Stanford's difficulties,
the Midpeninsula Regional Open
Space District, a Los Altos-based in
dependent public agency seeking to
preserve open land, issued a resolu
tion Wednesday urging Stanford to

provide permanent protection for
open space.
"Our hoard has been following
very closely the process of Stanford's
development plan," said Malcolm
Smith, public affairs manager for the
District.
According to the resolution
adopted this week, Stanford's plan is
faulty because it lacks "any perma
nent or even long-term definition of
the use of open space areas to the
south and west of Junipero Serra
Boulevard and Foothill Expressway,
and straddling Interstate 280."
Stanford's director of government
and community relations, Larry Hor
ton, was unavailable for comment.
