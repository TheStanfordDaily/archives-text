# Bare slopes at Tahoe greet students
## Spring skiing in January? 
### Amy Christeson Contributing writer 
The issue of global warming has
long been a concern of scientists, and
now it's becoming a bit of an issue for
Stanford students.
Although the climate change is
said to be an international phenome
non, Stanford students are personal
ly feeling the effects of a warmer and
drier winter.
Many dorms, including Cedro,
Rinconada and Junipero, went on
their annual ski trips to Lake Tahoe
this past weekend. Many more are
taking advantage of Monday's holi
day to visit the mountains this week
end. For all students planning to ski
or snowboard, the snow, or lack
thereof, is a major concern.
Dave Vasen, a freshman living in
Junipero, went to Heavenly in South
Lake Tahoe to snowboard this past
weekend. He returned to Stanford
without hitting the slopes. "The man
behind the ticket counter basically
told me that it wasn't worth my 48
bucks," he said. "The upper runs
were closed, and the lower runs were
pretty much ice and rocks."
Brandon Reavis, another Ju
nipero freshman, agrees that ski con

ditions were below average. "I felt
like I was skiing on rocks," he said.
Lake Tahoe has received only a
few inches of snow this season, in
contrast to last year, when the moun
tain was open from mid-October to
the end of May. The lack of snow
makes for a very poor base layer and
rough skiing. Only 30 percent of
Heavenly's runs were open as of lrfst
weekend and those runs that were
open were covered mainly in man
made snow.
Not only does the warm weather
melt any snow that does fall, it also
makes snow-making difficult. In
order to make snow, the tempera
tures need to be well below freezing.
Michelle Forrest, a freshman liv
ing in Rinconada, said she is "certain
that Alpine [where Rinconada ski
ied] had much better conditions than
Heavenly."
Many more dorms, including
Larkin and Gavilan, are preparing to
travel to the mountains this weekend.
According to CNN's meteorolo
gists, they may experience better con
ditions. The forecast for this weekend
is for a high of 37 degrees Farenheit
and a low of 16 degrees.
Snowfall is predicted for Friday
and Saturday.
