## They Could Have Danced All Night 
### Katie Leonberger Contributing writer 
The Stanford Ballroom Dance Team has un
dergone vast improvement in the last couple of
years. Broken apart five years ago. the Dance
Team became an official, yet little-known, ASSU
organization two years ago.
, Thanks to the extensive efforts of second-year
graduate mechanical engineering student Robert
Artuz, the team's president, the Stanford Dance
Team has been revitalized.
Artuz arrived at Stanford two years ago after
being a member of the Rensselaer Polytechnic In
stitute dance team as an undergraduate there. "1
think [the Stanford Dance Team] was an official
ASSU organization for one year, but was not a well
organized team before 1 got here," explained
Artuz.
On the East Coast, ballroom dance teams are
established, well-known elements of most schools.
While some schools in the Bay Area, such as UC-
Berkeley and San Jose State University, have
teams, Stanford's Dance Team is "trying to get
.something.going with that competitive aura," ac
cording to sophomore Alisha Niehaus.
Niehaus, the financial officer and vice president
of the Stanford Ballroom Dance Team, empha
sized that "the main focus is on taking people to
competitions within California and giving perfor
mances in the Bay Area."
The Stanford Dance Team organizes social
dance classes and encourages participants to per
form and compete. The team offers classes for all
levels of dancers, from beginners to advanced stu
dents.
Niehaus emphasized that classes are for every
one. "You can have two left feet or be a total klutz.
Classes are to give people a basis for musicality,
technique, and understanding how to dance."
Artuz stressed that you do not have to be inter
ested in competition to take classes. While the
dance craze sweeps the nation, as illustrated by the
addition of "dance sport" to the Olympics, Artuz
explained that "we want to get students on campus
more interested."
Classes are held once a week on Monday or
Tuesday evenings. Two types of classes are taught:
International Latin, which includes rhumba,
samba, cha-cha and jive; and International Stan
dard, which includes tango, foxtrot, waltz, Vien
nese Waltz, and quickstep. For more information,
check the team's Web Site at
www.stanford.edu/group/sbdt.
All classes and team practices are open to the
entire Stanford community, including faculty and
professors. And while being a member of the team
is not required to enroll in class, it is suggested.
"The San Francisco Bay Area is a great place for
competition and instruction," added Artuz, as he

praised the well-known instructors of the Stanford
classes. Stephen and Denise Kraul are nationally
renowned dance competitors who leave their busy
Imperial Dance Studio in Redwood City to instruct
the Stanford community.
If the size of the program is any indication of suc
cess, the Stanford Ballroom Dance Team is off to a
fantastic start. There are between 1 (X) and 150 peo

pie who have taken or are taking classes. And al
though fewer people come to the team practices
throughout the week, the team is still strong.
Last quarter, the Dance Team was put to the test
as it entered its first competition — and passed
with flying colors. The team finished second out of
seven area schools in a team match at the San Jose
State competition.
