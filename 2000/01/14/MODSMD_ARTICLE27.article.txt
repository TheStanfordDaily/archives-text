# Writing on the walls: Co Ho's mural legacy
## 
### Gloria Huang Contributing writer 
While it seems as if nearly everything else in the Coffee House has been
changed, the large, colorful mural on the back wall remains untouched and un
harmed.
"Well, almost," laughs the artist, junior Alexa Gerrity. "Last year, in the old
Co Ho, the tables were so crowded that chairs had gouged and scraped off
some of the paint. I had to repair a rather large section.'

Melody Lambelet, a manager at the Co 1 10. maintains that the painting was
never moved at all during renovations. "A sheet was placed over the mural
during construction so that it wouldn't he damaged, and they just painted
around it."
Lambelet acknowledged that the colors of the new Co Ho, yellow and pur
ple, were chosen to match the hues used in the mural.
Gerrity, who won ;i contest to paint the mural spring quarter of her fresh
man year, says that she used light, warm colors to convey the relaxed, happy
feeling in the painting scene.
"I was so happy to paint this mural!" she admits, smiling. "It was just he
fore finals, and 1 wanted to procrastinate and relax ... the mural just sort of
oozed out of me."
It took Gerrity an impressively brief 17 hours to complete the mural.
"The old Co Ho was more dark, and it was a place to hang out, but also a
place to study," remembers Gerrity. "I wanted to paint a bright, stress-free
scene ... kind of a fantasy during finals."
Gerrity points out that the drinks in the painting are modeled after actual
Co Ho drinks, and the book at the bottom of the pile in the painting is inspired
by a physics text from her least favorite class.
Although she knew the Co Ho would keep her painting (the manager told
her when she painted it that he wanted it to stay in the renovated Co I lo). Ger
rity is delighted to hear numerous people approach her to tell her how happy
they are to see her mural.
"They say, Tm so glad it's still there! It's the last thing that's still there, it's
the last part of the old Co I lo!'," Gerrity said.
Regarding the revamped Co 1 10, Gerrity carefully states, "I think change is
always hard to accept at first, because you're used to things. The old Co I lo was
cozy, and the new lighting is very bright... but. I mean, people are still here.
It's still hard to find a table."
Gerrity adds that perhaps the yellow and purple color scheme used in the
new Co Ho does not work as well with the mural as intended, as the new Co
Ho's colors are slightly darker and colder than the warm colors used in her
painting.
"I don't think there's any mistaking that a girl painted [the mural]— The
colors arc very bright and feminin£"
However, she admits, "The mural personalizes [the Co Ho], I think. If it
wasn't here, the feel would be a lot different, because there's nothing on the
other walls."
Ixtmbelet addresses this possible shortcoming by assuring, "There are
more paintings and posters in the back that we are planning to put back up on
the walls — we just haven't gotten around to it yet. We won't leave everything
blank."
Lambelet adds that she thinks the painting works well in the Co I lo: "I like
it. It's very colorful, it's coffee house-ish. there's music involved."
Gerrity confirms that the painting style used in the mural was inspired by
"cafe art — usually light, happy, and around coffee houses." and that the mu
sician serenading the three girls was inspired by musicians who often played at
the old CoHo.
"When all my friends saw the blond girl, they said, 'That's you!" But that
wasn't intentional at all," Gerrity says.
