It's academe's secret shame.
At campuses all over the country
— from West Coast powerhouses
Stanford and IJC-Berkeley to East
Coast Ivy League pillars Yale and
Columbia — students are showing
their true intellectual colors as they
shell out their e-dollars.
A quick survey of e-retailer
Amazon.com's new "purchase cir
cles" feature, which tracks the most
popular books ordered by geo
graphical region, company or edu
cational institution, gives an idea of
how college students are really
spending their free time.
And it's not a pretty picture.
The top three books among
Stanford students, in order
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of
Azkaban"; "Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone" and (Drumroll?
Why bother?) "Harry Potter and
the Chamber of Secrets."
Before you shake your head and
wonder what your fellow students
are thinking — or, perhaps more to
the point, what they're not thinking
— consider this:
Top three books at Yale? "I larry
Potter and the Prisoner of Azka
ban": "I larry Potter and the Sorcer
er's Stone" and ... "Harry Potter
and the Chamber of Secrets"!
Columbia's top buys? 1 larry Pot
ter. 1 larrv Potter, I larry Potter.
Brown? I larrv. I larry. I larry.
MIT? Princeton? Our cross-Bav
rivals at Cal? The magical Mr. Pot
ter has them all locked up, too.
Though this survey's far from
comprehensive, it certainly points
to a trend. College students all over
the country seem to be reaching for
books they'll be able to sell used at
elementary schools.
Don't think the anti-intellectual
ism stops at the printed page. Ama
zon also ranks, for web-surfing arm
chair sociologists, the preferred
video purchases of college cus
tomers. The big winner overall?
Tae-bo aerobics tapes.
Besides providing ample fuel for

cheap jokes and shallow compar
isons. Amazon's purchase circles
;ire intended to give customers
some sense of what their neighbors
in the real world are ordering. "It's
essentially a community-building
feature that we hope
will help customers make informed
purchase decisions and get gift ideas
for friends, relatives and business
associates," Amazon spokeswoman
Ling Hong told the Daily in an e
mail. "All purchase circles are based
on multiple purchases from at least
2(K) registered Amazon.com cus
tomers and as many as millions. We
arrive at the lists by aggregating pur
chase information."
You can find a purchase circle
for just about anything — your
town, your company, your state,
your hospital or your favorite gov
ernment institution — and find out
what your friends, neighbors and
co-workers are REALLY reading
(or watching, or listening to).
In addition to posting each
group's most popular books. Ama
zon uses an algorithm to provide
lists of books "unique" to each
group. I longdecribes these picks as
what the group is buying more of in
comparison to the rest of the cus
tomer population," giving a bit of
distinctiveness to each list — and. of
course, filtering out the heavily
sought-after 1 larry Potter.
The "unique" lists provide plen
ty of opportunities for shallow gen
eralizations. Stanford's top
"unique" book: Phillip Zimbardo's
"Psychology and Life." Number
two's looks like a Silicon Valley
lave: "Java 1.1."
Cal's top choices embrace the
distant worlds of race and space: on
top is "Construction of Racial Iden
tities in China and Japan.'' followed
by "Physical Processes in the Inter
stellar Medium and "Human-Com
puter Interaction."
Impractical fools. Armed with
the otherworldly magic of Harry
Potter and the real-world might of
Java applets, the Cardinal will rule
the world.
