### Alice Brown Editorial staff 
I he Stanford Medical Center
ended the 2()th century on a shaky
note, with the dissolution of the
I'('SF-Stanlbrd merge.
But I (diversity President (ierhard
Casper's announcement last week
that the Medical ( enter s highest po
sition will he divided into two — a
vice president to oversee strategic
planning, financial affairs and exter
nal relations and a dean responsible
for the academic program of the
Medical School has given the cen
ter a more upbeat outlook.
Dean I-Algetic Bauer will take on
the role of vice president and will be
responsible "for creating an overall
clinical strategy that will minimize re
dundancies and effectiv ely use scarce
resources." Casper said. I lis office
will oversee external affairs, includ
ing government relations and devel
opment.
The new dean, who will be ap
pointed by a search committee over
seen by Provost John I lennessy. will
have "the traditional and undimin
ished decanal responsibilities for the
medical school's academic affairs."

to the Provost.
History
I he idea of separating the role of
the dean and vice president of the
Medical Center was originally pro
posed in 1994 but was not undertak
en due to the merger between IJCSI
and Stanford. Casper said the com
plexity of the Center — it is com
posed both of the medical school and
the hospital and clinics — necessitat
ed the restructuring. In quantifying
the enormous scale on which the
Medical Center operates, he said. "If
one adds the budget ol the hospital
and clinics (a distinct legal entity) to
the overall University expenditures
on the medical school, that total
would constitute about half of the

l diversity's budget."
This fall's decision to disintegrate
the UCSF-Stanford merger caused
Casper and Bauer to revisit the idea
of restructuring, and they ultimately
decided to split Bauer's position into
two.
Academic program
One of the major benefits of the
creation of a dean for academic af
fairs is that the Medical School will fi
nally get the attention it deserves
and has been lacking, according to
Prof. Ken Mclmon. a professor of
medicine and molecular biology and
associate dean for post-graduate
medical education.
"For months the focus has been
more on the financial status of the
Medical Center," he said. " The acad
emic program has suffered while all
the attention has been focused on
money. The dean needs to focus on
curriculum and scholarship."
Mclmon says he's "all for"the di
vision of responsibility. I lc said he is
glad that the administration has final
ly "come to grips with the fact that the
workload is so great it requires two
people."
Mclmon is not alone in supporting
this reorganization. Robert Joss,
dean of the Graduate School of Busi
ness. also favors the split.
"My personal view is that it makes
a lot of sense, as being dean of a pro
fessional school and running a huge
medical center complex are two very
different tasks, requiring different
skills, and both full time endeavors,"
he said.
Concerns
Mclmon said his main concern
about the separation ol dean and vice
president involves filling the dean po
sition.
Casper announced a very short
time span for the search: "Given the
