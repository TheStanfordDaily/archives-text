# Post office experiencing transition troubles
## 
### Marisa Taylor Contributing writer 
Those looking for efficient lines
at the post office may have to wait
a few months longer. Complica
tions involved in moving post of
fice facilities to the temporary lo
cation next to Levin Field have left
customers waiting in long lines and
students wondering when that
next check from home will finally
arrive.

Though the temporary location
luis only been in operation for
about two weeks, students have al
ready begun complaining that ser
vice and lines at the new site rival
the slow pace of the old post office.
"My average wait time has been
45 minutes," said freshman Bran
don Rcavis, concerning the
amount of time he has spent wait
ing in line for packages at the new
facility. "It seemsasif the wait time
is a lot longer [than at the old facil

ity] and there doesn't seem to lie
an organized system."
Other student complaints re
garding the temporary post office
include that packages take unrea
sonably long amounts of time to
arrive and that the office is "totally
understaffed" and "claustropho
bic."
"I just waited half-an-hour in
line to find out that (the post office
workers| could not find my pack
age," said senior Ryan Swinnev.

"Another time. I picked up an
overnight package that took three
weeks to get here."
Sean Hansen, a graduate stu
dent in electrical engineering, said.
"There are only two workers to
serve the 20 people in line. And 1
just got a letter [that was sent to
me | from the end of December."
