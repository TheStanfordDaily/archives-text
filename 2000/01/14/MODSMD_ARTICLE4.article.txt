# Post office experiencing transition troubles
## 
### Marisa Taylor Contributing writer 
Those looking for efficient lines
at the post office may have to wait
a few months longer. Complica
tions involved in moving post of
fice facilities to the temporary lo
cation next to Levin Field have left
customers waiting in long lines and
students wondering when that
next check from home will finally
arrive.

Though the temporary location
luis only been in operation for
about two weeks, students have al
ready begun complaining that ser
vice and lines at the new site rival
the slow pace of the old post office.
"My average wait time has been
45 minutes," said freshman Bran
don Rcavis, concerning the
amount of time he has spent wait
ing in line for packages at the new
facility. "It seemsasif the wait time
is a lot longer [than at the old facil

ity] and there doesn't seem to lie
an organized system."
Other student complaints re
garding the temporary post office
include that packages take unrea
sonably long amounts of time to
arrive and that the office is "totally
understaffed" and "claustropho
bic."
"I just waited half-an-hour in
line to find out that (the post office
workers| could not find my pack
age," said senior Ryan Swinnev.

"Another time. I picked up an
overnight package that took three
weeks to get here."
Sean Hansen, a graduate stu
dent in electrical engineering, said.
"There are only two workers to
serve the 20 people in line. And 1
just got a letter [that was sent to
me | from the end of December."

resorted to sending responses by e
mail in addition to regular mail
after hearing student concerns with
post office delays.
According to Hill Johnston, the
registrar of post office boxes, disor

you're moving I().()()() post office
boxes across campus."
He pointed out that long lines
have always been a problem, even
at the old post office, and that the
workers are doing their best to ac

"Converting the old IJ.l J . (). box

numbers to the new ones slows
down the process." Johnston said.

For people sending packages
and letters to Stanford. Johnston
suggests using the extra four digits
at the end of the regular five-digit
zip code, which he says can help to
speed up the organizational
process.
Despite the slow service, other
students have expressed under
standing with regard to the delays.

"A lot of inconvenience has to be
expected when you move a whole
post office," said senior Brian
Kwan.
The temporary site near Flo
rence Moore Hall and Mayfield
Avenue will be in operation for the
remainder of the 1999-2000 school
year. The new post office, which
should be completed in nine to 10
months, promises to be more effi
cient than its White Plaza prede
cessor thanks to its larger size and
designated areas for vending ma
chines and retail and self-service.
