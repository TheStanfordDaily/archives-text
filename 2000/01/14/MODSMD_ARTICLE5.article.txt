## 
### Ani Khondkaryan Contributing writer 
Extensive renovations will begin
at Toyon I (all over spring break and
will continue until the end of the sum
mer as part of the Capital Improve
ment Program, a 16-year renovation
program that upgrades older housing
facilities at Stanford.
The goal of the construction is to
bring Toyon into compliance with
current safety standards, as well as to
beautify it.
Although originally the project
was supposed to take place after the

residents left for summer break, it be
came clear that it was necessary to
start construction during spring quar
ter because the renovations are too
extensive to finish in 10 weeks.
Ihe students who drew into
I'oyon last spring quarter were un
aware of the impending construction.
For their benefit, the officials of
the Capital Improvement Program
organized an informational meeting
at Toyon last night.
During the meeting, they ad
dressed issues of special concern to
the students.
The CIP informed the students

that it plans to spend $13 million on
renovations â€” the largest sum spent
on such a project in any of the resi
dences at the I Jnivcrsitv to date.
The Capital Improvement Project
has been planning the project lor
more than ;i year.
The work done in the spring will
include removal of roof tiles, seismic
work and scaffolding.
"We've tried to pick areas that are
the least intrusive to work on over the
spring quarter." said I'liil Capin. a
general contractor present at the
meeting.
Since the construction will involve

moderate to high levels of noise and
dust, the contractors promised that
the very noisy work on rooftops, in at
tics and in lavdown areas will he per
formed only between 10 a.m. and 4
p.m. on weekdays.
There will be no site work during
dead week and finals week.
" I he construction will have an im
pact. but it will be manageable. We
can work through this." said Rodger
Whitney, director of Student Hous
ing Services.
