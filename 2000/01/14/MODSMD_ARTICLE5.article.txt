## 
### Ani Khondkaryan Contributing writer 
Extensive renovations will begin
at Toyon I (all over spring break and
will continue until the end of the sum
mer as part of the Capital Improve
ment Program, a 16-year renovation
program that upgrades older housing
facilities at Stanford.
The goal of the construction is to
bring Toyon into compliance with
current safety standards, as well as to
beautify it.
Although originally the project
was supposed to take place after the

residents left for summer break, it be
came clear that it was necessary to
start construction during spring quar
ter because the renovations are too
extensive to finish in 10 weeks.
Ihe students who drew into
I'oyon last spring quarter were un
aware of the impending construction.
For their benefit, the officials of
the Capital Improvement Program
organized an informational meeting
at Toyon last night.
During the meeting, they ad
dressed issues of special concern to
the students.
The CIP informed the students

that it plans to spend $13 million on
renovations â€” the largest sum spent
on such a project in any of the resi
dences at the I Jnivcrsitv to date.
The Capital Improvement Project
has been planning the project lor
more than ;i year.
The work done in the spring will
include removal of roof tiles, seismic
work and scaffolding.
"We've tried to pick areas that are
the least intrusive to work on over the
spring quarter." said I'liil Capin. a
general contractor present at the
meeting.
Since the construction will involve

moderate to high levels of noise and
dust, the contractors promised that
the very noisy work on rooftops, in at
tics and in lavdown areas will he per
formed only between 10 a.m. and 4
p.m. on weekdays.
There will be no site work during
dead week and finals week.
" I he construction will have an im
pact. but it will be manageable. We
can work through this." said Rodger
Whitney, director of Student Hous
ing Services.
Another issue of special concern
to students is the anticipated loss of
parking spaces due to the construc
tion.
The CIP assured them that alter
native parking lots will be provided
during that period.
The contractors promised regular
weekly advance updates for the resi
dents.
Should students have any other
concerns, they can contact the offi
cials of the Capital Improvement
Program through e-mail and a hot
line.
"The renovations will restore

Toyon's original grandeur," said Roll
Faste, the dormitory's resident fel
low.
In addition. Student Housing Ser
vices plans to provide additional
house funds to assist with programs
that will reduce the stress levels of the
students.
The proposed programs include a
series of off-campus excursions, spe
cial meals and free ear plugs.
"It seems like they're doing every
thing they can to accommodate stu
dents," said sophomore Sophie Terp
after the meeting.
"We'll get through it, and the
dorm should look beautiful next
year," said senior Sarah Smith, one of
the resident assistants at Toyon.
