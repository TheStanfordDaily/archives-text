Have you ever noticed how
many magazines on the
bookstore shelf have a miracle
diet on the cover? Not just
'Glamour and Cosmo, but Men's
Health and GQ too. Our weight
obsessed culture undermines our
self-esteem by holding up ideals
that are impossible to achieve.
And it puts beauty and health at
odds.
Women's Issues: Little girls are
raised with Barbie dolls as role
models. Her shape pushes thin
ness to a ridiculous extreme (if
Barbie were a real person, she'd
have to walk on all fours to sup
port her proportions). And
although womens' fashion por
tray stick-thin models as the ideal,
99% of women could never look
like that because of their genetic
make-up.
Men's Issues: Men are coming
under increasing pressure to
sculpt the perfect Calvin Klein
slim-line body Male models have
well-defined muscles and no
body fat. And although these
well-buffed models are the male
ideal, 99% of men could never
achieve this look because of their
genes.
Restrictive Diets
Many students diet to achieve an
impossible weight goal. But
dieting is not the solution. It is, in
fact, counter-productive. Restric
tive diets:
■ Don't ultimately work. Your
weight is genetically pro
grammed. When you eat less,
your metabolism (the speed
and efficiency which the body
X.V T Ut
What did this Stanford
student have to go through in
1894 to get such a painfully
thin waist?
burns calories for fuel) becomes
sluggish. Your system fights to
keep every pound as if
fighting off starvation: the
harder you diet the more your
body resists losing weight.
Ninety percent of all
"successful" dieters soon
revert to their old weight.
■ Are unhealthy. You deprive
yourself of essential nutrients
which are almost impossible
to get on vacuous diet foods.
Also, people who "yo-yo diet"
(alternatively gain and lose
weight) are at greater risk for
health problems.
■ Are potentially dangerous.
Dieting disturbs your
relationship to food. It can
make you afraid of eating
normally. This can lead to
disorders such as anorexia,
bulimia, bingeing, and com
pulsive over-exercising.
■ Are boring, and they can
make you boring. When you
restrict your eating you also
restrict your interests, and
obsess about food and weight
until that's all you think and
talk about.
■ Are emotionally draining.
They substitute an external,
unattainable image of beauty
for genuine self-esteem.
Managing Weight
Commit to self-nurturing, not
self-deprivation: choose eating
habits you can keep for a life
time. Here's some tips:
■ Choose a nutritious diet,
including an adventurous
variety of fresh, whole foods
(enjoy their color, taste,
aroma and texture; avoid
processed foods).
■ Enjoy reasonable exercise
(moving your body burns
calories, builds lean body
mass, and can reduce stress,
build self-esteem, and give
you more energy)
■ Eat slowly, regularly and
often (studies show that
people who eat three to five
small meals a day success
fully maintain a healthy
weight; eating breakfast can
make you feel less hungry)
■ All foods can fit into a well
balanced diet, so go for the
80/20 rule: if you eat well 80%
of the time, you can indulge
the other 20% of the time)
■ Examine why you want to
control your weight, and the
price you are paying for it
■ Reject media images; accept and
value yourself by taking good
care of your body and soul
If you are concerned that you are
overweight, don't deprive your
self of food. Consider seeing a
clinician to help you set realistic
weight goals based on your body
type and frame, and to establish
an enjoyable, healthful, eating
plan. Q
