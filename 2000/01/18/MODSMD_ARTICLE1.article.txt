# After Midnight program attracts some night owls
## 
### Caroline Clabaugh 
One-thirty a.m. on a rainy Sat
urday — who's at Tresidder Fit
ness? In previous quarters the an
swer certainly would have been
"no one," with the gym closing at
11 p.m. Now. with the newly initiat
ed Stanford After Midnight pro
gram, Tresidder Fitness is open
until 2 a.m. every night of the week.
But are students making use of
the newly extended hours?
According to Dean of Students
Marc Wais, no formal assessment
of facility usage during the extend
ed hours has yet been undertaken,
although casual observation shows
people using the facilities. Wais
noted that winter quarter, with its
rain, darkness and typically heavy
course loads, is probably not the
best time of year for usage of ex
tended hours. Yet. it serves as a
"good barometer to see if the con
cept makes sense."
The concept certainly seems to
make sense; student response has
been overwhelmingly positive. Se
niors Ryan Swinney and Carlos
Chandler, two brave souls who
were lifting weights at Tresidder
Fitness at 1:30 a.m. last Saturday,
were thrilled to be able to extend
their typical nine to 11 p.m. work
out schedule.
Swinney said, "It's nice to be
able to eat, study and get every
thing done, and then go work out.
I'm a night person anyway." Nights
are the "onlv time when there are

no sections or classes," said Chan
dler.
Students seem especially excit
ed about Late Night's extended
hours.
"Late Night open until two a.m.
will be great during midterms and
finals," said freshman Tomoko
Sakai.
"I'll be able to inject fat into my
heart even later." noted freshman
Lavanya Chekuru.
Just what is open? Facilities and
services such as the meeting rooms
in Tresidder, the Computer Lair,
the Coffee House, deGuerre
Courts. Ford Center and Late
Night food service have been open
until 2 a.m. since Jan. 6, and start
ing sometime in winter quarter, the
first two floors of Meyer Library
will be open 24 hours.
Not all facilities have been uti
lized until 2 a.m.. however. The
deGuerre racquetball and squash
courts, for example, tend to be va
cated by midnight.
Stanford After Midnight is only
a winter quarter pilot program.
Usage and response will be as
sessed in March, and some hours
may be amended depending on fa
cility usage. Wais is excited and op
timistic about the prospects for
continuing the extended hours
given the initial response.
He said, "I hope that the stu
dents continue to use the facilities
so that the program can be contin
ued. The program is for the stu
dents, after all."
