# Chile elects socialist president
## 
### 
SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — In
the closest election since Chile's
return to democracy, Ricardo
Lagos was elected the first socialist
president since Salvador Allende
was overthrown in a 1973 coup.
Lagos, however, espouses none
of the Marxist radicalism of
Allende, who died in the coup that
ushered in the long dictatorship of
Gen. Augusto Pinochet. The presi
dent-elect talks little of old enmi
ties and even exhorted his defeated
rival, Joaquin Lavin, to help him
unify Chileans and look ahead, not
back toward the violent past.
With nearly all votes counted
from Sunday's vote, Lagos had 51.3
percent of the vote to Lavin's 48.6
percent, the government said.
More than 7.3 million of S million
registered voters peacefully cast
ballots in this South American
nation.
"Today we have created a Chile
that is more unified, a country unit
ed in democracy," said Lagos, 61, a
moderate socialist and candidate of
the Concertacion — the center-left
coalition that has governed Chile
since 1W(). "I will not forget the
past, but my eyes are on the future."
Lagos, who is to begin a six-year
term on March 11, will succeed
Eduardo Frei, who was constitu
tionally barred from re-election. In
the first round of voting on Dec. 12,
Lavin forced Lagos into a virtual
draw.

Pinochet opponents interrupted
Lagos' victory speech with repeated
and raucous chants of "Trial for
Pinochet!"
Most analysts agreed Pinochet's
situation had little if any influence
on the election. Both candidates
sought to distance themselves from
the former dictator during the race.
On Sunday, Lagos told the crowds
that any Pinochet trial is something
the courts must resolve.
"In my government, the courts
will decide what cases to try and I
will make sure that those decisions
are respected," he said.
Pinochet has been detained in
Britain since October I Wi on a
warrant from Spanish Judge Bal
tasar Gar/on. who wants to try the
general for alleged human rights
abuses during his rule.
British Home Secretary Jack
Straw said last week that doctors
have concluded Pinochet is too ill
to face trial, suggesting he might
send the former dictator home.
Lavin. 46, who studied eco
nomies at the University of Chica
go, was a strong supporter of
Pinochet's l l )73- l X) military regime
as a junior economist in the plan
ning ministry. He is a successful
two-term mayor of Las Condes,
Santiago's swankiest suburb.
Lagos, who has a doctorate in
economics from Duke University
and who taught at the University of
North Carolina, emerged as a lead

ing figure in the light against
Pinochet in the mid-1980s. He
spent much of the time during
Pinochet's rule in the United States
and in Buenos Aires. Argentina.
Before the first round of voting.
Lagos visited New York, seeking
potential investors.He has
promised to create more than
!()().()()() jobs and wants to create
unemployment insurance in Chile,
a country of 15 million people seek
ing to improve its social safety net.
Chile pioneered liberal, free
market policies in Latin America
with remarkable success in the mid
1980s. For over a decade, growth
averaged 7 percent annually, but
the country is now struggling to
escape its worst recession in 16
years.
Unemployment this year
reached a record 11 percent, but
signs of recovery have appeared.
lor months, the candidates
offered similar-sounding prescrip
tions to fight rising street crime, aid
struggling farmers and create hun
dreds of thousands of jobs.
In defeat. Lavin was gracious.
But he noted his was the strongest
showing by the Chilean right in
decades, harnessing a "spectacular
number of votes."
"Our coalition guarantees equi
librium and stability for Chile."
said Lagos, whose socialists are
partners with Frei's Christian
Democrats in the ruling coalition.
