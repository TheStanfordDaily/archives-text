# AIDS plagues Cambodian poor

### 
PHNOM PENH. Cambodia (AP) — In the shadow
of one of the Cambodian capital's top tourist attrac
tions, Nov Virak lies emaciated, hungry and delirious,
waiting for AIDS to claim his life.
The 30-year-old former soldier is one of about a
dozen homeless Cambodians living in a park next to the
hilltop pagoda Wat Phnom, isolated from their commu
nities since exhibiting symptoms of AIDS.
Extreme poverty, a rapidly changing society and
poor education have combined in Cambodia to create
one of the world's worst AIDS crises.
An estimated 200.000 Cambodians are infected with
HIV and the disease is spreading faster here that any
where else in Asia, health officials said late last year.
The problem of AIDS is difficult to understand for
Cambodians — "that healthy looking people can trans
mit the virus," Tia Phalla at the National AIDS Author
ity said.
The disease was unknown to Cambodia until the
early 19905, when a United Nations-brokered peace
agreement brought an end to strict communist rule.
Along with a new free-market economy came a Hood of
tourism, foreign investment, organized crime and pros
titution.
AIDS quickly found a home among an ignorant pop
ulation. nurtured hv poor health standards and mass
migrations of people returning to their communities
after decades of displacement by civil war.
Information campaigns and condom blitzes are
beginning to take effect, but the rate of AIDS transmis
sion among Cambodia's 11 million people is still climb

ing. with an estimated 1(X) people becoming infected
every day.
Tia Phalla said things could get much worse before
they get better.
"We know that HIV is moving west to east — mov
ing toward what we consider the heart of the country,
where more than 50 percent of Cambodians live," he
said.
Nov Virak, whose wife died of AIDS last summer, is
one of many who have fallen through gaping cracks in a
skeletal public health system. Aid workers have tried to
admit him into government-run hospitals, but the pen
niless ex-soldier inevitably winds up back at the park.
"I don't like the hospital," 1 he said in a whisper. "This
place isn't much better, but here my friends and neigh
bors help me and give me food."
Cambodia has 2.0(H) doctors and just 8,500 hospital
beds, dwarfed by the amount of people with HIV.
Home-based care by nurses or medical assistants is a
short-term answer, but AIDS activists say significant
social change is desperately needed.
Vira Avalokita. a health specialist and Buddhist
monk helping set up an AIDS ward at the Phnom Penh
Municipal Hospital, argues that education campaigns
on condom use are not enough to slow the spread of
AIDS.
"We need to teach these people hygiene," Avaloki
ta said in a phone interview from Seattle. "Cambodia is
not a modern society... they still believe in goblins and
ghosts, in hexes and curses. It makes it very hard to treat
(illnesses)."
