HADERA, Israel (AP) — A
pipe bomb hidden in a trash can
exploded today at a park in the
Israeli coastal town of lladera,
wounding 13 people in what Israeli
officials said was an attempt to
derail Mideast peacemaking.
The blast came during a critical
phase in Israel's peace talks with
the Palestinians and Syria. Prime
Minister Ehud Barak said last
week that Israel was bracing for
renewed attempts by Islamic mili
tants to disrupt the talks.
There was no imm&liate claim
of responsibility, but Israel's police
minister. Shlomo Hen-Ami, said he
suspected the Islamic Jihad, a small
group of Palestinian militants
opposed to Israeli-Palestinian
peacemaking.
Barak has warned he would
break off negotiations over a major
terror attack, but it appeared
unlikely he would do so over
today's blast.
Responding to the explosion,
Barak said in a statement that
Israel was "determined to act with
all its might to crush terrorism."
The bomb went off shortly after
11 a.m. local time in a small park
near a bank in downtown Madera,
close to the city's marketplace.
"I heard a loud boom and peo
ple were shouting. 'Terror attack!
Terror attack!"* said 40-year-old
passer-by Moshe Senado, who wit
nessed the blast. "People were on
the ground."
The pipe bomb was hidden in a
trash can, and flung garbage and
tree branches across the park and
the adjacent road. It did not shatter
nearby windows, however.
Shortly after the blast, a
paramedic hastily bandaged the
bloodied left hand of a man in his
60s. who appeared dazed as he
sipped water from a plastic cup
held by a passer-by.

Another wounded man. also
elderly, lay on the sidewalk before
being lifted onto a stretcher.
Border police officers in flak
jackets, armed with assault rifles,
patrolled the area, as security
forces and dogs searched for addi
tional explosives.
Officials at Madera's Millel Yale
Hospital said 13 people, many of
them elderly, were treated at the
hospital. One man was in moderate
condition, and the others were
lightly injured.
Deputy Defense Minister
Ephraim Sneh said the attack was
"part of the campaign against the
peace process."
Me said he thought today's
assailants had also carried out two
recent bombings in the nearby
town of Netanya.
A Nov. 8 explosion wounded 33
people, while a Dec. 24 blast
caused no injuries. Sneh said he did
not know the identity of the
assailants.

Past bombings have usually
been carried out by Hamas or
Islamic Jihad, two militant groups
based in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. I Jadera is located 30 miles
north of Tel Aviv, and is close to
the West Bank.
Last week, the Israeli army
arrested nearly two dozen Islamic
Jihad activists in the West Bank
amid reports that Israel had
received new warnings that the
group planned to carry out attacks.
In a newspaper interview last
week, Barak said he was aware
there were "enemies of the peace
process," and suggested that
attacks against Israeli targets could
have a detrimental effect on talks.
"Naturally we are prepared to
try to prevent this." he was quoted
as saying in Friday's editions of the
newspaper. Maariv. "It should be
remembered, there is no I(X) per
cent guarantee, and this could
affect the Syrian track, as well as
the Palestinian track."
