### 
BAGHDAD. Iraq (Al') — In a televised speech
marking the ninth anniversary of the Persian (lull War.
Saddam Hussein urged his enemies today to ask God
for forgiveness for crimes against Iraq — a clear refer
ence to I I.N. economic sanctions.
" The evildoers will have to ... prostrate themselves
before God, after first believing in Him." he said.
The I Jnited States and its allies began the assault on
Iraq nine years ago today in order to force it out of
Kuwait, which Saddam's forces had occupied seven
months earlier.
Iraq withdrew and signed a cease-fire but still claims
victory in what it called the "mother of all battles." It is
marking the anniversary this year with large-scale gov
ernment-sponsored festivities ranging from art shows,
gunfire and music parties that arc expected to continue
for 45 days.
Schoolchildren will be given lectures on the mean
ings and lessons of the war. Exhibitions will give an
extraordinary account of the devastation of the coun
try's economy and infrastructure during the I I.N. eco
nomic sanctions.
The embargo was imposed after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, and the government blames it for the
widespread poverty in Iraq.
"Those who delude themselves into believing that

the prolonged march may break the willpower of the
Iraqis have to stop relishing that delusion," Saddam
said in his speech.
The government usually marks the date of the war.
but it wasn't clear why it organized such elaborate cel
ebrations this year. It could be that Saddam feels more
assured of his hold over power at this point and Iraqis
are more confident than ever before that sanctions will
be suspended if not lifted soon.
The Kuwaiti daily Al-Anba today quoted Kuwait's
defense minister. Sheik Salem Al Sabah. as saying Iraq
remains a threat to Kuwait because it is still acquiring
weapons of mass destruction.
Also today, a team of I).N. oil experts held talks
with their Iraqi counterparts on ways to boost Iraq's oil
production capacity and to earn more money to meet
humanitarian needs, U.N. and Iraqi officials said.
This is the third visit by the experts since the start of
the U.N. approved oil-for-food program in 19%. I'he
program allows Iraq to sell oil in an exception to the
U.N. sanctions to buy food and other humanitarian
goods.
Iraqi oil officials said they would like the experts to
pay closer attention to the country's aging and dilapi
dated refineries currently churning out products below
international specifications.
