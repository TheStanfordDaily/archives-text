Medical Center's decision
not to accept Medicare
HMO plans is unfortunate

In an attempt to cut costs, the
Stanford Medical Center has
decided not to accept the cov
erage plans of Medicare HMO
patients.
T he decision not to serve these
patients, though made by many
hospitals recently, is especially
distressing because of the lack of
discussion and debate surround
ing it. The approximately 1,000
patients who the new policy will
affect were simply mailed letters
in late November informing them
that their coverage plans will no
longer be accepted.
Most of the affected patients
are former Stanford employees
and their dependents who decid
ed on the Medicare HMO cover
age because it has been offered to
them for almost 20 years. Since
marry "Tvf employees are
retired now, it is hard to imagine
that they will be able to easily
afford a different health coverage
plan.
Patients unable to find new
coverage will be forced to either
visil the emergency room for rou
tine medical care or to forgo care
altogether. The emergency room
option is not a positive alterna
tive because patients who choose
it will be forced to wait around
for hours before receiving the
care they need.
The decision reflects poorly on
the Center, which receives some
funding from the government

and should he expected in return
to provide service for govern
ment-sponsored programs.
Should Stanford be setting this
kind of a precedent for other uni
versity medical centers to follow?
Though this decision is sur
rounded by negative repercus
sions, it seems valid given the
budget constraints currently fac
ing the Medical Center due to the
dissolution of its merger with
UCSF.
Not accepting the coverage
plans of Medicare HMO patients
will save Stanford Medical Cen
ter $2 million per year. This is a
considerable savings until consid
ered alongside the costs it will
incur on the patients it affects.
If the Medical Center is
attempting to cut costs, Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper's
recent decision to split the posi
tions of dean and vice president
of the Center conflicts with these
goals and with the decision not to
accept Medicare HMO patients.
These jobs may absorb funds that
could be used to better benefit
patients.
In the future, the Medical Cen
ter should strive to make deci
sions that don't negatively affect
patients. If the implementation of
Casper's decision as well as the
Medical Center's decision cannot
be postponed, then the goal of
the hospital should be to consider
how they could reinstate Medi
care HMO coverage once their
financial woes are alleviated.
Given that the Center is a busi
ness, this goal does not seem
unattainable.
