## Life as a Citizen of Monoville

Mike Rosenbluth

I have always been an
overachiever. So when
everybody else got the
flu over winter break. I
decided to get mono.
In this case, however, I
don't think I'm the big
winner. I actually didn't

find out until last week. I guess I just thought
that my painfully sore throat and week and
a half of extreme fatigue was just a bad case
of the flu. But when the sore throat just
wouldn't go away, I decided to make the
feared trip to Cowell Student Health Cen
ter.
I think that Cowell gets a bit of a bad rap.
They do seem perfectly functional at diag
nosing their two signatures, mono and preg
nancy (so I hear on that last one). And the
kind nurse on the phone even offered to
make an appointment for the next day at the
time of my choice.
Though my doctor did profess to me that
he hadn't gotten into med school "the first
time around," he did seem to ask all the
right questions (you figure he had to do
something right the second time, right?).
I le also wanted to stay up-to-date on all
the latest pop culture, making sure that Dr.
Dre and Dr. Drew are really two different
people. I confirmed to him that while one is
a rapper, the other one is, according to the
Web site www.drDrew.com, a "Board Certi
fied Internist and addictionologist" who in
high school "rocked out to the music of
Deep Purple and The Doobie Brothers"
and now enjoys spending his time on the

radio advising teenagers between the ages of
12 and 17 to go see a doctor if something is
smelling a little funny down there.
When the (Cowell) doctor called me last
week with the news of mono, I was fairly
surprised that my test was positive. Then
when 1 thought about it more, 1 realized
something might have been wrong when I
satiated my body's apparent necessity for
caffeine with six cokes and a cup of coffee
the day before.
Overall though, I'm fine, which is why I
was so surprised with the responses when I
told all of my friends that I had mono. Reac
tions varied from the largely sympathetic
("Oh my god, I am so sorry Mike. Are you
OK? Can I make you some hot tea? How
about a video?") to the militantly concerned
("Mike, what are you doing up on a Friday
night at 6 p.m.? Go back to bed. Now!").
They don't seem to understand that,
though slightly fatigued, I am really fine.
Perhaps this is because my roommate
extended his bout with mono last year to
four months so that he could get his girl
friend to pick up and pay for an unlimited
amount of movies from Blockbuster Video
while he sat in bed.
1 have found that having mono is a good
excuse for getting out of anything you don't
want to do, such as attending house meet
ings. When a house staff member asks if 1
can make it, my response is "Oh, I can't. I
have mono." This, of course, gets the default
response, "Oh, I am so sorry. What are you
doing up at 9 p.m. on a Wednesday? Go to
bed!"

When you are at Miyake on a Saturday
night and the service for your two California
Rolls has taken an hour and a half, you can
also use this excuse. 1 just throw the mono
line, and. well, the wait isn't really any short
er. But I bet the waiter would say "Mono?
I'm so sorry. What are you doing awake at
8:30 p.m. on a Saturday? Here. Drink a Sake
Bomb!"
Or for instance, say you don't want to
wait for a coffee when the line is too long at
the Coffee House (which actually seems to
happen quite often now; wait, I already did
that column), I can just cut to the front of the
line and tell the cashier, "I'm sorry for cut
ting, but 1 have mono. Could I just get a reg
ular coffee, large, I mean venti size to go?"
To which the default response is, again, "Oh
1 am so sorry. What are you doing up at 4
p.m. on a Thursday? Why don't you just
have this one for free."
OK, so maybe 1 didn't get my coffee for
free, and maybe I don't actually use the
mono excuse to cut in line. The point is,
though, that I probably could. I guess it is
good that people are overly concerned
about my well being. It is certainly better
than if I was feeling crappy and nobody
cared. So here's my message to all future
recipients of mono: a lot of the time, it's not
as bad as you might think.

Mike Rosenbluih is a mono victim majoring
in Mechanical Engineering. He will be more
than happy to accept any Blockbuster rental
you bring his way.
