Stoppard contingency plan
On behalf of the Introduction to the
Humanities Program, I write to apologize to
all those persons who were not able to
attend the question-and-answer discussion
with playwright Tom Stoppard last Monday
night, Jan. 10.
Willi no pre-event tickets, we were
unable to predict the response to Stoppard
on campus. Last year's event featuring the
Freshman Book Author, novelist Charles
Johnson, drew only 150 people. This year,
the second year of the Freshman Book pro
gram, we were overwhelmed by the large
outpouring for Stoppard.
We were able to admit all the freshmen
who arrived during the period we adver
tised as reserved for freshman preferred
seating, as well as most of the freshmen who
came later. We were also able to admit a
large proportion of non-freshmen. Unfortu
nately, we were forced to turn away some
members of the general public who had
waited to be admitted, and for this we are
very sorry.
In spite of appearances, this event was
carefully planned since last summer. Our
intention was to hold Stoppard's visit in an
appropriate location. The type of event Mr.
Stoppard was most comfortable with was
not a lecture but an interactive question
and-answer discussion. The optimal space
on campus providing any degree of intima
cy for such an event and at the same time

seating a large number — WX) — was kres
ge Auditorium.
For everyone, including Mr. Stoppard,
holding his question-and-answer session in
Memorial Auditorium would have compro
mised the success of the evening. Anyone
who has attended any event involving seri
ous audience interaction in Memorial Audi
torium knows that the space is simply too
large to be suitable for such a program.
We did have a contingency plan for those
who were not able to get into Krcsge that
night. Mr. Stoppard was gracious enough to
let us videotape the event. We will make
this video — currently being edited — avail
able to students and other members of the
Stanford community through Meyer
Library Reserves by the end of January.
We are pleased that the choice of Tom
Stoppard's "Arcadia" as Freshman Book
has been so universally embraced. The
objective of the Freshman Book program is
to provide freshmen with a work reflecting
on themes addressed in I-Hum and under
scoring the value that study and reading in
the humanities bring to learning and to life.
Since this is only the second year of the
program, we are still learning how to
arrange the public aspect of these presenta
tions and how to make the Freshman Book
a significant component of the Stanford
experience. We welcome your views on
future books and authors, and we thank you
for your interest in Tom Stoppard.

Continuing the Bonfire
debate
In his letter (Friday, Jan. 14) criticizing
the ongoing dialogue regarding the Big
Game Bonfire, Adam Kemezis appears to
lose focus in building an argument based on
several rather tenuous lines of reasoning.
Having entered Stanford after Nov. 7,
IIW7l l W7 (The Daily issue which Kemezis cites
as the factual tome regarding the Bonfire), I
appreciate Corey Griffin's column. What
Kemezis forgets is that the majority of
undergraduates here now were not present
to read The Daily in 1997 and have been
exposed only to the mythologized Tiger
Salamander aspect of the Bonfire story.
What strikes me about the bulk of
Kemezis' letter, and as an item of the issue 1
had never been exposed to, is the apparent
dichotomy between housing and a cher
ished tradition. Kemezis attempts to make
anyone who is even vaguely pro-Bonfire an
agent adamantly against increased housing.
The idea that the administration and stu
dent body were forced to choose between
Lyman or the Bonfire strikes me as dubious
at best. Certainly, due to Lyman's location
relative to Lake Lagunita, the two items are

not mutually exclusive. But the cited issue
of "loud complaints from anyone" in close
proximity (i.e., Lagunita Court, the lake
houses and the nearer portions of Gover
nor's Corner) weakly justifies the removal
of an event that drew the bulk of campus
together.
Finally. Kemezis affronts the reader with
the tragedy of Texas A&M. In attempting
to vilify the thought of "building one of
these things," he shows either an extreme
ignorance about the two schools' bonfires
or a profound lack of sympathy for those
touched by what occurred last November.
The collapse of the A&M bonfire sadly
resulted from conditions that were entirely
man-made and preventable, not from con
ditions inherent in bonfires.
Rather than attempting to make the
administration "seem like villains" or to
find "someone to blame," continued discus
sion of the Big Game Bonfire only brings to
light events leading to the discontinuation
of our grandest tradition. In contrast,
Kemezis and those like him respond with
suspect knee-jerk statements in favor of the
status quo.
My hope resides in the ability of the two
debating sides to fully air their causes in
front of the new administration. Only then
can a fair decision be made.
