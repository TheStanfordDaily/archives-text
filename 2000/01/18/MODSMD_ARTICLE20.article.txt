But as the third-ranked team in
the nation should. Stanford calmly
withstood the storm, riding a string of
21 consecutive made free throws and
a big three-pointer from point guard
Mike McDonald to a crucial Pacific
10 Conference victory in front of a
riled-up. hostile crowd.
Following the Cardinal's 73-45
blowout of Oregon State Thursday
night, the win gave Stanford (14-1.3-
1 Pac-10) a sweep of the Oregon
schools on the Cardinal's first road
trip of the conference season.
"To get a sweep is huge." said

Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "1 don't think that many
teams are going to come up and get a
sweep here.
"We felt this was going to be a
tough game, and it was. Early on we
had trouble, but like we've done all
year, we worked through it and ad
justed."
Like the Beavers did against Stan
ford on Thursday night, the Ducks
(11-3, 2-1) came out strong early in
the game. On the strength of a sur
prisingly strong inside game. Oregon
held a four-point lead midway
through the first half.
Sophomore Chris Christofferson,
a lumbering 7-foot, 2-inch center
from Denmark, and junior Bryan
Bracey, a 6-foot-7 transfer from Mal
colm X College in Chicago, repeat
edly took it at the Cardinal's more
celebrated big men. Bracey. in partic
ular. seemed to have no trouble exe
cuting his baseline moves on Stan
ford freshman Curtis Borchardt.
1 iowever. the all-around game of
Stanford junior Jarron Collins, who
finished the day with 19 points and 13
rebounds, was even more effective.
Oregon repeatedly played off of
Collins, allowing hinr open looks
from the free-throw line, which
Collins had no trouble knocking
down. His 13 points and seven re
bounds in the first half helped the
Cardinal to establish a 39-34 lead at
the half.
"I know I can make a 15-footer."
said Collins, who has not always been
so confident in taking that shot when
left open. "It just has to be in the
rhythm."
In the second half. Stanford never
trailed, but the Ducks and their
