### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
EUGENE, Ore. — With just less
than three minutes left in Stanford's
game against Oregon Saturday night,
the Cardinal seemed to be in trouble.
Seven straight Oregon points had
whittled the Stanford lead to five
points, putting the McArthur Court
faithful into a frenzy.

But as the third-ranked team in
the nation should. Stanford calmly
withstood the storm, riding a string of
21 consecutive made free throws and
a big three-pointer from point guard
Mike McDonald to a crucial Pacific
10 Conference victory in front of a
riled-up. hostile crowd.
Following the Cardinal's 73-45
blowout of Oregon State Thursday
night, the win gave Stanford (14-1.3-
1 Pac-10) a sweep of the Oregon
schools on the Cardinal's first road
trip of the conference season.
"To get a sweep is huge." said

Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "1 don't think that many
teams are going to come up and get a
sweep here.
"We felt this was going to be a
tough game, and it was. Early on we
had trouble, but like we've done all
year, we worked through it and ad
justed."
Like the Beavers did against Stan
ford on Thursday night, the Ducks
(11-3, 2-1) came out strong early in
the game. On the strength of a sur
prisingly strong inside game. Oregon
held a four-point lead midway
through the first half.
Sophomore Chris Christofferson,
a lumbering 7-foot, 2-inch center
from Denmark, and junior Bryan
Bracey, a 6-foot-7 transfer from Mal
colm X College in Chicago, repeat
edly took it at the Cardinal's more
celebrated big men. Bracey. in partic
ular. seemed to have no trouble exe
cuting his baseline moves on Stan
ford freshman Curtis Borchardt.
1 iowever. the all-around game of
Stanford junior Jarron Collins, who
finished the day with 19 points and 13
rebounds, was even more effective.
Oregon repeatedly played off of
Collins, allowing hinr open looks
from the free-throw line, which
Collins had no trouble knocking
down. His 13 points and seven re
bounds in the first half helped the
Cardinal to establish a 39-34 lead at
the half.
"I know I can make a 15-footer."
said Collins, who has not always been
so confident in taking that shot when
left open. "It just has to be in the
rhythm."
In the second half. Stanford never
trailed, but the Ducks and their
hyped-up fans repeatedly gave the
Cardinal reason to pause.
Oregon junior guard Alex Scales
had 12 of his 21 points in the second
half, and star sophomore Freddie
Jones scored his only seven points of
the contest in the final period. The
Ducks actually made six more shots
than the Cardinal in the second half,
knocking down 16 to the Cardinal's
10.
But Stanford always seemed to hit
a big shot when it needed to.
When Oregon had cut the Cardi
nal lead to four with K:37 remaining,
senior David Moseley hit a big three
pointer to push the lead back to
seven. Then Moseley pushed a nine
point lead to 12 on another three
pointer with only 4:25 left on the
clock.
But McDonald's three was proba
bly even more crucial.
After a jumper from Scales, a fast
break dunk from Bracev and a Scales

three-pointer, the Cardinal lead
stood at a mere five points. Behind a
sea of noise unrivaled anywhere in
the conference, Oregon was streak
ing back into the game.
Montgomery quickly called a
timeout to stop the bleeding — but it
looked far from done. Following a
miss from Jarron Collins, Bracey
drove into traffic looking to score and
bring Oregon within three points.
However, Bracey was called for
traveling and then Scales was quickly
called for a foul on Moseley, who
calmly hit both free throws.
On the next Stanford possession.
McDonald got open on the right side
and knocked down the killer shot
with 1:52 to go.
"They left me wide open and I was
just lucky to hit it," said McDonald,
who finished with 12 points, seven of
which came off of free throws.
"Mike's three was huge," Mont
gomery said. "He has gottten bettter
and bettter. He had a fantastic road
trip."
Freshman Casey Jacobsen, who,
along with Madsen, seemed to en

dure the greatest punishment fromt
the crowd, turned in another fine per
formance in his second-straight start.
Jacobsen, who notched 16 points
against Oregon State, had 12 points
and seven assists. All of his scoring
came off of three-pointers, some
from NBA range and others with de
fenders squarely in his face, giving
him more than enough ammunition
to fire back at the crowd.
"I was feeling it," Jacobsen said.
"[But] 1 didn't say a word. I just
smiled. I think I'm entitled to a look
or a smile. It's harmless."
Madsen, however, didn't do too
much to quiet the verbal assault rain
ing down upon him. For the third
straight game, he had trouble putting
the ball into the basket, scoring only
four points. At times, the senior
leader actually looked uncomfort
able on the offensive end.
"It is frustrating." said Madsen,
who scored eight points against Ore
gon State and put up only two points
in Stanford's loss to Arizona. "I'm
just going to keep battling and the
shots will start falling."
