# Women rebound to torch Ducks
## 
### Kelsey Colvin Contributing writer 
The Cardinal gave its fans an
amazing show on Saturday.
Rebounding from a 26-point
deficit with around four minutes to
go in the first half, the Stanford
women's basketball team ham

mered the No. 24 Oregon Ducks
with a 78-62 victory.
"1 just thought that was unbeliev
able for us," said head coach Tara
VanDervecr. "I've been coaching a
long time and I've never seen any
bigger comeback or any bigger
swing."
It was a 42-point swing, as a mat

ter of fact — a swing that saw the Car
dinal's shooing percentage rise from
29.4 percent in the first half to 63 per
cent in the second half. And a swing
that saw the Cardinal outscore the
Ducks 70-26 in the last 24 minutes of
the game.
"(The Ducks] were having their
way and then something clicked and
our team really started competing at
the end of the first half," Van-
Derveer said. "I can't explain exactly
what happened but it was fun to
watch at the end."
VanDerveer's decision to start
pressing, along with the play of
sophomore guard Lauren St. Clair,
are at least part of what happened.
Buoyed by turnovers forced by the
full-court press and St. Clair's 10-
point offensive run with two minutes
remaining in the first half, the Cardi
nal headed for the locker room with
a standing ovation from the 3.345
fans in attendance, while still 12
points behind.
"The fans were amazing. They re
ally got into it," said senior guard
Milena Tlores. "And [junior for
ward] Sarah [Dimson] came in and
she was creating havoc on the press."
The momentum stayed with the
Cardinal throughout the second half.
Using a 2-2-1 zone press, the Cardi
nal forced 14 turnovers and grabbed
seven steals in the second half alone.
The press successfully took the
Ducks out of their offense as well —
they shot only 35 percent from the
field and 20 percent from three-point
range.
Offensively, the Cardinal was
heating up the court as well. The
team scored 18 points off of
turnovers in the second half and tal
lied 21 second-chance points, while
allowing the Ducks only nine.
With a career-high of 25 points,
St. Clair went 6 of 9 from beyond the
three-point line and was the high
scorer of the game. She also grabbed
nine rebounds and four steals and
dished out four assists.

Dimson also played a key role in
the Cardinal win. Maintaining the
Cardinal's momentum with intense
defense and hustle, Dimson gave the
team a much needed spark. She
scored six points, came down with
seven rebounds and pocketed three
steals.

played all 40 minutes of the game
without appearing to tire. Flores fin
ished the match with nine points and

eight assists.
"To come back from being that
down is just amazing and a great feel
ing," said St. Clair. "It was a total
team effort. And 1 think that just
proves to ourselves and everyone
else that we are a good team."

"I'm really proud of this come
back," VanDcrveer said. "1 think it
really says a lot about our team and
the pride they take in how they play.
It would have been very easy to just
go through the motions because it did
look like a pretty long and steep hill."
The Cardinal gave its fans an
amazing show on Saturday.
Rebounding from a 26-point
deficit with around four minutes to
go in the first half, the Stanford
women's basketball team ham

mered the No. 24 Oregon Ducks
with a 78-62 victory.
"1 just thought that was unbeliev
able for us," said head coach Tara
VanDervecr. "I've been coaching a
long time and I've never seen any
bigger comeback or any bigger
swing."
It was a 42-point swing, as a mat

ter of fact — a swing that saw the Car
dinal's shooing percentage rise from
29.4 percent in the first half to 63 per
cent in the second half. And a swing
that saw the Cardinal outscore the
Ducks 70-26 in the last 24 minutes of
the game.
"(The Ducks] were having their
way and then something clicked and
our team really started competing at
the end of the first half," Van-
Derveer said. "I can't explain exactly
what happened but it was fun to
watch at the end."
VanDerveer's decision to start
pressing, along with the play of
sophomore guard Lauren St. Clair,
are at least part of what happened.
Buoyed by turnovers forced by the
full-court press and St. Clair's 10-
point offensive run with two minutes
remaining in the first half, the Cardi
nal headed for the locker room with
a standing ovation from the 3.345
fans in attendance, while still 12
points behind.
"The fans were amazing. They re
ally got into it," said senior guard
Milena Tlores. "And [junior for
ward] Sarah [Dimson] came in and
she was creating havoc on the press."
The momentum stayed with the
Cardinal throughout the second half.
Using a 2-2-1 zone press, the Cardi
nal forced 14 turnovers and grabbed
seven steals in the second half alone.
The press successfully took the
Ducks out of their offense as well —
they shot only 35 percent from the
field and 20 percent from three-point
range.
Offensively, the Cardinal was
heating up the court as well. The
team scored 18 points off of
turnovers in the second half and tal
lied 21 second-chance points, while
allowing the Ducks only nine.
With a career-high of 25 points,
St. Clair went 6 of 9 from beyond the
three-point line and was the high
scorer of the game. She also grabbed
nine rebounds and four steals and
dished out four assists.

Dimson also played a key role in
the Cardinal win. Maintaining the
Cardinal's momentum with intense
defense and hustle, Dimson gave the
team a much needed spark. She
scored six points, came down with
seven rebounds and pocketed three
steals.
