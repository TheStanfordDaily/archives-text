head coach Ruben Nieves said of
Toppel.
"It was a new experience, it was
our first real game in front of a home
crowd." Toppel said of his collegiate
conference debut. "It was a team ef

Indeed, all 11 members of the

The No. 14 Stanford men's volleyball team started Its season with commanding wins over UC-San Diego
and San Diego State this weekend. Junior setter Josh Lukens recorded seven digs against UCSD.
"I think this group really feels
they're a team. It helps when every
one gets to play and support each
other."
"We have been working so well
as a team, it's been the largest factor
so far, and it's going to be for the rest
of the season," junior middle block
er Brett Youngberg said of the
team's performance this weekend.
"I've never been part of a team this
tight."
The Cardinal took off early in
game one. allowing UCSD onlv
three points. In game two, UCSD
battled Stanford to 7-7 before the
Cardinal was able to pull away and
clinch the victory.
Sunday's match saw much of the
same Cardinal dominance, with
Stanford giving San Diego State lit
tle room to take charge.
"As we expected, San Diego
State was a step up in competition
from UCSD," Nieves said. "They're
more physical, athletic and experi
enced, but we responded really
well."
Again, the Cardinal displayed a
team effort, with four players notch
ing kills in double digits in the three
game match. Toppel led with
while redshirt freshman outside hit
ter Seth King boasted 13 kills.
Youngberg and sophomore outside
hitter Marcus Skacel had 11 and 10
kills, respectively.
The Aztecs stayed with the Car
dinal until late in game one, when
Stanford took control and dominat
ed through game two. In game three,
San Diego State made a late rally,
holding off the Cardinal through 13

match points. But eventually Stan
ford. led by Toppcl's 14 kills in game
three alone, sealed the victory.
"Beyond winning matches, we

performed well and dominated both
matches," Nieves said, "it was a con
fidence-builder and evidence that
we're getting better."
