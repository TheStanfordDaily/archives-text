## 
### Scott Dorfman Contributing writer 
Students looking to pursue an
interest in community service this
summer have more options than
ever before, thanks to a new fellow -
ship offered by the Haas Center for
Public Service. The Urban Summer
Fellowship program will begin its
first year in the summer of 2000,
joining two fellowships already of
fered through the Haas Center: the
Amy Biehl Summer Fellowship
and the Public Service Summer Fel
lowship.

The Urban Summer Fellowship
program will offer up to six grants,
each worth $2,500, to students in
terested in studying issues affecting
life in urban environments, particu
larly the Bay Area. The fellowship
is the brainchild of Nadine Cruz, in
terim director of the Haas Center,
and Len Ortolano, professor of
Civil and Environmental Engineer
ing. The program is funded by a
grant from the United Parcel Ser
vice.
"The program offers five pre
designed fellowships, all in the Bay
Area," said senior Azania An
drews, the Urban Internship and
Fellowship Program Assistant at
the Haas Center. "Students will
participate in programs like the
Neighborhood Improvement Ini
tiative, which sponsors community
based improvements in East Palo
Alto."
Students receiving an Urban
Summer Fellowship are asked to
participate in workshops during the
fall, giving reflections on the fellow
ship experience. The program is
open to both undergraduate and
graduate students, provided the
student will be here next fall. Ap

plications can be picked up at the
Flaas Center or on the Web at
http://haas.stanford.edu, and are
due Feb. 22.

The Amy Biehl Summer Fel
lowship "provides opportunities
for Stanford students to work as
volunteers on educational, social or
cultural projects in South Africa,"
according to a Haas Center press
release.
Biehl fellows work for a mini
mum of eight weeks in Cape Town,
with travel and living expenses paid
by the Haas Center. Projects en
couraged by the fellowship include
working with victims of domestic
violence, helping to create new
community industries and small
businesses for rural South Africans
and planning activities for commu
nity youth centers.
The fellowship is chiefly spon
sored by Linda and Peter Biehl,
whose daughter Amy was killed in
South Africa while studying on a
Fulbright Scholarship in 1992.
' The Biehl fellowship was the
most unique experience 1 had in my
time at Stanford," said senior Katie
Deal, a 1998 recipient of a Biehl fel
lowship. Deal worked with black
female domestic workers in Cape
Town, educating them on what to
expect from employers. "The Biehl
family did an incredible job of cut
ting through the red tape that exists
in South Africa and making person
al contacts with the people living
there. I learned through my experi
ence that community service is real
ly ail about listening to people."
The Amy Biehl Summer Fel
lowship is open to undergraduate
students only. Applications for the
fellowship can be obtained at the
Haas Center and are due Feb. 17.

Finally, the Public Service Sum
mer Fellowship program is offered
as a means "to encourage students
to explore public service as a career
alternative," according to a Haas
Center press release.
Fellowship recipients receive
grants up to $3.(XK) to design service
projects that address critical needs
within a community. Limited finan
cial aid is also available to eligible
students. Students are given the
flexibility to design programs that
best suit their own interests, with
the fellowship's benefactors,
William and Reva Tooley, the H.
Michael Stevens family, and an
anonymous donor, providing the fi
nancial backing.
"The fellowship, more than any
thing else at Stanford, allowed me
to pursue my passion, which is
working with youth." said sopho
more Olatunde Sobomehin.
Sobomehin worked with Opera
tion E.A.S.Y., a nonprofit organi
zation run by his father that works
with African-American youth in
the Portland, Ore., area. "I was able
to train high school students in
leadership skills, so that these stu
dents can work for my father's
group in the future."
The Public Service Summer Fel
lowship is open to both undergrad
uate and graduate students, with
preference given to undergrads.
Applications for the fellowship are
available at the Haas Center and
are due Feb. 22.
Questions regarding any of the
three fellowships can be directed
towards Mark Delucchi, Fellow
ship Programs Coordinator at the
Haas Center, at 5-7408 or deluc
