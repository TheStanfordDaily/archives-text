Although the Stanford men's
gymnastics team was shaky in its
season opener, there were several
bright spots for the Cardinal during
Friday evening's competition at
Berkeley.

MEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ Friday: No. 8 California 221.400,
No. 9 Stanford 214.400, No. 18 UC-
Santa Barbara 203.290.

The No. 9 Cardinal (1 -1) placed
second with a 214.400, behind No. 8
California's (2-1) 221.400, but
ahead of No. 18 UC-Santa Bar
bara's (1-2) 203.290.
Kedshirt freshman Cade Raggio
provided one of the meet's high
lights when he scored an impres
sive 9.5 on the parallel bars.
Competing in his first collegiate
meet, Raggio was nervous but con
fident before his routine.
i was pretty nervous, but I def
initely felt prepared. Next time I'll
have more confidence now that I
have the first one out of the way,"
Raggio said.
Sophomore David Durante
turned in Stanford's highest score
of the competition on the pommel

horse.
Durante's clean lines and per
fect execution earned him a 9.65
and first-place honors.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
there were not enough of these out
standing routines.
"We only hit eight out of 35 rou
tines," said head coach Sadao
Hamada.
After the meet, Hamada out
lined a detailed strategy for the re
mainder of the season.
"In order to win (the NCAA
Championships) this year, we have
to throw very hard routines. We
could perform easier ones, but
there is no way we could come
close to winning with them,"
Hamada said.
The Cardinal typically begins
each season slowly but rapidly im
proves its scores as the postseason
approaches.
Year after year, most teams are
often surprised by the Cardinal's
dramatic improvement, but Hama
da claims that it is all part of his
plan.
With few injuries and a deep
team, Stanford should be able to
surprise the competition once
again and be a threat at the NCAA
Championships in April.

With the NCAA Champi
onships scheduled three weeks ear
lier this year, the squad will have
less time to improve its perfor
mance. Hamada has encouraged
his gymnasts to be more efficient in
practice.
"We really need to work harder
and step up the intensity in our
workouts. Although we have a very
long way to go, I still feel very good
about this season," Hamada said.
This weekend's second-place
finish helped the team recognize
how much hard work lies ahead of
it.
"We had two goals this week
end: to find out where we stand
right now, and to get the first meet
out of the way," co-captain Rico
Andrade said.
"Now that the jitters are gone,
we can be more aggressive and go
out there to win," said junior Jason
Biltz.
The upperclassmen have been
in this position before and they
fully expect this team to follow the
same rate of rapid improvement as
seen in previous years.
"The team will improve by leaps
and bounds over the next month,"
senior co-captain craig Nesbitt
said.
