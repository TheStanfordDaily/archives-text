# Admissions dean to step down in June
## Kinnally ending 3 years as admissions head; will enter seminary, become Catholic priest 
### T.J. Babbitt Editorial staff 
Robert kinnallv, the dean of un
dergraduate admissions and finan
cial aid. is leaving Stanford to attend
seminary school in order to become a
Catholic priest. Kinnallv. who has
been at Stanford since the fall of
1997, is planning to step down at the
end of the academic year.
"It's difficult to leave such a won
derful place, but sometimes you get
called to do something else," Kinnal
lv said. "It's a process that's not easy
to plan — it's literally a 'call.'"
Kinnallv has presided over a peri
od in which Stanford's reputation
and desirability among high school
applicants has done nothing but rise,
and he cites more generous financial
aid and a streamlined early decision
process as two examples of his ac
complishments.
But his office has also produced
two large freshman classes in the past
two years, underestimating the ac
ceptance yield rate both times; last
fall's entering class was the biggest
since at least 1950.
Kinnallv looks towards the future
Several colleagues in the Office of
Undergraduate Admission had high
praise for their boss, his effectiveness
and his integrity.
"While his time has been short,
he's been able to do the things he
wanted to do," said Anna Marie Por

ras. a senior associate director of un
dergraduate admissions. "He's been
a good person for admissions and fi
nancial aid."
While the jump from University
administrator to seminary student
might seem like a large one for Kin
nally. several associates said they had
discussed his strong religious convic
tions with him and were not very sur
prised by his decision. Kinnally has
also been active in the Catholic com
munity at Stanford and sang in the
Catholic Choir in Memorial Church.
Kinnally will attend the St. John
Fisher seminary in Stamford, Conn.,
and will study to become a priest in
the Diocese of Bridgeport, Conn. He
was once the director of music in that
diocese.
kinnallv's tenure
Kinnally pioneered the consolida
tion of Stanford's early decision pro
gram, which, as originally imple
mented, had two separate applica
tion deadlines.
"We weren't getting the very
strong students in the second round,"
Kinnally said. He also said the origi
nal program had confused applicants
and high-school guidance counselors
with its complexity.
Kinnally is sanguine about the
extra freshmen that have enrolled at
Stanford in the past couple of years.
"I would call it a happy problem. It's

not a problem at all." Kinnally said.
Hut he did say he would make sure
that the situation did not repeat itself
a third time.
"Our plan this year is to admit a
smallei number of freshmen and
more than 1(H) transfer students," he
said, which would return to the nor-
Imal pattern.
Another significant event during
JKinnally's tenure was the elimina
tion of the position of former associ
ate dean and director of undergradu
ate admissions John Bunnell, who
had worked lor the office lor 35
years, in a stall' reorganization. Most
people with knowledge of the matter
declined to discuss it.
" That was a very difficult decision
we had to make." Kinnally said, be
fore declining to discuss the matter
further.
Kinnally came to Stanford from
Sarah I awrence ( ollege. a small lib
.eral aits college in Bronxville, N.Y..
"with a student population of about

1.000 undergraduates and 200 gradu
ate students. He was the director of
financial aid there.
Kinnally earned a bachelor's in
English from Manhattan College in
19H2 and a master's in English and
American literature from New
York University in 19K7.
I le also worked in the admissions
offices of the University of Bridge
port in Connecticut, the State Uni
versity of New York-Purchase and
Pace University.
After talking with Vice Provost
for Student Affairs James Montoya,
Kinnally announced his decision to
leave Stanford to his staff on Friday
afternoon, which surprised some
staff members. Hut others knew
about his seminary application
process, which had been going on for
almost a year.
He also announced his decision
during a Catholic service in Memori
al Church on Sunday, and a formal
announcement will be made today.
Montoya will meet with admis
sions and financial aid staff today to
discuss the search process for a new
dean.
