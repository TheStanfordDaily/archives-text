Butterfield designed courses in the

project or with a problem."
Additionally, Butterfield had
more than 60 research articles, edi

and served as a fellow of the Ameri
can College of Sports Medicine.
Butterfield was nationally recog

time will lose weight unless they are
force-fed.

ticle, Dr. Barrv Braun, assistant di

rector of the VA's Aging Study unit,
said Butterfield particularly enjoyed
working with students.
"Every one of [her students)
knew what her daughter looked like
â€” she always showed them pictures.
There was no barrier between what
was personal and what was profes
sional. Her students, especially her
women students, really responded
to that."

daughter, Carrie, of El Cerrito; par
ents, Jeanette and Frank Butterfield
of Cupertino; brother, Frank 111. of
Davis; and sister. Susan, of Norman.
