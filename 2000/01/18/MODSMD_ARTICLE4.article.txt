## 
### Deena Skolnick 
With the year 2000 California primaries
scheduled for March 7. both the Stanford
Democrats and the Stanford Republicans
are gearing up for a long and exciting pres
idential campaign.
A voter registration effort was
launched at a meeting of the Stanford De
mocrats last Tuesday. Members of the De
mocrats will be going door-to-door in an
attempt to register 2.000 voters. Tentative

plans were made to start the campaign two
weeks before the Feh. 7 registration dead
line.
Junior Bryan Hughes, director of Com
munications for the Stanford Democrats,
is optimistic about this campaign.
"It's (going to] take right up to the end
of the two weeks to reach the goal of 2()(X)
because ... it's a time-consuming process.
But I think it's a realistic goal, given there
are 6.000 people living in dorms on cam
pus."

Hughes added that the majority of
Stanford students tend to he Democrats or
vote for the issues supported by the De
mocrats. The club therefore emphasizes
registration rather than education, and
plans to hand out fliers instead of inviting
speakers. Hughes estimates that 70 per
cent of students are aware of this primary
and its repercussions, possibly because 40
percent of Stanford's students are native
('alifoi nians.
I lie Slim lord Republicans, head
ed by junioi I ai Li C hang, are plan
ning events of their own to raise
awareness about the primary. Se
nior Rvan Parks, current member
and former president of the Repub
licans. reports that the group plans to
invite candidates and speakers to
campus in the weeks between now
and March 7. I Ic agrees with I lugh
es' observation that Stanford stu
dents Irom ( alilornia are very aware
of the primaries, so the education ef
fort will target non-Californians.
( inrently. the Republicans have not
organized a registration drive.
In addition to these two groups, a
non-partisan political information
i>roup called Stanford Votes 2000

will be trying to raise voter aware
ness before the primaries. This
group was formed by Stanford In
(iovcrnment in ()ctober. The goal of
this informal group is to "get people
excited about the primaries," ac
cording to senior Nikki Love.
Love, co-director of campus
awareness for SIG, said the group
will set up a Primary Elections Fair
in White Plaza during the first week
of February. At the fair, members of
the group will hand out information
al fliers, distribute registration
forms, and invite candidates or cam
paign volunteers to speak to stu
dents. The group will also hand out
registration forms at basketball
games in an attempt to reach as
many students as possible.
Registration forms are available
at the post office, at the SICi office,
and by following the links from
