In honor of the Martin Luther King Millennium Celebra
tion, last Friday, the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project
unveiled the historical exhibit "The Unfinished Dream." A
portrait commissioned to anchor the exhibit will hang in Cy
press Hall D.
Between 100 and 150 people gathered in Redwood Au
ditorium at Cypress Hall to participate in the King celebra
tion. The program also highlighted the forthcoming publica
tion of the fourth volume of the MLK Papers Project and de
buted the project's redesigned Web site. I he MLK Papers
Project is a Stanford University research initiative that
chronicles and publishes the works of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr.
The painting. "Unfinished Dream." which is the anchor
ing piece of the exhibit, was created in sumi-e. a 2,000-year
old Japanese ebony-inked brushstroke art form. History
Prof. Clayborne Carson commissioned senior Drue Katao
ka to create a portrait of King using this technique.
In addition to the unveiling, the program featured free
dom songs sung by civil rights activists Dorothy Cotton and
Jimmv Collier. A reception followed at the offices of the
MLK Papers Project.
"The exhibit is a part of our mission to disseminate infor
mation about Martin Luther King. Jr. using all the resources
available to us." said ('arson.
Kataoka was given permission by Atlanta-based Intellec
tual Property Management, the company that helps manage
King's estate, to recreate Dr. King's likeness.
"This is exhilarating to experience." said Kataoka. "Mar
tin Luther King Jr. is being chronicled in an art form that's
2.000 years old. In the dawn of this new day.the voice of the
brush is carrying on his legacy."
After the program, the artist was on hand to sell and sign
commemorative posters.
