## Protesters attack Confederate flag 
### 
COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — With signs reading
"Your heritage is my slavery," thousands of people
marched today to protest the Confederate flag that
flies above the Statehouse and demand a perma
nent state holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr.
King's son, Martin Luther King 111. opened the
day with a prayer breakfast at the University of
South Carolina.
"This is the kind of thing we need to be doing on
Martin Luther King's birthday," King said. "The
flag is a terrible symbol that brings a lot of negative
energy. And while we believe the flag has an appro
priate place, it just does not belong on top of the
Capitol because it is not a sign of unification."
Demonstrators gathered at a downtown church
for a service before marching to the Statehouse six
blocks away, singing "the flag is coming down" and
waving American flags.
The marchers were led with a banner declaring
"A March and Rally for the Removal of the Con
federate Flag."
"We will be very strong and firm and clear that
the flag must come down and justice must go up,"
Bishop John Hurst Adams, bishop of the African
Methodist Episcopal Churches, told marchers.
Police Chief Charles Austin estimated that at
least 1 (),()()() people were involved.
The marchers included a smattering of whites,
including 16-year-old Heather Showman. She said
the flag did not offend her but she understood why
others were offended by it.
"We need to get this flag off the Statehouse and
promote racial unity," she said.
People seeking the flag's removal say it is a bit
ter reminder of slavery and racism. Flag supporters
say it represents the heritage of those who fought
and died for a cause they believed in.
More than 6.000 marched a week ago in the
South Carolina Heritage 2000 rally to show support
for keeping the flag atop the Statehouse.

In addition to the flag issue, civil-rights groups
want the state to make Martin Luther King Day a
permanent holiday for state workers, who now can
take off that day or one of several tied to Confeder
ate anniversaries.
South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges decided to
speak at a King Day observation rather than attend
today's rally, said spokeswoman Nina Brook.
"The governor wants to be a mediator, a person
who helps folks come together on the flag." Brook
told The State newspaper of Columbia. " Therefore,
it's not appropriate for him to participate in events
that are being portrayed as either anti-flag or pro
flag."
T he National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People started a tourism boycott of the
state Jan. I. pushing the issue of the flag.
The boycott has been effective, said Nelson B.
Rivers 111. the NAACP's national field director.
Many people who came to the city today for the
rally elected to stay at churches rather than at
hotels.
He also said the boycott has promoted discus
sion. " The General Assembly has now had more
talk about trying to take it down in the last three
weeks than they have in the last three years,"
Rivers 111 said on NBC's " Today" show.
But state I louse Speaker Pro Tem Terry I laskins
said the boycott has had little effect.
"This boycott was nothing but a phony publicity
stunt from the start," 1 laskins said on "Today."
The Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow / PUSH
Coalition also is urging tourists to boycott Georgia
until that state's Legislature removes the Confeder
ate emblem from its state flag. The emblem was
incorporated in 1956 — two years after the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled racial segregation illegal in
public schools.
Civil rights activists plan to call for the Georgia
boycott Jan. 30 in Atlanta, said Joe Beasley, South
ern regional director for Rainbow / PUSH.
