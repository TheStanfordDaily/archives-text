AWAKE!
Mn 1929 J. D. Bernal expanded on
| the idea of space colonies. If only
.the world's R&D "experts" had
• comprehended the potential
'magnitude of the idea. By now
'we'd have colonies throughout
.the solar system & on their way to
<all stars within - 50 light years.
•With our foot dragging lack of
'enthusiasm we have shown
'humans to be no different than
.ants or termites on our little
'colony Earth. Let's give up
'following the bunglers & finally
"get started in the right direction.
That is implementation on the
• Gerard K. O'Neill Model with a
"new grass roots type
] organization. As Ray Bradbury
, phrased it in his 1977 introductory
| paragraph for Heppenheimer's
•"Colonies In Space": Let's move,
Let's go there, Let's do the job.
