# Fewer drugs on TV
## Media contains more drug references 
### Lauren Phillips Staff writer 
A recent study found that por
trayals of illicit drug, alcohol and to
bacco use occurred less often in
television than in other media such
as film and music.
I hc study, conducted by Com
munication Prof. Donald Roberts
and academies at other institutions,
found that illicit drugs were por
trayed in only 3 percent of prime
time series episodes. About 20 per
cent of episodes contained tobacco
use. though none of those showed
teenage characters smoking.
" The variation between the por
trayal of drugs in television and
other industries is explained by the
fact that television is a medium that
reaches a large family population."
Roberts said. "Therefore, writers
don't even propose the same topics
that they do in film and music."
Roberts and Prof. Peter Chris
tianson at Lewis and ( lark Univer
sity in Portland, Ore., completed
the study as the second part of a se
ries that looked at substance use in
popular media. I he research was
commissioned by the White House
Office of National Drug Control
Policy and an independent non
profit group. Media-Scope, that ad
vocates positive health images in
national media.
The first study compiled statis
tics about the prevalence of drugs in
film and music.
Roberts said that while all three
media refer to illicit drugs, tobacco
and alcohol 20 percent of the time,
television characters used drugs less
on-screen.
Researchers evaluated the top
-20 television programs for adults
and teens. They also analyzed the
top 20 TV shows for teenagers of
Caucasian, black and Hispanic ori

gin. though the variation across
groups was insignificant.
According to Roberts, the most
common mentions of illicit drug use
came in two types: either drugs were
mentioned lightheartedly on sit
coms such as "That 70's Show." or
the references appeared in dramat
ic series such as "NYPD Blue" or
"ER." where drugs were cast in a
negative light.
"I don't think that the frequency
is nearly as important as the con
text." Roberts said. "The problem
with many portrayals is that use of
drugs is shown as fun and cool
and has little consequence."
The study was the first of its kind
to look at such a wide variety of
popular culture sources for refer
ences to illegal drugs, alcohol and
tobacco. Two hundred films, 1.000
songs and 420 individual television
episodes were studied from 1997
and IWX. Stanford graduate and
undergraduate students were in
volved in compiling and coding the
data.
While the study will be used by
both Media-Scope and the drug pol
icy office to promote positive pro
gramming among directors and
writers. Roberts did not anticipate
that results of the study would be
used to increase censorship or fur
ther debates on the implementation
of the V-Chip technology, which al
lows parents to screen out topics
that they do not wa-nt their children
to see on television.
"I would not expect substances
to be a major component of the cen
sorship done with the V-Chip."
Roberts said. "There has not been
much talk about whether there
should be a categorization of drug
use on television."
Roberts also did not associate
the findings with the new use of rat
inns on television shows.
