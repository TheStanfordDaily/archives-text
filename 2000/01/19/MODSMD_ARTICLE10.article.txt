( hoice of new Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions
vital to Stanford's direction

Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions Robert Kinnal
ly's recent announcement
that he will he stepping down at the
end of the year to enter seminary
school and eventually go into the
priesthood comes at an interesting
time for Stanford.
While everyone certainly wishes
Kinnally all the best in the path he has
chosen, his presence will be missed at
this I Jniversity. Hie inevitable question
arises: who will be his successor?
In a normal year, the resignation of
the dean of admissions and the search
for a successor would probably take
center stage on the University's agen
da. Thai's what happened when James
Montoya announced that he would be
leaving his post and moving to the
position of vice provost three years
ago.
I lowever, with the search for a new
president and the resignation of anoth
er high-profile administrator — the
Dean of the School of Education —
not to mention the turmoil created by
the failed merger of UCSF-Stanlord,
such an issue may fade from the lime
light. Nevertheless, given its impor
tance and eentrality to the future of the
I Iniversity, the search for a new Dean
of Adnussions is not a task that should
be undertaken lightly.
I he past three years have seen a rise
in the national and international
prominence of Stanford. For a variety
of reasons, Stanford has emerged as an
increasingly desirable college choice
for thousands of high school students.
As a consequence, not only has there
been an overall rise in applications but

also a concurrent drop in acceptance
rates and a greater yield — and this
may he only the beginning.
With the University at somewhat of
an organizational turning point,
whomever is chosen as Kinnally's suc
cessor will have to guide the selection
of undergraduates — often regarded
as the heart and soul of a university —
in this new era. In this regard, the new
Dean of Admissions will he ahle to put
his stamp on the future entering class
es of Stanford.
Keeping this in mind, Kinallys suc
cessor — whether he or she is promot
ed from within the university adminis
tration or hired from outside — should
consistently work to improve the
undergraduate admissions process so
as to ensure that Stanford finds the
most creative as well as the most
accomplished students.
And despite the school's reputation
in the sciences, engineering and busi
ness, the new dean should demonstrate
a committment to attracting high-cal
iber students in all disciplines.
Furthermore, an increase in Stan
ford's publicity and attractiveness
should not overshadow the more
important concerns at an educational
institution. The new dean will have to
carefully instill methods for admitting
students who will foster a rich academ
ic environment, which in turn should
attract even stronger faculty.
Lastly, the new Dean of Admissions
should strive to increase financial aid
and further improve the process so as
to afford a greater range of students
the opportunity to attend an institution
like Stanford.
I lie next Dean of Admissions will
have some big shoes to fill. We trust
that the University will pick someone
who will properly tend to Stanford's
greatest strength: its students.
