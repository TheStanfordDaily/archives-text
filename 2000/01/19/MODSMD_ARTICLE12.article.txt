# Fighting the good fight

For some reason, we
talk very little about
architecture and
campus planning here at
Stanford.
Perhaps we have the
most monumental (and
stunning) architectural

spaces of any American college, including
the Main Quadrangle (or Main Quad as
most of us refer to it), and we are content
with that.
Perhaps here on the West Coast no
building or plan is permanent, so we invest
less time in talking about or criticizing
architecture. Who knows when a building
will be replaced with a new one?
Perhaps we just don't care enough to
look at the built world around us and put
into words how it makes us feel.
No matter what the reason, it's time the
planning office got a little feedback on
some of its newer contributions to the Stan
ford campus.
What better place to start than the new
Science and Engineering Quad (SEQ).
University President Casper and campus
architect David Neunian decided that there
needed to be a return to Frederick Law
Olmsted's plan of radiating quadrangles off
the Main Quadrangle. Unfortunately, this
concept had a few flaws from the start.
With the Bing Wing of Green Library
(couldn't someone have chosen a less
ridiculous name than Bing Wing?) as the
focal point of the east end of the east-west
axis, the west end of the axis demands a
similarly strong focal point. This used to be
the old physics "tank," which was not the
most attractive of buildings, but it's better

than a row of palm trees and shrubs hiding
an even more hideous research facility.
More disappointing was the execution
of this radiating quadrangle idea for the
SEQ. While I appreciate that the new
quadrangle was not just a copy of the old
sandstone and red-tile roofs, the SEQ —
with its gray I-beam "arcade," copper
accents and loosely clustered buildings —
wavers between asserting itself as a new
modern space and trying to reference the
old "Main Quad. The result is a watered
down compromise.
Furthermore, the SEQ "arcade" and
interior space do not come close to match
ing the success of the original. The interior
landscaping of the SEQ does not lend to
informal interaction of students or even
just sitting to read or watch people as the
Main Quad does, but seems to invite only
circulation with its dirt paths. While the
arcade of the Main Quad offers both shel
ter and the primary circulation routes, the
SEQ arcade offers no shelter and does not
function well (nor is it used) for circulation.
As an engineer, I am most disappointed
with the footbridge connecting the south
end of the SEQ with the Green Earth Sci
ences building. The bridge has all the
charm of a Buick Century and as part of an
engineering quad should have been both
more visually appealing and structurally
interesting.
I also wonder how much the yellow
palm trees lining the entrance to the SEQ
cost.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not some strict
contextualist who dislikes all of the new
architecture on campus. I do appreciate
Casper and Neuman's desire to hire

famous architects and hold architectural
competitions — especially in the case of the
Cantor Visual Arts Center competition
that yielded an impressive architectural
addition to our campus.
However, in many cases these examples
of strong architecture from well-known
architects have been compromised due to
University constraints.
The bold colors used on the exteriors of
Ricardo Legoretta's works were subdued
and forced into the interior of his Schwab
Residential Learning Center. I'm sure every
one has seen (or least heard of) the brightly
colored lobby and purple hallways (I would
love to hear what the people who live in
Schwab think about the color scheme). It
would have been a colorful and much need
ed addition to the Stanford campus had a
more traditional Legoretta color scheme
been applied to the exterior of the building
instead of more sandstone-like hues.
Designed by Robert A.M. Stern, the
exterior of the Gates Computer Sciences
Building — known for its lighthouse-like
qualities — was originally to be built com
pletely of Richardsonian sandstone.
Instead, it is forever marred with beige stuc
co due to construction that ran over budget.
While there's not enough room in my
column to talk about all of the newer (and
even some of the older) buildings on cam
pus, I hope this helps start the conversation
about architecture at Stanford that has
been lacking for some time.
