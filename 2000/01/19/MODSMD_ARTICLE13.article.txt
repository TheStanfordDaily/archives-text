Stanford promoting all the
wrong values
As Stanford's Web site has been adver
tising the recent issue of "Stanford" maga
zine. I would like to draw everyone's atten
tion to the following caption: "The latest
'Stanford' magazine profiles a small group
ol undergrads who are learning the secrets
of the start-up world â€” even before they
leave the campus."
Pay attention to the ending. What does it
really say? I hat Stanford is eager to throw
us into the "real" world even before the
completion of our studies? Is it fine with
Stanford if its students drop out for a seri
ous academic reason like making big bucks?
To me the last sentence solidifies the
impression that in the '90s, Stanford has
systematically cultivated an image appeal
ing to brains with one functional hemi
sphere, the one most close in psychological
complexity to a cash register.
Well, this may be my prejudice. But
what might be of interest to everyone are
the prejudices of the "official Stanford" via

its Web site for example.
In one sentence, does this "even before
they leave the campus" convey a message,
possibly reflect the administration's views
or even bear its approval?
I have nothing against Stanford's all
but-in-money millionaires. In fact, I would
urge them to make the wise investment
decision of remembering me in their wills.
What I find deeply disappointing though is
that there are undergrads coming to Stan
ford with already fixed minds, thus missing
perhaps the last chance of their life to
enlarge their horizons. We are meant to be
human beings above all, not life-prisoners
of narrow professionalism.

Stanford Daily ignores non
varsity sports
Readers who peruse this volume's Daily
may note the complete homogeneity of the
sports page, overwhelmingly limited to the

results and personalities of varsity sports.
Early last quarter I voiced my concern to
the managing editor for sports that his sec
tion had been neglecting non-varsity stories
at the expense of very active and successful
athletic programs. After this discussion our
team continued to submit leads and results
to the sports section.
Sadly, instead of an earnest considera
tion to undertake more variety in the sports
page, we saw a complete dismissal of our
valid concerns and a variety of unprofes
sional actions from the managing editor. By
the end of our season, we had finished sec
ond in our conference and eighth in the
nation. Yet the Stanford community heard
absolutely nothing from The Daily about
our team's efforts or results.
The main issue behind this letter goes
much farther than a team trying to get a
story in the paper. I am concerned that in
its small-minded approach to stories this
fall. The Daily sports department under
mined the vibrant athletic spirit that sets
Stanford apart from other great research
universities.

Perhaps the sports department thinks
that cycling, ultimate Frisbee or ice hockey
are inherently less interesting simply
because they don't carry "varsity" status
here. Such a misguided attitude towards
club sports is destructive not only to indi
vidual teams attempting to be recognized
for their efforts but also to the larger fabric
of sports activity that occurs outside of
Stanford's varsity athletics.
Most students do not play a varsity
sport, yet a refreshingly large number do
play some sort of club or intramural sport.
Why is it then that only five out of the 283
stories the fall sports page ran were about
any club sport?
The Daily sports page has done an
excellent job at highlighting our great varsi
ty sports programs. But it must also fairly
cover the equally stirring, dynamic and
exciting sports stories that non-varsity
teams provide.
