### Meghan O'Connor Staff writer 
When the No. 8 Brigham Young vol
leyball team arrives at Maples for tonight's

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Tonight: No. 14 Stanford (2-0) vs. No. X
Brigham Young (3-0), 7 p.m.. Maples
Pavilion.

After graduating three and losing ju
nior middle blocker Mac Wilson, who is

out with a broken finger, BYU (3-0, 0-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
Mountain Division) starts an inexperi
enced lineup similar to the No. 14 Cardinal
(2-0, 2-0 MPSK Pacific Division) squad
laden with eight players of freshman status.
Both teams breezed through last week
end's matches. The Cougars swept a week
end series with Nt). 11 Lewis, 15-11. 15-8,
15-6 and 15-9, 15-10, 15-10. Stanford dis
played similar domination, downing UC-
San Diego and San Diego State without
losing a game.
Tonight will not be as easy.
"BYIJ is another step up." head coach
Ruben Nieves said of tonight's competi
tion. "Despite losing some key players

from the NCAA championship team, they
have put together another strong team."
Leading the Cougars is senior setter
Chris Pitzak. who has already tallied 209
assists for BYU. In kills, sophomore out
side hitter Joaquin Acosta, a transfer from
I JC-Santa Barbara, boasts 54. Sophomore
outside hitter Mike Wall sits just behind
Acosta with 47 kills.
On defense, junior middle blocker
Scott Bunker has stepped up in place of
Wilson and has already clinched the BYU
single-match record in blocks with 17 on
Saturday against Lewis.
"They're a good blocking team, which
puts pressure on our serve-receive."
Nieves said. "We have to run our offense

so they can't gang up on our outside hit
ters."
After all 11 players contributed to two
decisive victories last weekend, the Cardi
nal is counting on another team effort to
seal an upset victory over the Cougars. The
team looks to junior setter Josh Lukens to
continue to lead the team in assists. Last
weekend's performance added 1(X) assists
to Lukens' career tally, pushing him to
2,078 and placing him seventh among
Stanford's career assist leaders.
Capitalizing on Lukens' assists is fresh
man middle blocker Curt Toppel, who
leads the team with 50 kills over the past
two matches. Junior middle blocker
Brett Youngberg, who battled the flu
and a back problem all weekend, still
posted 23 kills, which is good enough
for second on the Stanford squad.
On defense, Toppel and redshirt
freshman Seth King lead with 14 digs.

while Toppel and freshman outside
hitter Kyle Strache hold eight and
seven total blocks, respectively.
Statistics aside, the Cardinal
knows it is going to have to step up its
level of play to match the step up in
competition tonight.
"We'll have to sustain a high level
of play for longer. Even if things go
our way, we will probably be on the
court longer," Nieves said. "They'll

put together stretches of play where
they play well and we'll have to fight
harder."
"We've had a good start to our
season," Youngberg said. "We just
have to take it as it comes and stick to
our game plan. So far it's been work
ing well."
A win tonight would move Stan
ford to a 4-5 record with BYU over
the past five seasons.
