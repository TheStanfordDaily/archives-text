MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
â–  Tonight: No. 14 Stanford (2-0) vs. No. X
Brigham Young (3-0), 7 p.m.. Maples
Pavilion.

After graduating three and losing ju
nior middle blocker Mac Wilson, who is

out with a broken finger, BYU (3-0, 0-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
Mountain Division) starts an inexperi
enced lineup similar to the No. 14 Cardinal
(2-0, 2-0 MPSK Pacific Division) squad
laden with eight players of freshman status.
Both teams breezed through last week
end's matches. The Cougars swept a week
end series with Nt). 11 Lewis, 15-11. 15-8,
15-6 and 15-9, 15-10, 15-10. Stanford dis
played similar domination, downing UC-
San Diego and San Diego State without
losing a game.
Tonight will not be as easy.
"BYIJ is another step up." head coach
Ruben Nieves said of tonight's competi
tion. "Despite losing some key players

from the NCAA championship team, they
have put together another strong team."
Leading the Cougars is senior setter
Chris Pitzak. who has already tallied 209
assists for BYU. In kills, sophomore out
side hitter Joaquin Acosta, a transfer from
I JC-Santa Barbara, boasts 54. Sophomore
outside hitter Mike Wall sits just behind
Acosta with 47 kills.
On defense, junior middle blocker
Scott Bunker has stepped up in place of
Wilson and has already clinched the BYU
single-match record in blocks with 17 on
Saturday against Lewis.
"They're a good blocking team, which
puts pressure on our serve-receive."
Nieves said. "We have to run our offense

so they can't gang up on our outside hit
ters."
After all 11 players contributed to two
decisive victories last weekend, the Cardi
nal is counting on another team effort to
seal an upset victory over the Cougars. The
team looks to junior setter Josh Lukens to
continue to lead the team in assists. Last
weekend's performance added 1(X) assists
to Lukens' career tally, pushing him to
2,078 and placing him seventh among
Stanford's career assist leaders.
Capitalizing on Lukens' assists is fresh
man middle blocker Curt Toppel, who
leads the team with 50 kills over the past
