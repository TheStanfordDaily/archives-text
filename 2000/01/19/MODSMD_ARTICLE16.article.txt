WOMEN'S TENNIS

■ Saturday-Sunday: Freshman
Laura Granville, senior Jennifer
Ueiser and sophomore Keiko Toku
da competed at the National Colle
giate Tennis Classic in Sherwood
Oaks, Calif. Tokuda reached the
semifinal round before falling to
USC's Jewell Peterson.
■ Tuesday: Sophomore Marissa Irvin
lost to Lindsey Davenport, the 1999
Wimbledon Champion. 6-4.7-5 in the
Australian Open.
Sophomore Keiko Tokuda, who
routinely plays No. 6 singles for the
Cardinal, stormed through the
draw to the semifinal round, post
ing a series of impressive wins over
formidable opponents.
Tokuda's performance is a tes
tament to the depth of\hdStanford
squad.
It is unusual for a team's No. 6
player to reach the latter rounds of
a prestigious national tournament.
It is even more unusual for a team's
No. 6 player to be ranked 38th na
tionally.
Tokuda boasts both honors.
The diminutive Tokuda, who
won the national junior claycourt
title when she was 16. has an all
court game but tends to wear down
her opponents with long baseline
rallies.
Tokuda's first scalp at the
NCI'C was UCLA's Abigail
Spears, whom she dismantled in

straight sets, 7-5.6-3.
In the quarterfinals, Tokuda
faced California's Anita Kurimay
— a player who has been ranked as
high as sixth nationally — in what
turned out to be the match of the
tournament.
The match began in mundane
fashion as a focused Tokuda swept
past an error-prone Kurimay to
capture the first set. 6-4.
Kurimay, who is known for her
streaky play, suddenly found her
range and leapt to a 4-1 second-set
lead.
Tokuda remained determined.
She won the next four games and
soon found herself with a 5-4 lead
and several matchpoints. Kurimay
responded, however, with an array
of daz/ling winners that left Toku
da dumbfounded.
"Tokuda lost those match
points despite playing them per
fectly." said head coach Frank
Brennan. "Kurimay's really dan
gerous under pressure because she
doesn't feel pressure."
Tokuda quickly established a 6-
5 lead only to squander two more
match points. A confident Kuri
may then took the second set in a
tiebreak and promptly mounted a
2-0 lead in the third.
"Keiko had every reason to
quit, down 0-2 in the third set."
Brennan said. "But she then turns
it on and whips off five straight
games."
Leading 5-3 in the third. Tokuda
finally had the match in her grasp.
Abruptly, however, Kurimay re
tired, giving Tokuda the victory.
"Kurimay walked up to the net
and said. 'I'm dizzy. I can't play
anymore.'" Brennan said. "Keiko
was upset, because she didn't want
to end the match that way, espe
cially after having so many match
