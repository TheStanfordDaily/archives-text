WOMEN'S TENNIS

■ Saturday-Sunday: Freshman
Laura Granville, senior Jennifer
Ueiser and sophomore Keiko Toku
da competed at the National Colle
giate Tennis Classic in Sherwood
Oaks, Calif. Tokuda reached the
semifinal round before falling to
USC's Jewell Peterson.
■ Tuesday: Sophomore Marissa Irvin
lost to Lindsey Davenport, the 1999
Wimbledon Champion. 6-4.7-5 in the
Australian Open.
Sophomore Keiko Tokuda, who
routinely plays No. 6 singles for the
Cardinal, stormed through the
draw to the semifinal round, post
ing a series of impressive wins over
formidable opponents.
Tokuda's performance is a tes
tament to the depth of\hdStanford
squad.
It is unusual for a team's No. 6
player to reach the latter rounds of
a prestigious national tournament.
It is even more unusual for a team's
No. 6 player to be ranked 38th na
tionally.
Tokuda boasts both honors.
The diminutive Tokuda, who
won the national junior claycourt
title when she was 16. has an all
court game but tends to wear down
her opponents with long baseline
rallies.
Tokuda's first scalp at the
NCI'C was UCLA's Abigail
Spears, whom she dismantled in

straight sets, 7-5.6-3.
In the quarterfinals, Tokuda
faced California's Anita Kurimay
— a player who has been ranked as
high as sixth nationally — in what
turned out to be the match of the
tournament.
The match began in mundane
fashion as a focused Tokuda swept
past an error-prone Kurimay to
capture the first set. 6-4.
Kurimay, who is known for her
streaky play, suddenly found her
range and leapt to a 4-1 second-set
lead.
Tokuda remained determined.
She won the next four games and
soon found herself with a 5-4 lead
and several matchpoints. Kurimay
responded, however, with an array
of daz/ling winners that left Toku
da dumbfounded.
"Tokuda lost those match
points despite playing them per
fectly." said head coach Frank
Brennan. "Kurimay's really dan
gerous under pressure because she
doesn't feel pressure."
Tokuda quickly established a 6-
5 lead only to squander two more
match points. A confident Kuri
may then took the second set in a
tiebreak and promptly mounted a
2-0 lead in the third.
"Keiko had every reason to
quit, down 0-2 in the third set."
Brennan said. "But she then turns
it on and whips off five straight
games."
Leading 5-3 in the third. Tokuda
finally had the match in her grasp.
Abruptly, however, Kurimay re
tired, giving Tokuda the victory.
"Kurimay walked up to the net
and said. 'I'm dizzy. I can't play
anymore.'" Brennan said. "Keiko
was upset, because she didn't want
to end the match that way, espe
cially after having so many match

Stanford's Keiko Tokuda, who normally plays No. 6 singles for the Cardinal, took the
National Collegiate Tennis Classic tournament field by storm this weekend, blowing
through two opponents before falling in the semifinals.
points. But I told her that she would
have won anyway. She's an unbe
lievable fighter. I have so much re
spect for her."
Despite having just played a
three-hour match, Tokuda found
herself on the court again an hour
later with second-seeded Jewell Pe
terson of Southern California
standing across the net.
Peterson, who Tokuda beat last
fall in their sole prior encounter,
posted a 6-4,6-4 semifinal victory.
"I think my endurance was lack
ing," Tokuda said. "I didn't get to
balls that I normally get to. But I
played well this weekend. I was
confident and there was no pres
sure on me. I'm not at my peak
game, but I'm playing well."

Both Granville and senior Jen
nifer Heiser accompanied Tokuda
to Sherwood Oaks.
Heiser fell in the second round
to eventual champion Sara Walker
of UCLA.
Many onlookers predicted that
Granville, who won the Intercolle
giate Tennis Association Regional
Championships in the fall and en
tered the NCTC ranked second na
tionally. would win the tournament
handily.
Her second-round opponent, of
course, had other ideas.
Granville's straight-set loss to
Basica isn't too shocking, however,
for the Bruin is a well-respected
collegiate competitor.
Unlike Tokuda, Granville felt
that the time off during winter
break hurt her game.
"I'm just getting hack into the
swing of things," she said. " This is

my first tournament in a while. I'm
a little rusty. And [ Basica j was real
ly consistent and took advantage of
my mistakes."
Brennan attributes the loss to a
bad day.
"It's rather puzzling," he said. "I
just don't think she was ready,
physically or mentally."
Granville, Heiser and Tokuda
weren't the only Stanford players
making waves over the weekend.
Sophomore Marissa Irvin. who
finished last year ranked second
nationally and plans to return to
collegiate competition in February,
caused a stir on the other side of the
globe after qualifying for the Aus
tralian Open and then knocking off
35th-ranked Corina Morariu in the
first round.
"It's a terrific, terrific win," said
Brennan of Irvin's 2-6, 7-5, 6-3
upset.
