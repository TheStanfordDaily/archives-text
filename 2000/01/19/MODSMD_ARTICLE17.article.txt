# Surprise, surprise in Pac-10
## Hoops notes 
### 
You knew some things about the Pacific 10 Con
ference race before the year started. But some
things still surprise you.
You knew Eddie House would dominate the
league this season — but 34.8 points a game, includ
ing a Pac-10-record 61 at California?
You knew that USC had talent — but a 3-0 Pac
-10 start, with two road wins and the Trojans' first
victory over rival UCLA since 1994?
Some things, you just couldn't know. UCLA
starling 1-2 in conference, losing at Washington and
USC, then beating North Carolina in Chapel Hill.
Oregon State, a team that knocked off the Bruins.
Arizona and Stanford last year on its home court,
opening 0 for 3 in Corvallis.

Even your home team surprises you: the Cardi
nal. which shot itself in the foot with missed free
throws Jan. S against Arizona, hitting 21 straight
from the charity stripe Saturday in Eugene, Ore. to
pull away from Oregon down the stretch.
Now. with No. 3 Stanford off until a Sunday
matchup at Cal, you have a chance to sit hack and
take a look around the sometimes surprising, al
ways entertaining Pac-10.
Since its opening-week win at Maples Pavillion.
No. 2 Arizona has remained the favorite in the con
ference chase. But the Wildcats looked vulnerable
last weekend, narrowly posting a pair of home wins
over Pac-10 doormats Washington and Washington
State.
Down to seven significant players with the loss of
Richard Jefferson — out eight weeks with a foot in
jury suffered at Stanford — Arizona figures to he
battling fatigue the rest of the year. The Wildcats
face a big test this weekend, playing at up-and
down UCLA Thursday (the Bruins' conference
home open£fjTJind at USC Saturday.
Both L.A:, .'sehools could make big statements
with sweeps this weekend. UCLA needs to prove it
can play well every game night, and USC needs to
show its hot start wasn't a fluke. Arizona State, on
the other hand, could seriously help its NCAA tour
nament hopes with a pair of road wins.
None of these teams is predictable, but the Bru
ins in particular are a tough team to figure. ESPN
reported this week that Bruins .coaches think star
sophomore forward Jerome Moiso is gearing up to
enter the NBA draft. The staff is desperately trying
to change his mind, but if the Bruins keep losing
Pac-10 games, Moiso may not be the only one not
returning to UCLA next year.
Up north, both Oregon schools could use big
showings this weekend to stay alive in the confer
ence and postseason hunts. Oregon tans are hoping
for two easy wins, tomorrow at Washington and
Saturday at Washington State. But the Ducks need
better production inside and scoring from someone
other than Alex Scales to come away with a sweep.
If ever there was a must-win game for Oregon
State — a team in disarray after home blowout loss
es to Oregon, Stanford and Cal — it's Thursday at
Washington State. Thankfully for basketball fans,
this meeting of Pac-10 cellar-dwellers won't be tele
vised.
