MEN'S RUGBY
•■Saturday:Stanford 55.5t. Mary's S.

With St. Mary's powerful brand
of rugby matched against Stanford s
dynamic style of playing, many
thought the Cardinal (3-0, 1-0 P( L)
would be in lor quite a light in its lirst
conference game of the young sea
son. Saturday afternoon at New
Maloney Field, however, the C ardi
nal's speed and athleticism proved
to be too much for the hapless Ciaels
to handle.
"The team was ready," said
Boivert. "They started very, very
fast and killed the spirit ol St.

Mary's."
Working off an early energy, the
Stanford took total control of the
game to build an imposing 22-3 lead
at halftime.
Even with this nearly insur
mountable advantage, Stanford was
able to keep the heat on St. Mary's in
the rest of the game, outscoring the
team 33-5 in the second half.
The Cardinal dominated the en
tire match. The Cardinal barely gave
St. Mary's any opportunity to score
while at the same time relentlessly
attacking.
"The fluidity of our offense was
excellent." said senior captain Mike
Ceballos. "Our ball control was
great, and we were all on the same
page."
Though this weekend's and last
weekend's performances both re
sulted in wins for the club, Satur
day's game saw quite a distinct shift
in the Cardinal's play.
After less than quality victories
over Santa Clara and Cal Poly-San
I.uis Obispo, Boivert was bothered
by both his team's sloppy play and

what he perceived as a lack of inten
sity.
While he may have had questions
last week in practice as to the capa
bilities of his squad, this weekend's
blowout of St. Mary's led to an out
pouring of optimism from Boivert.
"We at times played five to 10
minutes of near-perfect rugby." he
said.
1 le was struck by the spirited plav
of not only the veterans but of the
newcomers as well. Chief among the
recent converts to the sport is senior
Chuks Amajor. who came to rugby
by wav of football. I le has. according
to Boivert. "taken the game by
storm."
While Stanford's first team
played exceptionally well on Satur
day. the second team also received
positive accolades over the week
end. In order to give the team more
game experience and to rest the
starters, Boivert had the team take
on the Gibson Bay Sea Dogs from
Vancouver on Monday.
