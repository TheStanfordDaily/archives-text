What would you do with $S.(XX)?
In his 1998 State of the University
Address, University President Ger
hard Casper announced $5,000
grants to junior faculty members in
the Schools of Earth Sciences, Engi
neering and Humanities and Sciences
for unrestricted research.
Some faculty members have done
extra research with the money, while
others have used it to continue their
ongoing projects.
Asst. Computer Science Prof.
Carlo Tomasi explained how the
grant was useful to him.
"Sometimes you have some re

search that's small that you want to
start," he said. "You can start some
thing new without much overhead."
Tomasi was able to hire an addi
tional research assistant.
Members of his research group
had "a new idea that we wanted to
play with," he said, "so I asked a stu
dent to work with me for a few
months."
In some departments, such as the
physics department, the funds go di
rectly to the professors' unrestricted
research accounts and are not ear
marked for any special purpose.
Because of this, Asst. Physics Prof.
Jeffrey Willick said, "There's no dis
tinction. I pursued my normal re

search."
Surprisingly, several of the junior
faculty members questioned had ab
solutely no idea as to whether they
had ever received them or not.
Asst. Chemistry Prof. Hongjie
Dai said. "I haven't been paying
much attention to my grants lately."
However, many members of the
Stanford community feel that the
grants are a very positive thing.
Chemistry Prof. Barry Trost,chair
of the department, said that the
grants were a good idea, because any
thing that recognizes the difficulties
of junior faculty members in obtain
ing funds is worthwhile.
The grants help recruit new junior

faculty members and show Stanford's
commitment to nurturing junior fac
ulty members, Trost said.
For some junior faculty, the $S,(XH)
grants greatly help their research,
while for others the grants are a
rounding error.
For example, Williek receives
$75,000 annually, while Tomasi
brings in more than half a million dol
lars per year in grant money. Despite
being such a small part of his funding,
Tomasi still believes that the $S,(XK) is
a "substantial amount."
Junior faculty members receive an
additional $5,000 grant upon re-ap
pointment and $10,000 upon achiev
ing tenure.
