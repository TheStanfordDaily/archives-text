## 
### Vivek Srinivasan 
To those of you who have been
wondering what that meek build
ing between the Bookstore and
the clock tower is. now is the time
to find out.
This week is the annual Sum
mer Job Week at the Career De
velopment Center, an event de
signed to introduce students to ca
reer resources on and off campus.
Natalie Lundsteen. internship
coordinator at the CDC. said "It's
about that time of year for stu
dents to start thinking about sum
mer jobs and internships."
Summer Job Week veterans
will notice quite a few changes
since last year.
The internship database, in
cluding all CDC and Haas Center
internships, is now completely
Web-based and searchable
through http://www.jobtrak.com.
What's more. Stanford recently
joined Internship Consortium,
which includes Harvard. Yale.
Northwestern and USC. This
added more geographical diversity
to the CDC internship database,
traditionally biased toward the
West Coast, according to Lund
steen.
For those travelling home for
the summer, the CDC is offering a
new "Hometown Jobs" workshop
that covers locating home state re
sources and long-distance commu
nication with prospective employ
ers.
Also new this year is the Intern
ship Network, an online resource
for Stanford students to share
their internship experiences, and
evening dorm workshops that will
teach specific skills such as resume
writing and phone interviews.
For students unfamiliar with
the CD('. I Aindsteen's advice is to
check out the ( DCs Web site.

http://www. Stanford. edu/dept/( D
C. for events and to attend one of
the workshops on job search
strategies.
Pete Martinez, a peer counselor
who answered questions at rues
day's CDC open house, directed
students to Jobtrak and the CDC "s
library of internship books. I hese

books contain listings of compa
nies that accept interns, in contrast
to the online database that holds
more than 3.000 specific intern
ships.
Lundsteen encouraged fresh
men not to be discouraged from
applying to internships that seem
out of reach.

"In this job market, there are
always internships available." she
said.
Jane Feng, a freshman interest
ed in business and medicine, said
she found plenty of interesting in
ternships on Jobtrak. but "many

were for more qualified people."
However, she noted, "I found
the Internships & Summer Jobs'
packet really useful."
The packet contains checklists,
internship Web sites and directo
ries, and general guidelines for in
terviews and cover letters.
Copies of this and similar litera
ture are available at the CDC.
Upcoming CDC-sponsored
events include "Organize Your
Summer Job / Internship Search"
today, "Summer Job Search
Strategies in Public Service" to

morrow, "Hometown Jobs" on Fri
day, "Summer Job Search Strate
gies for Engineering & Social Sci
ence Students" on Monday, and
"How to Find Summer Empfoy
ment Opportunities Abroad."
All events are from noon to 1
p.m. in Tresidder Union, Cypress
Room, except for the employment
abroad workshop, which is in
Bechtel International Center.
Students can also make 45-
minute, one-on-one appointments
with a peer counselor at the CDC.
Peer counselors assist with ca
reer strategies and critique cover
letters and resumes. Interested stu
dents can contact the CDC for
more information.
