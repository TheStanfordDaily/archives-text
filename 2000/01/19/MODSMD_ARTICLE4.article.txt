# An artful balancing act
## All artists welcomed in new show 
### Marianna Stacey Lopez Contributing writer 
A new art exhibit open to all
artists in the Stanford community
will open on While Ha/a March 31.
"7\n Art Affair' is being devel
oped in response to what the Stu
dent ()rganiz.ing ('ommittee for the
Arts believes are inadequate op
portunities for people interested in
art, especially those who do not
want to participate at a competitive
level." said Scth Cohen, founder
and president of the committee.
"An Art Affair" is open to all art.
Cohen said. "We believe that too
many people are being turned away
through auditions, applications and

competitions, and there should be
more of a noncompetitive and infor
mal outlet on campus."
"Students often have their first
interaction with an arts department
through a formal audition," he said,
"and this makes it difficult to foster
a relationship with that department
especially if the student does not
make that first cut."
Approximately 25 students have
come together to organize the
event, with funding and advice from
the Dean of Students ()l I ice.
"I originally discussed mv idea
for a campus-wide arts event last
spring" with Dean of Students
Marc Wais. Cohen said, "lie was
very interested in the project, for he

already was thinking about organiz
ing an arts festival for Stanford as
well."
Wais v\as impressed by the "very
committed and enthusiastic stu
dents w ho handed together to initi
ate this event."
"It's a showcase," he said.
Wais' office is providing be
tween $5,000 and $7,000 to the ex
hibit. The Dean of I lumanities and
Sciences' office, the ASSIJ and the
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education's office are also con
tributing.
There are no applications, audi
tions or competitions to get in
volved. Anyone interested in ex
hibiting their art can visit the com
mittee's website at http://www.stan
ford.edu/group/SOCA and Till out
the form. Everyone who tills out the

form has a space in the exhibit, as
long as spaces are available. All stu
dents. faculty and staff are welcome
to enter, regardless of levels of ex
perience, majors or types of art.
"Someone's art does not even
have to be conventional. Our goal is
to have a concert classical pianist
and an expert juggler perform side

by-side at this event," Cohen said.
"Stanford students seem to re
tain stereotypes of art as being too
stilted, and our goal is to present art
in an unconventional way. The art
will be interactive, with mural paint
ing, available playdoh for sculpting
and dance lessons," he said.
The committee is also working

to have as many arts faculty as pos
sible exhibit their art at this event.
"I think that this is a great event
and opportunity to bring together
the various academic and art de
partments," said Nanci Howe, as
sistant dean and director student
activities. "An event like this has
long been needed at Stanford."
