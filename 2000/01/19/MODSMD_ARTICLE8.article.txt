## California to vote on same-sex marriage in March 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Christie
riardwick Vianson has been married twice
r— to men — and has no plans to wed her
female partner of the past six years.
' But she doesn't want the state, in the form
Of Proposition 22, telling them and other
same-sex couples they can never marry.
"It's the government coming into my per
sonal relationship and making a decision
about whether it's valid." says Ms. Vianson,
a 40-year-old mother of three who works for
a high-tech company. "I think it gives legiti
macy to people who want to hate."
Proposition 22 is on the California ballot
March 7. It is only 14 words long: "Only mar
riage between a man and a woman is valid or
recogni/ed in California."

As far as Rebecca Bennion is concerned,
that's a good start. The housewife and moth
er of five disavows any anti-gay prejudice
but longs for a return to an earlier era.
"It would be great if we could roll the
years back — a man and a woman commit
ted to each other, the wife staying home,
nurturing the kids, like my mom stayed
home." she says. "We've tried everything
else."
The California proposition is not unique:
Similar ballot measures passed in Alaska
and Hawaii in 1998. and signatures are being
gathered in Colorado and Nevada.
But the potential political impact is mag
nified by California's role as the nation's
most populous state and the presence of a

large, visible gay population in the San Fran
cisco Bay area and Los Angeles.
"An eighth of the country is being asked
to vote on an anti-gay initiative." says Mike
Marshall, the No-on-22 campaign manager.
"If it passes, it sends a profound message to
policy-makers and young gays and lesbians
who are struggling with their sexual orienta
tion."
Hollywood weighed in early with an artti
-22 television commercial last month by the
cast of NBC's "Will and Grace." which has
a gay lead character. It said the proposition
"increases the rhetoric of hate and intoler
ance" and would "inject the government
into the most personal decisions."
No state has legalized gay marriage. Ever

since 1 lawaii's Supreme Court raised the
possibility of same-sex unions in 1993,
Congress and 30 states, mostly in the South
and Midwest, have passed pre-emptive laws
saying they won't recognize such marriages
if they are legalized in any other state.
It is uncertain whether any of those laws
can get around the requirement in the U.S.
Constitution that states give "full faith and
credit" to other states' laws.
Hawaii has since adopted a constitutional
amendment barring gay marriage. Vermont
is the only state considering legalization, but
lawmakers are generally expected to
endorse domestic partner benefits instead.
Proposition 22 is known as the Knight
Initiative, after its sponsor. Republican state

Sen. Pete Knight, whose gay son David has
branded the measure a "blind, uncaring,
uninformed, knee-jerk reaction to a subject
about which he knows nothing and wants to
know nothing, but which serves his political
career."
Pete Knight has declined to be inter
viewed about the measure. In a statement
last October. Knight said he regretted that
his son had made a private matter public.
Backers of the measure appear to have
learned the lessons of past campaigns — a
proposed ban on gay teachers in 1978. and
Lyndon Laßouche-sponsored measures in
1986 and 1988 to quarantine AIDS patients.
All were defeated after their sponsors were
portrayed as bigoted extremists.
