# Committee refines president search
## Students give input on criteria at ASSU meeting 
### Anitha Reddy Staff writer 
The nomination process for
Stanford's next president, which
officially closed Friday, has yielded
400 possible candidates. The presi
dential search committee can now
begin narrowing down the list until
it arrives at a recommendation for
the Board of Trustees.
The Board hopes to announce
its final selection for the office by
early June.
Although the nominations
deadline was less than a week ago.
Deputy Chair of the committee
John Etchemendv. Philosophy De
partment chair, said that the com
mittee has spent almost all of its
meeting time determining the crite
ria by which they will judge candi
dates.
After listening to the opinions of
individuals "both internal and ex
ternal to Stanford," Etchemendv
described the requirements of the
committee succinctly.
"Basically." he said, the ideal
candidate "walks on water."
The .committee is currently be
ginning to investigate the back
grounds and qualifications of the
nominees.
"Some of the nominations are
very informative and some are sim
ply a name, and we'll have to gath
er information about the people
who have been nominated."
Etchemendv said.
The committee, which has al
ready met with the Faculty Senate

and held a forum tor students last
night, is often looking for "input
rather than a name," Etehemendy
said.
"We want to gather information
about what all the various con
stitueneies view as the challenges
and opportunities Stanford is going
to be facing in the next 10 years.
How should that translate into ;i
type of person?"
Etcheniendv said he had defi
nite goals for last night's student
forum. "It's important to hear what
the highest priorities should be:
where should we not compromise?
What are the things [that] would be

dealbreakers?" he said.
Two issues dominated the dis
cussion at yesterday's student
forum: graduate student life and
the need for more women and mi
norities in tenured or top adminis
trative positions.
Jackie Pratt, a senior resident
assistant in Synergy, said in recent
years there has been a "de-empha
sis on community, and an emphasis
on making money" by the Univer
sity.
She also said many students
were dissatisfied with the denial of
tenure to several women and mi
nority candidates.

"The next president should be
conscientious of women in the sci
ences and engineering and the lack
of female faculty in engineering,"
said Elizabeth Loboa Polefka, a
mechanical engineering doctoral
candidate.
Several panel members urged
students to identify colleges that
dealt with the issues they were rais
ing well, so that their approaches
could be used as models.
Isaac Stein, a law and business
school alumnus serving on the com
mittee. asked Loboa Polefka if she
