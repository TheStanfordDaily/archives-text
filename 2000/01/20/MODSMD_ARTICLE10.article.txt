Grozny has been a bastion of
rebel resistance throughout the war,
which has entered its fifth month,
and its capture would give the Rus
sian forces a boost after a series of
surprise counterattacks by the
rebels.
But control over Grozny could
backfire, as it did during the 1994-%
bloodshed in Chechnya. During
that war. Russians took the city and
held it for more than a year, but lost
it to the Chechens in a humiliating
and bloody defeat.
. After facing relatively little resis
tance in Chechnya's northern low
lands, Russian forces have been
stalled at Grozny for months and
only recently began pressing into
rebel strongholds in the southern
mountains.
In Moscow, the Russian bureau
of Interpol issued an international
arrest warrant for Chechen warlord
Shamil Basayev and 79 other rebels,
saying they may try to flee to neigh
boring countries, the Interfax news
agency reported.
The list included Chechens sus
pected of bombing apartment
buildings in Moscow and other
Russian cities in August, killing
about 3(X) people, and militants
who took part in an incursion into
the neighboring region of Dages
tan. Russian security forces moved
into Chechnya following these
events, saying they had to halt ter
rorism.
Vladimir Gordiyenko, head of
Russia's Interpol branch, said all
the wanted men are now in south
ern parts of Chechnya beyond the
front lines of Russia's armv. but

"some of them might turn up in
Azerbaijan. Georgia or Turkey."
On Wednesday, Russian heli
copter gunships and artillery
pounded the steep, wooded moun
tain slopes near the mouth of the
strategic Argun Gorge, about 30
miles south of Grozny. An AP
reporter took shelter behind some
rocks on the edge of the village of
Dachu-Borzoi as helicopters
swooped down to strafe the woods.
Eleven civilians were killed
Tuesday in an air raid against
Dachu-Borzoi, including seven
members of the family of local
administrator Alu Khasayev.
At the edge of the nearby village
of Duba-Yurt, a knot of elders
crowded around Russian officers
on Wednesday, pleading for an end
to shelling. Adam Akhyazov, chief
administrator of the village, said
three civilians had been killed in
Duba-Yurt over the past two days.
"When people want to leave the
village, the Russians prevent them,
promising not to target the village."
he said.
Meanwhile, a pro-Moscow
Chechen leader claimed Wednes
day to be mediating in talks
between several Chechen warlords
and federal authorities. Malik
Saidullayev said the talks were pro
ceeding "with difficulty." the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
He refused to say which federal
agencies were involved in the
alleged negotiations or to name the
Chechen commanders.
"(The federal authorities) need
to carry out a political dialogue
with these people, which is what
I'm doing," Saidullayev told Echo
