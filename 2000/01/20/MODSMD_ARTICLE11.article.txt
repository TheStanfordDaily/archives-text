# Family challenges INS ruling

### 
MIAMI (AP) â€” Elian, Gonza
lez's relatives in Miami went to
federal court Wednesday to chal
lenge the Immigration and Natu
ralization Service's ruling that the
6-year-old hoy must be returned to
his father in Cuba.
Lazaro Gonzalez. Elian's great
uncle. filed the federal lawsuit after
Attorney General Janet Reno
declared last week that the boy's
status was an immigration matter
solely in the jurisdiction of federal
law.
"It is about protecting Elian's
civil and constitutional rights, the
same as if he was any other child."
said Spencer Eig. a lawyer for the
great-uncle. Elian has been living
with his Miami relatives since he
was found floating on an inner
tube off the Florida coast Thanks
giving Day.
The lawsuit names as defen
dants Reno, INS Commissioner
Doris Meissner, INS District
Director Robert Wallis. the
Department of Justice and the
INS.
It accuses the government of
violating Elian's rights to due pro
cess of law and asks the judge to
prevent the INS from returning the
boy to Cuba before the agency
gives him an asylum hearing.
No hearing date was immedi
ately set. The Justice Department
and the INS said in a statement
they were prepared to respond
quickly and would ask the court
"to expeditiously address this mat
ter."
"It is important for the well
being of Elian Gonzalez that the
status of this 6-year-old boy he
resolved as quickly as possible."

the statement said.
Reno had brushed aside a ruling
from a Miami family court judge
delaying the boy's return. But she
postponed an INS deadline to
return the boy to his father in order
to give Elian's U.S. relatives time
to challenge the INS decision in
federal court.
Elian's mother and stepfather
were among I l people who
drowned trying to reach the Unit
ed States, and the boy w;is rescued
at sea by the Coast Guard after he
was found clinging to an inner tube
in the Atlantic.
The INS's top official initially
ruled Elian should return to his
father, and the agency rejected a
second asylum petition filed last
week on behalf of Elian by Lazaro
Gonzalez. The INS ruled that only
the boy's father can represent his
son.
Eig said Lazaro Gonzalez was
asking the court "not to decide the
issues in the case, not to take cus
tody away from Elian's father, not
to decide whether or not Elian
should go back to Cuba, simply to
compel the U.S. government to
give Elian a fair hearing and his
day in court."
Many legal experts have insist
ed since the fervor over the case
began that Elian's U.S. relatives
have no standing.
"All along, the legal issue has
been who speaks for a 6-year-old
boy. and the answer is the closest
surviving relative. That is the
father." said David Abraham, an
immigration law professor at the
University of Miami.
The president of Cuba's Nation
al Asseniblv. Ricardo Alarcon.

called Elian's Miami relatives "a
hunch of kidnappers" Wednesday
and said their attempts to keep the
hoy in the United States "ignores
the American government, show
ing disrespect for its institutions."
Leaders of several U.S. groups
that want Elian returned to his
father have warned they will call
for protests and acts of civil disobe
dience if the child is not sent back
soon. The groups denounced
Congress for considering legisla
tion that would grant U.S. citizen
ship to the boy over his father's
objections.
Sen. Connie Mack. R-Fla., who
is sponsoring a resolution to grant
citizenship to the boy, said
Wednesday: "This is an issue about
what his mother wanted for the
boy .... To ignore her interests
and her concern is unthinkable."
Mack, interviewed on CBS's
"The Early Show," was reminded
that Congress has rarely granted
citizenship; among the few recipi
ents were Winston Churchill and
Mother Teresa.
"Winston Churchill and this lit
tle boy have a lot in common. They
both stood for freedom," Mack
said.
Fidel Castro's sister Juanita
Castro, who left Cuba in 1%4 and
now lives in the Miami area, said
she hopes the matter can be decid
ed justly in court. She would not
say whether she thinks the boy
should stay or be returned to
Cuba.
"I hope what happens is the
best for him, for his destiny, for his
future," she said. "This case,
everything that has happened,
makes me verv sad."
