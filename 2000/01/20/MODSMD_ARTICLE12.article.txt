## Editorial Seeking employment? Head to the CDC for its Summer Job Week 
### 
So it's time to pull out that old
resume, dust it off and taek on
another year's worth of experi
ences. For those freshmen who may
not really have a resume, it's time to
get ambitious.
The next few days are crucial for
those students who want to find a sum
mer job. Not only is the Career Devel
opment Center's annual Summer Job
Week wrapping up, but on Saturday
more than MX) companies will set up
booths in Tresidder Union for the
Engineering Opportunity Job Fair.
The fact that the word "Engineer
ing" prefixes the OJF doesn't mean
that it's an exclusive affair for technical
majors. In the sea of people "seeking
CS, EE, ME and ChemE" you won't
find any brightly colored flags saying
"seeking fuzz-E," but you might be
surprised at how many recruiters will
accept resumes from liberal arts
majors.
And here's a tip that the techies
may *not want fuzzies to consider:
many of the techie jobs at the intern
ship level don't require in-depth skills
beyond simple Web programming. For
example, anyone who's taken CSIOS
will find themselves fully qualified for
a number of internships with computer
software and hardware companies.
Many of the companies at the OJF
will hire undeclared freshmen. At the
very least, the OJF is great practice for
selling yourself, so frosh shouldn't be
afraid to dress up this Saturday and get
out there.
Freshmen, even if you don't have
much work experience, write up a

resume stating your high school
achievements. At the job lair, a little
hit of assertion will go a long way:
shake the recruiter's hand firmly, intro
duce yourself immediately and ask the
person specifically about summer
internship opportunities for freshmen.
Don't hand them your resume right
away; you get big bonus points i! you
can get the recruiter to ask you for it.
The job fair aside, now is the perfect
time for all students to take advantage
of the multitude of opportunities at the
CDC They've worked hard to make
the job search process organized and
easy, so don't hesitate to visit them,
Ilieir on-line services are easier lo use
and more informative than ever,
thanks to a partnership with
jobtrak.com and the introduction of
the Internship Network. The CDC's
Summer Job Week events will be con
tinuing through Tuesday; check out
their Web site
(http://www.stanford.edu/dept/CDC)
to see what presentations are best for
you.
And don't forget that there are
wonderful summer job opportunities
all over campus. For example, a num
ber of fellowships offered through the
Haas Center for Public Service give
students the chance to improve com
munities without worrying about their
own financial needs. Plus, practically
every academic department on cam
pus offers summer research opportuni
ties to undergraduates.
Heck, even The Daily's gol a sum
mer internship program this year; we
try to match students with jobs at
newspapers across the country. So
whether you become a roving reporter
or a cubicle-dweller, summer job
opportunities abound for all. Here's
wishing you the best in vour job
search.
