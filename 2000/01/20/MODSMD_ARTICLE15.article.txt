lam all lor traditions.
Stanford hymn. Stan
lord Admit Weekend,
a cappella ... I think
school spirit and commu
nity are great. But I think
we need some new chal
lenges.

Indeed. Full Moon on the Quad stands
t»n a plane of its own in the school bonding
spectrum, hut I am convinced we need to
implement more non-academic prerequi
sites be lore gaining conferral of a Stanford
degree.
This campus seeps such potential for
adventure and new obstacles. I say, let's
reap the benefits of our architecture and
geography. Below is my list of pre-grad
"musts." Init feel free to add your own. We
need to work last to finish the list; some of
us only have until June.
First off. fountain hopping is a necessity
in your Stanford career. Optimal hopping
season is halfway into spring quarter, on
the occasional day when the heat just con
sumes you. Nothing spells relief better than
a plunge into the claw at midnight after
you've been smothered all day with the
Palo Alto humidity. 1 eel free to try this at
your own risk in the winter months. Guys,
beware of the shrivel effect.
Many Stanford students seem to have an
obsession or at least a reputation — for
delighting in nudity. Although I do not put
myself this category. I would not hesitate to
add in I ake Fagunita skinny-dipping to the
list (assuming we'll have a lake before
June). If you're afraid of the cold or the
tiger salamanders. I recommend the faculty
hot tubs. But careful not to trespass ...
I like to the Dish in time for sunset. I lie
foothills are the best remedy for making
chemistry problem sets vanish, il only tem
porarily. I here's also great walking or jog
ging terrain around the area behind Sla
viatiskii Dom. I .ver been to Slav Doni?

Check out a program there at least once.
C ienerally. time off campus is a big plus.
Weekend trips are the kind of experiences
you want to be able to recall as "those great
times" from college.
(io to Tahoe at least once, and ski the
Ciunbarrel to say you did it. Stay up all
night playing " Truth or Dare" or "Porno
Pictionary." but don't be stupid about ski
ing the next day. Gamble wisely.
Napa wine country is territory begging
for exploration. Monterrey and Santa Cruz
are a mere couple hours from campus, and
we know California beaches are certainly
not at an East Coast school's disposal.
Check out The Mystery Spot in Santa Cruz
if you haven't already, and see the laws of
physics defied.
Clubbing in San Francisco is a reservoir
of activity, and we are crazy not to tap it
more often. Clad with swing, salsa and
clubs of every groove, this buzzing
metropolis is 45 minutes away, but we too
often feel compelled to stay in close prox
imity of Green library rather than making
the minor trek up the 2NO Expressway.
Disneyland is six hours to the south —
five if you floor it. The prospect may
appear to be the height of American medi
ocrity. but I assure you it is well worth the
highway time sacrificed.
I never had quite as much fun as a 6
year-old as I did with four friends on a 36-
hour round trip to the Happiest Place on
Earth two years ago. A five-person co-ed
king size bed is something you have to
experience for yourself. And I think Mick
ey and Minnie are still reeling from the
stunts we pulled.
Back on campus, try a stroll through the
steam tunnels at night, but beware of where
the paths lead. If you end up in Gerhard's
office without knowing it.the conse
quences might outweigh the thrill.
At the illustrious I larvard University, stu
dents have three traditions that evervone

must fulfill before graduation, in ond&t&be
considered a "irue" Harvard man or woman,
whatever that may imply. One of
is to perform a coital act amid the of
Wiedner Library. I sometimes
we don't have a tradition like that hnana V.

I think it's important to pulC*ati*all
nighter at least once. Do it with a fuuijcHf it
will help to ease the fatigue. 1 did JJustwith
every political science paper 1 wrofcjjijslio
more year. For each assignment,
and I called each other at 30-minitte"inter
vals to check on our mutual progress. We
celebrated with a congratulatory trip to
Happy Donuts at 9 a.m. on the due date. I
know the idea sounds ridiculous. But dead
line adrenaline is unparalleled. . .
Make sure you run with the Band at
least once and cheer with vigor at more
than one Gaieties production. Throw paper
at Flicks even as a senior, and make more
frequent trips to the Dutch Goose.
Feel free to innovate if you have creative
ideas about Hoover Tower. Or try other
buildings. Watch a movie late at night on a
Ouad departmental building's big screen.
They leave them unlocked, you know.
De Guerre alter midnight bears a lot of
potential...
Pranks with Rodin sculptures invite a
new variety of opportunity. You really
have to run with what you have at your fin
gertips.
I can't stress the importance of levity to
break up our study hours. This list is a start,
but please let me know if something should
be added. And enjoy.

Sasha Polonsky has one column remaining,
which will run next Thursday. Please e-mail
her at sashp@leland with suggestions.
