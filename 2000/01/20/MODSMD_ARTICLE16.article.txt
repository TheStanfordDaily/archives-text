Limiting Stanford's growth
Willi reference to earlier letters and arti
cles relating to Stanford University's Land
Use Plan, it is important to remember that
Santa Clara County is responsible for the
open space requirements on county land.
Stanford land is zoned as agricultural.
Therefore any building plan Ar land use
change must be approved by the Santa
Clara County Board of Supervisors. In
other words, the County has the authority
and obligation to protect the public interest
vis-d-vis development pressures.
I mention this only because the argu
ment frequently heard is that Stanford's
land is private property and the County's
ability to restrict development is limited.
This is not so!
The County in past years has almost
always provided permits when Stanford has
requested changes. This was justified based
on the many cultural and educational
opportunities Stanford has provided to the

community.
Now. however, n is apparent that there
must be some limits to the projected growth
in Stanford's Land Use Plan. I suggest the
following:
No. 1: The Urban Growth Boundary
should remain at Junipcro Sena Boulevard.
No. 2: I he Urban Growth Boundary
should be permanent. Land to the south
should remain open space. This is a must!
No. 3: Support the housing for students,
faculty and staff as recommended by the
County Planning Department with the pro
viso that the housing be built before the
construction of new academic buildings, so
that the housing-jobs imbalance is not made
worse.
No. 4: Maintain the current County poli
cy of "no net new commuter trips" by vari
ous means available, such as locating hous
ing near public transportation and provid
ing bicycles or small electric cars at drop-off
locations.
Considering that Stanford's plan calls for

a one-third increase in the si/e of the Uni
versity and an increase in daytime popula
tion of 2.2(H) in just 10 years, the above rec
ommendations and limitations are reason
able and achievable.
I he power and authority to assure that
our quality of life and the health of the
community is not sacrificed on the altar of
never-ending growth and expansion rests
with the County Supervisors.

I 'm sure you've heard tons of complaints
about the situation with the new post office,
but I'd thought I'd throw my two cents in on
the issue.
My problem is that I am missing a chunk
of about a week's mail dating from late
December to early January. My mail is now
beiim delivered fine, but I haven't seen any

of my mail from that time period.
I should have received two credit card
statements and various mailings regarding
job interviews and opportunities, as well as
my February issues til "Motor Trend" and
"Road and Track." All of this is not exactly
expendable junk mail.
I don't know where my mail is pigeon
holed away in the big mess that is the Stan
lord post office or if it has simply been
thrown out. Whatever the case may be. this
is a rather unacceptable consequence of the
renovation.
Our postal workers were obviously not
ready for the transition and did not success
fully transfer our mail. We are left with yet
another demonstration of this office's
rather irritating incompetence, and 1 am left
with another reason for using any other post
office besides the one on campus when the
need arises.
