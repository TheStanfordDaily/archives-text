# Reality in Small Doses
## Is 'Nigger' still in our vocabulary?

s™™-
The. only time I have ever heard the
word "nigger" spoken out loud was in ref
erence to an Arab, not to someone who
was black. It always astounds me how eas
ily ugly words flow in our culture when
people are referring to Muslims and Arabs.
For years 1 did not notice the prejudice.
I laughed when people jokingly referred to
me as a terrorist when they found out I
grew up in Kuwait. 1 ignored the interroga
tion about the "Muslim roots" of my name
at the Paris airport last spring break. I
sighed stoically when in four of my classes
1 got assigned a book that referred to
Islam's "bloody borders." But enough is
enough.
1 know that to many. Muslim nations
are shrouded in the mystery of minarets

and men in long robes and women who
cover their hair. Not much is known about
"that part of the world," and what is known
is tainted by the crazed comments of fig
ures such as Saddam Hussein and Osama
Bin Laden. The embassy bombings and
plane hijackings and suicide killings perpe
trated in the name of Islam have not
improved Islam's public relations image in
the West either.
I recognize all this, and yet I cannot
believe how quickly people are willing to
dismiss the religion of 1 billion people as
the creed of madmen and murderers. Cul
tural stereotyping is rampant as Holly
wood uses the bearded Arab terrorist as
the new favorite movie villain, and news
paper headlines claim that the"Green
Menace" (the color of Islam) has replaced
the "Red Menace."
There are certain assumptions that we

all make when we think of Islam that need
to be seriously called into question.
Myth No. 1: All Muslims and Islamic
countries fit into one neat category of the
"Islamic world."
The reality is that 45 nations have offi
cially declared Islam their national reli
gion. There are large Muslim populations
in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, migrant
communities in Europe and in America.
There are white Muslims and black
Muslims and culturally-mixed Muslims
(like myself). There are people who favor
rigid religious interpretations of Islam and
others who take a more flexible approach.
There are governments who use Islam to
legitimate their rule and opposition groups
that use Islam to legitimate their protest.
No lump title can do justice to this kind of
complexity.
Myth No. 2: Islam is a violent religion.

The idea of Islamic "Jihad" or "Holy
War" has been much seized upon by the
public imagination. Technically, however,
"Jihad"' has a whole host of meanings,
including merely the struggle to live a good
life. Furthermore, Islam's Prophet
Mohammed preached a doctrine of reli
gious toleration. For example, Christian
and Jewish populations in early Islamic
empires were considered "people of the
Book" and protected.
If Islam has been abused by dema
gogues, it seems potently unfair to blame
the entire religion. We don't call Christians
the "new ideological menace" because the
Waco cult members committed mass sui
cide. We don't call all Americans barbar
ians because of the barbaric behavior of
two teen killers at Columbine High School.
And if we did generalize like this, it would
be fundamentally wrong of us to do so.

There is no "Green Menace," the Cru
sades are not still going on and there is no
need for the racial hatred that I have per
sonally seen exhibited against Muslims. Is
this form of cultural stereotyping any dif
ferent from the Japanese internment in
World War II? In the past, fear and cultur
al ignorance has led us to behavior that we
later regretted. Let us not repeat the same
mistakes today.
As I sit at the Stanford-in-Oxford house
computer cluster typing this column, I feel
like I have written a controversial piece.
That makes me sad. What is so controver
sial about asking people to examine their
prejudices and see beyond them?
