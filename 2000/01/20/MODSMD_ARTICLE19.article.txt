## From the cheap seats Ben Jones Hitting the Gym

It's a sport most commonly as
sociated with the Olympics,
like figure skating or synchro
nized swimming.
For most people, gymnastics is
a once-every-four-years-honey
grab-popcorn-Mary Lou Retton
is-on event.
At the collegiate level, the
University of Kentucky cheer
leaders get more press for their
backflips than do most gymnas
tics teams.

Well, folks, here at Stanford,
it's time for that to stop.
The men's and women's gym
nastics teams kick off their com
petitive seasons this month. The
women open up their home meet
season on Friday as the Arizona
Wildcats come to town, and on
Saturday, the men host the dread
ed Bears from across the Bay at
Ford Center.
If you watch gymnastics during
the Olympics and rr,i:s it in that
four-year interim or if you just
want to see an exciting, high-en
ergy sport, head over to Ford
Center some time this weekend.
Gymnastics is a unique sport
to watch because, for most peo
ple, it looks absolutely impossible
to do yourself.
You watch a basketball game
and think, "sure I can make a
three-pointer every once and a
while." But how many people can
watch a gymnast do four and a
half flips with a double twist on
the balance beam and think,
"piece of cake?"
Almost all of us played little
league or Pop Warner football
and most of us can catch a fish or
ski down the mountain now and

again. About one in a million of
us can do a Yurchenko off the
vault and stick the landing.
Gymnastics definitely has a
high "wow value" compared to a
lot of other sports. The grace and
sheer athleticism of a Michael
Jordan dunk or a Carl Lewis long
jump is just another floor routine
or vault for most gymnasts.
You watch the combination of
power and elegance in a floor
routine and the first word that
comes to mind is "wow."
You see the sheer upper body
strength necessary for the rings or
pommel horse, and the first thing
you think is "wow."
Another great element of the
women's competitions is the
chance to watch and cheer for the
athlete with perhaps the best
name in all of Stanford sports,
Jennifer Exaltacion.
Having a name like Exaltacion
on a gymnastics team is a little
like having a basketball player
named Rick Jumpshot or a base
ball player named Tom Icanhit
thecurveball. The only other
name in sports that compares is
golf's Chip Beck and no one's
heard a thing from him in the last
five years.
Jen X, as she's known to team
mates, leads a talented women's
squad that's ranked No. 19 in the
country and returns three Ail-
Americans from last year's team:
Sarah Harding. Kristin Jensen
and Larissa Fontaine.
With a deep men's squad that
has suffered few injuries in the
preseason training, coach Sadao
Hamada has high hopes for the
team when the NCAA meet rolls
around in April.
So, if you get a chance this
weekend, come check out the
gymnastics squads. 1 promise it's
more exciting than the l)K cheer
leaders.

Ben J ones, a junior, wants to thank
everyone who made it out to last
night's 21st Birthday fiesta. But
please, no more tequila.
