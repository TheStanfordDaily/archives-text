# Levin, Spence aim to add two trustees
## ASSU pushes for student representation on Board 
### Marisa Pavlik Staff writer 
The Stanford Board of Trustees
includes a wide range of individuals,
from businessmen such as Board
Chairman Robert Bass and Charles
Schwab to attorneys, a I larvard law
professor, a New Jersey councilman
and a federal court judge.
.However, at present, the Board
does not include any Stanford stu
dents.
The ASSU is gearing up for an ef
fort to gel student representation on
the voting Board, since students are
already on the Board's committees.
"To me, there is no greater way to
ensure that student voice is heard
than to have students on the full vot
ing Board â€” the highest level of de
cision-making." ASSU president
Mike Levin, a junior, said.
The Board covers "big picture
policy," Undergraduate Senator
Matt Spence said. That policy in
cludes creating departments, setting
the tuition rate and selecting a Uni
versity president, an important issue
this year since current President Ger
hard Casper is leaving.
"The group sets policy that direct
ly affects student lives," Spence said.
''Students are the closest to what's re
ally going on at the University and
can provide the best information."
Casper has encouraged the ASSI 1
to postpone adding students to the
Board until his replacement is in of
fice. according to Levin.
"However, President Casper en
couraged us to research how other
private peer universities have their
boards structured. We intend to do
just that." Levin said.
"We need students to show that

they want a member [on the Board|
and want to be represented." Spenee
said.
Students are already part of the
Board'seommittees, such as the Aca
demic Policy. Planning and Manage
ment Committee, the Land and
Building Committee, the Develop
ment Committee and the Alumni
External Affairs Committee.
Spence said that since students are
already voting on committees, they
ought to join the Board.
"Students can handle confidential
information and have just as much
time as people like Charles Schwab,"
Spence said. "Students are informed
and smart enough."
Spence said he envisions the
Board adding two students, one
graduate and one undergraduate,
chosen by the Nominations Commis
sion of the ASSI I. I le said he thinks
students will eventually get equal
voting power.
The Board currently consists of
two kinds of members: alumni
trustees who have five-year terms
and individuals appointed by other
trustees, who have 10-year terms.
The Board meets four times a
year on campus, in October. Decem
ber. February and June.
Spence said the students selected
to serve on the Board should have
"an understanding of the University,
a commitment to representing stu
dents and an understanding of the
long-term issues, not just the hot
issue of the day."
"Those appointed to the Board
would have to do the best they could
to hear as many student voices as
possible," Ixvin said.
Bass was unavailable for com
ment.
