# Moseley fires from long range
## Senior guard leads Cardinal on court and off with confidence, attitude 
### Jim Tankersley Senior staff writer 
A grin envelopes David Mose
ley's face as he walks out of the
Maples Pavilion locker room for an
afternoon interview. "Do you mind
if we just talk here?" he asks, point
ing to a side hoop.
He picks up a ball, dribbles it be
tween his legs once, and starts shoot
ing.
For the next 25 minutes, the se
nior guard shoots as he talks. Free
throws, lay-ups. 2()-footers.
An athletics department worker
leads a group of fifth-graders in.and.
between autographs, he shoots with
them.
He doesn't miss once. And that's
just what he expects.
"1 think every shot is going in."he
said, swishing a foul-line jumper. "1
feel like no one can stop me, because
I'm really confident in my ability."
This David Moseley looks and
sounds like the man Stanford fans
have come to know over the past
four seasons, a man who never saw a
shot he didn't like but made just 37.5
percent of his field goals through his
junior year.
But look at his numbers — and
talk to his coaches and teammates
and a different picture emerges.
On the strength of improved shot
selection and a more upbeat atti
tude, Moseley is averaging 11.5
points per game this season, third
best on the team and double his ca
reer average.
He has also been one of the Car
dinal's most consistent performers in
Pacific 10 Conference play. Last
weekend at Oregon State and Ore
gon, Moseley hit several key three
pointers and tallied 35 total points to
lead the No. 3 Cardinal to a pair of
victories.
"When you play 011 the road es
pecially." said freshman teammate
Casey Jacobsen, himself a prolific
scorer, "you have to have a guy to
step up and make plays. Mose is that
guy. 1 le's not afraid to step up and
take a shot. I le has no fear."
No one ever accused Moseley of
being afraid to take shots. More
often, they questioned the quality of

the shots he took. He was the guy
who would pull up from downtown
on a l-on-3 fast break, who would
drive the lane and throw up bank
shots while falling down.
"I really used to not listen to that
whole shot selection thing," he said.
This year. Mike Montgomery and
the Stanford coaching staff have
worked to sell Moseley on the value
of shooting within the rhythm of the
offense, when time has ticked off the
shot clock and Cardinal players have
rebounding position.
The result is a much-improved
shooting clip: 43 percent from the
field, 45 percent from behind the arc.
He still takes shots that surprise his
teammates or make fans and coach
es hold their breath, but this year,
he's making a lot of them.
"He's a guy that is a very good
shooter," Montgomery said, "and
he's also a guy that can hit with a guy
on him, and a lot of times make shots
where you might go, 'Oh no,' and
then it goes in."
Other parts of his game have im
proved. too. Teammates say Mose
ley has refined his ball-handling and
passing skills and makes a large ef
fort to involve other players in the
offense.
But Moseley's growth hasn't
been confined to the court. In the
locker room, where he sometimes
clashed with teammates in the past,
he is now a leader, particularly to
young players.
Jacobsen, Stanford's frosh phe
nom who leads the team in scoring,
said Moseley has mentored him and
helped him to feel accepted 011 the
team.
After Stanford's Jan. S loss to
Arizona in which the freshman
struggled from the field. Jacobsen
said Moseley tapped him on the leg.
reminded him that the season is
long, and said. "It's OK. We'll be
back."
"Ii was the perfect thing to say."
Jacobsen said.
That Moseley can fill a leadership
role for the Cardinal signals that he
has learned to harness his passion for
the game and confidence in his abili
ties.
"Dave has always led bv exam

pie." said senior Mark Madsen. who
shares captain duties with Moseley.
"He is the first guy at practice and
the last one to leave. 1 le is the reason
why we have intense practices. If
someone has come to practice not
ready to play, he'll hear it from
Dave."
II he gets on teammates, Moseley
said, it is because he expects big
things from them — and the team,
which he thinks has a shot at a na
tional title. I lis expectations for him
self are just as high.
Moseley stops shooting and holds

the ball lor a moment when htrialks
of his NBA dVeartis. He loves'bas
ketball. he said. and.htiavouldlike to
keep playing as long as he can. He
knows he's not on the top of any
body's scouting list, but he is confi
dent he'll gel there.
1 he interview ends as it began,
with a big smile and a handshake. He
jogs off to one of the main baskets. A
half-hour later, when nearly all his
other teammates have left for the
day.he is still there, alone on the
court.
Shooting.
