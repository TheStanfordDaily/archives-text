"They [BYU] came out playing
right from the start," sophomore
outside hitter Marcus Skacel said.
"We didn't start playing until the
third game. Nothing went right for
us at the beginning, we started fig

a whole other team in game three.
"BYU served very effectively
early on. but as the match went on

Billy Strickland's presence helped
us, we were passing and blocking
better with him in there."
Before the match, freshman
middle blocker Curt Toppel was
named MPSF player of the week,
recording 50 kills in his first two
collegiate matches.

"Marcus had a great hitting
match," Nieves said. "Especially
for an outside hitter who was going
against two man blocks."

Stanford as the squad heads into a
matchup with current No. 1 ULCA
