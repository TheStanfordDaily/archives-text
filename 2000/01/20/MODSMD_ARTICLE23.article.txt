## Smaller earthquakes help pinpoint faults better 
### Bruce Wang Editorial staff 
»'< Little earthquakes may provide
goo physicists with just as much
information as "The Big One."
! Major quakes have always pro
fadeld a wealth of data for geo
physicists to analyze and debate.
Stanford researchers are
finding that "little ones" — earth
quakes less than 5.0 in magnitude
offer information just as impor
tdnbas that provided by their scari
er scismic siblings.
* Smaller earthquakes provide
scientists with a unique means of
determining the detailed structure
'faults more accurately, said
J\ssoc. Prof, of Geophysics Grego
fy Beroza.
J "Dramatically improved earth
quake locations will allow us to
study earthquakes in fundamental
ly new ways," Beroza said.
*\ Beroza and his colleagues at
Stanford and the U.S. Geological
Survey have employed a method
culled waveform-based earth
quake location to pinpoint the
of small earthquakes.
'» The technique allows
researchers to determine precisely
the arrival time of seismic waves
by comparing seismic waveforms
qjf related, small quakes. Wave
forms arc the wiggles in a seismo
gj-am that represent ground
motion. Locating earthquakes
depends critically on these arrival
time measurements, and more pre
cise measurements lead directly to
more precise locations.
! "Small earthquakes have simple
signatures relative to large earth

quakes," Beroza said. "The time of
the earthquake origin is regarded
to be the time at which the fault
first slips. We can't measure this
directly but must infer it from the
arrival times of seismic waves,
which we can measure."
When an earthquake occurs, a
network of seismometers record
the tremors, allowing geophysicists
to when the first wave of seismic
energy arrived by looking at the
seismographs.
Beroza compares the improve
ment in the resolution of the seis
mic data to the enhanced image
resolution astronomers enjoy with
the Hubble telescope versus land
based telescopes.
"It completely transforms our
view of faults and brings seismicity
info focus," Beroza said.
On seismic maps, circles of
increasing size indicate earth
quakes of increasing magnitude.
Maps of seismically active regions
appear as a blur of circles due to
the inability of traditional detec
tion methods to distinguish
between individual tremors. With
pinpoint detection, the blurs
resolve into lines.
"What we see is kind of
bizarre," said Beroza. "We see
identical earthquakes that occur
over and over and over again on
the same part of a fault."
"We see streaks of earthquakes
— locations that are spread out
horizontally. And we see holes in
the seismicity — regions where
there are few earthquakes. We
don't yet know why these streaks
occur. We don't fully understand
the holes," Beroza said.

The method has been applied to
earthquakes of magnitude 5.4 or
lower. According to Beroza, the
technique works "really well" for
quakes of magnitude 4.0 and
smaller.
Most instruments go off scale
for larger quakes, Beroza said, and
further studies are needed to
determine to what extent the
method can be applied to larger
earthquakes.
The technique of waveform
based earthquake location is sim
ple. Seismologists look at wave
forms created by earthquakes and
estimate where the wave starts to
deviate from the baseline. This is
the arrival time of the seismic
wave.
Earthquake waves travel at a
speed of approximately six kilome
ters per second. This means that a
half-second error in determination
of the earthquake's start can result
in mapping errors of three kilome
ters or about two miles.
The seismologists then look at
waveforms from earthquakes that
occur at locations close to each
other. For these earthquakes, the
seismic waves recorded at the
Earth's surface will look very simi
lar, even if they occurred in differ
ent years. This approach takes
advantage of the similarity in
waveforms to dramatically reduce
the errors in arrival-time measure
ments.
The technique is not new. It has
been in use since the late 19705,
but only on a handful of quakes.
Over the past three years, Beroza's
group and others have applied the
method to a large number of

quakes.
It was employed on a few thou
sand aftershocks of the June 1992
Landers, Calif., earthquake in the
Mojave Desert to map fault struc
tures with enhanced precision. It
also has been used to pinpoint the

locations of more than 7,000 seis
mic events along California's
Calaveras faultline near Morgan
Hill.
Stanford Geophysics graduate
student Eva Zanzerkia used the
technique to show that some after

shocks of the 1992 Landers earth
quake occurred along well-defined
hut previously unidentified struc
tures and that an observed pro
gression of earthquakes along
these structures may be triggered
by water deep in the Earth's crust.
