# HEALTH BEAT
## Sweat-less exercise? 
### Bruce Wang Editorial staff 
The new year has just begun, and if you're
like many people who have vowed to "shape
up," your resolve is probably starting to crum
ble. Despite the best intentions, half of all
adults who begin a new exercise program quit
within six months.
While those who fail to keep their new
year's resolutions tend to see themselves as
exercise failures, the real problem is often the
mistake of doing too much too soon.
Fitness experts call it"the January Ist"
approach; after the six-week holiday "eating
season," people who have been inactive for
months or years lace up their sneakers and
work out with a vengeance. Typically these
over-zealous exercisers get injured or frustrat
ed and stop exercising. Many never start
again.
At the root of these "failed fitness" scenar
ios is the common misconception that exercise
is an "all-or-nothing" phenomenon: you either
go to the gym for an hour or get no workout at
all.
But new research demonstrates that exer
cise isn't an all-or-nothing proposition and
that activity need not be lengthy — or even
sweaty — to have significant health benefits.
In fact, it doesn't even have to be "exercise" at
all.
"Every step you take counts toward better
health," says a recently published article in the
Journal of the American Medical Association
(JAMA). The article reports that accumulat
ing small amounts of physical activity through
out your day can provide health benefits simi
lar to those you'd get from a traditional gym
workout.
Small changes are sensible because they
don't require large blocks of time or effort but
provide a realistic way for people to achieve
significant health benefits. This message was
reported in a new study done by Prof, of
Medicine William Haskell.
Haskell used e-mail at the office as an
example of the effect small physical activity
can have over time on the body.
"Consider the office worker ~. who
exchanges just two minutes of slow walking
around the office to deliver messages for two
minutes of sitting at a computer sending e
mail each hour for eight hours per day, five
days per week," Haskell wrote in JAMA in
19%. "Over the course of a year, the reduction
in energy expenditure due this change would

be equivalent to 1.1 pounds of fat. Over 10
years, a positive energy balance of this magni
tude could increase a person's body weight by
11 pounds."
E-mail, of course, is just one of countless
devices that have made our lives more seden
tary, contributing to our epidemic of obesity
related ailments. It's becoming increasingly
clear that in our push-button world we must
find ways to move if we want to be healthy.
So rather than resolving to do too much —
and setting yourself up for failure — why not
vow to make some small, healthy changes you
can stick with? The important factor is that
you commit to these changes and make them
a permanent feature of your life.
Here's a list of some small but significant
steps to get you started. Pick a few, and add
some of your own to make a list of realistic fit
ness resolutions you can keep.
I resolve to:
— park in the farthest space in every lot.
— use the bathroom on another floor and
take the stairs to get there.
— make the active choice whenever I'm
faced with the decision between moving and
standing still. For example, if I come upon a
stairway next to an escalator, I'll take the
stairs.
— avoid drive-thrus. At a fast-foyd restau
rant, I'll park and walk in.
— socialize actively. Instead of sitting and
talking with friends, I'll walk and talk whenev
er possible.
— use muscles, not machines. For example,
I'll get up and change the channel rather than
use the remote control.
— not let the sun go down without doing
some physical activity that I enjoy (for exam
ple, shooting hoops, dancing, jogging or play
ing tennis) for at least 10 minutes.
Once you decide on your "small change"
resolutions, put them in writing. It also helps
to have a supportive friend sign as a witness.
When you complete one month of sticking to
your moving vows, reward your triumph with
a healthy indulgence like a massage.
Build on these small changes over time,
with the goal of eventually accumulating 30
minutes of physical activity most days of the
week. Small changes in your daily activities
can add up to important health benefits such
as preventing weight gain and helping to regu
late blood pressure, blood sugar and choles
terol.
