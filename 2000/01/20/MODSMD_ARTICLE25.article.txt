# Screening for HIV drug-resistance

Even after the introduction of myriad
new HIV drugs, it's a frustrating fact that
certain HIV patients do not respond well
to current anti-viral drug therapies.
"Over half of patients in care experi
ence drug failure — that is. HIV returns
despite the medications," said Assoc.
Prof, of Medicine Andrew Zolopa. M.D.
Zolopa is the lead author of a recent
study that may help physicians predict
which of their patients will fail to respond
to particular drugs. This information will
he essential for tailoring effective treat
ment regimens to individuals.
Why might patients fail to respond to
drug treatment? It turns out that when an
HIV patient is treated with an anti-viral
drug, the virus may change and become
unrecognizable by that drug. In essence,
the virus is invisible to the drug because a
part of the HIV has changed its shape and
form. The virus accomplishes this by
altering, or mutating, its genetic
sequence.
HIV is very efficient at mutating its
genetic sequence whenever a threat to its
existence occurs. Treating a patient with
a drug may seem to work well at first, as
it can lower the amount of the virus in the
patient's bloodstream. Unfortunately,
individual viruses within that patient
mutate. The result is a newly shaped virus
that can now avoid destruction by the
anti-viral drug. This new form of the virus
can then be passed on to other individu
als.
"Patients are sometimes infected with

resistant HIV, and the drugs don't work
as well as they should even when these
patients are put on their first drug regi
men/' Zolopa said.
The Stanford study, reported in the
Dec. 7, 1999 issue of the Annals of Inter
nal Medicine, may help doctors identify
such individuals.
Patients who did not respond well to
previous anti-viral drug treatments were
enrolled in the study. Viral samples were
collected from each patient's blood
stream before the study began. The
patients were treated with different
drugs, and the effectiveness of the treat
ments was monitored. Researchers then
went back and looked at the viral samples
collected from each patient and analyzed
them for genetic mutations.
The tests showed a correlation:
patients who had viruses with particular
genetic mutations at the start of the trial
tended to lack a response to the subse
quent drug treatment.
In other words, viruses with certain
genetic alterations were not affected by
the treatment — they remained healthy
viruses despite the presence of a drug
designed to kill them.
Zolopa pointed out that there are pat
terns to the mutations, and in this study
they tended to be in the viral protease, an
enzyme necessary for the formation of
the mature virus. Mutations in the viral
protease can allow HIV to become resis
tant to a widely used class of drugs called
protease inhibitors.
Doctors can use this information when
treating their patients. By looking at viral

genetic material in a patient's blood, they
may be able to tell whether he or she will
respond to a particular protease inhibitor,
There arc many types of protease
inhibitors that recognize and target the
viral protease differently. It appears that
although there are differences in side
effects and individual patient responses,
there is no clear "best" protease
inhibitor, according to Zolopa. So there
are various treatment options for a
patient carrying a virus resistant to one of
these drugs.
Because HIV can acquire mutations
during the course of a person's infection,
sometimes drugs that work initially for a
patient fail to work over time.
"We do a lot of switching of regimens,
and the more regimens the patient has
been on, the harder it gets to control the
virus," Zolopa admitted.
Will HIV eventually be able to mutate
its genetic sequence so that it could
escape recognition by all of the drugs
available for treatment?
It seems unlikely that a super-resistant
virus will be floating around any time
soon. Zolopa stressed that most studies
show that only 10 to 15 percent of previ
ously untreated patients have evidence of
resistance to AZT, a widely used drug
since 1987.
We can only hope that scientific
research and drug discovery will stay one
step ahead of the ever-changing AIDS
virus. For now. though, studies such as
this one will help doctors use available
drugs to design the best possible treat
ment plans for their patients.
