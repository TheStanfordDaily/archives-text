# Increasing Axess' access: system capability grows
## 
### Megan Knize Contributing writer 
Over the next three years, Axess.
the program Stanford students use to
check their grades and file their study
lists, will undergo major changes.
Students may eventually be able to
use Axess to check on their financial
aid status, apply to the law school or
business school, or even preregister
for classes.
Last year, the Registrar's Office
purchased software from People Soft
to increase the services Axess pro
vides. Programmers and analysts
from the Information, Technology
and Systems Services spent most of
1999 trying to understand the pro
gram'scapabilities. When the project
is complete in 2(X)2. faculty, staff and
students will have equal access to a
wider range of Axess services.
"This will be more than just
Axess." said University Registrar
Roger Printup. who has named the
project "Axess 2(H M)." I he new sys
tem will encompass admissions, fi
nancial aid. the Bursar's Office and
the Registrar's ()llice.
"The goal this year is to create a
prototype ol the way Stanford
works." Printup said. "We need to
putin the majors we have and the
grades we use; we need to test it
under different scenarios."
Margo Kanncnberg is the project
manager for "Axess 20(H)" and is su
pervising the implementation of the
software.
"We're talking with |othcr] uni
versities who have purchased the
software." Kanncnberg said.
She added that many other insti
tutions. such as schools in the Cali
fornia State University system, al
ready use the software and that one
of its benefits is that students can pre
registei for classes. When Stanford
purchased the software last year,
mam students seemed concerned
that the two weeks that students

"shop" for classes would he eliminat
ed, hut project officials say the shop
piny period will actually increase.
Printup said he envisions a sce
nario where students register for
Winter Quarter classes around
Thanksgiving. Students could adjust
their schedules when they returned
from break, attend classes and then
drop or add classes as usual.
"We want to preserve the impor
tance of the shopping period," said
Religious Studies Prof. Hester Ciel
bcr, last year's chair of the Commit
tee for Academic Appraisal and
Achievement, which approved the
system last year.
Printup said that a major benefit
of preregistration is that it will "give
departments a heads-up so they can
putin an order for the bookstore, get
more TAs, or move to a different
room if the class is really big."
Printup said that because Stan
lord is on the quarter system, teach
ing is sometimes sacrificed if a class
enrollment is larger than anticipated.
"This is not intended to be an in
convenience," Printup said. " This is
intended to have a better education
al experience for students."
Freshman Chris Luhur, who will
use the new software when she isa ju
nior or senior, is skeptical about the
new program. "Part of the reason I
like Stanford is because it's so flexi
ble," she said. "A lot of people don't
know what they want to do before
the break."
Hut Printup said preregistration
is unlikely to be the first change
under the new system. I le said he ex
pects admissions to be among the
first groups on campus to make use
of the new software. Students may
he able to apply to Stanford under
graduate and graduate schools
through Axess.
" The project is going along fine,"
said Printup. "A lot of students prob
ably won't see the benefits, but we
will continue to march."
