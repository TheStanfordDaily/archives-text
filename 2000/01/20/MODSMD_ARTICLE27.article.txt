# New chapter in library security begins
## Bing Wing, Sweet Hall install surveillance cameras 
### Amy L. Kovac 
Video surveillance cameras
have been installed and are now in
use throughout both the newly
renovated Bing Wing of Green Li
brary and on the basement and

second floor of Sweet Hall. Repre
sentatives from both locations cite
security concerns as their primary
reason for introducing the cam
eras.
According to the Deputy Uni
versity Librarian Karen Nagy, the

video cameras in the Bing Wing
are part of the overall renovation
of Green Library and have been
included in the plans for several
years.
"There are two kinds of spaces
where the library is currently using
cameras: exit areas and places
where special collections are being
housed or used, and places such as
the Bender Room [on the fifth
floor], the third floor and other
reading areas that are not staffed
most of the time." Nagy said.
She said she believes the cam
eras are "a help to reader safety in
those areas."
Nagy stressed that the cameras
are only periodically monitored.
She also said that disclaimers
posted at all the entrances and
exits read, "The library periodical
ly monitors areas within the library
through the use of video cameras."
Nagy said she has not personal
ly received any complaints from
students regarding the cameras
and has actually heard positive
feedback from several library
users.
Steve I lansen. computer securi
ty officer and the person who first
suggested the use of security cam
eras in Sweet Hall, echoed Nagy's
comments regarding safety con
cerns.
He noted that Sweet Hall is
open to all users 24 hours a day,
seven days a week but that "there
is no staff on duty all the hours that
it is open."
The cameras were installed in
Sweet Hall just this year, but
Hansen said. "We have wanted
this for a long time."
While some people may believe
that the cameras were installed in
order to deter computer theft, the
primary reason for the cameras is

"for the physical security of stu
dents, especially for those working
late at night," according to
Hansen.
The tapes from Sweet Hall will
be viewed only if there is an inci
dent that warrants inspection or if
the police requests them tor an in
vestigation.
Students who use Sweet Hall
were not notified about the addi
tion of the cameras in the facility.
However, Hansen said the cam
eras are not a secret and that he
"wants people to know that they
are there."
Student response to the intro
duction of surveillance cameras
has varied.
Electrical engineering graduate
student Bob Lantz recently no
ticed the cameras in both the Ben
der Room and Sweet Hall and
said. "I don't think it's a good
precedent to have video surveil
lance."
Ruel Parent, also a graduate
student in electrical engineering
who frequently works in Sweet
Hall, said. "The cameras arc a
good idea."
Parent added that, based on the
positioning of the cameras, they
"can't see what you are working
on" and are not excessively intru
sive.
When questioned about his
opinion of surveillance cameras in
the Bender Room, junior Mike
Mongan expressed mild concern
about possible invasions of priva
cy. However, he said he under
stands that the cameras were in
stalled for safety reasons.
"Generally, I am not in favor of
the whole 'Big Brother is watch
ing' idea, but if it is for security
purposes. I guess it isn't too much
of a problem," Mongan said.
