# CDC offers opportunities for student job-hunters
## Cardinal Recruiting eases stress 
### Caroline Clabaugh 
Is there life after Stanford? The
Cardinal Recruiting Program at
the Career Development Center
certainly thinks so, despite many
students* reluctance to acknowl
edge that they, too, must graduate
and enter "the real world."
Cardinal Recruiting seeks to
provide employers and students
with a convenient opportunity to
interview on or off campus for full
time jobs and internships.
More than 1,400 Stanford stu
dents have registered with the Car
dinal Recruiting program this win
ter in hopes of interviews and jobs
with the 300 registered employers.
The program has undergone

major changes in the past few
years; students now submit their re
sumes online, and scheduling is or
ganized via the Cardinal Recruit
ing Web site.
According to Lance Choy, assis
tant director of Employment and
Internship Services, "Stress among
the students is less than ever" be
cause they have access to the list
ings seven days a week, 24 hours a
day, without needing to set foot in
side the CDC.
Additionally, the fully Web
based system has been up and run
ning for more than a year, so there
are fewer glitches than ever.
Choy reports that the job mar
ket is still good, especially in high
tech areas and investment banking.

Forty-eight employers in high-tech
firms are recruiting this winter, as
well as 30 in financial services and
24 in Internet and information
technology.
Liberal arts majors need not de
spair. Employers interviewing on
campus range from Apple Com
puter to New Horizons School to
Walt Disney Corporation.
Additionally, thousands of em
ployers who don't specifically re
cruit at Stanford are listed in the
JobTrak database available on the
Internet.
Choy encourages students to
look at these jobs as well: "Students
focus too much on campus recruit
ing," he said. "There are a lot of
other jobs out there."
