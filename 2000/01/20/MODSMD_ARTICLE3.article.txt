# Dispute to silence Band on Saturday
## 
### Anuj Gupta Editorial staff 
This Saturday, for the first time
in years, the UC-Berkeley men's
basketball team's home arena will
not resonate with the spirited tunes
of the Stanford Band during the
Stanford-Berkeley matchup.
The Band will not travel to the
game, following the Athletics De
partment's decision to reduce the
number of seats it offered to reserve
for the Band.
Band members have expressed
outrage at the Athletics Depart
ment's decision. "I'm angry, very
angry, at the whole situation." said
Band Manager John Chase, a se
nior.
Meanwhile Athletic Director
Ted Leland, who made the final call
on the matter, admitted "It was a
mistake on my part."
Fifty seats to allocate
The situation for Saturday's
game arose after the Athletics De
partment was allocated 150 seats for
the game by UC-Berkeley, whose
team is playing in the newly re
opened 12,300-seat Haas Pavillion.
While this is equal to the number
of tickets Stanford has given UC-
Berkeley for Stanford's home game
next month, it marks a significant
decrease from the past two years,
when UC-Berkeley's team was
playing at the New Arena in Oak
land, an NBA arena that seats near
ly 20,000.
In accordance with NCAA rules,
Stanford players and coaches were
given 100 of the tickets for Satur

day's game, leaving the Athletics
Department with 50 seats to allo
cate. The department offered the
Band 20 of these seats.
Twenty not enough for Band
However, according to Chase,
the band needs at least 30 seats to be
able to play.
"The way our music is arranged,
the minimum number we can really
play with is 30. Most of them over
there know that. Their taking 10
tickets away ensured that we
weren't going to be able to play."
Chase said.
According to Assoc. Athletic Di
rector Darrin Nelson. "What hap
pened was, we had an excessive
amount of demand for this game,
and we wanted the band to play with
10 less people, and they decided that
they couldn't."
The decision was made without
consulting the Athletics Depart
ment's Director of Marketing, Bob
Carruesco, who was on vacation last
week when Leland and Nelson
acted on the issue. Carruesco nor
mally serves as the liaison between
the Band and the department
Much of the Band's anger has
been provoked by the fact that
many of the 50 seats have been
given to boosters who have donated
money to the Athletics Depart
ment.
"The Band has been supportive
of Stanford Athletics for a long time
in good years and bad. The fact that
the basketball team is doing well this
year so they have to give tickets to
donors and aren't able to accomo
date us is a shame," Chase said.
Although some Band members
speculate that the tickets were given
only to the wealthiest boosters who
have given the most money to Stan
ford Athletics, Nelson vehemently
denied this
"They don't know who we're giv
ing the tickets to. [Some are given] to
donors, yes, but also to volunteers...
The tickets are spread around; they
are not necessarily only given to the
wealthiest." he said.
Band Public Relations Director
Joey Pritikin, a junior, disagreed.
"There was an implicit under
standing that they were giving [the
tickets] to people who give them
money, and we, as students, appar
ently don't give enough money," he
said.
k A pretty cold move'
Band members expressed displea

sure at the breach of tradition that the
Band's absence from the game repre
sents.
"We always make the trip over
there. It's close, it's Cal — our big
rival — and it's something we do
every year for the men's game and
the women's game. It's a big break
with tradition," Chase said.
Pritikin echoed Chase's senti
ments.
"We feel like it's a pretty cold
move. We've always been at basket
ball games. We were there before
team was one of the top in the na
tion."
"Besides the fact that we are al
ways there making noise and cheer
ing for team," Pritikin added, "this is
something we've earned over the
years and they've taken away from
us."
Nelson refuted the claim that
the Athletics Department is trying
to take away anything from the
Band.
"The Athletics Department has
supported the Band many times, and
to say that we were singling them out
for this game is absolutely ridicu

lous," he said.
Athletic Director admits error
Leland took the blame for being
unaware of the Band's 30-seat re
quirement.
"I was asked if I would be willing,
given the ticket demand, to reduce
the Band's ticket allocation from 30
to 20 for the game, and at the time it
sounded reasonable to me.... I
didn't understand the acoustical
needs of having 30 seats," he said.
"It's not a good deal, but the deci
sion was made, and it's irreversible
because the Band said they're not
going to go," Leland added.
Chase denied that the Band has
now refused to go to the game and
said the Band would still go if it was
provided with enough seats.
However, Chase added that he
understands the nature of Leland's
error.
"I'm sure Dr. Leland didn't un
derstand the situation entirely. Le
land has always been very supportive
of the Band. I hope this was a misun
derstanding ... and not a situation of
us being taken for granted."
