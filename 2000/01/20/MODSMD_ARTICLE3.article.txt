# Dispute to silence Band on Saturday
## 
### Anuj Gupta Editorial staff 
This Saturday, for the first time
in years, the UC-Berkeley men's
basketball team's home arena will
not resonate with the spirited tunes
of the Stanford Band during the
Stanford-Berkeley matchup.
The Band will not travel to the
game, following the Athletics De
partment's decision to reduce the
number of seats it offered to reserve
for the Band.
Band members have expressed
outrage at the Athletics Depart
ment's decision. "I'm angry, very
angry, at the whole situation." said
Band Manager John Chase, a se
nior.
Meanwhile Athletic Director
Ted Leland, who made the final call
on the matter, admitted "It was a
mistake on my part."
Fifty seats to allocate
The situation for Saturday's
game arose after the Athletics De
partment was allocated 150 seats for
the game by UC-Berkeley, whose
team is playing in the newly re
opened 12,300-seat Haas Pavillion.
While this is equal to the number
of tickets Stanford has given UC-
Berkeley for Stanford's home game
next month, it marks a significant
decrease from the past two years,
when UC-Berkeley's team was
playing at the New Arena in Oak
land, an NBA arena that seats near
ly 20,000.
In accordance with NCAA rules,
Stanford players and coaches were
given 100 of the tickets for Satur

day's game, leaving the Athletics
Department with 50 seats to allo
cate. The department offered the
Band 20 of these seats.
Twenty not enough for Band
However, according to Chase,
the band needs at least 30 seats to be
able to play.
"The way our music is arranged,
the minimum number we can really
play with is 30. Most of them over
there know that. Their taking 10
tickets away ensured that we
weren't going to be able to play."
Chase said.
According to Assoc. Athletic Di
rector Darrin Nelson. "What hap
pened was, we had an excessive
amount of demand for this game,
and we wanted the band to play with
10 less people, and they decided that
they couldn't."
The decision was made without
consulting the Athletics Depart
ment's Director of Marketing, Bob
Carruesco, who was on vacation last
week when Leland and Nelson
acted on the issue. Carruesco nor
mally serves as the liaison between
the Band and the department
Much of the Band's anger has
been provoked by the fact that
many of the 50 seats have been
given to boosters who have donated
money to the Athletics Depart
ment.
"The Band has been supportive
of Stanford Athletics for a long time
in good years and bad. The fact that
the basketball team is doing well this
year so they have to give tickets to
