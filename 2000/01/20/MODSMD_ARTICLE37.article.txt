## Greatest (fill in the blank) of the Century? Chad Martin vents his millennial frustration 
### 
Every hack critic, reviewer and entertainment columnist seems to have written
one of those "(Fill in the Blank] of the Century" articles. In order to prove that
I'm as much a hack as anyone and earn the respect of my peers, here are my
choices for "Blank of the Century!"
Musician of the Century: Bo Diddley. Bluesman turned first-generation rock-and
roller, Bo Diddley (Ellas Otha Bates McDaniels) shared a similar background and the
Chess label with Chuck Berry, but never gained Berry's popular appeal. This was
probably because Mr. Diddley's music could scarcely conceal its raw sexuality.
Largely a one-trick pony, most of his tunes are based around the same grinding
beat, which he called "jungle rhythm." This music provided the inspiration for many
bad-boy rock acts, such as the Rolling Stones, the Animals, the Yardbirds, the Quick
silver Messenger Service and the Pretty Things (who took their name from a Diddley
tune).
He was certainly a unique rocker. His guitars were custom-made by Gretsch in the
shape of rectangles, trapezoids and other geometric shapes. Not only did he employ a
full-time maraca player (Jerome Green) who stood onstage with two maracas in each
hand looking cool and detached while lashing out the nasty beat, he also wrote a song
about him ("Bring It To Jerome," in which no doubt is left as to what "It" is). He also
appears with Jerome on "Say Man," a song in which they take turns insulting each
other along the lines of "Your girl so ugly, she has to sneak up on the glass to get a
drink of water."
Most of all, though, Bo Diddley wrote songs about what a stud Bo Diddley is.
"Hey! Bo Diddley," "Diddley Daddy," "Story Of Bo Diddley," "Bo Diddley Is
Loose," "Bo Diddley Is A Gunslinger" and "Bo Diddley Is A Lover" — to name but
a very few — serve to remind the listener that Mr. Diddley is meaner, tougher, cooler
and sexier than you are. He was, in his own words, "a young woman's wish and an old
woman's dream." Some artists' songs invite involvement and identification with the
singers. These do not. Bo Diddley is a bad-ass, and you're just some schmoe lucky
enough to be listening to him.
Film of the Century: "Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!" First thing I've got to say here is
that I'm not a breast man. I suppose any reviewer who praises this Russ Meyer film
(or any of his other films) could be accused of just wanting to see a bunch of pneumatic
babes in tight clothes. Not that I'm opposed to that, mind you, but there is just so much
more here. The movie tackles the universal theme of what happens when a bunch of
go-go dancers on a rampage come across a reclusive family of half-mad rednecks.
What ensues offers something for everyone. Where else can you see a mean old
man in a wheelchair get run over by a sports car? Where else can you see a woman in
hot pants try to seduce a muscle-bound and mentally retarded guy (named "Veg
etable") with lines such as, "It looks like you've got two of everything, and more in
some places" and "You Tarzan, me Jane, now let's grab a vine and swing a little."

It's not just the sex, violence and less-than-politically-correct treatment of the phys
ically and mentally handicapped that make this film great; it's also that Meyer is an in
credible filmmaker. He learned his trade in the army, shooting combat documentaries
in World War 11. His odd camera angles and editing techniques were revolutionary
and have been copied by action directors ever since this 1965 classic came out.
Meyer wrote, produced, directed and edited this masterpiece, and every bit of it
shows his unique vision. This vision realized, in part, that an Asian-American woman
with the name Tura Satana, very large breasts and a proficiency in karate was pure star
potential. He's supposed to be working on his next movie, "The Bra of God," with past
collaborator Roger Ebert. Let's hope it's as good as this.
Actor of the Century: Elisha Cook Jr. From the first time I saw Cook — as Wilmer
the Gunsel in"The Maltese Falcon" — I realized I was watching greatness. Who else
could get slapped around by Bogart with such style? There's one moment — when all
the opposing factions come together and agree that Wilmer has to be sold out, given

cation with the einqere. Theee do not. s>o Diddley is

enough to be listening to him.

up to the police so that the rest can get away — that Cook shines. It almost looks like
he's going to cry.
He continued to touch my heart as the jazz drummer in"The Phantom Lady," op
posite Lawrence Tierney in "Dillinger" (where he tells the title character, "You just
can't go around killing people whenever the mood strikes you") and reprising oppo
site Bogart in"The Big Sleep." Perhaps he is most famous for his great moment in
"Shane," where he is viciously cut down on the sidewalk by Jack Palance's gunslinger.
In fact, Cook almost always ended up dead in these movies. Best of all was his role as
the hen-pecked husband in Kubrick's "The Killing." He is hapless, dominated and, in
the final scene, dead.
The reason that Cook is the actor of the century is that he played you and me. Let's
face it, the world is not full of leading men. It's full of homely, unlucky and awkward
people. Go look in the mirror. You're not George Clooney or Matt Damon or Keanu
Reeves or even Mark Wahlberg. You're a putz, and Elisha Cook Jr. allowed putzes
like you to see themselves on the big screen. He wasn't just the token loser; he took
the role much deeper than that. In a world full of bit players, he showed that you can
shine with dignity and style in even a minor role. While you and I might not kill the
bad guy and get the girl in the last reel, at least we can live up to Cook's example.

a very few — serve to remind the listener that Mr. Diddley is meaner, tougher, cooler
and sexier than you are. He was, in his own words, "a young woman's wish and an old
woman's dream." Some artists' songs invite involvement and identification with the
singers. These do not. Bo Diddley is a bad-ass, and you're just some schmoe lucky
enough to be listening to him.
Film of the Century: "Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!" First thing I've got to say here is
that I'm not a breast man. I suppose any reviewer who praises this Russ Meyer film
(or any of his other films) could be accused of just wanting to see a bunch of pneumatic
babes in tight clothes. Not that I'm opposed to that, mind you, but there is just so much
more here. The movie tackles the universal theme of what happens when a bunch of
go-go dancers on a rampage come across a reclusive family of half-mad rednecks.
What ensues offers something for everyone. Where else can you see a mean old
man in a wheelchair get run over by a sports car? Where else can you see a woman in
hot pants try to seduce a muscle-bound and mentally retarded guy (named "Veg
etable") with lines such as, "It looks like you've got two of everything, and more in
some places" and "You Tarzan, me Jane, now let's grab a vine and swing a little."

It's not just the sex, violence and less-than-politically-correct treatment of the phys
ically and mentally handicapped that make this film great; it's also that Meyer is an in
credible filmmaker. He learned his trade in the army, shooting combat documentaries
in World War 11. His odd camera angles and editing techniques were revolutionary
and have been copied by action directors ever since this 1965 classic came out.
Meyer wrote, produced, directed and edited this masterpiece, and every bit of it
shows his unique vision. This vision realized, in part, that an Asian-American woman
with the name Tura Satana, very large breasts and a proficiency in karate was pure star
potential. He's supposed to be working on his next movie, "The Bra of God," with past
collaborator Roger Ebert. Let's hope it's as good as this.
Actor of the Century: Elisha Cook Jr. From the first time I saw Cook — as Wilmer
the Gunsel in"The Maltese Falcon" — I realized I was watching greatness. Who else
could get slapped around by Bogart with such style? There's one moment — when all
the opposing factions come together and agree that Wilmer has to be sold out, given

up to the police so that the rest can get away — that Cook shines. It almost looks like
he's going to cry.
He continued to touch my heart as the jazz drummer in"The Phantom Lady," op
posite Lawrence Tierney in "Dillinger" (where he tells the title character, "You just
can't go around killing people whenever the mood strikes you") and reprising oppo
site Bogart in"The Big Sleep." Perhaps he is most famous for his great moment in
"Shane," where he is viciously cut down on the sidewalk by Jack Palance's gunslinger.
In fact, Cook almost always ended up dead in these movies. Best of all was his role as
the hen-pecked husband in Kubrick's "The Killing." He is hapless, dominated and, in
the final scene, dead.
The reason that Cook is the actor of the century is that he played you and me. Let's
face it, the world is not full of leading men. It's full of homely, unlucky and awkward
people. Go look in the mirror. You're not George Clooney or Matt Damon or Keanu
Reeves or even Mark Wahlberg. You're a putz, and Elisha Cook Jr. allowed putzes
like you to see themselves on the big screen. He wasn't just the token loser; he took
the role much deeper than that. In a world full of bit players, he showed that you can
shine with dignity and style in even a minor role. While you and I might not kill the
bad guy and get the girl in the last reel, at least we can live up to Cook's example.
