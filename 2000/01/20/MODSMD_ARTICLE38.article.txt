Welcome to the most intense fight
ing game ever: Quake 111 Arena.
The rules are simple. Grab a gun
and mow down the opposition. In the Arena
Eternal, your job is to kill your adversaries
more than they kill you. After assuming the
role of one of more than 30 humans, mutants
or non-terrestrial beings, the game thrusts
your effigy into a world of lightning-fast may
hem, where no death matters except your
final one.
The graphics are stunning, as demonstrat
ed by the beautiful discharge of human body
parts after contact with an exploding
grenade. The sound effects are equally per
fect, as the guns sound real and the ominous
voice of the announcer strikes fear into the
heart of every gamer. Elementary gameplay

comes easily, while gaining a grasp of the ad
vanced controls comes only after scores of
hours of gaming.
Single-player mode offers five different
difficulty settings, which is a good thing be-

cause winning
would be al
most impossi
ble without

some kind of computer-bestowed edge.lf
you choose to play the highest level, "Night
mare!" will provide a consummate challenge
for even the most practiced player.
But enough with the single-player
mode — Quake Ill's real excitement stems
from the multi-player mode. Connecting to
other humans via the Internet, you can take
the pleasure of gunning down gladiators

from across the globe in a matter of seconds
from the comfort of your own dorm room.
On last count, there were more than 420
active Quake 111 servers, offering hundreds
of different game scenarios, numbers of op
ponents and frag limits. Quake is a huge
world, with hundreds of Web sites devoted to
the game series. Part of its popularity is based
on its flexibility and replayability: new arenas
can be built, new characters created and new
scenarios designed.
I highly recommend Quake 111 Arena for
fans of any fighting game. Quake 111 stimu
lates the mind and induces adrenaline secre
tion — play it for a taste. Take the following
words of wisdom with you: Frag Everything
That Isn't You.
