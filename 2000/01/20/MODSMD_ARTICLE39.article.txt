## Black on all Sides 
### 
How many sides are there to Mos
Def? The name Mos Def in itself has
double meaning. In a freestyle at
Amoeba music in San Francisco, Mos de
scribed his name as "Ebonic for 'most cer
tain,' " or "most definitely." But Mos Def
also refers to the lyrical skills of an MC at the
top of his game — he's the mos def.
Mos Def himself often defies definition
and constantly pushes critics toward redefin
ition. Other recent hip-hop has done the
same. As soon as you back it up into a corner,
it finds a way out. Mos Def is but an individ
ual representation of this multidimensional
genre, joining Tupac Shakur, DMX, Pharoa
he Monch, Lauryn Hill, E-4() and Master P
(to name a few) as those who continue to stun
and confuse hip-hop critics.
In discussing hip-hop, people often ask
Mos, "What do you think is going to happen
with hip-hop?"
Mos responds in a common-sense man
ner: "You know what's going to happen with
hip-hop? Whatever's happening with us. If
wc smoked out, hip-hop is going to be
smoked out. If we're doing all right, hip-hop
is going to be all right. People talk about hip
hop like it's some giant living in the hillside
coming down to visit the townspeople. We
are hip-hop. Me. You. Everybody. We are
hip-hop. So, hip-hop is going where we're
going. So, the next time you ask yourself
where hip-hop is going, ask yourself, 'Where
am I going?' 'I low am I doing?' Then, you'll
get a clearer idea."
Thus, Mos recognizes that hip-hop is a re
flection of our society's attitudes, values, be
liefs and philosophies. Whatever's happen
ing to African-American communities across
the nation is happening to hip-hop.

A Family Man
Mos places a strong emphasis on family. His parents,
IJmi and Abi, stand faithfully by his side while he is on
tour — a literal family affair. Mos reflected on the im
portance of having family support in this ruthless rap
game. "They're just here to make sure that I'm safe, that
I'm protected while I'm going through this,"he said.
"And I try to take care of them the best that I can, be
cause they've been taking care of me all my life. And they
still do. Sometimes I don't want them to go because I feel
guilty, but I can't keep them off the road! They're like,
'No, we're going!'"
After his laughter subsided. Mos added in a serious
tone, "I mean, I have a good time with them. I'm really
fortunate I can have a real good time with my folks. My
parents are like my best friends. And I'm just grateful to
Allah that I have them. They love to be here, and they're
willing to do this."
It is no surprise why Mos dedicates a song on his
album, "llmi," to his mother and also mentions his fa
ther. Mos Def himself is now a father. Me verbalized the
difficulty many new parents have in describing the love
for their children. "Your kids change you. I can't really
even describe it. Your children just change you. [They]
opened up my heart to things that the English language
is too weak to describe," he said.
A Brooklyn Man
Mos goes back to his birthplace, Brooklyn, the land
that shaped his hip-hop aesthetics. "I grew up every
where, but I (really] grew up in Bed-Stuy," he said. "And
I grew up with people loving where they came from, [say
ing things] like, 'Bed-Stuuuuy!' Brooklyn was fanatical
with it to a degree. Brooklyn just always had that reputa
tion. When there were Brooklyn dudes at a party — the
party got liver! Brooklyn is just one of those places. It's
got something on it. I can't really describe it, but it's got
something on it."

That something must have been communicated to
Mos by his grandmother, who lived in Brooklyn for more
than 4() years. His mother and his daughters were also
born in Brooklyn.
The love for Brooklyn shows up throughout Mos's
new album, "Black On Both Sides." Mos opens up with
"Ooh-oooooooooohweeeeeh! That was for Brooklyn!"
Mos explained why he dedicated an entire song to
Brooklyn? "Because it's home. Everybody has to repre
sent home. And 1 love Brooklyn. There was a time in
New York history when Brooklyn was going to secede
from New York and be its own state. Lots of Brooklyn
used to be farmland, you know. But it still has that spirit
about it. Small town neighborhoods. People know each
other. People talk to each other. People are very loyal to
their neighborhood. There's history there. There's a lot
of love in Brooklyn."
A Music Man
What excites Mos Def the most is hip-hop. You could
see it in the shine of his eyes when he talked about it. Hip
hop memories: "Yo, I just grew up in the era. I came up
when things like "Wild Style' were in the theatres. And
people were still wearing Pumas. 1 lived that!
"So when people talk to me about hip-hop, it's like
talking to (Max Roach] about the Bop era. 1 was in [Eu
rope] two years ago, and it dawned on me that I was in
Germany — rhyming. And 1 was like, 'Yo, I'm not a en
gineer. I'm not in the service. I'm not German, but I'm in
Germany rhyming.' If somebody would have told me
that 10 years ago. I never, never would have believed it."
Rhyming is Mos Defs domain. Many observers rec
ognize Mos Def as one of the most talented MCs in the
game. He described the most important characteristics of
a good MC: "It's a sense of personal investment. [The
Notorious 8.1.G.] really believed it in his heart. [Tupac]
was like that. It's the passion. That pushes a lot of MCs
forward. Of course, there's a lot of other technical facili

ties like flow and delivery and [becoming] distinctive.
"Slick Rick is one of the greatest MCs ever born be
cause he has so many different facilities that he would
use. Style. Vocal texture. The way he would record. He
was doing call and response with himself! He would leave
four bars open and then do another character. That's
part of the reason Redman is so good — because lie s
like a hardcore version of Slick Rick."
On his new album. Mos collaborated with a few select
artists, including Q-Tip, Talib Kweli, Vinia Mojica and a
surprise — Busta Rhymes. The latter and Mos exchange
lively, hyperactivate verses with a chemistry that spills
out the speakers on "Do It Now."
Mos recounted how these two MC's came together:" 1
was just like, 'I want to do a joint with Busta.' I wanted to
pick a joint that would make sense to do. Something that
we would both sound good on. 1 went through a series of
beats and picked the one that 1 liked. 1 called Busta; he
was with it. I mean, Busta has always been bigging me up
for a while. And 1 have always been a Busta fan. Things
that Busta has done in recent history are ingenious to
me."
"Black On Both Sides" was originally intended to be
a double-album. Mos recorded more than 40 tracks for
the work but had to narrow it down to 17. The album as
a whole is a testament to the power of the word and the
power of the drum. Mos combines beats and rhymes to
examine the history, musical contributions and the pre
sent and future state of Blacks in America.
Songs such as "Mr. Nigga" focus a scrutinizing lense
on contemporary American society and the double stan
dards that exist for African-Americans and whites in the
year 2(XX). With so many people throwing the word
"nigga" around, this one should be a wake-up call.
Spiritual tracks such as "Fear Not Of Man" and
"Know That," with Talib Kweli, offer a refreshing out
look on some serious issues. The temporal nature of
things resonates in the repeated phrase, "Tomorrow


Abdul Alim — Daily
ain't promised to no one." "Mathematics," "Speed
Law" and "New World Water" are highly lyrical pieces
with clever wordplay. Further, "Ms. Fat Booty" brings
you right to the dance floor.
Mos revealed the meaning behind his new album's
title, "I came up with [the phrase] 'Black On Both Sides'
because it felt like I was working with both hemispheres
of my brain. And it was two sides of my personality. And
it was all black. And I didn't want to get into that space
where I knew that there were things that I was doing that
— it wasn't that they were untraditional — but they
weren't the type of things that the media and the indus
try are used to hearing from the black male perspec
tive."
Songs such as "Hip Hop" and "Rock 'N' Roll" touch
on these very issues. Mos represents Black music's con
temporary manifestation of what W. E. B. Du Bois
called the "push-pull" double consciousness in African-
American identity. Mos: "For so long, when we do art
like that, it's like you're not authentically Black, like
you're giving up some part of your cultural identity to
explore these other sides of music. And that's not true.
It's like you're alternative, you know. And it disengages
you from the community. And I'm not trying to do that
at all.
"What I'm trying to show to the [Black] community
is that we can do whatever we want," Mos said. "We
don't have to be defined as these little, one-dimensional
folks."
Somewhere in the distance, Umi and Abi are smiling.
Recently, Mos gathered several artists — including
Common, Kool G Rap and Pharoahe Monch — to ad
dress police brutality in a project called "Hip-Hop For
Respect." In addition, he and Black Star partner Talib
Kweli have recently taken over Brooklyn's oldest black
bookstore, N'Kiru, saving it from going out of business.
Despite his recent worldwide success, Mos remains
humble and grounded with a belief that this success is all
a blessing.
"I just try to keep real people around me," Mos said.
"And I try to stay open to what's going on in the world
and say, 'I'm not that important.' There are people on
distant shores literally fighting for their freedom. Ready
to die. I'm a writer. I'm a poet. I try to tell the truth, what
I understand to be the truth. But I'm not that worthy of
attention."

Kweli have recently taken over Brooklyn's oldest black
bookstore, N'Kiru, saving it from going out of business.
Despite his recent worldwide success, Mos remains
humble and grounded with a belief that this success is all
a blessing.
"I just try to keep real people around me," Mos said.
"And I try to stay open to what's going on in the world
and say, 'I'm not that important.' There are people on
distant shores literally fighting for their freedom. Ready
to die. I'm a writer. I'm a poet. I try to tell the truth, what
I understand to be the truth. But I'm not that worthy of
attention."

How many sides are there to Mos
Def? The name Mos Def in itself has
double meaning. In a freestyle at
Amoeba music in San Francisco, Mos de
scribed his name as "Ebonic for 'most cer
tain,' " or "most definitely." But Mos Def
also refers to the lyrical skills of an MC at the
top of his game — he's the mos def.
Mos Def himself often defies definition
and constantly pushes critics toward redefin
ition. Other recent hip-hop has done the
same. As soon as you back it up into a corner,
it finds a way out. Mos Def is but an individ
ual representation of this multidimensional
genre, joining Tupac Shakur, DMX, Pharoa
he Monch, Lauryn Hill, E-4() and Master P
(to name a few) as those who continue to stun
and confuse hip-hop critics.
In discussing hip-hop, people often ask
Mos, "What do you think is going to happen
with hip-hop?"
Mos responds in a common-sense man
ner: "You know what's going to happen with
hip-hop? Whatever's happening with us. If
wc smoked out, hip-hop is going to be
smoked out. If we're doing all right, hip-hop
is going to be all right. People talk about hip
hop like it's some giant living in the hillside
coming down to visit the townspeople. We
are hip-hop. Me. You. Everybody. We are
hip-hop. So, hip-hop is going where we're
going. So, the next time you ask yourself
where hip-hop is going, ask yourself, 'Where
am I going?' 'I low am I doing?' Then, you'll
get a clearer idea."
Thus, Mos recognizes that hip-hop is a re
flection of our society's attitudes, values, be
liefs and philosophies. Whatever's happen
ing to African-American communities across
the nation is happening to hip-hop.

A Family Man
Mos places a strong emphasis on family. His parents,
IJmi and Abi, stand faithfully by his side while he is on
tour — a literal family affair. Mos reflected on the im
portance of having family support in this ruthless rap
game. "They're just here to make sure that I'm safe, that
I'm protected while I'm going through this,"he said.
"And I try to take care of them the best that I can, be
cause they've been taking care of me all my life. And they
still do. Sometimes I don't want them to go because I feel
guilty, but I can't keep them off the road! They're like,
'No, we're going!'"
After his laughter subsided. Mos added in a serious
tone, "I mean, I have a good time with them. I'm really
fortunate I can have a real good time with my folks. My
parents are like my best friends. And I'm just grateful to
Allah that I have them. They love to be here, and they're
willing to do this."
It is no surprise why Mos dedicates a song on his
album, "llmi," to his mother and also mentions his fa
ther. Mos Def himself is now a father. Me verbalized the
difficulty many new parents have in describing the love
for their children. "Your kids change you. I can't really
even describe it. Your children just change you. [They]
opened up my heart to things that the English language
is too weak to describe," he said.
A Brooklyn Man
Mos goes back to his birthplace, Brooklyn, the land
that shaped his hip-hop aesthetics. "I grew up every
where, but I (really] grew up in Bed-Stuy," he said. "And
I grew up with people loving where they came from, [say
ing things] like, 'Bed-Stuuuuy!' Brooklyn was fanatical
with it to a degree. Brooklyn just always had that reputa
tion. When there were Brooklyn dudes at a party — the
party got liver! Brooklyn is just one of those places. It's
got something on it. I can't really describe it, but it's got
something on it."

That something must have been communicated to
Mos by his grandmother, who lived in Brooklyn for more
than 4() years. His mother and his daughters were also
born in Brooklyn.
The love for Brooklyn shows up throughout Mos's
new album, "Black On Both Sides." Mos opens up with
"Ooh-oooooooooohweeeeeh! That was for Brooklyn!"
Mos explained why he dedicated an entire song to
Brooklyn? "Because it's home. Everybody has to repre
sent home. And 1 love Brooklyn. There was a time in
New York history when Brooklyn was going to secede
from New York and be its own state. Lots of Brooklyn
used to be farmland, you know. But it still has that spirit
about it. Small town neighborhoods. People know each
other. People talk to each other. People are very loyal to
their neighborhood. There's history there. There's a lot
of love in Brooklyn."
A Music Man
What excites Mos Def the most is hip-hop. You could
see it in the shine of his eyes when he talked about it. Hip
hop memories: "Yo, I just grew up in the era. I came up
when things like "Wild Style' were in the theatres. And
people were still wearing Pumas. 1 lived that!
"So when people talk to me about hip-hop, it's like
talking to (Max Roach] about the Bop era. 1 was in [Eu
rope] two years ago, and it dawned on me that I was in
Germany — rhyming. And 1 was like, 'Yo, I'm not a en
gineer. I'm not in the service. I'm not German, but I'm in
Germany rhyming.' If somebody would have told me
that 10 years ago. I never, never would have believed it."
Rhyming is Mos Defs domain. Many observers rec
ognize Mos Def as one of the most talented MCs in the
game. He described the most important characteristics of
a good MC: "It's a sense of personal investment. [The
Notorious 8.1.G.] really believed it in his heart. [Tupac]
was like that. It's the passion. That pushes a lot of MCs
forward. Of course, there's a lot of other technical facili

ties like flow and delivery and [becoming] distinctive.
"Slick Rick is one of the greatest MCs ever born be
cause he has so many different facilities that he would
use. Style. Vocal texture. The way he would record. He
was doing call and response with himself! He would leave
four bars open and then do another character. That's
part of the reason Redman is so good — because lie s
like a hardcore version of Slick Rick."
On his new album. Mos collaborated with a few select
artists, including Q-Tip, Talib Kweli, Vinia Mojica and a
surprise — Busta Rhymes. The latter and Mos exchange
lively, hyperactivate verses with a chemistry that spills
out the speakers on "Do It Now."
Mos recounted how these two MC's came together:" 1
was just like, 'I want to do a joint with Busta.' I wanted to
pick a joint that would make sense to do. Something that
we would both sound good on. 1 went through a series of
beats and picked the one that 1 liked. 1 called Busta; he
was with it. I mean, Busta has always been bigging me up
for a while. And 1 have always been a Busta fan. Things
that Busta has done in recent history are ingenious to
me."
"Black On Both Sides" was originally intended to be
a double-album. Mos recorded more than 40 tracks for
the work but had to narrow it down to 17. The album as
a whole is a testament to the power of the word and the
power of the drum. Mos combines beats and rhymes to
examine the history, musical contributions and the pre
sent and future state of Blacks in America.
Songs such as "Mr. Nigga" focus a scrutinizing lense
on contemporary American society and the double stan
dards that exist for African-Americans and whites in the
year 2(XX). With so many people throwing the word
"nigga" around, this one should be a wake-up call.
Spiritual tracks such as "Fear Not Of Man" and
"Know That," with Talib Kweli, offer a refreshing out
look on some serious issues. The temporal nature of
things resonates in the repeated phrase, "Tomorrow


Abdul Alim — Daily
ain't promised to no one." "Mathematics," "Speed
Law" and "New World Water" are highly lyrical pieces
with clever wordplay. Further, "Ms. Fat Booty" brings
you right to the dance floor.
Mos revealed the meaning behind his new album's
title, "I came up with [the phrase] 'Black On Both Sides'
because it felt like I was working with both hemispheres
of my brain. And it was two sides of my personality. And
it was all black. And I didn't want to get into that space
where I knew that there were things that I was doing that
— it wasn't that they were untraditional — but they
weren't the type of things that the media and the indus
try are used to hearing from the black male perspec
tive."
Songs such as "Hip Hop" and "Rock 'N' Roll" touch
on these very issues. Mos represents Black music's con
temporary manifestation of what W. E. B. Du Bois
called the "push-pull" double consciousness in African-
American identity. Mos: "For so long, when we do art
like that, it's like you're not authentically Black, like
you're giving up some part of your cultural identity to
explore these other sides of music. And that's not true.
It's like you're alternative, you know. And it disengages
you from the community. And I'm not trying to do that
at all.
"What I'm trying to show to the [Black] community
is that we can do whatever we want," Mos said. "We
don't have to be defined as these little, one-dimensional
folks."
Somewhere in the distance, Umi and Abi are smiling.
Recently, Mos gathered several artists — including
Common, Kool G Rap and Pharoahe Monch — to ad
dress police brutality in a project called "Hip-Hop For
Respect." In addition, he and Black Star partner Talib
Kweli have recently taken over Brooklyn's oldest black
bookstore, N'Kiru, saving it from going out of business.
Despite his recent worldwide success, Mos remains

you're giving up some part of your cultural identity to
explore these other sides of music. And that's not true.
It's like you're alternative, you know. And it disengages
you from the community. And I'm not trying to do that
at all.
"What I'm trying to show to the [Black] community
is that we can do whatever we want," Mos said. "We
don't have to be defined as these little, one-dimensional
folks."

Recently, Mos gathered several artists — including
Common, Kool G Rap and Pharoahe Monch — to ad
dress police brutality in a project called "Hip-Hop For
Respect." In addition, he and Black Star partner Talib
Kweli have recently taken over Brooklyn's oldest black
bookstore, N'Kiru, saving it from going out of business.
Despite his recent worldwide success, Mos remains
humble and grounded with a belief that this success is all
a blessing.
"I just try to keep real people around me," Mos said.
"And I try to stay open to what's going on in the world
and say, 'I'm not that important.' There are people on
distant shores literally fighting for their freedom. Ready
to die. I'm a writer. I'm a poet. I try to tell the truth, what
I understand to be the truth. But I'm not that worthy of
attention."
