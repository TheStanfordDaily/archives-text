# Grad housing construction speeds ahead
## 
### Keith Ito Contributing writer 
Despite the past week's rainy
weather, construction on new grad
uate student housing in Eseondido
Village is proceeding as planned. A
total of 507 new single apartments
are scheduled to be completed over
the coming year; 272 will open at
the start of the 2()0()-01 academic
year, to be joined by an additional
235 at the start of winter quarter.
"We had such a long, protracted
dry period in November and De
cember that we're really ahead of
schedule." said Director of Student
I lousing Services Rodger Whitney.
"Unless we have an cnormouslv

rainy period tor the next two or
three months, we should finish on
schedule."
Whitney and Susan Rozakis
from the Office of Capital Planning
and Management indicated that
they anticipate the project will be
completed on time without budget
overruns. "The project is within the
approved budget at this time, and a
majority of the permits from the
County have already been issued."
Rozakis said.
The new units will help alleviate
a major housing shortage for grad
uate students, who have only one
year of guaranteed on-campus
housing and are faced with the ex
pensive May Area housing market.

This year, the housing lottery
left more than 1,000 graduate stu
dents who had requested on-cam
pus housing without it. In order to
meet some of this excess demand,
the University offered short-term
subsidies to approximately 600 stu
dents.
The subsidies allowed graduate
students to live off campus at cam
pus housing rates, which are often
35 to 40 percent below the market
rates of comparable accommoda
tions.
According to Graduate Student
Council Chair Kaleb Michaud, the
University has also tried to reduce
the housing shortage by "stuffing"
some on-campus apartments with

more students than they were de
signed to hold. For example.
Michaud said, the University has
often placed two students in a one
bedroom apartment.
Whitney indicated that in order
to support the new on-campus
apartments, some funds would be
diverted from off-campus subsi
dies.
"II the subsidies for off-campus
housing get dropped, we'll be in an
even worse condition than we are
now," Michaud said.
"There are currently 600 stu
dents in subsidized off-campus
housing. The new housing that's
being built will not be enough for
even these students to move on
campus."
All parties involved acknowl
edge that the 510 new units will not
fully meet the demand for housing.
"It's not going to completely meet
demand for graduate student hous
ing next fall, but it'll help put a dent
in the problem." said Whitney.
However. Michaud said he
hopes that il the University builds
the additional housing proposed in
the General Use Permit, the situa
tion will improve dramatically.
The General Use Permit, which
is currently awaiting approval from
Santa Clara County, includes plans
for the construction ol 1,900 addi
tional housing units for graduate
students.
Although residents in surround
ing communities have objected to
certain aspects of the proposal.
Whitney said he does not foresee
any problems involving student
housing.
"The county is supportive of
housing students on campus since it
takes pressure off of the housing
market." he said.

The new graduate student housing currently under construction in Escondido Village is the University's
attempt to address the major graduate housing crunch on campus.
