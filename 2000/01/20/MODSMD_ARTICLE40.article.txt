Borderline personality disorder is a men
tal illness "manifested by uncertainty about
self-image, sexual orientation, long-term
goals or career choice, type of friends or
lovers to have and which values to adopt."
When Susanna Kysen (Winona Ryder)

Based of the life of author Susanna Kysen, "Girl, Interrupted" is about finding
oneself when one is most lost: in a mental institution. Initially, it seems Susan
na's main goal should be to convince her doctors that she's recovering. The in
stitution has let out one of its least ready, so it appears that playing the game is more
important than actual progress. So says Lisa (Angelina Jolie), a diagnosed sociopath
to whom Susanna feels a special bond, in spite of an initial confrontation and Lisa's
overall bitchiness.
But playing the game won't be enough; Susanna must also realize she was ill to
begin with. And, she must make sense of her world inside her head in a place where
others seem so ready to condemn her as insane. Insane for not going to college. Insane
for being seduced by a teacher. Insane for downing a bottle of aspirin in one sitting.
She must realize that she didn't just "have a headache."

things and the bad guys often seem right, it's unclear for
much of the film exactly who's helping and who's hurt
ing, who's sane and who's insane.
In the process of discovering this, first Susanna's
view of reality shatters. Then the world that has re
placed that reality —that of the ward — also shatters,
leaving only herself and the remains. But her patholog
ically lying roommate's attachment to the "Wizard of
Oz" books and movie are appropriate to Susanna as

well; she doesn't want to go home for the same reason she doesn't want to stay:
"Everyone's nuts there."
The film takes an introspective and thought-provoking look at the young Susanna,
who later became the author of several books, including the best-seller the movie is
based upon.
Angelina Jolie is getting the bulk of the attention (and a Golden Globe nomina
tion) for her scene-stealing sociopath. However, Ryder — who once checked herself
into such an institution and lobbied heavily for the movie's creation — plays it just
right as the rebellious yet introverted girl in turmoil. In smaller roles as staff members,
the celebrated Whoopi Goldberg and Vanessa Redgrave fill their roles with the prop
er sternness necessary to see dozens of women through insanity.
The film gets points off for the ending, when dramatic events occur just in time for
the movie to have an unnecessarily clean ending. Otherwise, "Girl, Interrupted" is a
wonderful film, one which will entertain while setting the mind in motion, that same
mind which can inexplicably go awry and cause the illnesses portrayed in the film.
There is no distinct trigger of Susanna's mental illness — only exacerbators. And the
film shows that coming out of insanity can be as complex and uncertain as going in.
