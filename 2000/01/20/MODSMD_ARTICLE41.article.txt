# Sci-fi hasn't been much worse than 'Supernova'
## 
### 
An utterly cluttered sci-fi adventure, "Superno
va" makes you feel like you've lost brain matter.
A whole host of talent has been consumed in
side a recycled, boring movie with far-fetched ideas,
leaps of faith and a wasted $6()-million budget.
James Spader, who did a better job with the enjoyable
"Stargate," tries his best as recovering addict Nick Van
zant. Nick finds himself thrust into the unlikely situation
of captain once the original one gets squished alive upon
going into hyper-fast acceleration mode (or whatever it
was called).
His new best friend, Kaela Evers (Angela Bassett),
works with three others to locate the source of a distress
signal. You see, this spacecraft is a roving outer-space
ambulance. And stupidly enough, they allow a burning
spacecraft coming from an abandoned planet to dock

onto their vessel.
Gee, I wonder what
will happen next.
Robert Forester —
who revitalized his career
with "Jackie Brown" —
and Lou Diamond Phillips
made mistakes to sign on
as two of the poorly con-

structed crew members. Actually, the only decent per
formance to emerge is that of relative newcomer Peter
Facinelli ("Can't Hardly Wait") as Troy Larson. Troy
hops onboard courtesy of the burning spacecraft, and
soon things go awry.
The main problem is that all of the characters (save
for a select bunch) are set up as the killer's fodder. Actu

ally, the set-up is much better than the actual killing,
which feels like a methodical and anti-climactic way to
proceed through the action.
There was one line in particular that bothered me:
"What are you going to do? Shoot me?" Hasn't this been
in countless other movies? And that quote is just the start
of the bad dialogue between characters with poor timing
and chemistry.
Don't even bother with "Supernova." I think there
was something about ninth-dimensional matter that
might blow up the Earth in 51-plus years (since we don't
know exactly when this all takes place). But hopefully,
this movie's dire predictions will not have to fall on too
many unsuspecting ears.
