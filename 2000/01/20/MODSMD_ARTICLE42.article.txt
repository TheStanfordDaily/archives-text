## Let's hope there isn't another 'Friday' sequel

What were the two best things about the
original movie "Friday?" Easy: Chris
Tucker and the effortless comedy that
came from Ice Cube playing the laid-back charac
ter of Craig Jones. Unfortunately, "Next Friday"
is a different and much weaker movie than the
original.
Gone is Chris Tucker, whose absence is ex
plained in the movie by claims that he is in a drug

rehabilitation cen
ter. Ice Cube no
longer plays the in
nocent, jobless,
happy-go-lucky
character that en
joyed sitting on his
porch doing noth
ing in the midst of

South Central Los Angeles. Instead, his character
has decided to demonstrate how "hard" or un
touchable he has become. This is not the Craig we
enjoyed in "Friday," when he played the role of
the underdog.
The plot of the story begins when the local
bully, Deebo (Tom "Tiny" Lister Jr.), whom
Craig beat up so nobly in the first flick, has es
caped jail. Therefore, Craig's father (John With
erspoon, "The Wayans Brothers") wants him to
move to Rancho Cucamonga, where his Uncle
Elroy (Don "DC" Curry) lives, in order to stay
away from trouble.
One positive about this movie is that Wither
spoon is back as the comic dog catcher, running
into a number of hilarious situations that deal
with everything from burritos to dog poop.
Once Craig moves out with his Uncle Elroy,
who has won the lottery and has the money to live
in the suburbs, Craig proceeds to get his cousin

Day Day (Mike Epps) into trouble. Epps, acting
as the replacement of Tucker, fails miserably. He
is just not funny.
The problems begin for Craig when he gets a
notice delivered to his uncle that says his uncle has
not been paying taxes on the house. This money
needs to be paid in 24 hours, or the house will be
auctioned. Therefore, Craig spends the day look
ing for ways to find money.
Craig targets a bunch of Latino drug lords liv
ing across the street from his uncle. These Latinos
add a very comical twist to the movie, as they typ
ify the stereotype of the Los Angeles gangster.
Other funny moments include mishaps with
Day Day's car. Craig's cousin has a car that he
adores, but the girl he has impregnated repeated
ly finds ways to damage it.
Unfortunately, the suburban setting does not
fit Craig. Many aspects of the movie, such as Day
Day's character, seem forced. The best parts of
"Next Friday" are the carry-overs from the origi
nal, such as the father, Deebo and a strong sound
track.
People always say the sequel is rarely as good
as the original. "Next Friday" is just one more film
to add to that ever-growing list.
