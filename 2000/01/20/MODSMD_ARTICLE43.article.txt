Insider's guide for medical
students gets a passing grade
£ "Tk edical School Admissions," written by three
l\/1 recent graduates of medical school, advertis
-L ▼ A.es itself as "the insider's guide" for pre-med
students. It offers advice on virtually every topic of inter
est to a pre-med, andit is unique because the advice comes
from people who have recently been through the admis
sions process themselves.
A major theme of the book is that getting into medical

school is not an insur
mountable task, does
not require the stereo
typical pre-med "cut
throat" mentality and
is possible for nearly
anyone. They describe
the process of getting

into medical school as a formula to be followed, a game
played by specific rules. It's that simple.
Of course, most of the rules are the same advice pre
meds have been hearing from counselors for years: major
in something that excites you rather than arbitrarily
choosing biology; follow some basic rules to do well in
your classes, such as looking over old exams, highlighting
books and appealing to the professor if you think you de
serve more credit; maintain a variety of activities, not all
pre-med-related; prepare well in advance for the MCAT;
be meticuluous on your application; come prepared to the
interview; and write a meaningful and interesting essay.
"Medical School Admissions" also includes 50 actual
application essays from students admitted to top medical
schools. It describes this as "a major attraction" of the
book. It also offers sample interview questions, advice on
which MCAT study aids are best, and a discussion about
which medical schools are considered the best.
For a pre-med student, following the advice in this
book is essential, so if you have any doubts about your pre
paredness, you should consider reading it. It is very well
written and easy to read, and I was able to finish it in about
an hour.
However, most of the book should be old news to pre
medical students by now. A thorough browse in a book
store should be more than adequate to reinforce the years
of advising. Choosing an essay or two to read can give you
an idea of the range of things that can be written. After
copying down any names or addresses that it recom
mends, I suggest putting the book back on the shelf and
leaving the bookstore, confident and satisfied, with your
$14.95 still safe in your pocket.

Personal stories about Har
vard medical days ring true
At once personal and informative, Ellen
Lerner Rothman's book "White Coat: Be
coming a Doctor at Harvard Medical
School" tells the story of her journey through Har
vard Medical School. Beginning with the applica
tion process, she discusses the experience of being a
medical student, from her arrival at Harvard to sec
ond-year board exams, continuing onward through

White Coat:
Becoming a Doctor at
Harvard Medical School

it it it ir

hospital rotations
all the way to
graduation. In
clear and candid
language, she not
only explains the
events that define
medical school,

but also the emotions that those events evoke in her
and her classmates.
Drawing on the same curiosity that made "E.R."
a television favorite, "White Coat" has appeal that
reaches beyond the medical community. Despite
the complexity and unique vocabulary of the med
ical field, Rothman's writing is easily accessible, al
lowing everyone an insider's view.
More importantly, she holds nothing back, shar
ing all the strong emotions she faces. Becoming a
doctor forces one to confront many personal issues,
as one learns to accept responsibility for the health
of others. Rothman is unafraid to share all of these
feelings with the reader. Although she spends little
time directly discussing herself, by the end of the
book, we feel as if we know Rothman well.
Anyone considering attending medical school
should read this book as soon as possible. Too many
pre-medical students have little or no concept of
what medical school actually entails. "White Coat"
shows the sheer magnitude of the commitment re
quired for medical school and forces prospective
students to face the reality that lies ahead of them.
Completing medical school requires much more
than the ability to succeed in science classes. Be
coming a doctor is a lifelong process. Dr. Rothman
speculates, "I suspect I will never finish growing
into my role as doctor and caregiver."
By sharing the beginning of that growth process,
Rothman allows us to understand the breadth of
that lifelong commitment before deciding to make
it ourselves.
