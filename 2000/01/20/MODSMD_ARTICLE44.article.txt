## Fly to the moon and back for this breathtaking series of digitally enhanced lunar photos 
### 
Full Moon — Apollo Mission Photographs of the Lunar Landscape, a small but
significant compilation of lunar photography, was recently on display at the SF
MOM A. Compiled by photographer Michael Light, it is truly a milestone.
The public has only seen a small selection of more than 30,(XM) lunar photographs
stored in NASA's archives, and when displayed, all photos are low-quality duplicates.
The photos, originally shot by astronauts with square-format Hasselblads and giant au
tomatic orbital mapping cameras, were used for scientific and geological surveying.
It is interesting to note that the astronauts strapped the cameras to their chests and
therefore did not have the benefit of a viewfinder. Only when they returned to earth
would they actually see the results of their photography.
After four years of negotiations, Light was given permission to digitally scan the
fragile originals. This method of "direct digital photographic imaging" results in a
photo that is more of a clone than a duplicate. It gave Light increased flexibility and
precision, which is especially significant when dealing with the subtle shading differ
ences in black-and-white photos. It also allowed him to add some color contrast.
The photo exhibit consisted of three rooms and opened with a dramatic, spliced
panorama of James Irwin Seat, from the Apollo 15 mission, walking on Hadley Moun
tain. Passing into the first room, the focus was on photographs showing the moon and
earth from a distance, untouched by humanity. Covering one wall were color photos
of the earth taken from a variety of angles and times, from small slivers to full, global
shots. Looking closer, you could distinguish continents and compare weather patterns,
noting the months and years from the captions.
It's easy to lose your sense of depth and space as you stare into the apparently bot
tomless craters and across barren landscapes. One photo appears to capture a lunar
plain approximately the size of two football fields; reading the caption, I was amazed
to discover that I was looking at a space the size of Switzerland.
With each photo, it became easier to understand the correlation Michael Light
draws between the moon and western landscapes of the early 19(X)s. Not only is there
a similar sense of bareness, but also we, like audiences of the past, have no ability to
gauge the spaces we are looking at.
The second room catered to this lack of perspective. Light brought forward the as
tronauts. We see them doing their daily tasks: driving "rovers," performing solar-wind
composition experiments and using collection tongs or color contrast charts. We see
footprints and vehicle tracks, and the human figures and tools give the viewer a sense
of scale as well as a feeling of triumph. In this room lay the history of the Apollo mis
sions: the dates, ship numbers and names: Alan Sheppard, Michael Collins, William
Anders and many more.
But before leaving, there was one more room to inspect, a room that once again
humbled the viewer. Here, humans are mere specks in the magnitude of the lunar land
scape. I'hey are shown alone with nothing but space and a few footprints as company.
One especially striking shot shows the figure of an astronaut; in his facemask is the tiny
reflection of another member of his crew. The effect of this photo is startling, with the
reflection so tiny and the black void behind him endless. He seems too distant for in
teraction, the faceless sense of loneliness and timelessness finally complete.
Truly an extraordinary exhibit, "Full Moon" will now move to other galleries out
side the United States. However, Light's book "Full Moon" can still be purchased
through SI MOM A, and it contains all of the photos displayed in the exhibit.
