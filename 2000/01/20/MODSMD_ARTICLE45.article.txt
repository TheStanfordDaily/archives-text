hearted woman who continually attempts to find a lov

This book follows the photographer's adventures
from the Amazon to the Gulf Stream as the witty, dan
ger-prone Lucy barely escapes from harm's way numer
ous times. Whether she's fighting off a caiman attack or
surviving a dangerous overturn in high rapids, Lucy re
tains her humor and optimism that her next adventure

from her repression of her
abusive relationship with
her father. Never quite
trusting herself in matters
of love and romance, Lucy
falls into a dangerous pat-

tern of running away from her troubles and ignoring the
weaknesses she continues to reveal in her relationships
with men.
A fantastical encounter with Carlos Casteneda, a
real-life man associated with New Age mystical teach
ings, gives Lucy the courage and impetus to return to the
Rocky Mountains. Deep in the heart of Colorado, she
reconnects with nature and parts of herself she'd lost
sight of along the way.
At turns humorous and insightful, Houston's book is
nonetheless a trial to read. I kept wanting to throw the

hook aside for more coherent and less sensational story
lines, hut I felt obligated to see if Lucy would ever find
sanity and love.
Chronologically, the short stories seem randomly
thrown together until the end, paralleling Lucy's path
from chaos to clarity. While this structuring is unique
and metaphoric, I found it extremely hard to stay inter
ested in the complexity of Lucy's life.
One reader claimed that Houston "could write my
diary better than I can." Perhaps that's how this story
works best: a diary. I think Houston could have made
this a more powerful story if she had taken some distance
from her main character and turned fragmented diary
entries into a coherent and compelling novel about inti
macy and self-discovery.
