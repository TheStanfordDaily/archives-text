## What the hell is cuisine? Very Viet

We chose Kim's Vietnamese Restau
rant for this week's review because we
love the food, and we wanted to further
introduce the Stanford community to
one of the many dining choices found in
the cluster of shops and eateries on Cas
tro Street in Mountain View, just five
miles away from campus.
So we trekked south for dinner. Upon
taking a seat in one of the booths, the ini
tial service was not only prompt but also
insistent. We were asked three times —

resses — in the space of five minutes if
we were ready to order.
During the moments in between the
repeated requests to take our order, we
decided on a meal from the vegetarian
menu. We started off with an interesting
appetizer: fried shrimp and yam with

salad, wondering how they were going to
simulate the shrimp in the dish. The ap
petizer turned out to be slices of yam with
cubes of tofu — battered, fried and
served with a sweet-sour sauce — and a
side of lettuce and vegetables. Despite
being a fried dish, it wasn't too greasy, al
though it was a bit heavy as a starter.
For the main course, we chose lemon
grass chicken and pork hot pot. The
"chicken" was made with wheat gluten
that was slightly tough irtid dry, so the fla
vor easily outshined the texture — tasty
ginger and lemon grass.
But the clear star of the meal was the
hot pot. Also made out of some sort of
textured vegetable or grain substance,
the hot pot was prepared in such a way
that the "pork" absorbed the exquisite
seasonings and marinade all the way
through. Each bite was a savory sensa
tion. The extra sauce from the dish was a
great way to moisten up the accompany
ing side orders of rice.
A celebrated aspect of Kim's is the

lemon soda. They mix concentrated
lemon juice in a milkshake-type glass
with sugar and provide a can of club soda
to pour over the concoction.
Late in the meal, we were served soup
that was not the beef stick vermicelli we
initially ordered. We were disappointed
that the dish was not terribly interesting,
not so much that it was something totally
different from our order. We mean to try
out something new to give you, dear
reader, the benefit of our experience be
fore you venture into the wilderness of
cuisine. Sadly, vegetable and tofu soup
was something we've seen before.
So the final verdict is that we liked the
variety, some of which proved entirely
satisfying (we had to fight over the left
over hot pot for the next day's lunch; we
can show you the scars if you ask). Not all
the dishes are spectacular, and as with
any restaurant in the world, eat at your
own risk!
