SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) — Fire
broke out at a university dormitory early
Wednesday as hundreds slept, killing three
people, injuring 62 and sending terrified
students' crawling in pajamas through
smoke .into the freezing cold.
J Six Seton Hall University students were
critically burned. One of them suffered
third;tfcgree hums over most of his body.
the 640 residents of Boland
Hall iyefit back to sleep when they first
heard'tfie alarm about 4:30 a.m., thinking it
wtfs'aTTfither in a string of 18 false alarms
set off in the six-floor building since
September.
But many soon neard screams for help
arVd'smelled the smoke.
•. "I opened the door just to check."
Yatin Patel said. "All the ceiling tiles were
cpming down. 1 saw a ceiling tile fall on
someone."

"It was panic. Everybody was just, 'Go!
Go! Go!'" said Nicole McFarlane, 19. She
was treated for exposure because she left
her room in only a short nightgown, a jack
et and hiking boots.
The cause of the fire was under investi
gation.
The tragedy cast a pall of grief over the
campus of the Roman Catholic school 15
miles southwest of New York City. Classes
for the 10.(KM) students were canceled for
the week. A memorial service was planned
for later Wednesday. Sports events also
were postponed through Thursday.
"There's not much you can say at this
time." said Newark Archbishop Theodore
McCarrick, who came to offer support.
"We're glad we're people of faith. The
mystery of God's work is always a great
mystery."
Patel, who lives on the third floor down

the hall from the lounge where the blaze
broke out, said he put a wet towel under
his door, kicked out his window screens
and threw his mattresses on the ground in
case he had to jump.
At least two students did jump, witness
es said. Tim Van Wie, IS, of Flanders, said
a friend jumped from the third floor and
suffered a broken wrist and sprained
ankle. Others tied sheets together to climb
down from the windows, but firefighters
arrived and rescued them by ladder.
Keara Sauber, 18, saw one fellow stu
dent shivering in a T-shirt and boxers, his
skin completely blackened by burns. "His
skin was, like, smoking." she said.
Two of the three male students killed
were found in the lounge and the other
was found in a bedroom nearby.
The victims, all 18. were identified by
the Essex Countv medical examiner's

office as Frank S. Caltabilota, John N.
Giunta and Aaron C. Karol. Their home
towns were not released. Two firefighters
and two police officers were among those
hurt. The injuries ranged from exposure
and smoke inhalation to burns.
The blaze was largely confined to the
lounge. Students said they frequently saw
people smoking in the lounge, even
though it is prohibited in lounges and hall
ways.
Essex County Prosecutor Donald C.
Campolo said lie did not have any infor
mation about whether the fire was suspi
cious. He would not comment on whether
careless smoking may have caused the
blaze. The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco
and Firearms was assisting in the investi
gation.
"It will be a painstaking investigation,"
he said. "We are taking statements from

individuals who may have witnessed the
fire or the moments leading up to it."
The 48-year-old building was equipped
with smoke alarms and extinguishers but
did not have a sprinkler system because it
was built before they were required. Cam
polo said.
Fire hoses inside the building had been
disconnected because the equipment was
obsolete, Seton Hall spokeswoman Lisa
Grider said.
The smoke alarms and extinguishers
had passed inspection recently and at least
one extinguisher was used during the
blaze, Campolo said.
After the fire, soot-faced students lined
up in the student center to comfort each
other and call parents.
Three roommates on the ground floor
slept through the fire and were not hurt.
They woke up more than two hours later.
