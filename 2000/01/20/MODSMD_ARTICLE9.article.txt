# Clinton proposes new health care plan to Congress

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — On
• Wednesday President Bill Clinton
iunveiled a whopping $1 l()-billion
I package of health insurance initia
tives for his final year in office, ask
ing the Republican-dominated
to approve the largest
•;invesiment in health care since
; Medicare was created in 1965.
v Less expensive versions of the
programs died last year, in part
I-because of the president's own veto
'of tHe 4 'Republicans' $792-billion
i tax-cutting plan.
"These proposals are a signifi
cant 'investment in the health of
j Americans, another step toward
[ giving every American access to
[quality'health care," the president
i'said. About 44 million Americans
lack health insurance, and the pres
idents-proposal would cover about
»5 million of them.
The largest ingredients of Clin
ton's, plan are a $3,(K)() long-term
care tax credit, costing $28 billion
over .-ID years, and a $76-billion
• proposal to insure 4 million parents
[of children who receive health cov
erage -under Medicaid and the state
Children's Health Insurance Pro
' gram(CHIP).
Sensitive to the politics of a
: presidential campaign year, the
I president credited Vice President
j A 1 CiOre with helping shape the
{administration's plan. He said
| Gore and his Democratic rival, for-
Mner Sen. Bill Bradley, both have

proposed health programs more
extensive than his own.
"If you just look at what's going
on in the election season this year,
the public cares a lot about health
care and they're talking a lot about
it," Clinton said in an Oval Office
ceremony. "I am elated that health
care is an issue in the campaign."
The president would pay for his
program from the nation's huge
budget surplus.
Universal health insurance was
Clinton's signature issue in winning
the White House in 1992. The pro
gram died in a Democratic-ruled
Congress, prompting Clinton to
adopt an incremental approach of
expanding health insurance. The
president eventually signed initia
tives to allow workers to carry
insurance from job to job despite
health problems, and to provide
insurance for millions of children
under Medicaid and CHIP.
With the election year, health
care is a hot topic again. Republi
cans and Democrats alike are
drawing up bills dealing with long
term care, drugs bought via the
Internet, prescription drugs and
other initiatives. House and Senate
negotiators already are trying to
reconcile compromises on a
patients' bill of rights and expan
sion of coverage for the uninsured.
"I'm pleased to see the presi
dent joining the debate as we try to
find solutions to long-term care

needs," said Sen. Charles Grassley.
R-lowa, chairman of the Senate's
special committee on aging. Grass
ley has proposed several measures,
including tax deductions to encour
age people to buy long-term care
insurance.
To help low-income parents,
Clinton's program would create a
new "family care" portion of Med
icaid and CHIP programs that
insure needy children.
"It's hard to have healthy chil
dren without healthy parents," the
president said. "We know parents
who have access to health care
themselves are more likely to get
care for their children."
Further, he said the administra
tion would intensify efforts to
enroll more eligible children,
adding 4()0.(K)() children at a cost of
$5.5 billion over 10 years. More
than 2 million children are covered
now.
Another proposal would resur
rect Clinton's plan to allow work
ers as young as 55 buy into the
Medicare program. Congress
ignored the proposal last year. This
time, Clinton would make the pro
posal even more attractive for
workers — and more costly for the
government — by offering a 25-
percent tax credit for participants
in the Medicare buv-in.
The cost of the buy-in and cred
it over 10 years would be about
$5.4 billion.
