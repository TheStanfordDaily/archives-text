### Shannon M. Ashford Contributing writer 
Last night the Rev. Bernice
King, youngest daughter of Martin
Luther King, Jr., addressed a full
Kresge Auditorium as a part of the
closing festivities of the two-week
long Martin Luther King Jr. Millen
nium Celebration.
The program featured the inspi
rational music of the Stanford
Gospel Choir and the presentation
of the Martin Luther King, Jr.
poster and essay contest winners
After a brief introduction. King
began, "God truly intended me to
be at Stanford University tonight.
"All that I've gone through to
get here. 1 know that He has a les
son for me, or one for me to give
someone else."
King shared her life story with
the audience and the ways in which
death became a dominant motif in
her childhood.
She spoke not only of the assas
sination of her father when she was
5, but also of the death of an uncle,
her grandmother, two cousins and
her grandfather all v : 'hin a 10-year
time span.
"1 intend to share some of my
self with you tonight," King ex
plained. "I was on a downward spi
ral of destruction, one that almost
led me to suicide, but for the grace
of God."
After sharing aspects of her
childhood. King explained how the
anger she once harbored as a
teenager led her to God's love and
enabled her to empower herself.
Not only did King's speech focus
on the need for society to love God,
but she also emphasized society's
need to embrace an agape love,
which would enable people to love
each other unconditionally.
"Agape love is a love for all
mankind," King said. "It's what
drove Martin Luther King Jr.

Agape love undergirded his philos
ophy of nonviolence."
Aside from love. King also pin
pointed some problems in Ameri
can society as stemming from w hat
her father termed as "the three
evils — racism, poverty, violence."
She then expounded on her fa
ther's belief, saying "1 believe there
are three spirits which undergird
these three evils. They are materi
alism and greed; arrogance and elit
ism: and selfishness."
Dorothy Cotton, friend of the
King family and former Civil
Rights activist and song artist, at
tended the program.
"She did an excellent job." Cot
ton said. "She is excellent in the
analysis of the root causes of the
problems we face in society and she
points us in the direction for solving
the problem."
King ended with a story of two
worlds, one in which the inhabi
tants were dead and lifeless and the
other in which the inhabitants were
jubilant and progressive.
She then challenged the audi
ence to become a nation of people
similar to the people in the latter
world.
Also, she insisted that the differ
ence in the two worlds was the
depth of love the people had for
each other.
"Only if we get to a place in life
where what we do is not about us
and is about other people, can we
claim the words of my father
"free at last, free at last, thank God
Almighty we are free at last/ "
King said.
King also had lunch with about
50 students, faculty and staff yester
day at Ujamaa. There she answered
questions and became acquainted
with members of the community
before her address.
"1 think she spoke to the real
ncss of what King stood for." said
senior Jamal Watkins.

After the program. King held a
booksigning and senior Drue
Kataoka sold signed and unsigned
commemorative posters that she
designed lor the Martin Luther
King Millennium Celebration.
Today at noon in I'residder. the
Martin Luther King Jr. Millenium
Celebration will conclude with a
two-part series on the life and

works of Bayard Rustin, a gay civil
rights leader.
Contributions to the Martin
Luther King Jr. Millennium Schol
arship Fund, which is a fund for the
winners of the poster and essay
contests started by the Alpha Phi
Alpha fraternity Nu Sigma chapter,
can be made at the Stanford Feder
al Credit Union.
