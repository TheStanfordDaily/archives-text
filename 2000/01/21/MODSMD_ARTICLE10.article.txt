# Clinton attempts to accelerate talks between Israel and Palestine
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Presi
dent Bill Clinton tried Thursday to
pick up the pace of slow-moving
talks between Israel and the Pales
tinians, telling the two sides "no one
can get everything" in an accord.
Calling for compromise as he sat
down with Yasser Arafat in the
Oval Office, Clinton said he would
be disappointed if a settlement
were not reached. "We have the
leaders who can do it,"he said,
offering again to do whatever he
could to resolve their differences.
Arafat agreed there would be
difficulties "along the way," but he
said negotiations would deal with
them. He declined to say whether
he was willing to accept less than all
his demands.
With evident satisfaction. Arafat
said he had reached agreement with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
for Israel to transfer of another 6.1
percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinian Authority.
"Within two weeks, we will
receive the 6 percent," Arafat said.
"This is something Prime Minister
Barak and I agreed to 24 or 48
hours before arriving."
Arafat and Barak met outside
Tel Aviv on Monday to implement
Israel's commitment to turn over
the territory under a U.S.-brokered
agreement between the two leaders
in September.
It was not clear from Arafat's
remark whether the two sides had
resolved exactly what land Israel
would surrender.
After the meeting with Clinton,
the Palestinian leader said he had
asked for Clinton's help to assure
successful negotiations. "It was a
very fruitful and productive and
important meeting," Arafat said.
With Clinton's support, Barak
and Arafat last year set Feb. 13 as
the deadline for resolving their dis
putes over Palestinian statehood

aspirations and the future of
Jerusalem, at least to the extent that
Israel and the Palestinian Authority
could complete a framework
accord.
A final settlement, which also
would deal with refugees and other
issues, is due in the fall.
Clinton is trying to juggle slow
moving negotiations on the Israeli-
Palestinian front with sidetracked
peace talks between Israel and
Syria.
State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin said Syrian officials
would come to Washington next
week, to be followed by Israeli
experts, in an effort to deal with
some of the nagging issues on that
track.
Direct Israel-Syria talks were set
to resume Wednesday at Shepherd
stown, W.Va., but they were sus
pended indefinitely. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and other
U.S. officials have said each side

wanted its demands given immedi
ate priority.
Clinton said Wednesday he
would take on the task of nudging
Syria and Israel along, and that nei
ther side was giving up despite the
suspension of talks.
In Damascus, Syria's state-run
newspapers urged Washington to
push Israel harder to spell out its
intentions on returning the Golan
Heights.
Arafat had lunch Thursday with
Albright in her home before head
ing to the White House.
The Palestinian leader told
reporters the discussion with
Albright was "warm, positive and
beautiful." a description echoed by
the secretary. Neither gave any clue
to the substance of their meeting.
Arafat is seeking the 60 percent
of the West Bank that Israel still
controls, wants to establish a state
and be given part of Jerusalem as its
capital.

Barak and his ruling Labor Party
seem to be agreeable to having a
Palestinian state on their country's
border but have dealt ambiguously
with its scope and the Jerusalem
issue.
Rubin called for flexibility on
both sides, saying it was essential to
conclude an agreement.
"We don't think it is possible for
either side to get 100 percent."
Rubin said, declining to elaborate
on which issues the administration
would like to see concessions.
In a move apparently timed to
Arafat's visit, more than 300 Amer
ican rabbis advised Israel to share
sovereignty over Jerusalem with the
Palestinians.
In a statement issued by The
Jewish Peace Lobby, a private
group that for a decade his urged
Israel to make concessions, the rab
bis said many Israelis wouid favor a
eity that was smaller but more thor
oughly Jewish in population.
