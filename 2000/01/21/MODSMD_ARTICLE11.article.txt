# Visas obtained for Cuban boy's family
## 
### 
WASHING I ON (AP) — The
custody fight over Elian Gonzalez
took a new turn Thursday as the
grandmothers of the 6-year-old
obtained visas to travel to the
United States to make their case
that the boy should be returned to
his father in Cuba.
The U.S. diplomatic mission in
Cuba issued visas to the two
women Thursday afternoon as a
group from the National Council
of Churches was flying to I lavana
from New York to meet with them
and with Cuban government offi
cials.
They were expected to fly to
New York on Friday, apparently
escorted by the church group, and
Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel
of New York, who has offered to
accompany the boy to Cuba,
planned to meet with the two
women.
They hoped to return home
with Elian, according to congres
sional sources.
These sources said New York
was chosen as a destination
because the welcome there would
be far friendlier than in Miami,
where Elian has been living with
relatives for almost two months
and where sentiment for his
remaining in the United States is
strong.
Elian survived a shipwreck in
late November. The boat on which
he was heading for south Florida
capsized, killing his mother and
nine other would-be refugees.
The United States refused to
return Elian immediately to Cuba,
aggravating the already hostile
relationship between Washington
and Havana.
Roger Bernstein, one of the
lawyers retained by Elian's Miami
relatives, said the family is pleased
about the grandmothers' visit and
hopes Elian will get to see them.
He said their visit will not affect
the proceedings in federal court to

determine Elian's fate.
Attorneys for Lazaro Gonza
lez. the boy's great-uncle, went to
federal court Wednesday to chal
lenge the Immigration and Natu
ralization Service's ruling that
Elian must to be returned to his
father in Cuba.
The legal team filed a lawsuit
accusing the INS of violating
Elian's due-process rights and
asked the judge to prevent the
agency from returning the boy
before it gives him an asylum
hearing.
"It is about protecting Elian's
civil and constitutional rights, the
same as if he was any other child."
said Spencer Eig. a lawyer for the
great-uncle.
Many legal experts insist that
Elian's U.S. relatives have no legal
standing because their rights do
not trump those of his father, his
closest relative.
"All along, the legal issue has
been who speaks for a 6-year-old
boy. and the answer is the closest
surviving relative." said David
Abraham, an immigration law
professor at the University of
Miami. " That is the father."
On Thursday, the federal judge
in the case asked lawyers if they
preferred he step aside because of
his ties to both sides.
U.S. District Court Judge
James Lawrence King has a son
with political ties to Elian's Miami
relatives and a daughter who
works for the American govern
ment.
King said his son hired Arman
do Gutierrez, now working as
spokesman for those relatives, to
help in his re-election bid. King's
daughter is an assistant U.S. attor
ney in Miami.
Lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez
said they saw no reason for King
to recuse himself. U.S. Attorney
Tom Scott asked for a day to
respond.
