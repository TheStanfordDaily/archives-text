Athletic Department's decision to
cut number of seats for the Hand
is a shortsighted move

The Athletics Department's deci
sion to reduce the number of
seats given to the Band for this
weekend's men's basketball game at
UC-Berkeley is a unfortunate step that
seems to be part of a disturbing trend
of neglecting students.
The Band, which normally receives
30 seats for its annual trip to Berkeley,
was limited to 20 by the department
because of the high ticket demand
from alumni. Because the Band's
members feel they cannot perform as
well as they need to with these limited
numbers, they will not attend the
game.
Assistant Athletic Director Darrin
Nelson said, "The Athletics Depart
ment has supported the Band many
times, and to say that we were singling
them out for this game is absolutely
ridiculous."
Unfortunately, this is far from
ridiculous. The game at Berkeley was
the only Pacific 10 Conference road
trip that the Band was scheduled to
make for the men's team this year.
There's not much else to single them
out of.
There are those who believe that
the department shirked the Band in
order to please wealthy alumni, which
Nelson denied. Iliis brings lip two dis
turbing possibilities.
The first is that the department
didn't realize that the public would
perceive this move as sacrificing the
Band in order to please alumni. The
other is that the department realized
how it would look but decided to go
along with it anyway.
Either the Athletic Department
doesn't have the public relations savvy
enough to calculate the results of its
own moves, or it simply decided to sac
rifice its own image and upset the

Band and students in order to allay
alumni. Neither option is very attrac
tive.
And when considered alongside the
department's method of Rose Bowl
ticket distribution and its handling of
riot police during Big Game, this event
shows a gross oversight somewhere in
the department's decision-making pro
cess.
And there's something even more
disturbing. These three examples are
related to football and men's basket
ball, the two most high-profile college
sports. These are also sports that Stan
lord has had an especially good year in.
When times are thin for the team, the
University is more than accommodat
ing to its students. 'ITiat's how the Sixth
Man Club was born.
But now that these teams are suc
cessful, it seems the University would
rather deal with the "bigshots" than
continue to truly cater to the students.
Of course, the team suffers in this
also. With the Band no longer attend
ing the game, the Cardinal heads to the
most hostile territory it will enter all
season — this is Cal, remember? —
with very little support.
Even if the Band had decided to
make the trip with only 20 members,
the department should have seen that
its effectiveness would be greatly
reduced. Let's face it, alumni may be
supportive, but they are not nearly as
boisterous and loud as the Band and
students could be.
It's admirable for the University to
want to please its alumni. It's also good
business, and that's what college ath
letics has become. But the department
needs to begin taking students into
more serious consideration when mak
ing these decisions. Men's basketball at
Cal, Rose Bowl ticket distribution, the
second half of Big Game being
patrolled by riot police: all these show
a serious disregard for students.
After all, today's students are
tomorrow's alumni.
