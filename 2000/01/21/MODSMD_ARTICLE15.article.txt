# My obsessions are your possessions

Today I think I'll
return to a theme
that is becoming
repetitive in my column.
This faintly disgusts me,
hut it's the best I can do on
six hours of sleep at the
moment (which is another
story entirely and one that

1 feel safe in assuming no one wants to read
about).
The theme is that people in general and
people around here in particular do not
have enough honest passionate belief in
something. Of course it's a lie — there are
definitely people here who care very deeply
about certain things. Probably not as much
as starving peasants in Asia fighting in guer
rilla combat for the very survival of their
families — but really, who does.
My theory is that there are two types of
people in the world: those who care about
something and those who don't.
I fall into the latter category. For exam
ple, Little Cuban boys in Florida: I care very
little what country they end up in, especial
ly when there's only one of them. Of course,
if I were the boy's father or perhaps even his
aunt or uncle, I would probably care much
more. 1 lowever, it makes no difference to
me what they do with him, and 1 am amazed
that he has become the most consistent
news item in the United States for the last
two weeks or so.
The only other prominent issue in the

public forum (over the last weekend at
least) is the Confederate Hag. The one thing
I have to say about this is that the South
Carolina legislature has guts. It is definitely
an interesting decision to flv the flag of this
country's most dangerous enemy ever from
a state house.
Of course it's also an interesting decision
to burn an American flag, which a number
of people seem to want to do, so what can I
say? 1 guess everyone has a message to get
out there, and I guess South Carolina's mes
sage is. "F--k you too!" They apparently
care deeply about the glory of the South
and its ability to rise again and that sort of
thing.
Which brings me back to my point: that
some people care a lot about certain things,
and that those people in general tend to suc
ceed. Douglas Adams, one of the rare true
geniuses of the last quarter century put this
beautifully in one of his novels: "We're not
obsessed by anything, you see. And that's
the deciding factor. We can't win against
obsession. They care, we don't. They win."
Think about all of the great achieve
ments of man — they have all been born out
of obsession. Here's an example: consider
the guy at Princeton, Andrew Wiles, who
proved Fermat's last theorem in 1994. He
spent a good part of seven years in his attic
working on this with no one else knowing
what he was doing. That is dedication. That
is passion. And yes, some would even go so
far as to sav that is obsession.

The same thing is true in politics.
Because you can generally browbeat people
into anything it you put your mind to it. The
people that care the most usually get their
way eventually even if they have to hand
cuff themselves to a number of metal
objects to do it. People in general will tend
to care more about a good cause than an
evil one, and so everyone will end up mod
erately happy.
Of course there have been cracks in this
line of thinking. Like the Nazis being
obsessed with taking over the world or the
scientologists being obsessed with taking
over Los Angeles. But in general, obsession
is our friend. It orders a chaotic world in a
sort of narrow-minded way, which is the
only way it ever can be ordered. It gives us
something to care about and a reason to
live.
So my advice: ignore everything outside
of your own field of vision. Focus on one
narrow segment of existence and pretend
that nothing else matters outside of yourself
and your friends and your own petty ambi
tions, whatever they may be. That is the
path to the good life and to true self-knowl
edge. Happy trails.
