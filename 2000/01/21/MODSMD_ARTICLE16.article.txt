Daily editorial off-target on
Stanford Hospital move
Tuesday's Daily editorial, "Necessary
Changes?" reveals a basic misunderstand
ing of Medicare and Medicare.
HMOs. Medicare HMO patients no
longer covered a( Stanford I lospital can
continue to receive care from other partici
pating hospitals. Also, it is uncomplicated
lor a patient to revert to regular Medicare
coverage, which Stanford will continue to
accept.
Hv law all persons eligible for Medicare
are entitled to health care coverage as a fun
damental right. So it's hard to imagine
patients having to visit the emergency room
for routine medical care or forgoing treat

mcnt altogether. In addition, the Medical
Center is no more of a business than the
University. It is a separate legal entity for
accounting and other purposes, hut its aca
demic mission is clear. That mission will be
weakened by chronic financial losses.

County has a right to regu
late Stanford development
On Tuesday, Jan. 25, the County Board
of Supervisors will meet for what is hoped
to be the final stage of their decision on land
usage for Stanford University.
Stanford has argued that it has all the

rights of a private land owner. That argu
ment is correct. However, Stanford holds a
tax exempt status, and in return for that sta
tus it is obligated to provide some public
benefit. Sprawl is not a public benefit. Cer
tainly any further development should be
contained on the core campus northeast of
Junipero Serra permanently.
Under Stanford's current zoning (A-1,
Agricultural) Stanford has a right to build
farm residence and farm outbuilding on
each parcel, but no other rights. With the
passage of time and the generosity of the
county board, Stanford's development den
sity has grown and is currently 40 percent
greater than Palo Alto's. It will go to 50 per
cent greater by 2010 if Stanford is permitted
to develop as requested.

The Margeurite shuttle is a relatively
simple answer to a portion of the trans
portation problem created by Stanford's
population growth and was required by the
County, not volunteered by Stanford. It is a
County-required program carried out be
Stanford.
The Board of Supervisors needs to exer
cise its legitimate authority to limit Stan
ford's growth by creating a permanent
boundary along the full length of Junipero
Serra. Only open space should be allowed
southwest of Junipero Serra. The county's
right to regulate Stanford's development is
clear.
