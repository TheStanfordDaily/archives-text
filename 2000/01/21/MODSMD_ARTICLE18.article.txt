## Ducks on the pond for women's tennis 
### Bill Hanson Staff writer 
During the preseason, almost
every member of the Stanford wom
en's tennis squad produeed at least
one solid tournament run.
Unfortunately, while each player
has shone at one time or another in
the past few months, many players
have also suffered surprising early
round defeats.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
■ Today: No. 1 Stanford vs. Oregon.
1:30 p.m., Taube Familv Tennis Cen
ter.

The women's results have been
sporadic: occasionally brilliant, oc
casionally dismal, but rarely consis
tent.
I Will the Cardinal be able to
! achieve consistency in its first dual
match against Oregon today at the
Taube Family Tennis Stadium?
"1 think we're all a little anxious,"
said head coach Frank Brennan.
"I'm anxious, the players are anx
ious, everyone's anxious to get the
season started."
Each member of the young
squad approaches today's match
differently. Players who feel like
they're playing well simply want to
maintain or improve upon their
form. Players who are less confident
about their games, however, want to
get some matches under their belts
and gain confidence.
Freshman Laura Granville will
try to re-establish the dominance
she displayed in the fall.
In November. Granville swept

the Intercollegiate Tennis Associa
tion Regional Championships,
crushing California's No. 1 player.
Amy Jensen, in the semifinals. The
result bumped Granville to an im
pressive second in the national rank
ings.
However last weekend.
Granville was soundly beaten by
UCLA's Amanda Basica in the sec
ond round of the National Colle
giate Tennis Championships in
Sherwood Oaks, Calif.
Despite the loss, Granville
seemed confident about today's
match.
"It's my first dual match," she
said. "I just want to be consistent
and improve a little from the week
end."
Sophomore Lauren Kalvaria was
Granville's victim in the Regional
Championships final in November.
Although she wound up losing the
three-set marathon, her perfor
mance boosted her to 13th in the na
tional rankings.
Kalvaria suffered a three-set loss
to Washington's Kristina Kraszews
ki earlier this month in the third
round of the Pac-10 Women's Ten
nis Indoor Championships in Seat
tle, Wash., but she remains opti
mistic about the current state of her
game.
"Lauren is very serious right
now," Brennan said. "I feel very
confident about her performance
for the rest of the season."
Senior Teryn Ashley and sopho
more Keiko Tokuda also grabbed
headlines during the preseason.

Sophomore Lauren Kalvaria and the rest of the Stanford women's
tennis team are ready to kick off the the season in a Pac-10 matchup
with Oregon today.
Ashley, who saw her ranking
tumble to 75th after sitting out
several tournaments during the pre
season, has finally recovered from
tendinitis in her wrist and plans to
play a full schedule this season.
Ashley recently demonstrated
that she is again a top collegiate com
petitor after reaching the finals of
the Pac-10 Indoors, notching
straight-set wins over Arizona
State's Allison Bradshaw, Arizon
a's Lindsay Blau and California's
Claire Curran before falling to
Washington's Kristina Kraszewski
in the final.
Ashley, who has been ranked as
high as fourth in the nation and
boasts a 115-26 career match record.

hopes to end her collegiate career
with a bang.
"I think she's back." said head
coach Frank Brennan. "We have to
get her match toughness and her
game going again, but she's about
where she should be now."
Sophomore Marissa Irvin, who
finished last season ranked second in
the nation after reaching the finals of
the NCAA individual tournament,
has not seen any preseason colle
giate action.
Instead, Irvin has been playing
professional tournaments. She
turned in a strong performance at
the Australian Open this week,
falling to Lindsay Davenport, the
second-ranked player in the world,
in two, tight sets in the second
round.
Irvin will return to collegiate
competition in February.

Sophomore Gabriela Lastra is
still looking to regain her fine form
of last season. The talented Lastra,
who played No. 3 singles for the
squad last season and is currently
ranked fifteenth nationally, can pro
duce every shot in the book but is in
famous for becoming distracted on
the court.
She has yet to play up to her po
tential this year, but the season's first
dual match may be just the motiva
tion she needs.
Sophomore Keiko Tokuda. on
the other hand, is currently on a high
after reaching the semifinals of the
NCTC last weekend and plans to
carry her momentum into today's
match.
"I'm very excited about the first
match of the year." Tokuda said.
"Except for ( iranvillc. we have pret
ty much the same team as last year.

but I think we're playing at a higher
level now."
While it's hard to imagine a team
better than the one that captured the
IWJ NCAA team title. Brennan be
lieves that this year's team can be
even more dominant in 2000.
Before he can think about
NCAA titles, however, the team
must get past Oregon.
The Ducks, who haven't posed
much of a problem for the Cardinal
in the past, are led bv senior Alina
Wygonowska.
Both Brennan and the players
were looking forward to team
competition alter several months of
individual competition.
"It's a whole different deal,"
Brennan said. "You're playing for
Stanford, not for yourself. We want
to show that we're the No. 1 team in
the country."
