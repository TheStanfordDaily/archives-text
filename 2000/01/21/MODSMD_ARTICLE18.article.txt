## Ducks on the pond for women's tennis 
### Bill Hanson Staff writer 
During the preseason, almost
every member of the Stanford wom
en's tennis squad produeed at least
one solid tournament run.
Unfortunately, while each player
has shone at one time or another in
the past few months, many players
have also suffered surprising early
round defeats.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
■ Today: No. 1 Stanford vs. Oregon.
1:30 p.m., Taube Familv Tennis Cen
ter.

The women's results have been
sporadic: occasionally brilliant, oc
casionally dismal, but rarely consis
tent.
I Will the Cardinal be able to
! achieve consistency in its first dual
match against Oregon today at the
Taube Family Tennis Stadium?
"1 think we're all a little anxious,"
said head coach Frank Brennan.
"I'm anxious, the players are anx
ious, everyone's anxious to get the
season started."
Each member of the young
squad approaches today's match
differently. Players who feel like
they're playing well simply want to
maintain or improve upon their
form. Players who are less confident
about their games, however, want to
get some matches under their belts
and gain confidence.
Freshman Laura Granville will
try to re-establish the dominance
she displayed in the fall.
In November. Granville swept

the Intercollegiate Tennis Associa
tion Regional Championships,
crushing California's No. 1 player.
Amy Jensen, in the semifinals. The
result bumped Granville to an im
pressive second in the national rank
ings.
However last weekend.
Granville was soundly beaten by
UCLA's Amanda Basica in the sec
ond round of the National Colle
giate Tennis Championships in
Sherwood Oaks, Calif.
Despite the loss, Granville
seemed confident about today's
match.
"It's my first dual match," she
said. "I just want to be consistent
and improve a little from the week
end."
Sophomore Lauren Kalvaria was
Granville's victim in the Regional
Championships final in November.
Although she wound up losing the
three-set marathon, her perfor
mance boosted her to 13th in the na
tional rankings.
Kalvaria suffered a three-set loss
to Washington's Kristina Kraszews
ki earlier this month in the third
round of the Pac-10 Women's Ten
nis Indoor Championships in Seat
tle, Wash., but she remains opti
mistic about the current state of her
game.
"Lauren is very serious right
now," Brennan said. "I feel very
confident about her performance
for the rest of the season."
Senior Teryn Ashley and sopho
more Keiko Tokuda also grabbed
headlines during the preseason.
