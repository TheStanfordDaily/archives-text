## 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
A bear and four cubs.
That's what California (10-6, 1-3
Pacific 10 Conference) is this season
after losing scorer Geno Carlisle and
other veterans from a team that
played below its potential, but still
claimed the NIT championship to
end the 1999 season on a winning
note.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Tomorrow: No. 3 Stanford (14-1,
3-1 Pacific 10 Conference) at Cali
fornia (10-6. 1-3), 3 p.m. TV: ABC
Radio: KTCT (1050 AM), KZSU
(90.1 FM).

But when Scan Lampley, a junior
forward ranked third in the Pacific 10
Conference in both scoring and re
bounding. is the bear, and the cubs
are four talented freshmen adjusting
quickly to the rigors of conference
play, head coach Ben Braun does not
have too much to complain about.
Except perhaps playing a Stan
ford (14-1. 3-1) team tomorrow in
Berkeley that, despite losing four
starters of its own. is ranked third in
the nation and actually looks im
proved from the squad that took
home the Pac-1() title a year ago.
"They're a tough team to match
up against," Braun said. "You think
you can go down and knock their big
guvs off their game by putting a lot of
attention on them, and their three
point shooters step up. When you go
out and chase their three-point
shooters, the big guys step up. That's
a team that's very balanced."
On the other hand, the Bears rely
heavily on their main man — Lamp
ley. Against Oregon Jan. 13, he
turned in a career-high 2 l ) points. It
didn't matter much. The Ducks easi
ly sent the Bears away, winning by 15.
Still, Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery does not want to see an
encore performance from the 6-foot,
7-inch pounder. From all indications,

Montgomery will sick his "Mad
Dog " on Lampley, forcing the Bears'
best offensive player to take it to the
Cardinal's best interior defender, se
nior forward Mark Madsen.
"I do think Madsen, of all the peo
ple in the league that might he capa
ble of matching up well with Lamp
ley, has proven over the years that he
has the ability to do that." Mont
gomery said. "1 hope that that's
something that can happen for us he
cause I think Mark is capable of
[stopping Lampley]."
With the defensive challenge of
guarding Lampley bearing on his
mind. Madsen. who is not in top form
after missing seven weeks to a thigh
injury, might be able to relax a hit on
offense. In the last three games,
Madsen lias averaged less than five
points.
" He just needs to get reps and get
confidence in what he's doing and get
back to doing things over and over
that he knows he has to do to be suc
cessful," Montgomery said. "He just
hasn't had enough playing time, and
Mark's one of those guys that prac
tice makes perfect.-
While Cal is built around Lamp
lev, the Cardinal has thrived on its
balance. No Stanford player is in the
top-10 in the conference in scoring
and only center Jason Collins, tied
for 10th in the Pac-10. is in rebound
ing.
Instead, the Cardinal lead the
conference in a number of team cat
egories. especially defensive ones.
Stanford is No. 1 in scoring margin
( + l l ).7), made three-pointers (7.3).
opponents' scoring (57.3). oppo
nents' field goal percentage (32.6
percent), rebounding (42.3). re
hounding margin (+7.1) and blocked
shots (6.2).
Stanford is not always balanced
game-to-game, though. It seems that
during each contest someone differ
ent steps up to lead the team.
Last Saturday, that was junior for
ward Jarron Collins. His 19-point.
13-rebound evening was his fourth

double-double on the year. More im
portantly. his outside shooting
opened up the inside when Oregon
had begun to have success defensive
ly in the frontcourt.
In the past, a sound strategy
against the Cardinal was to play off
the high post, enabling more defend
ers to clog the low post. (Mlier Pac-10
coaches couldn't have been happy to
see Collins, already a strong inside
player, look so confident operating
on the perimeter.

"When Jarron is able to do what
lie did against Oregon and make
them pay for [giving him open shots],
then obviously it makes people re
think whether that's the way they
want to do it." Montgomery said. "If
you have all five players on the floor
that are capable of scoring, it does
change their decision-making."
One advantage Cal might have is
that, for the first time since 1997.


Daniel Sinton — Daily
Junior Mike McDonald drives down the lane for a layup against Ari
zona State. No. 3 Stanford faces the Bears tomorrow in another key
Pac-10 match up in the storied rivalry.
Stanford will be playing the Bears in
a facility on the Berkeley campus.
The new Haas Pavilion, which un
derwent a $57.5-million renovation
and name change from cozy 1 lar
mon Gym, should he considerably
more rowdy than the cavernous
New Arena that Cal used the past
two seasons.
"Cal has gotten a tremendous
boost from Harmon, playing in
there, because it is such a closed-in
venue," Montgomery said. "Any
body on their home court just feels
more comfortable. So now they're
back in their place, and 1 think that's
got to be a great advantage for
them."
But whether that boost will be
enough for the young Bears to over
come an experienced, battle-tested
Stanford squad that has already
proven it can handle the confer
ence's toughest teams and crowds is
another matter all together.
