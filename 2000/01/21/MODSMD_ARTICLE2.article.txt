# Children's health services to divide
## 
### Meredith Rowe Editorial staff 
One of the final straws holding
the UCSF-Stanford Health Care
merger together broke Wednes
day after negotiations to retain
joint operations of children's
health services failed.
The news was declared during a
meeting at the Laurel Heights
campus of UCSF and is the latest
in a series of events in the break
down of the UCSF-Stanford merg
er, which was ended by University
President Gerhard Casper last Oc
tober.
Despite the end of the UCSF-
Stanford merger, officials involved
with the medical center had re
tained hope that the partnership of
children's health services would
stay alive due to the ease with
which the two staffs had been able
to integrate their operations.
However, not everything con
tinued working as smoothly as
planned.
In an internal statement issued
over e-mail Tuesday to faculty,
staff and nurses, Haile Debas,
dean of Medicine and vice chan
cellor for medical affairs for
UCSF, and Eugene Bauer, dean of
the School of Medicine and vice
president for the Medical Center,
wrote that the failure of negotia
tions over children's health ser
vices was due to governance prob
lems.
"After several months of delib
eration about how Children's Ser
vices might possibly continue to
operate as an integrated venture
between UCSF and Stanford, we
have been unable to reach agree
ment on the details regarding how
such a venture would be structured

and governed.
"Children's Services at UCSF
and Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital will therefore separate
their operations at the same time
as the other programs of UCSF-
Stanford Health Care," the state
ment read.
Also at issue is the fate of a $500
million grant given to UCSF-Stan
ford to be used for children's
health care by the David and Lu
cile Packard Foundation and the
Lucile Packard Foundation for
Children's Health.
Dr. Larry Shapiro, chairman of
the UCSF pediatrics department,
said in a Thursday San Francisco
Chronicle article that he will meet
with representatives from each
foundation to decide what will
happen to the fund .
Janet Basu, who is involved
with the public affairs department
at UCSF, said she believed the fail
ure of jointly run child health ser
vices may have been the result of
the breakdown of the merger as a
whole.
"If you have part of [an opera
tion] merged and part of it non
merged, I think that's part of the
difficulty," she said. "What [the of
ficials] said was that they were hav
ing difficulty deciding how you
would govern and structure such a
venture."
UCSF and Stanford merged in
1997 to cope with cost-cutting in
the health care industry. However,
the merger resulted in huge finan
cial losses, including operating
costs of $86 million for Stanford.
In an October interview,
Casper said the merger failed be
cause of both financial pressure
