championships, and first step of the
journey leads to No. 2 Arizona (6-
1) and No. 18 Arizona State (3-1)
this weekend at deGuerre Pool.
The Cardinal is led by defending
100-butterfly national champion
Misty Hyman. a junior. She also
placed second in the 200-baek
stroke and 200-butterfly, while

displayed last year should propel
her to the title again this season.
