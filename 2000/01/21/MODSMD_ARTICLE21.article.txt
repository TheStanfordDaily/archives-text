## 
### Kellie Wiginton Contributing writer 
Pacific 10 Conference competi
tion begins today for the No. 2 Stan
ford men's swim team (2-2.0-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference). After a disap
pointing loss to No. 9 Michigan last
weekend, the Cardinal will have a
chance to redeem itself today when it
takes on No. 12 Arizona State (2-3.1-
1). and tomorrow when it hosts No. 3
Arizona (4-0.1-0).
Both the Sun Devils and the Wild
cats are coming off a two-week break
from competition. Arizona State last
competed on Jan. S. when it was de
feated by No. 11 Tennessee. During
preseason competition. Arizona
State defeated both UNI V and IJC -
San Diego convincingly.
Arizona, who is only two votes be
hind Stanford in the rankings, most
recently met up with ail-too familiar
Michigan. Arizona came out on top
by a convincing score of 174-126. An
other key win for the Wildcats also
came against UNI V in preseason
competition. 214 HO. However, they
lost to No. 6 USC.
"The team in general felt unprc

pared for the meet against Michi
gan." said Stanford junior All-Amer
ican Kob ( anales. We underesti
mated their abilities.

"We were no! reall\ in the raeing

"It was our first meet alter having
( hristmas break off."
Although no team likes to lose, a loss
often drives a team to work even
harder, which is the case for the C ar
dinal.
"()bviousl\. we don't want to lose,
but it can be a good experience."
("anales said. We won't make the
same mistakes again."
The ( ardinal will be looking to its
strong freestyle and butterfly swim
mers. such as junior All-Americans
Adam Mcssncrand Steven Hrown.to

lead the way against the strong
freestyle swimmers of Arizona and
Arizona State.
Arizona State freshman Ander
son Lvrbring is coming off a strong
performance against Tennessee,
where he won the 200-meter
freestyle.
Arizona has a great threat in se
nior Ryk Neethling. The 1999
NCAA Swimmer of the Year lived
up to the honor in the Wildcats' meet
against Michigan, taking first place in
the 200-meter freestyle, the 400-
meter freestyle and the 1500-meter
freestyle.
Wildcat freshman Jeff Dash will
be a strong competitor in the butter
fl\ events. He took first place in both
the 100-meter and 200-meter butter
llv against Michigan.
"Both of the Arizona schools are
very strong." Canales said. "Arizona
is strong in the freestyle events with
[Neethling|. But we think that Adam
Messner has a good chance of beating
him. and he's excited."
Though nonconference competi
tion is important. Pac-10 Conference
competition is what matters in quali
fying for the NCAA meet at the end.
