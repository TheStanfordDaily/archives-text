## Does he shock you, mademoiselle? CAMPUS PROFILE 
### Chris Crowell Contributing writer 
Jean-Marie Apostolides, profes
sor of French and drama, is only 56

years old. But he's been hard at
work writing his autobiography for
several years.
"The book will be published in
France this November. I can't say
much now, but I do promise that it
will be shocking and provocative."
Apostolides' efforts to unsettle
are not limited to his writing.
"Provocation is an integral part
of my pedagogical method. Univer

sities today more and more adhere
to dominant values, and much of
the blame belongs to teachers. Pos
itive criticism should be a part of
any intellectual's life."
What are the principal targets of
Apostolides' disapproval? Mar
riage, traditional gender roles, and
any other bourgeois constraints
that extinguish passion or stifle cre
ativity.
"1 do not play the role of dema
gogue agitating for rebellion. 1 am
an adult and 1 act my age, but I do
force my students to question their
own values."
Apostolides thinks that rebel
lion has gotten harder since he was
a student. "Today's leaders have
discarded the authoritarian stance
of my generation's parents. The pa
triarchal figure has been trans
formed into a benevolent older
brother, who is indulgent and infor
mal.
"The power structure is still in
place, but it is obscured. How can
one rebel against an older broth
er?"
Apostolides left France in 1%8,
and he describes his life since as one
of self-imposed exile. That choice
has been "difficult," but it has also
helped him construct a more pre
scient social critique.
"1 have a positive view of both
[France and the U.S.|, but I am out
sider in both cultures, and so 1 look
at things from a distance."
Apostolides first came to Stan
ford in 1979 after earning a Ph.D. in
anthropology from the University
of Montreal.
He also holds advanced degrees
in psychology from Sorbonne Uni
versity in Paris and in sociology
from Tours University.
He soon left to teach at Harvard,
but returned seven years later when
he was appointed Bonsall professor
of French and offered the chair of
the French and Italian department.
Apostolides is an authority on

17th-century French literature, and
he has published extensively on
subjects ranging from Tintin (the
French cartoon character) to the
Unabomber.
French Prof. Ralph Hester at
tests to the excellence of his col
league's work. "His studies . . .
make clear the scope of his scholar
ship and his ability to analyze and
interpret cultural phenomena
across a wide spectrum."
But the theater is Apostolides'
first love. He spent four years in a
French conservatory as a teenager.
He declined the chance to be a pro
fessional actor because he realized
that the vocation would likely mean
a choice between commercial the
ater and abject poverty. Neither op
tion was appealing.
Recently, he directed and pro
duced Harold Pinter's "The
Lover." The 1%3 play is about a
"young British couple whose life is
a conflict between the Puritanism of
Anglo-Saxon culture and their
inner sexuality."
Apostolides, without changing
the play's text, reinterpreted the
work to make it focus more on con
fused notions of gender identity.
That confusion, and the conse
quent destruction of the archetypal
male figure, is for Apostolides a key
aspect of modern American cul
ture.
Sophomore Daniel Moreau, a
former student of Apostolides,
thinks that the professor's knowl
edge of drama is what really sets him
apart. "He can recite an incredible
volume of verse on the spot. He re
ally is a Renaissance man of a dying
breed. Maybe the last of his kind."
So what can we expect next from
this Renaissance man?
Apostolides offers only a word
of advice. "Life is brief and it hap
pens only once. Be original and cre
ative in whatever path you choose."
For the rest, you'll have to read
