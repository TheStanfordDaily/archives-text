Just a little warning: some students have of late reported that
they have been receiving subscriptions of Time Magazine as a
result of signing up for credit card applications in White Plaza.
The subscriptions appear to be free for several weeks, and then
the magazine begins charging students without notification.
Cancellations of the subscriptions have been granted to stu
dents over the phone without charge â€” no questions asked. So
the next time you sign those forms to get free T-shirts, you might
want to take a look at what you're getting into.
