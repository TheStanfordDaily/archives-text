# A 						trip down memory lane with Farm's bowling team

The bowling team has come a
long way from its modest begin
nings.
Founded in October 19% by
Ward Bullard and eight of his fresh
men friends, the team now boasts
about 45 members, both men and
women. It all started when Bullard
decided that he wanted to be part of
a sports team like his tennis-playing
freshman roommate. He and his
friends decided to start the team
one night while watching Monday
Night Football. They filled out the
paperwork, and three days later
were on their way to compete in a
Southern California tournament.
As many students know, the
team is not known for its superior
bowling ability, but for its amusing
antics. Colleges everywhere have
heard of the Stanford Bowling
Team simply because the team re
fuses to take the traditional route in
competition. Often, the Stanford
Band plays at tournaments. Once,
the Stanford Tree bowled with the
team. As Bullard said, "being part
of the team has helped me to not
take myself too seriously."
What many people do not know
is that the team uses its popularity
and recognition for good causes.
Last year, the team put on a tourna
ment to benefit the National Center
for Missing and Exploited Children.
Various campus organizations
and residences entered teams of
bowlers for what turned out to be
more than just bowling: partici
pants wore elaborate costumes,
and the bowling team awarded
prizes for the most creative bowls.
This year, the bowling team has
formed an alliance with the Stan
ford Alumni Association to start a
program called "Born to Bowl."
with the goal of teaching children
how to bowl.
Team members say they hope to
involve the entire campus. Accord

ing to the team, the project should
take off later this quarter and pub
licity will be campus-wide.
Bullard emphasizes that pro
ceeds from the team's fundraising
events go to charity. The ASSIJ
does not fund the team, so the team
raises money to travel to tourna
ments throughout California, Ari
zona, Las Vegas and elsewhere. Al
though Nike sponsored the team
for a brief period, the team's only
current sponsor is the safety prod
uct company that Bullard's father
owns. The E.D. Bullard Company.
Although the bowling team does
not have its own bowling lanes or
provide scholarships as do teams at
other schools, some of its members
are accomplished bowlers. One stu
dent-athlete is Jose Chow from
Texas. In high school. Chow was a
state champion and has bowled
perfect 300 games in the past.
So what is the appeal of a bowl
ing team that doesn't win, especial
ly for those who have bowling tal
ent? Sophomore team member
Lindsay Hopkins said she likes "the
creative reputation that the team
has developed. We're one-of-a
kind."
Now that Bullard is a senior, he
plans to look back at his three years
as president of the team and at his
current position as captain and re
flect on his upcoming retirement
from collegiate bowling.
"I wasn't coming to Stanford to
be a bowler; I stumbled my way in,"
Bullard said. "I had always consid
ered myself a birthday party
bowler."
He now realizes that he has cre
ated a tradition of Stanford
bowlers, molding a group different
from any other Stanford sports
team.
"1 didn't join the bowling team
because the sport is a passion of
mine," said Hopkins. "I joined to
wear fancy shirts and to shake
things up a bit at tournaments."
