# Hey, check it out
## Examining library security methods 
### Zach Udko Editorial staff 
Call it one of Stanford's glaring
ironies: at the center of one of the
world's leading technological play
grounds, a student cannot exit
Green Library without an intrusive
hag search. With talk of a new poli
cy to check women's purses in addi
tion to standard book bags, the time
has come once again to question li
brary security methods.
"I think that they're going to the
extreme," complained junior Ellen
Choy. "Even if they check your
backpack and your purse, it's still
pretty easy to get books out of the li
brary. It's just a hassle for people
who don't steal in the first place."
Associate University Librarian
for Collections and Services Assun
ta Pisani said she understands stu
dent privacy concerns, but sees no
better alternative.
"I think students should know
that their bags are going to be in
spected. and if there's something
they don't want someone else tosee.
then they have the option to leave
their bags outside," Pisani said.
For roughly the past year, library
administrators have tossed around a
plan to implement a sensor system
that would replace the antiquated
manual searches. Cost has prevent
ed them from doing so.
"We have estimated that it
would cost an initial amount of
roughly $1 million to install a collec
tion security system," said Pisani.
"Of this amount, half of the expense
would be for Green Library, the
other half for the branch libraries."
Such a system operated in Meyer
Library before its collections were
transferred to Green. Meyer, how
ever, had a collection of approxi
mately 100,000 books, whereas
Green holds more than 2.5 million,
according to Pisani. Of these mil
lions of books, Green Library
Evening Supervisor Ben Martin es
timates that the library loses ap
proximately one percent of its col
lection annually. That's 25,000
books a year.
Martin, who used to work at
Meyer, was quick to point out the
limitations of a sensor system.
"The sensor targets placed in
Meyer's books were not fool-proof
either. For instance, if the book was
placed in a backpack lengthwise, the
gates couldn't detect it,"he said.
And how fool-proof are the
manual searches? According to a
walk-through test by this reporter,
not very. Six books of varying sizes
were placed in a bag and checked

through the portal monitors at
Green Library's two exits
The results? In both tests, all
books slipped through undetected.
The bag was simply unzipped —
not searched by the portal monitor.
Portal monitors are trained to
search every pocket of backpacks
and purses "within reason." accord
ing to Pisani. If they find a library
book in a bag, they are instructed to
open it and check for an appropriate
return date on the inside cover.
Are more thorough bag checks
the answer? Pisani says no.
"We do train the portal monitors
carefully, but there is also a degree
of respect that we like them to
show," said Pisani. "1 like to think of
[library patrons] as students and
scholars rather than thieves. And
we certainly don't want to turn into
a police station."
According to Pisani and Martin,
theft is not even the chief concern.
"We don't really believe that
there is malice involved if we find an
unchecked book in someone's bag."
said Pisani. "It's more of an issue of
a student inadvertently or acciden
tally taking books."
Students carrying unchecked
books are never punished. Accord
ing to Martin, portal employees sim
ply refer them to the loan desk — no
questions asked.
While some students say they
feel uneasy about showing their be
longings to portal monitors, others,
such as junior Joe Stone, differ in
opinion. "You shouldn't go into the
library with something in your bag
that you don't want them to see."
said Stone. "They are working to
stop books from leaving the library,
and that's the right thing to do."
And until the library decides to
spend the $1 million to install a sen
sor system, that's what they'll con
tinue to do. According to Martin,
the average replacement cost per
book is $75. The current annual loss
of 25,(HX) books amounts to roughly
$1,875 million per year — nearly
twice the amount it would take to in
stall sensors.
So why are the libraries waiting?
According to Pisani, they are
searching for a more sophisticated
system that can do more than just
ring when an unchecked book
leaves the library.
"We want a system that can lo
cate any book in the library at any
time in any place in the building.
And that costs millions. This is defi
nitely something we want to do. We
just don't know when." said Pisani.
