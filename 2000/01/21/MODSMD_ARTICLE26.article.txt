# Fac Sen forum debates pros, cons of IDPs
## 
### Eileen Chao Contributing writer 
The legitimacy of Stanford's Inter
disciplinary Programs came under
scrutiny during yesterday's 1 acuity
Senate meeting.
Faculty convened to discuss con
cerns of IDPs and also the role of the
ad hoc Advisory Committee on In
terdepartmental Programs, a com
mittee formed to review the status of
IDPs in Stanford.
Main issues of concern about the
program were the sufficiency of its
funding, the availability of staffing
and the overall efficiency of IDPs in
conjunction with the school's main
departments.
No decisions were made, but the
sole purpose of the discussion was to
"solicit faculty views about IDPs." ac
cording to Geophysics Prof. Mark
Zoback, chair of the senate.
The forum opened with three
main speakers: Human Biology
Chair Russ Fernald. 1 lumanities and
Sciences Associate Dean Russell
Berman, also part of the ad hoc com
mittee. and Phyllis Gardner, part of
the graduate Interdepartmental Pro
gram of Neuroscienee.
Fernald spoke first on the behalf

of the IS undergraduate IDPs. Ac
cording to him. 25 to 35 percent of un
dergraduate degrees are from the In
terdepartmental Programs, including
Human Biology and Symbolic Sys
tems.
"These programs were created for
one purpose," he said, "teaching top
ics that lie inside of several different
departments. They are usually char
acterized by innovative and creative
curriculum design."
Backed with a review by respons
es he received from a questionnaire
sent out to an I DP. Fernald stated
that IDPs were serving the needs of
undergraduates.
Fernald also contrasted the in
creasing enrollment of the Human
Biology Department with the rela
tively unchanging amount of funding
throughout the years.
"IDPs are flourishing in a rather
tough environment," Fernald said.
Berman spoke of concerns of the
Interdepartmental Program. Critics
worry about the program draining
faculty recourses.
" There is no doubt that IDPs at
tract a great number of students,"
Berman said. "But is that sort of
teaching necessary to be outside of
departments?"

According to Berman, by saying
that IDPs offer innovative education,
the implication is that innovations are
not taking place in existing depart
ments. Perhaps there is a way for the
departments to learn the creative
methods of IDPs and integrate them
into their curriculum, he said.
"If the only reason we have IDPs
is that this is the way we've done busi
ness thus far, then we really need to
think it through," Berman said.
Gardner represented the gradu
ate IDPs and again cited their impor
tance to the graduate programs.
Much of the response from the
floor was in advocacy of the interde
partmental programs.
"I DPs give opportunities to create
a foci of interdepartmental study that
we wouldn't expect to see in depart
ments," said Craig Heifer, professor
of Biological Sciences. "It's unlikely
for a department [such as Biological
Sciences] to move fast enough or
have enough recourses to create an
interdisciplinary curriculum to con
nect with the social sciences."
Other members of the senate
voiced approval of IDPs, but encour
aged ways to improve the program.
"Maybe IDPs [are so prevalent)
because departments have outlived

their usefulness," said Psychology
Prof. Hazel Markus.
Some faculty agreed that the Uni
versity must strengthen the infra
structure of the program, to develop
better ways of gaining income for
courses and monitoring students.
Several faculty members ex
pressed concern over the subjectivity
of the questions that the advisory
committee on Interdepartmental
programs are supposed to focus on in
evaluating the IDPs.
"I don't think it is a fair list of ques
tions," said Statistics Prof. Brad
Efron. "Since it represents the
groundwork on which the ad hoc
committee works, we should serious
ly consider [the objectivity of it]."
Biological Sciences Prof. Robert
Simoni said that every program
should have its own criteria to be
judged upon.
The meeting closed with advisory
committee member Robert Polhe
mus, an English professor, assuring
that the committee would focus on
the topics including, but not limited
to, the ones on the list of questions.
"We've only met once," Polhemus
said. "And the tone of the meeting
was not adversarial. We are not ad
versarial."
