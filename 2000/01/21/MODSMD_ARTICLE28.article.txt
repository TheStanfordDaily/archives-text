## 
### Jess Dang Contributing writer 
Sister Helen Prejean, author of
"Dead Man Walking." spoke last
night at Memorial Church, sharing
her thoughts on the practice of the
death penalty.
Prejean was invited by the
Catholic Community at Stanford as
part of a lecture series that brings in
well-known speakers to share their
experiences with the Stanford com
munity. Prejean discussed the events
that led her to write "Dead Man
Walking," a book later made into a
movie.
Last night's speech was well-at
tended by students as well as many
people from the community who
heard about it through church an
nouncements.
Prejean drew in a crowd of some
that were ambivalent about their po
sition on the death penalty.
Sue Marrion, a participant in the
Leadership of Ministry at the Dio
cese of San Jose, said, "though my
faith dictates that the death penalty is
morally wrong, I still don't feel com
pletely against the practice of it."
Marrion said she hoped Prejean
would provide her with a broader
view of the death penalty,
Chris Maloney, a sophomore,
heard about Prejean's visit through
church. After reading the book and
watching the movie, Maloney want
ed "to hear Prejean personally ex
pand on the perspectives she gained
from her experiences."
Prejean's book "Dead Man Walk
ing" was a result of her work with
death row inmates. The book was
published by Random I louse in 1993.
Prejean said the book was a result
of a letter she wrote to a death row
inmate. This letter, said Prejean,

would be a "passport to a whole new
world."
After the exchange of many let
ters, the inmate asked Prejean to be
his spiritual advisor. Prejean agreed
though she did not know what that
role entailed at the time.
It was not until she met the inmate
that she realized she would accom
pany him in his execution.
Watching the execution. Prejean
said her "views on the death penalty
became real."
Today Prejean travels around to
churches, rotary groups and schools
to preach her experiences on the
death penalty, encouraging all to find
an alternative form of punishment.
Prejean said her humanitarian
work has shown her the "back of the
tapestry of the great American
dream."
"The death penalty is all about
who gets killed and who was
wronged," Prejean said. "Essentially
the death penalty is a matter of race.
"No one cares when the little
black girl is raped and killed in cold
blood. But when the white surbur
ban housewife is killed, then it's a
matter of concern, a matter for the
death penalty.
"The death penalty is about race
and politics. While hundreds of
countries around the world are tak
ing a stand against the death penalty,
the United States sadly continues to
kill their own people," said Prejean.
"She made the concept real and
human to me. It was no longer a dis
tant concern but a great concern of
the right to live," said freshman
Bryan Stephens at the conclusion of
Prejean's speech.
Prejean ended her talk by encour
aging all to sign a petition to "take a
stand against the murder of all hu
mans."
