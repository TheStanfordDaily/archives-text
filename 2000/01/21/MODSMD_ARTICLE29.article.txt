# No. 12 Stanford on Bruin hunt
## 
### Meghan O'Connor Staff writer 
Tomorrow night the No. 12
men's volleyball team will have a
chance to redeem itself after a dis
appointing loss to No. S Brigham
Young on Wednesday night.
But redemption may be easier
said than done.
The Cardinal (4-1.2-1 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) hosts No.
1 UCLA (3-0.0-0 MPSF). UCLA's
near-flawless performance so far
this season and Stanford's struggle
in the BYU game will put the pres
sure on the Cardinal tomorrow
night.
"Saturday's game gives us the
opportunity against a tough oppo
nent to get back to playing the way
we want to play." said head coach
Ruben Nieves ."We want to be ag
gressive, confident and play with a
high level of execution. We want to
play well and see where the chips
fall from there."
Over the past three years, the
two teams have traded the spotlight
when going head to head.
Last season. Stanford fell in
three games, but in 1998. the Cardi
nal dominated the Bruins and came
away with a three-game win over
the eventual NCAA champions.
In 1997, Stanford went 2-1 in
matches with UCLA, including the
NCAA championship match.
In this year's preseason
matchup, UCLA beat Stanford in
three games.
"We need to play our game,"
sophomore outside hitter Marcus
Skacel said of Saturday's chance tor
revenge. "We got killed in the fall,
but we're a much better team now.
We're the underdogs but if we play
hard and with a lot of heart, we'll
beat them."
The Cardinal will face three re

turning starters from last year's
squad, which finished third in the
mountain division of the MPSF with
a 20-7. 14-5 MPSF season record.

MEW'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Tomorrow: No. 12 Stanford(4-1.2-
1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) vs. No. I UCLA (3-0, 0-0), 7
p.m.. Maples Pavilion.

Three time Ail-American setter,
senior Brandon Taliaferro returns
for UCLA.
Taliaferro is fresh from a sum
mer tour in Spain with the World
University Games Team, coached
by Bruins' head coach Al Scates.
Another strong returnee for
UCLA is junior outside hitter Mark
Williams, who led the team with 231
digs and was named second team
All-MPSF last year.
After his season with the Bruins,
Williams will he playing on the Aus
tralian Olympic Team for the 2000
Olympic Games in Sydney.
The Bruins, who started off the
season ranked seventh, quickly
moved up to the top slot after a
dominating performance at the
Wyndham Garden West Coast
Challenge two weeks ago.
The team upset then No. 1 Long
Beach State in a tight 3-2 match.
The Bruins then went on to sim
ply dominate two other nationally -
ranked teams No. 14 Pacific and No.
12 UC-Irvinc. without dropping a
game.
"It's a feather in your cap to do
well against UCLA." Nieves said.
"They are the dominant team in our
sport. It's exciting to he playing
strong teams, but when you get ex
cited. you still have to focus and ex
ecute and that's one of the biggest
challenges."


Josh Haner — Daily
Outside hitter Marcus Skacel crushes another spike. No. 12 Stanford
has a tall order as the No.l Bruins come to Maples Pavilion tonight.
To battle the quick attack and
high level of play that UCLA will
bring to Maples tomorrow night,
Nieves is looking for a whole team

effort.
"One positive from our defeat
[to BYU], is that it reminds the
coach to look at all 11 players and
look for ways they can be incorpo
rated more. We have some good
players that haven't gotten to play a
lot," Nieves said noting the strong

play of outside hitters junior Curtis
Graham and freshman William
Curtis.
"We have a real opportunity to
keep progressing as a team," Nieves
said. "I think this team believes that
if we play up to our ability we can
compete with anybody."
