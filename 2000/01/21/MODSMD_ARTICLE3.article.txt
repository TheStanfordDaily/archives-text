# Course guide delay prompts dissatisfaction
## 
### Melissa Lambert Contributing writer 
In the first two weeks of this quar
ter, junior Anubha Kothari received
e-mails from both students and pro
fessors asking why the ASSU Online
Course Guide Web site was not yet
updated. She responded to each of
the students who contacted her.
going through the database manually
and sending them the class evalua
tions of the courses they were inter
ested in.
Due to computer difficulties at the
beginning of the quarter, the updated
version of the online course guide
featuring student evaluations of win
ter quarter classes was not available
until after the shopping period for
classes had ended.
Several students and professors
expressed dissatisfaction with the
delay, including Psychology Prof.
Russell Fernald.
"The course guide can be a useful
part of the information students use
to decide on their courses so having it
in a timely manner is essential," Fer
nald said.
Although many felt the delay was
unfortunate, "the fact that it is there
at all is pretty convenient. I like to
look at all the student comments —
they are pretty funny sometimes." ju
nior Philip Lipscy said.
The course guide project manag
er, Kothari is almost single-handedly
spearheading course guide updating
efforts. She insists that no one party is
to blame for the delay this quarter
and said the problem stems from the
Registrar's Office not being aware

that the ASSU needed the time
schedule information in a certain
computer format. The ASSII
promisesa timely update of its course
guide for spring quarter.
Because they didn't receive the
data in a usable format, she said, it
took much longer to update the
course guide Web site.
A 24-page paper course guide was
first available in the spring of 1998,
but it only contained quantitative
data from student evaluations.
In September of 1998. however,
the course guide went online and a
limited number of student comments
from class evaluations were also
made available. In the fall of this
year, the ASSU launched a new on
line course guide with more com
ments and information than in previ
ous years.
Senior Elizabeth Erickson looked
at the guide at that time, but said the
statistics available "didn't really help
[her] too much." She hasn't looked at
the site since.
Kothari credits the delay this
quarter largely to the newness of the
guide. She said problems came up
"because of the lack of past structure
in setting up standards for us to re
ceive data from the Registrar's [Of
fice |."
ASSU Vice President John Mills,
a doctoral student in genetics, said
some students commented to him
that since the ASSU had data avail
able from last year's winter quarter
course offerings, they should have
simply updated their site with that in
formation so they could "have a
product out there in time to be useful
for the shopping period."
Mills said, however, "Since course
offerings experience some fliictna
tion from year to year, and since
classes are not always scheduled at
the same times and in the same rooms
from year to year, we felt that provid
ing students with last year's data
would have merely created a great
deal of confusion."

In addition Mills said, "We still re
ceived several hundred unique hits
on our site following the addition of
the updated winter quarter data, de
spite the fact that the data was not
available until after the shopping pe
riod."
To solve the problem permanent
ly. Kothari is currently studying the
Registrar Office's database system
and explaining to them the format in
which the ASSIJ needs the informa
tion. She is confident that the spring
quarter class evaluations will be on
line by the time spring classes begin, if
not earlier.

Computer glitches are not the
only problem with the course guide.
Kothari said many Stanford students
just don't seem to know about it. She
was not aware of it herself until she
started working on it in the fall of this
year, but said she hopes to further
publicize the course guide so more
students can take advantage of it.
When choosing his classes fall
quarter, Lipscy read the student eval
uations in the online course guide
about each class he was considering.
Although he said the data didn't in
fluence him to take any classes he
wasn't already considering, it did help

him eliminate a few classes because,
as he said, "I assumed that the profes
sors who had really bad marks were
probably bad."
Lipscy said the comments helped
him more than the ratings — he said
the numerical data only helped him if
a professor had received an extreme
ly bad or an extremely good rating.
Kothari is currently working on
adding features where students can
search the course guide for classes
that meet general education require
ments or that meet at certain times.
She hopes to have these new search
tools available in the spring.
