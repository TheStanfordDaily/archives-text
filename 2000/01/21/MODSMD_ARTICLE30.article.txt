One game.
All she needed was one game and
the second set was hers.
On Wednesday, Stanford sopho
more Marissa Irvin found out that
taking a set from one of the world's
top tennis players is not an easy task,
even with a 5-2 lead.
Irvin. who finished last season as
the nation's second-ranked collegiate
player, has been making headlines
this week for her performance at the
Australian Open in Melbourne, the
first Grand Slam of the 2(XX) profes
sional tennis season.
Irvin marched through the quali
fying draw and then upset 35th
ranked Corina Morariu in the first
round. 2-6.6-3,7-5.
In the second round, Irvin faced

Lindsay Davenport, the 1999 Wim
bledon champion and second-ranked
player in the world.
While she lost, Irvin turned in a
performance that had television com
mentators Pam Shriver and Mary Joe
Fernandez singing her praises and en
thusiastically discussing her potential.
Irvin s roommate, sophomore
Con ine Yates, watched the match on
television with several of 1 rvin's other
friends.
"Marissa is my roommate of two
years," Yates said. "We watched the
match on F.SPN with the majority of
people from our dorm. We're throw
ing her a party."
"Hie first set was close as a deter
mined Irvin doggedly retrieved the 6
-foot, 3-inch Davenport's penetrating
groundstrokes.
Irvin produced exceptional defen
sive play, forcing a frustratedDaven

port into committing several errors.
A break of serve in the ninth
game, however, gave Davenport a 5-
4 lead, and she held serve to close out
the set, 6-4.
Irvin was not discouraged. In the
second set. she began to play
more aggressively, giving Davenport
a dose of her own medicine with a se
ries of flat groundstroke winners.
Although Irvin mounted a 5-2
lead. Davenport called on her profes
sional experience and promptly
turned the match around.
As Irvin struggled with her first
serve, she watched Davenport slap
second serve returns into the corners
to even the score at 5-all, and she
knew her chances were dissipating.
Davenport soon closed out the 6-4,7-
5 decision with an emphatic over
head.
Nonetheless, Irvin is happy with

her Australian Open run.
She entered the tournament as the
world's highest-ranked amateur, hav
ing posted impressive results in nu
merous small professional tourna
ments during the fall.
Irvin's results in Melbourne will
likely help her break into the world's
top 1 (X). Moreover, her performance
proved that she has the game to chal
lenge the world's top players.
"I am so proud of Marissa," Yates
said. "She's still an amateur and she's
not only playing one of the best pro
fessional players in the
world, but she's holding her own very
well. Lindsay Davenport has a lot of
professional experience over Maris
sa, but Marissa still shook her up
quite a bit. By the slats, you'd expect
the match to be a blow-out, but
Marissa didn't get intimidated like
vou would think she would."
