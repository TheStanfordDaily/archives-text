The Center for Slavic and Hast
European Studies organized a panel
discussion, "Elections in Russia, the
Post-Yeltsin Era," yesterday after
noon to discuss recent political de
velopments in Russia.
The speakers focused primarily
on this past December's Duma elec
tions, Yeltsin's New Year's Eve res
ignation and a forecast of the March
presidential elections.
John Dunlop. a senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution and author of
numerous books and articles, the
most recent of which is his 199S book
"Russia Confronts Chechnya." was
the first of the two keynote speakers.
Dunlop outlined December's
events, most notably Yeltsin's resig
nation and the appointment of
Vladimir Putin as the president
elect.
Also, Dunlop discussed the prob

lems with Russia's current method
of elections, citing one newspaper
article stating that Russia's idea of
democratic elections is that an elec
torate chooses one president, and
then that president picks a successor.
"Yeltsin simply demonstrated
how democracy still is not working in
Russia." he said.
Due to the Russian election
process, the public will not know
who Putin's competitors in the elec
tion will he until 34 days before the
March 26 election.
Dunlop said the combination of
Yeltsin's strategic resignation, which
greatly enhanced Putin's chances of
election, and Russia's undemocratic
electoral methods has made it so that
"right now it looks like a Putin victo
ry."
Michael Urban, a UC-Santa Cruz
professor, has written most recently
a IW7 book, "The Rebirth of Poli
tics in Russia," and articles on Russ-

ian national and state identity.
Urban described the illusion of
democracy in Russia, saying that
Russia is "moving toward an author
itarian regime, and Putin is the key
figure in this movement."
Urban and Dunlop agreed that
they both view Russia's future with
concern and misgivings.
"The elections look like an or
chestrated selection instead of a so
ciety choosing its leader," Urban
said. He continued by explaining the
Russian media's completely biased
and one-sided presentations of the
candidates: four years ago by back
ing Yeltsin and presently by skewing
the news in favor of Putin's party.
After a detailed discussion of the
lack of democratic procedure in
elections, Urban, too, concluded.
"This notion of a reformist Duma
has been shown to be wishful think
ing ... the next president of Russia is
Putin."

Attendees of the discussion were
predominantly enthusiastic with
how the event proceeded.
"I don't think there exists a panel
that could ever really answer these
questions, but it was a pretty open
and clear discussion of the issues,"
said Vadim Rubin, a researcher at
the Center for International Security
and Cooperation at Stanford.
Alex Dallin, a former Stanford
political science professor, said that
the speeches did not put forth a com
pletely balanced spectrum of views
of the issue, especially in a broader
perspective of American policy in re
lation to the developments in Russia.
However, Dallin said, "the
speakers made a very competent de
scription of the issues. If a member
of the Russian consulate had been
present, there would have been a
much more even presentation, but
for the announced topic, it was a very
clear discussion."
