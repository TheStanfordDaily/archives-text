# Dominant ruggers look toward Tritons
## 
### Jon Cohen Contributing writer 
This Saturday, when the Stan
ford men's rugby team (3-0, 1-0 Pa
cific Coast League) travels down
state to take on UC-San Diego, it
will be facing a squad competing in
its first year of Division I rugby.
Despite the Titans' relative inex
perience against higher level com
petition, and despite the fact that
UCSD is known more for its top
notch medical school and unbeat
able surfing conditions than its ath
letic programs, this weekend's con
test will hardly be a pushover for the
Cardinal.
The previous two seasons have
seen the Tritons run away with the
Division II national championship,
and it has not fared too poorly with
Division I opponents either. Two
years ago, UCSD defeated a Stan
ford club that went on to finish sec
ond in the nation.
However, tomorrow, the Titans
will face a Stanford team hungry for
redemption and playing its best
rugby of the season.
Last Saturday's game was in
many ways a breakthrough for the
Cardinal. After two lackluster victo
ries over Santa Clara and Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo the previous week
end in sloppily games, the squad
played with excellent fluidity and
unquestionable intensity in pound
ing St. Mary's 55-8.
"The team was ready," said head

coach Franck Boivert. "They start
ed very, very fast and killed the spir
it of St. Mary's."
"It was definitely the best game
we've played all year," said senior
captain Mike Ceballos. "For the
first time we were all on the same
page."
Also on Stanford's schedule this
weekend is a Sunday match up with
Iresno State. In this game, the Car
dinal's second team (which on Mon
day knocked off Vancouver's Gib
son Bay Sea Dogs 10-5) will get an
other oppurtunity to show what it
can do, as it takes on the first team of
the Division II Bulldogs.
Looking ahead, Stanford will
have another weekend of noncon
ference action before Humboldt
State comes to town on Feb. 5 for
the second league game of the year.
Leading Boivert's Cardinal
squad into Saturday's game will be
seniors Ceballos, Eli Frankel, Jack
son Wagener, Borut Grgic and
Chuks Amajor, a transfer from the
football team who has played excep
tionally well in the last few games.
Though Saturday's game does
not count in the league standings, it
will be a crucial measuring stick for
Stanford.
The squad will either revert back
to the sloppy play of the season's
first week, or if it can put together
another showing like last Saturday,
which Boivert called "near perfect
rugby," will establish the outlook
for the whole season.
