Double-digit deficits — do not
make them laugh.
The No. 25 Stanford women's bas
ketball team (10-4,3-1 Pacific 10 Con
ference) has a recent knack for falling
apart in the first minutes and then
making a Herculian comeback that
threatens the cardiac health of many
of the fans and leaves opponents in
disbelief.
The lastest comeback came at the
expense of then No. 24 Oregon. The
Ducks thought they had the game in
hand, leading 36-10 late in the first

half. Then, things fell apart.
Enter sophomore Lauren St. Clair
and the rest of the three-point assas
ins, who led an unpreeedented as
sault. They capped the game off with
a 68-26 run, winning 78-62 and boost
ing the team back into the top 25.
Next up for the Cardinal is un
ranked rival California (5-9, 0-4),
which enters Maples in the cellar of
the Pac-10. California is led by Bay
Area native Courtney Johnson, who
is averaging 11.8 points per contest.
The Golden Bears have dropped
their last seven dating back to Dec.
19, including being swept by the Ore
gon schools last weekend. They are 1 -

6 on the road this season, with their
lone win coming against Fresno State.
