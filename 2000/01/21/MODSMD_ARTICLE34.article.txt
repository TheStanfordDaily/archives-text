The Stanford men's gymnastics
team returns to action this Saturday
when it squares off against California
at Burnham Pavillion.
In the Cardinal's season opener
last weekend at Berkeley, No. 9 Stan
ford (1-1, 1-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Conference) fell to No. 8 California
(3-0, 3-0) by a score of 221.40 to
214.40.

■ Tomorrow: No. 9 Stanford (1 -1, 1
1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion), vs. No. 8 California (3-0, 3-0)
7:30 p.m., Burnham Pavilion.

The Bears capitalized on strong
performances by its three freshmen:
Cody Moore, Aaron Floyd, and
Michael Ashe. Together with the
solid routines of All-Americans An
drew Hampy and Tal Moscowitz, the
Bears out-performed the Cardinal to
take the team victory.
Despite the loss, there were sever
al promising performances by Cardi
nal gymnasts, and Stanford head
coach Sadao Hamada was not con
cerned with the outcome.
"Cal beat us by seven points, but it

was our first meet. Overall, we just
didn't execute our routines very
well," Hamada said.
"Competing [last weekend] got
the nerves out, gave us an idea of
where we stand, and focused us on
what we have to do to hang with the
top tier teams," senior co-captain
Craig Nesbitt said.

"After missing most of our rou
tines last weekend, we all came into
practice this week a lot more intense.
We've been doing better gymnastics
in workout, so I am looking for the
team to be able to hit more routines
this weekend," said senior All-Amer
ican Jason Katsampes.
The team worked very hard this
week to eliminate major breaks, falls
and other weaknesses in each rou
tine.
"After one week, my team has im
proved a lot in every area. We're not
perfect yet. but we're making very
good progress," Hamada said.
Some of that progress is due to the
addition of morning workouts to the
daily training regimen. This has been

extremely tough on the Cardinal
gymnasts, but Hamada believes this
is a necessary step toward winning
the NCAA team title.
"The team is very tired, but they
have their goals set and they are
working very hard to reach them. As
long as everyone stays focused and
gives 1(X) percent, I feel very good
about this team's potential," Hama
da said.
Qn Saturday, the Cardinal will
look 4Q*jts two seniors, Katsampes
ifflßw>bitt, to lead the charge
against California with solid perfor
mances on all six events.
Hamada expects his team to close
the seven-point gap but is realistic
about Stanford's chances against Cal
this weekend.
"Even if we don't beat Cal this
weekend, I know we'll beat them in
the end when it really counts,"
Hamada said.
These early meets in January only
serve as a marker of progress, and
they do not affect postseason stand
ing.
"We saw where we were, and we
all know where we want to go. Each
meet for the rest of the season will
bring us a step closer to a champi
onship" said junior Reshad Garan
