# Community reacts to Kinnally's decision
## 
### Corinne Yates Contributing writer 
Robert Kinnally. dean of undergraduate ad
missions and financial aid since the fall of IW7,
elicited elements of both support and surprise

from the Stanford community
with the announcement that he
will leave Stanford at the end
of this academic year.
He plans to attend St.
John Fisher seminary in Stam
ford. Conn., and study to be
come a priest in the Diocese of
Bridgeport, Conn.

"We will miss him very much, but believe that
he has done what he knew he had to do: respond
to the call which he has received," said Fr. Patrick
Laßelle. one of the people Kinnally cited as hav
ing helped him to take this next step in his life.
Kinnally announced his decision to his staff on

Friday afternoon and to the Catholic community
during a service in Memorial Church on Sunday.
In his announcement. Kinnally said that this
was a sort of calling that he had been wrestling
with for a few years.
"I first started thinking about it probably right
after grad school in the late '80s," Kinnally said.
"There was this little nagging voice. You just keep
hearing this voice say 'Do this,' and I kept saying
'No. not me.'"
Kinnally's plan is to spend a year in a prepara
tory seminary program, followed by four more
years studying such topics as theology, pastoral
care, canon law, scripture study, counseling and
sacraments in order to learn the "art" of being a
priest.
"I was not surprised when he shared his desire
for the priesthood with me." Fr. John Paul Forte
said. "He is a natural and has a deep desire to unite
his pursuit of truth and beauty with God's invita
tion to be useful among those who are in need."

Teresa Pleins, the music director for the
Catholic Community at Stanford, said, "Dean
Kinnallv will bring to ordained ministry many of
the same important gifts that he shares with the
Stanford community now — gifts of compassion,
thoughtfulness, a strong ethical base and a faith in
the goodness of life, plus a delightful sense of
humor."
Kinnally admitted a large portion of Stanford's
present undergraduate population, including the
current freshmen and sophomore classes, a num
ber of recent transfer students and the class of
2(X)4, which will be entering in the fall.
"I applaud him. Although it is obviously a loss
for Stanford. I think it is great of him to pursue
what he feels is most important in his life. It
demonstrates a commitment to following God's
will as well as a lot of courage and strength of char
acter," sophomore Robbie Rech said.


Kinnally
During Kinnally's relatively
short time as dean, Stanford's ap
peal to high school students has in
creased considerably. Much of his
effort went into the early decision
process and bringing students finan
cial aid.
Kinnally said. "I would have
never taken the position at Stanford
if I had known that I would be doing
this. Coming to Stanford provided
an opportunity for me to really face
it.
"At a point 1 started asking my
self, 'What is my relationship with
God and what does this stuff mean
to me?' What I realized was that my
faith is very important to me," he
said.
While the news of Kinnally's de
parture was not a novel idea to the
Catholic community, it came as a
surprise to most students.
"When I first heard that Dean
Kinnally was stepping down, I was
totally shocked, but after it sunk in, I

realized how brave of a decision it is.
It shows a lot of humility," freshman
Jennifer Nuckols said.
Sophomore Phiroz Tarapore
said, "I had no idea he was even reli
gious. 1 think he must really have
wanted to do it if he's willing to give
up such a prestigious position to fol
low his dream, and I respect that."
Kinnally said, "My time here has
been wonderful. It was probably the
most rewarding job of my career.
There's a lot that I will miss here.
"Sometimes no matter what
we're doing something else calls
you, and it's somehow now impor
tant," he continued.
Chris Angel, a senior and mem
ber of the Chapel Choir, knows Kin
nally personally after singing and
playing the organ with him. "As a
church musician myself, I'll certain
ly miss him as a colleague.
"I've been truly impressed with
the amount of dedication he's
brought to his professions, as musi
cian and as dean of admissions," he
said. "I'm grateful for the advice and
support he's given me, and I'm con
fident he'll make a fine priest."
