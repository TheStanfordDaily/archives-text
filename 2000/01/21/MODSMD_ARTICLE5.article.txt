Tucked away from the hustle and
hustle of the Stanford campus.
Freshman / Sophomore College
students living in the Sterling Quad
rangle may be far away from the ac
tion. but many say their lives are all
the better because of it.
The 1 NO students who participate
in the program have direct access
and priority to special academic
programs through their residence
that are aimed specifically at fresh
men and sophomores.
The Freshman / Sophomore
College — often dubbed FroSoCo
— opened during the fall of the
I 999-2(XX) school year and serves as
a residential extension of programs

such as Sophomore College and
Stanford Introductory Seminars.
Extensive faculty contact is avail
able to the 90 freshmen and 90
sophomores through programs such
as "Dean Dinners," in \vhich profes
sors speak on a weekly basis to the
students living in Sterling Quad.
After the faculty speak, a select
group of students can sign up to dine
with each professor at the home of
John Bravman, vice provost for un
dergraduate education and the dean
of Freshman / Sophomore College.
"(The dinners] have been really
successful." said J.B. Shank, a teach
ing fellow in the humanities depart
ment and a college director. "We
bring in a lot of speakers geared to
help freshmen and sophomores."
According to Shank, speakers

also discuss Undergraduate Re
search Opportunities, programs for
Overseas Studies and selecting ma
jors or finding summer jobs through
the Career Development Center.
Unlike Structured Liberal Educa
tion, another program in which aca
demics and residences arc fused
into one location, all of the pro
grams offered at the FSC are com
pletely optional to students.
"I've heard nothing but good
things (from the students]. We've
got a great community here with a
high amount of cohesion," Shank
said. "Students arc busy and only
have small amounts of time to par
ticipate in these programs, but
they're optional so it's not a prob
lem."
The students of the college seem

to agree with Shank.
"It's ama/ing. It feels academic
here but there's no pressure to be
part of [the programs]," said John
Bartel, a freshman who participates
in the college. "You're only as in
volved as you want to be."
"They're really making a big ef
fort to reach out to students and lis
ten to what they're interested in.
and then trying to make that possi
ble." said Jonah Berger. a sopho
more.
And though Sterling Quad is far
from the center of campus, most stu
dents agreed that they didn't mind
being on the fringe of things.
Sophomore Leah Higgins said.
"The only had part is riding your
bike back up the hill at the end of
the dav."
