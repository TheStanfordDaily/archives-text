## Scientists discover cause for sudden heart failure 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — They
call it a "stunned" heart.
Just about everyone who under
goes open-heart surgery, even if the
surgery went great, is at risk for sud
den heart failure in the hours after
the operation — and there is little
doctors can do to help.
Now scientists have discovered
that a small molecular glitch leaves
some hearts unable to squeeze out a
proper beat, a finding that could help
develop drugs to get patients out of
intensive care faster or even prevent
this so-called "cardiac stunning."
"This is a problem that's seen on
a daily basis in every major medical
center," said Dr. Eduardo Marban

of Johns Hopkins University, a co
author of the study published in Fri
day s edition of the journal Science.
"It would be nice to have something
else... to do other than wring our
hands and hope for the best."
Perhaps more importantly, the
discovery "adds an awful lot to our
understanding... of how heart mus
cle contracts and doesn't contract,"
information that could help other
heart ailments as well, said Dr. Lynn
Smaha, president of the American
Heart Association.
About 760,000 Americans under
went open-heart surgery in 1997. the
association says, citing the most
recent figure available.

Cardiac stunning is the name for a
temporary type of heart failure,
where the heart cannot beat force
fully enough. It's unpredictable.
Some patients have a mild case,
eased by drugs that help strengthen
heartbeat. More severe patients
require days of expensive care, even
winding up on life support. Some
die.
But here's the intriguing part:
Unlike with other forms of heart fail
ure, if patients can just hang on long
enough, a "stunned" heart can actu
ally repair itself and recover in a few
days.
Using genetically engineered
mice and minuscule catheters

designed to examine rodent hearts,
researchers at Hopkins and Queen's
University in Ontario have discov
ered why.
It turns out that a protein called
troponin-I, or Tnl. is vital for making
the heart contract. If even a little bit
of the Tnl inside the heart gets dam
aged. those contractions weaken,
said lead researcher Dr. Anne Mur
phy. a I lopkins pediatric cardiologist
who has watched children develop
this heart failure after successful
surgery to repair heart defects.
The researchers genetically engi
neered mice whose hearts harbored
defective Tnl. The mice developed
enlarged hearts that struimled to

beat — they looked just like
"stunned" human hearts.
But what damages Tnl in the first
place?
Heart cells temporarily deprived
of oxygen, such as when patients are
put on a heart-lung machine during
surgery, experience a sudden calci
um overload. High calcium levels
produce enzymes that break up pro
teins — in this case, nipping the ends
off the Tnl proteins that help a heart
beat. Murphy explained.
Any loss of oxygen to the heart
can cause Tnl damage, but in many
people in can be imperceptible,
which explains why not everyone has
heart failure after surgerv.

But not everyone survives, and
patients with severe cases can spend
time in intensive care. So armed with
the new research. Marban and Mur
phy are hunting ways to prevent
stunning in people about to undergo
heart surgery. First in line for study
are some experimental drugs that
might inhibit those enzymes that
damage Till.
But the research may affect thou
sands more patients than surgery
candidates.
"What we're seeing with stunned
myocardium 1 believe is the tip of the
iceberg." Marban said, describing
how stunning may play a role in "a
broad variety of cardiac diseases."
