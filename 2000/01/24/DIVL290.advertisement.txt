Commonly Asked Questions
about reducing, reusing, recycling, buying recycled, and composting
Q Is all paper the same?
A. No, paper is not all the same. Paper must be sorted and sold Into different categories because each
has different characteristics and value.For example, white paper and newspaper are made from different
kinds of wood fibers. If the different fibers were pulped or processed together the newspaper, an inferior
fiber, would ruin the quality and strength of the white paper, a thicker, longer and more durable fiber.
Paper mills buy different valued paper depending on what they are making. Most paper products have
several layers of paper. If they want the top sheet to be white and the bottom gray, they would use white
paper for the top, newspaperfor the bottom and mixed paper as the filler, since it is cheaper to buy. If
they wanted a brown bottom, they would use corrugated cardboard. Magazines have a clay content, there
fore it cannot be used in the same way as the other papers. On campus, we sort through each of the
mixed paper or junk mail bins, but we do not sort through the corrugated cardboard collected in green
dumpsters or the newspaper bins. Each category that we have at the Stanford Recycling Center has a dif
ferent value and intended use. Thanks for sorting your paper!
O At the Stanford Recycling Drop-Off Center; why do you collect wine bottles separately from
the other glass bottles ?
A Our wine bottles are collected separately because they are sent to a bottle washing facility that sanitizes
them and sells them back to the winery. Reusing the bottles saves energy because one does not have
spend the energy melting down, remolding, and cooling the glass. These bottles are handled by hand and
cannot have any cracks in them. We only accept cork topped (remove cork - no screw top lids), whole 750
ml and 1.5 liter wine bottles. We are very excited to be a part of this reuse program.
