Another Deloitte Consulting Difference
DELOITTE CONSULTING:
Got a life.
Today, people everywhere want to get ahead in their company while still getting more out
of life away from the job. Deloitte Consulting has long been committed to helping people
achieve this important balance. We have proved an employee who is relaxed, at ease,
fulfilled, involved, content - ultimately does a better job.
Our unique working style, the result of a more service-oriented focus on our clients, was
highlighted in an article in Computerworld.We were quoted as being "collegial," "user
friendly" and "simply easier to deal with than the other Big Six." We set out to share
knowledge, not corner it. We partner with clients to deliver results they can build on.
If you're intent on joining a firm that understands your need to balance your personal and
professional goals, if you want to improve your quality of life without compromising your
future, if you favor relaxed over rigid, if you are comfortable with the concept of teaming
with clients...get in touch. It just might change your life.
