Interim post office a
testament to poor plan
ning and poor service

We have a new post office in
town, and hoy, is it problem
atic.
As the Stanford Post Office is being
rebuilt, the entire community has to
face the inconvenience of marching
out to the temporary United States
Postal Service facility in Florence
Moore field. One would hope that the
USPS would make every effort to off
set that inconvenience; for example,
the larger post office boxes were a
nice gesture.
But many aspects of the services
and facilities at the new post office are
frustratingly poor, and some of them
are downright intolerable.
First, the cashier services and par
cel-pickup window are terribly slow.
The old post office had lines coming
out the door with waiting times of
about half an hour; the lines at the
new office are certainly no better,
with some people reporting waiting
times of nearly two hours. Part of the
problem seems to be that the number
of counters has been reduced to three,
with only one or two actually being
manned at a time.
Second, the facility is having prob
lems with the seasonal weather.
Whose bright idea was it to put in a
dirt floor in Northern California at the
beginning of winter? Having post
office boxes that are shielded from the
rain aren't much of a convenience
when people have to find sure footing
in the mudfest. The sludge could be
dangerous or even inacessible to dis
abled people.
At least the post office had the
decency to put up a cover for the
cashier / parcel-pickup line â€” after
over a week of people waiting out in
the rain.
Worst of all, people are losing their
mail. There have been numerous com
plaints about entire weeks' worth of

correspondence (including important
hills and paychecks) not arriving on
time or not arriving at all. People wait
in the long lines for their parcels only
to he turned awav with the message
that their packages cannot he found
and that they will be contacted "with
in a week." This is an absolute out
rage.
A big part of the frustration is that
the postal administrators and workers
don't seem to be making any efforts to
improve things. Some students wait
ing in line and observing the empty
counters and unusually long parcel
retrieval times have wondered out
loud whether the postal workers
behind the walls are secretly and
knowingly torturing their customers.
What can the post office do to
improve things? Well, it can start by
putting in some gravel to keep people
from slipping on the mud. Next, it
should increase the communication
lines between the post office and the
community. The office should create a
hotline for comments; they should
also publicly acknowledge that they
are aware of the problems and explain
what is being done about them.
Finally, the post office should great
ly increase the number of staff during
this transitional period, something
that should have been done from the
start, lhere need to be more people
behind the counters, more people
retrieving packages and more people
organizing the backlog of mail moved
from the old office.
A lot of money is being poured into
the renovation of the Stanford Post
Office, which is supposed to improve
the quality of service that people have
been complaining so loudly about
over the years, hut il looks like a lot of
money has been tunneled into this
temporary post office as well, which
means that the problems mentioned
here might be fundamental problems
with management, not necessarily
problems with facilities.
If the current service is any indica
tion of how the renovated post office
will be, perhaps our tax money is just
going to waste.
