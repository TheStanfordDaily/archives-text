# The 						Upward Spiral
## A 						Lesson in Mergers and Acquisitions 
### 
Govind Dandekar

Monday, Jan. 10
was a watershed
day for technol
ogy companies. On this
day. America Online
bought out Time Warner
with $160 billion worth of
stock and assumed debt.
With today's overvalued

tech stock prices, this buy-out was the
financial equivalent of trading Baltic
Avenue and $160 billion worth of
Monopoly money for a blue-chip media
company.
Other Internet companies will most
likely follow AOL's lead. It is rumored
that Yahoo is planning on buying out
General Electric by trading 10 shares of
Yahoo stock and a Big Mac extra value
meal to GE shareholders.
The mega-merger and acquisition craze
is not limited to Internet companies
though. Disney bought ABC. Daimler
bought Chrysler. Exxon merged with
Mobil. Glaxo may merge with SmithKline
Bcechem. Proctor & Gamble wants to
merge with Warner-Lambert.
The AOL deal was different, though.
Never before had a merger caused so
many intelligent people to say so many idi
otic things over the course of the week.
Ted Turner, the vice chairman of Time
Warner, publicly stated that he voted for
the merger with "as much or more excite
ment and enthusiasm as I did on that night
when I first made love some 42 years ago."
This quote led many people, including
my roommate, to wonder, "How in the
world does that guy own so much?"
The market response to the merger was
tremendous: on Jan. 10 Time Warner

stock gained almost 50 percent of its value.
This brings me to the point of this column:
if you can predict mergers and acquisi
tions. you can make a pretty sizeable sum
of money.
That is why I have spent the past two
weeks researching consolidation trends in
various industries. The result is a list of
several mergers or acquisitions that I guar
antee will occur over the next year:
Shareholders of newly formed AOL
Time Warner will demand that Ted Turn
er's upper lip merge with his lower lip.
This will render him incapable of voicing
any comparison between his sex life and
his business life.
"Tango and Cash" will merge with
"Turner and Hooch" to form the worst
movie of all time.
Later in the year. Tango, Cash, Turner
and Hooch will merge with Morgan Stan
ley Dean Witter Discover Card and Com
pany to form the world's preeminent
investment bank. This new company will
be called Tango-Cash-Turner-Hooch-
Morgan-Stanley-Dean Witter-Discover-
Card&Company. Employees of this firm
will have to have their business cards
printed on billboards.
Stanford Healthcare will merge with
UCSF Healthcare. The merger will be well
managed and wildly successful.
lime will begin traveling backward.
Over the course of I billion years. North
America, South America, Eurasia, Africa,
Australia and Antarctica will merge to
form Pangea.
My checking account will merge with
my savings account. The new account will
be worth $6.25.
The 101 will merge with the 380 just

outside of San Francisco. This will cause
traffic to back up half an hour in both
directions. Drivers will sit in their cars and
swear at themselves for not taking the 280.
Calista Flockhart and Kate Moss will
merge to become one person. She will
weigh 27 pounds.
CBS and Fox will merge to form a net
work that is still worse than the WB.
Baseball and Ice Dancing will merge to
form the Really, Really. Boring and Idiot
ic Sports League (RRBISL).
Rejects from the WWF, the Republican
Party and the New York City Real Estate
Board will merge to form one political
party. They will call this political party the
"Reform Party."
The backcourt of the 1998 Chicago
Bulls will merge with the frontcourt of the
1986 Boston Celtics to form the greatest
basketball team of all time.
The offense of the 1999 San Francisco
49ers will merge with the defense of the
1999 San Francisco 49ers to form the
worst 49ers football team in recent memo
ry-
BMG Music Service will merge with
American Express. They will send me at
least 10 letters every day.
The Tennessee Titans will merge with
the St. Louis Rams to form the lowest
rated Super Bowl in the history of televi
sion.
That is the extent of my research.
Thanks for reading, and good luck invest-
