Planners of Stanford Post
Office display severe incom
petence and lack of foresight
Here at Stanford University, it's safe to
assume that we are in the presence of many
of the world's most brilliant scholars. And
yet in this hub of intellectual eminence lies
the temporary Stanford Post Office.
Designed by someone who is undoubt
edly the biggest moron on the face of the

Harth, the temporary Stanford Post Office
is a tribute to poor planning and poor design
as the recent rains have made painfully evi
dent. The trailer housing the customer win
dows does not accommodate many people,
meaning that when I went to pick up a pack
age at a rather busy time of day. I spent the
majority of my 45-minute wait outside of
the trailer where there is no covering.
Perhaps this would not have been a
problem had it not been pouring rain at the

time. Dealing with the always-courteous
post office staff after a nearly hour long wait
is certainly more pleasurable when soaking
wet.
Having finally received my package, I
went to check my mailbox. Sadly 1 didn't
make it very far. because once I stepped
into the area around the boxes, I immedi
ately sank into six inches of mud. While the
benefits of having an insufficiently covered
dirt area around the post office boxes dur

ing the rainiest time of year are certainly too
numerous to mention, I think cement
paving in that area is a luxury this universi
ty could afford.
And to think I would have laughed if
someone waiting in line for two hours with
me at the old post office would have said.
"Well, at least it can't get any worse."
