al championships. On Saturday
night, the No. 12 Stanford men's vol

Freshman middle blocker Curt Toppel puts the roof over a possible
kill for the No. 1 UCLA. Despite a valent effort by No. 12 Stanford, the
Bruins proved to be too much, winning in three games.
three games, 15-11,15-9,15-11.
The game will be recorded as a
loss for Stanford, but to simply say
the Cardinal lost 3-0 does not do the
squad justice. For a team that hardly
put up a fight in its loss to No. 8
Brigham Young University on
Wednesday, Stanford's performance
on Saturday makes the match more
like a win than a loss.
"1 felt it was closer than the scores
indicate. We were in every game."
head coach Ruben Nieves said. "It
was clear that the guys were deter
mined to bounce back and make sure
that Wednesday's performance was
the exception."
The Cardinal wasted no time in
ensuring that its performance Satur
day night would not be a repeat of a
disappointing Wednesday night.
Freshman middle blocker Curt Top
pel got the momentum rolling right
from the start with two quick aces,
then teaming with junior setter Josh
Lukens for a joint diving effort to
save a loose ball on defense and it
was clear that Stanford was not going
down without a fight.
Stanford maintained intensity

throughout game one and showed
determination at the end of the
game, similar to its initial spark. The
Cardinal held the Bruins at 14 points
through several side outs and game
points, before bowing 15-11 to
UCLA.
"UCLA played like a top-ranked
team," Nieves said. "In crunch time
they played their best. There were
just a couple of small plays here and
there that UCLA was better at than
we were."
Propelled by a season-high
turnout of 1,017 enthusiastic fans at
Maples Pavilion, the Cardinal bat
tled the Bruins for nearly two hours
before succumbing to the kind of
play that has made UCLA No. 1 in
the nation.
"[UCLA] expected to come here
and roll over us. but we fought with a
lot of pride," redshirt freshman Seth
Ring said. "We fought back from
being down and took the lead at
times. It really shows the character of
our team."
Three Stanford players finished
the night in double digits for kills,
with Toppel's 28 kills leading the
way. In each of his first four colle
giate matchups. Toppel has exceed
ed 20 kills and is just one kill away
from reaching the 1 (X) mark for ca

reer kills. Toppel also led the team in
aces, notching a season-high of
three.
Junior middle blocker Brett
Youngberg finished the night with 15
kills and led the team with six blocks.
Ring was just behind with 14 kills,
posting a hitting percentage of .393.
"It was nice to see Seth bounce
back." Nieves, said referring to
Ring's performance Wednesday that
landed him in a negative hitting per
centage. "He had a really good
match, especially with hitting. That's
a sign of a tough competitor."
Nieves also praised the play of
Lukens, who led the team with a sea
son-high 62 assists.
"The lineup lends itself to offen
sive variety that we didn't take ad
vantage of on Wednesday," Nieves
said. "[Saturday] Josh did an out
standing job utilizing the hitters and
the offensive system."
"We had great ball control," Ring
said. "UCLA is the toughest team
serving-wise that we've faced all year
and we passed their serves well."
Saturday's performance was a big
improvement over UCLA's blowout
against Stanford in their preseason
matchup in Novemvber.
"This match was a much different
3-0 loss," Nieves said. "I'his match

was much more competitive. Both
teams were much better, but we've
improved more, we've closed the
g a P-"
The improvement points to the
growth of Stanford's young squad
this season. Factoring in injuries and
a lack of seniors on the squad. Stan
ford has returned only four players
this year, giving Nieves a lot to work
with.
"Brett [Youngberg] and Josh
[Lukens] did a nice job of stepping up
in game three," Nieves said of the
two most experienced players in
Stanford's starting lineup. "In certain
tough situations they led the way.
They made nice plays and gave us a
lift."
As the season goes on. the players
are hoping that they will keep im
proving, which will enable them to
put even more pressure on teams
such as UCLA and the rest of the
Pac-10 powerhouses as the rest of the
season continues.
"We make a lot of mistakes be
cause we're a young team." Toppel
said. "We haven't been together too
long, we are still gelling and learning
how to play as a team. We didn't win
tonight, but we played better be
cause we started getting excited and
having fun out there."
