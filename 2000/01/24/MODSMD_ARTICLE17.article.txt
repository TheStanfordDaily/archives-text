# Card proves un-'Bear' able for Cal
## 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Berkely-California tried to bark
and bite and goad Stanford into a
dogfight down low Saturday in
Berkeley. Little did the Bears
know their physical play would fire
up the biggest dog of all — Mark
Madsen.
Clawing and pushing, diving and
flopping, hustling and, yes, politely
chatting with the referees — the
Mad Dog was back in fine form.
After struggling offensively in
Stanford's first four conference
games, the emotional heart of the
third-ranked Cardinal put up 19
points and brought down 11 re
bounds. both game highs, to lead
Stanford (15-1, 4-1 Pacific 10 Con
ference ) to an S1 -70 win against Cal
(10-7, 1-4) in the newly renovated
Haas Pavilion.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Saturday: No. 3 Stanford (15-1,4-
1 Pacific 10 Conference) 81, Califor
nia (10-7. 1-4)70.

Combined with No. 2 Arizona's
loss to IJSC in Los Angeles Satur
day. Stanford's sixth-straight victo
ry over its cross-bay rival put the
Cardinal in place to move back up
when the Associated Press poll is
released this afternoon.
"Madsen did what he does
best," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "He just keeps
battling out there and then you
look up and he has 19 [points] and
11 [rebounds]."
Since he returned from a thigh
injury just before the New Year.
Madsen's two biggest weapons, his
shooting proficiency and offensive
rebounding, have been suspect.
But against Cal, Madsen finished
with five offensive boards and was
7 of K from the field and 5 for 5 on
free throws.
"Inside. I knew that I could re
bound offensively," he said. "When
I failed to do that effectively the
past few games, that was disap
pointing. Hut I played well today.
That was good."
With the fight for the Pacific 10
Conference title now in full form.
Saturday afternoon in Berkeley
must have been a scary sight for
Pac-10 teams not residing in Palo
Alto.
After USC's upset of the Wild

cats and despite the Trojans' loss of
top scorer Sam Clancy to a frac
tured foot Thursday against Ari
zona State, Stanford was already in
good position for the remainder of
the conference race. With Madsen
back in Mad Dog shape, the Cardi
nal's chances look even better.
"I still believe they're the best
team in our league, even after the
Arizona loss," said California head
coach Ben Braun. "I don't think
there's a player stronger than Mad
sen."
But Stanford's biggest strength
is that it is not a one-man team — a
trait exemplified once more against
Cal.
Junior Ryan Mendez, who has
been relegated to the bench by the
sharp play of freshman Casey Ja
cobsen, added a big 15 points for
the Cardinal. Two years ago
Mendez led the conference in
three-point shooting percentage.
Saturday, he looked like he had
again found his stroke, hitting all
four three-pointers he took. His
three threes in the second-half,
each from the right corner, kept the
surging Bears at arm's length.
"Ryan was huge," Montgomery
said. "He looked like he had his old
feeling of every time he shoots the
ball, he thinks it's in."
Mendez said increased confi
dence might explain his clutch per
formance.
"My confidence is back," he 112
said. "When you start doubting or
backing off, it's over. I definitely
felt comfortable tonight."
That does not mean Mendez is
comfortable with his role coming
off the bench though.
"If you think for a minute that I
don't want to start, you're crazy,"
he said. "I definitely want to get my
job back."
Casey Jacobsen, the man who
took over for Mendez against Ore
gon State when he missed practices
that week to attend a family funer
al, had an up-and-down day.
While the Cardinal's season
leading scorer finished with 14
points, his shooting was suspect. Ja
cobsen was 4 of 13 from the floor,
including only 2 of 8 from three
point territory, and hit only 4 of 8
free throws. Even from point-blank
range, he was only 50 percent.
Early in the game, Jacobsen, a
favorite target of Cal's student sec
tion, gave the fans reason to jeer

after the ft f00t.6 inch guard got
nothing but the front of the rim on
an open dunk attempt. However,
with 1:19 left in the game, he re
turned the favor, throwing down a
two-hander directly in front of a sea
of blue and yellow students.
The dunk gave Stanford an insur
mountable 11-point lead and Ja
cobsen an opportunity to return
some of the flavor to the rowdy
crowd.
The game was officiated very
tightly, with 53 total fouls accumu
lated between the two teams.
While Cal thought that inhibited
its chances inside against the Cardi
nal, Montgomery was more than
happy to see his charges going to
the line.

Following up a game in which
Stanford hit its final 21 free throws
to ice a win over Oregon, the Car
dinal was 30 of 36 from the line Sat
urday.
In fact, Stanford's big men —
Jarron Collins. Jason Collins and
Madsen — hit all 17 of their foul
shots, a rare trifecta that left the
Bears little opportunity to come
back.
It wasn't as if Cal didn't try.
Twice the Bears brought Stanford
down from 16 points to within strik
ing distance, but could never get
close enough..
Each time Stanford, finally fea
turing the punishing talents of the
Mad Dog again and his supporting
cast. bit back even harder.

and bite and goad Stanford into a
dogfight down low Saturday in
Berkeley. Little did the Bears
know their physical play would fire
up the biggest dog of all — Mark
Madsen.
Clawing and pushing, diving and
flopping, hustling and, yes, politely
chatting with the referees — the
Mad Dog was back in fine form.
After struggling offensively in
Stanford's first four conference
games, the emotional heart of the
third-ranked Cardinal put up 19
points and brought down 11 re
bounds. both game highs, to lead
Stanford (15-1, 4-1 Pacific 10 Con
ference ) to an S1 -70 win against Cal
(10-7, 1-4) in the newly renovated
Haas Pavilion.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Saturday: No. 3 Stanford (15-1,4-
1 Pacific 10 Conference) 81, Califor
nia (10-7. 1-4)70.

Combined with No. 2 Arizona's
loss to IJSC in Los Angeles Satur
day. Stanford's sixth-straight victo
ry over its cross-bay rival put the
Cardinal in place to move back up
when the Associated Press poll is
released this afternoon.
"Madsen did what he does
best," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "He just keeps
battling out there and then you
look up and he has 19 [points] and
11 [rebounds]."
Since he returned from a thigh
injury just before the New Year.
Madsen's two biggest weapons, his
shooting proficiency and offensive
rebounding, have been suspect.
But against Cal, Madsen finished
with five offensive boards and was
7 of K from the field and 5 for 5 on
free throws.
"Inside. I knew that I could re
bound offensively," he said. "When
I failed to do that effectively the
past few games, that was disap
pointing. Hut I played well today.
That was good."
With the fight for the Pacific 10
Conference title now in full form.
Saturday afternoon in Berkeley
must have been a scary sight for
Pac-10 teams not residing in Palo
Alto.
After USC's upset of the Wild

cats and despite the Trojans' loss of
top scorer Sam Clancy to a frac
tured foot Thursday against Ari
zona State, Stanford was already in
good position for the remainder of
the conference race. With Madsen
back in Mad Dog shape, the Cardi
nal's chances look even better.
"I still believe they're the best
team in our league, even after the
Arizona loss," said California head
coach Ben Braun. "I don't think
there's a player stronger than Mad
sen."
But Stanford's biggest strength
is that it is not a one-man team — a
trait exemplified once more against
Cal.
Junior Ryan Mendez, who has
been relegated to the bench by the
sharp play of freshman Casey Ja
cobsen, added a big 15 points for
the Cardinal. Two years ago
Mendez led the conference in
three-point shooting percentage.
Saturday, he looked like he had
again found his stroke, hitting all
four three-pointers he took. His
three threes in the second-half,
each from the right corner, kept the
surging Bears at arm's length.
"Ryan was huge," Montgomery
said. "He looked like he had his old
feeling of every time he shoots the
ball, he thinks it's in."
Mendez said increased confi
dence might explain his clutch per
formance.
"My confidence is back," he 112
said. "When you start doubting or
backing off, it's over. I definitely
felt comfortable tonight."
That does not mean Mendez is
comfortable with his role coming
off the bench though.
"If you think for a minute that I
don't want to start, you're crazy,"
he said. "I definitely want to get my
job back."
Casey Jacobsen, the man who
took over for Mendez against Ore
gon State when he missed practices
that week to attend a family funer
al, had an up-and-down day.
While the Cardinal's season
leading scorer finished with 14
points, his shooting was suspect. Ja
cobsen was 4 of 13 from the floor,
including only 2 of 8 from three
point territory, and hit only 4 of 8
free throws. Even from point-blank
range, he was only 50 percent.
Early in the game, Jacobsen, a
favorite target of Cal's student sec
tion, gave the fans reason to jeer

after the ft f00t.6 inch guard got
nothing but the front of the rim on
an open dunk attempt. However,
with 1:19 left in the game, he re
turned the favor, throwing down a
two-hander directly in front of a sea
of blue and yellow students.
The dunk gave Stanford an insur
mountable 11-point lead and Ja
cobsen an opportunity to return
some of the flavor to the rowdy
crowd.
The game was officiated very
tightly, with 53 total fouls accumu
lated between the two teams.
While Cal thought that inhibited
its chances inside against the Cardi
nal, Montgomery was more than
happy to see his charges going to
the line.

Following up a game in which
Stanford hit its final 21 free throws
to ice a win over Oregon, the Car
dinal was 30 of 36 from the line Sat
urday.
In fact, Stanford's big men —
Jarron Collins. Jason Collins and
Madsen — hit all 17 of their foul
shots, a rare trifecta that left the
Bears little opportunity to come
back.
It wasn't as if Cal didn't try.
Twice the Bears brought Stanford
down from 16 points to within strik
ing distance, but could never get
close enough..
Each time Stanford, finally fea
turing the punishing talents of the
Mad Dog again and his supporting
cast. bit back even harder.


Irene Tang — Daily Californian
Senior Mark "Mad Dog" Madsen bears his teeth and grabbed one of
his 11 rebounds in No. 3 Stanford's win over the Golden Bears, 81-
70. Madsen looked impressive and looks to be fully recovered from
an injury early this season.
