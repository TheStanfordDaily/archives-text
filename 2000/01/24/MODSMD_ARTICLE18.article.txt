# Stanford women's hoops squad dominates Cal at home
## Inside-oustide presence too much for Bears to handle 
### Joe Cavanaugh Editorial staff 
The No. 25 women's basketball
team (11 -4. 4-1 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) did not need an masterful
strategies or massive offensive as
saults to hold off California (5-10.
0-5).
Instead, it took a conventional
path of solid defense and impres
sive rebounding en route to a 83-57
victory, its 13th straight over the
Bears.
Stanford opened up the game on
a 22-3 run and never relinquished
the lead.
With a 43-20 lead at the half, the
women were well on their way to
winning their ninth game out of
their last ten.
"We had a good start tonight,"
said head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"That's goal No. 1 for us. And when
Cal made a run. we countered very
well."
Sophomore Undsev Yamasaki
led the way for the Cardinal, post
ing 17 points, with 12 straight com
ing at the end of the first half.
Sophomore Bethany Donaphin
owned the Bears on the boards,
tearing down 11 rebounds and
leading Stanford to a 40-30 re
bound advantage.
Despite the effort put forth by
the squad. VanDerveer was con
cerned with some of the mental er
rors and sloppy play by the Cardi
nal.

"Some of them showed their in
experience." she said. "We didn't
have the flow we usually have. We
got really sloppy. But our people
learned an important lesson last
week (in the 42-point turnaround
win over Oregon) and even tonight.
We've got to keep playing hard."

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Friday: No. 25 Stanford (11-4. 4-1
Pacific 10 Conference) 83, California
(5-10.0-5)57.

However, despite some ques
tionable play, guard Milena Flores
continues to play with a consistency
the rest of the team is able to build
on.
The 5-foot. 6-inch senior poured
in 11 points and eight assists, while
continuing to lead the Pac-10 in
free-throw percentage (.909) and
being fourth in three-point per
centage (.417).
Flores is a major factor in Stan
ford's Pac-10 dominance in
assist/turnover ratio and assists.
The Cardinal leads the league with
a 1.05 ratio and averages 17.4 as
sists per game.
Along with Flores and Yamasa
ki. three other players posted dou
ble-digits in scoring. Donaphin and
junior Carolyn Moos finished with
11. and freshman Jamie Carey had
10. including three from beyond the
three-point arc.
Moos has emerged as one of the
stars in the Pac-10. ranking seventh

in scoring with 14.6 per game and
rebounding with 6.5. Her inside
presence and feel around the bas
ket are helping her to come into her
own as a geniune inside threat, who
can hurt opponents on the inside or
with her perimeter shooting.
Carey is continuing her phe
nomenal freshman campaign. The
1999 Gatorade Colorado Player of
the Year has made a three-pointer
in each game she has played in this
year. Despite her chronically-ailing
ankles, Carey has been able to start
at the off-guard for the Cardinal
this season and has added a little
extra fire to the play of Stanford.
The only letdown for Stanford
was the Bears' 12-0 run in the first
half.
However, the Cardinal was able
to regain its composure and find its
range for the rest of the game, with
a 55.4 shooting percentage.
Addressing her team's brief
spurt. Bears head coach Marianne
Stanley said, "I felt pretty pleased
that we came back after they got up
by such a great margin. I was con
cerned our players would just total
ly lose their composure and not
have the resilience to get it back."
But, in almost the same breath,
Stanley turned realist about what
happened the rest the of the way.
"When we made errors," she
said, "they turned them into
points."
Stanford's dominance shined
through in its holding Cal to a 32.2

field-goal percentage for the game.
The Cardinal is sixth in the Pac-10
in scoring defense, holding oppo
nents to just more than 67 points
per game.
Stanford was able to shut down
junior Kenya Corely and sopho
more Shavaki Jackson, who despite
posting 15 points each, were kept
off the boards and could not con
tain the offense of the Cardinal.
They forced the Cardinal into 24
turnovers, but could not convert on
the other end.
Corely, considered one of the
most athletic players in the confer
ence could not keep up with the
constant pressure of Flores or the
Stanford defense. She was never
able to get into a rhythm to hurt the
Cardinal.
Jackson, California's tallest
player at 6-foot, 4-inches could not
wrestle the rebounds away from
Moos or fellow teammate sopho
more Cori Enghusen. Moos is listed
at 6-foot, 6 -inches and Enghusen is
one of the tallest players in Stan
ford women's basketball history,
topping out at 6-feet, 7-inches.
More impressive than the defen
sive numbers are the offensive
numbers the Cardinal has been
able to produce. It leads the Pac-10
in three-point percentage with .422
and three-pointers made, with
more than 7 per game. It is fourth in
scoring margin and field percent
age, with +7.4 and .458, respective
ly.


Levon Utidjian — Daily
Senior guard Yvonne Gbalazeh looks to pass against California. The
No. 25 Stanford women's team handed the Bears an embarassing
loss at Maples to push their record to 4-1 in the Pac-10 and their
ninth win in their last 10 games.
