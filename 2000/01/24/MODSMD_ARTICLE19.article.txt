# Students gather at White Plaza anti-abortion rally
## 
### Mary Crisham Contributing writer 
Despite the rain that fell on the
circle of people gathered in White
Plaza Saturday night, the flames of
their candles continued to burn
brightly throughout the candlelight
vigil held in memory of the 1973
Roe vs. Wade U.S. Supreme Court
decision.
Next to a poster reading "Roe
vs. Wade: 27 Years of Life De
nied," right-to-life supporters from
throughout the Stanford communi
ty gathered to remember the deci
sion, which legalized abortion in all
U.S. states through all nine months
of pregnancy.
This decision was determined by
a majority opinion that held that
abortion should be legal due to a
"right to privacy," a right not found
in the Constitution, the introduc
tion to the program stated.
Sponsored by Stanford Students
for Life, a Stanford University or
ganization without any religious or
political affiliation, the vigil was "a
small way to memorialize the mil
lions of innocent victims of abor
tion who had no proper funeral in
thousands of abortion clinics," said
Brendan Stuhan, president of
SSFL.
He said the vigil is "an extension
of the pro-life movement's com
mitment to peaceful resistance of
legalized abortion, a movement
which opposes all violence against
human life, not just defenseless
lives."
The program included choral
music, a reading of the Supreme
Court decision of Roe vs. Wade,
various selections from "Voices
from the Womb," which expresses

the impact of abortion on its vic
tims, and " The Uncounted Vic
tims," which discusses the impact
of abortion on its survivors.
The final event of the evening
was a reading of "Diary of a Baby's
Life."
Stuhan said the selections and
the vigil as a whole intended to "re
move the issue of abortion from the
pro-abortion semantics of "choice.'
'surgical procedures' and 'clumps
of tissue,' to demonstrate that le
galized abortion results in the wan
ton destruction of human life."
"Regardless of what pro-abor
tionists assert," he said, "we show

that abortion victims are human,
and that life is precious, not only
when we choose to nurture and
protect it."
The event attracted not only on
campus supporters, but also people
from throughout the greater Stan
ford community who wished to
show their support for the right-to
life cause.
Junior Anne Berry, who partici
pated in the vigil, felt the increased
participation at this year's event
was a successful showing of a rising
involvement of right to life sup
porters.
She said. "The event was also

successful because it made SSFL
more visible on campus, to show
people that we do exist, so that they
see us and see what we stand for."
Stuhan emphasized that SSFL is
"not simply devoted to protesting
abortion, but also committed to
supporting women who make the
right choice and have their babies."
The group sponsors trips to Her
itage Home to visit and support
unwed mothers and a clothing
drive for the Crisis Pregnancy Cen
ter.
