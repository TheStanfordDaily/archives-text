## 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
A group of female Stanford employees in
volved in a gender discrimination suit against
the University may find their anonymity threat
ened.
According to the San Jose Mercury News, a
source familiar to the Department of Labor's
investigation into Stanford was told by an
agency official that the women's identities
would be released last Friday. Jan. 21.
In a related incident, a female contractor is
alleging gender discrimination at Stanford after
she was fired from the hospital in December.
The Department of Labor probe into Stan
ford's hiring and promotion practices began
last February, in response to a November 1998
complaint filed by eight Stanford faculty and
staff members.
The initial complaint, a 400-page report de
tailing alleged gender discrimination in the
School of Humanities and Sciences, the Med
ical School, the Law School and the School of
Education, encompassed about 30 women and
a few minority men. In a statement last year,
former Asst. I listory Prof. Karen Sawislak stat
ed that the report addressed a wide variety of is
sues, from "promotion to appointment to hos
tile climate to wrongful termination."
A former Stanford professor who was de
nied tenure in the mid-1990s withdrew from the
group complaint rather than be identified, ac
cording to the Mercury News. "It was very dis
turbing," she was quoted as saying. "Months
ago, when I went to give my deposition, they
told me that everything I said would be anony
mous. I wouldn't have none anv further if 1

hadn't been told that. I wish I could stick with it.
1 wish I could do more for the cause. But 1 be
lieve there would be ramifications I could not
deal with."
The Mercury News also reported one scien
tist as saying that her pay was halved when
Stanford learned of her involvement in the in
vestigation. It is unclear why the Department of
Labor planned to disclose the names of the in
dividuals involved.
Stanford attorney Tom Fenner said the al
leged pay cut experienced by the scientist had
been investigated and found to be without
foundation, according to the Mercury News.
According to Fenner, "(Stanford] will take
all necessary, appropriate steps to make sure
that no retaliation occurs."
The Department of Labor case is not the
only allegation of gender discrimination plagu
ing the University. Former contractor Suzanne
Mcintosh has lodged numerous complaints
against the Stanford Hospital administration
alleging sexual harassment and wrongful termi
nation.
Mcintosh, hired as a project manager in the
Design and Construction unit of Stanford Hos
pital. stated that she was fired after objecting to
the sexually explicit language and pornograph
ic images used by the workers she oversaw.
Mcintosh also said the workers, employees
of the construction firm Rudolph & Sletten,
used improper containment procedures when
working around sensitive mammogram films
and gained uncontrolled access to operating
rooms, compromising patient privacy.
Hospital spokeswoman Laurie Ito called the
incident a "personnel matter," and stated that
Mcintosh's claims were under investigation.
