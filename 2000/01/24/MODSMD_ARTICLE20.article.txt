## 
### Alice Brown Editorial staff 
Today marks the opening of The
Living History Project, a 10-day
event that aims to educate Stanford
students about the impact of war on
the lives of individuals.
The opening ceremony, which is
scheduled for 7 p.m in the dining
room of the Bechtel International
Center, will feature keynote speak
er Peter Duus of the history depart
ment.
The ceremony will focus on the
experiences of civilians in China,
Japan, Korea and the Philippines
throughout the Second World War.
The project was put together by
Living History, a group of 29 stu
dents co-chaired by seniors Eric
Leventhal and Shiki Tomimasu.
The members are from China, Tai
wan, Korea, Japan, Singapore, the
Philippines, Bhutan, India and the
United States.
According to a press release, one
of the group's goals is to create a
forum where individuals of varying
backgrounds can share and discuss
reactions to a common past of war
related suffering and healing.
"Part of the uniqueness of Living
History is the sheer diversity of our
members," Leventhal said. "Living
History is exceptional in that you
find people who are really devoted
to moving beyond boundaries of na
tionality in order to gain a better un
derstanding of what actually hap
pened all those years ago."
After the opening ceremony
there are two exhibitions, the for
mer held from today until Jan. 18,.
the latter from Jan. 29 to Feb. 3.
Four speeches have also been
scheduled, with the final speech part
of the closing ceremony.

The speakers include a professor
of history at CSU-Northridge, a Fil
ipino woman who lived through the
war and two Hiroshima survivors.
"History is not written by the vic
tims, and while we might not be able
to change that, we still want people
to know that the past is more com
plicated than the explanations you
see in history books," Leventhal
said.
Tomimasu feels strongly about
younger generations taking the ini
tiative to learn the history of their el
ders.
"It's our duty as the younger gen
eration to take the initiative to tell
them that we care about that history,
and that we want to learn from the
mistakes that created this misery for
them, so that we will never repeat
it,"he said.
Tomimasu is Japanese, and has
found in working on this project that
people make many incorrect as
sumptions about how the Japanese
remember WWII.
"I believe the first step in over
coming this mistrust is to listen to
one another, and to understand the
political dimensions involved in the
formation of 'official history,' "
Tomimasu said. "Hopefully our
project will contribute to facilitating
a dialogue that will lead to better
mutual understanding."
Leventhal added his support of
this idea.
"When I joined Shiki in this ef
fort, I was interested in pursuing
that theme of a multidimensional
perspective of war," he said. "Even
though we may never know what re
ally happened, or the true cause of
events, I believe that approaching
these issues with a broader historical
lens can only afford you a more ac
curate view of the past."
