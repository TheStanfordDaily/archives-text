# Women's tennis squad sautees Ducks in home dual match
## 
### Bill Hanson Staff writer 
Friday's dual match against Ore
gon (0-1,0-1 Pacific 10 Conference)
was completely unexciting, which is
exactly what the Stanford women's
tennis squad (2-0.1-0) wanted.
In its first dual match of the sea
son. the squad wanted to
emphatically demonstrate why it
was ranked No. 1 in the nation.
It did just that, as every player
squashed her opponent in straight
sets without conceding more than
three games in a set.
"There was lots of energy out
there," said sophomore Keiko
Tokuda. "Coach [Frank Brennanj
told us that Oregon was tough, and
we knew that this was our first
match, so we were ready."
Sophomore Gabby Lastra, who is
ranked 15th in the nation, was first
off the court after routing Oregon's
Amy Juppenlatz, 6-0.6-1, at the No.
4 singles position. Lastra, who failed
to produce many impressive results
during the preseason, seemed fo
cused throughout the match.
"Gabby kicked butt," Tokuda
said. "She was on fire."
Lastra wasn't the only player on
fire.
Freshman Laura Granville, who
is ranked second in the nation after
having won the Intercollegiate Ten
nis Association's Regional Champi
onships in November, defeated Ore
gon's Monika Geiczys, 6-1.6-1 in the
No. 1 singles match.
"It was nice to get that win under
my belt," said Granville, who was
upset by UCLA's Amanda Basica
earlier this month at the National
Collegiate Tennis Championships in
Sherwood Oaks, Calif. "I just want
ed to play well and get back into it."
The rest of the Stanford squad
turned in equally impressive perfor
mances.
"Everyone probably had some
little problem with their game,"
Tokuda said. "But todav. evervone

was just a better player than their op
ponents. It helps when you have that
thing on your back that says ' Stan
ford.' "
Senior Teryn Ashley crushed
Oregon's Alina Wygonowska at the
No. 2 spot, 6-0,6-3. Although Ashley
sat out much of the preseason with
an injured wrist, she is now healthy
and was in fine form during the first
dual match of the season.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
■ Friday: No.l Stanford (2-0, 1-0 Pa
cific 10 Conference) 8, Oregon (0-1,
0-1),1.
■ Tomorrow: Stanford vs. Hawaii,
1:30 p.m., Taube Family Tennis Sta
dium.

Sophomore Lauren Kalvaria,
who is currently ranked 13th nation
ally, posted a 6-3. 6-0 win over
Jeanette Mattson in the No. 4 singles
match. At the No. 5 position, senior
Jennifer Heiser turned in a 6-1, 6-3
pasting of Oregon's Sarah Colistro.
Meanwhile, Tokuda stopped
Oregon's Janice Nyland with a 6-0,
6-3 decision in the No. 6 singles
match.
In doubles, Tokuda teamed with
Granville at the No. 1 spot to carve
out an efficient 8-0 victory over Ore
gon's duo of Nyland and Juppenlatz.
"In our last tournament together,
we played poorly," Tokuda said.
"Today was a better resemblance of
our skills."
Tokuda and Granville are cur
rently the ninth-ranked team in the
nation and seem to share strong
chemistry.
"I love playing with her,"
Granville said. "Whenever I'm
down, she gets me up. Whenever
she's down. I get her up."
Lastra and Kalvaria, who have
been doubles partners since their ju
nior days but have struggled as of
late, were back in full force as they
swept Oregon's Mattson and
Wygonowska. 8- 3.

Oregon did garner one point as
the No. 3 tandem of Geiczys and
Sarah Colistro rallied past Stan
ford's Heiser and junior Sarah
Pestieau. 8-6.
While the Ducks were visibly
thrilled by their sole doubles
victory, it seemed somewhat incon
sequential in light of the Cardinal's
otherwise dominating performance.
"If we could win all of our match
es like this." Tokuda joked after the
match, "it would be ideal."
The most interesting surprise of
Friday's match may have been the
Cardinal's singles lineup, which was
uncertain until Friday morning.
The team played challenge
matches on Thursday in order to de
termine the ladder, and an especial
ly dramatic encounter unfolded as
Granville and Ashley fought for the
No. 1 position. After three and a half
hours, Granville took the match, 7-5,
5-7,7-5.
Afterward, there were no bad
feelings.
"Everyone on this team is so
damn good that anyone could beat
anyone on a given day," Tokuda
said. "You can't say whoever's bet
ter than whoever. But if we were al
ways switching the lineup, it would
be disastrous. As long as we're win
ning as a team, it's fine."
Soon, of course, sophomore star
Marissa Irvin will return to campus
to participate in the rest of the sea
son's matches at the No. 1 position.
Irvin recently lost to Lindsay Daven
port, the world's second-ranked pro
fessional player, in two tight sets in
the second round of the Australian
Open.
With the return of Irvin, the top
ranked Cardinal should not have too
many challengers in the Pac-10, who
can compete with its depth.
"I'm really looking forward to
her return," Granville said, 'it
will just make the team that much
stronger and give us more confi
dence. We're really getting unified
as a team."

there," said sophomore Keiko
Tokuda. "Coach [Frank Brennanj
told us that Oregon was tough, and
we knew that this was our first
match, so we were ready."
Sophomore Gabby Lastra, who is
ranked 15th in the nation, was first
off the court after routing Oregon's
Amy Juppenlatz, 6-0.6-1, at the No.
4 singles position. Lastra, who failed
to produce many impressive results
during the preseason, seemed fo
cused throughout the match.
"Gabby kicked butt," Tokuda
said. "She was on fire."
Lastra wasn't the only player on
fire.
Freshman Laura Granville, who
is ranked second in the nation after
having won the Intercollegiate Ten
nis Association's Regional Champi
onships in November, defeated Ore
gon's Monika Geiczys, 6-1.6-1 in the
No. 1 singles match.
"It was nice to get that win under
my belt," said Granville, who was
upset by UCLA's Amanda Basica
earlier this month at the National
Collegiate Tennis Championships in
Sherwood Oaks, Calif. "I just want
ed to play well and get back into it."
The rest of the Stanford squad
turned in equally impressive perfor
mances.
"Everyone probably had some
little problem with their game,"
Tokuda said. "But todav. evervone

was just a better player than their op
ponents. It helps when you have that
thing on your back that says ' Stan
ford.' "
Senior Teryn Ashley crushed
Oregon's Alina Wygonowska at the
No. 2 spot, 6-0,6-3. Although Ashley
sat out much of the preseason with
an injured wrist, she is now healthy
and was in fine form during the first
dual match of the season.

Sophomore Lauren Kalvaria,
who is currently ranked 13th nation
ally, posted a 6-3. 6-0 win over
Jeanette Mattson in the No. 4 singles
match. At the No. 5 position, senior
Jennifer Heiser turned in a 6-1, 6-3
pasting of Oregon's Sarah Colistro.
Meanwhile, Tokuda stopped
Oregon's Janice Nyland with a 6-0,
6-3 decision in the No. 6 singles
match.
In doubles, Tokuda teamed with
Granville at the No. 1 spot to carve
out an efficient 8-0 victory over Ore
gon's duo of Nyland and Juppenlatz.
"In our last tournament together,
we played poorly," Tokuda said.
"Today was a better resemblance of
our skills."
Tokuda and Granville are cur
rently the ninth-ranked team in the
nation and seem to share strong
chemistry.
"I love playing with her,"
Granville said. "Whenever I'm
down, she gets me up. Whenever
she's down. I get her up."
Lastra and Kalvaria, who have
been doubles partners since their ju
nior days but have struggled as of
late, were back in full force as they
swept Oregon's Mattson and
Wygonowska. 8- 3.

Oregon did garner one point as
the No. 3 tandem of Geiczys and
Sarah Colistro rallied past Stan
ford's Heiser and junior Sarah
Pestieau. 8-6.
While the Ducks were visibly
thrilled by their sole doubles
victory, it seemed somewhat incon
sequential in light of the Cardinal's
otherwise dominating performance.
"If we could win all of our match
es like this." Tokuda joked after the
match, "it would be ideal."
The most interesting surprise of
Friday's match may have been the
Cardinal's singles lineup, which was
uncertain until Friday morning.
The team played challenge
matches on Thursday in order to de
termine the ladder, and an especial
ly dramatic encounter unfolded as
Granville and Ashley fought for the
No. 1 position. After three and a half
hours, Granville took the match, 7-5,
5-7,7-5.
Afterward, there were no bad
feelings.
"Everyone on this team is so
damn good that anyone could beat
anyone on a given day," Tokuda
said. "You can't say whoever's bet
ter than whoever. But if we were al
ways switching the lineup, it would
be disastrous. As long as we're win
ning as a team, it's fine."
Soon, of course, sophomore star
Marissa Irvin will return to campus
to participate in the rest of the sea
son's matches at the No. 1 position.
Irvin recently lost to Lindsay Daven
port, the world's second-ranked pro
fessional player, in two tight sets in
the second round of the Australian
Open.
With the return of Irvin, the top
ranked Cardinal should not have too
many challengers in the Pac-10, who
can compete with its depth.
"I'm really looking forward to
her return," Granville said, 'it
will just make the team that much
stronger and give us more confi
dence. We're really getting unified
as a team."
