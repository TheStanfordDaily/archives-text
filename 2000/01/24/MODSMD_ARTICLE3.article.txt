### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
The official end of the merger be
tween UCSF and Stanford medical
centers has been postponed one
month to Aug. 1, giving the unravel
ing merger an unexpected reprieve.
Despite the postponement of
the official end, Feb. 28 remains the
last day the merged institutions will
share losses from UCSF-Stanford.
As of Feb. 29, Stanford and
UCSF will each be responsible for
the losses generated by their own
facilities. UC Vice President
William Gurtner told the San Fran

cisco Examiner last Thursday.
Gurnter does not expect UCSF
to make money for at least two
years, he told the UC Regents on
Thursday.
Gurnter said the delay in the of
ficial breakup of the merger
stemmed from administrative diffi
culties including separate licenses
and billing numbers.
The decision to end the merger
between UCSF and Stanford was
officially announced on Nov. 28.
This decision came at the end of
a tumultuous two-year history for
the merged institution.
UCSF and Stanford joined in

November 1997 with the goals of
combating financial pressures and
improving clinical and academic
programs.
While the merger turned a mod
est profit its first year, UCSF-Stan
ford lost $10.7 million in the first fi
nancial quarter of 1999 and the or
ganization surpassed a predicted
$60-million loss for the 1999 fiscal
year by November.
Administrators responded by
cutting 2,000 positions at UCSF-
Stanford hospitals.
In a further cost-cutting move,
the merger closed inpatient and
emergencv-room services at the

UCSF / Mount Zion Medical ("en
ter and transferred them to the
UCSF Medical Center at Parnassus
Heights, two miles away. The hos
pital had been blamed for much of
the projected shortfall.
In a speech to the Faculty Senate
in. which he announced the merg
er's dissolution, Casper cited three
main reasons for the merger's fail
ure: under-reimbursement by the
state. Medicare cuts and the man
aged care market.
Casper also attributed the fail
ure to external financial pressures
and a failure to establish a new cul
ture within the new organization.
