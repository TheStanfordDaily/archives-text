### Amy Christeson Contributing writer 
This June, Stanford will hold the first truly in
ternational entrepreneurial conference and
challenge.
Put on by the Business Association of Stan
ford Engineering Students, the Global Entre
preneur Challenge could be one of the largest
student-run and organized functions at Stan
ford.
Ted Acworth, a doctoral student in the Me
chanical Engineering department at Stanford, is
the founder and developer of this "Olympic"
event among business planning competitions.
He is inviting all interested students, under
graduate or graduate, who would like to help or
ganize the Global Entrepreneur Challenge to an
informational session tonight.
The meeting, held at 7 p.m. in Gates room
801. will be a short introduction to the competi
tion.
This is not the first business plan challenge
that Stanford has seen. BASES has sponsored
the Stanford Entrepreneur Challenge for the
past four years.
Teams that have participated in Stanford's
challenges have gone on to be funded by both
"angels," or private investors, and venture capi

tal firms.
For the first time, though, BASES will spon
sor another challenge, which will be truly inter
national. More than 10 countries will be repre
sented by teams participating in the conference.
Norway, Germany, England. France, and per
haps Russia and India are sending teams to the
BASES Global Entrepreneur Challenge in
June.
Most of these countries have business plan
competitions of their own, and June's challenge
will simply be a bringing together of all of the
best of these competitions.
Acworth recently returned from Taipei and
Beijing, where he held press conferences to pre
sent the challenge. The conferences were cov
ered by major news networks and have excited
the nations' governments.
The Foreign Trade Minister of Taiwan told
Acworth that they want to win and are ready to
support the most qualified team.
More than half of each team must be made up
of students and the teams cannot receive any
outside funding. The 20 teams that will partici
pate must cither be invited to the conference or
submit requests that will be reviewed by the
challenge organizers. The team that wins the
competition in June will receive $250,000.
During the five-day conference in June, the

teams will be educated by "heavy hitters." ac
cording to Acworth.
Ernst & Young, Garage.com and the Ewing
Marion Kauffman Foundation, a philanthropic
entrepreneurial organization, have already
agreed to help put on the informational sessions
that the participating teams will attend each day.
In these sessions, the teams will be taught
how to run an effective business. They will learn
about marketing, securing finances through ini
tial public offerings and building qualified teams
of workers.
Acworth expects to see more than KM) stu
dents at the informational preview tonight. He
wants to get together the most qualified group of
students to make the event a success.
George Zachary of Mohr, David Ventures, a
major financial sponsor of the challenge, and the
presidents of BASES and the Business School's
Entrepreneurial Club will speak brietly.
There will be free dinner and drinks provid
ed.
There are all types of jobs available, from
small to large time commitments. The Global
Entrepreneur Challenge is a chance to learn
from experienced companies and get an insight
into the business world.
June's event will be covered by ABC and
many publications, according to Acworth.
