# Stanford employee is waging lonely presidential campaign
## 
### Lauren Phillips Staff writer 
While voters consider the dif
ferences between well-known
presidential hopefuls such as Bill
Bradley. Al Gore, George Bush
and John McCain, a small group of
lesser known candidates will ap
pear on the ballots of New Hamp
shire voters.
Among them is Stanford em
ployee Tom Koos, whose cam
paign from his Woodsidc home is
essentially a one-man operation.
Koos, who works as a Regulato
ry Compliance Specialist in the En
vironmental Health and Safety De
partment here at Stanford, is run
ning as a Democratic party candi
date for the presidency in the New
1 lampshire primaries.
His main motivation in starting
the campaign was to interest the
people around him in politics and
to learn more about the political
process.
"I think that I've always wanted
to do this, and living in Silicon Val
ley gives you the sense that you can
do anything." Koos said. "I feci as
if there's success in this campaign
because it's been an educational
process for me and those around
me."
Koos has spent most of his time
since his November decision to run
talking to people locally about the
political process and their con
cerns. frustrations and policy pref
erences.
The candidate has stated his
opinions on major policy-issues via
his Web page, www .tomkoos.com..
Among those he considers most
important are creating equal op
portunities through legislative ini
tiatives for all Americans. He is
also vocal about campaign finance
reform and considers the need for
public funding of elections a neces
sity for the protection of offices
from corruption.
"We have significant inequali
ties between populations. I'm in
terested in talking to people about
removing barriers to cqualiza

tion," he said. "We need to take ad
vantage of this time of prosperity."
Koos also has strong opinions
ahout gay rights and compares the
current policy debates about gays
in the military or gay marriage to
the sort of debates that polarized
the nation about race-based segre
gation in the past.
"We'll look back on this period
with shame, like we look at race re
lations 50 years ago," he said. He
has high hopes for a ballot initia
tive that would give Californians
the opportunity to legalize marital
rights for gays.
His previous political experi
ence has focused on issues within
his community regarding rights for
bicyclists and water regulation.
He chose to run in the New
Hampshire primary because of the
ease with which anyone can enter
the race there. Whereas states such
as New York have complicated
laws about the number and distrib
ution of signatures from resident
voters, New Hampshire's process
only requires an entrance fee.
"There's only one signature re
quired â€” mine on a check." he ex
