## Presidential hopefuls battle for Iowa's approval 
### 
DES MOINES, lowa (AP) —
On the eve of lowa's caucuses.
Republican and Democratic presi
dential candidates canvassed
churches and national talk shows
Sunday, scouring this snow-crusted
state for last-minute support even as
they began looking ahead to con
tests in New Hampshire and
beyond.
"This is the first step in several
steps of the journey," Bill Bradley,
the former New Jersey senator who
trails Vice President A 1 Gore in
Democratic polls, said on CBS.
Entering the first election contest
of Campaign 2000, Republican

George W. Bush and Gore held
wide leads in polls of voters who
planned to visit schools, civic clubs,
fire stations and other sites Monday
to support one of eight major con
testants.
The underdog candidates, all
resigned to losing, were shooting for
face-saving finishes and lowa's true
reward: Momentum for New Hamp
shire's Feb. 1 primary.
"This is a marathon, not a
sprint," said Republican Steve
Forbes on NBC's "Meet the Press."
The footrace in lowa, a test of
political organization, favors the
national front-runners. A Des

Moines Sunday Register poll of
1,200 likely caucus-goers showed
Gore leading Bradley among
Democrats 56 percent to 28 percent.
Bush led Forbes 43 percent to 20
percent in the Jan. 16-21 survey,
which had an error margin of plus or
minus 4 percentage points.
Bradley is in danger of finishing
worse than expected in a contest
that traditionally punishes candi
dates who fail to meet expectations.
I lis latest poll rating was beneath
the intentionally-low threshold his
advisers set as a measure of accom
plishment: The 31 percent showing
bv Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,

in a second-place finish behind then-
President Jimmy Carter in the 1980
caucuses.
With the rest of the GOP field in
single digits. Forbes has long said he
is the conservative alternative to
Bush. The argument would carry
greater weight if, after pouring mil
lions of dollars into lowa since his
failed 1996 bid, Forbes fares better
than the new poll suggests — 23
points behind Bush.
The polls show that about one in
10 voters are undecided, giving the
candidates incentive to campaign
hard Sunday.
"The only thing I know to do is to

encourage our folks to get out and
vote. We need as big a vote as possi
ble," Bush told reporters between
campaign stops.
In a lengthy interview with ABC,
Bush struggled with his explanation
for supporting a sales tax increase in
Texas after making a no-tax pledge.
The second-term governor said he
had qualified the promise by also
pledging to reform education fund
ing in the state, an effort that pre
sumably led to the tax proposal.
Dismissing the issue, Bush said
"There's pledges all the time" and
reviewed a record as governor that
included two major tax cuts.

He also continued to flesh out his
views on abortion, a critical issue to
many GOP caucus-goers. Asked
about the topic for the fourth day,
he predicted that Texas would out
law first-trimester abortions if the
Supreme Court reversed itself and
let states impose strict anti-abortion
laws — a position Bush says the
court should take.
Maintaining a caucus tradition,
several campaigns had supporters
papering churches and their parking
lots with leaflets. Religious conserva
tives represent a third of likely cau
cus-goers and are more likely than
most voters to attend the sessions.
