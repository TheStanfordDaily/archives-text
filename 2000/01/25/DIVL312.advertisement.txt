Expecting a tax refund this
year? IRS e-Jile is the fastest
way to get your money
back—in half the usual
time.
Or do you owe more tax?
You can e-file now, get quick
proof that your return is
accepted —then wait until
April 15th to pay.
One payment option
allows you to authorize a
withdrawal from your bank
account on the date you
choose, up to April 15th.
Another option allows you
to pay with your credit card.
For details, see your tax
professional.
