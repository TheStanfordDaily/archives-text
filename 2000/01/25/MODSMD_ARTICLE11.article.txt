The ASSU should
strive for efficiency

Perhaps not many students close
ly inspect their University bill
each quarter, but those who do
will notice that they pay $55 in ASSU
fees. When most people spend $55 on
something, they usually like to person
ally reap the benefits of that expendi
ture.
Students are allowed to request that
this fee is refunded to them, but if they
choose to do so they are warned that
their student identification numbers
will be given to groups who utilize
ASSU funds â€” thus jeopardizing their
ability to participate in activities that
these groups sponsor.
The majority of students choose not
to request that their ASSU funds be
refunded, however, and they are able

to enjoy the programs which the
ASSU sponsors. One recent example
of this is the Stanford After Midnight
program, and others include the
Online Draw Guide and the Online
Course Guide.
So students were justified in their
anger when the Online Course Guide
was not made available until after the
course "shopping" period had ended
this quarter, rendering it useless.
Though computer difficulties prompt
ed the delay, the ASSU needs to
ensure against such malfunctions in
the future. Students invest time and
effort to fill out the evaluations that
provide the content for the Guide.
They also pay for this service.
If the ASSU wishes to garner the
support of the student body, it must
continue to provide valuable services
in an efficient manner.
