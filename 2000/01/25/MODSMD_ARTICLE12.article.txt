University libraries
could better serve
Stanford community

The Stanford Libraries, specifi
cally Green and Meyer, are in
the midst of a transitional
year that has left a path of confusion
in its wake.
All reserve materials that once
resided in Meyer have been moved
to Green, leaving both the first and
third floors of Meyer empty. Hie
second floor still houses the lan
guage lab, computer clusters, class
rooms, dubbing instruments and
media viewing stations.
One problem is that the media
materials now reside in Green's
basement. Students must check
these materials out of Green and

then view them in Meyer. Once the
renovation of Green's basement is
complete, the viewing equipment
will reside there as well. The com
pletion of this renovation should be
made a priority.
Another priority should be better
communication with the Stanford
community about the events tran
spiring at the libraries. Much confu
sion could have been avoided had
the library announced its plans prior
to carrying them out.
The libraries, along with the
groups responsible for the Stanford
After Midnight program, might also
take into consideration keeping
Green open 24 hours a day in addi
tion to Meyer. The reason is that for
the time being, the resources avail
able at Green are far more valuable
than those at Meyer.
