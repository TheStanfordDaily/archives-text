Preserve Arboretum open
space
I would like the Stanford community to
be aware of a threat to the wonderful open
space that has existed since the founding of
the University as a green space separating
"town" from "gown."
Of particular value is the greenbelt that
now extends from the Shopping Center all
the way to College Terrace. Are we to see
the beginning of the end of this open space?
The current Stanford Draft Community
Plan carves two areas out of the open space
between the Ouad and El Camino Real.
These areas were included in a 1992 Plan
ning Office plan in the sections identified as
"Arboretum" and "Special Reserve and
Open Space."
The very large lot at the northwest cor
ner of Galvez and Campus Drive is now to
be in the area named "Campus Center"
while the area between the Hoover Pavil
ion and El Camino Real will now be called
"Quarry."
The former lot is across Campus Drive
from the enormous building that is being
built for the Alumni and Development

Offices, and I presume its reclassification
into the "Campus Center" area will permit
it to he paved over for parking. The section
along El Camino Real that is a part of the
greenbelt is designated for housing.
While the University needs both parking
lots and housing, these should not gradual
ly whittle away the Arboretum until it is
entirely replaced by parking lots and "nec
essary" buildings.
The only significant incursions into this
space over the 110-year life of the Universi
ty have been thd Hoover Pavilion (Palo
Alto Hospital) built in 1932 and the Little
field Business School building, which but
ted into the "lobe" of the Oval a few years
back.
Much as we need parking lots and hous
ing, we require open space for our well
being, too. The Stanford family created the
Arboretum to preserve open lands near the
Quad. Let us respect their creation and find
other space and other solutions to the hous
ing and parking needs of the University.

Plagiarism, org not a bad
idea for Stanford
Your editorial "No need for
plagiarism.org: Use of Web site to fight pla
giarism could undermine Honor Code"
(Nov. 15, 1999) surprised me very much.
You said that the rate of plagiarism at
Stanford "should be low" already, but you
did not seem to think that it is a problem that
the rate is higher than zero. I agree with you
that it would be naive to assume that a cam
pus as large as Stanford is free from plagia
rism. But it should be free from plagiarism.
There is an Honor Code. If there is plagia
rism, people are committing a double wrong:
they are both stealing and lying.
You said that exams are "left to trust" and
therefore papers should not be subject to
special treatment because it would send
mixed messages about the Honor Code. As
you know, exams and papers are written in
completely different environments using dif
ferent tools and with different time con
straints. The comparison is not valid.
My main point is that even if the compar
ison were valid, it does not matter to any
honest student what measures are taken

against plagiarism. The only effect plagia
rism.org can have on an honest student is to
maybe make that person feel pleased that a
cheater was caught.
Knowing almost nothing about plagia
rism.org, but knowing something about com
puters and students, I agree that no comput
er program can be a perfect tool for discov
ering plagiarism. Some cheaters will slip
through the cracks, as they always have, and
the rest of us can only hope that they will get
theirs someday.
The real problem — and the only objec
tion to plagiarism.org that I could support —
is the potential for the Web site to err in the
other direction and accuse an honest person
of plagiarizing. Plagiarism.org certainly
should not be used all by itself, and to my
knowledge, no one has suggested doing so.
If no one cheats at Stanford,
plagiarism.org will prove unnecessary, and its
use will be discontinued. If the Honor Code
is in fact not honored by all who purport to
adhere to it, why not catch the miscreants?
