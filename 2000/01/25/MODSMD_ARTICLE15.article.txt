# Outside the box
## Mike Rosenbluth It's all about being in the now 
### 
As I write this last
column of mine
in front of the
elegant gas fireplace at
Starbucks, I am actually
thinking about other
things. Though some peo
ple might admire my abil-

ity to juggle many things in my mind while
somewhat focusing on one, I find it a
rather disturbing habit that I am doing
more and more.
I write e-mail while talking on the
phone, I talk on the phone while cleaning
my room, 1 clean my room while chatting
with a friend, I chat with a friend while
doing the crossword, and I do the cross
word while listening to lecture (which
arguably might be construed as doing only
one thing).
I don't think this is a personal problem.
1 have a friend who tends to wander onto
the newest online music store or
finance.yahoo.com while talking on the
phone. I don't especially blame him.
Though you'd think that a phone conver
sation is interesting enough to hold your
attention, it is often difficult to ignore a 25-
inch screen with access to a world of infor
mation sitting in front of you.
The technology that is connecting us all
together is also separating us (I know, 1 am
so deep). Take cell phones, for instance.
This quarter, I have noticed that a signifi
cant percentage of my classmates own
them (and leave them on during class so
everybody knows they have a cell phone).

This percentage greatly varies depending
on the class, from about 0 percent in my
Introduction to Hinduism course to about
75 percent in my Introduction to High
Technology Entrepreneurship class (hmm.
funny coincidence).
I also see more and more people talking
on cell phones while walking between
classes and even while riding their bikes.
As a side note, I beg that all people wear
ing bike helmets (a.k.a. grad students) ,
please do not try to do this for the sake of
campus safety.
Last week, I was wishing that I had a
cell phone so that I could call my sister
while going to lunch on an especially busy
day. Is my life really so busy that I don't
have time to call when I get home?
Maybe. But it must still be possible to
enjoy a brief walk between classes under a
light unending drizzle. A professor of mine
was telling our class about a venture capi
talist who scheduled his day in five-minute
intervals. I couldn't help thinking how
incredibly happy I am that I am not that
venture capitalist.
From next week's midterms to the
plight of the Coffee House, there are a lot
of things to prevent us from concentrating
on what is going on now and being present.
I know that in my group of friends the
great fear of what will happen come June
and graduation is one of the things dis
tracting them from what is going on with
their lives.
Being busy always presents itself as a
great detractor, drawing us from what we

are doing to what we need to be doing
tomorrow or next week. While it is a com
fort to imagine spring break in Mexico
while doing endless problem sets, it proba
bly isn't a good way to live. If you aren't
putting your focus into what you are doing,
what is the point?
Now 1 understand this isn't true with
everything (1 can lather and sing in the
shower at the same time), but with most
things it is. As my coffee buddy put it, fail
ing to be present allows you to abandon
one of the most important things in your
life: a sense of peace. Though doing multi
ple things at once may allow you to save
time, it also could result in you completing
an entire quarter and wondering where
exactly you were for eight weeks of it (this
feeling can also be a result of binge drink
ing).
I know you might be thinking that the
point of this column is obvious. And it is.
But in a world of busy-ness with little time
to relax, we can forget about what is going
on right now. Instead of dwelling on the
past or future, focus on the now. It is the
only thing we will ever experience. Thank
you, and I will see you all on the flip side.

Mike Rosenbluth thanks you all for read
ing his 4,000-to-4,500 character columns
every Tuesday. He also wants to thank
Kimberly Downs, his opinions editor, who
would like to remind everyone that proper
AP writing style requires that you spell out
all numbers between 1 and 10.
