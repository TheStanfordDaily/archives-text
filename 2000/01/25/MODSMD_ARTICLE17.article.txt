### Maren Ewers 
The sun shone on the No. 3 Stan
ford women's swimming and diving
team this weekend as it won two
home dual meets against the Ari
zona and Arizona State.

WOMEN'S SWIM

■ Saturday: No. 3 Stanford (4-0) 131
No. 2 Arizona (7-2) 112.

■ Friday: Stanford 147. No. 18 Ari
zona State (3-2) 92.

The women's swimming and
diving team has historically been a
top NCAA team, placing in the top
three at the NCAA championships
for the last eight years. After this
weekend, it looks as if Stanford's
tradition of dominance in swim
ming is nowhere near its end. With
the two wins, Stanford improves to
4-0 on the season.
On Saturday, the Cardinal
reigned victorious over the No. 2
Arizona Wildcats, 131-112.
"U of A was an important meet
for us," said co-captain Gabrielle
Rose. "They are the top-ranked
team in the Pac-10, and 1 think we
swam very well. We are competing
with only 12 healthy swimmers
right now, and we were able to
dominate many of the events. This
weekend put us in a good position
for the rest of the season."
The Stanford women, refusing
to bend to the Arizona Wildcat
squad, won 10 of the meet's 13
events.
Sophomore Shelly Ripple
achieved automatic NCAA quali
fying times in the 200 butterfly (1
minute, 59.24 seconds) and the 100
backstroke leadoff leg of the
team's. 400 medley relay. Ripple

also pulled to a victory in the 200 in
dividual medley (2:01.80). Junior
Misty Hyman won the 200 freestyle
in a time of 1:48.14, and attained
the automatic NCAA qualifying
time in the 200 backstroke
(1:56.76).
Other Stanford first-place fin
ishes came from junior Siobhan
Cropper, who doubled in the 50
freestyle (23.17) and the 100
freestyle (50.54), sophomore Jessi
ca Foschi, who picked up a pair of
victories in the 500 freestyle
(4:49.08) and 1,000 freestyle
(9:54.23), Kim Powers in three
meter diving (450.75 points) and
the Cardinal's 400 medley relay
team (3:40.92) of Ripple, Rose,
Hyman and Cropper.

Hyman was very pleased with
the outcome of the meet.
"We were really pumped for this
weekend," she said. "And Satur
day's meet against Arizona was
probably the most fun I've had at a
dual meet. The stands were full of
parents, friends and other Stanford
fans, and it was inspiring to see such
a large supporting crowd."
Though the competition was less
fierce for Friday's dual meet, the
team cruised to a 147-92 victory
over No. 18 Arizona State on Fri
day, winning 11 out of 13 events.
Hyman achieved automatic
NCAA qualifying times in both the
200 butterfly (1:57.32) and in the
100 backstroke leadoff in the 400
medley relay (54.71). She was also

victorious in the 200 individual
medley (2:01.73).
"It was great that Shelly and 1
were able to make a few automatic
qualifying times this weekend,"
said Flyman of the NCAA cuts. "It
looks like our training is beginning
to pay off."
Other winners against ASU in
cluded Ripple, who won the 200
freestyle (1:49.74), 200 backstroke
(2:00.66) and swam the 100 butter
fly leg of the 4(H) medley relay team,
while Foschi dominated the meet's
two long distance events, winning
