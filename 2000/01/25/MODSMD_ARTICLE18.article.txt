### Scott Finkelstein 
The No. 12 Stanford men's gym
nastics team fell once again to No. 10
California this weekend at Burnham
Pavilion. The Bears (4-0, 4-0 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) easily
outscored the Cardinal (1-2,1-2) by a
tally of 221.70 to 215.65.
California jumped to the lead
after the first event and never lost it.

Cal senior Tal Moscowitz per
formed solid routines to lead his team
to victory and earn himself top hon
ors in the all-around with a score of
55.875.
Leading the way for Stanford was
sophomore David Durante. Du
rante's strong performances earned
him third-place honors in the all
around with a 53.45.
Other Cardinal highlights includ-

Ed junior co-captain Rico Andrade
on the rings (9.45) and senior co-cap
tain Craig Nesbitt on the parallel bars
(9.45). Both gymnasts earned first
place honors for their respective rou
tines.
Despite these outstanding perfor
mances, the Cardinal hit only 33 per
cent of its routines.
"We were disappointed. We
wanted to do better," Andrade said.
Although this weekend's final
score reflects a large seven-point gap
between the rival teams, Stanford did
show significant signs of improve
ment since its first meet.

MEN'S GYMNASTICS

■ Saturday: No. 10 California (4-0)
221.70, No. 12 Stanford (1-2) 215.65.

"I saw a lot of improvement in just
one week,'" said Stanford head coach
Sadao Hamada. "1 liked what I saw
during warmups. Its just a matter of
time before we put it all together in
competition."
Every year the men's gymnastics
team has the same slow start. And
every year, the team is a contender
for the NCAA title in the postseason.
"The team is coming along and
with Sadao's plan we should be right
on track to place high by the end of
the season," Durante said.
"This week is going to be a tough
week of practice, but it is the only way
that we are going to be able to com
pete with the top (gymnastics]
schools in the country."
The Cardinal squad did not take
long to began practicing again. Be
fore the final results were announced
on Saturday night, several Cardinal
gymnasts were on the apparatus, al
ready working to improve their prob
lem areas.
"I'm ready to get back into the
gym and work out," said junior Jason
Biltz.
The team is prepared to begin its
second week of training with addi
tional morning workouts. Overall fa
tigue levels should drop as the gym
nasts get accustomed to their training
schedule.
