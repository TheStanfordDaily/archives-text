Although the Cardinal had a
strong showing and improved on its
team score from its previous meet,
there is still room to improve its con
sistency, execution and difficulty be
fore it hosts Washington and contin
ues its quest to reach the "Super Six"
NCAA team finals.
The Cardinal is on its way to be
coming a contender for the Pacific 10
conference title. According to junior
and 19% Canadian Olympian Jen
nifer Exaltaction, the meet was "a
step in the right direction."
Stanford was led by the steady all
around performances of freshman
phenom Abby Gair (38.8), Exalta
cion (38.65) and sophomore star
Katy Herbert (38.2).
Gair, who competed at home for
the first time, described her experi
ence as "awesome."
"It really feels good to be able to
contribute to the team," Gair said.
The meet started out well for the
Cardinal, which was led by the per
formance of senior All-American
Larissa Fontaine. Fontaine, the 1998
N4£A A Vault Champion, woa=±he

vault title with a championship-cal
iber performance on the event, scor
ing a 9.925.
Also stepping up for the Cardinal
on vault was Exaltacion (9.65) and a
paire of freshman standouts, Kelsey
Stillinger (9.65) and Alissa Cooper
(9.625).
The Cardinal advanced to un
even bars, where it shined. Every
performer recorded season highs on
the event. Gair won the uneven bar
title with a near perfect 9.9. Her suc
cess was followed with three 9.85s
from Exaltacion, Cooper and senior
Sarah Harding.
The Cardinal then took its cam
paign to the balance beam, where its
performance was shaky, counting
two falls on the event. Sophomore
Becky Meldrum continued her con
sistent performance, posting a 9.725.
Gair also contributed a 9.725 to add
another bright spot to the rotation.
The Cardinal, despite the disap
pointment, remain confident in its
ability.
"I know we can do better than
that," said Stillinger, whose 9.875
performance clinched the beam title.
The Cardinal fought back on the
floor excercise, with Fontaine win
ning the title by posting a 9.875 per
formance. The former World Cham
pionship Team member entertained
the crowd with a new floor routine
that included a more complicated
first tumbling pass. Fontaine, a
Chicago-native, picked a "Blues
Brothers" rendition of "Peter
Gunn" for her music and featured
choreography by teammate Hard
mg.
"It was an experience Id compete
on floor at home. Because of injuries
last year. I was unable to compete at
home. It's great to be back,"
Fontaine said.
Exaltacion also thrived on floor
by demonstrating why she was the
three-time Canadian national floor
champion with a score of 9.8. The ju
nior star treated the crowd to a new.
stylish and more difficult routine.
"It was really fun to show my new
floor routine, especially when the
crowd got intoit," Exaltacion said. "I
was really happy to hit my second

tumbling pass."
Meldrum was proud of the team's
performance.
"Even though beam was a little
rough, we were able to stay together
as a team and focus on what we were
doing."
"I was really proud of how well
the team did. It was a great team ef
fort," echoed freshman Lauren
Gleitman.
The Cardinal will focus on execu
tion and consistency in practice this
week. A number of gymnasts are
working on new skills and combina
tions that they hope to add to their
routines soon.
The Cardinal will host the Uni
versity of Washington on Friday at
7:30 p.m. at Burnham Pavilion.
