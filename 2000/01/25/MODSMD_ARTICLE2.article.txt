# Fines will fight fires
## Stanford amends tampering rules in wake of deadly blaze at Seton Hall By Durant Gipson 
### 
In light of a fatal fire at a Seton Hall University dor
mitory last week, Student Housing Services officials
will amend the wording of the document that outlines
fire safety regulations for University dormitories.
In a meeting yesterday, officials voted to amend
Housing Policies and Services to specify a $500 fine for
tampering with fire equipment. The new policy will
take effect next year.
According to an Associated Press report, after sev
eral false alarms during the semester, many students in
the six-story Boland Hall at Seton Hall, a New Jersey
university, ignored a fire alarm and did not evacuate
the building until too late. Three people died and 58
were injured in the blaze.
.Student Housing Services annually updates its
housing policies, and this year, after the tragedy.
Assoc. Dir. of Student Housing Services Diana Con
klin said, "awareness is heightened." The new wording
was drafted by Conklin, who is also the graduate hous
ing operations manager, and Undergraduate Housing
Operations Manager Imogen Church.
The $500 fine replaces the current wording, which
merely states that "violators will be subject to substan
tial fines."
Stanford's Department of Public Safety issues the
"Safety Almanac" to each student at the beginning of
each year. It also plays its part by coordinating evacu
ation drills at the start of each school year in October.
Dan Smith, special services manager at the Stan

ford Department of Public Safety, said, "residences
typically do very well" in the evacuation drills.
Officials aren't as concerned with evacuation as
they are with debris. Alison Pena, assistant University
fire marshal, said the most common violation of the
fire codes are items in corridors and stairways. There is
absolutely "no storage allowed in the corridors or
stairways," she said.
Clark Vitt, facilities supervisor for Wilbur Hall and
Mirrielees House, agreed. "Absolutely nothing should
be in the hallways. It takes one person stumbling and
falling" to cause a major disaster.
Other fire code violations include discharging fire
extinguishers and removing exit signs and evacuation
maps.
Pena described the fire codes as "a collection of
conditions and regulations to ensure a minimum level
of safety." She added that Stanford has gone beyond
the law's requirements by retrofitting undergraduate
residences with sprinkler systems when undergoing
the Capital Improvement Program.
Workers will retrofit Toyon Hall and Branner Hall
when each enters CIP, in the summer of 2000 and the
summer of 2001, respectively. Wilbur Hall has not
been retrofitted, though its capital improvement oc
curred in 1992. Officials promise to retrofit it in the fu
ture.
Students don't seem too concerned with fire safety.
"Even though we don't have sprinklers, we have a
number of safety measures in place [so] I'm not con
cerned about it," said Peter Berg, a junior majoring in
Mathematical and Computational Science and resi
dent of Toyon Hall.
Most dormitories house fire safety measures in
cluding fire extinguishers, lighted exit signs, fire alarm
system, sprinklers, evacuation maps and smoke detec
tors.
