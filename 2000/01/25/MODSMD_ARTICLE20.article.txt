The Stanford men's swim team split the weekend with a 126-116 victory over Arizona State on Friday,
followed by Saturday's 124-119 loss to the Arizona Wildcats. Today, the Cardinal faces the University of
the Pacific at 2 p.m. at deGuerre pool.
zona's Ryk Neethling proved to he a
strong force for the Wildcats.
The 1999 NCAA Swimmer of the
Year lived up to his accolades, taking
first place in three freestyle events.
He won both the 1,000-meter and
the 200-meter freestyles, and beat ju
nior Ail-American Adam Messner
in the 500-meter freestyle.
Although the Cardinal came up
short against Arizona, the team felt
that it swam reasonably well.
"We were probably better pre
pared for Arizona [than Arizona
State]," said junior Anthony Robin
son. "They are very strong in-season
swimmers and have a lot of dual
meet experience."
Both Neethling and Messner re
ceived automatic NCAA qualifying
times in the 200-meter freestyle.
"|Neethling] swam very well."
Robinson said, "lie definitely
played a big part in Arizona's suc
cess."
Taking first place for Stanford
against Arizona were junior AII-
American Steven Brown in the 200-
meter individual medley, freshman
Randall Bal in the 200-meter back
stroke and junior All-American and
co-captain Rob Canales in the 200-
meter breaststroke.
Alter Canales' win in the 200
breaststroke, the score was tied at
113 points. The deciding factor in the
meet was the last event — the 400-
meter freestyle relay. The Arizona
relay team pulled out the win in the

relay and secured the Wildcat victo
ry*
In Friday's matchup. Stanford
beat Arizona State by a score of 126-
116. but the 10-point margin was not
indicative of the Cardinal's over
powering performance. Stanford
won seven of the nine individual
events.
' We definitely swam well this
weekend." Robinson said. "It was a
good start. We're still in good shape
for the Pac-io."
Leading the charge for the Cardi
nal was Messner, who was victorious
in both the 200-meter freestyle and
the 500-meter freestyle.
Other Cardinal contributors were
Brown and Canales, who won the
200-meter butterfly and the 200-
meter breaststroke. respectively
Freshmen (ireg Long, Dan West
colt and Bal also had key wins for
Stanford. Long won the 1.000-meter
freestyle, while Bal took first in the
50-meter freestyle and Westcott won
the 200-meter backstroke.
Even though Arizona State won
both the 400-meter medley relay and
the 400-meter freestyle relay — the
first and last events of the day — it
was not enough to overcome the
powerful Cardinal.
The Cardinal takes on the Uni
versity of the Pacific today at 2 p.m.
The Stanford team will use the meet
against the unranked Tigers as a
good opportunity to gain dual meet
experience.
" The meet will be good racing ex
perience for lis. to help us get ready
for USC and Cal [next month],"
Robinson said.
