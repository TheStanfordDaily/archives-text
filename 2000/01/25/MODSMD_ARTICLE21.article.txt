■ Saturday: Stanford 31, UC-San
Diego 3.

Following up a strong showing

the previous weekend against St.
Mary's, Stanford (4-0, 1-0 Pacific
Coast League) came out Saturday
with the same high degree of
hunger and emotion. But as op
posed to last week, when St. Mary's
rolled over rather quickly in the
face of the Cardinal's intensity,
UCSD met the team's push with
one of their own.
Yet the Tritons, who are playing
their first year of Division 1 rugby
following back-to-back national
championships in Division 11, were

simply unable to keep up with the
Cardinal talent-wise.
"UCSD put a lot of pressure on
us in the first half," said head coach
Franck Boivert. "But we still domi
nated. especially on defense."
Despite this domination, Stan
ford had some trouble putting
points on the board early. At the
same time, though, it forced numer
ous Triton turnovers, not letting
UCSD get into a rhythm on of
fense.
The Cardinal soon parlayed its
defensive excellence into points,
building up a 19-3 lead at the half.
"In rugby, like in all sports, a
team's defense influences its of
fense," Boivert said. "And on Sat
urday our defense let our offense
come easily."
In the second half, with the game
in hand. Stanford kept the heat on,
outscoring the Tritons 12-0 to win
by the final 28-point margin.
While the Cardinal played a
good match overall, there were cer
tainly many areas that the squad
must improve upon before confer
ence play begins.
"There was a lot of waste to our
game," Boivert said.
The most noticeable "waste" for
Stanford was the excessive number
of penalties it received. The Cardi
nal finished the game with 25 penal
ties, as opposed to just six for the
Tritons.
"We need to find the right bal
ance between being ferocious and

being clear-headed." Boivert said.
Hopefully, the Cardinal can find
that balance before Saturday, when
the Arizona Wildcats, one of the
nation's top six teams, comes to
Stanford.
The Cardinal knows what it's
like to be a top-ranked team, hav
ing spent 10 years in the national
top five before a disappointing sea
son last year.
How Stanford performs next
Saturday will reveal whether this
squad is on the same level as Cardi
nal teams of the past.
One area where this year's team
certainly lives up to — and.in the
opinion of its coach, surpasses —
Stanford's teams of the '90s is the
ferocity with which it approaches
defense.
"This team is very hungry to
make the tackles," Boivert said.
"Which is something we've never
had at Stanford."
The Cardinal is going to need to
carry over this aggression into the
Arizona matchup, as it puts its un
blemished record on the line in a
game which should be a strong indi
cator of how the team will fare in
the postseason.
