### Mark Boucher 
The Stanford Debate Team, led
by the pairing of seniors David

Gamage and
Matt Spence,
competed at
World Universi
ties Debating
Championship,
held in Sydney.
Australia, Jan.
4-12. As a two
person team.

Gamage and Spence garnered sev
enth place overall, and Gamage
placed 10th individually in the
competition.
This individual performance
was the best by any American since
1995, and as a team, Gamage and
Spence also finished higher than
any American team since 1995.
"1 got to meet people from all
over the world and re-meet people
I had met before," said Gamage.
"It was exciting to do well."
The teams debated matters in
current events, addressing mostly
issues of economics and politics.
Topics included the role of the
World Trade Organization, the
right to privacy versus corporate

use of personal data and the recon
ciliation of women's rights and reli
gious doctrine.
The tournament also featured
one humor round in which a frivo
lous topic not related to current
events is debated.
Five other Stanford students
also competed in the tournament.
The team of junior Laura Brown
and sophomore Amer Ahmed
placed 35th overall.
The team of education doctoral
student Ben Bolger and sociology
doctoral student Erik Benson also
competed, and sophomore
Jonathan Dunn attended as a
judge.
The World Universities Debat
ing Championship is an annual
competition featuring more than
300 teams from English-speaking
countries including the United
States, the United Kingdom, Aus
tralia, Singapore, South Africa and
Pakistan.
The University of Sydney host
ed the tournament, which switches
locations every year.
The championship uses the
world parliamentary style of de
bate.
Under this format, four two

person teams compete in each
match, with two on the government
side and two on the opposition
side.
After a resolution on a specific
topic is introduced, each team has
15minutes to prepare its case. The
government teams support the res
olution and the opposition teams
oppose it.
Each team is given points for
both "manner" and "matter," as
they are judged on their speaking
ability as well as their presentation
of solid facts and a coherent argu
ment.
After nine preliminary rounds,
the 32 teams who have accumulat
ed the most total points continue to
the elimination rounds.
In these rounds the top half of
the teams advances, while the bot
tom half is eliminated.
The process continues until the
final round of four teams, after
which one team is declared the win
ner.
This year, Laverne University, a
small college near Los Angeles,
placed second, the best spot for an
American school. Monache Uni
versity in Australia won the tour
nament.

According to Brown, (he team's
publicity director, the tournament
also offered a chance for socializing
and for meeting other debaters
from around the world.
It featured both planned and in
formal social events including din
ner with various ambassadors and a
cruise of Sydney Harbor. Students
also visited Sydney area pubs and
restaurants.
"This year, several team mem
bers went early for [the] New
Year's [celebration]," Brown said.
At last year's tournament, held
in Manila, one of the Stanford
teams advanced to the round of 32.
The debate team sends several
members to the tournament every
year, in addition to its slate of
American tournaments.
Last weekend, Stanford deba
tors traveled to Massachusetts for
the Amherst College Invitational.
Spence and Gammage placed
fourth overall at the tournament,
and the team of Ahmed and Ben
son took seventh.
Four Stanford novice teams also
placed in the top 10.
"It was a great performance,"
Spence said, "because the team did
well across the board."
