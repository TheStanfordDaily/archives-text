## Campus groups collaborate to educate community on opportunities abroad 
### Derek Fears 
A host of campus groups are
pooling resources this week to en
courage members of the Stanford
community to pursue international
opportunities.
The Overseas Studies Program,
Overseas Resource Center, Un
dergraduate Research Opportuni
ties, the Career Development Cen
ter and Volunteers in Asia are
coming together to sponsor World
Opportunities Week 2000
(WOWeek) on various campus lo
cations.
In previous years, WOWeek has
been held during fall quarter, but it

was moved to January this year be
cause of staff changes in the various
student overseas centers.
Though attendance is down due
to rain this week, there is still a
wide array of available opportuni
ties for interested students to look
into.
According to Lian Adams, a
staff member at the ORC,
WOWeek, the program offers stu
dents a chance to familiarize them
selves with overseas options.
"[WOWeek| has been a good
opportunity for early outreach to
students who are thinking about
studying or working abroad."
Adams also noted that in the

past, the various workshops and
seminars throughout the campus
have been well attended.
URO Director Laura Selznick
said that by bringing the various
campus groups together under one
setting, "WOWeek is a great way to
raise the consciousness of students
about what overseas opportunities
are available to them."
Such opportunities include in
ternships, grants and study-abroad
programs in various international
locations.
Because of the collaboration be
tween the various student groups,
WOWeek is able to reach a wide
array of student interests.

During this week, many differ
ent overseas options will be ad
dressed.
Today, there will be various
panels on short-term work abroad,
and tomorrow, there will be vari
ous informational panels dealing
with study-abroad programs and
also an informational panel about
career opportunities in interna
tional business.
On Thursday, a panel will ad
dress careers in international pub
lic service.
Friday the panels will speak
about one- to two-year opportuni
ties abroad available for recent
graduates.
