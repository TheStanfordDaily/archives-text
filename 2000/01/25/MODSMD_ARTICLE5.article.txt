# All apologies
## Junior helps unique exhibit 
### Lauren Phillips Staff writer 
"Imagine a room full of letters of
apology."
This sentence has inspired a San
Francisco publisher—and her Stan
ford intern — to undertake a project
of immense proportion: an anonoy
mous place for people to apologize
for their wrong-doings and for those
who come to feel apologized to.
K. Janene-Nelson, a senior editor
for Mercury House, a non-profit lit
erary publishing company in San
Francisco, was driven to create an
exhibit dedicated to apologies by a
radio program about a New York
man who set up an answering ma
chine for people to make anony
mous apologies in the 1980s.
The idea has blossomed, and
Janene-Nelson is now creating
"Apologia," accepting anonymous
letters that will be collected and or
ganized into an enormous display of
apology which is intended to fill a
room with reconciliation.
"It's meant to be a quiet place,
where people can feel apologized to
for wrongs that have been done
against them that they will never re
ceive an [apology for it]," Janene-
Nelson said. "It's a reminder that we
are really all connected — that we
have common faults."
Stanford junior David Yeh, a
psychology major, became involved
in the project this summer. He
helped Janene-Nelson with re
search, planning and publicity both
in San Francisco and outside the city.
He was interested in the purpose of
the project: reconciliation and ad
dressing bonds between people.
"The project is so unusual be
cause it appeals to people's humani
ty without commercializing it," Yeh
said. "The themes are things that
everybody shares, and even though
its faceless, people can relate to it."
The submissions received thus
far have varied widely in both their
form and content. While some have
been carefully and poetically craft
ed, others have been filled with

scratched-out words or grammatical
errors. One was constructed with
cut-out letters, like a ransom note.
"What I'm hoping for is a spread
of topics and subjects," Janene-Nel
son said. "Deep meaningful apolo
gies mixed in with the smaller, but
not necessarily less meaningful,
apologies."
Janene-Nelson hopes to address
the significance of the secrets that
people carry around with them and
never confront, giving people an
outlet to. unburden. Many of the
submissions thus far have focused
on personal or familial relationships.
"There will be more letters in the
room than anyone would ever read.
But the idea is that you walk into the
room and feel surrounded... nearly
on a spiritual level," she said. "I
think that people should take more
responsibility for their own actions,
and you have to solve your own
problems before you can solve any
thing larger."
Publicity for the exhibit is cur
rently the top priority. Janene-Nel
son is soliciting many more submis
sions through radio programs, news
paper publicity, her Web page
(www.slip-net/~apologia), flyers
and word of mouth.
When a sufficient number of sub
missions have been gathered and the
design plans are finished, she will
look for gallery space in San Francis
co: ideally a completely empty white
room where she can display the let
ters at eye-level in a large circle. The
inner part of the circle may include
allusions to Greek conceptions of
hell and punishment.
"I want to acknowledge our dark
side: we all have good and evil with
in us," she said. "We have to be cog
nizant of our more negative
thoughts and ideas."She hopes to
stage the exhibit by the fall of 2(X)1.
Anyone interested in making a
contribution to "Apologia" may
send letters to P.O. Box 190456, San
Francisco, CA 94119-0456 and look
at the web-page for further informa
tion about joining the informational
mailing list.
