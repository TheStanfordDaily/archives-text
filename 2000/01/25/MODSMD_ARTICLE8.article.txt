### 
DES MOINES, lowa (AP) — Demo
crat A 1 Gore and Republican George W.
Bush won the lowa caucuses Monday
night, validating their front-runner status
in the opening contest of the 2000 presi
dential election season. Gore won big over
Bill Bradley while Bush overcame a strong
second-place showing by conservative
publisher Steve Forbes.
"I can't wait to get to New Hamp
shire." Gore told The Associated Press as
he thanked lowa Democrats and looked
ahead to next week's more dramatic show
down.
Bush and Forbes both expressed satis
faction with the Republican results.
"It's a solid victory and I'm grateful,"
the Texas governor told AP, calling the
victory a "record-shattering" validation of
his compassionate conservative agenda.
Forbes said, "we vastly overperformed the
polls and have emerged as a conservative
candidate" going into New Hampshire.
In a sign of the tit-for-tat to come, Gore
accused Bradley of "going negative" in the
final days of the lowa race — and said the
tactic backfired.

"I think it was a mistake for his cam
pagn to go to the so-called negative
approach but I'm not complaining," Gore
said. "But based on what I've heard from
from the voters out here they didn't expect
that and didn't like it.'
In lowa, Gore was running about two
to-one against Bradley according to sam
ple precincts.
The caucuses were expected to draw no
more than 1(X),(XX) voters from each party,
concluding a lengthy runup of debates,
fund raising and grass-roots campaigning
here. lowa launches the presidential race
into a frantic six-week stretch, with the
New Hampshire primary a week away.
With results from 80 percent of lowa's
counties. Bush had support from 41 per
cent of the caucus participants and Forbes
30 percent. Former Amb. Keyes was a
respectable third at 14 percent, with Gary
Bauer at 9 percent, John McCain 5 and
Orrin Hatch just 1.
Forbes mounted, and funded, a partic
ularly vigorous campaign here, calling on
fundamentalist and conservative support
to the more moderate Bush. Sen. John

McCain declined to campaign here, but
the Arizona Republican was still listed on
ballots. Keyes bested Bauer in the drive
for support from conservative social
activists. Hatch never gained a constituen
cy and was sure to review his candidacy.
In the Democratic race. Gore's victory
blunted Bradley's challenge going into
New Hampshire next week where Bradley
has polled even with Gore, or even ahead.
lowans were attending caucuses at
2,100 sites across the sprawling state. In a
display of basic grass-roots politics, voters
here brave the winter weather and visit
classrooms, libraries, fire stations, church
basements, grain co-ops and even a few
private homes to play their unique role in
the American political system.
The process will yield 47 delegates to
the Democratic convention and 25 dele
gates to the GOP convention, a tiny frac
tion of the total a candidate needs to win
the nomination.
An AP analysis showed that Bush was
likely to earn 11 delegates of lowa's 25
nominating delegates, compared to seven
for Forbes, four for Keves. two for Bauer

and one for McCain.
In an interview. Bush said, "I am hum
bled and honored about the outpouring of
support.
"We have a record-shattering victory
tonight. I'm grateful for the outpouring of
support my message of compassionate
conservatism has received, and I'm look
ing forward to taking it to the state of New
Hampshire."
Bush noted that the highest percent
age achieved by a GOP victor in lowa
was 37.4. when eventual nominee Bob
Dole beat Pat Robertson in 1988. Robert
son's 24.6 percent was a surprise, and it
staggered the candidacy of then-Vice
President George Bush, who came in
third.
Bradley faltered in his effort to propel
his challenge to Gore on the Democratic
side.
Hours before the voting, Forbes said he
would "feel good about a good, strong sec
ond." Bradley indicated he was in for the
long haul: "The longer the competition
goes, the better chance that candidate is
eoini» to have ... in the fall."
