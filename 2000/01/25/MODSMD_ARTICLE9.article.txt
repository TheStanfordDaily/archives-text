RATCH ABURI, Thailand
(AP) — Thai security forces
stormed a hospital Tuesday where
heavily armed insurgents from
Myanmar had trapped hundreds of
patients, visitors and staff in a 22-
hour hostage drama.
Automatic weapons fire crack
led and explosions thudded from
inside the hospital, possibly from

grenades or mines that the hostage
takers had rigged after taking it
over Monday morning.
Reporters in front of the sprawl
ing hospital compound throughout
the daylong crisis had been steadily
moved back by police. When the
assault began, journalists could see
trucks and jeeps filled with police
and soldiers speeding into the

walled, six-acre hospital com
pound.
Sporadic gunfire and occasional
explosions were still ringing out
over the compound more than 15
minutes after the operation began.
There were no initial reports on
casualties in the attack, which was
launched in the predawn hours.
The rebels belonging to God's

Army, an insurgent group led by
12-year-old twins, took the
hostages in an attempt to pressure
the Thai government to help their
beleaguered movement.
In the past week, God's Army
has come under sustained attack by
troops from Myanmar — formerly
known as Burma — at their jungle
base near the border, driving at

least 1 .IKK) minority Karen refugees
into Thailand. Thai troops have
fired artillery to prevent the fight
ers from crossing over the border.
After the hospital was seized,
army commander Gen. Surayud
Chulanond said Thailand would
stop its shelling, allow civilians
refuge and let injured guerrillas
receive treatment in Thai hospi

tals. Rebels seeking refuge would
have to surrender their arms.
The rebels released at least 40
patients Monday afternoon, some
in exchange for food, and dozens
of others escaped. Those freed
included a pregnant 18-year-old
who went into labor and an 8-year
old boy in a coma after brain
surgery.
