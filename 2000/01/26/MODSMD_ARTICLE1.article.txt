# Influential thinker, writer's papers joining Hoover Archives

### T.J. Babbitt Editorial staff 
The Hoover Institution has ac
quired the papers of American so
cial philosopher Eric 1 loffer and is
now making them available to the
public. Many of his notes, letters and
rough drafts are now accessible for
the first time.

Holler was most well known for
his 1951 book "The True Believer:
Thoughts on the Nature of Mass
Movements," which ruminated on
the types of personalities that were
drawn to extremist political move
ments of the right and left.
The book, which sold widely and
became a standard in many college
courses, posited that people who be

lieve zealously in a cause share many
personality traits, even when (he
causes they support could not be
more different.
Among other things, his works
concentrated on the common char
acteristics of mass movements, the
driving forces of societal change and
the nature of violence.
Hoffer, who was largely self-edu
cated and reveled in his working
class background, gave many talks at
both UC-Berkeley and Stanford be
fore his death in 1983 at the age of 80,
and was respected and liked among
the students and faculty of both
schools.
"He would come and talk to sem
inars and was incredibly generous
with his time with students at Stan
ford and at Berkeley," said Elena
Danielson, an archivist at Hoover
who is overseeing the new Hoffer
collection.
Danielson said Hoffer's personal
papers were particularly interesting
because Hoffer tended to write
aphoristically, synthesizing his
thoughts into pithy quotes and witty
observations, many of which have
never before been made public or
been published.
One of his most famous quotes is
typical: "We can be absolutely cer
tain only about things we do not un
derstand,'' he wrote in"The True
Believer."
Hoffer was blinded by an acci
dent at age 7, which kept him out of
school. Though his vision returned
at age 15, he stayed out of academia
and instead made a life for himself
with odd jobs and manual labor. In
1943 he came to San Francisco and
became a longshoreman, spending
after-work hours in the San Francis
co Public Library reading and re
searching.
I loover purchased the collection
from Lili Fabilli Osborne, a resident
of San Francisco and old friend of
Hoffer's, for an undisclosed amount.
