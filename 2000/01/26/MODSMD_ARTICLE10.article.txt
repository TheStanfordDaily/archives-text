# Elian Gonzalez to meet with grandmothers
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Under govern
ment orders, the Florida relatives of Elian Gon
zalez agreed Tuesday to make the hoy available
for a meeting with his Cuban grandmothers
Wednesday at a neutral site, the Justice Depart
ment said. The grandmothers pressed their insis
tence for the boy's return and pleaded with
Congress not to force U.S. citizenship upon him.
"The meeting will take place at the time and
site selected by the Immigration Service," Jus
tice spokeswoman Carole Florman said Tuesday
evening. The agreement culminated a long day
of negotiations marked by an order from the
Immigration and Naturalization Service for the
meeting, that had been thwarted on Monday by
the relatives.
Florman said the government had reassured
the relatives that Wednesdays session at the
Miami Beach home of the president of a
Dominican college would be just a visit and
would not result in his being taken back to Cuba.
Earlier, after meeting lawmakers on Capitol
Hill, Mariela Quintana, the child's paternal
grandmother, said. "He is only a 6-year-old boy.
And he's a Cuban."
President Bill Clinton said he would not rule
out a veto if Congress passes the citizenship bill.
The INS, part of the Justice Department,
ordered the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez,
to bring Elian to a meeting with the grandmoth
ers at an "appropriate neutral location" at 4 p.m.
EST Wednesday.
The INS specified that location: the Miami
Beach home of Barry University President
Jeanne O'Laughlin, a sister in the Roman
Catholic Dominican order.
The ruling followed Gonzalez's rejection

Monday of a meeting anywhere other than his
own home.
The meeting "is only a visit" and does not
change the boy's status, said the letter signed by
Michael A. Pearson, executive associate immi
gration commissioner for field operations.
The INS has ruled that the boy should be
returned to his father in Cuba. Elian's Florida
relatives have challenged that order in federal
court.
"I have everybody's word that the child will
not be taken away," O'Laughlin said in an inter
view with The Associated Press. "I wouldn't par
ticipate if that was the case."
If the relatives had refused to bring the boy to
the meeting. Justice attorneys could have gone
into federal court in Miami for an order directing
compliance, said department officials who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
The boy was found clinging to a life preserv
er in the Atlantic on Nov. 25 after his mother
and 10 others died when their boat sank en route
from Cuba to the United States.
Carol Fouke, a spokeswoman for the Nation
al Council of Churches, which sponsored the
grandmothers' trip, applauded the order for
Wednesday's meeting and said the grandmoth
ers planned to leave Washington for Miami early
Wednesday morning, weather permitting. Wash
ington was in the grips of a fierce snowstorm that
blanketed the area with more than a foot of
snow.
The grandmothers told reporters they had
never seen snow before — and were surprised it
was so cold.
Despite the snowstorm, which closed many
congressional offices, the two women made the

rounds of Capitol Hill on Tuesday, meeting with
legislators sympathetic to their wish to have
Elian returned to his father's custody in Cuba
and their opposition to congressionally imposed
citizenship on Elian.
"The only one who has a legal right with that
child is his father," Quintana said.
Several Democratic senators suggested after
meetings with the grandmothers that they would
wage a filibuster on the Senate floor, if neces
sary, to try to block the citizenship bill.
"It doesn't belong on the Senate floor," said
Sen. Barbara Boxer. D-Calif. Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., agreed, saying, "This boy ought
to go home and be with his father."
Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb„ and others who
met with the women said the grandmothers told
them Elian's mother was on the ill-fated boat not
to flee Castro's oppression but because of pres
sure from her boyfriend.
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said after
her meeting with the grandmothers that she has
asked Clinton to fight the citizenship legislation,
even if it means he has to veto it. "Elian Gonza
lez is not an orphan," she said.
The grandmothers brought with them a
photo album and displayed a page with an
enlarged picture of Elian's Cuban family —
minus Elian.
Suggesting the picture showed how much
Elian was missed, Raquel Rodriquez, Elian's
maternal grandmother, said that after losing her
daughter in the boat disaster, having U.S. citi
zenship forced upon Elian "would be more
painful" and prolong the agony.
"I have no one else." she said, tears streaming
down her face.
