# Clinton proposes paying off government debt by 2013
## 
### 
WASHINGTON ( \P) — Vir
tually doubling the size of the bud
get battlefield this election year,
the Congressional Budget Office
said Tuesday that it now expects
federal surpluses over the next
decade to total as much as a gigan
tic $1.9 trillion.
With the soaring economy
pouring billions in unforeseen rev
enue into federal coffers, Presi
dent Bill Clinton said he will pro
pose paying off the government's
entire $3.6-trillion federally held
debt by 2013.
That would be two years earlier
than he has previously aimed for
and puts him a step ahead of
House Republicans, who are
working on a plan to pay off that
portion of the debt by 2015.
The surplus estimate by CBO,
for the 10 years ending 2010, rep
resents a near doubling of a $1 tril
lion forecast it issued only last
July. The figures exclude Social
Security funds.
Both sides immediately claimed
credit for the good news.
"We got here by making hard
choices and sticking to a strategy
that works, that builds opportunity
and reinforces responsibility,"
Clinton said at the White House.

"1 remain committed to that strat
egy. I ask the Republican majority
in Congress to put politics aside
and join me."
In a written statement. House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-111.,
said, "We have this surplus
because of the hard work of the
American people, because of the
healthy American economy and
because of prudent fiscal policies
championed by the Republican
Congress."
The ballooning surplus esti
mates by CBO. Congress' nonpar
tisan budget analyst, mean there
will be even more money at stake
this election year as both parties'
presidential candidates, as well as
Clinton and Congress, battle over
how much of it to use for possible
tax cuts, spending increases and
debt reduction.
Among the politicians for
whom the forecast was good news
is OOP presidential contender
George W. Bush, who has pro
posed a five-year, $483 billion tax
cut that could be paid for by the
new numbers. Some, including
Republican candidate Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., have said Bush's
plan eats up too much of the pro
jected surplus.

Because of likely political grid
lock on issues this year, many ana
lysts expect that most of the sur
plus for fiscal 2001 — which begins
next Oct. 1 — will go for debt
reduction. CBO projected next
year's surplus at up to $69 billion,
plus another $166 billion in Social
Security surpluses.
Clinton provided no details
about how he would eliminate the
publicly held debt, which is money
the government owes investors
who hold Treasury bonds, bills and
notes. The remaining $2 trillion of
the $5.7 trillion national debt is
money held by the Social Security
and other trust funds.
Clinton said his plan, to be
included in the fiscal 2001 budget
he releases Feb. 7, will devote
interest savings to Social Security,
extending its solvency beyond
2050. It will also seek to ensure
Medicare's survival until at least
2025, he said.
Taking a swipe at Republicans,
the president said the national
debt is $1.7 trillion less this year
than was projected when he took
office in 1993, despite "repeated
efforts to push us off the path of
fiscal discipline with large and irre
sponsible tax cuts."
