WASHINGTON (AP)
Prompted by moving talcs of
neglect and abuse, the federal gov
ernment seized new powers Tues
day to protect the nation's half-mil
lion foster children and push states
to find them permanent homes
more quickly.
Under federal rules that will
take effect in March, federal health
officials will for the first time inter
view children and foster parents to
check for signs of abuse or neglect,
conduct inspections at state agen
cies and monitor programs for
recruiting adoptive parents.
States would also be required to
conduct criminal background
checks on prospective foster and
adoptive parents. Those states
cited for doing a poor job protect
ing children could lose up to 14
percent of their federal child wel
fare funds each year.
"This regulation demonstrates a
critical and significant shift in hold
ing states accountable for chil
dren's safety and permanency
while promoting their well-being."
Health and Human Services Secre
tary Donna Shalala said.
The new powers were granted
to Shalala's department in recent
laws passed by Congress that shift
ed the focus in foster care to pro

tecting children from abuse rather
than making their return to their
biological families the first priori
ty-
More than 540,000 U.S. chil
dren are in foster care â€” many
removed from homes because of
abuse and neglect. Most return to
their parents, but others stay in
foster care because of continuing
threats.
Lawmakers began acting in
1997 to give the government a
greater voice in the $7.5 billion a
year foster care system. $4 billion
of which is paid by the federal gov
ernment. They were moved in part
by harrowing tales of neglect and
abuse in some state programs.
The Child Welfare League of
America reported that in 1996, the
last year for which there are statis
tics. more than 3,000 children were
abused or neglected by foster par
ents and 14 died.
Even after Congress acted,
more sad examples emerged.
In 1998, a Philadelphia woman
was charged with beating her 6-
year-old foster daughter to death,
stuffing the body into a duffel bag
and tossing it into a river.
Officials at the city's human
services bureau said the agency
had no indication that there was

violence in the household.
Under the new regulations,
states will be held accountable if
children are abused or neglected
in foster care.
Welfare officials applauded the
landmark change but raised con
cerns that the government is pro
viding no new money to help
states comply with new reporting
and oversight requirements.
"Historically the system that
was used for accountability was a
system that measured processes.
What's dramatic and different is
that now we're saying let's mea
sure for safety and permanency,"
said William Waldman, executive
director, American Public Human
Services Association, whose mem
bers include state welfare agen
cies.
"We've taken the position that
if they're going to make new
requirements, they need to pro
vide the funds."
The regulations were required
by the 1997 Adoption and Safe
Families Act, which focused on
protecting children and speeding
up adoptions. Foster children
often spend up to three years in
foster care while state agencies
attempt to improve conditions in
the home.
