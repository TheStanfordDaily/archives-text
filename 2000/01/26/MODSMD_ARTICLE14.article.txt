University should undertake
major initiative to improve
Humanities and Social Sciences

The recent announcement by Yale
University that it will he embark
ing on a $S(XJ-million initiative to
upgrade its programs and facilities in the
sciences and engineering comes in the
midst of a wave of spending in this area at
other top universities across the country,
including Harvard, Princeton and Stan
ford.
More and more it seems that major
research universities feel the need to
invest substantial resources into their
technical programs if they are to stay
competitive in today's environment.
Here at Stanford, the school year
began with the opening of the new multi
million-dollar Science and Engineering
Quad, which includes the David Packard
Center for Electrical Engineering. Of
course, there was also the donation of
$150 million by Netscape founder Jim
Clark to fund the new interdisciplinary
program in Biomedical Engineering and
Sciences — known as Bio X.
Stanford should go one step further,
however, and undertake a major initiative
to revitalize the Humanities and Social
Sciences, with the purpose of substantial
ly improving teaching and research.
The University is world-renowned
largely for the strength of its undergradu
ate and graduate programs in science and
engineering.
While this to a certain extent over
shadows a number of excellent programs
in the humanities and social sciences as
well as some very good professional
schools, it comes as no secret that Stan
ford is sorely lacking in a number of
areas.
This does not make sense, particularly
when Stanford suffers from such an
embarrassment of riches. The potential
resources available to the University to
improve these areas are astounding

not to mention the mere selling power of
Stanford University name.
Several fields within departments are
only partially developed (if they exist at
all), and it seems very uncertain whether
the administration will ever commit to
investing the proper time and resources
necessary to hire and retain top-notch
faculty and develop a broad-based cur
riculum.
South Asian studies is only one such
example of this situation that comes read
ily to mind. Unlike some other disci
plines, it has been fortunate to receive
more publicity in recent times, thus plac
ing it closer to the top of the University's
agenda. Sadly, the growing importance of
this region has only managed to bring a
few scattered classes to this discipline.
Improving areas of study in the
humanities and social sciences does not
require $S(X) million, especially when the
University is already blessed with several
excellent departments, of which Political
Science, History and English are only a
few.
What it requires, however, is a
strengthening of existing courses and the
development of new ones.
There must be a firm commitment
from the highest levels of the administra
tion as well as the departments to attract,
hire and retain high-quality teachers and
researchers in these areas.
In time new departments may develop.
The University can also create research
centers — like the existing Center for
Latin American Studies — which could
serve as the focal point of study for new
subject areas.
Lastly, in order to solidify Stanford's
research capabilities, the University must
make a commitment to acquire archival
materials and special collections covering
emerging fields of study.
If the University is to truly fulfill its
commitment to a broad liberal arts edu
cation for undergraduates and wants to
stay competitive in all aspects of graduate
study, it must undertake an extensive
effort to strengthen all disciplines.
