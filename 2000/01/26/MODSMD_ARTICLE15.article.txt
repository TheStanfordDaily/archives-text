Daily editorial misrepresents
facts about ASSU fees
Tuesday's editorial, "Acting Profession
ally," grossly misinformed the readers of the
Stanford Daily, ASSU fees do not fund
ASSIJ initiatives such as the Stanford After
Midnight program, the Online Draw Guide
and the Online Course Guide.
These initiatives are provided at no cost
to students, as they are funded by interest
earned Irom the ASSU endowment, which
in turn has been amassed from the profits of
the business projects of Stanford Student
Enterprises.
The $55 in ASSU fees that students pay
each quarter go directly to fund the activi
ties of over a hundred voluntary student
organizations at Stanford.
The timing of this editorial is also partic
ularly troubling. The deadline for students
to request a refund of their Winter Quarter
ASSU fees is this Friday. By misinforming
students regarding how their ASSU fees are
spent in the same issue in which an ASSU

advertisement appears reminding students
of the approaching fee refund deadline, the
Daily is effectively encouraging students to
withdraw their financial support from Stan
ford's student organizations.
I Editors Note: Only the Editor in Cheif is
aware of advertising content in each day's
paper, and in order to preserve editorial
independence, and journalistic integrity it is
never a factor in editorial content. I
As the leaders of the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University, we strive to do
our best to ensure that student organiza
tions can thrive and contribute fully to the
rich diversity of the Stanford community.
We hope that the Daily shares this vision for
our university.
We look forward to working with the
editorial staff of the Daily to ensure that
they provide accurate information to the
Stanford community in the future.

Though the Online Course Guide delay
was unfortunate, the project itself has abso
lutely nothing to do with student funds.
That's right: exactly 0 percent of student
fees support the Course Guide.
In fact, no service projects, including the
Guide, are funded by students. So, where
does your money go? Students fees support
student groups on campus and their various
activities. On the issue of efficiency where
your money's concerned, a committee of
your elected representatives carefully
screens each funding application that comes
through and guards your fees from ineffi
cient and frivolous use.

Your editorial of Jan. 25, entitled "Act

ing Professionally,"
displays some misconceptions about the stu
dent fee system at Stanford.
The ASSU collects money from the stu
dent body each quarter and disburses that
money back out to student groups through
either general or special funding. This
appears as the "ASSU Fees" line on the
tuition bill. The level of this funding is
decided in the ASSU Spring Elections.
Students have the option to request a
fee refund if they decide they do not want
to fund any one or all student groups at
Stanford who receive money from these
funds.
All ASSU operations, including the
Online Course Guide, Online Draw Guide
or work done in preparation for the Stan
ford After Midnight program are not fund
ed with student fees. Contrary to what is in
the editorial, no student pays money for
these services.
