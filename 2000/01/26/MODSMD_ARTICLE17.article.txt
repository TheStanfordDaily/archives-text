# Fighting the good fight
## Corey Griffin Waking up alone 
### 
Last quarter, I went
to a party at an all
frosh house with a
friend who is on staff
there. I knew very few of
the people there except for
my friend, hut I had more
fun that night than I had in
a long time. Why?

If I had heard off-hand that a senior had
attended an all-freshman party, I'd think
that person was sketchy to say the least. I'm
sure many of you out there are thinking the
same thing about me right now.
At first it was a little awkward, but I gen
uinely had a blast. It's difficult to explain
and lias led me to think about a lot of things
going 011 in my life.
Maybe it has something to do with never
wanting to grow up.
Maybe it has something to do with reliv
ing the past. (1 didn't drink much my fresh
man year, so taking part in a boat race was
something I owed myself.)
Maybe it has something to do with being
anonymous in a sea of people with no one
expecting me to act a certain way or be
"myself."
I'm willing to wager that I was tired of
being "myself" or the person that everyone
thinks they know. People really do have an
image of how you are and expect you to
behave in a certain way. When you don't,
the stories fly that you are being weird or
wild or quiet or out of character.
It's not exactly a persona you put tin.
You're not being shallow. It's just that you

don't let people get close enough to find out
who you are and what you really think
about.
I think if we shared what we were think
ing, half the time we'd be scared and the
other half we'd be flattered. The things you
don't say are the things that you're afraid
would frighten your best friends and signif
icant others. You also don't tell people how
much they really mean to you because
you're too inhibited, you would just feel
awkward doing it or, even worse, you're
afraid your friends would take it the wrong
way and make fun of you.
That doesn't mean I want us to speak
without thinking, hut I do want us to sin
cerely ask people how they are doing. I hate
being asked how I am when I know the
other person just wants to hear "good" or
"busy" or some other one-word answer.
Would it hurt for us to take a little more
interest in the lives of our friends and espe
cially those we care about?
My one regret is that I never spent the
time to really let someone else know who I
am. We say that we're looking for the right
person or we just haven't found them yet.
That's a load of horse dung. There are all
sorts of people in our lives now. You don't
need to find a domesticated relationship
where you're sleeping over at your signifi
cant other's place every night.
Wake up. Everyday something happens
that is worth remembering later that day or
years from that moment.
There are the fleeting minutes you're
with someone and you wish they would

hold your hand. There's the split second
when you see a smile across a crowded the
ater lobby. There's the moment when you
wake up from a dream and realize you're
not alone.
Those are the times to remember
because there are enough days when some
one you care about isn't near and there are
enough days you wake up alone.
I don't say that to get you down but to
make you realize how important the
moments when you smile — just a little
smile — are in your life.
Not quite what you were expecting for
my last column? You wonder if maybe
there's one more good fight out there for
me to fight. I'm sure there are plenty of
fights that do need to be fought, but 1 have
realized that while one person can do a lot
of harm, one person can only do so much
good.
That's my challenge to you all. Write a
column, e-mail an administrator, talk to
Iriend. Do something to change what you
think needs to be fixed in your life, here at
Stanford or beyond. As for me, I'm ready to
let someone really know me, and that fight
is long overdue.
Fight the good fight. Find someone to
care about. Ask people how they are. Most
of all, do what makes you happy.
