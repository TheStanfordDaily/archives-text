Well, like all good things,
'From the Cheap Sea'.s' has
to come to an end. So, today is the
last edition of my weekly column.
Not exactly the last episode of
MASH or the last Oreo, hi it at least
I've given Mom a few things to
hang on the fridge back home.
It's been a great time . both as a
sports editor and as columnist over
the last five months.

I have gotten to witness some of
Stanford's greatest triumphs — a
fifth straight Big Game win. the
first trip to the Rose Bowl in 28
years and a nother Sears Director's
Cup trophy for overall excellence
in collegiate athletics. And hope
fully. my successors will get the op
portunity to share in these victories
as well. Can anyone say Final
Four? Or College World Series?
I think more than anything, the
most important thing I will take
away from this experience is the
stories of the athletes I have met or
gotten the chance to read about.
From Troy Walters going from a
barely-recruited, too-small high
school prospect to a Biletnikoff
Award-winning Ail-American to
Anika Leersen lapping the field to
win the national championship in
record-setting time.
From Jason Collins' recovery
from two season-ending injuries to
star for tlaetxoniinal this year to the
immediate rise to stardom of fresh
man Casey Jacobsen.
From Jen Exaltacion. Canadian
Olympian in gymnastics, to Mark
Ganek of the track and field team,
an American Olympian in the four
man bobsled.
There are epic games as well.
The men's soccer team's rain
soaked, four-hour, quadruple
overtime slugfest with Santa Clara
in the first round of the NCAA
tournament. The men's basketball
team's overtime showdown with
Duke in Madison Square Garden
to open the season.

And it's not just the stories on
the field that make Stanford sports
special. Every one of our athletes
and coaches has a story to tell. A
story of how they became interest
ed in their sport in the second
grade, or how they balance time
spent in the classroom with time
spent practicing.
There are stories like Seth Ring
of the men's volleyball team, who
had never played a game of orga
nized volleyball while growing up
in Bend, Ore., and now starts for
the Cardinal as a redshirt fresh
man.
Or Kerry Carter, the freshman
running back on the football team,
who was unable to compete in all
but one game his senior year of
high school because a teacher's
strike forced the cancellation of the
football season. Shunning football
powerhouses like Tennessee and
Michigan. Carter chose to come to
Stanford not only to play football,
but to pursue his dream to go to
medical school.
I've also had the opportunity to
write about the sports world be
yond the Stanford playing fields.
I was moved by the tragedy at
Texas A&M University and the
outpouring of love and support
that the students received in their
time of greatest need.
And the loss of Payne Stewart,
one of my sports heroes growing
lip. whose death rocked the world
of professional golf.
You hate to say it lor fear of
sounding cliche, but I have been
witness to both the thrill of victory
and the agony of defeat.
Sports definitely are a unique
human endeavor, in their ability to
elicit both sheer joy and exaspera
tion. But more than anything,
sports are nothing more than the
efforts of people, no different from
you or me, who excel in a certain
skill.
And I think that is the most im
portant lesson I have learned: the
human side of sports is just as pow
erful as the physical.

Ben Jones, a junior, would like to
congratulate all of Stanford's ath
letes — from varsity to club to intra
mural — and everyone involved in
supporting the Stanford sports pro
gram.
