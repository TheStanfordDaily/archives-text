# Men's swimming drowns Pacific
## Cardinal overpowers Tigers en route to 118-82 win 
### Kellie Wiginton Contributing writer 
Even with some members of the
Stanford men's swim team (4-3)
racing unfamiliar events, the Car
dinal was still able to dominate the
racing lanes yesterday against the
Pacific Tigers (5-8).
Stanford finished first in nine of
the 11 events, winning the noncon
ference dual meet, 118-82.
"We were coming off a really
emotional weekend with a lot of
ups and downs," said senior co
captain Kurt Spenser. "A lot of
guys didn't get a chance to swim
some of the events that they want
ed to [on Saturday] because we
had to have such a tight lineup
against Arizona."
Yesterday made up for some of
Saturday's lost opportunities.
" A lot of guys got to swim today
who sometimes don't get to," said
sophomore Reid Ciustin.
The Cardinal opened the meet
by finishing in both first and sec
ond place in the 200-meter medley

relay.
The relay team of freshmen
Randall Bal and Dan Westcott,
sophomore Jeff Guyman and se
nior Steve Ronson finished in first,
while the team of freshmen John
Waters and Patrick Fowler, sopho
more Mark Siebert and senior
Kurt Spenser came in second.

several Stanford swimmers were
given the day off.
"The guys who weren't swim
ming are the guys who have been
swimming really well," Gustin
said. "They deserve a little break,
and we'll need them for next week
end."
The Cardinal is feeling very op

timistic about the remainder of the

Pacific 10 Conference title.
The remaining meets for the
Cardinal include matchups with
two more top ten schools.
"We keep getting better every
meet," Spenser said. "We are real
ly a talented team. We may not
have the big superstars, but we're
great as a team."
Stanford has a week and a half
before its next Pac-10 encounter.
The No. 5 Cardinal travels to
USC on Feb. 5 to take on the No. 6
Trojans in a key conference dual
meet. This dual could be one of the
deciding factors in which squad
will be able to bring the Pac-10 title
home.
The Cardinal then hosts its final
home meet on Feb. 19 against Pac
-10 rival No. 4 California. This meet
will have more significance than it
has had in the past because of the
improved Golden Bear team.
"This is the part of the season
that you train for all year," Gustin
said.
