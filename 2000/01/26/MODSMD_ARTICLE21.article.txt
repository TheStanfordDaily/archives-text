# Big Al brings knowledge, experience to volleyball squad
## 
### Meghan O'Connor Staff writer 
It may seem like there's always a
high price to pay for good coaching
these days. But on the Stanford
men's volleyball team, there is
quality coaching at an affordable
price. And though assistant coach
A 1 Roderigues volunteers his time
to help coach the squad, the team
finds his presence invaluable.
For the past nine seasons.
Roderigues has been with the team
through three conference titles and
one national championship.
Through the glory and heart
break that comes with athletics,
Roderigues has seen it all.
"For me and [assistant coach]
John [Kosty], he's a mentor." head
coach Ruben Nieves said. "He's
someone we can turn to in difficult
situations and hear the voice of ex
perience talking, because chances
are Al's been through it before."
In an assistant coaching position
dominated by players just out of
college, Roderigues' 33 years of
teaching experience sets him apart
from the rest. And while
Roderigues never played volleyball
himself, he's had 23 years of volley
ball coaching to figure it out.
"I started coaching volleyball by
accident. I was a baseball coach but
they made me coach another sport
and volleyball was the only one
available." Roderigues said of his
work at the James Logan High
School in Union City. "At first I felt
totally inadequate, but soon I fell in

love with the sport. It was nice in
the middle of my career to have a
new sport."
Roderigues still teaches physical
education at James Logan and in
the fall he coaches the girls volley
ball team. But when the Stanford
men are ready to start their season,
Roderigues is there. He drives
across the Bay every afternoon to
bring not only his experience, but
also his positive attitude to the
squad.
"Everyday he brings energy to
the entire team," said senior cap
tain Josh Palacios. "He makes
everything a lot more enjoyable."
"He's the ultimate team player,"
Nieves said. "He's a great role
model and he'll do whatever he
needs to do to help the team be suc
cessful. Not only is he good at it, but
he takes great pride in doing it."
His self-sacrifice and pure en
joyment of the sport is apparent in
the generous donation of his time
and loyal dedication to the Stan
ford squad.
"I like working with the stu
dents," Roderigues said. "I'm a
teacher first and it's nice to see real
student-athletes. It's refreshing to
see them open up their books on a
trip or hear them discussing me
chanical engineering problems.
With all the negatives in athletics
these days, it's a plus to work with
guys like this in this kind of pro
gram."
According to his players, the
feelings arc reciprocal. Known as
"Big Al" to the team, his players

have only good things to say about
their coach. And while he may be
the smallest guy on the sidelines,
dwarfed by players a foot taller
than he, his impact is large.
"He's the most generous person
I've ever had the privilege of meet
ing," junior Curtis Graham said.
"I Ic's always asking what he can do
to help out. His positive attitude is
contagious and always helps pick
up the team."
And indeed, Roderigues does
help out just about everywhere he
can. In practice, he helps Kosty
with defensive strategies for the
team, while during the matches he
spends time with Nieves coaching
the offensive effort.
But beyond the physical game
lies the mental game in which
Roderigues plays perhaps his
biggest role. An aspect of sports
that is often neglected. Nieves cred
its Roderigues with the vital role of
preparing athletes for the positive
and negative emotions that come
with collegiate competition.
"He's really good at encourag
ing athletes to be at their best,"
Nieves said. "After someone
makes a bad play, we're used to Al
stepping up with words of encour
agement. He knows that dwelling
on mistakes doesn't do much
good."
The dedication of Roderigues to
Stanford has given the Cardinal
squad a solid base in its coaching
staff. The team of Nieves, Kosty
and Roderigues has been together
for eight seasons, a record of 147-57

and are hoping that their experi
ence together will give a boast to
this season's young team.
With a veteran team,
Roderigues says his responsibilities
focus more on repetition work, but
with a team as young as this year's
squad, more attention to skills is
needed in order to prepare players
for the step up to collegiate compe
tition.
Nieves accredits Roderigues
with passing his positive energy
along to his players, noting espe
cially the upbeat attitudes of Gra
ham and sophomores Marcus Ska
cel and Seth Ring this season.
"We've already had plenty of
ups and downs this season." Nieves
said. "As a team, we've done a real
nice job of seeing the bright side
and oftentimes that starts with Al."
"You'll never find Al without a
smile." Graham said. "He always
has another tip to make us better
players."
Roderigues recalls the single
most exciting moment in his career
at Stanford as the night the team
won the national championship in
1997. But overall he says the most
fulfilling thing about his coaching
position is visiting with players who
come back to visit.
"The best thing is to see where
they've gone," Roderigues said.
"It's neat to see the growth in peo
ple. that's what college is all about.
They've gone on to do other things,
but when they come back, we still
have the same relationship and I'm
still 'Big Al'."

are Al's been through it before."
In an assistant coaching position
dominated by players just out of
college, Roderigues' 33 years of
teaching experience sets him apart
from the rest. And while
Roderigues never played volleyball
himself, he's had 23 years of volley
ball coaching to figure it out.
"I started coaching volleyball by
accident. I was a baseball coach but
they made me coach another sport
and volleyball was the only one
available." Roderigues said of his
work at the James Logan High
School in Union City. "At first I felt
totally inadequate, but soon I fell in

love with the sport. It was nice in
the middle of my career to have a
new sport."
Roderigues still teaches physical
education at James Logan and in
the fall he coaches the girls volley
ball team. But when the Stanford
men are ready to start their season,
Roderigues is there. He drives
across the Bay every afternoon to
bring not only his experience, but
also his positive attitude to the
squad.
"Everyday he brings energy to
the entire team," said senior cap
tain Josh Palacios. "He makes
everything a lot more enjoyable."
"He's the ultimate team player,"
Nieves said. "He's a great role
model and he'll do whatever he
needs to do to help the team be suc
cessful. Not only is he good at it, but
he takes great pride in doing it."
His self-sacrifice and pure en
joyment of the sport is apparent in
the generous donation of his time
and loyal dedication to the Stan
ford squad.
"I like working with the stu
dents," Roderigues said. "I'm a
teacher first and it's nice to see real
student-athletes. It's refreshing to
see them open up their books on a
trip or hear them discussing me
chanical engineering problems.
With all the negatives in athletics
these days, it's a plus to work with
guys like this in this kind of pro
gram."
According to his players, the
feelings arc reciprocal. Known as
"Big Al" to the team, his players

have only good things to say about
their coach. And while he may be
the smallest guy on the sidelines,
dwarfed by players a foot taller
than he, his impact is large.
"He's the most generous person
I've ever had the privilege of meet
ing," junior Curtis Graham said.
"I Ic's always asking what he can do
to help out. His positive attitude is
contagious and always helps pick
up the team."
And indeed, Roderigues does
help out just about everywhere he
can. In practice, he helps Kosty
with defensive strategies for the
team, while during the matches he
spends time with Nieves coaching
the offensive effort.
But beyond the physical game
lies the mental game in which
Roderigues plays perhaps his
biggest role. An aspect of sports
that is often neglected. Nieves cred
its Roderigues with the vital role of
preparing athletes for the positive
and negative emotions that come
with collegiate competition.
"He's really good at encourag
ing athletes to be at their best,"
Nieves said. "After someone
makes a bad play, we're used to Al
stepping up with words of encour
agement. He knows that dwelling
on mistakes doesn't do much
good."
The dedication of Roderigues to
Stanford has given the Cardinal
squad a solid base in its coaching
staff. The team of Nieves, Kosty
and Roderigues has been together
for eight seasons, a record of 147-57

and are hoping that their experi
ence together will give a boast to
this season's young team.
With a veteran team,
Roderigues says his responsibilities
focus more on repetition work, but
with a team as young as this year's
squad, more attention to skills is
needed in order to prepare players
for the step up to collegiate compe
tition.
Nieves accredits Roderigues
with passing his positive energy
along to his players, noting espe
cially the upbeat attitudes of Gra
ham and sophomores Marcus Ska
cel and Seth Ring this season.
"We've already had plenty of
ups and downs this season." Nieves
said. "As a team, we've done a real
nice job of seeing the bright side
and oftentimes that starts with Al."
"You'll never find Al without a
smile." Graham said. "He always
has another tip to make us better
players."
Roderigues recalls the single
most exciting moment in his career
at Stanford as the night the team
won the national championship in
1997. But overall he says the most
fulfilling thing about his coaching
position is visiting with players who
come back to visit.
"The best thing is to see where
they've gone," Roderigues said.
"It's neat to see the growth in peo
ple. that's what college is all about.
They've gone on to do other things,
but when they come back, we still
have the same relationship and I'm
still 'Big Al'."
