## Time perception and social preference 
### Tracy Hampton 
In today's world, it's difficult to balance emo
tional and professional relationships. Who
doesn't want to have both a healthy social life
and a successful career?
Hopefully we can have both, but sometimes a
choice must be made between the two. At times,
we feel it necessary to maintain business or edu
cational ties with others. At other times, we feel
more compelled to foster intimate social relation
ships with a few close friends.
A recent study by Stanford's Department of
Psychology has offered information about when
in a person's life one type of relationship might
be chosen over the other.
Contrary to what many people believe, age
may not have much to do with such choices,
argued psychology doctoral student Helene
Fung, lead author of the Stanford study reported
in last month's issue of "Psychology and Aging."
She suggests that perception of time is the deter
mining factor, not age per se. In other words, it's
not time since birth but time "left."
A young person will usually perceive time as
less limited than an older person, but this is not
always the case. If for some reason a young per
son is made to feel that his time is limited, he
might change his preferences concerning rela
tionships. His choices may then reflect those of
an older person.
Such a situation might occur if a young person
is terminally ill or is moving to a>foreign country
— away from family and friends. The Stanford
study found that in such a scenario young people
favored spending time with social acquaintances,
such as friends or relatives, rather than knowl
edge-based ones such as admired authors.
The situation goes both ways. Older people
can be made to see time as less limited. When
asked to imagine a situation that would add years
to their lives, they tended to expand their knowl
edge-based interactions.
So when time seems limited, both young and
old people want to deepen emotional ties with
others. And when time seems open-ended, both
tend to favor knowledge-based relationships.
This makes sense when applied to life. Usual
ly young people form knowledge-based relation
ships to prepare for an undetermined and expan
sive future. Yet when the future seems limited.

emotion-related goals seem more important, no
matter what a person's age may be.
So what does this say about the quality of our
relationships throughout life? Although they
may be influenced by our perceptions of time,
emotional and knowledge-based relationships
are not mutually exclusive. In everyday living, we
have combinations of these that change through
out life.
The study doesn't suggest that one type of
relationship is better than the other. A child
should form relationships that increase his
knowledge and skills so that he can map out a
suitable and fulfilling career for himself.

Senior citizcns and terminally ill patients may
not need or want such interactions. They tend to
have a few close friends that provide them with a
sense of emotional satisfaction. "For them, emo
tional goals — with their property of being real
ized right in the moment — are more important,"
Fung said.
Finally, it may be a good idea to realize that no
matter what our "time perception" may be, we
do not know what tomorrow will bring. We might
want to re-evaluate our various relationships
from time to time to see how well they satisfy our
needs and complement our goals and emotions,
keeping in mind the uncertainty of the future.
