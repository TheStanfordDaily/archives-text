# Circadian rhythms in mammals
## 
### Katharine Miller Contributing writer 
If a person spends a few weeks in
an underground bunker with no
exposure to sunlight and no way to
know the time of day, how will his
or her sleep / wake cycle be affect
ed? More than 20 years ago, a
researcher performed this experi
ment.
The result: the medical student
who was the subject of the research
was awake for about 16 hours and
slept for approximately eight hours
in each 24 hour period. Over time,
the 24-hour period shifted slightly to
match the endogenous rhythm of
his brain. His wake / sleep period
was slightly more than 24 hours and
did not match day and night above
ground.

Still, the student's "circadian
rhythm" was not appreciably differ
ent from the 24-hour rhythm most
of us experience. Our bodies set the
rhythm, but our environment affects
it as well. So when the door to the
medical student's underground
home was opened, his body
returned to its original schedule of
waking at 8 a.m. and going to sleep
at midnight.
Biological clocks have fascinated
scientists for years. Neurobiology
Prof. Joe Takahashi of Northwest
ern University is one such scientist.
He discussed his work at Stanford
last week.
In mammals, the biological clock
is in a part of the brain called the
suprachiasmatic nuclei. In a mouse,
if this part of the brain is cut out, the
mouse's circadian rhythm is lost

entirely. Give this mouse a trans
plant of some SCN cells from a dif
ferent animal with a shortened
rhythm, and the mouse will develop
that shortened rhythm.
Grow individual SCN cells on a
plate, and they will send electrical
signals with their own circadian
rhythm. Thus, circadian rhythm
seems to be a cell-autonomous
activity.
Researchers found that certain
genes control the biological clock.
Takahashi identified one such gene,
Clock. When the gene was inserted
into mutant cells that lack rhythm
activity, periodicity returned.
While Takahashi was finding
Clock, other researchers were
studying genes called "Period" and
"Timeless" in fruit Hies. Adjacent to
the Period gene and the Timeless

gene were some DNA sequences
called "E-boxes." An E-box is a
place where a protein called a "tran
scription factor" can attach to turn
on the adjacent gene.
In essence, the E-box is the light
switch. To work, it needs not only
the light at the other end (the Peri
od gene) but also the hand to flick
the switch (the transcription factor).
Takahashi suspected that the
mouse Clock gene produced the
transcription factor for the Period
gene. Because most transcription
factors are made up of more than
one protein, Takahashi first looked
for a protein that would pair with
Clock and bind to the E-box
upstream from Period. He found
one: BMal.
Researchers then looked for and
found fruit fly genes that looked
very much like the mouse Clock and
BMal genes. They hypothesized
that Period. Timeless, Clock and
BMal form a four-way protein com
plex in fruit Hies.
The idea is this: Clock and BMal
turn on Period and Timeless. Period
and Timeless then turn off Clock
and BMal. This mechanism is called
a feedback loop. Essentially, Period
and Timeless are the hand that
flicks the light switch into the off
position.
In mammals, Takahashi has
found that the process is more com
plex. Several other genes are
involved in a similar Period feed
back loop, and unlike the fruit fly
system some of those genes are
light-regulated.
Two of the additional genes
involved are Cryl and Cry 2. If Cryl
was mutated, the mouse rhythm was
shortened by about an hour. If Cry 2
was mutated, the mouse rhythm was
lengthened by about an hour. And if
both genes were knocked out, the
mouse had no rhythm at all.
Interestingly, the SCN functions
in exactly the same way in nocturnal
and diurnal animals. Apparently the
difference in animal behavior (noc
turnal vs. diurnal) is a result of how
the SCN couples with the rest of the
brain â€” it is not a difference in the
SCN or the genetic clock mecha
nism itself.
