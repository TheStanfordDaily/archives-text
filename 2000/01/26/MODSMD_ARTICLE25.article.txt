# Mars probe used to study breast tumors

The rocky surface of Mars and
the interior of a women's breast are
as distinct as materials can be.
However, the two are being
explored with the same device â€” a
NASA probe no larger than a pipe
cleaner.
Stanford physician Stefanie Jef
frey and NASA Ames Research
Center engineer Robert Mah are
heading a research project whose
goal is to use the devices created by
NASA to identify which kinds of
breast tumors are more likely to
spread. This will help doctors
decide a course of action that gives
patients a better chance to survive
breast cancer.
Currently, knowledge about
breast tumors is surprisingly scant.
Out of 100 patients who have
tumors removed, 25 will need
chemotherapy because the tumor
returns. But doctors can't tell
patients beforehand what category
they're in.
NASA's Mars research probes
are designed to be able to examine
specimens on the surface of Mars
and compare them to the properties
of known substances in a vast
database to make an educated
guess about the nature of the sam
ple.
The breast probe works on the
same principle. Mah's team has
already successfully used similar
probes to maneuver within the
human nervous system.
The prototype probe is straw
shaped and can be maneuvered via
computer assistance. As the probe
slides through breast tissue, it gives
real-time feedback on the charac
teristics of the tissue in front of it.
The team's first goal is to map
out the differences between cancer
cells and normal cells. These
include any variables that can phys
ically distinguish tumor cells from
normal cells.
Each tumor is unique, carrying a
particular set of characteristics: a
pattern of blood vessels that feed it,
a stiffness to the pinch, a change in

oxygen levels and a tiny but percep
tible difference in fluid pressure
between tumor cells and healthy
surroundings.
So far, Mah and Jeffery have
identified 10 factors that might be
helpful. For example, tumor tissue
is 10 to 100 times stiffer than
healthy tissue. A tiny square of foil
embedded in the probe bends
slightly when it encounters soft tis
sue, but the curvature increases
when pressed against tougher flesh.
A combination of these distin
guishing characteristics will allow
doctors to make a credible progno
sis. Jeffrey however, remains cau
tious in her approach.
"We're still too early in our
stages of research," Jeffrey said.
"I'd hate to say how great this is
without testing it thoroughly."
Their cautious approach to the
project hasn't stopped them from
coming up with upgrades to the sys
tem. Physicians may someday be
able to use it to target a tumor
directly by depositing the medica
tion at the center of the tumor. The
probe might also be used to line up
cross hairs for a laser to burn away
the cancer cells.
The computer system that
guides the probe is borrowed from
Mah's research into docking the
space shuttle. As sensors on the tip
of the probe give feedback on
what's immediately in front of the
probe, the computer program will
stop the insertion if it "sees" a
major blood vessel.
Mah hopes that one day his
probes will be clever enough to
steer themselves to tumors without
damaging nearby tissues, assess the
tumors' danger to the patient and
then administer the proper treat
ment on the spot if necessary. That
day is still in the long-term future
and the technique remains to prove
itself scientifically sound, but the
appeal has scientists salivating.
"The idea of the probe is very
exciting," Jeffrey said. "But there's
so much more we don't understand.
This has the potential to affect hun
dreds of thousands of women, not
just one at a time."
