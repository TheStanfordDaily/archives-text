## Bone cement fills cracks 
### Bruce Wang Editorial staff 
Most people suffering from a
broken bone can expect a long
recovery in a cast. Now a new bone
cement treatment for fractures will
allow patients to shed the tradition
al casts for immediate recovery.
The new treatment, used by sev
eral Stanford physicians, utilizes
needles and high-tech cements to
fill in gaps and strengthen injured
bones in wrists, hips and spines. The
relatively quick, less invasive proce
dure is often performed under
regional anesthesia and offers sig
nificant pain relief within hours or
days.
Traditional surgical procedures
to mend broken bones include
lengthy operations under general
anesthesia that require harvesting
the patient's own bones as grafts.
Now the broken bone can be
"pasted" back together with an
injectable, quick setting bone
cement administered under only
local anesthesia.
According to Prof. Stuart Good
man, chief of the Division of Ortho
pedic Surgery at Stanford, the pro
cedure is "especially useful for rela
tively young patients — those in
their 40s — who want to remain
active without facing a king period
of recovery and relative inactivity."
The method Goodman uses, the
Norian Skeletal Repair System, has
the compelling advantage of allow
ing the body to replace the cement
with new bone growth over time.
That's because the cement, made of
a special formula of calcium phos
phate — the naturally occurring

mineral of bone — is biocompatible
and defers to the body's natural
inclination to repair itself over time.
One drawback to the cement
system is that SRS doesn't handle
the strain of torsion as well as
healthy bone alone. Thus some
patients with large or complicated
injuries will still need implants or
pins placed during more invasive
surgery.
A second type of cement, poly
methymethacrylate, is used by Asst.
Prof, of Radiology Huy Do and is
known to be stronger.
"Tests have shown that the
cement has stress-resistance that is
stronger than bone," Do said.
Do uses PMMA to fill and sup
port fractures in spinal vertebrae.
While PMMA doesn't stimulate
replacement bone growth, it has "a
very good track record in terms of
strength, stability and biocompati
bility."
These features are important to
the 750,000 people who suffer frac
tured vertebrae each year. More
than 150,000 of these patients
require hospitalization and severe
pain when standing or walking.
With PMMA. Do and his col
leagues insert a needle into the
spine to reach the gracture site. In
its initial liquid form, PMMA fills
any cavities or spaces within the
damaged bone. After an hour or
two, the liquid hardens into a body
friendly cement.
Because the procedure is carried
out under local anesthesia and typi
cally takes only a few hours to com
plete, it offers patients a chance to
resume a normal lifestyle within
one dav of treatment.
