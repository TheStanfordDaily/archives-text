# Biology professors urge Gore, Bradley to address global environmental issues
## 
### T.J. Babbitt Editorial staff 
A group of 17 environmental sci
entists. including seven from Stan
ford. told Democratic presidential
candidates Al Gore and Bill Bradley
that they need to focus more force
fully on environmental issues in an
open letter published recently.
In the letter, the scientists told
Bradley and Gore that they had a
duty to educate the public about
global warming, biodiversity, over
population. alternative energy
sources, nuclear weapons issues and
pollution.
The scientists sav that these issues

are far more important than most of
the issues currently being discussed
in the campaign and urged Bradley
and Gore to use their prominence to
focus the attention of the voting pub
lic on them.
Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich, one of
the letter writers, said all of these is
sues are more critical to humanity's
future than the "incremental"
changes in taxes, spending and feder
al involvement in the health care sys
tem that he said have dominated
much of the discussion in the presi
dential primaries.
"The issues they are talking ahout
are fundamentally trivial compared
to the other issues we're talking

about." Ehrlich said.
Stanford scientists joining Ehrlich
in the effort are Anne Ehrlich. the di
rector of policy for Stanford's Center
for Conservation Biology; Donald
Kennedy, an environmental science
professor and former University
president; Biology Prof. Harold
Mooney; Institute for International
Studies Prof. Stephen Schneider;and
Biology Prof. Peter Vitousek.
The scientists said they decided to
concentrate on the two Democratic
candidates because of their knowl
edge of important environmental is
sues and their records in favor of
those causes.
The problem, he said, is that the

campaign process has marginalized
those issues from consideration and
prominence, and the candidates
have not come forward with their
own strong positions, he said.
"In terms of knowledge, [Gore] is
probably the best candidate in histo
ry [and| Bradley has an even better
voting record on these issues," Paul
Ehrlich said.
Ehrlich. who said he is a regis
tered Republican, said the Republi
can candidates didn't even come
close to having positions on major
environmental issues close to those
of the biologists who wrote the letter,
so attempting to get their attention
wouldn't be useful.
