# Superfly ultimate squad unbeatable
## Cardinal women's A squad goes over the century mark for consecutive wins 
### Joe Cavanaugh Editorial staff 
Between the hours of 3 and 6
p.m. at almost anytime of the year
around the fields of Stanford, a
group of women will he running,
throwing and making spectacular
catches with a frisbee.
They are simply the best at what
they do.
They are the Stanford women's
ultimate frisbee team. The squad
made history as it notched its

105th-straight victory. "Superfly,"
as the team is known, just might be
the best way to explain their play.
The last time the team lost was
on June 2, 19% and since have
taken every game, including three
straight national championships.
The B-team was the No. 1 team in
the nation in 1998.
Leading the way for Stanford
are captains Camille Yu and Karen
Hyun. Yu is the only member of the
team who has not lost a game in her
Stanford career.

The leader of the Superfly jug
gernaut is Stanford alumni Jennifer
"JD" Donnelly. Donnelly has been
the head coach for the last six years
and has built the program from a
minor club sport to a national pow
erhouse.
At a recent tournament in Santa
Barbara, Superfly was forced to
play the B-team. Grumblings could
be heard, but it was a chance for the
B-team to dethrone the best team
in the land.
However, Superfly would not

let go of its hold on ultimate fris
bee.
As usual, Superfly came out
with the win, its 105 straight. The
B-team did not hang their heads; if
they had to lose to anyone, it might
as well be the No. 1 team in the na
tion.
Superfly is currently the most
successful sport at campus. Their
sheer dominance cannot be
matched by any other sport, and
the women's college ultimate fris
bee ranks will never be the same.

Senior Camille Yu and head coach Jennifer "JD" Donnelly celebrate another victory for Superfly, the Stanford women's ultimate frisbee
team. Superfly has won 105 consecutive games, with its last loss dating back to 1996.
