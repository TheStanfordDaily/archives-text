MEW'S TENNIS
â–  Yesterday: No. 3 Stanford 7,
Hawaii 0.

In singles, senior Geoff Abrams,
who is ranked fourth in the nation,
defeated Hawaii's top player, Anto
nio Garcia, 6-3, 6-2. Junior Scotty
Scott, who has recovered from a
stress fracture in his wrist, beat
Amandeep Singh, 6-3,7-5, in the No.
2 spot.
The last four singles matches
were all played by Cardinal fresh
men, David Martin, Scott Lipsky,
Ryan Haviland and Carter Morris.
No. 3 seed Martin routed Reggie
Maralejo, 6-0,6-1.
"1 feel like I played pretty sharp
today," Martin said. "The win over
Hawaii is a good way to start the sea
son."
Lipsky continued Stanford's win
ning trend with a 6-3, 6-0 win over
Lincoln Leeder. Haviland battled
back after losing the first set and de
feated Malino Oda, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.
Morris finished off the Rainbow
Warriors by dismantling Kai
Ohuchi, 6-2,6-0.
In doubles, Stanford won all three
matches easily.
Abrams and Scott defeated Gar
cia and Singh, 8-4. Martin teamed up
with Haviland to beat Leeder and
Ohuchi, 8-2. Finally, Morris and Lip
sky won 8-4 over Moralejo and Oda.
Stanford won the dual match
without two of its top players, sopho
more K.J. Hippensteel, the No. 1
player in the nation, and junior Alex
Kim, ranked sixth in the country.
Hippensteel contracted a case of

mononucleosis at the National Col
legiate Tennis Classic in Thousand
Oaks, Calif, on Jan. 14. He might be
out the rest of winter quarter.
Kim stayed out of the lineup for a
different reason. Because he com
peted in a World Team Tennis event
in October, Kim must miss one
match during the season. The
NCAA states that a player can only
compete in a certain number of
matches each year. Therefore, the
Stanford coaches wanted to rest Kim
against Hawaii, a nonconference, av
erage opponent.
This match was the second time
the two teams have played this year.
During Thanksgiving break, the
Cardinal traveled to Hawaii and
crushed the Rainbow Warriors, 7-0.
Stanford did not lose a set in singles
or doubles. However, the fall match
was unofficial and did not count on
the teams' actual records.
Although Hawaii was playing
without Garcia, and Stanford had
Hippensteel and Kim in the lineup
during the fall match, the outcome
was the same, a dominating Stanford
victory.
"I think as a whole we played ex
tremely well and controlled the
matches today," said Stanford's asis
tant coach John Whitlinger. "Some
times when you a play a team that
you have already beaten handily,
you become complacent. Our guys
definitely didn't do that today."
While Hawaii's men's tennis
team is not the caliber of Stanford's,
it is in a rebuilding season this year.
After a 22-11 record last year,
Hawaii has only two returning play
ers, Garcia and Singh. The five re
maining players are freshmen.
"In our first five matches this sea
son, we played teams in the top 17,"
said.Hawaii coach Jim Schwitters
"We try to make an educational ex
perience playing these top schools.
Next year, our players will be okay
competing at the highest level."
