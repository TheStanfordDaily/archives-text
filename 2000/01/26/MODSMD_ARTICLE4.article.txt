# County supervisors tackle Stanford GUP
## 
### Anitha Reddy Staff writer 
The Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors met last night to hear
public opinion for the first time on
Stanford's proposed Community
Plan and General Use Permit.
Fifty-seven people spoke at the
meeting, but two concerns dominat
ed the agenda: the shortage of afford
able graduate and faculty housing
and the fate of Stanford's open space.
Larry Horton, director of Govern
ment and Community Relations, em
phasized that more housing and the
protection of open space were not
mutually exclusive goals. The pro
posal for 3,(XX) new subsidized hous
ing units was made necessary by the
lack of affordable options for gradu
ate students, faculty and staff, he said.

but the plan proposes no new com
mercial development and fully two
thirds of Stanford land would remain
open space.
Although most alumni who spoke
at the meeting supported the preser
vation of open space, other individu
als currently or formerly associated
with Stanford expressed concern that
constrained physical development
would result in deterioration of the
University's academic excellence and
ground-breaking research.
Former University President
Richard Lyman urged the Board to
recognize the "underlying fragility of
this seemingly powerful institution."
In particular, he identified Silicon
Valley's spectacular real estate prices
as a major obstacle to recruiting the
most talented graduate students and
faculty.

Ihe importance of more faculty
housing should not be underestimat
ed, Psychology Prof. Ewart Thomas
said. "We are a residential university;
therefore, the closer the professoriate
lives to campus the higher the quality
of education our students receive."
Environmental advocates, how
ever, refused to concede that the level
of development for which Stanford
has requested permission is justified.
Peter Drekmeier, who spoke on be
half of the Stanford Open Space Al
liance, said that while Stanford's last
General Use Permit enabled it to de
velop 2 million square feet, Stan
lord's new proposal would result in
the development of twice as much
space.
All of the environmental groups
represented at the meeting, which in
cluded the Committee for Green
Foothills and the Sierra Club, de
manded the permanent protection of
Stanford's foothills.
"I support all of Stanford's acade
mic goals," said Barry Boulton, a
Sierra Club member. "But Stanford
needs to conform to the same laws
every large landowner does."
Other speakers characterized the
foothill-preservation demand as
"grossly unfair," but the environ
mental groups felt it was reasonable
considering the amount of develop
ment Stanford plans to complete in
the next 10 years.
People representing Stanford's
interests were quick to counter with
specific examples of Stanford's en
lightened stewardship of its open
space.
"In the last 20 years, the Foothills
of such concern have been de-devel
oped." Physics Prof. Burton Richtcr
said. Antennas gathering data for a
I Jniversity experiment once dotted

the hillsides, but the University vol
untarily removed them, he said.
"1 believe that it is possible for
Stanford to continue its tradition of
excellence without compromising
the quality of life in the surrounding
communities," said District 5 Super
visor Joe Simitian. who represents
northern Santa Clara County.
Simitian said the Board had reached
a transition point in its relationship to
the University and its approach to ap
proving campus development.
In the past, Simitian said, the
Board had given Stanford more lee
way in its projects because it felt that
Stanford had a right to development
as a private landowner as long as it
had no adverse impact on surround
ing communities.
This approach, however, was only
feasible as long as those who rented
or owned homes on campus were
happy with the University's manage
ment of land, he said. Now that some
Stanford leaseholders had expressed
some dissatisfaction with the Univer
sity's land policies, the Board could
not deny them their rights as Santa
( lata C 'ountv residents to bring their
complaints to the Board.
