### Lauren Phillips Staff writer 
The complainants charging Stan
ford with discrimination in hiring
and promotion were contacted by
the Department of Labor before
their names were released to the
University on Monday, according to
the Labor Department and former
Asst. History Prof. Karen Sawislak.
The San Francisco Chronicle re
ported yesterday that the release of
the women's names breached a
"promise" of anonymity that was
made to the complainants when
they filed their case, and that many
are worried about the possible
repercussions of being named.
Sawislak, one of the original

complainants, said that they were
each asked permission for the re
lease of their names about one
month ago.
"In some sense I think that this is
a positive step in that it will acceler
ate information," Sawislak said.
Several women dropped out of
the complaint rather than allow
their names to be released because
they are still affiliated with the Uni
versity, she said.
The complainants, whose names
have been kept anonymous since
the beginning of the investigation in
November 1998, were sent to the
University in what Labor Depart
ment spokesperson Tino Serrano
calls "a standard part of the investi
gation." t

"By proving that information to
Stanford, we've created a protected
class," Serrano said. "All the people
that are named are now protected
from the school. Before the com
plainants could have been fired
without mention of the case."
Tom Fenner, a senior lawyer in
Stanford's legal department, said
the Labor Department's Office of
Federal Contract Compliance Pro
grams is obliged to disclose the
names of complainants and the con
tent of their complaints.
"We have been asking OFCCP
for nearly a year to comply with
their own rules and provide us with
copies of the complaints against
Stanford," Fenner said. "Wc will
now be preparing the University's
responses to eaeh of the complaints
about which we have been noti
fied."
Neither the University nor the
Labor Department would release
the names of the complainants.
Several women have publicized
their claims, including Saw islak, for
mer Law School Asst. Prof. Linda
Mabry and former medical school
researcher Colleen Crangle. ( ran
gle has her own federal suit pending
against Stanford in which she says
she was retaliated against lor initiat
ing a gender discrimination suit.
According to the Chronicle, the
judge in Crangle's case ordered
Stanford to release logs of conversa
tions which occurred by e-mail
about medical school personnel
during IW7.
I ler case is scheduled go to trial
in March.
Saw islak said that the necessity
of releasing the names reinforces
the difficulties that the case has cre
ated for the complainants in receiv
ing .1 fair investigation.
"I think that tins whole episode
illustrates how difficult it is to take
on large institutions, and that there
is a lot of vulnerability for the indi
\ iduals w ho step forward." she said.
"I seriously regret that there are
women who felt that they could not
stay in the complaint because they
were still working at the Universi
ty."
Fenner said Stanford will not re
taliate against complainants and
was seeking their names in order to
more lully cooperate with the I .abor
Department.
I lie investigation began with a
group complaint by eight Stanford
faculty and stall members who al
leged discriminatory practices in
tenure and I 'Diversity hiring against
women. I he complaint grew to in
clude about 32 people, both women
and minority men. by I cbruary of
last year.
