### Marisa Pavlik Staff writer 
The Undergraduate Senate con
firmed the nominations of junior
Josh Fried and sophomore Char
lene Ng as student representatives
on the Search Committee for the
Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aid last night.
The search committee, once

fully selected, will find a replace
ment for Dean Robert Kinnally,
who recently announced his deci
sion to enter the seminary to be
come a Catholic priest. The com
mittee hopes to have the new dean
in place by Sept. 6, according to
ASSU Vice President John Mills, a
graduate student in genetics.
Both Fried and Ng were selected
from a pool of six applicants after

interviews with senior Kristin Tor
res, chair of the Nominations Com
mission.
"I've known Josh for about a
year now and he is very committed
to the Stanford community," Mills
said. Fried has been involved in
dorm government and Hillel, a Jew
ish student organization.
"He will be a very effective rep
resentative of the interests of stu

dents on the Search Committee,"
he said.
Ng. who served as an ASSU sen
ate associate last year, is currently
co-chair of the Tresidder Memorial
Union Advisory Board. "Charlene
is so involved in student life here at
Stanford," Mills said.
"The depth and breadth of her
experiences will serve her well on
the search committee," he said.
Several senators raised con
cerns that the committee's forma
tion was not publicized enough to
potential applicants in the interest
of speed.
In addition, the Undergraduate
Senate approved funding requests
for four student groups: the Alpha
Phi Alpha fraternity's senior citi
zens' luncheon; Circle k. a nation
al community service organization;
Stanford Hwimori, a Korean
drumming group; and Think!, a
new group that aims to promote in
dependent thought by inviting
speakers.
"This meeting exemplifies what,
in my mind, are the two most im
portant functions of the ASSIJ
appointing students to serve as stu
dent representatives on University
committees and dispersing stu
dents' ASSU general-fee money to
campus student organizations,"
Mills said.
