## East Coast storm closes airports and schools 
### 
A surprisingly fast-moving
storm blanketed the East Coast
with up to 2 feet of wind-blown
snow Tuesday, closing airports and
schools, paralyzing the nation's
capital and leaving North Carolina
looking more like North Dakota.

"The snow has completely cov
ered my car. It's gone; 1 can't even
see it," Thomas Allen said in
Raleigh, N.C.
At least four people were killed
in weather-related traffic accidents
in the Carolinas, and a 5-vear-old

girl was missing and feared dead in
Massachusetts after falling into an
icy river while walking to school in
heavy snow.
The storm even intruded on the
presidential campaign. Most of the
candidates flew to New Hampshire

after the lowa caucuses, but
Republican Alan Keyes got stuck
in Detroit, unable to fly into
Boston.
The storm — known as a
nor'easter — drove northward
along the coast, with moist air from
the ocean colliding with cold air
over the land. During the morning,
snow fell from South Carolina all
the way to Maine.
The storm raced into the North
east with a speed that surprised
forecasters.
"We knew it was coming. It just
decided to hit us a day earlier," said
National Weather Service meteo
rologist Tim Morrin in New York.
It was the third snowfall in a
week for some states, but for much
of the region it was the first major
storm in a season that has seen little
snow. It was also the worst snow
storm to hit the area since the bliz
zard of January 19%.
Most federal agencies shut down
in Washington. Legislative meet
ings were called off in Delaware,
New Hampshire and Pennsylvania,
and Delaware Gov. Thomas Carp

er had to postpone his State of the
State address for the second time in
a week because of snow. •
Schools were closed from South
Carolina to Maine, including nearly
all schools in New Jersey and Mary
land.
Fourteen inches of snow had
fallen by early afternoon at Peters
burg. Va., and snow piled up in 4- to
5-foot drifts outside Richmond. A
foot had fallen at Jaffrey, N.H. The
Baltimore-Washington Interna
tional Airport got more than seven
inches. Ten inches had accumulated
outside Philadelphia at King of
Prussia, and New York City mea
sured 6.
Boston had only 3 1/2 inches, but
snow up to 18 inches deep was fore
cast by the end of the storm in the
Berkshire hills of western Mas
sachusetts.
The storm hit hardest in the Car
olinas. North Carolina got 2 feet of
snow in Montgomery County and a
record 18 inches at the Raleigh-
Durham airport.
The North Carolina utility
CP&L had 142.000 customers with

out power. Duke Power Co. report
ed 120,000 without power in North
and South Carolina, and the storm
stalled repairs. Virginia Power
reported 5,600 customers without
power, mostly in Virginia Beach,
where ice was more of a problem
than snow.
"With wind gusts at 40 miles per
hour, it's just not safe to have some
body up there working on a power
line in a bucket truck." said CP&L
spokeswoman Sally Ramey.
North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt
declared a state of emergency, acti
vating the National Guard to help
clear streets and rescue stranded
motorists. Stalled cars and trucks
shut down five miles of Interstate
85.
"There may be other snow
storms like this in Alaska or some
thing, but never in North Carolina,"
said Allen, the motorist whose car
was buried in Raleigh, N.C.
The storm closed major Eastern
airports, including New York's
LaGuardia and Washington Rea
gan National Airport, and others
had delays and cancellations.
