### 
Students at Stanford are grow
ing increasingly dependent on their
ethernet connections — but not
merely for downloading MP3s and
playing video games such as Star
cralt.
Enterprising students are also
using the Internet for more serious
pursuits, such as shopping or finan
cial transactions.
Shopping Online
From textbooks to clothes, Stan
ford students make use of the Web
for a wide array of their shopping
needs.
Buying textbooks online seems
to be the most common form of on
line shopping for Stanford students,
and many students cite conve
nience and price as the motivating
factors.
Martin Ryan, a master's student
in the Center for Russian and East
ern European Studies who has oc
casionally purchased books online,
said next quarter he will "definitely
use a Web service of some kind to
find the lowest textbook prices."
In addition to textbooks, Stan
ford students are using online gro
cers. such as Web Van.com, and dis
covering the joys of not having to
wait in line at the grocery store or
carry large bags of groceries to and
from their cars.
"I love Web Van." said Dijana
Elez. a master's student in Engi
neering-Economic Systems and
Operations Research. "Out of all
the online companies that exist.
Web Van offers me the most valu

able service."
Clothing companies with online
services — including Gap, Eddie
Bauer and J. Crew — are also prof
iting from Stanford students.
Instead of going from store to
store trying to find the correct size
or color, online shoppers can find
clothes quickly in the comfort of
their own room. Senior Katherine
Loo said she uses Gap.com to buy
clothes, but admitted, "It is easier
to use when you know exactly what
you are looking for."
However. Loo said shopping for
clothes online has been a good ex
perience and that she "would defi
nitely try buying groceries and
other items online."
Using Online Financial Services
With online financial services
from day-trading to bill-paying, stu
dents' investment options seem
endless. While students may be lim
ited in the amount of money they
can invest in stocks or mutual
funds, more and more are taking
advantage of the ease and accessi
bility of online financial services.
According to Philip Meza, an as
sociate at the newly formed Center
for Electronic Business and Com
merce at the Graduate School of
Business, many students arc engag
ing in online financial services.
While Meza admitted that his
experience with Stanford students
has been limited to graduate stu
dents in the Business School, he
said that while helping teach a
course on strategy and information
