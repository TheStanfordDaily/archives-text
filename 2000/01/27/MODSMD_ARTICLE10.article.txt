## Elian Gonzalez reunited with his grandmothers

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) â€”
Elian Gonzalez was finally reunited
with his grandmothers yesterday at
a "neutral site" that had to be
arranged by the U.S. government
because of the personal and political
passions swirling around the 6-year
old Cuban boy.
Elian was driven to a nun's house
in Miami Beach to see his grand
mothers, who had flown in from
Washington. The visit lasted about
an hour and a half.
"They just came to him and they
hugged him and they sat down at a
table and they were seeing an album
of pictures," said Elian's cousin
Marisleysis Gonzalez, who was at
the reunion.
The grandmothers did not com
ment as they left the meeting and
were driven away to a helicopter.
As Elian returned to his relatives
home in Miami, a crowd waiting
outside roared with approval.
Elian's great-uncle Delfin Gonzalez
faced the crowd while holding a cru
cifix above his head.
"Tomorrow they're going to
make me an American citizen."
Elian said in an interview broadcast
over the Spanish-language Radio
Mambi while driving back to his rel
atives' home.
The grandmothers came to the

United States last week to appeal to
the American people and Congress
to send the boy back to his father in
Cuba. Elian's relatives in Miami
want him to stay and are fighting a
U.S. government order sending him
back.
The Justice Department had said
the grandmothers would see Elian
privately, with the boy's Florida rel
atives nearby in the house. Elian's
father, in a letter printed in the
Communist Party newspaper Gran
ma, asked to be included in the
reunion by telephone.
The grandmothers had also
flown to Miami on Monday but left
town without seeing Elian. The
Miami relatives insisted that any
reunion take place at their home in
the Little Havana neighborhood,
but the grandmothers said they were
uncomfortable going there. Anti-
Castro Cuban immigrants have
been holding protests around the
home.
After long negotiations, the Jus
tice Department ordered Elian's rel
atives to bring him to the nun's
house. The agency said it had the
authority to do so under the
arrangement letting the boy stay in
this country pending further immi
gration proceedings.
Mariela Quintana and Raquel

Rodriguez had not seen their grand
son since before he left Cuba for the
United States with his mother, who
died along with 10 other people
when their boat capsized. Elian was
found clinging to an inner tube off
the Florida coast on New. 25.
The reunion was held at the
home of Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin.
president of Barry University.
O'Laughlin. 70, has a history of
helping immigrants and had said she
would serve as "weleomer" and
"hugger."
As the grandmothers drove up to
the house, a few people tossed flow
ers at their car. About 200 demon
strators were waiting outside the
house; some cheered and others
booed as the grandmothers passed.
On Capitol Hill. Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott indicated he has
no solid plans for handling legisla
tion next week to give Elian U.S. cit
izenship. That would remove the
boy from the jurisdiction of the
Immigration and Naturalization
Service, the agency that ordered him
back to Cuba.
"There are a lot of extenuating
circumstances," Lott said. "Obvi
ously it could come up next week.
But there are a lot of people looking
at this issue and there may be devel
opments between now and then."
