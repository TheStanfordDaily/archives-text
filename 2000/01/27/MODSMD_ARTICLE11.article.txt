# Snowstorm hits North Carolina

### 
RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Four
months after Hurricane Floyd's
devastating floodwaters, North
Carolina struggled yesterday with
the aftermath of a "white hurri
cane" — a record 2-foot snowfall in
a part of the country that doesn't
have much experience with bliz
zards.
The snowstorm left thousands of
people stuck in cold, dark homes
and paralyzed Raleigh and other
communities.
"I'm 45 years old and I've never
seen it like this. Our fire trucks
couldn't go anywhere. Our ambu
lances couldn't go anywhere," said
Rick Harris, emergency manage
ment coordinator in rural Mont
gomery County, outside Charlotte.
Floyd drenched eastern North
Carolina with 20 inches of rain
Sept. 16 and caused at least 51
deaths in the worst flooding instate
history. Monday night's snowstorm,
accompanied by ice and winds,
knocked down trees and plunged
homes and businesses into dark
ness.
Raleigh Mayor Paul Coble,
snowbound yesterday like many of
his constituents, described the
storm in terms people in North Car
olina are certain to understand: "a
white hurricane."
More than 140.(XX) homes and
business remained without electric
ity yesterday in North and South

Carolina. The storm was blamed
for one traffic death in North Car
olina and two in South Carolina.
Two people were found outside
dead of exposure in South Caroli
na.
The Rev. Anne Beach, pastor of
the Biscoe Presbyterian Church in
Montgomery Couty, said her
church shelter was running out of
food to feed people whose homes
lost electricity.
"We have plenty of cans of
soup, but nothing much to go with
it," she said. "I'm just praying for
the loaves and the fishes to multi
ply."
The storm dumped 20.3 inches
at Raleigh-Durham International
Airport, breaking Raleigh's previ
ous single-storm record of 17.8
inches from March 2. 1927. It also
set a record for snowfall in a month,
giving Raleigh a total of 28.2 inches.
The previous mark was 20 inches,
in January 1893.
Travel was especially treacher
ous along Interstate 85 just south of
the Virginia-North Carolina line.
The road was virtually shut down
for several hours Tuesday night and
yesterday morning by jackknifed
and abandoned tractor-trailers.
The Raleigh-Durham airport,
was closed and is scheduled to open
this morning. Spokesman Mike
Blanton said 120 people were
stranded in the airport's two termi

iiiils Tuesday and yesterday, but a
hotel chain fed them at no charge.
Blanton said the airport was
closed for several hours during
Hurricane Floyd in September and
Hurricane Fran in 19%. but never
for two days.
The nor'easter swept up the
Fast Coast from South Carolina,
dropping heavy snow inland. The
Northeast got up to 2 feet of snow,
which snarled roads and closed
schools and government offices, but
most places were almost back to
normal yesterday.
Raleigh and Richmond, Va..
which got 11 inches, were still large
ly paralyzed yesterday.
"My guess is from what they're
saying is it's going to be Sunday
before you start to see any real
movement," the Raleigh mayor
said.
Stewart McGough, a First
Union Bank employee from Char
lotte, described downtown Rich
mond as a ghost town when he
arrived Tuesday night after several
hours of treacherous travel.
•it was like a war zone — a
demilitarized zone of sorts," he
said.
National Guardsmen in
Humvees in North Carolina and
Virginia helped state troopers
reach traffic accidents. The vehicles
also served as ambulances and
helped take people lo shelters.
