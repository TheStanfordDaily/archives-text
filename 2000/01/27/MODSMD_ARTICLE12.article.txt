# New Internet regulations in China
## Chinese government extends state secret law 
### 
BEIJING (AP) — China has
extended its vague state secrets
law to the Internet, ordering com
panies lo register software used to
transmit sensitive data and threat
ening punishment for any govern
ment secrets sent onto the Web.
The regulations, announced
yesterday, could scare oil foreign
firms eager to tap China's boom
ing Internet market.
They also underscore the com
munist leadership's ambivalent
desire to exploit the Internet for
business while constricting infor
mation considered threatening to
its rule.
Everyone, from Internet sites
to chat-room users, must gain
approval from agencies protecting
government secrets before pub
lishing previously unreleased
information on the Web, accord
ing to the States Secrecy Bureau
regulations released in the Peo
ple's Daily.
"It's like saying you want to
develop railroads and then throw
ing down a different gauge track
not used anywhere else in the
world," said William Soileau, an
information technology lawyer
with Denton Hall in Beijing.
Perhaps most chilling for busi
ness are regulations requiring
companies and individuals to reg

ister with the government, by
Monday, all software used to pro
tect transfers of sensitive informa
tion.
They require companies to
hand over the serial numbers and
list the employees using the soft
ware. possibly making it easier for
the government to track use.
So-called encryption software is
used to prevent prying into every
thing from electronic mail to bank
ing settlements. Popular products
like Netscape Web browsers con
tain encryption software, as do
some Microsoft products.
China passed the regulations
quietly in October. But the foreign
business community became
alarmed when the commission
published a follow-up directive in
November.
That order said that foreign
companies wishing to sell products
using encryption software — such
as programs that operate Web
sites — would have to submit the
source code. or software
blueprints. Software deemed unac
ceptable would have to be
replaced with Chinese encryption
software.
"This can potentially compro
mise the trade secrets of compa
nies," said Jay Hu of the United
States Information Technology

Office, an industry lobbying
group.
The clampdown also highlights
government fears about the use of
encrypted communications by
political dissidents and the banned
Falun Gong spiritual movement.
Falun Gong followers have used e
mail and the Internet to meet and
hold protests in defiance of a six
month ban.
Chinese Web sites have dis
played a liveliness unfound in the
traditional and wholly state-con
trolled media. In recent months,
Web sites have carried reports on
tests of a new submarine-launched
missile and a wide-ranging corrup
tion scandal that has threatened to
ensnare a senior party leader —
both unreported by official media.
That lack of restraint comes
despite repeated government reg
ulations meant to bring the Inter
net under control. China has set up
a special police force to monitor
the Internet and.in criminal trials,
has accused political dissidents
and leaders of Falun Gong of dis
seminating anti-government views
and state secrets on the Web.
Still. Internet use soars. Official
media reported that in the last six
months of 1999, users more than
doubled from 4 million to 8.9 mil
lion.
