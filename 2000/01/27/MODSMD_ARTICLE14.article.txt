The battle for Elian Gonza
lez is political grandstand
ing between rival nations

The battle for Cuba's 6-
year-old Elian Gonzalez
might be touching if it
weren't just a lot of huffing and
posturing between two rival
nations.
It is purely hypocritical of the
United States, a nation that must
deal with a large illegal immigra
tion problem, to fight so hard for
a small boy who is not a citizen
of this country and who arrived
here on a raft.
Funny how the best illegal
Cuban immigrants tend to make
good political statements, or be
pitchers for the New York Yan
kees.
The fight over Gonzalez is
nothing but grandstanding
between the political officials of
the United States and Cuba.
Gonzalez should be sent home
to his family immediately. If this
country wants to champion a
cause, it should pick one that
doesn't make it look so foolish.
Is the entire nation to believe
that its leaders truly care about
this one little boy? There are
several underprivileged and dis
advantaged youths in this coun
try, why not worry about them?
It would appear that Gonzalez
has plenty of people willing to
take care of him waiting back in
Cuba.
There are those who truly

believe that Gonzalez would be
better off in the United States
than he would be in Cuba. There
are those who believe this
because they have first-hand
knowledge of Cuba. These peo
ple should be commended for
their compassion, but there is
enough work to be done at
home. Their compassion is not
worth being wasted on the polit
ical games the United States and
Cuba play.
Another disturbing fact is that
Congress is considering making
this boy a U.S. citizen in order to
keep him here. It would be hard
to imagine the same Congress
opening its arms to every Cuban
refugee that managed to make it
into Florida. What precedent
would this set for the nation's
immigration laws?
At some point one has to
wonder if this boy's father and
grandmothers, all of whom wish
for his return to Cuba, matter at
all. This isn't an abandoned
child. He has people who care
for him. He lost the only family
that attempted to make the trip
to the United States with him.
Its time to send him where he's
truly wanted, llnat isn't neces
sarily Cuba; but it is with his
family.
The United States doesn't
need this silly fight. There are
plenty of people within this
country that could use such an
outpouring of love and affection.
We should send Gonzalez home
and refocus our attention.
