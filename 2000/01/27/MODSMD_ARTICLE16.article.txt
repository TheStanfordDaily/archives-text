# Meaning in the macro
## Awaiting the real world 
### 
Sasha Polonsky

I was certainly a leader
on my nursery school
campus. I knew how to
take charge, how to get
attention, how to play with
peers and how to argue my
opinion.
Those were the days

when "what do you want to be when you
grow up?" seemed like the most benign of
questions. An artist, a doctor, a dancer. The
answers constantly changed, but my non
chalant sentiment was static. I had so long
to decide. The prospects seemed infinite ...
Perhaps the best quality of nostalgia is
the freedom it allows us to re-evaluate and
in some cases reconstrue the good parts of
the past, in order to make some sense of the
present. I find that the harder task is look
ing forward, trying to figure out, and in most
cases guess, where in fact we are headed.
At Stanford, true self-evaluation and
goal-setting are difficult challenges. Feel
ings of inadequacy and anxiety about falling
short of potential are more common here
than we will ever admit. We are ducks pad
dling too fast, brushing aside stress and
depression lest we get lost on the shallow
end of the pond.
For the seniors, as graduation approach
es, the sense of both uncertainty and immi
nence invites a Hood of ideas, thoughts, and
reflections about our accomplishments, our
self-worth and the way we've used our time
for the past four years.
A lot of us are scared. We are scared to
face who we are and what we have become,
terrified to market ourselves in the "real
world" we have been hearing about since
nursery school, that time when such fears
were too distant to matter.
Finding ourselves suddenly presented
with our futures and career goals only
months from actualization, we are held
back by an overwhelming sense of uncer
tainty. Our inadequacies become exacer
bated by a series of corporate or academic
rejections, making us doubt the selves we've
come to believe in throughout long aca

demic careers.
We've all shared the experience recently,
whether on a grad school application, a med
school interview, or consulting case study,
of feeling utterly uncertain about what the
sum total of our experience thus far is sup
posed to signify. People ask us in an inter
view to describe the last time we changed
the world, and we panic.
Twenty-one years old and we still can't
succinctly express the most recent example
of "changing the world." Instead of laugh
ing at the peculiarity and comedy of the cir
cumstance, we merely add this to the stock
pile of our academic kryptonite.
And it's enough already.
I have seen too much doubt and self
deprecation on this campus. If it's the last
thing I say in my final column, I want our
Class of 2(MM) to give the anxiety a rest.
Many of us are in the same boat, con
stantly on-edge about this next step we are
expected to take after commencement in
June. Well. I think it's about time we start
acknowledging just how capable we are.
Enough with the inadequacy game.
Granted, going about rebuilding a some
what wounded sense of confidence is taxing.
We've spent the past three and a half years
surrounded by stars. I think it's been a while
since many of us felt like we really excelled.
Can you remember the last time you truly
felt like a winner, a star?
When I was five, my mother used to call
me a "coach's dream." She said I had the
kind of stamina, determination and ability
to learn and concentrate that was really val
ued on a team. I was a leader, but was also
skilled at taking direction. At five years old,
I was a star.
I wish I could say that those infallible
capabilities still applied to my life today.
But I was five — those were the days before
we moved on from addition and subtrac
tion. Mv leadership potential in kinder
garten is now little consolation or assurance
of my success beyond anything more
advanced than sharing toys and not hitting
people.

But our current selves are more complex
than simple resume bullets and technical
skills. I worry that we get too wrapped up in
quantifying our self-worth that we forget to
notice the obvious, the fact that we are
graduating from college. From Stanford. So
many experiences in four short years...
and yet the focus is still worry and competi
tion.
It's time for some reflection, some time
to think back on how far we have traveled,
how much inexpressible joy has been cou
pled with indescribable pain. I think we
need to remember how complex we are,
and include these parts of our past in our
own self-assessment.
Some of us have seen tragedy. Many of
us have felt love. But we take little time to
reflect. We're too quick to forget about the
meaning in the macro.
Our lives are all full of battles and real
izations; we are armed with more strength
and capability than we can possibly under
stand.
Nostalgia and reflection not only help us
with self-definition, but also remind us that
so much in the past suggests so much more
to look forward to.
I have felt privileged to have the oppor
tunity to grow and develop with the support
and inspiration of my outstanding class
mates and dedicated friends in this commu
nity. Our collective distance traveled since
'% is great, and we have many achieve
ments and experiences to be thankful for.
Let's keep that in mind and see the wine
glass as half-full when we make our next
Senior Pub Night toast, or the next time
we're asked if you've decided what we want
to be "when you grow up."
In the meantime, keep paddling toward
the horizon, but take some time to just glide
and remember that you are all standouts
and stars. Don't forget that.

Twenty-one years old and we still can't
succinctly express the most recent example
of "changing the world." Instead of laugh
ing at the peculiarity and comedy of the cir
cumstance, we merely add this to the stock
pile of our academic kryptonite.
And it's enough already.
I have seen too much doubt and self
deprecation on this campus. If it's the last
thing I say in my final column, I want our
Class of 2(MM) to give the anxiety a rest.
Many of us are in the same boat, con
stantly on-edge about this next step we are
expected to take after commencement in
June. Well. I think it's about time we start
acknowledging just how capable we are.
Enough with the inadequacy game.
Granted, going about rebuilding a some
what wounded sense of confidence is taxing.
We've spent the past three and a half years
surrounded by stars. I think it's been a while
since many of us felt like we really excelled.
Can you remember the last time you truly
felt like a winner, a star?
When I was five, my mother used to call
me a "coach's dream." She said I had the
kind of stamina, determination and ability
to learn and concentrate that was really val
ued on a team. I was a leader, but was also
skilled at taking direction. At five years old,
I was a star.
I wish I could say that those infallible
capabilities still applied to my life today.
But I was five — those were the days before
we moved on from addition and subtrac
tion. Mv leadership potential in kinder
garten is now little consolation or assurance
of my success beyond anything more
advanced than sharing toys and not hitting
people.

But our current selves are more complex
than simple resume bullets and technical
skills. I worry that we get too wrapped up in
quantifying our self-worth that we forget to
notice the obvious, the fact that we are
graduating from college. From Stanford. So
many experiences in four short years...
and yet the focus is still worry and competi
tion.
It's time for some reflection, some time
to think back on how far we have traveled,
how much inexpressible joy has been cou
pled with indescribable pain. I think we
need to remember how complex we are,
and include these parts of our past in our
own self-assessment.
Some of us have seen tragedy. Many of
us have felt love. But we take little time to
reflect. We're too quick to forget about the
meaning in the macro.
Our lives are all full of battles and real
izations; we are armed with more strength
and capability than we can possibly under
stand.
Nostalgia and reflection not only help us
with self-definition, but also remind us that
so much in the past suggests so much more
to look forward to.
I have felt privileged to have the oppor
tunity to grow and develop with the support
and inspiration of my outstanding class
mates and dedicated friends in this commu
nity. Our collective distance traveled since
'% is great, and we have many achieve
ments and experiences to be thankful for.
Let's keep that in mind and see the wine
glass as half-full when we make our next
Senior Pub Night toast, or the next time
we're asked if you've decided what we want
to be "when you grow up."
In the meantime, keep paddling toward
the horizon, but take some time to just glide
and remember that you are all standouts
and stars. Don't forget that.

read or reacted to her column this volume.
Keep up the dialogue, and keep up the cri
tique! To the Class of 2(HH), all the best!
