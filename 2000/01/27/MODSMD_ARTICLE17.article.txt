Improving service
I would like to offer an easy suggestion
for the Stanford Post Office to improve ser
vice while the White Pla/a building is being
renovated.
It would he a great convenience to every
one if the post office could install a mailbox
in White Pla/a. Right now, the only loca
tions of mailboxes in the center of the cam
pus are outside Encina 1 lall and outside the
temporary post office.
Both of these locations are inconvenient
and out-of-the way, especially to simply
drop a letter in a mailbox. Installing a mail
box in White Plaza, a convenient central
location, would greatly alleviate this prob
lem.

Freshman, Undeclared
Arboretum should be devel
oped before Foothills
In the late summer of IKK6, Leland Stan
ford met with landscape architect Frederick
Law Olmstead regarding the layout of the
University.
While Olmstead preferred a knoll over
looking the San Francisco Bay. (the

Foothills), Stanford preferred what was
then an alfalfa field because it would allow
the University to expand.
In the wake of the I Jniversity's new Land
Use Plan, what can be gained by Leland
Stanford's foresight?
In the Jan. 25 issue of The Daily, alum
nus Donald Price defended preserving the
Arboretum area of campus because the
Stanford family created it to preserve open
space near the Quad. But this is only par
tially true. Fearing the creep of new housing
and parking lots, Price opposes the reclassi
fication of the Arboretum as "Campus Cen
ter" and "Ouarry" in the new plan. His con
cerns are justified, but misplaced.
When Price graduated in 1953 and 1958,
the Stanford campus was physically very
different. There was no Library Quad, Ster
ling Quad or Science and Engineering
Ouad. As the University grew, so did the
need for increased housing and educational
space. As the University prepares for the
growth of the next century, the question
remains: Where should Stanford grow? If
not the Arboretum, then where?
Far more disturbing than the reclassifica
tion of the Arboretum is the reclassification
of the Stanford Foothills as "Academic
Reserve." Long term, this means that class
rooms, scholarly retreats and other such

buildings may also swallow up the foothills
piece by piece. While the non-native euca
lyptus groves of the Arboretum are beauti
ful, they are not nearly as biologically
diverse or ecologically important as the
Stanford Foothills. If development is neces
sary. should it not be in the most "logical"
and least environmentally damaging loca
tion?
Somewhere in development alternatives,
there must lay a compromise between man
and nature, and before Stanford expands
further, into even more "valuable" areas,
perhaps the Administration should consid
er infill alternatives like the Arboretum.
Development is a necessary evil. Unfortu
nately, the Arboretum is a "better" location
to develop than the Foothills.

Time to approve Stanford
Land Use Plan
Having watched and participated in the
process of evaluation for the Stanford Land
Use plan, 1 believe it is time to give approval
and move forward.
There is no question that Stanford is a

major influence in this region and, as such,
that the institution engenders animosity for
its success. However, it does not deserve to
be treated as a villain in spite of (or. as some
speakers suggest, because of) its involve
ment in the growth and prosperity of our
region.
There has been significant compromise
on the part of the University during this
process. The definition of compromise
requires action on both sides of the issue.
The action has been disproportionately
from Stanford. The confrontational tone of
those protesting the plan has not fostered
resolution but rather dissolution for the pro
posal.
Stanford needs to be accountable for its
plan, its action, its implementation. To ask
the University or any entity to foresee for
ever is unrealistic and leaves everyone a
loser.
Let us move ahead, with appropriate
restrictions on the University's autonomy,
so that the housing and learning facilities
can be of use and value within the lifetimes
of at least some of us who have been attend
ing these meetings.
