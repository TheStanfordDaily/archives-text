## Card takes on cellar-dwelling UW, WSU Pac-10 walkovers not to be taken lightly in key home matchup 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Back in November, the media voted
Washington and Washington State ninth
and l()th, respectively, in its preseason
Pacific 10 Conference poll. Many nation
al basketball magazines did the same.
And after three weekends of Pac-10
play, the situation has not changed.
Washington (6-12. 1-5 Pac-10) sits ninth
in the conference standings. Washington
State (5-10.0-6) 10th.
Unarguably, they are the two worst
teams in the Pac-10.
Still, these cellar dwellars lost to No. 5
Arizona by just a combined 12 points and
both took Oregon to overtime. Are these
teams really bad. or is the fact that they sit
at the bottom of the league simply anoth-

"We're a very good basketball confer

Montgomery. "What makes a good con

are still competitive, and that's true in the
Pac-10."

A year ago only one conference team
got past the first round of the NCAA
Tournament. However, even that squad,
the second-seeded Cardinal, was upset in
the second round.

While the tournament is still more
than a month away, the Pac-10 has done
a fine job of redeeming itself. Four teams
— No. 2 Stanford, the fifth-ranked Wild
eats. No. 20 UCLA, and No. 23 USC —
are ranked this week and another, third
place Oregon, is on the cusp.
In fact, the conference is rated second
in all three conference power ratings. The
Pac-10 is 6-0 against the mighty Big 10
(No. 1 in all three), 5-4 against the ACC
(No. 3 in the Sagarin ratings), 3-1 against
the SEC (No. 3 in the RPI Report) and 4-
0 against Conference USA (No. 3 in CBS
Sportsline).

team in conference, everyone was sur
