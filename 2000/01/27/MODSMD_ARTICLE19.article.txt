## Card takes on cellar-dwelling UW, WSU Pac-10 walkovers not to be taken lightly in key home matchup 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Back in November, the media voted
Washington and Washington State ninth
and l()th, respectively, in its preseason
Pacific 10 Conference poll. Many nation
al basketball magazines did the same.
And after three weekends of Pac-10
play, the situation has not changed.
Washington (6-12. 1-5 Pac-10) sits ninth
in the conference standings. Washington
State (5-10.0-6) 10th.
Unarguably, they are the two worst
teams in the Pac-10.
Still, these cellar dwellars lost to No. 5
Arizona by just a combined 12 points and
both took Oregon to overtime. Are these
teams really bad. or is the fact that they sit
at the bottom of the league simply anoth-

ic 10 Conference) vs. Washington (6-12.1-
5), 7:30 p.m.. Maples Pavilion. TV: Bay
TV.

A year ago only one conference team
got past the first round of the NCAA
Tournament. However, even that squad,
the second-seeded Cardinal, was upset in
the second round.

While the tournament is still more
than a month away, the Pac-10 has done
a fine job of redeeming itself. Four teams
— No. 2 Stanford, the fifth-ranked Wild
eats. No. 20 UCLA, and No. 23 USC —
are ranked this week and another, third
place Oregon, is on the cusp.
In fact, the conference is rated second
in all three conference power ratings. The
Pac-10 is 6-0 against the mighty Big 10
(No. 1 in all three), 5-4 against the ACC
(No. 3 in the Sagarin ratings), 3-1 against
the SEC (No. 3 in the RPI Report) and 4-
0 against Conference USA (No. 3 in CBS
Sportsline).
"It used to be that if you lost to a bad
team in conference, everyone was sur
prised," Montgomery said. "But if some

team lost at Clcmson (a lower-rung
team in the ACCJ, people would
say, 'Oh, Clcmson. That's all right,
they must he good, they're in the
ACCY It's not that way anymore."
That may be a plus come tourna
ment time, but right now it means
that even with Washington coming
into Maples Pavilion tonight and
Washington State riding in Satur
day afternoon, there is no "oil
weekend" for Montgomery and
Stanford (15-1.4-1).
" I here's no room for compla
cency in the Pac-10." Montgomery
said. "The ones that stay hungry and
stay interested and focused will be
on top at the end of the season."
And on top is exactly where the
defending conference champions
want to be. Lven at No. 2 in the na
tion with a sparkling 15-1 record,

Montgomery has one complaint.
"We're not in first place in our
league," he said.
That alone should keep the fiery
Cardinal interested in this week
end's slate. Combined, the 1 luskies
and Cougars have lost their last 12
games. But, Montgomery stressed,
these are not cupcakes.
"They're not playing poorly,
they're just having a hard time win
ning." he said.
Last year, the Huskies concen
trated their offense around center
Todd MacCulloch and the outside
play of guards Deon Luton, Donald
Watts and Scnque Carev. That
strategy led Washington to its sec
ond-straight NCAA Tournament
appearance.
But with MacCulloch, the
NCAA leader in field-goal percent
age for three straight seasons, gone
to the NBA and Watts gone to real
life, things are a little different in
Seattle.

Luton is averaging 15.4 points
per game and Carey, a native of
East Palo Alto, is adding 12.9
points, 4.4 rebounds and 5.3 assists.
Still, without a strong supporting
east and little muscle inside, they
have struggled to lead the team.
Alter the last four seasons under
coach Kevin Eastman, when Wash
ington State slipped from seventh,
toeighth. to ninth and finally to l()th
in the conference, change was wel
come in Pullman. But even with a
new coach, Paul Graham, a former
assistant at (Oklahoma State, life has
been difficult for the Cougars.
Seniors Chris Crosby and Jan-
Michael Thomas lead Washington
State with 16.7 and 15.0 points per
game, respectively, and sophomore
slasher Mike Bush adds another
12.4. Still, the team struggles to
score points, notching only 6K a
game.
That may lead to an especially
slow, unwatchable game Saturday.

The Cougars, who put up the least
points in the conference, meet the
Cardinal, which allows the fewest
points, only 58 a game.
Nevertheless, Montgomery
wants the full attention of his play
ers in the midst of a surprisingly
competitive Pac-10 race.
Lest they forget the taste.of los
ing to a supposedly inferior team,
Montgomery is not afraid to remind
his charges of another squad from
Washington state that humbled a
hyped-up Stanford team not so long
ago. '
"You can't allow yourself to
look at the other team and say,
'Gonzaga, they're not that good,' "
he said, referring to the upstart that
knocked Stanford out of the
NCAA Tournament last March. "If
you do, oops. Now what do you
do?"
If you're Montgomery, just hope
you don't have to answer that ques
tion anytime soon.

defending conference champions
want to be. Lven at No. 2 in the na
tion with a sparkling 15-1 record,

Montgomery has one complaint.
"We're not in first place in our
league," he said.
That alone should keep the fiery
Cardinal interested in this week
end's slate. Combined, the 1 luskies
and Cougars have lost their last 12
games. But, Montgomery stressed,
these are not cupcakes.
"They're not playing poorly,
they're just having a hard time win
ning." he said.
Last year, the Huskies concen
trated their offense around center
Todd MacCulloch and the outside
play of guards Deon Luton, Donald
Watts and Scnque Carev. That
strategy led Washington to its sec
ond-straight NCAA Tournament
appearance.
But with MacCulloch, the
NCAA leader in field-goal percent
age for three straight seasons, gone
to the NBA and Watts gone to real
life, things are a little different in
Seattle.

Luton is averaging 15.4 points
per game and Carey, a native of
East Palo Alto, is adding 12.9
points, 4.4 rebounds and 5.3 assists.
Still, without a strong supporting
east and little muscle inside, they
have struggled to lead the team.
Alter the last four seasons under
coach Kevin Eastman, when Wash
ington State slipped from seventh,
toeighth. to ninth and finally to l()th
in the conference, change was wel
come in Pullman. But even with a
new coach, Paul Graham, a former
assistant at (Oklahoma State, life has
been difficult for the Cougars.
Seniors Chris Crosby and Jan-
Michael Thomas lead Washington
State with 16.7 and 15.0 points per
game, respectively, and sophomore
slasher Mike Bush adds another
12.4. Still, the team struggles to
score points, notching only 6K a
game.
That may lead to an especially
slow, unwatchable game Saturday.

The Cougars, who put up the least
points in the conference, meet the
Cardinal, which allows the fewest
points, only 58 a game.
Nevertheless, Montgomery
wants the full attention of his play
ers in the midst of a surprisingly
competitive Pac-10 race.
Lest they forget the taste.of los
ing to a supposedly inferior team,
Montgomery is not afraid to remind
his charges of another squad from
Washington state that humbled a
hyped-up Stanford team not so long
ago. '
"You can't allow yourself to
look at the other team and say,
'Gonzaga, they're not that good,' "
he said, referring to the upstart that
knocked Stanford out of the
NCAA Tournament last March. "If
you do, oops. Now what do you
do?"
If you're Montgomery, just hope
you don't have to answer that ques
tion anytime soon.
Back in November, the media voted
Washington and Washington State ninth
and l()th, respectively, in its preseason
Pacific 10 Conference poll. Many nation
al basketball magazines did the same.
And after three weekends of Pac-10
play, the situation has not changed.
Washington (6-12. 1-5 Pac-10) sits ninth
in the conference standings. Washington
State (5-10.0-6) 10th.
Unarguably, they are the two worst
teams in the Pac-10.
Still, these cellar dwellars lost to No. 5
Arizona by just a combined 12 points and
both took Oregon to overtime. Are these
teams really bad. or is the fact that they sit
at the bottom of the league simply anoth-

"We're a very good basketball confer

are still competitive, and that's true in the
Pac-10."

MEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Tonight: No. 2 Stanford (15-1,4-1 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) vs. Washington (6-12.1-
5), 7:30 p.m.. Maples Pavilion. TV: Bay
TV.

A year ago only one conference team
got past the first round of the NCAA
Tournament. However, even that squad,
the second-seeded Cardinal, was upset in
the second round.

While the tournament is still more
than a month away, the Pac-10 has done
a fine job of redeeming itself. Four teams
— No. 2 Stanford, the fifth-ranked Wild
eats. No. 20 UCLA, and No. 23 USC —
are ranked this week and another, third
place Oregon, is on the cusp.
In fact, the conference is rated second
in all three conference power ratings. The
Pac-10 is 6-0 against the mighty Big 10
(No. 1 in all three), 5-4 against the ACC
(No. 3 in the Sagarin ratings), 3-1 against
the SEC (No. 3 in the RPI Report) and 4-
0 against Conference USA (No. 3 in CBS
Sportsline).
"It used to be that if you lost to a bad
team in conference, everyone was sur
prised," Montgomery said. "But if some

team lost at Clcmson (a lower-rung
team in the ACCJ, people would
say, 'Oh, Clcmson. That's all right,
they must he good, they're in the
ACCY It's not that way anymore."
That may be a plus come tourna
ment time, but right now it means
that even with Washington coming
into Maples Pavilion tonight and
Washington State riding in Satur
day afternoon, there is no "oil
weekend" for Montgomery and
Stanford (15-1.4-1).
" I here's no room for compla
cency in the Pac-10." Montgomery
said. "The ones that stay hungry and
stay interested and focused will be
on top at the end of the season."
