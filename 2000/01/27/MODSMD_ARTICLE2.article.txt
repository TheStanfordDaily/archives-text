# Mars lander contacting Dish?
## Stanford scientists listening for signs that NASA probe is still operating

In what could potentially be a
stunning turn of events for NASA's
Mars program, Stanford scientists
will determine today whether faint
radio signals being picked up by the
Dish are originating from the $165-
million Mars Polar Lander, which
was feared lost last month.
Researchers at Stanford's Space
Telecommunications and Radio
Science Laboratory are working in
conjunction with scientists at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in Pasadena in efforts to establish
contact with the lander, which
NASA officials had nearly given up
on after it failed to communicate
after entering Mars* atmosphere
Dec. 3.
According to Stanford STAR
Lab's Ivan Linscott, a senior re
search associate, faint signals cap
tured by the Dish on Dec. IS and
Jan. 4 possessed a pitch and fre
quency that resembled the lander's
radio patterns.
On those occasions, Linscott
said, "We found what looked like a
candidate signal that was much
weaker than it should have been if it
came from the lander, but possessed
some of the characteristics we
thought that we would see."
Linscott said J PL scientists have
been sending commands to the lan
der since Tuesday instructing it to
repeat its communications with the
150-foot wide Dish, one of the na
tion's largest radio / radar tele

scopes.
"JPL is telling us that the com
mands they sent up [Tuesday] might
have been received on Mars when
the lander was asleep. Commands
were sent up again [today] with the
certainty that the lander would be
awake," Linscott said yesterday.
"Should we find the signal similar
to what we saw earlier, there will be
a great deal of confidence that we're
seeing something coming from the
Mars lander." he added.
Officials are quick to emphasize
that the chances of the lander re
sponding to the commands are
small.

Polar Lander Project Manager
Richard Cook told reporters at J PL
Tuesday. "It's a real long shot, and I
wouldn't want to get anyone too ex
cited about it."
According to (3. Leonard Tyler,
former director of STAR Lab and
the leader of STAR's Mars Global
Surveyor project, the signals re
ceived by the Dish may have origi
nated from countless other sources.
"In the Bay Area, there are thou
sands of electronics companies gen
erating signals of all kinds. We can't
be sure about anything unless we ex
amine ii very closely," Tyler said.
"The stakes are verv high. We

can't afford to make a mistake on
this," he added.
Linscott agreed, saying re
searchers must fight through a great
deal of local interference when
searching for a signal from Mars.
"We're looking at the Dish in the
middle of a great interference
storm, so we must be extremely cau
tious." he said.
Even if researchers at the STAR
Lab confirm that the signals are
coming from Mars, the Polar Lan
der mission will hardly be out of the
woods.

The Mars Polar Lander, which has been silent since landing Dec. 3, could finally be showing signs of life,
as researchers have picked up signals at the Dish that might be originating from the Red Planet.
