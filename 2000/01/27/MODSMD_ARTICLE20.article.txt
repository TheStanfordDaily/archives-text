# Huskies, 'Cougs await
## Women's hoops squad takes on UW, WSU 
### Ben Freda Editorial staff 
The Washington Huskies are
going to need more just the home
court advantage if they are going
to unseat the No. 24 Cardinal
tonight at Kev Arena in Seattle.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Tonight: No. 24 Stanford (11-4.4
1 Pacific 10 Conference) at Washing
ton (5-13, 1-5), 7 p.m.

That's because the Cardinal
women (11-4, 4-1 Pacific 10 Con
ference) are hot — and the
Huskies are not.
The Cardinal, which sits a single
game back of UCLA in the Pac-10
standings, brings a four-game win
ning streak to Seattle against the
Huskies.
Washington (5-13, 1-5), on the
other hand, sits near the bottom of
the conference and has lost three
straight games, including a devas
tating 78-59 loss against Oregon
State on Saturday.
The Cardinal's Saturday went a
little differently. Against rival Cal
ifornia, Stanford was far out ahead
from the opening gun.
"We had a good start tonight,"
said head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"That's goal No. 1 for us."
The Cardinal certainly met that
goal, opening the game on a 22-3
run and never trailing.
The only trouble spot for the
Cardinal was during the first half,
when the Cal squad warmed up

enough to make a 12-0 run that cut
the score to 22-15. But the Cardi
nal answered by scoring 21 of the
final 2t> and took a 43-20 lead into
ha I ft i me.
The Cardinal crusied to the
final buzzer with few problems,
thanks in part to the dominant play
of sophomore Lindsey Yamasaki.
She posted 17 points, including 12
straight at the end of the first half.
Things haven't been nearly as
bright for the Huskies of late.
Saturday's loss to Oregon State
featured a Washington team as flat
as the state is mountainous. The
squad could only manage 37.3 per
cent shooting (22 for 59) and were
outrebounded 47-30.
A few driVs befort. ttie team tell
short against Oregon, 65-51.
Hut the Huskies lack of wins re
cently doesn't mean that they
don't have any weapons.
In fact, the statistics are quite
the contrary. The Hukies have
both the No. 1 and No. 2 scorers in
the conference: junior Megan
Franza (19.0 points per game) and
freshman Loree Payne (17.8 points
per game).
Payne is a big-time threat from
bevong the three-point arc. She
has 38 three-pointers in 121 at
tempts this season.
But the Cardinal should be able
to match the Huskies outside. The
Cardinal enters the weekend with
three of the top four three-point
percentage shooters in the confer

ence in sohpomore Lauren St.
Clair, freshman Jamie Carey and
senior Milena Flores. Stanford
leads the conference in both
three-point percentage (.420) and
three-pointers per game (7.40).
Usually, a trip to the state of
Washington means good things
for the Cardinal, which has won
11 straight games in the state dat
ing back to Jan. 8, 1994. The Car
dinal leads the overall series with
the Huskies 20-10 and has won 10
of the last 11 meetings. The one
loss against Washington came last
season at Stanford.
The Cardinal faces Washign
ton State (3-13, 0-6) on Saturday.
The Cardinal is an amazing 28-0
against the Cougars. Twenty-four
of the victories were by more than
10 points.
And this year's team doesn't
look like it will be the one to
break the streak. The Cougars are
on a four-game losing streak and
have yet to get their first league
victory.
Tonight's game starts at 7 p.m.
in Seattle.
