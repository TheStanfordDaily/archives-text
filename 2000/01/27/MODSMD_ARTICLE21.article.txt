The painful memory of Cardi
nal baseball's season-ending,
extra-inning loss last June at the
College World Series in Omaha,
Neb., may continue to haunt the
program's fans, but this year's
team hopes to move forward —
and quickly.
The 2000 Cardinal returns a
battle-tested core of experienced
players, including five preseason
All-Americans, that has earned it
a No. 1 ranking in each of the three
major preseason polls (Baseball
America, Collegiate Baseball,
IJSA Today Baseball Weekly).
Head coach Mark Marquess re
turns 15 letter-winners from last
year's third-place campaign, in
cluding seven starting position
players and his entire starting rota
tion. The experience of this sea
son's Cardinal provides Marquess
with the luxury of slowly easing his
talented freshmen along while
watching his veterans continue to
produce.
"The strength of this team obvi
ously lies in its returnees," he said.
The most impressive feature of

has done consistently since joining
the starting rotation last spring.
Marquess believes in his staff's
ability to perform at the high level
of achievement it set last year;
however, he accepts the difficulty
of piling up similar statistics this
season.
"I think they can pitch as well as
they did last year and not have the
same numbers," he said. Barring
injury, he claims, all three pitchers
stand to have excellent seasons
once again.
Completing the team's battery

is senior catcher Damien Alvara

and the pitching staff maintain an
aggressive philosophy, bringing
increased importance to his role as
the team's backstop. In addition.
Alvarado has the ability to shut
down the opposition's running
game with his strong arm.
As if having one of the nation's
top pitching corps were not
enough, the Cardinal also boasts a
balanced, power-hitting lineup in-

Senior third baseman John Gall celebrates his grand slam at last year s College World Series. The Cardinal

polls.

chard, a projected first-round draft
pick and backup Stanford quarter
back. Last season. All-America
honors followed a remarkable sea
son in which he hit .372 while belt
ing 11 home runs and collecting 56
RBIs. Though some believe that
Borchard's predicted draft value
will mean his departure from Stan
ford at the end of the season, the
three-year starter will not allow
himself to lose his focus amidst the
hype surrounding his future.

"Thinking about [the draft] too
prematurely would be doing your
self an injustice," Borchard said.
Marquess' power-laden lineup
card continues with seniors Ed
mund Muth (center field, .305, 6,
30) and John Gall (third base, .337,
12, 70). Muth's ability to hit for
both average and power will most
likely land him in the third spot in
the batting order.
(Jail comes into the season with
stellar career production at the
plate that gives him a legitimate
shot to become the all-time school

parture of Josh Hochgesang. a
four-year starter for the Cardinal.
"1 worked out [at third) over
the summer . . . and right now I'm
starting to feel really comfortable
there," he said.
The most pressing issue for the
Cardinal this season is its lack of a
dominant closer to replace Tony
Cogan, the inspirational lefty that
tallied seven wins and eight saves
in 1999.
Several scenarios include using
either one of Cardinal sopho
mores J.D. Willcox (2-1, 6.4b) and
Mike Wodnieki (3-0. 5.57). Mar
quess will evaluate his entire relief

pitching staff over the first month
of the season, hoping one of the
relievers emerges with the men
tality and physical resilience need
ed to become the team's full-time
closer.
Thus far, the team's lofty No. I
ranking has not distracted the
coaches and players, who are all
aware that an extremely difficult
season lies ahead.
Stanford will face the nine
teams competing in the reunified
powerhouse Pacific 10 Confer
ence in addition to 17 nonconfer
ence games against teams ranked
in the top 25. Headlining the sea
son are the opening home series

against N't). 2 Cal State-Fullerton
(Feb. 4-6) and a trip to Tallahas
see, Fla., to settle the score with
last year's World Series foe. No. 7
Florida State (Feb. 11-13).
Marquess and his team know
that a top preseason ranking will
not hold up on its own against
such daunting competition.
"We're taking it in stride," he
said, understanding that anything
can happen over the course of a
long, difficult season.
Consistent play, health, and an
element of luck will need to play
roles if Stanford hopes to make its
third back-to-back appearance in
Omaha in school history.
