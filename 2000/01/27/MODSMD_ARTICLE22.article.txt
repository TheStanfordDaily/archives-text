# SEQ palms damaged by wrappings
## Covers cause trees to suffer from lack of sun exposure

Would you leave $2.(HX) tied in
burlap for months in the middle of
campus? Stanford's Department of
Facilities and Grounds has found il
self in this unfortunate situation, as
contractors inadvertently left expen
sive palm trees wrapped since in
stalling them in the new Science and
Engineering Quad last September.
Passing the new SEQ. many stu
dents have noticed the unusual palm
trees lining the walkway leading from
the Main Quad into the land of tech
nological marvel.
As a result of months under
burlap covering without exposure to
sunlight, the new palm trees are what
Facilities and Grounds Manager
I lerb Fong termed "a bright yellow."
According to Fong, the leaves lack
chlorophyll, a chemical that cannot
develop without sunlight. Chloro
phyll gives trees and other plants

their usual greenish hue.
Contractors planted the trees,
known as California fan palms, last
September at the price of $2.(M)0
apiece. According to Fong. the con
tractors were "slow to respond" to

the University's requests to remove
the burlap covering used in transport
ing the trees from California nurs
eries to their new home at Stanford.
Fong said the trees will be back to
normal in two to three weeks. I low

ever, the trees are not out of danger
yet.
Fong said the cloud\ weather at
Stanford has been \er\ fortunate
but the trees "could sunburn because
of sudden exposure" to sunlight.

The $2,000 palm trees in the new Science and Engineering Quad have been damaged by burlap wrap
pings, but should be healthy with a couple of weeks.
