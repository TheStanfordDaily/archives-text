## 
### Greg Page Contributing writer 
As the ( 'alilbrnin primary approaches. Stan
lord I'or Bradley is out in lull foree. registering
and informing voters. The group, led and
founded by sophomore k.C. George, is work
ing on campus as well as in the community, pro
moting the campaign of former Senator Bill
Bradley, a Democratic presidential hopeful.
The group consists of about 15 Stanford un
dergraduates who are promoting Bradley's
presidential bid through a flyer campaign, a
table in White Plaza and door-to-door canvass
ing in neighboring towns.

In addition to traditional campaigning meth
ods, Stanford for Bradley has taken its efforts to
cyberspace. The group has set up a Web site at
http://ca.students.stanford.edu. There, prospec
tive voters can find Bradley links and the candi
date's stances on major issues.
George credits the diverse interests of the
group members as one of its strongest assets.
"Everybody seems to be attracted to [Bradley)
for a different reason. Some like him for his for
eign policy, some like him for his character and
others like him for his stance on race," she said.
Sophomore Erika Soto is the point person
for the group's voter registration efforts. "We'll
be going door-to-door in dorms this week regis

tering Democratic voters." she said "We're
also planning to visit East Palo Alto to register
voters there."
One of the major items on the Stanford for
Bradley agenda is a series of Stanford Town
Hall Meetings, held every Wednesday from
7:(X)toB:3op.m. over five weeks. The weekly se
ries kicked off last night in Room ZW) of the Law
School, and is co-sponsored by the Stanford I de
mocrats' Gore-Bradlev Task Force.
They are open to the public, and will consist
of a series of speeches given by prominent Stan
ford professors in support of Bradley.
Themes for the speeches include leadership,
race and gender, health care, the economy and

foreign policy.
Last night, in the first town hall meeting,
leadership was the focus of a panel discussion
led by Political Science Prof. David Abernethy,
I listory Prof. David Kennedy, Nobel Prize-win
ning Physics Prof. Burt Richter and Compara
tive Literature Prof. Richard Rorty. Public Pol
icy lecturer Alison Alter moderated.
Kennedy spoke first, stressing his belief that
"leadership is ;i relationship between consent
ing persons." He added. "Mere exercise of
power is not in itself leadership. Americans are
partly uneasy about entering into a relationship
with leaders."
However, Kennedy praised
Bradley's leadership style, calling
Bradley a mix between the "task spe
cialist" type of leader, "able to push
an agenda, but at times engendering
and enduring conflict." and the
"process specialist, who can smooth
out differences [in a non-confronta
tional manner]."
Abernethy compared Bradley's
leadership ability with that of the
other presidential hopefuls. "Many

of his ideas." Abernethy said, "have
to do with linking people v\ ho would
otherwise have no communication.
His plans involve crossing lines be
tween the public and private sector,
between rich and poor."
Abernethy drew laughs from the
audience when he discussed intelli
gence. He said. "Here I would say
Bradley, [Vice President| Al Gore,
and John McCain are in one camp,
and [Texas (iov. George W.| Bush is
in the other."
Richter credited Bradley's "expe
rience in the outside world." stating
his belief that. "I lis four years out of
the Senate have made him a much

better candidate." Comparing
Bradley to his Democratic rival
Gore. Richter said. "Bradley is a
deeper thinker. Gore is too much of
an incremenlalist."
Rorty also highlighted Bradley's
visions for the future. All the candi
dates. Rorty said, should be able to
answer the question. "What kind of
country do you want to leave to your
successor?"
Rorty felt that among the candi
dates. Bradley is best equipped to an
swer this question. He said Bradley
could deal with the widening income
gap between the rich and the poor,
the threat of a stock market crash and

the problem of international arms
proliferation.
(Yilici/ing Presidents Bill ( 'linton
and George Bush. Rorty said. " I he
last two presidents have taken the
military industrial complex and nu :
clear arsenals as a fact of life."
Stanford for Bradley hopes not
only to promote the cause of its can
didate but political awareness in gen
eral.
"Our number one aim is educat
ing people on the issues and letting
them come to their own conclusions.
As a group, we're hoping they come
to the conclusion that Bradley's
stance is best," (iconic said.
