As the ( 'alilbrnin primary approaches. Stan

and informing voters. The group, led and
founded by sophomore k.C. George, is work

moting the campaign of former Senator Bill
Bradley, a Democratic presidential hopeful.
The group consists of about 15 Stanford un
dergraduates who are promoting Bradley's
presidential bid through a flyer campaign, a
table in White Plaza and door-to-door canvass
ing in neighboring towns.

ods, Stanford for Bradley has taken its efforts to
cyberspace. The group has set up a Web site at
http://ca.students.stanford.edu. There, prospec

George credits the diverse interests of the
group members as one of its strongest assets.
