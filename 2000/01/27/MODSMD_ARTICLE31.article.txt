## Turn It On Again Genesis 
### 
After 16 studio albums and 32 years of record
ing, Genesis has finally arrived with a greatest
hits album, appropriately titled "Turn It On
Again — The Hits."
Casual observers may wonder what took them so
long. After all. Genesis was one of the hugest pop trios
of the '80s, with such hits as "That's All" and "Land of
Confusion." However, by the time those songs were
released, the group had gone under a number of in
★★★★☆=
th e
time afterward, would undergo even more.
At the core of Genesis all these years have been
Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford, students at Char
terhouse School in England in the '60s. They and oth
ers spent an album or two cutting their teeth (with ro
tating members) until Genesis emerged as an album
oriented progressive-rock quintet. At that time, the
group consisted of the two original members plus gui
tarist Steve Hackett. drummer Phil Collins and their
adventurous and charismatic singer, Peter Gabriel.
The band amassed a large cult following, owing to
several complex albums and one fluke hit, "I Know
What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)." Then Gabriel left.
A few years later Hackett left as well. The trio sod
dered on with Collins on vocals, and the rest is pop his
tory as Genesis slowly turned from progressive to pop.
After Collins left in the mid-'9os, the two founding
members hired former Stiltskin vocalist Ray Wilson
for a 1997 album that returned them to their progres

sive-rock roots and went largely unnoticed.
However, it isn't quite so simple as prog-pop-prog;
tension between progressive music and pop music has
always been a part of Genesis, from their first album
to their most recent hits.
This may explain why there hasn't been a Greatest
Hits before now and why this one is titled and pack
aged so simply — no lyrics or explanations, just mini
mal song info. This is a collection of hits for those who
really don't care to delve into the albums or want a few
tracks not already present in their collection. As the
title would indicate, they've assembled those tracks
that are best-known to the public, and there's not one
missing.
Consequently, half these tracks are from their two
pop-oriented smashes— 1986's "Invisible Touch" and
1991's "We Can't Dance." "I Know What I Like" is
the only hint of what many fans and critics view as

their peak period in the mid-'7os.
1974's "Carpet Crawlers" is here
too, as a 1999 recording by the reunited
quintet. The new arrangement shows the
experience (and habits) they've gained
during the 25 years since they broke up —
the song being much more pop-oriented
than when Gabriel first sang it. There's
also "Congo" from the post-Collins lineup,
but the rest is the work of the trio that sold
millions of records.
Although the order of songs jumps
| back and forth through time, it makes the
i album more listenable and reveals com-

mon elements — even between 1974's
"Wardrobe" and 1991 's "No Son Of Mine."
People who buy this CD will have a pretty good
idea what they're getting into, though they may detect
more of the prog-rock influences, which were under
stated in the most radio-friendly Genesis songs. Still,
it's not even close to the whole story, so it's worth
searching out early albums like "Selling England By
The Pound" and"The Lamb Lies Down On Broad
way" or the pre-"We Can't Dance" group video docu
mentary, "History of Genesis."
And even the late albums have their non-single
highlights. But for a band that seemed to defy the as
sembly of a greatest hits collection, "Turn It On Again
— The Hits" is about as good as one could have hoped
for.
