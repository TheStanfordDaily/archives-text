# Carnival '99
## The 						String Cheese incident 
### 
Following the tradition set by the
Grateful Dead, the String Cheese
Incident is a band that defines it
self through its highly improvised live
shows and large grass-roots following.
"Carnival '99," the group's new
album, captures the group during several
concerts in early 1999. It is a work of art
that deserves to be placed among the best
live albums of all time.
As a group, the String Cheese Incident
is difficult to describe. Their unique blend
of musicianship, versatility and experi
mentation allows them to defy categoriza
tion. They sound like a mixture of the best

parts of all of your favorite bands.
The group, which features gui
tar, mandolin, bass, keyboards

and percussion, describes its
music as "a sacreligious mix of bluegsass,

calypso, salsa, Afro pop, funk, rock and
jazz." On "Carnival '99," the band effort
lessly mixes these elements and more
into an amazing musical "incident."
The album features both original
songs and reworked cover tunes includ
ing jazz standards such as "Take Five"
and "Birdland," as well as funk tunes
such as the Meters' "Hey Pocky Way."
One original song, "Jellyfish," starts out
with a distinctive organ jazz-funk and
progresses into a humorous rap reminis
cent of Digital Underground or the Fresh
Prince. Others, such as "Shenandoah
Breakdown," are a knee-slapping good
time, reminding the listener that the
String Cheese Incident is primarily root
ed in bluegrass.
Throughout the album, it becomes
clear that the group is comprised of five

immensely talented musicians. The play
ing of Michael Kang, who alternates be
tween violin and mandolin, is striking. As
he picks his way through powerful
melodies and arpeggios, he gets a thick,
warm tone that one may be surprised to
hear coming from a mandolin.
The group together is greater than the
sum of its parts. The band members pride
themselves on their interactions with
each other and with the audience. This is
clearly apparent throughout the album as
the musicians respond to and anticipate
one another with remarkable precision.
When "Carnival '99" hits stores in
early February, make sure you rush out
and get your hands on this classic in the
making.
