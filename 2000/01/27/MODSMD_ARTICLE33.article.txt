## Stanford’s own folk alumna serenades the Co Ho It's Allette Brooks! 
### Michael Baer Staff writer 
Two years ago / had dinner at the Vi
colo Pizzeria and then went to see Al
lette Brooks perform, in one night ex
periencing the best Palo Alto had to
offer. Well, Vicolo is gone, hut Al
lette's still here — four years after her
graduation from Stanford — still
playing her acoustic guitar and belting
out some of the finest and most origi
nal songs in modern folk. Many of
these songs are available on her two
independent releases, 1996 s "Privi
lege" and 1999's "Silicon Valley
Rebel." Allette plays at the Coffee
House tonight at 9 p.m. My interview
with her took place after her return
from a nationwide tour.
Intermission: Welcome back to the
Bay Area. How was the tour?
Allette Brooks: It was a wonderful
experience, exceeding all expecta
tions from several different stand
points. 1 had a wide range of audi
ences, including some incredibly
large audiences, which was enjoyable
and not necessarily expected. I was
going some places I hadn't been be-

fore and met some great people. I had a wonderful time
in plaees I wouldn't have expected, like Lawrence, Kan.,
and Urbana-Champaign, Illinois. People were just really
excited and receptive. And it was wonderful to watch the
landscape of the country unfold in both directions as 1
drove. On the way back autumn came, and I got to see
the leaves turn.
I: What about your experience in Holland?
AB: I didn't consider it part of my tour. I arrived back in
Palo Alto and left the next day for Holland; it was more
of a family thing. I had the honor of playing in a ceremo
ny, though. It was a profound experience to play
"Clothespin" — a song I wrote about the inspiration of
my grandparents — and to be able to sing it in honor of
the inspiring people who hid Jews, including my grand
parents, during World War 11. It was really special, and
my grandparents were there as well.
"What I need is to look into the mirror and see my own
face."
1: Recently you performed an Indigo Girls song in con
cert, and I've long noticed similarities between your
work and theirs. The playing style and lyrics on your
first album have also been influenced by Ani I)iFranco.
What are your other influences and inspirations, and
how do they show?
AB: I think that listening to Dar Williams, Sarah
McLachlan and Joni Mitchell opened up possibilities of
singing to me, like using my whole voice as opposed to
just the bottom half. I don't sound much like Sarah

McLachlan, but I think she's a really powerful per
former. She's singing in lots of different parts of her
range, and watehing how she does that is really intriguing
for me. I also really respect her songwriting and listen to
her music a lot. She's very poetic.
A lot of times, when I think about my intluences, it's
not so much that they tangibly show up in my music. It's
more just what I've listened to. I also really like [Mary
land folksinger) Cheryl Wheeler, though I'm not neces
sarily musically influenced by her. She's just so herself
and so hilarious when she gives a live performance. Her
style was really an inspiration for me. I actually got to
open for her a while back in Palo Alto at Cubberly [Com
munity Center], and it was a great show.
I: Are (here any more recent influences to your music, or
were you more concerned with getting your own style?
AB: 1 've definitely been concerned with getting my own
style. A lot of that has come through constant perform
ing. I think that's the way to develop your own style. I re
ally think you can be very creative in the recording stu
dio, but for me that wasn't the place to fully develop my
style. It was with other people in a performance setting.
I'm pretty clear about how I want to perform and how
I want to interact with my audience and my music. I don't
like to emphasize influences because I'm trying to find
my own voice and don't want to be lumped in with X, Y
or Z.
Another thing that has been important to me in find
ing my way is finding the humor. I mean, "Privilege" isn't
humorous at all, and I'm actually a really humorous per
son in real life. I think you can get that now from the

show. Even if my songs aren't so
funny, in between it can be funny.
I mean some songs are hu
morous, but they also have more seri
ous implications. I'm not silly humor
ous. I take life pretty seriously, but 1
also think it's important to laugh
every once in a while. Or a lot. Ap
propriately.
I: How do you see your music in its
potential to inspire others?
AB: I guess I wouldn't be where I am
right now if I didn't inspire some peo
ple, but that's sort of the magic of it
all, not something I think about and
manipulate. That's the interaction
that is performance, and there's no
way I can get into someone's head
and try to figure out who's going to be
interested, see some of themselves in
what I'm singing about or find me as
someone who raises interesting ques
tions. This is the undefinable gray
area about what I do. I think what
comes through is my honesty and
maybe that intrigues people or touch
es them.
I: Do you feel you've better defined
your musical style since your time at
Stanford?
AB: 1 started playing guitar at the end
of my junior year at Stanford, and I
recorded "Privilege" halfway

through my senior
year and into that
summer. Obviously
I had not fully de
veloped. I'm still
not fully developed.
It's a process I will
always be in, but my
comfort level is
much, much higher.
I'm sure you can
hear the difference.

"A true believer is what I am. My passion flows like a river;
I never know how it will twist through the land."
I: On your sophomore album, "Silicon Valley Rebel," it
seems you've de-emphasized the political in favor of the
personal, unless you think you've just gotten subtler.
AB: I think I 've gotten subtler actually; that's the way I
look at it. I don't think of what I'm doing as de-empha
sizing the political. I have less songs that have been very
specifically about global inequity, etc., but I think I've
learned to address things in a more subtle manner that
perhaps is more accessible to people. That's what I was
hoping for. I also believe that what is personally impor
tant becomes political.
Like "Silicon Valley Rebel" — that's a personal song
about a friend, but it's completely political from my
standpoint. It's a song about corporatism, which is one of
the largest issues sweeping the globe at this time. It's not
just an issue; it is the new world order. And that song is
about one person's relation to corporatism, which I think
is a very political thing.
I: However, the subject of the song seems comfortable
with the idea, "Why should / do for the company what
the company wouldn't do for me?"
AB: I feel like the character of Rachel brings a lot of chal
lenges into her workplace, and she does everything with
a little twist to it. I see her as an inherently political figure
in her office. And that's what I'm trying to convey.
And "Cab Song" is also a very personal song. It's the
testimony of a Ghanian cab driver living in America with
