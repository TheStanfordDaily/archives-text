## Stanford’s own folk alumna serenades the Co Ho It's Allette Brooks! 
### Michael Baer Staff writer 
Two years ago / had dinner at the Vi
colo Pizzeria and then went to see Al
lette Brooks perform, in one night ex
periencing the best Palo Alto had to
offer. Well, Vicolo is gone, hut Al
lette's still here — four years after her
graduation from Stanford — still
playing her acoustic guitar and belting
out some of the finest and most origi
nal songs in modern folk. Many of
these songs are available on her two
independent releases, 1996 s "Privi
lege" and 1999's "Silicon Valley
Rebel." Allette plays at the Coffee
House tonight at 9 p.m. My interview
with her took place after her return
from a nationwide tour.
Intermission: Welcome back to the
Bay Area. How was the tour?
Allette Brooks: It was a wonderful
experience, exceeding all expecta
tions from several different stand
points. 1 had a wide range of audi
ences, including some incredibly
large audiences, which was enjoyable
and not necessarily expected. I was
going some places I hadn't been be-

fore and met some great people. I had a wonderful time
in plaees I wouldn't have expected, like Lawrence, Kan.,
and Urbana-Champaign, Illinois. People were just really
excited and receptive. And it was wonderful to watch the
landscape of the country unfold in both directions as 1
drove. On the way back autumn came, and I got to see
the leaves turn.
I: What about your experience in Holland?
AB: I didn't consider it part of my tour. I arrived back in
Palo Alto and left the next day for Holland; it was more
of a family thing. I had the honor of playing in a ceremo
ny, though. It was a profound experience to play
"Clothespin" — a song I wrote about the inspiration of
my grandparents — and to be able to sing it in honor of
the inspiring people who hid Jews, including my grand
parents, during World War 11. It was really special, and
my grandparents were there as well.
"What I need is to look into the mirror and see my own
face."
1: Recently you performed an Indigo Girls song in con
cert, and I've long noticed similarities between your
work and theirs. The playing style and lyrics on your
first album have also been influenced by Ani I)iFranco.
What are your other influences and inspirations, and
how do they show?
AB: I think that listening to Dar Williams, Sarah
McLachlan and Joni Mitchell opened up possibilities of
singing to me, like using my whole voice as opposed to
just the bottom half. I don't sound much like Sarah

McLachlan, but I think she's a really powerful per
former. She's singing in lots of different parts of her
range, and watehing how she does that is really intriguing
for me. I also really respect her songwriting and listen to
her music a lot. She's very poetic.
A lot of times, when I think about my intluences, it's
not so much that they tangibly show up in my music. It's
more just what I've listened to. I also really like [Mary
land folksinger) Cheryl Wheeler, though I'm not neces
sarily musically influenced by her. She's just so herself
and so hilarious when she gives a live performance. Her
style was really an inspiration for me. I actually got to
open for her a while back in Palo Alto at Cubberly [Com
munity Center], and it was a great show.
I: Are (here any more recent influences to your music, or
were you more concerned with getting your own style?
AB: 1 've definitely been concerned with getting my own
style. A lot of that has come through constant perform
ing. I think that's the way to develop your own style. I re
ally think you can be very creative in the recording stu
dio, but for me that wasn't the place to fully develop my
style. It was with other people in a performance setting.
I'm pretty clear about how I want to perform and how
I want to interact with my audience and my music. I don't
like to emphasize influences because I'm trying to find
my own voice and don't want to be lumped in with X, Y
or Z.
Another thing that has been important to me in find
ing my way is finding the humor. I mean, "Privilege" isn't
humorous at all, and I'm actually a really humorous per
son in real life. I think you can get that now from the

show. Even if my songs aren't so
funny, in between it can be funny.
I mean some songs are hu
morous, but they also have more seri
ous implications. I'm not silly humor
ous. I take life pretty seriously, but 1
also think it's important to laugh
every once in a while. Or a lot. Ap
propriately.
I: How do you see your music in its
potential to inspire others?
AB: I guess I wouldn't be where I am
right now if I didn't inspire some peo
ple, but that's sort of the magic of it
all, not something I think about and
manipulate. That's the interaction
that is performance, and there's no
way I can get into someone's head
and try to figure out who's going to be
interested, see some of themselves in
what I'm singing about or find me as
someone who raises interesting ques
tions. This is the undefinable gray
area about what I do. I think what
comes through is my honesty and
maybe that intrigues people or touch
es them.
I: Do you feel you've better defined
your musical style since your time at
Stanford?
AB: 1 started playing guitar at the end
of my junior year at Stanford, and I
recorded "Privilege" halfway

through my senior
year and into that
summer. Obviously
I had not fully de
veloped. I'm still
not fully developed.
It's a process I will
always be in, but my
comfort level is
much, much higher.
I'm sure you can
hear the difference.

"A true believer is what I am. My passion flows like a river;
I never know how it will twist through the land."
I: On your sophomore album, "Silicon Valley Rebel," it
seems you've de-emphasized the political in favor of the
personal, unless you think you've just gotten subtler.
AB: I think I 've gotten subtler actually; that's the way I
look at it. I don't think of what I'm doing as de-empha
sizing the political. I have less songs that have been very
specifically about global inequity, etc., but I think I've
learned to address things in a more subtle manner that
perhaps is more accessible to people. That's what I was
hoping for. I also believe that what is personally impor
tant becomes political.
Like "Silicon Valley Rebel" — that's a personal song
about a friend, but it's completely political from my
standpoint. It's a song about corporatism, which is one of
the largest issues sweeping the globe at this time. It's not
just an issue; it is the new world order. And that song is
about one person's relation to corporatism, which I think
is a very political thing.
I: However, the subject of the song seems comfortable
with the idea, "Why should / do for the company what
the company wouldn't do for me?"
AB: I feel like the character of Rachel brings a lot of chal
lenges into her workplace, and she does everything with
a little twist to it. I see her as an inherently political figure
in her office. And that's what I'm trying to convey.
And "Cab Song" is also a very personal song. It's the
testimony of a Ghanian cab driver living in America with

my chorus interjected, yet I think that's a hugely politi
cal song. I see most everything as a gray area between
"personal" and "political," depending on how you pre
sent it. As opposed to expressing things in an overt, non
subtle, "political" way, I am choosing to operate in the
gray.
However, I don't think "Cab Song" is that subtle. It's
observational, but I think you can tell my thoughts on
the matter. I don't think there's a mystery there. I guess
I feel that about most of my music — you can tell where
I'm coming from without me saying, "I think X, Y and Z
about American privilege, about male privilege." I can
express that more subtly. That's what I've been trying to
do.
I: Have your political views changed since "Privilege"?
AB: No, not at all. My position in the world has changed
a hit. I now have a minivan instead of no car at all, as a
necessity of the life of a touring performer. But I feel
"Privilege" still resonates. I just may say it all a little bit
differently now.
I: From the political to the personal — "Passage Of
Time," "10 Years" and "Look You In The Eye" all
deal with your attempts to reconcile your relationship
with an old flame. These songs are quite touching and
a hit personal. How do you feel about transforming
those life experiences into songs that anyone can hear?
The more the better?
AB: Great! It's funny, people come up to me after shows
and say, "Wow, it must be so hard to be so honest. Your
songs are so personal. You reveal so much." Well, the
people who have been most effective in my life and the
performers I've found most powerful have been really
honest.
In a song, I'm just sort of having a little conversation
with you, and in conversation I tend to be pretty honest
and straightforward. I've learned that if I write a song
and it's about a relationship, most of my friends are un
derstanding. I can play the song for them and we can talk
about it, and it'll be okay.
I: Would you like to share the experiences behind other
songs, such as "Privilege" and "Let Me In"?
AB: I went abroad my junior year to Botswana, and
then I spent some time in Ecuador and Vietnam. Basi
cally, "Privilege" and the concepts in the song came out
of those experiences and meeting lots of people. Those
travels really informed my perception of the world and
my being a Stanford-educated, white, American
woman. All sorts of different issues were raised for me,
and a lot of that came out in the songs I wrote.
I think "Let Me In" is a complicated song. I wrote it
at a time when I didn't have a stable place to live and was
looking for one. I think that very often we find a place
for ourselves, in a physical house, in a specific relation
ship, and it was about me going through a lot of transi
tions and feeling like, "My body is my only home." No
relationship can be my home. No house can be my
home. The only things that are not going anywhere is my
body and "these yellow hills," this earth.
A lot of my songs have this imagery of landscape and
then humanity and finally the integration: my relation
ship with certain landscapes and the earth. And that ap
pears in "Let Me In." It's not really a story; it's a feeling.
1: How did you get into folk music, having been a clas
sically trained singer?
AB: Well, I've always written poetry, and I'm drawn to
the way in which I feel like a sustainable unit, me and my
guitar. We can travel around the country, play and make
a living. A band is different. And I am interested in col
laboration and working with other people, but I think I
was drawn to this medium because it's a possible medi
um. »
And it's a quickly accessible medium, if you think
about the fact that I had been playing my guitar for only
a year when I recorded my first songs on my first
album — not that they were necessarily stellarly played.

I just wove my way and jumped on. It just happened to
really work well for me, and I decided to really delve
into it. My life is my music. The biggest thing in my life is
this path that I've chosen, and I'm putting a lot of ener
gy into it.
I've been singing songs since the ripe old age of 1, and
I'm definitely a much stronger singer than I am a gui
tarist. I think I've gotten pretty good at the guitar, but
singing, yes, I've been doing it since I was little, and I've
always been a very verbal person and had a lot of words
that wanted to come out of my mouth. That's a natural
thing for me.
"Are we children of the concrete or children of the desert
sand?"
I: Why did you choose to attend Stanford?
AB: I visited Stanford, Berkeley and lots of other
schools, and I didn't like Stanford at all; it seemed like a
really lame, boring place. I was really excited about
Berkeley. I also got really excited about Oberlin and de
cided to go there. But at the last minute I freaked out
about going to Ohio and leaving the beautiful, wild West
and decided to go to Stanford. There were a lot of fac
tors involved.
I didn't really like Stanford my first year. Then I
joined the Redwood (Outdoors Club] and trained to be
a freshman first-year trip backpacking leader. And then
moving into Synergy clinched it. I then felt, "Okay, I can
handle this." I found my niche. I was kitchen manager at
Synergy and cooked a lot of vegan food. I was very, very
Synergy.
I was also involved with the women's performance
collective. That was sort of a revolutionary experience
for me, in that it showed me how pertinent, relevant and
powerful a group creation can be. A lot of the perfor
mance I had done up until that point — most of the
plays, musicals and songs — were written by other peo
ple. I had done some creative performance, but these
pieces were about body image, relationships, vio
lence— real pertinent, heavy topics. I think that the

power of those experiences helped push me down the
path toward becoming a singer / songwriter.
I was involved in starting "Young at Heart," a group
on-campus that goes to convalescent homes and sings.
And I was involved with a Yoga class for my last two
years; I actually did some substitute instructing.
And academics as well. My degree was in human bi
ology. It wasn't quite as big then as it is now, but it's a
great major. I started out as earth systems, but then I
switched because I wanted to be able to integrate envi
ronmental studies with human studies. In Botswana, I
realized how it's all connected. Human Biology allowed
me to take a more integrated approach.
"No way will I design a Web page for the Promise Keep
ers. You can just take your Web page and shove it up your
you-know-what."
I: You titled your year-old release "Silicon Valley
Rebel" and have been using the Internet to help pro
mote it, on www.allettebwoks.com,mp3.com and folk
web. com. How do you view technology with respect to
your music in terms of subject matter, recording, pro
motion and distribution?
AB: So far, I've found it a really fun tool. And I get a lot
of inquiries, mailing list requests and CD requests on the
Internet. I'm having fun with it. I definitely have issues
with the Internet since it's not equally accessible to all
people. There are definitely percentages of our popula
tion that are getting better access to the Internet than
others. But so far for me it's been a successful, enjoyable
medium.
As far as recording technology, I love audio engi
neering and mixing, and I'd love to learn more, so I'm
sure it will affect my music. I'm not interested in elec
tronic music per se but rather in exploring what I can do
with my acoustic music using technology. Right now,
though. I'd rather branch out into working with other in
strumentations rather than manipulating it with tech
nology.

colo Pizzeria and then went to see Al
lette Brooks perform, in one night ex
periencing the best Palo Alto had to
offer. Well, Vicolo is gone, hut Al
lette's still here — four years after her
graduation from Stanford — still
playing her acoustic guitar and belting
out some of the finest and most origi
nal songs in modern folk. Many of
these songs are available on her two
independent releases, 1996 s "Privi
lege" and 1999's "Silicon Valley
Rebel." Allette plays at the Coffee
House tonight at 9 p.m. My interview
with her took place after her return
from a nationwide tour.
Intermission: Welcome back to the
Bay Area. How was the tour?
Allette Brooks: It was a wonderful
experience, exceeding all expecta
tions from several different stand
points. 1 had a wide range of audi
ences, including some incredibly
large audiences, which was enjoyable
and not necessarily expected. I was
going some places I hadn't been be-

fore and met some great people. I had a wonderful time
in plaees I wouldn't have expected, like Lawrence, Kan.,
and Urbana-Champaign, Illinois. People were just really
excited and receptive. And it was wonderful to watch the
landscape of the country unfold in both directions as 1
drove. On the way back autumn came, and I got to see
the leaves turn.
I: What about your experience in Holland?
AB: I didn't consider it part of my tour. I arrived back in
Palo Alto and left the next day for Holland; it was more
of a family thing. I had the honor of playing in a ceremo
ny, though. It was a profound experience to play
"Clothespin" — a song I wrote about the inspiration of
my grandparents — and to be able to sing it in honor of
the inspiring people who hid Jews, including my grand
parents, during World War 11. It was really special, and
my grandparents were there as well.
"What I need is to look into the mirror and see my own
face."
1: Recently you performed an Indigo Girls song in con
cert, and I've long noticed similarities between your
work and theirs. The playing style and lyrics on your
first album have also been influenced by Ani I)iFranco.
What are your other influences and inspirations, and
how do they show?
AB: I think that listening to Dar Williams, Sarah
McLachlan and Joni Mitchell opened up possibilities of
singing to me, like using my whole voice as opposed to
just the bottom half. I don't sound much like Sarah

McLachlan, but I think she's a really powerful per
former. She's singing in lots of different parts of her
range, and watehing how she does that is really intriguing
for me. I also really respect her songwriting and listen to
her music a lot. She's very poetic.
A lot of times, when I think about my intluences, it's
not so much that they tangibly show up in my music. It's
more just what I've listened to. I also really like [Mary
land folksinger) Cheryl Wheeler, though I'm not neces
sarily musically influenced by her. She's just so herself
and so hilarious when she gives a live performance. Her
style was really an inspiration for me. I actually got to
open for her a while back in Palo Alto at Cubberly [Com
munity Center], and it was a great show.
I: Are (here any more recent influences to your music, or
were you more concerned with getting your own style?
AB: 1 've definitely been concerned with getting my own
style. A lot of that has come through constant perform
ing. I think that's the way to develop your own style. I re
ally think you can be very creative in the recording stu
dio, but for me that wasn't the place to fully develop my
style. It was with other people in a performance setting.
I'm pretty clear about how I want to perform and how
I want to interact with my audience and my music. I don't
like to emphasize influences because I'm trying to find
my own voice and don't want to be lumped in with X, Y
or Z.
Another thing that has been important to me in find
ing my way is finding the humor. I mean, "Privilege" isn't
humorous at all, and I'm actually a really humorous per
son in real life. I think you can get that now from the

show. Even if my songs aren't so
funny, in between it can be funny.
I mean some songs are hu
morous, but they also have more seri
ous implications. I'm not silly humor
ous. I take life pretty seriously, but 1
also think it's important to laugh
every once in a while. Or a lot. Ap
propriately.
I: How do you see your music in its
potential to inspire others?
AB: I guess I wouldn't be where I am
right now if I didn't inspire some peo
ple, but that's sort of the magic of it
all, not something I think about and
manipulate. That's the interaction
that is performance, and there's no
way I can get into someone's head
and try to figure out who's going to be
interested, see some of themselves in
what I'm singing about or find me as
someone who raises interesting ques
tions. This is the undefinable gray
area about what I do. I think what
comes through is my honesty and
maybe that intrigues people or touch
es them.
I: Do you feel you've better defined
your musical style since your time at
Stanford?
AB: 1 started playing guitar at the end
of my junior year at Stanford, and I
recorded "Privilege" halfway

through my senior
year and into that
summer. Obviously
I had not fully de
veloped. I'm still
not fully developed.
It's a process I will
always be in, but my
comfort level is
much, much higher.
I'm sure you can
hear the difference.

"A true believer is what I am. My passion flows like a river;
I never know how it will twist through the land."
I: On your sophomore album, "Silicon Valley Rebel," it
seems you've de-emphasized the political in favor of the
personal, unless you think you've just gotten subtler.
AB: I think I 've gotten subtler actually; that's the way I
look at it. I don't think of what I'm doing as de-empha
sizing the political. I have less songs that have been very
specifically about global inequity, etc., but I think I've
learned to address things in a more subtle manner that
perhaps is more accessible to people. That's what I was
hoping for. I also believe that what is personally impor
tant becomes political.
Like "Silicon Valley Rebel" — that's a personal song
about a friend, but it's completely political from my
standpoint. It's a song about corporatism, which is one of
the largest issues sweeping the globe at this time. It's not
just an issue; it is the new world order. And that song is
about one person's relation to corporatism, which I think
is a very political thing.
I: However, the subject of the song seems comfortable
with the idea, "Why should / do for the company what
the company wouldn't do for me?"
AB: I feel like the character of Rachel brings a lot of chal
lenges into her workplace, and she does everything with
a little twist to it. I see her as an inherently political figure
in her office. And that's what I'm trying to convey.
And "Cab Song" is also a very personal song. It's the
testimony of a Ghanian cab driver living in America with

my chorus interjected, yet I think that's a hugely politi
cal song. I see most everything as a gray area between
"personal" and "political," depending on how you pre
sent it. As opposed to expressing things in an overt, non
subtle, "political" way, I am choosing to operate in the
gray.
However, I don't think "Cab Song" is that subtle. It's
observational, but I think you can tell my thoughts on
the matter. I don't think there's a mystery there. I guess
I feel that about most of my music — you can tell where
I'm coming from without me saying, "I think X, Y and Z
about American privilege, about male privilege." I can
express that more subtly. That's what I've been trying to
do.
I: Have your political views changed since "Privilege"?
AB: No, not at all. My position in the world has changed
a hit. I now have a minivan instead of no car at all, as a
necessity of the life of a touring performer. But I feel
"Privilege" still resonates. I just may say it all a little bit
differently now.
I: From the political to the personal — "Passage Of
Time," "10 Years" and "Look You In The Eye" all
deal with your attempts to reconcile your relationship
with an old flame. These songs are quite touching and
a hit personal. How do you feel about transforming
those life experiences into songs that anyone can hear?
The more the better?
AB: Great! It's funny, people come up to me after shows
and say, "Wow, it must be so hard to be so honest. Your
songs are so personal. You reveal so much." Well, the
people who have been most effective in my life and the
performers I've found most powerful have been really
honest.
In a song, I'm just sort of having a little conversation
with you, and in conversation I tend to be pretty honest
and straightforward. I've learned that if I write a song
and it's about a relationship, most of my friends are un
derstanding. I can play the song for them and we can talk
about it, and it'll be okay.
I: Would you like to share the experiences behind other
songs, such as "Privilege" and "Let Me In"?
AB: I went abroad my junior year to Botswana, and
then I spent some time in Ecuador and Vietnam. Basi
cally, "Privilege" and the concepts in the song came out
of those experiences and meeting lots of people. Those
travels really informed my perception of the world and
my being a Stanford-educated, white, American
woman. All sorts of different issues were raised for me,
and a lot of that came out in the songs I wrote.
I think "Let Me In" is a complicated song. I wrote it
at a time when I didn't have a stable place to live and was
looking for one. I think that very often we find a place
for ourselves, in a physical house, in a specific relation
ship, and it was about me going through a lot of transi
tions and feeling like, "My body is my only home." No
relationship can be my home. No house can be my
home. The only things that are not going anywhere is my
body and "these yellow hills," this earth.
A lot of my songs have this imagery of landscape and
then humanity and finally the integration: my relation
ship with certain landscapes and the earth. And that ap
pears in "Let Me In." It's not really a story; it's a feeling.
1: How did you get into folk music, having been a clas
sically trained singer?
AB: Well, I've always written poetry, and I'm drawn to
the way in which I feel like a sustainable unit, me and my
guitar. We can travel around the country, play and make
a living. A band is different. And I am interested in col
laboration and working with other people, but I think I
was drawn to this medium because it's a possible medi
um. »
And it's a quickly accessible medium, if you think
about the fact that I had been playing my guitar for only
a year when I recorded my first songs on my first
album — not that they were necessarily stellarly played.

I just wove my way and jumped on. It just happened to
really work well for me, and I decided to really delve
into it. My life is my music. The biggest thing in my life is
this path that I've chosen, and I'm putting a lot of ener
gy into it.
I've been singing songs since the ripe old age of 1, and
I'm definitely a much stronger singer than I am a gui
tarist. I think I've gotten pretty good at the guitar, but
singing, yes, I've been doing it since I was little, and I've
always been a very verbal person and had a lot of words
that wanted to come out of my mouth. That's a natural
thing for me.
"Are we children of the concrete or children of the desert
sand?"
I: Why did you choose to attend Stanford?
AB: I visited Stanford, Berkeley and lots of other
schools, and I didn't like Stanford at all; it seemed like a
really lame, boring place. I was really excited about
Berkeley. I also got really excited about Oberlin and de
cided to go there. But at the last minute I freaked out
about going to Ohio and leaving the beautiful, wild West
and decided to go to Stanford. There were a lot of fac
tors involved.
I didn't really like Stanford my first year. Then I
joined the Redwood (Outdoors Club] and trained to be
a freshman first-year trip backpacking leader. And then
moving into Synergy clinched it. I then felt, "Okay, I can
handle this." I found my niche. I was kitchen manager at
Synergy and cooked a lot of vegan food. I was very, very
Synergy.
I was also involved with the women's performance
collective. That was sort of a revolutionary experience
for me, in that it showed me how pertinent, relevant and
powerful a group creation can be. A lot of the perfor
mance I had done up until that point — most of the
plays, musicals and songs — were written by other peo
ple. I had done some creative performance, but these
pieces were about body image, relationships, vio
lence— real pertinent, heavy topics. I think that the

power of those experiences helped push me down the
path toward becoming a singer / songwriter.
I was involved in starting "Young at Heart," a group
on-campus that goes to convalescent homes and sings.
And I was involved with a Yoga class for my last two
years; I actually did some substitute instructing.
And academics as well. My degree was in human bi
ology. It wasn't quite as big then as it is now, but it's a
great major. I started out as earth systems, but then I
switched because I wanted to be able to integrate envi
ronmental studies with human studies. In Botswana, I
realized how it's all connected. Human Biology allowed
me to take a more integrated approach.
"No way will I design a Web page for the Promise Keep
ers. You can just take your Web page and shove it up your
you-know-what."
I: You titled your year-old release "Silicon Valley
Rebel" and have been using the Internet to help pro
mote it, on www.allettebwoks.com,mp3.com and folk
web. com. How do you view technology with respect to
your music in terms of subject matter, recording, pro
motion and distribution?
AB: So far, I've found it a really fun tool. And I get a lot
of inquiries, mailing list requests and CD requests on the
Internet. I'm having fun with it. I definitely have issues
with the Internet since it's not equally accessible to all
people. There are definitely percentages of our popula
tion that are getting better access to the Internet than
others. But so far for me it's been a successful, enjoyable
medium.
As far as recording technology, I love audio engi
neering and mixing, and I'd love to learn more, so I'm
sure it will affect my music. I'm not interested in elec
tronic music per se but rather in exploring what I can do
with my acoustic music using technology. Right now,
though. I'd rather branch out into working with other in
strumentations rather than manipulating it with tech
nology.

offer. Well, Vicolo is gone, hut Al
lette's still here — four years after her
graduation from Stanford — still
playing her acoustic guitar and belting
out some of the finest and most origi
nal songs in modern folk. Many of
these songs are available on her two
independent releases, 1996 s "Privi
lege" and 1999's "Silicon Valley
Rebel." Allette plays at the Coffee
House tonight at 9 p.m. My interview
with her took place after her return
from a nationwide tour.
Intermission: Welcome back to the
Bay Area. How was the tour?
Allette Brooks: It was a wonderful
experience, exceeding all expecta
tions from several different stand
points. 1 had a wide range of audi
ences, including some incredibly
large audiences, which was enjoyable
and not necessarily expected. I was
going some places I hadn't been be-

fore and met some great people. I had a wonderful time
in plaees I wouldn't have expected, like Lawrence, Kan.,
and Urbana-Champaign, Illinois. People were just really
excited and receptive. And it was wonderful to watch the
landscape of the country unfold in both directions as 1
drove. On the way back autumn came, and I got to see
the leaves turn.
I: What about your experience in Holland?
AB: I didn't consider it part of my tour. I arrived back in
Palo Alto and left the next day for Holland; it was more
of a family thing. I had the honor of playing in a ceremo
ny, though. It was a profound experience to play
"Clothespin" — a song I wrote about the inspiration of
my grandparents — and to be able to sing it in honor of
the inspiring people who hid Jews, including my grand
parents, during World War 11. It was really special, and
my grandparents were there as well.
"What I need is to look into the mirror and see my own
face."
1: Recently you performed an Indigo Girls song in con
cert, and I've long noticed similarities between your
work and theirs. The playing style and lyrics on your
first album have also been influenced by Ani I)iFranco.
What are your other influences and inspirations, and
how do they show?
AB: I think that listening to Dar Williams, Sarah
McLachlan and Joni Mitchell opened up possibilities of
singing to me, like using my whole voice as opposed to
just the bottom half. I don't sound much like Sarah

McLachlan, but I think she's a really powerful per
former. She's singing in lots of different parts of her
range, and watehing how she does that is really intriguing
for me. I also really respect her songwriting and listen to
her music a lot. She's very poetic.
A lot of times, when I think about my intluences, it's
not so much that they tangibly show up in my music. It's
more just what I've listened to. I also really like [Mary
land folksinger) Cheryl Wheeler, though I'm not neces
sarily musically influenced by her. She's just so herself
and so hilarious when she gives a live performance. Her
style was really an inspiration for me. I actually got to
open for her a while back in Palo Alto at Cubberly [Com
munity Center], and it was a great show.
I: Are (here any more recent influences to your music, or
were you more concerned with getting your own style?
AB: 1 've definitely been concerned with getting my own
style. A lot of that has come through constant perform
ing. I think that's the way to develop your own style. I re
ally think you can be very creative in the recording stu
dio, but for me that wasn't the place to fully develop my
style. It was with other people in a performance setting.
I'm pretty clear about how I want to perform and how
I want to interact with my audience and my music. I don't
like to emphasize influences because I'm trying to find
my own voice and don't want to be lumped in with X, Y
or Z.
Another thing that has been important to me in find
ing my way is finding the humor. I mean, "Privilege" isn't
humorous at all, and I'm actually a really humorous per
son in real life. I think you can get that now from the

show. Even if my songs aren't so
funny, in between it can be funny.
I mean some songs are hu
morous, but they also have more seri
ous implications. I'm not silly humor
ous. I take life pretty seriously, but 1
also think it's important to laugh
every once in a while. Or a lot. Ap
propriately.
I: How do you see your music in its
potential to inspire others?
AB: I guess I wouldn't be where I am
right now if I didn't inspire some peo
ple, but that's sort of the magic of it
all, not something I think about and
manipulate. That's the interaction
that is performance, and there's no
way I can get into someone's head
and try to figure out who's going to be
interested, see some of themselves in
what I'm singing about or find me as
someone who raises interesting ques
tions. This is the undefinable gray
area about what I do. I think what
comes through is my honesty and
maybe that intrigues people or touch
es them.
I: Do you feel you've better defined
your musical style since your time at
Stanford?
AB: 1 started playing guitar at the end
of my junior year at Stanford, and I
recorded "Privilege" halfway

through my senior
year and into that
summer. Obviously
I had not fully de
veloped. I'm still
not fully developed.
It's a process I will
always be in, but my
comfort level is
much, much higher.
I'm sure you can
hear the difference.

"A true believer is what I am. My passion flows like a river;
I never know how it will twist through the land."
I: On your sophomore album, "Silicon Valley Rebel," it
seems you've de-emphasized the political in favor of the
personal, unless you think you've just gotten subtler.
AB: I think I 've gotten subtler actually; that's the way I
look at it. I don't think of what I'm doing as de-empha
sizing the political. I have less songs that have been very
specifically about global inequity, etc., but I think I've
learned to address things in a more subtle manner that
perhaps is more accessible to people. That's what I was
hoping for. I also believe that what is personally impor
tant becomes political.
Like "Silicon Valley Rebel" — that's a personal song
about a friend, but it's completely political from my
standpoint. It's a song about corporatism, which is one of
the largest issues sweeping the globe at this time. It's not
just an issue; it is the new world order. And that song is
about one person's relation to corporatism, which I think
is a very political thing.
I: However, the subject of the song seems comfortable
with the idea, "Why should / do for the company what
the company wouldn't do for me?"
AB: I feel like the character of Rachel brings a lot of chal
lenges into her workplace, and she does everything with
a little twist to it. I see her as an inherently political figure
in her office. And that's what I'm trying to convey.
And "Cab Song" is also a very personal song. It's the
testimony of a Ghanian cab driver living in America with

my chorus interjected, yet I think that's a hugely politi
cal song. I see most everything as a gray area between
"personal" and "political," depending on how you pre
sent it. As opposed to expressing things in an overt, non
subtle, "political" way, I am choosing to operate in the
gray.
However, I don't think "Cab Song" is that subtle. It's
observational, but I think you can tell my thoughts on
the matter. I don't think there's a mystery there. I guess
I feel that about most of my music — you can tell where
I'm coming from without me saying, "I think X, Y and Z
about American privilege, about male privilege." I can
express that more subtly. That's what I've been trying to
do.
I: Have your political views changed since "Privilege"?
AB: No, not at all. My position in the world has changed
a hit. I now have a minivan instead of no car at all, as a
necessity of the life of a touring performer. But I feel
"Privilege" still resonates. I just may say it all a little bit
differently now.
I: From the political to the personal — "Passage Of
Time," "10 Years" and "Look You In The Eye" all
deal with your attempts to reconcile your relationship
with an old flame. These songs are quite touching and
a hit personal. How do you feel about transforming
those life experiences into songs that anyone can hear?
The more the better?
AB: Great! It's funny, people come up to me after shows
and say, "Wow, it must be so hard to be so honest. Your
songs are so personal. You reveal so much." Well, the
people who have been most effective in my life and the
performers I've found most powerful have been really
honest.
In a song, I'm just sort of having a little conversation
with you, and in conversation I tend to be pretty honest
and straightforward. I've learned that if I write a song
and it's about a relationship, most of my friends are un
derstanding. I can play the song for them and we can talk
about it, and it'll be okay.
I: Would you like to share the experiences behind other
songs, such as "Privilege" and "Let Me In"?
AB: I went abroad my junior year to Botswana, and
then I spent some time in Ecuador and Vietnam. Basi
cally, "Privilege" and the concepts in the song came out
of those experiences and meeting lots of people. Those
travels really informed my perception of the world and
my being a Stanford-educated, white, American
woman. All sorts of different issues were raised for me,
and a lot of that came out in the songs I wrote.
I think "Let Me In" is a complicated song. I wrote it
at a time when I didn't have a stable place to live and was
looking for one. I think that very often we find a place
for ourselves, in a physical house, in a specific relation
ship, and it was about me going through a lot of transi
tions and feeling like, "My body is my only home." No
relationship can be my home. No house can be my
home. The only things that are not going anywhere is my
body and "these yellow hills," this earth.
A lot of my songs have this imagery of landscape and
then humanity and finally the integration: my relation
ship with certain landscapes and the earth. And that ap
pears in "Let Me In." It's not really a story; it's a feeling.
1: How did you get into folk music, having been a clas
sically trained singer?
AB: Well, I've always written poetry, and I'm drawn to
the way in which I feel like a sustainable unit, me and my
guitar. We can travel around the country, play and make
a living. A band is different. And I am interested in col
laboration and working with other people, but I think I
was drawn to this medium because it's a possible medi
um. »
And it's a quickly accessible medium, if you think
about the fact that I had been playing my guitar for only
a year when I recorded my first songs on my first
album — not that they were necessarily stellarly played.

I just wove my way and jumped on. It just happened to
really work well for me, and I decided to really delve
into it. My life is my music. The biggest thing in my life is
this path that I've chosen, and I'm putting a lot of ener
gy into it.
I've been singing songs since the ripe old age of 1, and
I'm definitely a much stronger singer than I am a gui
tarist. I think I've gotten pretty good at the guitar, but
singing, yes, I've been doing it since I was little, and I've
always been a very verbal person and had a lot of words
that wanted to come out of my mouth. That's a natural
thing for me.
"Are we children of the concrete or children of the desert
sand?"
I: Why did you choose to attend Stanford?
AB: I visited Stanford, Berkeley and lots of other
schools, and I didn't like Stanford at all; it seemed like a
really lame, boring place. I was really excited about
Berkeley. I also got really excited about Oberlin and de
cided to go there. But at the last minute I freaked out
about going to Ohio and leaving the beautiful, wild West
and decided to go to Stanford. There were a lot of fac
tors involved.
I didn't really like Stanford my first year. Then I
joined the Redwood (Outdoors Club] and trained to be
a freshman first-year trip backpacking leader. And then
moving into Synergy clinched it. I then felt, "Okay, I can
handle this." I found my niche. I was kitchen manager at
Synergy and cooked a lot of vegan food. I was very, very
Synergy.
I was also involved with the women's performance
collective. That was sort of a revolutionary experience
for me, in that it showed me how pertinent, relevant and
powerful a group creation can be. A lot of the perfor
mance I had done up until that point — most of the
plays, musicals and songs — were written by other peo
ple. I had done some creative performance, but these
pieces were about body image, relationships, vio
lence— real pertinent, heavy topics. I think that the

power of those experiences helped push me down the
path toward becoming a singer / songwriter.
I was involved in starting "Young at Heart," a group
on-campus that goes to convalescent homes and sings.
And I was involved with a Yoga class for my last two
years; I actually did some substitute instructing.
And academics as well. My degree was in human bi
ology. It wasn't quite as big then as it is now, but it's a
great major. I started out as earth systems, but then I
switched because I wanted to be able to integrate envi
ronmental studies with human studies. In Botswana, I
realized how it's all connected. Human Biology allowed
me to take a more integrated approach.
"No way will I design a Web page for the Promise Keep
ers. You can just take your Web page and shove it up your
you-know-what."
I: You titled your year-old release "Silicon Valley
Rebel" and have been using the Internet to help pro
mote it, on www.allettebwoks.com,mp3.com and folk
web. com. How do you view technology with respect to
your music in terms of subject matter, recording, pro
motion and distribution?
AB: So far, I've found it a really fun tool. And I get a lot
of inquiries, mailing list requests and CD requests on the
Internet. I'm having fun with it. I definitely have issues
with the Internet since it's not equally accessible to all
people. There are definitely percentages of our popula
tion that are getting better access to the Internet than
others. But so far for me it's been a successful, enjoyable
medium.
As far as recording technology, I love audio engi
neering and mixing, and I'd love to learn more, so I'm
sure it will affect my music. I'm not interested in elec
tronic music per se but rather in exploring what I can do
with my acoustic music using technology. Right now,
though. I'd rather branch out into working with other in
strumentations rather than manipulating it with tech
nology.
