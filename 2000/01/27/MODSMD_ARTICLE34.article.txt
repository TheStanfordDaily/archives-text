i was playing the guitar, and he took me in to do my first
recording, which was of the song "Bye Now," a later ver
sion of which appears on "Silicon Valley Rebel." It was
really fun, so I decided to take the class the next year. 1
was a little intimidated — there was a lot of circuit
speak — but it turned out incredibly well. It was an

amazing hands-on experience, and
it was one of the most important
things I ever did, launching me
upon my path. And working with
Jay was an influential experience
too. He's a great teacher and a
great person.
I: Your Web page has the follow
ing summary on it: "Allette
Brooks, artist-poet-guitarist, re
cently independently released her
second solo album, 'Silicon Val
ley Rebel.' Her in-your-face per
sonal yet political songs take you
on a critically feminist journey
through the mind of a driven
young woman." Reflecting, is
there anything you'd like to add?
AB: I didn't know it said that! But
I think it's great. I'm not afraid of
the word "feminist." I'd like to just
say that now, and I don't care who
it upsets or insults. I like that word
a lot. I like the word "critical." I
like "in-your-face personal yet po
litical." I think that's a great de
scription. I'd like it to say that I

have intricate and poetic lyrics and
that I have an interesting guitar style. It's not a very mu
sical description, so I'd probably want to introduce some
thing about that and also about my humor.
I: Talking to you, there are a few other identities that

might apply, such as being Jewish.
AB: I think my Jewish identity is a strong part of me hut
hasn't come out too strongly in my music. But I think it's
starting to, in songs like "Clothespin" and my new song
"Same Room." And my background is part of my name
since "Allette" is my two grandmothers' names put to
gether, "Allegra" and "Henriette." So perhaps we'll add
that to the list.
I: You've really mastered the performance environment,
taking surprises and turning them into humor. You're
playing the Coffee House tonight. I think seeing you live
is inspiring, energizing and humorous. Any other reason
people should see you live?
AB: I'm living evidence that Stanford grads can pursue
non-corporate paths, ones other than those convention
ally presented to people at Stanford. You can be a per
formance artist.
"When I see you in 10 years, will you still be my dreams
and fall with my tears? "
I: So where do you see yourself in the future?
AB: I would like to create a sustainable career. I'm pret
ty close to that right now. I'd like to have more interest
ing and stimulating collaborations with other people. I'd
like to start recording a new CD within the next year. I'd
like to continue touring and see how that suits me and
how that suits everybody else.
I'm not sure what exact path I see myself taking. I'd
like to see myself become an established folk artist in the
national circuit, I hope. That's my goal, and I want to
keep it meaningful for me and for everyone else. I'm
putting a lot of energy into going that way.
