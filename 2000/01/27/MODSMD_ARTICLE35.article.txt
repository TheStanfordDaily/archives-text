## GALACTIC GIVES UP THE FUNK FOR THE BAY AREA 
### 
There was something particularly funky about the
Bay Area last weekend when hard-hitting New
Orleans band Galactic came to town. Testifying to
the popularity of the group, swarms of people gathered
outside in search of extra tickets to the sold-out show.
There are two main factors that draw in the masses
and distinguish Galactic from its funk-jazz peers. The
first is the man behind the grooves — Stanton Moore is
one of the most powerful drummers of his generation.
His heavy funk beats are at once complex and accessible,
propelling the music forward and giving the audience
something to which it can dance.
When Moore hits his stride, it almost doesn't matter
what the other musicians are doing. Still, his ability to re
spond to soloists allows the songs to spontaneously
change and develop. Leader and showman of the group,
Moore thrills the audience time and time again as, excit
ed by the music, he rises to his feet mid-song, continuing
the drumbeat while standing.
The second factor is the complex multidimensional
layering of parts. There's just something infectious about
Galactic's layered grooves. On top of Moore's drum
ming, each instrument makes a unique contribution to
the head-bobbing rhythms.
This approach is risky; on a bad night, it can sound
like the band members are each in their own world. On
these nights, Moore's drumming is all that keeps the
group together. But when the group is on, the payoff is
well worth it. The different parts weave in and out of
one another, melding into an amazing funk experience.
Periodically throughout a concert, Theryl deClouet
adds his seasoned vocals to the mix. Ranging from
smooth soul to raw gritty funk, DeClouet's vocals help to
focus the group and give a sense of direction to the show.

His presence onstage gives the group a much-needed
frontman as he sings, dances and talks his way into the
hearts of the audience.
The members of Galactic pride themselves on digging
deep into the roots of New Orleans funk and then adding
their own personal flair to it. This vocal, saxophone, key
board, guitar, bass and drum outfit has certainly earned a
reputation over the last several years. After nearly two
years of nonstop touring in support of their debut album,

"Coolin' Off," the group was signed to Capricorn
Records. Their second album, "Crazyhorse Mongoose,"
was released in 1998.
This is one group to keep an eye on in the future. Look
for its next album to be released in early April. And re
member: the next time Galactic comes to town, don't be
left standing outside — get your tickets early.
