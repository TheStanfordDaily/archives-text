"Play It"
does. Not
that we
were ex
pect i n g
much depth
anyway, and
we certainly

don't need a "White Men Can't Box."
What we do get is the story of two
friends, Cesar Dominguez (Antonio Ban
deras) and Vince Boudreau (Woody Har
relson), veteran boxers training in Los
Angeles. The film itself begins in Las
Vegas with the usual views of glitz and
garishness. Here, due to a typical Holly
wood tragedy / coincidence, boxing pro
moters are desperate for an opening act
for that night's Tyson fight. They tap
Cesar and Vince.
These friends have never fought one
another. But in addition to the sizeable
purses, the winner will get one last chance
at reviving his sagging career and fighting
for the title. And it's been years since ei
ther boxer has been given any opportuni
ty, let alone one this big.
So before long they're headed to
Vegas. To the chagrin of the promoters
(and for the benefit of the plot), the newly
rivaled friends decide to drive there to
gether.
Grace (Lolita Davidovich, "Gods and
Monsters"), Cesar's girlfriend and

Vince's ex, provides the car and much of
the discussion and conflict. She is essen
tially a risk, since they might not arrive on
time.
Each of the three knows enough about
the pasts of the others to provide for some .
notable conversations and revelations,
not to mention some below-the-belt
comic exchanges. Grace's driven and con
fident entrepreneurial spirit, Vince's
born-again yet anti-Church Christianity
and Cesar's past love life all enter into the
mix.
The lady's questionable allegiance to
Cesar and the guys' recollections of their
respective falls from grace in the ring fur
ther heat things up along the highway.
During the long trip, they pick up Lia
(Lucy Liu, "Ally Mcßeal"), a free-spirit-

Ed hitchhiker after the finer things in
life — sex, drugs and money. These as
pects provide the proper friction (and lu
bricant) to keep things interesting.
After they get to Vegas, the three prep
for the fight through various means, try
ing to make sure they're getting what they
want from the slippery promoters, played
with sufficient sleaze by Tom Sizemore
and Robert Wagner.
The eventual fight scene, though quite
impressive, is long and bloody. The pace
is kept up by the thrill of the battle, the
men's punch-drunk hallucinations about
God and sex and countless cameos by
everyone from Rod Stewart to Iron Mike
himself. In the end we get neither a sur
prise nor a payoff, but rather an appropri
ate finale that does not disappoint.

The film is supposed to highlight the
fiery desires of the fighters and the love
shared between each pair of lovers and
friends. But this is not explored with much
thoroughness; it's more buddies-on-the
road than introspection. Filmgoers will
probably get what they expect: fun watch
ing the interplay between Harrelson and
Banderas and more fun watching Davi
dovich and Liu acting smart, sassy and
sexy.
It's an enjoyable ride, and not an en
tirely inconsistent one at that. "Play It to
the Bone" docs not lose its pace but never
really takes off cither. As such, it's a good
time, but there are better ways to spend
$7.50.
