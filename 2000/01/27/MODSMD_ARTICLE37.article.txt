# This Down-to-earth teen romance is a bit off
## 
### 
Even with picture-perfect Julia Stiles and Freddie
Prinze Jr. — fresh from their respective teen
scene successes "Ten Things I Hate about You"
and "She's All That" — the romantic comedy "Down to
You" simmers but never quite captures the complexity
of first love.

student with a flair for
youth and sponteneity. A 1
(Prinze) is her knight in
shining armor, the good
boy whose personality is
summarized by his simple
smile.
And yet something is not

quite right. The right lines are delivered; the moments
are romantic and sweet. But sometimes love gets lost in
translation, and watching two people struggle for emo
tion and feeling onscreen can get painful. Stiles and
Prinze are going in the right direction, but much of the
acting seems forced and too rehearsed.
While "Down to You" does not feel complete, it does
shine light and humor into the nature of romantic rela
tionships in college. The couple meets in a bar. He visits
her dorm room, and they chat about commonalities.
They fall in love, and everything feels like the movies.
When the "honeymoon" is over and feelings change,
the two confront those issues with tactics that hit close to
home for many college students: complete incompetence
and naivete.

At the end of the movie, Al's porn-star, best-friend
tells him, "It's not the meaning of life; it's the feeling."
"Down to You," fresh off of a decent box office start, at
tempts to convey the feeling of first love rather than the

meaning, hut it still has a long way to go before making
mv heart melt.
