## Angela's Ashes: Another good novel, bad movie 
### 
£ A ngela's Ashes" is an
/\ other unfortunate vic-
X JLtim of the novel-to
movie transition. Based on
Frank MeCourt's Fulit/.er Prize
winning best seller, the film falls
flat in its attempt to bring to the
screen MeCourt's gentle and
lightheaded memoir.

Director Alan Parker
("Evita," "The Commitments")
has made a remarkably
mediocre film about the child
hood of Frank McCourt, an Irish
lad growing up in the poverty
stricken city of Limerick. The
oldest son of a drunken father
(Robert Carlyle) and hapless
mother (Emily Watson), little
Frankie struggles through a mis
erable Irish Catholic childhood.
The movie is bleak and grim;
the somber colors and constant
rain in the cinematography are
very well done in bringing this
out. But we are not given enough
reason to care about the trials
and tribulations of Frankie's
childhood.
"Angela's Ashes" was proba
bly doomed to fail. McCourt's
novel won a Pulitzer for its seam
less combination of deft Irish sto
rytelling and a near-flawless lit
erary gift. The story is a joy to
read not because of any gripping
plot — he suffers, he grows up
and he makes it to America —
but because of its treatment in
McCourt's skilled hands.
Putting all that in a movie is
nearly impossible, and this film is
no exception. It drags in a great
many places, and very little that
happens to Frankie (played at
ages 5, 10 and 15 by Joseph
Breen, Ciaran Owens and
Michael Ix'gge, respectively) is
terribly interesting.
There are gifted touches of
humor and pathos scattered
throughout (as when young
Frankie prays, without a hint of
manufactured Hollywood
charm, "in the name of the Fa
ther. and the Son and of the Holy
Toast"), but they aren't enough
to hold the film together. There is
no light at the end of the tunnel
until the conclusion of the movie;
the misery is unrelenting and
t here ft >re uninteresting.
Watson and Carlyle are near
ly wasted in "Angela's Ashes."
Both give excellent perfor
mances as the destitute and des
perate parents of a brood of
starving children, many of whom

they lose along the way.
Watson gives a masterful por
trayal of a seemingly fragile
woman who is somehow strong
enough to guide four boys
through the wretched indigence
of their lives. Carlyle brings out
perfectly McCourt's written
image of his lovable, luckless fa
ther, whose alter ego spends all
the welfare money at the pub
while Angela waits at home with
hungry, wailing children.
Meanwhile, none of the vari
ous Franks are particularly gifted
actors, and his role is overdone
throughout the movie (which
leads one to believe it is Parker's
fault and not the actors').
Seeing the film after reading
the book will make it more en
joyable and at the same time less
impressive. Having the rich
background of McCourt's novel
in your head to supplement the
film helps a great deal, and Park
er has stayed remarkably true to
the events and timing of the
book. I couldn't imagine how
boring and flat the movie must
have seemed without all that
extra'information.
However, my moviegoing
companion, who has not read the
book, enjoyed the movie well
enough — perhaps with lower
expectations. But (as usually
happens in these cases) if you've
read the book, don't bother with
the movie.
