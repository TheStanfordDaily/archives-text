" Tis" is a re
markable book —

a simply told tale of human achievement in the
face of poverty, discrimination, ignorance and
alcoholism. It captures a boy's journey into
manhood and sympathetically portray: the
many dynamic people he meets along the way.
McCourt arrives in New York without
friends, family and money. With the aid of a
priest, he finds work cleaning the lobby of a ritzy
hotel, gets his first apartment and begins his
American life.
When the Korean War erupts, he joins the
army where he trains attack dogs, types reports
and attains the rank of corporal. However, upon
returning to the city, he returns to menial labor.
Thirsting for college and respectability but
lacking a high school degree, McCourt talks his
way into NYU's School of Education. After
graduation, he teaches high school, marries his
college girlfriend and becomes a father.
McCourt's prose eloquently reveals his im
pressions and the physical reality of his existence

but shies away from deep contemplation. This
incredibly powerful stylistic choice relegates the
reader to the powerless position of observer and
forces the reader to form his or her own moral
conclusions.
Unfortunately, his style also obscures the
subtle changes occurring within McCourt that
are not manifest in the scenes described. In his
attempt to keep his prose candid and unsenti
mental, McCourt glosses over many of his
epiphanies and emotional achievements so that
his character ages and rises in stature but never
grows decisively wiser. He draws no conclusions
about his past or present life; he merely lives and
observes.
The end of the story leaves McCourt in an un
resolved position. A marginally successful high
school teacher, he is trapped in a loveless mar
riage and still finds camaraderie only in bars. He
greatest attribute is his love for his daughter.
However, the author's writing suggests that
he has matured, thereby reaching a point that al
lows him to look back upon his life with wisdom.
The reader yearns to understand these changes
that occur outside the pages of the book and per
haps after the book's conclusion.
Despite these complaints, the book is re
markably well-written. It is a marvelous story
with vivid characters and touching events. Like
its predecessor," "l is" leaves the reader craving
more. Finishing the book is like losing a friend.
