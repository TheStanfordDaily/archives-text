## The 						lead is a duck? Fowl musical is just plain foul 
### 
Something foul is robbing the center stage in
Mountain View this month, and the best way
to describe it is a musical hybrid of "Show
girls" and "Babe."
"Everything's Ducky," a new musical inspired
by "The Ugly Duckling" and produced by the team

season's hit "Side
Show," was snatched
by Theatreworks for
its world premiere.
And from the looks
of opening night, this
duck could have

used a bit more time over the flame before being
served.
Here's the simplified plot: Serena (Angela
Robinson) is a duck who just doesn't fit in on the
farm. She's harassed and humiliated by her sisters,
her mother and various livestock.
One day she gets the opportunity to leave the
barn and journey into the big city. There she gets a
job working at a strip joint called "Poultry in Mo
tion," where wolves and coyotes pay money to
gawk at her tender white meat. She soon gets dis
covered by the city's top modeling agency, where
she is instantly the cover model for "Madame

A musical about an
ugly duckling that
isn't so pretty itself

Gazelle" and "Quackery Fair." No joke. This is
Hans Christian Anderson by way of Larry Flynt.
Meanwhile, there's a conceited duck prince
named Drake (Michael McEachran) who fights to
uphold the rule of Vegetarians against carnivorous
creatures like Wolf (David McDonald). Serena, it
seems, wouldn't mind a roll in the hay with either
of her two male interests. But first she's out to win
the contest for Best Singer in the Land.
Bill Russell and Jeffrey Hatcher's book relies
heavily on double entendres (juicy, tender, cock,
jackass, chicks, etc.). Serena talks quite openly
about foreplay and incredible sex. Chicken strip-
prance around the stage with basters. Who is
the audience here? I guess that's the main issue I
have with this ill-conceived, messy show. Adult
themes seem to be thrown into the pot for effect,
possibly to make it all more interesting for mature
audiences.
Henry Kreiger's music and Bill Russell's lyrics

have created some pretty catchy tunes with clever
rhymes ("I wouldn't want to meet her in an alley
way / Why can't we just turn her into some pat 6?).
But with the exception of a few shining moments
(Wolfs ballad, "I Eat Meat," for one), most of their
effort is all for naught.
Robinson gives a credible performance as Sere
na; she certainly has a beautiful voice for the part.
McDonald's sleazy and charming Wolf is one of
the production's anchors. Gina Ferrall's fashion in
dustry queen Galinda is an absolute hoot, especial
ly when her singing veers into Ethel Merman terri
tory. Danny Burstein deserves mention for his hi
larious flamboyant armadillo fashion designer.
Director Gip Hoppe has his cast on loose
reins — far too loose for their own good. Linda
Goodrich's choreography is virtually non-existent.
Kudos, however, must go to Robert Bissinger's
imaginative sets and Beaver Bauer's outrageous
costumes.
There has been talk of trying to take this show
to Broadway, and I have a feeling that if it did, it
would get eaten alive. But who's to say this ugly
duck can't one day transform into something beau
tiful?

The Ugly Duckling moves to the Big City and finds plenty of vices along the way.
