# Buried family secrets are focus of Stanford professor's novel
## 
### 
£r | ihe Good Life" is a psychologically in
tense masterpiece of a novel. Taking
JL place mainly over three days, with the
fourth and fifth days serving as an epilogue, the
central focus of the book is on the minds of every
one involved.
The reader is given the opportunity to see the
events and their effects through the eyes of each
of the major characters in the book. Through per
ceptions, fantasies and recollections, each of the
characters becomes frighteningly well-known.
The basic plot revolves around Theo and
Colleen Wolkoviak, a middle-aged couple. They
have one daughter who lives with Theo's parents.
Frustrated with their failed attempts to get
rich, the Wolkoviaks decide to kidnap the presi
dent of a major chemical corporation. They lock
the man, Stona Brown, in a small box and leave
him in a rented storage space. Posing as an envi
ronmental terrorist group, they demand $18.5

million for his return.
Clearly unprofes
sional, it is evident
from the start that
Theo's "perfect"
crime will not be as

easy as he expects..
The majority of the book focuses on the three
days Stona is kept imprisoned. The story jumps
from Stona's thoughts, memories and hallucina
tions to the worried recollections of his wife. Theo
and Colleen's worries, plans and memories are in
telligently mirrored with those of Theo's father
Malcolm, a retired police chief dying of emphyse
ma. By the end it is clear that no two people see
the same event in quite the same way.
During those three days, the reader penetrates
so far into the minds of the characters that all of
their secrets, insecurities and regrets are laid bare.
Many of the characters have unexpected skele

tons hiding in their closets, which sharply changes
the reader's perception of them.
My one criticism of the book is that this secret
sharing leads to plenty of repetition. As the char
acters obsess over specific issues, the reader is re
turned to those same issues time and time again.
Yet I found myself unable to put the novel
down. My emotions directly followed those of the
characters as their excitement, worry, fear and re
gret became my own. With each change of per
spective, I found myself understanding the story a
little better. By the time I finished the book, I was
so deeply involved that I felt like I was a part of
the events described.
