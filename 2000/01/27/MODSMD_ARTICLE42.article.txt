## What the hell is cuisine? Babbo's Mediterranean Bistro 
### 
Wc dashed through
this weekend's
pouring rain and

into the bright interior of Babbo's
Mediterranean Bistro in search of
Spanish tapas treats. Although we had
previously heard of Babbo's — conve
niently located in the Stanford Shop
ping Center — Wendy only recently
discovered their tapas offerings while
thumbing through the yellow pages.
The restaurant boasts a wide
repetoire of culinary styles: French,
Spanish, Mediterranean and Italian.
We had entered expecting to dine on
tapas and glance at the advertised
Paella Valenciana. Unfortunately, the
waiter informed us tapas were certain
ly not on the menu, and upon even the
most cursory reading, we confirmed as
much. So much for the yellow pages.
Bitterly, we ordered our drinks
while we more thoroughly contem
plated the dinner offerings. As an
apertif, Wendy got a kir royale (cham-

hand, had a whole lot of sour in her
drink, though not really the pukey
kind; her glass of freshly-squeezed
lemonade was served "tart" — mean
ing un-sweetened.
We started with a Hearty Tuscan
Vegetable Soup and a Salade di Or
ange. As advertised, and much to our
surprise (you can understand our sus
picion and distrust by this point), the
soup was indeed hearty and made of
fresh vegetables as promised. Addi
tionally, this flavorful soup was ele
gantly presented in a small porcelain
tureen with slices of fresh olive bread
on the side.
The Salade di Orange consisted of
romaine tossed with olives, orange
slices and balsamic vinaigrette, gar
nished with thin circles of sweet red
onions. Although the salad was heavy

on onion, with a little rearranging
Shirley really enjoyed the flavor com
bination.
You might be asking incredulously,
"But oranges? In a salad?" It may
sound like a dangerous idea, but trust
us, it was tasty.
As for the main courses, we or
dered a mushroom stew and the
Babbo's Vegetable Platter. The mush
room stew was a simple dish — pasta
mixed with mushrooms and broth.
Simplicity proved to be only the be
ginning of its excellent qualities.
As easy as it may seem to prepare,
pasta can be utterly destroyed. Just
ask 98 percent of the graduate stu
dents that have had at least one
spaghetti fiasco, desperate for a fast,
cheap meal. But even those that may
be sick to the back teeth of pasta
would appreciate the Mushroom
Stew. The pasta was cooked to perfect
consistency and had a fresh flavor of
its own that complemented the
sauteed mushrooms abundant in the
stew.
The vegetable platter was equally
excellent, proving that a plate of veg
etables could be anything but boring.
This mouthwatering dish was a sam
pler of finely prepared meatless items,
including a bed of buttery, herbed
lentils, succulently roasted zucchini
and tomatoes, a mild-tasting slice of
grilled polenta and a rich pile of pota
toes au gratin to finish it off. Not only
were all of these items skillfully sea

soned and flavored, but it was evident
that the restaurant used only the best
ingredients, which made all the differ
ence.
Babbo's also offers pizzas and
panini sandwiches. There are several
after-dinner options like Italian and
French desserts (tiramisu, pear and
apple tarts, creme brulee, prof
iteroles, chocolate cakes, etc.) and
espresso drinks.
However, the convenience of loca
tion and the allure of the restaurant's
ambiance, quality of food and fine
presentation comes with a hearty
price. The appetizers range from $6-
10 and the entrees anywhere from
$10-20. Desserts are in the $5 range,
and depending on the type drinks go
from $2.25 for the lemonade to $7 for
some of the apertifs.
In spite of our thin wallets, we man
aged to rack up a pretty, frightening
sum on our bill at the end of the night
(our most expensive meal yet, but
quite apropos for our "swan song"
farewell piece). This fact just proves
to you that the food at this place is de
liciously irresistable and that this
"Babbo" guy is one really smart man.
Go to Babbo's for a graduation din
ner or to impress the McKenzie re
cruiters. Or perhaps if you ask nicely
your freshman faculty advisor may
sponsor a dinner to this place (they do
get a budget, you know).
