This new photographic exhibit at SFMOMA
presents the work of William Gedney. A very
private person during his lifetime, Gedney only
exhibited once in 1968. It is for this reason that this
particular exhibit, presented IS years after his death,
is truly worth visiting. The exhibit gives the observer
the chance to enjoy his early work and see how his

style has ma

changed.
Though
Gedney trav
eled extensive
ly, his most im-

portant work was done in 1%4 and 1972 while visiting
Kentucky, and in San Francisco in 1966. Perhaps in
spired by photographers of the time, who were intent
on depicting the piteous situation of the poor across
America, Gedney requested to live with a large im
poverished family in rural Kentucky. However, rather
than encouraging a sense of despair, his photos show
the "deep sympathy he had for his subjects" and come
to glorify the human spirit and its dominance over ad
versity through the ties of family and community.
I lis work in San Francisco is similarly investigative.
He is neither critical nor sympathetic of the wild di
versity that appeared during the freedom movement
of the '60s. His photos capture both the search for ex
pression and the isolation, the harshness of mass com
munal settings and the "gentleness of their members."

Kentucky forms a type of frame for the exhibit. Gedney balances the bareness
of poverty, apparent in the homes, the cloths and the gaunt nature of his subjects
with the richness of the family he is photographing.
In one photo, a girl stares defiantly into the camera. Her face is smudged with

dirt, and her eyes look directly through you. In the next,
we see her dancing beside her brother on a rickety
porch. A youth gazing hopelessly into space becomes
the protective brother backpacking his younger sibling
up a hill. In spite of their desperate surroundings, there
is care, tenderness, protection and education to be
found.
The significance of passing on knowledge and
solving problems together is especially stressed later in
the exhibit. Cars —fixing them, driving them, talking
over them, appreciating them—bring the community
together. Whatever issues arise, everyone is facing
them as a family.
The best portraits of the exhibit can be found in
Gedney's work from San Francisco. He captures many
different faces of the freedom crusade. Each is defiant,
personable and, most importantly, themselves.
There is, however, a mingled sadness. The
"communal spaces," with their empty halls, unmade
mattresses and bare walls, are far from welcoming. Peo
ple huddle together as if cravin^comfort.
Perhaps the most striking photo is that of a man
curled up under a table. Above his desk is a crazy col
lage of photos, paper, drawings and cutouts. It seems as
if he wished to create a portrait of his imagination, glo
rifying freedom of expression. And yet he is human and
therefore separated from his artistry.
Gedney's photography captures the bittersweet
fate of his subjects. He introduces the viewer to people
who rise above the boundaries of what surrounds them

to find elation and freedom. In addition, there will be a free Tuesday program,
"William Ciedney in San Francisco," on Feb. 1,
