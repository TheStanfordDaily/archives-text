# Students say Nom Comm neglected for key decisions
## 
### Marisa Pavlik Staff writer 
Some students have raised con
cerns about the University's inconsis
tent use of the ASSII Nominations
Commission in forming search com
mit lees for high-level administration
posts.
The seven-member Nominations
Commission recommends students
for the University's 4(1 to 45 perma
nent committees and. if asked by a
committee chair, nominates students
for ad hoc c< immittees.
However, the University did not
use the commission to select student
representatives for the search com
mittees for the president and the
provost.
Administrators did use the com
mission for the search committee for
the new dean of admissions and fi
nancial aid.
The Nominations Commission is
also not necessarily responsible for

finding student representatives for
the ad hoc committees, said James
Montoya. vice provost for Student
Affairs. "It's up to the committee
chair's discretion."
Search committees, formed to
find replacements after an adminis
trator decides to leave Stanford, are
often ad hoc committees.
"Norn Comm has no formal con
nection with search committees."
Montoya said.
However, the administration de
cided to use the commission when
searching for a replacement for de
parting Dean of I Indergraduate Ad
missions and Financial Aid Robert
Kinnally.
According to Montoya. the same
thing was done for the IW7 commit
tee that selected Kinnally. "We felt
that it would be appropriate [to do it
again |." Montoya said.
Montoya said another factor was
that the commission chose student
representatives on the Committee on
Undergraduate Admission and Fi
nancial Aid.
"This position has a close tic to a
committee that also uses Nom
Comm," Montoya said, unlike the
position of president or provost.
"The ASSU, and I as well, believe
that all University decisions should
have some amount of student input,"
said Undergraduate Senate Chair
Steven Aronowitx, a senior. "It adds
legitimacy. You can say you used stu
dent info and exposed your decision
to students, which is very, very im
portant."
"Nom Comm is fast. Nom Comm
is easy. It's the way you're supposed
to do it," Aronowitz added.
In his three years of ASSU experi
ence, ASSU President Mike Levin, a
junior, said he has seen the Nomina
tions Commission work well, select
ing students so that "the president

has seen little need to change any rec
ommendations before approving
them."
However, Levin said he was disap
pointed when the administration
chose to pick students for the
provost's search committee without
consulting the commission.
"We feel very strongly that this
was a mistake and stated so at the
time," Levin said. "The removal of
student input from the task of select
ing peer representatives to any com
mittee as important as that was inap
propriate."
When forming the Presidential
Search Committee, the administra
tion contacted Montoya, Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Lduca
tion John Bravman and the ASSU,
requesting a list of names within a
week.
"Technically, we were consulted,
but we couldn't go through the whole
process of having Nom ( omm do in
terviews and the Senate or (iraduate
Student Council approve the names
[in one week]," said ASSI I Vice Pres
ident John Mills, a graduate student

in genetics.
Mills said a search committee
should he considered a University
committee in all respects, including
the method used for student repre
sentative selection.
"When administrators do not seek
student representation for a given
committee through the Nominations
Commission, they are effectively dis
enfranchising students in the policy
making process at Stanford, and. ulti
mately. the best interests of students
are not being served." Mills said.
"Ad hoc committees are not re
quired by anything in writing to use
Nom C omm." said senior Kristin
Torres, chair of the commission.
When administrators decide to
bypass the commission, they can con
tact the ASSI) or choose from among
the students they know personally,
Mills said.
However, "when they use Nom
Comm. it's easier for them." Torres
said.
I )uring the spring, "we know what
positions are available. We have time
to advertise and put up fliers. We

spend one weekend straight on inter
viewing [for the permanent commit
tees]," she said.
Torres said ad hoc committees
usually must be formed quickly and
the commission takes time to inter
view applicants and decide.
"It's a smaller scale of doing the
exact same thing," she said.
For ad hoc committees, Torres
said she e-mails a list of students who
have expressed interest in other com
mittees.
"We have to coordinate the
schedules of interviewers and inter
viewees; it usually doesn't happen
overnight," she said.
The nominations commission is
made up of three undergraduates,
three graduate students and Torres,
the chair.
"We think it's a fair process when
they do (use Nom Comm] — not that
it's unfair when they don't," she said.
Torres said that to qualify for com
mittees, students must have good
communication skills, resourceful
ness, background or interest in the is
sues and thoughtfulness.
