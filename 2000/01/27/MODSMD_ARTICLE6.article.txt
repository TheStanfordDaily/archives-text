## IMs eliminate basketball refs; Some players calling foul 
### Deena Skolnick 
At the end of last quarter, the
Stanford Intramural Department
announced that it would eliminate
referees from intramural basket
ball games. The decision was
based on a survey of intramural
players conducted at the end of
last year.
Two of the biggest concerns
raised by the survey were inconve
nient signup procedures and un
skilled officials, especially in bas
ketball.
The IM Department solved the
former problem by making
signups Web-based, and the latter
by eliminating referees for all bas
ketball games.
The decision to allow students
to manage their own games was
announced to resident assistants
and intramural representatives at
the end of last quarter by e-mail,
and was reinforced at captains'
meetings at the beginning of win
ter quarter.
Previously, students who had
undergone limited training in the
rules of basketball and who were
familiar with the game served as
referees.
This year, according to the IM
Department Website,"Teams will
call their own fouls when on of
fense to the absolute best of their
abilities. Team captains are urged
to encourage their teams to honor
the league by admitting to a corn
mitted foul."
The main complaint against stu
dent referees was that, despite
their knowledge of the sport, they
"weren't as skilled as players may
like," according to junior Erin
Moix, student director of intramu
rals.
"Even someone who's watched
basketball for years wouldn't be
able to call shots accurately," she
added.
The IM Department had the
choice of eliminating referees or
bringing in trained officials.
The department researched IM
programs at other universities and
found that students typically react
well to a lack of referees.
It instituted the new policy on a
trial basis. Moix said that at this
point the response has been posi
tive. so the policy will become per
manent.
Reactions from current mem

bers of IM basketball teams have
been mixed. Freshman Daraspreet
Kainth said, "The administration's
ruling to eliminate referees ignores
the fact that a mediator is needed
when there are controversies."
Moix countered this complaint
with the fact that a student supervi
sor is present at all games to help
solve disputes as they arise.
Kainth acknowledged that "at
the moment, there have been few
problems."
West Lagunita IM coordinator
Nick Handler, a freshman, said
many students are complaining
that games move too slowly with
out referees.
Although there is no direct solu
tion for this, Moix said that "play
ers would rather move slower and
be fair than move faster and have
[fouls] not be called."
Moix said that because of the
fast speed of the game, basketball
is the only sport that can tolerate,
the removal of officials, and no
changes are planned for other
sports.
