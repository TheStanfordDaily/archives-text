## Clinton makes final State of the Union address 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Presi
t dent Clinton proposed a $35()-bil
, lion tax cut. big spending increases
; for schools and health care and
; photo ID licenses for handgun pur
j chases Thursday night as he offered
the final agenda of his presidency.
"The state of our union is the
, strongest it has ever been,"he
boasted.
At the start of an election-year.
Clinton rebuked Congress in his
last State of the Union address and
called for action. "For too long this
Congress has been standing still on
some of our most pressing national
priorities," he chided.
The president noted that next
month the United States will
achieve the longest period of eco
nomic growth in the nation's histo
t ry, and called on Americans to "set
great goals."
The president offered a litany of
initiatives, many of them sure to be
rewritten or ignored by Congress.
His tax cut proposals were intend
ed primarily to promote education
al opportunities and expand health
insurance and child care for lower
and middle-income Americans.
; The initiatives included relief from
the "marriage penalty" - an idea
first championed by Republicans -
and a new program of retirement

savings accounts.
Most of the proposals were
released in advance but the White
House withheld Clinton's gun
licensing measure until the last
minute to build suspense. Similar to
a plan offered by Vice President A 1
Gore, it would require handgun
purchasers to first obtain a state
license showing they have passed a
background check and a gun safety
requirement, such as a training
course or an exam.
States could choose not to par
ticipate in the program. The
National Rifle Association dis
missed the plan as pointless and
unworkable.
"Every state in this country
already requires hunters and auto
mobile drivers to have a license. 1
think they ought to do the same
thing for handgun purchases." Clin
ton said. "1 hope you'll help me
pass that in this Congress."
Clinton called for passage of a
patients' bill of rights to strengthen
consumer protection, gun-safety
legislation, campaign finance
reform, an increase in the minimum
wage and votes on long-stalled judi
cial nominations.
Republicans ridiculed Clinton's
proposals but did not rule out
working with him on such issues as

education -and health care. "If we
enacted all the new programs the
president has talked about, we'd
spend just about the entire surplus
on bigger and more expensive gov
ernment." said House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-111.
Clinton was greeted by applause
and handshakes by Republicans
and Democrats alike as he made
his way into the House chamber to
address a joint session of Congress.
His wife. Hillary, and their daugh
ter. Chelsea, home from college,
were in the audience. His speech
turned out to be his longest State of
the Union address: 89 minutes,
besting his 1995 record of 81 min
utes. By one count, he was inter
rupted by applause 128 times, most
of it from Democrats.
More than an hour into his
speech, Clinton flubbed a line
meant to credit Gore with helping
making communities more "liv
able." Instead. Clinton said "liber
al" - not once but twice. The audi
ence - Gore included - guffawed.
Five days before the New
Hampshire primary, Clinton seized
the chance to boost Gore in his race
for the Democratic presidential
nomination. Six times, Clinton
made references to the vice presi
dent. Clinton also recognized

another candidate: the first lady,
running for the U.S. Senate seat in
New York.
Many of Clinton's proposals

were repackaged from earlier years
and.in some cases resubmitted
with spending figures double or
triple the original amount.

Clinton boasted that the nation
has been lifted from economic dis
tress. social decline and political
gridlock.
