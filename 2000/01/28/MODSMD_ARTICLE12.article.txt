# Teen smoking drops for first time in decade
## 
### 
ATLANTA (AP) — Smoking among
high schoolers dropped in 1999 for the
first time since the government began
keeping track at the start of the decade.
But nearly one in 10 children are already
smoking cigarettes in middle school.
A nationwide survey of 7,529 high
schoolers in September and October
found that 28.4 percent reported using
tobacco products in the preceding month,
the Centers for Disease Control and Pre
vention said Thursday.
In 1997, the last time the CDC looked

at high school smoking, 36.4 percent of
students said they had smoked in the pre
ceding month. At the time, teen smoking
was on the rise, from 34.8 percent in 1995
and 27.5 percent in 1991. the first year the
CDC started keeping track.
The CDC said it expected teen smoking
rates to drop - just not by so much. The
agency said differences between the 1999
survey and earlier studies may have exag
gerated the decline.
"We may have peaked in terms of
smoking rates among high school stu

dents." said Michael Eriksen, director of
the CDC's Office on Smoking and Health.
The drop in smoking rates had been
expected because tobacco companies
raised cigarette prices about 45 cents a
pack last year to help pay for the $206 bil
lion national settlement.
As part of the settlement, billboard ads
for cigarettes were banned and the tobac
co industry was barred from running
advertisements with cartoon characters
such as Joe Camel that anti-smoking
activists sav are aimed at youngsters. In

many places, cigarette billboards have
been replaced by signs with anti-smoking
messages.
For the first time ever, the CDC also
surveyed middle school students about
smoking, questioning about as many mid
dle-schoolers as high school students.
Nine percent of the students in grades
six through eight said they had smoked
cigarettes. Nearly 13 percent said they had
used some tobacco product — including
chewing tobacco, pipes and cigars.
"I don't think it was that surprising.

because we see such high rates in high
school that we know it begins in middle
school. We just didn't know at what level."
Eriksen said.
Ron Todd, director of tobacco control
for the American Cancer Society, agreed
that higher cigarette prices should result in
fewer smokers of high school age. But he
said the CDC's numbers surprised him.
"1 wouldn't expect a decline that dra
matic." Todd said. "We'll have to continu
ally monitor it to get a better picture of
what's really going on."
