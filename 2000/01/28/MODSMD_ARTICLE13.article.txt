# Bradley shifts gears into offensive

STRATHAM, N.H. (AP) -
Bill Bradley, struggling to balance
his high-road campaign themes
with a need to overtake A 1 Gore,
said Thursday he'd "had it" with his
Democratic rival and pushed ahead
with a new, more confrontational
style.
With polls suggesting Gore has
been moving ahead just days
before the New Hampshire prima
ry, Bradley indicated the accusa
tions and sharp words he had for
the vice president in their debate
on Wednesday were no one-night
strategy.
"How you run a campaign is
how you govern. That was the point
I was making and I waited a long
time to make it." Bradley said.
"Last night 1 decided I'd had it
and I'm going to call my opponent
on what he's been doing," said

Bradley. "Making that point sever
al times struck a positive chord in a
lot of people who had just been
waiting essentially for him to be
called out."
Gore's camp said Bradley was
showing desperation.
But Bradley, who accused Gore
of campaign dishonesty, said he felt
comfortable and was getting a good
response from voters.
Indeed, 76-year-old Sherry Tay
lor said, "1 think the fact that he
showed a little more vitality last
night was good." She added, "I felt
better about him and I was all set to
go for Gore."
On the other hand. Bond Perry,
a Bradley supporter, said he liked
the candidate's higher energy level
but "I didn't like what he did last
night. There was, like, despera
tion."

Gore, addressing employees of a
high-tech firm in Manchester on
Thursday, said anew that Bradley
was turning the campaign negative.
"I don't understand how some
one can condemn negative attacks
while in the same breath can make
negative attacks," Gore said.
One of Bradley's contentions in
the debate was that Gore had been
inconsistent on abortion rights,
including voting as a member of
Congress to restrict abortion rights.
And that idea was brought back to
Gore on Thursday.
He was appearing on a New
Hampshire public radio call-in
show when a woman who identified
herself as Sara accused him of lying
about his abortion record in the
debate. "I don't know how I can
support your candidacy if you're so
dishonest on national TV," she

said.
Gore replied, "I have always
supported Roe vs. Wade. I have
always supported keeping abortion
legal. And it's true, early in my
career I voted to restrict the use of
federal funding in some circum
stances, but over the years I've
come to the view that federal fund
ing ought to be available."
In addition to the tougher
rhetoric, Bradley stepped up his
schedule Thursday and there was a
new air of urgency surrounding his
campaign entourage. He opened
the day at one frigid outdoor rally,
collected the endorsement of envi
ronmental activists at another and
rotated through a series of town
meetings in a crowded campaign
day.
Along the way. he stopped by
grocery and convenience stores for
chaotic handshaking. At one stop
he helped shoppers bag groceries.
He bought donuts at another.
"Pull it off, I'm with you," urged
74-year-old Ed Rein at one stop.
"With your help 1 will." Bradley
responded.
His shift in approach had been
under discussion internally for
days, since Bradley was hammered
in lowa's leadolf caucuses. Surro
gates such as Nebraska Sen. Bob
Kerrey have been battering Gore
in public, arguing he's been distort
ing Bradley's record, and have
been pushing Bradley in private to
become more aggressive.
The risk for Bradley is to his
core appeal as the nontraditional
politician who is above attack poli
tics.
Even in the midst of the new
approach, he said in response to a
question that he had occasionally
elbowed other players in basketball
but added:
"Politics is different. Politics
should be something that's higher.
Politics should be something that
elevates us." .
He is also running a new batch
