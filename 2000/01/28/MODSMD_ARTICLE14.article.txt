## 
### 
VITINA. Yugoslavia (AP) —
Lulzim Ukshini says he was hang
ing out with his buddies in Sam's
Pizzeria when a grenade exploded
in a Serb store across town. He
also says the first he heard about
the attack was when four U.S.
peacekeepers came looking for
him.
"They started to beat me non
stop. telling me to admit that I did
it,"he said. "Then they pulled a
knife out and threatened to cut me
into pieces."
Ukshini's story of mistreatment
at the hands of American soldiers
is being echoed by other ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, who tell of
beatings, inappropriate body
searches of women and daily
harassment bv U.S. troops.
The allegations come at a time
of heightened concern following
the rape and murder of an 11-year
old ethnic Albanian girl. U.S. Staff
Sgt. Frank J. Ronghi, a weapons
squad leader from Fort Bragg.
N.C.. was charged this month with
murder and indecent acts with a
child in connection with her death.
Ethnic Albanians say the killing
is not their only complaint against
the Americans.
Their allegations have prompt
ed an official Army investigation
and threaten a breakdown in trust
between the U.S. peacekeepers
and the citizens they were sent to
protect.
U.S. officials declined to discuss
specific allegations because many
of the complaints are under inves
tigation.
But the Army acknowledges it
has a big problem with community
relations in Kosovo.
"These are serious allegations
that we do take seriously." Maj.
Erik Gunhus. a public affairs offi
cer at Camp Bondsteel. (old I he
Associated Press. "We will investi
gate and it we find they are true,
we will act accordingly. We want to
show that no one is above the law."
In a statement issued Sunday.

the Army said preliminary findings
indicate several U.S. soldiers may
have been involved in misconduct,
"including improper use of physi
cal force and threats against Koso
var males and inappropriate physi
cal contact with Kosovar females."
Gunhus confirmed several soldiers
have been transferred out of Viti
na in connection with the investi
gation.
Still. Ukshini and other Vitina
residents are skeptical.
"I wouldn't complain to KFOR
because it does no good." Ukshini
said, using the acronym for the
NATO-led peacekeeping force
that entered Kosovo in June after
a 7(S-day bombing campaign forced
a halt to Yugoslav President Slo
bodan Milosevic's crackdown on
ethnic Albanians.
"Every time we went to com
plain. they told us: 'It's not true.
Our soldiers don't behave like
that.'" said Ramiz Hasani. 21.
whose father, Xhauit. has been
detained by the Americans in the
killing of a Macedonian police
man.
Hasani said American soldiers
have entered his father's restau
rant several times in the past two
months and harassed customers
for no apparent reason.
Asked about the allegations.
Defense Secretary William Cohen
said he cannot comment on specif
ic cases. But he said U.S. and
NATO forces arc doing police
work in Kosovo only because there
are not yet enough civilian police
available. He emphasized the need
for more police.
"We have long stated the posi
tion that the I Jnited States and our
NATO forces can carry out a mili
tary operation quite successfully,
but they are not for the most part -
there are some exceptions - trained
to carry out police work," Cohen
said "They are not trained for
that, they are not competent really
to carry out police work, nor
should thev be dome it."
