Though imperfect, the SAT
is one of many useful criteri
on in the admissions process

The ever-controversial
Scholastic Achieve
ment Test has once
again entered the limelight.
This time, it came under fire at
a UC Board of Regents meet
ing a little more than a week
ago where State Assemblyman
Antonio Villaraigosa ques
tioned its potential to serve as
an indicator of a student's abil
ity in college. Further some
would find it ironic that the
flagship of the UC system —
Berkeley —would rely so heav
ily on the test and all the sub
jectivity it entails in its admis
sions process, especially after
eliminating the allegedly dis
criminatory categories of race
and ethnicity from the picture.
Others might also attack the
SAT and anything that
attempts to rank students in
such a hard and fast manner.
It is fairly evident that a mul
tiple choice test such as the
SAT is not a very accurate
indicator of a student's poten
tial in college. All it does is to
measure a student's ability to
take standardized tests and
gives some indication of how
much they have learned in a
specilic subject area. Nor is it
Iree of bias. It is no secret that

access to test preparation and
knowledge of the type of ques
tions appearing on the exam
will improve one's scores. In
short, the SAT does little to
measure the skills that often
really matter in college and
give a greater richness to the
academic experience: the abil
ity to write well, to conceive of
and articulate ideas clearly,
and most importantly, to he
creative.
Yes, such tests are highly
problematic, but until univer
sities achieve a more perfect
criterion for admitting stu
dents they will have to remain.
Even private schools, which
allow for more individualized
attention to the admissions
process, have retained them.
The reason: it is only one of
many possible measuring
devices. Despite its many
flaws, it is in some ways no less
perfect than other indicators,
which must be used in order to
get a truly well-rounded
understanding ,of the student
and his or her experience.
What this means is that until
college admissions committees
are able to construct a set of
standards that will truly mea
sure current performance and
future success in college (if
that's ever possible), factors
such as the SAT, grades and
even race and ethnicity need
to be thrown into the pot.
