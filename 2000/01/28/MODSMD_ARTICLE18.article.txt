There is no virtue if
there is no immor
tality. -You are
blessed in believing that,
or else most unhappy. -
Fyodor Dostoyevsky
It's an old question, but

one about which I've never really under
stood the other side. I low can there be any
morality without immortality-thus implying
religion? ()l course it is obvious that atheists
are moral. The majority of society in fact
has always depended on the morals of athe
ists (much like the kindness of strangers).
But that is not the point. The point is: an
atheist cannot say that he is right. He may
decide that he will not kill people. He might
recognize that in order for a society to func
tion very well, its citizens must, for the most
part, avoid killing one another. Thus he may
even argue that murderers should be pun
ished for the well-being of society. But he
cannot tell a murdetei that lie is. in the end,
wrong, because: "who says?"
An atheist cannot even say that if he
were to later change his mind and decide to
kill people, he would be wrong. It is only a
decision. It may be inhuman. It may be
against his nature. But it cannot be wrong
objectively. It cannot be evil, unless evil
means only that which we dislike.
And that is what I mean by saying there
is no morality when \vt- have no religion.
There is no real evil, and conversely there is
no real good. Yet we still must make deci
sions. whether we believe in (iod or not.
And I would posit that we act on the basis
of only three things: sell interest, prejudice

or habit, and religion. Some people may
object that religion is really prejudice or
sell-interest after all. And certainly to a
great extent it is. We are brought up as
Christians and we say we love Jesus. We are
brought up as I lindus and we don't eat beef.
We are afraid of vanishing from existence
without an exit call and so we sell our souls
to the highest or the closest bidder. Never
theless. some people believe in an absolute
good that is greater than themselves and
some do not, and this is what I would call
religion.
Of course the majority of what we do is
based upon our habit, our socialization. We
do not kill others, for example, because we
have not been adapted to that. Similarly, we
do not for the most part play cricket around
here, since we have not been raised in a
cricket-playing country. But if a person
were to be brought up surrounded by mur
der. they would probably not be too adverse
to killing. At least they would not have the
same guttural reaction to violent deaths that
most of us would.
We act a certain way in a given situation,
because we are told it is the thing to do in
that situation. Not that it is the right thing to
do, or that it is what we should do, but that
it is what is done. Our behavior is not whit
tled down from infinite possibilities, but
built up by suggestion. It is, as Foucault
says, a positive unconscious.
The majority of what we call right or
wrong is probably also a result of this preju
dice. This is of course the stereotype of chil -
dren. but I think it is true to a much greater
extent. It is an absurd kind of morality,
though, and is certainly without defense.

since it is admittedly nothing more than an
accident of birth. Yet if a person is an athe
ist. he has no choice of morality beyond this
morality of habit or self-interest, which real
ly is no morality at all.
Some may say, "Even atheists have con
sciences. Doesn't that keep them moral."
Yes it does, but it does not give them a jus
tification for morality. Atheists also have
stomachs, but sometimes it is necessary to
go without food for a while. Nothing is
wrong with that. It may also sometimes be
necessary to disturb the conscience. Who is
to say that is wrong? The conscience is only
a biological mechanism. All of our remorse,
confessions and apologies are only ways to
massage the conscience that satisfies it as
food satisfies the stomach. It is not morality.
It is not a justification of it. If I choose to
destroy my conscience I cannot say in the
end thai I am "wrong."
My point (and I think this is actually my
only point) is that an atheist may do many
things, but he may not in good conscience
say that anything is evil. He may not make
any absolute judgment because he has no
standard for judgment without religion,
beyond his own prejudices and social con
struct. In "Apocalypse Now," Colonel
Kurtz says it is judgment that defeats us.
And I say: a word to the wise for righteous
atheists.
