considering enrollment in the courses F.con.
50 and I con. 50M have been dealt a disser
vice is evident from published articles in
rhe Stanford Daily. Econ 50M features
some mathematical material pertinent to

Econ 50 and the simultaneous registration
in both courses had previously been accept
able.
The Daily editorial on Jan. 11. "Ciood
idea poor planning" states that a decision to
make Econ. 50M a prerequisite for Econ. 50
was summarih announced ;it the beginning
ol the present quarter. Professor I lammond
of the Economics Department expresses

regret in a follow up letter for"the inconve
nience and distress imposed on students bv
the suddenness of these changes," and fur
ther notes that his Department was
responding to pressures from elsewhere in
the I Jniversity.
It would seem that the entire University
faculty deserves a fuller account and justifi
cation from those outside the Department

who can bring about such a precipitate
action in matters of the curriculum. The
absence, furthermore, of a response from
other members of the Department only
adds to the sense of bewilderment and
unease.
