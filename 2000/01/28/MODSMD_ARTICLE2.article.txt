# Steamtunnels creators launch new venture
## 
### Nadira Hira Contributing writer 
The last Stanford heard of
Lawrence Gentilello. Aaron Bell and
Tuyen Truong. formerly known as
DJ Monkey, Drunken Master and
The Sultan, respectively, they had left
steamtunneling and Facebook pho
tos and decided to settle into a re
laxed senior year.
Today, however, the three co
founders of Steamtunnels: Stanford's
Underground are back with a new
creation. Steamtunnels Internet Mag
(www.steamtunnels.net), as part of
CollegeWebCiuide Inc.
This new company, housed in a

Boston office with a second planned
in San Francisco, in addition to the
new Steamtunnels Web site, features
an Internet maga/ine, the first issue
of which will reach more than S(X),(XX)
students at campuses across the coun
try.
Steamtunnels Internet Mag is
based on the original Steamtunnels
site, which, at the beginning of the
school year, found its creators butting
heads with the University because of
its Facebook component. The site
displayed Stanford Freshman Face
book photos, about which the Uni
versity expressed concerns over
copyright, safety and privacy issues.
The new site began when the Col

legeWebGuide team, including the
founder of Access Magazine, a week
ly newspaper insert much like Parade
Magazine, but with an Internet focus,
contacted the three Steamtunnels
founders and invited them to a meet
ing in Las Vegas to plan their new
venture: a magazine like Access tar
geted at college students coupled
with a Web site designed by the
Steamtunnels founders.
"[They understood] the print por
tion of the business very well, but
needed some people with the spunk
and skills to build and manage the on
line component of the company,"
Bell said.
"[They| Hew us to Vegas," Gen

tilello added, and "we hashed out
company strategy over a weekend,
and we left with a hand-shake agree
ment to join as the third, fourth and
fifth people aboard the [new Col
lege'WehCiuide] company."
In the three months since that
meeting, the company has grown to
25 people, and most of what the
group envisioned at the start is well
underway. Steamtunnels" mission,
which was once to provide a guide to
local life for Stanford students, now
features technology in a more central
role.
"We realized that young people
are first to discover popular online
applications and products, [such as]
MP3 and ICO. We want to support
and strengthen this phenomenon by
bringing products, technologies and
Web sites to students on a weekly and
daily basis via our prjnt magazine, e
mail newsletters and Web site," Cien
tilello said.
"The net is not just for computer
geeks anymore, and Steamtunnels
will show you what's worth the trip,"
Bell said.
Steamtunnels' national appeal,
however, may well rest on its Schools
section, which will provide local con
tent from its affiliate schools across
the nation.
This component of the site will op
erate nationally much like the old
Steamtunnels site did locally by offer
ing college students services such as
region-specific links, event calendars
and restaurant guides.
"At the heart of this, we just want
to help students have a good time,"
Gentilello said. "Before, that meant a
social calendar and restaurant guides,
but now, we're building on that to be
come a guide to cool technologies
and products of the coming millenni
um."
Given this goal, the new Steam
tunnels site also features a Web
Guide, which includes reviews of

sites the team thinks are "worth a
look." A Tech Guide section has also
been added to supplement the offline
magazine with information guides to
technologies highlighted by the site.
The site retains its music compo
nent with a section of music site re
views and downloads. Plans are also
in progress to re-establish the Steam -
tunnels radio station of the old site.
Finally, the site offers surfers the op
portunity to download many of the
technologies it reviews in its Down
loads section, which houses, among
other things, MP3 players, Web
browsers and games.
"Our old Web site taught us that
technology and the Internet are great
tools for helping people communi
cate and for finding useful informa
tion quickly," Truong said. "Our mis
sion is to continue to provide services
that are intelligent and informative,
and to celebrate technology's useful
ness in improving the college experi
ence."
Despite the controversy over the
initial site, the group said they had
heard nothing from the Stanford ad
ministration and that they hoped the
administration would be "happy that
we've moved on to less controversial
services."
The first print edition of the mag
azine was released this past Wednes
day and the Web site is currently
available in preview version. The full
version will be available in Septem
ber.
