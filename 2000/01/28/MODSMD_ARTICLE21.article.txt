# Reality in small doses
## Finding passion in your life 
### 
Miriam Ali

I remember that when I was younger 1
was strongly discouraged from reading
romance novels. My mother would not
let me put my pretty pink-covered books in
the house library. She designated a special
"smut shell" lor my books in my room and
always laughed at me when she caught me
reading one. Even my little sister made a
point cm reading Hemingway around me
while I was perusing the pages of "Savage
Thunder."
I persisted, however, and I think that 1
was right to do so. Romance novels defi
nitely add a good deal of spice to life. While
other poor souls are suffering through CS
105 lectures. I can transport myself into the
middle of little scenes like: "The tall man
pushed a dark lock of hair out of his eyes
and one eyebrow lifted sardonically. "Never
thought this dav would come/ he grinned

and my heart Hip-flopped. Then Royce Car-
Ivle. tenth Duke of Thornbush knelt and
poured his heart into the next few words.
"Mariam. milady, I seem to have fallen in
love. You are the only person 1 can ever
imagine in my life. You complete me. 1 want
to grow old with you. Forget about finishing
your statistics problem set and marry me
instead."
And the best thing is that I have a whole
host of these private fantasies. Sometimes
the protagonist is a Caribbean pirate, some
times a Brazilian diamond miner, some
times an Italian count. Regardless, he is
always dazzling and charming and brave
and successful. And in love with me. And in
my little dream world. 1 have long, straight
red hair and am good at calculus. And I am
in love with him.
Obviouslv I am delusional. But so what?

At least 1 have an escape from the pressures
of every day life that does not involve taking
10 shots of vodka in one night or wrestling a
pig naked in White Plaza.
Let us not forget that romance novels are
easy to read and they last longer than a
magazine. They are some of the few written
works in our post-modernist age that still
follow subject-verb-noun sentence struc
ture, and they are simply more fun than
Cicero or Joyce.
Reading out loud from a romance novel
to a mixed group is also sure to provoke
much hilarity. For a cheap giggle, read this
line to any male friend or stodgy female
friend in a falsetto voice and watch their
reaction: "His mouth slanted over hers
without apology and as her knees began to
buckle she held on to his broad shoulders
for strength. In that moment she realized

she never wanted to let go."
On a more serious note, romance novels
boost your expectations about love. My per
sonal theory is that the reason you see a
beautiful woman dating a spazzed-out
looking insensitive dork is because she has
not read a romance novel.
If she read romance novels, she would
know better than to settle for such men.
While I concede that as a result some
women will wait around forever for Mr.
Right. 1 still maintain that being alone is bet
ter than being with Mr. Sort of Right.
Therefore, all people should read at least
one romance novel in their lifetime.
According to "U.S. News and World
Report," the average romance customer
spends $1,2(X) a year at Barnes and Noble
on these books when 60 percent of Ameri
can households do not buy even one book.

Haven't we all had a sneaking desire to find
out what this "romance revolution" is all
about?
I call lor romantic fiction to be mandato
ry reading in all Introduction to the Human
ities classes. We can indoctrinate our fresh
man in the wisdom of Dante, Shakespeare
and Judith McNaught. At the very least,
people would then have a basis on which to
mock them.
Pseudo-intellectuals of the world unite.
You have nothing to lose but your preten
sions. Embrace popular culture. It ain't that
bad.
