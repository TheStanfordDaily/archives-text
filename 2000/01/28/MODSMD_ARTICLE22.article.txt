Alter living six months with Stanford's heartbreaking
exit from last year's College World Series, the top-ranked
( ardinal will open the 2(XH) season by taking on Fresno
State in a three-game series starting this Friday at Beiden
Field in Fresno.

season at Sunken Diamond last year
by taking two of three from Stanford.
The crowd at Fresno, however, isn't
known for making things easy on vis
itors. as Bulldogs fans tend to be on
the rowdy side.
They're obviously going to be
very tough ... it's always a lot of fun
going down there and playing in that
nice family environment," said ju
nior outfielder Joe Borchard, tongue
planted firmly in cheek.
I lead coach Mark Marquess is
somewhat more diplomatic.
" They're a quality program, and
they always have good pitching." he
said. "Bob Bennett has been there
for 30 years, and he's a great coach.
[They have] tough fans to play in
front 0f... it's a good test for us.
That's why we play them."
Junior Jason Young. Stanford's
staff ace and a preseason All-Ameri
can. will probably take on Fresno

State's Tom Graham in what promis
es to be an exciting pitching duel in
the first game.
Junior Justin Wayne should get
the ball in the second game for the
Card, while sophomore Brian Sager
will start the series finale on Sunday.
Stanford's lineup is not complete
ly set going into its first series — the
spot that will see the most competi
tion as the year goes on will be sec
ond base, where two players are
fighting it out to replace the graduat
ed Jeff Rizzo. Marquess still hasn't
made up his mind between Scott
Dragicevich and Andy Topham —
either one or both may start this
weekend.
On the other side of the diamond,
postseason hero John Gall will make
his first start at third base for the
Cardinal, where he takes over for
Josh Hochgesang. Gall spent the
past three months working out with
senior starting shortstop Eric
Bruntlett in preparation for the tran
sition, and looks to replicate 'excel
lent defense in his first year at the hot

corner.
"The nice thing about moving to
third my senior year is that it's going
to keep me motivated. It gives me
something new and fresh to concen
trate on." Gall said.
Gall, along with senior center
fielder Edmund Muth and right
fielder Borchard. forms the center of
the Cardinals lineup, a unit that ac
counted for 28 home runs last sea
son.
Marquess will be counting on
leadership from those three, both at
the plate and in the clubhouse.
Outfielder Anthony Acevedo
will lead the charge for Fresno State
against Young and company over
the weekend. Acevedo was the team
MVP last year and also an honorable
mention All-American after topping
the Bulldogs in batting average, hits
and RBIs.
Sophomore second baseman
Tom Creighton, the Western Ath
letic Conference Freshman of the
Year, also provides serious pop in
Fresno State's lineup.
