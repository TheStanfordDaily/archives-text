What?
Stanford wasn't supposed to
lose this game. Rather, the No. 24
Cardinal was supposed to waltz
right into Seattle and grab anoth
er game from the Washington
Huskies (6-13,2-5 Pacific 10 Con
ference). a team that's been
foundering of late despite gutsy
play by junior Megan Franza.

â–  Yesterday: No. 24 Stanford (11-5,
4-2 Pacific 10 Conference) S3, Wash
ington (6-13.2-5) 85

The Cardinal (11-5. 4-2), on

the other hand, brought a four
game winning streak into the
game - and a considerable
amount of momentum after hav
ing beaten California, Oregon
State and Oregon by substantial
margins.
The Huskies had lost eight of
their last nine.
The game started out just fine
for the Cardinal, which had post
ed an 11-point lead by halftime
thanks to a strong performance
by freshman guard Jamie Carey,
who finished the game with 25
points and hit six three-pointers.
However, the Cardinal squan
dered its entire lead in the second
half and eventually trailed 82-76
with 1 minute, 20 seconds left.

Most of Stanford's problem
was the team's inability to control
Franza, who finished the game
with a stellar 33 points. She was
11 of 21 from the field and scored
21 of her points during the
Huskies' resurgence in the sec
ond half.
Before the game, Franza led
the Pac-1() in points per game
with 19.0.
But the Cardinal gave the
Huskies a run for their money in
the last minute, eventually tying
the game at 83 on a pair of clutch
free throws by redshirt freshman
Lindsey Yamasaki with nine sec
onds left.
But on their last possession, the
Huskies were able to get sopho
more guard Julia Gray to the free
throw line with 3.3 seconds remain
ing. She calmly sunk them both to
put the game away for Washington,
85-83.
The Huskies were also boosted
by freshman Loree Payne, who
scored 25 points. Before the game,
Payne was No. 2 in the Pac-10 in
points per game, trailing teammate
Franza by less than two at 17.4.
The Cardinal got a boost from
Yamasaki, who added 16 points.

Freshman Sarah Dimson and ju
nior Carolyn Moos each added 12.
The win was the 500 th career for
the Huskies, who are only the sec
ond team in the conference to
reach the 500-win plateau.
Stanford is the others.
Before last night's game, the
Cardinal had won 11 straight games
in the state of Washington. The
team will get a chance to start an
other State of Washington streak
Saturday when it faces Washington
State (4-13,1-6).
The Cougars got their first con
ference win tonight when they beat
California 72-65.
Stanford has beaten Washing
ton State 28 straight times.
