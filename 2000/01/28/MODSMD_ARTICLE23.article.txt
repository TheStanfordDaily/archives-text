What?
Stanford wasn't supposed to
lose this game. Rather, the No. 24
Cardinal was supposed to waltz
right into Seattle and grab anoth
er game from the Washington
Huskies (6-13,2-5 Pacific 10 Con
ference). a team that's been
foundering of late despite gutsy
play by junior Megan Franza.

â–  Yesterday: No. 24 Stanford (11-5,
4-2 Pacific 10 Conference) S3, Wash
ington (6-13.2-5) 85

The Cardinal (11-5. 4-2), on

the other hand, brought a four
game winning streak into the
game - and a considerable
amount of momentum after hav
ing beaten California, Oregon
State and Oregon by substantial
margins.
The Huskies had lost eight of
their last nine.
The game started out just fine
for the Cardinal, which had post
ed an 11-point lead by halftime
thanks to a strong performance
by freshman guard Jamie Carey,
who finished the game with 25
points and hit six three-pointers.
However, the Cardinal squan
dered its entire lead in the second
half and eventually trailed 82-76
with 1 minute, 20 seconds left.

Most of Stanford's problem
was the team's inability to control
Franza, who finished the game
with a stellar 33 points. She was
11 of 21 from the field and scored
21 of her points during the
Huskies' resurgence in the sec
ond half.
Before the game, Franza led
the Pac-1() in points per game
with 19.0.
But the Cardinal gave the
Huskies a run for their money in
the last minute, eventually tying
the game at 83 on a pair of clutch
free throws by redshirt freshman
Lindsey Yamasaki with nine sec
onds left.
