# Wrestlers try to get back to form
## 
### Matt Long 
The three weeks since return
ing to campus have been a time of
emotional and physical recovery
for Stanford men's wrestling.

WRESTLING
■ Tonight: Stanford (1-3.0-3 Pacific
10 Conference) vs. Oregon State (6-
4,2-1), 7 p.m., Burnham Pavilion
■ Tomorrow: Stanford vs. Portland
State (2-6. 1-3), 7 p.m.. Burnham
Pavilion

It started with the accidental
death of assistant coach Tod Sur
mon on New Year's Day.
But then the Cardinal woes
kept mouning, as the team suf
fered injuries to key starters over
the last couple of weeks.
The team has been confronted
with numerous obstacles — some
more disturbing than others.
But the Cardinal (1-3. 0-3 Pa
cific 10 Conference) hopes that it
can spring back into form this
weekend, and it has two chances
to do so.
First, the team faces Pac-10 ri
vals Oregon State (6-4. 2-1) Fri
day evening. Then, it has a match
against Portland State (2-6. 1-3)
on Saturday.
Last week a depleted Stanford
squad fell to UC-Davis 23-12 at
the team's first dual meet in nine
weeks.
"The meet against Davis was
our first competition in a long
while." said head Coach Chris
Horpel. "We were stale and just
didn't wrestle well. We are con
sidering it a tuneup for the sea
son."
Although the team remains in
anything but perfect health, the
Cardinal plans to get a boost
when nationally ranked senior
Rudy Ruiz returns to the mat to
wrestle in the 125-pound weight
class.
"Just about every starter is in
jured with the exception of War
ren Mcpherson." says Horpel.
"But we still should have our
lineup intact."
The Cardinal is also looking
forward to the emergence of
sophomore heavyweight Brad
Selbv. who Horpel described as

the team's "secret weapon." Fri
day will be Selby's first collegiate
wrestling match ever.
Selbv is fresh out of the Rose
Bowl, where he played left guard
for Stanford's gridders. He tops
the scales at the heavyweight
maximum of 2cS5 pounds, and is
excited to get back on the mat. as
this will be his first competition
since high school.
"I have been working for the
last two weeks," Selby said. "I
want to go out and be physical,
put some attitude into it and
come out victorious, if not by
technique then by good old-fash
ioned hard work."
Selby will have the opportuni
ty to gauge his position in the
Pac-10 against fellow sophomore
and Oregon State star Jason
Cooley, currently ranked No. 1 in
the conference.
Oregon State should provide
Stanford with one of its biggest
challenges of the season, as the
Beavers are ranked 20th in the
national coaches poll and are one
of the front runners for the Pac
-10 title.
"We have a difficult four
weeks leading up to the Pac-10
championships," Horpel said.
"We have to be ready, and by the
looks of the last couple days in
practice, we are."
The most interesting match of
the weekend will be at 133
pounds between Stanford's se
nior captain Zach Zimmerer,
ranked 13th. and Oregon State's
20th-ranked Ben Richards. Last
season the two split 1-1 with
Richards winning in dual match
but Zimmerer eliminating
Richards in the Pac-10 semifi
nals. Unfortunately for the Car
dinal. Zimmerer has multiple in
juries and will not be at full
strength Friday evening.
The Portland State Vikings,
on the other hand, should pro
vide an easier matchup for Stan
ford.
"We should beat Portland
State."says Horpel. "We've
beaten them handily in the past,
but then again wrestling is a sport
where you never know for sure."
Both Friday's and Saturday's
meets will begin at 7 p.m. in the
Ford Center.

Saturday, Stanford wrestling will get a boost from the addition of
