# It's Husky Pie in Maples
## Card trounces helpless UW 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Any thoughts of a letdown from
Stanford last night were answered
early on at Maples Pavilion.
In customary Cardinal fashion,
second-ranked Stanford fell be
hind early to Washington. But the
Huskies' fragile 6-2 lead was soon
smashed to pieces by a juggernaut
running at full force.

■ Yesterday: No. 2 Stanford (16-1.
5-1) 92, Washington (6-13, 1-6) 62

Six Stanford players scored in
the next five and a-halt minutes as
the Cardinal, fueled by ferocious
offensive rebounding and an un
characteristically effective transi
tion game, went on a 23-2 run to
blow the Pacific 10 Conference
game wide open.
With that 25-8 lead in hand, the
Cardinal (16-1, 5-1 Pac-10) pro
ceeded to cruise to a high-flying,
crowd-pleasing 92-62 victory over
Washington (6-13,1-6).
With first-place (JSC's 68-67
loss at Oregon last night, the Cardi
nal moved into a tie with the Tro
jans (12-6.5-1) and the Ducks (14-
3, 5-1) behind Arizona (17-3, 6-1)
in the conference race.
"1 don't like to cry wolf," said
Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery, who publicly warned his
players not to overlook the
Huskies. "But they're a good team.
We just got them back on their
heels and played great defense."
