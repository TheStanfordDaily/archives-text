# It's Husky Pie in Maples
## Card trounces helpless UW 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Any thoughts of a letdown from
Stanford last night were answered
early on at Maples Pavilion.
In customary Cardinal fashion,
second-ranked Stanford fell be
hind early to Washington. But the
Huskies' fragile 6-2 lead was soon
smashed to pieces by a juggernaut
running at full force.

■ Yesterday: No. 2 Stanford (16-1.
5-1) 92, Washington (6-13, 1-6) 62

Six Stanford players scored in
the next five and a-halt minutes as
the Cardinal, fueled by ferocious
offensive rebounding and an un
characteristically effective transi
tion game, went on a 23-2 run to
blow the Pacific 10 Conference
game wide open.
With that 25-8 lead in hand, the
Cardinal (16-1, 5-1 Pac-10) pro
ceeded to cruise to a high-flying,
crowd-pleasing 92-62 victory over
Washington (6-13,1-6).
With first-place (JSC's 68-67
loss at Oregon last night, the Cardi
nal moved into a tie with the Tro
jans (12-6.5-1) and the Ducks (14-
3, 5-1) behind Arizona (17-3, 6-1)
in the conference race.
"1 don't like to cry wolf," said
Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery, who publicly warned his
players not to overlook the
Huskies. "But they're a good team.
We just got them back on their
heels and played great defense."
The only real questions last

night were whether Stanford would
reach 100 points and if walk-on
crowd favorite Alex Gelbard would
score. Much to the frustrated senior
guard's chagrin, neither happened.
But the Cardinal had more than
enough to be happy about.
Stanford's game-deciding run in
the first half showcased the Cardi
nal's all-around game. A few threes
from freshman Casey Jacobscn and
senior David Moselev, a tip-in from
point guard Mike McDonald, a few
layups for the Collins twins and a
fastbreak bucket or two were enough
to put the game far out of reach.
But what really allowed Stanford
to stake its early advantage was its sti
lling defense. The Cardinal, which
leads the conference in opponents'
scoring and defensive field-goal per

centage, held Washington to only 32
percent shooting in the first half.
And Stanford, which also leads
the Pac-10 in rebounding, outboard
ed the Huskies 24-13. Washington
actually had as many fouls as they
had rebounds, 13. in the half.
"We played very well today both
on offense and defense," said Mad
sen. who had IS points and nine re
bounds. "To have the depth we have
depth that's playing well — is a
huge positive for us."
That's an understatement.
As Washington watched the lead
continue to grow, Stanford was able
to get every one of its 13 players into
the game, 10 of whom scored.
"Their depth wears on you," said
Washington head coach Bob Ben
der. " That will be a factor in every
one of their games. They wear you
out inside."
While the Cardinal did have a
strong inside-outside game working.

its inside foursome truly controlled
the action against the undersized
Huskies.
Adding to Madsen's fine totals,
redshirt freshman Jason Collins
posted 17 points and seven rebounds
in only 15 minutes of action, junior
Jarron Collins notched a strong nine
points himself, and freshman Curtis
Borchardt pulled down a career
high eight rebounds. Borchardt, a
Washington native who is second in
the conference in blocks, also used
his long arms to swat away three
shots.
Jason seemed particularly at ease
on the court, hitting 5 of 6 shots from
the field and 7 of 8 from the line.
"I'm in a rhythm right now," he
said. As a unit, the big men "really do
a good job of working together. We
like playing with each other and we
have good chemistry."
That chemistry, especially that
which exists between two identical

twins, was especially noticeable dur
ing the Cardinal's prolific first-half
spurt.
After Jason's defender doubled
teamed Jarron to stop his drive
through the lane. Jarron wrapped a
nifty bounce pass around both
I luskies to a waiting Jason. Having
received many passes like that from
Jarron before, he didn't hesitate,
slamming down a forceful dunk to
put an authoritative exclamation
mark on the rout.
"I knew he was going to pass it to
me." Jason said. ' 1 was just waiting
for it."
Now Stanford gets to sit around
and wait too, licking its chops for an
other potential laugher Saturday
against Washington State.
Last night at Berkeley, California
killed the Cougars 80-46. If the Car
dinal's performance against Wash
ington was any indication, the score
could be even uglier Saturday.
