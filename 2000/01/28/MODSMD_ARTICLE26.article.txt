No. I UCLA last week, one might think that
it is time for the No. 13 Stanford men's vol
leyball team to get a break. But when the
team travels south this weekend, the trip will
be anything but that.

MEW'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Tonight: No. 13 Stanford (2-2. 2-2 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) at No. 2 Long Beach
State (1 -0.3-1), 7:30 p.m.
■ Tomorrow: Stanford at No. 5 Southern Cali
fornia (2-0.4-1). 7 p.m.

Tonight the Cardinal (2-2, 2-2 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) will challenge No.
2 Long Beach State (5-1. 3-1) in its first con
ference match away from Maples. The squad
will then plav No. 5 USC(B-1.4-l) tomorrow.
Arguably the best team in the country.
Long Beach State beat UCLA in three games
during a fall exhibition matchup a few
months ago. I'he 49ers lost their preseason

No. I ranking at the start of the season, how
ever. alter falling to the Bruins at the Wvnd
ham Garden West Coast Challenge at UC-
Irvine in a tight five-game match.
It's no surprise that, save UCLA. Long
Beach State has breezed through the rest of
its games with little trouble maintaining its
No. 2 spot. The squad returns all six of its
starters from last year's NCAA runner-up
team.
Included in the returnees are three All-
Americans: senior setter Chris Seiffert. ju
nior outside hitter David McKienzie, and ju
nior middle blocker Matt Prosser.
McKienzie. called a "hitting machine" by
Stanford head coach Ruben Nieves, brings
with him his NCAA Division I record in kills
in one match with 58. McKienzie set the
record in Long Beach State's 3-2 victory over
BYU in regular season play last year. This
season. McKienzie has already posted 114
kills in Ift games.
With the extensive depth and experience
lound on the Long Beach State squad,
tonight's match will be a tough test for the
young Cardinal.

Junior setter Josh Lukens and the rest of the No.
13 Cardinal will get a test tonight when the team
faces No. 2 Long Beach State in Long Beach,
Calif.
"They're the deepest team in
the country," Nieves said. "1
wouldn't want to face their second
team either. They're probably 12
deep with good quality players. It's
a tough team to create a game plan
for because they have so many
weapons."
The 49ers dropped only one
game to the Cardinal last season
with a 3-0 victory at home and a 3-
1 victory at Stanford. For a better
result tonight, the Cardinal will
have to step up its level of play.
"No one stops Long Beach's of
fense because they're so versatile,"
Nieves said. "We'll have to contain
their offense to beat them. We'll
have to match them side-out for
side-out."
On Saturday, the Cardinal
moves from 1900-seat gymnasium
at Long Beach State to the smallest
gymnasium in the conference at
USC. While it may be a big step
down in gym size, the step down in
competition will not be as large.
The Trojans return five of their
starters from last year's squad that
upset No. 4 Pepperdine and No. 2
Long Beach State before losing to
No. 1 BYU in the final of the

MPSF tournament.
Senior captain Donald Suxho
returns in his fourth year as start
ing setter for the Trojans. Suxho
currently leads the team in aces
with 17 and in assists with 405. Ear
lier this season, he was named to
the All-Tournament team at the
UC-Santa Barbara Collegiate Invi
tational along with sophomore
middle blocker Beau Rawi and
Stanford junior setter Josh
Lukens.
Leading the team in kills is
sophomore outside hitter Brook
Billings, who has posted 153 kills
this season. Last season Billings
was named the Asics / Volleyball
National Co-Freshman of the Year
and the MPSF Freshman of the
Year.
USC will be another tough test
for the Cardinal, but for a team in a
conference that boasts 10 of the
top 15 teams, it's a test that the
squad is v Jed to.
"We're coming off a good per
formance at home," Nieves said.
"The season is full of challenges
and stepping stones and that is cer
tainly the case this weekend. If we
focus on the process, we have the
opportunity for good results. Win
or lose, we want to leave the floor
feeling good about our effort and
our performance."'
