months ago. I'he 49ers lost their preseason

No. I ranking at the start of the season, how
ever. alter falling to the Bruins at the Wvnd
ham Garden West Coast Challenge at UC-
Irvine in a tight five-game match.
It's no surprise that, save UCLA. Long
Beach State has breezed through the rest of
its games with little trouble maintaining its
No. 2 spot. The squad returns all six of its
starters from last year's NCAA runner-up
team.
Included in the returnees are three All-
Americans: senior setter Chris Seiffert. ju
nior outside hitter David McKienzie, and ju
nior middle blocker Matt Prosser.
McKienzie. called a "hitting machine" by
Stanford head coach Ruben Nieves, brings
with him his NCAA Division I record in kills
in one match with 58. McKienzie set the
record in Long Beach State's 3-2 victory over
BYU in regular season play last year. This
season. McKienzie has already posted 114
kills in Ift games.
With the extensive depth and experience
lound on the Long Beach State squad,
tonight's match will be a tough test for the
young Cardinal.
