Burnham Pavilion.

MEN S GYMNASTICS
■ Saturday: No. 15 Stanford (I -2, I-2
Mountain Pacific Sports federation)
hosts No. 20 UC'-Santa Barbara (0-3.
0-3) and No. <s (California (4-0.4-0) at
the ('ordinal ()pen Tournament.

The 15th-ranked Cardinal (I -2,1 -
2 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) will lace 20th-ranked UC-
Santa Barbara (0-3, 0-3) and No. S
California (4-0, 4-0) in the team's
second home competition.
I very year the Cardinal Open at
tracts some of the top gymnasts in
the country. And this year will be no
different, with several National
team members scheduled to com

pete.
"This is a pretty big meet, so
we're hoping for a lot of support
from the home crowd," said junior
co-captain Rico Andrade.
The home-court advantage could
be exactly what this Cardinal team
needs to overcome its Bay Area ri
vals. For two consecutive weekends,
the Bears have won decisive victo
ries over the Cardinal en route to an
undefeated record.
Despite the recent losses, Stan
ford is not focused on beating Cal
this weekend. Its main goal is to im
prove routine execution and elimi
nate major errors in competition.
"We continued to improve in our
practices this week. Now we have to
begin competing at the level we are
capable of," said senior Ail-Ameri
can Jason Katsampes. "I think we
should start seeing more hit routines
in these upcoming competitions as
the team begins to feel more com
fortable in front of the judges."
Yet the season is still young. That

means that one of Stanford's most
important goals for this weekend's
meet is to gain additional competi
tion experience that the team can
draw upon as the season continues.
"I was nervous my for my first
home meet [last weekend|," said
freshman Marshall Erwin. "I won
dered. 'What if I fall and it sets a
trend for the next four years?' For
tunately, things went well."
Stanford head coach Sadao
Hamada is still pleased with his team
and sees great potential.
"I see a lot of improvement, but
it's just a matter of time until my
guys start hitting their routines in
competition." Hamada said.
Despite a grueling two-a-day
workout schedule, the team trained
very hard this week and made signil
icant improvements.
"The team is doing well," Erwin
said. "1 can see everyone getting a
little better every day."
The current training regimen has
taken its toll on many Cardinal gym

nasts. Alter two weeks of early
morning practices, extra condition
ing and countless routines, some
gymnasts have developed minor in
juries.
"The team is working so hard
that some of the guys are getting run
down," Erwin said. "I think it we
push through the next few weeks
and then get some rest, we'll do
great."
Even Hamada concedes that his
team is worn out.
"The guys are a little tired right
now," he said.
Hamada, however, still believes
in his plan and fully expects his team
to rise in the rankings as the season
progresses.
Stanford will do its best to close
the gap with Cal this weekend, but
I iamada concedes that "it might still
be a little early."
Regardless of this weekend's out
come. Stanford will remain focused
on its ultimate goal: winning the
NCAA team title in April.
