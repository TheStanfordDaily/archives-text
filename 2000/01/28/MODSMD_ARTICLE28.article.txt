WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ Tonight: No. lOStanford vs. No. 2(1
Washington, 7:30 p.m., Burnham
Pavilion

The Cardinal is coming off a
successful meet against Arizona
and is hoping to carry that mo
mentum into tonight's competi
tion.
The Cardinal will be tough. Se
nior Ail-American Larissa
Fontaine looks to rebound from
chronic injuries and re-enter the
all-around competition. Also
leading the Cardinal will be the
all-around performances of junior
star Jennifer Exaltacion, sopho
more standout Katy Herbert and
freshman sensation Abby Clair.
"It's great that we can have a
nice mix of event specialists and
all-around performers — it adds a
unique challenge for our oppo
nents," Exaltacion said.
The vault will be led by the per
formances of Exaltacion, fresh
man Alissa Cooper, and Gair. But
Fontaine may very well steal the
show. The 1998 NCAA vault
champion is currently leading the
Pacific 10 Conference in the vault.
"I feel very good about my
vault right now," Fontaine said.
The Cardinal is also looking to
build on its spectacular uneven
bar performance last week where
every performer posted a 9.7 or
better. The backbone of the line
up will consist of the strong and
difficulty packed performances of
Exaltacion, Herbert and sopho
more All-American Kristin
Jensen. Big scores are expected
out of Cooper and Clair, who have
both led the team in previous
competitions.
The story of the bar rotation,
however, will be the re-emer
gence of Fontaine to the bar line
up. Last season the senior was
sidelined when she shattered her

finger in warmups for competi
tion against California. Fontaine
is an internationally renowned
bar worker who even has a dis
mount named after her in the
Code of Points.
"I am extremely excited to be
doing bars again," Fontaine said.
The Cardinal looks to rebound
from a disappointing perfor
mance on beam last week and has
been focusing on consistency on
the event in training.
The Cardinal will again de
pend on the steady performances
of sophomore Becky Meldrum.
Clair, and Fontaine. Freshman
Kelsey Stillinger, Herbert and
Exaltacion all have the ability to
break a 9.9 if they hit their rou
tines.
Floor exercise is the deepest
event for the Cardinal and it is
time for the floor lineup to shine.
According to senior All-Ameri
can Sarah Harding, past meets
have been "a little flat" on floor.
The Cardinal hopes to keep up its
momentum well into the last
event.
Harding will be leading the at
tack on floor. The senior is hoping
to put forth another 'perfect 10'
routine. Harding will be joined by
Exaltacion, Fontaine, Gair. Her
bert and Jensen. Exaltacion has
altered her tumbling passes and
should challenge Harding for the
floor title. Jensen's difficult tum
bling will also make her a per
former to watch.
The Huskies will be led by All-
Americans Tiffany Simpson,
Lanna Apisukh and Lauren
Riesenman. The squad will be a
strong opponent.
"They should be a good com
petition for us," said assistant
coach Rene Lyst Cook.
The Cardinal is difficult to
beat at home and is doing better
than expected this early in the
season.
"I'm proud of how our team is
doing and I'm confident we're
going to get better and better,"
Harding said.
"We've got a long way to go
before Regionals and Nationals
but for now we're looking good,"
she said.
