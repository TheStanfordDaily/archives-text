# Student group scrutinizes practices of corporations that recruit at Stanford
## 
### Susan Cameron 
During college, many students
have high hopes of making the world
a better place. However, as they find
themselves getting trampled at ca
reer fairs and overwhelmed by the
pressure to make money, it is easy to
lose sight of original ideals.
Senior Ned Tozun, founder of a
new student group. Students for In
formed Career Decisions, said he
believes students do not have to sur
render their aspirations of social re
sponsibility when they enter the
work force.
SICD hopes to provide students
with ready information about the
labor, human rights and environ
mental practices of major corpora
tions that recruit at Stanford by pro
filing them. Tozun said.
Tozun explained that the 59 com
panies being profiled are a "random
sampling that will grow and change
as we find out more clearly who are
the big recruiters and which would
be most helpful to have information
on for students."
In effect, no company has been
singled out as a "bad guy." Tozun
said. He emphasized that SICD's
aim is to provide objective informa
tion that gives both sides of any con
troversy.
The mission of SICD is not with
out its own bit of controversy. Some
University officials worry that high
lighting negative information about
companies will cause them to cease
coming to campus, or will at least
discourage them from hiring Stan
ford students.
There have already been some
objections raised by corporations
whose social dealings have been
questioned in the past, said Robert
Thirsk. director of the Career Devel

opment Center.
In fact, tobacco giant Philip Mor
ris canceled scheduled interviews
with students last November after
students organized a protest to in
form the campus of what they allege
to be unethical marketing policies.
At the time, Tozun told The
Daily, "Philip Morris actually can
celed their interviews today when
they heard there might be a protest.
I guess they wanted to avoid the bad
publicity."
Another factor is that many of
these corporations are donors to the
University, and portraying them in a
negative manner could jeopardize
their contributions, according to
Thirsk.
Tozun responded to these con
cerns by insisting that "our goal isn't
to attack recruiters, but simply to
make as much information available
to students as possible."
According to SICD's Web page,
if certain companies' responses toal
legations appear transparent, that is
because they are weak arguments
when compared to those raised by
human rights and envi;onmental
groups.
T hirsk said "the CDC is not a po
litical institution. Our job is to facili
tate meetings between employers
and students, and then let students
make their own decisions."
Thirsk, nonetheless, said he em
braces SICD's goals, lie believes
that "as long as students have a pas
sion about these issues, SICD will
have positive effects in the long
run."
1 he CDC' is considering I hree op
tions for disseminating the informa
tion gathered by SICD: posting fliers
at the CDC, compiling a binder of
these fliers or posting them on the
SICD Web site, http://www.stan

ford.edu/group/SICD.
There is very little support in the
CDC for the first option, and CDC
administrators are almost evenly
split on the second, Thirsk said.
Most likely, the CDC is going to
set up a "Social Responsibility" shelf
that will contain published directo
ries regarding the social practices of
companies. On that shelf, as an addi
tional resource, the CDC will pro
vide the address of the SICD Web
site.
Thirsk said he believes this will
"be the most workable option be
cause it creates the least amount of
contention between the University
and the employers."
Even if students do eventually
decide to work for companies with
unsavory labor or environmental
practices, Tozun said he believes
they "may help change some of
these policies from the inside, if they
are well informed."
Patricia Svilik, one of the heads of
Eco Advising, a campus group that
promotes environmental awareness
among students, expressed support
of the program because it "lets em
ployers know that we care about
these important issues, and that we
want to see a positive change."
SICD's goal for this year is to
complete the fact sheets for the cho
sen companies. Next year the group
hopes to convince other universities
to use their resources as well, ac
cording to Tozun.
Tozun maintained "that as peo
ple lucky enough to have gotten such
a good education, we really have a
responsibility to make sure that we
use our education to do something
that has a positive impact on the
world, and, at the very least, we need
to be sure that we don't have a nega
tive impact."
