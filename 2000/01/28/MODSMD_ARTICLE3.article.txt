# Dish signals' source to be determined by next week
## 
### Meredith Rowe Editorial staff 
Scientists working at Stanford
and at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena. Calif.,
will not know until next week
whether faint radio signals being
picked up by the Dish are coming
from the missing $165-million
Mars Polar Lander.
The news was announced yes
terday at a media event with re
searchers from Stanford, NASA's
JPL and SRI International at the
Dish.
Initially, NASA and Stanford
officials said it might only take a
day or two of analysis in order to
determine the signals' origin.
According to Dawn Levy of
Stanford News Service, however,
the researchers have not yet fin
ished examining all of the data.
"Scientists have only looked at
one of the three data sets," she
said. "And they haven't detected
any unusual signals.
"They'll know next week if they
find something and if so the JPL
will make an announcement."
NASA scientists renewed their
Effort this week to locate the lost
lander, which has been missing
since Dec. 3.
On that date, faint signals were
reportedly picked up by the Dish,
one of the country's largest radio /
radar telescopes.
These signals were transmitted
on Dec. IS and Jan. 4.
On Wednesday, NASA scien
tists radioed three new sets of sig
nals, attempting to prompt a re
sponse signal from the lander.
Ivan Linscott. a senior research
associate at Stanford's Space
Telecommunications and Radio
Science Laboratory, said the De
cember and early January signals
had a frequency and a pitch similar
to the lander's radio patterns.
However, scientists have said it
is unlikely the signals actually orig
inated from the Mars lander.
For example, it is possible that
the signals may have come from
local UHF television stations or
other interference.

"I think it's not going to hap
pen." said Mary Hardin, a spokes
woman at JPL, in a New York
Times interview Wednesday. "It's
an extremely long shot â€” that's
what I'm getting from the team."
Levy said the sound is so faint
that it's hard to even detect.
"The strength of the signal is
about that of trying to get a cell
phone signal from Mars," she said.
If scientists do receive confir
mation that the signals came from
Mars, there is still little hope for
the Polar Lander mission, said G.
Leonard Tyler, former director of
the STAR Lab and the leader of
STAR's Mars Global Surveyor
project, in a Daily article that ran
yesterday.
Confirmation will simply mean
that the lander has been found, and
chances are nil that it will ever be
able to complete its original goal of
finding water ice on the red planet,
according to a San Francisco
Chronicle interview with Sam
Thurman, the Polar Lander's flight
director.
However, if the location of the
lander is established, scientists will
probably be able to determine
what caused the mission to turn
sour.
The potential loss of the Mars
polar lander is just the latest in a
string of NASA upsets.
Last year, two Mars craft were
lost: an orbiter in September and
another lander in December.
Additionally, scientists and re
searchers studying the failures
have said the first of six Mars
probes scheduled to be launched
every two years beginning in 2001
may be delayed.
For now, the wait to learn about
the signals received by the Dish is
agonizing for some of the NASA
scientists, said John Callas, a re
search scientist at the JPL who
spoke during yesterday's media
event.
"For those that have been work
ing on this project, it's like a loved
one missing in action," he said.
"Any report of a sighting and
your hopes are raised. It's a little
tough," he added.
