## 
### Ben Freda Editorial staff 
For the Stanford softball team,
the questions begin to he answered
Saturday afternoon at the Stanford
Softball Complex.

SOFTBALL
■Tomorrow: No. 21 Stanford vs. San
Francisco State, noon, Stanford Soft
ball Complex

That's because the No. 21 Cardi
nal — a relatively youthful team im
bued with seven freshmen — kicks
off the season with a doubleheader
against San Francisco State tomor
row.
How will the new players hold
up? Only Saturday's game will tell.

Even with a young roster, the
Cardinal still has an experienced
squad. The team returns nine play
ers, including four starters, from last
year's team — a team that went 40-
25 and advanced to the NCAA play
offs for the second consecutive sea
son.
The team's Pacific 10 Conference
record, however, was 10-IS — which
speaks to the overvv helming strength
of the division in softball. something
that will likely be true again this sea
son.
The team was beaten by an un
ranked Pacific team in a tight 6-5
game in the first matchup of the
NCAA tournament, then eliminated
after losing to No. 3 Fresno State 5-2.
The Cardinal will especially be
looking to sophomore center fielder

Jessica Mendoza.a first-team NFC A
All-American last season, and senior
catcher Kellie Wiginton, a second
team All-American.
Hut the team will miss its two pre
mier pitchers — Becky Blevins and
Marey CTouch — that it lost to grad
uation. Together, the pair threw 99
percent of Stanford's innings last
year.
The Cardinal was able to acquire
pitching phenom Maureen LeCocq,
however, who will start on Saturday.
LeCocq. a freshman, was the
Gatorade National High School
Player of the Year in 1999.
Saturday, the Cardinal will he fac
ing a San Francisco State team that
has even less to boast about this year.
Last season, the team finished a
miserable 10-45.
