# Ruggers face Arizona test
## First good team all year for Card 
### Jon Cohen Contributing writer 
So far this season, the Cardinal
is undefeated.
But is that because the Cardinal
is good? Or because its opponents
are bad?
The Stanford men's rugby team
(4-0. 1-0 Pacific Coast League) has
cruised through its early season
schedule, winning its first four
games by an average of 35 points.

■ Tomorrow: Stanford vs. Arizona, 6
p.m.. New Maloney Field

While these blowouts no doubt
reflect the excellent play of the
Cardinal in recent weeks, they
also reflect the mediocre quality
of opponents the squad haSfaced.
That will nil change Saturday
when it plays its last nonconfer
ence game before league play re
sumes next week, a 6 p.m. show
down against Arizona at New
Maloney Field.
The Wildcats have yet to play a
game in the winter season (they
have a tuneup scheduled for Fri
day against UC-San Diego), but
the team is already ranked in the
top six.
This is due to the squad's re
markable success last season,
when Arizona won the SoCal
Conference championship. The
team went 10-2 in the regular sea
son before losing in the Sweet Six
teen round of the national tourna
ment.
Nine seniors return from last
year's team, whose victories in
cluded a 32-10 pounding of the
Cardinal.
But now Stanford seems like it
has been put back together and
looked fully loaded in recent vie

lories over St. Mary's and UC-Sao
Diego.
Against St. Mary's two weeks
ago, the Cardinal's offense looked
almost unstoppable, blowing the
Gaels off the field with its dynam
ic brand of rugby en route to a 55-
«X victory.
Saturday in San Diego, Calif.,
Stanford's offense was not flowing
quite as smoothly, but the team's
defense more than made up lot it.
stilling every Titan push in a 31 }
victory.
Still, these wins were ovct tip
ponents who lacked Arizona's
stellar credentials. This weekend's
game should give the team a
glimpse of where it stands at this
point in the season.
"The last 10 years besides last
year we were always ranked in the
top six in the nation," head coach

I ranck Boivert said. "Arizona is
in the top six now. so it'll be a test
to see if we belong in the top four
or five in the nation."
I hc players certainly feel that
they have the talent and competi
tiveness to plav at that level, but it
remains to be seen whether the
team can put everything together
in the same game.
"II we can combine the offense
from the St. Mary's game with the
defense from UC'SD," senior cap
tain Mike Ceballos said, "we'll be
an impenetrable fortress, an un
beatable team."
I he Cardinal is hoping that this
is the team that will show up Sat
urday evening. And if it does, it
seems certain that it will give the
kind of performance that will
thrust Stanford rugby back into
the national spotlight.
