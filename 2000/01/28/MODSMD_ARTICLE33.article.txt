The Cardinal defeated both No.
2 Arizona and No. I<S Arizona
State in dual meets last weekend.
The team hopes to continue its cur
rent four-meet winning streak.
The team has a long and glori
ous past. In addition to having won
11 Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships in a row. Stanford has also
placed in the top three at the
NCAA championships for the past
eight years.
Last year. Stanford placed third
at the NCAA championships. De
spite the tough competition and the
pressure to maintain Stanford's
swimming reputation, the 12-
woman traveling squad is up for the
challenge.
"The team is really bonded right
now," said sophomore Shelly Rip
ple. "We have a great deal of ener

gy and team spirit, and I think it will
take us to new lengths this season."
The two meets this weekend will
by no means he an easy ride. Head
coach Richard Quick is preparing
the team for a couple of tough, very
competitive meets.
"Though Arizona beat both
USC and UCLA two weeks ago
and we beat Arizona, we arc not
heading into these meets expecting
an easy victory," he said. "We don't
match up as well against USC on an
individual basis, so the meet could
come down to the last race. We
need to have everyone on the team
to be running on all cylinders."
The meet against (JSC tomor
row will mark yet another chapter
in the long-standing rivalry be
tween the Cardinal and the Trojan
swimmers.
USC has long been a swimming
powerhouse, and the rivalry be
tween the two teams is fierce. In
1997. USC destroyed Stanford's
four-year NCAA championship
streak by winning the NCAA title.
Last year, the squad finished in a
close second to Stanford at the Pac
-10 Championships and placed sixth
at NCAAs.
"I can't wait to get in the water
and show SC what we can do," Rip
ple said. "They are ranked fourth
in the nation, and we are going to
show them that our team is a strong

as it has ever been. It's going to be
a tough meet, but it will be a great
chance to come together as a team
and swim our hearts out."
Though the rivalry between
UCLA and Stanford is less fierce,
12th-ranked UCLA is another
strong swimming school.
"I don't know what they've
done this year, but I think they are
pretty good," said junior Misty
Hyman. "We definitely aren't
going to go into the meet thinking
that they are an easy team to beat.
"Both of these meets will give
us good practice in competition
and will help prepare us for Pac
10s and NCAAs," she said. "I'm
looking forward to getting out
there and racing."
The USC and UCLA swimmers
are a force to be reckoned with,
but the two meets will be particu
larly competitive for Stanford's
divers.
Junior Erin Sones feels the
pressure going into this weekend.
"USC has a fabulous diving
team." she said. "They have a new
coach this year, and will be pretty
tough to beat. UCLA is weaker
than we are, but could beat us on
any given day. This is a big week
end for the divers. It will be a good
way to gauge the other Pac-10
divers, and to see where our team
stands in relation to them."
