# For Card, depth is name of game
## 
### Jim Tankersley Senior staff writer 
For a minute — two and a halt', ac
tually — it looked like Deon Luton
might give No. 2 Stanford a game.
The senior guard hit his first two
shots, a three-pointer from the cor
ner and a 16-footer. to stake Wash
ington to an early 6-2 lead. But Car
dinal senior David Moseley an
swered with a three-pointer of his
own. and Luton picked up two quick
fouls to leave the game with 17:27 to
go in the first half, his team down 7-6.
He came back three minutes later,
but the damage was done. Stanford
was up 19-8. and Luton was suddenly
cold from the field. He missed his
next five shots and wouldn't be a fac
tor the rest of the way, finishing with
13 points on 5-of-12 shooting.
A Stanford guard, point man
Michael McDonald, also ran into
early foul trouble. Less than five min
utes into the game, he earned his sec
ond personal and went to the bench

for the rest of the half.
But instead of struggling in his ab
sence. the Cardinal surged. Backup
point guards Tony Giovacchini and
Julius Barnes kept the team running
— literally — as Stanford surged to a
51-25 halftime lead.
Their numbers weren't spectacu
lar. Giovacchini- finished with 3
points and three assists, Barnes with
no points and two assists. But the
sophomore and the freshman com
bined for only one turnover in a col
lective 34 minutes of play and earned
the praise of head coach Mike Mont
gomery.
"1 thought Tony did very well
going in." Montgomery said, "and
Julius did well in the first half in par
ticular."
Of course, it's easy to look good
flanked by sharpshooters David
Moseley and Casey Jacobsen, who
hit a combined 7 of 9 three-pointers
in the game, and when your big men
tower over a small Washington team,
controlling the boards to the tune of

25 offensive rebounds and a 44-2K
overall rebounding advantage in the
game.
But don't think for a second that
Giovacchini and Barnes weren't
keys to Stanford's 92-62 Husky
thrashing. The pair did just what it
was asked, controlling the tempo o!
the game and setting up the Cardi
nal's hot shooters inside and out with
solid passes.
Their performance, along with
Jason Collins' 17 points and Curtis
Brochardt's eight rebounds and
three blocked shots, highlights the
fundamental difference between
Stanford and Washington — and
perhaps the entire Pacific 10 Confer
ence.
Depth.
"It wears on you." to play against
such a deep team," Washington
head coach Bob Bender said, partic
ularly in the paint.
"We're playing pretty good post
defense at times." he said, "but then
by concentrating so much on help-

ing in there, it leaves somebody
open for an offensive rebound. 1 just
don t think there are teams that can
handle that."
Bender was rightfully upset that
Stanford's starters ran his team out
of the game before the midway
point of the first half. But what had
to sting more was the Cardinal's sec
ond unit, extending the lead late in
the second with Washington's best
team still on the floor.
"We got great contributions
from the entire team," Stanford se
nior forward Mark Madsen said.
"To have the depth that we have,
playing well, is a huge positive for
us."
Late in the game, with a win safe
ly in hand and a little less than five
minutes to go, Montgomery emp
tied his bench. Joining Giovacchini
and freshmen Borchardt. Joe Kir
choffer and Kyle Logan on the court
was senior walk-on Alex Gelbard.
Thirty seconds later. Deon Luton
finally sat down for good.
