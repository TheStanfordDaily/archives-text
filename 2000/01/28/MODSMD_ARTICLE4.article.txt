## 
### Dennis Tyler 
The Black Community Services
and El Centro Chicano held an in
formal panel on Proposition 21,
"The Gang Violence and Juvenile
Crime Prevention Act," last night
in the Old Union Ballroom.
Proposition 21. proposed by for
mer California Governor Pete Wil
son, would require youths ages 14
and older to be subject to the same
punishments as adults. The bill
would extend the age bracket in
which life sentences and the death
penalty could be applied.
The Proposition will appear on
the ballot during the California Pri
mary on March 7.
This initiative has created many
concerns within the Stanford com
munity.
"What is so pernicious about
this crime bill is that it signals to
youth that there is no hope for
■ them because the new bill does not
allow for rehabilitation," said ju
nior Tiana Murillo, a member of
Stanford Advocates for Children.
"It was also very sneaky of Wil
son's camp to place the ballot dur

ing the primary, the time when
more conservative and wealthy
people vote, and not when minori
ties usually vote, even though the
hill will harm them." said junior
Alicia Johnson.
Because of the controversial na
ture of the initiative, the Stanford
Democrats, Black Student Union.
MFChA, El Centro Chicano and
Black Community Services Center
are joining together to push for a
voter registration drive.
The registration drive, which
began Jan. 24, will end Feb. 7, the
last day to register to vote for
Propositions 21 and 22. The Knight
Initiative that would ban same-sex
marriages.
Representatives of the Stanford
Democrats, the BSU and MFChA
will lead the registration drive, vis
iting house meetings next week and
placing fliers under students'
doors.
Additionally. KZSIJ plans to
publicize the drive on the air to ed
ucate Stanford students about the
effects of Wilson's proposal.
"Unfortunately, those most im
pacted by Prop. 21 would be lower

class, urban youth, who tend to be
minority teens. Parallel to that.
Prop. 22 would prevent same-sex
eouples from getting married,
which would be the first step in a
social rejection of the queer com
munity. Both Prop. 21 and 22 are
very deceiving — while they hide
behind seemingly safe wording,
they would affect similar communi
ties in devastating ways." said
sophomore Alvaro Arce. a volun
teer coordinator for the Lesbian.
Ciay, and Bisexual Community
Center.
Additionally. Stanford Advo
cates for Children is circulating a
petition to discontinue Pete Wil
son's status as a I loover Fellow be
cause of his support of Proposition
21.
"After doing such an injustice to
youth, his presence should no
longer be tolerated on this cam
pus." Murillo said. "Furthermore,
his behavior does not represent
what this University stands for."
On Feb. 3. Stanford students
and local high school students plan
to demonstrate against Proposition
21 in a Youth Action rally.
