# Forum explores effects of growth

### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Staff writer 
Silicon Valley may be the envy
of the nation for its economic
growth, but as one public policy
class is learning, that growth does
not come without challenges.
Last night, students in Policy
Making and Problem-Solving at the
Local and Regional Level and com
munity members attended a panel
discussion exploring the effects of
economic development and public
policy on land use and transporta
tion issues in Silicon Valley.
The program was sponsored by
the Stanford in Silicon Valley pro
ject and was co-sponsored by Stan
ford in Government, the Haas Cen
ter for Public Service and the
Neighborhood Improvement Initia
tive.
"L.and is.. .perhaps the critical
factor that determines the quality of
life in a residential area," said Polit
ical Science Assoc. Prof. I uis Fraga
as he introduced the program.
"Economic development should
have benefits for all," Fraga contin
ued. "But development never helps
all equally."
The three speakers. Lenn\ Gold
berg, Linda Mandolini and Barry
Boulton represented different
facets of the Silicon Valley commu
nity. All three advocated the need
for a community dialogue about
land use decisions.
Goldberg, executive director of
the California Tax Reform Associa
tion, supported broadening the tax
base to help Silicon Valley solve its
land use problems through in
creased investment in transporta
tion and infrastructure.
"We have a land value tax that
stands good economics on its head,"
said Goldberg. "You want to tax

those things that don't affect invest
ments, not those things that do."
According to Goldberg, Califor
nia is "failing to capture rising land
values," since revenue from Califor
nia's property tax grew 2 percent
last year and personal income grew
by 15 percent.
The panelists also touched on the
issue of affordable housing and the
housing shortage.
"Not everyone at Intel is a mil
lionaire," said Mandolini. director
of transportation and land use direc
tor for the Silicon Valley Manufac
turing Group. "There are folks at all
different income levels living in this
community."
According to Mandolini. Silicon
Valley communities have more in
centive to build commercial estab
lishments than housing, because
sales taxes bring more revenue than
property taxes. "We're seeing the
localization of the sales tax," she
said.
Mandolini addressed the trans
portation issue, stating that while
Silicon Valley in general has done
little to create a strong system of
public transportation. Stanford has
done a good job in encouraging al

ternatives to driving.
Boulton, a Sierra Club represen
tative, spoke about ecological sus
tainability and responsibility.
"Growth is the bottom-line prob
lem," he said. â€¢
Boulton compared the Euro
pean model of a community incor
porating living, working and recre
ating with the system of zoning land
for specific uses in the United
States. According to Boulton, zon
ing encourages "a lack of responsi
bility for impact."
"The failure of the property tax
leads to dependence on the sales
tax," said Goldberg. "We can barely
build enough infrastructure to keep
up with growth."
"These are very real issues," said
Antoinette Laudencia, coordinator
of the Stanford in Silicon Valley
Project.
Junior Jess Goldberg called the
public policy course, "the best class
I've taken at Stanford."
"Everything they said was exact
ly what we're studying," said Karen
Brunton. also a junior in the class.
Both students have internships re
lating to regional development is
sues.
