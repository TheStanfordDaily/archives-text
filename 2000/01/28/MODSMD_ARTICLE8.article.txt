The path toward the 2(XX) ASSU
Elections began last night as current
elected officers held an informational
meeting for prospective candidates
for the positions of president, vice
president, class presidents and the
ASSU Senate.
A panel of 10 ASSU officers dis
cussed their elected positions and the
experience of running for office with
an audience that was largely com
posed of freshmen, first-time candi
dates. "I'm really excited. I think it
will be an interesting experience,
much less superficial than [student
government | was in high school,"
said freshman Alana Aldag.
One aspect that the current office
holders stressed was the large time
commitment. ASSU President Mike

Levin said that he typically worked 70
hours per week last quarter.
However, they also placed an em
phasis on the impact that students
had. "What's special about student
government is that you're not just
doing short-term projects, hut you
can fundamentally change the way
that the University works," said
ASSU Senator Nikki Love. "People
can take an idea and really go with it
and make a hig change on campus."
Prospective candidates shared the
same sentiments. "I'm running he
cause substantive change through the
ASSIJ is possible," said freshman
Hiro Iwanaga. "You can leave and
graduate and come back and say, 'I
did that.'"
There have been several changes
to the election process this year to re
flect a shift toward greater incorpora
tion of technology.

An online Elections Handbook
will replace the paper version that
was distributed to all students until
last year. "We've had a lot of difficul
ty with getting it out in the past, but
now we've got the ability to get it all
online." said ASSU Elections Com
missioner Jason Kang.
Unlike last year, candidates were
not required to attend this informa
tional meeting; they have the option
of obtaining candidate materials on
the World Wide Web. As a result, at
tendance was rather sparse, with
about 30 prospective candidates at
the meeting. "It's better this way be
cause it's the students who are really
genuinely interested who benefit
from it." said Kang.
Campaigning will officially begin
on April 12 for the April 19-20 elec
tions. According to ASSU Vice Pres
ident John Mills, many candidates

will not find time to sleep during the
final week prior to elections.
"It's crazy, hut it's a good crazy.
You're having the best time of your
life and are meeting people you'd
never meet otherwise," said Mills.
It is not too late for students who
wish to run for office. The first
mandatory meeting for candidates
will be held Feb. 17, and according to
Kang. those interested in running can
find all of the information they need
at the ASSU Web site.
However, Levin warned prospec
tive candidates that the responsibili
ties of holding an ASSU office are not
to be taken lightly. "I would highly
encourage anyone merely interested
in resume-padding not to run for an
elected ASSU position," he said.
"But if you genuinely want to im
prove Stanford, the ASSU can be
your means."
