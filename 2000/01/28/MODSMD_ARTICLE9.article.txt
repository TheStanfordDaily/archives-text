spring's Herstory celebration of
women's history and women's issues.
Although the two-week long

planning is already underway to
bring a variety of speakers, artists and
workshops to campus.
"I want to get tons of people excit
ed from different backgrounds," said
Herstory's director. Kelly Vaughan.
"1 want this to be an event where (es
pecially] freshmen and sophomores
come and think, "Wow. how can 1 get
involved?""

Vaughan, a senior, said she went
to Herstory her freshman year and
was amazed by the breadth of work
shops and programs offered.
This is Vaughan's first year as the
I lerslory director, and her goals are
to build leadership in the Herstory
committee, get organized and make
it easier for her successor to direct the
event next year.
She also hopes to encourage both
women and men to come to the
events.
This year's theme is "Voices,"
which Vaughan said can be interpret
ed in a variety of ways.
"In the past, our themes involved
women taking up space," Vaughan
said. "But this theme reflects voices
in art and in politics."
The event is being co-sponsored

by the Women's Coalition and the
ASSIJ. Event planners will also
focus on diversity bv bringing pre
senters from many backgrounds to
campus.
The Women's C 'enter is also spon
soring a race dialogue with a dual
focus on gender and race, which be
gins Monday. The dialogue will serve
as a preview of I lerstory.
"The race dialogue will look at
how race and gender interact in our
society," Vaughan said. The dialogue
will address issues similar to those
that will be discussed during April's
event.
Although the list of speakers for
I lerstory is not finalized, an African-
American storyteller and a hip-hop
collective may be featured. Mean
while, the Student Speaker's Bureau

is working with Herstory to bring
Thomas to campus.
