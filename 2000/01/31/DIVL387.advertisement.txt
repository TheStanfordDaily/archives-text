Acquaintance rape is when
someone you know forces
you to have sexual intercourse
against your will. It you have
passed out, are too intoxicated
to refuse, too scared to argue, or
for some other reason do not give
consent - these are all considered
against your will. It can happen
to both women and men: straight,
gay, lesbian, or bisexual.
The Stats
According to national surveys:
■ Four in five women who are
victims of sexual assault
know their attackers.
■ Forty-two percent of women
said they had experienced
sexual coercion while dating
in college. Of those women,
70 percent did not seek help.
■ Women are more likely to
report sexual assault if their
assailant is a stranger rather
than an acquaintance, and
they are more likely to report
completed rape than attempted
rape.
■
Contributing Factors
■ Media images that condone
the use of force in sex
■ Drug and alcohol use: it
inhibits accurate risk assess
ment and increases aggression _
■ Gender roles that inhibit
honest communication about
sexuality
Don't Assume Consent 1
■ Don't assume that someone
wants sex because of their ■
dress or behavior.
■ Don't assume that you both
want the same degree of
intimacy. Continuous consent -
both verbal and nonverbal - ■
prevents misunderstandings.

Of the women who said
they'd been sexually assaulted
during college, less than a
third sought help.
■ Remember, when people are
intoxicated, they can't consent.
■ Someone who turns you down
for sex is making a decision
about a single act at a parti
cular time, and not necessarily
rejecting you as a person.
Preventing Assaults
■ Be assertive.
■ Prepare. Think through the
options you are comfortable
with (e.g., buying time, feign
ing bizarre behavior or
resisting with full physical
force), and be prepared to use
them.
■ Trust your intuition to tell
you if you are in a threat
ening situation; stay calm, act
quickly, and try to get away.
Be clear so your intentions
are not misunderstood.
Take a self defense class to
increase your skills and
confidence. For classes and
prevention programs, call
725-4211.
Going along with the assault
may be your only choice to
prevent escalating violence.
This is not the same as giving
consent.
Helping a Friend
■ Listen; don't ask a lot of
questions or give advice.
■ Suggest options, but respect
the person's decision as to
what to do.
■ Give information about on
and off-campus resources.
If You are Assaulted
■ Go to a safe place. Get
medical help if needed.
■ Call the Campus Sexual
Assault Response and
Recovery Team (CSARRT - a
part of CAPS) at 725-9955 for
support.
■ A CAPS counselor can be
reached 24 hours a day at
723-3785.
■ Contact campus police at 723-
9633 or 9-911 to file a police
report and request collection
of medical-legal evidence (do
not shower, douche, wash or
destroy your clothes or any
physical evidence).
■ If needed, Cowell offers
"unprotected intercourse"
exams for sexually trans
mitted diseases (STD's) and
pregnancy concerns.
■ Seriously consider informing
a University official - every
reasonable effort will be
made to protect your privacy
and the confidentiality of
information.
■ Do not blame yourself; no
one deserves to be raped.
■ Reach out for emotional sup
port from someone you trust Q
