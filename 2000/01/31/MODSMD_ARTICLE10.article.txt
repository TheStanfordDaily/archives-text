# AIDS treatment may lower transmission risk
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AF) — An
encouraging study suggests that
people with very low levels of the
AIDS virus in their blood are
unlikely to spread HIV to others.
Although conducted in Africa,
the study could have important
implications for the future of the
AIDS epidemic in the United
States, where drug treatment has
lowered virus levels for many.
AIDS treatments in recent years
have saved many lives, and public
health experts speculate that they
may have an additional benefit —
slowing the epidemic by making
infected people less likely to pass
the virus to others. The new study
offers indirect evidence this hope is
well founded.
However, for several reasons.

the conditions studied in Africa do
not precisely mirror the U.S. AIDS
situation, and experts caution that
the new research should not lull
Americans into giving up safe sex
practices. Unprotected sex with an
HIV-infected person probably
always carries some risk, no matter
how low their virus level.
The new study looked ;it sexual
transmission of HIV in rural I igan
da. It was conducted by Dr. Thomas
C. Quinn and others from Johns
Hopkins University and presented
Sunday at the 7th C onference on
Retroviruses and Opportunistic
Infections.
The study found that the higher
the level of HIV in the infected per
son's blood, the higher the risk of
passing on the virus through sex.

"In non-condom users, viral load
is the greatest predictor of transmis
sion of HIV heterosexuallv." said
Quinn.
Doctors measure the number of
individual viruses in a milliliter of
blood. The study found that some
one with 2()l).()()() copies of virus is 2
1/2 times more likely to Spread 111 V
than is someone with 2,000 copies.
However, the researchers found
no transmission of virus at all by
infected people who carried less
than 1.5(H) copies of the virus, even
though they had sex without con
doms.
Because of the high expense.
AIDS treatment is rare in Africa.
I lowever. in the I Jnited States, doe
tors typically try to reduce paticn
virus levels to below the level of

detection, which is about 50 copies
per milliliter.
About half of all U.S. patients
fail to reach this undetectable level
consistently. However, doctors say
virus levels below 1.500 are com
mon even among these so-called
treatment failures.
I lowever. both Quinn and Dr.
Helenc Ciayle, AIDS chief at the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, cautioned that the
situation is not be identical in the
United States. They noted that in
Africa, oeople may have low \irus
levels because their immune sys
tems are s ill strong enough to light
HIV.
Hut in the United States, many
people's virus levels are lowered by
treatment with AIDS medicines.
