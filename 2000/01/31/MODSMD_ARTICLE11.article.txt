MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) —
AI Gore and fellow Democrats
jumped "into bed with special inter
ests" during the 19% fund-raising
scandal, rival Bill Bradley said Sun
day, as he struggled with questions
about his own health two days
before New Hampshire's primary.
Sen. John McCain claimed, "There's
only one man who is fully prepared"
to be commander-in-chief, and he
said it's not George W. Bush.
With polls showing Gore's once
commanding lead narrowing, the
vice president struggled to deal with
Bradley's sudden eagerness to
attack. A political flame-thrower
himself. Gore accused Bradley of
impugning his integrity and "step
ping down ... to the level of person
al vilification."
Bush, the two-term Texas gover
nor and national GOP front-runner,
said his executive office experience
would make for a better president.
"I'm not of the Washington scene.
I'm not a committee chairman,"
Bush said, digging at Senate Com
merce Committee chairman
McCain.
"I'm the guy who can beat A 1
Gore," McCain replied, as the GOP
and Democratic campaigns
appeared headed for close finishes.
McCain holds a slight edge or is tied
with Bush in polls here, after leading
the Texan for eight weeks. Gore's
edge over Bradley is slightly wider,
but that contest also could be close
Tuesday.
Bradley, McCain. Bush and
Republican Alan Reyes made the
round of Sunday talk shows while
the seven major-party White House
hopefuls plowed toward Tuesday's
vote with rallies and news confer
ences.
Running a distant third in
Republican polling here, millionaire
publisher Steve Forbes kept his eye
on Bush. After the Texan told "Fox
News Sunday" that he would cut
taxes "hopefully in the first term."
Forbes questioned Bush's commit
ment to the issue.
"I don't want to say, 'I told you
so' but having led with a timid tax
cut and now hedging about whether
he can even get that, I think this is
part of the waffling and equivocating
that people are tired of," Forbes said
in an interview.
Keyes, the conservative fire
brand. picked up the endorsement
of David Schippers, chief GOP
investigator for President Clinton's
impeachment trial. 1 le said the race
between Bradley and Gore is a
choice between "the devil or Beelze
bub."
Fellow conservative Gary Bauer,
struggling to keep his candidacy
alive, maintained a light schedule
that included a Super Bowl party.
Recognizing that football, not poli
tics. held voters' interests Sunday,
most of the candidates ended their
day in front of the TV.
Lugging cheese popcorn and
pretzels through a shopping center
parking lot. Manchester voter Den

nis Ekerson dismissed a political
question with a laugh. "Gary Bauer?
Does he play for Tennessee or Los
Angeles," the registered indepen
dent said.
Bradley, a former basketball star,
has been slow to reveal details about
his irregular heartbeat condition and
acknowledged Sunday that he has
briefly undergone anesthesia three
times for treatment since December
19%.
He told ABC "it would be appro
priate" to invoke the 25th Amend
ment and turn power over to his vice
president if he underwent the same
treatment as president.
Though the candidate and his
doctors say the condition is simply a
medical nuisance, it could become a
political problem if voters worry
about his health.
Bradley lost badly to Gore in the
lowa caucuses last week and would
be staggered by a second-straight
defeat in New Hampshire. The for
mer lawmaker surrendered his lead
to Gore in New Hampshire polls
during the vice president's aggres
sive final week of campaigning in
lowa.
Bradley, however, has enough
money to continue beyond this state,
and has released a schedule showing
that he intends to do so. The next
contests — a series of March 7 pri
maries — include states where
Bradley is strong.
Since the waning days of the
lowa campaign. Bradley has been
torn between a need to attack Gore
and a fear that negative campaigning
will tarnish his self-styled image as a
non-politician. Daily polling, which
is sometimes unreliable, showed-
Bradley edging toward Gore — and
the vice president seemed to be feel
ing the heat.
"Why would Senator Bradley
break his promise to run a different
kind of campaign and launch divi
sive, manipulative attacks?" Gore
asked supporters, as Democratic
leaders backing the vice president
urged Bradley to curb his criticism.
Bradley has turned the tables on
Gore: The vice president revitalized
his sagging campaign last fall by
launching a full-throated case
against Bradley's health care plan
and questioning the former New
Jersey senator's commitment to the
Democratic Party.
With aides promising still harder
attacks, Bradley stopped short of
calling Gore a liar. "I don't think
that he said the truth" about his
abortion record in Congress.
Bradley told ABC.
At a rally later. Bradley waved a
recent article about Gore's 19%
fund-raising trip to a Buddhist Tem
ple near Los Angeles and demanded
an explanation. He said the fund
raising scandal "was a disgrace" to
both parties, particularly Demo
crats.
"When we all get into bed with
the special interests, I think that
makes a more serious problem for us
than for Republicans." Bradley said.
