## Editor's farewell Stepping down 
### 
Editor in chief
reflects on Volume
216

S
No more ulcers, no more late
nights reading galleys, no more Hip
ping layouts around because articles
fell through. 1 know I'll miss it. Every
one knows I'll miss it.
I know 1 could have done better. I
know that even at my best, there are
some who could have still done it bet
ter.
But I hope the effort showed. I
hope I made an impact, an impres
sion. Editing isn't my passion, writing
is. But I hope that sometime during
my tenure, I've helped pass a little bit
of that passion along toothers. I hope
they saw how much I love this busi
ness, and that they took a little of that
enthusiasm.
I hope I made you care about this
University, at least a little. I hope you
had at least one moment when you
saw something in this paper jind
thought about it, realty tried to sec
how it might impact you, your friends,
your community.
My sincerest thanks to all of you
who took the time to contact us and
give us your thoughts. It doesn't mat
ter if you agreed with us or not — I've
been called some things I won't
repeat for fear of making my farewell
too vulgar — but knowing that you
care about the things around us, the
events that touch our lives, if even in
the smallest ways, makes this job that
much more meaningful.
1 know many people put a lot of
effort into this. I thank my staff great
ly for everything they've done. It isn't
easy, the demands we put on our
selves. There's been anger. There've

been tears. ITiere've been laughs. But
they kept pushing, getting the job
done, whieh is the most I can ask in
the end. Every job here can be taxing.
It lakes more than talent. It takes spir
it and will.
I know they've felt it. Everyone
who's ever held a position here has
felt it. There can be a sense of dread,
approaching those double doors,
knowing what can come inside: a long
night, an angry letter, hassles with
others. But they've done it. And when
things got tough we knew we could all
lean on each other.
Of course it's not all bad. Far from
it. If there's anything I've loved about
this job, it's the camaraderie among
everyone here. It's knowing that
someone will have a joke, a warm
smile waiting. I've made some of my
closest friends in this building. 1 know
others have as well.
I'd also like to thank my friends
outside of this office. Maybe I didn't
take advantage of the little things —
an ear that was waiting to listen or a
shoulder that was wailing to be
leaned on — as often as I might have,
but it's a lot just knowing that they're
there. I've vented my frustrations,
stied my tears, shared my enthusiasm?
Thanks for being there. 'ITianks for
seeing how much journalism means to
me and holding me up and pushing
me along.
So that's it. I know you all identify.
We all have something that brings
about these emotions in us. ITiis isn't
the ultimate goal. I may never edit
again. I've gotten the management
oul of my system. Four months and 69
issues of this place can do that to you.
But man, it was a heck of a ride.
Thanks,
