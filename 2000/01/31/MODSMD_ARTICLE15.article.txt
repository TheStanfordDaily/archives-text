firing back "Smells Like
Fish"
Your decision to cancel the comic strip
"Smells Like Fish" is a mistake. 1 must
question the sense of humor of those that
feel the strip, as a whole, has little or no
comic merit.
I.for one, certainly find it to be signifi
cantly funnier than any other strip that is
currently printed in The Daily. Cancel
those before you cancel "Smells Like
Fish."
With the removal of "Smells I.ike
Fish," you are making The Daily a less
appealing and less enjoyable newspaper.

1 recently discovered that you are can
celing the cartoon "Smells Like Fish." I
think that this is a terrible mistake.
I read The Daily frequently. Sometimes
I enjoy it, and sometimes I don't. The one
constant, however, is that I appreciate the
different views The Daily attempts to
express.
There is not a single type of Stanford

student, nor is there a single viewpoint
that needs to be conveyed by The Daily in
every story, every editorial, and every car
toon.
"Smells Like Fish" speaks to a substan
tial and very important part oT the Stan
ford community. I have seen it clipped and
taped on the doors of both professors and
students.
I don't claim to cry tears of laughter
every time 1 read "Smells Like Fish," but
upon reading it I do think and 1 do often
laugh.
What worries me most is that you won't
find a replacement for "Smells Like Fish."
You may run another cartoon, or perhaps
add the extra inches to an even larger
advertisement for Anderson Consulting.
You will lose a unique and fun attitude,
and you will lose an audience if you cancel
the cartoon. I hope you carefully reconsid
er your decision to cancel it and realize
that in eliminating the strip you are sever
ing The Daily from a valid segment of the
Stanford community.

I am writing to protest the anticipated
cancellation of J. Maas' comic strip, "Smells
Like Fish." I know little about the circum
stances surrounding its cancellation and
have only heard second-hand that it is
being discontinued for being unfunny. I
hope that you will reconsider your decision
and not pull "Smells I.ike Fish" from The
Daily.
I make a habit to read almost every issue
of The Daily and spend some decent time
on the comics page while finishing the
crossword puzzle, so I've seen most of
Maas' work. His cartoons are consistently
amusing and clever, which is more than I
can say for Cham and Bailey's grad student
strip.
Newspaper comics in general have been
going downhill for years; you're lucky if
you smile, let alone chuckle when you read
the comics. The sad norm of the "funny"
pages is a series of cutesy For-Better-Or-
For-Worse style drawings with an overused
reflection on motherhood, weight gain, or
maybe a disgusting pun.
Perhaps you have decided that Maas'
work is too unlike the majority of comics to
deserve survival, but thank God for his
deviation.

Maas can't draw to save his life. His
humor, however, is quirky, eccentric and
original. Please keep his strip in the paper,
and I'll keep reading it.

I've been reading The Daily for five
years and "Smells L.ike Fish" has been one
of the best cartoons you've had during that
time. Canceling it would be a loss and a
shame.

Do away with "Smells Like
Fish"
I heard you canceled "Smells Like Fish."
This is the best move The Daily could
have made. You have done a great service
toward the Stanford community, I com
