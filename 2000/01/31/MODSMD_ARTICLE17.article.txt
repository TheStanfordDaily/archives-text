## Govind Dandekar An open letter to future columnists 
### 
Today's paper marks
the end of another
Daily volume. And
with it comes the end of
my tenure as a columnist.
Over the course of the
next few days, a handful of
students will submit two

sample columns (of about 750 words each)
and a cover letter explaining why they want
to be a Daily columnist.
The new Opinions editors will carefully
pour over these writing samples and select
about five new columnists. By mid-Febru
ary, this gray and black space will be occu
pied by an eager new band of students.
... Lun aud-iiave _(mv superb ttdiUus.)
selected me to Be the humor columnist. As
a result, most of my pieces had one purpose,
to make you laugh. For my final column, I 'd
like to write an informative piece. This col
umn is intended to be an open letter to all
future Daily columnists.
Over the past few weeks, 1 had multiple
students e-mail me and ask me what I
thought about being a Daily columnist and
if I'd recommend it for them. The answer is
obvious, if you enjoy writing and can write
in a manner that adds value to the lives of
your readers, you'd probably enjoy being a
columnist.
The logical question then, is how does a
column (or any piece of writing for that
matter) add value? Writing can add value to
the lives of its readers by enlightening them,
by informing them, or simply by entertain
ing them.
So, I'd like to share four humble sugges
tions I have tor column applicants and

future columnists.
Suggestion ()ne: Do not try to enlighten.
There are very few people in the world
who have enough talent, depth of character
and intellectual prowess to write or create
enlightening work in any form. The ones
that do have last names like Vonnegut.
Morrison and Stoppard. And these names
are not constrained by the size and space
limitations of a page four column in The
Daily.
The very nature of this column makes it
very difficult for the writer to open the read
er's eyes to something they already don't
know (and if you can, please do). But most
of these columns are inevitably hackneyed
iuidtnle.. % t tSm Sfc
For example, h)i every volume that 1
have read at Stanford, there has always
been an obligatory column on how Stanford
students study too much. Stanford students
know they study too much. That's what
makes them Stanford students. A 7(H) word
piece on how students should spend less
time studying in Green and more time frol
icking in the foothills while following their
passions while spending more lime with
friends while spending more time drinking
while... I think you get the picture.
Perhaps the point of this column is true,
but it doesn't express anything that every
one doesn't already know, hasn't already
talked about, or hasn t already read in a
previous Daily; and 1 sincerely doubt that it
causes anyone to change any of there long
term study habits.
Suggestion Two: Do not use the words
"gazebo" and "cyborg" in the same sen
tence.

Gazebos represent an abstract form of
humor. Cyborg gazebos represent a very
abstract form of humor. Try and stay away
from cyborg gazebos whenever possible,
especially if you come across a raging horde
of them.
Suggestion Three: Do not use the word
"I" repeatedly.
Many past Daily columnists seem to be
under the impression that just because they
were lucky enough to have this space to
write in, they should be able to foist 750
ostentatious words about their personal
lives, the lives of families and their best
friends upon the rest of the student popula
tion.
Let me point out that most readers enjoy
reading about your personal life about as
much as you enjoy hearing the excruciating
details of the personal life of a total
stranger. Unless you want to draw the ire of
every Daily reader, this is a literary tech
nique you should probably stay away from.
Suggestion Four: Learn how to manage
words.
It's difficult to write a column that con
sistently falls in the 700 to 750 word range.
In order to compensate for this, learn how
to write paragraphs that seem to have a pur
pose but in all actuality, are only there to
take up the last 50 words of the column.
This last paragraph would be an outstand
ing example of that technique.

Govind Dandekar is a senior majoring in
Economics. He would like to thank his
readers for all of their kind words and kind
e-mails.
