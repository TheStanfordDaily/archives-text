# Stanford rates its profs on the Web
## 
### Eileen Chao Contributing writer 
Want to tell last quarter's pro
fessor how you really feel? Stan
ford is among 15 universities in
cluding Harvard and Princeton
listed on Virtualßatings.com, a
Web site that allows students to
rate'and review their professors.
According to Jeffrey A. Rosch
er, the president of Virtualßat
ings.com, the site will affow stu
dents not only to voice their opin
ions about their professors, but aid
students in choosing their courses
and professors as well.
"One of the most important fac
tors when it comes to obtaining an
education are the professors that
you take," Roscher said. "This site
assists students in seeking out the
best professors they can and get
ting the best education they can for
their money."
Anyone can view the comments
already on the Web site, but stu
dents need to register under a user
ID to post their thoughts, and their
email is made accessible to anyone
who reads their posting.
Along with providing com
ments about a professor and his or
her course, students may also rank
their professors. Scores range from
10 (A++) to 0 (F-) and the top
ranking professors are listed on a
sidebar.
One such Stanford professor
was Introduction to Humanities
Prof. John Shank. He said he was
pleasantly surprised by the fact
that the people who posted to the
Web site also gave their e-mails.
"By forcing people to put their
name, it's making them account
able for what they say," Shank
said. "People can't just throw
words out blindly. It's a check on
reckless criticism."
This identification requirement
in Virtualßatings.com is crucial,
according to Roscher. "Virtual-
Ratings.com is a forum for free
speech," Roscher said. "As such,
students are responsible for what
ever they post on the site. We will
not censor ratings or reviews in any
way. However, slanderous or li
belous ratings that are brought to
our attention will be removed im
mediately."
Stanford was recently added to
the site, so only a few professors

have been evaluated. Freshman
Amir Aharonov, who posted com
ments on a few of his professors,
feels the site is beneficial, despite
the possibility of derogatory re
marks.
"I think the site offers a forum
for open discussion about classes
and professors, discussions that
happen in dorms all around cam
pus and among friends,"
Aharonov said. "The site lets Stu
dents share their experience on a
bigger scale. Yes, it may allow for
'prof-bashing' but I think the ma
jority of the opinions are genuine."
However, some professors are
less eager to accept the validity of
what students say on the Web.
"You worry about how well
[the comments] represent the real
range of opinions and how much
students put in when they post
these things," said history Prof.
Jack Rakove. "But in the end, stu
dents have the chance to make up
their own mind in class."
Mathematics Prof. Karl Rumel
hart also believes students would
use their judgements while reading
the postings.
"I don't think Stanford students
are foolish enough to base impor
tant decisions on what people say
on a random Web site," Rumel
hart said. "As a student, I couldn't
imagine myself going to this site. I
wouldn't find it particularly use
ful."
Virtualßatings.com is not the
only way students can evaluate
their professors at Stanford. The
ASSU already has an online
course guide, which, according to
the Stanford Web site, "provides
student comments, ratings and
useful statistics for a wide variety
of courses." This information is
gathered from course evaluations
given to students at the end of
every quarter.
Rumelhart believes the ASSU
course guide is a better professor
and course rating system than Vir
tualßatings.com.
"I'm not saying student evalua
tions are bad," Rumelhart said.
"It's just that (this method] is in a
very poor setting, especially given
the fact that it's not necessary since
we have student evaluations every
quarter. And those are in a much
more controlled environment."
I lowever. Roscher said he hopes
this enterprise will become a source
for accurate and accessible ratings
for college students all over the
country.
I le wants the site to help not only
college students, but high school
students looking into college choic

es as well.
"We hope that it enables slu
dents to make the best choices pos
sible at registration time and to get
the most out of their college educa
tion." Roscher said.
I le believes the site will help give
professors the appreciation thev de
serve. "Each of us at Virtualßat
ings.com has been inlluenced by
some very special professors in our
lifetime and this site is dedicated lo
them," he said.
