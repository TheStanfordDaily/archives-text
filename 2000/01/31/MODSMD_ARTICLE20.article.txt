# WSU beaten out of Bay Area
## Men's basketball crushes Cougars in runaway laugher 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Maybe the Pacific 10 Conference
isn't that deep after all.
Or maybe Stanford and its "twin
towers" are just that good.
For the second straight game, the
No. 2 Cardinal demolished its oppo
nent from up north, blowing out
overmatched Washington State 63-
38 Saturday afternoon in front of a
sleepy Maples Pavilion crowd.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Saturday: No. 2 Stanford 63,
Washington State, 38.

The game was never in doubt as
Stanford (17-1.6-1 Pac-10) scored the
first 11 points on its way to an early
22-3 lead over the Cougars (5-12, 0-
8). the last-place team in the confer
ence.
Stanford's Collins twins did much
of the damage, continually attacking
the Cougars' outsized frontline.
Jason led the Cardinal with 14 points
while Jarron, who finished with 10
points, seven rebounds and four as
sists, continued to unveil new parts of
his multifaceted game.
While Saturday's game was not as
easy to watch as Thursday's 92-62
drubbing of Washington, the Cardi
nal still slogged through the slow,
sloppy second half with an ample
lead.
But the game, and the second half
in particular, left Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery with more
than enough to pick at.
While the Cardinal shot 58 per
cent and turned the ball over only
four,times period, it
shot only 40 percent and registered 10
turnovers in the second half.
"You're going to take a 25-point
lead whenever you can," Mont
gomery said. "But we didn't sustain
our intensity the second half. There's
always things to learn and glean from
the game."
Of course, if Montgomery had

chosen to play only his top eight play
ers, he probably wouldn't have as
much to talk about. Instead, the
bench accounted for more than a
third of the minutes played for Stan
ford on Saturday as, once again, all 13
players saw action.
In fact, Stanford's leading scorer
for the game, Jason Collins, and lead
ing rebounder, junior Ryan Mendez,
did not start, though Montgomery
considers both among his "seven
starters" — players who have started
before and who he would feel com
fortable starting at any time.
"Jason was real good tonight."
Montgomery said. "1 could easily go
with him [in the starting lineup]."
That kind of depth, especially in
side, is Stanford's biggest advantage
heading into the latter stages of the
conference race and. eventually, the
NCAA Tournament. It certainly im
pressed first-year Washington State
head coach Paul Graham.
"1 think Stanford can win the na
tional championship," Graham said.
"They and Cicncinnati are the two
best teams right now. [Stanford] has a
bunch of quality players down low
coming in all the time who play per
fectly inside Mike's system."
The Cardinal's potent brand of
man-to-man defense also made an
impression on Graham, who watched
his team shoot just over 25 percent
from the field.
"The tempo of the game was good
for us," said Graham, who likes to
employ a deliberate, slowed-down
offensive gameplan to keep the
Cougars in games. "But we just
couldn't score. A lot of that has to do
with them playing good defense."
Stanford is hoping it can find the
same success this weakened, in a hos
tile environment against a couple of
much tougher opponents. As the
Cardinal travels to Los Angeles to
take on struggling but always talent
ed UCLA and a surprisingly strong
IJSC squad — which is still tied with
Arizona, Oregon and Stanford for
first place in the conference — the

level of competition will most cer
tainly rise.
But the Cardinal's current level of
play might be too much to overcome.
Stanford is in synch offensively and
defensively, has the best depth in the
nation and, as Jarron Collins ex

plained, has fantastic team chemistry
and self-awareness.
"We are a young team, but we
have played with each other for a
while now," he said. "We know what
is a good shot for each player and we
aren't afraid to give it to anyone."
