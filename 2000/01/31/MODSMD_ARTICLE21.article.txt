# Women's swim surprised by UCLA
## 
### Jessica Amey 
Despite an unexpected loss to No. 15 UCLA
on Friday, the small but powerful Stanford
women's swim team recovered to defeat No. 4
USC by a convincing margin the following day.

WOMEN'S SWIM
■ Saturday: No. 3 Stanford 183. No. 4 USC 117.
■ Friday: No. 15 UCLA 154, Stanford 145.

Both meets were contested in short course
meters, as opposed to the standard short course
yards, in preparation for this year's NCAA
championship meet, which will take place in a 25-
meter pool.
The Cardinal was hampered in its efforts on
Friday by the absence of sophomores Shelley

Ripple and Sylvia Bereknyei, due to illness and
injury, respectively.
"With our small size, every person counts,"
said sophomore Whitney Leatherwood. "We just
couldn't overcome those missing people."
Competing with only 11 healthy swimmers,
however, the Cardinal did anything but let the
Bruins cruise to victory.
# As usual, junior Misty Hyman turned in a se
ries of impressive performances, winning the 1(H)
and 2(H) fly, as well as the 200 back.
Other Stanford \yins came from sophomore
Jessica Foschi in the 400 and 8(H) freestyle, junior
Gabrielle Rose in the 2(X) individual medley, se
nior Catherine Fox in the 1(H) back, and junior
Lauren Thies in a very close 200 freestyle race.
Going into the final event, the 200 medley
relay, the score favored the Cardinal 143-139.
Unfortunately Stanford's sprinting reserves had

been exhausted and it placed third behind two
UCLA teams, leaving the final score at 154-145
for the Bruins.
"It was disappointing, but we know that we're
the better team and we'll be ready for them at
Pac-10's," said Foschi of the loss.
Following their first defeat of the season,
coach Richard Quick dispensed a few words of
advice to his team.
"Richard told us that champions are judged
not by how they react to winning, but by how they
react to losing." Foschi said.
The Cardinal evidently took this wisdom to
heart as it hit the water with a renewed sense of
purpose on Saturday, drowning the Trojans 183-
117.
"It was awesome; everyone was on," Foschi
said. "They expected to win and
they weren't ready for us."
The tone of the meet was set
from the very first event, when Stan
ford's 400 medley relay team, com
posed of Ripple, Rose, Hvman and
Bereknyei, staged an upset victory
over the Trojan team.
From there the momentum car
ried forward — I JSC was able to win
a meager three events in the course
of the competition.
In a repeat of the previous day,
Hvman again contributed three
wins to the scoreboard tally, this
time in the 100 and 200 fly, and the
100 back.
Hyman's hat trick was matched
by teammate Fox, who posted victo
ries in the 50 and 100 freestyle, as
well as in the 100 back — an event in
which she is the defending NCAA
champion and American record
holder.
Credit for the most inspiring
swim of the day belongs, though, to
distance specialist Foschi. In addi

tion to winning the 400 freestyle, she
emerged victorious from a tight race
in the 1,500 free.
The mile is not typically consid
ered to be among the more enter
taining events at a swim meet, but
on this particular day spectators
were treated to a hard-fought duel
as Fosehi and Trojan Asa Sundland
exchanged the lead throughout the
16-plus minute race. In the end, Fos
ehi persevered to take the win with
a time of 16 minutes, 32.84 seconds.
Stanford divers also participated
in the competitions this past week
end. where they made crucial con
tributions in both meets. In particu
lar. the UCLA meet would not have
been as closely matched were it not
for the efforts of juniors Erin Sones
and Kim Powers, who won the one
meter and three-meter springboard
events, respectively.
The two athletes went on to re
peat their wins the following day
against the traditionally dominant
Trojan squad.
Stanford's swimmers and divers
now look ahead to Feb. 12, when
they will host No. 3 California at
home in deGucrre pool.
