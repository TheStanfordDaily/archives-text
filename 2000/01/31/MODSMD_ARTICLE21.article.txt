Despite an unexpected loss to No. 15 UCLA
on Friday, the small but powerful Stanford
women's swim team recovered to defeat No. 4
USC by a convincing margin the following day.

WOMEN'S SWIM
■ Saturday: No. 3 Stanford 183. No. 4 USC 117.
■ Friday: No. 15 UCLA 154, Stanford 145.

Both meets were contested in short course
meters, as opposed to the standard short course
yards, in preparation for this year's NCAA
championship meet, which will take place in a 25-
meter pool.
The Cardinal was hampered in its efforts on
Friday by the absence of sophomores Shelley

Ripple and Sylvia Bereknyei, due to illness and
injury, respectively.
"With our small size, every person counts,"
said sophomore Whitney Leatherwood. "We just
couldn't overcome those missing people."
Competing with only 11 healthy swimmers,
however, the Cardinal did anything but let the
Bruins cruise to victory.
# As usual, junior Misty Hyman turned in a se
ries of impressive performances, winning the 1(H)
and 2(H) fly, as well as the 200 back.
Other Stanford \yins came from sophomore
Jessica Foschi in the 400 and 8(H) freestyle, junior
Gabrielle Rose in the 2(X) individual medley, se
nior Catherine Fox in the 1(H) back, and junior
Lauren Thies in a very close 200 freestyle race.
Going into the final event, the 200 medley
relay, the score favored the Cardinal 143-139.
Unfortunately Stanford's sprinting reserves had

been exhausted and it placed third behind two
UCLA teams, leaving the final score at 154-145
for the Bruins.
"It was disappointing, but we know that we're
the better team and we'll be ready for them at
Pac-10's," said Foschi of the loss.
Following their first defeat of the season,
coach Richard Quick dispensed a few words of
advice to his team.
"Richard told us that champions are judged
not by how they react to winning, but by how they
react to losing." Foschi said.
The Cardinal evidently took this wisdom to
heart as it hit the water with a renewed sense of
purpose on Saturday, drowning the Trojans 183-
117.
"It was awesome; everyone was on," Foschi
