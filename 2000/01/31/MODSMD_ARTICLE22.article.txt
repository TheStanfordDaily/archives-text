### Katie Fitzpatrick Contributing writer 
No. 10 Stanford (4-1) outflipped the No. 20 Huskies
195.05-194.75 in a women's gymnastics dual on Friday in
Bumham Pavilion.
The team total was the highest for the Cardinal this
season, even though it was faced with a strong Huskic
squad. But more importantly, the Cardinal displayed a
toughness and consistency under pressure, tools that it
will need during postseason competiton when every rou
tine counts.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ Friday: No. 10 Stanford 195.05. No. 20 Washington
194.75.

"It was a tight competition and we did really well. We
did what we needed to do to win which is really gixxJ this
early in the season." Fontaine said.
"It was the best meet so far this season." said sopho
more Becky Meldrum.
The win will give the Cardinal a much deserved sense
of confidence and pride as it continues through the sea
son.
The meet was highlighted by the all-around perfor

mance of Fontaine (39.525). Returning to the all-around
competiton after nearly a year, Fontaine's total placed her
in the Cardinal record books as the third highest all
around scorer in Stanford history.
While Fontaine shined especially bright, the key to the
Cardinal \ Jtory was the depth and consistency of the en
tire squad which did not count any routine with a fall into
the team total.
"We're pulling together as a team really well," said ju
nior Jennifer Exaltacion.
The meet started well for the Cardinal on vault. Fresh
man Alissa Cooper (9.575), sophomore Katy Herbert
(9.575) and freshman Kelscy Stillinger (9.675) con
tributed solid scores. Exaltacion added a 9.7 with a clean
handspring pike front. But the vault title went to Fontaine
who scored a 9.9 in a characteristic near-perfect perfor
mance. At Fontaine's current pace, she will certainly chal
lenge for the NCAA vault title — a title she won in 1995.
The team rotated to uneven bars where it put together
another amazing team performance. The emphasis in
training on performing aggressively and executing their
routines was apparent as every gymnast displayed clean
er routines than in previous competitions.
Herbert added a 9.75 to the solid 9.7 effort of sopho
more Kristin Jensen. Cooper and Exaltacion each stuck
their landings after performing clean
sets and were rewarded with 9.8.
Fontaine capped the rotation with a
flawless 9.9 to earn the uneven bar
title in her first bar performance
since shattering her finger early last
season.
()n balance beam, the squad over
came its problems from last weekend
and had an incredibly strong show
ing. Meldrum opened the rotation
with a 9.75, a performance that was
her most solid routine to date.
Fontaine, freshman Abby Gair and
I lerbert displayed remarkably ag
gressive routines and were each re
warded with 9.7755. Exaltacion com
bined her usual style and grace to
score a flawless 9.85 set that was her
best of the season.
Exaltacion was not surprised with
the solid routines in the beam lineup.
"We've been very consistent in
the gym. I'm happy that we pulled it
together in the competition," Exalta
cion said.
"We rocked beam," echoed
Fontaine.
I he squad finished the competi
tion on floor exercises with some dy
namic routines. Jensen performed
her awesome tumbling with her
usual ease to earn a 9.675. Herbert
added a spunky 9.725 routine to the
team total. (iair scored a career high
of l ). 8 with a strong performance.
Fontaine also scored a near-perfect
9.95 — a career high for the accom
plished senior. Fontaine's effort
earned her the floor title and made
her hungry lor the elusive "perfect
10."
"I really want a 10," Fontaine said
with a smile.
After its best performance of the
season, the Cardinal will head back
lo the gym to prepare for defending
I'acilic 10C hampion UCLA on Sun
da's in Pauley Pavilion.
