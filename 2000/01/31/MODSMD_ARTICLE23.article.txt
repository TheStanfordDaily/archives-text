MEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ Saturday: No. 15 Stanford finishes
second at the Cardinal Open.

The No. 15 Cardinal tallied 220.05
to beat No. 20 UC-Santa Barbara's
20320, but fell short of No. S Califor
nia's 224.925.
Stanford moved to 2-3 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation,
while UCSB fell to 0-5. and Califor
nia remained undefeated at 5-0.
The second-place finish was no
surprise to the Cardinal, but its solid
overall performance was undoubted
ly a surprise to the visiting teams.
"We had a gigantic improve

ment," said senior Ail-American
Jason Katsampes. "It was a very long
meet and we were mentally and phys
ically tired. The team stayed togethei
all the way until the last event and
everyone came through."
The Cardinal was also tired last
weekend, but it was unable to hit
many routines. This time out. the
team's hit percentage w as much high
er and Stanford was duly rewarded
with a team score over 220 — almost
five points above last week's 215.60.
ITie few routines that Stanford did
miss were not very far off from per
fection.
"Tonight was a matter of minor
mishaps instead of missing major
skills," said junior Jason Bill/. "Now
we w ill go back into the gym and put
it all together."
Stanford was aggressive from the
very first event — posting a season
high 37.60 on the rings. The Cardinal
never let up its intensity and was able
to capitalize on the support of a loud
home crowd.

Tonight we really pulled togeth
er and competed as a team," said
Nophmore David Durante.
The Cardinal effort was headlined
by the outstanding performances of
Biltz, who earned first-place honors
on parallel bars (9.50) and high bar
(9.60) and placed second in the all
around with a career-best 55.95.
"It was nice to finally do in com
petition what I do in the gym every
day," Biltz said. "I'm anxious to per
fect each routine down to the small
est detail."
Other strong performances were
turned in by Katsampes, who dazzled
the crowd with his clean lines on the
pommel horse (9.70) and the high bar
(9.55). Both routines earned him sec
ond place honors.
Stanford head coach Sadao
Hamada was extremely pleased with
his team's performance.
"1 saw the signs of things coming
together." Hamada said. "We nar
rowed the gap with Cal by competing
with more confidence and staying re
laxed during the meet."
Even though the team has been
worn down, the Cardinal will contin
ue training twice-a-day this week.
"I know my guys are tired, but be
cause NCA As are three weeks early
this year we need to be very smart in
our training." Hamada said. "We're
going to keep with the same plan but
just increase the intensity in prac
tice."
Hamada'will not ask his team to
do as many routines as he might like,
but he wants them to "focus on per
forming them with better quality."
If Stanford's solid performance at
the Cardinal Open is any indication
of what is to come, then the competi
tion better watch out. The Cardinal is
on track to surprise the rest of the
country and once again be a threat in
the postseason.
"A meet like this is very encour
aging." said junior co-captain Rico
Andrade. "We improved five points
in one week but we still missed a ton
of routines. Our sights are firmly set
on winning NCA As."
The high level of enthusiasm and
motivation on this Cardinal squad is
clear as the team is confident in its ul
timate potential.
"Things are definitely coming
along. 1 can see that for sure," Hama
da said.
