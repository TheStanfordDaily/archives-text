■ Saturday: No. 15 Stanford finishes
second at the Cardinal Open.

The No. 15 Cardinal tallied 220.05
to beat No. 20 UC-Santa Barbara's
20320, but fell short of No. S Califor
nia's 224.925.
Stanford moved to 2-3 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation,
while UCSB fell to 0-5. and Califor
nia remained undefeated at 5-0.
The second-place finish was no
surprise to the Cardinal, but its solid
overall performance was undoubted
ly a surprise to the visiting teams.
"We had a gigantic improve

ment," said senior Ail-American
Jason Katsampes. "It was a very long
meet and we were mentally and phys
