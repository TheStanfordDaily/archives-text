Stanford students arc given an
enormous amount of information
about where and when to do com
munity service, hut are rarely given
information on how to do communi
ty service â€” until now.
This year, the Haas C enter for
Public Service has begun a new
"Youth and Education Series,"
seeking to address the questions
often posed by students engaged in
youth-focused community service
activities.
Every Wednesday, the Haas
C enter holds a seminar focusing on a
different aspect of youth service,
with titles such as "Creating an In

clusive Educational Environment"
and "Approaches to Improving
Outcomes for a Diverse Popula
tion." Each seminar features a spe
cialist in a particular area of youth
service, who makes opening com
ments and facilitates a discussion on
the topic.
"Of all (Ik Haas student groups,
about half are youth and education
related," said Nancy Vandenberg.
the assistant director of the- I 'pward
Bound Program at I l.ias and a co-di
rector t)l the Youth and Education
Series. "We found not a lot of class
es existed at Stanford in terms of ser
vice learning or training. We felt that
this series would of fer an opportuni
ty for students to learn more about
the broader contextual issues of the

children they serve."
"We found in past years that nu
merous students were asking for the
vime things "-lie*:i as practical lips for
uorkiii" with kids said Cathy

and one student involved in plan
ning for ihe series "There are at

with youth and education issues, and
they rarely, if ever, talk with each
other. N< >w. each week they have the
chance to do so."

ucation" and will outline "the
process of identifying and educating
a child with special needs," accord
