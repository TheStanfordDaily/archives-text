# Twin towers put on show
## Collinses come together to reinforce inside game 
### Sameer Ahmed Contributing writer 
While there are many similarities
between Cardinal twin big men Jar
ron and Jason Collins, the most obvi
ous things the two had in common in
No. 2 Stanford's 63-38 win over
Washington Stale were impeccable
field goal shooting and dominating
performances.
Junior forward Jarron, who fin
ished the game with 10 points, seven
rebounds and a perfect 5 ol 5 from the

field, helped catapult the Cardinal
into an 11-0 lead in the first six min
utes of the game. During that stretch,
Jarron notched a steal, two assists,
three rebounds, and four points.
Jarron complemented his all
around performance with the devel
opment of his new patent shot, the 5-
to 10-foot fade-away jumper, which
he made four times during the game.
"If a team gives me the opportuni
ty to take the fade-away, I'll go for it,"
Jarron said.
Washington State, which does not

have a player over 6 foot, 8 inches,
simply did not have the height to get
into Jarron's face and disrupt his
jump shot.
"Jarron has increased his range
and his hops," head coach Mike
Montgomery said. "[His fade-away
juniper] is difficult to defend. It's a
good shot for him."
While Jarron took the majority of
his shots a few feet from the basket,
his brother, redshirt freshman center
Jason, began scoring from much clos
er with his rim-shaking slam dunks.
Jason's first dunk came midway
through the first half. He received a
beautiful pass from senior guard
David Moseley and stuffed the ball
through the hoop. Then, with 44 sec
onds left in the half, Jarron dished the
ball to Jason, who finished in style
with another powerful jam, giving the
Cardinal a 36-16 lead at the half.
"I'm in a rhythm right now," Jason
said. "When I get the ball in the paint,
I have lo finish."
While the Cougars were not tall
enough to stop Jarron's jump shot,
they also did not have the size to stop
Jason down low.
"Jason was just a bigger target in
the game," Montgomery said. "He
was also the recipient of many good
passes."
Although both teams played an
ugly and slow second half, which in
cluded 10 Stanford turnovers, Jason
continued to excite the crowd with his
dunks and strong performance in
side. Ile finished the game with a
team-leading 14 points on perfect 6-
of-6 shooting.
After watching Jarron's unstop
pable fade-away jumpshot through
out the game, junior forward Ryan
Mendez. and others have suggested
that Jason try lo imitate his brother's
jump shot. Responding to their idea,
Jason explained the difference be
tween the twins' styles.
"I'm a little bit more of a power
and get-the-contact player." Jason
said.
An inch taller and seven pounds
heavier that Jarron, Jason focuses his
offensive game around the ability to
taßL 1 thcTftaft "strongly to - The basket
and attempt to draw a foul for a pos
sible three-point play.
