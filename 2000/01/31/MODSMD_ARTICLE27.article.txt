### Tim Kane Contributing writer 
In terms of beginning a season, it

Stanford baseball.
Displaying dominant pitching
and a lineup stocked with power hit
ters, the Cardinal beat Fresno State
10-2 on Friday and then 7-1 on Sat
urday at Beiden Field in Fresno. The

■ Yesterday: Rained out.
■ Saturday: Stanford 7, Fresno State 1.
■ Friday: Stanford 10, Fresno State 2.

On Friday night, preseason All-
America Jason Young made the
start for the Cardinal and earned the
win after pitching four innings while
giving up two hits and one run.
Young did put five men on base with
three walks and two hit batsmen, but
managed to pitch out of the jams,
with Fresno Slate leaving seven of its
nine runners on base.
Senior centerfielder Edmund
Muth did most of the damage at the
plate for the Cardinal, as Muth went
3 for 5 on the day, with four runs bat
ted in. Three of Muth's RBIs came
on a home run in the top of the
eighth that put the game away for
Stanford.
"Our guys swung the bat well
tonight," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess after Friday's game.
"But this is a veteran squad and we
expected them to do that. We also
had some nice performances on the

mound. It was a solid first game."
The Cardinal also got quality
pitching out of its bullpen, as Mike
Gosling took over for Young in the
fifth inning and picked up right
where the staff ace left off, giving up
two hits and one unearned run in
four innings of work. Ryan McCally
came on to close out the Bulldogs in
order in the bottom of the ninth.
Tom Graham started the game
for the Bulldogs, and surrendered a
run in the second and two in the
third, giving way to Mike Hernan
dez in the third after yielding three
runs on five hits in 2 2/3 innings of
work. Hernandez didn't perform
much better, letting the Cardinal
tack on three in the top of the fourth
by manufacturing runs the old-fash
ioned way: walk, sacrifice, double,
single, etc. After the fourth, the
score was 6-0 Stanford and Hernan
dez had joined Graham, who took
the loss, on the bench.
In the second game, Justin
Wayne took the ball for the Cardinal
and baffled the Bulldogs for 5 1/3 in
nings, giving up two hits and one
earned run to gain the win. The
Stanford offense gave Wayne all the
support he needed in the top of the
second when freshman designated
hitter Jason Cooper and senior first
baseman Craig Thompson both
smacked two-run homers off the los
ing pitcher, Shawn Hannah.
"This was a very solid baseball
game for us," said Marquess on Sat
urday. "Justin Wayne did a great job
on the mound and we had a couple
of two-run homers. We played well
and I'm pleased."
Marquess was particularly
pleased with Cooper, who spurned

professional baseball to come to the
Farm. "Jason Cooper is a tremen
dous power hitter and today's home
run was just an example of that,"
said the coach about the opposite
field home run."He may end up
being as good of a power hitter that
we've ever had come into Stanford."
Wayne also shined for the Cardi
nal, setting down 11 straight Fresno
State batters at one point. The junior
ran into trouble in the sixth, loading
the bases before Marquess replaced
him with freshman lefty Tim Cun
ningham. Cunningham, in his first
college appearance, didn't appear to
be rattled, as he pitched three hitless
innings after walking in a runner in
the sixth. Sophomore Mike Wodnic
ki relieved Cunningham in the ninth
and closed out the final two Bulldog
batters to end the game.
Cooper was not the only Stan
ford hitter to have a big game at the
plate. Thompson went 3 for 5 on the
day with the home run and two
RBIs, while senior third baseman
John Gall and Muth each went 2 for
5 with an extra-base hit. Brandon
Gemoll was the only Bulldog to get
two hits for Fresno State, who could
only manage three hits on the day.
Stanford and Fresno State will
reschedule Sunday's game for a date
later in the season, which has not
been determined yet. Brian Sager
was scheduled to take the mound for
the Cardinal against Beau Hintz for
Fresno State.
Stanford's next game will be Fri
day, against No. 2 Cal State Fuller
ton at Sunken Diamond, the first of
a three-game series between the two
teams. First pitch is scheduled for
6:(X) p.m.
