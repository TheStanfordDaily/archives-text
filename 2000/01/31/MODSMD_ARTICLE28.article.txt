The No. 13 Stanford men's volley
ball team (2-4, 2-4 Mountain Pacific-
Sports Federation) increased its los
ing streak to four after dropping
matches to both No. 2 Long Beach
State (5-1,3-0 ) and No. 5 USC (6-1,
4-0) on the road this weekend.
Despite an outcome that left the

Cardinal without a game in either
match, the Stanford squad did man
age to put pressure on and stay with
both its opponents for stretches at the
beginning of each game.
But in a conference that boasts 10
of the top 15 teams in the country,
Stanford will have to work on sus
taining that level of play if it wants to
be a contender for the NCAA play
offs this season.
In case there was any doubt about
that, the Cardinal learned its lesson
Friday night, falling 15-6,15-9,15-4 to
Long Beach State, last season's
NCAA runners-up.
"We were able to stay with Long
Beach and play with them for periods
in the match," head coach Ruben
Nieves said. "But eventually we'd
break down and make mistakes
where Long Beach had steady play
and would pull away."
Through the first 12 rotations in
game one, Long Beach only held
Stanford at 5-3, in what looked to be
a tight match. But after the next three
rotations the 49ers had jumped ahead
to 12-4.
Again, at the beginning of game
two, points were hard to come by and
for the first 16 rotations the Cardinal
was down by one with a score of 3-2,
but over the next 12 rotations. Long
Beach had pulled ahead to 15-9.
"That was the best stretch of side

outs in a game that we've had since
the Santa Barbara tournament."
Nieves said. "We're not giving up
points over that stretch, hut we're not
scoring points either."
Offensively, the Cardinal was
struggling as the squad's leading out
side hitters, sophomore Marcus Ska
ccl and redshirt freshman Seth King,
both ended the match with negative
hitting percentages. Freshman mid
dle bloc ker Curt Toppel led the team
in kills with 27. while junior middle
blocker Brett Youngberg was second
with 11. and junior outside hitter Cur
tis Graham came off the bench to
notch six kills on the night.
"He helped us offensively,"
Nieves said of Graham. "Up to the
point Curtis came in [ in game two] we
felt like we could only set to Curt and
Brad, he gave us a third guy that we
could go to."
On defense Stanford was outdug
(31-26) and outblocked (14-3) by the
49ers. who Nieves considers tobe the
best team defensively that the Cardi
nal has faced this season.
"We need to pick up our defense
so we have something to fall back on
if we're not having a strong offensive
night." Graham said. "Digging more
balls is something we know we can
do, we just need to focus and get the
job done."
In the small. 8(X)-seat gym at IJSC
the following night. Stanford had sim
ilar problems and USC came away
with the 15-7, 15-7,15-10 victory.
Along with a strong Trojan team
that returned five of its six starters
from last year's squad. Stanford was
also forced to deal with a crowded
gym smaller than any other in the
conference.
The gym. called a "hostile envi
ronment" by Nieves. may have been
one of the factors that led toToppel's
first night with less than 20 kills. The
freshman ended the night with only
eight kills, held to a .045 hitting per
centage.
"I think the environment got to
him," Nieves said. "The noise and in
tensity led to us breaking down on

some routine plays."
Without Toppel leading the
squad. King and Youngberg posted
the top number of kills with 10 apiece
and redshirt freshman Jon Palacios
stepped up and had a strong match in
his first appearance at middle blocker
this season. But their efforts weren't
good enough to account for Toppel.
Stanford also struggled with neu
tralizing USC's strong service game.
Senior setter Donald Suxho. a 1999
AVCA Ail-American and junior
outside hitter, Trevor Julian were
each able to collect three aces on the
night, contributing to the team's nine

total aces, while Stanford only se
cured four.
Though the Cardinal contained
last year's Asics/ Volleyball National
Co-Freshman of the Year, Brook
Billings, holding him to a .233 hitting
percentage, junior outside hitter Eli
Fairfield managed a .478 hitting per
centage and sophomore Beau Rawl
recorded a .714 percentage.
"This doesn't set the tone for the
rest of the season." Youngherg said.
"We have a much better idea of the
little things need to work on. We have
very good teamwork, now we need to
focus on the small details."

Brad, he gave us a third guy that we
could go to."
On defense Stanford was outdug
(31-26) and outblocked (14-3) by the
49ers. who Nieves considers tobe the
best team defensively that the Cardi
nal has faced this season.
"We need to pick up our defense
so we have something to fall back on
if we're not having a strong offensive
night." Graham said. "Digging more
balls is something we know we can
do, we just need to focus and get the
job done."
In the small. 8(X)-seat gym at IJSC
the following night. Stanford had sim
ilar problems and USC came away
with the 15-7, 15-7,15-10 victory.
Along with a strong Trojan team
that returned five of its six starters
from last year's squad. Stanford was
also forced to deal with a crowded
gym smaller than any other in the
conference.
The gym. called a "hostile envi
ronment" by Nieves. may have been
one of the factors that led toToppel's
first night with less than 20 kills. The
freshman ended the night with only
eight kills, held to a .045 hitting per
centage.
"I think the environment got to
him," Nieves said. "The noise and in
tensity led to us breaking down on

some routine plays."
Without Toppel leading the
squad. King and Youngberg posted
the top number of kills with 10 apiece
and redshirt freshman Jon Palacios
stepped up and had a strong match in
his first appearance at middle blocker
this season. But their efforts weren't
good enough to account for Toppel.
Stanford also struggled with neu
tralizing USC's strong service game.
Senior setter Donald Suxho. a 1999
AVCA Ail-American and junior
outside hitter, Trevor Julian were
each able to collect three aces on the
night, contributing to the team's nine

total aces, while Stanford only se
cured four.
Though the Cardinal contained
last year's Asics/ Volleyball National
Co-Freshman of the Year, Brook
Billings, holding him to a .233 hitting
percentage, junior outside hitter Eli
Fairfield managed a .478 hitting per
centage and sophomore Beau Rawl
recorded a .714 percentage.
"This doesn't set the tone for the
rest of the season." Youngherg said.
"We have a much better idea of the
little things need to work on. We have
very good teamwork, now we need to
focus on the small details."
