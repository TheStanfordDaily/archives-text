# Constitutional Council meets
## Shapiro elected council chair; procedures established 
### Alice Brown Editorial staff 
The ASSU's Constitutional Council met last night
for the first time in history. The council, established
to review possible violations of the ASSU constitu
tion, will begin hearing its first case next Sunday
night.
Chris Stromberg, a doctoral candidate in chem
istry and member of the Graduate Student Council,
has submitted a petition regarding the constitution
ality of the ASSU's funding of religious organiza
tions.
The main purpose of the meeting was to elect a
chair of the Constitutional Council and establish
rules of procedure. After Harris Shapiro, a doctoral
candidate in physics, was unanimously elected chair,
the topic of discussion turned to the logistics of case
review.
After an issue of constitutionality is raised, the
council is required to make a decision within two
weeks. A petition is submitted and the council then
meets within seven days to decide whether or not the
case is worth hearing and not "frivilous."
If it is agreed — by a majority vote — that the case
is in fact worth reviewing, the council meets again
within another seven days.
Shapiro emphasized that his primary goal was to
make Council meetings "as conducive to reasoned

discussion as possible."
In order to guard against overly emotional plead
ing — or "ranting and raving" — of the involved par
ties, Shapiro proposed that all arguments must be
submitted in writing. He added that this will prevent
those with better public speaking skills from having
an unfair advantage.
As matters of public record, written arguments
will be posted on the Web.
Senior Shaumo Sadhukhan, one of the other
council members, was the only person to vote against
Shapiro's proposal. He was concerned about denying
people the right to verbally argue their positions and
proposed that groups be allowed to petition the
council for the right to express their opinions orally.
Shapiro's rules passed, four votes to five.
The three additional members of the council are
sophomore David Lin, Elizabeth Loboa Polefka, a
doctoral candidate in mechanical engineering and
Robert Rudnitsky, a doctoral candidate in applied
physics.
About 15 people originally applied to become
members of the council, and ASSU President Mike
Levin said he found it difficult to make a final deci
sion.
"We were looking for a knowledgable person that
was new and bright, but had limited ASSU experi
ence," Levin explained. No paid or elected ASSU
member is eligible for the council.
