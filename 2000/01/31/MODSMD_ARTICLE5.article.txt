# Senate creates ASSU Publications
## Old publications board replaced; new effort headed by Mills 
### Alice Brown Editorial staff 
Last week the ASSU announced the creation of
ASSU Publications, part of the larger effort to
streamline and improve general fee distribution.
Led by ASSU Vice President John Mills, the
goal of this project is to help undergraduate student
publications who want the support and funding of
the ASSU.
"As with program and community service fund
ing, we have eliminated several steps in the publi
cations funding process to make it easier and faster
for a student publication to receive funding," Mills
said.
Under the new system, student publications
must submit an online budget form that is then re
viewed by the Undergraduate Senate Appropria
tions Committee. The group then awaits approval

from the full Undergraduate Senate at its next
meeting.
"It is really a much more convenient process
than before," Mills said.
This new system replaces the old ASSU Publi
cations Board, which was composed of representa
tives of various student publications. The Under
graduate Senate Appropriations Committee will
inherit the responsibilities of the Board.
"We wanted to bring the undergraduate sena
tors closer to their constituencies, and at the same
time hold them more accountable for students'
general fee money, which, ultimately, is their re
sponsibility to distribute," Mills said. "I'm still plan
ning to convene something along the lines of the
old Publications Board, which would no longer
have any capacity in the funding process, hut would
serve purely in an advisory capacity to the ASSU
Publications Director."
The ASSU originally advertised for a publica
tions director, but as the applicants had no ASSU
or student publication experience. Mills assumed
the job in order to insure a smooth transition.
Those familiar with the old Publications board

are widely in favor of the new system. "[The publi
cations board] was always a weak central authori
ty," said Harris Shapiro, a doctoral candidate in
physics and the chair of the ASSU's Constitutional
Council. "There was communal responsibility and
no way to organize it."
ASSU President Mike Levin added his support.
"The biggest problem with the Publications Board
was that the rest of the ASSU was completely de
tached from the decisions it made," he said. "ASSU
Publications has made the Undergraduate Senate
far more accountable for the way in which funds are
dispersed to new and existing publications."
MillS'TS*enthusiastic about his new position and
welcomes ideas and inquiries. "If you have an idea
for a new student publication and just need funding
and support, that's why we are here. A vibrant stu
dent press is so important to the intellectual and
creative life of any university, and ASSU Publica
tions will do all it can to foster that at Stanford."
