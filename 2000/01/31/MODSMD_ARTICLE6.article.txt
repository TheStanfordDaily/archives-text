### Colleen Acosta Editorial staff 
While there are those that may not
consider Stanford to be an excep
tionally politically active campus,

some students here seem to prove
the opposite.
Junior Alison Friedman is one of
these students. Recently appointed
as National Student Coordinator
for the Gore Campaign, Friedman

has taken a leave of absence to de
vote her time to Al Gore's cam
paign for the Democratic presiden
tial nomination.
Friedman is working at Gore's
campaign headquarters in Ten
nessee. Her duties as National Stu
dent Coordinator include working
with state and local contacts to ex
pand the student activist base at
high schools across the country.
One of the biggest projects that
Friedman handles is an internet
program called Clash of the Athlet
ic Conference.

High school students across the
country compete for leadership po
sitions at their high schools by rally
ing support for the Gore platform.
The winning school receives 10
passes to the National Democratic
Convention. By holding this com
petition, "students receive greater
exposure to current issues vital to
the US and world today," she said.
Friedman works 11-hour days
during the week and six-hour days
on the weekends and attends politi

cal events she helps to organize. She
said her typical work day includes
"e-mailing kids that want to be co
ordinators, organizing events for
the campaign, helping the (iore
campaign manager and a lot of
community service activities."
Friedman says that "one of the
best things about this job is that it is
a great opportunity for kids to be
school contacts," and that "it is neat
to be able to talk to students from
high schools all over the country."
Talking to kids isn't the only

thing Friedman enjoys " The peo
ple are phenomenal, all incredibly
passionate about working to give
youth a voice in government and to
make government more accessible
to students."
In the future, Friedman hopes to
stay politically active She hopes to
continue to work with kills, helping
them to rally around ha\ ing a voice
in government. Currently the youth
population has the largest number
of people ever working lo help and
serve communities. "Whatever I
can do to help with that.' she would
like to continue to do."
