The celebration of Founders'
Day on April 9 is one of the high
lights of Stanford University's
campus calendar. One of the fea
tures of this day, which is re
served to honor the Stanford
family and its achievements in
founding the University, is the
annual Founders' Day speech.
The Founders' Day speech
competition, which is three years
old, offers a $1,000 cash award to
one undergraduate student and

one graduate student for their
winning speeches. The two stu
dents will read their speeches in
Memorial Church as a part of the
Founders' Day activities.
Students must submit a copy
of their speech to be reviewed by
the Founders' Day student com
mittee, selected through the
ASSU Nominations Committee.
The committee is composed of
two students from each under
graduate class, and one student
from each of the seven graduate
schools.
The selection process is com

pletely student-run. The commit
tee will review all speeches in
terms of overall content. Speech
criteria require that speeches be
no longer than five minutes and
address the history of the Stan
ford family or of the founding of
Stanford University, what Stan
ford means to the speaker and
how it has affected his or her life,
or how Stanford affects the
world.
"Judges will be looking for in
teresting, creative, thoughtful,
and passionate speeches," Dean
of Students Marc Wais wrote in a

statement.
In the second and final stage of
the selection process, a small
group of finalists deliver its
speeches in front of the selection
committee. One undergraduate
and one graduate winner, as well
as an alternate, is chosen from
the finalists.
The speech contest is held "in
the hopes of increasing student
awareness and participation in
Founders* Day," said Wais. He
emphasized that, as Founders'
