## Rams earn first Superbowl win 
### 
ATLANTA (AF) — A game of
yards came down to inches for the
St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl.
The Rams stopped the Ten
nessee Titans at the 1-yard line on a
final, heart-stopping play to save
their 23-16 victory in one of foot
ball's most thrilling finishes ever.
Kurt Warner's 73-yard touch
down pass to Isaac Bruce with 1
minute, 54 seconds left accounted
for the winning score, 16 seconds
after Al Del Greco's field goal
brought Tennessee back from a 16-
0 deficit.
But it took Mike Jones' tackle of
Kevin Dyson at the 1 to finally give
St. Louis the win Sunday night.
Dyson was left sprawled on the
ground in Jones' arms, stretching
the ball toward the goal line in vain
as the game clock turned to zeros.
So, a team known for its high
powered offense won its first Super
Bowl with the most memorable of
defensive plays.
Warner passed for a Super Bowl
record 414 yards and was voted
MVP, capping a season that began
with him fighting for a backup job
and ended with him as the NFL's
MVP.
The championship for Warner,
coach Dick Vermeil and the Rams
seemed no more than a dream six
months ago after a 4-12 season in
1998.
"Kurt Warner is Kurt Warner
and it's not a fairy tale," Vermeil
said. "He is a book. He is a movie."
Added Warner: "You may think
of this as a Hollywood story, but it's
just my life."
But he almost had to rewrite the
script after the Titans scored on
three straight drives to tie the score
at 16.
Tennessee's comeback was engi
neered by Steve McNair and Eddie
George. But it was Dyson who
almost pulled off his second miracle
finish in four weeks, coming up just
short of the tying touchdown after
taking a look-in pass from McNair
at the 5 and scrambling for the end
zone.
"1 thought we could do it but we
came up about 6 inches from having
a chance to do it," Titans coach Jeff
Fisher said. "As much as this hurts

we have an awful lot of pride in
coming so close."
Dyson was the man at the end til
the "Music City Miracle," the 22-16
win over Buffalo in a wild-card
game, taking a lateral from Frank
Wycheck and returning it 75 yards

for the winning touchdown with
three seconds left.
"I thought he was going to get
in." McNair said. "But you've got
great athletes on both sides of the
ball and they nmde the play. It was a
matter of who won the one-on-one

battle and they won it."
It was the first NFL, title for the
Rams since 1951 and the first loot
ball title ever for St. Louis, which
lost the Cardinals after the 1987 sea
son and gained the Rams from Los
Angeles in 1995.
