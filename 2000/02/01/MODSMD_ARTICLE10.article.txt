# Students at Oxford deciding to stay abroad concern those on wait list
## Policy of granting extended stays reduces odds for students waiting to go overseas 
### EILEEN CHAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Some students on the waitlist for
the Oxford Overseas Program are
concerned that they have been
humped down on the waiting list,
due to the decision of students cur
rently in ()xford to extend their stay.

Overseas Studies Program offi
cials said that this is a normal occur
rence. The Overseas Studies con
trad, which all overseas applicants
sign, outlines three situations in
which students can request an ex
tension of their stay: before the ap
plication deadline, in which case the
request is automatically accepted;
after the application deadline hut be
fore the fourth Friday of the quarter
before the quarter the student plans
to go abroad, in which case the stu
dent is placed at the top of the wait
ing list; or after the fourth Friday, in
which case the student's name is
added to the bottom of the waiting

list.
Junior Saimah Ashraf, who was
accepted into the Oxford spiing
program, believes this system causes
trouble for people on the waiting list.
"I understand that people can ex
tend their visit," Ashraf said, "but
[the system] should have a time limit
or at least have them decide early so
people will know early on if they can
go. It really messes up their sched
ules if they find out [late in the quar
ter]. Also, il they find out earlier, they
can get their tickets earlier and
cheaper."
Overseas Studies has already
started notifying students of their

enrollment status, according to Ham
McNaughton, ()verseas Studies pre>-
gram officer. But there is always a
flux of students, depending on how
many extend or curtail their time in
()xford.
"There t eallv isn't ,1 set number of
students," she said. "People (abroad)
can continue to change their status
throughout the quarter. Of course,
there are also fines for students who
make up their minds later."
Nevertheless, Ashraf said she
feels that overseas students' deci
sions unfairly affect the chances of
students still at Stanford.
"It's unfair to have wait-listed

people go down on the wait list,"
Ashraf said. "[Overseas Studies!
should give people who haven't
been to ()xfbrd a chance to go."
According to McNaughton, de
spite the slnlt of some waiting list
rankings, the Overseas Studies Pro
gram is trying to give everyone a
chance.
"We try to si lift our priority back
and forth everyone has equal op
portunity,-' she said.
Senior Shaflique Adam, who is on
the waiting list, agrees that the pro
gram is doing all it can.
"They made it pretty clear that
those who are currently at Oxford

would get preference over us,"
Adam said. "From the very begin
ning, I knew what was going 011 and
what the procedures were. I want to
go on the program, but I wouldn't
blame them [if I couldn't go], be
cause they try their best to be fair."
McNaughton encourages stu
dents with problems to voice their
worries to the (Kerseas Studies Pro
gram.
"Students who have concerns
should definitely come talk to us,"
she said. "Some may have the flexi
bility to reapply next year. [Some
times) it seems to them that they only
have a limited chance of getting in."
