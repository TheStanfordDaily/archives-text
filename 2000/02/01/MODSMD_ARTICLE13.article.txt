Candidates scranible for
last-minute votes in the nations
first presidential primary
NASHUA, N.I I. (AP) — The presidential
candidates shoveled snow, Hipped pancakes
and trudged through the slushy streets ol
New Hampshire yesterday, waging hand
shake-it (-handshake combat to the finish ol
their hard-fought primary races.
Willi the- field puzzling over ways to get
supporters to voting booths, Sen. John
McCain joked that he had the answer.
"Death threats," the Arizona Republican
said. "11 they don't go out and don't vote for
McCain, then don't start your car lor the
next week."'
Kidding aside, the stakes were high for
McCain who badly needs a victor) in his
nomination fight with better-financed
George W. Bush.
Bush is seeking a coine-froni-behind vie-

Tory here to burnish his front-running
national campaign, while staunch conserva
tives Steve Forbes, Alan Reyes and Clary
Bauer are trying to show they still have a
chance.
"I'm confident of victory," McCain said,
turning live outdoor rallies into virtual victo
ry laps around the state as polls gave him a
slight edge. "1 like my chances a lot," said
Bush, who went from photo op to photo op
as his aides said momentum was on his side,
even if time wasn't.
Democrats A 1 Gore and Bill Bradley were
locked in race that could determine the stay
ing power of Bradley's insurgent campaign.
"We're closing fast," Bradley declared, as
polls showed the former New Jersey senator
trailing Gore but posing a threat in their bit
terly fought race. As the day wore on,
Bradley and his campaign grew more reflec
tive as lie talked about his 30 years of travel
ing the country.
"Now it's up to you if my public service
will be fulfilled," Bradley said at a Manch

ester rally. Bradley has enough money to
weather a New Hampshire loss more easily
than McCain.
The candidates' schedules were all made
for TV, though one photo opportunity
didn't turn out as planned for the struggling
Bauer campaign. He tumbled off the stage
during a pancake flipping demonstration.
The griddle pan was bent, but the candidate
was unhurt and unbowed: "I'm a survivor,"
Bauer said, recognizing the political symbol
ism.
Bush Hipped pancakes, too. The Texas
governor also toured a crime lab and
stopped at a bowling alley and a sledding hill
— speeding down in a red, white and blue
innertube with 13-year-old twins Lizzy and
Laura Saggau of Merrimack. A downtown
stroll was canceled when pro-marijuana
protesters showed up in Exeter.
Gore was out before dawn, shaking hands
in the pelting freezing rain outside the Lock
heed Sanders plant and later meeting with
senior citizens at a nursing home.
