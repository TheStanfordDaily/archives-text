# Weather delays space shuttle launch

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Computer
trouble and bad weather forced NASA to delay the
launch of the spat e shuttle Endeavour yesterday on
a quest to create the most accurate map of Earth
ever produced.
Launch managers said they would try again
today, but only if the computer problem can be
solved quickly.
Liftoff time would be 12:44 p.m.
"If we don't understand it to the point where we
know we are safe . . . then we will not launch," shut
tle program manager Ron Dittemore said.
"We can always take the time to change the box."
Dittemore said the launch would have to be
delayed a week in order to replace the computerized
unit, called a master events controller. It is a critical
component.

Two identical controllers are on board, and
both are needed to send signals to ignite the two
solid rocket boosters at lilt oil'and to later separate
the boosters and external fuel tank from the shut
tle.
The mission is already four months late because
of damaged wiring that had to be fixed on Endeav
our and the other shuttles.
The computer trouble cropped up with less than
a half-hour remaining in the countdown.
Even without the problem, Endeavour could not
have lifted oil because of rain and thick, dark
clouds.
NASA went all the way down to the nine-minute
mark as engineers scrambled to understand why
one of the two controllers sent a series of erroneous
signals during a pre-launch check.
