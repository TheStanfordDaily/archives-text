Published Since 1891

BY NOW, YOU'VE PROBA
BLY scanned tlie front page,
flipped through some pages of
news, and have found yourself
here, wanting an explanation.
And we've certainly got one to give.
Ibday not only rings in the 217 th vol
ume of The Daily, bringing with it a new
and excited crop of writers and editors, but
also a fresh and different design for The
Daily. It's been nearly 12 years since we've
had a new look for the paper, and now is
the time we've picked to change that.
After much planning, discussion and
hard work, here is the product of our
experiment in design. Now we're left to
continue fine-tuning it, and, of course, to
await the results â€” what do you, as read
ers, think of our new look?
Our efforts have been geared towards
giving I he Daily a more streamlined and
modern look, and we're eager to hear
what vou think about it. As we've worked

with different layouts, we have been focus
ing on presenting our content in a more
viewer-friendly fashion, while retaining
the same flavor and essence that makes up
our payer.
This is not to say, however, that our re
design is solely focused on the aesthetic.
With the re-vamping of the paper also
come some fundamental changes in con
tent that we hope will expand our cover
age of the Stanford community and keep
our readers better informed of their uni
versity and beyond.
On our news and opinions pages, you
will begin to notice changes in coverage as
we begin to include pieces on events and
issues outside of Stanford that are com
pelling and significant for our readers.
Our aim is to become a more balanced
news source, while retaining the Stanford
focus that so defines our paper and the
issues that we strive to cover.
This theme extends to our sports and

Intermission sections as well, and in great
part to our science page, which is probably
the section receiving the most extensive
content make-over.
Our science page will now be expanded
to three to four pages a week, and will be
titled Innovation, reflecting its new focus
on both science and technology at Stan
ford. What does it mean to Stanford and
its students to be a key part of Silicon Val
ley and to be contributing to and molding
the Valley's new ideas? As an institution
with a strong foundation in the humani
ties, how does Stanford define itself in
terms of its emergent role in the Valley?
The ideas and people behind the re
design and new coverage at The Daily are
what will define the paper as this volume
continues. But we ask our readers to con
tribute to this definition and to actively dis
agree or agree when they see fit. Our place
as a paper on this campus rests on your
commentary.

While the redesign is something that
has taken the past few months, it's some
thing I feel I've been thinking about for a
long time. I walked into the Daily offices
the fall of my freshman year and knew
back then that I'd never leave them in my
time here at Stanford.
Something about the paper kept me
coming back and, to this day, I've never
been able to define quite what it is. I just
know that it exists, and it keeps me think
ing and re-thinking The Daily, how it
operates, what it covers, and how it pre
sents and defines itself as a newspaper.
The new look of The Daily, as well as its
expansion of content, are two of the many
factors that will keep me thinking about
the changes and challenges we can take on
as a newspaper. I know it will keep me on
my toes, and that's exactly the way I like it.
