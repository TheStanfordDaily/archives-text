### PATRICK BERNHARDT BUSINESS MANAGER 
The
includes several new features
that we hope will make it
easier to navigate and read

I () ()l R RFADKRS: I his morning marks
the culmination of several months ol wot k
designed to bring a new look and feel to
our newspaper. I here are new features
and typograph\ throughout the paper,
and more will he unveiled over the course
ol the next two weeks.
Main of these changes are the direct
result ol our November readet ship survey,
in which almost 1,000 ol our readers
ollered their suggestions on how we might
improve the paper.
Overall, we believe the new design is
more modern and professional. We've
tried to organize information in ways that
will make it more easily understood. We've
also tried to give von as much information
as possible up-front, not hidden six para
graphs deep in a story.
I hat said, here's a quirk look at some of
the changes you can see today and a pre
view ol the ones you'll see in the next few
weeks:
1) New text font. We've adopted a new
font fbi our stories: Haskerville. Named
lot its designer |olm Haskerville, the font
was originally created in F.nglancl in 1752
and has been used in typesetting large
bodies of text fin almost 250 years. After
months of research we settled on
Haskerville to replace our old version of'
the stalwart limes, because it's easier to
read, cuts a more interesting profile and
allows us to squeeze in a couple of extra
words per paragraph.
2) New headlines. Our headlines are
now printed in Minion, a modern font
inspired by type faces from the late Renais
sance. We've joined a long line of newspa
pers employing Minion for headlines,
because it's elegant and relatively skinny,
which lets us tell you more about stories in
the space available.
;t) A second section. Starting next Mon
day, The Daily will he printed in two sec
tions, four clays each week. On Mondays
aticl Fridays, sports will get the front of the
second section. On Thursdays our enter
tainment magazine. Inlet mission, will
debut as a section of the regular newspa
per instead of a separate magazine. And
on Tuesdays you'll find a revitalized and

-CTcpandcrt science and technology section
Trrrhc 'li'slot. So what about Wednesdays?
We're going to save that space for now,
hoping that someone will come to us with
an outstanding idea for a nf-w section.
4) Behind-the-scenes boxes. In every
section we now print the names and
responsibilities of the stall members who
put their time into putting out the page or
pages. Our first goal was to provide a little
more recognition to the people who work
for us. Second, we wanted to make sure
that when you have a question, comment,
or suggestion, you could easily figure out
whom to (all or e-mail.
5) Larger page
