Stanford should update
wheelchair accessibility
It is perhaps a historical impossibility
to expect any significant social change
without a degree of struggle. Moreover,
even after the struggle is ovei and laws
are enacted to correct for situations that
are commonly perceived as unjust, such
laws never prove a sufficient condition for
change •unless enforcement is married
with more struggle.
Even after acknowledging the afore
mentioned, I was still bewildered after
realizing that the following situation con
stitutes the center and peripheries of my
alma-matter's geometry.
Let's imagine the following life of a fel
low Stanfordite. Josefa Woods is your
average Stanford student: smart, idealistic
and passionate about too many things. If
only time weren't a linear constraint she
would probably be at three places at the
same time.
In this context, shopping for classes is
as easy as understanding the Zarathustra
on first draft. It takes her some time to get
to one of her eight potential classes, but,
once she is in the building, she realizes the
class is forbidden to her; it is a second
floor c lass.
Getting to the class does not constitute
a problem if you are walking, hut if there
is no elevator and you left your wings in
your other life, being in a wheelchair
means Josefa cannot take this class.
You see, federal law requires all build
ings to be wheelchair accessible, but at
Stanford, unarguably the best university

in the world, very few buildings comply
with the law (makes you wonder how one
measures one's own best-ness). In this
context, Josefa is left on her own:
1.) Pleading to her teachers to change
c lasses to first floors;
2.) Receiving angry looks from profes
sors and students that are burdened by
the change;
3.) Having to forgo checking her mail
because she cannot get to the temporary
post office;
4.) Feeling like the school is doing her
a favor by building a little ramp here or
there;
5.) Feeling like a slave to the physical
surroundings of her own school;
(').) Unable to struggle against the
administration because she has midterms,
finals and innumerable activities to
attend.
7.) But worse of all, listening to people
say, "You knew Stanford was inaccessible.
Nobody forced you to come here."
By not complying with federal law,
Stanford University sends a very clear
message to our community: that it is OK
to discriminate on the basis of physical
conditions; that it is OK to make a human
being feel inadequate; that it is in fact a
favor to allow anyone with physical con
straints to attend classes or even check the
mail, so shut up and give thanks.
But not rallying with fellow students to
force the administration to comply with
federal law sends a much stronger and
sadder message: that our generation is
essentially gutless to struggle and heartless
enough to be comfortable among injus

tices that do not affect our daily reality.

"Tragedy" too strong for basketball
Your headline writer might temper
her or his descriptions a bit: "85-83
tragedy shocks Cardinal women lioop
sters" (Jan. 28). In spite of all the media,
money and excitement, a basketball game
is just that, a game. Tragedies abound,
both here and abroad, but this doesn't
qualify.
