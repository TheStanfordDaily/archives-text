Today at noon in White Plaza,
the Black Community Services
Center celebrates the start of Black
History Month.
The celebration began as a
week-long commemoration of
contributions of African Ameri
cans, and was initiated by Carter
G. Woodson in 1926. During the
Black Power Movement of the
19705, it was expanded to span
one month.
Around the same time, in 1972,
members of the Stanford Black
community placed their own mark
on the campus celebration, re
naming it Black Liberation Month
— a name that has remained for
almost three decades.
During this year's Black Liber
ation Month, the Black Communi
ty Services Center along with
many black volunteer student or

"Looking Back as We Push For

Achievement in the Next Millenni

While volunteer groups spon
sor the events, the student-run
Black Liberation Month Commit

"It's exciting to be a part of the
planning of this month's events,"
said junior Ayaba Worjoloh, tylack
Liberation Month co-chair. *We
have planned a month of continu
ous exposure of many aspects of
the Black experience."
New events this year include an
address by writer and former
MTV Real World cast member
Kevin Powell, a weekly film series
and an art exhibit sponsored by
the Committee on Black Perform
ing Arts.
The month also includes annu
al programs such as Gospel Ex
travaganza, an exhibition of the
Stanford Gospel Choir and other
Bay Area gospel choirs, and Get
