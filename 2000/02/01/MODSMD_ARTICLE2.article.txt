## Weekly film series and art exhibit headline this year's festivities 
### SHANNON M. ASHFORD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Today at noon in White Plaza,
the Black Community Services
Center celebrates the start of Black
History Month.
The celebration began as a
week-long commemoration of
contributions of African Ameri
cans, and was initiated by Carter
G. Woodson in 1926. During the
Black Power Movement of the
19705, it was expanded to span
one month.
Around the same time, in 1972,
members of the Stanford Black
community placed their own mark
on the campus celebration, re
naming it Black Liberation Month
— a name that has remained for
almost three decades.
During this year's Black Liber
ation Month, the Black Communi
ty Services Center along with
many black volunteer student or
ganizations will sponsor program
ming concurrent with the theme,
"Looking Back as We Push For
ward: Perspectives on B4«wik
Achievement in the Next Millenni
um."
While volunteer groups spon
sor the events, the student-run
Black Liberation Month Commit
tee plans, organizes and fundrais
es for many of them.
"It's exciting to be a part of the
planning of this month's events,"
said junior Ayaba Worjoloh, tylack
Liberation Month co-chair. *We
have planned a month of continu
ous exposure of many aspects of
the Black experience."
New events this year include an
address by writer and former
MTV Real World cast member
Kevin Powell, a weekly film series
and an art exhibit sponsored by
the Committee on Black Perform
ing Arts.
The month also includes annu
al programs such as Gospel Ex
travaganza, an exhibition of the
Stanford Gospel Choir and other
Bay Area gospel choirs, and Get
Down Diaspora, a showcase o! per
formance groups representing the
cultural diversity among groups of
African des< ent.
Other annual events are a poet
ry open-mic night at the Coffee
House, a Black Liberation Month
essay contest and the Soul Food
Dinner.
"Our programming represents
the broad cross-section of the tal
ent within our community, as well
as the volunteer student organiza
tions that are sponsoring events
this year," said |ames Jordan, as
sistant director of the Black Com

munity Services Center and advi
sor to the Black Liberation Month
Committee.
Additionally, dorm cafeteria ta
bles will have weekly lliers that
highlight influential African-
American figures.
"Primarily, we hope that people
accept this as a campus-wide out
reach to create awareness for
everyone, not just Black students
01 students of colpr," said Wor
joloh.
These events are made possible
by donations from University de
partments, student and staff
groups and dormitories.
