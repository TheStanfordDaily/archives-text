## Wrestlers pull out last-ditch victory 
### MATT LONG 
Stanford falls Friday to Oregon State
but rebounds Saturday with a 19-18
victory over Portland State that
comes down to the final match

Stanford wrestlers stood tall this weekend in two
tough Pacific 10 Conference matches, splitting with a
loss to 20th-ranked Oregon State on Friday and over
powering undermanned Portland State Saturday.
Brad Selby, a relative newcomer to collegiate
wrestling, won a 2-1 overtime decision Saturday to
clinch the Cardinal's 19-18 victory.
Oregon State (8-4,4-1), lx)asting four nationally
ranked wrestlers, beat the Cardinal (2-4,1-4) 22-13.
Stanford senior Zach Zimmerer, ranked 13th at 133
pounds, remained undefeated at 10-0 for the season
by posting two pins for the weekend, the first over the
Beaver's Mike Delaney and the second Saturday in a
remarkable 1 minutes and 43 seconds over Portland
State's John Pasana.
"1 ielt good over the weekend," Zimmerer said. "I
was dealing with injuries from last week's match, and
was glad to see they healed."
Zimmerer went into the meet expecting to wrestle
Ben Richards, ranked second in the Pac-10. Richards
was sidelined due to injury, though, so Delaney
turned out to be the opponent.
"These guys weren't the best in the Pac-10, but I'm
working on a lot of stuff," Zimmerer said. "It's my se
nior year and stuffs coming together, but I feel like
I've learned more this year than in any other of my
19 years wrestling."
Redshirt Freshman Selby also impressed in his
two matches. A reserve offensive lineman on the
Stanford football team, Selby wrestled heavyweight
in his first collegiate bout and first time on the mat
since 1998 in high school.

Selby's 2-1
overtime victory
gave Stanford a
19-18 win over
the Vikings.
Friday, Selby fought No. 8
heavyweight Jason Cooley. Unin
timidated, Selby fell 5-2 to Cooley
and came out aggresively the next
evening to earn the clinching win
over Portland State's Randy David
son, who usually wrestles 197
pounds but was forced to move up
a weight class due to the Vikings'
lack of a heavyweight.
Another bright spot for the Car
dinal was senior Warren McPher
son in the 157 pound class.
McPherson was a huge underdog
against Oregon State's Eric Jor
gensen, who carried in a 21-match
win streak and a No. 4 ranking.
The pair fought the seven minute
match to a draw as each scored only
with an escape. Jorgensen saved his
ranking with a takedown in sucl
den-death overtime to end the dra
matic duel.
"I felt I was upset by the OSU
guy," McPherson said. "I should
have beaten him."
The following night McPherson
faced little challenge as he earned a
major decision (11-3) over Port
land's Ron I lolyoak.
"I wrestled OK against Portland
State," Mc Pherson said. "I was still
not where I wanted to be."
In addition, Stanford's Andy
Hunter. Clay Hackerman, No. 20
Rudy Rui/ and Levi Weikel-Mag
den all earned wins over the week
end.
"We wrestled better than last
weekend against Davis (a 23-12
loss)," team co-captain Zimmerer
said. "I was disappointed to lose to
()t egon State in duals, because I've
never beaten them, but it looks like
as a team we have room to peak be
fore the Pac-1 0 championships."
Next Friday night the Cardinal
will host its final home meet of the
year, squaring off against Pac-10
rival Cal-State Fullerton at 7 p.m.
in Burnham Pavilion.
