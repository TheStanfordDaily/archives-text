## Wrestlers pull out last-ditch victory 
### MATT LONG 
Stanford falls Friday to Oregon State
but rebounds Saturday with a 19-18
victory over Portland State that
comes down to the final match

Stanford wrestlers stood tall this weekend in two
tough Pacific 10 Conference matches, splitting with a
loss to 20th-ranked Oregon State on Friday and over
powering undermanned Portland State Saturday.
Brad Selby, a relative newcomer to collegiate
wrestling, won a 2-1 overtime decision Saturday to
clinch the Cardinal's 19-18 victory.
Oregon State (8-4,4-1), lx)asting four nationally
ranked wrestlers, beat the Cardinal (2-4,1-4) 22-13.
Stanford senior Zach Zimmerer, ranked 13th at 133
pounds, remained undefeated at 10-0 for the season
by posting two pins for the weekend, the first over the
Beaver's Mike Delaney and the second Saturday in a
remarkable 1 minutes and 43 seconds over Portland
State's John Pasana.
"1 ielt good over the weekend," Zimmerer said. "I
was dealing with injuries from last week's match, and
was glad to see they healed."
Zimmerer went into the meet expecting to wrestle
Ben Richards, ranked second in the Pac-10. Richards
was sidelined due to injury, though, so Delaney
turned out to be the opponent.
"These guys weren't the best in the Pac-10, but I'm
working on a lot of stuff," Zimmerer said. "It's my se
nior year and stuffs coming together, but I feel like
I've learned more this year than in any other of my
19 years wrestling."
Redshirt Freshman Selby also impressed in his
two matches. A reserve offensive lineman on the
Stanford football team, Selby wrestled heavyweight
in his first collegiate bout and first time on the mat
since 1998 in high school.
