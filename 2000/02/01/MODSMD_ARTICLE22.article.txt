Sophomore Foschi proved her Ail-American fresh
man year was no fluke this weekend, winning four
individual events over two meets for the No. 3 Stan
ford women's swimming team. The Cardinal split
the meets with No. 15 UCLA and No. 4 USC.

Jarron (pictured) and twin brother Jason Collins
combined to hit 20 of 22 shots from the field in
Stanford's blowout wins over Washington and
Washington State last weekend. Against the
Cougars Saturday, neither missed a shot.
