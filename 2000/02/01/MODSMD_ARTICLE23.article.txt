# Men's rugby topples No.6 'Cats
## 
### JON COHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Battered by injuries and illness,
the Cardinal fights through a scoreless
first half to pull out a 20-10 win.

It wasn't always pretty, but on Saturday night at
New Maloney Field, the Stanford men's rugby team
proved that it's for real, staying unbeaten with a 20-10
victory over No. 6 Arizona.
After four victories over mediocre opponents, the
unranked Cardinal (5-0, 1-0 Pacific Coast League)
came into Saturday's matchup with the Wildcats look
ing to establish that it is just as good as its record indi
cates.
Though Stanford did not play its best game, the
Cardinal came up big when it needed to, earning both
the victory and some respect.

It was a mistake-filled game, with both sides squan
dering several scoring opportunities.
In the first half, neither team could break through
the other's defense — Stanford missed an early penal
ty kick — and at halftime the two teams were locked in
a scoreless tie.
"Arizona had a good backline defense," senior Eli
Frankel said. "And they thwarted our offense in the
first half."
After Arizona went ahead 3-0 early in the second
half on a penalty goal, Stanford came storming back,
scoring two penalty goals and a try to take a 13-3 lead.
The Wildcats soon cut the lead to just three, but the
Cardinal scored another try of its own and then held
on for the final 10-point margin.
Coming into the game, Stanford's average margin
of victory was 35 points, and this weekend's tight con
test was due to both Arizona's talent and the Cardinal's
sloppy play.
"We were a bit flat," Frankel said, "but part of this
was due to the fact that some of our
guys were sick and hurt."
A number of Stanford players,
among them senior IJorut Crgic
and sophomore Forrest Cherlone
(who weaved his way through the
Wildcat defense to score the Cardi
nal's first try) played despite bad
fevers.
Senior Che Holloway played
with a pad on a broken wrist he suf
fered last week.
The Arizona team was not at 112 ull
strength either, however, as star
player Chris Kron was traveling
with the U.S. national sevens team.
Still, the victory over a ranked
opponent, along with the Cardi
nal's unblemished record, should

be enough to boost Stanford into
the national rankings.
But Stanford's head coach
Franck Boivert, while appreciating
the win, said bis team can do better.
"The players were disorganized
because of the sicknesses." Boivert
said, "And they lost a little bit of
focus."
Saturday's game was the second
in a row in which the Cardinal
failed to live up to its capabilities.
"Saint Mary's [two weeks ago]
was our peak performance,"
Frankel said, "and it's been down
bill from there."
Next weekend the Cardinal re
turns to conference play Saturday
at 1 p.m. when league rival Hum
boldt State comes to town, and it
wants nothing more than to reverse
the downward trend.
"I hope we wake up for that
one," Boivert said.
