Open success, Marissa
Irvin leads Stanford
women past Huskies,
Cougars on the road

The state of Washington is in re
covery.
Over the weekend, the Stanford
women's tennis team (5-0, 3-0)
paid the state a visit â€” a quick,
deadly visit.
The top-ranked Cardinal con
ceded only one point in its victory
over No. 23 Washington on Friday.
Then, on Saturday, the Cardinal
swept No. 34 Washington State, 9-
0.
"I was real worried about Wash
ington," said head coach Frank
Brennan. "They took Duke to 3-3
in singles in Hawaii, and Duke's
one of the country's top programs.
Also, our team was a little more re
laxed than it shpuld've been."
After Brennan gave the team a
thorough pep talk, however, the
players were prepared for whatev
er the I luskies had to offer.
Although some of the singles
matches were close, the Cardinal
won thanks to superior talent and
experience.
"The Washington girls were in
variably going to be great on their
indoor home courts," Brennan
said. "They'd played more mean
ingful matches this season than we
had. We lost some sets in the be
ginning, and it was looking tight.
But we pulled through."
Sophomore Marissa Irvin, who
finished last season ranked second
nationally, played her lirst colle
giate match of the season against
Washington's Kristina Kraszewski
after causing a stir on the proles

sional tour earlier this month.
Irvin upset 35th-ranked Corina
Morariu in the first round of the
Australian Open in Melbourne,
Australia, before falling to eventual
champion Lindsay Davenport, 7-5,
6-4.
"I was really happy with the way
I played against Davenport," Irvin
said. "It was a confidence booster.
But I'm definitely happy to be back
with the team. College tennis and
pro tennis are just different. You
can't compare the two."
Irvin is now back on campus
and plans to play lor the Cardinal
for the rest of the season.
