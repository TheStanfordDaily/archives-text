Open success, Marissa
Irvin leads Stanford
women past Huskies,
Cougars on the road

The state of Washington is in re
covery.
Over the weekend, the Stanford
women's tennis team (5-0, 3-0)
paid the state a visit â€” a quick,
deadly visit.
The top-ranked Cardinal con
ceded only one point in its victory
over No. 23 Washington on Friday.
Then, on Saturday, the Cardinal
swept No. 34 Washington State, 9-
0.
"I was real worried about Wash
ington," said head coach Frank
Brennan. "They took Duke to 3-3
in singles in Hawaii, and Duke's
one of the country's top programs.
Also, our team was a little more re
laxed than it shpuld've been."
After Brennan gave the team a
thorough pep talk, however, the
players were prepared for whatev
er the I luskies had to offer.
Although some of the singles
matches were close, the Cardinal
won thanks to superior talent and
experience.
"The Washington girls were in
variably going to be great on their
indoor home courts," Brennan
said. "They'd played more mean
ingful matches this season than we
had. We lost some sets in the be
ginning, and it was looking tight.
But we pulled through."
Sophomore Marissa Irvin, who
finished last season ranked second
nationally, played her lirst colle
giate match of the season against
Washington's Kristina Kraszewski
after causing a stir on the proles

sional tour earlier this month.
Irvin upset 35th-ranked Corina
Morariu in the first round of the
Australian Open in Melbourne,
Australia, before falling to eventual
champion Lindsay Davenport, 7-5,
6-4.
"I was really happy with the way
I played against Davenport," Irvin
said. "It was a confidence booster.
But I'm definitely happy to be back
with the team. College tennis and
pro tennis are just different. You
can't compare the two."
Irvin is now back on campus
and plans to play lor the Cardinal
for the rest of the season.
On Friday, Irvin topped the
10th-ranked Kraszewski, 6-3, 6-4.
She followed up her win over
Kraszewski with a 6-1, 6-1 pasting
of Washington State's Patrycja
Gajdzik on Saturday.
"Washington's a tough oppo
nent, especially at home, indoors,"
she said.
"But our whole team performed
well."
Freshman Laura Granville, who
won the ITA Regional Champi
onships in November and is now
ranked second nationally, also won
both her singles matches easily.
"Laura's a great competitor,"
Brennan said. "She gets up for
every match."

Brennan was equally impressed
by the play of sophomore (labriela
Lastra, who took both her matches
in straight sets.
"1 see Lastra picking it up," he
said. "I'm quite happy with her ef
fort in her matches. She's realizing
that she was No. 3 last year, and
now she's No. 5.
"She's beginning to pick up the
pace."
The Cardinal's only loss came
on Friday at the No. 3 singles posi
tion, as senior Teryn Ashley fell to
Ilona Kordonskaya, 7-5. 6-4.
"I've beaten that girl twice be
fore," Ashley said. "I learned from
it. Being the only one that lost all
weekend makes me feel a little
worse."
Ashley redeemed hersell on Sat
urday with an easy straight-set vic
tory over Cougai Anna Maria
Moura.

Sophomore Keiko Tokuda sat
out the singles of the weekend's
dual matches despite her 38th na
tional ranking. Tokuda, who
reached the semifinals of the Na
tional Collegiate Tennis Classic
earlier this month, currently holds
the seventh position on the team
ladder but hopes to participate in
enough dual matches this season to
qualify fbi the NCAA Individual
tournament.
Although she didn't play sin
gles, lokuda, partnering with
Granville at the No. 2 spot, did con
tribute to the Cardinal's victories
with stellar doubles pla).
l'oday the Cardinal faces Pacific
at the Taube Family Tennis Stadi
um at 1:30 p.m.
"They always bring a solid
team," Brennan said. "But nothing
too spectacular. I'm looking for
ward to it."
