# Tropical winds blow sailing team to impressive finishes
## Hawaii, Key West draw Cardinal sailors for weekend of racing and relaxation 
### NATHANIEL TULLOCH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Various members of the Stanford sailing
team arrived back from Hawaii last week after
a 112 ull weekend of relaxing, windsurfing, sun
bathing, beaching and, occasionally, racing.
The Rainbow Invite, hosted by the Uni
versity of Hawaii, drew 10 teams, mostly from
the Islands and the West coast. Stanford sent
senior captain Tyler Doyle and freshman
crew Lindsay Andrews to race in the A divi
sion and freshmen Fed Conrads and Kara
Sweeney to compete in the B division; fresh
man Sara Zukerman went along as heavy-air
crew.
With beautiful weather and winds increas
ing from 15 to 20 knots on both days, the race
committee managed 12 races for each fleet.

"Basically," Doyle said, "they kept us out
there until the wind got kind of ridiculous,
with people ripping sails and breaking stuff."
Doyle himself lost a batten during one
race, but the mishap did not seem to hurt his
performance overall.
"It was a good intro to heavy-air sailing for
our crews who haven't really experienced it
before," he said.
The Stanford practice area in Redwood
City does not gel much breeze until at least
spring quarter, so freshmen on the team have
not yet practiced in the those conditions.
Doyle and Andrews held a fairly consistent
performance of mostly third- and fourth
place finishes to hold third place in A division
overall, one point ahead of Hawaii and two
points ahead of Western Washington.
Conrads and Sweeney, called over-early
on the line twice, had a less consistent regatta
but ended up with enough first and second
places to hold second place in B fleet. The
combined scores put Stanford in third place
overall for the event, behind Hawaii in first
and USC in second.

"I thought it was a really successful week
end and a great way to start the quarter,"
Doyle said.
Most people seemed to agree.
"I had an awesome time," Sweeney said.
"It was one of the best weekends I've had all
year."
Besides the recent dinghy regatta in Hawaii,
the Cardinal sailors were also represented in
the Key West Race Week hosted at the other
end of the country for much bigger boats. Se
nior captain Anika Leerssen competed on a
l>oat from her hometown of Newport, R.I.
One of the biggest annual cruising line re
gattas hosted in the United States, and prob
ably the biggest to be held in winter, Key West
Race Week attracts both domestic and inter
national participants. More than 200 boats
raced this year in 16 classes: some one-design,
some PHRF scored (Performance Handi
capped Racing Fleet).
PHRF scoring allows boats of different
makes and sizes to race against each other by
timing the finishes and adding handicaps to
those boats whose designs are inherently

faster.
Leerssen raced on a 40-foot custom-built
Thompson HO named VVairere in PHRF class
E. She faced off with 13 other boats, mostly
Henderson 30s. Leerssen crewed mainly as a
trimmer for both the spinnaker and jib, work
ing to keep the sails full and boat fast at all
times during the race.
VVairere started the regatta off well by win
ning the first race, but ended up loosing its
mast during the second in a little tangle with
another, larger boat. That set it back in the
scores a bit, but after a night of fiberglass work
the mast was back up and ready to go for the
next race.
' A couple of fourth places, a couple of sec
ond places, a ninth place and a third-place
finish filled out the eight races and landed
Wairere in fourth at the end of the regatta.
Leerssen has raced on this boat for the
event for at least the last four years, she said it
is one of the laster boats out there right now.
"With a little better luck we could have lin
ished a lot better," she said, "but ii was still
awesome. We had a great time."
