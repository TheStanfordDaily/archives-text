# Constitutional Council considers inaugural case
## Inter Varsity challenges constitutionality of denying funding to religious organizations 
### ANITHA REDDY EDITORIAL STAFF 
In its first case review since its es
tablishment three years ago, the
ASSU's Constitutional Council will
decide the fate of a petition ques
tioning the constitutionality of the
ASSU's policy of denying funding
to religious student groups.
"For as long as anyone can re

member the ASSU has had a policy
of not funding religious groups to
the point where religious groups
don't even ask anymore," said
Chris Stromberg, a doctoral candi
date in chemistry and member of
the Graduate Student Council.
"We tried to figure out exactly what
that was, or why the policy was
made, but nobody even remem
bered why the policy was made."
When the Inter Varsity Gradu
ate Christian Fellowship requested
funding from the GSC, "there was
some concern as to whether or not
it was constitutional," Stromberg
said.
After investigating the issue, the
GSC. learned religious groups were

barred from receiving funding by a
procedural rule of the now defunct
ASSU Program Board, not a consti
tutional clause.
Groups applying for funding
now work directly with the ASSU
Programming Director Adam
Weiss and the Undergraduate Sen
ate.
GSC members, however, did
not want to approve or deny the
funding request until the Constitu
tional Council had ruled on the
constitutionality of funding reli
gious groups.
Because the GSC was reluctant
to approve specific elements of the
Fellowship's proposed budget, the
group agreed to change the

amount of funding requested to
$1, Stroinberg said, [ his allows the
Constitutional Council to rule sole
ly on the constitutionality of fund
ing religious groups, rather than
also reviewing the details of the Fel
lowship's budget .
The council will meet this Sim
day to determine whether it will
hear the petition. If it does accept
the petition, it will rule on the con
stitutionality of the ASSU's policy
within one week.
"In my three years [with the or
ganization] we haven't funded any
religious groups," said ASSU Presi
dent Mike Levin, a junior. " I he
issue hasn't really been brought up
because we haven't had a religious

group come to us for funding."
Stromberg, who supports fund
ing for religious student groups,
drew an analogy between such
groups and cultural organizations,
which are funded by (he ASSU.
"The way 1 look at [religious
groups] is very similar to the way I
look at cultural groups,"
Stromberg said. "They are open to
all students, but their appeal is
somewhat limited" to those who
are not members of the that cultur
al group.
To apply for ASSU funds,
groups must be designated as vol
untary student organizations by
the Dean of Students' office, ac
cording to Weiss.
Student groups classified as vol
untary student organizations are
open to all students.
In the past few years, state and
federal courts have been increas
ingly asked to determine whether
public universities have the right to
require students to pay general
fees supporting student groups to
whom they object. In a landmark
1995 decision, the Supreme Court
ruled that the University of Vir
ginia could not refuse student-ac
tivity funds, maintained through
mandatory student fees, to reli
gious student groups.
The Supreme Court is expected
to rule this June on whether stu

dents at public universities can Tk*
forced to support political or ideo
logical organization with their lee
money. The suit was originally
brought by, Christian conservatives
at the University of Wisconsin who
objected to supporting such groups.
The California Supreme Court
addressed this issue in 1993 when
it ruled that students had the right
to specify which student groups
were eligible for their individual
fee contributions.
Although Stanford, as a private
university, is not bound by this de
cision, students can request refunds
of both ASSU and special lees.
Undergraduate Senator Matt
Spence, a senior, said that the
Council's decision is not necessari
ly the last word for future councils.
"I would think any body would
be guided by precedent but would
have the freedom to amend or up
date a decision as it sees lit,"he
said.
