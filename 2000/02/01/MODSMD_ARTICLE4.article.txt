# FLOODED with memories
## 
### NINA HOLLY 
If you think biking through
small puddles of rain is bad,
be glad that it's not 1998 and
that the campus isn't flooded by
El Nino. Two years ago today, a
storm swept through Santa Clara
County and dumped six inches
of rain in just 36 hours.
On the morning of Feb. 2,
1998, students woke up to Hood
ing in many parts of campus and
to canceled classes. The most
dramatic effect of the storm,
however, was its damage to Stan
ford libraries.
Green Library, Jonsson Fed
eral Documents Library and
Braun Archive of Recorded
Sound were flooded with up to
two feet of water. Braun Archive
had to dispose of 10,000 water
damaged recordings.
The University first became
aware of the danger to books in
the early morning hours of Feb.
2. By a.m., library officials had
placed dozens of phone calls to
the administration and to stu
dent groups such as Creek hous
es, asking for help in evacuating
library materials.
11 undreds of students showed
up at the libraries to save materi
als in danger of water damage.
The effort was somewhat suc
cessful, but early estimates said
that 120,000 books from Green
Library would have to be dis
carded or at least treated for
water damage.
This number turned out to be
misleading. Catherine Tierney.

assistant director of the Stanford
Libraries, said that only about six
percent of the total library collec
tion was affected by the El Nino
floods. Of those books, most had
to be rebound, and only a few
had to be replaced.
The greatest inconvenience,
Tierney said, came from recov
ering damaged out-of-print ti
tles.
"We had recovered in full [by]
about eight or nine months after
the Hood," said Tierney.
Hut most students weren't
nearly so inconvenienced. Many
went lountain-hopping, kayak
ing on campus, biking in knee
dee)) water, placing Frisbee in
the rain and rolling down slopes
in garbage cans. Some even raft
ed down Campus Drive on mat
tresses.
Senior Brian Decker recalls
watching people gunning their
cars across a mud pit behind
Bob.
"Some people were kayaking
iti the Bob parking lot," said
Decker. "There must have been
at least ten inches of water
there."
Although classes were can
celed, not all students were able
to join the fun. Many continued
to study for midterms, if only by
flashlight or in the few places on
campus that had not lost electric
ity . Some residences also lost hot
water briefly.
Overall, the damage to Stan
lord was minor compared to the
