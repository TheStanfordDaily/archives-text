# University's drop deadline approaches
## After five years students have adapted to stricter regulations on dropping and retaking courses 
### JOHN HUETTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I he standard Stanford conver
sation starter is "What classes are
yon taking?"
But on Feb. (>, the question will
become "What classes are you
dropping?"
Less than a week away, Feb. (i is
the last day for Stanford students
to drop winter quarter courses
without leaving a record on their
transcripts.
This deadline, nearly five

weeks into winter quarter, may
seem to give students sull'u ic*nt
time to shop and drop classes.
However, less than six vears ago,
Stanford students could drop
classes until the last da\ ol the
quarter, some simply writing "I'm
dropping" on a final and leaving
the ( lass without penaltv.
This all changed in Iwhen
the I niversitv implcnu .ited a
massive reform ol grading policy.
Among the changes weie the
adoption of a course withdrawal
option, stricter regulations on re
taking courses, cutbacks in grade
inflation and movement of the
drop deadline from the end ol the
quarter to the end of the quarter's
fourth full week.
Roger Printup, University reg
istrar and member of the 1994

committee recommending the
policy changes, said the current
drop schedule has benefited Stan
ford.
He said that faculty members
have told him that "they feel there
are fewer students dropping, par
ticularly at very last minutes and
finals - and they like that."
Printup said the lacultv has
generally accepted the policy.
"Nobody has brought it up and
said, 'Oh my Ciod. we made this
stupid mistake.' It hasn't really
been an issue. I haven't heard any
sentiment to go back [to the old
policv], but 1 also haven't heard
any sentiment towards a more re
strictive one."
liut in 1995, the policy change
rode a wave of controversy.
"Students thought the place

was going to fall apart," Printup
said.
Despite the initial arguments,
I'rintup said the new scheduling
lias smooth!) become a part of
Stanford academic life.
"There's a whole generation of
undergrads who have come into
Stanford with these new rules," he
said.
" 1 lie) sav.'()kav, that's the wav
it is,' and accept it." Printup said.
"It sounds the same as high
school; it's not undul) harsh or
overly rigorous, and in compari
son to other universities around
the country, we're in the ballpark
We've achieved a happy medi
um."
