# Squash courts at DeGuerre renovated
## 
### MEENA MALLIPEDDI 
With the recent massive reno
vation of the DeGuerre Gourts,
the Department of Athletics was
able to check another item off its
to-do list.
Erected in 197N, the eight

DeGuerre courts have been the
object of many petitions calling tor
renovation of tlu* peeling plaster
walls and leaking roofs. In June
1999, the University began reno
vation of seven of the eight courts,
adding new roofs, walls, paint,
signs and glass.

Assistant Athletic Director Ray
Purpur said that the renovations
cost the Athletics Department
about $300,000, which went main
ly toward new roofs, paint and
bathrooms compliant with the
Americans with Disabilities Act.
Anonymous private donors con-

tributed another
$150,000.
The complex
now contains two
international
sized squash
courts (21 feet
wide as opposed
to the standard
18.5 feet) lor all
league and tour
nament play. In
addition, the Ath
letics Depart
ment renovated
three other
squash courts
and two racquet
ball courts.
The eighth court
is still undergo
ing renovations
to convert it to a
climbing wall. Ac
cording to Pur
pur, students
should be able to
use the wall by

early June.
The Stanford Squash Team has
lobbied the Athletics Department
since the summer of 1998 to
launch renovations. Junior Mark
Goldenson, founder of the Stan
ford Squash Team, "was the dri
ving force behind the renovations,
along with [Captain] Mike Green
field," said head coach Tim
Balooch. "Had it not been for
them, we would not have these
new courts. Stanford Squash owes
them a tremendous debt of grati
tude."
To justify the renovations,
Goldenson and Greenfield had to
convince the Athletic Department
that at least 100 students on cam
pus wanted these changes.
"The Athletic Department has
been supportive, but it took time,"
Goldenson said. "We had to con
vince them [that the renovations]
were important enough first."
The Stanford Squash team,
founded in 1998, has ten players
at present. The team practices
four times a week at DeGuerre
Courts and plays all league games
in the international-sized glass
backed courts in the center of the
complex.
The team's next big match is
against California on Saturday,
Feb. 12.
