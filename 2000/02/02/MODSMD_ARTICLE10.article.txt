# Alumni give time over dollars

Both alumni and Stanford will benefit under
a new program recently created by the Alumni
Association. 1 he program's goal is to bring
alumni back to Stanford as volunteers for stu
dent groups and University departments.
The program will fall under the auspices of a
new bi anch in the association, called the Office
of Alumni Volunteer Relations. The new
branch was created on Dec. 1.
A task force convened by the Board of
Trustees created the program in 1993. The task
force found that alumni wanted a different way
to contribute to Stanford beyond sending
money.
I lie goals of the organization are, "to engage
and foster life-long connections between the
University and alums by providing meaningful
opportunities for alumni to volunteer at Stan
ford. It's about building connections and com
munity," said Betsy Collard, who was hired two
months ago to head this program.
"(The program will] make it easy for alums to
find where they can volunteer at Stanford, and
to give faculty and staff a way they can tap into

alumni expertise," said Collard.
Collard plans to use an "online Web-based
vehicle" modeled on volunteermatch.org to
help alumni find volunteer opportunities on
campus.
"It's very difficult [for alumni] to find where
those opportunities are," Collard said. "(The
program] helps people find the opportunities
that are already there."
Tasks available to alumni might include stuff
ing envelopes in the office of the President or
working with voluntary student organizations.
Those alumni who do not live near campus will
have the opportunity to schedule regional
events such as reunions.
Collard stresses the informal nature of the
program. "It's a way for Stanford alums to come
back and work together, so the project itself
might not require expertise. But just because
everybody is doing it together it's a positive, fun
thing to do."
The online project is "still in the design
stage," said Collard. She expects it to be
launched sometime next spring.
"We don't want to get [alums'] expectations
up that this [program] is available tomorrow,"

she said. "We want it to be ready with both the
systems to support it and also the opportuni
ties."
Collard's current tasks include collecting in
formation about the present use of alumni at
Stanford and surveying alums about how they
would like to be involved with Stanford.
Melora Krebs-Carter, a senior, is assisting
Collard with the program. Although she was
originally thinking of working for Bill Bradley's
campaign, a meeting with Vice-Provost James
Montoya convinced her to stay at Stanford and
assist Collard with the new program.
"It turned out to be a match made in heav
en," Krebs-Carter said of her job with Collard.
"I hope to get some of my friends involved."
"This vision is the only one in the country,"
Collard said. "Most alumni volunteer organiza
tions focus on alumni being involved in the
alumni association. We're thinking more bold
ly."
Both Collard and Krebs-Carter are opti
mistic about the success of the project. Krebs-
Carter estimates that while 3,000 alumni are
currently volunteered, as many as 50,000 would
if they were given the opportunity.
