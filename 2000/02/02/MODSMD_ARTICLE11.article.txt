# Med School dumps promo video for CD-ROM

### TERRI MOSQUEDA 
The School of Medicine is replacing its tradi
tional admissions video with a (iI)-R()M for this
coming year's round of applicants.
"With a CD-ROM, you can skip around and
receive the information that you're looking
for," said Steve Rush, a third-year medical and
third-year law student who volunteered his
time for the project. "A tape is very linear."
Stanford is the first medical school in the coun
try to drop its admissions video for a CD-ROM.
"Our desire is that [the CD-ROM] will pro
vide a relevant source of information about the
part of the Medical School that students can see,
hut also about the parts of it that students fail to
see when they come for their interview and
tours," Assoc. Medicine Prof. Gabriel Garcia
said. "It is a very easy, portable source of infor
mation."
The CD-ROM offers a "seamless educa
tion" approach to the University. To compli
ment the information on the disc, the pro
gram also includes Web links to financial aid

resources, faculty and interviews with alumni,
as well as on-line tours of the school itself.
"We're trying to be more service and recruit
ment-oriented. While we are Stanford and
we're in a beautiful environment, we do have to
compete with our peer schools," Medical School
Dean Phyllis Gardner said.
The Medical School's crowded, aging
teaching facilities have been a recruting liabil
ity in recent years and nearly prompted the
national board of accreditation for medical
schools to place Stanford on probation^n April
1999.
Michael Ennen, a third-year medical student
last spring, said at that time that though "the de
cision to attend a certain medical school is mul
tifactorial, many prospective students had as
tutely honed in on the disparity between Stan
ford's reputation and stature and the state of its
facilities."
In response, the Board of Trustees approved
in October a $185-million, five-year plan to
build a new Medical School education building
and overhaul Lane Medical Library, among

other renovations at the school.
The project, which is under the supervision
of Char Hamada, director of admissions out
reach and records at the Medical School, had no
initial budget.
112 he CD-ROM was put together by students
and faculty, who donated their talents in areas
such as photography and music.
"It really was a grassroots operation," Hama
da said.
The student-faculty collaboration, said Gar
cia, also made sure "that the content in the CD
ROM was right and portrayed Stanford Medical
School in a way that highlights our strengths."
Hamada also pointed out possible benefits
for parents.
"Sometimes the parents want to know where
students are going. They'll be able to take a look
at the CD," she said.
"The CD-ROM is a real opportunity for us
to reach out to students after they've come in
for orientation weekend. It's something
physical we can put in their hands," Gardner
said.
