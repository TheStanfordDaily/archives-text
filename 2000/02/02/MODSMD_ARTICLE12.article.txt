## McCain beats Bush in New Hampshire McCain and Gore are victorious in first primary 
### 
MANCHESTER, N.H. (AT)
Arizona Sen. John McCain
scored a landslide victory over
George W. Bush yesterday in
New 1 lampsliire's leadoll prima
ry, puncturing the Texas gover
nor's aura as the inevitable
Republican nominee.
Bill Bradley battled but lost to
Vice President A 1 Gore in a tight
Democratic contest.
It was a typical New Hamp
shire primary, with voters deliv
ering a lecture to front-runners
in both parties and recasting the
race as the candidates looked to
larger states ahead.
But first McCain was celebrat
ing his surprising victory mar
gin.
"We beat him amongst every
one, men and women, Republi
can and independent, young
and old, McCain said in an
interview with The Associated
Press.
He credited his agenda of
political and campaign finance
reform lor his victory, and said
New Hampshire voters had pro
vided the momentum he needed
to challenge the better financed

and organized Bush down the
road.
In returns from 33 percent of
New Hampshire's 300 Republi
can precincts, McCain had 48
percent of the vote compared to
31 percent for Bush.
Millionaire publisher Steve
Forbes was a distant third at 14
percent and former Ambas
sador. Alan Keyes was at 7 per
cent.
Among Democrats, Gore had
54 percent of the vote, and-
Bradley had 46 percent.
Nearly four out of every 10
New Hampshire voters do not
declare a party affiliation, and
they were a potent attraction to
insurgent candidates Bradley
and McCain in a state that has a
history of knocking front-run
ners offstride.
McCain's gargantuan victory
was certain to raise questions
about Bush's strategy, reiving on
photo opportunities and script
ed speeches while McCain held
dozens of free-wheeling town
hall meetings, appealing to
finicky New Hampshire voters
who expect a personal touch.
Alter calling McCain to con
gratulate his rival, a chastened
Bush told supporters, "I am bet
ter candidate for having c<>me to
New Hampshire and waging
this campaign and because of
this competition.'"
