UKI.FAST, Northern Ireland
(AP) — Northern Ireland's Protes
tant-Catholic government was
plunged into c risis yesterday aliei
a report by an independent com
inission confirmed that the Irish
Republican Army has failed to
begin turning over its weapons.
Amid doubts that the 8-wcck
old Northern Ireland administra

tion could survive, the major
Protestant party, the Ulster I nion
ists, accused the IRA-linked Sinn
Kein ol failing to deliver on its side
of an American-brokered deal that
led to their power-sharing Cabi
net.
I he disarmament commission
delivered its report — confirming
that no specific acts of IRA disar
mament had taken place — to the
British and Irish governments late
Monday. Ihe commission
declined to make the report public
yesterday.
In a statement, the IRA insisted
its 1997 cease-lire should be sulli
c ient grounds lor Sinn Fein's con

tinned place within the four-party
administration, the central goal of
the 1998 Good Friday peace
accord.
I lie outlawed group said it had
consistently stressed the message
"that the IRA's guns are silent and
that there is no threat to the peace
process from the IRA."
Yet the IRA gave no hint that it
intended to hand over a single bul
let, much less its many tons of
weapons stockpiled in hidden
caches.
I he accord anticipated the
I RA s total disarmament by Mav.
I lster I nionisi leader David
I l imbic said the British govern

ment now had a "regrettable but
inevitable" choice: to suspend the
Cabinet's powers in hopes fresh
negotiations could produce a more
ironclad agreement involving IRA
disarmament, or watch the Cabi
net collapse as the Ulster Unionists
back out.
Trimble said the deal brokered
last November by U.S. mediator
George Mitchell required the IRA
to scrap weapons in advance of the
just-completed report, not merely
to talk about it with the commis
sion's chairman, Canadian Gen.
|ohn de Chastelain.
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
rejected that account.
