## The 						Stanford Daily Constitutional Council should revise procedure 
### 
Published Since 1891

HE ASSU'S RECENTLY activated
T Constitutional Council could very
well enhance reasoned, delibera
tive decision-making within the
Stanford student community.
Formed three years ago, the Council was
established to evaluate the consistency of the
ASSU's decisions on ASSU constitutional
issues.
With a formal decision-making body like
the Council in place, members of the Council
and the parties involved can reflect on the rea
soning behind current practices at Stanford,
such as the denial of funding to religions
groups.
One problem with this system, however, is
that the Council has adopted poor procedural
rules, inclnding a provision that all arguments
must be submitted in writing to the Council.

This precludes meaningful verbal debate,
thereby making the Council less deliberative
and possibly rendering it less capable of deal
ing with complex issues.
Furthermore, given the Council's rationale
for the rule, namely the desire to guard
against overly emotional argument, it also
treats the parties arguing cases as irrational
individuals unable to carry out reasonable dis
course.
.Although the rule was designed to prevent
those with superior speaking skills from gain
ing an "unfair advantage," the result is to give
those with superior writing skills a similar
advantage.
The first case the Council will address rais
es the question of whether religious groups on
campus should receive ASSU funding. Stu
dent groups seeking ASSU funding must be

designated a "voluntary" student organization
by t lie Dean of Students' office.
The Dean's office makes this designation
based on whether groups are open to all stu
dents. When assessing religious groups, and
even ethnic ones, by this standard, the ques
tion to be asked is whether "voluntary" in the
technical sense is actually "voluntary" in the
social sense.
A strong deliberative body is required to
tease out these sorts of distinctions while
simultaneously addressing the tension
between separating church and state and
respecting everyone's beliefs out of a commit
ment to liberal neutrality.
The question is particularly vexing because
on one hand, separating church and state is an
effective way of allowing individuals to live out
their own conceptions of the good life. At the

same time, many people's idea of the good life
is to have a relationship with their god or
gods. What's a liberal to do?
The Council provides an important forum
for discussing what should be done in this
kind of case and, as a constitutional "court" of
sorts, the Council may well contribute to Stan
ford's ability to handle these tensions. Yet the
issue of funding religious groups is complex,
and a deliberative body without free debate is
inevitably handicapped when considering
such issues.
There is a great deal of potential for the
Council to make a lasting contribution to the
Stanford community. But, in order to realize
this potential, the procedural constraints cur
rently in place — those that prevent serious
exploration of the issues at hand — must be
revised.
