# Student supports U'Wa
## 
### LAUREN DIETRICH GUEST COLUMNIST 
I ask that you all take time out from
your leisurly lives at Stanford to consider
the plight of the U'Wa, an indigenous
tribe in the cloud forests of Columbia.
These people, who have so far resisted
influence from the global community, are
currently involvedrin a life or death strug
gle to save their land from oil drilling by
Occidental Petroleum. p
The Los Angeles based oil company
has proposed to collect an estimated 2.5
billion barrels of oil from the drilling site,
Gibraltar 1, in the Samore block territory.
The drilling site, although not on the
U'Wa reservation, is well within the heart
of U'Wa ancestral land.
The U'Wa believe oil is the blood of
the earth and using that blood would ulti
mately lead to death and destruction for
all living things.
Remembering the basic concepts of
trust and respect for all human beings,
we must respect the U'Wa's claim to their
ancestral land.
This tribe has felt a connection to the
land for centuries and understands the
delicate balance of plant and animal life
this land holds., They have threatened to
commit mass suicide as a final protest if
the drilling commences, demonstrating
an extreme dedication to the earth that
we need to respect.
Does the profit from this oil, enough to
supply the demands of the United States
for three months or the world for three
weeks, really balance the disappearance
of an entire population? Do you care? Do
you know that your money could easily

be invested in this project? We must think
twice before we unknowingly sponsor
these activities and, consequently, the
elimination of the U'Wa culture.
Responsible consumerism has become
more and more difficult as our economy
globalizes, and consumers are separated
from producers by a series of middlemen
and investing companies.
Yet, it is still the duty of the consumer
to know what their money is supporting.
As consumers, we have incredible power
over the future of our world. We must
take responsibility for how we spend our
money.
Fidelity Investments (which owns
between 8 and 12 percent of Occidental
Petroleum at all times, depending on the
quarter and the choices of the head
investors of individual mutual funds) is in
a crucial position as one of the largest
investment firms in the world. They have
the opportunity to make a phenomenal
impact on the U'Wa campaign and
change future approaches to investing on
a global scale.
If Fidelity delivers an ultimatum to
Occidental, promising to drop the stock if
Occidental refuses to pull out of the pro
ject, Occidental will have to listen. Fideli
ty has the opportunity to show that they
care about the consequences of their
investments, and not only the profit
returns.
Yet Fidelity has no reason to take this
stand unless there proves to be stong sup
port from its customers and the general
public. After all, their job is simply to
make money off our money. It's our
responsibility to draw attention to the
issues if we feel strongly about them.
