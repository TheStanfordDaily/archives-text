## Atheists don't need "God-given right" 
### 
I refer to Travis Kopp's Jan. 28 col
umn, "God-given right." Kopp argues
that an atheist cannot make absolute
moral judgments, "because he has no
standard for judgment without religion,
beyond his own prejudices and social
construct."
Kopp presumes that religion provides
an objective moral standard. But reli
gious morality arises, in fact, from narrow
self-interest. It just uses universal terms to
fool the credulous.
Recall the Inquisition. To preserve
itself, the Catholic Church cracked down
violently on heretics. The Church's insti
tutional self-interest defined Christian
"morality" for a millennium.
Islam's doctrines of morally justified
jihad have roots in Mohammed's decision
to spread Allah's word by the sword; his
early attempts at peaceful conversion
failed.
Worse, religion disguises pursuit of
institutional self-interest as universal
morality. In so doing, religious morality
breeds fanaticism.

The ancient Hebrews insisted on Yah
weh as their only god in the interests of
internal tribal coherence.
When Christianity took this belief and
universalized it into monotheism, it begot
the Crusades — intolerant and bloody
(but moral!) wars.
Kopp's assertion that only religious
morality is true morality is the same
impulse that precipitated mass slaughter.
Atheists do have moral standards out
side individual consciences, lake West
ern philosophy. Utilitarianism does not
require a God — morally good actions
give the greatest benefit to the greatest
number.
Kant's hypothetical imperative rules
out murder, theft, and violations of the
Honor Code, without recourse to immor
tality.
Sartre's essay, "Existentialism is a
Humanism," lays the foundations of a
God-less ethical system.
Atheists can thus make absolute moral
judgments. Atheists do, of course, realize
that moral judgments depend on the par
ticular ethical system applied. But that is
the point.

Atheists are tolerant of different moral
standards. Religious moralists must dis
credit those who dissent from their uni
versalistic ethics.
At Stanford, discrediting means argu
ment. In other places, it means invoking
the might of God and t! it' force of arms.
Taliban fighters have one hand on a
Kalashnikov and the other on a Koran. I
have £et to hear of violence over atheistic
beliefs.
