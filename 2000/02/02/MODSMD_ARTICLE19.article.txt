# Graphic gives Gore free publicity
## 
### 
I first want to commend your coverage
of Alison Friedman's participation in the
2000 presidential campaign. Our much
maligned, sometimes apathetic young
voter cohorts would do well to be more
involved in political issues, particularly
with so many interesting ideas on the
table during this election year.
I do object, however, to the promi
nence of the "Gore 2000 graphic on the

front page. Gertaiuly this increases the
visibility of Al Gore's campaign on our
own college campus, yet I was not aware
that The I)ail\ had endorsed any particu
lar candidate.
It's an editorial prerogative to liven up
the front page with color graphics, but
perhaps the plurality of political opinions
and campaign participation around cam
pus would be better represented by gen
eral, non-candidate-specific coverage of
the campaign.
It would be interesting to see what stu
dents, faculty and staff are doing about
personally relevant issues amidst the
upcoming primary and impending local
elections.
If nothing else, use The Daily's large
reader base to encourage voter registra
tion, as such can only bolster credibility
and underscore a general commitment to
the University community.
Granted, it was just a logo, but unless
the Gore campaign is paying for free
front-page advertising, please try to
maintain an air of impartiality in presen
tation!
The article itself was well-written and

the contents very newsworthy. I hope to
see further coverage of campaign partici
pation within the Stanford community
throughout the coming months, regard
less of party or candidate.
