### JONATHAN KOLSTAD 
The second oldest student-run
organization on campus may soon
have a very different look. The
Toyon Eating Clubs, a part of the
Stanford community since 1894,
lace an uncertain fate.
While Toyon 1 lall itself is slated
to undergo capital improvements
this summer, the clubs themselves
will not be touched. The future of
the clubs is in the hands of an advi
sory panel, the Stanford Eating
Clubs Working Group. The group,
made up of six members, has been

meeting for the past eight months
and plans on submitting a recom
mendation some time this quarter.
The Working Group is expected
to recommend the construction of
completely new clubs. Their recom
mendation is based on the current
state of the buildings and student
support for the Eating Clubs as a
part of student life.
The fate of the Toyon eating
clubs has long been an issue. The
university has considered a number
of options including building new
