# New Hampshire proves presidential race isn't over
## Voters have spoken â€” Bush must modify his methods if he wants to remain afloat 
### BEN JONES OPINIONS EDITOR 
Folks in New Hampshire have always
prided themselves on doing things differ
ently.

DAILY OP-ED

Voters re-affirmed this conviction
luesday as Arizona Senator John McCain

won the Republican primary over front
runner George YV. Bush in the first party
primary of the 2000 election.
The win is an important comeback lor
McCain after Bush captured the lowa
Caucus last week. Although New Hamp
shire only represents a small bloc k of del
egates to the national convention, the vic
tory may signal a turning of the tide as
McCain attempts to erode Bush's previ
ously widespread popularity.
Bush, the charismatic crowd-pleaser of
this year's election, has seen his once
tremendous lead narrow over the last
year as his candidacy has become official,
and he has been forced to make concrete,
substantive platform declarations.
While continuing to embrace his so
called brand of "compassionate conser

vatism," Bush has drawn fire in recent
months for, among other things, his lack
of knowledge and leadership in the for
eign policy arena.
By contrast, McCain, a former POW
with extensive policy-making experience
as an Arizona senator, has seen his popu
larity swell, culminating in yesterday's
New Hampshire victory.
McCain relied heavily on votes from
military veterans, who make up over half
of New Hampshire's population, as well
as the crucial liberal, conservative and
moderate swing voters who straddle both
the Republican and Democratic sides of
the fence.
McCain's ability to court this precious
bloc k of voters could prove instrumental
if he is to mount a continued and signifi

cant challenge to Bush's public relations
and fund-raising machine.
As the number of voters in the moder
ate sector, both affiliated and non-afliliat
ed with the two major parties, continues
to rise, candidates are increasingly forced
to mitigate the partisan nature of their
platforms, making this block of voters a
potential deciding factor in the 2000 elec
tion.
For Bush, both within the Republican
party and perhaps in the general election,
this shift poses significant problems. On
one side of this conundrum, Bush must
placate old-guard Republicans with con
servative stances on social issues such as
abortion and the separation of church
and state.
At the same time, however, he must

not stray far from the middle ground if
he is to win. The opportunity to capitalize
on this core block of voters could be just
what McCain needs to overcome Bush,
who, at one time, was considered the
shoo-in for the Republican nomination.
As McCain continues to draw voters
from this middle ground, his campaign
could also aflect the Democratic pri
maries. Early exit poll data reveals a num
ber of moderate voters who chose
McCain, in turn disadvantaging Bill
Bradley in his effort to down Democratic
front-runner, Vice President A 1 Gore.
It remains to be seen whether McCain
can build upon his victory in New Hamp
shire to mount a significant challenge to
Bush, but as ystei day's primary indicates,
the race is far from over.
