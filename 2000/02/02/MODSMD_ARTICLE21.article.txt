Editor's Note: This piece is the first in a
series of articles featuring Stanford's
Olympic connnections. Look here each
Wednesday to follow Stanford's -path to
Sydney 2000.

Welcome to the University's lat
csi addition to the overseas pro
gram: Stanford in Sydney.
I his September, the official
home of the XXVII Olympiad may
feel like an unoHicial extension of
campus lor the large group of
Stanford athletes, coaches and
alumni competing in the summer
games.
As members of the Cardinal
Â»ontingent, they will become a part
ol a long-standing tradition of in
ternational success. Stanford has
been represented in every summer
Olympiad since 1908. Over 500
Stanford students, faculty and
alumni have competed in the mod
cm ( )lympic games, garnering 148
medals and building a dynasty in
i lien's and women's swimming and
diving.
Athletic Director fed Leland
< ited a number of factors that have
coml lined to give Stanford its gold
en touch.
"Stanford's academic reputa
tion, the quality of life and the high
quality of athletic support here
combine to make it a very attractive
place for athletes to go to school,"
I .eland said.
I le also noted thecomplimenta
i\ relationship between Stanford
athletics and ()lympiccompetition.
" If |ai lileies <>r coaches] have in
ternational aspirations, we'll try to
work to a< commodate them within
the Stanford program," Leland
said.
In addition, Stanford receives
positive visibility during Olympic
years. Ac cording to Leland, images
ol Stanford student-athletes com
peting at the Olympic level help
the University recruit ambitious
young athletes.
Images of Stanford athletes
could make up a scrapbook of the
most memorable moments of the
1090 ()lympic games in Atlanta.
Sprinter Chryste Gaines, Class
of 1002. joined Gail Devers, Gwen

Torrence and Inger Miller on the
platform to collect gold in the 400-
meter relay.
Current undergraduate Kerri
Strug nailed a heart-wrenching
final vault to give the U.S. women's
gymnastics team a much-awaited
win.
Stanford alum Jeff Rouse,
coached by current men's swim
ming head coach Skip Kenney,
swam a leg of the world-record
setting 400-meter medley relay.
Alumna Julie Foudy led the vic
torious U.S. women's soccer
team.
The U.S. women's 400-meter
medley relay, including current se
nior Catherine Fox and alumna
Jenny Thompson and coached by
current women's swimming head
coach Richard Quick, captured the
gold while also tying an Olympic
record.
Other Stanford medalists at the
Atlanta games include synchro
nized swimming head coach Gail
Finery, swimmers Kurt Orote, Joe
11 udpohl, and Lisa Jacobs, baseball
player A. J. Hinch, gymnast Jair
Lynch, and beach volleyball player
Kent Steflles.
Cardinal athletes earned 22
medals in all, 18 of them gold. Had
Stanford been a country, it would
have ranked 17th in the medal
count.
In Leland's mind, there were
too many great performances by
Stanford athletes to choose a fa
vorite.
However, he said he had a lot
of fun watching alumni Jennifer
Az/.i and Katy Steding, coached
by current women's basketball
head coach lara VanDerveer,
beat Brazil 111-87 on the final
day of Olympic competition to
earn gold.
If Stanford's strong perfor
mance in Atlanta is an indication of
things to come, Cardinal fans
should have high expectations for
the upcoming summer games.
With the number of athletes who
will Ik* spending this September in
Sydney and the medals they may
bring back to The Farm, Leland
may have to consider a change in
the Stanford athletic department
motto: "Home of Olympic Champi
ons."
