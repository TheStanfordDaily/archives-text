# Tigers no match for tennis
## 
### BILL HANSON STAFF WRITER 
The game is called, "Who can
win the fastest?", and the Stan
ford women's tennis team plays
it every time it stepson the court.
In the game, each player tries
to win her match in less time
than her teammates. As a result,
spectators are treated to several
straight-set demolitions.
Of course, the Cardinal
women don't really play, "Who
can win the fastest?"

WOMEN'S TENNIS
â–  Yesterday: No. 1 Stanford 9
Pacific 0.

It just seems like they do.
Yesterday, for example,
under a bright sun at the Taube
Family Tennis Stadium, top
ranked Stanford (6-0, 4-0) tram
pled University of the Pacific, 9-0.
Five of the six singles matches
were over after an hour of play.
"The girls were really paying
attention," said assistant coach
Lele Forood. "All of the Pacific
girls were consistent and mov
ing well. They made our girls
win the points. It was a good
match for us."
At the No. 1 singles position,
freshman Laura Granville,
ranked second in the nation,
trounced Pacific's Susanne
Bertel, ranked 47th, 0-2, 6-1.
Granville now boasts a 16-2
record for the season.
The rest of the Cardinal
women followed Granville's
lead. At the No. 2 spot, senior
Teryn Ashley routed Christiane
Barthel, 6-3, 6-2. Ashley was on
top of her game, showing no
signs of the inconsistency that
plagued her in a loss to Wash
ington's llona Kordonskaya
over the weekend.
Sophomore Gabriela Lastra
cruised to a 6-1, 6-1 triumph
over Pacific's Diana D'Audney in
the No. 4 singles match. Senior
Jennifer Heiserand junior Sarah
Pestieau also posted straight-set
victories at the No. 5 and 6 sin
gles positions, respectively.
The most dramatic match of
the afternoon unfolded on court
3 as sophomore Lauren
Kalvaria, currently ranked a ca
reer-high 13th in the nation,
took on Pacific's Anouk Sinnige
in the No. 3 singles match.
Kalvaria took the first set 6-3,
but then dropped the second by
the same score.
"[Sinnige] is a very good play
er," Kalvaria said. "She went
through streaks where she just
hit winner after winner. It was
one of those matches where you
know you're gonna win, but you

have to go three sets anyway."
Kalvaria lias a history of get
ting herself into long three-set
tussles, sometimes against op
ponents she should defeat
handily.
By the same token, Kalvaria,
who is renowned for her grit
and determination, always
seems to pull through in those
light three-setters.
Credit also must be given to
her opponent who kept Kalvaria
running for much of the match.
"[Kalvaria] ran into a real hot
player," Forood said. "Some
times it takes losing a whole set
before you decide you're going
to play better. What really mat
ters is that she had a very good
third set."
Kalvaria swept through the

third set, eventually taking the
match, 6-3, 3-6, (i-l.
Stanford 1( >oke( 1 especially for
midable in its doubles matches.
At the No. 1 spot, Lastra and
Kalvaria teamed up to bagel
Barthel and D'Audney. Kalvaria
and Lastra, who have competed
together since their junior days
but have struggled recently,
were on top of their games yes
terday, smashing overheads into
both corners while also playing
several impressive defensive
points.
"Lastra and Kalvaria have fi
nally found their way back out of
the woods as a doubles team,"
said head coach Frank Brennan.
"Hopefully, they're home now."
Kalvaria agreed.
" I'm taking the forehand side

these days, which I haven't done
since we first started out," she
said. "Our game had become a
little stale, but now it's back. It's
great to win a match 8-0, no mat
ter who you're playing."
At the No. 2 position, the
Stanford duo of Granville and
Ashley trounced Tigers' Bertel
and Sinnige, 8-2.
Heiser and Pestieau were
equally impressive in the No. 3
match, carving out a quick 8-1
victory punctuated by a series of
flat forehand return winners by
Pestieau.
Next up for the CCardinal is an
indoor individual tournament,
the Rolex National Collegiate
Tennis Championships, which
will take place this weekend in
Dallas, Texas.
