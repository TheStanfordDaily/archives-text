# IM ball gone wrong
## 
### BEN ALLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
One of'the few Stanford sports phe
nomena that can draw techies away
from their glowing screens, fu/.zies
away from their Kafka and grad stu
dents out of their cocoons is here: In
tramural Basketball. Winter quarter is
when the gym rats coine out to play.
The goal of 1M basketball is simple:
prove to your friends and acquain
tances that your athletic prowess lias
not soured since your high school glory
days — that your on-court game is not
as weak as the mess you run at every
SAE party. Combined with a little of
your A-game, the following tips should
make your team nearly unstoppable.
Play Division II Ball
So this lesson comes a little late, but
you must acquire this information
somehow if you hope to succeed: Your
overtoilfidence in your skills will be
your downfall.
Did you know that Willie'Howard

can run the fast break? In 1)1, Willie will
teach yon this lesson he drags you down
the lloor attached to his ankle. In
evitably, one of his buddies will then
dunk on your head — you will cry.
Unless you want to be dismantled by
l<K)tball players or fed your shoes by-
WNBA stars, go 1)11.

Don't be afraid
.Now that
you're playing DII,
you should fear no
opponent. Check
out the 6-5 behe
moth on the Me
chanical Engineer
ing squad. Does he
have a ktiee brace?
Is his ankle taped? If

the answer to these questions is "no," it
is clear that this man is not a bailer.
II this gargantuan had played any
organized ball, he should have what he
will refer to as a "trick knee" or "bum

wheel." When one of these maladies
is present, you will have identified a
weakness which should be exploit
ed immediately.
Your opponents may be run
ning lay-up drills before the game.
They may even appear to have pre
determined "plays." Don't worry.
Only teams with severe lack of tal
ent (grad student teams) will rely on
such schemes to eke out a victory.
Do beware of the occasional
ringer used by some less ethical
teams. These players, who average
6-9, 245 lbs and happen to have a
"buddy" in your opponent's dorm,
love to crash DII parties. One piece
of advice here: hit them low.
Make your fouls spectacular
So the IM refs who used to call
invisible fouls are history, but this is

only a mixed blessing. You know
your weasely opponents will call
any touch or bump that comes their
way, so make your fouls obvious in
a teeth-gnashing, arm-flailing way.
My personal favorite foul came
last year when an opponent at
tempted to charge past for an easy
two. Elevating together, 1 simulta
neously bit his forehead and swept
his legs from underneath him —
the fall was catastrophic. With ice
nowhere to be found, the lump on
his forehead was soothed only by
applying two frozen churros, pried
from a Maples concession freezer,
to the wound.
This foul resulted in my immedi
ate ejection, so don't try to duplicate
it — improvise and come with some
original stuff. Craft a work of art in
tangled limbs which you are proud
to call your own.
Keep team management simple
Disrupting the flow of your 1M
game can l)e disastrous, so get your

best players on the floor and let
them play.
Keeping less talented players off
the floor can be difficult, though.
Dubbing your least talented "ath
lete" the "Player/Coach" can help
solve this problem. Even the worst
ball-handler can become an expert
at yelling "Slow it down!" As Casa
Zapata's player/coach, 1 know that
this position is as fulfilling than
being just another leading scorer.
Without referees to monitor sub
stitutions, use a hockey-style line
change of at least four players when
tanks are running low. This ploy
confounds the opponent and can
results in a quick bucket. You may
even enjoy a brief period of six-on
five play before then enemy identi
fies your diabolical scheme.
When all else fails, taunt
If you have been following my
instruction, you should now be
commanding a blowout situation.
But if you are on the ass-end of a

blowout, you have only one option.
Taunt. Taunt the opponent for
not playing in Division I. Taunt
their ringers. Question the integrity
of their mothers. Merciless taunts
and their resulting confrontations
can be the most entertaining part of
the IM game.
The most important lesson to be
learned about IM basketball is that
your games only have meaning
while the game clock is running.
DO NOT try to impress the op
posite sex with your margin of vic
tory. That is poor game.
DO NOT put your IM accolades
on your resume — this is a common
blunder.
Most importantly, DO NO I
carry pent-up aggression oil the
court. Bottle it up — you'll need it
when you face Zapata next week.

commanding a blowout situation.
But if you are on the ass-end of a

blowout, you have only one option.
Taunt. Taunt the opponent for
not playing in Division I. Taunt
their ringers. Question the integrity
of their mothers. Merciless taunts
and their resulting confrontations
can be the most entertaining part of
the IM game.
The most important lesson to be
learned about IM basketball is that
your games only have meaning
while the game clock is running.
DO NOT try to impress the op
posite sex with your margin of vic
tory. That is poor game.
DO NOT put your IM accolades
on your resume — this is a common
blunder.
Most importantly, DO NO I
carry pent-up aggression oil the
court. Bottle it up — you'll need it
when you face Zapata next week.

Ben challenges any (DII) team to take
on his Zapata goon squad. The foals
are for real, kids.
