# Pedestrians, bike and car congestion create traffic hazards on May field, students say
## 'Careless' drivers vex Flo Mo 
### MARK BOUCHER 
An accident between a motorist
and a bicyclist last week has high
lighted the hazardous conditions
for cars, bicycles and pedestrians
along Mayfield Ave. near Florence
Moore 1 lall and the temporary post
office. The accident, according to
Flo Mo residents, is a part of a trend
of unsafe traffic patterns in the area
that has prompted Flo Mo staff to
form a traffic safety committee for
their residents.
Fhe accident occurred last Fri
day around 6:30 p.m. at the cross
walk that leads from the path
through theTresidder Union park
ing lot to Flo Mo. Freshman Joyce
Sohn, a resident of Alondra, was
crossing Mayfield Ave. on her bicy
cle from Tresidder to Flo Mo.
According to Sohn, the closest
lane of traffic was clear of cars and
several cars were lined up at the stop
sign in the far lane. Sohn began to
cross the street, and the first stopped
car in the far lane began to move for
ward while she was in front of it.
The car clipped the back wheel of
Sohn's bicycle, causing her to fall.
She declined medical assistance at
the scene, although she reported

that her leg was mildly hurt.
"Drivers can be careless, and it is
a common place [for people to
cross]," said Sohn.
Director of Public Safety Marvin
Herrington called the incident a
"true accident," because the car had
come to a complete stop, as required
by law.
According to I len ington, this ac
cident has been the only one report
ed this year along the stretch of

Mayfield Ave. in front of Flo Mo.
"We try to be as pro-active as we can
because of the mixture of bikes,
pedestrians, cars and congestion, es
pecially in that area," he said.
Sergeant Laura Wilson of the
Stanford Police noted that the traffic
department has been using "direct
enforcement" of that area of May
field Ave., specifically concentrating
on traffic enforcement in that area.
junior Frin Mallory, a resident

assistant in Faisan, characterized the
crosswalk as dangerous, noting that
four or five students have been hit
by cars this year, in addition to many
near accidents.
"The University is not seeing the
danger of the situation clearly," she
said. She noted that many students
did not report their accidents to the
police department, even if they
were hit.
"There's definitely fault on both
sides," she said. "Students [speed]
down the hill and go through the in
tersection quickly. But many drivers
roll through the stop signs."
The Facilities Department in
stalled stop signs at the crosswalk in
September 1998 to facilitate pedes
trian traffic to Flo Mo and Tresid
der. Fhe department has also in
stalled "pedestrian crossing" and
"stop ahead" warning signs.
"The stop signs are hard [for dri
vers] to see," said freshman Justin
Whitney.
The crosswalk was meant to help
students with disabilities, even
though the mid-block location is not
ideal from a traffic safet) standpoint.
