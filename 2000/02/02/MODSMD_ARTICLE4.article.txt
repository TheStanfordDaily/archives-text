# E-mail drive targets post office
## 
### CORINNE YATES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Everyone on campus has heard
complaints about the Stanford post
office, I nit I Jaw sch< >< >1 student Ty C lle
venger is taking his complaints to a
higher level — an e-mail campaign to
the I .S. (iovernment.
"Fellow postal patrons," Cle
venger began in an e-mail to the Law
School students list, "I've concluded
that the Postal Service will never re
spond to our complaints if left to its
own devices, so I'm starting an e-mail
campaign to Senator Diane Feinstein
and Congresswoman Anna Ehsoo."

Clevenger said he and some of his
friends filled out complaint forms at
the post office that were never an
swered.
"They've misplaced my packages,
misdirected my mail, and then re
fused to respond when I've asked
what happened," he said.
A customer service representative
for the Stanford Post Office refused
to acknowledge or comment on any
complaints or problems.
Clevenger is not the only one to
have such problems. Law School stu
dent Carolyn Hofig said over the
course of four months, she failed to
receive her A TM card, auto insur

ance bill and "a haltdozen or so c red
it card hills."
"Everytime I called the USPS's
800 number or spoke to the stall in
side the station, mail would suddenly
appear in my box for a day or two.
Then 1 was cut oft'again,"she said.
I tofig decided that it was easier for
her to get another mailbox off-cam
pus than to deal with problems at the
Stanford post office.
"More than half of the mail that I
knew to expect never arrived. Most of
what did arrive required some weeks
in transit. My solution is to get anoth-

er Im)\," sin- said.
Many other students recounted
similar stories, but expressed a strong
desire to remain anonymous.
One such student said that he
wrote a letter to the postmaster after
some of his mail got lost and other
mail t<x>k huge amounts of lime to ar
rive. The letter was unanswered and
he said that it took about a month ol
daily telephone calls before he finally
was able to contact him.
"The post oft ice is slowly getting a
handle on the problems," said Bill
Johnston, P.O. box coordinator for
the Registrar's ()ffice.
"Just at the end of last week they
updated the sorting system which au
tomatically converts the old P.O. Im>x
numbers to the new ones. They are
.ilso bringing in a lot of people and
paying them overtime to work in

their off-hours," he said.
"They seem to be pretty well
caught up from what I have ob
served," Johnston concluded.
Clevenger, however, thinks the
temporary hxation is no excuse for
p<x)r service.
"The temporary post office isn't
the problem. University employees
have told me the service was horrible
fifteen years ago," he said.
The renovation includes an ex
pansion of the old post office, whose
small si/e was often blamed for poor
or slow service.
"It seems like post office problems
originate with space," said Junior
Benjamin Liu, the Deputy Chair of
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate. "It
doesn't seem like there is enough ca
pacity to handle the volume of mail
that comes to Stanford,"
Beyond missing and tardy mail,
Clenvenger said that he began his e
mail campaign after having problems
with one of the postal workers. He
claims that a confidential letter he

wrote to the Palo Alto postmaster
about the conduct of the employee
was breached.
Clevenger added, "In all fairness,
1 should say that I have dealt with a
couple of employees at the Stanford
substation who were very helpful.
Unfortunately, the bad apples have
set the tone for the entire place."
Some students disagree with Cle
venger, arguing that unhelpful em
ployees are the exception rather than
rule.
"I know there are lots of com
plaints about the Stanford post office.
I've had a P.O. box there for the last
four years and have experienced lirst

hand the long lines and inefficient
services," said Law School student
Ken Yee. "However, I also feel that
many of the students are being too
harsh on the employees."
"I believe that while the majority
of employees are careful and con
cerned about students, there are a
few atypical employees who have a
lack of regard for the Stanford com
munity," Liu said.
"The Postal Service needs to clean
house at the Stanford substation,"
(Revenger said, "and my goal is to get
Senator Feinstein and Congress
woman Kshoo involved to make sure
it happens."
