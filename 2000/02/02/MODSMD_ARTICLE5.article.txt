# Smoke? Fewer frosh do, national survey finds
## 
### DEENA SKOLNICK 
The latest statistics from a na
tionwide survey show a decrease
of 1.6 percent in smoking among
college freshmen. 1 he Higher
Education Research Institute
(HERI) conducted the study, now
in its 34th year, at UCIA.
Although Stanford has fewer
smokers than the national college
average, smoking among all age
groups at Stanford is on the de
cline, according to Ralph Castro,
manager of the Alcohol and
Other Drug Abuse Prevention
Program at Cowell I leath Center.
"The national average [for un
dergraduates who smoke] is hov
ering around 50 percent," he
said. "We are at about 25 [per
cent]."
HERI used data from 261,217
first-year students at 462 two- and

four-year institutions. I he group
reported that the number ol
freshmen who admitted to smok
ing frequently dropped to 14.2
percent, down from 1998's 15.8
percent. This is the second year in
a row that this number has de
creased, following a decade-long
increase in the number <>l incom
ing students who smoke.
I lie data from HERI's 1998
study showed that smoking
among all college students was on
the increase between 199.'$ and
1997. This report, which sur
veyed I 16 four-year colleges,
found that smoking had in
creased 28 percent over these
lour years. The survey that year
also showed tliat institutions in
the Northeast, North-Central,
and South had higher smoking
numbers than those in I he West.
A similar study, done this veat

In the Core Institute in southern
Illinois, also found an increase in
tobacco use between 1995 and
1997. In 1996 44.2 percent, of stu
dents reported that they smoked
frequently. In 1997, that figure
rose to 48.6 percent.
In light of increases in smoking
among all Stanford undergradu
ates, the decrease in freshmen
w ho smoke points to a large num
ber of students who begin to use
tobacco at college after their fresh
man years.
Given this trend, Cowell is
looking into programs for the
prevention and cessation of smok
ing. "At this point, we have . . .
pamphlets on consequences and
risk, how to quit . . . we're updat

how to stop smoking," said Castro.
Castro admits that merelv an
educational venture mav not be
enough. "I think, in essence, we
should be offering ... a (lass on
cessation <>i intervention," he said.
('.astro stressed the need for co
operation between the brandies of
Cowell .ind the students. "Such a
program would based on assessing
need and a want from students . . .
It's imperative we haveevervoneat
(lowell on board . . . We'll need the
expertise of Counseling and Psy
chological Services, I lealth Promo
tion Services and tlu- medical staff."
Cowell is planning its own sur

vey of a cross-section of Stanford
students. I his survey is still in the
planning stages, hut Castro tenta
tively predicts that data should he
available hy the end of the acade
mic: year. The implementation of
any new smoking prevention or
cessation program depends on the
results of the I lealth Services 2000
sin vey and on student interest.
Although the UCLA study was
completed on (an. 24, its other
findings, including the total pet
cent of undergraduates who
smoke, have not yet been made
public. The survey is not broken
up demographically. HKRI's sur
vey includes one ethnic break
down among freshmen who
smoke — African-American ('Ui
percent) and other (10.0 percent).
