Politically active Stanford stu
dents watched with interest yester
day as Arizona Sen. John McCain
trounced Texas Cov. George VV.
Bush in the Republican New
Hampshire primary, and Vice
President /VI Gore squeaked past
former Sen. Bill Bradley on the
Democratic side.
Chough neither the Stanford
Democrats nor the Stanford Re
publicans endorse a single candi
date for their party, members from
each groups expressed strong
opinions about the results of New
Hampshire's primary.
Bryan Hughes, a member of
Stanford Democrats and a Bradley
supporter, said the large number
of independent voters contributed
to Bradley's relative success in
New I lainpshire.
In the lowa caucuses last week,
Bradley only managed to garner
about half as many votes as Gore.
Hughes said that he expected
Gore to defeat Bradley by a wider
margin yesterday than he did, but

said that "Bradley actually has
mote money in the bank" and ex
pects him to last at least through
the California primary, if not
longer.
Chris Desmond, president of
the Stanford Republicans, said
that he "couldn't be more thrilled"
about McCain's victory. He said
that "a McCain-Bradley rate
would be much better for the
country than a Bush-Gore race."
Two Stanford students from
New I lainpshire skipped the pri
mary election altogether. Greta
Braddock, a freshman from Warn
er, N.I 1., said that she is not regis
tered and did not know how to go
about getting an absentee ballot.
Mike Devine, a senior from
I lampton, N.I 1., didn't register in
his home state either.
