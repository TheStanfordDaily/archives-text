# New game simulates life at a university
## 
### URI POMERANTZ 
You shower, throw some clothes on, grab a
cup of coffee and head to the President's Office.
Today, you will make decisions that will affect
an entire University system and thousands of
Students and faculty, from stimulating new re
search to managing parking problems. This is
your life.
Sorry to wake you, but you were dreaming
about retired Graduate School of Business
Prof. Bill Massy's new computer simulation ad
venture, Virtual U.
Similar to the popular computer game
Sim City, in which users build and maintain
virtual cities, Massy's Virtual U allows the
users to call the shots in the management of a
simulated university. You, as the president of
your self-designed institute of higher learn
ing, are held responsible for every aspect of
your system.
Massy said, "Virtual U provides a powerful,
convenient and user-friendly tool by which in
stitutional professionals and interested layper
sons can participate in leadership challenges in
a college or university setting."
More than a simple caricature, Virtual U was

designed using an extensive compilation of
data on the U.S. higher education system to en
sure realism and true simulation.
"Users set, monitor and modify a variety of
institutional parameters and policies, allocate
resources as they see fit and watch as results
continually unfold," he said.
Beyond the data is a graphical interface that
allows users to easily navigate through their
universities in order to monitor and change
preferences. In short: don't let the technical
stuff scare you. The graphics are definitely
there.
Like Sim City, Virtual U comes fully
equipped with dozens of scenarios and unex
pected events that lill each game with a realistic
sense of excitement. For example, the gover
nor may decide to cut appropriations to your
college, a scandal might break out or research
quality may be declining.
The user, playing the role of university pres
ident, is forced to decide how to best deal or not
deal with these issues. Through a series of edu
cated decisions and thoughtful management,
you can have student applications and yield rise
and admissions rates fall to keep the Board of
I rustees happy.

Both Massy and Jesse Ausubel of the Sloan
Foundation are responsible for developing the
idea of Virtual U.
"[Ausubel] came to me to see if I might be in
terested and I had already prepared a prospec
tus and was seeking funding," Massy said.
Ausubel's foundation supported Massy's
project with a $1 million grant.
After the initial project design was complet
ed, the game was programmed in C+ + for use
in Microsoft Windows. The game will be dis
tributed via (11) along with a manual and strat
egy guide.
. Massy worked as a professor, writer and uni
versity administrator for more than 30 years.
He served for 13 years as Stanford's vice
president for business and finance and chief fi
nancial officer. He also earned tenure as a pro
fessor in the Business School.
In 1987 Massy founded the Stanford Insti
tute for Higher Education Research at the
School of Education.
Interested readers can learn more about the
simulation at http://www.virtual-u.org.
Massy's Virtual U is scheduled to be released
in mid-March, and will be available locally at
the Stanford Bookstore.
