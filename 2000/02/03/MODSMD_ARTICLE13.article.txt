nounced during I uesday's ASSU
meeting, including a new housing
draw guide and a new effort to

freshman Henry Towsner will

Internet, ami freshman Mike Osof
skv is working with Dining Services
to create an ingredients list and a
nutritional guide to every entree.
Another project the ASSU is
working on is increasing student
input in the Office of Residential
(.duration's decision making
process. ASSU senators have
begun discussions with ResKd Di

lector Jane (lamarillo.
Undergraduate Senate Chair
Steven Aronowitz said, "Many stu
dents believe that ResKd's conflict
resolution pr<xess is too removed
Irom the student body. We are
working to add a level where stu
dents can participate as peers and
community members. That would
increase the legitimacy of the
process and be in line with the phi
losophy of the ASSIJ constitution."
()ne proposal under considera
tion is a peer review board that
would examine disciplinary deci
sions made by Res Ed.
Finally, the ASSU plans to meet
with representatives from the
Stanford Post Office to discuss is
sues arising from the temporary
relocation; including disability ac
cess, waiting time for packages,
and speed of delivery.
Levin also made a statement to
the Senate body urging them to
continue their dedication to im
proving student life.
Though halfway through his
term, Levin stated, "Our work has
only begun. We're not about to

rest. it you don't feel like you've
been doing enough, now is your
chance."
Levin announced that the Stan
lord After Midnight rogram is
halfway through its trial run, and
the six-week trial periods at
Tresidder Express and the Stan
ford Bookstore are almost com
pleted.
"Stanford After Midnight has
had 13 vendors, over 3,000 fliers,
60 pizzas, 3 Daily ads, 4 Daily arti
cles and 6 banners, but far more
impressive are the over 100 e
mails I've read congratulating the
ASSU on a job well done," Levin
stated.
Vice President John Mills will
join Levin in attending house
meetings every week, and Levin
wants to make a personal effort to
eat in every residence on campus
to give students a chance to voice
their opinions.
GSC talks grad housing
At the Graduate Student Coun
cil meeting on Wednesday night,
the buzz was all about housing sub
sidies for graduate students.
After discussing various issues
on the budget and getting a finan
cial report from Financial Officer

Chris Stromberg, a doctoral stu
dent in chemistry, the GSC fo
cused its attention on the persis
tent problem of inadequate grad
uate housing.
Key to the discussion was the re
duction in the subsidies available
for oil-campus graduate housing
as a result of the new on-campus
apartments currently being built
in Escondido Village.
While GSC members saicl they
recognized that the money for new
housing needs to come from some
where, members saicl that reduc
ing the subsidies would not take
into consideration the possibility
that the new apartments might
also be expensive.
Council member Michael
Bartsch, an engineering doctoral
student, cited the importance that
University officials play in this
process when he said, "We need to
get an idea about what the Provost
knows and what he plans to do
about it."
For students who are con
cerned about these issues, a meet
ing sponsored by the CSC to dis
cuss these issues will be held
tonight at 9 p.m. in Terman 556.
