## Israel holds first nuclear public debate 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) —The first
public parliamentary debate of
Israel's top-secret nuclear
weapons arsenal degenerated
into an ugly confrontation yester
day when an Arab legislator
announced that Israel has up to
300 nuclear warheads, prompt
ing Jewish lawmakers to call him
a spokesman for terrorists.
Military censorship has always
forbidden reports in the local
media about Israel's nuclear arse
nal.
But Issam Mahoul's speech,
broadcast live on television, gave
Israelis their first opportunity to
hear details from one of their
own.
Most Jewish lawmakers
marched out of parliament in
protest.
A visibly uncomfortable Cabi
net minister, Haim Ramon,
responded to Mahoul by repeat
ing Israel's well-known, yet vague
nuclear policy statement, and
refuting Mahoul's premise that
the public lias the right to know.
Ramon said Israel would not
be the first to introduce nuclear
weapons into the Middle East, a
decades-old policy known here as
"ambiguity," implying that Israel
has nuclear arms capability, but
not actual bombs.
Two diplomats from the
Egyptian embassy in Tel Aviv
watched the debate from the
gallery. Egypt has been pressing
for Israel to sign the nuclear non
proliferation treaty and get rid of
the weapons it has never admit
ted having.
Jewish members interrupted
Mahoul's speech with catcalls as
he declared: "All the world
knows that Israel is a vast ware
house of atomic, biological and
chemical weapons that serves as
the anchor for the Middle East
arms race."
Some lawmakers called him a
spokesman for Arab terrorists.
Undeterred, Mahoul went on
to claim that Israel's three new
German-built submarines "will
be fitted with nuclear weapons"
to provide Israel the capacity to
retaliate if hit with a nuclear
attack.
Mahoul said the policy under
mined government claims that its
nuclear threat is a deterrent to
attack.
He warned that the nuclear
stockpile is a hazard, turning
"this little piece of territory
into a nuclear garbage bin, poi
soned and poisoning, that
could send us all up in a mush
room cloud."
