# Rightist Austrian party troubles EU

### 
Union not decided on
how to cope with
Haiders sudden rise
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AT)
A worried and shaken Europe
expressed outrage yesterda\ at
the probable rise of a far-right
party to a share of power in Aus
tria, but laced the dilemma ol try
ing to isolate a democratically
elected government.
I he European Union, always
quick to denounce errant gov
ernments in Africa, the Middle

East and elsewhere, has now
found the devil is within.
Austria's 11 European Union
partners warned Austria on
Tuesdav that il Joerg Haider's
freedom Party enters the Austri
an government they will isolate
the country diplomatically, cut
ting bilateral political contacts
and withholding support for
Austrian candidates lor interna
tional posts.
"We can't choose our neigh
bors, but we can choose our
friends," said Portuguese Prime
Minister Antonio Guterres,
whose country holds the EU
presidency.

Under the ElJ's founding
treaty, there is no provision for
the withdrawal or expulsion of a
member state â€” although sus
pension is possible.
And as long as Austria has not
violated any articles of the treaty,
the EU cannot legally take action
against it.
As a result, Austria's EU part
ners issued their warning as indi
vidual states, outside the EU
framework.
The EU Commission, the
organization's executive body,
issued only a tepid statement,
merely saying it shared the con
cerns of the 14 partner countries.
