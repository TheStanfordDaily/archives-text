# Senate votes to up U.S.minimum wage
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Tee
ing up for an election-year fight,
the Senate approved a Republi
can bill yesterday that would boost
the minimum wage by $ I an hour
over three years, a period of time
President Clinton and Democrats
say is too long to wait.
With many Republicans —
especially in the House — eager
to avoid repeated campaign-sea
son attacks on the widely popular
issue, some increase in the cut rent
$5.15 hourly minimum seems
likely to become law before Elec -
tion Day.
But with the White House and
Democrats also objecting to the
measure's $18 billion in tax cuts
over live years — mostly for small

business owners — it is unclear
what the final version will look
like. The OOP's desire to avoid
making (lie proposal a campaign
issue gives Democrats little incen
tive to quickly settle lor anything
less than what they want: a two
year phase-in, with a much small
er tax package.
I he minimum wage boost was
included in a bill that would over
haul the nation's bankruptcy laws
that the Senate approved by N.'i
-14.
The House approved its own
version ol the bankruptcy legisla
tion last May, but it lacked any
minimum wage provisions.
About I I mill: in Americans
are paid the minimum wage.
