# House votes to support Taiwan despite controversy

### 
Bill, which would
strengthen U.S. ties to
Taiwan, now awaits
Senate approval
WASHINGTON (AF) â€” The
chief sponsor of a bill to strength
en U.S. military ties with Taiwan
suggests its strong sendoff in the
House should help generate sup
port among senators.
"They cannot ignore a huge
vote like this," said House Majori
ty Whip Tom DeLay, R- I exas.
The House approved DeLay's
veto-threatened legislation *^41-70
Tuesday. Its late was less certain
in the Senate, generally more cau
tious on foreign affairs than the
House.
In Beijing, the Foreign Min
istry reacted immediately to the
vote, summoning U.S. Ambas
sador Joseph Prueher to express
"strong indignation."
Vice Foreign Minister Yang
Jieclii told Prueher that the bill
"seriously violated Chinese
sovereignty, grossly interfered in
China's internal affairs," and was
aimed at separating China and
Taiwan.
Taiwanese Defense Minister
I ang Fei said of the House action:
"We welcome any moves that may
enhance Taiwan's security."
In Washington for other busi
ness, Taiwan senior presidential
adviser John H. Chang reacted
cautiously, telling reporters the
Taiwanese "appreciate the con
cern'' of the House over the
island's issue, but view the legisla
tion as "purely a U.S. domestic
issue."
"It's a bill in the U.S. House,
and when it becomes law we will
respect it," Chang said in a news
conference. "We don't know if it
will become a law."
Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., cited his long sup
port for Taiwan but said lie
doesn't want to do anything that
might further complicate already
tense relations between the main
land and the island. "We should
proceed with due diligence," Lott
said.
But Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho,
chairman of the Senate Republi
can Policy Committee, suggested
the legislation could develop con
siderable support in the Senate. "1

don't think we're nervous about
restating our commitment to Tai
wan," he said.
The legislation would lift a
long-standing prohibition on
direct communication and coop
eration among military officials of
the United States and Taiwan,
open American military
academies to more Taiwanese
officers and require annual Pen
tagon reports on threats to Tai
wan's security.
Sponsors portrayed the bill as a
reaction to the reported buildup
of China's missile arsenal along
the Taiwan Strait and continued
Chinese human-rights abuses.
They called it an expansion of
the landmark 1979 Taiwan Rela
tions Act, which allows the United
States to provide military supplies
to Taiwan for use in defending
itself.
The Clinton administration
said the 1979 act should be left
alone.
At the White House, national
security spokesman David Leavy
said tlie bill "would decrease
rather than enhance Taiwan secu
rity and risk the stability of the
entire East Asian region."
If it passes in its present form,
"the president's senior advisers
would recommend that he veto
it," Leavy said.
Even so, the bill is less hard
edged than an earlier version,
which would have authorized the
sale to Taiwan of specific weapons
systems, including a ballistic mis
sile defense, sophisticated radar
warning equipment and conven
tional submarines.
State Department spokesman
James Foley said the bill, even in
its watered-down form, "would
seriously diminish Taiwan's secu
rity and undermine overall U.S.
objectives of stability in Asia."
While a veto threat is on the
table, "We will, in the meantime,
be working hard to persuade the
Congress not to enact it into law,"
Foley said.
The legislative slap at China
comes as the administration
worked to try to build support for
a controversial measure that
would give China permanent
trade benefits to accompany its
expected entry into the World
Trade Organization. A vote on
that measure is expected this
spring.
China regards Taiwan as a
renegade province.
