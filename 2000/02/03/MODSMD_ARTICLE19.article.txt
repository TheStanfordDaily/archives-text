Greenspan believes
action will slow the
economy's growth
WASHINGTON (AP) — Hie
Federal Reserve, still seeking to
slow the supercharged U.S. econ
omy to a more moderate pace of
growth, raised borrowing costs
for millions of Americans for a
fourth time since June by push
ing a key interest rate up a quar
ter point to 5.75 percent yester
day .
I he Fed action to boost its fed
em! funds rate, the interest that
banks charge each other, was
quickly followed by announce
ments from major banks around
the country that they were raising
their prime lending rate a similar

quarter point to 8.75 percent, the
highest level for this benchmark
consumer and business rate since
late 1995.
Wall Street, which had been
worried that the central bank
might feel the need to raise rates
by a half-point, turned in a mixed
performance yesterday with the
Dow Jones industrial average
down 38.85 points at 11,003.20.
Analysts said while the Fed
stopped with just a quarter-point
increase, investors were clearly
worried by the tone of the Fed
announcement, which indicated
further increases were in store.
"This was a much more hawk
ish statement from the Fed today
than any of the statements that
accompanied its three rate hikes
last year," said David Jones, chief
economist at Aubrey G. Lanston
& Co. in New York.

Many economists predicted
the Fed would raise rates again at
the next meeting of its Federal
Open Market Committee on
March 21 and again at the May
16 meeting. Some analysts said
the unrelenting strength of the
economy could prompt a seventh
quarter-point move at the June
28 meeting.
"The Fed wants to bring this
high-flying economy down to a
soft landing," said Richard
Yamarone, an economist at Argus
Research Corp. "The rate
increases so far haven't really
taken a toll on the economy, espe
cially the consumer sector."
While private economists saw
the economic logic behind the
Fed's actions, a small band Fed
critics complained that the central
bank was lighting a phantom
menace.
