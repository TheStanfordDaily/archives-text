# Top schools focus on science, engineering

Stanford and other top uni
versities are making huge new in
vestments in science and engi
neering infrastructure.
Even schools traditionally as
sociated with the humanities and
social sciences have joined the
trend. Yale University, for exam
ple, recently announced an ini
tiative to invest $500 million in
science and engineering facility
upgrades.
Yale's announcement follows
similar, though less ambitious,
programs at Harvard and
Princeton. And last October,
Stanford christened its new $120
million Science and Engineering
Quad, and received a $150 mil
lion donation from Netscape
founder Jim Clark for the new
Bio-X program, which will inte
grate basic science, medicine and
engineering.
"Both Harvard and Yale are
seeking to strengthen and ex
pand both engineering and ap
plied science activities," said Mal
colm Beasley, dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences. "My
sense is that at a deep level, this is
trying to create the proper bal
ance of the modern university
between traditional liberal arts
and engineering."
Yale's plan, which includes the

construction of live buildings,
will increase research space and
upgrade existing classrooms and
labs. In addition, Yale an
nounced that it would create an
"environmental campus" and a
"molecular campus" that would
be connected indoors, allowing
for easier travel between science
facilities.
Yale hopes to revitalize its sci
ence and engineering depart
ments, which, according to the
Yale Office of Public Aff airs, have
been weaker than its arts, hu
manities and social sciences pro
grams.
Beasley said that Stanford, as a
much younger university than
those in the Ivy league, has al
ways placed a larger emphasis on
engineering.
"Is there a greater emphasis
on science and engineering at
Stanford? The answer is sel{-evi
dently yes," said History Prof.
Bart Bernstein.
"Stanford is representative of
a trend in competitive private ed
ucation where more and more
undergraduates are keyed to
personal achievement and suc
cess," said Comparative Litera
ture Prof. Seth Lerer.
However, according to
Beasley and other members of
the humanities faculty, Stan
ford's apparent bias toward engi
neering may not be as large as it
seems.
"The needs in the humanities
are often smaller, because pro-

jects are often on a smaller scale,"
Beasley said.
Bernstein also noted that it is more
expensive to hire faculty in science and
engineering than it is in the humani
ties.
"One of the related problems is that
if a science department wants to hire
somebody, they have to outfit a lab that
may cost hall a million dollars," he said.
"If you want to hire a history professor,

for example, there is no startup cost;
we already have books in history."
Furthermore, Lerer and Beasley
claim that efforts to improve humani
ties programs are harder to measure.
"The school certainly supports initia
tives in the humanities," Beasley said,
"but these humanities efforts have
been more programmatic."
Beasley also pointed out that the
University made a large capital invest
ment last year with the reconstruction
of the Cantor Arts Center.
"Humanities is about people. It's
not about buildings and labs," Lerer

said. "I think everybody recognizes
that it's really hard to recruit and keep
good people because it's much more
amorphous."
Beasley emphasized that Stanford is
committed to providing students with a
high quality of education in all disci
plines.
"Stanford is in the business of pro
ducing very well-educated leaders, in
whatever walk oflife we have programs
in," Beasley said. "And that's exactly
what we should do. We firmly believe
we need to have strong programs in all
the areas we represent."

A count that counts
For a teacher to count heads in a classroom is not a difficult proposition. For the United States Cen
sus Bureau to count and tabulate data on each of the roughly 275 million residents in the nation
is considerably more challenging. Yesterday in the new Bing Wing of Green Library, Cam Mcin
tosh (left) of the Census Bureau presented a report on the plans for the 2000 Census, an issue that
has become particularly contentious in the halls of Congress due to the debates over the use of sta
tistical sampling. Mcintosh led a discussion on the census and demonstrated the American
Fact Finder system that the bureau will use in its count.
