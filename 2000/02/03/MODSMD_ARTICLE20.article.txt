## The
						Stanford Daily House legislation endangers U.S.-China ties 
### 
Yesterday, the house of
Representatives overwhelmingly
approved a bill strengthening
U.S. military ties with Taiwan —
a move that could endanger already tenu
ous U.S.-China relations and possibly
upset the delicate balance that exists in
the Taiwan Straits.
President Clinton immediately
announced his intention to veto the bill,
although the measure passed by a margin
of 341-70, well over the 2/3 majority nec
essary to overturn a veto in the House.

annual American review of Taiwanese
security procedures.
Analysts have argued that the bill will
have little substantive influence on Tai
wan's security situation, but carries a great
deal of rhetorical weight in the fragile
triad of Beijing, Washington and Taipei.
With U.S.-China relations already at a
critically low point following the bombing

could dangerously widen the gap between
Washington and Beijing.

China policy" that recognizes Beijing as
China's only capital.
Both Chinese diplomats and senior
Clinton administration officials have con
demned the measure as damaging to the
relationship with China at an extremely
critical juncture.
More importantly, the passage of the
bill reflects the growing perception that
the U.S. is unable to develop a coherent
policy toward China.
With the legislative and executive
branches split in their stance toward the
China-Taiwan relationship, U.S. policy
appears incongruent at best, confused at
worst.
Congress must realize that the U.S.

interests in the region lie in strengthen

Yes, China has an atrocious human
rights record in its treatment of Chris
tians, democracy advocates and
Tibetans, among others.
Yes, Beijing is making advances to
becoming a regional hegemon.
However, a policy of engagement —
increasing ties between Washington and
Beijing — is far more likely to secure
regional stability and advance U.S. inter
ests than attempting to contain China's
expansion in an adversarial relationship.
The U.S. must learn that a construc
tive policy is far more likely to produce
concessions on human rights, trade and
regional military security.
