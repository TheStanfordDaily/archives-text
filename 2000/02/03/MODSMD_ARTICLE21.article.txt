# Ending the winter quarter malaise
## 
### ELIZABETH REEDS ERIN SCHMIDT GUEST COLUMNISTS 
Generally, it seems that a malaise
hits Stanford students sometime in
the middle of winter quarter, but this
year we were a bit progressive.
After spending a great deal of the
fall in our lounge watching television
(due to various physical ailments) and
developing a distaste for the patri
archy (thanks to Klizabeth and Fem
Studies 101), eventually we got bored.

how perilous that right is. More than
half of Congress can be fairly labeled

effectively negate Roe v. Wade.
The possibility of a constitutional
amendment making abortion once

Partial-Birth Abortion Ban which is so
vaguely worded as to threaten the
legality of all abortions.
Having joined the organization,
