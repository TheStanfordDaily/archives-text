# Ending the winter quarter malaise
## 
### ELIZABETH REEDS ERIN SCHMIDT GUEST COLUMNISTS 
Generally, it seems that a malaise
hits Stanford students sometime in
the middle of winter quarter, but this
year we were a bit progressive.
After spending a great deal of the
fall in our lounge watching television
(due to various physical ailments) and
developing a distaste for the patri
archy (thanks to Klizabeth and Fem
Studies 101), eventually we got bored.
Fnter our scrappy Resident Assi
tant, Pubby, a dogooder by nature,
whose forays into the world of public
service left us suffering from feelings
of inadequacy. Just at the moment
when our cognizance of being spoiled
brats was ;it its apex, Fli/.abeth came
back to Phi Sig one day and
announced that she had found the
light at the end of the tunnel.
A pro-choice organization was
forming on campus and meeting that
weekend. Though it meant passing
on The Simpsons and braving the ele
ments, we agreed to check it out.
Though both of us had always

thought of ourselves as strongly pro
choice and supported pro-choice can
didates, neither of us had realized
that we had been taking our rights for
granted. It had been an act of blind
faith to believe that just because abor
tion was legal and presumably accessi
ble now, it always would be.
We were confronted with facts that
solidified our previously held opin
ions, and helped us to redefine what
pro-choice was all about.
Information about the threat to
choice made us actively concerned
about the issues. It was one thing to
be supportive of a woman's right to
choose; it was quite another to realize
how perilous that right is. More than
half of Congress can be fairly labeled
anti-choice and pursuing ways to
effectively negate Roe v. Wade.
The possibility of a constitutional
amendment making abortion once
again illegal is frightening, as is the
Partial-Birth Abortion Ban which is so
vaguely worded as to threaten the
legality of all abortions.
Having joined the organization,
Stanford Students for Choice shortly
after its conception, we have had the
opportunity to be involved in its
growth as we and our definitions of
pro-choice grow.
As we form goals and work to
achieve them, we have found our
selves thinking outside of the oft
mentioned Stanford bubble.
The organization's points of focus
are two-fold: meeting the needs of the

Stanford community and voicing
those needs to the poweis-that-be in
Sacramento and Washington D.C.
The connection has brought back a
feeling of enfranchisement that seems
too often lost in today's society.
Instead of feeling overwhelmed
and impotent, we have recognized
that we really do have the power to
make a difference.
As we have worked within Stanford
Students for Choice to connect Stan
ford and Washington on this issue, we
linked abortion to other issues of sex
uality and reproduction.
One reason this organization is so

appealing to us is its role in building
a community. One can describe the
group and its meetings using the four
Cs: cool, calm, collected, and casual . .
. with a sense of humor.
Decisions are arrived upon by con
sensus, which tends to make meetings
spill over, but that's okay due to oui
outrageously scrumptuous snacks.
Despite young numbers at Stan
lord Students for Choice meetings,
the membership is diverse, bringing a
wealth of backgrounds, experiences
and viewpoints. Many of these people
are quickly becoming our role mod
els. What we share is our committ

ment to pro-choice activism; our dif
ferences only serve to make us
stronger.
We're the better for our experi
ences with Stanford Students for
Choice.
We're enlightened and active, and
a larger portion of our television bud
get is devoted to CNN's Headline
News.
What started as a blind venture
into the world of activism has become
an integral part of our world view as
well as one of the most rewarding
things we've been involved with this
vear. lake that Pubby.

In 1862 Thomas Edison printed the
"Weekly Herald" and distributed it to
train passengers traveling between
Port Huron and Detroit, Michigan. It
was the first time a newspaper had
been printed on a train!
