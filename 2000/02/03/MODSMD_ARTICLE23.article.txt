Constitutional Council debate continues
The Daily's Feb. 2 editorial criticizing
tlie Constitutional Council's procedural
rules because they focus on written
arguments rather than oral presenta
tions is wholly absurd.
When the U.S. Supreme Court hears
a case, all arguments are submitted in
writing via briefs which carefully outline
each party's position. Oral arguments
before the Court serve mainly to clarify
for the justices what they have already
read.
There is no debate. The real and most
important dialogue and deliberation
occur among the justices in private.
Similarly, the Constitutional Council
will undoubtedly debate the case in pri
vate as it performs its proper judicial
function.
In rejecting the Council's guidelines,
the Editorial Board is implying that a pro
cedure employed by the highest court in
the land is not good enough for the ASSU.
How flattering that I he Daily would hold
us to such an impressive standard.

We were dismayed to read Under
graduate Senator Spence's comments in
Tuesday's article on the Constitutional
Council's first case.
"Undergraduate Senator Matt
Spence, a senior, said that the Council's
decision is not necessarily the last word
for future councils.
" 'I would think any body would be
guided by precedent but would have the
freedom to amend or update a decision
as it sees fit,' he said."
The Constitutional Council exists as a
body independent of both the ASSU
executive and legislative branches; as
such, it is inappropriate lot a member of
the legislative branch to make seeming
ly official statements regarding the use
of precedent by the Council in reaching
its decisions.
To see this, one need only imagine
the uproar that would result if a mem
ber of the U.S. House of Representa
tives, in the midst of a press conference,
began detailing her / his opinion of how
the U.S. Supreme Court should conduct
its affairs.
The ASSU Constitution is quite clear
on the role of the Council in student
government at Stanford, as well as the
roles of the

executive and legislative branches. We
can only hope that future statements by
ASSU legislators will more clearly reflect
an understanding of those distinct roles.

Atheism not without violence
I hope I'm not the only one shocked
by T.Q. Shang's statement that "vio
lence over atheistic beliefs" is unheard
of.
From the annihilation of Christians
and Muslims by Hitler and Stalin to the
present torture and execution of Falun
Gong members by the Chinese govern
ment, the majority of "religious" vio
lence in this century has been by atheists
against believers.
More Christians have died for their
beliefs in the 20th Century than all pre

vious centuries combined, and we have
atheism to thank for that.
MARK W'lS l EV

Atheism has never given rise to vio
lence? Apparently this is self-evident to
T.Q. Shang (yesterday's Letters to the
Editor). I guess Shang's history classes
conveniently ended prior the 20th Cen
tury and the works of Stalin and Hitler.
I know the inevitable objection now:
those two men and their regimes are not
valid representatives of atheism and
atheistic thought.
That's my point exactly. To suggest
that the Christian crusades or a few
Islamic rebels demonstrate the
inevitable outcome of religious belief is
silly.
The fact is that humans have been
killing each other for thousands of years
and have used every excuse in the book
to do so including religion, Social Dar
winism, atheism and the newest entrant,
mental anguish (see Columbine).
A much more interesting and infor
mative debate would be: What is the
root of human violence, and what steps
can we take to overcome this tendency?

Within my own religious beliefs is a
framework to help answer this question.
As 1 see it, this is the role of religion
or the humanistic philosophies that
Shang mentions, not that of a scapegoat.
