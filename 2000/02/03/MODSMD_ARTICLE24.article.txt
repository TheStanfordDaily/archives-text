# EU threatens to sever diplomatic ties with Austria over third party
## 
### BEN JONES OPINIONS EDITOR 
In an unprecedented move, the mem
ber-nations of the European Union voted
Monday to end all diplomatic ties with
Austria should the country allow Jorg
Haider, leader of the Freedom Party, to
enter a coalition government.

DAILY OP-ED

Haider, the governor of the southern
province of Carinthia, has been con
demned in the international arena for his
seemingly xenophobic, anti-immigration
views.
Alter the Social Democrats and People's
Party were unable to form a coalition to

run Austria's government following recent
elections, Haider has entered into negotia
tions with the Social Democrats, who were
the leading vote-getters in the election, to
form a coalition that would control 104 of
the 183 seats in the Austrian legislature.
Haider, whose party advocates a tight
ening of Austrian immigration restrictions
and preventing the expansion of the EU,
has drawn deserved criticism for his sup
port of certain Nazi labor policies and con
gratulatory remarks about the SS divisions
of Hitler's army.
Israel, which has closely followed
Haider's ascension to power, reiterated an
earlier threat to halt all diplomatic rela
tions with Austria should he come to
power.
The response of the EU, however, was

extraordinarily shocking. Never before
has the 15-inember organization threat
ened to censure a member-state in such a
fashion.
But in an even greater context, this
decision raises the question about the abil
ity of multi-national coalitions, or even
powerful states, to dictate the internal pol
itics of sovereign nations.
One could easily contrast the swift and
decisive EU response with the relative
inaction of the European community to
the rise of Hitler's government in Ger
many, which, similar to 1 laider's party,
came to power not by force or coup, but
through the power of the ballot box.
In the 1930s it took tanks moving into
the countries of central Europe to evoke a
response from Britain and the continental

powers. In light of the failure of the
Munich Conference to guarantee "peace in
our time," one cannot help but recognize
the intent of the European Community to
prevent, at all costs, the rise of another
powerful, totalitarian government.
Just as Austria has been put in a difficult
position by the threats, the situation is
equally problematic for the Union itself.
The organization must attempt to enact
measures which benefit the European
community as a whole, (which this decision
will do assuming the destructive effects of
a rise of I laider's party), while at the same
time preserving the sovereignty and
integrity of its constituent states.
In the current geo-political landscape,
many of the hard and fast boundaries
which dominated the state-oriented inter

national model have eroded in the (ace of
growing interdependence among nations
and such factors as free information
exchange through global telecommunica
tions.
This change will likely heighten the
power of multinational groups to exert
influence over states as in the case of the
EU and Austria.
For the EU itself, this decision repre
sents one of the most prominent examples
of the organization exerting its influence.
Primarily thought to be an agency of eco
nomic cooperation, this foray into the
democratic affairs of a member state could
signal an expansion of the coalition's
power and the ability of the constituent
states to come together on pressing issues
in areas other than economics.
