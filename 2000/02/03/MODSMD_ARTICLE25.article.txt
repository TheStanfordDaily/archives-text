DANIEL SINTON/The Stanford Daily
Freshman Curtis Borchardt attempts a lay-up against Washington State last Saturday. The Car
dinal swept the Washington schools at home last weekend. This weekend, Stanford travels to
Los Angeles to face the UCLA Bruins tonight at 7:30 p.m.and the USC Trojans on Saturday
night at 5 p.m.. The games will prove pivotal in determining Pac-10 domination, as Stanford
and USC are tied for first in the Pacific-10 Conference.
