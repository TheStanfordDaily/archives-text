1 farris in particular will certain

step in for graduating senior Jeff
Cronshagen at left tackle and take
over the responsibility of protect
ing the quarterback's blind side.
At Newark High School, Harris
didn't allow a sack for three years in
a row, during which his team won
three straight Delaware state titles.
I lie (i-looi-7, '120-pound tackle
picked Stanford over a host of suit
ors, including Michigan, Miami
(Fla.), Tennessee, Penn State,
L ( .L\aiul Wisconsin. Willingham
wanted him so badly that he made
a trip to Delaware in the midst of
the recent blizzards on Fast Coast
— where the multi-talented Harris
made the coach dinner.
Stanford's other top recruit is
Brandon Royster, a 6-foot, 190-
pound running back out of Fairfax
High School in Fairfax, V'a. Notre
Dame, Virginia and Virginia lech
missed out on Royster, who verbal
ly committed to the Cardinal two

weeks ago.
Asked if Royster would get play
ing time this year Willingham said
"In Brandon's case . . . there's
probably a strong possibility that if
he lias the ability that we think, he
might be able to come in and com
pete for some time."
The rest of Stanford's recruits
are: linebacker David Bergeron
Oswego, Ore.), defensive
end Scott Scharff (Wisconsin
Rapids, Wise.), wide receiver Nick
Sebes (Mount Carmel, Pa.), tight
end Alex Smith (Denver, Colo.),
tight end Will Svitek (Newbury
Park), cornerback O.J. Atogwe
(Windsor, Canada), quarterback
Ryan Eklund (Federal Way,
Wash.), running back Kenneth
Mc(landless (Albuquerque, N.M.),
cornerback Leigh Torrence (At
lanta, Ga.) and cornerback Stanley
Wilson (Carson).
Meanwhile, Stanford is still in
hot pursuit of two recruits out of the
San Diego area — Teyo Johnson, a
6-fix)t-7,245-pound defensive line
man, and Anion Gordon, a 6-fbot
-3,270-pound linebacker.
Johnson is the brother of Stan
ford linebacker Riall Johnson,
which might be a factor in attracting
the defensive lineman, one of the
top unsigned prospects in the na
tion.
The two have said they would
prefer to attend school together.
Johnson also has said he wants the
opportunity to play quarterback in
football and basketball as well.
