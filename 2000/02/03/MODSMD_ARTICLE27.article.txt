# Women host No. 17 UCLA Bruins tonight at home
## 
### MAUREEN MULLEN 
The Cardinal women's basketball team
will play perhaps its most important game of
tlie conference season tonight when it bat
tles No. 17 UCLA at 7:30 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion. At stake is a place atop the Pacific
10 Conference standings.
Stanford (12-5, 5-2 Pac-10) comes into
the game tied for second in the league after
losing a close game last week to Washington.
A win tonight would assure it a share of the
first place spot with UCLA.
The Bruins (12-5, 6-1) are coming off an
upset home loss against Oregon last Satur
day, and currently are alone atop the Pac-10
standings.
Cardinal head coach Tara VanDerveer
acknowledges the importance of the game
but recognizes that the season is long.
"It is only one game," she said, "and our
team is really good at focusing at the game
we are playing, not looking at records or
anything, but just coming out and playing
well."
The Cardinal faces a formidable chal
lenge in UCIA. The squad contains many
talented players including 1999 Pac-10 Play
er of the Year Maylana Martin.
Martin currently leads the Pac-10 in re
bounds and is third in scoring. She will be a
threat Stanford will need to contain both of
fensively and defensively.
However, VanDerveer emphasized that
UCLA has many players in key roles. "She
[Martin] is not all they have," VanDerveer
said, "part of what makes her good is that
she lias many other very talented players
around her, but you can't concentrate on
hi r because you have Janae Hubbard, Erica
Gomez, (Marie) Philman and a lot kids off
their bench."
Stanford has some weapons of its own
.Currently one of the Cardinal's greatest
strengths is its perimeter shooting. The
team leads the NCAA in three-point shoot
ing percentage at 43.4 percent. Three of the
top four three-point shooters in the Pac-10
play for the Cardinal, including freshman
Jamie Carey, who holds the highest three
point percentage in the conference.
But outside shooting isn't the only
strength. Stanford will rely heavily on post
players Carolyn Moos, a junior, and sopho
more Bethany Donaphin to control the
tempo of the game in the paint.
"()ur posts have really stepped up in our

last games," VanDerveer said. "This is going
to be a battle in t he trenches, we are going to
count on our post players to really get in
there and mix some things up with Maylana
and Hubbard."
Rebounding and defense will be the key
to the game for Stanford. The Cardinal
needs to limit UCLA's second-chance shots
;is well as itshigh-percentageshots.
