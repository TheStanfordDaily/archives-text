# Abrams and Kim to compete in Dallas
## 
### SAMEER AHMED CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Senior (.coll' Ahrams and ju
nior Alex Kim, ranked fourth and
sixth in the nation respectively,
will represent the No. 3 Stanford
men's tennis team as they fare the
top players in the country'at the

I I A Individual Indoor Champi
onships in Dallas, Texas Feb. 3-6.
While the tournament, the
third leg of the collegiate Grand
Slam, will not affect the team com
petition, it is very important to the
players' individual rankings and
seeding at the NCAA Individual
(championships in May.

"This tournament is like a
mini-NCAA Championship," as
sociate coach John Whitlinger
said. "It is an honor just to be in
cluded in the Held, and winning
t he tourna. nent is an even greater
accomplishment."
Kim, the six seed in the tour
nament draw, qualified for the

tournament in singles when he
defeated teammate and doubles
partner Abrams, 6-4, 1-6, 6-4 in
the finals of the lIA Regional
Championships on Nov. 9 in
Seattle, Wash.
As a result of strong early sea
son play, fourth-seeded Abrams
received a wild-card entry in the
singles draw despite his runner
up finish to Kim in the regional
championship.
In doubles, Kim and Abrams
are ranked first nationally. The
duo qualified for the tournament
by winning the title at the IIA Ail-
American Championships in
Austin, Texas on Oct. 18.
So far this year, the team has
won the singles and doubles titles
of every tournament it has en
tered. The level of competition at
the tournament this weekend,
however, will be one of the high
est that the players have faced.
"While I'm not sure this win
ning streak can continue, [Kim
and Abrams] are both capable of
winning this tournament,"
Whitlinger said. "They are defi
nitely two of the top players in the
country."
Another setback challenging
the team is the loss of sophomore
K.J. Hippensteel, the No. 1 play
er in the country. Hippensteel
was diagnosed with a case of
mononucleosis on Jan. 14 at the
National Collegiate Tennis Clas
sic in Thousand Oaks, Calif, and
has been sidelined ever since.
