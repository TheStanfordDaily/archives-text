# Women compete in Rolex Invitational
## 
### BILL HANSON STAFF WRITER 
Without sophomore sun Maris
sa li-vin and senior veteran Teryn
Ashley, you'd think the top-ranked
Cardinal wouldn't stand a chance
this weekend at the 2000 Rolex Na
tional Indoor Championships, to
be played at the Brookhaven Coun
try Club in Dallas, Tex.
Stanford, however, currently
boasts one of the deepest squads in
collegiate tennis history. Although
neither Irvin nor Ashley will partic
ipate in the individual tournament,
Stanford, which will send sopho
more Lauren Kalvaria and fresh
man I .aura Granville to compete in
singles, is still considered a formida
ble threat to the field.
Kalvaria is currently ranked a ca
reer-high 13th in the nation alter
reaching the finals of the Intercolle
giate Tennis Association's Regional
Championships in November. In the
Cardinal's first dual matches of the
season, Kalvaria exploited the mo
mentum she established in the fall,
winning all of her singles matches.
On Tuesday, Kalvaria posted a
difficult three-set win over Univer
sity of the Pacific's Anouk Sinnige.
"While 1 was playing, I began to
think that I couldn't play like this
and still do well in Dallas," Kalvaria
said. "But you can't think like that.
You have to take it match by
match."
After dropping the second set,
Kalvaria snapped out of her funk
and dominated the third set, 6-1,
again hitting her trademark top
spin forehand with authority.
"I'd really like to do well in Dal
las," Kalvaria said. "Indoors isn't
my surface, but on the other hand,
I can definitely play on indoor
courts. I think I'm ready."
Granville also seems ready for
the tournament. She has not lost a
match since falling to UCLA's
Amanda Basica in early January.
Granville has enjoyed an im
pressive debut season, capturing
the ITA Regional Championships
in November and watching her

ranking vault to second in the na
tion. She has compiled a 1(5-2 sin
gles record.
"Laura will be seeded," said
head coach Frank Brennan. "But
this tournament has the nation's
very best players. Ibis is just a test. I
don't have any specific expecta
tions. I just want Laura and Lauren
to get some experience."
Both Granville and Kalvaria will
also compete in the doubles draw.
Granville will partner with
sophomore Keiko Tokuda, while
Kalvaria will team with long- time
doubles partner sophomore
Gabriela Lastra.
Kalvaria and lustra, who have

competed together since their ju
nior days but have struggled re
cently, were on top of their games
against Pacific on Tuesday, taking
their No. 1 doubles match without
dropping a game.
"Lastra and Kalvaria have found
their way out of the woods as a dou
bles team," Brennan said. "Hope
fully, they're home now."
Kalvaria agreed.
"I'm taking the forehand side
these days, which I haven't done
since we first started out," she said.
"Our game had become a little
stale, but now it's back. We were
very excited to qualify for Dallas,
because we need opportunities."
Ashley, a veteran star who has
been ranked as high as fourth in the
nation, is in an awkward position.
She tailed to qualify for Dallas lor
the first time in her collegiate career
after witnessing her ranking drop

to a dismal 74 this fall. Ashley's play
has Ix'cn inconsistent during her
recovery from tendinitis in her
wrist.
" The fact that I qualified for Dal
las the last three years but not this
year is strange," Ashley said. "But
I'm not bothered by it at all. I'll just
use it as motivation for the rest of
the season."
Irvin, who last year readied the
finals of the NCAA Individuals and
finished the season ranked second
in the nation, has not played in
enough collegiate events this season
to qualify for Dallas.
Instead, Irvin participated in
professional tournaments over the
last few months, recently falling to
eventual champion Lindsay Daven
port in the second round of the
Australian Open. Irvin will, howev
er, play for the Cardinal for the rest
of tlie season.
