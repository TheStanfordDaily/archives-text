### MATT LONG 
In its first tournament since November, the
Stanford men's golf team secured its fourth top
live finish of the season, tying for fifth place with
the UCIA Bruins.
T he Cardinal, ranked No. 11 nationally, faced a
field of six top-25 teams and an unfamiliar style
course aJ the Ping Arizona Intercollegiate in Tus
con.
"T his tournament showed us how we pro
gressed over the winter," junior Alex Aragon said.
We don t get as much practice as some teams due
to the rain and winter weather here."
Head coach YVally Coodwin agreed that the
weather conditions played a role in the team's
play. "We putted on hard and last greens at the
tourney, but here the greens have been wet and
muddy, said Coodwin.
Individually, Stanford's top finishers were se
nior captain Dusty Brett and freshman Ron Won.
Brett, ranked No. 34 nationally, tied for 12th place
at three-over-par and Won finished 22nd. Round
ing out the top 50 were Aragon and junior Jimmy
Lee, currently ranked 37th nationally.
I he course's narrow fairways lined with cactus
and brush proved challenging to the Cardinal.
1 uscon's Raven (iolfCluh is the only desert course
Stanford will play thi* year.
"I can't complain," Brett said. "1 felt I played
pretty well. I didn't score as well as I'd like to, but
it is a desert course, so you get panicked and have
to hit accurately."
Another challenge the Stanford team faced was
finishing only 32 of the 30 holes on the first day of
play. Stanford was required to complete the round

the next morning and did not fare well.
"On the last four holes of the second and third
rounds we didn't play our best overall," Aragon
said.
Furthering the difficulty ofthe tournament, the
field included ten golfers ranked in the top 50 na
tionally. T op individual players were No. 5 Ari
zona's Ricky Barnes, who took home the individ
ual medalist honors with a nine-undei -par total
and USC junior Nick Jones, who finished at five
under-par.
USC, unranked in the top 25, won the tourna
ment, beating out Arizona by seven strokes.
Stanford next tees it up Feb. 17 at the Waikoloa
golf Course in kona, I lawaii. The team is current
ly deciding who will play in that tournament
through qualification. Brett will compete as well as
freshman Jim Seki, who lives in Honolulu. Ac
cording to Coodwin, Aragon and Lee will most
likely be on the roster. The Cardinal will be with
out Won though, who earlier this month beat out
100 other dullers to earn a spot as an amateur at
the PCA's Buick Invitational.
The next three weeks will be a welcome time of
preparation and focus for the team, as the I lawai
ian course promises to lest the golfer's ability to
adapt to elements such as wind and rain.
"In I lawaii we may have to deal with winds up
to 30 mph " (Goodwin said, "so we'll be working on
hitting our drives lower."
Brett sees putting and chipping as in need of
work too but is optimistic, saying that "we all need
to work on our short games a lot. But if we stick
with our same routines, practice hard, work hard,
prepare be tyre we get there and have fun when we
get there, we'll be fine."
