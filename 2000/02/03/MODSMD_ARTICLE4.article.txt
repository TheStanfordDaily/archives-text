# Rising costs in Silicon Valley put damper on faculty recruiting
## House Hunting 
### AMY L. KOVAC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The future of Stanford's prestigious pool
of faculty could be in danger because of the
escalating price of housing in the Silicon Val
ley, according to faculty and staff who are
working on the issue.
While the University has been concerned
with housing for faculty and students since
its inception in 1891, the housing problem,
especially for faculty members, has become
so acute that Assoc. Provost Jeff Wachtel said
it "has become a crisis situation in the last two

to three years."
"Housing has always been an issue for in
coming faculty here and also for the reten
tion of faculty because this area is more ex
pensive than other parts of the country. It
used to be that we could neutralize housing
as a factor by using special programs" to help
faculty members cover their housing costs,
Wachtel said.
These programs, which impact the pur
chase of homes both on and off campus,
have included a housing al
lowance available tor a fixed peri
od of time, a down payment assis
tance loan and a mortgage assis
tance loan that is set at a low inter
est rate.
While the University continues
to provide these programs, hous
ing problems persist, making re
cruiting and retaining top-quality
faculty difficult.
According to Wachtel, "There
is no doubt that there are several
people who told us that housing
was among the most important
factors in why they didn't come"
to Stanford.
In response to these housing
problems, in October 1999, Uni
versity Provost John Hennessy
created the Provost's Committee
on Faculty Housing.
The committee is currently re
searching the issues and will make

recommendations to Hennessy
about how to alleviate the prob
lem.
Franklin Orr, dean of the
School of Earth Sciences and chair
of the housing committee, ex
plained the current housing situa
tion in terms of job growth.
"Between 1990 and 1998, in
the eight Peninsula communities
around Stanford, 79,000 new jobs
were created, but less than 9,000
new housing units have been
built."
While Orr said that "when
someone turns us down for a job,
we don't know what their motiva
tion is," he acknowledged that
"we know that housing was a fac
tor in a lot of cases."
Several newer faculty members
who have been recruited in the
last live years echoed Orr's com
ments, and said that the local real
estate market was a major concern
for them when they were deciding
whether to come to Stanford.
Asst. English Prof. Gavin Jones, who
came to Stanford in August 1999, said
"Housing is definitely a factor" for facul
ty when thinking about coming to Stan
ford.
Jones lives in San Francisco because,
he said, "it is cheaper and there are more
apartments in San Francisco."
I fowever, Jones cited many problems
with living so far away from campus.
"In all the institutions that 1 have
worked in, 1 have been able to walk to
work, and 1 feel that a sort of communi
ty is created when you live so close to the
University," Jones said.
"I don't like commuting and being
separated from the University. It affects
your scholarship too because the library
is not right outside of your front door."
Other faculty members have ex
pressed frustrations with the difficulty of

finding housing on or near campus.
Robert Reich, assistant professor of
political science, came to Stanford in
September 1998 and has since experi
enced difficulties in finding housing.
Reich and his wife rent a house on
campus but must share it with three
other people "because that is the only
way that we can afford the rent," Reich
said.
Reich noted that the assistance pro
grams that exist only help faculty mem
bers who are looking to buy a home and
do not make any provisions for rental as
sistance.
"Housing was the most significant
concern about joining Stanford as a fac
ulty member and unless it is addressed,
it is a reason for myself and other people
to give consideration about leaving and
living elsewhere," Reich said.
.Asst. Applied Physics Prof. Kathryn
Moler was hired in 1997 and came to
Stanford in 1998 from Princeton.
When hired, Moler was aware of the
housing difficulties and talked to the

Faculty Staff Housing office about the
options available to her and based on the
information she received, she thought
that she would be able to afford a condo
minium in the- Peter Coutts area.
When Moler arrived in 1998, howev
er, real estate prices had risen from
roughly $280,000 to $400,000, and she
was no longer able to afford housing.
112 ler next attempt to find housing was
to bid on a unit in the Fearce Mitt hell
complex, but she was twice outbid. Fi
nally, she got a mortgage broker and,
with help from her family, she was able
to find a place in Falo Alto.
Moler admitted that she "is better off
than other junior faeull) here" because
of assistance from her family, but added,
"I didn't know how bad it was and when
1 didn't get a condo, it was not clear that
I could stay here."
"1 believe that Stanford won't be the
great university that it is now in 15 years
if something isn't done about the hous
ing problems, for faculty and graduate
students," she said.
