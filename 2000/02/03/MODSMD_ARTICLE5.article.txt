The Graduate School of
Business was ranked third
behind Harvard and Whar
ton at the University of Penn
sylvania in a recent Financial
Times survey that listed the
world's top business schools.
"Stanford marches to its
own drummer," said Robert

Joss, Business School dean.
"The difference between
[numbers] one and three is
not statistically significant."
The current attractiveness
of Internet start-ups is con
tinuing to give Stanford an
edge in the market, however.
The Financial limes men
tioned that Stanford's Busi
ness School graduates report
the highest salaries in the
business sector for the class of
1996, as the 1 1 Stanford
grads that responded earned
an average of $303,900 each.

London's Financial Times ranked the Graduate School of Business third among the world's business
schools, behind Harvard and Wharton at University of Pennsylvania. U.S. News & World Report, how
ever, places Stanford at number one.
