# Summer session offers slim pickings for financial aid
## 
### ANNE CORTINA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the University of California schools
have recently begun to seek state funding to
financially support students who want to
take summer classes, Stanford is continuing
its longstanding policy of reserving a large
majority of financial aid money for the acad
emic year.
The increasing number of Stanford stu
dents interested in summer study face a far
more difficult financial situation than their

counterparts at the UC schools.
The UC schools are trying to convince
students to attend classes over the summer
to alleviate overcrowding problems.
According to Cynthia Hartley, director of
student awards, part of the reason Stanford stu
dents do not receive much aid to take summer
classes is that Stanford is able to control the
number of students admitted and doesn't have
a problem with overcrowding.
At Stanford, financial aid money is allo
cated for three quarters a year. Students
who decide to not use aid money for au

tumn, winter or spring quarters are eligible
to receive summer quarter financial aid.
Students looking for a fourth quarter of
financial aid can apply for it in April, but are
unlikely to receive any.
"Very few [students] are eligible for fi
nancial aid over the summer," Hartley said.
There are no plans to increase financial
aid for Summer Session at this point. How
ever, the number of students studying over
the summer has been increasing over the
past few years, including a nine percent rise
last year, according to Carie Faszholz, direc

tor of student services for Summer Session.
Of the 2,020 students enrolled at Stan
lord in the summer of 1999, only 201 were
Stanford undergraduates.
Nearly 1,000 graduate students attended
classes, and the remainder was comprised of
visitors from other high schools, colleges
and graduate schools.
Faszholz speculated that Stanford under
graduates are less likely to attend classes over
the summer for a variety of reasons. One is
the selection ol courses; if the faculty is not
willing to teach over the summer, the cours
es will not be available.
"Students know the courses better than
we do," she said. "Sometimes the courses
that they need or want are not on there."

l'as/hol/. admitted, though, that lack of li
iiaiu ial aid may be a fac tor in students' deci
sions ol whether to enroll in summer session.
"It's partially the expense," she said.
1 here is also another side to the financial
aid storv. Students who receive grants, loans
and work study are expected to be doing
everything they can to raise money them
selves.
"We expect that students will work [over
(lit- summer] and contribute toward the cost
of their education," 1 lartley said.
