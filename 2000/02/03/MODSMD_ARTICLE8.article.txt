### ERIC SHEN 
Representatives from Stan
ford and the Palo Alto Unified
School District have narrowed to
three the list of prospective sites
for a new middle school for the
district, according to former
School Board President Don
Way.
One of the three remaining
sites is on Stanford land on Deer
Creek Road; the other two are in
Palo Alto. Another site that Stan
ford once proposed, at the inter
section of Page Mill Road and Ju
nipero Serra Boulevard, was re
moved from consideration be
cause of traffic concerns.
The two Palo Alto locations
under consideration are the for
mer Terman Junior High School
site on Arastradero Road, whi< h
is currently occupied by the Jew -
ish Community Center, and the
former (lubberly High School
site on Middlefield Road, now in
use as a civic community center.
According to The Palo Alto
Weekly, Way said the district
would prefer the Terman site,
but the effects each site will have
on the community have to be
weighed before a final decision is
reached.
Way spoke before the Santa
Clara County Board of Supervi
sors, who are now discussing
Stanford's Land Use Plan.
Talks between the school dis
trict and Stanford have been on
and off for over a year, with in
tense discussions since last No
vember.
"We continue to have intense,
facilitated, regularly-arranged
meetings," Way said.
No deadline for a final deci
sion has been set, although Stan
ford's Director of Government
and Community Relations Larry
Horton said, "It's in everybody's
interest to resolve things sooner
rather than later."
"Schools are important to us,"
he added, "[and] we're working
cooperatively with the school dis
trict . . . We're pleased with the
excellent working relationship
we have with the school district."
