FELLOWSHIPS AND GRADUATE RESEARCH ASSISTANTSHIPS
j FOR 2000-2001
ontingent upon renewal, the Mac Arthur Consortium in International Peace and Cooperation provides fellowships and research
fassistantships for doctoral students working on dimensions of change affecting international peace and cooperation in con
temporary global society.
Funding will go primarily to doctoral students at Stanford, but some fellowship funds are available for advanced doctoral stu
dents writing their dissertations, and for postdoctoral scholars outside Stanford. All applicants must show the connection
between their work and one or more of the following dimensions of change affecting international peace and cooperation in
global society:
• war and peace in historical context
• global governance and transnational norms
• environmental sustainability and social justice
• production, performance, and representation of identities.
Historical work that can illuminate these dimensions is eligible for funding. In all cases, the relevance to contemporary
issues of international peace and cooperation must be stated explicitly in the application. Eligible disciplines include, for
example, anthropology, economics, education, engineering, history, law, political science, psychology, and sociology.
