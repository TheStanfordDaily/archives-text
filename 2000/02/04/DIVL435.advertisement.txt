Digital revolution courtesy of DSPs
from Texas Instruments. Cool.
You might be surprised to know that we tech heads and headbangers have something
in common. Like a real appreciation for music, as well as for digital solutions. • At
Texas Instruments, our digital signal processing (DSP) technology is a catalyst behind
the digital revolution. For example, portable Internet audio players that deliver
superior-quality digital music that you can connect with any standard, anytime,
anywhere. • In addition, Tl DSPs are as diverse as the markets they drive. We're the
driving force of the digital world, including 70% of the digital cell phones, the next
generation of digital cameras, and even your Internet Service Provider - we can put
more than six modem connections on one Tl DSP chip. • With nearly a 50% share of
the DSP market, we see the future, and we invite you to explore it. Whether you want
to be the next innovative software, DSP, or analog engineer; marketing guru; or sales
leader, the future is no longer out there, it's here. Texas Instruments. Powerful.
Programmable. Engines of Intelligence. • We're the world leader in DSP and analog
(the electronic components that feed the DSP). So get on-line with Texas Instruments.
Non-tech heads are welcome, too. www.ti.com
