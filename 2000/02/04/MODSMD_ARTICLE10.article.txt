I he Academic Council's meeting yesterday,

sues of student' misconduct laws, Stanford li
braries and new technologies on campus.
I he Senate approved the Student Judicial
(Charter Amendment, extending the amount of
time the University lias before filing charges
against a student accused of misconduct.
I)ean of Students Marc Wais said, "Lssential
ly, it's designed to provide the I Diversity with
greatei freedom and latitude to pursue alleged
violations ol the I lonor Code and Fundamen
tal Standard." .
"The current statute of limitation litrees the
I niversitv to lile a charge against the student
within six months of the alleged violation,"
Wais said.
I lie new policy would require Stanford to

file a charge within six
months from tlu- time that
the University is made aware
of the alleged violation.
I lie Board on Judicial Af
fairs, which consists of six fac
ulty, six students and three
staff members, proposed and
unanimously approved the
amendment. Both branches

of the ASSU, the Undergraduate Senate and
the Graduate Senate Council have also ap
proved the amendment.
I lie amendment will now be forwarded to
President Gerhard Casper, whose signature
will plat e it in effect immediately.
I lie Senate also discussed the Stanford li
braries.
According to the Committee on Libraries'
annual report, the aims of the Green Library

West reconstruction project were "to stiffen the

spaces lor readers and collections, and u> rein
force disciplinary communities within the
whole of the (ireen Library building."

Planning, Learning I ethnologies and Extend
ed Education, and Craig Heller, Chair of the
Learning I echnologies Hoard, ended the

New Learning Technologies.
As use of the Internet as an educational tool
grows, Stanford is working to keep up with the
rapid < hanges in eduiation technology.

learning technologies at Stanford should be ex
perimental instead of pine profit-seeking.
"Emphasis is on experimentation, he s.iid.
"The most important aspect, Irom m\ point ol
view, is what we'll be learning.
