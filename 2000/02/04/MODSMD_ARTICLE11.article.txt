## British threaten to reclaim control Northern Ireland's administration could be dissolved soon 
### 
BELFAST, Northern Ireland
(AP) — Embarking on a risky
strategy to save the peace pro
cess, Britain warned yesterday
that it will strip power from
Northern Ireland's new Protes
tant-Catholic administration
unless the IRA quickly pledges
to disarm.
Northern Ireland Secretary
Peter Mandelson announced he
would introduce a bill today that
within days would allow London
to reclaim the substantial
authority it handed nine weeks
ago to the province's four-party
Cabinet. But the process could
be stopped if the situation
changes, he emphasized.
The crisis threatens the new
administration that has given
Northern Ireland a measure of
local rule after years of direct
rule by Britain.
Rendering the coalition pow
erless would increase the
chances it could survive. Protes
tants have otherwise threatened
to resign their posts over the
Irish Republican Army's refusal
to disarm.
Mandelson appealed for the
major Protestant party, the
Ulster Unionists, to be patient as
the British and Irish govern
ments spend the next week try
ing to persuade the IRA to
announce publicly that it will
scrap its weapons.
Noting that Northern Ire
land's 1998 peace accord made
disarmament and the Cabinet's
survival "interdependent," he
said: "We cannot partially
implement the Good Friday
agreement. It is all or nothing."
Mandelson emphasized he
would be extremely reluctant to
suspend the administration's

powers, which would also mean
suspending policy-coordinating
committees between Northern
Ireland and the Irish Republic,
another important plank of the
agreement. But lie said that
might be the only way "to pre
serve them from collapse."
As Mandelson spoke, Irish
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
flew to Cornwall, southwest Eng
land, to tell British Prime Minis
ter Tony Blair about his daylong
discussions in Dublin with offi
cials of the IRA and its allied
Sinn Fein party.
In November, as part of an
American-brokered deal, the
Ulster Unionists dropped their
demand for IRA disarmament
before the Cabinet's formation
and accepted Sinn Fein into two
of the 12 posts — but in expec
tation that the IRA would finally
start disarming.
To win over skeptical col
leagues, Ulster Unionist leader
David Trimble even promised
he would resign this month as
the Cabinet's senior minister if
the IRA wasn't delivering on its
end of the bargain. He backed
that promise up by drafting a
resignation letter and schedul
ing an internal party meeting for
Feb. 12.
The IRA did agree to meet
Canadian Gen. John de Chaste
lain, chairman of the province's
disarmament commission. But
the general's report has con
firmed that no disarmament had
taken place.
Mandelson indicated the IRA
hadn't even said when, if ever, it
would start, although the ac cord
expected total disarmament by
May.
This was "simply unaccept
able, and a betrayal of the entire
community in Northern Ire
land," lie said.
The IRA lias defied years of
pressure for a start to disarma
ment.
