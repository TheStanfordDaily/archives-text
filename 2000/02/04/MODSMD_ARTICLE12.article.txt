# Second black box recorder found
## Investigators hope box will assist in uncovering why Flight 261 crashed 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Investi
gators found the second "black
box" recorder from Alaska Airlines
Flight 201 yesterday, quickly locat
ing the devices that could tell them
why the plane Hipped upside
clown and plummeted into the
ocean.
Navy crews off Southern Cali
fornia recovered Flight 261's cock
pit (light data recorder.
It should show the positions of
the plane's controls and whether a
problem with the horizontal stabi
lizer was merely a symptom of a

larger failure that led to Monday's
crash and the deaths of all 88
aboard.
"That will tell the tale," said
William Waldock, associate direc
tor for the Center for Aerospace
Safety Education at Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University.
The MD-83 jetliner's other
"black box" was recovered
Wednesday.
It records cockpit communica
tions and showed the crew had
problems\vith the horizontal stabi
lizer, a device on the tail of the
plane which keeps the aircraft
level.
It captured the voices of the
pilots trying to gain control of the
jetliner as it rolled, flipped and spi
raled nose-first into the water, con

firming what witnesses saw.
"The crew made references to
being inverted," National Trans
portation Safety Board Chairman
James Hall said in Washington,
referring to the contents of the
recorder. ,
The Navy used an underwater
robot to locate the boxes about 200
leet apart and roughly 640 feet
beneath the surface of the Pacific.
The remotely operated sub
mersible Scorpio 1 found the
boxes in the debris zone, about 10
miles off the Ventura County coast
within 20 hours of each other —
the cockpit voice recorder on
Wednesday around 5 p.m. and
the data recorder around noon
yesterday.
From the beginning, the inves

tigation has focused on the hori
zontal stabilizer because the pilots
had reported problems with it.
Jammed or out-of-control hori
zontal stabilizers have led to at
least a half dozen emergency land
ings but never a crash of a com
mercial airplane, federal records
show. '
A review of problems involving
the device over the last 20 years
show jamming is rare *and has
never driven a plane totally out of
control.
An Associated Press examina
tion of aviation records found that
at least 20 in-flight problems with
stabilizers were serious enough to
be reported to the Federal Avia
tion Administration or the NTSB
since 1979.
