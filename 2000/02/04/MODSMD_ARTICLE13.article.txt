# Avalanches bury parts of Alaska
## Worst avalanches in decades leave state residents stranded 
### 
ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) —
The worst avalanches to hit Alaska
in decades have closed the only
highway linking the Kenai Penin
sula with Anchorage and the rest of
the suite, leaving thousands of res
idents and travelers stranded for a
fourth day.
"This is the worst we've had
since the 1970s for sure and prob
ably before that," said Ghris
Kepler, a maintenance chief for
the state. "We have rain and snow.

We have all the ingredients for
perfect avalanches."
Residents of the Kenai Peninsu
la were warned yesterday not to
expect relief anytime soon. Kepler
did not know when the highway
would reopen.
About 2,000 people were with
out power, and Chugach Electric
officials said it could be seven days
or more before electricity is
restored.
The avalanches have cut off all
traffic and left a number of tiny
communities on the Kenai Penin
sula, a rugged, triangle-shaped
land mass that juts into the Gulf of
Alaska, even more isolated than
usual. The 127-mile Seward High

way is the only road between the
peninsula and Anchorage.
Though Kenai Peninsula resi
dents live about 40 miles south of
Anchorage, they still count on
being able to drive there to run
errands such as buying groceries,
and in some cases, go to work dur
ing the winter.
A railroad worker was killed by
an avalanche Tuesday. Kerry
Brookman, 53, was operating a
bulldozer to clear tracks next to the
highway when a slide swept him
and the bulldozer 500 feet.
The extreme avalanche condi
tions have been caused by heavy
snowfall, followed by rising tem
peratures. Anchorage, which nor

mally gets about nine inches of
snow in January, was buried under
34 inches last month, and temper
atures during the past week have
been in the 30s. It rained Wednes
day.
The first slides began Sunday
night and continued yesterday. On
Wednesday, a mile-long avalanche
knocked out seven high-voltage
transmission lines, cutting power
to (iirdwood, Portage, Whittier
and Hope.
Highway crews have been using
howitzers, and explosives dropped
from aircraft to trigger controlled
avalanches along the Seward
Highway, which is buried under
up to 20 feet of snow.
