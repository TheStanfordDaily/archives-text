# Austrian president will swear in far-right party leader
## European Union and other countries threaten to politically isolate Austria 
### 
VIENNA, Austria (Al>) — Austria's
president agreed yesterday to swear in a
coalition government that includes a far
right party whose leader lias applauded
aspects of the Nazi empire.
Reaction was swift.

Israel recalled its ambassador and
banned rightist Joerg Haider from visit
ing their country.
European Union nations started mak
ing good on threats to politically isolate
Austria, something the United States has
backed.
The EU also warned it may suspend
the Alpine nation's membership.
In Vienna, protesters took to the
streets for a second straight night yester
day.
Hie crowd, however, numbered about

2,000 — far fewer than the 15,000 who
rallied Wednesday.
President Thomas klestil said the
results of the Oct. 3 parliamentary elec
tions give him little choice but to go ahead
with the swearing- in ceremony today.
Klestil did reject two Cabinet nominees
from Haider's Freedom. Party.
The president also demanded that
Haider and his coalition partner, Wolf
gang Schuessel of the centrist Austrian
People's Party, sign a statement renounc
ing the nation's Nazi past and promising

to respect European values.
Haider won international notoriety —
and later apologized — for statements
praising Adolf Hitler's "orderly employ
ment" policies and lauding veterans of
the WafFen SS as "decent people of good
character."
He has also opposed EU expansion
and urged a near halt to immigration.
Schuessel will become chancellor, and
Freedom Party official Susanne Riess-
Passer will be vice chancellor.
Although Haider will remain governor

of Carinthia state and hold no Cabinet
post, li£ has a strong grip on the Freedom
Party.
Critics doubt Schnessel, whose hold on
his own party is less firm, can control the
mercurial Haider.
The declaration that the two leaders
signed did not specifically refer to
Haider's previous comments.
However, Haider and Schnessel
pledged to work lor a democratic Austria
where "xenophobia, anti-Semitism and
racism have no place."
