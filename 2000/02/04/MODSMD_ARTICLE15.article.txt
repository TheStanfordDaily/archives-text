tualßatings, a Web site that allows
college students across the nation to
review their professors on-line, prides itself
on two basic policies. The lirst is its lack of
anonymity — all comments must have e
in.ul addresses attached to them — and the
second is the value ol its service, which is to
provide a Ibrum for students to evaluate
and compare their professors.
Despite these high aims, however, it
seems far more satisfying for students to
use a site like Virtualßatings to rant about
proiessors they've disliked or wax emotion
al about ones that they've adored than to
oiler thoughtful, constructive criticism that
will be helpful to others.

And what's to keep professors from
reacting unethically to these comments by
favoring or targeting students based on
their comments?
Such bashing of professors has long
been a favorite pastime of students, and
Virtualßatings will be no different. Most
students, however, are fully aware of this
tendency in their peers (as well as them
selves), which may finally prevent them
from taking Virtualßatings seriously. Stu
dents simply know better than to base
meaningful academic decisions on com
ments posted on the Web by Joe Student.

about the evaluator.
And as for contacting the evaluator to
learn more, it is simply wishful thinking to
assume that students will opt fore-mailing
people they don't know to follow up on
Web postings over the much more reliable
method of asking people they trust or
shopping classes to see for themselves.
Given this predictable reaction from
many college students, it seems fitting to
ask exactly what larger purpose this site
will serve in the long run, if any at all.
Students' Virtualßatings evaluations of
professors, no matter how flattering or dis
paraging, are unlikely to result in much
hiring or firing where it matters. Only the
most naive among us would honestly see a

How many admissions officers will have
to answer for some student's comments on
this professor or that, and how helpful can
that possibly be for prospective students,
who may or may not have reacted the same
way to a given professor?
Admittedly, if one considers that post
ings from a wide range of schools are avail
able at the click of a button, Virtual Ratings
may well have excellent potential as a compar-
ison tool for prospective students and
parents.
However, once one factors in the
likelihood of exaggeration, the lack of
any prior knowledge of the evaluator
and the wide variability of students'
opinions on any given subject, one is
only left with a moderately interesting
site with a real information value akin
to that of Loveline.
Virtual Ratings is novel and it's fun,
but the appeal ends there. Students,

like all other human beings, rarely
pass up a chance to he disgruntled,
out, if Virtual Ratings is that chance, it
cannot also be a valuable tool for eval
uation, comparison and change.
If students want to offer construc
tive criticism, or even if they just want
to criticize, they would do better to
take some time filling out formal class
evaluation and sharing their thoughts
directly with professors.
After all, professorss are much bet
ter able to act on students' suggestions
