# Rethinking transfer admissions policy
## 
### DANA MULHAUSER EDITORIAL STAFF 
When 1 was growing up, I idolized
Sally Ride. The pictures of her waving
from her spate capsule were on my TV
screen, my newspaper and the wall in my
room. \ ler shaggy brown hair floated in a
weightless halo that left me begging my
parents to send me to astronaut camp.
She was the first American woman in
spate, she was an astrophysicist and she
was a Stanford student.
Hut in 19()8, Sally Ride was none of
those tilings. She was a tennis prodigy
.iikl phvsics student at Swartlunore (iol
lege in Pennsylvania. And a not-so-prodi
gious prodigy at that.
Slir left s< liool after three semesters,
look some time oil lo think tilings over,
iid re-applied lo < ollege. She enrolled as
.1 11a11sI(-1 student .it Stanford and double
majored in English and Physics.
Sail) Ride had the opportunity to do
th.tt. Who knows w hat will happen to the
next Sallv Ride, because as of this past
fall, Stanford's transfer ( lass has shrunk
l>\ three-fourths.
In order to compensate for an over
enrolled freshman class, outgoing Dean
ol Admissions and Financial Aid Robert
kinnalh slashed the transfer class from
l(r> last seat lo 111 this year.
Now it's February and time again to
make freshman admissions decisions.
I housands of carefully tvped, cut, pasted
.iikl stapled applications have arrived at
Old I nion. I housands of 17-year olds
have ihcil hopes hinging on a Stanford
p< >stmark.
M\ re<|iiesi to Dean Kinnaily: reject
them. Or. at least, reject enough of the

high-schoolers so that the transfer class
can regain its old size.
That cutback of transfers is a shame,
and I say that not only because of Sally
Ride.
In the past ten years, Stanford has also
let in a bricklayer, a Gulf War veteran, a
former Buddhist monk, and an Olympic
figure skater, all as transfer students. If
given the choice, I'd take these people in
my classes over fuzz-faced freshmen any
day.
To a man (and woman), the transfer
students I have met are ahead of the
curve on motivation, direction and out
side-! he-bubble experience. They come
to Stanford knowing what they want and
having re-adjusted their life plans to get
there, skills I can't say I had coining in as
a freshman.
I ransfer students are no less academi
cally qualified than their freshman
enrolled peers. Ninety-five percent of
them had grade point averages at or
above 3.5 at their previous colleges. The
Office of Admissions agrees, saying on
their Web site that, "[t]ransfer students
add significantly to the maturity, diversi
ty .ind academic excellence of the student
body, hence the University is committed
to making them an integral part of the
undergraduate program."
I lie Admissions office needs to take its
own advice.
I'm not arguing here that Stanford cut
transfers any extra breaks. Even going
back to last years rates, it was harder to
get into Stanford as a transfer (10 per
cent) then it was as a freshman (13 per
cent).

All I'm asking is that we don't make it
nearly impossible.
Dean kinnally, when admissions deci
sions come down to the wire, cut back on
the freshman class a little if you have to.
Swell the class sizes a bit if necessary. But
bring the transfer student numbers back
up. Maybe even let in a few extra to
make up for last year.
After all, if Stanford had its current
transfer admission rate 30 years ago,
Sally Ride might now be the most idol
ized tennis coach at Swarthmore College.
