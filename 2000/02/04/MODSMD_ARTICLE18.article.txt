Daily needs substance to go with style
I must admit that 1 was intrigued by
the le;ul-ii|> to the new Ibrmat of The
Daily, and ai first glance the other day I
was thoroughly impressed. I lie addition
of the title "Peninsula's Oldest Morning
Newspaper adds instant credibility
without any extra ellort in journalism.
However, a series of new fonts, design
< hanges and graphics, no matter how
c\c-cat< hing, cannot make up for the fact
that in a I I page newspaper, there were
less ili.in six pages of articles.
I am pleased that I he Daily has decid
ed to look within and improve on its great
past, however, the Stanford community

will not be seduced by mere graphics
without sustenance. 1 look forward to the
continuous improvements to one of the
greatest student papers.

Recognizing BIaQS film festival
I was extremely pleased and exited to
see a front page article about Black Lib
eration Month in Tuesday's Daily. I was
also frustrated and disappointed that
the BIaQS (Black and Queer at Stan
ford) and LGBCC (Lesbian Gay Bisexu

al Community Center) cosponsered film
festival — which began Wednesday
night at 7:30 p.m. in the Ujamaa T.V.
lounge — was not even mentioned in
the article.
I am not placing anyone specifically at
fault, but this was most definitely a slap in
the face for the black queer community
here at Stanford.
It is extremely important for there to
be a visible link between the black and
queer communities, especially during this
very important and exciting month for all
of us. I am aware of space constraints in
the paper and the need for effective edit
ing, hut I very sincerely hope that this
important event series was not edited out

of the original article.
This was an egregious oversight on all
of our parts, and I hope we will do our
very best to make sure that this film festi
val is included (and BIaQS and the
LGBCC acknowledged) on all future
BLM announcements and advertise
ments.
And 1 look forward to seeing a front
page article on this on-going event that
marks BlaQS' first involvement in the
BLM celebration and a real long overdue
all encompassing wholeness of the Black
community here on campus.
