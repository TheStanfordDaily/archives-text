# Ambiguity is Israel's only nuclear option
## 
### BEN JONES OPINIONS EDITOR 
Are there times when keeping a secret
makes the secret plainly obvious? Such an
odd circumstance may be evident in the
case of Israel and its continued ambiguity

DAILY OP-ED

about the extent of its nuclear arsenal.
Israel, committed to not reveal
whether it does, in fact, possess nuclear
weapons, held the first public debate on
the weapons of mass destruction on
Wednesday. Initiated by Arab legislators
in the Parliament, the debate lasted only

52 minutes and revealed very little about
the Israeli nuclear stockpile itself.
Although Israel has never admitted to
possessing nuclear weapons, most coun
tries recognize the state as a nuclear
power. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists
regards Israel as the world's sixth largest
nuclear power behind the U.S., Russia,
China, France and Britain.
There have been repeated calls for
Israel to either declare its nuclear capa
bilities or renounce its nuclear program
altogether and destroy existing stockpiles.
The maintenance of nuclear ambiguity,
however, may be Israel's most viable
option in light of its precarious security
situation.

An open declaration of nuclear capabil
ity would certainly promote an immediate
backlash among Arab nations in the
region to develop, either indigenously or
with assistance from current nuclear pow
ers, nuclear weapons to act as a deterrent
to Israeli nuclear forces.
Although Israel has adopted a no-first
use policy in the Middle East region, a
declaration of Israeli nuclear capability
would likely tip the security balance in
such a dramatic fashion that other nations
of the region would feel compelled to
arm. At the same time, such a declaration
could have disastrous consequences for
the fragile peace process in the region
which, at present, is making cautious steps

forward, but remains mired in a number
of fundamental disagreements between
Israel and the PLO.
At the same time, Israel wili not, and
can not, renounce its nuclear capabilities.
For years, Jerusalem has hedged its will
ingness to enter a nuclear weapons free
zone in the Middle East on the establish
ment of a secure and lasting peace accord,
a prospect seemingly destined for the dis
tant rather than immediate future.
As evidenced by the 1981 Israeli
airstrikes which destroyed the Iraqi nucle
ar reactor at Osiraq, Israel is committed to
keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands
of Arab states in the region, but with
recent evidence of Russian transfers of

nuclear technology to Iran and the
entrance of Pakistan into the pantheon of
declared nuclear powers, Israeli fears of
proliferation in the Middle East are at a
high point.
It thus must retain the threat of nuclear
capability as a deterrent against both
nuclear and conventional attacks, while, at
the same time, retaining ambiguity in
order to prevent reactionary proliferation.
Apart from security concerns, Israel
faces a number of normative criticisms for
its stance, namely accusations of hypocrisy
in its advocacy of non-proliferation for
other states of the Middle East in the face
of continued unwillingness to commit to
non-proliferation itself.
