# New home for Jasper Ridge
## $5M facility will enable researchers to expand programs, replace buildings 
### DAVE ABRIL 
Administrators at Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve have an
nounced plans to build a $5 million
research facility to accommodate
research and instruction on the
1,189 acre preserve.
According to Administration Di

rector Philipe Cohen, the center
will replace current facilities which
are in "very old, very decrepit, poor
condition."
"It will be easier to accommodate
classes, although the main function
is to support existing programs,"
said Cohen, referring to the 45 re
search projects which are currently
being conducted at the preserve.
Since the 19205, researchers at
Jasper Ridge have worked out of
Searsville Laboratory, a converted
hamburger stand named after a
nearby lake. The docent center
consists of a trailer and deck. The

main storage facility used to be a
bathhouse. During this time,
Cohen's office and jasper Ridge's
administrative center were located
on campus, 15 minutes away from
the preserve.
In addition to providing more
space lor instruction and research,
the center will bring the adminis
tration to the reserve and facilitate
maintenance of ongoing programs.
Cohen, who is overseeing the
project, is taking special measures
to make sure that construction of

Jasper Ridge currently hosts
about 45 to 50 projects a year,
most of which are under the di
rection of Stanford researchers
and students.
According to Junior Scott
l.oarie, who became a docent
last winter, the preserve attracts
researchers and students be
cause its use has been limited to
st ientific purposes.
"Researc li lias the top priority
there. You can conduct good re
search because it's one of the
only places in the area where
there's been little human impact
in the last MO years." he said.
According to Cohen, con
struction of the building will
begin next summer and could be
completed as earlv as March
2001.
Ihe funds for the new facility
come primarily from $2.75 mil
lion in private donations, in
( hiding a $ 1.25 million gift from
Stanford alumna Leslie S. Sun
and her husband, Anthony Sun.
It will be named in memory of
Leslie Sun.
