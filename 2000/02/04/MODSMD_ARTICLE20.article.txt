### MARGAUX HALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students from the Redw<x>d Action
Team staged a protest outside Fidelity In
vestments yesterday to voice their con
cerns over the company's support for oil
drilling companies on Colombian tribal
lands.
I'he protest, which took place at the
Palo Alto branch of the mutual fund com
pany, involved approximately two dozen
Stanford students and other community
members.
Fhe Redwood Action Team, a student
run group on campus, has become in
volved in a nationwide effort to protect the
U'wa ti il)e's ancestral land from destruc
tion by oil drilling projects. The Redwood
Action Team has been involved in this
issue for nearly one and one half months.
Protestors hope Fidelity Investments
will pressure Occidental Petroleum, a
U.S.-based company, to stop its drilling
on the native lands.
According to a pamphlet printed by

the Rainforest Action Network, as a na
tional non-profit organization, "Fidelity is
often the single largest shareholder of Oc
cidental stock - and is always among Occi
dental's top three shareholders."
As sophomore Dan Series, an organiz
er of the protest, explained, the Redwood
Action Team staged the event in order to
educate the public about the issue.
"Fidelity's slogan is 'We help you in
vest responsibly,' and we want to hold
them to that slogan," Series said.
Serres added that if the Fidelity com
pany does not respond to the protests by
March 1 and discourage further drilling,
the national campaigners plan to intensi
fy their protests.
In addition, the RAN pamphlet states
that the 5,000 tribe members have threat
ened to commit mass suicide if the
drilling does not cease. Global response to
such a suicide would be akin to the shock
after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989,
the RAN pamphlet argues.
Many of the protesters said they felt Fi
delity Investments could distinguish itself

as a model company by addressing the
U'wa's concerns.
"[By acting on this issue], Fidelity
would be making a strong statement to
the rest of the corporate world," Series
said.
The Fidelity Investments company
has not as of yet responded to the glow
ing number of national protests, accord
ing to the RAN. A similar protest against
Fidelity Investments t(x>k place Wednes
day in San P rancisco.
Freshman Angad Bhalla, who attend
ed the protest, said he feels that students
have a responsibility to promote aware
ness of such issues on campus and in the
surrounding community.
"We as students have a responsibility
to take action and use our position to ef
fect positive change," Bhalla said.
Sophomore Galen Weston, a member
of the Redwood Action Team, said the
year-old student-group has branched out
to address other world issues, such as
public discontent with the World Trade
Organization.
