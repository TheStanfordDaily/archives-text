## Men dismantle hapless Bruins to move into first-place tie with AZ 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
The mystique is gone for UCLA, at
least in the eyes of No. 2 Stanford.
The Cardinal started out strong and
withstood a furious second-half charge
from the 11-time National Champions to
win 78-63 last night in Pauley Pavilion.
Stanford (18-1, 7-1 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) had as much as a 22-point lead early
in the second half before UCLA (12-7, 3-
5) picked up the pace and closed it to
eight points. But the Cardinal weathered
the storm, using a clutch three-pointer
from junior Ryan Mendez and aggressive
play from freshman Casey Jacobsen to
reestablish control.
The win was the Cardinal's third
straight at Pauley Pavilion and fifth
straight over UCLA.
"I don't think we're intimidated by
anybody," Mendez said. "We go out to
prove a point every night."
Early in the game, Stanford's fearless
approach was obvious. The Cardinal
never hesitated to take a shot outside or
pound it into the interior against UClA's
tandem of Jerome Moiso and Dan
Gadzuric.
And in the first half, against UClA's
match-up zone, that strategy paid
tremendous dividends. Stanford shot 60
percent from three-point territory and 58
percent from the field to take a 38-22
halftime lead.
Even junior forward Jarron Collins
got into the act, sinking an open three to
give the Cardinal an 18-point lead late in
the first half. The three-pointer was only
Collins second in his collegiate career.
"We anticipated their match-up zone,"
said Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "We did a good job of under
standing it and playing against it, taking
advantage of what they gave us."

Freshman Casey Jacobsen, a native of
Southern California, said he was especial
ly excited to see the zone from the Bruins.
"When 1 see a zone, I'm not going to
say 'bombs-away,' " he said. "But there
are so many gaps in a zone to take advan
tage of."
Jacobsen, who matched up with
UCIA freshman phenom Jason Kapono,
scored 17 points in the game. Kapono
and Jacobsen had played with and
against each other numerous times dur
ing high school, hut Jacobsen said this was
the first time he had ever beaten Kapono,
a streak he was happy to break.
Jacobsen established himself early by
hitting a few open three-pointers, draw
ing the Bruins defense out. Then in the
second half, he made them pay, repeat
edly scoring on hard drives to the basket,
flis ball-handling was also key in helping
Stanford withstand the Bruins' surge.
As UCLA stepped up the pressure and
point guard Mike McDonald tired a bit,
Jacobsen's presence helped steady the
Cardinal.
"We don't have one single guy who
scores all the points for tis or is the only
guy who can do something for us," he
said. "Mike was getting a little tired and
he brings the ball up the floor for us all
the time. 1 wanted to help, and the more
1 started to do it, the more comfortable 1
was."
While the pressure didn't seem to
bother Jacobsen, it did give Stanford
problems in the second half. After a
Kapono jumper brought the Bruins
within 13, Lavin called a quick timeout to
switch the defense into a full-court press.
Until Mendez's three pushed the lead
back to 1 1 points with 13:25 left, it ap
peared the press would bring UCLA back
into contention.
Montgomery said he felt he should
have prepared more for the Bruins' pres

sure in practice (his week but that Stan
lord knew I ( LA was going to have to be
more aggressive in the second hall.
"The press wasn't something we
looked at that much," he said. "We really
spent more time preparing for the
matchup zone and obviously, the pres
sure hurt us some."
But while UCLA turned up the heat,
Stanford was able to increase its intensity
as well. McDonald and Earl Watson trad
ed barbs most of the night, especially dur
ing the Bruins' run. The pushing and

grabbing became too much for the
officals to overlook, and McDon
ald was called for a very question
able intentional foul trying to in
bounds the ball against Earl Wat

son.
"[Watson] was just yapping and
yapping," McDonald said patron
izingly. "They came back a little
and he started talking mess. But
after we got in control again, he
got quiet. He must have been tired
or something."
Senior David Moseley, one of
two Stanford captains and the

team's fiery leader, fouled out of
the game with 4:30 left after he was
called for a quick foul and then a
subsuquent technical lor talking
back at the referees.
While those plays helped the
Bruins stay close for a time, that
type of attitude is what gives Stan
lord its edge, said Jacobsen.
"I don't think we're scared of

anything," he said. "The only time
we get down is when we hurt our
selves.
"That 'no fear' kind of attitude
just starts with our captains. Mose
is out here ten minutes before the
game yelling, "This is our house,
not theirs. We're going to take it at
them.' We just think positively and
it flows."

"[Watson] was just yapping and

and he started talking mess. But
after we got in control again, he
got quiet. He must have been tired
