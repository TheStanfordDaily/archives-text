## 
### KELLIE WIGINTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The equivalent of ' I lie Axe' is
at stake this Saturday for the No. 5
Stanford men's swim team. I he
Cardinal (4-3) travels to Los Ange
les to take on the No. 6 Trojans of
use: (4-1) in an important Pacific
10 Conference competition.
Along with the annual dual
meet between Stanford and I SC
comes the tradition oftlie Bell Tro
phy. Much like "The Axe" of the
Big Game, the Bell I rophy is
passed between the Cardinal and
the Trojans men's swim teams ac -
cording to which team wins. The
Cardinal has held the trophy for
the past three years and is looking
to keep it lor at least one more.
"Without a doubt, we get hyped

for USC," saicl junior Ail-American
Adam Messner. " There's definitely
a rivalry."
"We just want to go in there
strong and with a good attitude,"
saicl freshman Randall Bal. "We
definitely want to take this one."
In its last competition, the Car
dinal c rushed the unranked Pacific
Tigers I 18-82, winning nine of the
eleven events. After a week and a
half of rest and no competition, the
Cardinal is ready to showcase their
talent to the Trojans.
"We're going to go down there
with a lot of fire," Messner said.
"We're out for blood."

Stanford's swimmers go into the (JSC meet with an early lead gained by the
divers. The Cardinal will try to keep the grips on the Bell Trophy this weekend.
Invitational, the Cardinal goes into
Saturday's meet with a lead in
points. Olmstead won both the 1-
meter and the 3-meter dives.
The Trojans have an impressive
cast of talent, with seven returning
All-Americans leading the way.
Particularly strong so far this sea
son have been Ail-American senior
Brett Awbrey, Ail-American ju
niors Leonardo Costa and Philippe
Demers, sophomores Nick Kaschik
and Mark Warkentin, and fresh
man Erik Vendt.
Probably the biggest concern to
the Cardinal will be Ail-American
Warkentin, one of the top mid- to
long-distance swimmers in the
country. He took home four gold
medals last year at the 1999 World
University Games.
Vendt, who holds the fastest
1000-yard freestyle time in the
country so far this year, will also be
a force to be reckoned with.

Two weeks ago, the Trojans
convincingly defeated both Irvine
(212-49) and Pacific (190-72). Sev
eral USC swimmers won two
events each, including Awbrey in
the 100-meter and 200-meter
freestyle, and Costa in the 100-
meter and 200-meter backstroke.
Kaschik dominated the butter
fly events, winning both the 100-
meter and 200-meter races. Vendt
placed first in both the 200-meter
breaststroke and the 200-meter in
dividual medley.
Since the Cardinal also has sev
eral of the best competitors in the
these events, some of the races will
likely come down to the last stroke.
The Cardinal will be looking to its
big guns to compete against USC's
top swimmers.
Especially crucial in Saturday's
meet should be senior All-Ameri
can and co-captain Glenn Counts,
freshmen sensations Bal and Dan
VVescott, and Messner. Counts will
be a strong competitor in both the
butterfly and 112 reestyle events, while
Bal specializes in the sprint
freestyle and the backstroke.
