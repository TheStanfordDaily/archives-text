# Pitchers to duel as No. 1 baseball hosts series with No. 2 Fullerton
## This weekend kicks off at home duel between the Card and Cal-State Fullerton 
### BRETT KAUFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The college baseball season is but a week old,
yet the top I wo teams in the nation square of!
this weekend as the No. 1 Cardinal hosts No. 2
Cal-State Fullerton in a three-game set at
Sunken Diamond.
Stanford (2-0) comes into the series after
sweeping Fresno State on the road in a rain
shortened affair last weekend. The Titans (0-0)
travel to Sunken to face one of the top pitching
staffs in baseball without having played a single
game.
Friday night's matchup will feature two first
team All-America selections on the mound,
Stanford junior Jason Young (1-0 W-L, 2.25
FRA) and Fullerton'sace, Adam Johnson (10-4,
3.55 in 1999).
Young's performance against an average
Fresno State lineup was less than stellar, going
only four innings while walking four and throw
ing deep into the count on many occasions.
However, he pitched well in tight spots and
allowed only one run.
"His arm feels good, and he'll get better each
timeout," said Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess.
"I'm not overly concerned as long as he's

healthy."
Johnson throws particularly well against
right-handed hitters, allowing them to amass a
paltry .198 batting average last season.
However, the Cardinal lineup features two
switch-hitters and three left-handed batters,
negating Johnson's advantage with a balanced
attack.
Saturday's matinee will see Cardinal junior
Justin Wayne (1-0, 1.69) take the hill after a
commanding outing in which he collected live
strikeouts while allowing only three hits against
the Bulldogs.

■ This weekend: No. 1 Stanford hosts No. 2 Cal-
State Fullerton

Wayne will most likely face Jon Smith (7-1,
3.16 in 1999), a left-handed hurler that has a
history of starting the season effectively.
Last year, Smith began the year 5-0 with a
1.80 FRA before having to undergo shoulder
surgery.
Sophomore Brian Sager (0-0, 0.00) will
make his first start of the season Sunday in the
series finale after his first scheduled appear
ance was canceled due to rain.
Marquess regrets not being able to give
Sager the ball last weekend but noted that he
did pitch well in a Monday intrasquad game at
Sunken Diamond.
"Ideally we would have liked him to pitch . .

. but there's not much we can do about it,"he
said.
The probable Sunday starter lor the Titans
will be junior college transfer Ronnie Corona
(12-3,2.69 in 1999).
He pitched well last season for Cypress Ju
nior College, striking out 137 batters while
walking only 30 in 104 innings.
Fullerton head coach George Morton's
squad does not have a power-laden lineup,
forcing him to play fundamental baseball.
Mis contact hitters and excellent team speed
will lead to many hit-and-run and stolen-base
opportunities.
"Timely hitting will decide this series," said
Horton, whose Titans hit .338 as a team in
1999.
Marquess acknowledges that his Cardinal
will have to play solid defense in order to win
this weekend.
Me praised senior catcher Damien Alvarado,
whose ability to react to Morton's tactics will un
doubtedly play a pivotal role in the series.
"lAlvaradoj has a quick release and not
many people are successful running against
him," said Marquess.
The Cardinal skipper was also impressed
with freshman 'Tim Cunningham (0-0, 0.00),
who retired nine of the ten hitters he faced on
Saturday.
Cunningham and the rest of Stanford's
bullpen will bear the brunt of late-inning pres
sure from a talented Fullerton team this week
end.
