# Gymnasts hope upset is Bruin
## 
### KATIE FITZPATRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 9 Stanford women's
gymnastics squad will try to out
duel No. 5 UCI.A in a contest on
Sunday in Southern California.
The Bruins are the defending
Pacific 10 Champions and will be
the biggest challenge the Cardinal
has faced so far this year.
Coming off a convincing victory
against Washington, the Cardi
nal's challenge is to transfer their
recent spectacular home success
to the road. Away meets are often
more difficult for gymnasts be
cause they must adjust to different
equipment in a hostile environ
ment, where the judges tend to be
less willing to give the gymnast the
benefit of the doubt.
"You have to focus more on
yourself rather than using the en
ergy from the crowd, but it's real
ly important to keep everything
else the same," sophomore katy
Herbert said.
The Cardinal is not short on
talent. Larissa Fontaine, Pat 10
gymnast of the week, is currently
one of the best gymnasts in the na
tion and will be a key contributor
against the Bruins. Fontaine is
currently ranked third in the na
tion in the all-around, fourth in
bars and tenth on vault.
Junior Jennifer Exaltacion is
also having a banner year and will
be key if Stanford hopes to pull off
an upset. Exaltacion, the school
record holder on beam, will cer
tainly challenge for the balance

beam title and be a strong com
petitor on every event.
Herbert is another key all
arounder. Her steady success on
each apparatus will be vital to es
tablishing the consistency and
depth that will be necessary to a
Cardinal victory.
Freshman Abby Cair will be a
top competitor on bars for the
Cardinal and will also be an im

portant all-around performer.
Sophomore AH-American
Kristin Jensen and freshman Alis
sa Cooper should shine for the
Cardinal on bars. Cooper is hav
ing a marvelous rookie year for
the Cardinal and has established
herself firmly in the uneven bar
lineup.

Jensen will unveil a difficult
routine against UCLA.
"I'm really excited to make my
routine more competitive on the
national level," Jensen said.
Jensen will be a member of the
very strong floor lineup, joining
senior Ail-American Sarah Hard
ing. Harding has one of the most
impressive floor routines in the
country. Anytime she hits her
routine, she could score a perfect
10.
The vault lineup will feature
the performance of powerful
Cooper and fellow freshman
Kelsey Stillinger. Cooper's pike
hand front is one of the best in the
country and Stillinger's

Yurochenko vault looks strong.
Stillinger is also one of the best
beam performers for the Cardi
nal along with sophomore Becky
Meldrum. Meldrum has been the
rock of the beam lineup this year.
Her leadoff performance is cru
cial for the entire beam rotation.
UCLA is led by All-Americans
Heidi Moneymaker, Lena Degte
va, and Mohini Bhardwaj.
"We know UCLA is good so we
are just going to stick to what our
plan is, hit our routines," said as
sistant coach Rene Lyst Cook.
The Cardinal does not plan on
being intimidated by the talented
and experienced Bruins. Stan
ford will also have enough diffi
culty for their routines to be
worth a 10.0.
"A 10.0 routine is a 10.0 rou
tine, no matter how much diffi
culty you have," Herbert said.
