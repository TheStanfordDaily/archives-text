### KATIE FITZPATRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 9 Stanford women's
gymnastics squad will try to out
duel No. 5 UCI.A in a contest on
Sunday in Southern California.
The Bruins are the defending
Pacific 10 Champions and will be
the biggest challenge the Cardinal
has faced so far this year.
Coming off a convincing victory
against Washington, the Cardi
nal's challenge is to transfer their
recent spectacular home success
to the road. Away meets are often
more difficult for gymnasts be
cause they must adjust to different
equipment in a hostile environ
ment, where the judges tend to be
less willing to give the gymnast the
benefit of the doubt.
"You have to focus more on
yourself rather than using the en
ergy from the crowd, but it's real
ly important to keep everything
else the same," sophomore katy
Herbert said.
The Cardinal is not short on
talent. Larissa Fontaine, Pat 10
gymnast of the week, is currently
one of the best gymnasts in the na
tion and will be a key contributor
against the Bruins. Fontaine is
currently ranked third in the na
tion in the all-around, fourth in
bars and tenth on vault.
Junior Jennifer Exaltacion is
also having a banner year and will
be key if Stanford hopes to pull off
an upset. Exaltacion, the school
record holder on beam, will cer
tainly challenge for the balance

beam title and be a strong com
petitor on every event.
Herbert is another key all
arounder. Her steady success on
each apparatus will be vital to es
tablishing the consistency and
depth that will be necessary to a
Cardinal victory.
Freshman Abby Cair will be a
top competitor on bars for the
Cardinal and will also be an im

portant all-around performer.
Sophomore AH-American
Kristin Jensen and freshman Alis
sa Cooper should shine for the
Cardinal on bars. Cooper is hav
ing a marvelous rookie year for
the Cardinal and has established
herself firmly in the uneven bar
lineup.
