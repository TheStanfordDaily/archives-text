# Cardinal looks for turn-around at Ball State after SoCal losses
## 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
I he No. 13 Stanford men's vol
leyball team (2-4, 2-4 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) did not
have much luck when it traveled
south last weekend, falling to No.
2 Long Beach State and No. 5
USC. This weekend, the team is
taking its game east.
In the Ball State Tournament
in Muntie, Indiana the Cardinal
will face No. 12 Lewis (2-3, 1-1
Midwest Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association) and Ball State (4-
2, 2-2 MIVA ). The trip east gives
the Cardinal its first opportunity
to meet teams outside of the tradi
tionally dominant MPSF confer
ence, and two wins would bring
the squad back up to the .500
mark overall.
"It's about how we play and
how well we live up to our expec
tations," head coach Ruben
Nieves said of his goal this week
end. "We fell short last weekend,
and that bothers the heck out of
me. I hope it bothers the heck out
of the team."
Stanford will start off the week
end against the Lewis Flyers
tonight. Since the two teams have
never met and play in different
conferences, it is difficult to know
what to expect. But with players
from the MIVA championship
team that lost in five games to
UCLA in the 1998 Final Four,
Nieves is expecting a "quality op
ponent."
A team dominated by players
from Puerto Rico, the Flyers re
turn four starters from last year's
23-8 team. Back from an injury
that kept him out last season is se
nior middle hitter Bryan John
wick. With him, Johnwick brings
his 171 block assists and 207 total
blocks, good enough for seventh
in team history. In 1998, John
wick was 15th in the country with
an average of 1.50 blocks-per
game.
Along with Johnwick returns
senior outside hitter Eduardo
Quinones, a three-year starter for
the Flyers. In 1998 Quinones was
picked for the All-MIVA second
team. I bis season, he was named
to the 2000 preseason All-MIVA

second team and leads the squad
with an average of 5.71 kills-per
game and 2.59 digs-per-game.
Setting for Lewis, returns se
nior setter Edgardo Deniz, an All-
Mi VA second team pick for the
past two seasons. Deniz finished
the 1999 season with the nation's

sixth-highest assists-per-game av
erage (17.66) and is second in
team history with 3,828 assists. He
was selected to the 2000 presea
son All-MIVA first team.
Despite a tight 3-2 victory over
No. 7 Brigham Young University
in a preseason exhibition match,

the Flyers dropped two 3-0
matches to the Cougars earlier
this season. Stanford had a similar
result two weeks ago, falling 3-0 to
BYU at Maples
On Saturday a rare matchup
between the Stanford Cardinal
and the Ball State Cardinals will
round out the weekend.
Stanford leads Ball State 4-0 in
the short series history, but this is
their first meeting in Muncie.
Most recently, Stanford defeated
Ball State in three games during
the NCAA semi-finals en route to
the championship of 1997.
Like Stanford, Ball State is a
young team, returning only two
starters from last year's squad.
One returnee that Stanford will
have to beware of is fifth-year se
nior middle blocker Mark Lau, a
2000 Preseason All-MIVA Second
Team pick. Last season, Lau's av
erage of 1.76 blocks/game placed
him first in the MIVA, sixth na
tionally and second in the school
record books. Lau has 30 blocks
already this season. Also an offen
sive powerhouse, Lau led the
team with a .337 hitting percent
age last season.
Another fifth year senior, out
side hitter Brian Hughes, brings
experience to the Cardinals.
Hughes led the Cardinals and
ranked 14th in the nation with an
average of 2.23 digs per game
last year and was second on the
team with 342 kills. This season
he leads the team in kills with
120, and last week, Hughes was
selected as the American Volley
ball Coaches Association/Sports
Imports Division 1 National Play
er of the Week
Nieves is confident that his
team has the ability to come away
with the wins this weekend, but
the squad will have to improve
from last weekend's perfor
mance.
"We've had trouble scoring
points," Nieves said. "We need to
serve tougher without generating
a lot more errors. We also need to
block and dig better. 'We'iveihadi
success witln our side-out game,
but it's not consistent enough. To
beat teams this weekend we can't
give up points in bunches."
