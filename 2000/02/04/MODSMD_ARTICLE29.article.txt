## 
### CHRISTOPHER LYLE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Most students traveling to alti
tudes of 7,000 feet this weekend
are praying for fresh powder. The
Stanford track team (ranked No. 2
by Trackwire.com), however, is
hoping lor another successful per
formance in their second meet of
the year at the Air Force Quadran
gular in Colorado.
The emphasis at Air Force will
he on the sprinters, hurdlers and
throwers after last week's meets,
which centered around the dis
tance squad at Boston's Terrier
Classic and the jumpers at Reno's
Silver State Invitational.
In accordance with this meet's
fix us, head coach Vin I ananna said
a,"skeletal distance squad" would
represent the Cardinal in Colorado.
\yhile Stanford will not send all of its
consistently high-scoring distance
squad, the Cardinal will Ik- well rep
resented in field events and dis
tances up to 800 meters.
"We aren't taking the whole dis
tance team due to the altitude. The
altitude is a disadvantage and will
hamper performances in any
events over 800 meters."
Even though times will be
slowed by the altitude, the Cardi
nal still hopes for strong individual
performances that meet NCAA
qualify ing standards.
"We have a good shot at qualify
ing with our pole vaulters, 800
meter runners, and throwers," said

lananna.
Competition will definitely not
he lac king as Stanford competes
against Air Force, No. 20 Colorado
State, and No. 17 Oklahoma.
"Bryan Berryhill from Col
orado State, the NCAA runner up
in the 1500 [meter run], will be
running," said Lananna. "The
whole Oklahoma team is very, very
strong on men's and women's
sides. They will he formidable."
The Air Force meet fits nicely
into overall season goals, which, at
this point, include qualifying run
ners by Pacific 10 and NCAA stan
dards. Lananna will place athletes
this weekend in events that will
give them the best opportunity to
maximize individual results rather
than team standing.
Indoor meets such as the one on
Saturday will serve as a stepping
stone for the outdoor season. The
meets leading up to the outdoor
Pac 10 and NCAA meets will pri
marily be viewed as qualifying
meets where runners are trying to
reach NCAA standards.
Several Stanford runners have
already qualified for the indoor
championships. Both men's and
women's distance medley relay
teams turned in automatic qualify
ing times last week in Boston.
Freshmen Lauren Flesh man and
Erin Sullivan both qualified auto
matically in the 3,000 meters.
Junior Michael Stember's mile
run also made the automatic quali
fying cutoff.
