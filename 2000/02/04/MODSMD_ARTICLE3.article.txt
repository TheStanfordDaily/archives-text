# SME Core faces changes, challenges

### AMY CHRISTESON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Area Two requirements." For
a student planning on pursuing
the fuzzier side of a Stanford edu
cation, these words often incite
fear and stress. The Science Math
and Engineering Core, or SME,
was created four years ago to en
able students to fulfill their Area
Two requirements.
While some students have
found SME to be the answer to
their Area Two worries, others are
not convinced about the pro
grain's success.
Forty-eight students are en
rolled in SME this quarter, down
from the (i(i who enrolled in the
fall. The program originally had
three tracks which students could
c hoose to take but now only lias
one.
Only the Light track, the one
most favorably reviewed by stu
dents in last spring's ASSU course
guide, is being offered.
I he 112 leart and Earth tracks are
not part of SME this year. 1 lowev
er, some of the concepts of the
tracks have remained in other
classes. The Heart track is the
foundation for The Heart of the
Matter, a sophomore seminar
taught I)}' Biological Sciences Prof.
Ric hard Myers and Genetics Prof.
Bob Simoni this quarter.
There are also current plans to
reconfigure the Earth track, ac
cordingto Mathematics Prof. Brad
Osgood.
SME's goal is to take a theme
and examine it from different aca
demic disciplines. Rather than
hearing a biologist, chemist, physi
cist and mathematician lecture
about their respective subjects, stu
dents learn how each of these pro
fessionals approach the same idea,
which in this year's case, is the topic
of light.
Some students said the ap
proach does not work.
(Iliad Alvarez, a sophomore,
said the program's broad nature is
its main fault. "Breadth never did
anyone any favors and never
solved any problems," lie said.
Sophomore Tiffany Thomas
chopped the Light track last year,
citing the "overwhelming"
amount of work, the large time
commitment and stress as her rea

sons.
Other students said SME offers
an easy alternative to other Area
Two courses on campus.
Sophomore Nick Presley, who
completed the Light track last
year, said "the work was minimal
compared to any other science or
math class" and that he even joked
with his friends about the lack of
difficulty.
"One running joke started
when a friend [majoring in com
puter science] asked me if I had to
do my SME problem set in cray
on," he said.
Overall, teaching assistants for
the course have very positive out
looks.
[on Sack, a third-year doctoral
candidate in Biology who was a TA
last year for the Light track, was
enthusiastic about the program
and class.
"[lt was the] best class I've ever
TAed, and 1 got a chance to live
out those dreams of being Bill
Nye," he said.
ForTAs and lecturers, SME re
quires a large time commitment:
The faculty have to teach outside
oftheir areas of expertise, and they
are required to re-learn lots of in
formation. According to Osgood,
the reason SME takes so much
time to prepare for is that there is
no model to follow. Stanford's pro
gram is "one of the most ambitious
interdisciplinary" science and
math programs, and "there is no
other course around the country
doing what" SME is doing, Os
good said.
Another contributing factor to
the time commitment is that SME
undergoes constant analysis in
order for it to be improved, Os
good said. He added, "The faculty
is stretched, the TAs bent beyond
recc )gnition."
Osgood has traveled the coun
try, giving talks on the SME pro
gram. He recently returned from
a conference with the National Sci
ence Foundation, which awarded
the program a million dollar grant
after its inception.
The direction of SME remains
uncertain and student opinion
continues to be split. While some
students such as Thomas say that
"SME should be the last resort,"
others, like Presley, say that SME
was "a worthwhile class."
