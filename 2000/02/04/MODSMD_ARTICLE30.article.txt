### SCOTT FINKELSTEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Coining off its most impressive
show ingot the season, the Stanford
men's gymnastics team looks to
carry last week's momentum to
Provo, Utah as they compete
against BYU this Saturday.
The No. 14 Cardinal (2-3, 2-3
Mountain Pacific Sports 112 edera
tion) started its season slowly but
showed marked improvement in
last week's (lardinal < )pen, where it
posted ;t season-high 220.05. I his
weekend, Stanford expects to see
similar results when they face
No. 13 BYU (2-2, 1-2).
"Improving our team score by
over 5 points despite having a
somewhat depleted roster and
many missed routines is making
believers out of everyone," said se
nior co-captain Craig Nesbitt.
Stanford brought that positive
attitude into the gym this week and
stepped the intensity up.
" I he team is still dealing with a
few too many injuries but has man
aged to elevate the intensity and
positive motivation to a new high,"
Nesbitt said. "The last home meet
really charged people up and
made them recognize the potential
that this team holds."
Continuing with the two-a-day
workout schedule, the Cardinal
gymnasts worked on improving
their consistency under the most
tiring of conditions.
"For the second week in a row,
[coach llamadaj pushed ns to not
only hit sets, but to do so in rather
large numbers," Nesbitt said. "The
improvements in consistency and
endurance should be evident in the
competitions."
In order to realize its potential,
Stanford will need to continue toel
evate its hit percentage by eliminat
ing falls and missed routines. In last
weekend's performance, the team

hit 42 percent of its routines, a
great improvement over the 28
percent seen in the season opener.
"[Our hit ratio] is still way too
low," said Stanford head coach
Sadao Hamada. "If we push it
above 5(3 percent, our score will
easily improve by three or four
points."
I he last time Stanford compet
ed at BYU was at the 1999 Western
Regional Championships, where
the Cardinal earned a berth to the
NCAA Championships.
"That meet was one of the great
est moments of my life," said junior
co-captain Rico Andrade. "Com
peting at BYU again will bring back
great memories. I know that the
team is ready to make another
strong showing in that arena."
Several Cardinal gymnasts have
been cleared from medical prob
lems and will contribute to the
team score this weekend. Perfor
mances from freshman Paul
O'fx'ary, freshman Matt McLean
and Andrade will be welcome addi
tions to the team's lineup, particu
larly on floor and vault.
Hamada is pleased with his
team's improvement but remains
conservative in bis outlook for this
weekend's competition.
"The quality of our gymnastics is
improving and the guys are elimi
nating deductions from their ion
tines," Hamada said. "I don't care
about beating BYU. I just want to
make sure my team continues its
improvement.
The guys believe in coach
Hamada's plan, and after last
weekend, they now believe in
themselves.
"This will be the first meet that
this team will step out onto the
competition floor and be confident
about its routines," said senior All-
American Jason Katsampes.
"We're expecting to go out and
win."
