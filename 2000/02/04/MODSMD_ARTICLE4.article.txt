## 
### AARON SHAW 
A group of nearly 100 student protest
ers in White Plaza spoke out yesterday
against Proposition 21, the "Gang Vio
lence and Juvenile Justice Initiative,"
which will be on the March 7 state prima
ry ballot.
'File group, comprised of Stanford stu
dentsand local student youth group mem
bers - some as young as 13 years old -
braved the rain to express their opposition
to Prop. 21.
Greated nearly two years ago by
then-Gov. Pete Wilson, the lengthy and
complex Prop. 2 1 represents a
statewide attempt to stiffen the criminal
consequences for violent gang related
offenses.
In addition to several measures in
creasing the ability of prosecutors to bring
minors over the age of 14 into adult court,
the initiative would broaden the ability of
local authorities to utilize wire-tapping
against known or suspected gang mem
bers and subject gang-related murderers
to the death penalty.
The protesters chanted slogans, ex
pressing their belief that Prop. 21 targets
low-income black and hispanic popula
tions. Protesters claimed it will not lower
the current level of violent gang related
crimes through deterrence, but will in
stead result in increased state expenditure
and unjustified severity in the juvenile jus
tice system.
After half an hour in White Plaza, the

protesters marched toward the Hoover
Institute, chanting eilergetic ally.
The group demanded that Hoover I)i
-rector John Raisian refuse to renew Wil
son's Hoover Fellowship and that Raisian
denounce Prop. 21 publicly.
Alter protesters were not allowed to
speak to Raisian, they askc I to have their
demands delivered to him.
1 he crowd then moved to the Law
School, where they cornered President
Gerhard Gasper on his way to a Faculty
Senate meeting.
(Jasper refused to comment further on
his position regarding the proposition.

of campus student organizations such as
Stanford Advocates lor Ghildren, Grass
Roots Organization Weekend, MFGha
and the Stanford Environmental Action
(k >alition.
An Fast Palo Alto group. Youth United
lor Gommunity Action, organized the par
ticipation of local middle and high-school
students.
YUGA's press contact, 15-year old
Menlo-Atherton High School student

tourage politicians and those in power to
"put money into something that can ac tu
ally benefit the youth," as opposed to sim
ply punishing them, she said.
