### JESS DANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
About fifty Stanford students jumped fences
and fought off wind and rain yesterday afternoon
in San Francisco to rally in support of Democrat
Bill Bradley's presidential campaign.
Junior Nathan Christensen, sophomore fv.C.
George and junior Brian Eule, each the head of a
different student group supporting Bradley,
helped organized the trip to the rally in prepara
tion for the March 7 primaries.
l he three were told Bradley thought the
younger audience was an integral part to his cam
paign.
"One of the most impressive aspects of Bradley
is his aim to target the groups many candidates
overlook, such as college students," said junior
Franco Torres, who attended the rally. "He be
lieves we all should have a part in this election."
Approximately 50 undergraduates, a law stu
dent and two faculty members set off in a charter
bus yesterday at 10:30 a.m. to meet Bradley at the
port of San Francisco. Provided with posters and
buttons, students expressed great enthusiasm as
Bradley's van pulled up.
"We specifically invited Stanford students be
cause we wanted to make sure that Bradley re
ceives a warm welcome as he kicks off his cam
paigning in California," said Avery Krut, a rally co
ordinator.
Bradley was greeted by the press and a mob of
Stanford students chanting, "Bradley, Bradley,
Bradley!" shaking many hands as lie passed.
Stanford students, led by a campaign event co
ordinator, proceeded to Bradley's rally, which was
moved indoors to Gabbiano's Restaurant. Stu
dents were led through the kitchen of the restau
rant and allowed to proceed towards the front of
the rally.
Politicians from all over California spoke in sup
port of Bradley including former Republican
mayor of San Francisco Frank Jordan and Con
gressman George Miller. Ernestine Bradley, the
candidate's wife, also spoke.
Miller, promoting Bradley, said, "We need a
Democrat in the White House, but we need the
right Democrat in the White House. We need a
Democrat in the White House that has the courage
to lead. . .and will speak honestly to the American
people and respect their intelligence and their de
rision making process."
Bradley spoke following Miller, concentrating
mainly on health care, education and race rela
tions in his speech.
Bradley, while discussing his dream for Ameri
ca said, "I'm not willing to settle for anything less
than the day-to-day actions on my part and your
part that can push our collective humanity for
ward so we can finally get to a time in this country
where in Toni Morrison's words, 'Race exists but it
doesn't matter.'"
