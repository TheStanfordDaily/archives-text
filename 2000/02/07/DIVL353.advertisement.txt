The Stanford Community is finding the lure of the Stanford
Federal Credit Union QUAD Card irresistible.And why not?
"It offers me what I've been searching for. I've always sensed that
something was missing from my wallet. I didn't realize how great the
need was until that space was filled," states one member who re
quested anonymity.
Indeed, the QUAD Card is an ATM, Checking Debit Card and
Point of Sale transaction card that works just like a credit card (but
it's not a credit card). Because it bears the symbol of Visa it demands
respect and acceptance worldwide. Yet, underneath the big name, the
QUAD Card provides a member-friendly vehicle for accessing your
checking account.
After compiling this report, our recommendation: join the QUAD
Squad. It may be that for which you've been searching. .
Editors Note: Must be 18' years or older and accounts must be in good standing to receive a
QUAD Card. Checking accounts may be verified through TRW and/or Chex Systems credit
bureaus.
