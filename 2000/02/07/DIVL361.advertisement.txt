Ah, Louts!
During your time at Stanford the
odds are pretty good that you'll be
involved in a romantic relationship.
In an environment with no
curfews and few rules, some
guidelines may be helpful.
Successful
Relationships
A successful relationship is one in
which both you and your partner:
■ Sincerely like and enjoy each
other
■ Are able to be yourselves freely
■ Share mutual respect and
commitment
■ Are sexually compatible
(sexuality is broader than just
intercourse)
■ Share similar values
■ Know your own feelings and
needs, and can express them
(unconscious, unrealistic, or
uncommunicated expectations
cause problems)
Trust and Intimacy
These precious qualities take time
to establish. They involve:
■ A willingness to express both
the ups and downs of daily life
■ Taking the risk to trust
■ Establishing emotional safety
(dependability, honesty, loyalty,
and fidelity)
Communication
Studies show that when diffi
culties arise, it's not that couples
don't want to deal with problems,
they simply don't know how.
Communication skills are not
innate; they have to be learned.
Who said there's no dating on
campus?
Start now; they'll serve you for the
rest of your life. Here are tips:
■ Communicate expectations
directly
■ Ask for feedback
■ When your partner talks, listen
to both content and feeling
■ Summarize what s/he is saying
to be sure you understand
■ Acknowledge the other's feelings
■ Remember, all good relation
ships require effort - be honest
as to how much time you want
to invest
■ Long-distance relationships
take even more skill, time and
effort
Fair Fighting
It is normal to have some areas of
differences (e.g., how much time
to spend alone, as a couple, with
others, and in which activities).
Develop "fair fighting" skills:
■ In a disagreement, deal with
one issue at a time
■ Attack the problem, not the
person (accusations trigger
counterattack)
■ Don't exploit sensitive issues or
name-call
■ Stay in the present (no past
• gripes)
■ Don't attack or walk out;
express your feelings instead
■ Be fair: give each person equal
time
■ Remember you're on the same
team: if one loses, the relation
ship loses
■ Admit it when you're wrong
■ Compromise: that means some
of the needs of both partners
are met
■ Let your partner know you
care, and acknowledge good
efforts
Both people have to want a
relationship to work. Keeping it
satisfying is a mutual and on
going process.
If a Relationship Fails
Sometimes a relationship just
doesn't work. We often put off
saying good-bye as long as
possible. Some tips:
■ Allow yourself to feel your
feelings
■ Expect guilt, bargaining, anger,
or self-blame (they're natural
defenses <. gainst feeling loss of
control)
■ Note harmful patterns - it's the
first step toward changing
them
■ Beware of" rebound-relationships"
■ Take on new experiences
gradually
■ Get support, and give yourself
time to heal
A CAPS counselor is available to
help you and your partner at any
stage in a relationship. For more
