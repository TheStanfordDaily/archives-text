MEXICO CITY (AP) — In a
surprisingly smooth conclusion to
the 9 1/2-month occupation of
Latin America's largest university,
police raided the main campus
yesterday and arrested 632 strik
ing students.
Fhe raid ended an exasperat
ing ordeal in which Mexican
authorities from President Ernesto
Zedillo on down seemed unable to
wrest the country's most important

academic institution from a tiny
band of radical students with
names like Mosh and The Devil.
Armed only with batons and
shields, about 2,400 federal police
marched into an all-night meeting
of the student strike council at 6:45
a.m.
They then rounded up about
430 students, including the eight
toj) strike leaders.
The strikers didn't resist arrest

and there were no injuries.
Police then swept through the
giant campus, detaining hundreds
more strikers.
"A democratic society cannot
allow the kidnapping of the
national university," said Interior
Secretary Diodoro Carrasco.
The 291-day strike at the
260,000-student National
Autonomous University of Mexico
began in April to protest plans to

raise annual tuition, which had
been just a few cents, to the equiv
alent of $140.
The university backed down,
but a small core of radical students
continued to occupy the campus.
The)' pushed a six-point agen
da to reverse recent academic
reforms.
They also gave students more
power within the university
administration.
