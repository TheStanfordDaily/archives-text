PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) â€”
With the president beside her and
2,000 supporters chanting her
name, Hillary Rodham Clinton
formally launched her campaign
Sunday to be U.S. senator from
New York, a state she has lived in
only a month.
The race for the seat being
vacated by fellow Democrat
Daniel Patrick Moynihan is likely
to pit Clinton against New York
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in what
could be one of the most flamboy
ant political campaigns in recent
memory.
No other first lady has ever run
for public office.
"1 am honored today to
announce my candidacy for the
U.S. Senate from New York,"
Clinton said as shouts of "Hillary!
Hillary!" rang through a universi
ty gymnasium not far from her
new home in the suburbs north of
New York City.
"1 may be new to the neighbor
hood, but I'm not new to your
concerns," she said, while Presi

dent Clinton; her mother,
Dorothy; and daughter Chelsea
sat beaming behind her.
The president is said to be one
of his wife's top advisers as she
resumes the career she put aside
to help him capture the White
112 louse.
Recalling a speech she made at
her college commencement at
Wellesley in 1969, Clinton said: "1
often return to one thing I said
back then, that politics is the art of
making possible what appears to
be impossible.
I still believe that today. \V'e can
do what seems impossible if we
have the vision the passion and
the will to do it together."
Clinton described her commit
ment to better schools, better
health tare and gun control.
She also took pains to describe
herself as a "new Democrat."
"I don't believe that govern
ment is the source of all our prob
lems or the solutions to them," she
said.
Recent polls have shown Giu

liani with a slight lead over Clin
ton He is also running even with
Clinton among women voters in
New York.
That's a far cry 112 rom a year ago

when sympathy was strong for
Clinton alter the Monica Lewin
sky scandal.
Polls then showed her well ahead
of the mayor.
