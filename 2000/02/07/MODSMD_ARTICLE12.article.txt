Bombing attempts to
undermine North Ireland's
adherence to peace accord

BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) —
Suspected Irish Republican Army dissi
dents bombed a rural hotel yesterday —
an attack that caused no reported injuries
but gave Northern Ireland a bitter
reminder of the days the province is

struggling to leave behind.
It was the first such attack here since
1998, and it came as international pres
sure was building on the mainstream IRA
to begin disarming in support of North
ern Ireland's peace accord.
A caller claiming to be from the Conti
nuity IRA, a small dissident group
opposed to the IRA's 1997 truce, told the
BBC in Belfast that bombs had been left
at two hotels in rural County Fermanagh.
Police evacuated both hotels shortly
before a bomb, apparently inside a car,

went off at the rear of Mahon's Hotel in
the village of Irvinestown.
Police said they couldn't find any sus
picious devices at the other threatened
hotel.
Every political party in Ireland con
demned the attack, including the IRA
allied Sinn Fein.
Sinn Fein's Martin McCuinness, a for
mer IRA commander who is education
minister in Northern Ireland's power
sharing Cabinet, said the Continuity IRA
was "unrepresentative of Irish republi

cans" and should "disband immediately."
But the blast underscored demands
from the province's major Protestant
party, the Ulster Unionists, for an imme
diate start to IRA disarmament.
"We cannot allow any paramilitary
organization, republican or (pro-British)
loyalist, to remain in existence with illegal
guns and explosives," said Ken Maginnis,
Fermanagh's Ulster Unionist member of
British Parliament. "Even if they adhere
to their own cease-fires, their weapons of
war will inevitably end up in the hands of

dissidents."
1 lie Continuit) IRA began bombing
targets after the I RA called a 1994 cease
lire.
I he shadowy group's sporadic attacks
have caused onl\ minor injuries and no
deaths, but it has never called a formal
cease-fire.
Only last month, police in the neigh
boring Irish Republic arrested a suspect
ed Continuity IRA activist in possession of
a van loaded with both weapons and
explosives.
