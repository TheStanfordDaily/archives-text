Last Thursday in San Francisco, Bill
Bradley kicked oil his California campaign
with a talk attended by 50 Stanford stu
dents and 1,650 others. Bradley spoke
about a "new politics," a way of governing
and making decisions that speaks to the
concerns of voters instead of big donors
alone, referring to his long-standing com
mitment to campaign finance reform.
While hardly an original sentiment,
campaign finance reform is crucial to mak
ing democracy more responsive to a range
of interests, not just those of the wealthy.
Such reform, however, is onlv one of a

whole set of reforms needed to bolster
voter participation, but Bradley is the only
candidate who seems to recognize that.
What separates Bradley's reform
rhetoric regarding campaign finance from
the rhetoric of the populist Republican
underdog, John McCain, is that Bradley
recognizes the multiple causes of Ameri
ca's political malaise.
In emphasizing the urgency not only of
campaign finance reform, but also of uni
versal health care, ending child poverty
and talking about race, Bradley hit on an
important point: political participation
requires more than legal rights and cam
paign finance reform. It requires overall

well-being. Without the basics, like educa
tion and health care, most voters never
become political actors. Political freedoms
remain formal at best.
Few candidates recognize and promote
solutions that address the links between
health, education, economic status and
political participation. Bradley recognizes
that overall well-being for many Ameri
cans is independent of stock market fluc
tuations and that a prosperous economy
can always do more to spread its gains
more evenly across the classes.
No candidate is perfect, but Bradley's
agenda to promote well-being takes partic
ipation seriously.
