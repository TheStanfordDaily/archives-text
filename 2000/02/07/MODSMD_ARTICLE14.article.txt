# WHAT THE HECK I'M TALKING ABOUT...
## I coulda been a contendah

Last week, for fiction writing, I wrote a
story with a bloody coyote killing scene. A
pack of coyotes attack a man and his date,
who happen to be sleeping in the Santa
Monica Mountains (incidentally, I can't
seem to write one story that doesn't occur
in my hometown). Then the man — a
lover of red meat who turns out to be a
professional killer (when lacking plot at .'5
a. tn., I go for pure shock value) — kills one
of them, thus scaring the other beasts
away.
Please ignore for a moment the fact
that a wiser, better-read classmate (or at
least one better versed in Discovery chan
nel programming) argued that coyotes
would never attack two apparently harm
less adults — especially if they were in the
Santa Monica Mountains, an area so well
traversed that yon often find yourself
ambling along with a herd of cell-phone
yapping yuppies (I'm not bitter) on your
Saturday morning escape-to-nature.
And they're all carrying reflective Ken
neth Cole lycra sport totes and sipping
from designer bottles of water packed
with hydro-carbon things (gratuitous
!• uzzie remark). I mean, I'm not down on
Kenneth Cole, but on a hike? But, like I
said, I'm not bitter. Coyotes might eat a
baby, my classmate said, but adults? No
way. I won't get into the baby-eating.
But I digress. As my poetry professor
likes to say, I'm going to take oil my
Monty Python antlers and get back to the
subject at hand. But, actually, all these
things fit together. Irately, the idea of
men as "victims" of a consumerist, "orna

mentalist" society has spread like crazy.
Susan Faludi wrote a book about it last
fall — "Stiffed" — and "Fight Club"was
all about Brad Pitt and Edward Norton in
their boxers— I mean, all about men try
ing to get in touch with their masculinity
I))' knocking people out. The weird, dual
identity, blow-up-all-the-skyscrapers end
ing might have been overkill, but that
might have been another case of a.m.
shock value, yon never know.
My coyote-killer was one of these guys
— out in the "mountains," calling upon
that hunter-gatherer instinct that some
men are supposedly dying to reclaim in
this market-driven era. It rings true.
A few weeks ago I was out with my
friend Steve, 24. He showed me his new
watch — it's this funky bauble thing with
an LCD display and elliptical holes in the
band. The face is an elongated rectangle
that constantly runs little messages. Not
the up-to-the-minute stock market
update. Not (INN headlines. It says
things like, "Happy V2K," fortune cookie
things like, "Reshape your destiny," and
completely random things like, "Roll the
dice." Steve was completely convinced of
its effectiveness in wooing the fairer sex.
"The key to the ladies now is accessorize."
I trust he was being ironic.
I can identify with gny friends like Steve
who find themselves subliminally wooed
into the flagship Banana Republic store,
convinced they need that cashmere
sweater set — er, leather bomber jacket —
