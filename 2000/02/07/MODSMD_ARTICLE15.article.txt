Pro-abortion column wasn't
about "malaise"
The Feb. edition of The Daily con
tained a guest column by Klizabeth Reeds
and Kiin Schmidt, misleadingly titled
"Ending the Winter Quarter Malaise,"
that was in fact an advocacy piece for a
pro-abortion group. That such a horrific
subject would be disguised by such an
innocuous title was bad enough, but the
substance of the column was worse.
Reeds and Schmidt characterized their
embracing of pro-abortion extremism as a
transformation from spoiled brats to
enlightened public servants. The truth is
that abortion, and its advocacy, is the
height of irresponsibility and selfishness.
Despite the pro-abortion propaganda
emphasis on the rare cases of rape and
endanger Client of the mother, over 97%
of the abortions performed in America
are elective procedures — which is simply
a euphemism for birth control.
In other words, men and women irre
sponsibly engage in behavior which they
are unprepared to accept the conse
quences of, and then they bail out of the
situation by killing innocent children.
Even if one accepts the conscience-searing

terminology of letus rather than child,
abortion advocates should still rightly be
labeled pro-irresponsibility rather than
pro-choice.
Advocacy of such irresponsibility is not
an act of public service, but rather is an
act of selfishness, in which the needs of
others — the unborn children — are
trampled in pursuit of absolute autono
my.
This truth was well stated by Pope
John Paul II (by the way, 1 am not a
Catholic) in his Encyclical letter titled
The Gospel of Life," when he wrote, "To
claim the light to abortion . . . and to rec
ognize that light in law, means to
attribute to human freedom a perverse
and evil significance, that of an absolute
power over others and against others.
This is the death of true freedom" (p. 37,
emphasis in original).
It is no act of public service to excuse
behavior that is destructive to the charac
ter of the actors and to the lives of the
acted upon.
Rather than reveling in their new
found activism, Reeds and Schmidt
should be ashamed of their ignorance (I
am giving them the benefit of the doubt)
of the irresponsibility and selfishness that

the pro-abortion position advocates. And
The Daily should be ashamed of disguis
ing a pro-abortion piece under the topic
of "malaise."

Cyclists as irresponsible as drivers
"C'mon! You're smarter than that!"
This was a friend of mine's involuntary
reaction when a cyclist pulled out in front
of his car on campus a few weeks ago. I
thought it a fitting observation about an
issue that The Daily addressed on Feb. "2.
A front page article suggested that "c are
less drivers" were a risk to cyclists and
pedestrians, but 1 would argue that
drivers are not solely to blame tor traffic
safety hazards on campus.
For the record, I live oil campus and
regularly navigate the Farm as both a
cyclist and a driver. As a cyclist, I've had a
different experience from the students in
Florence Moore Hall. I find that drivers
are very courteous, often giving me the
right of way at stop signs where clearly
they have priority. I ascribe this to the fact

that I both obey the* traffic signs and make
myself very visible at night with reflectors
and lights.
As a driver, on the other hand, I find
that Stanford cyclists are remarkably
oblivious of right-of-way conventions. In
the vicinity of the new post office specifi
cally, I have seen cyclists hurtle down the
pathway and across the crosswalk without
even slowing down to check for traffic. At
the various intersections by the Ionian
Kngineering Center, cyclists regularly
pass stopped vehicles on the right and
cross the intersection without pausing at
all for stop signs.
At night, reflective apparel and bike
lights seem to be the exception rather
than the rule. The convention is usually
dark clothing and no lights, a combina
tion that makes it difficult for me, and
other drivers, to see cyclists. This is just as
true when 1 am riding my bike across
campus at night along with other students
— it is simply harder to sec someone with
out lights.
Maybe it is my engineering back
ground, but I can't help but look at the
situation in a quantitative sense. The
Stanford tuition is currently between
$23,000 and $36,000, depending on your

student status. A reflective leg strap and
bike lights cost in the vicinity of $35. Com
mon sense is free. The safety precautions
are cheap by comparison, so is it worth
risking the investment by not using them?
Applying my friend's logic, Stanford stu
dents are smarter than that!
