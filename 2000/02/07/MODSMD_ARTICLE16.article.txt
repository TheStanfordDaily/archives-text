# Ross wins award
## Chemistry prof. receives prestigious Nat'l Medal of Science 
### DENALI DEGRAF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Chemistry Prof. John Ross,
along with eleven other leading
American scientists, will be
awarded the National Medal of
Science In President Clinton on
March I I.
I lie Medal, which is the high
est scientific honor in the I nited
Stales, w ill go to Ross for his work
in reaction kinetics and dynam
ics.
liv utilizing the speed with
which re-arrangements ol sys
tems can occur at the molecular
level, Ross' researc li has even led
to chemical computers that ma\
one da\ exceed the capabilities of
traditional ones.
(her the com se of his more
than 50 years of chemical re
search, Ross has become, in the
words ol Chemist t\ Prof. Richard
/are, "a giant iu the area of phys
ical cheinisli \."
Ross' major chemical break
throughs have been in the field of
understanding complex reaction
mechanisms, particularly nonlin
ear systems, and the chemical
species involved.
Previously, chemists would
break clown a reaction into its
parts and attempt to piece to
gether individual steps through
logic and intuition.
Ross' theory is to keep the
w hole system intact and examine
it in its entirety.
"Let's keep the whole chemi
cal system all together, analyze as
man) chemical as possible, in
clude variable inputs and mea
sure responses ol species," ex
plained Ross, "from that, we
construct a thcor\ based on cor
relation functions [quantitative
relationships between different
species involved in tiie reac
tion.J"
/.are spoke liighl\ of Ross'
ideas. "I expect that this ap
proac li w ill have far-reaching and
lasting consequences on t lie study
of complex reaction systems," he
said. "Ross work is most definite
ly changing the way we think
about and understand chemical
reactivity."
Ross said he has seen enor
mous changes in the study of

chemistry during his 50 years as a
researcher. In an interview with
the San Francisco Examiner,
Ross said that he has been able to
watch chemistry become a science
of true understanding, not mere
ly a descriptive one.
Chemistry Prof. John Brau
man, an associate dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, told reporters Ross is "one
of the most original and pro
found thinkers in the world of
chemical science."
Born in Austria in 1926, Ross
lied the Nazi regime in 1940,
moving to New York with his par
ents. Ile was a chemistry major at
Queens College and later earned
a doctorate in chemistry from
MIT.
Ross was an assistant professor
at Brown University beginning in
195;} .iiul later chaired tlit* chem
istry department at M IT.
He joined the faculty at Stan
lord in 1979, where he was the
diair of the Chemistry Depart
ment from 1983 to 1989. In 1'.) ( .>2
Stanford awarded him the Dean's
Award for Distinguished leach
ing.
Ihe National Medal of Science
lias been given to 374 American
scientists and engineers since
President Kennedy gave the first
in 1962. Ross is the 26th Stanford
researcher to receive it.
Through all of his years of
teaching and honors, he has
served as a mentor to over 160
doctoral candidates and re
searchers.
" Nicy have contributed enor
mously, and I am proud of them
as my finest product," Ross said.
"The medal is a wonderful award
for all the work my students and I
have clone through all these
years."
Ross is not the only Stanford
scientist being honored next
month. The Desert Research In
stitute. located in Nevada, has an
nounced that this year's recipient
of the Nevada Medal is Biology
Prof . I larold A. Mooney.
Mooney's research in analyz
ing plants' responses to their en
vironments led DRI to select him
as the winner of the award, which
is accompanied by a $10,000
grant.
Mooney, a member of the Na
tional Academy of Science and
former president of the Ecologi
cal Society of America, will re
ceive the award in ceremonies
held March 2S in Reno and
March 30 in I .as Vegas.
