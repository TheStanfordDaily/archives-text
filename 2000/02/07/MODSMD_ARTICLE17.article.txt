# Attorney claims MLK murder conspiracy
## 
### MELISSA LAMBERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ray Kohlman, a Massachusetts
attorney who has spent the past
19 years investigating the assassi
nation of Martin Luther King Jr.,
told students he believed a mas
sive government conspiracy has
concealed the true identity of
King's assassin.
Kohlman, who conducted his
investigation for the King family
and for James Earl Ray, the con
victed murderer, spoke before an
audience of 14 students in the El
liott Program Center on Friday,
in an event sponsored by Colum
bae House.
According to Kohlman, a
Memphis police officer named
Earl C Hark actually committed the
crim,e and Ray was framed by the
federal government Kohlman
said he has evidence that Clark
was hired by a friend named
Loyd Jowers to kill King. Jowers,
in turn, Kohlman said, was paid
$ 100,000 by "Fat Frank" Liberto,
a Mafia boss who may have been
in league with the FBI and U.S.
army.
Kohlman said King's April
1907 speech, in which he de
nounced the Vietnam War, led
the government to worry that his
words would lead to an anti-war
uprising in the already volatile
South.
"The FBI did not pull the trig
ger [in King's assassination],"
Kohlman said. "But they were
definitely implicated in his death."
Part of Kohlman's claim was
substantiated in civil court two
months ago when a jury unani
mously found that Jowers had
been implicated in King's assassi

nation. Although Kohlman said
Jowers is the key to the whole as
sassination, he believes the con
spiracy goes far deeper.
()n April 3, 1968, King went to
Memphis, Tenn. to mediate a
strike of local garbage workers.
On that night, the Lorraine
Motel, where King was staying,
received a mysterious phone call
saying that King needed to move
to a room overlooking the pool.
"The room he had before was
under the balcony," said
Kohlman, a location from which
it would have been impossible for
an assassin to get a clear shot.
The next evening, King was
gunned down as he stood on the
balcony of his room. Prosecutors
said Ray, an escaped felon who
was in the area at the time of the
assassination, fired the fatal shot
front a building across the street
from the motel.
Kohlman said Ray was coerced
to accept a guilty plea. He was
sentenced to 99 years in prison
but continued to seek a new trial
until his death last February.
According to Kohlman, the
Feds' case was shaky from the be
ginning. The prosecution's chief
witness, Charlie Stevens, claimed
he saw Ray coming out of the
bathroom from which the shot
was supposedly fired, soon after
the assassination took place. But
Kohlman said he learned from
Stevens' wife that at the time
Stevens was "too drunk to know
his own name."
Kohlman proposes instead
that Clark fired the fatal round.
Not only was Clark a good friend
of Jowers, Kohlman said, his alibi
didn't work and he was "anti
black," because his brother had

been killed by a black man.
Several witnesses said that sec
onds after the shot was fired, they
saw a man jump off a retaining
wall across from the motel and get
into a police car.
Kohlman said that on April 4,
the U.S. Army stationed three
teams of snipers on buildings sur
rounding the Lorraine Motel.
He believes the teams had or
ders to kill King if a riot broke out.
But Kohlman said the arm)
wasn't going to take the chance
that a riot might not happen —
they actually engineered one
themselves. They even attempt
ed — but failed — to incite a riot
by kicking "a black group of rab
ble rousers" called 'The Invaders'
out of their hotel.
Although he has not been able
to solidly connect the Army's as
sassination plans with Clark,
Kohlman proposes that the
snipers' presence may have been

a backup plan in case the first as
sassination attempt fell through.
Kohlman said he has evidence
that the military or the CIA prob
ably hired a Portuguese immi
grant named Raul to provide
them with a perpetrator — Ray
— whom they could blame for
King's murder.
Raul was never questioned by
the government and recently re
tired from his work in the import
export business.
Yet when Raul's wife was inter
viewed last year, she said, "You
know, this is a good country —
America. The government comes
around every now and then and
checks to see that nobody has
been fooling around with our
phone. And they check to make
sure that all the cars on the street
are supposed to be there."
"Sometimes I say to myself —
Is this real?," Kohlman asked. "It
is."
