## Baseball proves it's No. 1 with sweep over Titans 
### BRETT KAUFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The impressive Cardinal pitch
ing staff lived up to its billing as
No. 1 Stanford (5-0) swept its
three-game series with No. 2 Cal
State-Fullerton (0-3) with scores of
5-4,3-1, and 7-3 over the weekend
at Sunken Diamond.
The series featured quality
pitching from both teams, and
clutch hitting played a decisive
role in each Stanford victorv.
Friday night's contest saw Car
dinal junior Jason Young struggle
on the mound for the second
straight sunt (44-11*, 3ER, 288,
SK). He often pitched deep into
the count and fell behind hitters,
leading him to a total of 85 pitches
in just four innings.
Young exited the game in the
fifth, trailing by three runs after
allowing four straight singles with
out an out. Sophomore Mike
Gosling (3+lP, OER, 2H, 288,
SK) took over and stopped the
Titan rally, holding them score
less for three innings.
Fullerton's junior Adam John
son (71P, 3ER, 111, 388, 9K)
dominated a dangerous Cardinal
lineup from the start, allowing just
two hits through his first five in
nings.
However, Johnson ran into
trouble in the sixth when junior
rightfielder Joe Borchard (2-for
4, HR, 3 RBI) crushed a three
run, opposite-field home run over
the left-field fence to tie the game.
John Gall's (l-for-4, RBI) sin
gle in the bottom half of the eighth
inning off Titan reliever Kirk
Saarloos (2IP, 2ER, 3H, 188, 2K)
scored senior Edmund Muth (0-
for-1, 3BB) and gave the Cardinal
the lead.
In the Titan's half of the ninth.

sophomore Shawn Norris (1-for
4, HR, RBI) pulled even with
Stanford by hitting a solo HR to
right off sophomore Jeff Bruksch
(21P, lER, 111, 0BB.2K) with the
Cardinal standing only one out
away from victory.
Finally. Saarloos allowed a
leadofl single to junior Billy Ja
cobson, who entered the game as
a defensive replacement in the
ninth. Then after a Fullerton
error and a ground ball to the
right side of the infield, senior first
baseman Craig Thompson (1-for
4, 1 RBI) reached out and pulled a
slow-rolling single between first
and second base to score the w in
ning run in Stanford's 5-4 victory.
"I was just trying to put the ball
in play with two strikes in the
count," said Thompson of his
ninth-inning heroics. "I just hit it
where they weren't."
Bruksch was credited with his
first win of the season despite al
lowing the ninth-inning home
run, and Saarloos got the loss.
Cardinal pitcher junior Justin
Wayne (7IP, 1 ER, 6H, 188, 6K)
fought periodic rain and picked
up his second straight win, defeat
ing Fullerton 3-1 in game two of
the three-game set. I itan junior
Jon Smith (51P, 3R, 2ER, 6H,
188, 2k) could not shut down a
potent Stanford lineup and starts
the year 0-1 after throwing over
80 pitches in five innings.
Wayne's dominating perfor
mance improved his all-time
record to 18-1, the best record
ever for a Stanford pitcher.
"I was able to pitch my game
today," said Wayne. "I give my
hitters a lot of credit. I hey've
given me a lot of run support
throughout my Stanford career."
