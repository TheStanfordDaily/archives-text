## Baseball proves it's No. 1 with sweep over Titans 
### BRETT KAUFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The impressive Cardinal pitch
ing staff lived up to its billing as
No. 1 Stanford (5-0) swept its
three-game series with No. 2 Cal
State-Fullerton (0-3) with scores of
5-4,3-1, and 7-3 over the weekend
at Sunken Diamond.
The series featured quality
pitching from both teams, and
clutch hitting played a decisive
role in each Stanford victorv.
Friday night's contest saw Car
dinal junior Jason Young struggle
on the mound for the second
straight sunt (44-11*, 3ER, 288,
SK). He often pitched deep into
the count and fell behind hitters,
leading him to a total of 85 pitches
in just four innings.
Young exited the game in the
fifth, trailing by three runs after
allowing four straight singles with
out an out. Sophomore Mike
Gosling (3+lP, OER, 2H, 288,
SK) took over and stopped the
Titan rally, holding them score
less for three innings.
Fullerton's junior Adam John
son (71P, 3ER, 111, 388, 9K)
dominated a dangerous Cardinal
lineup from the start, allowing just
two hits through his first five in
nings.
However, Johnson ran into
trouble in the sixth when junior
rightfielder Joe Borchard (2-for
4, HR, 3 RBI) crushed a three
run, opposite-field home run over
the left-field fence to tie the game.
John Gall's (l-for-4, RBI) sin
gle in the bottom half of the eighth
inning off Titan reliever Kirk
Saarloos (2IP, 2ER, 3H, 188, 2K)
scored senior Edmund Muth (0-
for-1, 3BB) and gave the Cardinal
the lead.
In the Titan's half of the ninth.

sophomore Shawn Norris (1-for
4, HR, RBI) pulled even with
Stanford by hitting a solo HR to
right off sophomore Jeff Bruksch
(21P, lER, 111, 0BB.2K) with the
Cardinal standing only one out
away from victory.
Finally. Saarloos allowed a
leadofl single to junior Billy Ja
cobson, who entered the game as
a defensive replacement in the
ninth. Then after a Fullerton
error and a ground ball to the
right side of the infield, senior first
baseman Craig Thompson (1-for
4, 1 RBI) reached out and pulled a
slow-rolling single between first
and second base to score the w in
ning run in Stanford's 5-4 victory.
"I was just trying to put the ball
in play with two strikes in the
count," said Thompson of his
ninth-inning heroics. "I just hit it
where they weren't."
Bruksch was credited with his
first win of the season despite al
lowing the ninth-inning home
run, and Saarloos got the loss.
Cardinal pitcher junior Justin
Wayne (7IP, 1 ER, 6H, 188, 6K)
fought periodic rain and picked
up his second straight win, defeat
ing Fullerton 3-1 in game two of
the three-game set. I itan junior
Jon Smith (51P, 3R, 2ER, 6H,
188, 2k) could not shut down a
potent Stanford lineup and starts
the year 0-1 after throwing over
80 pitches in five innings.
Wayne's dominating perfor
mance improved his all-time
record to 18-1, the best record
ever for a Stanford pitcher.
"I was able to pitch my game
today," said Wayne. "I give my
hitters a lot of credit. I hey've
given me a lot of run support
throughout my Stanford career."

Craig Thompson catches a low ball coming into first in the Cardinal's weekend series against Cal State-Fullerton.
Senior shortstop Eric Bruntlett
(l-for-3, 2RBI) gave Stanford a 2-
0 lead with a sacrifice lly in the
third inningand a fifth-inning sin
gle, scoring Thompson (2-fbr-4,
2B) both times.
Borchard (2-for-4, 38, RBI,
SB) drove in the Cardinal's third
and final run in the fifth with a
triple to left.
The Titans picked up their
only run of the game on a RBI sin
gle for Norris (2-for-4, 2B) in the
sixth.
Freshman Tim Cunningham
(2IP, OER, 011, 1 88, 2K) relieved
Wayne to start the eighth and
kept the Titan bats quiet to collect
his first collegiate save.

In Sunday's season finale,
sophomore Brian Sager (61P,
OER, 2H, 188, 4K) led the way to
a 7-3 win with a dominating per
formance on the mound after
missing his first scheduled start
last weekend because of rain.
" I was chompin' at the bit to get
out there and get the first start
under my belt," said Sager.
Sager allowed only three
baserunners all day, gaining mo
mentum as the game wore on. He
settled in, mixed his pitches well,
and thoroughly shut down the
contact-hitting Fullerton lineup.
Stanford first struck in the sec
ond inning as Borchard (l-for-3)
scored on a throwing error by Ti
tans right fielder Steve Wood
ward.
l lie Cardinal offense was then
ignited by Mutli (l-for-3, HR,
3RBI), who drove a third-inning

slider from starter Ronnie Corona
(6IP, SER, 6H, 488, 3K) far over
the right-field wall with one man
on to take a 3-0 lead.
Senior Joe Savig pinch-hit for
Jacobson (O-for-f, K) in the
fourth, scoring Gall (2-for-3, 2B)
on an RBI groundout. Muth's
fifth-inning sacrifice fly ball to cen
ter scored Thompson (l-for-3,
28, RBI) and gave the Cardinal a
5-0 lead.
Fullerton Staged a rally in the
top of the eighth against Cardinal
freshmen Ryan Gloger (1-fIP,
IER, 2H, 188, OK) and Ryan Mc-
Cally (O+lP, 2FR, 2H, 088, OK).
The Titans slapped three straight
singles off the pair, scoring three
runs in the process.
However, Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess went to Bruksch
(21P, OER, 2H, 188, 2K) once
again, who promptly halted the

Fullerton threat.
The Cardinal scored twice in
the eighth on a wild pitch and a
bases-loaded walk by Saarloos
(HP, IFR, IH, 288, 2K) to take a
7-3 lead.
The Titans made noise in the
ninth, but with two men on and
only one out, senior catcher
Damien Alvarado threw behind
Norris at second base to get the
second out of the inning. Bruksch
picked up his first save of the year
after catching the final Fullerton
batter looking at strike three.
"This was a great game and a
great series," said Marquess after
his 950 th career victory. "We had
another great pitching perfor
mance and played excellent de
fense."
