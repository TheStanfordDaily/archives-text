# Mendez leads Card assault on Trojans
## 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's leading scorer on
the season, freshman Casey Ja
cobsen, had no points at halftime
Saturday afternoon against USC.

6-foot-10-incli Jifirroii Collins,
who averages 12.3 points and 6.3
rebounds per game, had put up
only two points and had yet to
pull down a single rebound.
And streaky shooting guard
David Moseley had almost as

many turnovers (four) as he had
points (six).
Still, the second-ranked Car
dinal held a five-point lead
against the Trojans going into
the locker room at the LA Sports
Arena.
How did Stanford do it?
In one word — defense.
In two — Ryan Mendez.
Stanford, which holds oppo
nents to a nation-low .337 shoot
ing percentage, allowed the Tro
jans to shoot just under 28 per
cent in the first half as the Cardi
nal weathered a poor start offen
sively to put USC away 67-57 in a
grueling, physical game.
Mendez, a junior who lost his
starting job to Jacobsen three
weeks ago, scored a career-high
24 points Saturday to help Stan
ford (19-1, 8-1 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) win its seventh-straight
game and earn a sweep on the
road in Los Angeles.
The victory allowed the Cardi
nal to keep pace with Arizona,
which swept Oregon and Oregon
State in Tucscon, atop the con
ference standings.
"Mendy could do that every
game," Moseley said afterwards,
wide-eyed and excited as ever.
"If they wanted to, everyone on
our team could score 20 points.
"That's what makes us tough.
We believe we're unstoppable
every time down the court.
Teams have to decide which way
they want to get burned."
On Saturday, USC (13-8, 6-3)
chose to get burned on the wings.
While the Trojans double
teamed senior forward Mark
Madsen and Jarron and Jason
Collins inside, Mendez, Moseley
and Jacobsen took advantage, es
pecially in the second half. The
three combined to score 50 of
Stanford's 67 points.
"They gambled a little bit on
defense, but that's how they
play," Mendez said. "They dou
bled down and the wings were
open this game.

"That's what makes us so
good. You take one guy out and
another steps up. Player one
through 13 on this team can hurt
you."
While Stanford's dizzying
depth was more than evident, its
defense also continued to im
press. The Trojans, who aver
aged over 78 points per game
and shot 47 percent going in to
the game, were held to 57 points
and less than 33 percent shoot
ing.
"That's a lot of pride there,"
Moseley said. "That's something
you have to want. I mean, [USC
point guard] Brandon Cranville
only 2-for-12. Mike shut him
down - ding cling. 1 love that."

from tlit* perimeter, had trouble,
though he did score 20 points.
Guarded closely by Madsen
much of the evening, Scalabrine
shot only 8-fbr-20 and scored
seven of his points after the game
was well out of hand.
The Madsen-Scalabrine
matchup was an especially inter
esting one throughout. Both hit
the floor repeatedly while bang
ing for position down low as each
used his ample lower body to
stake out space. Even running
up and down the floor, contact
was prevalent between the two.
"[Scalabrine] had a great
game," Madsen said. "I just tried
to keep a hand in his face and
make him work a bit."
The Trojans' defense was just
as tough, especially in the first
half. Stanford shot only 36 per
cent and turned the ball over 13
times against an energetic, ath
letic squad.
But in the second half, as USC
big men David Bluthenthal and

Kostas Charissis got into foul
trouble, the Trojans looked
tired. Instead of harassing Stan
lord, USC began fouling.
Though the Trojans knocked
down four more second-half
field goals, the Cardinal shot 19
more free throws. Jacobsen shot
twelve himself, hitting nine on
his way to 13 points.
While the Trojans put togeth
er a very strong game for a very
good team, the contest was just
another example of the Stanford
machine in fine form. Other
than a bump on the road against
Arizona at Maples Pavilion a
month ago, the Cardinal have
rolled along through the Pac-10,
absorbing its opponents' best ef
forts before dishing out its own
brand of slow, numbing punish
ment.
"We talk about not giving in,"
said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. '"Don't give in to
the other team. Don't give in to
pressure. Don't give in physical
ly.' And we haven't. The kids
have stayed very focused game to
game. It's been pretty steady."
And steady is just how Stan
ford likes it.

starting job to Jacobsen three
weeks ago, scored a career-high
24 points Saturday to help Stan
ford (19-1, 8-1 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) win its seventh-straight
game and earn a sweep on the
road in Los Angeles.
The victory allowed the Cardi
nal to keep pace with Arizona,
which swept Oregon and Oregon
State in Tucscon, atop the con
ference standings.
"Mendy could do that every
game," Moseley said afterwards,
wide-eyed and excited as ever.
"If they wanted to, everyone on
our team could score 20 points.
"That's what makes us tough.
We believe we're unstoppable
every time down the court.
Teams have to decide which way
they want to get burned."
On Saturday, USC (13-8, 6-3)
chose to get burned on the wings.
While the Trojans double
teamed senior forward Mark
Madsen and Jarron and Jason
Collins inside, Mendez, Moseley
and Jacobsen took advantage, es
pecially in the second half. The
three combined to score 50 of
Stanford's 67 points.
"They gambled a little bit on
defense, but that's how they
play," Mendez said. "They dou
bled down and the wings were
open this game.

"That's what makes us so
good. You take one guy out and
another steps up. Player one
through 13 on this team can hurt
you."
While Stanford's dizzying
depth was more than evident, its
defense also continued to im
press. The Trojans, who aver
aged over 78 points per game
and shot 47 percent going in to
the game, were held to 57 points
and less than 33 percent shoot
ing.
"That's a lot of pride there,"
Moseley said. "That's something
you have to want. I mean, [USC
point guard] Brandon Cranville
only 2-for-12. Mike shut him
down - ding cling. 1 love that."

from tlit* perimeter, had trouble,
though he did score 20 points.
Guarded closely by Madsen
much of the evening, Scalabrine
shot only 8-fbr-20 and scored
seven of his points after the game
was well out of hand.
The Madsen-Scalabrine
matchup was an especially inter
esting one throughout. Both hit
the floor repeatedly while bang
ing for position down low as each
used his ample lower body to
stake out space. Even running
up and down the floor, contact
was prevalent between the two.
"[Scalabrine] had a great
game," Madsen said. "I just tried
to keep a hand in his face and
make him work a bit."
The Trojans' defense was just
as tough, especially in the first
half. Stanford shot only 36 per
cent and turned the ball over 13
times against an energetic, ath
letic squad.
But in the second half, as USC
big men David Bluthenthal and

Kostas Charissis got into foul
trouble, the Trojans looked
tired. Instead of harassing Stan
lord, USC began fouling.
Though the Trojans knocked
down four more second-half
field goals, the Cardinal shot 19
more free throws. Jacobsen shot
twelve himself, hitting nine on
his way to 13 points.
While the Trojans put togeth
er a very strong game for a very
good team, the contest was just
another example of the Stanford
machine in fine form. Other
than a bump on the road against
Arizona at Maples Pavilion a
month ago, the Cardinal have
rolled along through the Pac-10,
absorbing its opponents' best ef
forts before dishing out its own
brand of slow, numbing punish
ment.
"We talk about not giving in,"
said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. '"Don't give in to
the other team. Don't give in to
pressure. Don't give in physical
ly.' And we haven't. The kids
have stayed very focused game to
game. It's been pretty steady."
And steady is just how Stan
ford likes it.
Stanford's leading scorer on
the season, freshman Casey Ja
cobsen, had no points at halftime
Saturday afternoon against USC.

6-foot-10-incli Jifirroii Collins,
who averages 12.3 points and 6.3
rebounds per game, had put up
only two points and had yet to
pull down a single rebound.
And streaky shooting guard
David Moseley had almost as

many turnovers (four) as he had
points (six).
Still, the second-ranked Car
dinal held a five-point lead
against the Trojans going into
the locker room at the LA Sports
Arena.
How did Stanford do it?
In one word — defense.
In two — Ryan Mendez.
Stanford, which holds oppo
nents to a nation-low .337 shoot
ing percentage, allowed the Tro
jans to shoot just under 28 per
cent in the first half as the Cardi
nal weathered a poor start offen
sively to put USC away 67-57 in a
grueling, physical game.
Mendez, a junior who lost his
starting job to Jacobsen three
weeks ago, scored a career-high
24 points Saturday to help Stan
ford (19-1, 8-1 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) win its seventh-straight
game and earn a sweep on the
road in Los Angeles.
