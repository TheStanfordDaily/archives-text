Editor's Not?: This story hicks off an in
depth scries looking at the key issues that will de
fine the 2000 Presidential election campaign.
On Mondays and Fridays each week until the
March 7 California Primary, ire will evaluate
the stances adapted by the leading candidates on
a major issue.
Today xee begin with the issue of what the
government should do with the growing federal
budget surplus.
()ne week into the primary season, this
\ear's presidential election is turning into
a four-man dogfight. Democratic candi
dates Vice President Al Gore and former
Senator Bill Bradley are nearly running
neck-and-neck, while Senator John Mc-

Cain shocked the GOP and the world with
his trouncing of Texas Gov. George W.
Bush in the New Hampshire primary.
And for the first time in recent political
history, the question of how to handle a
si/able budget surplus is a subject of con
troversy and contention in a national race.
While Republicans and Democrats share
many key views with fellow party mem
bers, each candidate has outlined bis own
plan for what to do with the surplus if
elected.
The GOP field
Republican candidates have espoused
the dual aims of returning the surplus to
voters in the form of a tax cut and pro
tecting the Social Security program.
Bush, still the Republican front-run
ner, proposes a $5-trillion, 10-year bud
get plan that involves using $2-trillion for
shoring up Social Security, one trillion
dollars towards a tax cut and the final tril

lion towards national debt reduction.
Bush hopes that the tax cuts will spur
economic growth, which will in turn lead
to even greater surpluses. In a December
GOP debate in Phoenix, he- said, "1 refuse
to accept the premise that surpluses arc
going to decline if I'm the president. I
think they're going to increase, because
my plan will increase productivity by c ut
ting marginal tax rates."
McCain's projections show a $3-trillion
surplus. As president, he has said he
would put $2.67 trillion in the Social Se
curity Trust Fund. The remaining funds
would be split between tax relief,
Medicare and debt reduction. Only live
percent of the total surplus would be ear
marked for debt reduction.
Steve Forbes, the GOP dark horse, la
vors an overall tax cut and an interest rate
cut to spur growth. He calls for the re
moval of Chairman of the Federal Re
serve Board Alan Greenspan. At the
Phoenix debate Forbes said,

"[Greenspan] is try
ing to slow the econo
my down In raising
interest rates...it's like
a doctor saving
you're in great
health, so we have to
make you sic k a little
bit. It's a bizarre theo
ry. It's going to hurt
our economy."

The Democratic candidates
Democratic presidential hopefuls have
placed more emphasis on debt reduction
and support for high-tech industry.
Gore, in a December Business Week
interview, said, "If I'm elected, I [will] re
duce the national debt every veat ... if we
go back into deficit spending, we put our
monetary policy at risk and put new polit
ical pressure on our abilitx to invest in ed
ucation.''

Gore's campaign literature claims, "the
Reinventing Government initiative head
ed by A 1 Gore lias saved $ 137 billion, elim
inated 16,000 pages of regulations, elimi
nated 040,000 pages of needless internal
rules and reduced the federal workforce
by more than 350,000 to its smallest size
since John Kennedy was President."
Additionally, Gore wants to set aside
approximately 15 percent of the surplus
to "lix Medicare." His five-point plan for
economic growth includes maintaining
fiscal discipline, using good economic
times to tackle tough, long-term
economic problems, cutting regu
lations and reducing government
waste, investing more in "educa
tion for the Information Age,"
maintaining America's role as t lie
world's leader.
Bradley's plan calls for a simpli
fied tax code, a major debt reduc -
tion, open markets and low taxes.
On his Web site, Bradley

writes, "We have to keep our mar
kets open. We have to keep the
lowest possible tax rates for the
greatest number of Americans.. .
If the government gets those big
things right, then I think the dy
namism of the private sector [will]
guarantee us a very good growth
rate."
In a Johnstown, lowa debate in
January, Bradley told Gore, "We
have tremendous economic
growth driven by technological
change and globalization, innova
tion and entrepreneurship in the
private sector."
