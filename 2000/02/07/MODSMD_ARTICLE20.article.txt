(" liris Coebrecht brought
her team to Maples Pavilion
with a plan in mind.
If the Women of Troy could
use aggressive defense to deny
hot-shooting Stanford any out
side looks at the basket, it
seemed USC (8-11, 3-0 Pacific
10 Conference) might just be
able to knock off the league
leading Cardinal (1-1-5, 7-2 Pac
-10) for the first time in six years.
I lowever. senior guard Mile
na Mores led Stanford in a 69-
56 inside attack, slashing to the
basket to score a career-high 21
points and dish out five assists to
leave the ftojans foiled again.
USC kept the score close
throughout the first half with
swarming man-to-man pres
sure on Stanford's guards, forc
ing 12 turnovers in the first 10
minutes.
flic Cardinal went into the
game leading the nation by
shooting 4'1.7 percent from the
three-point line, but the I ro
jans did an effective job of shut
ting down sophomore guard
Lauren St. Clair — who boasts a
63.4 percent three-point per
centage in Pac-10 games — and
freshman guard Jamie Care)
from behind the arc.
Mores spatked the Cardinal
by finding holes in the Trojan
defense and driving inside to
score or conned with open
teammates below the basket,
where USC had difficulty han
dling the Cardinal. Junior (fil
ter Carolyn Moos was ,i major
contributor for Stanford in the
paint, posting a double-double
with 10 points and 1 I rebounds.
Moos was answered on the
other side of the court by 6-foot

junior forward I ashara Carter,
who scored 10 points and had
three steals to keep the pesky
Trojans within one point of the
(Cardinal at halftime.
In the second half, USC fo
cused on putting an end to Mo -
res s offensive romp and step
ping up its perimeter shooting.
Kiica Mashia, who missed the
last two seasons with ahipinjun
alter a stellar freshman stint as
the Irojans' starting point
guard, proved a formidable
challenge lor the (Cardinal.
Mashia scored 14 points, in
cluding .3 three-point shots, and
kept the score ( lost' to the end.
However, the foul-ridden
I rojan defense was unable to
handle Stanford's depth. While
Mores no longer found easy
openings into the key, she did
find teammate Carcv open on
the outside. Carey — who has
fired an impressive 51.9 percent
from three-point range — went
2-lor-M from behind the arc and
finished the night with 14
points.
A string of personal fouls
broke open the game lot Stan
lord late in the second half. The
Cardinal capitalized on I S("s

the line, is the I rojans grew
desperate to stop the llow of the
Stanford offense. Junioi for

of her eight points off free
throws, while Moos went 7-for

free-throw shooting on the
night.
