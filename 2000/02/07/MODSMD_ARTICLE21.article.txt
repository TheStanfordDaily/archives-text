# Even Toppel can't kill volleyball losing streak in Indiana
## 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
For the No. 13 Stanford men's volleyball
team (2-6, 2-4 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation), this weekend's trip to Indiana
had many of the same frustrations and dis
appointments that the team has suffered
from since the start of their six game losing
streak on January 19.
In the first non-conference match of its
season, the Cardinal fell in four games 15-
11, 15-9, 5-15, 15-11 to No. 14 Lewis (4-3)
on Friday night. Saturday night wasn't any
better for Stanford as the squad dropped
three games to No. 10 Ball State (6-2) 15-
12, 16-14, 15-10.
"It was a rough weekend for us," head
coach Ruben Nieves said. "We haven't
been tough enough at the end of games or
consistent enough throughout the games.
A sign of mental toughness is the ability to
side-out and we're struggling with that

right now."
An inability to finish games was the
theme of the weekend for Stanford. The
one game that the Cardinal captured Fri
day night stands as the sole reminder to the
squad of its potential and capabilities oth
erwise clouded by lost leads and missed op
portunities.
"We showed heart in that one game
against Lewis," sophomore outside hitter
Marcus Skacel said. "They didn't play any
worse, we just played our game and that's
what we need to do all the time."
In the first game against Lewis, Stanford
overcame a 2-9 deficit and brought the
game to 10-12 before losing 11-15. Again
in game two the Cardinal were very much
in the game at 9-11, but faltered and gave
away a string of points to end out the game.
The momentum from a decisive 15-5 win
in the third game carried Stanford all the
way to a 1 1-8 lead in game four before
Lewis senior outside hitter Eduardo

Quinones served a six point run for the
Flyers.
"In game three we won convincingly;
we had our best stretch of blocking all sea
son," Nieves said. "We felt like we really
turned the match around and in game four
we got ahead. We were up and felt like we
were in control, but all of a sudden our
backs were to the wall."
Despite the loss, freshman middle
blocker Curt loppel posted a career-high
32 kills, bouncing back from an 8-kill all
time low against USC last weekend. Top
pel also tied redshirt freshman Seth Ring
for the most digs with 11 apiece. Behind
Toppel was Skacel with 14 kills and Ring
with 12, but the .150 and .129 hitting per
centages respectively of the team's leading
outside hitters were not strong enough to
carry the team to a victory.
"Against Lewis, more than any other
match we did a good job blocking and de
fending and held them to a .237 hitting

percentage, but offensively we didn't get it
done," Nieves said referring to Stanford's
.215 hitting percentage.
Saturday was more of the same heart
break and frustration, as Stanford worked
to build leads early only to watch them dis
appear.
"It was a tough loss," Nieves said. "It
was as painful a loss as we've had because
we were in position to win all three
games."
In game one Stanford controlled the
pace to a 9-7 lead but couldn't overcome
a five-point run by the Hall State Cardi
nals and fell 12-15. In game two the Stan
lord squad thought it had clinched the
game 15-12 and evened up the match
when a controversial call overturned the
game point and the team ended up
falling 14-16.
In the final game the Cardinal looked
secure with a 10-1 lead, but in just three ro
tations, Ball State had caught up to 10-10

and closed out the game 15-10.
"When we get a lead, we tend to be more
relaxed and passive rather than going for
the jugular," Ring said. "We need to show
more mental toughness to finish games.
We have the talent to beat those teams, but
we don't show the will."
Against Ball State, Toppel boasted an
other impressive performance finishing
the night with 30 kills. Skacel and junior
middle blocker Brett Youngberg both
posted 15 kills. Stanford out-dug Ball Suite
38-33. Freshman outside hitter Kyle Stra
che led the way with eight, but the squad
was out-blocked 14.5-4.5.
"When we'd start giving up streaks, we
weren't a team anymore," Skacel said of the
team's inconsistency this weekend. "We
need to relax and start playing our game
again. Once we let up we lose all motiva
tion, we need to concentrate on staying
steady and keeping our fire throughout
the whole match."
