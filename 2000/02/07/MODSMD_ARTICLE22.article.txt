# Slow-starting Card falters against BYU
## 
### SCOTT FINKELSTEIN 
After a promising perfor
mance at home last weekend,
the Stanford men's gymnastics
team fell to conference rival
BYU in Provo, Utah, this week
end.
No. 13 BYU (3-2, 2-2 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation)
was just too tough lor No. 14
Stanford (2-4, 2-4) in dual meet
competition and won easily by a
final score of 226.375 to
219.300.
Leading the way for the
Cougars were senior All-Ameri
cans Ciuard Young and Court
ney Bramwell. Young da/zled
the loud home crowd en route
to victories in four events as well
as first place honors in the all
around (57.925). Bramwell
took first on the other two
events to make it a clean sweep
for the Cougars.
"They were clearly the better
team," said Stanford junior co
captain Rico Andrade.
The Cardinal came into the
meet with very high expecta
tions. After a solid performance
last weekend and a productive
week of training, Stanford was
ready to surprise BYU.
"(ioing into this meet, we felt
like this would be the break
out," said senior co-captain
Craig Nesbitt. "The team was
very tired and it showed in our
execution."
Put simply, the Cardinal was
unable to come through with
hit routines.
"We choked," Andrade said.
"We need to be able to do
what we do in the gym in com
petition," said junior |ason
Bill/.. "We just have not been
able to do that yet."
Although BYU outscored
Stanford on five out of six
events, the Cardinal turned in
very strong performances on
the l ings. Most notably, fresh
man Marshall Krwin scored a
9.9, a new Stanford team

record.
"We can easily be competi
tive," said Nesbitt. "Fundamen
tally we are as good or better
than most teams, but we haven't
executed on all six events this
season."
Stanford will use the next
week of training to build the
necessary confidence to per
form well under the pressure of
competition.
"I hope this is a huge motiva
tor for the team to work hard in
the gym this week," Andrade
said. "We will go back into the
gym and somehow find the con
fidence in our routines."
Time is slowly running out
on the Cardinal. With just five
meets left before the post-sea
son, Stanford needs to boost its
scores in a hurry.
"It's crunch time," said Biltz.
"We have to post higher scores
or we're not going to make it."
Although the team has the
same slow start every year, with
NCAA Championships coming
three weeks sooner this year,
the Cardinal needs to step it up
and put up big scores.
Next up for Stanford will be
the Southwest Cup in Arizona
next Saturday. That meet will
be a true challenge, as the Car
dinal will be competing without
the help of senior All-American
Jason Katsampes.
While the rest of the team is
in Arizona, Katsampes will be
competing in Las Vegas at Win
ter Cup next weekend. Winter
Cup is a national team qualifier
and is the first step towards
making the ()lympic team.
Kven though it will be with
out Katsampes' help, the Cardi
nal hopes to improve upon this
weekend's performance and
post a much higher team score.
"When we do hit and bring
in the big scores in the next few
meets, it will be a surprise to
everyone but us," Nesbitt said.
"We know we can, but until we
do it, it doesn't mean a thing."
