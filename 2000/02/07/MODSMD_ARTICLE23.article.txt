### ALEX BENJAMIN 
Coming off a close 19-18 victory over Port
land State last Saturday and despite injuries to
senior Rudy Ruiz (125 pounds) and freshman
Harold Penson (174 ), the Stanford men's
wrestling team returned to Burnham Pavilion
on Friday. The team captured a 33-13 victory
over Cal State-Fullerton in its final home meet
of the year.
Four-year starter and senior co-captain Xach
Zimmerer opened the meet in typical fashion.
Zimmerer, who is ranked first in the Pat-10 and
sixth in the nation at the 133-pound weight
class, pinned David Rodriguez 2 minutes, 22
seconds into the first period, which improves li is
untainted record to 12-0.
Two others celebrating Senior Night were
also key in pushing the Cardinal to victory. Co
captain and four-year starter Warren McPher
son, third in the Pat-10 and 19th in the nation
at 157-pounds, came out with a 6-3 win over
Cal State-Fullerton's Ben Nakamura. Clay

Hackerman, fifth in the Pac-lOat 165-pounds,
pushed his way to a 5-2 victory over Kenny
Murray.
Other key wins came from sophomore Levi
Weikel-Magden (141), freshman Rohner Seg
nitz (184) and redshirt freshman Brad Selby
(28;")). Weikel-Magden pinned Nico Saldana
2:37 into the second period, Segnitz came out
with a 8-2 victory over Yzidro Lago and Selby,
returning to the team after an extended football
season, was able to put Rene Delgado to his back
in the third period.
With this win over the Titans the Cardinal
improves to 3-4 overall and 2-4 in the Pacific 10
Conference, and it leaves Cal State-Fullerton
still searching for its first team win.
Friday night was only a warm-up as the team
traveled to San Francisco State on Saturday to
compete in the All Cal Invitational, where three
wrestlers were able to place in the top four.
Sophomore Justin Walker defeated Dallen
Phillips from UC Davis and Aaron Charst from
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo and lost against a

strong Ralph Lopez, 12-4 on the year, to finish
second at the 141-pound weight class. Weikel-
Magden, also at 141-pounds, placed third with
wins over Tom Barwis as well as Phillips, both
from UC Davis, and with a loss to Lopez.
Sophomore Andy Hunter at 197-pounds,
coming off a tough loss on Friday against sec
ond-ranked Babak Nejadmaghaddam, had a
good showing on Saturday with wins over Tom
Gohde from Fresno State, Max Harris of Cal
State-Bakersfield and Miguel Garcia of San
Francisco State to place fourth.
With only two meets left, Friday against Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo and Saturday against
Fresno State, the team is looking ahead to the
fast-approaching Pac-10 championships.
"We've had a very up-and-down season,"
Ruiz said. "With the past few weeks in particu
lar bringing so many injuries throughout the
lineup. I expect that, as in the past, our team will
bring the experiences and training of the season
to a peak for Pac-10's, our most important tour
nament as a team."
