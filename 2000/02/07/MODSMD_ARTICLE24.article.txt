# Mars Lander silent

Almost two weeks after distant
radio signals received by the Dish
raised hopes that the $l()5-million
Mars Polar Lander remained
functional, a lack of radio contact
has quelled the initial excitement.
NASA had officially ended the
search lor the lost spacecraft Jan.
17. Later that week, however, a re
view of recorded data at the Dish
revealed signals from Dec. 18 and
Jan. 4 that could have been sent by
the lander.
The pitch and frequency varia
tions of the signals were character
istic of the lander, according to
Stanford scientists.
NASA scientists have been
beaming commands for the last
two weeks, ordering it to radio
earth and reset its internal clock.
However, sensitive antennas in
England, the Netherlands and
Italy, as well as the Dish, have not
yet received a reply.
NASA administrators empha
sized from the outset that the orig
inal signal traces did not likelv
originate from the craft. Polar
Lander Project Manager Richard

(look, alter the discovery of the pu
tative signals, told reporters "it's a
real long shot, and I wouldn't want
to get anyone too excited about it."
The lander was last heard from
on Dec. 3, as it was entering the
Martian atmosphere.
Although scientists acknowl
edge that there is no chance of the
lander completing its mission, the
stakes in the past weeks of long-dis
tance phone tag are high.
"If the lander is up there and it's
talking to us, that tells us a tremen
dous amount of information . . .
That would go a long way to un
derstanding what might have gone
wrong to put us where we are
today," Callas said.
A functional lander would sug
gest that had terrain rather than
human error caused the lander to
fail. II this proves true, NASA may
save some lace after being widely
criticized for a string of missions
that failed due to poor design.
The Mars Polar Lander disaster
was one of two NASA failures last
year. I he Mars Climate Orbiter is
believed to have burned up in the
Martian atmosphere in September
due to a units conversion error.

Scientists gather for a press conference at the Dish to discuss the possibility of
contact with the Mars Polar Lander.
