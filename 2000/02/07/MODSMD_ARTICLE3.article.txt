As part <>l its first annual confer
ence last Friday, Stanford's Mexi
can Student Association invited
four prominent thinkers and
politicians to share their perspec
tives on the upcoming presidential
election later this year in Mexico.
About 150 people attended the
panel discussion titled "Election
2000 in Mexico: Last Call for
Change?", which referred to re
cent changes in Mexican politics,
which has been dominated for 70
years In a single political patty,
I'RI (Institutional Revolutionary
Partv). 1 he event took place in lec
ture hall 290 of the Law School.
I'RI, the incumbent party, is
currently in the lead for the presi

dential vote at 45 percent. Oscar
Levin, president of the executive
committee of the PRI, said lie was
confident PR I would win the pres
idential election. The Mexico City
mayoral election, he said, "is the
important one. If we win by [less
than J six to seven percent, we're
not doing very well."
I he speakers cited corruption,
voter distrust of state institutions
and wide-spread poverty as the
main obstacles halting Mexico's
progress to true democracy.
Creel, of the center-right PAN,
called the 2000 elections "a transi
tion, a gradual transformation of
the old, closed system to a new,
open one."
