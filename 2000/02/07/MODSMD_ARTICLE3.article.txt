### NINA HOLLY 
As part <>l its first annual confer
ence last Friday, Stanford's Mexi
can Student Association invited
four prominent thinkers and
politicians to share their perspec
tives on the upcoming presidential
election later this year in Mexico.
About 150 people attended the
panel discussion titled "Election
2000 in Mexico: Last Call for
Change?", which referred to re
cent changes in Mexican politics,
which has been dominated for 70
years In a single political patty,
I'RI (Institutional Revolutionary
Partv). 1 he event took place in lec
ture hall 290 of the Law School.
I'RI, the incumbent party, is
currently in the lead for the presi

dential vote at 45 percent. Oscar
Levin, president of the executive
committee of the PRI, said lie was
confident PR I would win the pres
idential election. The Mexico City
mayoral election, he said, "is the
important one. If we win by [less
than J six to seven percent, we're
not doing very well."
I he speakers cited corruption,
voter distrust of state institutions
and wide-spread poverty as the
main obstacles halting Mexico's
progress to true democracy.
Creel, of the center-right PAN,
called the 2000 elections "a transi
tion, a gradual transformation of
the old, closed system to a new,
open one."

Lorenzo Meyer was one of four speakers at the first annual conference of
Stanford's Mexican Student Association.
The speakers were Levin;
Lorenzo Meyer, journalist and
professor of political science in El
Colegio de Mexico; Santiago
Creel, National Action Party can
didate for Mayor of Mexico City;
and Imanol Ordorika, founder of
the Party of Democratic Revolu

tion who filled in for the absent
PRO president Amalia Garcia.
Views on the degree of transi
tion varied distinctly among the
speakers. Ordorika, representing
the center-left PRD, favored a
more direct approach. He cited
"[increasing] salaries, employment
and free education" as the party's
main goals in the 2000 elections.
Lucrecia Santibanez, one of the
conference organizers and a doc
toral student in the School of Edu
cation, said the election confer

ence "shows politics from the in
side" and provides students with a
concrete counterpart to academic
political discussions.
"MSA's goal for the conference
was to show all possible points of
view in the Mexican election," said
Santibanez. "We wanted to show
that it is possible to have change."
Alberto Simpser, MSA's acade
mic coordinator and a doctoral
candidate, explained: "The con
ference focuses on the democrati
zation of Mexico and shows that

the democratic contest [in 2000] is
really a contest."
In an effort to reach out to mul
tiple student groups, the MSA
plans to continue the educational
conferences next year, possibly
inviting CEOs of major Mexican
companies to speak at Stanford.
The conference organizers said
that several prominent (.KOs are
Stanford alumni.
Beatrix Magaloni-kerpel, an as
sistant professor of Political Sci
ence, was the panel moderator.
