# SPOON still strong
## Efforts to feed poor continue despite reduction in waste 
### MARY CRISHAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In its thirteenth year of service,
the student-run Stanford Project
on Nutrition continues to work to
eliminate food waste on campus
after smoothing over differences
with University Dining Services
that threatened to disrupt the
project last year.
Dining Services streamlined
operations last year to cut costs,
leaving SPOON, which depends
heavily on dining hall excess, with
less food to deliver to kitchens.
"Although this inherently
meant less food left over for
SPOON, the goals of our organi
zation and of University Dining
Services worked, and continue to
work, in concert," said junior
Theresa Sgobba, SPOON's vol
unteer coordinator.
SPOON continues to actively
collect leftover food from all cam
pus dining halls and the Toyon
eating clubs, as well as the Faculty
Club, Tresidder Union and other
special events. A number of Row
Houses, self-operated houses and
Suites Eating Clubs have also
begun to donate food to SP()()N.
Junior Mike Hwa, in his sec
ond year of involvement with
SPC )ON, serves as one of the Last
campus coordinators. He de
scribed his position as the "go-be
tween" between the dining man
agers and the student volunteers.
The campus coordinators con
tact the dining managers of the
dining facilities to set up a sched
ule for the food pick up and then
inform the volunteers of these
times. Volunteers collect the food
in plastic bags, take inventory and
label the bags, and store the bags
in two freezers located in the 1 laas
Center and The Bridge.
Community volunteers then

collect the food for allocation
among local food kitchens. I he
majority of the collected food is
donated to Urban Ministries of
Palo Alto; 95 percent of the food
Urban Ministries serves to needv
families is received from SP()()\ .
Navigated by a board of I co
ordinators, SP()()N is a coopera
tive project with no particnlai

head or president. "The coordi
nators' responsibilities range
from organizing food pickups at
dining I Kills and row houses to
promoting campus awareness of
hunger tool gani/ingand recruit
ing volunteers, and they serve as
liaisons to teams of volunteers

across the campus," Sgobba said.
The number of volunteers in
SPOON fluctuates throughout the
year, but Sgobba attributed
SPOON's continued success and
survival to the "wide base of sup
port and commitment of volun
teers spread across campus."
Collecting and redistributing
leftover food from dining facilities
on campus is far from SPOON's

sole activity, however. Currendy,
SP( )ON is organizing a community
campaign to collect and salvage left
over f(K)d from local restaurants
and catering services.
Visits to local hunger-alleviating
agencies and participation in na
tional hunger events are also ways
in which the organization reaches
to achieve its fundamental goal of
promoting awareness of hunger
and homelessness on campus.
Sophomore Randa Serag,
hunger awareness co-coordinator,
designated three main hunger
events that SPOON facilitates. In

the final stages of planning is the
Hunger Banquet. This banquet
aims to raise student awareness of
the reality of hunger in the world.
"It really drives the point home,"
said Serag. "We are in a very big

bubble here at Stanford, and we
need to get out and become aware."
In April, SPOON facilitates par
ticipation in the Hunger Clean-Up
Fundraiser. Volunteers are spon
sored to work at organizations.
