# UC minority applications up this year

### TOMOKO SAKAI 
For the first time since the ban
on affirmative action took effect
in 1997, three University of Cali
fornia schools — UCLA, UC-
Berkeley and UC-San Diego —
have seen an increase in Latino
and black applicants that has out
paced applicants of other ethnic
groups. But at Stanford, the ef
fect of Proposition 209 remains
unclear.
The ruling only sti ic tlv applies
to public universities in Califor
nia, but Dean of Admissions
Robert Kinnally said "there nun
be some perception that private
institutions are also covered."
This year UC-Berkeley saw a
20 percent increase in Latino ap
plicants— an all-time high —
and African American rates were
up by 0.7 percent. By compari
son, Asian American applicants
increased by only 7.3 percent and
whites by a mere 0.8 percent.
The 1999 fall application
numbers suggest that critics fear
ing the resegregation of UC
schools were "crying Chicken 1 .it
tie prematurely," UC Regent
Ward Connelly said last week in
a Los Angeles limes article. Con
nelly orchestrated the end of af
firmative action in the UC sys
tem.
I he UC system has been criti
ci/ed In some, who sav the ruling
suggested to minorit\ students
they were no longer welcome at
the most selective of the UC
schools.
UC-Berkeley and l ( .I A offi
cials attribute this turnabout to
extra efforts made to recruit and
encourage students from under
privileged communities in the
neighboring areas.
Stanford does not release sta
tistics on the race and ethnicity of
applicants unless they are ac c ept
ed into the University. However,
the ethnic breakdown of incom
ing freshmen at Stanford for this
fall consisted of 8.3 percent
African Americans, 8.3 percent
Latinos, 24.2 percent Asian Amer
icans and 51.3 percent whites.
"Stanford is free to follow the
ruling of the Supreme Court in
The Regents of the University of
California v. Bakke," Kinnally
said. "My concern is that people
outside of California may not
know that private institutions are
free to follow the rule set forth in
Bakke."
The Bakke decision, in compli
ance with Prop. 209, reads:
"school officials may not take* race
into account in order to achieve a
particular desired racial mix."
However, Kinnally said "race
is a factor that may be considered
among others in building a di
verse educational community."
Some students said they were
pleased with Stanford's commit
ment to diversity.
"It was very encouraging that
President Casper did re-inforce

Stanford's commitment to diver
sity in hiring and admission," said
Black Community Service Center
Asst. I )irector James Jordan.
Freshman Ximena Martinez
also praised the University's ad
mission policy. "Affirmative action
benefits minority groups by pro
viding equal opportunities to the
underprivileged. I hope Stanford
remains unaffected by Prop. 209."
UCLA saw an even more signif
icant increases in its African Amer
ican applicant pool: an increase of
15.7 percent from last year, while
Latino applicants shot up by 13.9
percent. Asian Americans appli
cants increased by 6.5 percent and
whites were up by 2.7 percent.
Overall, more than 66,000 stu
dents applied to become fresh
men at one or more of the nine
UC schools, an increase of 4.4
percent from the previous year,
according to university officials.
The text of Prop. 209 states
that "the state shall not discrimi
nate against, or grant preferential
treatment to, any individual or
group on the basis of race, sex,
color, ethnicity or national origin
in the operation of public em
ployment, public education or
public contracting."
