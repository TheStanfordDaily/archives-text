## Hijacked airliner leaves Central Asia 
### 
Afghanistan airliner
co n tin ues flight after
nine passengers freed

MOSCOW (AP) â€” The
Afghan passenger airliner
forced by hijackers on a tense
journey across Central Asia and
Kurope left Moscow early today
alter nine passengers were
freed.
The plane's destination was
not immediately known, but a
spokesman for Russia's Federal
Security Service said the hijack
ers had demanded European
flight maps before leaving.
There was no immediate
indication of why the nine pas
sengers were released, security
service spokesman Alexander
Zdanovich told reporters at
Moscow's Sheremetyevo-1 air
port. He said the hijackers had
made no political demands.
Similar releases took place at
the plane's refueling stops in
Kazakstan and Uzbekistan.
None of the people aboard
the Boeing 727 belonging to
Afghanistan's Ariana Airlines
had been harmed, Zdanovich
said, although it remained
unclear how many people were
aboard. Russian news reports
said there were 131 passengers
and nine crew before the
release in Moscow, but other
souYces said there were as many
as 160 aboard.
I he passengers included 20
women and 23 or 24 children,
said Zdanovich. All the passen
gers released in Moscow were
male.
Zdanovich said the hijackers
had asked only for food, for the
plane's toilets to be cleaned and
for refueling. He said the plane
was headed for Western
Europe, but had no specifics;
Russian news agencies, citing
unspecified sources, said the
hijackers were considering
London, Madrid, Paris and
Frankfurt.
The plane, carrying at least
140 people including the
hijackers, landed in Moscowat
about 9:20 p.m. yesterday.
Trucks and buses loaded with
elite commando teams, police
and rescue workers converged
on the airport.
Sniper teams moved into
Sheremetyevo-1, the terminal
where the plane landed, and
security was heavy in the area.
Afghan diplomats arrived at the
airport about 90 minutes after
t lie plane landed and Russian
news agencies said they were in
negotiations with the hijackers.
One diplomat who declined
to give his name said the hijack
ers were seeking the release of a
prisoner from the Afghan city

of Kandahar.
An emergency official in
Kazakstan, where the plane
landed before heading to
Moscow yesterday morning,
said there were 20 hijackers
aboard the Boeing 727, but
three passengers who were
released in Kazakstan said eight
to 10 hijackers were aboard.
Ten passengers were
released in Uzbekistan, the
hijacked plane's first stop,
according to an Afghan opposi
tion spokesman, identified only
as Abdullah. A further three
were released in Kazakstan.
The hijacking comes six
weeks after an eight-day hijack
ing of an Indian Airlines plane
ended peacefully in southern
Afghanistan.
The hijackers in that case
freed their hostages after India
released three pro-Kashmiri
militants from jail.
Abdullah denied that the
Afghan opposition was respon
sible for the latest hijacking, say
ing, "We condemn any act of
terrorism."
Afghan media earlier had
speculated that the hijackers
wanted the release of opposi
tion figure Ismail Khan, a for
mer regional governor who has
been held since 1997 by
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
movement. He reportedly is
being held in Kandahar.
Russia does not recognize
the Taliban and the Afghan
diplomats in Russia have ties to
the opposition.
The Ariana Airlines plane
was seized earlier yesterday
while on a domestic flight from
the Afghan capital, Kabul, to
the northern city of Mazar-e-
Sharif.
After four hours in the
Uzbek capital, Tashkent, it took
off for Kazakstan.
The aircraft next landed in
the northern Kazak city of
Aktyubinsk, where Kazak spe
cial forces surrounded it and
officials negotiated with the
hijackers.
The plane was forced to land
in Aktyubinsk because of a leak
in its right fuel tank, the Kazak
spokesman said.
It was not immediately
known whether the leak was
fixed while on the ground in
Kazakstan.
The Afghan state-run airline
is under international sanctions
and is not permitted to fly inter
national routes.
Ariana has four aging Boe
ing 727 aircraft and five Rus
sian-made Antonov aircraft.
Maintenance conditions are
considered extremely poor in
the country, which is bankrupt
and has been battered by more
than 20 years of war.
