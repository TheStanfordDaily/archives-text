If every job you've looked at has just seemed a little too small, there might be a place for you at
Plumtree. For two years, Plumtree has been a place where some of the most interesting,
intelligent people you could ever hope to meet have come to work. The founder and leader of
the corporate portal market, Plumtree is a San Francisco-based, pre-IPO software company
creating a new Web currency for businesses to exchange information and services â€” empowering
each user of the Web to assemble a Yahoo! -like experience of her work and her world.
We re looking for bright people of all majors with the drive and creative energy to change what
people see when they turn on their computers in the morning. We have openings in
engineering, marketing, business development, and sales. If you have a passion for technology
and if you've truly excelled in your studies, or at anything else, we hope you can take the time to
meet with us at a get-together February 8.

resume, write hireme@plumtree.com. For a cover letter, just tell us one thing you consider
yourself good at, and why you're interested in Plumtree. Plumtree is an equal opportunity
employer.
