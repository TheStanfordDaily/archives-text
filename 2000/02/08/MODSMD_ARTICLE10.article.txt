# Experts unravel web of cyberspace privacy
## Silicon Valley execs declare federal regulation premature 
### SCOTT DORFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Over forty leading legal scholars, informa
tion technology specialists, and government
officials assembled at Stanford I .aw School
yesterday for a day-long conference entitled
"Cyberspace and Privacy: A New Legal Para
digm?"
The purpose of the conference was to "ex
amine the legal ramifications of the brave new
world of cyberspace for [the] core right (of
privacy]," according to a Law School press re
lease. The conference was divided into four
panels: privacy of space, privacy of communi
cations, privacy of property and privacy of
personality, each meeting for approximately
an hour and a half.
Members of each panel presented widely
differing views on how privacy should be pro
tected on the Internet, as well as who should
be responsible for regulating personal data
collection and protection in cyberspace.
"I believe that three approaches [to priva
cy protection] exist," saicl Law School Dean
Kathleen Sullivan, moderator for the privacy
of space and privacy of personality panels.
"One approach is to leave it to the market, an
other would be through common law adjudi
cation, and a third would be to bring in the
government. These are, of course, oversim
plified, but I think sum up the options that are
out there."
Silicon Valley executives eschewed the
need for federal regulation of cyberspace, say

ing that self-enforcement and the market can
be effective in protecting privacy online. "I
think federal regulation is premature at this
point," said Colleen Pouliot, senior vice pres
ident and general counsel of Adobe Systems
Inc.
"Ultimately, bad publicity and negative
press coverage are very strong incentives for
companies to engage in good privacy protec
tion procedures."
"With the Internet, you have to care for
your consumer, or you are going to fail," said
Bob Kimball, associate general counsel for
Real Networks, Inc. "We set the bar regarding
privacy very high: above what is legal, because
we want consumers to trust us. Just doing
what's legal is not enough."
Proponents of governmental regulation
argued that the market has not proven effec
tive in protecting privacy online.
"The market hasn't worked in the past in
developing adequate mechanisms to protect
privacy," said Prof. Joel Reidenberg of Ford
ham University Law School. "In fact, it has
been an abject failure in that respect. Govern
ment intervention will not work in and of it
self with a complex system like the Internet,
but it can help."
Federal Trade Commisioner Mozelle
Thompson also discussed the problems the
market has experienced in trying to protect
privacy.
"I testified to Congress that I was con
cerned about the quantity and quality of pri
vacy protection on the Internet," said
Thompson. "The FTC continues to support
self-enforcement rather than governmental
regulation, but when a company violates its
own policies we will take action, as we did
when it was discovered Getxities was selling

information about children to other parties."
Panelists also debated the global problems
that arise when trying to protect privacy on
the Internet, as nations often have differing
conceptions of what privacy is and how it
should be protected.
"In the United States, privacy is a market
based notion, while in Europe it is a political
and human right," said Reidenberg. "The ap
proach to protection of privacy is far more
comprehensive in Europe than the U.S.,
where solutions tend to be ad-hoc. I believe
the net can allow these differences to be arbi
trated, and that co-regulations can exist."
Others argued that differences between
nations are not as great as they may seem. "Al
though statutes differ in East Asia, South
America, Europe, and other parts of the
world, basic: principles of fair information
practices are almost universal," said Marc
Rotenberg, executive director of the Elec
tronic Privacy Information Center.
Panelists agreed that this year is crucial to
wards determining what direction privacy
protection online will take. "2000 is a very im
portant year: there is mounting public con
cern over online privacy, and not just from
fringe elements," said Thompson.
"People want to know exactly what is hap
pening to the personal data they submit over
the Internet. And numerous legislation is
being drafted in Congress on the topic."
The conference was presented by the Stan
ford Law Review, in conjunction with the
Stanford Technology Review and the
Stanford Program in I .aw, Science and Tech
nology.
