### CORINNE YATES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last week was "Jews in Space"
and this week is "Jews on Ice." The
Jewish Student Association is step
ping up its social activities to in
clude a broad range of new medi
ums.
"Jews in Space" last Thursday
was a movie night featuring Mel
Brooks flicks and beverages such as
the "fuzzy astronaut."
"A little schnapps, some good
Jewish humor," said JSA president
Cody Harris, a senior.
This Thursday, "Jews on Ice"
will feature the Stanford Jewish
community in a broomball game at
Redwood City's Ice Oasis.
"Both of these events showcase
how far the Jewish community has
come socially in the past year," said
Harris. "We never would have had
the demand for events like these or
the drive to put them together
until this year."
After a few years of low demand
for social activities from the Jewish
community, Harris and the JSA
Board set out this year to revamp
the association by creating and
promoting more social events.
"The whole board is putting in a
lot of effort to make a fun Jewish
community a reality this year," said
Harris.
The ass<xiation began the year
targeting younger students by
hand-delivering "welcome bags" to
all known Jewish 112 reshmen during
()rientation. Its hope was to build a

foundation for enthusiastic leaders
in the future.
Last quarter, about 350 Stan
ford students from the Jewish
community and beyond came to
gether for the 23rd annual
Champagne and Chocolate 1 ast
ing.
" The main thing that I like
about the JSA is that it is unlike a lot
of religious groups because it does
not attempt to mask outside agen
das in the context of social events,"
said freshman Nevin Ciewertz, who
attended the event."It simply is
just a bunch of Jews getting togeth
er to schmooze, kvetch and have a
good time."
Gewertz said the social activities
give him a chance to meet new peo
ple and to build friendships with
those that attend events on a regu
lar basis.
"I've been involved in many
Jewish youth groups throughout
my high sch(x>l years and 1 would
say that this one has been the most
successful because of the attitude
that the members and the organi
zation take," said Gerwertz. "It is
really just a comfortable and con
genial environment that fosters
friends and fun."
Sophomore Adam Abeles, the
association's co-director of com
munication and publicity, is ac
cepting RSVPs for "Jews on Ice."
To receive information about fu
ture events, students can join the e
mail list "jsa-social@lists" or con
tact any member of the association
