## Two drug companies to merge 
### 
NEW YORK (AF) — After a
bruising three-month takeover
battle, Pfizer Inc. struck a deal to
buy Warner-Lambert Co. for
$92.5 billion yesterday in a merger
that puts Viagra and the choles
terol drug Lipitor in the same cor
porate medicine cabinet.
l he combined company, to be
called Pfizer, will be the world's
second-largest drugmaker. But il
the merger succeeds as analysts
expect, the company is expected to
vault to No. 1 within two years.
The challenge for executives of
both companies is to put aside
their nasty accusations and lawsuits
and unite their research, sales and
manufacturing efforts.
For consumers, the gargantuan
merger will have little short-term
effect. Ihe new Pfizer will control
less than 7 percent of the world
market fbi prescription drugs.
but the companies contend th.it
by combining they will be able to
more effectively develop new
medicines as well as hold down
expenses.
"We predict the integration will
go very smoothly," said William C.
Steere Jr., Plizer chairman and
chief executive, who will lead the
business.
Warner-Lambert chairman and
CEO Lodewijk J.R. de Yink is step
ping aside once the merger is com
pleted this summer.
"'l'he fact that de Yink will not
be staying will be sufficient to clear
the air," said Dr. Joseph Zammit-
Lucia, president of London-based
Cambridge Pharma Consultancy.

to a takeover bv ypieiican
Products. De Yink was to be the
top executive of the combined
American I lome-Wai ner-Lani
bert. but Plizer stepped in with its
own hostile offer.
Pfizer won by offering 2.75
shares of its stock for each Warner-
Lambert share, a deal valuing
Warner-Lambert at $101.06 a
shaie.
In trading Monday on the New
York Stock Exchange, Warner-
Lambert rose $2.75 to $97.41 1/4,
Plizer rose $1 to $36.75 and Amer
ican Home gained $2.93 3/4 to
$48.43 3/4.
Before moving forward, Warn
er-Lambert will pay American
Home $1.8 billion — the largest
breakup fee in history. American
Home will use the money to help
pay the legal bills from health
claims brought by customers who
used its diet drugs.
