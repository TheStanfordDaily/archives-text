# Clinton sends budget to Congress
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — To a chorus of
Republican ridicule. President Clinton sent
Congress his budget finale yesterday, a $1.84
trillion plan to expand health care access,
shrink the national debt and shower Demo
cratic constituencies with election-year
largesse.
Blessed with a budgetary bonanza thai past
presidents could only dream about — a pro
jected .$2.92 trillion in federal surpluses over
the iiext'Mcrl/de"—'Cfiirton used his sjJi'rttliri'g

everyone.
He would cut taxes lor the sick, elderly,
poor and college-bound; spend more for the
environment, schools and gun-law enforce
ment; and erase the $3.7 trillion publicly held
portion of the national debt bv 2013.
1 he proposal is sure to be heavily
reworked by Congress, where defiant Repub
licans dismissed it as a gambit to bolster Vice
President Al Gore's presidential bid and the
Democratic drive to capture Congress. They
promised to fatten the plan's tax cuts, trim its
spending boosts and ignore its tax increases.
"It has all things for everyone they feel
they'll need to get Al Gore elected president,"
said I louse Budget Committee Chairman
John kasicli, R-Ohio, who called it"the presi
dent's fantasy budget."
"I look forward to working with the presi
dent in putting together a serious spending
proposal," said Senate Budget Committee
Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M. "But this is
a document designed to help Al Gore win

election."
There was little denying presidential poli
tics at the White I louse, where officials said at
least a dozen Core proposals were latticed into
the outline. But beyond that, Clinton's
farewell spending blueprint — for fiscal 2001,
beginning Oct. I —was an effort to choose the
terrain of this year's budget battle.
Clinton proposed $351 billion in tax cuts
through 2010 that he argues can only be
enlarged 'by*'' Eroding Social Sec'i'iritVY trust
funds, (efforts to expand and strength
en Medicare, or slashing other popular initia
tives such as hiring teachers or reducing the
national debt.
"This budget, in short, makes really strong
and significant steps toward achieving the
great goals that I believe America should pur
sue in this new century," Clinton told
reporters.
Republicans said that at a time of surplus,
taxpayers should get a bigger break than Clin
ton wants to give them.
They criticized his proposal to raise other
revenues by $181 billion over 10 years, includ
ing higher taxes on cigarettes and some cor
porate transactions. And they noted that using
(Clinton's own figures, there would be a net $9
billion tax increase in 2001 and a $1 billion
increase in 2002 before annual lax cuts begin
to outweigh increases.
"Let me be very clear: This Congress will
not raise taxes," said House Majority Leader
Die k Armey, R-Texas.
Strikingly, the president's budge boasted

few initiatives that lit' has not proposed before.
Among the new ones was a $91 billion, 10-
year effort to expand health coverage for
working poor families. Ii is aimed at covering
5 million of the 44 million Americans who lack
health insurance.
Ik* also called for setting aside $35 billion,
beginning in 200(5, for extra prescription drug
coverage lor the sickest Medicare patients.
1 his is on top of a $160 billion, 10-year plan
'for ptbst'ription benefits lor Medicate
patients',' similar tW'liia 'jbropositlbf ybaV
that Congress ignored.
Clinton also proposed extra spending to
help farmers deal with low commodities
prices; about the same $278 billion Pentagon
budget as this year; and extra money to buy
park lands, modernize schools and hire new
federal agents and prosecutors who focus on
gun laws.
In one area of bipartisan agreement, the
president would set aside the $2.17 trillion
Social Security surplus over the next decade
for debt reduction.
By 2013, he said, the $3.7 trillion portion of
the national debt should be gone for the first
time since 1835, which economists say should
lower interest rates and add muscle to the
economy. The rest of the $5.7 trillion national
debt is money in federal trust funds such as
Social Security.
Clinton estimates that over the next 10
years, there will be a $740 billion surplus in
the rest of the budget — a figure that will be
pivotal in this year's fiscal light.
