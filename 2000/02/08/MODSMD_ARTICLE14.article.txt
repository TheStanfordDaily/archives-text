With an astonishing comeback to
win the Pebble Beach National
Pro-Am yesterday, I iger Woods
moved a sn-j> closer to Byron Nel
son's "untouchable" record ol I I
straight victories.
Seven strokes behind with seven
holes to play, Woods electrified an
otherwise gray afternoon on the
Monterey Peninsula by holing a
97-yard wedge lor eagle on the
15th and making birdies on two of
the last three holes for his sixth
straight PGA lour victory.
Woods became the first player
since Ben I logan in 1948 to win six
straight tour events and took an
unbelievable leap closer to Nel
son's record, which was set in 1915.
It was a command perfor

mance, filled with spectacular shots
that have defined Woods' young
but spectacular career. It ended
with Woods watching from the
I(Sth green as Matt Gogel missed a
l()-lbot birdie putt on the 1 Sth that
would have forced a playoff.
Woods closed with an 8-uncler
04, the lowest final round by a
champion in the 53-year history of
I'ebble Beach, lie finished at 15-
uncler 273 and eai ned $720,000.
"I figured if I birdied the last
four holes, I might have a chance,"
Woods s;iid.
It was the 17th career PGA
four victory for the 24-year-old
Woods. Among active players not
on the Senior lour, only Ben
