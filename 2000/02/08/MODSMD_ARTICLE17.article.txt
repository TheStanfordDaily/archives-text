## The 						Stanford Daily SME core's disorganization hurts student interest 
### 
Published Since 1891

The science, mathematics
and Engineering Core seemed to
be a great idea on paper. Take a
group of fuzzies, put them in a
class team-taught by world-class faculty
and introduce them to a wide range of sci
entific and mathematical principles. All of
this, of course, is done with an inter-disci
plinary approach that makes the concepts
more engaging and interesting for the
fuzzy-minded student.
The solution to a fuzzy's woes? Sadly,
no. In the fourth year of the program,
SME has suffered from low enrollment
rates, and, due to the lack of interest, has
been forced this year to cancel two of its
three tracks. The remaining track, Light,
has survived, perhaps for reasons that the
rest of the program can draw and learn
from.
SME's biggest initial selling point was its

so-called interdisciplinary approach — a
concept that had already caught on like
wild fire when the program was intro
duced in 1996. Inter-disciplinary majors
such as International Relations, Earth Sys
tems and Symbolic Systems were already
very popular among students, mainly
because the programs included a sam
pling of different classes from various dis
ciplines. SME modeled itself after such
programs, so that, for example, the Earth
track would not only include geology
lessons, but also a smattering of genetics,
statistical analysis and theories of evolu
tion. Once again, solid on paper, but not so
in practice.
The main failing in SME was that it did
not focus on a central area of study, as
other inter-disciplinary majors do. While
there seems to be a "theme," as the one
word titles such as "Earth" and "Heart"

indicate, there is little cohesion and even
less connection to the course's theme on a
week-to-week basis.
SME students complained of a disjoint
ed and disorganized course curriculum,
one in which during week one, statistics
would be the topic du jour, and then in
week two, genetics would take center
stage. To make matters worse, different
professors, albeit experts in their fields,
would hand off the class when their
lessons were over, thereby exacerbating
the sense of discontinuity. Even world
renowned faculty cannot be expected to
teach their subject well, along with holding
together all the different course subjects
taught in the weeks preceding.
Granted, the faculty tried hard to create
that crucial sense of cohesion. Professors
attended each other's lectures, met on a
regular basis to do curriculum updates,

worked their colleagues' subjects into their
own lectures. But even with all that talent
and effort, a focal point can't be created
when there isn't one to begin with. How
can students be expected to link the study
of genetics to geology when there was no
central point to relate these subjects to.'
"Earth" as that central point is all well and
good but is undeniably a broad topic to be
relating the precise calculations of hybrid
cross-pollination to.
SME wasn't inter-disciplinary in the
true nature of the word. It strove to cover
too much breadth in an attempt to intro
duce humanities students to basic scientif
ic and mathematical concepts. What
resulted was a hodge-podge of unlinked
and often, very basic, concepts that didn't
give humanities students the strong tech
nical grounding the program promised to

give. 11 lis, perhaps, was its biggest failing
— students who may have already had a
weak science background or harbored a
dislike for the subject material left SME
with those feelings intact.
Students of the Light track say that
their class seemed to avoid those pitfalls
that plagued the other tracks. A sense of
course continuity, those students say, was
established through close connections
between various concepts and a focus sur
rounding the physics of light. Perhaps
SME programmers need to re-evaluate
their foci, choosing studies that aren't as
broad as "Earth," and also realize that not
everything about science and math can be
taught in a year. The curriculum list for
Earth and Heart should be tightened,
with more emphasis given to important

topics, to ensure that at least students are
learning certain concepts well, rather
than many peripherally.
The failure or success of SME means
many things for undergraduate education
here, especially as the University seems to
increasingly place the spotlight on its bur
geoning technical majors, as well as the
student start-up success stories that
emerge from the techie side of campus.
The divide between the humanities and
sciences is an ever-deepening one, partic
ularly at an institution that is sitting in the
heart of the Silicon Valley. SME acts as an
effort to bridge that gap, and it's an
important endeavor that should be sup
ported, even though its track record has
been less than stellar. The idea of teaching
math and science in a humanities-friendly
way is again, a good one in principle. SME
organizers should be given a second
chance to re-evaluate their curriculum,
teaching style and program, so that it
hopefully can become a course humani
ties students can enjoy and gain from.
