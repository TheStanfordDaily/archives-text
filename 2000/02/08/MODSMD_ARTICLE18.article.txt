# FRAM LIFE
## The 						importance of introductions 
### CHRIS MALONEY STAFF COLUMNIST 
When I found out I'd made "The Cut"
and was now one of the new weekly
Opinions columnists, they told me 1
could use one of my two sample columns
since it was rather short notice. At first
that sounded fine — a million articles to
read for Kcon, an essay for Swahili, and of
course a Poli Sci midterm on Monday —
all elements that made me think that'd be
the best course of action.
Or not.
I'he point is, if I'm going to be giving
you my beef on "whatever" (apparently
that's how much free reign they've given
me here, so watch out), I feel obliged to
somehow help you get to know me first.
In Africa you never start any dialogue —
from a cashier to your prof — without
proper introductions.
Ironic as it sounds, being caught up in
the hustle and bustle (the Swahili say fnli
ka-pilikti) of life "on the Farm," I wonder
how many possible friendships and con
nections I've missed — all because I never
simply introduced myself. Hence, this
first column.
For starters, call me Chris. I'm six-five
and majoring in Eton and African/Afro-
American Studies. I travel often, and I
love to drive and bike everywhere. Watch
out when you see that black Wrangler
with the "Lekker9" plates (that's South
African slang for "cool") — because
there's a New Yorker behind the wheel,
and he's still learning the art of stopping
for pedestrians.
Like every other New Yorker here, I
enjoy talking about how superior New
York is, despite the fact that I'm on Cali
fornia turf and much prefer the sunny (or
torrentially rainy) life here to the 26
degrees and snow there.
I also like long walks on the beach and
perky blondes. (Ah, testing the bounds of
The Daily right from the start). Sorry if
you take offense — I promise, I'm not a
misogynist, but I thought I'd be honest
here.
I love African culture and issues
(hence the double-major), something that
seems to make people do a double-take
(along with my professed fascination with
inacroeconomic policy) when they hear
this tall, skinny white guy mention it.
I never was pre-med and I've yet to
figure out the lure of Computer Science
and start-ups, so I apologize ahead of
time. I also consider myself shy, which,
considering this column, may come as a
surprise. There's a lot more to me than

this, but we've got upwards of fifteen
weeks together,-*) no worries.
Each week will he a look at a different,
random facet of life on the Farm. The
point is to convey something you may or
may not have noticed with an attempt —
note keyword: "attempt" (so feel free to
disagree) — to make it as humorous as
possible.
Back to intros. They're important —
how much more do we like that prof who
was willing to waste the entire period by
having everyone stand up, state their
name and major? Many of you are saying,
"Ah, I HATE it when they do that!" but
think about it — it says a lot. Learning is a
group effort of students and professors
(and sometimes even TAs); the individual
work that goes into it is just one part.
Mius, that simple act of stating one's
name is a commitment by us all to the
start of a new relationship — maybe 011
just the most superficial of levels, but a
relationship nonetheless. That is part of
the reason why I felt it necessary to begin
my column this way. Like it or not, you
are now my acquaintance. Congratula
tions.
That random person sitting next to
you who at the start of lecture said,
"Dude, can 1 borrow a pen?" 1 hat person
who just searched your book-bag at
(ireen, and even the person who swipes
your card at dinner every day. Who are
these people?
Answering the question of "who am
I?" may be relegated to 1-Hum, but ask
ing the question of "who are you?" is one
we all should ask every day. President
Casper basically asks this question with
his famous "hello's" to the random stu
dents he passes each day. Maybe we
should start taking the hint.
So lean over and help that person sit
ting next to you in lecture solve the cross
word with the pen he or she's just bor
rowed from you. You can learn about sta
tistical hypothesis testing later; this
chance to possibly meet someone new
and learn more about those in your "Uni
versity Community" (man that has to be
the most trite cliche) could be passing you
by.
I say, introduce yourself, and make the
most of the pilika-pilika we live in. It's only
a start, and, like this column, there will be
oh-so-much more to come. Just wait.

Chris can be reached at cmaloney@leland.
Presently, you can find him demanding
Reserve books from (Ween for his Political Sci
ence class until he gets a grip again after
midterms.
