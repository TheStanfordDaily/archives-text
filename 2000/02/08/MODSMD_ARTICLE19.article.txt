More about "malaise"
Vincent James Strickler's letter was
excellent at denouncing the duplicity of
Reeds's and Schmidt's pro-abortion
advertisement in the Feb. 3 Daily. This
column was a shameless, free, 700-word
advertisement for Stanford Students For
Choice. It seems only fair that The Daily
will give me equal space to promote my
group, Stanford Students For Life.
We don't always have "scrumptious
snacks," partially because it makes us sick
to have to discuss things like Partial Birth
Abortion, which involves delivering a
baby until just its head remains in the
mother (if it were delivered fully, some
crazy anti-choicers might think it was
murder), then puncturing the skull and
vacuuming out the baby's brain.
Before joining Stanford Students For
Life, you might not learn that "choice"
means ripping apart unborn children, or
burning them to death with salt solutions.
You might not realize that because
women have complete reproductive free
dom, men have no responsibility for their
sexual choices and, consequently, treat
women like sexual objects whose "condi

tions" (pregnancies) can be treated by
killing the child, with or without any
input from the man, who should take
equal responsibility for his actions.
Reeds and Schmidt talk about taking
their rights for granted. If they actually
saw that a fetus was just a small human
being, and then realized that every year,
1.5 million, or one third of these sentient,
fragile humans were killed, maybe they
wouldn't take their own lives for granted.
I have to admit, Stanford Students For
Life is probably not as fun as Stanford
Students For Choice. Sure we do produc
tive community service activities such as
clothing drives for the Crisis Pregnancy
Center, but we just don't have the same
rhetoric.
The Nazis had the "final solution" to
the "Jewish problem," the Southern gen
tly had their "peculiar institution" of slav
ery, and the abortion lobbyists have
"choice," "procedures," "clumps of tis
sue," and others.
Most people rightfully believe that a
man doesn't have the right to choose
what to do with his body if it involves rap
ing a woman. They understandably think

it's wrong for a mother to strangle a new
born, or strap her children into a car,
then push that car into a lake.
Yet somehow, Stanford Students For
Choice thinks that by supporting the
killing of millions of unborn children sec
onds, minutes or weeks before they're
born, they're "building a community. . .
with a sense of humor." Murder of
unborn children for profit, objectification
