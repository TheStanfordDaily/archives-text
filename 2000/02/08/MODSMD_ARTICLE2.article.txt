# Blood Center addresses concerns about donor policy in new brochure

### ANNE CORTINA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As a new wave of blood drives
sweeps across campus, the effects
of last quarter's homophobia de
bate linger.
Though gay males are still pro
hibited from donating blood, the
Stanford Medical School Blood
Center has introduced a more de
tailed explanatory pamphlet lor
donors, and the center's adminis
trative director is attempting to
have the issue recognized at the na
tional level.
The questionnaire given out by
the Blood Center states that any
man who has had sex with another
man since 1977 is unable to give
blood; during the fall blood drive,
students voiced concerns over
these restrictions.
This immediately struck a
chord with freshman Lyndon Gill,
who spearheaded a movement to
look into what he deemed the ho
mophobic policies of the Blood
Center.
"We didn't realize that it was an

FDA regulation that they have to
give out this question," Gill said.
Gill contacted the Blood Center,
which held a forum to discuss the
issue. Officials informed students
that Stanford must conform to
FDA policies on blood donation,
which can only be changed at the
national level.
Upon being contacted by Gill,
Vince Yalon, administrative direc
tor of the Stanford Medical School
Blood Center, took up the cause
himself.
"[This is] the first time the stu
dents decided they wanted to do
something about this," Yalon said.
In the past, both corporate groups
and private donors, which con
tribute 85% of all blood donated,
have questioned the regulation.
Yalon t(K)k the issue to a nation
al level, using Dr. Eric Goosby, a
former administrator of the HIV
program at San Francisco General
Hospital and' now an employee of
the Department of Health and
Human Services, as an ally.
