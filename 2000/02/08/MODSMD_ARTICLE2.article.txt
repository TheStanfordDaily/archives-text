# Blood Center addresses concerns about donor policy in new brochure
## 
### ANNE CORTINA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As a new wave of blood drives
sweeps across campus, the effects
of last quarter's homophobia de
bate linger.
Though gay males are still pro
hibited from donating blood, the
Stanford Medical School Blood
Center has introduced a more de
tailed explanatory pamphlet lor
donors, and the center's adminis
trative director is attempting to
have the issue recognized at the na
tional level.
The questionnaire given out by
the Blood Center states that any
man who has had sex with another
man since 1977 is unable to give
blood; during the fall blood drive,
students voiced concerns over
these restrictions.
This immediately struck a
chord with freshman Lyndon Gill,
who spearheaded a movement to
look into what he deemed the ho
mophobic policies of the Blood
Center.
"We didn't realize that it was an

FDA regulation that they have to
give out this question," Gill said.
Gill contacted the Blood Center,
which held a forum to discuss the
issue. Officials informed students
that Stanford must conform to
FDA policies on blood donation,
which can only be changed at the
national level.
Upon being contacted by Gill,
Vince Yalon, administrative direc
tor of the Stanford Medical School
Blood Center, took up the cause
himself.
"[This is] the first time the stu
dents decided they wanted to do
something about this," Yalon said.
In the past, both corporate groups
and private donors, which con
tribute 85% of all blood donated,
have questioned the regulation.
Yalon t(K)k the issue to a nation
al level, using Dr. Eric Goosby, a
former administrator of the HIV
program at San Francisco General
Hospital and' now an employee of
the Department of Health and
Human Services, as an ally.
Yalon organized a forum with
Goosby, scientists and governmen
tal representatives last week. The
meeting had to be postponed due
to unforeseen circumstances.
"[Goosby isj personable. He's
caring, and 1 think he's going to get
back to us," Yalon said. "Meeting
with Goosby was a breakthrough,
and I think this is just a temporary
setback."
Other groups have attempted to

bring the issue to the national level,
but Congress and (he FDA have
been unwilling to listen. The ques
tion eliminating gay males was
written in the mid 1980s, when
much less was known about HIV
and its transmission, according to
Yalon. Modern knowledge could
alter the wording of the question,
so that it tonuses on statistic ally
proven risky behavior.
Goosby's sympathetic ear is a
valuable tool lor those who are in
terested in revisiting the wording
of the question.
"No one has had any success in
getting the I DA to reconsider this

issue," Yalon said. "We saw this as
an opening."
Meanwhile, Yalon and Gill
have been working to improve the
situation on campus. The fruit of
their labor is a revised pamphlet
available to donors explaining the
necessity of the questions and
Stanford's inability to change
them.
"We came to the conclusion
that, though we couldn't change
the questionnaire, we'd create our
own supplemental pamphlet," (>ill
said.
Until the issue is brought to the
federal level, no more can be done.

Yalon and Gill urge concerned stu
dents to write to their (longression
al representatives and the FDA.
"Congress needs to hear from
their constituents," said Yalon.
"The brochure is going to state
who you can write to or e-mail if
you have issues with any of the
questions."
For now, though, Stanford stu
dents and the Stanford Medical
School Blood Center must comply
with federal standards.
"It's important to understand
that the real purpose of the Blood
Center is to get blood to people
who need it," said Gill.
