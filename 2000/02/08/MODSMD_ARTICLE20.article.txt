# New Daily making progress
## 
### 
1 lie new style and font of The Daily is
energetic, upbeat and user-friendly. I
think everyone can agree it's a fine depar
ture from the high school newspaper feel
of the old Daily.
At issue now seems to be the substance
of the new Daily. I have worked and writ
ten for a lot of different newspapers, and
when 1 say that the transformation of The
Daily (not only in style, but also in con
tent) is revolutionary, I do not exaggerate.
It is not simply the subtitle "Peninsu
la's Oldest Morning Newspaper," but the

inclusion every day of one or two local
articles ("List of new school sites nar
rowed," Feb. 3) that have relevance to
students and faculty also adds credibility.
The Daily has also begun to add rele
vant campus news that doesn't actually
take place on campus ("Tropical winds
blow sailing team to impressive finish,"
Feb. 1) — something that was virtually
non-existent in the old Daily.
Other subtleties that may not catch
one's eye are everywhere. The top half Of
the newspaper has the most relevant sto
ries, accentuated with one nice graphic to
catch the eye junlike the old Daily which
would often have an entire picture and
only one headline above the fold.
Although a couple of issues have been
thin, having a few articles and mostly
advertisements is not a crime. If this was
the case, The Los Angeles Times would
have been arrested a long time ago.
Slow news days are a fact of journalism
life. We should be more thankful that the
copy editors have learned to be better
space managers. The quantity of blank
space — an eye sore to any self respecting
paper — is decreasing.
The issues covered in the past week
have also been the most diverse I have
ever seen in The Daily. In the past three
days alone, six stories have been written
on minority interest and many others on
other interest groups on campus.
Aside from the "Gore 2000" emblem

mishap on the front page, The Daily is
the most unbiased I have seen it in recent
years. Objectivity is the only measure if a
good newspaper.
Ledes have been written better. News
ledes have a newsy, "get to the point" feel
(as they should), while other, less hard
hitting stories have softer leads. Even the
jumps (where the caption tells yon to fol
low the story inside) is cut off at more
interesting points, encouraging the read
er to follow. (Whether that js the skill or
luck of the copy editors, 1 don't know).
The opinions page has done away with
those silly 26-graph columns about the
how bad the food is at Late Night and has
focused on issues that the opinion colum
nists actually care about. That is where
good copy on the opinion page starts.
And that is why the quality of opinion let
ters has increased.
I wrote for The Daily last year, but the
overall incompetence and incredibly bad
copy that was consistently put out forced
me to quit. Mow could 1 put my name on
something that was so absolutely ama
teurish it became inconsequential?
Although The Daily now is far from
perfect, its efforts at increased accuracy
and objectivity, as well as to be as infor
mative and entertaining as possible, has
forced me to contemplate writing again.
