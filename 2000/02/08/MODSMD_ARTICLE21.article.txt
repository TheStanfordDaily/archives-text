# Movies meet Silicon Valley

You've seen the special effects in "Titanic" and
"Toy Story" — now you can learn how they were
made. This Friday night, Academy Award-winning
special effects artists Ed Catmull (co-founder of
PIXAR) and Rob Legato (who worked on " Titanic"
and "Apollo 13") will speak at Stanford as part of a two
day Presidential Lecture Series Symposium titled
"Special Effects."
The symposium aims to create relationships be
tween humanists and engineers while examining spe
cial effects in the media. The speakers will use a vari
ety of film dips to illustrate their talks in the sympo
sium.
" This will be interesting intellectually and visceral
ly," said Matt Tiews, a master's student in Compara
tive Literature, who has worked on the logistical coor
dination of the symposium. There will be film clips;
it's very different from normal academic colloquia."
I'he event's coordinator, Hans Gumbrecht, hopes
the symposium will attract people from both engi
neering and the humanities, as well as people from the
non-academic community.
"Stanford is the only place where such a combina
tion can work," Gumbrecht said. "I honestly think this
type of thing has never happened before."
Planning for this symposium, which is the last in a
series of four, began in January 1998.
"We wanted to get a new type of interdisciplinary
work here," Gumbrecht said. "'The humanists say, 'We
are so repressed here,' so we wanted each side to help
one another."
At least 20 speakers will speak during five panels,
which will feature short lectures and then discussion.

In addition to Friday's lecture, titled "State of the Art,"
Saturday's panels will include talks about "Morphing,"
"Globalization as Special Effect" and "Black I loles."
The Saturday panel includes Film Studies Prof. Vivian
Sobchack, Marshall Monroe, who is a Stanford alum
ni, a I )isney Imagineering Studios veteran, and Astro
physics Prof. Roger Romani. »
"Saturday morning will address how morphing
changes reality," Tiews said. "Saturday afternoon will
look at the broader conception of special effects that go
on in the universe."
Tiews said at first fie thought it would be difficult to
"break into the film industry" to get speakers, but
when he and his committee started explaining the
purpose of the project, people became excited about
it. Gumbrecht added that he was surprised by the ea
gerness of many members of the Silicon Valley.
" They said they had been thinking about this (in
terdisciplinary work] a lot," Tiews said. " They were
really excited about it; people started to call us to come
talk to people."
The original idea for these symposia was to develop
working interdisciplinary relationships and identify
questions that are interesting for both humanists and
engineers and scientists.
Gumbrecht said the other three symposia, which
have each addressed questions about the relationship
between the humanities and the sciences, athletics and
law, respectively, have "worked out beautifully with
the other."
The symposium, which is free to the public, begins
with an introduction on Fri., Feb. I 1 at 9:30 a.m. in the
Cantor Arts Center. Lectures will continue from 10 to
12:30 p.m. and from 2:30 to 5 p.m. Friday's lecture,
which is from 7:30 to 10:30 p.m. will be held in Gates
801.
