## Nevada ends Cardinal's Sunken Diamond streak 
### TIM KANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Perhaps it was fatigue. Perhaps it was
not having one of its top three pitchers
starting. Perhaps it was just getting out
played.
Whatever the case, the Stanford base
ball team just wasn't itself Monday after
noon, losing 4-3 to Nevada at Sunken Di
amond. snapping a 19-game home win
ning streak and ending a bid for a perfect
season. George Moran( 1-1) picked up the
win lor the Wolfpack, while Dan Rich (0-1)
took the loss for the (Cardinal.
Nevada did most of the damage in the
top of the sixth inning, scoring three runs
oil Rid), who was making his first appear
ance of the season. Left fielder Matt Orti/
provided the big hit lor the Wolfpack,
tripling oil the top of the left field lence to
drive in two runs and give Nevada <i 3-1
lead. Orti/ would later score on a wild
pitch by Rich.
"I thought the) played better than we
did," Stanford head coach Mark Marquess
said. "I thought they did a great job pitch
ing, and got some timek hitting. I don't
think it was a situation where we played
poorly. We just didn't do niudi with the
bat, and I think it's ;i credit to their pitch
er."
Marquess was certainly correct about
not doing much with the bat. In its previ

oils live games, Stanford averaged nearly
six and ;i hall'runs per contest, but against
Nevada die Cardinal was unable to get
much out of its eight hits, leaving nine men
on base.
Much of that can be attributed to Neva
da starter Bryan Schultz, who gave Neva
da head coach (iary Powers live innings of
three-hit baseball. Senior third baseman
John C >all did manage to smack a solo
home run to right field in the fourth in
ning, but that was the only mistake Schultz
made.
Mike YVodnicki drew the start on the
mound lor the Cardinal, as Jason Young
pitched Friday and needed to rest his arm.
Wodnicki, who usually comes out of the
bullpen lor Stanford, managed to keep
the Wollpack in check for live innings, al
lowing four hits but no runs while striking
out three.
Marquess lilted Wodnicki lor Rich in
the top of the sixth inning, during which
Rich gave up three hits and walked three
batters.
"Tliev got the three runs oil* of Rich,"
Marquess said. "It was a situation where
they earned it. We didn't make errors, or
watch a hunch of guys in — they hit the
ball. From a coaching standpoint, I can
live with that a little bit more than walking
them or giving it to them."
Mike (iosling took over lor Rich in the
seventh and surrendered an RBI double

to center fielder Joe Inglett to put Nevada
up 4-1. The Wollpack would continue to
threaten with runners at second and third
and one out, but Gosling retired the next
two batters on a line out and a grounder to
get out of trouble.
With an offense as capable as Stan
ford's, no lead should be considered safe,
and sure enough the Cardinal started to
chip away at the three run margin in the
eighth.
Shortstop Eric Brundett led of! the in
ning with a single to left field, after which
center fielder Edmund Muth walked to
bring right fielder Joe Borchard to the
plate. Borchard proceeded to hit into a
fielder's choice, forcing Muth at second.
Gall got his second RBI of the game
when he rapped a sharp grounder that hit
Moran hard in the leg but managed to
score Bruntlett from third anyway.
Stanford defeated Gal State-Eullerton
in dramatic fashion Friday night in the
bottom of the ninth inning at Sunken Dia
mond, so Cardinal fans knew the game
wasn't over quite yet. Second baseman
And) Topham, not known for his b;it,
doubled down the right field line with one
out in the ninth with Stanford down 4-2.
After (Iraig Thompson llied out to ( en

in one. Mutli dug in at the plate with
two outs and a chance to win the
game for Stanford.
Muth took a big swing, and
crushed the ball deep to right, but
light fielder Chris Nickerson bad
enough room, and just like that
Stanford's pei feet record went up in
smoke.
The Cardinal won't have much
time to dwell on its defeat, as the
team leaves on Thursday to begin a
three-game series witb Florida State
— the same Florida State that
knocked Stanfi»rd out of the (College
World Series last June by beating
the Cardinal two games in a row.
