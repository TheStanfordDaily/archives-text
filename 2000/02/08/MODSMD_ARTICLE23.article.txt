# Five seconds of fame
## A
						longtime benchwarmer offers his admiration for Stanford's resident walk-on, Alex Gelbard 
### 
Alex Gelbard sat at the Pauley Pavilion scorer's
table for what seemed like an eternity, watching
the seconds tick away on the chance of a lifetime.
Finally, the ball flew out of bounds. A referee
blew his whistle. (>elbard stepped onto the court.
Five seconds later, the game ended.
Most fans probably didn't even notice the (>-
foot-3 senior from F.A.'s I larvard-Westlake, a high
school teammate of Cardinal stars larron and

Jason Collins. His stint in the
game was so short, so seemingly
insignificant.
Except, of course, to those of
us who've been there, at the
scorer's table, praying that the
game won't end before the next
dead ball.
Gelbard is a walk-on, the lone
non-scholarship player on a
team of former touted recruits
and future pro stars. I he Stan-

ford media guide calls him "a fundamentally
sound player" and "a valuable reserve on the Car
dinal varsity" who "will bring leadership on an ofl
the court."
Translation: If you see him in the game, it's
been over for a while.
It's easy to bag on Gelbard, the guy who comes
in with a minute to go and starts chut king up shots
to the Sixth Man's delight. But if you do, you miss

a big part of what makes amateur basketball so
great.
Gelbard has held a Stanford walk-on spot for
three years — and unlike his peers, his tuition isn't
paid for. Teammates say he works hard in practice,
and he's the first one off the bench when a Stan
ford player scores or makes a good play on de
fense.
Kvery college team in the country has walk-ons.
A lot of them are like Alex Gelbard: work hard in
practice, first off the bench, "fundamentally
sound." But few of them balance hoops practice
with medical school applications. And few of them
are so content with their roles.
"Practice is an important part of basketball,"
Gelbard said. "Most of the fans don't see it. My job
every day is to make sure everyone else is on the
top of their games in practice.
"I definitely feel like an integral part of the
team."
Maybe that's what makes Gelbard so popular
with most Stanford fans.
There is, however, a small sector of fans that
does more than root for Gelbard. We feel for him.
It's a group made up of past-life benchwarm
ers, the guys in high school who brought the
starters water, cheered a little too loud, waved
towels. We left the court each night with thin, di
agonal red streaks on our legs from leaning for
ward in our seats, forearms pressed against
thighs.
We lived for practice and the ends of games, for
those rare moments — usually seconds — when
the coach turned to us and said, "Hey you, get in
there," and we peeled off our warm-up shirts and
jogged casually to the scorer's table, trying to look

like we'd been there before.
Road games were the toughest. I lie rides were
long, the crowds hostile, the games tighter, the
chances of getting in slimmer. When we did get in
(and if you were like me, it was always when your

Alex Gelbard gets down on defense earlier this year
against Washington State. The senior walk-on
snapped a three-game streak when he did not play Sat
urday at USC.
