### KATIE FITZPATRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
One of the top gymnastics teams in
the country overpowered No. 9 Stan
ford (4-2,2-2 Pacific 10 Conference) last
weekend.
In Los Angeles, No. 5 UCIA (7-4, !i
-0) beat the Cardinal in a women's gym
nastics duel by a score of 197.8-1 93.725.
After a series of very successful home
competitions, the (Cardinal was back on
the road. The Cardinal was no match
for UCIA on a night when the Bruins
set two school records and 16 individual
career-highs.
For the Cardinal, the meet against

the national powerhouse in a hostile en
vironment was a great experience and
an excellent way to prepare for postsea
son competition.
"It wasa good test to compete against
the best team in the country," said se
nior All-American Larissa Fontaine.
Stanford gymnasts began the meet
with a shaky start on uneven bars, where
they had two falls in the rotation. Junior
Jennifer Kxaltacion got the Cardinal out
of the gate, hitting her routine for a 9.8.
Fontaine added a 9.75 and freshman
Alissa Cooper contributed a 9.7. All-
American Sarah Harding was the top
scorer for the Cardinal, with an impres
sive 9.825, tying her career-high.
The Cardinal traveled to vault,
where they had a "terrific rotation," ac
cording to I larding.
In what was perhaps a preview to the
N( ,AA vaulting finals, Fontaine scored a
9.9 to share the vaulting title with two

Bruins, I leidi Moneymaker and Mohini
Bhardwaj. Moneymaker is the defend
ing NCAA vault champion, a title she
stole Irom Fontaine, who was the 1998
champion.
Other high scorers for the Cardinal
included freshmen Kelsey Stillinger
(9.7) and Ahhy (lair (9.725). Kxaltacion
stuck her vault, earning her a 9.85.
On floor, the Cardinal began rocky
and recorded two falls hut was saved by
strong routines in the remainder of the
lineup. Sophomore Kristin Jensen con
tributed a solid 9.7 routine with nearly
flawless tumbling. Kxaltacion and Maid
ing both hit and were awarded 9.775 for
their efforts. Fontaine led the Cardinal
with a 9.875.
'Fhe Cardinal finished the meet on
beam, where it encountered some prob
lems. Stanford had falls in three other
wise flawless routines. "We just didn't
hit," Fontaine said.

Sophomore Beck\ Meldruin contin
ued her streak of opening up the beam
rotation with a solid and confident per
formance to score a 9.75 (>aii added a
9.()5, while sophomore Kat\ llerbeit,
the 1999 Regional beam co-champion,
contributed a 9.775.

"We have to develop our (onlidcnt c
to the point where we can compete aw a\
and at home with pride and consisten
cy," I larding said.
Fellow co-captain Fontaine agreed.
"We need to be more aggiessive on I In
road," she said.
"Seeing I CI.A was reallx motivating.
