(lonsider it a mission accomplished.
The Stanford men's and women's track
teams met all their goals this weekend as they
competed in the Air Force Quadrangular in
Colorado.
1 lie Stanford women finished third with 134
points behind 112 irst place Oklahoma (150 points),
and the men finished fourth with 99 points to
first place Colorado State (151 points) in the
meet where individual performance was sought
over team placement.
"In the indoor season, we don't pay attention
to team score," said Cardinal head coach Vin
I ananna. "We wanted a good meet, not too far
away, and with some good competition, and we
got it."

Despite traveling without many of its tradi
tional point scorers, the men's team placed first
in three individual events, all on the field.
The Cardinal saw a winning performance
from senior captain Toby Stevenson, who pole
vaulted 17 feet, 8 1/2 inches, a provisionally
qualifying mark. Sophomore Chris Sprague
won the shot put with a throw of 57-3 1/2. Ju
niors 1 odd Beyerlein and Ray Bergstrom went
1-2 in high jump with jumps of (>-10 3/4 and 6-6
3/4, respectively.
I'he sprint and hurdle squads were helped
by the eflbrtsof junior Leroy Sims in two events.
Sims performed well in the 60-meter dash (6.98
seconds) and the 200-meter dash (22.36). Ju
nior Michael 1 larte also placed third in the 60-
meter Inn dies with a time of 8.16.
"For the women, it was even better," Lanan
na said. "[KathleenJ Donoghue had a break
through meet. It was also a really super day for
Flena Villai real who ran a great time, especially
considering the- altitude. The 4x400 [meter
relay] competed very well, and Shannon Overly
did a great job, also."
The women's team captured seven individ

ual events and qualified two athletes by NCAA
standards. Sophomore Main ica Carlucci ran to
a first-place finish in the 800-meter run with a
time of 2:13.08. (unior Elena Villarreal won
both the mile and 3,000-meter runs with times
of 5:01 in the mile and 10:18.37 in the 3,000.
The mile relay team also finished first with its
3:49.89.
I he pole vault provided both the provisional
NCAA qualifiers: Kathleen Donoghue and
Melissa Feinstein turned in vaults of 12-6 1/4
and 12-1 1/2 respectively. The duo took the first
two spots in the event. Shannon Overly won the
triple jump with a leap of 37-1 1/4, and Maureen
Onyeagbako took the weight throw with a toss of
55-6 1/2.
"We only took 14 athletes to compete in 19
events," Lananna said. "Even then, we still al
most won the meet. I am very pleased with the
performance, and think it was very productive."
I 'he men's and women's teams will continue
the indoor season next weekend, when the
Cardinal will travel to Arkansas for the Razor
back Invitational in the biggest meet of season
so far.
