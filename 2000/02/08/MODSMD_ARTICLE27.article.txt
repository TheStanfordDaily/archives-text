## Science section now to include high tech 
### ALEX TUNG EDITORIAL STAFF 
And m> you came looking ibr the
Science section, and now you're
thinking, "What the heck is this?"
Well, following the redesign of
The Daily as a whole, the Science
section has undergone a lew alter
ations. As you may have noticed,
the section is now titled "Innova
tion" and lias been expanded to in
clude news on (urrent accomplish
ments in both s< ience and tec luiol
ogv. I lie distinction between the
two concepts mav seem blurry, but
we hope the ultimate result will be
dear.
Stanford has been instrumental
in shaping the growth and culture
of Silicon Valley, and the emer
gence ol useful, empowering tech
nology lias been at the heart ofthis
development. While "Innovation"
will continue to run broad-scope
science stories on developments in
medicine, space exploration and
the like, it will also loc us on Stan
lord's role in the Valley and how
students and professors have con
ti ibuted to this ever-growing indus
try ol inloi nialion.
flic section will host a number
ol renin ing thematic columns and
articles, in addition to an occasional
feature story.
Focal Point
Ibis column space will be re
served for discussion of issues that
are not pan < >112 the typical tec hnical
ly-oriented musings of the Valley. A
guest columnist — a student, pro
lessor 01 industry member — will
give his or liei views on the state ol
the industry today. I "he topics will
range from ethic a I issues to these ol

wealth being spread in the rest of
the Valley, why do communities
like Fast I'alo Alto continue to

iened the way we as Stanford stu
dents perceive the world around?
We invite anyone with opinions on
tec hnologv, the industry or Silicon
Valley as a whole to submit ideas.

Startup Spotlight
Don't know what to do after
graduation? Why not start a com
pany? That's how a lot ol Stanford
students are thinking these days,
and that's how so many companies
are loi inecl. We'll showcase the new
companies being boi n almost dail\
out of Stanford. We'll show compa
nies at thcil fledgling stages, discuss
w hat amount of ingenuit) it takes to
"clo a startup," and take a c lose look
at the students and prolessois who
put lorth these big ideas.
Eye on the Media
flic definition ol media is ever
growing, and the nunibei of ways
in which information is broadcast,
manipulated and generalh distrib
uted multiplies daily. I low does
one keep up with the dot-coms and
sort out .ill the livpe? In this part ol
the sec lion, we w ill review the latest
web services, software and inl< >nna
tion media. We'll compare differ
ent Internet services, critique Web
site interfaces and disc uss the value
and convenience of those gadgets
that are always getting faster, small
er and more complex.
Widgets and What/its
I o find so much of what is at the
cusp of new technology, we needn't
look much further than Campus
Drive. I bis section will be devoted
to exploring the clillerent researc li
labs on campus and reporting on
their ac tivities, 112 rom robotic s to ar
tificial intelligence to internal com
bustic>n engines, a host <»l new ideas
are about to change the world.
We hope these goals don't seem
too loftv or impossible to achieve,
and because this is a new section, we
will be counting on feedback from
c>ill readers on how to improve
these pages. We live in an exciting
and influential pait ol the world,
and its about time that we started
talking about it.
