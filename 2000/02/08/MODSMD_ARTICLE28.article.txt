Not main research scien
tists have tlicir work de
s( i ibed as "perfect mono
logue Ibcldei for fay Leno." But
to Andra Stinchcomb and ilie
American (lancer Society, the
development of a marijuana skin
patch to treat patients is serious
business.
Stint lieonib, an assistant pro
fessor at Albany College ol Phar
macy, New York, was recently
awarded a $'}(>!,000 grant to
help develop a skin patch that
will deliver marijuana the same
way a nicotine patch delivers low
levels of the nicotine through the
skin. However, while the pur
pose ol a nicotine patch is to
wean the user from cigarette
smoking, the "pot patch" has the
potential to alleviate nausea and
chronic pain in cancer sufferers..

Many c ancer patients current
ly take marijuana in capsule or
joint form to heat the nausea that
is a side effect of chemotherapy.
The drug also stimulates ap
petite and is used by AIDS pa
tients to ease the side effects of
their treatments.
But neither delivery form is
ideal, as nauseated patients are
often unable to lake oral treat
ments. I he patch would alleviate
this problem. In addition, ii
would deliver the treatment in
even, regular doses, while inhal
ing or swallowing produces an
initial positive effect thai quickly
wears off.
Marijuana is also said to be ef
fective in treating epilepsy, glau
coma and muscular spasticity
disorders. A recent study by the
Institute of Medicine recom
mended that canuabinoids, the
active ingredient in marijuana,
be subject to further study for

medical purposes.
Animal research indicates that
cannabinoids sti lie* pain directly
In interfering with pain signals
in the nervous system. In one
new study, researchers used a
special technology to analyze the
at tivitv of cells in the rostral ven
tromedial medulla (RYM). I he
cells in this hrain region increase
or decrease our level of pain per
ception. Cannabinoicl substances
activate the RVM cells that stop
pain signals and inactivate the
RVM cells that pump up pain
signals.
Stinchcomb has already re
ceived cjueries Irom potential pa
tients, but regrets that the patch
is liu Iroin developed. It will be
live years before clinical trials are
possible, and another five before
the patc h can be considered for
Food and Drug Administration
approval.
Currently, marijuana is a

Schedule I drug under the fed
eral Controlled Substances Act
and is defined as having "no ac
cepted medical use in treatment
in the United States."
Possession of Schedule I
drugs is illegal and the drugs in
Schedule I are available lor re
search purposes only. However,
Alaska, Arizona, California, Col
orado, Nevada, Oregon and
Washington do allow legal use of
marijuana after a patient proves
it would be medically beneficial.
Criticism of marijuana used
for medical purposes has
stemmed primarily from the
contention that alternative ther
apies exist that do not involve
controlled substances.
Whether the grant money
from the American Cancer Soci
ety signals a move toward more
widespread scientific and politi
cal acceptance for medical mari
juana remains to be seen.
