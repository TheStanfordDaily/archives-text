I lie Web site onhealth.com
claims that if you start slow and
work 111 > to biking l M) minutes in
duration at least three times a
week, you w ill give voursell a full
body workout.
|ac(|uie Phelan, founder of
Woman's Mountain bike and
Pea Society (WOMBATS), told

onhealth.com that to maximize
your cardiovascular benefits,
"You need to move your legs at
least twice as last as you would
during a brisk walk."
Many students have mountain
bikes that they only use lor the
smooth terrain between Wilbur
and the Quad, but this only exer
cises the lower body. Mountain
biking iu rougher areas gives
your uppei body and arms a
tough workout because you need
to balance to control the bike.
"Physically, you need more
power than you do when just cy
cling. It's a great lull-body work
out," said Dan Vandamis of the
International Mountain Bicv-

cling Associa
tion (I MBA)
in an inter

feels that a great misconception
of mountain biking is that one
must he "super-aggressive."
"You don't have to have a
'gonzo' personality to enjoy the
sport. You just need lo he some
one who's willing to try new
things," Vandamis said.
Junior Hubert Shill, an avid
cyclist, recommends Windy Hill,
a popular riding area off Alpine
Road.

"Not many students know that
we are in one of the prime areas
lor both road and mountain hik
ing," said Sliih.
" I his is the place to be if you
waul to explore some of the lesser
traveled roads by bike."
So next weekend, instead of
heading to the gym or to the
practice fields, take your moun
tain bike and head oil to the
trails!
