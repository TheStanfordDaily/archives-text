# Bio-X to bridge boundaries, roads
## James H. Clark Center to arch over Campus Drive by Medical School

Bio-X: an ideal name for an immense project at
Stanford, linking biology with other disciplines, not
just intellectually, but also physically, with a bridge or
underpass crossing Campus Drive.
A $150 million endowment from former Comput
er Science Prof. Jim Clark might make this bridge a
reality. The goal of Bio-X is to keep Stanford ahead of
its time by welding biology research to advances in
other disciplines such as computation, technology,
chemistry, physics and engineering.
The new center will spring from what is now a
parking lot southeast of the Fairchild Center of the
Medical School, and arc across the street to the Gates
Computer Science Building. Groundbreaking is cur
rently set for June 2000, but as of now, the blueprints
for the building are rough.
School of Engineering Academic Dean Jim Pluin
mer is one of the leaders of the project. When asked to
comment on the architectural ideas for the form of the
James H. Clark Center for Biomedical Engineering
and Sciences, Plummer stressed the committee mem
bers' agreement that a physical merger is paramount.
"We feel it is important to connect the departments
and easily possible," he said. "We are not sure exactly
how it will work. The simplest option would be a cross
walk, but the structure could get more complex with
either an overpass or underpass."
Back in Oct., Committee Head and Biochemistry
Prof. Jim Spudich told The Stanford Daily that he
thought the Bio-X center might need another $100
million of funding to fulfill its potential. Plummer
agreed. "It is likely that the program will expand be
yond our current vision," he said.
Plummer described the center as "a multi-purpose
building" that will include labs, technical centers, lec
ture halls, a cafeteria and seminar rooms in an effort
to keep Stanford at the forefront of Silicon Valley.
While working as a professor at Stanford from
1979 to 1982, Clark sparked ideas lor major compu
tational advances. Clark was the major force behind
multiple technological breakthroughs, including the
