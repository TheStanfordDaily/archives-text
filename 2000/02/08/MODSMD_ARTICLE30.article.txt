# Can MacGyver really do all that with a pocket knife and duct tape?

Pop quiz, hotshot. It's the mid-
IVHOs: break dancing, go-go hoots
arid communism arc alive and well.
You've hern captured by a ruthless
group of East (>ermans, who have tor
tured you, poisoned you and left you
for dead.
To make things worse, the poison
antidote is tantalizingly dose, yet im
possibly far array. From your position
above the sewer grating, you can
clearly see the glint of the bottle from
tile depths below. What do you do?
a) I sc your superpowers to stretch
you > arms through the grilling and
grab the antidote.
b) Wait for Scatty, the Dottle Re
trieving Monkey, to save the day once
again.
c) I'ry to at least score same change
from f>assing pedestrians as you slip
slowly into unconsciousness.
Ready? I lie correct answer is:

d) dial) the conveniently located iron
bar, and, with your last gasps of
strength, bang the also conveniently
located fire hydrant with the bar until
the bar becomes a temporary'magnet,
at which point you can slip it through
the grating and snag the conveniently
metallic antidote vial.
Ol course, ordinary mortals
like you and I wouldn't be able to
come up with a solution like that
without major prompting. It
would take a man with the iinpro
visational abilities and the tousled
good looks ol Richard Dean An
derson, a.k.a. MacCiyver.
That's right â€” for the next few
weeks I will examine the scientif
ic evidence behind the show that

made an entire nation alternately
think, "('.oof' and "My ass! That
would NEVER work." lake any
good scientist, I will first present
fastidiously researched theoreti
cal evidence, then subject the hy
pothesis to rigorous experimen
tal testing.
So would MacClyver's
makeshift magnet work, and, if
so, why? I he physics behind
magnetism are much too compli
cated for me to understand, so I
dec ided to ask a highly respected
member of the physics communi
ty. I lere's what lie had to say (I'm
paraphrasing here):
Electrons circling around an
atom cause that atom to act as a
tiny microscopic magnet, with a

1101 th and south pole like am
other magnet. Macroscopic mag
nets such as bar magnets are com
prised of large numbers of atoms
whose north and south poles are
pointed in the same direction. In
fact, there is no difference be
tween a bar magnet and an ordi
nary iron bar except for the align
ment ol the atoms.
Anyway, even in an ordinary
iron bar, many of the atoms are
already aligned with the Earth's
magnetic field, but there are
enough non-aligned atoms to
prevent you from noticing any
significant amounts of magnetic
attraction. If you give this bar a
sharp mechanical shock, some of
t lie non-aligned atoms will be jolt
ed out of position and will natu
rally fall into alignment with the
Karth's magnetic field. I bis will
make the iron bar slightly mag
netic.
So there you have it. Mac-
Gyver's desperate strategy, in
theory, should have worked, but
would it be enough to actually
pick up something? To deter
mine this, I undertook a highly

scientific experiment where 112
hammered the crap out of vari
ous metal objects and tried to
stick paper clips to tlieni.
I he paper clips just fell off, but
that's probably because their
"magnetic dipole moments aren't
paramagnetic enough." ()r some
thing. Ihe final verdict? Incon
clusive.
Next week we'll observe as
MacGyver ingeniously makes
nylon using common laboratory
chemicals, and as he avoids a
sure, painful, corrosive death by
plugging a sulfuric acid leak with
. . . well, you're just going to have
to read to find out.
This week's Brain Teaser:
MacGyver is taking some
much-deserved R&R on the is
land of knights and knaves,
where some of the inhabitants
(the knights) always tell the truth,
while the rest (the knaves) always
lie. I le is walking along the streets
of Woppo, the capital city, when
he spies two shady inhabitants of
the island, Joe and Bob, selling
Rolex watches for a mere $50.

MacGyver, suspicious, asks joe
whether the Rolexesare real, and
is assured that they are. The fol
lowing exchange then takes
place:
MacCJyver asks Bob, "Do ei
ther of you tell the truth?" hob
answers (yes or no), but Mac-
Gyver still doesn't know whether
he can trustjoe. I le then asks Joe,
"Did Bob answer truthfully?" Joe
answers (yes or no), and Mac-
Gyver then knows whether Joe is
a knight or a knave.
Should MacGyver buy the
watch? Why or why not? Be the
first to answer correctly (with a
convincing explanation) to
yarwoo@hotmail.coin and you'll
win a dorky prize. Hey, at least
it's something to do during lec
ture.

Yar Woo is a junior majoring in com
puter science. In his spare lime he en
joys ruling his hike uphill and going to
/ rader Joe's. His weekly column will
discuss the plausibility of scientific
strategies depicted in popular media.
