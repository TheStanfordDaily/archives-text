Always a threat from outside, the junior forward has
been all-but automatic away from Maples Pavillion
this season, hitting 67 percent of his three-point at
tempts in his last five road games. In a pair of wins
in Los Angeles last weekend, Mendez was a scorch
ing 7 of 9 from behind the arc, and he scored a ca
reer-high 24 points against USC Saturday.

Granville, a freshman ranked second in the nation
in women's singles, needed little more than an hour
to dispatch Washington's Kristina Krasewski and
win the Rolex National Intercollegiate Indoor Cham
pionship in Farmers Branch, Texas. The 6-3, 6-1
victory was the third straight by a Cardinal woman
at the annual tournament.
