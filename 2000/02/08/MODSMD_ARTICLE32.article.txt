# Rugby humbles Humbolt
## Men romp 52-0 in home conference match; Chico State looms next 
### JON COHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Following a hard-fought victory last week over Ari
zona, the Stanford men's rugby team needed an easy
game this weekend. That's exactly what it got, as the
Cardinal trounced an overmatched Humboldt State
squad 52-0 Saturday at New Maloney Field.
This weekend's clash with the Lumberjacks was the
second Pacific Coast League game of the season for the
Cardinal (6-0, 2-0 PCL) and marked its second confer
ence blowout (Stanford defeated Saint Mary's 55-8 on
Jan. 15).
Coming into the game, the Cardinal had not been
playing great rugby, pulling out victories over UC-San
Diego and Arizona despite a pair of sub-par perfor
mances. And while the final score was impressive,
Humboldt State's poor play made it difficult to judge
the Cardinal's progress.
"'l'hey were probably the weakest team we've
played," senior captain Mike Ceballos said. "They're in
our league, but they're a team that's really scraping the
bottom of the barrel, and we couldn't help at times but
to play down to their level."
Indeed, right from the start of the game, the out
come was trot in doubt. Stanford quickly took advan
tage of Humboldt State's terrible ball-handling, jump
ing out to a 25-0 halftime lead.
In the second half, the Cardinal kept attacking re-

lentlessly, while at the same time not letting the Lum
berjacks get within 20 yards of its own goal in securing
the shutout.
Hopefully, Stanford enjoyed the relaxing win, be- _
cause from hereon in the games are going to get much
tougher. fifc|
Next week, conference rival Chico State comes top<
Palo Alto for a 1 p.m. showdown at Maloney Field.
While Chico may not be the most talented team
Stanford has played, it is precisely the kind of team that J
gives the Cardinal trouble. *
"They're not a very refined team," Ceballos said. >
"They're basically a bunch of meat heads who pound*
the ball down the field, but this makes it tough to!
counter-attack." I
Stanford employs a dynamic style of rugby, passing -
the ball often in order to utilize its great speed and ath
leticism, and does not want to be dragged into a slow-
paced, physical contest. i
In addition to wanting to turn next week's match-up '
into its kind of game, the Cardinal is hoping that some
of its players will be back to full strength.

problem lor Stanford this weekend, head coach Franck > fl .
