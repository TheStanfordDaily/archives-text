The Graduate Student Council
withdrew the religious funding
case from the Constitutional
Council after agreeing to fund In
ter Varsity Graduate Christian Fel
lowship at the GSC meeting Sun
day night.
"The case was originally put in
[to the Constitutional Council] be
cause some members of the GSC
didn't want to take action either
way without knowing where [the
funding issue] stood constitutional
ly," said GSC member Chris
Stromberg, a doctoral candidate in
chemistry.
"Stromberg dropped the case
because the GSC] Funding Com
mittee dealt with the issue in a man
ner consistent with theASSU Con
stitution," said ASSU President
Mike Levin, a junior.
After the GSC submitted the
case to the Constitutional Council,
the members continued discussing
the issue of funding religious
groups.
"After extensive discussion, we

had a consensus," Stromljerg siiici.
Using "normal funding crite
ria," the CiSC> voted to fund Inter-
Varsity for posters and ads.
"The C Â»S( 1 Funding (Committee
recommended $175 for the fliers
and publicity of the I V-Grad event,
but $0 for the speaker and accom
modations, over concerns that it
was an off-campus event with rela
tively low interest to non-group
members," Levin said.
"We treated them as any other
group," Strombcrg said.
"The underlying decision was to
not concern ourselves with the phi

funding after a "crisis due to need
for meeting space."
The expanding group had out
grown 112 ree meeting spaces and had

to rent classroom space for $62.52
every week. "We rapidly ran out of
money," he said.
According to Wistey, some
members of the GSG decided that
it would be legally risky to discrim
inate against religious groups.
"We're glad that it got resolved,"
Wistey said. "We're glad it has

made for more equitable and more
honest funding."
I le added that in the past, "some
religious groups applied for fund
ing under the guise of being a cul
tural group."
But now, "religious groups are
treated like other groups on cam
pus," Wistey said.
