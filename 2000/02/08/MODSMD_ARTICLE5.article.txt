# Dean looks at ASSU program
## Stanford After Midnight weighs in with results 
### CHRIS DRAKE 
The extended hours of the Stan
lord After Midnight program are up
for review next week. Depending on
the administration's decision, certain
participants in the program, includ
ing the popular Tresidder Fitness
Center, could see closing times revert
to midnight during spring quarter.
So far, the Stanford After Midnight
program has been largely successful.
According to Dean of Students Marc
Wais, the fitness center's business
hours are not necessarily in jeopardy.
"There has been no decision re
garding hours of operation for any
vendor or department that is partici
pating in Stanford Alter Midnight,"
Wais said.
"Departments are simply looking
at student utilization. We're simply
asking the question, 'Are these [facili
ties] being used late at night?' to justi
fy keeping them open late at night."

"We recognize that winter quarter
may be the most difficult quarter to
implement this program, because of
the weather," Wais said. "Students
may be disinclined to go out late at
night."
Despite students' verbal support
for Stanford Alter Midnight, Wais
noted, "sometimes [the administra
tion needs] more than just talk."
The vendors and departments
participating in the experiment are
compiling numerical data on late
night usage. Wais and the partici
pants will begin examining the data
next week. A full meeting and analysis
of the data will take place on February
23.
The ASSU spearheaded Stanford
Alter Midnight's implementation.
The program, said ASSL President
Mike I.evin, is one of'the ASSU's most
successful projects.
"1 think [Stanford After Midnight]
is the best thing we've done in a long
time," Levin said. "I'm proud that
people know about the program. I'm
more proud of the Stanford After
Midnight program than I am about
anything I've accomplished in the

ASSU."
Levin said that the ASSU realized
that winter quarter would be the
"least likely time students would use
services. We knew that not all of [the
services] would work." However, he
said, "the ones that have worked have
worked better than I ever hoped for."
"1 would be extremely surprised

and disappointed if the extended
hours at Tresidder Fitness did not
continue, because Tresidder Fitness
is one of the most important partici
pants in Stanford After Midnight,"
Levin said. The center's hours of op
eration are important to students â€”

Students say they appreciate the extended hours of Tresidder Fitness under the
ASSU program Stanford After Midnight.
after requesting opinions on the
matter via e-mail, Levin said lie re
ceived more than 100 responses in
just two days.
Students taking advantage of
the fitness center's extended hours
voiced their support for the pro
gram as well. "If you come here
late at night, you can get another
two or three hours of studying in
before going to sleep," said senior
l im Beard. "Most people at Stan

lord are night owls anyway, so [the
fitness center] might as well tailor
[its] hours [to them]."
At 12:55 a.m. Monday, 28 peo
ple were exercising at the fitness
center.
"Most people really appreciate
how [the center] is open late. I
don't know anybody who doesn't
like it," said freshman Dan Spiegel,
who was lifting weights.
"There are at least as many peo
ple in here [nowJ as there are at
two in the afternoon," said fresh
man Chad Goldberg, pedaling on
an exercise bike at 1 a.m.
Students said that if the fitness

center's hours reverted to mid
night throughout the week, work
ing out would be much more diffi
cult.
"1 wouldn't be able to work
out," said freshman Kodrigo
Lope/. "There's nothing better
than getting your work done,
going to work out, taking a show
er, and going to bed."
While the current Stanford
After Midnight hours might not be
permanent for all establishments,
Wais feels optimistic about the
program's future. "1 hope stu
dents can utilize it so we can con
tinue it,"he said.
