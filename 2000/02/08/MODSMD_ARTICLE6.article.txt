### LAUREN PHILLIPS STAFF WRITER 
While the eye-catching headlines
of the New Hampshire primary may
have been the unexpectedly large vic -
tory of Senator John McCain over
Gov. George VV. Bush, Jr. or the mud
slinging by Democratic candidates

"I always had a camera and a mi
crophone on me," he said. "I was ex
