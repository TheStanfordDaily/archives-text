# Stanford employee throws hat in presidential ring
## 
### LAUREN PHILLIPS STAFF WRITER 
While the eye-catching headlines
of the New Hampshire primary may
have been the unexpectedly large vic -
tory of Senator John McCain over
Gov. George VV. Bush, Jr. or the mud
slinging by Democratic candidates
over stances on abortion, the true per
spectives of life on the campaign trail
are often edited out by the popular
press.
And these are just the sort of things
that Stanford employee and Wood
side resident Tom Koos said he got a

c hance to experience during his one
week campaign for the Democratic
presidential candidate in New 1 lamp
shire— moments like liusli standing
up a yard full of school children in the
snow, a group of protesters called
"Pot-Heads for Gore" gathered at a
Republican function and journalists
interviewing one another.
"It was a great educational process,
and it got me really excited about the
upcoming California primary," Koos
said. "1 have a lot more respect for the
candidates stamina and dedication."
While Koos received a very small
proportion of the vote, vote gathering

had not been his main goal in running
for president. His bid for president,
he said, was about the experience of
meeting people and exciting them
about the political process.
"1 was shocked by the sincerity of
the New Hampshire people," he said.
"The folks that I did meet took their
role very seriously as voters."
Koos divided time while in New
Hampshire between attending press
engagements, talking to voters and
meeting candidates. The media, he
said, was a constant presence and
wanted to see him out shaking voters'
hands. He pointed out that there were

not many people out on the streets to
shake hands with — it was just too
cold.
"I always had a camera and a mi
crophone on me," he said. "I was ex
hausted at the end of the day."
He had the chance to meet lorn
Brokaw ol NBC. Nightly News and
was featured on Comedy Central's
spoof news program, The Oaih Show,
along with other less-known candi
dates who had placed themselves on
the ballot.
Although Koos did not have the
opportunity to meet either of the
Democratic front-runners, Gore
or Bradley, he did meet McCain.
"John McCain was listening to
voters' concerns," Koos said. "He
doesn't seem to be ideologically
bound and he's willing to listen."
Koos was less complimentary
towards Bush, who proved to be
hard to meet and elusive on the
campaign trail.
"Bush cannot not screw up.
The first day he brought in Dan
Quayle as an endorsement," he
said.
Despite the fact that he never
had a chance to meet the candi

date, he did spend some time with
200 Bush supporters who had
come from Texas to rally for the
governor. 1 le had breakfast with a
hotel lull of the supporters, who
were decked out in Bush cam
paign regalia.
"They were trying to turn me
over to the dark side," he joked.
"But they were very well orga
nized, and they love their gover
nor."
One troublesome trend that
koos noted during his time in
New Hampshire was the make
up of crowds at scheduled c am
paign events for all the candi
dates. The media and supporters
already dedicated to their candi
date often out-numbered the
population of those in atten
dance to hear the candidate's

stance on issues, displaying the
staged quality of many campaign
events.
"It was distressing to see the
ratio of media to supporters to
regular voters,"he said.
The campaign, besides being
an educational experience for
Koos himself, has also further in
creased his interest in the Califor
nia primary, which will take place
on March 7.
In addition to the heated cam
paign between Republican candi
dates who have a lot to lose in the
"winner take all" primary system,
Koos is awaiting the outcome of
several ballot initiatives, including
the much contested Defense of
Marriage Act.
"I think that March 7 is going
lo be very interesting here in Cal

ifornia," he said.
Now that Koos lias finished his
time as a candidate, he can go
back to being a voting citizen and
resume life as usual at Stanford.
His departure from the race
means that he's also free to give
informed and witty insight into
the election.
While the race between Gore
and Bradley may come to small
policy differences and a matter of
style in his opinion, the McCain /
Bush rate is more heated, Koos
said, pitting established Republi
can interests against a popular
tide which seems to be turning.
"I think that we have three
very strong candidates to choose
from — and then George W.
Bush," he said only half-joking
with a characteristic smile.
