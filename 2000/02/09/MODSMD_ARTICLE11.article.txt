# Rand analyst speaks on 'objectivism'
## Bernstein discusses 'Atlas Shrugged' 
### AMIT GARG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A crowd gathered in Annen
berg Auditorium last night to
hear an analysis by Andrew
Bernstein of object ivist
philosopher Ayn Rand's novel
"Atlas Shrugged." Bernstein is
an adjunct associate professor
of philosophy at Pace Universi
ty-
The speech was sponsored
by the Stanford Objectivist
Club and the ASSU.
"Atlas Shrugged" is Rand's
fictional speculation about the
consequences of a strike by the
"creative producers" of the
world.
Rand, who emigrated from
communist Russia in 1926,
won a cult of followers by argu
ing that individual ability was
the source of real achievement
and that it was best fostered by
laissez-faire capitalism.

She reversed the traditional
notions of selfishness and al
truism, claiming that selfish
ness was a virtue and altruism a
vice. The atheist philosopher
also echoed Nietzsche in her
rejection of religion, especially
Christianity, as the "morality of
slaves."
"Atlas Shrugged is a novel
about a strike. It's a novel
about scientists, artists, writers
and the fate of civilization
when they are gone," Bern
stein said. "The characters in
the book are accomplished
men who try to assert their cre
ative freedom."
He then proceeded to dis
cuss the portrayal of the
human mind in the work. "The
human mind is praised and
glorified to an extent that it be
comes literally the hero. The
novel thus celebrates the
thinkers and defends man's
right to intellectual freedom
for its own sake."
Bernstein then described
how characters typify the

theme <>l "role of reason in

roes. According to liim, Ayn
Rand's protagonist John Calt the
essence of heroism.
"A hero is one who has pro
found moral standards, great
ability, pursues his goal inlatiga
blv against powerful opposing
Ibices and achieves triumph, at
least spiritual if not material. Of
these lour components, the third
— greatness of soul — is by far the
most important asset of a hero."
Bernstein then compared
( hlysseus's physical prowess with
(•alt's mental prowess. He asked
w h\ society, in 2,">()() years of phi

losophy, still sees heroism in
physic al instead of mental terms.
In explaining why not, he
plac ed the majority of the blame
on altruism. "Altruism is collec
tivism, it subjugates the individ
ual to the interest of the majority,
but not to what is the best. In that
way it is opposed to heroism."
In that context, Bernstein
characterized Hamlet as a de
featist, contrasting him with the
successful (lalt. According to him,
Rand's heroes are not only men
of ideas, but also men who insti
tute them.
Bernstein then discussed the
great philosophers' changing
views of mankind, from Plato and
Aristotle, Hume and Kant, to
Marx and Freud According to
him, most philosophers have
seen human beings as ruled by
passion and desires. Further

more, they have considered God,
society or the individual as the
source of morality.
"Ayu Rand was the first to
truly acknowledge that reason
could form the basis of man's
moral standards. Atlas Shrugged
is thus a contrast to the historical
pessimism by celebrating the in
tellectual ability of our heroes."
Bernstein concluded his for
mal speech with a defense of lais
sez-faire capitalism as the only
system allowing for creative free
dom. Above all, he urged that
people " should accept facts as
they are, whether they bring joy
or pain . . . to look reality in the
eyes."
"He [Andrew Bernstein] suc
cessfully presented fundamental
concepts of Ayn Rand's novel
'Atlas Shrugged,'said Dan Walsh,
a local resident and engineer. "I

especially liked the portrayal of a

"1 thought it was nice to con
nect to past philosophers like
Kant and Hume," said sopho
more Karen Corby. "I got a lot
out of it."
Adolfo a retired
Materials Sciences and Engineer
ing research associate, praised
the lecture for its " clear ideas,
spoken in a slow and decisive
manner."
He continued, "But the ideas
were too simplistic. For instance,
the speaker was unable to answer
my question on what is the con
text of the hero. His ideas can be
easily refuted."
Bernstein ended the question
session by saying that Ayn Rand
dramatizes the thinker as hero.
