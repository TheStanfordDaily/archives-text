## Pinochet under scrutiny Israel in state of emergency 
### 
LONDON (AP) — Three
British judges decided yesterday
that opponents of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet are entitled to argue for
access to a medical report that
finds the former Chilean dictator
mentally unfit for trial.
Lawyers for Belgium and six
human rights groups are making
a second legal bid to see the
report.
They were turned down by a
High Court judge a week ago.
The three High Court judges
agreed yesterday to rule on
whether Belgium and the groups
can have access to the results of
the medical examination. The
hearing on the case will continue
today.
Home Secretary Jack Straw,
who decides on extradition, said
last month that after seeing the
report, he is inclined to send
Pinochet back to Chile rather
than extradite him to Spain for
trial. Straw has refused to release
the medical report, citing patient
confidentiality.
Pinochet, 84, has diabetes and
suffered two small strokes last fall.
He was arrested in October
1998 after back surgery in Lon
don and remains under police
guard at a rented mansion west of
the city.
An official Chilean government
report says 3,197 people died or
disappeared during the general's
17-year dictatorship, which began
when he seized power in a 1973
military coup.
The High Court hearing had
been scheduled to decide only
whether Belgium and the groups
could put forth their case.
But the judges then proceeded
to hear arguments.
Straw has said he will not rule
on whether to extradite Pinochet
while court action is pending.

KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel
(AP) — Tens of thousands of
Israelis living near the Lebanon
border huddled in underground
shelters or fled south out of rocket
range yesterday, fearing reprisals
by Lebanese guerrillas for the
heaviest Israeli bombardment in
eight months.
Prime Minister Ehud Barak
ordered a military state of emer
gency along the border, a sign th.it
Israel was preparing for extended
fighting.
Hezbollah guerrillas yesterday
killed an Israeli soldier — the sixth
in two weeks — only hours after
Israeli airstrikes cut electricity
across parts of f^ebanon.
In its second night of attacks,
Israel's air force struck a Hezbol
lah offices in the coastal city of
Tyre and the guerrilla stronghold
of Iqlim al-TuHah, Lebanese secu
rity officials said.
At least two people were
wounded.

I lie Israeli army confirmed the
two attacks on Iqlim al-Tuflah, but
identified the other target as a
1 fe/bollah radar station.
Israeli leaders blamed Syria for
the latest flare-up and said peace
talks will not resume with Damas
cus until it ends the wave of
Lebanese guerrilla attacks.
Svria is the main power-broker
in Lebanon, and Israel says it
encourages the violence.
Syria's state media warned that
the bombing could hurt the peace
process.
"Bombs and missiles are actual
ly striking the alreach stalled peace
process and destroying all
prospects of peace in the,region,"
the English-language Syria I imes
said.
The airstrikes early yesterday
destroyed three power stations at
Jamhour near Beirut, in the
northern mountains east of the
port city of Tripoli and in the east
ern Bekaa Valley tow n of Baalbek,

a Hezbollah guerrilla stronghold
where a base for the group also
was targeted.
The base remained sealed and
damage could not be assessed.
Fifteen civilians were wounded
in Baalbek and were treated at
hospitals for various injuries from
broken glass, debris and shrapnel.
Parts of Lebanon were left
without electricity and severe
rationing was imposed.
I he airstrikes were the harsh
est since a similar strafing by the
outgoing hard-line government,
just before Barak took office in
July.
I he escalation in attacks on
Israeli troops staffing a buffer zone
in Lebanon's south coincided with
the collapse in Syrian-Israel peace
in mid-January.
Syria wants a prior commit
ment from Israel that it will with
draw from the disputed Golan
Heights before talks ensue; Israel
refuses.
