# Tobacco industry accused of price fixing
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” A fed
eral lawsuit targeted the tobacco
industry yesterday, accusing it of
carrying out a "long-running and
systematic" plan to fix cigarette
prices charged to wholesalers.
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S.
District Court, asserts that the
major U.S. cigarette manufactur
ers met secretly to make illegal
agreements on wholesale prices.
Two cigarette wholesalers, Buf
falo Tobacco Products of Buffalo,
N.Y., and F & F Tobacco Products
of Bryan, Texas filed the lawsuit,
which seeks triple damages and
class-action status to represent all
wholesalers hurt by the alleged
price-fixing.
The tobacco industry has been
under mounting pressure for sell
ing a product the American Can
cer Society calls the leading cause
of cancer.
All 50 states reached settlements
in which tobacco companies will
pay them $246 billion for the cost
of treating smoking-related illness
es.
The lawsuit filed yesterday
alleges the major tobacco compa
nies fixed prices during meetings
of cigarette company lawyers who
"frequently discussed, and reached
agreements regarding, future
price increases for cigarettes."
Daniel W. Donahue, deputy
general counsel for R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co., one of the defen
dants, said the issues of price

increases and competitive practices
"were always avoided" at the meet
ings of industry lawyers.
Those named defendants
include Philip Morris Cos.; R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc.;
Brown & Williamson Tobacco
Corp., a unit of British American
Tobacco Co., Ltd.; Lorillard
Tobacco Co., a unit of Loews
Corp.; and Liggett Croup, a unit
of Brooke Croup Ltd.
The lawsuit said there was vir
tually no cigarette price competi
tion from the 1950s until 1980,
when Liggett introduced low
price "generic discount"
cigarettes.
Other companies introduced
generic brands, and after a 1993
price war, a price increase
announced by Philip Morris sig
naled to the other companies
"that they would resume their ille
gal agreement not to compete in
the U.S. cigarette market on the
basis of price," the lawsuit said.
On numerous occasions in the
following years, cigarette compa
nies quickly matched each other s
price increases, the lawsuit said.
Wholesalers often received noti
fication of price increases from the
tobacco companies within hours or
even within minutes of each other,
it said.
The companies also worked
together to fix prices and allocate
market shares outside the United
States, the lawsuit alleged.
