# Clinton acts to bar gene discrimination

WASH 1 NGT()N (AP) — (Pris
tine DeMark worried about her
own medical future when her
mother was diagnosed with Hunt
ington's disease.
She never imagined how her
life would be ( hanged by taking a
test to determine whether she had
inherited the genetic abnormality.
Even before the results were
back, DeMark's fiance left her,
fearing a positive result.
Soon after learning that she did
have the gene that causes the
degenerative nerve disorder,
DeMark was fired from her job at
a Milwaukee management consul
tancy.
"It didn't ever occur to me to
think that way," said DeMark. "1
was more concerned about myself
— whether I was going to have it."
President Clinton sought yes
terday to focus attention on the
plight of people like DeMark,
whose experience illustrates the
potential dark side to advances in
genetic research.
" This extraordinary march of
human understanding imposes
on us a profound responsibility to
make sure that the age of discov
ery can continue to reflect our
most cherished values," he told an
American Association for the
Advancement of Science audience
yesterday.
"We must protect our citizens'
privacy — the bulwark of person
al liberty, the safeguard of individ
ual creativity."
Clinton immediately barred
federal agencies from discriminat
ing against employees on the basis
of genetic tests and urged
Congress to prohibit the private
sector from refusing to hire peo
ple at risk for health problems and
insurers from refusing to cover
them.
Concerns about the use of
genetic information could dis
courage people from seeking cru
cial tests that would improve their

lives, the president said.
"If we do not protect the right
to privacy, we may actually
impede the reach of these break
throughs in the lives of ordinary
people, which would be a pro
found tragedy," he said.
Advances in genetic testing
soon will allow doctors to predict
the medical futures of their
patients.
That has raised worries that
such information could be used
against those deemed more likely
to suffer from cancer, diabetes,
heart disease or other ailments.
Clinton voiced support for leg
islation sponsored by Sens. Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., and Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep.
Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y.that
would outlaw discrimination
based on genetic information.
Some employers and insurers
are reluctant to take on the extra
financial burden of people with
ailments whose treatments can
pile up substantial medical fees for
them.
DeMark said her employer at
the small, self-insured consultancy
began to harass her as soon as she
confided to liiin about her mother
and her plan to take the test.
She was reassigned to a desk
job.
"They were doing everything
to get me to quit," she said. After
the test results came back, she was
fired.
Five years after receiving the
results, DeMark has relocated to
Detroit, where she works in retail.
She has not exhibited any
symptoms of Huntington's dis
ease, which causes involuntary
movements in the limbs and can
lead to dementia.
She said she was trying to pro
tect others by speaking out about
the disease and the potential for
abusing genetic information, say
ing that, "Nothing else can hap
pen to me."
