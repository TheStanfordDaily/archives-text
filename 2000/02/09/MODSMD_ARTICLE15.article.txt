# Clinton awards long-delayed medal of honor

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — His
Ann) uniform aglow with rib
bons and bis eyes trained on the
floor, Alfred Rascon seemed
embarrassed to be at the White
House yesterda) receiving lavish
praise — much less America's
highest military honor.
Only after President Clinton
draped the Medal of Honor
around bis neck did a smile play
across Rascon s face. I le bad
glanced at the men be covered
with bis body in a Vietnamese
jungle 34 years ago to absorb
grenade blasts and shrapnel that
would have killed them and
almost killed him.
"The honor is not really
mine," Rascon said. "It ends up
being those who were with me
that day." He asked the guys
from bis platoon to stand up, and
they did, tears welling in their
eyes. The former Army medic
accepted bis medal and saluted
the commander in chief who pre
sented it.
It was a glorious moment long
denied to Rascon, 54, the son of
Mexican immigrants, who joined
the Army out of love for bis
adopted homeland. He was not
yet a U.S. citizen when be went to
Vietnam. But when, recovered
from bis wounds, he returned to
Vietnam later in the war, it was as
an American.
Rascon is not the first immi
grant to receive the Medal of

I lonor. Immigrants received one
in five of the 3,427 medals autho
rized since the honor was created
in 1861. There are 166 living
Medal of I lonor recipients.
Within days of bis battlefield
bravery, Rascon was recom
mended for the Medal of Honor
by the men be saved. The paper
work was lost, as Clinton said, "in
a thicket of red tape," and Rascon
received the Silver Star instead.
"But it wasn't what we had
written up," one of the men, Ray
Compton, told reporters yester
day. "Neither one of us would be
here today if it hadn't been for Al.
Maybe not in bis own eyes, but in
our eyes, lie's a hero. No doubt
about it."
Compton said be wasn't aware
that Rascon never received the
honor until, in 1993, he asked
Rascon what it was like to have
the Medal of Honor. Rascon
replied that he didn't know.
Compton, fellow platoon
members Neil HafFey and Larry
Gibson and other veterans
sought to correct the oversight.
I hey received a pivotal assist
from Rep. Lane Evans, I)-111., an
advocate for Vietnam veterans.
Hie Pentagon would not recon
sider Rascon's case because so
much time bad elapsed, so F.vans
gave a packet of information
about it to President Clinton in
1997.
The Pentagon relented last

May, and Defense Secretary
William Cohen approved the
honor in November.
Clinton praised Rascon for bis
"long, patient wait for recogni
tion" and the continual commit
ment to serving bis country that
be has displayed since March 16,
1966.

That day, Rascon's platoon
came under attack in a Viet
namese jungle.
The young medic ignored
orders to stay down and ran past
flying bullets to gel to HafFey,
who was wounded. Rascon was so
badly wounded that last rites
were administered.
