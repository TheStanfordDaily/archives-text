## The 						Stanford Daily Prop. 21 exacerbates problem of juvenile crime

which many juvenile offenders are often
caught, which, in turn, worsens as these
offenders become adults.
By incarcerating offenders for longer
periods of time in correctional facilities with
little or no rehabilitative function, Prop. 21
threatens to produce a larger class of poten
tial offenders. These offenders, having
spent critical formative years in prison
rather than the educational system, often
leave prison without having remedied the
problems that led to their incarceration.
This combination leaves youth offenders
without the requisite skills to succeed in
society once they become adults.
In focusing on tougher sentencing
requirements for a slate of crimes, many of
which, according to critics of Prop. 21, tar
get minority youth offenders, the measure
is likely to exacerbate the high crime rates

that currently plague minority communi
ties, especially in low-income urban areas.
With minorities already representing a
disproportionate number of the youths
convicted, enforcing tougher sentencing
measures will only deprive them of neces
sary educational opportunities while
exposing them to the pernicious effects of
prison life. Thus, minority youth offend
ers, without education or rehabilitation,
are more likely to grow into minority adult
offenders, creating a dangerous cycle that
keeps minorities as a majority of the incar
cerated indefinitely.
There are also significant budgetary
issues related to Prop. 21. Without an
internal funding mechanism to support
the obvious rise in expenditures necessary
to incarcerate a greater number of offend
ers for a greater duration of time, the

measure will likely be a major draw on the
state's coffers. It would divert critical
funding away from educational and reha
bilitative programs which would combat
the actual causes of* crime rather than
merely punish offenders for their actions.
Mandating tougher sentences and lock
ing up more youth offenders is not the
answer to the juvenile crime dilemma, nor
is it the most effective method to help curb
the state's crime problem.
If California wishes to make a significant
impact on juvenile crime, it must change
both the funding and enforcement mech
anisms of state legislation and the mindset
of state legislators. Only then will adequate
support find its way to educational pro
grams at the community and school level,
as well as to rehabilitation programs for
those offenders already incarcerated.
