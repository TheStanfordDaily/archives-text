Weaver,
Liist oil, let me congratulate both of
vou on your recent projects. Ms. Weaver,
though I actually haven't dropped $N.T>()
to sec- "Galaxy (,)uest" yet, I have heard
nothing but good things about the movie.
I understand the . . . umm . . . well
endowed, blonde look suits you.
And Mr. Hanson, though I've never
aduallv seen youi new I V show. Fin sure
il has to be better than Veronica's
Closet. ('I hen again, obese monkeys sil
ling around a table screeching at each
oiltci would Ik- belter than Veronica's
Closet. I hen again .. . Wail, no — too
easy.) I mean, who would have thought
I hat the onl\ a< lot to make iI from ( beers
to the big screen would be Wood) the
bartender?
But I digress.
Fm sine vou ve heard ol Yale's recent
decision to spend !>.">()(> million on engi
neering facilities. ()i Stanford's new $ 120
million S< ience and Fngineering Quad?
<>i even \el scape founder |im Clark's
SlaO million donation to lot in a new bio
engineering program here at Stanford?
()i tnavbe vou've heard of Bill Gates
and the building he bought lor the (ioin
putei Science majors here? Ver\ snazzy.
Kiosks and eveiAlhing. And be only gave
$0 million.
\s arguablv the most famous Stanford
alumni in the entertainment industry, I
was wondering il vou might be interested
in helping lo lund the art programs at
Stanford.
Pretty please?
It's hard to be am kind of arts major
here at Stanford these davs. Music, studio
ait, drama, dance and creative writing
•lie all undei funded. Performance and
rehearsal spate are always .it a premium.
Stanford is a ver\ rich school, and yet
there are Humanities departments that
still call W ilbur paiking lot home.
And don't let the administration trot
out the Cantoi Arts Center excuse. Yes,
II si »ill \ a year old, but il look ten years to
build and contains no spaces for students
to work in (oi even take c lasses in).
I've had friends who wanted to minor
in Studio Art but had to give up because
thev couldn't get into any of the intro
ductorv (lasses. 1 ach quarter, they'd walk
into a loom ol ."»() prospective students,
each person clutching bis or bet c harcoal
and drawing pad, vying for only ten
spots. Like a scene out of "New Jack
City,' unlv with Prismacolors. And
hribcrv only works so well in the Art
net jartment.

(Creative writing classes are so popular
they have to hold "lotteries" every quar
ter. And have you seen the Stanford Dig
ital Art Center? Crciridea, great man
agement, not enough money. I mean,
four Macs does not a Digital Art Center
make. Let's all say it together now — the
Sam Malone Digital Art Center. Doesn't
that have a nice ring to il?
Ves, Stanford is in Silicon Valley. And,
yes, Stanford does and should excel in
engineering. But sometimes Stanford for
gets that a "liberal arts" university has to
oiler "art as well. It's one big, vicious
cycle. As Stanford attracts fewer and
fewer artists and more and more engi
neers, the humanities departments get
weaker and weaker, and Stanford pro
duces fewer fiizzie alumni lor support.
I hat's where you guys come in.
I know il might be a bad lime for you
to give money — I've done The Stanford
Fund, I'm used to rejection — but I'm
sure we could work out some sort of tax
exemption incentive.
And wouldn't you like lo have a build
ing named after you? Bill (..ties proved
that all it takes is $() million. Imagine,
you could visit the Farm next homecom
ing and heat f'rosh complaining about
having Introduction to the Humanities
lectures at Dan son Hall or Weaver Audi
torium.
I haven't seen either of you in a VHI
Behind the Music special or an F! True
Hollywood Story, so I know you've been
able to save a few bucks lor retirement. All
I'm asking for is a nice, new, $(» million
building just like Gates. Did I mention
the kiosks? It could have theaters, paint
ing and drawing studios, dance floors, the
whole she-bang. All for just a few million
dollars. Or in mote familial terms, only
(»() "Blair Witch Projects" or just l/3()th of
a "Titanic." Fvcn a couple hundred bucks
would help — I'd settle for a few more
sections of Photo 1.
1 know I can't speak for everyone, but
I would definitely spearhead a campaign
for an All-l ed Hanson, All-Sigourney
Weaver Flicks Quarter: "Alien," "Aliens,"
"Alien Resurrection," "Gorillas in the
Mist," "Working Girl," umm ... "Three
Men and a Little Lady," umm . . . well
you get the idea.
Please promise me that you'll at least
think about donating. Oh, and good luck.
Fed, with your search for a new agent.
Your pal at Stanford,
Adrian
