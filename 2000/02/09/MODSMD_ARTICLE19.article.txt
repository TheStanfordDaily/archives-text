Daily misrepresents students at
Black Liberation Month celebration

We, several members of the African
American community .it Stanford, took
offense at a picture published in I he Daily
on Feb. 2. The picture, which addressed
the on-campus celebration of Black I ibera
tion Month, featured two Black students
eating fried chicken with exaggerated
expressions on their faces. I he caption
read, "Let's do lunch: Warrick McDowell
and Kdjali Nduom kirk oil Black Libera
tion Month with a fried chicken lunch at
the Cage in White Plaza."
We believe the depiction of the students
in the photo, as well as the phrasing of the
caption, perpetuates common stereotypes
of African Americans. I lie Daily itself rarely
has pictures of African Americans or articles
specifically addressing their community
events on the front page.
In the one instance that this was not the
case, The Daily depic ted African Americans
in a cartoon-like and uncivilized manner —
McDowell's mouth full <>l food, for example
— in the same way that many racist publi
cations have in the past. I lie caption also
re-affirmed the common stereotype that
African Americans love to eat fried c hicken

In emphasizing that the students celebrat
ed with a 'Tried thicken" lunch, as if the
type of lunch mattered.
Carolyn Martindale of Voungstown
State University wrote, "When coverage is
not race-neutral, it grows out of prejudice
— however unconscious — and it rein
forces prejudice. Such coverage should not
continue."
Whether or not I lie Daily's photogra
phers or editors realize that they may have
clone the African American community
harm by publishing this picture, we have
taken offense. We therefore request both
an apology from The Daily and that you
use better judgment in selecting which
photographs you publish in the future.

Larkin staff members challenge

Admit Weekend policy
We write this letter to inform the greater
Stanford community about what we believe
to be misguided plans for this year's Admit
Weekend.
We, like the administration, want to see
a safe Admit Weekend and do not want a
repeat of last year's event when two admits
drank themselves into physical danger.
