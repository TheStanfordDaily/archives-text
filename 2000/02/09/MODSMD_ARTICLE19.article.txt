Daily misrepresents students at
Black Liberation Month celebration

We, several members of the African
American community .it Stanford, took
offense at a picture published in I he Daily
on Feb. 2. The picture, which addressed
the on-campus celebration of Black I ibera
tion Month, featured two Black students
eating fried chicken with exaggerated
expressions on their faces. I he caption
read, "Let's do lunch: Warrick McDowell
and Kdjali Nduom kirk oil Black Libera
tion Month with a fried chicken lunch at
the Cage in White Plaza."
We believe the depiction of the students
in the photo, as well as the phrasing of the
caption, perpetuates common stereotypes
of African Americans. I lie Daily itself rarely
has pictures of African Americans or articles
specifically addressing their community
events on the front page.
In the one instance that this was not the
case, The Daily depic ted African Americans
in a cartoon-like and uncivilized manner —
McDowell's mouth full <>l food, for example
— in the same way that many racist publi
cations have in the past. I lie caption also
re-affirmed the common stereotype that
African Americans love to eat fried c hicken

In emphasizing that the students celebrat
ed with a 'Tried thicken" lunch, as if the
type of lunch mattered.
Carolyn Martindale of Voungstown
State University wrote, "When coverage is
not race-neutral, it grows out of prejudice
— however unconscious — and it rein
forces prejudice. Such coverage should not
continue."
Whether or not I lie Daily's photogra
phers or editors realize that they may have
clone the African American community
harm by publishing this picture, we have
taken offense. We therefore request both
an apology from The Daily and that you
use better judgment in selecting which
photographs you publish in the future.

Admit Weekend policy
We write this letter to inform the greater
Stanford community about what we believe
to be misguided plans for this year's Admit
Weekend.
We, like the administration, want to see
a safe Admit Weekend and do not want a
repeat of last year's event when two admits
drank themselves into physical danger.

in print or electronically. .
Unlike the administration, however, we do
not believe that threats from the University
or policing by house stalls will create a safer
atmosphere. Indeed, we believe that such
an approach will diminish other important
goals of the University.
Per the draft guidelines for Admit
Weekend, this year's admits and their par
ents must sign a behavioral contract lx-lore
being allowed to attend Admit Weekend.
Beyond requiring admits to "adhere to all
University rules," the behavioral contract
stipulates expected behavior of admits in
six areas: "Respect for Others," "Alcohol,"
"Illegal Drugs," "Smoking," "Weapons"
and "Damage to Property." The language
of the contract is coercive: "Use, possession,
and /or distribution" of illegal drugs or
alcohol "will result in severe sanctions,
including... possible withdrawal of the
offer of admission to the University."
I lie Admit Weekend mission statement
states, "Through Admit Weekend, we hope
to convince our admits to enroll at Stan
lord." Does the administration really
expect to attract the best students to Stan
ford by forcing them to sign contracts that
insult their self-respect? Admits who believe
themselves to be mature and responsible
will likely be offended In having to sign
such a contract.
Moreover, some students and parents
may believe that the contract signals perva
sive problems that lace the Stanford com
munity. Some parents or admits will
assume that firearms, drugs and alcohol
have been endemic problems during
Admit Weekend. But even last year, when
two admits were hospitalized for alcohol
poisoning, one loses sight of the fact that
more than 1,200 admits descended on

campus that weekend, and most did not
drink, let alone drink to excess.
In addition to being insulting and deter
ring attendance, these guidelines threaten
important underlying values of the Univer
sity. Unlike the rest of the year, the admin
istration expects residential staffs to fx*
police that weekend.
The guidelines specifically state: "Any
residential staff member should intervene if
they become aware of an unauthorized or
questionable event, e.g. resident party serv
ing alcohol and an open invitation to Admit
Weekend participants or Admit Weekend
participants soliciting Stanford upper-class
students for alcohol."
But if such rules are enforced, three out
comes will likely follow. First, Stanford stu
dents expect to be reasoned with, and not
dictated to; interventions by Big Brother
are more often perceived as challenges to
subvert, rather than rules automatically fol
ic >wed.
Second, the students will drink surrepti
tiously, an undesirable outcome under any
circumstances. With the threat of "with
drawal of admission" hanging over admits'
heads, Stanford hosts or fellow admits are
unlikely to seek medical attention if an
admit drinks to physical distress.
Third, the first and most important
impression that the admits will form of res
idential stalls is that they are police. Those
that choose to attend Stan lord will arrive in
September with an adversarial attitude
towards resident assistants and resident fel
lows.
All of this is antithetical to this Universi
ty, which operates under the Fundamental
Standard, asks of its students to act in a
mature, responsible way and provides RAs
and RFs to help them meet that standard.
The relationship between residential
stall and residents is based primarily on
trust, confidence, communication and per
suasion. Thus, residential staff members
are able to stop many serious alcohol-relat-

Ed injuries and problems because of the
open relationship they are able to maintain
with their residents regarding alcohol.
Forcing stall members to become cops
during Admit Weekend jeopardizes the
openness between next year's residential
staffs and freshmen, and, in turn, will make
residences less safe next year. And ibis goes
to the biggest fallacy of the administration's
approach: that it can treat 17 to 18-year
olds paternalistically and coercively in April
and demand from them maturity and
responsibility if they return five months
later.
We want Admit Weekend to be safe, but
these guidelines are not a solution. A more
productive measure would be to impart on
this year's Frosh and other hosts the impor
tance of responsibility and safety during
Admit Weekend, to accept that some
Admits may drink, and, if they do, will
need safety nets, not police wagons.
If top administrators are really con
cerned about Admit Weekend, they should
go out to the residences and share their
concerns with hosts and use a tool that
serves Stanford well: persuade current stu
dents to take responsibility for a safe week
end.

Pro-choice groups not about
"killing innocent children"

Thank all goodness that we have the
voice of "reason" and "moral righteous
ness" in the form of graduate student Vin
cent James Strickler (Letters, Feb. 7) to be
"ashamed of the ignorance" of those
women who dare to l)elieve that they have
the right to control their own body.
Reading Stickler's over-brash and
under-researched response to the column
(Feb. ,1) written by Elizabeth Reeds and
Frin Schmidt regarding the starting of the
new pro-choice (NOT pro-abortion, Mr.
Strickler) group was both angering and
depressing because it reeked of the very
uneducated rhetoric which has made the
abortion issue as heated and as confusing as
it has been in the last few decades.
Perhaps if Strickler had taken the time
to do any research on the topic, or even
find out more about what a pro-choice
group is about, he would recognize a cou
ple of things.
First of all, even if abortion was made
illegal, it does not mean that abortions
would stop happening. It would simply
mean more illegal abortions would occur.
Of the 46 million abortions that happen
worldwide, 20 million of those take place in
countries where abortion is illegal (Family
Planning Perspectives, Jan. 1999).
And if Strickler has not read accounts of
the "ally-doctors" that perform these abor

tions without any proper or sanitary medi
cal equipment, he should at least stop and
think about the fact that outlawing abor
tions doesn't save babies; it kills mothers.
Additionally, pro-choice groups encour
age education and reproductive control,
not the "killing of innocent children." A
pro-choicer wants both men and women to
be comfortable with open and honest dis
course about reproduction and reproduc
tive rights. This entails education about
birth control, access to contraceptives and
reproductive services and a promotion of
making responsible decisions.
The entire division between pro-life and
pro-choice is silly at best because you will
not find a single pro-choicer who is "anti
life." A pro-choicer simply recognizes that
we live in a world that is not as black and
white as we would like to lx*lieve and that,
instead of judging people because of their
actions, we should learn and educate about
the issue of sex and reproduction as much
as possible so that abortion doesn't even
have to be an issue.
But open discussion can only happen so
long as we empower women about their
bodies. By outlawing abortion, the opposite
occurs — we teach women that they should
be punished and stigmatized for their
actions. Instead of giving a woman a choice
and allowing her to choose her fate for her
self, her fate is decided instead by the opin
ions of people like Strickler.
I am not a part of the Stanford Pro-
Choice group, but I give them my full sup
port as a woman and as an informed citizen
of this country.
Everyone has a right to their opinion,
but I should hope that, in forming opinions,
people would take more time to hear both
sides, to think about the issue, and to take
the time to separate out the rhetoric from
the re;d facts.

tive rights. This entails education about
birth control, access to contraceptives and
reproductive services and a promotion of
making responsible decisions.
The entire division between pro-life and
pro-choice is silly at best because you will
not find a single pro-choicer who is "anti
life." A pro-choicer simply recognizes that
we live in a world that is not as black and
white as we would like to lx*lieve and that,
instead of judging people because of their
actions, we should learn and educate about
the issue of sex and reproduction as much
as possible so that abortion doesn't even
have to be an issue.
But open discussion can only happen so
long as we empower women about their
bodies. By outlawing abortion, the opposite
occurs — we teach women that they should
be punished and stigmatized for their
actions. Instead of giving a woman a choice
and allowing her to choose her fate for her
self, her fate is decided instead by the opin
ions of people like Strickler.
I am not a part of the Stanford Pro-
Choice group, but I give them my full sup
port as a woman and as an informed citizen
of this country.
Everyone has a right to their opinion,
but I should hope that, in forming opinions,
people would take more time to hear both
sides, to think about the issue, and to take
the time to separate out the rhetoric from
the re;d facts.

Daily misrepresents students at
Black Liberation Month celebration

We, several members of the African
American community .it Stanford, took
offense at a picture published in I he Daily
on Feb. 2. The picture, which addressed
the on-campus celebration of Black I ibera
tion Month, featured two Black students
eating fried chicken with exaggerated
expressions on their faces. I he caption
read, "Let's do lunch: Warrick McDowell
and Kdjali Nduom kirk oil Black Libera
tion Month with a fried chicken lunch at
the Cage in White Plaza."
We believe the depiction of the students
in the photo, as well as the phrasing of the
caption, perpetuates common stereotypes
of African Americans. I lie Daily itself rarely
has pictures of African Americans or articles
specifically addressing their community
events on the front page.
In the one instance that this was not the
case, The Daily depic ted African Americans
in a cartoon-like and uncivilized manner —
McDowell's mouth full <>l food, for example
— in the same way that many racist publi
cations have in the past. I lie caption also
re-affirmed the common stereotype that
African Americans love to eat fried c hicken

In emphasizing that the students celebrat
ed with a 'Tried thicken" lunch, as if the
type of lunch mattered.
Carolyn Martindale of Voungstown
State University wrote, "When coverage is
not race-neutral, it grows out of prejudice
— however unconscious — and it rein
forces prejudice. Such coverage should not
continue."
Whether or not I lie Daily's photogra
phers or editors realize that they may have
clone the African American community
harm by publishing this picture, we have
taken offense. We therefore request both
an apology from The Daily and that you
use better judgment in selecting which
photographs you publish in the future.

Admit Weekend policy
We write this letter to inform the greater
Stanford community about what we believe
to be misguided plans for this year's Admit
Weekend.
We, like the administration, want to see
a safe Admit Weekend and do not want a
repeat of last year's event when two admits
drank themselves into physical danger.

Letters must be signed and accompa

Unlike the administration, however, we do
not believe that threats from the University
or policing by house stalls will create a safer
atmosphere. Indeed, we believe that such
an approach will diminish other important
goals of the University.
Per the draft guidelines for Admit
Weekend, this year's admits and their par
ents must sign a behavioral contract lx-lore
being allowed to attend Admit Weekend.
Beyond requiring admits to "adhere to all
University rules," the behavioral contract
stipulates expected behavior of admits in
six areas: "Respect for Others," "Alcohol,"
"Illegal Drugs," "Smoking," "Weapons"
and "Damage to Property." The language
of the contract is coercive: "Use, possession,
and /or distribution" of illegal drugs or
alcohol "will result in severe sanctions,
including... possible withdrawal of the
offer of admission to the University."
I lie Admit Weekend mission statement
states, "Through Admit Weekend, we hope
to convince our admits to enroll at Stan
lord." Does the administration really
expect to attract the best students to Stan
ford by forcing them to sign contracts that
insult their self-respect? Admits who believe
themselves to be mature and responsible
will likely be offended In having to sign
such a contract.
Moreover, some students and parents
may believe that the contract signals perva
sive problems that lace the Stanford com
munity. Some parents or admits will
assume that firearms, drugs and alcohol
have been endemic problems during
Admit Weekend. But even last year, when
two admits were hospitalized for alcohol
poisoning, one loses sight of the fact that
more than 1,200 admits descended on

campus that weekend, and most did not
drink, let alone drink to excess.
In addition to being insulting and deter
ring attendance, these guidelines threaten
important underlying values of the Univer
sity. Unlike the rest of the year, the admin
istration expects residential staffs to fx*
police that weekend.
The guidelines specifically state: "Any
residential staff member should intervene if
they become aware of an unauthorized or
questionable event, e.g. resident party serv
ing alcohol and an open invitation to Admit
Weekend participants or Admit Weekend
participants soliciting Stanford upper-class
students for alcohol."
But if such rules are enforced, three out
comes will likely follow. First, Stanford stu
dents expect to be reasoned with, and not
dictated to; interventions by Big Brother
are more often perceived as challenges to
subvert, rather than rules automatically fol
ic >wed.
Second, the students will drink surrepti
tiously, an undesirable outcome under any
circumstances. With the threat of "with
drawal of admission" hanging over admits'
heads, Stanford hosts or fellow admits are
unlikely to seek medical attention if an
admit drinks to physical distress.
Third, the first and most important
impression that the admits will form of res
idential stalls is that they are police. Those
that choose to attend Stan lord will arrive in
September with an adversarial attitude
towards resident assistants and resident fel
lows.
All of this is antithetical to this Universi
ty, which operates under the Fundamental
Standard, asks of its students to act in a
mature, responsible way and provides RAs
and RFs to help them meet that standard.
The relationship between residential
stall and residents is based primarily on
trust, confidence, communication and per
suasion. Thus, residential staff members
are able to stop many serious alcohol-relat-

Ed injuries and problems because of the
open relationship they are able to maintain
with their residents regarding alcohol.
Forcing stall members to become cops
during Admit Weekend jeopardizes the
openness between next year's residential
staffs and freshmen, and, in turn, will make
residences less safe next year. And ibis goes
to the biggest fallacy of the administration's
approach: that it can treat 17 to 18-year
olds paternalistically and coercively in April
and demand from them maturity and
responsibility if they return five months
later.
We want Admit Weekend to be safe, but
these guidelines are not a solution. A more
productive measure would be to impart on
this year's Frosh and other hosts the impor
tance of responsibility and safety during
Admit Weekend, to accept that some
Admits may drink, and, if they do, will
need safety nets, not police wagons.
If top administrators are really con
cerned about Admit Weekend, they should
go out to the residences and share their
concerns with hosts and use a tool that
serves Stanford well: persuade current stu
dents to take responsibility for a safe week
end.

Pro-choice groups not about
"killing innocent children"

Thank all goodness that we have the
voice of "reason" and "moral righteous
ness" in the form of graduate student Vin
cent James Strickler (Letters, Feb. 7) to be
"ashamed of the ignorance" of those
women who dare to l)elieve that they have
the right to control their own body.
Reading Stickler's over-brash and
under-researched response to the column
(Feb. ,1) written by Elizabeth Reeds and
Frin Schmidt regarding the starting of the
new pro-choice (NOT pro-abortion, Mr.
Strickler) group was both angering and
depressing because it reeked of the very
uneducated rhetoric which has made the
abortion issue as heated and as confusing as
it has been in the last few decades.
Perhaps if Strickler had taken the time
to do any research on the topic, or even
find out more about what a pro-choice
group is about, he would recognize a cou
ple of things.
First of all, even if abortion was made
illegal, it does not mean that abortions
would stop happening. It would simply
mean more illegal abortions would occur.
Of the 46 million abortions that happen
worldwide, 20 million of those take place in
countries where abortion is illegal (Family
Planning Perspectives, Jan. 1999).
And if Strickler has not read accounts of
the "ally-doctors" that perform these abor

tions without any proper or sanitary medi
cal equipment, he should at least stop and
think about the fact that outlawing abor
tions doesn't save babies; it kills mothers.
Additionally, pro-choice groups encour
age education and reproductive control,
not the "killing of innocent children." A
pro-choicer wants both men and women to
be comfortable with open and honest dis
course about reproduction and reproduc
tive rights. This entails education about
birth control, access to contraceptives and
reproductive services and a promotion of
making responsible decisions.
The entire division between pro-life and

Reading Stickler's over-brash and
under-researched response to the column
(Feb. ,1) written by Elizabeth Reeds and
Frin Schmidt regarding the starting of the
new pro-choice (NOT pro-abortion, Mr.
Strickler) group was both angering and
depressing because it reeked of the very
uneducated rhetoric which has made the
abortion issue as heated and as confusing as
it has been in the last few decades.
Perhaps if Strickler had taken the time
to do any research on the topic, or even
find out more about what a pro-choice
group is about, he would recognize a cou
ple of things.
First of all, even if abortion was made
illegal, it does not mean that abortions
would stop happening. It would simply
mean more illegal abortions would occur.
Of the 46 million abortions that happen
worldwide, 20 million of those take place in
countries where abortion is illegal (Family
Planning Perspectives, Jan. 1999).
And if Strickler has not read accounts of
the "ally-doctors" that perform these abor

tions without any proper or sanitary medi
cal equipment, he should at least stop and
think about the fact that outlawing abor
tions doesn't save babies; it kills mothers.
Additionally, pro-choice groups encour
age education and reproductive control,
not the "killing of innocent children." A
pro-choicer wants both men and women to
be comfortable with open and honest dis
course about reproduction and reproduc
tive rights. This entails education about
birth control, access to contraceptives and
reproductive services and a promotion of
making responsible decisions.
The entire division between pro-life and
pro-choice is silly at best because you will
not find a single pro-choicer who is "anti
life." A pro-choicer simply recognizes that
we live in a world that is not as black and
white as we would like to lx*lieve and that,
instead of judging people because of their
actions, we should learn and educate about
the issue of sex and reproduction as much
as possible so that abortion doesn't even
have to be an issue.
But open discussion can only happen so
long as we empower women about their
bodies. By outlawing abortion, the opposite
occurs — we teach women that they should
be punished and stigmatized for their
actions. Instead of giving a woman a choice
and allowing her to choose her fate for her
self, her fate is decided instead by the opin
ions of people like Strickler.
I am not a part of the Stanford Pro-
Choice group, but I give them my full sup
port as a woman and as an informed citizen
of this country.
Everyone has a right to their opinion,
but I should hope that, in forming opinions,
people would take more time to hear both
sides, to think about the issue, and to take
the time to separate out the rhetoric from
the re;d facts.
