# All Dolled up
## 
### AMY CHRISTESON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As freshman Amanda Ose gracefully
leaned over to stretch, she casually chatted
with the potential Dollies around her.
Everyone in Elliot Program Center last
Sunday evening was full of energy, ready
for the two-hour practice that lay ahead.
Like many Stanford students who are
notorious for combining their play with
their work, Ose has found a way to join her
passions with her pleasures: she will be try
ing out this week to be one of the Stanford

Band's five
Dollies.
As an en
thusiastic sup
porter of Stan
ford sports and
a long-time
dancer, Ose
said she be
lieves that
being a part of
the Dollies
would be
a great way to
fuse her inter
ests.
"I love
dancing and
per 112 or m i n g,
and I a m a
huge fan of
Stanford
sports," Ose
said. "Being a
Dollie would
give me the op
portunity to do
both all the
time."

This belief brought Ose, along with 30
others, to the
information session for women interested
in becoming Dollies.
Like Ose, many of the women have
grown up as ballerinas, tap dancers and jazz
artists, and see the possibility of becoming a
Dollie as the next step in furthering their
love for dance.
Sophomore Lauren Heiser, who has
been dancing since age 5, said she misses
the performances and competitions she
participated in throughout childhood.
Being a Dollie, she said, would be a good
way to get this feeling back.
"I haven't had much time to dance at
Stanford, and 1 really miss it," she said.

would love to have dance as part of my daily
routine again."
In the two-hour rehearsals led by current
Dollies, the women practice their choreog
raphy to "Craz\ Train" and "She's Not
There," two of the Band's famous tunes.
Ose will perform these routines along with
an original number later this week.
Tryout practices began last Wednesday,
and have required a certain amount of time
and devotion for all the potential Dollies.
