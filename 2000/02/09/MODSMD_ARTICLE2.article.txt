# All Dolled up
## 
### AMY CHRISTESON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As freshman Amanda Ose gracefully
leaned over to stretch, she casually chatted
with the potential Dollies around her.
Everyone in Elliot Program Center last
Sunday evening was full of energy, ready
for the two-hour practice that lay ahead.
Like many Stanford students who are
notorious for combining their play with
their work, Ose has found a way to join her
passions with her pleasures: she will be try
ing out this week to be one of the Stanford

Band's five
Dollies.
As an en
thusiastic sup
porter of Stan
ford sports and
a long-time
dancer, Ose
said she be
lieves that
being a part of
the Dollies
would be
a great way to
fuse her inter
ests.
"I love
dancing and
per 112 or m i n g,
and I a m a
huge fan of
Stanford
sports," Ose
said. "Being a
Dollie would
give me the op
portunity to do
both all the
time."

This belief brought Ose, along with 30
others, to the
information session for women interested
in becoming Dollies.
Like Ose, many of the women have
grown up as ballerinas, tap dancers and jazz
artists, and see the possibility of becoming a
Dollie as the next step in furthering their
love for dance.
Sophomore Lauren Heiser, who has
been dancing since age 5, said she misses
the performances and competitions she
participated in throughout childhood.
Being a Dollie, she said, would be a good
way to get this feeling back.
"I haven't had much time to dance at
Stanford, and 1 really miss it," she said.

would love to have dance as part of my daily
routine again."
In the two-hour rehearsals led by current
Dollies, the women practice their choreog
raphy to "Craz\ Train" and "She's Not
There," two of the Band's famous tunes.
Ose will perform these routines along with
an original number later this week.
Tryout practices began last Wednesday,
and have required a certain amount of time
and devotion for all the potential Dollies.

"I definitely haven't had as
much free time," said Dollie
hopeful Lauren Heiser, a sopho
more. "But even though it has
taken up a lot of my free time, I
look forward to going to practices
every day. It has become a type of
stress relief and has especially
helped me get through midterms
these past two weeks."
The current Dollies will an
nounce the first cuts on Thurs
day. according to the Band's
Press Relations Representative,
senior Joey Pritikin. The lucky
few who survive cuts — probably
numbering around 10 — are in
vited to the Band's audition/
party on Saturday, where they
will perform their dances and in
teract with band members.
The Band, which spends every
year performing with the Dollies,
will judge each woman's perfor
mance. Pritikin says the Band
evaluates originality, energy and
whether the girls are "into it."
"It's a really fun day, but it's
not taken lightly," Pritikin said.

Band members will interview
each applicant after her dance.
According to Pritikin, the Band
feels that being an interesting and
fun person is just as important as
being a skilled dancer.
Early Sunday morning, band
members and Dollie alumni will
select five new Dollies from the
current pool of talented women.
Last week, the current Dollies
held open information sessions
and dance rehearsals. Kacli Dollie
has also held individual clinics
and has helped aspiring Dollies
outside of practice.
According to sophomore
Campbell Miller, a current Dol
lie,
working with the Dollie prospects
as they prepare to audition has
definitely been worthwhile.
"I think the students trying
out this year are great," she said.
"I remember from tryouts last
year how nerve-wracking it was
learning all of the dances on time
and feeling prepared. I remem
ber wanting to quit because I
didn't think I'd get it all learned
in time.
"It's weird being on the other
side of the process this year and
how I feel much more relaxed

and excited rather than nervous
and scared."
The auditioning women said
they greatly appreciate the Dol
lies'
time and effort.
This year's Dollies "are won
derful," Ose said. "They put so
much
effort into helping us."
Though the Dollies are cur
rently focused on training their
successors, they usually spend
their time rehearsing and per
forming at Stanford sporting
events. Ose said that at one of the
information sessions, the Dollies
explained that school and danc
ing consume a Dollie's entire
year.
This doesn't worry Ose, who
understands that "it is a huge
commitment." However, she
said, "the benefits greatly out
weigh [the sacrifices]."
"Dancing is my favorite thing
to do," she said. "I wouldn't mind
practicing every day."
Heiser added that prioritizing
and scheduling are important
with such a time-consuming ac
tivity.
"It's all about priorities —
[being a Dollie] and school would

become my number one priori
ties and everything else would
have to fit in whenever possible,"
she said. "I'm not too worried
about it. Although it is a big time
commitment, I don't think it's
meant to take over your entire
life. I feel like it would be an
amazing addition."
Ose first saw the Dollies per
form at the UCLA football game
the first week of school this year.
She said they appeared to be hav
ing a great time, so she started
watching them at all the games.
This made her want to be a Dol
lie.
As the first round of cuts ap
proaches, Ose admitted she feels
"pretty nervous."
Heiser said trying out in front
of the Band on Sunday might be
slightly nerve-wracking.
"I'm a little bit nervous be
cause I know how crazy [the
Band] can be. But I think it's
going to be fun. Their energy is
contagious."
Pritikin is also "highly antici
pating" the selection of the new
Dollies, an event which he consid
ers "one of the most fun days of
the year — right on par with the
Rose Bowl."
