## Hoops thriving at halfway mark 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
It's almost a given now. When looking at the
top of the Pacific 10 Conference standings, ex
pect to see one name.
UCLA.-' In past years, that would be the obvi
ous choice. But the shine of the powder blue and
gold uniforms has been tarnished a bit as the
Bruins have been unable to buy a bucket or a
win. Mired in seventh place with a dismal 3-6
conference record, UCLA still has trips to Stan
ford and Arizona to go. The 11-time NCAA
champions might actually have to settle for the
NIT.
USC? A few weeks ago the Trojans looked like
the surprise of the year. But after beginning the
conference season 5-0 with a win over Arizona,
the Trojans are 1-3 in the Pac-10. Without Sam
Clancy to provide strength and much-needed
depth, and with trips to Maples Pavilion and the
MtKale Center, USC is lighting for an NCAA
berth.
Arizona? Many would agree. The No. 7 Wild
cats (19-4, 8-1 Pac-10) have more than survived
the loss of small forward Richard Jefferson to re
main tied for first place. But Arizona struggled at
home against Washington and Washington
State, a combined 3-15 in the Pac-10. And its 26-
point loss to Louisiana State a week ago was
downright embarrassing.
With apologies to second-place Oregon, that
leaves one team squarely at the head of the "Pac"
at the halfway mark in the conference season —
second-ranked Stanford (19-1,8-1).
The deep, disciplined and physical Cardinal
has not proven itself by consistent 30-point victo
ries, though there have been enough of those.
Instead it is Stanford's grinding, sometimes ugly,
but always consistent 10-15 point wins that have
become numbingly impressive.

The Cardinal might have been thrown by Ari
zona a month ago; critics might still contend that
the 68-65 loss proves the Wildcats are a better
team. If Stanford loses to Arizona the last week
end of the season, it would be difficult to argue.
But lately Stanford has been in control.
On offense, the Cardinal has used its depth
and multiple scoring options to take advantage
of what its opponent has given, rather than forc
ing shots and passes.
Defensively, Stanford has been tremendous.
Montgomery's man-to-man has never been
played better; the Cardinal has held its oppo
nents to an NCAA-low 33.7 percent shooting.
The all-time season low was 35.4 percent set by
Marquette in 1994.
Surely there are areas in which Stanford can
improve.
But when given a chance to break down a few
generally perceived weaknesses, Montgomery
bristles at every one.
In the past, opponents have tried to take ad
vantage of Stanford's lack of quickness with a
full-court press. Duke pressed in New York,
Auburn pressed in Anaheim, and U CIA pressed
in Westwood, all to varying degrees of success.
But at least publicly, a more athletic Stanford
team now says, "bring the press on."
" The assumption that we're not good at han
dling pressure is erroneous," Montgomery said.
"A bad pressure team is not going to hurt us at
all. In fact it'd be to their detriment to try it —
we'd rip it."
But what about a team like Michigan State or
Connecticut or Cincinnati that could provide
good pressure?
"Good pressure bothers anybody — if it's
good pressure. But we've not given in at all.
We've made some mistakes offensively, but 1
wouldn't attribute them all to the press," Mont
gomery said.

Senior guard David Moseley said he thought
Stanford's personnel was so capable, it could
even press other teams if it wanted to, instead of
sticking to its stilling half-court defense. He said
the team's skill at handling pressure — and at
handling the ball — has improved a great deal.
"When we played at UCIA, we kind offorgot
about their press and didn't prepare for it before
the game," he said. "We had a little trouble, but
that was just because we weren't ready, not be
cause we can't handle it."
So if that's not a weakness, maybe its the point
guard? Mike McDonald has done a g<xxl job, but
his lack of scoring has raised some eyebrows in
the shadow of Brevin Knight and Art Lee, past
point guards who both loved to score.
"Mike doesn't get enough credit," Mont
gomery said. "He has hit some big shots for us
and when he's hitting for us, that's an added di
mension.
"And defensively, he's been pretty good. [()p
-posing point guards] weren't getting clean looks,
their shooting percentages were down."
With nine games left in the season and a po
tential No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament
lying down the road, Stanford is looking to con
tinue approaching its own exacting standards.
But maybe Moseley, always quick to offer an
opinion, could spot a chink in the armor and
identify what Stanford needs to work 011 as it
runs through the Pac-10 a second time around?
"We can't forget we need to stay within the
context of the offense and make sure we keep
everyone involved," he said.
But has that really been a problem for Stan
ford, a well-balanced team which features seven
players who have led the team in scoring at least
once and five players who average over 10 points
per game?
"No," he said, echoing what seems like a Car
dinal mantra. "We've been doing pretty well."

in Westwood, all to varying degrees of success.
But at least publicly, a more athletic Stanford
team now says, "bring the press on."
" The assumption that we're not good at han
dling pressure is erroneous," Montgomery said.
"A bad pressure team is not going to hurt us at
all. In fact it'd be to their detriment to try it —
we'd rip it."
But what about a team like Michigan State or
Connecticut or Cincinnati that could provide
good pressure?
"Good pressure bothers anybody — if it's
good pressure. But we've not given in at all.
We've made some mistakes offensively, but 1
wouldn't attribute them all to the press," Mont
gomery said.

Senior guard David Moseley said he thought
Stanford's personnel was so capable, it could
even press other teams if it wanted to, instead of
sticking to its stilling half-court defense. He said
the team's skill at handling pressure — and at
handling the ball — has improved a great deal.
"When we played at UCIA, we kind offorgot
about their press and didn't prepare for it before
the game," he said. "We had a little trouble, but
that was just because we weren't ready, not be
cause we can't handle it."
So if that's not a weakness, maybe its the point
guard? Mike McDonald has done a g<xxl job, but
his lack of scoring has raised some eyebrows in
the shadow of Brevin Knight and Art Lee, past
point guards who both loved to score.
"Mike doesn't get enough credit," Mont
gomery said. "He has hit some big shots for us
and when he's hitting for us, that's an added di
mension.
"And defensively, he's been pretty good. [()p
-posing point guards] weren't getting clean looks,
their shooting percentages were down."
With nine games left in the season and a po
tential No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament
lying down the road, Stanford is looking to con
tinue approaching its own exacting standards.
But maybe Moseley, always quick to offer an
opinion, could spot a chink in the armor and
identify what Stanford needs to work 011 as it
runs through the Pac-10 a second time around?
"We can't forget we need to stay within the
context of the offense and make sure we keep
everyone involved," he said.
But has that really been a problem for Stan
ford, a well-balanced team which features seven
players who have led the team in scoring at least
once and five players who average over 10 points
per game?
"No," he said, echoing what seems like a Car
dinal mantra. "We've been doing pretty well."
