Deja vu.
We've seen this story before: A Cardinal freshman bursts
onto the collegiate tennis scene, captures the prestigious Rolex
National Intercollegiate Indoor Championships in Dallas, and
achieves a national ranking of second by mid-February.

Last year, Marissa Irvin caused a stir after launching one of
the most dominating debut campaigns in collegiate history.
This year, Laura Granville has stolen the spotlight.
Over the weekend, Granville confirmed her status as one of
the nation's premiere collegiate competitors, sweeping the
Rolex Championships, the third leg of the collegiate Grand
Slam, without dropping a set.
The second-seeded Granville crushed California's Amy
Jensen en route to the final, where she faced Washington's
Kristina Kraszewski. The Husky's first round upset of Uni
versity of San Diego's Zuzana Lesenarova, the tournament's
top seed, launched her run to the final.
The hard-hitting Kraszewski posed little trouble for
Granville, falling, 6-3, 6-1.
"The final was harder than the score indicated," Granville
said. "She's a great player. I just moved my feet and made sure
I was consistent. It was really exciting to win this tournament."
Granville, who has not lost a match since early January,
now boasts a2l -2 singles record for the season.
"I try not to think about my record," she said. "I just try to
keep on improving."
Sophomore Lauren Kalvaria, who achieved a national
ranking of 13th after posting several breakthrough wins dur
ing preseason play, also made a dent in the Rolex draw.
Kalvaria toppled 12th-ranked Traci Greene of Florida,
26th-ranked Mira Radu of Mississippi, and 6th-ranked Adria
Engel of Wake Forest before succumbing to Kraszewski, 6-0,
6-2, in the semifinals.
"1 was definitely happy with my play," Kalvaria said. "I had
a great string of matches. I came out firing against Fngel and
played a great match. I Iwas] 5-0 against [Kraszewski], and this
was her best match against me. She made very few mistakes.
Every time I hit a second serve, she won the point."
Kalvaria's national ranking will likely improve after her
strong weekend showing.
"My goal is to be in the top five by the end of the year," she
said. "I'm improving, slowly but surely."
Although she was the tournament's defending champion,

Freshman Laura Granville used her composure this past weekend
to capture the Rolex National Intercollegiate Indoor Champi
onships title. Granville is currently the second ranked player in the
nation.
sophomore 11 v in did not qualify
for the* Rolex Championships this
year after failing to accumulate
enough match wins to earn a col
legiate ranking. Irvin has only
played two collegiate matches so
far this season, winning both.
In lieu of collegiate competi
tion, Irvin has participated in sev
eral professional tournaments
over the last few months. At No.
10(5, she is currently the highest
ranked amateur on the Women's
Tennis Association l our. In Jan
uary, she upset 35th-ranked Co
i ina Morariu in the first round of
the Australian Open in Mel
bourne, Australia, before falling
to eventual champion Lindsay
Davenport, 6-4,7-5, in the second
round.
Over the weekend, Irvin won

the $35,000 Challenger tourna
ment in Clearwater, Florida, de
feating top seed Annabel Kllwood
of Australia in the final, 6-4, 6-3.
As an amateur, Irvin is not al
lowed to collect any money from
the competition, but she gained
exposure and experience.
While Irvin has maintained a
low profile in the collegiate tennis
scene so far this season, she will al
most certainly encroach upon
Cranville's ranking over the next
few months, as she plans to partic
ipate in most of the top-ranked
Cardinal's (6-0, 4-0 Pacific 10
Conference) remaining dual
matches, including today's match
against 23rcl-ranked Fresno State
(0-1.0-1).
Last year, the Fresno nearly
beat the Cardinal, leading 4-2 be
fore Stanford rallied for a 5-4 victo
ry.
Today's match will take place at
the Taube Family Tennis Stadium
at 1:30 p.m.
