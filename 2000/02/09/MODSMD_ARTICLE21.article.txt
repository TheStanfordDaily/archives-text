Deja vu.
We've seen this story before: A Cardinal freshman bursts
onto the collegiate tennis scene, captures the prestigious Rolex
National Intercollegiate Indoor Championships in Dallas, and
achieves a national ranking of second by mid-February.

Last year, Marissa Irvin caused a stir after launching one of
the most dominating debut campaigns in collegiate history.
This year, Laura Granville has stolen the spotlight.
Over the weekend, Granville confirmed her status as one of
the nation's premiere collegiate competitors, sweeping the
Rolex Championships, the third leg of the collegiate Grand
Slam, without dropping a set.
The second-seeded Granville crushed California's Amy
Jensen en route to the final, where she faced Washington's
Kristina Kraszewski. The Husky's first round upset of Uni
versity of San Diego's Zuzana Lesenarova, the tournament's
top seed, launched her run to the final.
The hard-hitting Kraszewski posed little trouble for
Granville, falling, 6-3, 6-1.
"The final was harder than the score indicated," Granville
said. "She's a great player. I just moved my feet and made sure
I was consistent. It was really exciting to win this tournament."
Granville, who has not lost a match since early January,
now boasts a2l -2 singles record for the season.
"I try not to think about my record," she said. "I just try to
keep on improving."
Sophomore Lauren Kalvaria, who achieved a national
ranking of 13th after posting several breakthrough wins dur
ing preseason play, also made a dent in the Rolex draw.
Kalvaria toppled 12th-ranked Traci Greene of Florida,
26th-ranked Mira Radu of Mississippi, and 6th-ranked Adria
Engel of Wake Forest before succumbing to Kraszewski, 6-0,
6-2, in the semifinals.
"1 was definitely happy with my play," Kalvaria said. "I had
a great string of matches. I came out firing against Fngel and
played a great match. I Iwas] 5-0 against [Kraszewski], and this
was her best match against me. She made very few mistakes.
Every time I hit a second serve, she won the point."
Kalvaria's national ranking will likely improve after her
strong weekend showing.
"My goal is to be in the top five by the end of the year," she
said. "I'm improving, slowly but surely."
Although she was the tournament's defending champion,
