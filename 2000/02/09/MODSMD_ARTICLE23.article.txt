# Die-hard hockey players wrestle club into playoffs
## 
### 
If we're going to talk about Stanford
hockey, we should get some things right
out in the open.
Yes, Stanford has a hoc key team.
No, we don't have a rink. Sometimes it
might seem like the diamonds, fields,
pools, weight rooms, and squash courts go
on forever, and you figure there's nothing
athletic this campus can't provide. But this
team drives to practice.
Yes, they play against other teams. ()n
the West Coast, as a club team, you don't

have a lot of options.
You play against all
comers, from UCLA
and Cal to Palmer Col
lege of Chiropractic
West.
No, they don't have
any scholarships. When
a starter leaves the
team, all the coaches cau
do is sit back and wait

for someone new to come out.
And yes, people throw fish on the ice at
the games. But only against Cal. And more
often than not, the players throw 'em back.
It's Stanford ice hockey, a club team
with a vision. In a week and a half, they "11
take the ice against USC in the Pacific
Eight Conference semifinals. The Cardi
nal is b-8 in the conference; I SC is 17-0.
The coaches aren't sweating it.
"We've just got to focus on not making
mental mistakes and playing within our
selves," assistant coach Mintak Joo said.
"We know we can't go up there and skate
up and down with them.
Second-year head coach 1) | Nader saws.
"We're coming in as the underdogs, which
we need to use to our advantage . . . We
want to play 'em tight and shut 'em down
and pick our opportunities."
In a lot of ways, that's tin- attitude w itli
which the hockey team has built a pro
gram suddenly on the way up: hoping,
waiting, and jumping on even opportuni
ty it gets.
The origins of the team are lost in the
mists of the 70s, but Joo has seen the
team's ups and downs this clecade. 1 1 s won
its share of accolades; the squad finished
third in the country in the American (Col
legiate Hockey Association's tournament
as an independent in 1995. Then, alter
helping found the Pac-8 in 1995, it went
on to win the league's first two champi
onships in 1996 and 1997.

Without varsity resources, scholar
ships, or recruiting, J oo and Nader have to
sit back each off-season and wait for the
phone to ring, hoping to fill whatever
holes academics or graduation have left in
the team.
"We pretty much cross our fingers and
hope that they come in," Nader said.
Graduation takes its toll, and like everv
club team, hockey loses its share of mem
bers to classes and the Stanford shuffle ol
extracurricular overload.
"If we had all the former hockey play
ers that are here at Stanford out there, we
could field a pretty strong team," saysjoo.
Fortunately, some choose to stick
around. Captains Mike Sloan and Ben
D'Ewart have both played for four years.
"Most people that play hockey [in high
school] will actively seek hockev." Sloan
says."The atmosphere is more fun than
an\ high school hockey I played."
Sloan, from the Los Angeles area, is a
prototype California hockey addict; at
eight years old, he watched a family friend
play and said, "Enough of this AYSO soc -
cer stuff , 1 want to play hockey."
This year particularly, the program
took a big step with the most talented
freshman class in a long time. Freshman
Bobbv Jaros leads the team in goals
scored, and fellow freshman Jay Desai has
started I I games in goal for the Cardinal.
Nader highlights jaros and freshman
Paul Bastian, saving, "You've got a guy
like | Jaros] w ho could be plaving Division
1 hockey. . . he's such an asset to the team.
I here's Paul, who's alwavsopen — lie's al
ways in the right spot at the 1 ight time."
With such a talented core, the coaches
and players alike see a bright future. For
the next step in the future of the program,
everyone on the team points to the same
thing, the 1 IoK (a ail ofclub hockey teams:
its own rink. Ihe dream that seemed far
away five vears ago isn't such a joke any
more; with alumni donations providing
the major potential financial backing,
Nader and the school have been talking in
detail about potential sites for a rink.
"[Having a rink] is a huge recruiting
draw," saysjoo. "If you have a kid out here
on a trip and he has to drive somewhere to
practice and play a game, it makes it hard
er."
Bevond that?

"Teams like Alaska, Arizona,
and Denver, those teams are really
pushing for us to get a Division I
program," Nader says.
Out West, without a youth cul
ture of grade-school leagues and
backyard pond hockey taking the
place of pickup basketball in the
winter, teams get desperate for
competition. I lie NCAA is starting
to cast its glance this way; the Final
l our last year was held in Ana
heim. The host school, though, was
Alaska-Anchorage — the only 1)1
program in the Pacific time /one.
(ioing 1)1 has its hurdles — hall
the team's current roster are grad
students, and starting a varsity pro
gram produces a tangled mess of
Title IX problems. An all-men's
team wouldn't have had Stanford's
Samijo Small, the legendary goal

tender who now plays for the
Canadian women's team, to take
them to a league championship.
But with a nucleus of young tal
ent. financial backing, NCAA inter
est, and a sharp eye for any oppor
tunity to expand, a legitimate
NCAA hoc key program may not
be as far oil as it seems.
"The way hoc key is expanding
on the West (loast and with what is
happening with hockey around
the country, we have an opportu
nity to go NCAA, actually build a
complete hockey program, get a
lot of barking and get a lot of teams
out here doing the same thing,"
Nader says.
Beating I SC next weekend is a
step. The path may lead someday
to yet another NCAA trophy hang
ing in Arrillaga.

If we're going to talk about Stanford
hockey, we should get some things right
out in the open.
Yes, Stanford has a hoc key team.
No, we don't have a rink. Sometimes it
might seem like the diamonds, fields,
pools, weight rooms, and squash courts go
on forever, and you figure there's nothing
athletic this campus can't provide. But this
team drives to practice.
Yes, they play against other teams. ()n
the West Coast, as a club team, you don't

have a lot of options.
You play against all
comers, from UCLA
and Cal to Palmer Col
lege of Chiropractic
West.
No, they don't have
any scholarships. When
a starter leaves the
team, all the coaches cau
do is sit back and wait

for someone new to come out.
And yes, people throw fish on the ice at
the games. But only against Cal. And more
often than not, the players throw 'em back.
It's Stanford ice hockey, a club team
with a vision. In a week and a half, they "11
take the ice against USC in the Pacific
Eight Conference semifinals. The Cardi
nal is b-8 in the conference; I SC is 17-0.
The coaches aren't sweating it.
"We've just got to focus on not making
mental mistakes and playing within our
selves," assistant coach Mintak Joo said.
"We know we can't go up there and skate
up and down with them.
Second-year head coach 1) | Nader saws.
"We're coming in as the underdogs, which
we need to use to our advantage . . . We
want to play 'em tight and shut 'em down
and pick our opportunities."
In a lot of ways, that's tin- attitude w itli
which the hockey team has built a pro
gram suddenly on the way up: hoping,
waiting, and jumping on even opportuni
ty it gets.
The origins of the team are lost in the
mists of the 70s, but Joo has seen the
team's ups and downs this clecade. 1 1 s won
its share of accolades; the squad finished
third in the country in the American (Col
legiate Hockey Association's tournament
as an independent in 1995. Then, alter
helping found the Pac-8 in 1995, it went
on to win the league's first two champi
onships in 1996 and 1997.

Without varsity resources, scholar
ships, or recruiting, J oo and Nader have to
sit back each off-season and wait for the
phone to ring, hoping to fill whatever
holes academics or graduation have left in
the team.
"We pretty much cross our fingers and
hope that they come in," Nader said.
Graduation takes its toll, and like everv
club team, hockey loses its share of mem
bers to classes and the Stanford shuffle ol
extracurricular overload.
"If we had all the former hockey play
ers that are here at Stanford out there, we
could field a pretty strong team," saysjoo.
Fortunately, some choose to stick
around. Captains Mike Sloan and Ben
D'Ewart have both played for four years.
"Most people that play hockey [in high
school] will actively seek hockev." Sloan
says."The atmosphere is more fun than
an\ high school hockey I played."
Sloan, from the Los Angeles area, is a
prototype California hockey addict; at
eight years old, he watched a family friend
play and said, "Enough of this AYSO soc -
cer stuff , 1 want to play hockey."
This year particularly, the program
took a big step with the most talented
freshman class in a long time. Freshman
Bobbv Jaros leads the team in goals
scored, and fellow freshman Jay Desai has
started I I games in goal for the Cardinal.
Nader highlights jaros and freshman
Paul Bastian, saving, "You've got a guy
like | Jaros] w ho could be plaving Division
1 hockey. . . he's such an asset to the team.
I here's Paul, who's alwavsopen — lie's al
ways in the right spot at the 1 ight time."
With such a talented core, the coaches
and players alike see a bright future. For
the next step in the future of the program,
everyone on the team points to the same
thing, the 1 IoK (a ail ofclub hockey teams:
its own rink. Ihe dream that seemed far
away five vears ago isn't such a joke any
more; with alumni donations providing
the major potential financial backing,
Nader and the school have been talking in
detail about potential sites for a rink.
"[Having a rink] is a huge recruiting
draw," saysjoo. "If you have a kid out here
on a trip and he has to drive somewhere to
practice and play a game, it makes it hard
er."
Bevond that?

"Teams like Alaska, Arizona,
and Denver, those teams are really
pushing for us to get a Division I
program," Nader says.
Out West, without a youth cul
ture of grade-school leagues and
backyard pond hockey taking the
place of pickup basketball in the
winter, teams get desperate for
competition. I lie NCAA is starting
