Thinking of movies for two and a box of popcorn?
Fundraisers for the annual Senior Gift program hope
that members of their class will instead donate the
money to their school.
This year, seniors are being asked to donate $20,
in honor of their year of graduation.
The money goes to The Stanford Fund and sup
ports undergraduate education. Officials with the
program say a $20 donation is actually worth much
more as a result of the Matching Gift Program.
"When you give a gift of $20, this amount will be
matched by the Parent's Advisory Board," said
Suzanne Mendoza, director of student development
at the Alumni Association. "Then the $40 will be

matched by [Stanford Trustee] Dr. Peter Bing. So a
$20 gilt will really be valued at $80."
Last year, the Senior Gift generated $ 195,8' Wand
76 percent of the graduating class donated. Accord
ing to Mike Valente. a chair of the current Senior Gift
committee, the con nittee's goal is to break last year's
record of donations.
"It's going to be tough, but we'll be working pret
ty hard," Levante said. "We're really enthusiastic
about it because we know we can do it."
The committee consists of members from different
groups all around campus, and this diversity creates
a large network, said Lynn Ghiu, senior ( lass presi
dent.
"Our approach is a personal approach,'' Ghiu said.
"People [who we cannot directly talk to] will receive
either a letter or a phone call."
ASSU president Mike Levin, a junior, said he re
membered an example of what he called a "very


Information collected by Kathy Wi
strong campaign."
"Last yeai wc were all eating in
tlu- dining lull and President
(lasper just showed up at C'.asa
I taliana," Levin said. "I le was with
the Senior (lilt committee and was
asking people to give senior gifts.
It w;is Inn and really effective in
getting seni(>rs to donate."

"All the money is going right
back to undergraduate educa
tion," Mendoza said. "It provides
continual support for services
available to undergrads, enhanc
ing them and making them avail
able.
Senior class president Doug
Mooney said he believed the im
portance of donations should be
stressed to seniors. He said in

forming students about how their
donations are used is a key goal of
the campaign.
"I'm not sure that lots of seniors
know what their donations go to
ward or how important their con
tribution is to future students,"
Mooney said.
Mendoza also feels that the Se
nior Gift is one way to unite all the
departing students.
"It's building a sense of class
identity for the Class of 2000,"
Mendoza said. "They're giving
back to the University as a class."
Ill is year's senior class also
hopes to break records of partici
pation, Valente said.
Levin said he remembered

high levels of participation in the
past.
"[The Senior Gift committee]
would put out a sign in White
Plaza with some kind of meter in
dicating 0 to 100 percent," Levin
said. "In my three years here I re
member it always being around 70
to 75 percent, which is amazing."
Some students feel it's only fair
to give back to a school that has
given them so much.
"I'd totally donate," said senior
Dave Zhu. "It's just me doing my
small part in giving back to Stan
ford. It's not even that much
money, and I hope the whole class
can get together and contribute
something to a worthwhile cause."
