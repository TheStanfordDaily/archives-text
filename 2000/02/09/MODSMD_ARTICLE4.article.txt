# Reider to step down in June
## Undergrad admission officer headed to high school counseling 
### ANITHA REDDY EDITORIAL STAFF 
After almost 40 years at Stan
ford and 15 with the Office of Un
dergraduate Admissions, Senior
Director of Undergraduate Ad
mission Jon Reider is resigning to
become the director of college
counseling at San Francisco Uni
versity High School.
"1 have grown a little more rest
less with the amount of reading,"
Reider said in an office cluttered
with stacks of lavender folders, on
the floor and his desk, containing
admission applications for the
Class of 2004.
Reider, who teaches in the
Structured Liberal Education
program, said that as an admis
sion officer, it is harder to cultivate
long-term relationships with stu
dents.
"1 miss that connection ... 1
don't have the community I
would like. It's too diffuse and too

large."
"I don't know of any other ad
missions office that is expected to
work at this level," said Reider,
who estimates that Harvard's ad
mission staff is about twice as large
as Stanford's.
"Part of it is space, and part of it
is money," said Reider. "Are they
going to build us a building? I
don' think so."
Two members of the admission
staff, which is housed in the sec
ond floor of Old Union, currently
share an office.
Admission people are gregari
ous by nature, Reider said. "At
other admission offices there's a
lot more mutual consultation,
more committees, more ways to
get people reading [applications]
together," Reider said. "In this of
fice, we're starved for that type of
community."
Reider explained that Stanford
admission officers usually com
municate opinions about an appli
cation by writing comments on a
"workcard" included in each ap
plication folder.
