# Reider to step down in June
## Undergrad admission officer headed to high school counseling 
### ANITHA REDDY EDITORIAL STAFF 
After almost 40 years at Stan
ford and 15 with the Office of Un
dergraduate Admissions, Senior
Director of Undergraduate Ad
mission Jon Reider is resigning to
become the director of college
counseling at San Francisco Uni
versity High School.
"1 have grown a little more rest
less with the amount of reading,"
Reider said in an office cluttered
with stacks of lavender folders, on
the floor and his desk, containing
admission applications for the
Class of 2004.
Reider, who teaches in the
Structured Liberal Education
program, said that as an admis
sion officer, it is harder to cultivate
long-term relationships with stu
dents.
"1 miss that connection ... 1
don't have the community I
would like. It's too diffuse and too

large."
"I don't know of any other ad
missions office that is expected to
work at this level," said Reider,
who estimates that Harvard's ad
mission staff is about twice as large
as Stanford's.
"Part of it is space, and part of it
is money," said Reider. "Are they
going to build us a building? I
don' think so."
Two members of the admission
staff, which is housed in the sec
ond floor of Old Union, currently
share an office.
Admission people are gregari
ous by nature, Reider said. "At
other admission offices there's a
lot more mutual consultation,
more committees, more ways to
get people reading [applications]
together," Reider said. "In this of
fice, we're starved for that type of
community."
Reider explained that Stanford
admission officers usually com
municate opinions about an appli
cation by writing comments on a
"workcard" included in each ap
plication folder.
"There is a conversation, but
it's occurring in writing," Reider
said. "It's very fair, and very
thoughtful. Nobody's opinion is
more important because they're
louder."
Reflecting on his tenure as an
admission officer, Reider said: "I
don't think there's any question
that Stanford has raised the bar in
trying to recruit a more intellectu
al student body."
In 1985 former Dean of Ad
mission Jean Chu received a clear
mandate from the faculty to re
cruit more serious, intellectual
students. To help accomplish that
goal, Chu hired Reider, who has a
doctoral degree from Stanford,
and others with academic back
grounds, as admission officers.
Reider has grappled with the
once common stereotype of Stan
ford students as "well-rounded,
Ail-American, athletic, good-look
ing and friendly."
"I want them to be all of those
things," Reider said, "but I also

want them to be super-sharp."
While both he and Dean of Ad
mission Kinnally will not be re
turning next fall, Reider said he
believes the admission office will
not be overly hurt by the loss of
two senior personnel in one year.
"I do have some knowledge
and experience which will be
hard to replicate," Reider said,
"but I started from scratch."
He also emphasized his deci
sion to step down was not con
nected to kinnally's resignation.
With the University's in
creased financial commitment to
undergraduate education, which
has been manifested in such di
verse ways as freshman seminars
and research grants, Reider said
he "hasn't felt on the defensive
lately," when recruiting students.
As director of college counsel
ing for the small, private San
Francisco University High
School, Reider is confident he will
be able to develop close relation
ships with his advisees.
