# Pro fros may have to sign alcohol contract
## 
### ZACH DILLON 
In light of increasing alcohol
violations during Admit Week
end, the Office of Undergradu
ate Admissions has developed a
preliminary, Admit Weekend
behavioral contract for all
prospective freshmen.
By signing the contract,
prospective freshmen would
agree to comply with expected
behavior in six major areas: Re
spect for Others, Alcohol, Illegal
Drugs, Smoking, Weapons and
Damage to Property. Violation
of the standards could, at worst,
result in withdrawal of Stan
lord's offer of admission.
While the safety of admitted
students has always been a con
cern, a widely-publicized inci

dent last April, in which a 17-
year-old prospective freshman
was sent to Stanford Hospital
after suffering from alcohol poi
soning. has increased concern
about the issues safety and re
sponsibility for admitted stu
dents.
A draft of the proposed con
tract has been presented to resi
dent fellows for feedback. Some
resident staff members have ex
pressed concern about the con
tract, particularly over language
in the contract that some consid
er coercive. In a letter to The
Daily, Lai kin staff members ex
plained why they found the pro
posal objectionable.
"Basically, we don't think it
makes sense to have people sign
a behavioral contract," said Se
nior Michael Cummings, a resi
dent assistant in Larkin and one
of the letter's signees. "It doesn't
treat them with any respect."
Cummings and his fellow
staff members at Larkin fear
that such a contract may send
the wrong message prospective
freshman and their parents —
one that, they say, implies the
I'niversity views its admitted
students as neither mature nor
responsible.
"Does the administration re
ally expect to attract the best
students to Stanford by forcing
them to sign contracts that in
sult theii self-respect?" the let
ter said. "Admits who believe
themselves to be mature and re
sponsible will likely be offended
by having to sign such a con
tract."
Larkin stall members also
said, "Some patents or admits

will assume that firearms, drugs
and alcohol have been endemic
problems during Admit Week
end," a claim that Dean of Ad
missions Robert Kinnally dis
misses. He believes that parents
will instead view the contract as
an effort to ensure the safety of
students.
In addition, Larkin staff said
they fear that prospective fresh
men could come to see resi
dence staff members as police,
watching for violations of the
contract.
"If they do decide to drink,"
Cummings said, "they may de
cide to hide it. In the case of a
medical emergency, they might
not go straight to the residence
staff, whom they would see as
the enforcers."
However, Kinnally empha
sized that the behavioral con
tract idea is only one of many
possible options.
"We have a very large pro
gram that brings a lot of under
age students to Stanford," be ex
plains. "1 his model is just one
approach."
According to Kinnally, the

administration's main concern
is keeping students focused on
the fundamental purpose of
Admit Weekend — to allow ad
mitted students to come and get
a feel for the academic and so
cial community at Stanford. The
administration wants to give the
students a better experience
overall, and they feel that one
way to do this is by implement
ing something such as a behav
ioral contract.
"We've always had something
for the students to sign, because
there have always been con
cerns," said Kinnally. " This new
contract would just outline some
of the points more spec ifically."
From a legal standpoint,
Stanford takes care to ensure
that it cannot be held liable for
any incidents that might occur,
according to acting General
Counsel Debra Zumwalt. How
ever, even after preventive mea
sures, such as the contract, have
been taken, parents can still sue
the University.
"Stanford can get involved in
litigation because it's easy to get
sued even when there is not lia

bility," she said. "We can only be
held liable if University employ
ees act negligently or do some
thing that is criminally wrong."
Because it is so easy for par
ents to sue, Zumwalt said the
University could potentially
incur costs of time and money in
a case that, quite probably, will
be thrown out of court. She went
on to say that University officials
want to do the right thing - such
as making sure that employees
do not provide alcohol to mi
nors or plan unauthorized par
ties - as well as to avoid situa
tions with potential legal conse
quences.
Although RAs are employees
of the University, Zumwalt did
not believe they could be held li
able for an alcohol-related inci
dent.
Kinnally hopes that if a stu
dent comes to Admit Weekend
planning to party, perhaps the
content of the contract will ln.ikj/
them reconsider.
The contract is not a novel
concept, Kinnally said. It is actu
ally based on a similar document
high school students must sign

before attending Stanford's
Summer Session. This docu
ment asks students to act as part
of the Stanford community for a
period of time, reminding them
of the Fundamental Standard
which enrolled students are ex
pected to uphold.
Kinnally said the contract was
addresses the fact that having so
many visitors on campus is an
imposition on current students.
Hopefully, he argues, this be
havioral contract would take
some responsibility away from
House Hosts, the residence staff
and other members of the Stan
lord community.
francos RF Joel Simpson
thinks that it is unfortunate that
such a contract might be re
quired of prospective freshmen,
but lie sees why it may have be
come necessary.
"1 see [Admit Weekend] his
torically as a great time for pro
fros to get a good look at Stan
ford," Simpson said. "Unfortu
nately, there are some individu
als who have seen it as a time to
party in an irresponsible man
ner."

Simpson said it was his un
derstanding that with the new
contract, residence staffs would
undergo more training in order
to handle potential situations
more like they are currently
handled in a dorm setting.
Still, Cummings and the rest
of the staff at Larkin point out
that many prospective freshmen
will still drink whether they sign
a contract or not. If doing so
could threaten the students'
offer of admission from Stan
ford, some feel that this will in
dicate the University would
rather place restrictions on stu
dents that give them responsi
bility.
"We want Admit Weekend to
be safe," write the residence
staff of Larkin House in the let
ter. "But these guidelines are
not a solution. A more produc
tive measure would be to impart
to this year's frosh and other
hosts the importance of respon
sibility and safety during Admit
Weekend, to accept that some
admits may drink, and if they
do, will need safety nets, not po
lice wagons."
