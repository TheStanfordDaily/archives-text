# Want to coterm? You're not alone
## Coterm numbers grow as students discover an educational bargain 
### DENNIS TYLER 
If you've been seeing a few more faces
around your department for a fifth year, you're
not going crazy.
Almost a quarter of each Stanford class takes
advantage of coterminal bachelor's / master's
degree programs offered by 39 of Stanford's (i 1
departments.
And the numlxM* could l>e on the rise. Total
acceptance numbers for this year aren't in yet,
but the 07 students accepted into coterm pro
grams during fall quarter is more than double
the number accepted in fall 1998.
During the 1997-1998 school year, depart
ments admitted 352 coterms. year, the
University t<x>k in 300 total.
Coterm programs allow some students "to
get a master's degree in one year instead of the
typical two-year program for master's stu
dents," said history senior Megan Tompkins,
who recently applied for her department's
coterm program.

However, the process for applying to coterm
is not easy.
Students interested in a coterm program
must first obtain a "Petition for Admission to the
Coterminal Program" and a "Coterminal De
gree Program Proposal" and then submit these
documents to their respective departments for
review by their departments' graduate admis
sions office.
Unlike undergraduate admissions, graduate
admissions are done by individual depart
ments.
Once this is completed, students must also
submit other required material, which varies
between departments. Usually such require
ments include Graduate Record Examination
scores, recommendations and transcripts.
To be eligible for coterm consideration, stu
dents can apply no later than the third week of
their eleventh quarter as a Stanford under
graduate.
The number of quarters a student has been
at Stanford is determined by the number of
units the student has accumulated, including all
transfer and summer units, at 15 units per
quarter.
"Because I had a lot of transfer units from

my AP credits," said senior Ross Venook, who
lias recently been accepted into the Electrical
Engineering coterm program, "I had some se
rious bureaucratic problems when applying for
coterm."
"Anyone interested in coterming needs to
walk into their department and talk to anyone
in charge of unit totals as soon as possible,"
Venook said.
According to Justin Ewer, a current history
coterm," the coterm process is definitely not for
everybody."
"Although it is a great opportunity for un
dergraduates to remain at the same university
with many of the prof essors they are already fa
miliar with and gain a master's degree," he said,
"the work is much more demanding than as an
undergraduate."
Additionally, coterm students are offered no
financial aid.
"While students may apply for student loans
and jobs, students enrolling for coterminal de
grees are not eligible for Stanford University
scholarships and grants, unless they can do
their coterm within their four years as an un-
