ANNOUNCEMENTS
AWAKE!
In 1929 J. D. Bernal expanded on
the idea of space colonies. If only
the world's R&D "experts" had
comprehended the potential
magnitude of the idea. By now
we'd have colonies throughout
the solar system & on their way to
all stars within ~ 50 light years.
With our foot dragging lack of
enthusiasm we have shown
humans to be no different than
ants or termites on our little
colony Earth. Let's give up
following the bunglers & finally
get started in the right direction.
That is implementation on the
Gerard K. O'Neill Model with a
new grass roots type
organization. As Ray Bradbury
phrased it in his 1977 introductory
paragraph for Heppenheimer's
"Colonies In Space": Let's move,
Let's go there, Let's do the job.
Mr, Heppenheimer
offers you citizenship in the
Universe. Ideas / Comments?
