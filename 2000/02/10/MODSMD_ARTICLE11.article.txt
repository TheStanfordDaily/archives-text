The second Sophomore Academic Dinner will
take plat e next Wednesday, and the deadline to apply
is tomorrow. More than :"»<)() sophomores will get the
chance to attend the formal dinner, which will bring
together sophomores, faculty members and alumni.
The dinner, like the first one on Jan. 11, is geared
toward sophomores who didn't attend Sophomore
College and are undeclared. 1 he idea is to give stu
dents an opportunity to foc us on t heir academic ca
reers and to closely interact with faculty members in
side and outside of their main areas of interest.
At each dinner table, six sophomores interested in
an academic discipline related to a faculty member
and an aluinnus's field of specialization will be en
couraged to ask. questions about the department.
In return, representative faculty members will
talk about their fields while alumni will provide in
sights as former students who studied in the field.
"1 think the first dinner went really well. We re
ceived so many compliments on it, especially on the
intimate setting which provided people with a
chance to ask a professor for advice on courses or
even to be their adviser," said kalhy Huang, one of
the sophomore ( lass presidents.
"Although it takes a tremendous amount of time
and eflbrt, n is definitely a worthwhile event. This is
the first vear these dinners have ever been clone, but

we hope this becomes a sophomore tradition."
Administration officials like the initiative as well.
"I think this program has been a wonderful addi
tion to the sophomore year and has been enthusias
tically received by many sophomores," said Nanci
Howe, assistant dean of students and director of stu
dent activities, who assisted in planning the dinners.
Professors at the last event included Electrical En
gineering Prof . Brad Osgood, Economics Prof. John
Pencavel, Earth Systems Prof. Lynn ()rr, Political Sci
ence Prof. Stephen Krasner and twenty others.
"I was particularly happy upon knowing that at
the end of the event, Krasner offered [to be] the ad
viser ... to one of the students sitting on the table,"
said Andres Small, a sophomore class president.
Names of professors who will be attending next
week's dinner are not being released, as organizers
want to encourage students to apply out of interest in
the departments, not specific faculty members.
1 luangand Small said much of the success and fu
ture implementations of this event depend on its
funding sources, which include the Stanford Fund,
the Alumni Association, the School of Engineering
and the Vice Provost of Student Affairs.
