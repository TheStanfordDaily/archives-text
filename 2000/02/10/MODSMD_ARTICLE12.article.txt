## Thousands of workers go on strike at Boeing Co. 
### 
RKNTON, Wash. (AP) — More than 1 (),()()() engi
neers and technical workers at Boeing Co. walked oft'
the job yesterday in one of the biggest white-collar
strikes in U.S. history.
Production at the world's largest airplane maker
continued without interruption because assembly
employees belong to a separate union and have a
clause in their contract requiring them to work
regardless of what other Boeing employees do.
L he Society of Professional Kngineering Employ
ees in Aerospace, which represents about 10 percent
of Boeing's work force, went on strike after contract
talks broke down Tuesday night. No further talks
were scheduled.
Members of the union — who are involved in such
fields as research and development, designing of
planes and overseeing production work — left their
jobs at Boeing ollices and plants throughout the Seat
tle area at 9 a.m.
"I just went to work, shut down my computer,
copied my hard drive to Zip disks and got the hell out
of there," said Stan Sorscher, a physicist who led one
of the negotiating teams.
Union members gathered lor a rally and march at
Renton Memorial Stadium, near the factory where
Boeing builds 737 and 757 jetliners. Phe crowd
cheered as union executive director Charles Boft'erd
ing said Boeing negotiators "thought they could bully

us, and they were wrong."
Boeing has said a strike would not affect the build
ing of aircraft. 1 lowever, if the walkout were to last lot
a couple of weeks, it could interfere with the inspec
tion and delivery of aircraft to airlines.
Boeing spokesman Peter B. Conte said yesterday
the company was still measuring the effects of the
walkout.
"Obviously we are disappointed that we were
unable to reach an acceptable solution through the
course of mediation in the past two days," he said.
"Boeing is a company that strives to work with unions
to negotiate in good faith and to be fair and reason
able in the offers it makes."
The union has sought more guaranteed pay raises
and bonuses similar to those received by the T(i,()()0-
member Machinists union. Boeing has insisted on
mostly selective pay increases, reductions in life insur
' ance benefits and some changes in health insurance.
In negotiations last year, the Machinists won annu
al raises of 4 percent, 4 percent and 3 percent in a
three-year contract, plus a 10 percent signing bonus.
Boeing's most recent offer was narrowly defeated
by members of the white-collar union, 51 percent to
40 percent.
1 his is the first full-scale strike in the union's 56-
year history. The union's only previous strike was a
symbolic one-day walkout in 1992.
