### 
COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -
Alter spending more than $66
million of his own money in a
relentless six-year hid lor politi
cal viability, Republican publish
er Steve Forbes abandoned his
second presidential campaign

yesterday with little to show lor
his investment.
The shy, bookish conservative
called it quits after third-place
finishes in the New Hampshire
and Delaware primaries, accord
ing to advisers who said Forbes

would announce the decision
today in Washington.
Mis departure triggered a
scramble among the remaining
contenders for his anti-abortion,
anti-tax supporters on the con
servative right. It also set the
stage for a two-way race between
national front-runner (leorge W.
Bush and Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, the surging underdog.
"I'm going to be working
hard to appeal to his voters."
Bush said, as he prepared for a
dash with McCain in this slate's
Feb. 19 primary.
Fresh off a landslide victory in
New Hampshire. McCain made
a bid Ibi Forbes' supporters.
"Most Republicans think my
tax cut. . .is fiu more conserva
tive than Covernor Bush's tax
plan. I think they'll be headed in
m\ direction," he said, between
campaign stops.
I he appeals underscored that
Forbes, more than the previous
six COI* candidates who
dropped out of the race, left his
mark on the political scene he
failed to conquer.
I lis flat income tax plan
became a national issue in his
failed 1996 presidential race, and
ibis year lie helped popularize
COP economic themes such as
health care savings accounts.
He also is one of the OOP's
top fund-raising attractions.
Fxit polls in the first three
contests showed that Forbes
fined best among voters whose
top priority was taxes.
He also did well with people
looking for a candidate who
stands up for what he believes.
In the end, Forbes failed to
convince Republicans that he
could win in November.

"I lis candidacy failed to con
ned with Republicans outside ol
social conservatives in lowa. All
the money in the world isn't
going to change that," said OOP
strategist Scott Reed, who man
aged Boh Dole's 199f> campaign
which was damaged by an
onslaught of critical Forbes ads.
Republican analvsts said Bush
stood to gain most because
Forbes had siphoned conserva
tive voters from him.
McC ain may pick up Forbes
backers who are tired of the
pavtv establishment, but the
impact is probably marginal l ,
analysts said.
"Presumably the advantage
goes to Bush, but the truth is
(Forbes) doesn't have enough
support in the upcoming pri
maries to reallv make a difler
ence," said Republican consul
tant Fon\ Fabri/io.
Forbes, in Michigan for a
series of campaign events, can
celed yesterday's schedule and
(lew to New Jersey after finaliz
ing his decision and informing
staff, according to two senior
advisers who spoke on condition
of anonymitv.
I le had no immediate plans to
endorse Bush or McCain, and
supporters said he still resented
efforts by the Texas governor's
campaign to undermine his pres
idential bid.
Bush's campaign hoped to
mend some ol its fences through
intermediaries.
()ne acl\ iser said Forbes made
a tentative decision to quit the
race over the weekend, but
hoped for a better showing in
Delaware to keep him alive in
case a McCain win in South Car
olina scrambled the political mix.
