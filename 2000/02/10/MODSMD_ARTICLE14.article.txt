MAYA BAY, Thailand (AP) â€” 'The Beach,"
which premiered in London yesterda\ starring
Leonardo DiCaprio, tells the story of an amoral
backpacker whose quest tor the perfect tropical
beach leads him to a secret commune on a
remote Thai island.
Ltopia isn't quite what it seems and paradise
turns into bloody savagery.
Likewise, the image of sunny, sandy pet lec
tion achieved in making the 20th Century Fox
film has destroyed the once-pristine beach
where it was shot, environmentalists say. Maya
Bay, a strip of sand and vegetation backed by
dramatic c lills, is located on I'lii Leh island, part
of a national park about '150 miles south ol

Bangkok.
Many ol its islands have been blighted In
developers who bribed corrupt officials to look
the other way while bungalows and hotels
sprang up in theoretically protected areas. I'hi
I.eh and the beach at Maya Ba\ were largely
spared, providing a setting worth) of Alex (lar
land's best-selling novel.
But tor filmmakers, led by director Danny
Boyle .md producer Andrew Macdonald, who
earned fame with "Shallow Crave" and
" Trainspotting," it wasn't quite perfect enough.
Alter obtaining permits from the Forestry
Department and paying a $1 10,000 damage
deposit, the filmmakers brought in bulldozers

to widen and flatten the beach and strip away
native grasses, scrub and other vegetation. I'hey
also removed a lot of garbage that had washed
ashore.
Seizing on the film's high profile, activists
who had for vears unsuccessfully campaigned
against the environmental damage to Thai
land's parks joined with local residents in a
sci it-s of'demoustrations.
Fhe filmmakers pledged to restore the
beach to its original state and set stakes in the
sand to prevent erosion. It became clear at the
end of the monsoon season that the stakes
didn't work nearly as well as native vegetation.
Far more sand was washed away than usual.
