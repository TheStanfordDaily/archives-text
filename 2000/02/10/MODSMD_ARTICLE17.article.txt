## The
						Stanford Daily Admit Weekend plan sends the wrong message 
### 
Published Since J 891

IN RESPONSE TO the well-publi
cized string of unpleasant events
during Admit Weekend in the past,
the Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions has drafted a behavioral contract that
prospective students might be required to
sign before participating in Admit Week
end.
The document, which covers the six
areas: Respect for Others, Alcohol, Illegal
Drugs, Smoking, Weapons and Damage to
Property, stipulates that any violation of the
standards set forth in the contract could, at
worst, result in a withdrawal of the offer of
admission from the University.
While the University is justified in its con
cerns over some of the events that have
taken place in recent years and would want
to prevent them in the future, implement
ing this contract is not the appropriate

response. The proposed contract, if adopt
ed, would damage the level of trust that
currently exists between students and the
University administration and, undoubted
ly, do more harm than good.
To begin with, requiring admits and their
parents to sign a sternly-worded behavioral
contract such as this as a condition for
attending Admit Weekend, seems overly
coercive and appears to make an unfair
assumption of guilt on the part of these stu
dents. It only serves to dampen the gener
ally exciting atmosphere of Admit Weekend
and lays the groundwork for an adversarial
relationship between students and the
administration.
In addition, it would give the wrong
impression to students and their parents,
that such problems are commonplace at
Stanford, when, in fact, they are anything

but the norm.
Furthermore, it is unclear whether such
a contract would actually deter prospective
students from drinking and engaging in
the anti-social behavior that the University
wants to prevent. With the wide availability
of alcohol on this campus, it might be naive
to think that a contract might prevent stu
dents from drinking.
It is quite likely that such a document
would only force the problem under
ground and thereby turn resident assistants
and other staff during Admit Weekend into
"alcohol-police," a role which they are not
accustomed to and one which is against the
principles which guide student conduct at
this University, namely the Fundamental
Standard.
The proposed contract would not even
solve the issue of the litigation in case of

injury or harm to a prospective student.
The University already has other means ol
ensuring that it won't be held liable for any
incidents that could occur, and this docu
ment could still not prevent parents from
filing lawsuits against the University.
According to acting General Counsel,
Debra Zumwalt, "Stanford can get involved
in litigation because it's easy to get sued
even when there is not liability."
Asking students to sign a document
ensuring that they will abide to general
rules of proper behavior and observe all
University regulations when they come to
Admit Weekend is a reasonable request.
However, to word the document in an
apparently hostile and confrontational
manner is a serious mistake and creates a
bad precedent for a future relationship that
must be based upon trust and openness.
