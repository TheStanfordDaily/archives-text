# CHOKING ON CELEBRITY: THE PRICE OF FAME
## The
						horrors of Pokémon

(let tliec behind me, Pokemon. Burger
King and the U.S. government have
stepped up their recall ellbrt alter a sec
ond c hild's death involving suffocation on
,i "Poke-ball." This little plastic sphere,
included with kids' meals, splits apart to
reveal one of the 57 adorable little mon
sters. Unfortunately, it also tends to get
stuck in the mouths of small children.
I he bright side according to Burger
King is that only the balls, not the toys, are
dangerous, so children under three can
continue to gnaw awav on their I'okemon
ol choice with impunity.
The I'okemon corporation presumably
expects that this will cause strong emo
tional imprinting at an early age, so that
when the c hildren enter the lucrative 7 to
12 demographic a lew years down the
load they will purchase the little buggers
in mass quantities and keep them from
going the \va) of Yoltron. As icing on the
cake, Butger King is giving away a free
small order ol Irene h fries to anyone who
letin lis ,i hike-ball to the restaurant.
Less lcth.il but more subtly disturbing
is the case ol the- loul-mouthed Pikachu
sold .it K-Marts in Howell, Michigan. A
talking figurine ol the yellow, vaguely
mammalian Pokemon character — guar
anteed to register .is the c utest of the 57 in
.iti\ preteen snrve\ — reportedly spouts
"an obscenitN containing the I'-word" if its
button is pressed repeatedly.
"Vim shouldn't have to worry about
what <i tov is going to s.iv," says an irate
mother, displaying the same naive faith in

corporate benevolence which causes us to
overlook the hidden genitalia in Disney
animated features.
A spokeswoman for K-Mart shifted the
blame, announcing that "we ask that all
parents use good judgment and play with
a toy before giving it to a c hild." We can
only hope that the c hildren are following
this debate, since it teaches an important
lesson about accountability: Make sure it
ain't yours.
All things considered, a bit of sexual
slang isn't such a bad addition to
Pikachu's vocabulary, since technically
Pokemon can only say their own names.
In this they display an egocentric ism rem
iniscent of many other American celebri
ties, though they do outclass the competi
tion in other respects.
For instance, they can evolve into more
mature and developed life-forms —
unlike, say, Britney Spears, who is unlike
ly ever to leave the larval girl-child stage.
Nevertheless, there is an eerie corre
spondence between the ability of Poke
mon to capture other Pokemon — once
caught, they become your helpers — and
schemes such as the U.S. military's cur
rent plan to recruit reluctant teens via
Hollywood. Secretary of Defense William
Cohen recently announced that he had
spoken with several household names,
including Torn Cruise, Steven Spielberg
and |ulia Roberts, about the possibility ol
doing public -service spots "saying positive
things about the military."
