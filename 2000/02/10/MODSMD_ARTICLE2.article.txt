Party hats, fireworks, the ball dropping in
New York City's Times Square and clinking
champagne glasses with your Aunt Myrtle:
these are all symbols most Americans associate
with New Year celebrations every Jan. 1.
However, for Chinese Americans, the new
year began last Saturday.
The new year celebration, which actually
lasts 15 days, occurs on a different day every
year â€” the first day of the Chinese Lunar cal
endar.
For some, this holiday is the most impor
tant event in the year.
"It's like Thanksgiving and Christmas put
together for Chinese people," sophomore
Elita Cheung said. "It's analogous to a
Thanksgiving gathering for Americans where
all the family members should be present, eat

Chinese New Year's
Foods' Meanings

Fish long life
Chicken fertility
Red Meat to be avoided
Melon Seeds proliferation
Red Dotes hope for prosperity
LotllS Seeds prosperity over time
Oranges/Tangerines good fortune
and just be together."
This new year isn't just a party. Tradition
dictates that houses be cleaned, lots of food be
prepared and good luck be wished to all.

"It is a time to remember my roots, my
family, and what ties have held us all togeth
er," sophomore Nina Polvanich said. "It's a
time for optimism and new beginnings, to
start anew while also holding onto tradi
tion."
Also, Chinese tradition calls for the family
to re-unite for meals and quality time at the
new year, but this is difficult for some Stanford
students because they're far from home.
Polvanich, who is from Houston, said the
distance between her and her family is always
particularly trying during this time of the
year.
"Not being at home is horrible," she said.
"Chinese New Year's was always one of the
biggest, if not the biggest, holidays of the year,
and being away is almost like not celebrating
at all."
