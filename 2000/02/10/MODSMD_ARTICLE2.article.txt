# Stanford students usher in Chinese New Year
## 
### MEREDITH ROWE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Party hats, fireworks, the ball dropping in
New York City's Times Square and clinking
champagne glasses with your Aunt Myrtle:
these are all symbols most Americans associate
with New Year celebrations every Jan. 1.
However, for Chinese Americans, the new
year began last Saturday.
The new year celebration, which actually
lasts 15 days, occurs on a different day every
year â€” the first day of the Chinese Lunar cal
endar.
For some, this holiday is the most impor
tant event in the year.
"It's like Thanksgiving and Christmas put
together for Chinese people," sophomore
Elita Cheung said. "It's analogous to a
Thanksgiving gathering for Americans where
all the family members should be present, eat

Chinese New Year's
Foods' Meanings

Fish long life
Chicken fertility
Red Meat to be avoided
Melon Seeds proliferation
Red Dotes hope for prosperity
LotllS Seeds prosperity over time
Oranges/Tangerines good fortune
and just be together."
This new year isn't just a party. Tradition
dictates that houses be cleaned, lots of food be
prepared and good luck be wished to all.

"It is a time to remember my roots, my
family, and what ties have held us all togeth
er," sophomore Nina Polvanich said. "It's a
time for optimism and new beginnings, to
start anew while also holding onto tradi
tion."
Also, Chinese tradition calls for the family
to re-unite for meals and quality time at the
new year, but this is difficult for some Stanford
students because they're far from home.
Polvanich, who is from Houston, said the
distance between her and her family is always
particularly trying during this time of the
year.
"Not being at home is horrible," she said.
"Chinese New Year's was always one of the
biggest, if not the biggest, holidays of the year,
and being away is almost like not celebrating
at all."



Some Stanford organizations are try
ing to ease this separation pain by hold
ing celebrations of their own. The Stan
lord Vietnamese Student Association, for
example, held a lunar new year let festi
val.
Additionally, the Department of Asian
Languages will be holding a luncheon
this Saturday at Escondido Village. All
students taking Chinese language courses
are invited to attend, and each individual
class will perform singing and music.
Food will be provided by a local Chinese
restaurant and students will make their
own dumplings.
The meal might help to provide some
semblance of home for students, as typi
cally a family meal is the focal point of the
celebration.
Much attention is paid to the food
served during new year's meals.
Chicken is almost always a course,
because it symbolizes fertility in Chinese
superstition. Also, the dinner usually

includes eight or nine plates of food,
because eight means wealth and nine
means fullness. No family will ever serve
only four dishes, because four symbol
izes death. However, phrases containing
four words or Chinese characters are
good.
"There's a Chinese saying 'big fish, big
meat' which implies that a good meal is
where there's good seafood as well as
good meat," sophomore Eric Wong said.
"All wise, profound Chinese sayings are
four characters."
"All of the kids [in the family] wish the

elderly 'happy new year,' and say the
traditional sayings of good wishes," Che
ung said. " There are all four-character
phrases, used especially during the new
year."
For those who hail from the Bay Area,
going home for the holiday is not only
possible, it's a certainty.
"It's a Chinese tradition to go home on
the eve of the new year," Cheung said.
"Being at Stanford is not really hindering
me from going back home.
"I just realized how important
this tradition is to me," she added.
"I definitely want to preserve it
and continue it as 1 grow older.
Cetting together with my family
and relatives, even il it is just to eat
a meal, is quite essential to the Chi
nese culture. And I realize it's pret
ty important to me too."
In addition to the traditional
meal, Chinese families also play
games, such as Mali Jong, and dis
tribute red envelopes containing
money, (llieung said.
"Red is a very important color

to Chinese people," Wong said.
"It's used from weddings to the
new year as a color of prosperity
and fortune. The envelope con
tains cash these days as a little gift
of 'here, take this bag of good luck,'
sort of like I wish you good luck
and prosperity."
"Money is pretty much a gift the
same way that we get Christmas
presents," Chen added. "For basi
cally any Chinese celebration the
red envelope with money in it is an
appropriate gift."
Extended family is important,
and some Chinese-American stu
dents have local relatives to turn to
during the holiday.
This new year, I went to eat din
ner at a restaurant with mv relatives,"

said sophomore Cynthia Chen, who
is from Los Angeles, but has rela
tives in the San Francisco area.
"We're pretty much American
ized and we celebrate the Ameri
can new year as well as the Chinese
one. At home we played the tradi
tional games and had a general cel
ebration, but here, my relatives are
not as into it and thus the new year
has been much less in the way of a
celebration lor me."
Though'the means of celebra
tion may change during the col
lege years, most agree that the
event will always hold a special
place in their lives.
"It is more about getting to
gether with family to celebrate
than anything else," Chen said.
