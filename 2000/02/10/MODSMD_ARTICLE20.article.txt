Abortion debate continues
Vincent James Strickler and Brendan
Stnhan arc fully entitled to llieir opinions
oil abortion, though I wish to challenge
Brednan's assertion that Stanford Stu
dents for Life are without a similar
rhetoric to the Students for Choice.
I found that all his letter consisted of
was rhetoric, not content. Comparing
abortion to the Holocaust and slavery is a
meaningless, inflammatory move which
will never allow the many sides of the com
plicated abortion issue to come together in
fruitful discussion. It will only up the ante
in this already too emotional debate and
result in further destruction such as clinic
bombings.
I would also ask Brendan to check his
facts. He states that "because women have
complete sexual freedom, men have no
responsibility for their sexual choices...
and treat men like sexual objects." First, in

no country in the world do women have
complete sexual freedom. The lack of ade
quate sexual education, contraception and
free access to abortion ensure that women
are the ones denied responsibility for their
sexual c hoic es.
Secondly, the historical and contempo
rary lack of sexual and reproductive
autonomy for women has never caused
men to act more sexually responsible or
treat women less like sexual objects, and I
fail to see how banning abortion could cre
ate more equal conditions between men
and women.
Even more importantly, though, the
purpose of abortion is not to change male
behavior, but to provide women with the
right to control their own bodies and be
able to make the best decisions for them
selves. Perhaps if Vincent and Brendan
took a less androcentric view of abortion
— in which the key issues are the behav
iors and rights of men — they would be

able to see why it's important for women
to have the legal right to abortion and full
self-determination.
What is needed in the abortion debate
— which ideally the well-educated and
open-minded Stanford students on both
sides of the issues could provide — is the
setting aside of prejudice and rhetoric for
a level-headed conversation about how
common ground, not violence, can be
reached.

In response to Mr. Strickler and Mr.
Stuhan:
The title of the column that Ms. Reeds
and Ms. Schmidt wrote for The Daily on
Feb. 3 was not duplicitous. Their point
was well made that getting involved in
activism about something important to
you is a great way to get rid of malaise

(and apathy), to become part of a commu
nity, to shed the illusion of the Stanford
bubble and a host of other benefits. I
applaud them.
As for Mr. Stuhan's final epithet, that
Ms. Reeds and Ms. Schmidt represent a
"radical viewpoint and group," it is mis
leading and inaccurate.
Although the advance of women's
rights has been a long struggle that con
tinues to this day, on the cusp of the new
millenium, most people, especially in our
generation, understand that reproductive
choice is necessary, and a right of women.
The reality is that criminalizing it does
not make abortion go away — it just
means that more women die from unsafe
abortions. Women need access to safe,
legal abortions, as well as contraception,
and comprehensive, healthy sexuality
education. That is what pro-choice means.
I do not know either of the two gentle
men who have written in the past two

days, so I am not in a position to say any
thing about their views other than what
was written. Unfortunately, on a state and
