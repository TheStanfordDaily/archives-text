Abortion debate continues
Vincent James Strickler and Brendan
Stnhan arc fully entitled to llieir opinions
oil abortion, though I wish to challenge
Brednan's assertion that Stanford Stu
dents for Life are without a similar
rhetoric to the Students for Choice.
I found that all his letter consisted of
was rhetoric, not content. Comparing
abortion to the Holocaust and slavery is a
meaningless, inflammatory move which
will never allow the many sides of the com
plicated abortion issue to come together in
fruitful discussion. It will only up the ante
in this already too emotional debate and
result in further destruction such as clinic
bombings.
I would also ask Brendan to check his
facts. He states that "because women have
complete sexual freedom, men have no
responsibility for their sexual choices...
and treat men like sexual objects." First, in

no country in the world do women have
complete sexual freedom. The lack of ade
quate sexual education, contraception and
free access to abortion ensure that women
are the ones denied responsibility for their
sexual c hoic es.
Secondly, the historical and contempo
rary lack of sexual and reproductive
autonomy for women has never caused
men to act more sexually responsible or
treat women less like sexual objects, and I
fail to see how banning abortion could cre
ate more equal conditions between men
and women.
Even more importantly, though, the
purpose of abortion is not to change male
behavior, but to provide women with the
right to control their own bodies and be
able to make the best decisions for them
selves. Perhaps if Vincent and Brendan
took a less androcentric view of abortion
— in which the key issues are the behav
iors and rights of men — they would be

able to see why it's important for women
to have the legal right to abortion and full
self-determination.
What is needed in the abortion debate
— which ideally the well-educated and
open-minded Stanford students on both
sides of the issues could provide — is the
setting aside of prejudice and rhetoric for
a level-headed conversation about how
common ground, not violence, can be
reached.

In response to Mr. Strickler and Mr.
Stuhan:
The title of the column that Ms. Reeds
and Ms. Schmidt wrote for The Daily on
Feb. 3 was not duplicitous. Their point
was well made that getting involved in
activism about something important to
you is a great way to get rid of malaise

(and apathy), to become part of a commu
nity, to shed the illusion of the Stanford
bubble and a host of other benefits. I
applaud them.
As for Mr. Stuhan's final epithet, that
Ms. Reeds and Ms. Schmidt represent a
"radical viewpoint and group," it is mis
leading and inaccurate.
Although the advance of women's
rights has been a long struggle that con
tinues to this day, on the cusp of the new
millenium, most people, especially in our
generation, understand that reproductive
choice is necessary, and a right of women.
The reality is that criminalizing it does
not make abortion go away — it just
means that more women die from unsafe
abortions. Women need access to safe,
legal abortions, as well as contraception,
and comprehensive, healthy sexuality
education. That is what pro-choice means.
I do not know either of the two gentle
men who have written in the past two

days, so I am not in a position to say any
thing about their views other than what
was written. Unfortunately, on a state and
national level, the groups that lobby for
limitations on access to abortions are the
same ones that pushed for the current
federal program that gives more funding
to abstinence-only sex education curricu
la. On this basis, it doesn't seem unreason
able to call these people anti-choice.
This is a very sensitive issue, and I hope
that any further discussion remains
respectful of that reality and of the diver
sity of viewpoints and experiences repre
sented.
Though 1 am not a member of Stan
ford Students for Choice, I am glad to see
them getting started. It is appropriate to
look at power, specifically political power,
when thinking about access to reproduc
tive rights.
After all, why is it that Viagra is covered
by health insurance, and the birth control
pill isn't necessarily?
LAURAJEAN TORCiERSON
Junior, Classics

In his Feb. 7 letter to the editor, Vin
cent James Strickler falsely equates being
pro-choice with being pro-abortion. As
Elizabeth Reeds and Erin Schmidt stated
in their Feb. 3 guest column, being pro
choice means more than supporting a
woman's right to choose; it also means
linking choice with broader issues of
reproduction, contraception, education,
healthy families, women's higher educa
tion and careers and cultural attitudes
towards sexuality.
Strickler attributes unplanned preg
nancy to irresponsible behavior by men
and women who "are unprepared to
accept the consequences." Yet, many
opponents of access to abortion also
oppose sex education and access to con
traception, making responsible sexual
behavior far more difficult.
Approximately 80% of adolescent
youth are sexually active (Miller 8c
Moore, 1990); yet only one-third use con
traception (Hayes, 1987), due to a lack of
access, education and cultural acceptance
of safe sex. Until this society empowers
young women to use — and demand that

their partners use — contraception, until
this society teaches young men to protect
themselves and their partners, women will
face unwanted pregnancies.
And what of the consequences?
Unwanted and unplanned births (espe
cially among young mothers) may result
in severely limited educational and career
opportunities for the mother, a greater
incidence of poverty and health problems
for mother and child, and a greater risk of
child abuse and neglect, among other
damaging outcomes (Steinberg, 1999).
Our society has not yet demonstrated a
willingness to provide a secure and
healthy life for our children who are in
poverty. To require women to bear chil
dren whom they cannot support physical
ly or emotionally simply perpetuates
injustice from one generation to the next.
Where are the "pro-life" activists when it
comes time to fund schools, domestic vio
lence shelters, medical and mental health
services, and yes, even welfare for women
and children?
I have spoken with other women at
Stanford about what decision we would
make if faced with an unplanned preg
nancy tomorrow. None of us had an

instant, easy answer. Women considering
abortion must weigh their values and
beliefs, financial situation, education and
career opportunities and the reactions of
friends, family and society at large.
Clearly, women do not have sex think
ing of abortion as an easy form of birth
control: we do not and cannot take abor
tion lightly.
Abortion is never an easy choice, but it
is a choice that must remain available to
women.

Egg donor ads raise questions
I have recently become concerned with
the advertising content of The Daily.
Tuesday's advertisement asking for an
egg donor, compensated to the tune of
$100,000, has caused me to re-examine
my already low expectations for this
paper.
While not showing quite as much poor
taste as previous advertisements (which
have gone as far as to dictate the eye color,
height, and SAT scores of prospective

donors), this week's version does stipulate
that the donor have "proven college level
athletic ability."
In my mind, this raises a couple of
questions. Would the couple take an
ovum from a woman with only high
school athletic experience for the bargain
basement price of only $19,999.99? Or
how about from a donor who failed
junior high F.E. classes for a mere
$9,999.99? Or how about this one: why
does The Daily, which supposedly repre
sents the student body of one of the most
respected academic and research institu
tions in the world, choose to be an accom
plice to the wholesale marketing of
human life?
With all of the neglected children in
both our nation and the world today, is it
really in our best interests to allow the rich
to custom design their families? I urge
The Daily to stop carrying these and relat
ed advertisements. While it may be diffi
cult to make up for the lost revenue and
space, I'm certain that your talented stafl
can cope. Best of luck,

Egg donor ads raise questions
I have recently become concerned with
the advertising content of The Daily.
Tuesday's advertisement asking for an
egg donor, compensated to the tune of
$100,000, has caused me to re-examine
my already low expectations for this
paper.
While not showing quite as much poor
taste as previous advertisements (which
have gone as far as to dictate the eye color,
height, and SAT scores of prospective

donors), this week's version does stipulate
that the donor have "proven college level
athletic ability."
In my mind, this raises a couple of
questions. Would the couple take an
ovum from a woman with only high
school athletic experience for the bargain
basement price of only $19,999.99? Or
how about from a donor who failed
junior high F.E. classes for a mere
$9,999.99? Or how about this one: why
does The Daily, which supposedly repre
sents the student body of one of the most
respected academic and research institu
tions in the world, choose to be an accom
plice to the wholesale marketing of
human life?
With all of the neglected children in
both our nation and the world today, is it
really in our best interests to allow the rich
to custom design their families? I urge
The Daily to stop carrying these and relat
ed advertisements. While it may be diffi
cult to make up for the lost revenue and
space, I'm certain that your talented stafl
can cope. Best of luck,

Abortion debate continues
Vincent James Strickler and Brendan
Stnhan arc fully entitled to llieir opinions
oil abortion, though I wish to challenge
Brednan's assertion that Stanford Stu
dents for Life are without a similar
rhetoric to the Students for Choice.
I found that all his letter consisted of
was rhetoric, not content. Comparing
abortion to the Holocaust and slavery is a
meaningless, inflammatory move which
will never allow the many sides of the com
plicated abortion issue to come together in
fruitful discussion. It will only up the ante
in this already too emotional debate and
result in further destruction such as clinic
bombings.
I would also ask Brendan to check his
facts. He states that "because women have
complete sexual freedom, men have no
responsibility for their sexual choices...
and treat men like sexual objects." First, in

no country in the world do women have
complete sexual freedom. The lack of ade
quate sexual education, contraception and
free access to abortion ensure that women
are the ones denied responsibility for their
sexual c hoic es.
Secondly, the historical and contempo
rary lack of sexual and reproductive
autonomy for women has never caused
men to act more sexually responsible or
treat women less like sexual objects, and I
fail to see how banning abortion could cre
ate more equal conditions between men
and women.
Even more importantly, though, the
purpose of abortion is not to change male
behavior, but to provide women with the
right to control their own bodies and be
able to make the best decisions for them
selves. Perhaps if Vincent and Brendan
took a less androcentric view of abortion
— in which the key issues are the behav
iors and rights of men — they would be

able to see why it's important for women
to have the legal right to abortion and full
self-determination.
What is needed in the abortion debate
— which ideally the well-educated and
open-minded Stanford students on both
sides of the issues could provide — is the
setting aside of prejudice and rhetoric for
a level-headed conversation about how
common ground, not violence, can be
reached.

In response to Mr. Strickler and Mr.
Stuhan:
The title of the column that Ms. Reeds
and Ms. Schmidt wrote for The Daily on
Feb. 3 was not duplicitous. Their point
was well made that getting involved in
activism about something important to
you is a great way to get rid of malaise

(and apathy), to become part of a commu
nity, to shed the illusion of the Stanford
bubble and a host of other benefits. I
applaud them.
As for Mr. Stuhan's final epithet, that
Ms. Reeds and Ms. Schmidt represent a
"radical viewpoint and group," it is mis
leading and inaccurate.
Although the advance of women's
rights has been a long struggle that con
tinues to this day, on the cusp of the new
millenium, most people, especially in our
generation, understand that reproductive
choice is necessary, and a right of women.
The reality is that criminalizing it does
not make abortion go away — it just
means that more women die from unsafe
abortions. Women need access to safe,
legal abortions, as well as contraception,
and comprehensive, healthy sexuality
education. That is what pro-choice means.
I do not know either of the two gentle
men who have written in the past two

days, so I am not in a position to say any
thing about their views other than what
was written. Unfortunately, on a state and
national level, the groups that lobby for
limitations on access to abortions are the
same ones that pushed for the current
federal program that gives more funding
to abstinence-only sex education curricu
la. On this basis, it doesn't seem unreason
able to call these people anti-choice.
This is a very sensitive issue, and I hope
that any further discussion remains
respectful of that reality and of the diver
sity of viewpoints and experiences repre
sented.
Though 1 am not a member of Stan
ford Students for Choice, I am glad to see
them getting started. It is appropriate to
look at power, specifically political power,
when thinking about access to reproduc
tive rights.
After all, why is it that Viagra is covered
by health insurance, and the birth control
pill isn't necessarily?
LAURAJEAN TORCiERSON
Junior, Classics

In his Feb. 7 letter to the editor, Vin
cent James Strickler falsely equates being
pro-choice with being pro-abortion. As
Elizabeth Reeds and Erin Schmidt stated
in their Feb. 3 guest column, being pro
choice means more than supporting a
woman's right to choose; it also means
linking choice with broader issues of
reproduction, contraception, education,
healthy families, women's higher educa
tion and careers and cultural attitudes
towards sexuality.
Strickler attributes unplanned preg
nancy to irresponsible behavior by men
and women who "are unprepared to
accept the consequences." Yet, many
opponents of access to abortion also
oppose sex education and access to con
traception, making responsible sexual
behavior far more difficult.
Approximately 80% of adolescent
youth are sexually active (Miller 8c
Moore, 1990); yet only one-third use con
traception (Hayes, 1987), due to a lack of
access, education and cultural acceptance
of safe sex. Until this society empowers
young women to use — and demand that

their partners use — contraception, until
this society teaches young men to protect
themselves and their partners, women will
face unwanted pregnancies.
And what of the consequences?
Unwanted and unplanned births (espe
cially among young mothers) may result
in severely limited educational and career
opportunities for the mother, a greater
incidence of poverty and health problems
for mother and child, and a greater risk of
child abuse and neglect, among other
damaging outcomes (Steinberg, 1999).
Our society has not yet demonstrated a
willingness to provide a secure and
healthy life for our children who are in
poverty. To require women to bear chil
dren whom they cannot support physical
ly or emotionally simply perpetuates
injustice from one generation to the next.
Where are the "pro-life" activists when it
comes time to fund schools, domestic vio
lence shelters, medical and mental health
services, and yes, even welfare for women
and children?
I have spoken with other women at
Stanford about what decision we would
make if faced with an unplanned preg
nancy tomorrow. None of us had an

instant, easy answer. Women considering
abortion must weigh their values and
beliefs, financial situation, education and
career opportunities and the reactions of
friends, family and society at large.
Clearly, women do not have sex think
ing of abortion as an easy form of birth
control: we do not and cannot take abor
tion lightly.
Abortion is never an easy choice, but it
is a choice that must remain available to
women.
