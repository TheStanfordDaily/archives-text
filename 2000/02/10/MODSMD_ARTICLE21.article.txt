# Court upholds NCAA standards
## 
### SABA BIREDA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A recent decision by the Third Circuit U.S. Court
of Appeals found that the NCAA's academic stan
dards do not have a discriminatory effect against
African-American student-athletes, reversing an ear
lier federal decision.
I he late-December ruling will have little effect on
the eligibility of prospective Stanford athletes, ac
cording to Athletics Department officials, because
Stanford's ac ademic standards are already so high.
I he decision resulted from the NCAA's appeal of
an April 1999 case in which four African-American
student-athletes complained that the minimum stan
dards for act epting freshmen using standardized test
scores violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.
I he minimum standards are part of a 1990 NCAA
ruling called Proposition Mi, which mandated that
athletes have a grade-point average of 2.5 and an SAT
score above cS2O. If the athlete's CPA was 2.0, their
SA I score needed to be at least 1010. Students also
needed to complete at least 13 core academic classes.
I he plaintiffs argued the SAT is a culturally biased
examination and therefore should not be used as an
eligibility requirement. Because NCAA schools re

ceive federal money for some programs, the plaintiffs
alleged that the standards violated civil rights laws.
Following the circuit court's decision, the NCAA's
current initial eligibility rules will remain in effect.
In a statement released by the NCAA, Craham B.
Spanier, chair of the NCAA Division 1 Board of Di
rectors, said, "We are pleased to obtain this ruling
from the court. But as we have said all along, we will
continue to review initial-eligibility rules, including
the test-score cutoff ."
The recent decision will make few waves in the Ath
letics Department.
Susan Bui k, director of student services for the de
partment, said, "We have no minimum requirements
. . . admission is based on the strength of a student's
file [including essays, grades and SAT scores J."
Burk stressed that high grades for prospective siw
dent-athletes were of great importance to Stanford.
Some student-athletes question the admission pol
icy's effect on the strength of Stanford athletics.
Sophomore Robyn Woolfolk, a member of the
track and field team, said having such high standards
"makes it hard to recruit people."
But Woolfolk added, "The reason I came here was
for academics . . . Our coaches definitely make acade
mics more important than athletics."
