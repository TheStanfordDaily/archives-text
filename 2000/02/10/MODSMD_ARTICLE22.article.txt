## Off to a fresh start 
### MAUREEN MULLEN 
"She's even a little better than 1 thought she was,"says Car
dinal women's basketball coach Tara VanDerveer of freshman

standout Jamie Carey. Carey is making huge

contributions in her initial season at Stan-

ford and is currently second in the Pa-

cific 10 Conference in three-point

percentage.
"Of course it's every

fresh m a n ' s

d re a 111."

Carey said.

"You coine in
with the mindset

that you are going

to help your team in

any way you can, whether

it is starting or coming in and

being the vocal voice on the

floor, whatever you can do to make

your team better."

Carey, one of the top prep recruits in 1999,

hails from Horizon High School in Thornton, Colo.,

_ a
where she led the state in scoring her senior year. The fu-

ture Card received many honors throughout her high

school career, including 1999 Gatorade Regional Player of
the Year honors, First Team Parade Magazine All-American,
and three year All-State recognition. In fact, Carey's high
school basketball jersey was inducted into t lie* Women's Bas
ketball Hall of Fame in 1999.
Multiple factors drove Carey to the Farm. As her high
school valedictorian, the academics at Stanford played a major
role.
"My parents have always drilled in my head, 'Academics,
academics,' and it has been a strong value of mine," Carey
said. She is currently undecided on her major, but has a strong
interest in Psychology and Computer Science.
However, playing for the No. 24 Cardinal women (14-5, 7-
2 Pac-10) is no small feat.
"It has always been a dream of mine, since seventh grade,"
Carey said. "When I came here 1 really fell in love with it. 1
love my coaches and my teammates; it is just a good lit for me."
As for playing for Tara VanDerveer, Carey simply said, "It
>rd Daily

is awesome. She is a very challenging coach and is teaching me
something new every single clay I am out on the floor."
Clarey is the onl\ freshman on this year's women's team, a
role that presented some adjustments. "1( is difficult being the
only freshman, because you don't have anyone else going
through the same thing," Carey said. " I hank Cod, my team
mates have been really awesome."
Clearly, Carey has had little trouble bringing her game
to the college level. She starts for the Cardinal and con
tributes greatly to Stanford's powerful perimeter shooting,
shooting a remarkable 48 percent from beyond the arc. She
has scored a three-pointer in all I<S games that she has
played. Teammate Lauren St. Clair, a sophomore, is the
only player in the Pac-10 with a higher three-point per
centage.
('.are\ has had several huge games for the Cardinal this sea
son. She scored a career-high 25 points and six three-pointers
in the Stanford loss against Washington. Carey also scored 16
points on four three-pointers in Stanford's amazing come
lrom-behind win against Oregon. In the Stanford win against
UCLA last week, Carey stepped up and played a critical role
in running the team when senior point guard Milena Mores
sat with foul trouble for a large part of the first half.
VanDerveer has nothing but praise for her freshman star.
"She is a really smart player; she sees the floor really well
and anticipates passes for people," she said. "She is everything,
you could ask for offensively.
"She is incredible. For us. she is like the |ohn Stockton. She
comes in, she is small, but she can guard people. She handles
the ball, she shoots the ball, she passes the ball, for a coach, she
is a tin ill to work with."
Growing up Carey c ites Stanford standout Jennifer Azzi as
her role model.
"I loved how [AzziJ played, how hard she played. 1 loved
her shot," Carey said.
Following in her role model's footsteps, Carey and St. Clair
are hovering very close to Azzi's three-point percentage
record of 49.5 percent set in the 1988-89 season.
(larey has many expectations for the remainder of the Stan
lord season.
"Definitely our goal is to win the Pac-10, and with that we
should get a pretty good seed in the NCAA tournament,"

she said. "Our goal is to win it
all."

Alter last week's wins against
UCLA and USC, the Cardinal is
currently tied with Arizona and
the Bruins atop the Pac-10 stand
ings. The Ducks are only one
game behind and with a win this
weekend, they could move into
the share for the lead.
When the Ducks came down to
Maples Pavilion earlier this season,

Stanford posted an impressive
come-from-behind 78-62 win. With
four minutes remaining in the first
half , the Cardinal was down a seem
ingly insurmountable 36-10. Led by
Lauren St. Clair, who went 0 for 9
from three-point territory, junior
Carolyn Moos and Carey, Stanford
mounted the biggest comeback in
team history.
Oregon is coming off its first
home loss of the season, to No. 19

Arizona last weekend. The Ducks
are a tough defensive team, lead
ing the Pac-10 in several defen
sive categories. In addition, Stan
ford will have to keep a close eye
on 1998-99 Pac-10 Freshman of
the Year Shaquala Williams, who
is currently second in the confer
ence in scoring, and her team
mate Angelina Wolvert, who
leads the conference in field-goal
percentage.

"It has always been a dream of mine, since seventh grade,"
Carey said. "When I came here 1 really fell in love with it. 1
love my coaches and my teammates; it is just a good lit for me."
As for playing for Tara VanDerveer, Carey simply said, "It
>rd Daily

is awesome. She is a very challenging coach and is teaching me
something new every single clay I am out on the floor."
Clarey is the onl\ freshman on this year's women's team, a
role that presented some adjustments. "1( is difficult being the
only freshman, because you don't have anyone else going
through the same thing," Carey said. " I hank Cod, my team
mates have been really awesome."
Clearly, Carey has had little trouble bringing her game
to the college level. She starts for the Cardinal and con
tributes greatly to Stanford's powerful perimeter shooting,
shooting a remarkable 48 percent from beyond the arc. She
has scored a three-pointer in all I<S games that she has
played. Teammate Lauren St. Clair, a sophomore, is the
only player in the Pac-10 with a higher three-point per
centage.
('.are\ has had several huge games for the Cardinal this sea
son. She scored a career-high 25 points and six three-pointers
in the Stanford loss against Washington. Carey also scored 16
points on four three-pointers in Stanford's amazing come
lrom-behind win against Oregon. In the Stanford win against
UCLA last week, Carey stepped up and played a critical role
in running the team when senior point guard Milena Mores
sat with foul trouble for a large part of the first half.
VanDerveer has nothing but praise for her freshman star.
"She is a really smart player; she sees the floor really well
and anticipates passes for people," she said. "She is everything,
you could ask for offensively.
"She is incredible. For us. she is like the |ohn Stockton. She
comes in, she is small, but she can guard people. She handles
the ball, she shoots the ball, she passes the ball, for a coach, she
is a tin ill to work with."
Growing up Carey c ites Stanford standout Jennifer Azzi as
her role model.
"I loved how [AzziJ played, how hard she played. 1 loved
her shot," Carey said.
Following in her role model's footsteps, Carey and St. Clair
are hovering very close to Azzi's three-point percentage
record of 49.5 percent set in the 1988-89 season.
(larey has many expectations for the remainder of the Stan
lord season.
"Definitely our goal is to win the Pac-10, and with that we
should get a pretty good seed in the NCAA tournament,"

she said. "Our goal is to win it
all."
(larev aucl the rest of the Car
dinal look to stav on top ol the
tight Pac-10 race this weekend as
lhe\ head to Oregon (15-6, 6-3)
and ()regon State (9-12, 5-4).

Tonight's game against Ore
gon will be critical for Stanford.
Alter last week's wins against
UCLA and USC, the Cardinal is
currently tied with Arizona and
the Bruins atop the Pac-10 stand
ings. The Ducks are only one
game behind and with a win this
weekend, they could move into
the share for the lead.
When the Ducks came down to
Maples Pavilion earlier this season,

Stanford posted an impressive
come-from-behind 78-62 win. With
four minutes remaining in the first
half , the Cardinal was down a seem
ingly insurmountable 36-10. Led by
Lauren St. Clair, who went 0 for 9
from three-point territory, junior
Carolyn Moos and Carey, Stanford
mounted the biggest comeback in
team history.
Oregon is coming off its first
home loss of the season, to No. 19

Arizona last weekend. The Ducks
are a tough defensive team, lead
ing the Pac-10 in several defen
sive categories. In addition, Stan
ford will have to keep a close eye
on 1998-99 Pac-10 Freshman of
the Year Shaquala Williams, who
is currently second in the confer
ence in scoring, and her team
mate Angelina Wolvert, who
leads the conference in field-goal
percentage.
