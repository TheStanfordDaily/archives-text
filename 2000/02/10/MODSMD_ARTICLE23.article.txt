# Women's tennis hammers Fresno State
## Irvin dominates at No. 1 position in her return to collegiate play 
### BILL HANSON STAFF WRITER 
The stakes are getting higher.
Yesterday, the top-ranked
Stanford women's tennis team
(5-0, 7-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
played its toughest dual match of
the season against 23rd-ranked
Fresno State (0-2).
Last year, the Bulldogs nearly
beat the Cardinal, leading 4-2
before Stanford rallied for a 5-4
victory.
This time, the Cardinal was
prepared.
Led by sophomore Marissa
Irvin, the Cardinal secured vic
tory with a 5-1 lead after singles
play. File doubles matches were
canceled due to rain.
Irvin was in fine form during
her first home match of the sea
son, pounding winners at will
from the baseline while carving
out an easy 6-2, 6-3 win over
Fresno State's Kim Niggemeyer.
Irvin, who last year reached
the finals of the NCAA Individ
ual tournament and finished the
season ranked in the nation, is
currently returning to collegiate
competition after participating
in several professional tourna
ments over the last few months.
At No. 106, Irvin is the high
est-ranked amateur on the
Women's lennis Association
Four. In January, she upset
35th-ranked Corina Morariu in
the first round of the Australian
Open in Melbourne, Australia,
before falling to eventual cham
pion Lindsay Davenport, 6-4, 7-
5, in the second round.
"She's even better than she
was last year," said teammate
Sarah Pestieau, a junior. "She's
our best player and she's going
to win every match. Having her
gives us great confidence. It's al

most like having a point in our
pocket every time."
Freshman Laura Granville,
who played No. 1 singles during
Irvin's absence, posted an im
pressive win at the No. 2 position
yesterday, holding off Bulldog
Kandiss Creighton, 7-5, 6-4.
Stanford dropped its only
point at the No. 3 position as se
nior Teryn Ashley struggled
against Liesl Fichtbauer.
Ashley has been ranked as
high as fourth in the nation but
has only played intermittently
this year while recovering from
tendonitis in her wrist. Yester
day, she lost 6-4, 7-6 despite
holding a 4-0 lead in the first set
and a 5-3 lead in the second.
"I'm just not playing well,"
Ashley said. "I don't have any
confidence. I've never lost this
many matches this early in the
season. I don't know how main
times I've beaten that girl. 1 just
started freaking out and missing
because I have no confidence.
It's completely mental. I've
played so lew matches in the past
few months. I guess I shouldn't
expect so much from myself."
1 lie rest of yesterday's singles
matches were routine wins for
the Cardinal.
At the No. 4 spot, sophomore
Gabriela Lastra cruised past Kwa
(irusiecka, 6-3, 0-0, while sopho
more Keiko Tokucla beat Kelly
Ramirez in straight sets at the
No. 5 position.
In the No. 0 match, Pestieau,
who holds the eighth position on
the latter but competed yester
day because sophomore Lauren
Kalvaria was suffering from a
minor foot injury, swept Fresno
State's Chantel Wiggins, 6-4, 6-1.
"I played well," Pestieau said.
"The court was slippery, though,
so that was kind of tough. I just
want to prove that I can win my
matches when I get the chance
just like every one else does."
This weekend, the Cardinal
will face an even tougher test
