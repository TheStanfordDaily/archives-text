opponents to give it another go at
Stanford, with No. 24 ()regon (16-
I, 7-2). sitting alone in third place,
and Oregon State (10-10, 2-7)
coining into Maples Pavilion.
"I think that most teams will go
kick .md look at what they didn't
accomplish the first time and they
u ill make adjustments," said Stan
lord head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "We saw what Oregon
took away from us, and we need to
do a better job of running offense,
gelling the ball in key areas, being
a little bit tougher than we were.
And I'm sure they'll do the same
thing."
()regon head coach Krnie Kent,
an assistant under Montgomery
lor two vears, probably looked at
game films from the 14-point
home loss to Stanford and felt his
team had ample opportunity to
v\ in the game.
The Ducks (1(5-1, 7-2) battled
the Cardinal up until the last two
minutes when the two teams last

met Jan. 15. Buoyed by the a rick
ety, rowdy McArthur Court
crowd, Oregon did a good job of
neutralizing Stanford's perceived
advantage inside beforejunior for
ward Jarron Collins and senior
guard David Moseley put the
game out of reach.
Though Montgomery under
standably would not elaborate on
his exact plans for tonight, he al
luded to pushing the ball inside to
his quartet of excellent post play
ers, Jarron and Jason Collins, se
nior Mark Madsen and freshman
Curtis Borchardt. None of them
seemed to be able to get consistent
ly superior inside position against
the Ducks.
That could change tonight as
Jarron's strong shooting in the
teams' last meeting will probably
pull Oregon away from its initial
plan to pack its defense inside.
When the Ducks made the deci
sion last game to play off the high
post, Collins racked up 19 points
and I .'5 rebounds, with much of his
production coining from a newly
perfected fallaway and numerous
open jumpers from the free-throw
line.

If Oregon pursues a similar de
fensive plan, expect Collins to cap
italize agaiti. If the Ducks decide to
bring a defender out to guard his
shot, expect Stanford to pound the
ball into the low post.
While the Cardinal impressed
quite a lew people 011 its successful
swing through Oregon a month
ago, Montgomery also came away
impressed by the Ducks. Oregon's
backcourt of Frederick Jones, Alex
Scales and Darius Wright was es
pecially noticeable. Scales had 21
points in a losing effort.
"I think Wright is probably as
underrated a player as there is in
the conference in terms of his abil
ity to push it up and get others in
volved," Montgomery said. "Scales
is a big-time athlete. 1 le can really
make plays."
1 he Ducks don't have the same
caliber of athletes inside, but the
combo of C>hrisChristofferson, Flo
1 lartenstein and Bryan Bracey has
done a decent job. And Bracey, a
junior college transfer from (Chica
go, has shown (lashes of real talent.
Against Washington, he was 10 for
10 from the field.
" They've gotten really good

mileage out of their post players.
They kind of do it by committee.
They'll run four or five guys at
you. And looking at the tape they
might be as physical defensively as
anybody," Montgomery said.
Oregon State (10-10, 2-7), slog
ging through another difficult sea
son, might be a better team than
the one that lost at home to Stan
ford by 28 points on Jan. 13. But
the Beavers are still more than
beatable.
In Corvallis, Ore., oft-injured
center Jason Heide left the game
with ankle problems, leaving Ore
gon State vulnerable inside. And
outside, Stanford's Mike McDon
ald and Tony (liovacchini held All-
Conference point guard Deaun
dra Tanner to three points on 1-
for-1 1 shooting.
Tanner's pride will force him to
play better, but it probably won't
be enough.

team had ample opportunity to
v\ in the game.
The Ducks (1(5-1, 7-2) battled
the Cardinal up until the last two
minutes when the two teams last

met Jan. 15. Buoyed by the a rick
ety, rowdy McArthur Court
crowd, Oregon did a good job of
neutralizing Stanford's perceived
advantage inside beforejunior for
ward Jarron Collins and senior
guard David Moseley put the
game out of reach.
Though Montgomery under
standably would not elaborate on
his exact plans for tonight, he al
luded to pushing the ball inside to
his quartet of excellent post play
ers, Jarron and Jason Collins, se
nior Mark Madsen and freshman
Curtis Borchardt. None of them
seemed to be able to get consistent
ly superior inside position against
the Ducks.
That could change tonight as
Jarron's strong shooting in the
teams' last meeting will probably
pull Oregon away from its initial
plan to pack its defense inside.
When the Ducks made the deci
sion last game to play off the high
post, Collins racked up 19 points
and I .'5 rebounds, with much of his
production coining from a newly
perfected fallaway and numerous
open jumpers from the free-throw
line.

If Oregon pursues a similar de
fensive plan, expect Collins to cap
italize agaiti. If the Ducks decide to
bring a defender out to guard his
shot, expect Stanford to pound the
ball into the low post.
While the Cardinal impressed
quite a lew people 011 its successful
swing through Oregon a month
ago, Montgomery also came away
impressed by the Ducks. Oregon's
backcourt of Frederick Jones, Alex
Scales and Darius Wright was es
pecially noticeable. Scales had 21
points in a losing effort.
"I think Wright is probably as
underrated a player as there is in
the conference in terms of his abil
ity to push it up and get others in
volved," Montgomery said. "Scales
is a big-time athlete. 1 le can really
make plays."
1 he Ducks don't have the same
caliber of athletes inside, but the
combo of C>hrisChristofferson, Flo
1 lartenstein and Bryan Bracey has
done a decent job. And Bracey, a
junior college transfer from (Chica
go, has shown (lashes of real talent.
Against Washington, he was 10 for
10 from the field.
" They've gotten really good

mileage out of their post players.
They kind of do it by committee.
They'll run four or five guys at
you. And looking at the tape they
might be as physical defensively as
anybody," Montgomery said.
Oregon State (10-10, 2-7), slog
ging through another difficult sea
son, might be a better team than
the one that lost at home to Stan
ford by 28 points on Jan. 13. But
the Beavers are still more than
beatable.
In Corvallis, Ore., oft-injured
center Jason Heide left the game
with ankle problems, leaving Ore
gon State vulnerable inside. And
outside, Stanford's Mike McDon
ald and Tony (liovacchini held All-
Conference point guard Deaun
dra Tanner to three points on 1-
for-1 1 shooting.
Tanner's pride will force him to
play better, but it probably won't
be enough.
The Ducks' backcourt gives
them an opportunity to put a
crimp in Stanford's plans to repeat
as Pac-10 Cjlhampion, but the
BeaVers luvtHittle chartrce to take a
bite out of the Cardinal's already
stellar season.
