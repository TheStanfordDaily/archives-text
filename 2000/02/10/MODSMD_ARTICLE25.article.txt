## Squad looks to close season with victories 
### ALEX BENJAMIN 
1 he Stanford men's
wrestling team comes into its
final weekend coining off two
straight team victories over
Portland State and Cal State-
Fullerton. The Cardinal, (3-4,
2-4 Pacific 10 Conference),
heads to Cal Poly on Friday
and Fresno State on Saturday.
"I'm excited about this
weekend and think we will he
able to come up with a big win
if everybody is wrestling," se
nior co-captain Zacli Zimmerer
said. "We have not beaten ei
ther of these teams since I have
been here, so it would be great
to pull out a win. I don't think
that we have really shown what
we are capable of yet this year,
so maybe this weekend will be a
good opportunity to start off
our postseason."
Friday night's meet against
the Mustangs (5-8, 2-4) will be
a tough match, but a win would
be uplifting. The Cardinal,
which has been without in
jured starters senior Rudy
Ruiz (125 pounds) and fresh
man Harold Penson (174), is
hoping to have them back for
the weekend. Unfortunately,
freshmen Rohner Segnitz
(IH4) will Ik- out indefinitely
with an injured back, and se
nior Clay Hackerman (105) is
out until the I 'at -10 (champi
onships with a sprained knee.
So, once again the (Cardinal
comes into the weekend need
ing help from other key
wrestlers, munch sophomores
Chuck Fairbanks (1 <S4) and
Shawn Harmon (157). l air
banks will wrestle lor Segnilz
.ind I larmon will either wrestle
in the place o! 11ac kernian ai
105 pounds or stay at 157
pounds and ilie usual stai ter,
senior Warren McPhcrson,
will wrestle up loi 11 at kernian.
I lie Mustangs bring to the
mat Steve Strange, winner of
the 171-pound weight ( lass at
last weekend's All Cal Invita
tional at San Franc isco State, as
well as |aime Carza (125) and
Brett Schumann (105), both
third-place finishers in their
weight divisions.
"Cal Poly is a better
matchup for us, but they are
anothci traditionally strong
program in California," said
Cardinal head coach Chris

Horpel. "It's been several
years since we have beaten
them. I am still a little uncer
tain who w ill be our 10 starters;
we are still dealing with (jitite a
few injuries to key athletes."
After meeting Cal Poly on
Friday, the Cardinal heads to
Fresno State (10-7) for its final
regular season meet. After
beating the Mustangs 28-9 and
winning the All Cal I mutation
al, the Bulldogs (10-7) figure to
be a tougher challenge for
Stanford.
"Fresno State won the All
Cal last weekend by a hefty
margin and w ill provide tough
competition for us on Satur
day," Horpel said. "The bot
tom line is, there will be about
six matches that could go ei
ther way. If we win all six, we
win this meet."
Fresno State will have a
number of vvrestlei s w ho could
be trouble for the Cardinal.
The Bulldogs are led by senior
Paris Ruiz (133), who will fate
Stanford's undefeated Zim
merer, senior lim Cor
nish(ls7), who will most likelv
match up with McPherson,
and a tough junior in Darrick
Hayes (125), who will match
up against the returning Rud\
Ruiz, who has beaten Hayes
once earlier this year.
"All three of their stats won
the All (Cal last Saturdav and all
three of ours did not compete
due to various injuries," Hor
pel Said.
Other Mustang wrestlers
include freshman Ralph
1 .ope/, winner of the lll
pound weight ( lass, who had
wins over Stanford's |ustiu
Walker, a freshman, and I.evi
Weikel-Magden, a sophomore.
Stanford freshman Isaiah
(Camp (149) w ill have another
shot at Fresno State sopho
more Dan it k Dm an (140)
after losing to him last week
end. And freshman Brad Selby
(285) w ill have another chance
u> take; on sophomore Crant
I lurring'ton (henvvvwiglkti).
I lie (Cardinal, hoping to use
these two last meets as a
springboard into the Pac-10
(Championships, plans to tome
out with all it has.
"I think our team has
gained an understanding of
the tournament's anything
can-happen at mosphere,"
Ruiz said. "And everyone is
anxious to prove themselves
tome (the Pac-10 Champi
onships)."
