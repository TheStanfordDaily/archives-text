I lie No. Stanford women's swimming
.iikl diving team will face one of its most bitter
rivals this Saturday as it takes on the No. 5
California squad at deGuerre pool at 12 p.m.
Stanford lias a record of 5-1 this season,
and is a strong contender to win both the Pa
<i!i< 10 Conference and NCAA champi
onships this year. I his weekend's competi
tion will be one of the Cardinal's more excit
ing dual meets.
Stanford has lost to the Bears only twice in
the last 2(> years, and hopes to improve its
record to 25-2. However, Stanford's long
standing winning tradition by no means as
sures it of an easy victory. Last year's meet
was rather intense, as the Cardinal narrowly
defeated the Bears, 154-145, and this week
end promises to be no less exciting.
"Last year was an exciting meet," said co
captain Cabrielle Rose, a senior. "It came
clown to tlit- last relay, and Cal is even better
this year. Sat in clay's meet is going to be down
to t he wire."
Mam of the Bears'star swimmers are back

again this year to challenge the Cardinal
squad. Cal placed fifth at the NCAA Champi
onship in 1999, and has lost only one dual
meet so far this season.
Additionally, four Cal swimmers have al
ready achieved automatic NCAA qualifying
times. At this point, the Stanford squad boasts
only two swimmers with automatic standards:
junior Misty Hyman and sophomore Shelly
Ripple. But co-captain Catherine Fox, junior
Siobhan Cropper and sophomore Jessica
Foschi are not far from the automatic stan
dards.
"Fven though Cal is having a great season,
I think we can beat them," Rose said. "We
match up well against them, and we are look
ing strong and healthy and ready to go. It is
really just a question of who is having a better
day. If all goes well, Stanford will walk away
with the victory."
Assistant coach Ross Gerry is also looking
forward to the faceoff between the two rivals
this weekend.
"Last year's competition was fairly excit
ing, but the meet will be much more exciting
this year. This is the first year that I can re
member that Cal had a chance to beat us, so
they will undoubtedly be on the warpath. It is
going to be an exciting meet."
Despite the threat of defeat, the Cardinal

women are feeling confident going into this
weekend's battle. According to diver Erin
Sones, Cal does not have a very strong diving
program.
"We have consistently beaten Cal in the
past, and Stanford's strong diving team will
definitely help us this weekend. We are going
to do everything we can to help the swimmers
take down the Bears."
Though this weekend is not the major
focus of the season, it should be an exciting
few hours for the Cardinal squad. If nothing
else, it will help the team prepare for the
more important Pac-10 and NCAA champi
onship meets.
Gerry said he is very excited about the
team's prospects this season.
"We have a really wonderful, energetic
team this year with a great attitude and a lot
of drive. Stanford is competing with a rela
tively small team of only 13 swimmers and
five divers, but they make up in excitement
what they lack in numbers. It is going to be a
great season for these women, and we are re
ally looking forward to the Pac-10 and NCAA
championship meets in March."
But in the meantime, the team is focused
on the Big Meet this weekend.
