a weekly look at arts, entertainment and style at Stanford

'Scream 3\ Wes Cravens conclusion to his Scream series,
just opened with a bang across the nation after a very secre
tive filming process that kept even the stars of the film in the
dark about what really happens. This fairly comedic horror
trilogy has left the nation Scream-ing for more, and Craven 's

final film promises to bring an end to the man in the sca?y
white mask. Intermissions Lauren Russell spoke with two

members of Scream's cast. She first met with {miner Play
boy model and MTV gameshow host Jenny McCarthy,

who plays the spoiled actress Sarah Darling in the film.
Read on to hear more about the final chapter in the tril

ogy and to see a personal side of Miss McCarthy that
even her Playboy photos have not revealed.

I: Do you enjoy scary movies?
What is your favorite horror
movie?
J.M.: "Exorcist!" I think I became
a very religious person after that
movie. I remember seeing it after
my first holy communion in third
grade and since then 1 have
vowed to say my prayers every
night. I am a sucker for horror
films.
I: What was it like to work with
Wes Craven?
J.M.: It was so much fun working
with him. 1 was scared at first
because I thought that someone
like him must be kind of creepy to
make movies like that, and he
turned out to be the shyest,
sweetest man 1 have ever met.
I: Is there any truth to the rumor
that there are going to be multi
ple endings in the movie?
J.M.: I would not put it past him.
To tell you the truth 1 don't
know. I only got my pages, so 1
don't even know what happens.
I'hey didn*t allow anyone on the
set, and I only got my lines, so 1
don*t know what happens to
Courtney, or Neve. Which is
amazing, to be in a film and not
know anything.
1: You have been typecast as a
character who spa/zes all the

time. Do you play that role in
Scream, and do you plan to keep
playing characters like that in the
future?
J.M.: The reason 1 took a break
for a while is that 1 wanted to do
that, to regroup and show that 1
am very capable of dramatic
parts. That's why 1 took this part
in "Diamonds" with Kirk Douglas
and Lauren Bacall which is com
ing out in February. "Scream" is
not neccesarily drama, but it is
not crazy comedy. It is very dif
ferent from anything else 1 have
done. I want to be aWt} dabble
in both.
I: What about the role you are
playing in Scream 3 did you enjoy
most?
J.M.: To tell you the truth, the
role wasn't written to be a brat.
When I looked at my role, I tried
to add to the character as much as
I could. I thought, what do
actresses act like? Like little brats!
I: So you played a large role in
creating the character?
J.M.: Yeah, I am anything but
one so it was fun to play one.
I: What was your favorite scene to
shoot in the movie, and why?
J.M.: Oh, that's hard to say with
out giving away too much. I had a
lot of fun with the guy walking

aro un d
the set, the ghost-faced killer
man. He was there every day,
because he was a stunt-mail, so
when I would go and get my
lunch and 1 would stare at this
guy and think "Oh inv Oods he is
scarier in person."
I: Do you prefer TV or film?
J.M.: That's tough, because I love
making films. In a way it is more
fun because television is under a
lot of pressure in terms of week
to-week ratings. The reason I do
like television is to be in people's
homes. I miss that, people watch
ing me every day.
1: Do you plan to work with your
husband again?
J.M.: Yes, we always look out for
that. He looks for open directing
assignments. We always want to
do that. We aren't together right
now because I am in New York.
1: Your career as a Playboy model
certainly lias helped rather than

hurt
you. Do

you ever feel

that producers or directors dis
criminate towards you because of
that though?
J.M.: One hundred percent yes!
MTV did not want to hire me
because of that. They thought
there was no way that someone
from Playboy could possibly han
dle a job like that. The great thing
about that is, when people tell you
no, it makes you want it even
more, and it makes me try harder.
I: Will you pose for Playboy
again?
J.M.: No. I don't think so! I loved
what I did for Playboy, hut I was
in the best shape of my life then.
And now 1 have just as sexy pic
tures in Maxim next month that 1
didn't need to do in the bull.
