### LAUREN RUSSELL EDITORIAL STAFF 
a weekly look at arts, entertainment and style at Stanford

'Scream 3\ Wes Cravens conclusion to his Scream series,
just opened with a bang across the nation after a very secre
tive filming process that kept even the stars of the film in the
dark about what really happens. This fairly comedic horror
trilogy has left the nation Scream-ing for more, and Craven 's

final film promises to bring an end to the man in the sca?y
white mask. Intermissions Lauren Russell spoke with two

members of Scream's cast. She first met with {miner Play
boy model and MTV gameshow host Jenny McCarthy,

who plays the spoiled actress Sarah Darling in the film.
Read on to hear more about the final chapter in the tril

ogy and to see a personal side of Miss McCarthy that
even her Playboy photos have not revealed.

I: Do you enjoy scary movies?
What is your favorite horror
movie?
J.M.: "Exorcist!" I think I became
a very religious person after that
movie. I remember seeing it after
my first holy communion in third
grade and since then 1 have
vowed to say my prayers every
night. I am a sucker for horror
films.
I: What was it like to work with
Wes Craven?
J.M.: It was so much fun working
with him. 1 was scared at first
because I thought that someone
like him must be kind of creepy to
make movies like that, and he
turned out to be the shyest,
sweetest man 1 have ever met.
I: Is there any truth to the rumor
that there are going to be multi
ple endings in the movie?
J.M.: I would not put it past him.
To tell you the truth 1 don't
know. I only got my pages, so 1
don't even know what happens.
I'hey didn*t allow anyone on the
set, and I only got my lines, so 1
don*t know what happens to
Courtney, or Neve. Which is
amazing, to be in a film and not
know anything.
1: You have been typecast as a
character who spa/zes all the

time. Do you play that role in
Scream, and do you plan to keep
playing characters like that in the
future?
J.M.: The reason 1 took a break
for a while is that 1 wanted to do
that, to regroup and show that 1
am very capable of dramatic
parts. That's why 1 took this part
in "Diamonds" with Kirk Douglas
and Lauren Bacall which is com
ing out in February. "Scream" is
not neccesarily drama, but it is
not crazy comedy. It is very dif
ferent from anything else 1 have
done. I want to be aWt} dabble
in both.
I: What about the role you are
playing in Scream 3 did you enjoy
most?
J.M.: To tell you the truth, the
role wasn't written to be a brat.
When I looked at my role, I tried
to add to the character as much as
I could. I thought, what do
actresses act like? Like little brats!
I: So you played a large role in
creating the character?
J.M.: Yeah, I am anything but
one so it was fun to play one.
I: What was your favorite scene to
shoot in the movie, and why?
J.M.: Oh, that's hard to say with
out giving away too much. I had a
lot of fun with the guy walking

aro un d
the set, the ghost-faced killer
man. He was there every day,
because he was a stunt-mail, so
when I would go and get my
lunch and 1 would stare at this
guy and think "Oh inv Oods he is
scarier in person."
I: Do you prefer TV or film?
J.M.: That's tough, because I love
making films. In a way it is more
fun because television is under a
lot of pressure in terms of week
to-week ratings. The reason I do
like television is to be in people's
homes. I miss that, people watch
ing me every day.
1: Do you plan to work with your
husband again?
J.M.: Yes, we always look out for
that. He looks for open directing
assignments. We always want to
do that. We aren't together right
now because I am in New York.
1: Your career as a Playboy model
certainly lias helped rather than

hurt
you. Do

you ever feel

that producers or directors dis
criminate towards you because of
that though?
J.M.: One hundred percent yes!
MTV did not want to hire me
because of that. They thought
there was no way that someone
from Playboy could possibly han
dle a job like that. The great thing
about that is, when people tell you
no, it makes you want it even
more, and it makes me try harder.
I: Will you pose for Playboy
again?
J.M.: No. I don't think so! I loved
what I did for Playboy, hut I was
in the best shape of my life then.
And now 1 have just as sexy pic
tures in Maxim next month that 1
didn't need to do in the bull.

I: What are you planning for the
future, <ind what is your dream
role?
J.M.: Someone asked me about
my dream role before and 1
don*t know what to say, because
every movie I see 1 say "ooh 1
would love to do that." Oh God.
It's hard to say. I have no idea! 1
couldn*t even think ... gosh, if 1
picked a current movie right now,
it would probably be "Girl, Inter
rupted." I went "ooh, I should
have got that one." For the
future, I am developing a show
that will come out next fall. You
kind of have to do it month to
month. All 1 know about the
future is that I am completely
driven, regrouped, focused, and 1
am going to work my butt oil to
make it last long.
Intermission now speaks with
Felicity's Scott holey, who plays the
director of "Stab 3"â€”the movie
within the movie in Scream 3.
Intermission: I just wanted to
know what appealed to you about
doing Scream 3. I'm sure you get
a lot of scripts and seeing that you
didn't even get a script with this
one, what was it about it that
made you want to do it?
Scott Foley: I wanted to do some
thing with a higher profile, that
would get my face out there.
Something that would, not that
this is going to cement me, but
something that's going to make a
lot of money. And it's going to be
a movie that people are going to
go see and they'll recognize my
face. And hopefully, the character
I play is dilferent from the one
which I do on TV.
I: Now that you have a recogniz
able TV persona, how do you
think it will help or hinder your
cinematic career, or has it
already?
S.F.: It's definitely helped. You
know, the days of I V actors not

being able to work in films has def
initely gone to the wayside. It
almost seems that these days to be
a young actor and want to be in
films for the most part you need to
have a successful series or be on
TV in some way, shape or form. If
it hadn't been for Felicity, Scream
would not have come my way.
I: Do you feel that could hinder
you in the future?
S.F.: Sure, I go into people's
houses every Sunday as Noel, this
incredibly, likable, charming
prom date. And if I don't do a
good job of weighing it out with
different characters it's going to
be a tough mold to break. I hope
that I'm not limited by that. 1
hope I don't turn into Gilligan,
but you never know. But I'm
lucky either way.
I: How do you feel about the
pressure of being a role model?
You've been thrown in the spot
light, whether you like it or not,
and people kind of look up to
you.
S.F.: Yeah, they do, and it's flat
tering. I'lie fact even that I am a
role model, that people watch
what I do, is very Mattering. And
it is definitely a weight on my
shoulders. 1 have to watch what I
do. Actually, prior to this season
on Felicity I was a smoker and
refused to have my picture taken
with a cigarette because I know
that it effects kids. I now no
longer am a smoker, and it's not
because I don't want kids to not
smoke. It's good for me. You
definitely watch what you do. But
it's a responsibility that I don't
mind having. I'm very proud to
be a role model.
I: In Scream, you're finally in
something playing a character
closer to your own age. First 16
and then, how old is Noel? 22 or
23?
S.F.: Noel is now twenty years
old.
I: 20 years old? Fantastic. And
now I'm assuming this character is
closer to your own age of 27?

S.F.: Yeah, he's on t he cusp of his
30th birthday. It was so refresh
ing. I didn't have to shave three
times a day, and I didn't have to
cake the makeup over any shadow
that would grow in two hours. It's
a hard thing to play a certain age
on TV and go into people's homes
as that age. You know, I was play
ing fifteen on Dawson's Creek two
years ago, ten years below my age.
A lot of the time I feel like, Jesus,
everyone thinks I'm twenty years
old, and I've actually lived a lot
longer than that.
I: Prior to this film, the
Scream movies have been very
much about people keeping
secrets. What is a secret about
yourself that most people do
not know?
S.F.: When I was growing up we
moved around a lot, and I was a
relatively, no, I was a really rebel
lious kid. I started drinking when
I was young and got into sub
stances that I probably shouldn't
have. And I had a couple of run
ins with the law.
I: Really?
S.F.: Yeah. But it's an amazing thing
to wake up in a jail cell. You really

realize how stupid you're Ix-ing.
I: How old were you when that
happened?
S.F. 1 was 16. And I wasn't in for
very long; it was like a night. But
it was long enough to put my
head on straight. I hope I'm a lit
tle more like Noel now than I was
then, and I'm pretty sure 1 am.
I: I've got tell you, my friend is an
RA here at school and when his
kids were moving in on the first
day he knocked on this girl's door
to introduce himself. He said,
"Hi, I'm your RA." And she said,
"Oh, 1 was expecting Noel from
Felicity."
S.F.: Noway! That's awesome.
I: But he said he was expecting
Felicity, so they were both losing
out.
S.F.: Felicity in a slip would have
been a better...
I: So, thanks for raising the bar
here on what RAs have to look
like from now on.
S.F.: Of, of course, man. (laughs)
Sorrv to your friend.
