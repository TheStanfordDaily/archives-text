### LAUREN RUSSELL EDITORIAL STAFF 
Wes Craven's Scream trilogy, a
quasi-parody on horror films, con
dudes with his standard of a mix

of chilling suspense and camp.
As expected, Scream 3 is full of
cliche murders that are fairly
predictable, but manages to
make the audience jump.
Scream 3 is played out on
the set of "Stab 3," a movie
within the movie, which brings
a lot of new faces to the original
Scream cast. Neve Campbell,
Courtney Cox and David
Arquette are back, but Wes
Craven also delivers the
expected celebrity cameos,
including Carrie Fisher.

The plot of the film kicks
off with—surprise—a brutal
murder! It looks like some
one else has decided to don
the infamous black gown with
a plastic face that looks like a
melted candle. And he

seems to be targeting
members of the "Stab 3"
cast. The plot thickens
when we discover that the
killer has decided to
knock off the actors in

the order that they are
killed in the script, leav
ing photographs of
Sidney's mother at

every crime scene.
Sidney's mother

and the secret life she led before
her death are central to the film,
and we get a good look at her
ghost on more than one occasion.
This, of course, brings Sidney out
of hiding.
So Sidney must come to terms
with yet another psycho killer. To

make things worse, we then dis
cover that there are three very dif
ferent versions of the script, which
is re-written by the killer every day.
This time, Sidney has more street
smarts, and has learned how to
kick the ass of

the man
behind the
mask.
The
Scream series is

definitely getting old. The ending,
which is meant to be a surprise and
a tie-up of the "Sidney's life is real
ly messed up" theme, left me
thinking "that's all?" But "Usual
Suspects" finales are few and far
between in Hollywood. Most hor
ror movies are over by the time we
figure out whodunit, and it is the
chilling scenes in the body of the
movie that make it worth seeing.
Scream, 1 did, and the film at least
deserves credit for delivering what
it promises.
Of course, the brilliance of the
Scream trilogy lies in its ability to
make fun of itself while also mak
ing the audience absolutely terri
fied. Although the horrendous act
ing and trite screenplay make it
difficult to laud Scream 3 as a work
of cinematic art, I spent much of
the film maiming my poor
boyfriend's arm because I was so
afraid that the killer would pop up
any moment. While I don't want to
give too much away, the masked
man definitely delivers when it
comes to the killing department.
