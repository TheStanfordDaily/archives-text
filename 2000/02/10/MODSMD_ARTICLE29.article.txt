# Respect the music: an editor's reflections on a world of sounds
## 
### SOREN JOHNSON STAFF WRITER 
When I arrived at Stanford as a
wide-eyed freshman in 1994, I had
a meager CD collection and some
very narrow musical tastes —in
my mind, the greatest bands ever
were U2, INXS and Van Halen.
Even worse, I suffered from a
dreadful case of pretentiousness
and turned up my nose at "pop"
and "alternative" music.
Luckily for me, I discovered
Intermission, and after six years
and over 100 articles and reviews, 1
understand how little I know about
music and how humble one needs
to be when approaching the sub-
J ect -
Music is a gift, and we should
treat it with respect and an open
mind. No matter how many CDs
you acquire or how many concerts
you attend, there are always entire
worlds of life-changing music to be
discovered.
1 am now bidding Intermission
farewell, and from my years of
experience, I would like to make
some suggestions for learning how
to respect music.

Not everyone is serious about
music. I know very little about art,
sculpture, architecture, philosophy
and literature, but 1 also don't pre
tend like 1 know much about those
fields.
Do you put on albums mainly
for background music? Is your CD
collection heavily influenced by
your friends? Do you buy albums
because you have heard a couple
songs from them? If so, then you
can ignore the rest of this column.
Music is not your love, and there is
no shame in that fact.
Music is a business, and all of its
media outlets (magazines, radio,
television, etc.) have one
purpose — to get you to buy new
music. However, there is no inher
ent reason why music released in
2000 is any better than music
released in 1984. Or 1977. Or
1956. Or 1943.
Truly great recordings are rare
commodities, and only a lew are
produced every year. Common
sense dictates that there were more
great albums and singles released
in the last 100 years than during
the last 12 months. Try spending
an entire year without buying atiy

thing released in the past five
years. Start with Miles Davis's
"Kind Of Blue" or James Brown's
"1 ,ive At The Apollo" or the Velvet
Underground boxed set. You
might be surprised with the results.
Musicians are like sharks — if
they don't keep swimming for
ward, they die. Few artists are able
to produce meaningful material
for longer than a decade. Accord
ingly, the genres they pioneer also
die and turn into echoes of their
former selves. The recent swing
revival, for example, was simply
an echo of Louis Jordan's jump
blues. The popularity of female
singer/songwriters today is an
echo of joni Mitchell and I'atti
Smith.
Rock 'n' roll as a creative lorce
has died. So have funk, blues,
punk, country, soul and most
forms of jazz. The important music
of the next few years will come
from living genres: techno, hip
hop, alt-country and other forms
which do not yet have a name. As
listeners, we need to buy music
from eras when the genres were
alive. Do not accept imitations.

Music is never created in a vacu
um. Elvis, the Beatles, Dylan, Hen
drix, Prince, U2 and Nirvana were
popular manifestations of musical
liorces which had already been
active for many years. Finding the
roots of your favorite artists can be
a very rewarding experience.
The obvious lesson is that
commercial success does not
guarantee a great album. Vanilla
Ice's "To The Extreme," for
example, sold seven million
copies. However, ignoring album
sales goes both ways — just
because a group reaches a mass
market doesn't mean that they
have "sold out."
Many people make it a point
to ignore anyoi v- who has
appeared in the Top 40, often
competing to fir ' the most
obscure artists. ese music
"fans" are actually more misguid
ed than the people who only buy
what they hear on the radio
because the latter are at least not
consciously limiting their musical
range. The truth is simple —
album sales have no correlation
with album quality.

Music is no different from any
other human endeavor — if you
want to know more about it, you
need to study it. Buying albums
because you wanted one or two
tracks or because your friend rec
ommended it will produce a spot
ty, uneven music collection.
If you want to know more about
music, you should consult people
who listen to music for a living.
Music critics are not perfect, but
more often than not, they will
point you in the light direction.
I lie most consistent source by far is
the Rolling Stone Album Guide, in
which four reviewers rate and
describe every rock, pop, rap, jazz,
blues, country, soul, folk and
gospel album released before 1992.
Flip through this book and buy a
few five-star albums in a genre you
like. I have rarely been disappoint
ed with the results.
One pattern to avoid is jumping
in too deep when exploring a new
genre. For example, if you are
interested in blues, it would be a
mistake to make Robert Johnson
your first purchase. Although
mainstream artists like Eric ('lap

ton and Led Zeppelin have canon
ized his name, his music is too
rough for ears unaccustomed to
acoustic Delta blues.
Instead, one should wade in
slowly by buying established clas
sics. For blues, one should start
with 8.8. King, Muddy Waters
and John Lee Hooker. Simply put,
one should avoid getting the bends
when plunging into new, deep
waters.
Music is a gift, and we need to
trust our great artists to give us
meaningful music. Great works
rarely reveal their power during
the first listen. Van Morrison's
"Astral Weeks" may initially sound
like a jumbled mess, but by the filth
or sixth listen, the album's tran
scendent beauty shines brightly.
Contrary to the awareness of the
typical American, Ray Charles,
Aretha Franklin, James Brown,
Little Richard, Lou Reed, the
Clash, Elvis Costello, Chrissie
Hynde and the Replacements are
not one- or two-hit wonders. They
are artists of singular importance,
and we need to treat them accord
ingly.
