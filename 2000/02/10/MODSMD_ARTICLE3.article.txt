# Chem experiment ends in explosion
## Student hospitalized as beaker blows up in laboratory 
### T.J. BABBITT STAFF WRITER 
A glass beaker exploded in the
Mudd Chemistry Building yester
day morning, injuring Alaric Dy
ckman, a doctoral student in
chemistry. No one else was hurt.
Last night, according to his
wife, Dyckman was resting at
home after being treated at Stan
ford Hospital.
Sgt. Tim Hanrahan of the Stan
ford Police Department told the
Stanford News Service that Dyck

man sustained cuts on his face,
chest and hands when the beaker
exploded, though he was wearing
safety goggles at the time. His in
juries are not life-threatening.
Lawrence Gibbs, vice provost at
Stanford's Department of Envi
ronmental Health and Safety, told
the News Service that damage to
the laboratory was minor.
"Our major concern was for the
safety and well-being of the indi
vidual," he said.
Gibbs said that Dyckman was
working with chemicals that might
be hazardous in certain circum
stances, though it wasn't clear what
quantities of the chemicals were
being used. One of the chemicals
Dyckman was using was methylene chlo
ride, a common chemical solvent.
"We're waiting to have some discus
sions with [Dyckman] to determine what
might have caused this reaction to take
place," Gibbs said.

A fume hood captured most of the
chemicals after the explosion.
Dyckman was given a decontamina
tion shower after the accident, which
took place shortly after 10 a.m., and the
Palo Alto Fire Department then took him
to the Stanford Hospital emergency
room, from which he was discharged
after treatment.
Gibbs said other students were able to
use the lab Dyckman was working in
within hours after the accident.
