# Flaccid 'Don Juan' can't get it up
## 
### ZACH UDKO EDITORIAL STAFF 
John Pißoman's new play
Sons of Don Juan about

Cubans in
New Jersey
affectionately
calls itself "a
sexy come
dy." Does
anyone find

it odd that the words sexy and
New Jersey just appeared in
the same sentence?
Despite top-notch perfor
mances atid a fine mounting by
San Jose Repertory Theatre,
Pißoman's script comes up
being served bland and in des
perate need of spice. In fact,
there's not much at all to care
about in this rather uneventful
offering.
Set in a Latin singing club
and restaurant, Sons follows
the macho hairdresser and
womanizer Guillermo Galiano
(Robert Cuccioli) as he chases
after the American Dream.
Guille has aspirations of own
ing his own restaurant and
showcasing his own vocal tal
ents. To make a long story
short, Guille eventually gets the
money he needs to open his
own place, loses it, and then
gets into trouble with some ille
gal activities.
All matters are handled very
lightly here, and always at a
safe distance. It is comedy, after
all. But that's one of the show's
problems: it raises significant
issues and drops them before
the playwright really has a
chance to interject his opinions
. Issues of identity - ethnic and
sexual - are quickly abandoned
as to never stir controversy.
And forget about getting any
insight into the psychology of
machismo, the politics of immi
gration or the social dynamics

of Castro's Cuba.
Instead, Pißoman throws
around the term "Latin Ameri
can American" as if it were cute
and certain to get a handful of
polite chuckles. I am not saying
that any play that deals with
such topics needs to be politi
cal. But Pißoman does make an
effort to integrate them into the
plot and most often to an
unsatisfying extent.
Furthermore, the image of
Guille as a Don Juan only
works to a certain extent. Me
claims that he can tell a
woman's nationality based on
her nipples. And like Don
Juan, Duille believes that one
must treat woman with kind
ness and firmness. To him,
women are like good teeth:
"attractive, useful, hard to
replace, and you have to scrape
and scrub to maintain their
beauty."
One can view Sons of Don
Juan as an update of the legend
to the twentieth century, but
it's a stretch. Gendell Hernan
dez's Iggy Jimenez is an ade
quate substitute for Leperello.
And Christine Avila's married
Blanca works well in the Donna
Elvira figure. But that's about
where the similarities stop.
Guille has three lustful ladies
to keep him busy: Blanca, the
Latin television reporter Lila
Luz (in an over-the-top perfor
mance by Mali-Esther Maga
loni), and the ditzy divorcee
Meredith (Erica Shroeder
doing Audrey from Little Shop
of Horrors). But we never get a
sense of who these women real
ly are, what they see in Guille,
or who is the most virtuous
lady in waiting.
A few years back, the craftier
playwright David Ives tried his
take at the popular legend and
ended up churning out the
witty and hilarious Don Juan in
Chicago.

The concept of a Don Juan
stuck in the twentieth century
lends itself to a funny play. But
Pißoman's, unfortunately, isn't
it. Cuccioli plays the seductive
and womanizing Guillermo
Galiano with tremendous verve
and flair. And the ensemble of
eight do their best to overcome
flaws in the script.
Director Amy Gonzales
might have guessed that the
audience would get bored from
time to time because she high
lights Latin songs presented by
the actors between scenes. But
there simply aren't enough bal
lads beginning with Quando
out there to keep the show
alive.
