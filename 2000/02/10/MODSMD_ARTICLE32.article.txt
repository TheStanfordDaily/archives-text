# Gay civil rights hero's bio proves moving

### DENNIS TYLER 
1 he best part of the theater is
the awe-inspiring moment

when you are
sincerely
moved by
some thing
that occurred
on stage. iCivil

Sexi had many such moments.
An eclectic mix of song, dia
logue and dance, this play effec
tively chronicles the life of
Bayard kustin, a gay civil rights
leader of the 1960fs who was
closely affiliated with Dr. Martin
Luther King during the 1963
March on Washington.
1 he plot, in its more simpli
fied form, revolves around the
devastating effects Rustims
homosexuality had on his
career as an activist. Although
he spearheaded such powerful
movements as the Montgomery
boycott of 1955-1956 and draft
ed the original plan of the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference that began Kingfs
nonviolent campaign, his
accomplishments were often
negated by his sexuality.
His predicament only wors
ened once he was convicted of a
imorals charge! after being
caught having sex in an auto
mobile with two other men in
Pasadena, California. This con
viction disconnected him from
the movement because many of
the leaders did not want this
sort of bad publicity to counter
its success.
More importantly, the play
revealed how his career ham
pered his life: his denial of his
sexuality to the public in order
to save the face of the move
ment; his continual encounters
with the prison system resulting
from his civil rights activism; bis
resignation as the right hand
man of Martin Luther King
because reporters threatened to
implicate him and Reverend
King as sexual partners.
These situations portrayed
him as a tragic prominent figure
who was also a compassionate
human being with issues that

rival our own
problems.
However, do
not be fooled.
The play,
although dra
matic and
intense, was
coupled with
enough comedy
and sarcasm to
induce hearty
laughter.
The integra
tion scene, for
example, in
which Bayard
Rustin demon
strated methods
to improve the
relationship
between blacks
and whites by
using pictures of
stick figures that
were color
coded black and
white holding
hands, singing
together and
hugging each
anot h e i ,
prompt e (I
laughs from the
audience.
Not to men
tion the song
and dance ritu
als that reoc
curred through
out the play

either right in the middle of a
scene, or more subtly, as a tran
sition between scenes.
The documentary, directed
and written by Brian Freeman,
is a project that Freeman
researched for two years from
1997-1999. As a part of his
research, he interviewed eight
different people associated with
Bayard Rustin politically, social
ly, or intimately and recreated
these characters for the stage.
The characters included were
John Lewis, Fred Shuttlesworth,
Jonathan Brice, Schizu Proctor,
David Platts, Ralph Digia, David
Mc√üenoylds, and Rachelle
Horowitz. The actors prepared
for their roles by using the

audiotapes and notes that Free
man recorded while interview
ing the characters.
The process of their perfor
mances resembles the work of
Stanford's own Anna Deavere
Smith. II there must be one
gripe about the play, it would be
the lac k of information provid
ed about Rustin's life after the
1963 March on Washington.
Throughout the perfor
mance, Freeman did an excel
lent job of giving snapshots of
Bayard's life during the 's()s
and early '60s, but left the audi
ence hanging when he refused
to take a stance on why Bayard
Rustin was no longer visible
after the 1963 march. It was

unclear whether or not Bayard
was completely removed from
the movement or removed him
self and under what circum
stances.
Be assured, though, that
"Civil Sex" is definitely a mas
terful representation of an
unsung hero of the civil rights
movement, who did much to
change society's perception of
the race problem and yet
remains so unknown to many.
