"Eye of the Beholder" is a
movie that has a lot of potential.
Star Ewan

McGregor,
playing a
British intel
ligence agent
who has lost

both his daughter and wile,
becomes obsessed with Ashley
Judd beyond the point of obses
sion. Code named "The Eye,"
McGregor balances his superior
technical knowledge with his
haunting memories of his
daughter, who appears to him
in various hallucinations as an
annoying little school girl.
The plot only becomes more
convoluted from here: k.d. lang
is The Eye's contact woman
who gives him inside informa
tion to help him stalk Judd, and
Jason Priestley is a bleached
blond heroin addict who has no
real purpose at all.
The movie begins smartly
enough, with McGregor pho
tographing various individuals
using a tricky camera-gun. His
photographic targets include
the mysterious Judd, who
quickly proceeds to murder a
man for no apparent reason.
From here on out, however,
things start to break down.
McGregor stops paying atten
tion to his job and starts going
gaga over Judd's character
Joanna. He follows her every
where she goes! He sets up
video cameras in her hotel
rooms to watch her every move!
He discovers that she wears
wigs to hide her real hair color!
All of these details add up to
Judd's past as an ex-juvenile
delinquent who was under the
supervision of a woman named
Dr. Brault, played by
Genevieve Bujold.
McGregor keeps collecting
as much information as he can
about Judd, following her from
town to town as she kills a cop
in one city and courts a blind
man in another. Does this

somid confusing and somewhat
pointless? It is. But tilings
become mildly interesting again
when Joanna realizes that
someone is not only following
her but perhaps looking out for
her as well.
The Eye saves her from
being arrested, and intervenes
after Priestley's character
attacks her. This is a ridiculous
scene, where Priestley beats on
Judd and then laughingly licks
a syringe before injecting her
with heroin.
Shortly afterwards, McGre
gor busts into the room with
brass knuckles on and amusing
ly kicks Priestley's ass, proving
once and for all that Brandon
Walsh is in no way any match
for Obi-Wan Kenobi.
The movie continues its hec
tic and perplexing pace by relo
cating to Alaska, where Judd is
trying to settle down as a wait
ress and McGregor tries to
befriend her by pretending he
doesn't know her.
Things build toward a cli
mactic car/motorcycle chase
that ends in melodramatic sad
ness. When the final credits roll,
there's really not that much to
take away from this would-be
thriller that tries really hard to
succeed but doesn't quite hit
the mark.
If there's one thing to admire
in ibis film, it's the directing of
Stephen Elliott, who does a nice
ly innovative job of splicing
together hallucinatory images
and unusual camera shots.
The actors are fairly sharp in
their roles, for the most part,
and McGregor gives his usual
solid performance as the sym
pathetic protagonist. It's not a
total disappointment, but it
leaves the viewer with much to
be desired.
