# Making of 'Mikado' latest Leigh success
## 
### RANDY MANO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Director Mike Leigh sud
denly emerged from art-house

obscu r i t y
with his criti
cal 1 y
accla i m e d
"Secrets and
Lies" in

1996. Leigh, along with his ear
lier "Naked," tends to focus on
the subtleties of British life,
often pinpointing seemingly
unimportant sidebars of every
day happenings.
Here, in "Topsy-Turvy,"
Leigh moves another step for
ward by tackling the lives of
Gilbert and Sullivan, a famed
theater team of the 19th centu
ry. He gets a bravado perfor
mance from Jim Broadbent as
Gilbert and a winning support
ing act from Timothy Spall.
Don't let the topic discourage
you from seeing one of the
most fascinating directors at
work.
Broadbent plays Gilbert, the
librettist half of the duo, with
remarkable ease as the falling
star. When critics call his latest
work, "Princess Ida," the latest
mediocre example of the duo's
trademark "topsy-turvydom,"
Broadbent's rage is at once con
tained and scalding. His wife,
Lucy (Lesley Manville), feels
utterly unloved; his partner,
Sullivan (Allan Corduner), is
growing deathly ill and similar
ly feels that a void of ideas and
creativity is pervading their
efforts.
What to do? Leigh deftly
moves into a behind-the-scenes
look at what goes on in the lives
of those who are in theater.
Gilbert, at Lucy's request,
checks out a Japanese culture
exhibit — and, in the process,
has a light bull) go off inside his
head. Would a musical based
on the Orient hit it off with

audiences in England (and the
Continent)?
Gilbert and Sullivan fever
ishly work to get the look just
right for"The Mikado," even if
it means losing the corset and
wearing shortened trousers.
Still, hilarity (and underlying
racism) characterizes the pro
ceedings. Perhaps the best
scene of the movie is one that
involves dainty Japanese
women (played by real
Japanese women, for once in a
movie) trying to show British
women how to walk and act like
Asians. Many of you have likely
heard the song — namely
"Three Little Maids" —
involved in the scene.
Spall shines brightest from
"The Mikado" cast as theatrical
diva Richard Temple. Richard
nearly has a mental breakdown
when one of his musical scenes
is abruptly cut from the produc
tion by Gilbert. Spall's brilliance
is difficult to pull off without
bordering on the annoying or
the ridiculous, but he manages
to keep his actions l>elievable.
"Topsy-Turvy" gives you a
refreshing insider look at the
way musical productions may
have been made over a centu
ry ago. Leigh is still able to
highlight numerous — maybe
too numerous — side charac
ters involved in"The Mika
do," and how they all con
tribute to the final result.
Leigh's ability to flash between
the rehearsals and the actual
performance in front of an
audience is especially inven
tive. Go for the performances
and the original plot; stay
home if you want special
effects or sexy models.
