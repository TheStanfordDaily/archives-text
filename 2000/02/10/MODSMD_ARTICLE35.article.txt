# Valley of the dumb

### CHANEY RANKIN STAFF WRITER 
"If you liked the Old Testament,
you'll love Valley of the Dolls!"
exclaims publicist Irving Mans-

field in an
a m using
attempt to
push his
wife's now
famous novel

to a roomful of nuns.
Unfortunately, if you like
good movies, you'll hate "Isn't
She Great," the true story of
novelist Jacqueline Susann's rise
to stardom with a 448-page tell
all that redefined, for better or
for worse, the bounds of mod
ern prose.
Starring Bette Midler in a
less-than-divine role as Susann
and Nathan Lane as her adoring
husband and agent, this film
strives for a quirky, flamboyant
feel. Director Andrew Bergman
("Striptease," "It Could Happen
to You") fails miserably. Midler
and Lane, both usually fabulous
actors, have apparently been
told to ham it up as much as
they possibly can. One gets the
idea that Bergman wanted to
show us how intensely vivacious,
melodramatic, and lovable this
pair is, but all we get is the most
extravagant hand-wringing I
have ever seen in a film.
The story chronicles Susann's
endless attempts to achieve her
one goal: to become famous.
Aided by Mansfield and a couple
of vaguely amusing appearances
by her friend Florence Maybelle
(Stockard ('.banning, wasted in a
"wacky best friend" role that
feels forced), she writes an
expose of all the seamy Holly
wood secrets that she knows,
thinly disguised as fiction.
Once she finally gets a pub
lisher, David Hyde Pierce
appears as Michael Hastings, a
veiy Niles-like editor (we never
discover why such a stuffed shirt
is working for a publishing com
pany in which everyone else is in
full hippie mode). Naturally, the
bubbly Susann loosens him right
up and her book goes on to top
the best-seller list lor months,

Susann also battles breast can
cer and bears an autistic son dur
ing her quest for fame. If the
events depicted in "Isn't She
Great" weren't true, I would
assume that these touches had
been added by Bergman for
properly placed pathos
throughout the annoyingly
perky film. It's ostentatiously
narrated by Mansfield (it's based
on an article he wrote about his
life with Susann).
For a true story, this movie is
amazingly unrealistic and over
acted to the point of being
unpleasant. One is reminded of
a junior high play, when the
director tells the lead to put her
hand to her forehead here, and
sigh with pain there. It doesn't
help at all that the entire score
w<is written and performed by (I
am not making this up) Burt
Bacharach, lately of Austin Pow
ers fame. The movie's mediocre
humor and dragging scenes
might have been considerably
improved by gcxxl music that
would steer and sculpt the audi
ence's mood; the handcrafted
elevator music just makes it
worse.
Isn't She Great is another
sneaky film whose advertisers
put its only funny moments into
the previews — take Maybelle's
hysterically comical declaration
upon entering a jewelry store:
"If a man bought me those
pearls, not only would 1 have sex
with him, I would enjoy it!" for
instance. Though I tried, I
couldn't bring myself to enjoy
this movie. Avoid it at all costs.
