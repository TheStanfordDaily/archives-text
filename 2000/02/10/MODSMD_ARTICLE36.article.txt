# NBC's newest teen drama shakes one's faith in TV
## 
### ENO SARRIS STAFF WRITER 
That's it. Television sucks.
I've been a junkie in the past,
but I don't think I will tune in
to any new shows on the boob
tube after seeing "M.Y.0.8,"
NBC's newest piece of mid
season crap.
I really can't say anything
redeeming about "M.Y.0.8."
Just the title alone makes me
want to throw my TV out of
the window.
Haven't we already decided
that anachronisms are worth
less?
Didn't we get over shows
about high school last decade?
But on to my more substan
tial complaints about this
schlock.
Katharine Towne plays
Reilley, a teenage runaway
looking for her birth mother.
She narrates early in the pilot
episode that when she asked
her foster father if she was
adopted, his response was
"MYOB."
1 can't believe that anyone
would base the title on some
thing so ridiculously retarded.
NBC has its head up its ass.
112 he salient tension of the
show is in the relationship
between Towne and her newly
found and profoundly frigid
Aunt Opal, played by Lauren
Graham.
They are at it from moment
one, scolding and sarcastic in
their constant evaluations.
I just can't give a damn
though. Reilley is a tough as
nails go-getter that doesn't
arouse sympathy, and while
Opal shows possible tender
ness, the two are just plain
annoying.
Constant cat fighting just
ain't my thing.
Towne affirms in the first
episode that "we cast our TV
shows with people like us:
geeks, freeks, and Dawson's

creeps," as she waltzes her way
through the cafeteria.
This little quip embodies
two problems I had with
"M.Y.0.8."
First, this is an ugly high
school show at heart, with
stupid generalizations in a
cliched approach.
Second, Towne is aware
that she is the star of a televi
sion show.
Even making fun of itself
won't save "M.Y.0.8." from
utter mediocrity.
The entire attitude of the
show toward human interac
tion grates.
Towne claims that we all
find a partner to take us onto
the ark and keep us from
drowning, adding that we usu
ally get stuck with a partner
that no one else wants.
When Towne catches two
boys together in the parking
lot, the) immediately point
lingers and claim the other is
the gay one.
1 may be a romantic, but 1
didn't think the show had a
very endearing philosophy.
I lie cast doesn't perform
up to standard, either. The
low point of the show comes
from a "Real World: Hawaii"
graduate, Colin Mortensen.
He plays a dumb-as-rocks
office assistant.
I'd like to send a shout-out
to MTV for letting his acting
genius loose for the world to
enjoy.
Once again, while watching
a new network production, I
ached to change the channel
the entire half-hour.
I am definitely going to
have to change my battle cry
from "Change the Channel!!"
to "Turn it Oil!!"
