# Voodoo' works magic
## 
### STEVEN RAPHAEL SENIOR MUSIC CRITIC 
1 don't like hip-hop, and 1
don't like R&B. Personally, I've
never understood what people

see in it. The
repetitive,
programmed
dance beats
grate on my
nerves. It

doesn't really matter who the
singer is, it all basically sounds
the same to me â€” that is, until I
heard "Voodoo."
I was first encouraged to give
D'Angelo's new album a chance
because of the guest artists on the
album. D'Angelo features jazz
musicians Roy Hargrove and
Charlie Hunter, guitarist
Raphael Saadiq, the Roots'
drummer Ahmir Thompson,
and others. Unlike most hip-hop,
this singer didn't just program
his music. In fact, he actually
plays several instruments himself.
However, on my first t|iiick
sampling of the CI), I was
turned oil by the bass heavy,
seemingly generic beats. More
over, it seemed like there was
never a strong lead vocal taking
the lbreground of the songs.
Trying to understand it on its
own terms, I let it play all the
way through. Suddenly, it began
to make sense to me.
What I found was that
"Voodoo" flows as an album in a
way that no snippet can capture.
One song often blends straight
into the next. The many layers
of falsetto vocals swirl in and out
of the lead soul voice, creating
an enrapturing product.
The songs that feature the
jazz musicians seem to have an
extra sparkle to them. My
favorite song was "Spanish
Joint," a jazzy number featuring
guitarist Charlie Hunter. 1 his
song seemed to have the
strongest vocals, which are
paired with a jazz guitar. The
vocals reminded me somewhat
of the old Seal song "Crazy."
Moreover, there's even a rela
tively long guitar solo in the
middle of the song. The album

would have benefited from
more songs like this.
Other songs, like "The Line"
and "Send it On" are reminis
cent of soul legends Marvin
Gaye, Sly Stone and Curtis May
field.
Still others, like the second
single, "Untitled (How Does it
Feel)," exude raw sexuality.
Heavily aided by the video,
which shows the sex-symbol
D'Angelo completely naked, this
song is currently at #26 on the
Billboard charts.
However, I don't know if this
album has a # 1 single hidden in
it or not. Most songs are t<x) long
for radio, and lack a catchy
memorable chorus. Many seem
to be raw and undeveloped.
D'Angelo has said that his goal
is to be remembered as one of the
legends. Although he would like
to see his album become a com
mercial success, it is more impor
tant to him to continue moving
forward as a musician.
While "Voodoo" may not
score him a #1 single, it will cer
tainly propel him towards his
goal.
