# Greyboy Allstars brought in the funk for nearly a decade
## 
### STEVEN RAPHAEL SENIOR MUSIC CRITIC 
Formed in 1993 by saxophonist
Karl Denson, The Greyboy All
stars were a "funk dance party,"

luring crowds
across the
globe onto the
dance floor
with their
boog a 1 o o

based funk-jazz. Quickly finding a
niche with an under-30 audience,
the group introduced jazz to peo
ple raised on hip-hop and dance
music and helped to usher in the
beginnings of acid jazz. With each
member bringing in a diverse set
of influences, the Greyboy Allstars
soon became one of the hottest
grassroots bands in the country.
Over the next six years, they
released three albums and record
ed the soundtrack to the major
motion picture "Castle Rock."
Their most recent album, " Fhe
Greyboy Allstars Live," documents
the group at the height of their
sold-out 1998 tour. The album is a
good representation of the All
stars, showcasing their danceable
jazz grooves and impressive saxo
phone, guitar, and organ improvi
sations.
In 1998, the group took a long
break from touring. This facilitat
ed the development of three side
projects: Karl Denson's Tiny Uni
verse, Robert Walter's 20th
Congress, and Elgin Park. After
maintaining ambiguous status for
nearly a year, The Greyboy All
stars finally announced that they
have called it quits.
Rising from the ashes, the
three side projects are currently
carrying the musical torch
onward. Each of the bands, led by
former Allstars members, are
touring and attracting fans like
the pied piper.
One reason for their success
might be their open taping policy:
all three groups not only permit,
but encourage fans to record their
concerts. This helps to "get the
word out," Denson said, "and
that's the way a lot of people hear
us for the first time."
"It's also nice to know that on

some of those nights when you
have a lot of magic happen, some
body got it,"he added.
Keyboardist Robert Walter
expressed similar sentiments. "It's
just a way so the people who dig ii
can have the most at home," he
said.
Frontman Karl Denson is now
touring with his own group, Tiny
Universe. "We're trying to be a
soul band," Denson explained.
"We're doing a lot of vocals, a little
bit more R&B [than the Greyboy
Allstars], a little bit more jazz, and
trying to keep it dancey."
Leading the group, Denson
sings, plays the saxophone and the
flute, and writes most of the mate
rial. The band also features trum
pet, guitar, bass, keyboard, and
drums. Denson often harmonizes
with the trumpet player, and he
shares solos with both the trumpet
player and the guitarist.
Denson's voice is a shot of
pure 70's soul, yet his instru
mental prowess is what truly
defines the Tiny Universe. On
both tenor saxophone and flute,
he pours out melodic solos that
show off his jazz and soul back
ground. At times, he can be
heard singing along with his
flute solos for added emphasis.
No stranger to the stage, Den
son has been drawing attention
for quite a while. In 1989, he
joined Lenny Kravitz's band, tour
ing with them and recording on
Kravitz's first two albums. Then,
in 1993, he left the group to pur
sue a solo career as a jazz musi
cian. He recorded several albums
under his own name before form
ing the Greyboy Allstars.
Denson's future goals for liny
Universe are "just to keep playing,
touring, and making more
records." He hopes to eventually
sign with a major label and use the
added promotion to get "really
big." Fhe band has already
released their first album, entitled
simply "Karl Denson's Tiny Uni
verse," and plans to record their
next this summer.
After recording a solo album
that featured saxophone legend
Gary Bart/., Robert Walter enlist
ed some of his hometown buddies

to form 20th Congress. The
organ-led group also features alto
saxophone, bass, and drums.
Walter describes his new band
as "what I was bringing into the
Allstars, amplified." It is "more
compositionally oriented, more on
the outside of things, a little more
dissonant, and a little more hyper
ranged than the Allstars."
20th Congress puts on a com
manding live show, keeping
crowds dancing throughout the
night while still finding time for
dissonant explorations and fierce
improvisations. New drummer
George Sluppick has helped the
group expand into "more
advanced music," Walter said.
With influences as varied as
rare liink records, soul jazz organ
legends, and rock music, the
group is always exploring new
musical territory. For example, at
one show, a spacey effect-ridden
alto saxophone took the audience
on a strange journey that culmi
nated in an instrumental version
of the Grateful Dead's epic jam
song, "Dark Star."
The group has already record
ed an El' entitled "Health and Fit
ness," and their first full length
album is scheduled to be released
this May. Looking for something
to make the new album special,
Walter decided to feature Galactic
drummer Stanton Moore, whose
unique style of drumming mixes
well with the 20th Congress
sound.
Walter's ultimate goal for the
band is to remain indie, "play the

stuff I like and put out records so
the people who dig it can listen to
it." He is a musician driven pure
ly by love of the music.
"[Doing what you love] will
make you a lot happier than doing
something you don't like and hav
ing a lot of money," he said.
Guitarist Mike Andrews,
known to Greyboy Allstars' fans as
Elgin Park, took a musical 180
degree turn from the sound of the
Allstars. His new group, Elgin
Park, is an indie rock band best
described as a mix between
Dinosaur Jr., Elvis Costello, and
the Foo Fighters.
"After extended improvisation
al jams with the Greyboy Allstars
for six years," .Andrews said, "our
goal was to create musically and
emotionally concise, tightly
arranged pop ditties and other
more expansive sonic landscapes."
Elgin Park's songs are short,
upbeat, and pleasant. Andrews'
vocals have an untrained kind of
charm to them, as he naturally
taps into emotional realms too
often left untouched. It's no
stretch to imagine seeing the
group on MTV someday.
The band has recorded one
album on which Robert Walter
plays keyboards. It was recorded
in their home recording studio "to
deliver a freshly diverse record to
the public with no creative com
promises or struggles with record
labels," Andrews said. Although
satisfied with their current status,
the group is keeping their eyes
peeled for the right record label.
