# Rock, rap mix falls flat

Combining rock and hip
hop never works. Contrary to

the success of
Kid Rock and
Limp Bizkit,
the fusion of
the two is a
trend that

probably will
be short-lived. What fails worse
is attempting to make a sound
track comprised of both hip
hop and alternative rock. Who
would buy such an album?
Would the common hip-hop
head? Would the grungy alter
native lover? Neither would
invest their $16 to get half of
what they want and for this
reason, the "Any Given Sun
day" soundtrack is just not a
good mixture of music.
Although some of the music
complements the movie well,
like Kid Rock's "F**k That"
and Mystikal's "Jump," a lot of
the songs are empty and seem
randomly thrown in, such as
Missy Elliot's generic rendition
of "Who You Gonna Call."
Jamie Foxx tries to cross over
to the music industry, sound
ing like any other uninspired,
unoriginal R&B singer. The

cover of the album promises
songs by DMX and Mobb
Deep, and although both add
quality tracks, but the artists'
fans will realize that both songs
appeared 011 previous albums.
Songs by Hole, P.0.D., and
Overseer all lack substance,
seemingly trying to imitate a
child just discovering his moth
er's pots and pans.
However, the album does
have a notable highlight, with
Capone-N-Noreaga's much
anticipated "Reunion." This is
the reuniting of a group that
was forced to split because of
Capone's incarceration.
In "Reunion," Capone dis
cusses the hard times he had to
endure. Another highlight is
Goodie Mobb's "Sole Sunday."
This song captures the essence
of the movie by painting the
picture of a hot Sunday high
lighted by the main event.
Unfortunately, few songs
are worth listening to more
than once, giving the sound
track an inevitable future of
being permanently left on a
shelf to collect dust.
