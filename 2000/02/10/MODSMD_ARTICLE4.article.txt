# Grads pick jobs over education
## 
### DEENA SKOLNICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As graduation looms on the
horizon, seniors are asking them
selves the inevitable question: to
apply or not to apply?
While many seniors choose to
continue their education, more
and more students are deciding to
get jobs before going to graduate
school, according to officials at the
Career Development Center.
This year's seniors have not yet
been surveyed as to their post
graduation plans. Based on data
from past years, CDC Director
Hob Thirsk estimates that roughly
40 percent of Stanford seniors go
to graduate school immediately
after graduation.
An additional 30 to 40 percent
of students follow this path within
a year. The vast majority of the re
maining students move into the
job market, while a small number
of students choose to travel or
work in public service.
However, over the past five
years, the number of students de
ciding to go to graduate school im
mediately alter graduation has de
creased by 5 to 10 percent.
Thirsk said he is pleased with
this trend. He believes that stu
dents should "take a year or two
oil and work, see what they're in
teresting in doing. II grad school is
slill a part of 11 heir future], then
they should go."
Senior Lynn Shapiro, a biology
major, said she agrees with
I hirsk's advice. Shapiro was origi
nally considering applying to
medical school this year, but she is
now taking a year oil lo work at a
health t are consulting linn.
"Kventually, I'll go to med or
business school. . . bm I want time
oil to try something else first."
Economics major Reinier
Musters, a senior, also has decided
against graduate school, lit' is in
the process of'forming Ins own I n
tei net startup company.
"I'm not quite ready for grad
school yet," he said. "I need lo gel
out, do some other things."
1 hirsk cited several reasons lor
why students feel the need to con
tinue their education. "A fair num
ber of those students [who go to
graduate school| want lo go into
higher ediu alion, so they need ad
vanced degrees. Oilier students
will say, 'The job market doesn'i
liivor ilie, so I'll go ba< k to s( liool
and gel anothei degree to build
my skill base.'

I .keke decided not lo gel a job

immediately because, "I really
want to get my master's," she said.
"With that, I can do more in the
public health sector and have
more training and education."
A need to be more prepared for
a job also motivated David Albert
son, a religious studies major ap
plying for a graduate degree in
theology. "I feel like I have a lot
more to learn in my field," he said.
Albertson also based his decision
to go to graduate school on his love
lor the subject.
"I'm really enjoying what I'm
doing," he said. "I'm just starting
10 scratch the surface."
Senior human biology major
Lisa Menenses is one of the few se
niors who is neither planning to go
to graduate school nor enter the
job market. Although she was a
preniedical student and still plans
to attend medical school in a few
years, she plans to take some time
011 to explore other options.
"I'm doing the things 1 never
had (he lime to do, like taking art
classes . .. there's a lot of stuff I
think I need to experience before
med school," she said.
According to Thirsk, the job
market is a driving factor in (liede
cision between graduate school
and a job. He said, "There is al
ways a proportionate and inverse
relationship between how good
the job market is and the numbers
of students that go to grad school."
Although the CDC. does not
track exact numbers, Thirsk ad
mitted to seeing a pattern. In gen
eral. science majors tend to move

into the job market much more
quickly than humanities majors.
Although this has been a gener
al rule for some years, the split has
intensified recently because of the
economy. Thirsk said that the cur
rent job market does not tend to
favor humanities graduates.
Senior Michael Kiefler, an Eng
lish major, is an exception to this
rule. He is looking for a job as an
assistant editor at a San Francisco
magazine, or as a consultant.
"1 wanted to do something dif
ferent fioni grad school. 1 wanted
a break from studying," he said.
Kiefler claimed that t he skills he
learned as an English major were
helpful in his job search, especially
the ability to communicate on
paper and in person.
Other seniors also feel that
Stanford prepared them well for
their chosen future. Many praised
the resources at the (IDC, which
include career counseling, inter
view preparation, resume work
shops and an on-campus recruit
ing program that sets up inter
views with companies looking to
hire Stanford students.
"[Stanford] has a pretty com
plex recruiting structure. It helps
a lot, especially iu the initial inter
view and getting your foot in the
door," Kiefler said.
The Stanford name is also a
plus to many seeking jobs, accord
ing to Musters.
"1 lie greatest thing about Stan

more to learn in my field," he said.
Albertson also based his decision
to go to graduate school on his love
lor the subject.
"I'm really enjoying what I'm
doing," he said. "I'm just starting
10 scratch the surface."
Senior human biology major
Lisa Menenses is one of the few se
niors who is neither planning to go
to graduate school nor enter the
job market. Although she was a
preniedical student and still plans
to attend medical school in a few
years, she plans to take some time
011 to explore other options.
"I'm doing the things 1 never
had (he lime to do, like taking art
classes . .. there's a lot of stuff I
think I need to experience before
med school," she said.
According to Thirsk, the job
market is a driving factor in (liede
cision between graduate school
and a job. He said, "There is al
ways a proportionate and inverse
relationship between how good
the job market is and the numbers
of students that go to grad school."
Although the CDC. does not
track exact numbers, Thirsk ad
mitted to seeing a pattern. In gen
eral. science majors tend to move

into the job market much more
quickly than humanities majors.
Although this has been a gener
al rule for some years, the split has
intensified recently because of the
economy. Thirsk said that the cur
rent job market does not tend to
favor humanities graduates.
Senior Michael Kiefler, an Eng
lish major, is an exception to this
rule. He is looking for a job as an
assistant editor at a San Francisco
magazine, or as a consultant.
"1 wanted to do something dif
ferent fioni grad school. 1 wanted
a break from studying," he said.
Kiefler claimed that t he skills he
learned as an English major were
helpful in his job search, especially
the ability to communicate on
paper and in person.
Other seniors also feel that
Stanford prepared them well for
their chosen future. Many praised
the resources at the (IDC, which
include career counseling, inter
view preparation, resume work
shops and an on-campus recruit
ing program that sets up inter
views with companies looking to
hire Stanford students.
"[Stanford] has a pretty com
plex recruiting structure. It helps
a lot, especially iu the initial inter
view and getting your foot in the
door," Kiefler said.
The Stanford name is also a
plus to many seeking jobs, accord
ing to Musters.
"1 lie greatest thing about Stan
lord is that it opens up a lot of
doors. People start taking you seri
ously."
