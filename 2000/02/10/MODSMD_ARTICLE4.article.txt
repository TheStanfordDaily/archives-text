# Grads pick jobs over education

### DEENA SKOLNICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As graduation looms on the
horizon, seniors are asking them
selves the inevitable question: to
apply or not to apply?
While many seniors choose to
continue their education, more
and more students are deciding to
get jobs before going to graduate
school, according to officials at the
Career Development Center.
This year's seniors have not yet
been surveyed as to their post
graduation plans. Based on data
from past years, CDC Director
Hob Thirsk estimates that roughly
40 percent of Stanford seniors go
to graduate school immediately
after graduation.
An additional 30 to 40 percent
of students follow this path within
a year. The vast majority of the re
maining students move into the
job market, while a small number
of students choose to travel or
work in public service.
