### ROXY SASS Roxy Sass 
So, you re going on your
dorm ski trip sometime this
month? What better way to
deflower the virgin snow and
smell of pine than a little hanky
panky with your snow bunny on
the ski lift?
While Miss Sass has heard this
is a popular American fantasy,
she doesn't think it quite works.
Heavy skis will make it almost
impossible to crawl aboard a
partner's lap, and sharp poles
will likely poke in all the wrong
places (if you manage to keep
hold of them at all). Even if you
enjoy the feel of icy metal against
your bare skin. Miss Sass warns
that—while she usually condones
"letting go" during sex—it could
be particularly dangerous in this
situation.
Finally, the number of gawk
ing snowboarders you pass on
your way to the top of the moun
tain could make you think twice,
no matter how much of an exhi
bitionist you are. Then again,
maybe you'd like to be stopped
by the ski patrol for indecent
exposure.
On the other hand, wander
ing hands underneath bulky ski
clothes are a great way to
encourage your ski buddy to
pant in some fresh mountain air
without getting too much
unwanted attention.
Ever dreamed of sucking an
icicle? You might be able to gel
away with your head bobbing in
your partner's lap—just pretend
you're adjusting your bindings,
and make sure you don't acci
dentally get your tongue stuck to
anything frozen. Miss Suss is still

investigating whether there is
any deeper relationship between
the words "popsicle" and "testi
cle" besides the last four letters.
II you're craving sex on snow
or you're still experimenting
with the exhibitionist mentality,
a gondola could be the perfect
way to avoid arousing too much
suspicion. Just Ik- careful not to
rock it off its wire. Who knows,
maybe Eskimos do have more
fun.
It is now widely accepted that
many couples enjoy the thrill of
having sex in "public." That
doesn't necessarily mean they
want a bunch of voyeurs
around—the thrill conies from
the possibility of being seen
rather than the actuality. Statis
tics show many American cou
ples enjoy having sex in semi
public places because the act
makes them feel more daring
and liberated.
Now, for those who can't get
up to the mountains any time
soon but are still looking to join
the Inn, you haven't been forgot
ten. I here are plenty of ways to
enjoy "sharing your love openly
with those around you" right
here on campus.
For instance, the next time
you and your special someone
are searching for the right book
in the South Mezzanine, you can
probably make the assumption
that you won't be disturbed.
However, the point of the
exercise, of course, is that you
can never be too sure.
Ciuys, press her up against a
bookcase and ;isk her if she'd like
to swipe your library card. She'll
probably be more than willing to
oblige.
