# Classic animation style gets 'Tigger' bouncing
## 
### MICHAEL BAER STAFF WRITER 
When I first saw that Disney
was bringing Winnie the Pooh,
I'igger and friends to the big

screen for the
first time in
decades, I
was a bit
skeptical.
What pur-

pose could be served in releas
ing "The Tigger Movie," a fea
ture-length film with old-fash
ioned animation, just months
after such modern animated
films as "Tar/an" and "Toy

Story 2"? My cynicism, howev
er, disappeared soon after the
lights dimmed.
Like many recent films in
this age where the nuclear fam
ily has gone the way of the
typewriter, this film was funda
mentally about the search for
family, finding others like you
who love you and attaining a
sense of belonging. At the
opening of the film is the first
of many clever and enjoyable
musical numbers, in which I ig
ger declares, "The best thing
about tiggers is that I'm the
only one!" His carelessness
and lust for life captivate the
audience while they alterna
tively inspire and irk his
friends, who often lie in the
wake of their wreckage. Joy
soon turns to loneliness when
d igger realizes that he has no
one to bounce with, no one
able to propel themselves via

their tail the way only a tigger
can. His friends give him vari
ous pieces of advice, ot which
lie hears a smidgen or two, and
he soon resolves to find his
family. In the most inspired
musical sequence, he dreams of
what it might be like to have a
family full of tiggers, as person
ified in everything from Dali
and Picasso portraits to tiggers
swimming and dancing like
something out of an old MGM
classic.
In addition to the grandiosity
of the musical numbers, the
main advantage of bringing this
to the big screen is that the adult

audience mem-

bers are able to
note the artwork
of the film. In
the impressionis
tic quality of this
cartoon world, a
pencil line is
aUowecl an expressi
vei less rarely shown
on such a scale.
Of course, all
this might pale in

comparison to
the masterful strides Disney has
made in 90s animation — in
visuals, story, and song — but the
pure excitement of "The Tigger
Movie" more than makes up for
this. A. A. Milne's characters are
as timeless as ever: Winnie the
Pooh, the struggling soul, with
his friend Pigiet; Eeyore, the self
actualizing pessimist; and Owl,
the intellectual who often fails in
distinguishing forest from trees,
rigger's search leads to a few
adventures, all effortlessly fitting
into the film as a whole. As cliche
as it sounds, "TheTigger Movie"
is a wonderful experience for
children of all ages.
