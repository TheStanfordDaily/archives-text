# 'Carmen' makes big impression despite San Jose's small stage

Before Ccorges Bizet's opera
"Carmen" had even been seen by

patrons of
()pera San |ose,
the company's
l)ox office
records had
been shattered

and three performances added.
Carmen has come a long way
since 1875, when its brazen sensu
ality shocked even the most open
minded of Parisians. Today, it is

the most popular opera in the
repertoire, and the music is a sta
ple of orchestra concerts and tele
vision commercials alike.
The story, set in Spain, con
cerns the gypsy girl Carmen
(Layna
Chianakas), a woman on the
112 ringe of society who captures the
hearts of men only to leave them
when they grow tiresome. After
causing a ruckus in the streets one
day, she is arrested, only to seduce
her captor, cavalry corporal Don

Jose (Thomas I ruhitte).
Don |ose lets her escape and
deserts the army, but is torn
between ( at men and the innocent
girl next door, Micaela (Christina
Major), who his mother would
have him marry. At the same time,
Carmen is attracted to a pompous
Seville bullfighter named Kscamil
lo (Roberto Bellas Comez.) who
eventually seeks her out at her
Cypsy camp, only to find Don
Jose.
Director Daniel Hellgot has
succeeded in raising a modern
incarnation of the opera in the rel-

atively intimate Montgomery The
ater. I he venue is not a typical
grandiose, velvet-laden opera
house with a mile-long stage. 1
have seen a semi-staged produc
tion of Carmen in a larger house
with a bigger chorus and more
dramatic movement, yet Opera
San Jose's singers, orchestra, and
staging have been artfully syn
chronized to form a sophisticated,
modern production on a smaller
stage. On Saturday's opening
night, the male chorus began the

show tentatively, but warmed up
to the enthusiastic audience.
The orchestra, featuring Stan
lord instructor Mark Veregge on
percussion, maintained a notice
able restraint throughout the pro
duction, even dining the most
exuberant parts of the score, but
especially in the overture and first
act. The performers followed suit,
wisely saving their vocal chops for
the more emotional scenes to fol
low. Longer recitatives, added to
the opera by composers after
Bizet's death, have been cut in
favor of snappy French dialogue.

Chianakas truly
relishes her role, and
makes Carmen almost
more comic than sen
sual. She makes oper
atic singing seem
effortless, performing
difficult passages while
danc ing, teasing, lying
down, tied up, or even
through gnashing
teeth. Truhitte has a
strong voice but a
somewhat stiff
demeanor, which
hampers his believabil
ity in his long scenes
with Carmen. There is
much more chemistry
in his fleeting, tenta
tive moments with
Micaela, as there is
whenever Carmen
looks Escamillo in the
eye.

The show-stop
pers are Major and Gomez as
Micaela and Escamillo. Major has
an incredible soprano voice, and
does justice to Bizet's songs.
Gomez commands the stage with
humor and charisma.
Aimee Patrice Puentes, a little
girl with a huge voice, also stands
out as Frasquita, a Gypsy girl.
