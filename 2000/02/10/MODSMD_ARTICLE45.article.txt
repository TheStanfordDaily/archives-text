and a Nightingale Sang" is a play
based in war-torn England. The

story brings
the audience
into the mid
dle-class home
of the Stott
family, which

consists of two daughters (Helen
and Joyce), their parents (George
and Peggy) and their grandfa
ther (Andie).
Two other characters com
plete the small cast: Eric, who
marries Joyce in the first scene of
the play, and Norman, whose
attachment to Helen remains a
focal point of tension through
out.
Unmarried and slightly crip
pled, eldest daughter Helen, as
the narrator, uses her quiet,
unobtrusive strength to hold the
frantic Stott family together.
Joyce is beautiful, flirtatious and
indecisive, constantly begging

those around her lor advice.'l lie
entire first scene circles around
her confusion as to whether she
should marry Eric, who is sitting
in the parlor below, waiting to
propose.
Peggy spends her time either
praying or fretting over religious
matters. Devoutly Catholic, she
remains oblivious to the subtle
changes within her household.
George, a former coalman,
pounds away merrily at the
piano, joins the Communist party
and fends off the confusion in his
very feminine household with
humorous remarks and teasing.
He and Andie keep the audience
grinning.
Andie, a veteran of the 112 irst
World War, lives between the
households of his two daughters,
though he prefers to stay with
Peggy. His love for animals
prompts him to carry his cat with
him everywhere, even providing
it with a child's gas mask.
Plot is of secondary impor
tance, as the entertainment lies
within enjoying the endearing

c haracter sketches and relation
ship tangles that Taylor presents.
Eric and Norman come and go,
twisting the hearts of both Joyce
and Helen. Joyce vacillates
between loathing and loving her
husband. Helen, who has spent
30 years hiding herself, blooms
under the attention of the mar
ried Norman. Meanwhile,
Peggy confesses sinful thoughts
about the village priest, and
Andie tries advertising for a wife
in order to have a permanent
place of his own. Air raids, sirens,
tea and biscuits abound as this
truly British story unfolds.
If you haven't made a trip to
the litis Barn Theater yet, it is
well worth the short drive into
I.os Altos.
