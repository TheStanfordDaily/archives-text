# New book explores the meaning of manhood
## 
### RENEE CANADA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jan L. Waldron's "In the Country of Men: My
Travels" is a provocative musing on gender, male
female relationships and the meaning of "man
hood." Both a social commentary and memoir,
Waldron's book uses her personal experiences as a
daughter, girlfriend, wife and mother to explore
the roles men are expected to play in this society.
At first, Waldon explores the tenuous relation
ship between father and daughter by recalling her
own experiences with her father, a man incapable
of fully taking on the adult responsibilities of father
and husband. Poignantly retelling the childhood
memory of the time when she lost faith in her
father, Waldron marks this moment as the begin
ning of her frustrations with men and with the con
fining definitions of manhood embraced by society.
Later in life, abandoned by her husband, Wal
dron must raise her sons alone. In the difficult
position of being the sole parent, Waldron begins
to define a new notion of manhood in her upbring
ing of sensitive but strong young men.
Waldon sees the current definition of manhood
as repressive and limited, producing men who are

uncomfortable with the intimate details and
responsibilities of everyday life and who struggle to
fully express themselves emotionally. As a mother,
Waldron realizes the power she has to shape her
male children in a positive way. She wants to
impress on her own sons a sense of belonging,
comfort with themselves and courage to be indi
viduals who realize their humanity in a full sense.
By the book's end, Waldron finally finds a man
with whom she can find a happy, loving, uplifting
and lasting relationship. With her lover and chil
dren providing hope for the succeeding genera
tions of manhood, Waldron leaves the reader opti
mistic about the future of men in society and about
the male-female relationships in their own lives.
Neither subscribing to male-bashing nor to
absolutes, Waldron's "In the Country of Men: My
Travels" provides a refreshing dialogue about gen
der, told with honesty, humor and courage.
