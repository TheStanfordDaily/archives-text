# Senate, GSC happy after split
## ASSU break-up deemed useful one year after amendment 
### BEN ALEXANDER-BLOCH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last year's vote to split the ASSU Sen
ate into two distinct legislative bodies, the
Undergraduate Senate and the Graduate
School Council, has created a more efli
cient and productive student body, ac
cording to ASSU and GSC leaders.
"Neither are really 'new' bodies: the
Undergraduate Senate is essentially the
old ASSU Senate without the graduate
students and much of the bureaucracy;
the GSC existed for several years before
the amendment and was the most promi
nent graduate student advocacy group on
issues like housing and stipend levels,"
said ASSU President Mike Levin, a junior.
The ASSU is now comprised of the 15-
member Undergraduate Senate and the
15-member GSC, both of which are mon
itored by ASSU's executive branch.
"The changes in the ASSU structure
last year have been spectacularly success
ful. The old ASSU Senate was so en
snared in its own bureaucracy and cere
mony that it could never present a strong
voice for the interests of students," said
Dave Robin son," a doctoral student in

NJs Hialvsis

chemistry.
Robinson served last year on both the
GSC and the ASSU Senate and chaired
the Administration and Rules committee
that drafted the changes to the constitu
tion and bylaws.
Formerly, many believed the ASSU
Senate could not effectively meet the
needs of graduate students.
"It systematically discriminated
against graduate students when distribut
ing fee money, and often fouled up the
transactions it did approve," Robinson
said.
The GSC presently focuses on the
graduate students' unique needs. It aims
to improve the quality of life of graduate
students by discussing housing, health in
surance and child care issues, while also
helping to fund the graduate student
groups which try to unite the diverse
graduate community.
These issues were often overlooked
under the old ASSU Senate, as they did
not relate directly to undergradu
ates. Lite issue of housing, for ex
ample, primarily concerns the
graduate community.
"Housing is the biggest issue by
far that the GSC has worked to
wards. I lie prices that people have
to pay for housing are substantial
and, yet, it has been announced
that the off-campus subsidized
graduate housing program may
face cuts. Undergraduates, on the
other hand, do not have to worry
about housing, as it is provided for
them all four years," said GSC
Chair Kaleb Midland, a doctoral

student in physics.
The Undergraduate Senate
has focused on three issues:
transportation and parking, stu
dent space and outreach to the
undergraduate population.
"They choose to fcxrus on these
three issues as they deemed them to
be the most pressing among under
graduates ... They have made sig
nificant advances on all three of
these fronts," said ASSU Vice Presi
dent John Mills, a doctoral student
in genetics.
When the two bodies have had
to work together, they have
seemed to do so smoothly.
"There have been few cases
where the GSC and the Under
graduate Senate have needed to
take joint action, and they were han

dled efficiently," Robinson said.
The general consensus seems
to be that the new structure of the
ASSU is more effective than old.
"It is my belief that the new
GSC and Undergraduate Senate
governing structures of the ASSU
have proved very effective thus far
in allowing both governing bodies
to operate more efficiently and ef
fectively," said Dean of Students
Marc Wais.
Mills said he understands this ef
ficiency is extremely important for
Stanford's fast-paced environment.
"With the limited amount of
time that busy Stanford students
have to offer outside of the class
room, the new system allows the
ASSU to maximize its efforts on
behalf ofall students," Mills said.
