# Senate, GSC happy after split
## ASSU break-up deemed useful one year after amendment 
### BEN ALEXANDER-BLOCH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last year's vote to split the ASSU Sen
ate into two distinct legislative bodies, the
Undergraduate Senate and the Graduate
School Council, has created a more efli
cient and productive student body, ac
cording to ASSU and GSC leaders.
"Neither are really 'new' bodies: the
Undergraduate Senate is essentially the
old ASSU Senate without the graduate
students and much of the bureaucracy;
the GSC existed for several years before
the amendment and was the most promi

issues like housing and stipend levels,"
said ASSU President Mike Levin, a junior.

snared in its own bureaucracy and cere
mony that it could never present a strong
voice for the interests of students," said

GSC and the ASSU Senate and chaired
the Administration and Rules committee
that drafted the changes to the constitu

Senate could not effectively meet the
needs of graduate students.
"It systematically discriminated
against graduate students when distribut
ing fee money, and often fouled up the
transactions it did approve," Robinson
said.
The GSC presently focuses on the
graduate students' unique needs. It aims
to improve the quality of life of graduate
students by discussing housing, health in
surance and child care issues, while also
helping to fund the graduate student
groups which try to unite the diverse
graduate community.
These issues were often overlooked
under the old ASSU Senate, as they did
