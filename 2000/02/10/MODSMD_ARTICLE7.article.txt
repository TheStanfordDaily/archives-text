### DENNIS TYLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Arc you tired of waiting in long lines to
receive your mail from the new temporary
post office on Levin Field? If the answer is
yes, a meeting with postal officials next
week may give you a chance to do sonic
thing about it.
On Tuesday night, the ASSU Under
graduate Senate convened for its Kith
meeting to discuss continuing student con
cerns with the Stanford Post Office.
The Senate has invited officials from the
United States Post ()lf ice to its next meeting
to address student complaints.
"The treatment that Stanford students
and faculty are being subjected to at the
Stanford Post Office is unacceptable," said
Senate Chair Steven Aronowitz, a senior.
"I look forward to working with the
Postal Service and any interested students
in finding solutions to these serious prob
lems," he added.
"We should get as many students as pos
sible to participate in next week's meeting
because it is an important issue for people
all around campus," said ASSU President
Mike Levin, a junior.

The officials will discuss disability access,
drainage problems, wait times and the lack
of vending machines, among other issues.
According to Deputy Senate Chair Ben
Liu, a junior, "This is a great opportunity
for people to voice their complaints to those
who can actually make a difference."
"The University does not run the Post
Office and Tuesday we will be talking to
people who arc actually in charge. I hope
students take advantage of this chance to
have a meaningful dialogue," Liu said.
To assure these issues are addressed Ity
the Postal Service, the ASSI may develop'a
joint task force with representatives from
U.S. Congresswoman Anna Kshoo's office.
The ASSL .ilso approved funding for
Imani Productions, Stanford Friends of
Tibet and the Persian Student Association.
However, there were some apprehen
sions about funding the Persian Student
Association, which is planning to put on a
traditional music performance for the Stan
ford community.
Some questioned whether the group
should charge Stanford students for the
event if the ASSI funds the program.
"Although I support the Persian Stu
dent Association ... 1 feel that programs
funded by the ASSI should be open to stu
dents for free," Liu said.
Some Senators suggested that the Per
sian Student Association subsidize part ol
the fee for Stanford students so that they
pay less than off-campus students.
