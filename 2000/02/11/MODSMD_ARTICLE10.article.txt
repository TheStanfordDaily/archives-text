I he seventh annual Bhangra
By the Bay dance competition,
featuring traditional Indian
dance, will be held this Saturday,
Feb. 12 at Dinkelspiel Auditori
um.
Although Bhangra By the Bay
started with the participation of
schools from ac l oss Northern (Cal
ifornia - including UC-Berkeley,
I (l-Davisand San Jose State-this
is the first year in which schools
from outside the hay Area will at
tend.
"Bhangra By the Bay lias tradi
tionally been one of the most sue -
cesslul events of the year, because
this is the largest scale Bhangra
competition in the west coast,"
s;iid Manila Mehta, a co-organi/ci
loi Bhangra this year.
Sonic of the new faces of this

year's competing groups will in
clude two teams Irom UCLA and
one from Rice.
"In comparison to the past,
which only expended a total of
$600, this year we are giving out
.$2,000 worth ol money as awards
in total. I think this has provided
the main incentive for schools
outside the vicinity to attend,"
said Mehta.
I here are some worries about
security issues because of a small
disturbance caused by non-Stan
ford attendees at Bhangra in
1998. A fight broke out briefly in
the crowd, and in response, secu
rity at last year's event was in
creased.
I he organizers have taken ad
ditional measures to maintain se
curity again this year.
"We've hired ten police officers
to work over-lime; we're going to

stamp the audience's hands to
keep track of the viewers, and
we've set metal detectors in the
entrance of the auditorium," said
senior Raj Duvvuri, who is work
ing on the event.
Organizers are largely confi
dent about this year's improved
security.
" These are taken as preventive
measures, and I'm pretty sure
nothing will happen," said Mehta.
Bhangra is a traditional form
of dance originating from the
state of Punjab, in northern India.
It is normally performed by men
after the harvest season. The dif
ferent types of movement corre
spond to agricultural activities, al
lowing the dancers to express
themselves in a show of strength
and agility.
Bhangra's popularity has taken
off in the past decade, and has be

come one of the more popular
forms of dance in the world. The
art form has grown to include
women. The music for the dance
has also changed to incorporate
modern beats such as hip hop.
Owing to this rising popularity,
the Bhangra By the Bay dance
competition was initiated 7 years
ago by Stanford's South Asian stu
dent organization, Sanskriti.
The primary aim of Bhangra is
to "unite Indians and South
Asians at Stanford and across the
U.S. under the banner of Indian
art," said Duvvuri.
Since security is not a concern,
the primary worry of the organiz
ers is that they expect Bhangra to
be oversold.
"It's horrible. I didn't expect to
sell this much, and I'm losing
sleep over it," said Mehta, with a
laugh.
