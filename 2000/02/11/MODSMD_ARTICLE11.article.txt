## Scientists gain new understanding of the Big Bang 
### 
(iENEVA (AP) — Scientists trying to
understand the origins of the universe
said yesterday they have moved a step
closer, creating a "primordial soup" of
subatomic particles they believe resembles
the universe during the earliest moments
of creation.
1 he discovery is a breakthrough in the
attempt to study the exact moment of the
Big Bang, the fiery explosion in which sci
entists believe the universe was born.
In the experiments, scientist's at
ClfcßN, the European Laboratory for Par
tide Physics, were able to recreate a state
of matter that hasn't existed since the first

few microseconds — or millionths of a
second — after the explosion.
The widely accepted Big Bang theory
holds that at the beginning of time, all
matter in the universe was compressed
into a tiny ball held together by incredibly
strong gravity. The ball eventually burst
apart, sending the matter that would
eventually become stars and planets
hurtling into space.
Scientists have long believed that in the
moments after the explosion, quarks and
gluons — the smallest known particles —
floated freely in space. Afterwards, they
joined to form larger particles that went

on to make up the matter of the universe.
But until now, scientists never had
compelling evidence that free-floating
quarks and gluons ever existed. 1 hey had
seen the particles only in their "trapped"
state as part of'larger matter.
In the CERN experiments, 350 scien
tists from the United States, Europe,
Japan and India were able to generate
heat 1 ()(),()()() times greater than the cen
ter of the snn. The resulting plasma, or
"soup," fleetingly contained thousands of
freely floating quarks.
"We have recreated matter in a state
we have never seen before," the scientists

said in a statement.
Johanna Stat hel, a physicist from Ger
many's Heidelberg University, explained
the complicated discovery another way.
She compared quarks and gluons to
water and bigger particles like atoms to
ice.
Imagine believing that water theoreti
cally existed but being unable to generate
enough heat to melt ice and see it, she
said.
Now, she said, scientists have melted
the ice clown into water, seeing the liquid
for the first time.
Scientists have long expected to find

this super-hot "primordial soup." But
their accelerators lor the experiments
they affectionately called the "Little
Bang" had been too weak to create the
right conditions.
The experiment is still in a primitive
form, tht* scientists said, noting that they
were able to separate out quarks and glu
ons, but not cleanly.
Professor Luciano Maiani, GERN's
director-general, said better results will be
possible after work shifts next year to the
new Relativistic Heavy lon Collider, or
RHIC, at Brookhaven National Laborato
ry on New York's Long Island.
