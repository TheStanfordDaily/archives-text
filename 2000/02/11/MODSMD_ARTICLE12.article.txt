# Economic growth will remain stable

WASHINGTON (AP) — The
current economic expansion,
already the longest in the nation's
history, should keep going this year
and beyond even though a recent
surge in productivity may not last,
the Clinton administration
announced yesterday.
The administration used this
year's 432-page "Economic Report
of'the President" to take part of the
credit for the good times, with
unemployment and inflation both
at.3o-year lows and consumer con
fidence at record highs.
• While praising the Federal
Reserve for pursuing an astute
monetary policy, the economic
report said the administration
deserved credit for making the
tough choices to eliminate the soar
ing government deficits it had
inherited.
•By turning huge deficits into
record surpluses, the administra

rates 30 percent to 50 percent lower
tliiin they had been during the
1980s and the low borrowing costs
have fueled an investment boom by
businesses, the report said.
/'Today, the American economy
is stronger than ever," President
Clinton said in the report, which
the $1.84 trillion budget he
released on Monday was heavy on
themes the Democrats hope to use
in the fall elections.
' "More than 20 million new jobs
hjive been created since Vice Presi
dent Gore and I took office in Jan
uary 1993," Clinton said in one of
tlse report's numerous references to
Gore, who is running to succeed
him.
i * Republicans argue that the
administration only reluctantly
agreed to balance the budget under
pressure from the GOP-controlled
Congress.

Republicans also give credit for
the economy's good times to
Ronald Reagan, who first appoint
ed Alan Greenspan to the Federal
Reserve in 1987, and for Reagan's
championing of large tax cuts in the
1980s which they claim laid the
groundwork for the current boom.
The economic report, prepared
by the president's three-member
Council of Economic Advisers, con
tained details of the administra
tion's updated economic forecast,
which formed the basis for budget
projections forecasting $74(i billion
in non-Social Security surpluses
over the next decade.
The annual report forecast that
after three straight years with eco
nomic growth averaging over 4
percent, the economy will slow in
2000 to 2.9 percent, when mea
sured from the fourth quarter of
each year, and slow to around 2.5
percent in the following three years.
Such a sloutrtmvfr would see the
W5.2 per
cent from the current 4 percent.
Part of recent economic strength
has come from a remarkable jump
in productivity growth, the amount
of output per hour of work.
The government reported
Tuesday that productivity iu 1999
increased by 2.9 percent, the
strongest increase in seven years.
Over the past four years, pro
ductivity has risen at an annual
average of 2.6 percent, far higher
than the 1.4 percent annual aver
age increase from 1973 to 1995.
Productivity went into a two
decade slump following the first
Arab oil embargo in 1973.
The upturn has left some ana
lysts believing that huge business
investments in computers are final
ly beginning to pay off, which is
leading the U.S. into a new eco
nomic upturn.
