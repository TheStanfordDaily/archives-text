B FT FAST, Northern Ireland
(AIM — Facing the imminent
prospect that Britain will strip the
powers from Northern Ireland's
Protestant-(Catholic government,
diplomats worked behind the
scenes yesterday lor an Irish
Republican Army commitment to
disarm.
In Dublin, the Protestant lead
er of the province s power-shar
ing Cabinet insisted politicians
shouldn't lose hope, even though
their coalition could be suspend
ed by the weekend because of the
outlawed IRA's unwillingness to
begin scrapping its weapons.
"I have to emphasize that they
are just problems. And people
would be wrong to regard this as
a terminal crisis," David Trimble
said alter meeting Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern. Trimble
heads the Ulster Unionists, the
province's major Protestant party.
Northern Ireland's new tour
party Cabinet was formed two
months ago, giving the province a
measure of local control after 27
years of direct rule In Britain.
I he government came togeth
er after Trimble and the Ulster
I tiionists agreed to sit down with
the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party in
advance of any disarmament.
As part ol an American-bro
kered deal, the IRA was supposed
to start disarming in response.
Fbe IRA has many tons of
weaponry, most of it hidden in
underground bunkers in the
neighboring Irish Republic.
But an independent disarma
ment commission reported |an.
31 that the IRA had offered noth
ing concrete in two months of
sec ret discussions.
In response, the British gov
ernment pledged to take back the
Belfast Cabinet's powers.
Ihe authority needed to

resume direct control of North
ern Ireland became law yesterday
night, when Queen Elizabeth II
gave bet assent to a bill that both
houses of Parliament passed this
week by overwhelming majorities.
Temporarily stripping respon
sibilities from the new govern
ment is Britain's best bet for keep
ing it going on life support.
If Britain did not take action,
the Ulster Unionists could with
draw from the Cabinet, collapsing
it. Fbe party has a conference
planned for tomorrow.
Despite the turmoil, Trimble
sought to sound an optimistic
note after hour-long talks with
Ireland's Ahern.
"The basic reality is that we
jumped, others didn't jump, and
consequently we've got prob
lems," Trimble said.
But, he said, "no matter what
difficulties we might have, no
matter what might flow from my
own council meeting on Saturday,
nobody should regard that as
being the ending of this process."
I he IRA's failure to disarm has
futhur jeopardized Trimble's
ahead) shaky hold on the Ulster
Unionists.
Despite considerable hostility,
he persuaded his party to accept
the compromise and form the
Cabinet in hopes the IRA would
respond.
As talks continued yesterday,
Sinn Fein leaders angrih accused
the British and Ulster Unionists
of unfairly blaming the current
crisis on the IRA.
Sinn Fein member Conor
Murphy said the province's 1998
Cood Friday peace accord didn't
require the IRA to begin disarm
ing bv a particular date — but it
did require Britain to publish a
document outlining army base
closures and troop withdrawals.
