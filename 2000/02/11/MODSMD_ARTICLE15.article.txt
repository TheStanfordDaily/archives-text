# New airline inspections occur in wake of Alaska Airlines crash
## 
### 
,'L()S ANGELES (AP) — The government is
requiring airlines to inspect the tails of MI)-80 series
jetliners and related planes — about one-fifth of the
nation's airline fleet — for damage similar to what
was discovered in the wreckage of Alaska Flight 261.
About 1,100 jets in the United States — all MD
80s, M l)-90s, I)G-9s and Boeing 717s — will be cov
ered by an order that was being drafted late yester
day by the Federal Aviation Administration. The air
lines will have three clays to comply.
Boeing had recommended the inspections on
Wednesday, and all major U.S. airlines already
began an inspection process when the FAA decided
to make it mandatory. Alaska Airlines grounded two
planes yesterday after problems were found.
Passengers should expect minor delays, the FAA
said.
"It's far more important that we get these air
planes inspected," said Tom McSweeny, the FAA's
associate administrator for certification. "We want it
done right, and we want it done thorough."

Alaska, which has 34 MD-80 series planes in its
lleet, grounded two of the jetliners in Seattle and
Portland, Ore., because metal shavings were lound
around the jackscrews — which drive the planes'
horizontal stabilizers and control the up-and-down
direction of a plane.
Shavings indicate wear on a nut that travels along
the screw.
The horizontal stabilizer, the jackscrcw, nut, ele
vators and other components that adjust the plane s
up-and-down pitch have been the locus of the Flight
201 investigation. The pilots reported trouble with
the stabilizer and struggled to control the plane lor
at least 30 minutes before it crashed into the Pacific
on Jan. 31, killing all 88 people aboard.
A 2-foot section ol the jackscrcw was recovered
from the wreckage, and metal shavings found on it
were determined to have come from the nut in the
mechanism.
It is unclear whether the damage was a possible
cause or an effect of the crash.
