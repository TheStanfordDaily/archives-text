## The
						Stanford Daily University should choose humanities president 
### 
Published Since 1891

Recent announcements
from Yale, Harvard and Prince
ton Universities concerning plans
Lo upgrade their science and engi
neering facilities could shed new light on
Stanford's presidential search.
Of the University's two top administra
tive positions, John Hennessy of the
Department of Engineering currently
holds the provost post, while the other, the
University's presidency, will soon be left
vacant by President Casper's departure.
I his gives Stanford, which seems to have
developed a tilt towards the sciences, an
opportunity to regain its academic balance
by appointing a humanities or social sci
ence scholar to the University's presidency.
Oiven Stanford's reputation as a science
and engineering school, filling the presi
dency with another science scholar would
only exacerbate the potential imbalance,

quite possibly serving to demonstrate, at
least for humanities students, the Universi
ty's conscious movement away from devel
oping its humanities and social science
components.
With three of the nation's top universities,
all known for their strength in the humani
ties and scxial sciences, choosing to commit
considerable resources to "[creating] the
proper balance of the modern university
between traditional liberal arts and engi
neering," as Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Malcolm Beaseley phrased it, it seems
only fitting that Stanford should follow suit.
In recent years, many Stanford students
have complained of an alarming growth in
the divide between techie and flizzie stu
dents. Even within the scope of interdisci
plinary majors, there is little academic
overlap between techie and fuzzie disci
plines, leaving humanities students to won-

der if their peers on the other side of the
divide are having as much trouble as they
are finding the infrastructure they need.
As Stanford continues to expand in the
sciences — and humanities students contin
ue to feel ignored and under-appreciated
— this problem only promises to worsen.
Admittedly, it is no easy task to quantify
what any university gives to its humanities
and social science components. According
to Beaseley and History Prof. Barton Bern
stein, supporting the humanities at Stan
ford is much less expensive than doing the
same for the sciences, which often require
a great deal of research space and the hir
ing of high-priced faculty. Thus, the
amount of funding put into the sciences
will and should generally be higher than
the amount put into the humanities, which
only makes developing outstanding
humanities programs even more attractive.

No one would argue against the
unprecedented value of the science educa
tion that Stanford provides its techie stu
dents. But this value in no way precludes
the University's obligation to place equal
emphasis — in the form of administrative
support and adequate funding, among oth
ers — on educating its humanities students.
The University must take action to rein
force its commitment to the humanities
and social sciences, especially from the per
spective of its students in those fields. This
year, Stanford has the opportunity to
accomplish this objective by appointing a
new president with expertise in the
humanities or social sciences. Like Yale,
Harvard and Princeton, Stanford must
begin to recognize the need for academic
balance, which, starting with the presiden
cy, translates into giving equal support to
students in all fields.
