# THE

All Stanford students are insecure. It's
the truth. Stanford takes the minute
imperfections we see in ourselves and
amplifies them into these glaring prob
lems with our lives as we constantly com
pare out selves to the elite of the elite that
liave become the Stanford standard.
Why am I saying this? Well, I think we
all need to start talking about our insecu
rities. You know, get more comfortable
with each other, make some new friends,
and more importantly, do it all without
the painful knives of "Crossing The Line"
gossip stabbing us in the back.
I hat being said, I have a confession to
make. I am 21 years old, and 1 am not
very tall. I here, that wasn't so hard. 1 am
smart, caring and special, and my great
personality plateaus at a little less than five
and a half feet. At the age of 11,1 was the
only kid in my ( lass too short to drive the
cars at the Malibu Grand Prix. {Insert
self-pity viola music here}.
At I I, my mom once missed seeing me
swim because she saw all these tall boys
and didn't think her shrimp of a son
would swim against boys that big. I spent
my c hildhood measuring myself against
mv Kareem Abdul jahhar poster and then
leaving lor college never having grown
past his waistline.

who hates being vertically challenged.

Stanford is an abnormally tall place. The
story of the people who lack height at
Stanford is a story of perseverance despite
overwhelming odds. It will make yon
laugh, make you cry and give -you insight
into the challenges of a group of people
that many literally "overlook" everyday.
So here it is, a clay in the life of a short per
son at Stanford.
8:50 a.m.: The average, below average
height Stanford student wakes up for
class. Our hero (I'm picturing myself in
this role for now, but for the record, girls
can be short too) jumps into the shower.
With the water falling from way over his
head with the gentle pressure of an early
morning massage, he remembers happily
that most guys his age probably don't
remember what it's like to have a shower
tall enough for them. It is a small victory,
but an important one.
8:56 a.m.: Off to class, engineering
class, where our young, motivated hero
takes a bold step and sits in the second to
last row in order to get a better view of his
6'3" tall professor. Lecture begins. A foot
ball player enters. He is big. He is NOT
lroy Walters. He sits in front of Our hero.
Our hero frowns. He can't see. He needs
to ask a question so he raises his hand.
The professor keeps lecturing. He begins
