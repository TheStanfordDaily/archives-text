# THE 						FLIP-SIDE
## A 						short man's world 
### 
All Stanford students are insecure. It's
the truth. Stanford takes the minute
imperfections we see in ourselves and
amplifies them into these glaring prob
lems with our lives as we constantly com
pare out selves to the elite of the elite that
liave become the Stanford standard.
Why am I saying this? Well, I think we
all need to start talking about our insecu
rities. You know, get more comfortable
with each other, make some new friends,
and more importantly, do it all without
the painful knives of "Crossing The Line"
gossip stabbing us in the back.
I hat being said, I have a confession to
make. I am 21 years old, and 1 am not
very tall. I here, that wasn't so hard. 1 am
smart, caring and special, and my great
personality plateaus at a little less than five
and a half feet. At the age of 11,1 was the
only kid in my ( lass too short to drive the
cars at the Malibu Grand Prix. {Insert
self-pity viola music here}.
At I I, my mom once missed seeing me
swim because she saw all these tall boys
and didn't think her shrimp of a son
would swim against boys that big. I spent
my c hildhood measuring myself against
mv Kareem Abdul jahhar poster and then
leaving lor college never having grown
past his waistline.
Now, I am not the only one at Stanford
who hates being vertically challenged.

Stanford is an abnormally tall place. The
story of the people who lack height at
Stanford is a story of perseverance despite
overwhelming odds. It will make yon
laugh, make you cry and give -you insight
into the challenges of a group of people
that many literally "overlook" everyday.
So here it is, a clay in the life of a short per
son at Stanford.
8:50 a.m.: The average, below average
height Stanford student wakes up for
class. Our hero (I'm picturing myself in
this role for now, but for the record, girls
can be short too) jumps into the shower.
With the water falling from way over his
head with the gentle pressure of an early
morning massage, he remembers happily
that most guys his age probably don't
remember what it's like to have a shower
tall enough for them. It is a small victory,
but an important one.
8:56 a.m.: Off to class, engineering
class, where our young, motivated hero
takes a bold step and sits in the second to
last row in order to get a better view of his
6'3" tall professor. Lecture begins. A foot
ball player enters. He is big. He is NOT
lroy Walters. He sits in front of Our hero.
Our hero frowns. He can't see. He needs
to ask a question so he raises his hand.
The professor keeps lecturing. He begins
shaking his arm wildly. 1 he professor
keeps lecturing. He stands up only to real
_ >ze he is still only barely taller than the
seated football player. The professor looks
up. An awkward moment passes. Our
hero realizes he is now that weird guy who
r -has stood up in lecture. 1 le makes his way
i out as if going to the restroom, slapping
| himself mentally.
9:52 a.m.: Off to the post office, the
; new post office. The day can only get bet

ter. Maybe he'll get a credit card bill, or a
University bill, or maybe a personal letter
. . . but probably not. He gets to his new
P.O. Box. It's on the top row. Why is it
always on the top row?!? He reaches up
while on his tip toes to open the box.
There's something inside. 1 le can see the
reflection. Excitement. He reaches for it.
He can't reach it. He is getting shorter.
No, wait, he's sinking into the mud.
Whose brilliant idea was it to put dirt
around the P.O. boxes? He reaches a lit
tle bit further. He almost has it. There.
Link Magazine. Our hero walks away
from the post office dejected and dis
mayed.

11:00 a.m.: Coffee House. He enters.
It's not what it used to be. It has nothing
to do with his height, but he walks away
dejected.
12:00 p.m.: He goes to lunch at his
dorm where he is a resident assistant
and where the average height of guys on
his hallway is six feet. His own residents
pat him on the head and ask him if he is
lost before realizing he is their RA and
not an eight-year old kid. They apolo
gize and continue patting his head
because he is at perfect patting height.
He walks away from lunch dejected and
hungry.
3:00 p.m.: Checks his e-mail. Gets an e

mail from his sister. She begins the e-mail
with "Hey short stuff]" Feels hate for the
world rising. Closes computer dejectedly
and takes a nap.
8:00 p.m.: Goes back to the CoHo. Its
depressing new look fits his depressed
mood. Sits and fakes studying, just like
everybody else. Someone approaches his
table. He looks up. A spark returns to
our hero's eyes as well as a touch of red
to his cheeks. Before him stands the girl
he's been after all year. They start talk
ing. He talks about feeling lonely. She
talks about how she could never date a
guy over 5 foot 6 inches. Our hero feels
revived and refreshed (of course, they're

just friends. They go to Stanford after all.
What were you expecting, a miracle?)
1:00 a.m.: Our hero goes to bed ready
to face a new day. He smiles knowingly as
he drifts off to sleep, realizing he is one of
a few guys on campus who can fit on the
bed while lying completely straight. He
falls asleep dreaming "big"
dreams. . . well .. . dreams that will at
least seem bigger to him than to most
other people. The End.
