Continuing debate on abortion
I'll is letter is in regards to Brandon
Stuhan's letter (Feb. H) about abortion.
There are lots of points of contention
on this issue, but I only have one I want to
deal with now:
Abortion does not kill babies. It is not
infanticide. We do not kill unborn chil
dren. Similarly, the casualties of abortion
cannot be referred to as neonates, small
fries, rugrats, kids or toddlers. These
words do not describe the UNBORN, but
rather the BORN. Using these terms is an
underhanded way of negatively portray
ing a woman's tight to choose.
"Unborn child" is an oxymoron. It could
he a fetus. It could be an embryo. It could
even be just a fertilized group of cells. To
mix up these terms is to completely ignore
the distinction between prenatal and post
natal. A very important distinction!
It would he as accurate to describe
myself as a fetus in the 82nd trimester as it
would be to call a fetus in the 2nd
trimester a child. So let's he honest in our
terminology. If your argument is strong
enough, you can use the correct word:

FETUS. Abortion kills a FETUS.

Many of the pro-lifers on campus seem
convinced that by simply prohibiting abor
tion, it will stop happening. But when has
this actually worked?
Drunk driving is highly illegal, yet
deaths occur every day from its conse
quences. Drinking is technically illegal for
at least 60% of the undergraduates on
campus, yet almost everyone has tasted
alcohol well before their twenty-first birth
day. Making the misguided assumption
that a law will magically eliminate the need
for the "perverse and evil" procedure of
abortion reflects ignorance about the
underlying societal trends that continue to
make it a necessary, albeit difficult choice
in some circumstances.
No one, pro-life or pro-choice, will dis
pute the fact that high abortion rates are a
problem. Women at pro-choice rallies do
not high-five each other when the abor
tion rates go up or brag about how many
times they have "done it." Pro-choice

women do not celebrate the tact that one
in ten women now have an abortion
before age 30. This is a serious crisis for all
women involved, pro-life and pro-choice.
The difference among our "camps" is not
our recognition of the problem, but how
we choose to go about solving it.
Most pro-life activists (as if abortion
activists are "pro-death"), seem to feel that
imposing an arbitrary, impractical and
rigid ban on a practice that has persisted
since the earliest societies is a cure-all for
the problem of high abortion rates. But
this is a misguided approach. Abortion is
not a stand-alone problem, but the indica
tion of the serious social consequences of
low rates of contraceptive use, rape and
casual sexual encounters.
If the pro-lifers really want to do some
thing about the high rates of abortion,
they should address these underlying
causes. Pass out free condoms and encour
age family planning instead of parading
around with gross posters of aborted
fetuses and warnings about the evils of
sexual activity. Appeal to people's rational
side instead of preaching overreaching
moral arguments.

The reality is, people will always have
sex. And as long as people continue hav
ing sex without contraceptives, or until
someone finds a contraceptive method
that is 100 percent foolproof, abortion will
continue to occur regardless of its legal
status. The question is, then, whether
women will be able to have safe, sterile and
regulated abortions or be subjected to a
back alley clinic and place themselves in
danger of infection, sterility and death.
If the pro-lifers truly want to limit abor
tion, they need to redirect their strategy.
Stop focusing on the legality of the issue,
and address the real underlying problem
of unwanted pregnancy.
