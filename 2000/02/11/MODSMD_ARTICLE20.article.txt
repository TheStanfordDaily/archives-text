# ASSU Senate responds
## 
### 
Although I am in agreement with con
tributing writer Ben Alexander Bloch's
Feb. 10 article titled "Senate, GSC happy
after split," I am curious as to how he
came to that conclusion without having
spoken to a single senator.

This is not the first time a Daily writer
has confused the senate with the executive*
arm of the ASSU. I would hope that in!
future The Daily will take greater care in'
this regard.
