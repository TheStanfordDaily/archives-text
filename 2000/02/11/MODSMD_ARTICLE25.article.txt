### MAUREEN MULLEN

Pac-10 matchup against Oregon
(16-0, 7-3) last night. The loss
moves (he Cardinal to a third place
tie in the conference with Oregon,
behind Arizona (H-2) and UCLA
(7-2).
Angelina Wolvert put the Ducks
ahead for good, making a layup
with 13 seconds remaining to cre
ate a two-point lead. Stanford se
nior guard Milena Flores proceed
ed to throw jthe ball out of bounds
as Stanford went for the tie.
Stanford then fouled Wolvert
with under live seconds to go, but
apparently thinking tluit the Ducks
were in the double-bonus, no Stan
lord players went for the rebound.
When Stanford finally regained
possession, their lone shot attempt
fell far short.
Fouled with eight tenths of a
second to go, Oregon's Shaquala
Williams made two free throws to
cement the lead for the Ducks.
Sophomore Lauren St. Clair
and Junior Carolyn Moos led the
Cardinal in scoring with 12 points
apiece. The Cardinal, which leads
the nation in three-point shooting,
went only 2-1 1 from behind the

Wideman to third on the all-time
Stanford assists list.

start since a concussion on January
13, led Oregon with 10 points.
Wolvert had 12 points and Jenny
Mowe had 11 for the Ducks. Mowe
also led the team in rebounds with
eight.
After the narrow loss, the Stan
ford women look to their next

gon State senior Sissel Pierce
fouled out with 7:13 to go in the
game.
Pierce is a projected threat to
Stanford on Saturday, currently
leading the Pac-10 in blocked
shots and averaging 11.9 points
and 7.0 rebounds per game. An
other player to watch is Felicia
Ragland who is leading the
Beavers in scoring.
"I think we will be excited to
play Stanford," said Oregon State
coach Judy Spoelstra. "We felt we
played good basketball at times at
their place. Certainly our athletes

feel some confidence about be able
to do some things against Stanford.
They have some outstanding out
side shooters that we must keep
track of at all times."
Rebounding will be a determin
ing factor in the contest. Oregon
State is a tough rebounding team
and has lead the Pac-10 in boards
nearly all season.
