# Men's hoops shoots down Ducks
## Another impressive outing keeps the men tied at top of Pac-10 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
Stanford didn't always make it
look pretty last night at Maples
Pavilion. But for the eiglith
straight time, the No. 2 Cardinal
took care of business.
Charging out to as much as a
19-point lead, Stanford never
trailed, riding senior Mark Mad
sen and junior Ryan Mendez to a
76-61 victory over No. 24 Ore
gon. Madsen put together the
21st double-double of his career,
scoring 19 points with 10 re
bounds. Mendez added an im
portant 14 points, shooting 5-for
-7 and 3-fbr-3 on three-pointers.
The win was an important one
for Stanford (20-1, 9-1 Pacific 10)
as it kept the Cardinal tied with
Arizona (20-4, 9-1) for first in the
conference and dropped Oregon
(10-5, 7-3) two games behind. If
the Ducks had won, they would
have been tied with Stanford for
second.
'They were a win away from
feeling like they were really in the
hunt," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "For us, it
provides a little space. And Ari
zona's not letting up, so we just
needed to keep pace."
Stanford ensured a school
record sixth-straight 20-win sea

son by, as always, employing its
stifling man-to-man defense. The
Cardinal held Oregon, the best
shooting team in the conference,
to only 36 percent from the field.
"They're so great as a team,"
he said. "You have to come up to
their level and if you don't, they
make you pay. But we're not
going to play the Stanfbrds of the
world every night. Thank God."
Stanford looked like it would run
away with the game going into
halftime. But acoupleofinterest

ing calls and some well-timed Ore
gon shots kept the lead to 11 points
going into the locker room.
The halftime lead would have
been less, but sophomore Tony
Giovacchini hit a three-pointer at
the halftime buzzer to end the first
period on a high note. Giovacchi
ni, who has been consistently play
ing about 10 minutes a game,
looked uncharacteristically ag
gressive on the offensive end, fin
ishing with seven points.
"Tony did a real good job com
ing in, running the club and get
ting everyone together," Mont
gomery said.
In the second half, Oregon
came out strong, cutting the lead
to six with a breakaway dunk by
Alex Scales. But as recent routine
would have it, Mendez came right
back to give Stanford a boost, hit
ting a three-pointer from the left
baseline. The shot pushed the lead
back to nine and got the crowd
back into the game.
"We have a number of people
capable of killing a rally," said
Montgomery. "The last couple of
games, it's been Ryan Mendez
jumping up and hitting big shots.
That's given us a nice cushion."
From that point on, Stanford
never led by less than nine as the
Cardinal continued to push back
short spurts from Oregon.
"[Oregon] never quits,"
Mendez said. "When it looked like
we would pull away, they'd get
right back in there. But we've been
there before. We've been in tight
games."
That experience was evident in
Madsen and especially in Mendez,
a fourth-year junior who plays
with a great sense of quiet confi
dence.
As always, the Mad Dog was a
solid presence on the court, bark
ing for the ball and yelling instruc
tions at teammates while banging
the boards with abandon.
"He came to me and said 'I
need to get more reps down low,"'
Montgomery said of Madsen. "We
got him the ball down low tonight
and he just plays so hard he found
a way. I
"The way they were playing de-i
tense, doubling down on the post,
gave him the opportunity to get to
the boards on offense."
Oregon's main threat from the
field was Scales, an athletic senior
who found ways to get open all
night. Stanford's Casey Jacobsen,
who finished with 19 points, and
David Moseley both found foul
trouble attempting to guard him.
Other than Madsen, Stanford
also found trouble trying to score
down low. Jarron Collins, who
scored 19 against Oregon in Eu
gene, was held to two points on 1-
of-9 shooting and his brother
Jason only added five. The ab
sence of Curtis Borchardt didn't
help anything.
The freshman had been seeing
considerable action as Stanford's
fourth big man but sat out the
game with what he called a "stress
reaction" to the top of his right
foot.
Borchardt, who wears orthotics
to help his feet support his 6-foot
-11 -inch frame, had worn new
shoes the past few games and left
the supports out because they
didn't fit. Borchardt said he will
not play Saturday but hopes to be
back to face California next Satur
day. And this time, he promised
he'd ask for bigger shoes.
