# Men's hoops shoots down Ducks
## Another impressive outing keeps the men tied at top of Pac-10 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
Stanford didn't always make it
look pretty last night at Maples
Pavilion. But for the eiglith
straight time, the No. 2 Cardinal
took care of business.
Charging out to as much as a
19-point lead, Stanford never
trailed, riding senior Mark Mad
sen and junior Ryan Mendez to a
76-61 victory over No. 24 Ore
gon. Madsen put together the
21st double-double of his career,
scoring 19 points with 10 re
bounds. Mendez added an im
portant 14 points, shooting 5-for
-7 and 3-fbr-3 on three-pointers.
The win was an important one
for Stanford (20-1, 9-1 Pacific 10)
as it kept the Cardinal tied with
Arizona (20-4, 9-1) for first in the
conference and dropped Oregon
(10-5, 7-3) two games behind. If
the Ducks had won, they would
have been tied with Stanford for
second.
'They were a win away from
feeling like they were really in the
hunt," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "For us, it
provides a little space. And Ari
zona's not letting up, so we just
needed to keep pace."
Stanford ensured a school
record sixth-straight 20-win sea

son by, as always, employing its
stifling man-to-man defense. The
Cardinal held Oregon, the best
shooting team in the conference,
to only 36 percent from the field.
"They're so great as a team,"
he said. "You have to come up to
their level and if you don't, they
make you pay. But we're not
going to play the Stanfbrds of the
world every night. Thank God."
Stanford looked like it would run
away with the game going into
halftime. But acoupleofinterest
