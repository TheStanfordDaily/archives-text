# Mendez shows new life off Cardinal bench
## In a pinch, Mendez provides clutch shots that are breaking the backs of Stanford opponents 
### JIM TANKERSLEY EDITORIAL STAFF 
When their opponents go on runs and
cut into big leads, most coaches call time
out. Not Stanford's Mike Montgomery.
Then again, most coaches don't have
Ryan Mendez.
Every time Oregon reeled off a string of

baskets to climb within double digits last
night, Mendez calmly stroked a three
pointer to stop the bleeding. He nailed all
three shots he took from behind the arc,
each bringing a sigh of relief to the fans in
Maples and a dagger to the Ducks.
Stanford went on to win 76-61 to stay tied
with Arizona atop the Pacific 10 Conference
standings.
The performance was nothing new for
Mendez or the Cardinal. The team lias held
off runs consistently all year — with a no
table exception in its Jan. 8 home loss to .Ari
zona — and Mendez came up with momen
tum-breaking threes several times last week

at UCLA and I SC.
" That's been a characteristic of the Stan
ford squad, Montgomen said. "Am time
people get a run, it hasn't been a long run,
and we've had an answer to it.
Mendez, who finished with I I points, hit
his first three-pointer on a fast break that
changed the tone of the first half. I lis sec
ond stopped a 0-0 Oregon run in the sec
ond hall thai had whittled the (lardinal lead
to six.
After a three-point play inside and a slick
assist on a tip-pass to jason Collins, the ju
nior forward dropped his final behind-the-
arc bomb on Oregon. The shot
pushed Stanford's lead to 19, its
highest of the day, and put the
game out of reach with eight min
utes to go.
"1 think Ryan's the guy," Stan
ford senior forward Mark Mad
sen said, "that, when games have
been close, hasn't been afraid to
take the big shot for us."
A starter when the season
began, Mendez lost his spot in the
lineup to freshman Casey Jacob
sen after missing practice to at
tend his grandmother's funeral
in Texas last month.
But the bench hasn't ham
pered his confidence or cut back
his minutes substantially (he
played 25 last night), and Mont
gomery said watching the open
ing plays from the sidelines helps
Mendez make better decisions
when he gets on the court.
If anything, his production on
the bench has increased, as evi
denced by his game last night and
career-high 24 points last Satur
day at USC.
"Ryan is a smart player,"
Montgomery said, "and he's
clearly back where he was at any
point in his career prior."
Most importantly, Mendez
and his Cardinal teammates have
a knack for not wilting under
pressure, a fact that impressed
Oregon head coach Ernie Kent.
"As soon as we broke down,
they were able to take advan
tage," he said.
"Those three-pointers came
with us breaking down on the
floor. They tend to make you pay

for that."
That's the characteristic of a
mature team, Mendez said.

"We've all been there before,"
lit- said. " Teams have made runs
at us before."
