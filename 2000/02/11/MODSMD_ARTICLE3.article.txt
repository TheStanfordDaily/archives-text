# NCAA alters 'core' rules
## 
### DAVID ABRIL 
Mounting complaints from
high schools regarding initial eligi
bility requirements have encour
aged the NCAA to ease some of its
clearance standards for college
bound athletes, although the new
requirements are not likely to af
fect Stanford.
In early January, the NCAA
simplified criteria for what counts
as a core course, giving high
schools more control over what
courses student-athletes must take
in order compete at the collegiate
level.
According to Susan Bulk, assis
tant athletic director for student
services, the revisions in initial-eli
gibility standards should have lit
tle effect on Stanford-bound ath
letes, given the University's own
rigorous admission requirements.
"The only time requirements
are a problem is when students
take classes that surpass core class
requirements," Bulk said.
But Burk added that the revi
sions should decrease the poten
tial for administrative error.
"It's just a matter of jumping
through hoops; no one really has
initial-eligibility problems," said
Administrative Associate of Athlet
ics Karen Peters.
The NCAA Clearinghouse es
tablishes the standards and certi
fies athletes to play at the Division
I or II levels. To be certified, stu
dent-athletes must maintain a
minimum grade point average in
13 core classes. Since 1996, the
clearinghouse defined the acade
mic content that core classes had
to offer and required schools to
submit descriptions of classes for
NCAA review.
For a class to count as "core," 75
percent of its instructional content
had to be in a required area such
as English, math, physical science
or social science. The so-called "75
percent rule" made it difficult for
student-athletes to meet the stan
dards if they took an interdiscipli
nary class that involved skills relat
ed to English or social studies,
such as public spewing or com
munity research.
The NCAA eliminated the 75
percent rule and now requires
that a core course meet the
schools' graduation requirement
in fundamental subject areas.
State education officials and

high sch<x>l administrators have
opposed NCAA oversight because
they believe that the State Boards
of Education and the schools
themselves have control over edu
cational criteria.
According to the NCAA, each
year less than one percent of col
lege-bound athletes were
clearinghouse under the old re
quirements. Out of those denied,"
some were turned down because
of administrative oversight. For
example, inconsistencies between
course lists sent in by students'
and school administrators-can re
sult in the rejection of a course as
core.
. In 1997, Jamie Ponsoldt, a foot
ball player and honors student at
Cedar Shoals High School in
Athens, Georgia, threatened the ,
NCAA with a lawsuit after he was
denied certification. The clearing
house had declared that four of
the 15 classes he submitted: ad
vanced English, advanced Eco
nomics, trigonometry and gov
ernment, did not qualify as core
courses. Ponsoldt was eventually
granted certification, but onty
after he threatened the
with a lawsuit.
Few Stanford applicants have
experienced such difficulties with
the NCAA.
"At PAC-10 meetings, the issufc
of initial-eligibility requirements
comes up, and they ask us if we
want to take a break," said Burke.
