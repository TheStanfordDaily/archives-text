# NCAA alters 'core' rules

Mounting complaints from
high schools regarding initial eligi
bility requirements have encour
aged the NCAA to ease some of its
clearance standards for college
bound athletes, although the new
requirements are not likely to af
fect Stanford.
In early January, the NCAA
simplified criteria for what counts
as a core course, giving high
schools more control over what
courses student-athletes must take
in order compete at the collegiate
level.
According to Susan Bulk, assis
tant athletic director for student
services, the revisions in initial-eli
gibility standards should have lit
tle effect on Stanford-bound ath
letes, given the University's own
rigorous admission requirements.
"The only time requirements
are a problem is when students
take classes that surpass core class
requirements," Bulk said.
But Burk added that the revi
sions should decrease the poten
tial for administrative error.
