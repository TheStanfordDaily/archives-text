# No. 1 Baseball seeks revenge at FSU
## Series with Seminoles will be a whole other ball game according to Marquess 
### BRETT KAUFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Cardinal baseball fans will have one
thing on their minds this weekend when
No. 1 Stanford (5-1) travels to Tallahas
see, Ha., to battle No. 4 Florida State (5-
1): revenge. The Seminoles ousted the
Cardinal from last year's College World
Series by winning a classic ball game in 13
innings.
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess,
however, dismisses the importance of last
year's result as a motivating force, em
phasizing that the 2000 campaign is a
brand new season.
"It's a different setting . .. and it's
early in the year," he said. "1 don't think
the revenge factor will come into play."
Stanford's players acknowledge yet
downplay the role of vindication this
weekend. While they are fully aware that
staying focused and playing solid base
ball will be the most crucial aspects of the
series, none can deny that seeing the
Seminole uniforms will bring back mem
ories of last season's defeat.
"Everybody's been thinking about it a
little bit," said first baseman Craig
Thompson, a senior. "But no one's real
ly said much or has made a big deal out
of it."
Junior Jason Young, the team's No. 1

starter, agrees with Thompson.
"We're looking for a little bit of re
venge, bin it is so early in the season that
we can't really think about that too
much," he said.
The Cardinal pitching stall will be
challenged in Tallahassee, fin ing a line
up that has tallied 51 runs in only six
games this year.
Stanford has allowed just 13 earned
runs all season but has not seen a hittei as
dangerous as senior All-American Mar
shall McDougall. who homered twice in
Florida State's extra-inning win over the
Cardinal last year. McDougall's 28 home
runs in 1999 led a team that often forces
high-scoring contests and uses its offen
sive strength to come from behind in
many situations.
A young corps of Stanford relievers
will have to adjust to the large crowds at
Florida State and keep the potent Semi
nole lineup in check late in the games.
Junior Joe Bon hard, a switch-hitter,
and senior Edmund Muth, a left bander,
will counter the Seminole attack at I >ic k
Howser Stadium, which features a
tempting 320-foot porch in right field.
The hottest bat for Stanford has l>e
longed to Thompson, whose .385 batting
average and six-game hitting streak .is
the leadolf man both lead the team.
Against a high-scoring Florida Stale
team, Thompson's ability to get on base
and set the plate for the middle of the
order will play a crucial role this week
end.
The Seminoles lost five starters from

last year's squad but return two accom
plished piti hers this season. |on Mc Don

year, will be junior Justin Wayne's
(2-0, 1.46) scheduled opponent for
tomorrow's matinee. Wayne has
been Stanford's most consistent
pitcher thus far, allowing less than
one hit per inning pitched.
Sophomore Brian Sager (1-0,
0.00) will attempt to keep the mo
mentum he created with a domi
nating performance last weekend
to battle Seminole junior Mike
Ziegler (1-0, 3.00) on Sunday.
Sager allowed just two hits against
Gal State-Fullerton in his first start
of the year, throwing his for strikes
and getting ahead of hitters all day
long.
The degree to which Cardinal
pitching handles the Seminoles'
power should determine die out
come of the long-anticipated re
match of two of the nation's best
teams.
