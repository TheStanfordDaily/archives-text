# Wealth of young talent leads No. 21 softball
## Phoenix tournament will provide experience for Cardinal freshmen 
### EMILY DRESSEL 
After picking up two solid wins
against San Francisco State two
weekends ago at home, the Stan
ford softball team will travel to
Phoenix today to compete in the Fi
esta Bowl Tournament.
The Fiesta Classic is one of the
nation's most prestigious season
tournaments, with top teams from
all over the nation meeting to test
their skills against eat h other.
Stanford, ranked No. 21 in the
National Fastpitch (loaches' Associ
ation preseason poll, will face an im
pressive No. 16 Massachusetts
team, which finished 43-10 last sea
son and pic ked up the Atlantic-10
Conference title. The Cardinal is
also slotted to play UNLV, (Jeorgia,
Wisconsin and a tough No. 1.3 Ne
braska team on Sunday.
Mead coach jolin Kittman said
the Fiesta Bowl is just one of the
many challenging tournaments on
the Stanford schedule this season.
The team will practically be living in
their uniforms as it is scheduled to
play in three more tournaments
over the next three weekends, in
< hiding the Campbell / Cartier
Classic in Poway, Calif., the Utah
Invitational and the NFCA Feadoll

Classic in Columbus, Ca.
Senior catcher and Second
Team All-American Kellie Wigin
ton believes intense competition
early in tin* season will be extreme
ly t>eneficial to the team. They will
lace traditional softball powerhous
es in conference such as Washing
ion and UCLA The team will also
face a strong team in Fresno State.
The Cardinal finished 10-18 in
the Pacific 10 Conference last year
and 40-25 overall. However, con
sidering the Pac-10 is historically
the toughest conference in the
country, the Cardinal has much to
Ik* proud of. This year, the Pac-10
includes three of the four top teams
in the NCFA ratings. All eight Pac
-10 teams this season rank in the top
29 nationwide.
This weekend should give a
good indication of how this year's
team will measure up to years past.
The roster is one of the youngest
ever, with seven freshmen and only
four seniors and juniors combined.
Three of the freshmen, Jaime
Forman-Lau, Maureen LeCoccj
and Dana Soiensen, made impres
sive pitching debuts against the
Cators. Another freshman, Tori
Nyberg, currently sidelined with a
ribcage stress fracture, will join
them in trying to lill the big void
graduating seniors Becky Blevins
and Marcy Crouch left on the
mound.
Wiginton is optimistic, and even
though it usually takes some time to

develop a pitcher / catcher rapport,
she is confident in her young squad.
"The freshmen are all unbeliev
ably talented. Their accomplish
ments, whether in high school or
through travel ball, speak for them
selves," Wiginton said. "They each
have a variety of pitches, and now I
think it's just a matter of getting
more collegiate experience."
Fhe pitchers worked hard all
summer to adjust to the extra three
feet between home plate and the
pitching rubber that comes with the
transition to college ball.
Kittman credits Wiginton with
much of the pitchers' growing con
fidence.
"Kellie needs time to work with
each individual pitcher a little more
to build that relationship.
" But she does a great job of c aim
ing the nerves of the freshmen,"
Kittman said.
" I lie communication is definite
ly there."
A five-game weekend starts
today for the young Stanford team.
Fhe squad will have a chance to
show of 1 its new freshmen and re
turning key players, such as Stan
ford's first ever NFCA First Team
All-American, sophomore center
fielder Jessica Mendoza, and junior
first baseman Sarah Beeson.
But most importantly, the tour
nament will be a prime opportuni
ty for the players to learn how to
play with each other.
Wiginton eagerly testifies to the

unity of the players already in the
season.
"Everyone gets along really well,
on and of! the field. 1 was kind of
wondering, before the start of the
season, what was going to happen,
having lost seven seniors and a
large core of the lineup. But the
youth on the team gives us enor
mous energy, and it's just conta
gious to everyone out there on the
field."

Building experience in the battery will be an important aspect of this week
end's five game stretch, according to head coach John Rittman. Catcher Kel
