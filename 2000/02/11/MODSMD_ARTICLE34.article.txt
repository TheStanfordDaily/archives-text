sition to do so with what is considered by many to he

Season Philosophy
I he college track season is broken into two set
lions: indoor and outdoor. Stanford's locus is almost

entirely on the outdoor season, and the team will use
the indoor season (the first month and a half) as a
stepping-stone for that portion.
Throughout the season, athletes will be working to
qualify based on times for the Pacific 10 Conference
