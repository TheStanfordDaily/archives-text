Overview and lluckgrmind
After tla- best season in team history in 1999, Stan
lord is looking to improve. I he men are in great po
sition to do so with what is considered by many to he
the best middle distance squad in the country, a dis
tance team that hopes to repeat a 1 -2-'l sweep ol the
l(),()()()-incter run in the NCAAs, a strong returning
squad of jumpers and throwers and a young (lass ol
sprinters.
"Our goal is to win the [NCAA] indoor and out
door titles," senior captain Toby Stevenson said.
" 11 lis is my last year, and alter coming in second last
season, I think this is the year. I have a lot of confi
dence in our team."

this year at the outdoor N( IAA championship meet in
|tine. I lead coat li Vin Lananna said he is very confi
dent in the ('.ardinal, but the competition remains an
unknown.
"We have a stronger team than we have had in the
past, but it is too early in the season to know how the
rest of the (ountry will shape out," Lananna said.
I "his yeai s < onipetition focuses not only on tradi
tional ri\.il Ai k.ins,is. Lananna expects several otlici
schools including Southern Methodist and Texas to
be contending lor the NCAA Championship along
with Stanford and Ai kansas.
Season Philosophy
I he college track season is broken into two set
lions: indoor and outdoor. Stanford's locus is almost

entirely on the outdoor season, and the team will use
the indoor season (the first month and a half) as a
stepping-stone for that portion.
Throughout the season, athletes will be working to
qualify based on times for the Pacific 10 Conference

Junior Leroy Sims surges at the line at last year's Stanford
Invitational. This weekend, Stanford travels to enemy ter
ritory in Fayetteville, Arkansas to compete in the Tyson In
vitational.
and NCAA Championships. The
goal of most meets leading up to
the championship races will be pri
marily to qualify runners rather
than to accrue team points.
Lananna will place runners in
events to allow athletes to attain
the individual marks necessary to
qualify rather than strategically
placing runners to maximize team
score.
Athletes to watch
This year's team is loaded with
talent. Returning almost all of last
year's second-place team (with the
exception of distance runner
Nathan Nutter and thrower Adam
Connolly), the Cardinal has only
added talent. Middle distance

standouts Gabe Jennings, Michael
Stember and Jonathon Riley were
all redshirted last track season and
will play a significant role in this
year's effort.
The middle distance and dis
tance squads will dominate this
season. A phenomenal class of
freshmen has joined the Farm and
stands to play a huge role in Stan
ford track for several years to
come. Andy Powell, one of the top
high school distance runners in
the last 20 years, has the potential
to score points for the Cardinal.
Louis Luchini and Adam 112 en
forde also stand to contribute to
the Cardinal in their first year.
Senior Brad Hauser, a member
of the USA World Championship
Team, hopes to continue his
amazing track career, and his
twin brother, Brent, also will be a
major competitor this season. Se
nior Jason Balkman and redshirt

junior Thomas Murley are in the
position Co have stellar seasons.
The sprints and hurdles will
also contribute throughout the
season. Michael Harte will lead the
Cardinal in the high hurdles.
Freshman Justin Williams will also
be explosive over the hurdles and
greatly strengthen the sprint team.
Also look for junior Leroy Sims to
play a big role for the sprinters.
I'he Cardinal is also returning
its top pole vaulter in school histo
ry with Toby Stevenson.
The throws will also exhibit tal
ent from both veterans and fresh
men. Mark Ganek will lead the
team in the discuss and hammer,
but will also be helped in these
events by freshman Nick Weli
hozkiy. The shot put will feature
sophomore Chris Sprague.
Key Meets
Several benchmark meets will

characterize the season, including
the NCAA Indoors on March 10-
11 and The Big Meet at Cal on
May 6, which will provide a g(xxl
segue into the Pac-10 and NCAA
Outdoor meets. This weekend's
meet at the University of Arkansas
will also be a key meet for the Car
dinal.
This weekend will be the first
meet of the year in which the Car
dinal faces Arkansas.
Stanford's goals will, however,
â€¢still be on individual perfor
mance. The competition at the
meet will be conducive to great
performances from Stanford ath
letes.
"Neither of us [Stanford or
Arkansas] are worried about
matching up against each other in
team score," Lananna said.
"Our goals are to qualify our
runners and spark interest in the
sport in the area."
