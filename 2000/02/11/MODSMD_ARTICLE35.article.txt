# Spikers search south for wins
## Men seek to end six-game drought in SoCal 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 13 Stanford men's
volleyball team (2-6, 2-4 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) is
desperately looking for a way to
stop the bleeding.
After starting the season 2-0,
things have gone from promising
to ugly to frustrating as the squad
has since suffered a six-game los
ing streak. The team is hoping to
turn things around this weekend
in San Diego as it takes on San
Diego State (1-5, 0-5) and UC-
San Diego (3-5, 0-5).
Lately, it seems nothing has
been going light for the Cardi
nal. And for a young team domi
nated by freshmen and prone to
injury, and stuck in a conference
that boasts seven of the top eight
teams in the nation, the Cardinal
can't afford mistakes.
This weekend will be a chance
for Stanford to begin its redemp
tion. The Cardinal breezed by
both the San Diego State Aztecs
and the UC-San Diego Tritons
earlier this season without drop
ping a game. After two disap
pointing losses to No. 14 Lewis
(Ind.) and Ball State last week
end, Stanford is hungry for wins
and will be satisfied with no less
than two in San Diego.
"It's true that we beat them a
month ago," head coach Ruben
Nieves said, "but 1 look at it like
we have to prove ourselves every

time we take the lloor. These
teams, like us, have gained a lot of
experience, and we're on their
turf now."

end, Stanford looks again to

legiate career.
Beyond the consistency of
Toppel and junior setter Josh
Lukens, Nieves is ready to make
some changes with the rest of the
lineup.
Injury has plagued the other
middle blockers, leaving the
squad with an indefinite starting
pair. Junior Brett Youngberg has
been bothered by a lingering
back problem that forced him to
sit out for most of the Ball State
match last weekend. Freshman
Paul Bocage sprained his ankle
this week and will most likely be
out for the weekend.
Redshirt freshman Jon Pala
cios, who has been playing in the
libero position most of this sea
son, has switched focus to middle
blocker, where he was very suc
cessful two weeks ago against
use.
Without Palacios as libero,
outside hitters Seth Ring, a red
shirt freshman, and Marcus Ska
cel, a sophomore, have been step
ping in.
"Ring and Skacel are both im

portant players and have ab
solutely done the job of serve-re
ceive — they've given us the
chance to win matches," Nieves
said.
"But we have not gotten
enough from them offensively so
we are looking at one of them
playing libero."
With the changes, fans can ex
pect more playing time for junior
outside hitter Curtis Graham,
whom Nieves looks to for hitting
help, and freshman outside hitter
Billy Strickland, tioted for his
blocking skills.
Freshman outside hitter Kyle
Strache also suffered an ankle in
jury this week and is probable for
this weekend.
Tonight Stanford will battle
San Diego State.
In their last three matches,
Stanford has given up only one
game to the Aztecs, including a 3-
0 victory in January. The Aztecs
have recorded one win this sea
son, a three-game victory over
UC-Santa Cruz.
Leading the Aztecs' offense is
senior outside hitter Mike Szy
manski with 107 kills and a 5.35
ki 1 ls-per-game average.
Szymanski posted 20 kills

against Stanford and with the
next highest hitter only securing
nine, Szymanski is a lorce that
Stanford will want to contain.
In their first meeting this sea
son, the Carding) outblocked the
Aztecs 11-6, outdug them 37-23
and held them to a .242 hitting
percentage. The squad is hoping
to dominate once again this
weekend.

match of Stanford's season open
er against UC-San Diego.
Stanford allowed the Tritons
only 16 points in that matchup
and held them to a .117 hitting
percentage, the lowest of all Stan
ford's opponents this season.
As the only Division 111 team
in the conference, San Diego has
yet to post a conference win, but
has secured wins over Santa Cruz
and the University of La Verne.
Junior outside hitter Donald
Chen leads the Tritons in kills
with 123 and his 5.59 kill average
is good enough for ninth in the
conference.
Fellow junior outside hitter
Zack Hite led in kills last year and
is right behind Chen this season
with 1 12, averaging 4.48 per
game.
