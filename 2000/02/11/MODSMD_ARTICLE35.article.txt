# Spikers search south for wins
## Men seek to end six-game drought in SoCal 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 13 Stanford men's
volleyball team (2-6, 2-4 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) is
desperately looking for a way to
stop the bleeding.
After starting the season 2-0,
things have gone from promising
to ugly to frustrating as the squad
has since suffered a six-game los
ing streak. The team is hoping to
turn things around this weekend
in San Diego as it takes on San
Diego State (1-5, 0-5) and UC-
San Diego (3-5, 0-5).
Lately, it seems nothing has
been going light for the Cardi
nal. And for a young team domi
nated by freshmen and prone to
injury, and stuck in a conference
that boasts seven of the top eight
teams in the nation, the Cardinal
can't afford mistakes.
This weekend will be a chance
for Stanford to begin its redemp
tion. The Cardinal breezed by
both the San Diego State Aztecs
and the UC-San Diego Tritons
earlier this season without drop
ping a game. After two disap
pointing losses to No. 14 Lewis
(Ind.) and Ball State last week
end, Stanford is hungry for wins
and will be satisfied with no less
than two in San Diego.
"It's true that we beat them a
month ago," head coach Ruben
Nieves said, "but 1 look at it like
we have to prove ourselves every

time we take the lloor. These
teams, like us, have gained a lot of
experience, and we're on their
turf now."
To lead the squad this week
end, Stanford looks again to
