# Gymnasts geared to bounce back in Boise
## Women will have first peek at nationals site 
### KATIE FITZPATRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Alter a rough meet at UCLA,
the No. 10 Stanford women's
gymnastics team heads to Boise
for a Sunday dual.
The importance of this week
end's meet is more than just re
gaining the momentum the Car
dinal had established at home.
This week's competition will be
an important step to achieving its
goal of qualifying for the 'Super
Six' team finals at the NCAA
Championships. Boise State will

be the host of Nationals, and a
good showing this weekend will
aid in confidence and comfort as
Stanford prepares to compete at
Nationals.
"What's most important is get
ting familiar with the equipment
and setup of the meet," said se
nior Ail-American Sarah Hard
ing.
Away meets are often more
difficult for gymnasts because
they must adjust to different
equipment and a different at
mosphere. At Nationals, the Car
dinal's experience and familiarity
with Boise will be an asset.
"It's a terrific opportunity to
take advantage of a low-key dual

meet â€” get familiar with the set
ting and psych up for Nationals,"
Harding said.
For the Cardinal, now that it
has both home and away meet ex
perience under its belt, it is time
to focus on the postseason. Be
cause of the way Nationals quali
fications work, it is very impor
tant that the women begin to
compete up to their potential as a
high-caliber, seasoned team.
Confident and consistent
gymnastics will aid the team in
achieving a high regional qualify
ing score (RQS). The RQS will
determine what region they com
pete in to qualify for Nationals.
Each region qualifies two teams
to Nationals. If their RQS is not
high enough to place them into
the top 12 in the nation, they will
compete in the Western region,
making Nationals much more
difficult to qualify for because of
the many strong teams in the
Western region.
Stanford's goal for this meet
will be to not have a routine with
a fall in it count toward their team
score. The Cardinal has achieved
this goal in the past, but as the
number of meets dwindle down,
this goal becomes paramount.
"Our focus once again will be
on consistency and carrying over
the confidence we have in our
own gym to Boise," said junior
Jennifer Exaltacion.
The Cardinal will have a
strong lineup in for Boise. Senior
All-American Larissa Fontaine
and Exaltacion will be contribut

ing on every event. Fontaine was
recently the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Gymnast of the Week and
should challenge for event titles
on every event. Exaltacion will be
strongest on the balance beam,
an event in which she owns the
school record.
Harding will challenge for the
floor title. When she hits, she is
one of the best in the nation.
Sophomore All-American Kristin
Jensen will showcase one of the
most difficult floor routines in
the nation.
Fellow sophomores Becky
Meldrum and Katy Herbert will
be instrumental to the balance
beam. Meldrum has been the
most consistent Cardinal gym
nast on the event this year.
The team is not short on tal
ent. If the women are consistent,
they will do very well against
Boise.
