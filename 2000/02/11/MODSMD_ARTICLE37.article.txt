# Women head back to waters in San Diego
## Preseason play begins this weekend as the No. 2 water polo team heads south to San Diego 
### ELISSA KESZLER 
This weekend the Stanford women's water
polo team begins preseason play down south
at a three-day tournament hosted by UC-San
Diego. I lie Cardinal is currently ranked No.
2 in the nation based upon its performance
last May at the national championships.
I he top teams in the nation will be partic
ipating in this weekend's games, including
top-ranked USC and third-ranked UCLA.
"The main goal of this tournament is to see
how we match up against the other teams,"
said head coach John Tanner.
Stanford is especially interested in seeing
both USC and UCLA
"These two teams, in addition to their
freshmen recruits, brought in a number of
players from Europe whom we've never seen
play," Tanner said. "This will give us a chance
to see what we will be going up against the rest
of the season."
For the last live weeks, the Cardinal has
put a tremendous emphasis on individual
and technical skills, such as one-on-one de

fense, ball handling and counterattacks.
" This weekend will give us a chance to fine
tune these skills in game situations," said ju
nior co-captain Anne-Marie Keenan. "It will
also give us an idea of where we need to im
prove."
Keenan and Tanner also expressed excite
ment for the return of junior Ail-American
Kelly Shouey. Over winter break, Shouey
tore the meniscus in her knee while playing
basketball and had orthoscopic surgery.
Shouey returned to a regular practice sched
ule earlier this week and is expected to re
ceive playing time this weekend.
This weekend is also an opportunity for
Stanford to get excited and set the stage for its
upcoming season.
"This is our first chance to go out there and
hold nothing back," said junior Allison New
port-Riddell. "We will show the other teams
that we are going to be competitive and in
tense from the start."
The Cardinal has high expectations this
year. Coining off a second-place finish at last
year's national championships, Stanford
wants to take the next step this year and bring
home the title.
Stanford graduated three seniors last year,
including Ail-American goalie Heather
Crary, All-American two-meter defender
Nicole Glazer and driver Lindsay I am.

Despite this loss, the team still remains in
credibly strong. In the goal are redshirt fresh
man Jackie Frank and junior Ali Henry.
Frank is also a member of the United States
National Team and redshirted last year to
participate in Olympic Trials. The team's two
co-captains, Keenan and junior Hilary Gallo
gly, will share the responsibility of two-meter
defense.
Among the hole sets are Shouey, sopho
more Kate Pettit and freshman Julie Gard
ner.
The team's drivers, who hold the responsi
bility of creating an active and unrelenting of
fense, are juniors Kris Koblik, Dani Bell and
Riddell, sophomore Margie Dingeldein, who
was last year's leading scorer, and freshmen
Amy Lightner and Nicole Huszcz.
For the team's three freshmen, Huszcz,
Lightner and Gardner, this will be their first
experience playing at the collegiate level. The
three expressed mixed feeling of excitement
and nervousness. All three are expected by
coaches and teammates to perform excep
tionally well and to receive an ample amount
of playing time.
The current plan for the Gardinal is to stay
focused on individual skills and intense con
ditioning through its preseason play and to
begin tactical work with the onset of the regu
lar season.
