## Late surge leads women to season-best 291 
### MATT MCQUINN 
Hie sixth-ranked Stanford
women's golf team finished its first
tournament of the spring season
with a powerful finish that vaulted
them into a tie for third place in the
Southern Methodist / Ohio State
University Regional Challenge.
The Cardinal struggled during
the first two days of the tourna
ment, failing to adjust to greens es
timated at close to 12 on the stint
meter. However, on the final day
the team pulled it together, post
ing a season-best 291.
Leading the Cardinal were ju

niors Stephanie Keever and 1 lilary
Honieyer, who posted final
rounds of4)8 and 70, respectively,
on the par-71 I'alos Verdes Golf
(Hub.
keever finished tied for fourth
in the tournament with a two-over
par 215, including two birdies and
an eagle on the par-four 17th.
"I'm really excited. The first two
days 1 hit the ball well but just
couldn't score," Keever said. "1
came back today and put up a
good number. It just worked."
Homeyer finished six shots be
hind Keever to place 10th in the
standings.
"This was one of the strongest
tournaments we've played in," said
1 lomeyer. "It was a great first tour
nament for the team."

Freshman Kim Rowton placed
10th in the tournament with a
three-day total of 228, which in
cluded a 74 in the second round.
Rounding out the Cardinal were
senior JaeJean Ro, (230) and ju
nior Lauren Robertson (242).
This competition fronted many
of the best teams from across the
country. Top-ranked Arizona took
home the trophy with a three-day
total of 869, 10 strokes ahead of
second-place USC.
Fifth-ranked Georgia finished
tied with the Cardinal at 894 with
the help of Shauna Estes, who led
all individuals, carding a one
under-par 212. The Cardinal's
strong final day vaulted them
ahead of Pepperdine and Arizona
State, who finished fifth and sixth,

respectively.
Despite the strong finish, the
women's golf team saw room for
improvement.
"We gave up a lot of strokes
putting and chipping," said head
coach Carolyn O'Connor. "We
didn't adjust to the speed of the
greens well. But, it was a good
tournament for ball-striking and
we improved every day."
The Cardinal lias one more
scheduled tournament for winter
quarter, the Arizona Wildcat Invita
tional in Tucson. Ariz., on Feb. 21.
In the spring, the team will
compete in two more tournaments
before it goes on to represent the
Cardinal in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships. The Cardi
nal will be entering the conference
championships as the defending
champion. However, with such
strong competition in the confer
ence, repeating this feat poses
quite a challenge.

-1 he team is emerging from a fall
season in which it was handicapped
by two redshirt members, one
golfer overseas and one on the soc
cer team.
Still, the Cardinal was able to
compete admirably against the
best teams in the country, finishing
with three seventh-place finishes
and an exciting third-place finish
at the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitation

al in Redmond, Wash.
With a deeper team this spring,
the team members must face fierce
competition just to qualify to rep
resent Stanford in the tourna
ments. This competition will pre
pare the Cardinal for tournament
play and may be the key ingredient
for O'Connor to take home her
first National Championship this
May.
