serving, Kim had an opportunity to
defeat Andersson and advance to
the finals. However, Andersson
came back to defeat Kim and even
tually win the tournament. Kim,
who has won two singles titles and
made a semifinal appearance in his

last three tournaments, fell to 17-2
on the season.
Abrams advanced to the semifi
nals without losing a set. In the first
round, Abrams beat No. 27 Johann
Jcx)ste of Baylor, 7-5, 6-3. Jooste
was a member of last year's Baylor
team that ousted the Cardinal in
the final 16 of the NGAA champi
onships. Then Abrams cruised

Martin Woisetschlaeger of Alaba

I.ike Kim, Abrams went the dis
tance with his opponent in the
semifinals before losing. Abrams
fell to second-seeded Jeff Morrison
of Florida, 6-7 (2-7), 6-2, 6-3. This
very tight match was decided by
only one service break in the final
set. Morrison, last year's NCAA

matches dating back to last season.
While Abrams fell to 18-4 this year,
in his four tournaments this season
lie has won a consolation title, ad

by I iansson and Wallinark, 3-6, 6-
4, 7-5. Abrams and Kim were actu
ally winning 5-4 in the final set and
serving for the match but could not
get the victory. The match ended
Abrams and Kim's 12-match win
ning streak this season.
Although the outcomes of the
tournament will not affect Stan
ford's team competition, it is very
important to the players' individual
rankings and seeding at the NCAA
Individual Championships in May.
"[Abrams and Kim's] perfor
mance could only help their rank
ings in singles," Gould said. "They
will probably keep their No. 1
ranking in doubles as well."
However, the ranking of an
other Stanford player, sopho
more K.J. Hippensteel, might
change because of the tourna
ment's results. Although he qual
ified for the ITA Indoors, Hip
pensteel, the No. 1 player in the
country, could not compete be
cause he has contracted a case of
mononucleosis. Therefore, he
might lose his No. 1 ranking to
Andersson, who won the tourna
ment.
Next up, the Cardinal (1-0) will
host San Diego State (0-0) on Fri
day at 1:30 p.m. and Georgia Tech
(1-1) on Saturday at noon at the
Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
