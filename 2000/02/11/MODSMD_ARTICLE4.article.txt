# Part-time professors?
## 
### AMY KOVAC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While research conducted in 1997 by the L'.S. Department of Edu
cation attested to a continuing trend in academia of hiring fewer lull
time faculty and more part-timers, Stanford seems to be maintaining
its commitment to hiring regular, full-time faculty.
The report, appearing in the Jan. 28 issue of an article of The
Chronicle off figher Education, stated that in 1970, only 22 percent of
professors were employed part-time, while in 1997,42.5 percent were
part-time hires.
Although the yearly increase in part-time faculty has been incre
mental, the trend has sparked alarm among many in the academic
community.
According to Provost John 1 lennessy, however, this trend is not the
case at Stanford.
"We make use of part-time lecturers in some areas either to

deal with teaching overloads, or in some cases because such lecturers
bring unusual skills, but we believe that regular full-time faculty, en
gaged in both teaching and research, should be the mainstay of the
University."
Henness) also added, "The total faculty size at the University is
growing, but verv slowlv, less than one percent per year, so most hir
ing is by replacement."
Ilennessy's comments were confirmed by data from several de
partments on campus.
Biological Sciences (lhair and Prof. 11. C raig Heller said, "()ver the
past ,'i() years, we have never had more than two or three lecturers in
biological sciences and never part-time professors."
I his is also the case in the Political Science Department, where, ac -
cording to the ('.hair. Prof. Barn Weingast, hiring of part-time facult\
is not common.
"Although the department regularly shares new hires with other
units at Stanford, including the I loover Institution and the (Graduate

School of Business, I cannot recall
hiring a faculty member only |>;u t
time. I don't believe any of our
current faculty were hired in this
manner," said Weingast.
(ihairof'the 1 listory Department
Prof, (larolyn Ixnigee-Chappell ac
knowledged that the issue has
been of some concern on a national
level because some schools are

manning their curricula with peo
ple to whom they have no commit
ment rather than tenured faculty.
Lou gee said, "We have not
done what a lot of places are doing.
We cover our curriculum wilh lull
lime tenured, faculty. When that
faculty goes on sabbatical, then we
will use short-term people."
When asked her opinion about
using more part-time faculty in the
future, Lougee added, "We are
not going in that direction. I don't
see ii happening here at Stanford."
