No. 13 Stanford at SD State
Site: San Diego, Calif.
Records: Stanford 2-6,2-4
Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation; San Diego State 1-5,0-5.
Game Notes: Stanford will
look to end a six-game skid
against the Aztecs, whom the
Cardinal beat in straight sets
last month. UC-San Diego, the
only other team the Cardinal
has beaten, could provide an
other much-needed win this
weekend.
Freshman standout Curt
Toppel leads the nation in kills
per game with 8.06, and has
recorded 62 in the last seven
games. Redshirt freshman Jon
Palacios may be moved from
the libero position to outside
hitter.
