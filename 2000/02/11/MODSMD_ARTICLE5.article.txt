# Local kids have science on the brain

Science sprung to life for sev
enth-graders at Jordan Middle
School in Palo Alto yesterday with
a visit from master's and post-doc
toral students in Stanford's Neuro
sciences program. The seventh
graders had a rare opportunity to
touch human brains and spinal
cords that the Stanford students
had brought for a hands-on
demonstration.
"It's weird," said seventh-grad
er Estevan Guerrero, moments
after holding a human brain in the
palm of his hand. "And it's proba
bly something you'll never get to
do again in your life."
Yesterday's visit was part of an
annual program to give all of Palo
Alto's seventh-grade classes hands
on experience with the brain. This
program, coordinated by Neuro
biology Prof. William Newsome,
included demonstrations at Jane
Lathrop Stanford Middle School
last week.
In the hour-long class, the visit
ing gradviate students first dis
cussed the various functions of the
brain with students and asked
them to make a list of diseases that
can affect the brain.
After this, the class donned latex
gloves and rotated through three
stations around the classroom. At
one, students could observe slices
of a human brain to see its internal
structure. At another, students
were given a chance to handle a
human brain and spinal cord. At a
third station, students compared
the relative size and structure of
the human brain with those of var
ious animals.
The presentation is designed to
supplement classroom instruction
on the brain. Students taught by
|ordan Middle School science
teacher Sue Pound have been
learning about the brain since Jan
uary. However, according to
Pound, this demonstration has an
effect on students that a textbook
cannot.
"It's three-dimensional and far
more real. It puts life to something
in a textbook." s.iid Pound.
Newsome has been sharing his
expertise with Palo Alto's seventh
graders since 1995 when his son
was in the seventh grade at Jane
Lathron Stanford Middle School.
