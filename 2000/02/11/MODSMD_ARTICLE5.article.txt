# Local kids have science on the brain

### KEITH ITO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Science sprung to life for sev
enth-graders at Jordan Middle
School in Palo Alto yesterday with
a visit from master's and post-doc
toral students in Stanford's Neuro
sciences program. The seventh
graders had a rare opportunity to
touch human brains and spinal
cords that the Stanford students
had brought for a hands-on
demonstration.
"It's weird," said seventh-grad
er Estevan Guerrero, moments
after holding a human brain in the
palm of his hand. "And it's proba
bly something you'll never get to
do again in your life."
Yesterday's visit was part of an
annual program to give all of Palo
Alto's seventh-grade classes hands
on experience with the brain. This
program, coordinated by Neuro
biology Prof. William Newsome,
included demonstrations at Jane
Lathrop Stanford Middle School
last week.
In the hour-long class, the visit
ing gradviate students first dis
cussed the various functions of the
brain with students and asked
them to make a list of diseases that
can affect the brain.
After this, the class donned latex
gloves and rotated through three
stations around the classroom. At
one, students could observe slices
of a human brain to see its internal
structure. At another, students
were given a chance to handle a
human brain and spinal cord. At a
third station, students compared
the relative size and structure of
the human brain with those of var
ious animals.
The presentation is designed to
supplement classroom instruction
on the brain. Students taught by
|ordan Middle School science
teacher Sue Pound have been
learning about the brain since Jan
uary. However, according to
Pound, this demonstration has an
effect on students that a textbook
cannot.
"It's three-dimensional and far
more real. It puts life to something
in a textbook." s.iid Pound.
Newsome has been sharing his
expertise with Palo Alto's seventh
graders since 1995 when his son
was in the seventh grade at Jane
Lathron Stanford Middle School.
Students and teachers found his
presentation interesting, and the
presentation became an annual
event at both of Palo Alto's middle
schools, prompting Newsome to
bring in his graduate students to
assist in teaching.
"It's now too much for me to do
by myself," Newsome said, "and
it's good for the grad students to
learn how to go to the public and
give presentations."
The graduate students empha
sized that their motivation came
from the excitement of seeing stu
dents finding things out about the
brain for the first time.
"When you do brain research
all day in and day out, you lose the
excitement. Sometimes, you don't
realize how amazing it is to have
information about the brain," said
neurosciences master's student
Silvia Bunge. "When kids find it

exciting, it's a reminder of what an
amazing field this is."
The students also see the
demonstrations as a good way to
encourage public support for basic
research.
"The only way that funding
will continue to happen is if peo :
pie understand why basic re
search is important, and it's get
ting harder to convince people,"
said Audrey Ettinger, a post-doc
toral student in Neurosciences.
"But kids seem to undei stand the
importance a lot better than
adults; they're always trying to
figure things out."
At the end of the one-hour class,
most of the seventh-graders left not
only with a new understanding of
the brain's physical structure, but
also with a new excitement about
science. , w .Â») h ~< r , - ,1;
"It was really cool. We had
learned this stuff before by seeing
it on paper," said seventh-grader
Sasha Pitre. "But it's a lot?better aci
tually feeling the brain and talking
to people who worked with it."
