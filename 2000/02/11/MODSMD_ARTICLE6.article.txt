### GREG PAGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Editor's Note: This is the second story in a sc
ries looking at the key issues that will define the
2000 Presidential flection campaign. On Mon
days and Fridays each week until the March 7
California Primary, we will evaluate the stances
adopted by the leading candidates on a major
issue.

today's stniy looks at civil rights issues cur
rently receiving attention in the campaign: the
Confederate flag an/lgay rights.
After this week's victories in the
Delaware primaries by Vice President AI
Gore and Texas Governor George W.
Hush, national attention is shilling to the
upcoming Republican primary in South
Garolina on Feb. 19.
South Garolina has lately been the sub
ject of national controversy because the
Confederate llag Ilies at its statehouse. Last
year, the National Association for the Ad
vancement of Golored People called for a
symbolic national boycott of the state. As a
result, the state is expected to lose millions

of dollars in tourism revenue this year.
I lowever. its legislature refuses to budge on
the issue.
Republicans and Democrats are split
along part) lines with regards to the state's
right to ll\ the llag.
Bradley, who is making race relations a
central theme of his campaign, calls the
flag's presence "an allront to blacks." At a
VVednesdav speech at South Carolina's

benedict College, he stated, "-That llag is
not a symbol of southern heritage; that
llag is ,i svmbol ofthe fight to preserve seg
regation."
Gore did not visit South Carolina (his
week. 1 le too has said that "the Confeder
ate flag divides," and that it should come
down. However, be does not support the
proposed boycott of South Carolina.
Bush, the Republican front-runner, says
that the flag decision should be left to the
state. "People have different points of view
on this issue," he told supporters at a South
(Carolina rally Tuesday, "That's win it's im
portant for the people ol South (Carolina to
decide."
McC lain's statements echo those of Bush,

as he has stated he too wishes to leave the
decision to the South ('.arolina legislature.
Freshman kimberh I orrence, head of
the |olin McCain campaign at Stanford,
said about McCain's stance: "To some peo
ple, the flag is a sign of slavery but to others,
including McCain, it is a symbol of her
itage."
In addition to the debate over the flag,
another important civil rights issue that has
come to the Ibrefri >nt ofthe national debate
this election season is gay rights. With Cali
fornia set to vote on same-sex marriage by
referendum in March, presidential candi
dates' stances on gay rights are becoming

iii( teasing!) impoitaut.
Bradley lias said that 11 it- (livil
Rights Act and hate crimc laws
should appl\ to homosexuals. He
also stated thai homosexuals
should he able to serve openlv in
the military. Although Bradley said
he is opposed to same-sex mar
riages, he would not try ban thenias
President.
(.ore takes a slightly more con
servative approach than Bradley.
I le too believes gays should be able
to sei ve openly in the military. And
although he would expand laws for
homosexuals, he would not re
open the( livil Rights Act to include
them.
While (lore opposes same-sex
man iages, he would consicler same
sex "partnerships," by which gays
could receive the benefits of inar
i iage wit Ik>iit the marriage title.
Mc( .lin, a decorated military
veteran, supports the current
"don't ask, don't tell" policy regard
in}!, gays in the military. I le has crit
ici/ed both (.ore and Bradley for
saving the\ would only appoint a
Joint (lliiefs ol Stall (lhaii man who
suppot ted open ga\ iuilitai v partic -
ipation.
At a Republican dinner in New
I lampshirc last month, Mi (lain
said, "The critical choice should be
made without a political litmus test.
1 he pm pose ol t lie |oint (lliiels is to
advise the President on military
matters ol poli< y."
Bush opposes the New |ersey
Supreme Court ruling that stated
"the Boy Scotits ol America must
accept gavs in theii organi/ation."
Additionallv', he believes hate
< i imc laws.should not appK to gays,
that ga\ anti-discrimination laws
should not exist, and that same-sex
marriages should not exist at all.
