to informing subjects about the incredible deals available to them
through Varsity Ford and Stanford Lincoln Mercury.These dealers in
conjunction with SFCU,are offering exceptional values from Febru
ary 18-21. Buy any new 1999 Ford/Mercury car or truck and receive
$100 under invoice total.* Additionally, any new 2000 Ford/Mercury
