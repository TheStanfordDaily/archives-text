One of the greatest chal
lenges in young adult-hood
is learning about love - how to
love, whom to love, and, most
important, developing self-love.
Capacity to Love
The ability to love requires a
sequence of experiences:
1. You learn about love by first
being loved by your primary
caregivers and others.
2. You learn to internalize
being loved in the absence of
primary caregivers.
3. You are able to transform
loving and soothing yourself
into loving others.
These are prerequisites to being
able to love another person.
When these "stages" only
partially occur, occur out of
sequence, or don't occur at all,
difficulties can arise. High self
esteem is essential for giving
and receiving love. If you have
doubts about your worth, it
may be a good time to get some
counseling and examine where
and how these beliefs emerged
so you can work on them.
In Love?
It feels like magic: your heart
soars; there's great excitement
and anticipation. But being "in
love" may or may not overlap
with really loving someone. Is
there a difference between
"love" and "being in love"? It's
debated. Some claim both can
exist throughout a relationship;
others say the"in love" feeling
is an idealization of the partner

"Hubba Hubba" in your
grandparents' day, "groovy" in
your parents', and now "E Mail
Me" in yours. The "Let's Kiss"
is likely to go on as long as the
candies do.
during courtship, and that it
can evolve into love.
Romantic love often requires
courage, because this kind of
love challenges your potential
for intimacy.
Projection
You are "projecting" if you
impose your own perceptions
and expectations onto another
person. If your love is based
on projection, it won't last,
because you're in love with a
fantasized image, not a real
person. It can be highly
deceptive, and the disappoint
ment is enormous when you
realize it.
The "Wrong" Person
Some people love those who
cannot love them back, treat them
well, or provide a compatible
partnership. Often there's some
thing familiar about the way
you're not loved back. This
occurs on an unconscious level,
until you begin to see a pattern of
choosing wrong partners. The
familiar, even though not fully
satisfying, is more comfortable
than the unknown. To break this
pattern, become aware of it, and
consciously make different
choices.
Attachment
Attachment is a by-product of
love. It comes from loving
feelings toward the person,
spending time together, and
sharing experiences and
activities. It's hard to relinquish
the sense of security that
develops from such closeness.
This is why it often takes many
messy attempts over time to
fully let go of someone to whom
you're attached.
Good Relationships
Here are characteristics of
truly fulfilling relationships:
■ Your expectations are based
on reality, not fantasy
■ You can overcome your
fears of rejection, vulner
abilities, and past disap
pointments
■ Your emotions and intellect
are not in conflict
■ Both partners' needs are
met
■ There's enough space for you
to love yourself as well as
your partner
Love is an expansive energy -
it enables you to grow into
who you are.
