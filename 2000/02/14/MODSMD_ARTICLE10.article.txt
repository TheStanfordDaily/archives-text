# Candidates under the gun
## 
### GREG PAGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Two weeks into the primary sea
son, this year's presidential candi
dates have taken increasingly to
mudslinging. But issues remain an
important part of primary politics
— including the touchy topic of
gun control.
On the Republican side, Sen.
John McCain and Texas Gov.
George W. Bush have both hit the
airwaves in South Carolina (site of
the Feb. 19 primary), each accus
ing the other of being a "Washing
ton insider." Last week, former
Sen. Bill Bradley spoke at a middle
school in U>s Angeles, calling for
stricter gun control and blasting
Vice President A 1 Gore for not
doing enough to stop gun crime.
Bradley frequently reminds au
diences that, as president, he
would "stand up to the National
Ride Association. Conventional
wisdom tells us it is politically per
ilous to take them on. But our chil
dren's future and safety is far too
precious... we must act now."
Bradlev calls for a nationwide

registration of all 65 million hand
guns in the United States. He pro
poses to limit gun buyers to one
purchase per month, require back
ground checks at gun shows and
prohibit gun dealers from selling
guns in residential neighborhoods.
Gore, Bradley's Democratic
rival, has a similar gun control
plan. If elected, Gore hopes to im
plement a series of programs orig
inally sponsored by the Clinton ad
ministration. These programs in
volve child-safety locks on guns, a
photo ID requirement for gun
purchase and an outright ban on
certain types of guns.
I n addition, Gore has called for a
three-day waiting period for all gun
purchases and, like his rival, a one
gun per month limit for buyers.
Gore's Web site claims, "The
current patchwork of laws and reg
ulations leaves t<x> many loopholes
for criminals to exploit and too
many opportunities for guns to get
into the wrong hands."
Both GOP candidates, Bush
and McCain, are hesitant about re
stricting the individual freedoms of
buying and possessing firearms.

Bush opposes the assault
weapons ban as well as gun pur
chase waiting periods. He also op
poses "government-mandated
registration of all guns owned by
law abiding citizens," and says that
the right to carry concealed
weapons is "needed in our danger
ous society."
Claiming that "the best gun con
trol is more prosecution," Bush ad
vocates stronger enforcement of
existing gun laws and harsher
penalties for criminals who commit
crimes with guns.
Bush does, however, believe in
banning certain types of ammuni
tion. 1 le also seeks to raise the legal
minimum age for gun purchase
from 18 to 21.
McCain wishes to repeal exist
ing gun restrictions; in the Senate,
he voted against both the Brady
Bill and the assault weapons ban.
McCain's campaign literature
states, "1 don't support gun bans or
other measures that impinge on
Constitutionally protected, indi
vidual rights — including the Sec-

AAAANDA CANEVARO/The Stanford Daily

ond Amendment right of Ameri
cans to own firearms."
Nevertheless, McClain does not
oppose all gun control measures,
lie has said that "trigger locks
should be used to pre>tect children
and stop intruders from using a
firearm."
