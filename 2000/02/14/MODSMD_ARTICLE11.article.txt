# Zoot Suit festivities begin
## 
### AMIT GARG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Zoot Suit Week, celebrating an important time
period in Chicano history and culture, begins today
with events ranging from serious presentations on
racial turmoil to a Saturday night party. The events
are sponsored by ethnic theme house Casa Zapata.
Zoot suits are a style of dress that characterized
Chicano / Latino youth in the 1930s and 1940s —
baggy pants tapered at the ankles, longjackets, long
watch chains and broad-brimmed hats.
But the Zoot Suit era was also a time of growing
prejudice against Mexican-Americans.
"As the country was wrapped up in war hysteria,
cultural xenophobia hit dramatic levels in L. A. as
the city backlashed against 'Mexican baby gang
sters'," said sophomore Jorge Manzano, an ethnic
theme assistant at Zapata.
In the Sleepy Lagoon murder case of 1942, 17
Chicanos were convicted of the murder of another

Chicano youth by an-all white jury on the basis of
circumstantial evidence. Tensions exploded into vi
olence, sparking riots in 1943 Los Angeles.
"At one point, Marines and sailors entered L. A.
barrios in nightly raids to beat up anyone that
looked Mexican," Manzano said. "The basic idea be
hind Zoot Suit Week is to look back and commemo
rate events that galvanized the Mexican-American
experience in Los Angeles din ing the HMO's."
Many activities have been planned for the week.
Tonight at 7:30 p.m. in the Zapata Lounge,
Gabriela Rico will present a lecture entitled " The
Zoot Suit Riots: Social Uprising and the Aftermath."
"Zoot Suit," a 1981 production of Luis Valdez
based on the Sleepy Lagoon murder, will be show
cased tomorrow at 7 p.m. in the Zapata Lounge.
On Wednesday, a "pachuco style" workshop on
makeup, costume and dance will be held in the Za
pata lounge at 7 p.m.
