## U.N. world trade conference attracts economic criticism Poor nations skeptical of globalization policy 
### 
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) —
Economic globalization may be
inevitable, but the leaders of poor
nations told an international trade
conference Saturday that it holds
painful and frightening conse
quences for their countries.
The weeklong U.N. Conference
on Trade and Development,
which started Saturday, was being
touted as a place for trade officials
to redeem December's debacle in
Seattle, where street protests
turned violent and World Trade
Organization ministers failed to
launch a new round of global com
merce talks.
But security issues plagued the
Bangkok meeting as well, with an
American anti-free trade activist
dodging a cordon around the con
ference to throw a pie in the face of
International Monetary Fund
chief Michel Camdessus.
Following the embarrassing
incident, Camdessus went ahead
with a speech, his last before step
ping down as IMF chief.
He used the occasion to counter
claims that his organization has
ignored the concerns of ordinary
people.
"Globalization can now be seen
in a positive light ... as the best
means of improving the human
condition throughout the world,"
he said.
Camdessus said foreign invest
ment in the Third Work! has enor
mous potential to close the income
gap, while information technology
has given poor nations access to
knowledge that was once the pre
serve of the rich.
The U.N. meeting, held every
four years, focuses more on the
developing world and a feeling
among many of its leaders that
they cannot access wealth created
by a global system centered on

high technology and increased
power by multinational corpora
tions.
Such corporations — some
already financially more powerful
than medium-sized countries —
will keep getting bigger through
mergers and acquisitions, warned
Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad.
"While we welcome their collab
oration with our local companies,
we fear if they are allowed into our
countries unconditionally, they
may swallow up all our business
es," said Mahathir, long a vocal
critic of the West.
"I am worried and frightened at
the preparations being made by
corporations in certain industries
and business activities in order to
take advantage of liberalization
and globalization."
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Ohuchi said Saturday that his
country, the richest in Asia, would
agree to open its market to most
goods from the poorest countries,
lie would only make this agree
ment if the United States and
Furope go along with it too .
I he Europeans have given the
idea a warmer response than the
Americans, Japanese officials said
privately.
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan called for a "Global New
Deal," with rich nations extending
a helping hand to their poor
neighbors.
" I he downsides of globalization
are indeed painful," said Philip
pine President Joseph Fstrada,
whose nation lags many of its
neighbors economically.
"But taking the bigger pills
against its ills is superior to living
inside a sterile bubble."
After the pie-throwing incident,
Prime Minister Oman Leekpai
ordered stepped-up security at the
convention center and hotels
where delegates from some 190
nations are gathered.
