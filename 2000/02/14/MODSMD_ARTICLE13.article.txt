# Democrats rally support for McCain
## Bush alleges that Democrats skew polls in Republican primaries 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Gov.
George W. Bush expressed con
cern yesterday that Democrats are
mobilizing to support Sen. John
McCain in South Carolina's open
Republican presidential primary.
But McCain said Bush's allega
tion that some Democrats believe
McCain would be the easier can

didate to defeat in the general
election in November "Ilies in the
face of the facts."
" The facts are that indepen
dents are also Hocking in large
numbers to my candidacy as well
as Republicans," McCain said on
CBS' "Fate the Nation." "Kvery
body knows that if you're going to
win a general election, you have
to have those independents and
some Democrats."
He said it was his message that
was attracting non-Republicans.
"I'm very proud that Libertari

ans or vegetarians or anybody
would consider supporting me
because I have a vision of reform
for America that I think is taking
hold, not only in South Carolina
but all over the country," McCain
said.
" The only thing I'm concerned
about is that Democrats flock into
the Republican primary to decide
who the Republican nominee is,
and then head back for the
Democrats in the general elec
tion," Bush said on NBC's "Meet
the Press."
