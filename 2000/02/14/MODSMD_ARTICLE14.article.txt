# Cartoonist dies on eve of final strip
## Creator of beloved 'Peanuts' characters dies of colon cancer 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — For
months, fans have tried to figure
out how they would survive with
out their favorite comic strip.
Now, they'll have to struggle on
without the "Peanuts" creator as
well.
Fans have poured out their
feelings in the months since
Charles Schulz announced he
would end the most widely syndi
cated comic strip in history.
His final new strip was pub
lished yesterday. Late Saturday
night, he died in his sleep at his
home in Santa Rosa. ()nly his wife
was with him, said his son, Craig
Schulz.
In the the months before
Schulz succumbed to colon can
cer, readers groaned at the
prospect of life without Charlie
Brown and Lucy, dispensing
advice from her psychiatrist
stand.
"1 have loved that round-head
ed kid since I was -1 years old,"
said Justin Gage of Hampstead,

N.H. "And with all the practice in
the world, I honestly, still, at 31,
can't keep my kite out of the trees
in my backyard."
Schulz's characters showed up
on people's doorsteps every single
day for nearly 50 years. They
brought distinct personalities,
hopes, fears and foibles. Schroed
er carted a toy piano. Linus
brought his blue blanket. And
people took them in.
Julian McCarthy, a 43-year-old
engineer from Kingston-upon-
Thames, England, said "Peanuts"
characters make you happy but
also "contact your conscience and
make you reflect on a course of
action, something maybe you've
said or done."
They'll be lifelong friends, he
says, even though Schulz's con
tract stipulates that no one else
will draw the strip again.
In December, shortly after he
was diagnosed with colon cancer
and suffered a series of small
strokes during abdominal
surgery, the 77-year-old cartoon
ist decided his deadlines had
become too rigorous. It was time
to stop.
A hundred letters a day
arrived in recent weeks at Schulz's

stuclio, located at 1 Snoopy Place
in Santa Rosa — down from the
500 per day that had arrived after
lie announced his retirement in
November.
"I know it is just ink on a
page," said 25-year-old Adam
Smith of Hoover, Ala., "but to

those of us who loved them, the
gang is very, very, real."
In his characters, Schulz gave
us enough detail to recognize per
sonality types but little enough so
that we could still see ourselves in
them, said Boston College sociolo
gy professor Paul Schervish.
