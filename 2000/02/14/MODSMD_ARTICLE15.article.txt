# Large cyanide spill in Romania creates ecological catastrophe
## Neighboring nation demands compensation 
### 
BECEJ, Yugoslavia (AP) — Ser
bia announced yesterday that it
will demand compensation at an
international court from those
responsible for a cyanide spill that
contaminated a major river,
destroying most aquatic life.
The spill in the I isa River,
which originated in Romania,
apparently sunk to non-lethal lex -
els yesterday after reaching the
Danube. Before that, however, it
had devastated the river in Hun
gary and Serbia. Serbian Environ
ment Minister Branislav Bla/ic
said it would take at least five years
for life in the 1 isa to recover.
Bla/ic accused Romania of cov
ering up the real dimensions of
the poisoning, which some envi
ronmentalists say could be the
biggest ecological catastrophe in
Europe since the Chernobyl
nuclear reactor catastrophe in
1986.
"The Tisa has been killed. Not
even bacteria have survived," Blaz
ic said as he toured the area along
the river in northern Serbia. "This
is a total catastrophe."
"We will demand an estimation
of the damage and we will
demand that the culprits for this

tragedy be punished," he said.
Romania played down the envi
ronmental damage. But people —
not just aquatic life — are at risk
due to the spill, said Predrag Pro
lic, a professor of chemistry and
toxicology at Belgrade University.
I fc said those with wells close to
the riverbed are in danger. Birds
feeding off fish could die, he said.
I lie poisoned water also can filter
into the soil and then contaminate
grass, grain, and livestock, Prolic
said.
Serbian Agriculture Minister
Jovan Babovic said yesterday that
after the toxic waste entered the
Danube, the concentration of
cyanide dropped below 0.2 mil
ligrams per liter, a non-lethal level.
But the Beta news agency cited
eyewitnesses who said the that the
Danube was "all white with the bel
lies of dead fish" between the spot
where it joins the lisa and Bel
grade, about 50 miles to the south
east. The fish were possibly
washed down from the I isa.
In Bucharest, Romania, envi
ronmental official Anton Vlacl sug
gested the spill's effects had been
overstated.
"1 have the impression that it is
exaggerated," Vlad told national
radio.
The cyanide spill originated in
northwest Romania, near the bor

der town of Oradea, where a dam
at the Baia Mare gold mine over
flowed Jan. 30, causing cyanide to
pour into streams.
At the mine, a cyanide solution
is used to separate gold ore from
surrounding rock.
From there, the polluted water
flowed west into the 1 isa in neigh
boring Hungary, killing large
numbers of fish there, and then
into Yugoslavia.
Prolic said the peak concentra
tion of cvanide in the river was 20
times the permissible level.
Poisonous lieaw metals such as
lead can be left behind after the
cyanide dissipates and can also
leech into the soil, he said.
In Serbia, dozens of volunteers
and fisherman wearing protective
rubber gloves removed hundreds
of dead fish 112 rom the 1 isa to bury
them.
Heaps of fish littered the river
bank.
Experts and officials estimate
that some ISO percent of the fish in
the I isa have died since the con
tamination entered the country
Friday.
"Everything's dead, cyanide
destroyed the entire food chain,"
said local fisherman Slobodan
krkljes. TV "Fishing was my job. I
don't know what I'm going to do
now."
