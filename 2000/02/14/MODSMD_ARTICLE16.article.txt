## The 						Stanford Daily Special fee decision sends wrong message 
### 
The graduate student
Council voted last week to fund
posters and ads for the Inter Var
sity Graduate Christian Fellow
ship. Yet, because the GSC special fee
refund request deadline passed weeks ago
on Jan. 29, the decision to fund the Fellow
ship this late in the term leaves graduate
students no option but to support the
group.
GSC member Chris Stromberg, a doctor
al student in chemistry, initially submitted
the issue for review by the Constitutional
Council due to some GSC members' uncer
tainty over whether funding the group
would be consistent with the ASSU's consti
tution. After deliberating over the criteria
for 112 unding and deciding that the organiza

tion had significant graduate student mem
bers hip before the Constitutional Council
considered the case, the GSC agreed to
fund the group.
Despite the widespread agreement with
in the GSC to fund the group, the decision
prevents other graduate students from
choosing not to support the group. While
the GSC's deliberate effort to avoid consid
ering the philosophy of the organization
under consideration is admirable, students
choosing which groups to support through
their special fee do consider the group's
philosophy. After the special fee refund
request deadline, however, they have no
alternative.
If the constitutional issue simply could
not have been resolved prior to the special

fee refund request deadline, the GSC could
have postponed the decision until the
spring, and the Fellowship would have
been left to raise $175 for publicity for a
graduate student event some other way.
At the same time, funding for the group
is contentious not only because the refund
deadline has passed, but also because the
ASSU has traditionally rejected funding for
religious groups, and the GSC decision sets
a new precedent independent of the Con
stitutional Council.
The ASSU funds groups which are open
to all; since religious groups have rarely
asked for funding, the ASSU and GSC have
not had to address this question of whether
religious groups are truly inclusive. While
some may say the GSC is simply applying

the old standard to new groups, it is not J
clear that religious groups should be treat- j
ed like other organizations. Are they really i
open to all? Do they alienate large sectors j
of the student body?
The argument that religious groups in •
the past have applied for funding under
the guise of being cultural groups shows _
that the campus as a whole would probably ;
not choose to fund these groups, so much [
so, that these group must pretend to be l!
something it is not.
By remaining "neutral" to the group's j!
philosophy, the GSC has endorsed funding ;j
for religious groups and has introduced aij
new set of practices which students cannot |»
help but support with their special fee;;
money.
