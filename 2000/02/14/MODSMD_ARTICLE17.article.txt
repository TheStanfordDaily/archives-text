# WHAT THE HECK I'M TALKING ABOUT
## V2K: A Valentine's Day to remember 
### 
Happy Valentine's Day. Really, I
mean it. I may not technically
have a "valentine" this time
around, but 1 have decided not to get
hostile. 1 will not embark on an anti-
Valentine's Day rampage in my column
this week. 1 figure, not only might I

make a poor second
impression on you,
but I might also create
a strange following
that I'm not sure I'd
like to take on.
What if my new
readers suggested 1
write a column
denouncing PDAs
(public displays of
affection) at campus

parties because they make single peo pie
feel unsure of themselves and are statisti
cally proven to increase the random
hook-up quota by means of sheer peer
pressure?
Or, suppose the readers of "What the
heck I'm talking about" wanted me to
bash the next somewhat festive holiday,
like St. Patrick's Day, because — let's say
— it isn't counter-balanced by !?() other
holidays celebrating the rest of the multi
cultural rainbow. Just imagine how
much trouble I'd get myself into.
I'm not out to make enemies. And

besides, I've been known to have had a
nice Valentine's Day in my time.
So instead of selfishly crooning the
injustices of this lovers' holiday, 1
thought I'd help the cause and discover
the ultimate Valentine's Day gilt for the
millennium.
That's right, V2K.
And as Deßeers (diamond manufactur
er, for all ye uneducated in high-end jew
elry) says in a magazine ad they've been
running this week: "A card and some
llowers? That's so 1999." You've got it,
folks. A new century calls for a new bench
mark in your yearly declaration of love.
When 1 saw the ad, it occurred to me
that there are some intriguing similari
ties between Feb. 14 and Jan. 1.
People get all excited about both for a
week to an entire month beforehand. Big
plans are made. Restaurants called.
Dresses or suits purchased. Kisses antici
pated. Hopes are definitely up. If you're
in a relationship, whatever happens on
your Valentine's or New Year's date can
change things. Or cement them into same
old boring way they've always been. Both
are great occasions for DTR-ing (defining
the relationship). If you have a first date
on either holiday, it can prove to be espe
cially spectacular or uniquely disastrous.
Both can also be kind of antic limactic.

But no more. With this great V2K gift,
expectations will inevitably be surpassed.
_ My discovery?
The Millennium Diamond!
I realize this is a girl's gilt. But realisti
cally, I have no idea what men want —
for Valentine's Day or on any day.
But yikes! Let's talk about you. So you
may be asking yourself, what is this mil

lennium diamond? Well, I've never actu
ally seen the thing. I'm not big on setting
myself up for disappointment. It would,
perhaps, be similar to test-driving a
Porsche. I 'd get a big kick out of taking
my dream car for a spin, but at the end
of the day I'd still be driving home in my
budget sub-compact car, right? Waving
goodbye to iny little blue 911, all alone in
the showroom. This may just be me.
I've heard various stories of the mil
lennium diamond from those who have
ventured beyond the walls and window
displays, into the jewelry boutiques. They

have told tales of their adventures, and
I've decided it's time for all the legend
and lore to be put to use. The millenni
um diamond sits in a platinum or gold
setting, catches the light and the eye from
across a crowded room and rings in at
around $48,000.
What's so special about it? Well, ladies
and gentlemen, this particular diamond
has "2000" engraved into the bottom of
the stone. Invisible to the naked eye, the
inscription may be viewed by your
friends and family under a specially craft
ed computer lens. (We wouldn't, after all,

want to be ostentatious.) And what better
way to say "I love you" in the information
age than through a jewel that her off
spring can look at years and decades
down the line and say, "Wow, Great-
Granny Em sure had a nice boyfriend at
the turn of the century!" Provided they
have a special computer lens.
So girls, you can drop the hint to your
valentine by clipping pictures of dia
monds and diamond rings and casually
pinning these to his door. You could
even make a pretty collage.
Better yet, go to the jewelry store Web

site, link to the millennium diamond and
make this his screen saver.
Guys, now you may know what these
hints mean. Take out a loan — go ahead!
What do you have to lose besides your
credit rating?
No, no — don't thank me. Thank St.
Valentine for making it all possible. I'm
just glad to have helped.
