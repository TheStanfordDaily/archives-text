# WHAT THE HECK I'M TALKING ABOUT
## V2K: A Valentine's Day to remember 
### 
Happy Valentine's Day. Really, I
mean it. I may not technically
have a "valentine" this time
around, but 1 have decided not to get
hostile. 1 will not embark on an anti-
Valentine's Day rampage in my column
this week. 1 figure, not only might I

make a poor second
impression on you,
but I might also create
a strange following
that I'm not sure I'd
like to take on.
What if my new
readers suggested 1
write a column
denouncing PDAs
(public displays of
affection) at campus

parties because they make single peo pie
feel unsure of themselves and are statisti
cally proven to increase the random
hook-up quota by means of sheer peer
pressure?
Or, suppose the readers of "What the
heck I'm talking about" wanted me to
bash the next somewhat festive holiday,
like St. Patrick's Day, because — let's say
— it isn't counter-balanced by !?() other
holidays celebrating the rest of the multi
cultural rainbow. Just imagine how
much trouble I'd get myself into.
I'm not out to make enemies. And

besides, I've been known to have had a
nice Valentine's Day in my time.
So instead of selfishly crooning the
injustices of this lovers' holiday, 1
thought I'd help the cause and discover
the ultimate Valentine's Day gilt for the
millennium.
That's right, V2K.
And as Deßeers (diamond manufactur
er, for all ye uneducated in high-end jew
elry) says in a magazine ad they've been
running this week: "A card and some
llowers? That's so 1999." You've got it,
folks. A new century calls for a new bench
mark in your yearly declaration of love.
When 1 saw the ad, it occurred to me
that there are some intriguing similari
ties between Feb. 14 and Jan. 1.
People get all excited about both for a
week to an entire month beforehand. Big
plans are made. Restaurants called.
Dresses or suits purchased. Kisses antici
pated. Hopes are definitely up. If you're
in a relationship, whatever happens on
your Valentine's or New Year's date can
change things. Or cement them into same
old boring way they've always been. Both
are great occasions for DTR-ing (defining
the relationship). If you have a first date
on either holiday, it can prove to be espe
cially spectacular or uniquely disastrous.
Both can also be kind of antic limactic.
