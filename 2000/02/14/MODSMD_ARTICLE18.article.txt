Continuing the abortion debate
In view of the recent letters debating
the Stanford Students For Choice Feb. 3
advertisement (disguised as a column
concerning "winter malaise") in Ihe
Daily, some clarification is in order with
regards to abortion.
First of all, to say that one is "pro
choice" but not pro-abortion is like saying
one supports capital punishment but
opposes executions. This would clearly
not be the case if the "pro-choice" label
were to rcler to supporting one's right to
choose it presidential candidate, a favorite
sports team or a course of study.
I lowever, as it specifically refers to sup
porting one's right to choose to have an
abortion, I fail to see how one can be
against abortion and yet support a per
son's right to choose abortion. The choice
of abortion leads to abortion and
nowhere else.
Second, to support a woman's right to

choose an abortion because she should
have control over her body is also a con
tradiction. Yes, a woman should have
control over her body. But this control
does not extend to a fetus for the simple
reason that the fetus (or more accurately,
the developing child) is NO T part of her
b< >dy.
If it were part of the woman's body,
then every aspect of it, including DNA
composition, blood type and even gen
der, would be identical to those of the
mother. The fact that they obviously are
not (I low often does a child look EXACT
LY like his or her mother?) clearly indi
cates that the fetus is a distinct person
from the mother.
Third, to those who oppose outlawing
abortion on the grounds that doing so
would expose women obtaining illegal (e.
g. "back-alley") abortions to greater dan
ger, consider the following. Abortion clin
ics today are not subject to the same
health regulations that nearly all other

health care facilities are subject to. In fact,
to say that abortion clinics are underregu
lated is an understatement.
Women have been seriously injured,
both emotionally and physically, in
obtaining abortions, injuries which have
had long lasting effects, such as sterility,
emotional trauma and increased risk of
breast cancer. Even more seriously,
women have died in obtaining abortions
in clinics that were supposed to be "safe."
Finally, behind the rhetoric of "repro
ductive freedom" and "choice" lies the
horrifying truth about abortion. Namely,
it involves the destruction of innocent life
by arguably the most brutal methods
imaginable.
If dismemberment, which results from
the dialation and curetage (1) & C) and
dialation and extraction (D & E) methods,
and burning, which results from saline
abortions, were used as methods of exe
cution, their use would be soundly con
demned and outlawed. Yet, by these very

methods, upwards of 4,000 lives are
destroyed DAILY, all in the name of
"choice." To absorb the horror of abor
tion, one need only look at a picture of an
aborted fetus. If this does not dissuade
someone from supporting a woman's
"right to choose," I don't know of any
thing that will.

Sometimes for no apparent reason
people may come into your life and pro
ceed to lift it beyond anything you could
imagine, or deserve. A girl. A ballplayer. A
cartoonist. And then the day comes that
they're gone.
And the only thing that remains to you
is to be that meaningful to someone else,
if only you can.
I've never understood the words quite

so keenly: Good grief.
