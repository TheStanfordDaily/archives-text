story. "It's a story that I was literal
ly working on at live this morning
before getting on a plane to come
out here," O'Brien said.

The story was tentatively titled
"July 69," referencing the first
manned expedition to the moon's
surface. It was inspired by the
death of a young soldier that

been trying to write this story,"

He answered several audience
questions, such as whether or not
he would trade his war experience
for his literary success. O'Brien an

through the same experience and
said that, if he were able to go back,
"I would have the courage to say
no to a war that 1 despised."
