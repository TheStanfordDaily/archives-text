### MAUREEN MULLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Freshman Jamie Carey scored eight
points in the final three minutes of play to
lilt the No. 24 Stanford women's basket
ball team (1 ">-(), 8-3 Pacific 10 Conference)
over Oregon State (10-13, 6-5) 58-54 on
Saturday night.
"Our backs were definitely against the

wall," Stanford coach Lara VanDerveer
said. "Being down seven points, we could
have folded and we did not. It was a must
game. We needed it and we got it."
Carey led Stanford with 14 points on a
4-of-5 three-point shooting performance.
Senior Milena Flores added 10 points and
seven assists, and Sophomore Bethany
Donaphin chipped in 10 points.
Sophomore Lauren St. Clair led the
Cardinal in rebounds with seven and con
tinued to be a threat from beyond the arc
hitting three treys for nine points.
Senior Sissel Pierce was the star for ()re
gon Slate. She led all scorers with 18 points
and also had 4 blocks for the Beavers.

Pierce, who leads the Pac-10 in blocks, tied
Oregon State's single season blocks record
held by former Olympian Carol Menken-
Schaudt.
But she wasn't enough to match Carey.
"It was Carey's night," said Oregoij
State coach Judy Spoelstra. "We got
'Careyed' away."
Throughout the first hall both teams
battled poor shooting and many
turnovers, keeping the score low. Alter a
Carey buzzer-beating three pointer, Sum
lord went into the locker room down l)\
one, 20 -25.
Probably the biggest factor lor the
Beavers throughout the first half and the

majority of the second was their rebound
ing advantage. While Oregon State shot
only 33.3 percent from the field in the first
half, to Stanlbi d's 41 percent, offensive re
bounds allowed the Beavers to get second
chance shots.
rhroughout most of the second half,
the Beavers maintained their lead. Things
were looking down lor the (lardinal, when
Carey bit a clutch three-pointei with the
shoot clock running down.
"She has range and poise," Van-
Derveer said of Carey. "We got open for
some shots and people were able to put
shots down."
The bucket, which came with 3:14 re

inaining in the half, pulled Stanford with
in one. I lores then stole the ball from the
Beavers, making a lay up to give Stanford
its first lead since early in the game.
Carey continued her heroics, and in
similar fashion heat the shot clock for an
other three, putting the Cardinal ahead by
four with only two minutes remaining in
the game.
With 22 seconds left Carey made a pair
of free throws to cement the Cardinal vic
tory.
The split this weekend in Oregon
places Stanford in a tie for second place in
conference play with Oregon. The teams
are one game behind Arizona (9-2).
