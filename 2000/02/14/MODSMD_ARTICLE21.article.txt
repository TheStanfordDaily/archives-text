Curt Foppefs 48 kills against
San Diego State Friday night not
only pushed him into a tie tor fifth
place on the Stanford all-time sin
gle match kills list, but also pro
pelled the No. 13 men's volleyball
team (4-6, 4-4 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) to its first win in
six matches.
Saturday's 3-0 victory over L'C-
San Diego (3-7, 0-7) notched an
other tally in the win category for
the Cardinal, bringing the squad
hack to .500 in conference matches,
l lie successful weekend left the
team with its first two road wins
and much-needed confidence after
three weeks of a frustrating winless
streak.
Because of junior middle block
er Brett Youngberg's struggle with
a recurring back injury and be
cause the starting lineup has been
faltering in the past few matches,
head coach Ruben Nieves decided
it was time to make a change. He
seems to have found a winning
combination.
Freshman Kyle Strache and
redshiit freslunan Jon Palacios
took on the roles of starting middle
blockers while redshiit freshman
Seth Ring took on the position as
libero and freshman Billy Strick
land came off the bench to start at
outside hitter for the first time this
season.
Friday night Stanford battled
the A/tecs through four games be
fore clinching a 15-4, 12-15, 15-10,
15-11 victory. I he first game start
ed out competitive and the Cardi
nal had only established a 4-2 lead
20 minutes into the match, lint just
15 minutes later Stanford had
taken over and closed out the
game.
"As soon as we won the first
game, we realized we could win,"
Toppel said. "Instead of playing
not to lose, we were playing to win.
We relaxed and played volleyball
like we know how."
For the Cardinal, game two was
marred by play reminiscent of
weekends past. Although the
squad overcame a six-point deficit
to tie up the game at 12-12. it start
ed giving up stretches of points, a
problem that has plagued the team
all season. After game two, howev
er, Stanford abandoned its old
ways and never allowed its oppo
nents to go on a run of more than
two points for the remainder of the
weekend.
Stanford went on to dominate
games three and four to capture
the win. loppel's record perfor
mance puts liim atop the country
foi kills in a single match and his
season total of 306 kills strengthens
his reign as the leader in the nation
for kills.
"Josh [Lukens] and 1 started
connecting a little better," Toppel
said of his near-flawless perfor
mance. "His sets were right where I
wanted them. I was hitting a lot
higher, so I was able to put the ball
in places where the defense wasn't."
Behind Toppel, three other
Stanford players finished in double
digits for kills including sophomore

outside hitter Marcus Skacel (16),
while Youngberg and Strickland
posted 11 apiece. Junior setter Josh
Lukens recorded a season-high 89
assists and a team high 11 digs,
while Skacel was second with 10
digs.
For the second time this season,
Stanlbrd outblocked its opponents,
16-9. Head coach Ruben Nieves
credited much of the team's bloc k
ing success to Strickland, who,
though new to the starting lineup,
recorded five blocks on the night.
In the libero position for the first
time (bis season redshirt freshman

King had a good night.
"Seth is our toughest competi
tor, which is a nice quality to have as
libero," Nieves said. "He bent a little
but didn't break. 1 have as much
confidence in Seth as anyone on the
team in his ability to come back and
play after making errors."
On Saturday, Stanford breezed
by the UC-San Diego Tritons 15-
11, 15-7, 15-2, without the help of a
powerful portion of its offense,
Youngberg and Toppel.
"We were a very young team but
we played real steady and didn't get
frustrated," Lukens said of Satur

day's lineup. "Our depth really
showed through [freshman outside
hitter] Will Curtis and Jon Palacios.
They stepped up and really showed
how integral our bench is."
Despite a slow start that left the
Cardinal trailing 3-8 in game one,
Curtis adjusted by the end of game
one and helped Stanford close out
the game.
"Josh Lukens did a nice job con
tinuing to give [Curtis] swings and
work through a slow start," Nieves
said. "[Curtis] got hot toward the
end of the game and was a major
factor in us coming back to win."

After turning around game one,
Stanford took off and didn't look
back, allowing the Tritons only nine
more points for the night. And un
like last weekend when Stanford
watched a 10-1 lead over Ball State
turn into a 10-15 loss, the Cardinal
maintained its dominating lead to
end out the match.
"Now that we've won, hopefully
we'll continue to keep winning,"
Toppel said. "We're getting a new
start, a lot of the hard times are be
hind us. Hopefully the confidence
we got from this weekend will carry
over and we'll be able to do well."

King had a good night.
"Seth is our toughest competi
tor, which is a nice quality to have as
libero," Nieves said. "He bent a little
but didn't break. 1 have as much
confidence in Seth as anyone on the
team in his ability to come back and
play after making errors."
On Saturday, Stanford breezed
by the UC-San Diego Tritons 15-
11, 15-7, 15-2, without the help of a
powerful portion of its offense,
Youngberg and Toppel.
"We were a very young team but
we played real steady and didn't get
frustrated," Lukens said of Satur

day's lineup. "Our depth really
showed through [freshman outside
hitter] Will Curtis and Jon Palacios.
They stepped up and really showed
how integral our bench is."
Despite a slow start that left the
Cardinal trailing 3-8 in game one,
Curtis adjusted by the end of game
one and helped Stanford close out
the game.
"Josh Lukens did a nice job con
tinuing to give [Curtis] swings and
work through a slow start," Nieves
said. "[Curtis] got hot toward the
end of the game and was a major
factor in us coming back to win."

After turning around game one,
Stanford took off and didn't look
back, allowing the Tritons only nine
more points for the night. And un
like last weekend when Stanford
watched a 10-1 lead over Ball State
turn into a 10-15 loss, the Cardinal
maintained its dominating lead to
end out the match.
"Now that we've won, hopefully
we'll continue to keep winning,"
Toppel said. "We're getting a new
start, a lot of the hard times are be
hind us. Hopefully the confidence
we got from this weekend will carry
over and we'll be able to do well."
