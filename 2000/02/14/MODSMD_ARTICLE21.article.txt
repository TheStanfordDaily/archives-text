Curt Foppefs 48 kills against
San Diego State Friday night not
only pushed him into a tie tor fifth
place on the Stanford all-time sin
gle match kills list, but also pro
pelled the No. 13 men's volleyball
team (4-6, 4-4 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) to its first win in
six matches.
Saturday's 3-0 victory over L'C-
San Diego (3-7, 0-7) notched an
other tally in the win category for
the Cardinal, bringing the squad
hack to .500 in conference matches,
l lie successful weekend left the
team with its first two road wins
and much-needed confidence after
three weeks of a frustrating winless
streak.
Because of junior middle block
er Brett Youngberg's struggle with
a recurring back injury and be
cause the starting lineup has been
faltering in the past few matches,
head coach Ruben Nieves decided
it was time to make a change. He
seems to have found a winning
combination.
Freshman Kyle Strache and
redshiit freslunan Jon Palacios
took on the roles of starting middle
blockers while redshiit freshman
Seth Ring took on the position as
libero and freshman Billy Strick
land came off the bench to start at
outside hitter for the first time this
season.
Friday night Stanford battled
the A/tecs through four games be
fore clinching a 15-4, 12-15, 15-10,
15-11 victory. I he first game start
ed out competitive and the Cardi
nal had only established a 4-2 lead
20 minutes into the match, lint just
15 minutes later Stanford had
taken over and closed out the
game.
"As soon as we won the first
game, we realized we could win,"
Toppel said. "Instead of playing
not to lose, we were playing to win.
We relaxed and played volleyball
like we know how."
For the Cardinal, game two was
marred by play reminiscent of
weekends past. Although the
squad overcame a six-point deficit
to tie up the game at 12-12. it start
ed giving up stretches of points, a
problem that has plagued the team
all season. After game two, howev
er, Stanford abandoned its old
ways and never allowed its oppo
nents to go on a run of more than
two points for the remainder of the
weekend.
Stanford went on to dominate
games three and four to capture
the win. loppel's record perfor
mance puts liim atop the country
foi kills in a single match and his
season total of 306 kills strengthens
