# The 						Faces of a Phenom
## Casey Jacobsen is as good as advertised 
### JIM TANKERSLEY EDITORIAL STAFF 
When the clock on the Maples Pavilion
scoreboard ticks down to a minute before
game time, Casey Jacobsen stops shooting
and drifts down to the baseline under the
Stanford basket.
For one minute, he ignores his teammates,
ignores his coaches, ignores the C )regon State
players warming up on the other end of the
court, and slowly pans the crowd with wide
eyes.
For one minute, he is not Casey Jacobsen

the scorer, or Case) Jacobsen the trash-talk
er, or even Casey Jacobsen the sin skate
boarder. I fe is just a young man in a basket -
ball uniform, staring at his sin roundings like
a five-year-old on his first trip to I ovs U Is.
"I just like to take that minute," lie says of
the ritual he performs before even game,
"and say, 'look where you are.' "
A briefreview of where he is: second-high

since Jan. 13 who leads the (lardinal in scoi

Stanford's play this season has
earned die team a No. 2 ranking
and contender status for a national
title. The team looks even better
than last year's Pac-10 champi
onship group, and many foes say
Jacobsen is the difference.
"He's the reason they're im
proved," Oregon State coach
Eddie Payne said Saturday after
Stanford ambushed the Beavers
82-56 at Maples.
A tremendous shooter ("his
range starts when he crosses half
court," Cardinal senior guard
David Moseley said), Jacobsen
showed Saturday why he is a pure
scorer.
Stymied on the perimeter most
of the first half by an Oregon State
defense that held him to just 1 of 8
field goal shooting, Jacobsen
began taking the ball to the hoop.
Persistence pays: His drives led
him to 14 shots from the foul line,
and he finished with 13 points.
That's a lesson Jacobsen learned
early in life. Growing up in a fami
ly where basketball came first — his
father played at San Diego State
and two older brothers starred at
San Diego and Pacific — he spent
years practicing religiously on a

Southern California backyard
court shaded by fruit and avocado
trees.
He played four years of varsity
ball at Glendora High School (ca
reer points: 3,284) and traveled
around the world with two USA ju
nior national teams.
"It's hard for me to believe," J a
cobsen said, "that anyone on the
floor has played more basketball
than me."
Experience brings with it the
maturity and consistency that
teammates say characterizes Jacob
sen's game. "He's really steady,"
said senior guard Alex Gelbard,
who typically spends practice
matched up with the freshman.
"He can score on you so many
ways, sometimes he makes your
head spin."
It also brings him confidence,
and to many observers, cockiness.
Jacobsen is an emotional player,
one not afraid to talk trash or play
to the crowd with his body lan
guage.
He tends to irk opposing fans,
who make him the Cardinal team's
most frequent target for taunts and
jeers. Jacobsen offers no apologies.
"I'm not afraid of showing my
emotions on the court,"he said,
"and when things are going good,
I let people know they're going in."
Teammates say he's a nice guy
and that he does a good job walk
ing the confidence-cockiness line.

"He doesn't have an ego," ju
nior point guard Mike McDonald
said, "and he loves to play de
fense."
More than earning respect, Ja
cobsen has proven himself to his
teammates and coaches — Mc-
Donald said he looks for the fresh
man to take big shots at the end of
tight games.
"He's a tough kid," Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said. "I
don't know that he's even really sat
there and thought about not suc
ceeding, or not being able to do
certain things. I think if you said he
couldn't, he'd probably just go and
work on it and try to prove you
were wrong."
Jacobsen admits it's sometimes
harder for him to succeed off the
court. Basketball is fun, he said,
and school is not. One sign that he
is a "normal" freshman: since com
ing to Stanford, he has struggled to
keep up with studies and sleep
(though most freshmen don't have
their trials with I-Hum chronicled
in Sports Illustrated, as he did
early in the season).
But life is not all books and bas
ketballs for Jacobsen, a man who
includes "dating" among his hob
bies in the Cardinal media guide.
He carries his 6-foot-6 frame
around campus on a long skate
board — "He's kind of a surfer
dude," Moseleysaid—and friends
say he attracts his share of female

fans.
"He tries to give off the impres
sion that he's kind of shy, but he's
not," McDonald said. "He likes to
hang out, he likes to dance. Casey
definitely has some rhythm."
The rhythm of the Stanford
Band blaring "All Right Now"

brings Jacobsen back to earth with
10 seconds left on the pregame
clock. He claps his hands once,
picks up a ball and tosses it at the
hoop. Then he jogs off toward the
bench.
Two hours later, he sits in the
locker room, mildly upset at his

performance. "I really lost my
poise in the first half," he says,-
shaking his head.
But he breaks into a smile when
asked il he'll be tired tonight.
"No way," he says. "I'm going
out."
