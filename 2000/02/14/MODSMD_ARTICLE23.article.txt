# Walk-on shines as Cardinal trounces Beavers
## 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's 82-56 victory Saturday after
noon against Oregon State provided an un
likely hero — senior walk-on Alex Gelbard.
Mark Madsen and Jarron Collins might
have both recorded double-doubles and the
consistently dominating Cardinal defense
might have held the Beavers to 27 percent
shooting in the second half, but it was Gel
bard who made the Pacific 10 Conference
game interesting.
Well after the Cardinal's ninth straight
win was firmly in hand and after many fans
had begun filing out of Maples Pavilion, the
future medical student went off, scoring five

points and recording his first-ever bloc kin
less than two frenzied minutes of play.
I lis buz/er-beating three-pointer ovei
two trash-talking defenders could be enough
to launch an inspirational inade-lor-1 V
movie. Just call it "Celby."
"We only have three more home games
left, and 1 don't know if I'll get a chance
again," he said. "1 thought it was pretty spe
cial to be out here in front ol the fans. I just
had to write a good closing chapter to the
Alex Gelbard story."
While Gelbard might have provided the
dramatics, it was the consistent workmanlike
effort of Madsen that truly set Stanford (21-
1, 10-1 I'ac-10) apart. The senior forward
recorded season highs in both points, 20,

and rebounds, 11. Mis seven offensive
boards helped the Cardinal to amass three
more offensive rebounds than the Beavers
(10-12, 2-9) pulled down on the defensive
end.
"Madsen was really good ;it getting to the
boards," said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "When he gets that way, it's
hard to match liis intensity."
Montgomery said he thought Madsen's
inspired play this weekend — he scored a
combined !H) points with 24 rebounds in the
two games — might have been spurred by
memories of his two games in Oregon in
which he put up only 12 points.
"He didn't play very well in the
Oregon series up there. I think he
remembered that and wanted to
redeem himself," Montgomery
said. "And any time a guy plays
that hard, it makes you feel bad it
you aren't playing the same way."
Madsen, always the first to de
flect attention from himself, said it
was Jarron Collins' intense play
that really got him into the game.
By halftime, Collins had already
scored 10 points and gotten to
four offensive rebounds.
"In the first half when jarron
went to the bench, I did want to
pick up the slack," Madsen said. " I
did try to tune up the intensity a
little bit."
But except for Madsen, it
seemed like many Stanford play
ers had trouble keeping up the in
tensity against an obviously over
matched Oregon State team.
While the Cardinal quickly ran
out to an 18-5 lead, the Beavers
were able to make a game of it for
a while, even without their top two
big men.
Both starter Clifton Jones and
Jason Heide, who started the
game on the bench nursing a
strained back, went to the bench
in the first three minutes of the
half with foul trouble. Jones
picked up two fouls in a minute of
play and Heide somehow man
aged to get called for three fouls in
only two minutes.
However, seldom-used senior
George von Backstrom did a nice
job of filling the middle for the
Beavers, picking up three points,
three rebounds, two assists and
two blocks in 17 minutes.
"This tends to get lost some
times because people don't give a
lot of credit to the Oregon States
out there," Montgomery said. "But
they were aggressive and they
came out hard and played well."
In the second half, the whole
Cardinal team finally seemed to
match that effort. Ten minutes
into the second half, the nine

point halftime lead was stretched
to 26.
With 15:30 remaining and the
score 48-35, Oregon State fol
lowed conventional wisdom and
tried to pressure Stanford to get
back into the game. But that plan
immediately backfired.
Freshman Casey Jacobsen, rel
ishing his new ball-handling role,
weaved his way around the back
court and pushed the ball to
David Moseley in the corner. His
open three-pointer pushed the
lead to 16.
Moments later, sophomore
point guard Tony Giovacchini
scored all of his five points on two
successive plays. First he rebound
ed a Beaver miss, sliced through
the lane and sank a running
jumper, then he hit a fastbreak
three-pointer to extend the lead
to 23.
The game lasted another ex
cruciating 10 minutes until Gel
bard re-energized Maples. But
even with 12 minutes left, the
game was already well over.
Gelbard's first score came from
flashy freshman Julius Barnes'
sweet behind-the-back pass. The
senior looked a little stunned by
the ball but calmly sank the easy
layup, giving the crowd its two fa
vorite things other than a Stan
ford win: a behind-the-back any
thing from Barnes and a bucket
by Gelbard.
Apparently Oregon State's
Josh Steinthal, who has struggled
against Stanford this year but ig
nited last season's upset of the
Cardinal, took exception to Gel
bard and began talking trash and
throwing elbows.
"1 was pretty pissed," said Gel
bard. "Then he came down and I
just had a feeling he was going to
shoot."
And just like that Gelbard set a
career high for blocked shots.
Then with three seconds left.
Stanford had the ball out of
bounds under the basket. Gelbard
was inbounding the ball and
planned to let the clock run out.
But again Steinthal began to
talk and press the inbounds pass.
So Gelbard passed it into Jarron

Collins, liis high school teammate
at Harrai d-West lake, and Collins
gave it right back. Gelbard
launched a fall-away, one-looted
rainbow over two defenders with
outstretched arms and prayed.

"I said, 'oh no, there goes my
shooting percentage,'" he said.
But the shot fell through and
Gelbard, perhaps in his final ap
pearance on a Stanford court, ran
off a happy man.

Cardinal, took exception to Gel
bard and began talking trash and
throwing elbows.
"1 was pretty pissed," said Gel
bard. "Then he came down and I
just had a feeling he was going to
shoot."
And just like that Gelbard set a
career high for blocked shots.
Then with three seconds left.
Stanford had the ball out of
bounds under the basket. Gelbard
was inbounding the ball and
planned to let the clock run out.
But again Steinthal began to
talk and press the inbounds pass.
So Gelbard passed it into Jarron

Collins, liis high school teammate
at Harrai d-West lake, and Collins
gave it right back. Gelbard
launched a fall-away, one-looted
rainbow over two defenders with
outstretched arms and prayed.

"I said, 'oh no, there goes my
shooting percentage,'" he said.
But the shot fell through and
Gelbard, perhaps in his final ap
pearance on a Stanford court, ran
off a happy man.

Senior Mark Madsen goes up for two of his game-high 20 points Saturday
in Stanford's 82-56 win over Oregon State.
Stanford's 82-56 victory Saturday after
noon against Oregon State provided an un
likely hero — senior walk-on Alex Gelbard.
Mark Madsen and Jarron Collins might
have both recorded double-doubles and the
consistently dominating Cardinal defense
might have held the Beavers to 27 percent
shooting in the second half, but it was Gel
bard who made the Pacific 10 Conference
game interesting.
Well after the Cardinal's ninth straight
win was firmly in hand and after many fans
had begun filing out of Maples Pavilion, the
future medical student went off, scoring five

points and recording his first-ever bloc kin
less than two frenzied minutes of play.
I lis buz/er-beating three-pointer ovei
two trash-talking defenders could be enough
to launch an inspirational inade-lor-1 V
movie. Just call it "Celby."
"We only have three more home games
left, and 1 don't know if I'll get a chance
again," he said. "1 thought it was pretty spe
cial to be out here in front ol the fans. I just
had to write a good closing chapter to the
Alex Gelbard story."
While Gelbard might have provided the
dramatics, it was the consistent workmanlike
effort of Madsen that truly set Stanford (21-
1, 10-1 I'ac-10) apart. The senior forward
recorded season highs in both points, 20,

and rebounds, 11. Mis seven offensive
boards helped the Cardinal to amass three
more offensive rebounds than the Beavers
(10-12, 2-9) pulled down on the defensive
end.
"Madsen was really good ;it getting to the
boards," said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "When he gets that way, it's
hard to match liis intensity."
Montgomery said he thought Madsen's
inspired play this weekend — he scored a
combined !H) points with 24 rebounds in the
two games — might have been spurred by
memories of his two games in Oregon in
which he put up only 12 points.
"He didn't play very well in the
Oregon series up there. I think he
remembered that and wanted to
redeem himself," Montgomery
said. "And any time a guy plays
that hard, it makes you feel bad it
you aren't playing the same way."
Madsen, always the first to de
flect attention from himself, said it
was Jarron Collins' intense play
that really got him into the game.
By halftime, Collins had already
scored 10 points and gotten to
four offensive rebounds.
"In the first half when jarron
went to the bench, I did want to
pick up the slack," Madsen said. " I
did try to tune up the intensity a
little bit."
But except for Madsen, it
seemed like many Stanford play
ers had trouble keeping up the in
tensity against an obviously over
matched Oregon State team.
While the Cardinal quickly ran
out to an 18-5 lead, the Beavers
were able to make a game of it for
a while, even without their top two
big men.
Both starter Clifton Jones and
Jason Heide, who started the
game on the bench nursing a
strained back, went to the bench
in the first three minutes of the
half with foul trouble. Jones
picked up two fouls in a minute of
play and Heide somehow man
aged to get called for three fouls in
only two minutes.
However, seldom-used senior
George von Backstrom did a nice
job of filling the middle for the
Beavers, picking up three points,
three rebounds, two assists and
two blocks in 17 minutes.
"This tends to get lost some
times because people don't give a
lot of credit to the Oregon States
out there," Montgomery said. "But
they were aggressive and they
came out hard and played well."
In the second half, the whole
Cardinal team finally seemed to
match that effort. Ten minutes
into the second half, the nine

point halftime lead was stretched
to 26.
With 15:30 remaining and the
score 48-35, Oregon State fol
lowed conventional wisdom and
tried to pressure Stanford to get
back into the game. But that plan
immediately backfired.
Freshman Casey Jacobsen, rel
ishing his new ball-handling role,
weaved his way around the back
court and pushed the ball to
David Moseley in the corner. His
open three-pointer pushed the
lead to 16.
Moments later, sophomore
point guard Tony Giovacchini
scored all of his five points on two
successive plays. First he rebound
ed a Beaver miss, sliced through
the lane and sank a running
jumper, then he hit a fastbreak
three-pointer to extend the lead
to 23.
The game lasted another ex
cruciating 10 minutes until Gel
bard re-energized Maples. But
even with 12 minutes left, the
game was already well over.
Gelbard's first score came from
flashy freshman Julius Barnes'
sweet behind-the-back pass. The
senior looked a little stunned by
the ball but calmly sank the easy
layup, giving the crowd its two fa
vorite things other than a Stan
ford win: a behind-the-back any
thing from Barnes and a bucket
by Gelbard.
Apparently Oregon State's
Josh Steinthal, who has struggled
against Stanford this year but ig
nited last season's upset of the
Cardinal, took exception to Gel
bard and began talking trash and
throwing elbows.
"1 was pretty pissed," said Gel
bard. "Then he came down and I
just had a feeling he was going to
shoot."
And just like that Gelbard set a
career high for blocked shots.
Then with three seconds left.
Stanford had the ball out of
bounds under the basket. Gelbard
was inbounding the ball and
planned to let the clock run out.
But again Steinthal began to
talk and press the inbounds pass.
So Gelbard passed it into Jarron

Collins, liis high school teammate

gave it right back. Gelbard
launched a fall-away, one-looted
rainbow over two defenders with
