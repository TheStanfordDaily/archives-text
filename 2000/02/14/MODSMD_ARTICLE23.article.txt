# Walk-on shines as Cardinal trounces Beavers
## 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's 82-56 victory Saturday after
noon against Oregon State provided an un
likely hero — senior walk-on Alex Gelbard.
Mark Madsen and Jarron Collins might
have both recorded double-doubles and the
consistently dominating Cardinal defense
might have held the Beavers to 27 percent
shooting in the second half, but it was Gel
bard who made the Pacific 10 Conference
game interesting.
Well after the Cardinal's ninth straight
win was firmly in hand and after many fans
had begun filing out of Maples Pavilion, the
future medical student went off, scoring five

points and recording his first-ever bloc kin
less than two frenzied minutes of play.
I lis buz/er-beating three-pointer ovei
two trash-talking defenders could be enough
to launch an inspirational inade-lor-1 V
movie. Just call it "Celby."
"We only have three more home games
left, and 1 don't know if I'll get a chance
again," he said. "1 thought it was pretty spe
cial to be out here in front ol the fans. I just
had to write a good closing chapter to the
Alex Gelbard story."
While Gelbard might have provided the
dramatics, it was the consistent workmanlike
effort of Madsen that truly set Stanford (21-
1, 10-1 I'ac-10) apart. The senior forward
recorded season highs in both points, 20,

and rebounds, 11. Mis seven offensive
boards helped the Cardinal to amass three
more offensive rebounds than the Beavers
(10-12, 2-9) pulled down on the defensive
end.
"Madsen was really good ;it getting to the
boards," said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "When he gets that way, it's
hard to match liis intensity."
Montgomery said he thought Madsen's
inspired play this weekend — he scored a
combined !H) points with 24 rebounds in the
two games — might have been spurred by
memories of his two games in Oregon in
which he put up only 12 points.
