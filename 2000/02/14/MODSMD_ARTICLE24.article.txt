Perhaps No. 1 Stanford (6-3)
was too consumed with avenging
last year's 13-inning College
World Series loss to No. 4 Florida
State (7-2), or maybe the Cardinal
was not focused enough on exact
ing revenge over the weekend in
Tallahassee, Fla.
Whatever the case, the Cardi
nal was out-pitched, out-hit and
simply out-played at Dick Howser
Stadium as it dropped two of
three games and will certainly
slide 112 rom the top spot in each of
the three major college baseball
polls.
The highly-lauded Stanford
pitching stalFs aura of invincibility
took a hit as the Seminoles un
leashed an offensive assault, tally
ing 30 runs in three games against
a team that had allowed just 14 in
its first six contests.
The first sign of trouble for the
(Cardinal came with one out in the
bottom of the first inning in Fri
day night's series opener. Head
coach Mark Marquess trotted to
the mound and motioned to his
bullpen, yanking No. 1 starter
Jason Young, a junior, who had
faced just four batters to that
point.
Soreness in his right shoulder
led to Young's exit, which opened
the door for an onslaught of Flori
da State hitting that lasted the en
tire weekend.
The Cardinal lineup tried to
compete in the slugfest, scoring
two runs in each of the first two in
nings, but Seminole junior Jon
McDonald settled down and held
it in check for the rest of his six in
nings. Freshman Daniel Hodges
picked up his first collegiate save
by limiting Stanford to just one hit
in the final three innings.
"McDonald got the ball up
early on and we had some cracks
at him," Marquess said. "Later in
the game, he started to get the ball
down and did a really nice job.
When you have the chance to get
to a pitcher like th.it, you had bet
ter do it early."
The Stanford bats stayed c<x>l
after Friday's second inning until
Saturday's contest, in which two
unlikely heroes provided fire
works in the 10th inning to break
a ()-() tie and give the Cardinal its
only win of the weekend.
junior Billy Jacobson and
sophomore Chris O'Riordan
smashed back-to-back home runs
to left and left-center field, ener
gizing the team and deflating the
raucous crowd of more than 4,000
tli.it was vocal and intimidating all
weekend. O'Riordan's homer was
the 112 irst hit of his Stanford career.
"They've worked hard, and
I'm happy for them," Marquess
said.
'"Fhe best part of it all was com
ing around third base and seeing
my teammates coining out to con
gratulate me," said Jacohson of his
game-winning homer.
Starter Justin Wayne did not
figure in the decision, leaving his
18-1 all-time record intact.
Four unearned runs crossed
the plate in the first, but Wayne ef
fectively diffused the powerful
Seminole lineup until his exit in
the seventh.
Sophomore Jeff Bruksch came
in and lasted the rest of the way, al
lowing the tying run in the seventh
but closing the door after Jacohson
and O'Riordan's lOth-inning
heroics.
The emotional win on Saturday
may have sapped the Cardinal of

its energy, for yesterday's series li
nale saw Stanford suffer a 13-1
embarrassment at the hands of
Florida State.
Stanford's starter, sophomore
Brian Sager, allowed five runs in
four-plus innings. His opponent,
junior Mike Ziegler, stymied the
Cardinal lineup in his third career
start.
Ziegler struck out 13 batters in
the game and made his only mis
take in the top of the third, allow
ing a light field solo home run to
senior catcher Damien Alvarado.
1 lie top five spots in the Stan
lord lineup, laced with experi
enced and talented hitters, could
not solve Ziegler nor the rest of the
Seminole stall, going 0-for-20 with
11 strikeouts.
I he Cardinal could never get a
rally going and struggled at the

plate all game.
The hottest bat in college base
ball is that of Florida State sopho
more John-Ford Griffin, who im
proved his batting average to .f)2B
over the weekend.
Criflin lit up every Cardinal
pitcher he faced, going 10-fbr-15
iu the series with four doubles, a
triple, four RBIs and lour runs
scored.
He also continued a 14-game
hitting streak that he began at the
end of last season.
Criffin will most likely receive
college baseball player of the week
honors for the weekend perfor
mance.
A glimmer of hope for the (car
dinal came in the top of the eighth
down 6-1. Stanford loaded the
bases with two outs and pinch-hit
for freshman designated hitter

Jason Cooper.
Fellow freshman Ryan Garko,
who had yet to collect a hit in his
first six collegiate at-bats, drove a
hall deep to right-center field that
was caught in spectacular fashion
by the Florida State center fielder,
junior Karl Jernigan. Jernigan
dove at the warning track to end
the threat in the eighth and keep
Garko hit less in his short Stanford
career.
With its spii its somewhat deflat
ed after leaving three men on base,
Stanford allowed Florida State a
seven-run inning on seven hits to
put the game well out of reach.
Ihe Cardinal does not have
much time to dwell on its lacklus
ter performance at Tallahassee as
it hosts another tough opponent,
No. 11 Texas, for a three-game set
at home beginning Friday.
