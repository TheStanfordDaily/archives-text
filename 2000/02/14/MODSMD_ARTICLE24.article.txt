Perhaps No. 1 Stanford (6-3)
was too consumed with avenging
last year's 13-inning College
World Series loss to No. 4 Florida
State (7-2), or maybe the Cardinal
was not focused enough on exact
ing revenge over the weekend in
Tallahassee, Fla.
Whatever the case, the Cardi
nal was out-pitched, out-hit and
simply out-played at Dick Howser
Stadium as it dropped two of
three games and will certainly
slide 112 rom the top spot in each of
the three major college baseball
polls.
The highly-lauded Stanford
pitching stalFs aura of invincibility
took a hit as the Seminoles un
leashed an offensive assault, tally
ing 30 runs in three games against
a team that had allowed just 14 in
its first six contests.
The first sign of trouble for the
(Cardinal came with one out in the
bottom of the first inning in Fri
day night's series opener. Head
coach Mark Marquess trotted to
the mound and motioned to his
bullpen, yanking No. 1 starter
Jason Young, a junior, who had
faced just four batters to that
point.
Soreness in his right shoulder
led to Young's exit, which opened
the door for an onslaught of Flori
da State hitting that lasted the en
tire weekend.
The Cardinal lineup tried to
compete in the slugfest, scoring
two runs in each of the first two in
nings, but Seminole junior Jon
McDonald settled down and held
it in check for the rest of his six in
nings. Freshman Daniel Hodges
picked up his first collegiate save
by limiting Stanford to just one hit
in the final three innings.
"McDonald got the ball up
early on and we had some cracks
at him," Marquess said. "Later in
the game, he started to get the ball
down and did a really nice job.
When you have the chance to get
to a pitcher like th.it, you had bet
ter do it early."
The Stanford bats stayed c<x>l
after Friday's second inning until
Saturday's contest, in which two
unlikely heroes provided fire
works in the 10th inning to break
a ()-() tie and give the Cardinal its
only win of the weekend.

sophomore Chris O'Riordan

weekend. O'Riordan's homer was
the 112 irst hit of his Stanford career.
"They've worked hard, and
I'm happy for them," Marquess
said.
