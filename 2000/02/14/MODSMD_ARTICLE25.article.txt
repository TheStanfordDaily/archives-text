## Women win in the rain; Pac-10 championships up next 
### MAREN EWERS 
The third-ranked Stanford
swimming and diving team (6-1)
defeated No. 4 California (8-2) at
deGuerre Pool on Saturday to up
hold a 25-year winning tradition.
Stanford has now won 25 of its
27 dual meets against the Bears.
"I was relieved that we won the
meet," said former swimmer
Michelle Collins, Class of 1998,
who sat in the stands. "It was very
nerve-w rat king to have to watch
our girls battle the Bears and not
be able to contribute. But I'm
proud of the team."
With the help of the numerous
alumni, parents and fans that came
out for the rainy afternoon, Stan
ford was able to secure the win
(153-146) in an exciting final strug
gle between the bitter rivals and
break three pool records in the
process.
In its victory-clenching final ef
fort, the Cardinal broke a
deGuerre pool record, winning
the 400 freestyle relay by more
than a second (3:21.60).
Averaging 50.4 seconds per leg,
junior Misty Hyman, junior Siob
han Cropper, sophomore Sylvia
Bereknei and senior co-captain
Catherine Fox cruised to the victo
ry-
"lt was an awesome race,"
Hyman said of the final event."It
was fun to have the meet come
down to the final few minutes."
The Cardinal got off to a slow
start at the beginning of the meet,
placing second to Cal in the 400
medley relay in a time of 3:43.24.
However, the team quickly
found its speed as three Stanford
women won the next three events
in a row.
Sophomore Jessica Foschi took
first in the 1,000 freestyle
(10:07.57). Then Hyman secured
the victory in the 200 free (1:48.1 1)
while Foschi turned in a re
spectable third-place finish.
The winning trio was complet-

Ed by Fox's decisive win in the 100
backstroke (54.52). Sophomore
Shelly Ripple was a close second
place finish in that event (54.61).
Both women achieved NCAA au
tomatic qualifying times for their
swims.
Stanford lost momentum its the
Cal squad nearly swept the 100
breaststroke, placing first, second,
fourth and fifth. Cal went on to
sweep the 200 breastroke later in
the meet.
Again, the (Cardinal was quick to
recover. Hyman won the 200 but
terfly in a NCAA automatic stan
dard (1:58.04) time. Following
Hyman's lead, Cropper and Fox
pulled away from the competition
in the 50 freestyle, placing first and
second (23.31 and 23.32, respec
tively).
Foschi returned towards the
end of the meet to dominate the
second distance event, the 500
freestyle (4:50.46).
Ripple then placed first in the
200 backstroke (1:58.55). Her
teammates Alexis Oakland and
Sarah Umetsu placed fifth and
sixth.
Hyman said she felt positive
about the meet's outcome. "It was
not a completely successful meet,"
she said. "The team had ups and
downs, but to be able to come out
with the victory was good for us. It
shows us what we need to do to
prepare for the Pacific 10 Confer
ence championships."
The Stanford diving power
house was a major factor in the
Cardinal's victory.
The divers swept the three
meter event as junior Kim Powers
(201.55), freshman McKense Mur
phy (195.35) and junior Erin
Sones (178.50) placed first, second
and third.
Stanford's diving superiority
was also apparent in the one-meter
diving event.
Sones led the team to victory
(181.55). Murphy turned in a sec
ond-place finish (168.70). Powers
placed fourth in the event
(164.65).
"I was pretty happy with our
performance today," Powers said.
"We wanted to do everything we
could to help the swimmers, and I

think we did that."
The team will now set its sights
on the Pac-10 championships,
which take place Feb. 24-26 in
Long Beach. The Cardinal will
spend the next two weeks in
preparation for the meet and will
have a rematch of sorts with Cali
fornia.
This time, however, the stakes
will be different.
The format of the meet is pre
lim-final, and Stanford will be

competing against 10 teams in
stead of one. Additionally, the
Stanford team has won the Pac-10
championship each year since its
inception 12 years ago and would
like to uphold its winning tradi
tion.
"I think this weekend put us in
a good position for Pac-l()s,"
Hyman said. "The competition
will be fierce, but we are all excited
and ready to take on Cal and the
rest of the Pac-10 conference."
