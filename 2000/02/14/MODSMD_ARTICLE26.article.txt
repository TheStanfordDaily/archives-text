# Men's tennis goes indoors for win
## 'Shortened' match lasts six hours 
### SAMEER AHMED CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Tennis in the rain? It seems
like an oxymoron. But with the
addition of the indoor court at
the I aube Family Tennis (Center,
the No. 2 Stanford men's tennis
team (2-0) was able to play one of
its two scheduled matches this
weekend, defeating Georgia
lech (1-2), 4-0 Saturday after
noon.
For a shortened match — the
teams played only four singles
matches before Stanford secured
the victory — it wasn't very short.
Play began at 1 p.m. and didn't
end until 6:45 p.m.
The Cardinal and the Yellow
Jackets, who met last year in the
second round of the NCAA tour
nament, were forced to play one
match at a time indoors because
of the rain. Yet, this did not hin
der Stanford's progress, with the
team winning all four singles
matches without losing a set.
"Everybody did a good job in
the four matches that took
place," associate coach John
Whitlinger said. "Sometimes it's
difficult when the players don't
know when and if they're going
to play, but I think all the guys
were well prepared for their
matches."
Playing at No. 1 singles for the
first time this season, junior Alex
Kim, ranked sixth in the nation,
recorded his team-leading 19th
victory of the season, cruising
past Georgia lech's Roman
Coirault, 6-1,6-1.
After Kim's victory, senior
Geoff Abrams, ranked fourth in
the nation, gave the Cardinal a 2-
0 lead with a 6-1, 6-4 win over
Roger Anderson at No. 2 singles.
At the No. 3 spot, junior Scot
ty Scott added to the Stanford
lead, defeating the Yellow Jack
ets' Robert Wright, 6-4,6-2.
And in the fourth and final
match of the day, freshman
David Martin sealed the Stanford
win with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over
Jason | eong.
Because Stanford captured
the required four points to se
cure the victory, the teams did
not play the final two singles
matches or any of the doubles
matches. Nevertheless, the No. 5
and No. 6 seeds lor the Cardinal,
junior Ali Ansari and freshman
Scott Lipsky, had to wait all day to
see if they were needed to play.
"1 felt bad for Ali Ansari and
Scott Lipsky," Whitlinger said.
"1 lowever, if we lost one of those
four matches, they'd better be
ready."
Usually, the teams complete

all nine matches, six singles and
three doubles, in collegiate ten
nis. However, due to the time
constraints playing on one in
door court, the coaches decided
to play until the first team won
four matches. I bis was probably
a good idea considering the
match lasted nearly six hours.
"If the teams continued to
play all of the matches, we might
have been here until midnight,"
Whitlinger said.
So far this year, Stanford's
competition in team play has not
been very challenging for the
Cardinal. In its two dual matches
this season against Hawaii and
Georgia Tech, the Cardinal has
not lost a match and has lost only
one set.
In addition, the team has been
playing without its top player,
sophomore K.J. Hippensteel,
who is out indefinitely with a case
of mononucleosis. When Hip
pensteel, the No. I player in the
country, returns, Stanford's op
position will have even more dif
ficulty trying to beat the Cardi
nal.
At least Stanford and Georgia
lech were able to play at all this
weekend. On Friday, the Cardi
nal's match against San Diego
State (0-0) was canceled because
of the rain. The match will not be
rescheduled.
Why didn't Stanford and San
Diego State play their match in
doors? Because of the hard rain
on Friday afternoon, the indoor
court's roof was leaking, leaving
three puddles on the tennis
court. Because of the puddles,
the teams decided that the in
door court was not safe for com
petition.
While the current Stanford
players didn't play on Friday,
some of their former teammates
did at the Sybase Open in San
Jose. Paul Goldstein, a four-time
Ail-American for the Cardinal
from 1995-1998, reached the
quarterfinals of the tournament
before losing to Jim Courier, a
former No. 1 player in the world.
Two of Goldstein's college
teammates performed even bet
ter in doubles. Mike and Bob
Bryan, who left Stanford in 1998
to go pro, reached the semifinals
by upsetting the first seed Todd
Woodbridge and Mark Wood
forde, currently the No. 8 dou
bles team in the world. The
Bryan brothers eventually lost in
the semifinals on Saturday.
The Cardinal will begin its
Pac-10 season next weekend with
matches against Washington on
February 18 at 1:30 p.m. and
Oregon the following day at
noon.
Rain also canceled two match
es for the Stanford women's team
this weekend.
