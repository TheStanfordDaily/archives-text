### EILEEN CHAO CHRIS DRAKE CONTRIBUTING WRITERS 
A month after nominations
closed, the search for University
President Gerhard Casper's suc
cessor has been narrowed to about
40 candidates, according to chair
of the Presidential Search Com
mitteejim Ukropina.
Researching applicants
"We received about 400 names
of (people) who were nominated
for the job," along with a couple of
self-nominations, Ukropina said.
As of now, the "list (has been) nar
rowed down to 40," he said.
Ukropina noted that "(the Com
mittee is) doing further research
on these 40, (hoping to) interview
about 10 prospects." He said the
interviews will occur over the next
few months, ultimately narrowing
the field down to five.
At this point in the search,
Ukropina said, the committee can
make public only limited informa
tion about the candidates.
"The need for confidentiality is
absolutely singular in its impor
tance. If we didn't (keep informa
tion about the candidates private),
we might lose some of our very top
prospects," he said.
Deputy Chair of the committee
John Etchemendy, professor of
philosophy, said that the commit

tee is striving to find the most qual
ified individual, regardless of aca
demic background.
"It's far too early to (make that
kind of judgement)," said
Etchemendy. "In any event, we
wouldn't decide on a certain type
of person. We're looking for the
best person and you won't get the
best person if you exclude great
amounts of people. It just
wouldn't be the sensible way to
proceed."
Committee member Kaleb
Michaud, a doctoral student in
physics, said that they have not de
cided on anything yet and are
"considering everyone on their
own criteria."
The 17-member committee is
still in the difficult process of re
searching applicants. Sometimes
they have nothing more to go by
than a name.
"We are gathering information
either by the Web or through the
library," Etchemendy said. "We're
building files on all the nominees.
It takes massive amounts of time."
Ukropina said that the list of
top applicants could "expand or
contract a bit," depending on the
committee's further research on
the candidates.
Toward the conclusion of the
search, Ukropina said, the com
mittee will recommend one of the
five remaining candidates to the
