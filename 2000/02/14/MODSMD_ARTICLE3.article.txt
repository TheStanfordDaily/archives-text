# Presidential search continues
## Committee narrows down candidates 
### EILEEN CHAO CHRIS DRAKE CONTRIBUTING WRITERS 
A month after nominations
closed, the search for University
President Gerhard Casper's suc
cessor has been narrowed to about
40 candidates, according to chair
of the Presidential Search Com
mitteejim Ukropina.
Researching applicants
"We received about 400 names
of (people) who were nominated
for the job," along with a couple of
self-nominations, Ukropina said.
As of now, the "list (has been) nar
rowed down to 40," he said.
Ukropina noted that "(the Com
mittee is) doing further research
on these 40, (hoping to) interview
about 10 prospects." He said the
interviews will occur over the next
few months, ultimately narrowing
the field down to five.
At this point in the search,
Ukropina said, the committee can
make public only limited informa
tion about the candidates.
"The need for confidentiality is
absolutely singular in its impor
tance. If we didn't (keep informa
tion about the candidates private),
we might lose some of our very top
prospects," he said.
Deputy Chair of the committee
John Etchemendy, professor of
philosophy, said that the commit

tee is striving to find the most qual
ified individual, regardless of aca
demic background.
"It's far too early to (make that
kind of judgement)," said
Etchemendy. "In any event, we
wouldn't decide on a certain type
of person. We're looking for the
best person and you won't get the
best person if you exclude great
amounts of people. It just
wouldn't be the sensible way to
proceed."
Committee member Kaleb
Michaud, a doctoral student in
physics, said that they have not de
cided on anything yet and are
"considering everyone on their
own criteria."
The 17-member committee is
still in the difficult process of re
searching applicants. Sometimes
they have nothing more to go by
than a name.
"We are gathering information
either by the Web or through the
library," Etchemendy said. "We're
building files on all the nominees.
It takes massive amounts of time."
Ukropina said that the list of
top applicants could "expand or
contract a bit," depending on the
committee's further research on
the candidates.
Toward the conclusion of the
search, Ukropina said, the com
mittee will recommend one of the
five remaining candidates to the
Board of Trustees. He said this
process might take a number of
months, but the committee is "on
track to coinpleie (its work) by the
end of the academic year."
While "difficult decisions" con
front the committee, Ukropina
said, "the review process is a chal
lenging but rewarding task, be
cause we have a group of top
prospects."
In addition to formal criteria,
the committee is also turning to
people inside and outside of Stan
ford, including heads of large
foundations, to ask for advice, ac
cording to Etchemendy.
Committee member Donna
Lawrence, division director in the
Office of Development, stressed
that student opinion is very im
portant to the committee. A stu
dent forum was held last month to
give students a chance to voice
their thoughts on the issue.
"If people have any informa
tion they'd like to bring to the
committee, they're definitely wel
come," she said. "We're trying to
get as much input as we can, and
we're interested in hearing what
people have to say. (If) students

weren't able to make it to the
forum .. . we'd be happy to hear
from them."
Heading the search
The committee, formed last
November, consists of chairman
Ukropina and 16 others from the
Stanford community.
Ukropina currently is a partner
in the Los Angeles law firm O'Mel
veny 8c Myers. He graduated from
Stanford with a history degree in
1959 and earned an MBA at Stan
find in 1961.
Over the years, Ukropina has
made a variety of contributions to
Stanford, including playing foot
ball as an undergraduate and,
more recently, serving eight years
as a member of the Board of
Trustees. In addition to his in
volvement with Stanford,
Ukropina has served on the
boards of five or six major compa
nies, including Lockheed Martin's

Board of Directors.
Seven trustees serve on the
committee, along with six faculty
members. Two students, Michaud
and senior Kristin Torres, an in
ternational relations major, serve
on the committee as well. Warren
Lyons, Stanford alumnus and
(^hief'Financial ()fficer at Stanford
Hospital, rounds out the group of
sixteen.
Although there are no restric
tions on types of people for the job,
there are several criteria the com
mittee is using to judge the nomi
nees.
"We have quite an extensive list
of criteria," Etchemendy said.
"The person needs to have vari
ous qualities such as an apprecia
tion for the core academic mission
of the University, including both
teaching and research lor under
grad and grad areas, absolute im
peccable integrity and ability to
manage very large and complex
institutions."
