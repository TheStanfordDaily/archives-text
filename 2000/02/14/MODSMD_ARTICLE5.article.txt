# Stanford computers used in Web attacks
## Hackers reach marine station 
### ALICE BROWN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Investigators have discovered
that some of the computers used
by hackers to attack popular Web
sites last week belonged to Stan
ford's Monterey marine research
center.
According to the Cable News
Network Web site, CNN.com,
Stephen Hansen, Stanford's
head of computer security, said
that about 50 Stanford comput
ers were "fooled into helping
route the denial of service attacks
on Web sites, including
eßay.com, CNN.com, Buy.com
and Yahoo!"
In a denial of senice attack,
computers — sometimes called
"zombie" computers — send
commands to high-capacity com
puters that dump millions of mes
sages into the targeted Web site.
Such commands result in blocked
access. In this case, Stanford's
computers were some of the
"zombies."
CNN.com reported that "this
kind of hack floods a Web site with
so many requests it can't cope."

Hansen told CNN that a net
work engineer was on the scene
within three minutes. "He went
into the configuration and said
'Ok, turn that off, don't allow
them to do that anymore.' Any
time from that point on, any of
those packets that arrived were
ignored. I'm glad we were able to
find it quickly and were able to
deal with it in short order."
Stanford was not the only uni
versity to have its computer sys
tems abused. UC-Santa Barbara
was also a victim in the hacker at
tack.
According to CNN.com," Uni
versities can be sitting ducks to
these attacks, since schools want
professors, researchers and stu
dents to have easy access to com
puters to share research and
swap information."
T here is software available to
block hackers — known as a fire
wall — but unfortunately it re
stricts the academic freedom of
the 1 nternet by preventing schol
ars from gaining access.
CNN sources said that last
week's service denial hacks were
unsophisticated and were done
using "ready-made programs."
With such a great number of at
tacks, it is possible that at least one
will contain clues leading to an ar
rest.
