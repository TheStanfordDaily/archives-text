## 
### PAT CROSETTO 
I his past weekend, at the I-arie History Cor
ner, Congresswoman Davenport stood in front
of a class of students and lambasted Congress-

man Smith's
plan for Junior
ROTC funding.
At the same
time in the La
gunita Lounge,
Charles Moran
gave an oratory
about Califor
nia's dwindling
water supply.
And in a small
room in the Po
litical Science
building, a high
school freshman
gave a dramatic
interpretation
of "To Kill a
Mockingbird."
This might
seem like a con
fusing spectacle
to the average

viewer, hut it is actually a common late-winter
sight for Stanford students. More than 2,000
high-school students flooded campus this p;ist
weekend as part of the Stanford Debate Soci
ety's National Invitation Tournament.
For the past 15 years the debate society has
been running what is called one of the premier
debate tournaments in the nation, showcasing
some of the best high school talent in a myriad
of events.
Students from 160 schools 112 rom 15 states all
over the country packed in neighboring hotels

in order to compete at Stanford.
Shaun Matthews, a coach for Bergen field
High School in New Jersey, broughtone team
of two students across the country because "we
didn't have a tournament to go to this week-

end, and the Stanford tournament has a
unique Tournament of Champions we want
ed to qualify for."
One of the primary purposes of the tour
nament is to raise funds for the debate Soci
ety's traveling debate teams, since the club
does not get special fees from the ASSU.
According to sophomore Julian Wassenaar,
captain of Stanford's parliamentary debate
team, the society also runs t he invitational "to at
tract students to Stanford as a school and foster
interest in debate and intellectual growth."

The format of the tournament is very com
plex. There are two traditional debate for
mats, a mock Congress, and six individual
events.
Cross-ex or policy debate participants debat-

Ed the merits of
changing the
educational sys
tem in the Unit
ed States with
vouchers or
mandatory test
ing. High
schoolers could
participate in ei
ther a varsity
competition or
at the junior var
sity level.
The Stan
ford debate this
year was unique
because it of
fered a third
type of debate
for America's
budding politi
cians: a mock

Congress. Stu
dents were divided into the House and the Sen
ate and debated various bills pre-chosen by the
event's organizers.
During the alternating rounds between de
hate events, a number of individual events
were held. Some, such as the Oratory or Ex
temporary, relied on prepared remarks of up
to 10 minutes. Others, such as the Impromp
tu. Extemporaneous speech or Spar debates,
judged the ability of participants to think on
