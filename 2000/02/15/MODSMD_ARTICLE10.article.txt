# URO funds well-defined projects
## Deadline for students wishing to pursue spring projects approaching 
### ZACH DILLON 
As spring approaches, so does the deadline for
applying tor major grants from Stanford's Under
graduate Research Opportunities program.
I hrough this program, students can get funding for
independent research they would otherwise not be
able to carry out.
"It's a good source of support for students," said
senior Ramin Shadman, a human biology major
who received a small grant for his honors thesis on
the utilization ol the Internet for cancer patients' de
cision making. "Ii allowed me to explore a lot of is
sues I wouldn't otherwise have the resources or the
time to pursue."
Stanford's URO program receives funding from
a variety of sources including private donors, the
I nivcrsit) s (lentennial (lampaign and the Stanford
Fund.
"Vou shouldn't have to afford it to be able to do
research," said Laura Selznick, URO director. "We
have a way so that students on financial aid can get
their $1400 summer contribution [to their tuition]
replaced by a scholarship from the URO."
I he result is a program that gives all students the
chance lo pursue topics they find interesting that
they would otherwise not have the resources to re
search. Some students decide they want to look
deeper into ideas from particular c lasses, while oth
ers focus on topics relevant to areas of concentration
within I heir majors or issues relevant to their per
sonal backgrounds.
"They're all independently-created student
ideas," said Selznick, although she noted that many
projects in the sciences are tied to particular labora
tories because of equipment requirements or be
cause the research objectives sprang from ongoing
research in those labs.
1 .asi year, nearly 85 percent of those applying for
URO grants received them. The URO awarded 441
grants to 520 applicants, and total funding passed
.$054,000. However, those high numbers do not
mean that URO grants are easy to obtain.
"You need to convince a group of people who
might not necessarily know a whole lot about your
topic that what you want to examine is important to
the community as a whole," Shadman said. "It
makes you take your thesis and put it into perspec
tive: what am I
examining, and why is it important? It really forces
you to gel into
gear-to gel into contact with advisors and to trim
clown and really focus your thesis."
Although anyone can apply for a grant, only
those who have thoroughly considered their pro
jects will receive grant money. According to
Selznick, the URO awards funding to students who
have done careful planningand show that their pro
jects will further theii academic careers.
Selznick said thai the six most important ele
ments the office takes into account when consider
•»
ingan application are a well-defined research ques
tion, academic preparation in the field, planning
(including identification of important resources), a

thoughtful budget, the quality of faculty sponsor
ship and the student's transcript.
"The review of major grants involves initial
screening and ranking of projects within the indi
vidual departments," Selznick said. "Proposals are
usually reviewed by at least two sources-usually fac
ulty who know something about the field the project
is in and who know something about the project it
self."
In the case of interdisciplinary projects, the pro
posal is reviewed by people from each relevant de
partment. For example, if a student is majoring in
political science and doing a project focused more
on international relations, faculty from both depart
ments help with screening and ranking.
Selznick said the URO reviews transcripts only to
make sure that applicants are in good academic
standing. "We are not looking for a straight 'A' aver
age," she said. "We're looking lor holes in the Iran
scripts .... to make sure there are no incompletes."
According to Selznick, the research projects rely
much more on students' own initiative than does
classwork. If there are a number of outstanding in
completes in an applicant's record, reviewers must
consider whether that student will be* able to com
plete a project in a more unstructured setting.
Most major grants are awarded to juniors who
plan to pursue an honors thesis during their senior
year. Because the grants are open to any Stanford
undergraduate, freshmen and sophomores can still
apply. However, the URO encourages them to
apply with caution.
"When we have freshmen and sophomores ap
plying for major grants, we usually give them what
we call the 'freshman/sophomore warning'," said
Selznick. "Be careful what you wish for because you
just might get it."
Once a student receives one major grant, the
chances are slim that he or she will get a second. Al
though the URO program does not discriminate
based on c lass year, it reminds younger students that
they are competing with more academically ad
vanced applicants who have often put more thought
and planning into their research proposals.
"If a student is applying for a major grant, we ex
pect them to be pursuing an honors thesis," said
Selznick.
For younger students interested in doing inde
pendent research, the URO program offers the
Chappell-Lougee Scholarship, which is awarded to
sophomores who display an extraordinary potential
for achievement in the humanities and social sci
ences. The Chappell-Lougee Scholarship, like a
URO major grant, requires a minimum of three
quarters of research and offers up to $2500.
Students can use the funding for any number of
expenses, including the cost,of photocopies, plane
tickets, room and board, money to pay human sub
jects and other miscellaneous expenses.
"Students who apply give us a budget to let us
know how they intend to use the money," said
Selznick. "Then they bring us bank receipts after
wards."
The URO major grant deadline is March Ml for
research proposals in the social sciences, natural
sciences, engineering and interdisciplinary pro
jects. The deadline for major grants in humanities
and creative arts and for small grants in any area is
April 14.
