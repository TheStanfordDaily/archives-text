## U.S. meets with leaders in Colombia 
### 
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) —
As new figures showed a 20 per
cent rise in Colombian cocaine
production, a high-level U.S. del
egation met yesterday with lead
ers of this turbulent nation to dis
cuss a drug-fighting aid package.
The visit was led by Thomas
Pickering, the State Department's
third-ranking official. It came as
the U.S. Congress was opening
debate on the proposed two-year,
$1.6 billion aid package that
would dramatically escalate the
war on drugs in Colombia.
Primarily a military aid plan,
the package includes 63 heli
copters and the training and
equipping of two new army
counter-drug battalions. It aims
to give Colombia the firepower,
mobility and intelligence to
defeat leftist rebels who protect
drug crops.
The Andean country solidified
its place last year as the world's
principal source of cocaine,
according to new figures com
piled by the CIA. Cultivation of
coca, the drug's raw material,
increased 20 percent in Colombia
last year, the figures said.
Land used for the drug totaled
465 square miles, up from 393
square miles in 1998, according

Associated Press.
