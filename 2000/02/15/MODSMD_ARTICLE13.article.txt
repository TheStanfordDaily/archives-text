JERUSALEM (AP) — Behind
the-scenes contacts through
France apparently are under way
to try to restart Israeli-Syrian
peace talks that could end the
guerrilla war in Lebanon.
Israel's Foreign Ministry Direc
tor-General Eitan Bentsur was in
Paris over the weekend for talks
with French diplomats, a Foreign
Ministry official said on condition
of anonymity.
The official would not say what
the substance of the talks was. But
Israel uses secret talks with
France, which has close contacts
with Syria and Lebanon, to deliv
er messages to both Arab nations.
Israel's army radio reported
that French diplomats passed a
message to Israel indicating that
Syria is interested in restarting
peace talks, which fizzled in Jan
uary after two rounds in the Unit
ed States.
However, Foreign Minister
David Levy denied that such con
tacts had taken place and warned
Syria against encouraging
Hezbollah guerrilla attacks that
have killed seven Israeli soldiers
in just over two weeks.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister
Ehud Barak countered criticism
that he has been too soft on the
guerrillas by saying that hundreds
of thousands of Lebanese civilians
sit in the dark because of airstrikes
he ordered against various power
stations.
"Hundreds of thousands of
people in Lebanon today, when it
gets dark outside, have no elec
tricity and they will not have
proper electricity for months,"
Barak said.
Barak was hoping Syria, the
main power broker in Lebanon,
would restrain Hezbollah guerril
las during peace negotiations, but
the violence has escalated since
talks broke off'last month.
While he warned that his mili
tary would strike again if military
casualties mount, Barak also
appeared to be looking for a bal
ance — deterring Hezbollah
attacks but keeping the prospects
for peace talks with Syria alive.
