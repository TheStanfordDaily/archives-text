v LI TTLE TON, Colo. (AP) — Two
Columbine I ligh sweethearts were found
dead early yesterday after a shooting at a
sandwich shop within sight of their
school, compounding the heartbreak in
the community that suffered the worst
school shooting in U.S. history.
l he bodies of Nicholas Kunselman,
I j, and Stephanie Hart, 16, were discov
ered inside the Subway shop where Kun
selman worked. Investigators did not dis
close a motive but ruled out a murder

suicide.
Jeflerson County sheriffs spokesman
Steve Davis said the cause of death had
not been determined, and lie said he did
not know whether a weapon had been
found.
Investigators were reviewing a video
tape from a surveillance camera inside
the restaurant.
"I hope it was just a robbery," said one
of Kunselinan's co-workers, J.J. Hodack,
22. "I've had more than enough of this.

I his stuff needs to stop."
I he shooting was the latest in a siring
of tragedies that have hit the Denver sub
urb since teen-age gunmen Kric Harris
.md Dylan klcbold killed 12 students and
a teacher at Columbine on April 20 and
then committed suicide.
Classes remained in session vestcrdav,
but at least 100 students stayed away.
Students said some of those who did
attend could be seen crying in the ball
ways. At least 25 counselors were kept

luisv most ol the dav, said Betty I itz
patrick, health services director for the
sch<><>l (listi ict.
"Ii reminds me of evcrvthing. It's just
like flashbacks," said Nathan Vanderau,
an 18-year-old senior who knew some of
the victims of last year's shooting as well
as vesterday's victims and is in counseling.
Among the other incidents that have
added to the unease in the community:
— In ()< tober, the mother of a student
partially paralyzed in the massacre shot

herself to death.
— On Feb. 1, the body of an 11-year
old boy was found in a trash bin within
blocks of the school. No arrests have been
made.
— Last week, a Florida man pleaded
guilty in Denver to sending a Columbine
student an Internet message threatening
to finish the massacre. The threat
prompted officials to close the school for
the Christinas holidays two days early. He
laces up to five years in prison.
