Willi 11 IK ASM "S Stan lord After Mid
night program coming under review
today, Dean ol Students Marc Waisand
other Stan lord administrators will aim
to evaluate the program's success and, in the pro
cess, determine its future.
Despite some initial skepticism, Stanford After
Midnight, ASSI President Mike Levin's effort to
keep ke\ vendors and departments open for stu
dent use aliet hours, h.is been largely successful.
Among those participating in the program, Levin
siies I residder Fitness, the (lollee I louse, the Tree
house (Ibrmerlv Polio Key) and the Ford Center as
some ol the most used facilities. Using figures sub
mitted l>\ the vendors and departments, adminis
trators will be evaluating each facility's relative suc
»ess 01 failure based on the number ol students that
have used it over the quarter.
(iiven that venues like I residder Fitness have
received a positive response from students (in the
lorin of increased business) since they extended

their hours, it remains unlikely that the administra
tive evaluation will threaten their After Midnight sta
tus. However, Levin admits, some participants have
had more success than others, making an evaluation
and subsequent re-adjustment necessary.
Although, according to Levin, the ASSU will rally
to keep all the venues open for as long as possible, it
seems most practical that only those participants that
have seen an increase in use or a shift of use to Alter
Midnight hours should continue with the program.
II students have chosen not to utilize certain After
Midnight services, that, too, ought to be considered
a statement on their part — namely that certain ser
vices are simply not useful to them after hours.
However, given that the program's prospects of
continuing remain good, attention must now shift to
improving it to better suit the needs of students.
Many students who have voiced their recom
mendations for the program say they would benefit
greatly from extended hours at Green Library.
Although Meyer Library will soon re-open with new

and improved 24-hour study rooms, among other
facilities, students would still like to set* both libraries
open to meet their late-night studying needs.
According to Levin, efforts were made to include
Green in the program this quarter, but staffing con
cerns kept the library from coming on board. Given
the positive response from students and the amount
of interest that already exists in using Green after
hours, getting Green to participate in the program
next quarter should be a top priority. Regardless of
what concerns were expressed in the past, it now
seems obvious that students would appreciate and
use this service even more than some of the others,
making it a necessity.
Other possible additions might include Jamba
Juice, which, according to Levin, did not feel it
would benefit from participating in the program in
the winter. However, with venues like Tresidder 112 it
ness and the Coffee House doing well after hours,
Jamba Juice would likely be no different, especially
in the spring. It, too, would be a welcome addition

to the After Midnight group.
Finally, with the remarkable success of the Ford
Center's After Midnight stint, the ASSU and the
University should consider opening some of the
other athletic facilities after hours as well. Keeping
the physical health of students in mind, a concern
which Levin argues has been largely ignored by ath
letic officials, making as many exercise facilities avail
able as possible seems a natural goal (or the devel
oping Stanford After Midnight program.
Ultimately, it falls to students to make their pref
erences known by voicing their support for the After
Midnight program if they wish to see it grow and
succeed in the long run. With freshmen losing car
privileges and more graduate students living on
campus, improved campus life will be a central con
cern for Stanford students if it is not already. Creat
ing programs like Stanford .After Midnight is the
first step in addressing this concern, but it is main
taining and improving such programs that will be
the real challenge and measure of success.
