# FARM LIFE
## The 						Bikers' Manifesto

be tongue-in-cheek. Well,
maybe tongue-and-cheek. 1
will bike. I will bike fast or
slow, weave in and out, with or without
my hands on the handlebars, and I will
enjoy it.
I will race through stop signs and
break the law. May that be the worst
thing 1 ever do!

coast is clear, it's tor

vou've one minute to
( lass. 11 A!
II you're flying
down the hill from
I .amhda Nil — it n nl\
is ph\ sit alh impossible
to stop at those signs.
In <>ill minds, tlicy are
lot cars anyway and
not loi pedestrians on
v\ heels.

I hat's right, you heard me say it.
Pedestrians on wheels — that is what
Stanford hikers are. We all see ourselves
as pedestrians — all tars must how to us;
we have right-ol'-wa\ no matter what.
W ho cares what inay or may not he
|>roto( ol — it is not and never will he fol
lowed. So, to all you whining drivers out
there, I have one word: deal.
And don't think i don't share your
pain. I too am a driver here, as well as a
hiker; I see both sides. Worse still, I am
.1 New York driver, and we stop lor no
one I)) tradition.
Moving to (lalilornia has forced me to
relinquish my former New York City
dri\ ing culture, whic li is a terrible thing
to have to do.
I am becoming a soft driver. I hang
in\ head in shame when, during breaks,
I let people in on the New York State
I lu uwa\ or kindK let an old lady cross
bus\ Route 9 in m\ hometown.
M\ point here is that I have learned.
I'm tired ol articles on "dateless Cats''
and opposing editorials from angry
drivers and real pedestrians. Stanford is
not vour tvpical < ommunity.
No conununitx has over fifteen thou
sand bikers who must get from Some
where to Somewhere Klse in the same
ten-minute block.
II anything, the roatl between the east
side of the Main Quad and the Bing
W ing looks like a street scene from Bei
jing. bin certainly not like the rest of Cal
ifornia.
We. the bikers of Stanford, are the
majority. I he drivers, the pedestrians,
the poll-carters and worse, the white
van-people who drive at three miles an
hour — they all must acquiesce to us, to
the majority: the bikers of Stanford.
Do not bow down to those who seem

more powerful than you simply because
llieir vehicle has a motor or because
they're 100 cool for a bike. Oh no.
Do not walk your bike while crossing
a busy intersection or stop while pedal
ing all the way down Santa Teresa —
unless there's a particularly daring driv
er coming — but you can psych him or
her out, don't worry.
II we were on cars, as the Car-pitalists
seem to think we are, then why do they
run us into the gutter or up on the side
walk?
Do not let that happen. Simply assert
yourself and bike where you like and
bow you like. We are all with you.
Our mobile community is every man
and woman for him or herself. I learned
long ago (September, 1998, in fact) that,
as a driver, you need to be on alert.
Other cars, other bikers, and even
real pedestrians think you do not exist.
You play a mind game with all the other
people in the world trying to get from
point A to point B — whether you're
behind the wheel, behind the handle
bars, or on your feet.
Hence, my one-word solution: DEAL.
It's not going to change. There are far
too many individual bikers and only a
handful (by comparison) of drivers and
walkers with whom we share our thor
oughfares.
We need to think realistically, (living
the linger or a $90 ticket to a biker who
missed a stop sign is not going to solve
anything — it simply creates rage or acts
as another form of tax collection.
Now, then, do not think 1 say this
applies everywhere. Certainly not. Off
the private roads of Stanford's bailiwick
and into Palo Alto, Menlo Park or wher
ever, you are back in the public domain
of the great State of California.
1 here you must stop because you are
back in Cat-pitalist territory, or, in the
c ase of Palo Alto, a Pedestriana of sorts.
But Stanford, oh, our beloved Farm —
no, no, this is the land of the bikers' free
will: the Biketariat.
The time has come. Don't lament
when trying to get from Mudd to Kres
ge in five minutes because your prof ran
overtime — just get there, and as fast as
you can with no worries. If you live in
Cov Co or, worse yet, off-campus, fear
not the whim of the whiny drivers.
They must come to terms with where
they are driving — they are on our turf.
We are on your side. We shall be subject
to the crosswalk no longer! Bikers of the
Farm, unite!

Our mobile community is every man
and woman for him or herself. I learned
long ago (September, 1998, in fact) that,
as a driver, you need to be on alert.
Other cars, other bikers, and even
real pedestrians think you do not exist.
You play a mind game with all the other
people in the world trying to get from
point A to point B — whether you're
behind the wheel, behind the handle
bars, or on your feet.
Hence, my one-word solution: DEAL.
It's not going to change. There are far
too many individual bikers and only a
handful (by comparison) of drivers and
walkers with whom we share our thor
oughfares.
We need to think realistically, (living
the linger or a $90 ticket to a biker who
missed a stop sign is not going to solve
anything — it simply creates rage or acts
as another form of tax collection.
Now, then, do not think 1 say this
applies everywhere. Certainly not. Off
the private roads of Stanford's bailiwick
and into Palo Alto, Menlo Park or wher
ever, you are back in the public domain
of the great State of California.
1 here you must stop because you are
back in Cat-pitalist territory, or, in the
c ase of Palo Alto, a Pedestriana of sorts.
But Stanford, oh, our beloved Farm —
no, no, this is the land of the bikers' free
will: the Biketariat.
The time has come. Don't lament
when trying to get from Mudd to Kres
ge in five minutes because your prof ran
overtime — just get there, and as fast as
you can with no worries. If you live in
Cov Co or, worse yet, off-campus, fear
not the whim of the whiny drivers.
They must come to terms with where
they are driving — they are on our turf.
We are on your side. We shall be subject
to the crosswalk no longer! Bikers of the
Farm, unite!
