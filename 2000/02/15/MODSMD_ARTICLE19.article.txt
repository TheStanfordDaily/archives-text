Drivers unfairly targeted,
bicyclists ignore law
The subject of cars and bicycles has
long been of interest to me as 1 have been
a commuter to the Stanford campus for
over nine years. Thus, the recent story of
a car hitting a bicyclist caught my atten
tion. Even though the story mentioned
that the driver of the car was not really at
fault, the headline and the bulk of the
story was clearly lopsided.
First of all, those of us who drive cars
pay dearly for the privilege, but we are
treated with disdain. On the other hand,
bicyclists seem to have been given "carte
blanche" to any surface smooth enough
for them to ride on.
They take all the privileges granted to
motorists on the roadways and expect to
be treated like pedestrians everywhere
else. They do not obey traffic rules or stay
off of areas marked with "No bicycle"
signs. They pay no respect to pedestrians
walking around campus.
Because of this, 1 am surprised there

are not more accidents betwen cars and
bicycles. I can only conclude that the rea
son tor this is because motorists maintain
a constant awareness of bicyc lists and use
extra caution as they drive on campus
roads. I know for certain that 1 do.

Science and engineering
spending justified
Your editorial (Feb. 11) advocating a
"fu/./.ie" as the next president assumes
that resources devoted to science and
engineering are somehow taken away
front the social sciences and the humani
ties. I his has no basis in fact or logic.
There is a simple reason that science
and engineering are expanding so rapid
ly at Stanford and other institutions. Sci
entific and engineering knowledge is
growing much faster than in the s<x:ial sci
ences and humanities. And the "high

priced faculty" you refer to more than off
set their cost by their ability to bring in
revenue in the form of grants and
research contracts. In fact, a portion of
this money goes to support Stanford gen
erally, techies and fuzzies alike.
