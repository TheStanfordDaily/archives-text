## Relay rewrites indoor records 
### CHRISTOPHER LYLE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the world of track and field,
where milliseconds matter, three
seconds is an eternity.
I he Stanford men's distance
medley relay team set the Ameri
can collegiate indoor record by al
most three seconds at the Tyson
Invitational at the University of
Arkansas this weekend. Sopho
mores Gabe Jennings, Evan Keltv
and Jonathon Riley and junior
Michael Stember combined their
efforts to run the relay in 9 min
utes HO. 19 seconds, shattering the
old record of 9:33.00 set last year
by UCLA.
Jennings opened the I)MR,
running his 1200-meter leg in
2:52.99. Kelty followed with a
48.6 second 400-meter run. Al
ready at the front of the pack,
Stember ran the 800-meter leg in
1:47.32, and Riley finished the
relay by running a 4:00.08 1(>00-
meter anchor leg. Jennings'
2:52.99 is the fastest 1200 split
ever run indoors.
"Breaking the record was a
goal going into the meet, and it
was great to accomplish," head

coach Vin Lananna said. "We
were all alone Ik an the begin
ning, and that's tough, especially
for the anchor leg. Starting with a
10 second lead indoors is equiva
lent to leading by almost hall the
entire track. We will be able to go
faster if we have competition."
I he Cardinal will be closing in
on a world record if they cut much
more off their time. The relay was
the third-fastest OMR run in the
world and only a few tenths of a
second oil the world record of
9:29.54.
Meanwhile, at the USA Nation
al Cross Country Championships
in Greensboro, North Carolina,
three members of the Stanford
men's distance team qualified for
the Cross Country World Cham
pionships to be held in Portugal
on March 18.
Freshmen Louis Luchini, who
placed second with a time of 26:24
over eight kilometers, and An
drew Hill, who placed fourth in
20:35, both qualified for the Ju
nior division. Stanford has quali
fied at least one athlete in this di
vision for the World Champi
