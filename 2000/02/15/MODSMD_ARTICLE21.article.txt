## Women's soccer coach announces decision to return to East Coast 
### GIL LOPEZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Women's soccer head coach
Steve Swanson is leaving the
Farm and taking over the same
position at Virginia.
Swanson, who in his four-year
career at Stanford led the team
to two Pacific 10 Conference ti
tles and garnered 1999 Pac-10
Coach of the Year honors, cited
family concerns as his reason for
leaving.

" The decision to leave Stan
ford, particularly at this time
when our soccer program is real
ly on the rise, has been one ol the
most difficult decisions of my
life," Swanson said iu a press re
lease. "
As a collegiate coach, this is
truly one of the most stimulating
environments in which to work.
However, my wife and 1 both
grew up in a different environ

provides, and coupled with the
extraordinarily high cost of liv
ing here, we felt it was in the best
interests of our 112 amily to leave."
1 he Athletic Department is
sued a press release concerning
his departure on Friday, though
Swanson informed the players in

;i team meeting last Wednesday
night.
Swanson's overall record at
Stanford stands at 49-28-4, and
this year's 3-1 NCAA tourna
ment victory against Cal Poly
was the program's first since
1993, when the Cardinal
reached the Final Four.
Despite the success on the
field and in recruiting — the
1998 and 1999 classes are con
sidered some of the top in the
nation — Swanson cited his rela
tionship with his players as the
hardest part of his decision.
"Flic single most difficult
thing about leaving Stanford is
having to leave my team," he
said in the release. "We are a
family in almost everv sense of

the word. I will miss each and
every one of them."
Before coming to Stanford,
Swanson spent seven years as
head coach at Dartmouth, where
he built the Big Green into a le
gitimate contender. He guided
Dartmouth to its first Ivy League
titles in 1991 and 1993, and its
first-ever NCAA Tournament
appearances in 1993 and 1994.
Swanson also has a close per
sonal relationship with men's
head coach Bobby Clark, who
coached at Dartmouth with
Swanson.
"Professionally, he is one of
the top coaches in that nation,
and personally he is a top-class
