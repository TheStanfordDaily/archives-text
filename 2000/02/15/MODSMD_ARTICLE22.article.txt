# New converts rebuild rugby
## 
### JON COHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Coming oil a season which
ended disappointingly in an
early exit from the nat ional tour
nament, and which the squad
optimistically dubbed a "rebuild
ing year," the Stanford men's
rugby team (6-1,2-1 Pacific Coast
League) has indeed been fully re
loaded.
It won its first six games, and
while much of this can be attrib
uted to the marked improve
ment of the veterans, the emer
gence of some recent transfers
fi oni other varsity sports has also
been a key component in the
early success.
Out of the team's fifteen
starters, four were involved in ei
ther football or soccer as recently
as last fall. Since that time,
though, their growing dissatis
faction with their roles on their
previous teams have pushed
them out oft hose sports, while at
the same time rekindling their
competitive fires.
"I've been playing organized
sports since I was four," said se
nior Che Holloway, who is now
in his first year of rugby after
three years of varsity football.
"I've never had an off-season,

and it was bothering me not play
ing football. I played a little on
special teams, and I got in a Few
plays here and there, but that
was about it. It's great just to be
playing in games again now."
Holloway, who has managed
to continue playing in recent
games despite a broken wrist he
suffered a few weeks ago, credits
his roommate, fellow senior Scott
Reilly, with convincing him to
come out for rugby. Reilly, who
currently starts as a hooker for
the squad, made a similar transi
tion himself prior to last season.
A walk-on kicker for the loot
ball team lor three seasons, Reil
ly decided before winter condi
tioning last year that the massive
time commitment required by
the sport was simply too much.
"For what I was getting out of
it," Reilly said, "it just wasn't
worth what I was putting in."
As for his decision to become
a rugger, he added, "I'd always
thought about playing rugbx
since I got to Stanford, plus I
wanted to stay physically active,
and it would have felt really
weird not to play sports."
While Reilly and Holloway,
like most Stanford players, had
never been exposed to t ugby be
fore the last lew years, sopho

more Forrest Cherlone had
some experience with the sport
in high school.
Still, when he came to Palo
Alto, Cherlone's main athletic
pursuit was soccer. This year,
however, lie has been drawn
back to the game of rugby, and
his exceptional speed has been
put to good use on the field.
Rounding out this legion of
lour recent converts is senior
Clinks Amajor, another former
football player who recently de
lected to the rugby squad and
landed a spot in coach Boivert's
starting lineup. Despite a
strained leg muscle which forced
him tosit out the I lumbolclt State
game last week, Artiajor has been
one of the stars for the Cardinal
this season.
W hat has allowed these four
players to excel in the sport so
soon is their si/e and sheer ath
leticism.
"Basically, anyone who can
play on a Division I team here is
capable ol stari ing in a club sport
[which is what rugby isj," senior
captain Mike (leballos said.

cess ol these four, though, in
