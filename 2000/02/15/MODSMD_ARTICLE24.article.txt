### ALEX BENJAMIN 
Still plagued by injuries, the
Stanford men's wrestling team (4-
5) came into their final weekend
of the regular season looking for a
couple wins to boost the team into
the Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships. After improving its
record to 3-4 with wins over Port
land State and Cal State-Fullerton
last week, the Cardinal went to
Cal Poly on Friday where they
pulled out a 21-15 win.
"The last time we beat the Mus
tangs was in 1990," said Stanford
head coach Chris Horpel. "So,
this was a big win for us."
The key match of the night
probably came from freshman
Justin Walker (141 pounds) who
had a tough victory over national
ly-ranked James Gross. With 15
seconds left to go in the match.
Walker's takedown proved to be
the deciding factor in a 4-3 victo
ry.
Other wins on the night came
from seniors Rudy Ruiz (125), 6-2
over Jaime Garza, Zach Zimmerer
(133), 10-6 over Roberto Garza,
and Warren McPherson (165), 7-
6 over Brett Schumann. Sopho
more Shawn Harmon (157) wres
tled in place of McPherson, who
filled in for the injured senior
Clay Hackerman. Harmon and
sophomore Andy Hunter (197)
captured important wins to send
Stanford to its third-consecutive
team win.
With this win the Cardinal got
back to .500 for the year, which
was enough to move the team
from eighth- to sixth place in the
Pac-10. However, the weekend
was not over, as they headed to
Fresno State on Saturday.
"Our final dual with Fresno
State was frustrating. We lost
three overtime matches that
could have gone either way and a
fourth close match when Zach
Zimmerer was defeated for the
first time this season against an
opponent he had beaten earlier,"
Horpel said. "1 have to give them
credit. They had 'that little some
thing' that we didn't have. On any
other day, those individual
matches could have gone our
way."
The Cardinal lost the meet 31-
3 with the only points coming
from Hunter, who had a 7-3 vic
tory over Tom Ghode. McPher
son, Ruiz and freshmen Brad
Selby (285) all lost in difficult
overtime matches Saturday,
which drops Stanford to 4-5 for
the year.
With a season that has been up
and down due to assorted injuries
and the unfortunate death of as
sistant coach I'ocl Sunnon on
New Year's Day, the last hurdle
lor the wrestling team will be the
I'ac -10 (championships.
The Cardinal now has two
weeks to prepare lor the c liatnpi
onships at I ( -\ )a\ is, where it will
be lighting lor its linal ranking in
the I'ac-10.
"Wrestling is a sport where
out dual meet record does not
liictoi into how we place as a team
in the conference," Ilorpel
added. "()in conference st.Hid
ing is determined solely bv our
performance at the I'ac -1 0
(Championship. It should be an
intense two-day tournament."
I here will be 10 urestlers per
weight class, with the top four
I.k mi eac li mo\ ing on to the
SICAA Championships in St.
Louis, Missouri.
"I believe we have between
three and live who have the cre
dentials to qualify. 'I hey just have
to be 'on' dm ing those two days,"
I lot pel said. "In addition, if some
of our other, younger athletes
upset some ranked wrestlers,
they, too, will qualifv."
