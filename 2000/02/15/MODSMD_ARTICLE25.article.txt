### SCOTT FINKELSTEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Although unable to bring the warm Ari
zona sunshine bat k to Palo Alto, the Stanford
men s g\ ninastics team did earn two easy vic
tories this weekend over No. 19 I C-Santa
Barbara (0-8, 0-8 Mountain Pacific Sports
federation) and No. 20 Arizona State (1-7).
I lie No. 13 Cardinal (3-4, 3-4) defeated
both opponents In scoring 219.300, far ahead
ol the Caiu hos' 21 ">.300 and the Sun Devils'
213.900.
Leading the way lor the Cardinal was
sophomore l)a\ul Durante. Durante was solid
on four ol his si\ events to tally an all-around
score of 1.33, earning him third-place hon
ors.
Stanford gymnasts earned first-place hon
ors on three ol the six events. Freshman Mar
shall l.i win impressed the crowd with his solid
strength moves to win the rings title. I he
judges were somewhat more reserved, giving
liim jtisi ,i 9.3"), but it was siill good enough fbi
first place.
Junioi j.tson Biltz brought home the paral
lel b.us title with a 9.45. Biltz has consistently
been the top all-around scorer for the Cardi
nal this vear, but struggled a little this week
end. Biltz was still able to perform an out
standing routine on parallel bars, his last event
of the competition.
I lie most sin prising (Cardinal victory ol the

evening was earned by redshirt fresh man
Cade Raggio. Raggio nailed his high bar rou
tine lor the first time in competition and
earned first place with a 9.35.
"I was not expecting to win high bar and
was very surprised that I did," Raggiosaid.
Although Stanford was unable to break its
season-high score, the team was pleased with
its performance in light of the absence of se
nior All-American Jason Katsampes, who was
competing at the Winter Cup Challenge in
I .as Vegas.
"Not having Jason to depend on was good
lor the team, because it gave some guys a
chance to break into the lineup on events that
they had not yet had an opportunity to com
pete on," said senior co-captain (a aig Nesbitt.
"The team viewed Jason's absence as an op
portunity, not as a setback, and went out with
the belief that we could still post a high score."
Unfortunately, a high score was not in the
cards for Stanford this weekend. The team
struggled on pommel horse and high bar,
where it missed nine out often routines.
I leading into the final two events, Stanford
was far ahead ol ASI and I C-Santa Barbara,
but was still concerned about having missed so
many routines. 1 "he team captains called a
short meeting to lot us on hitting one routine
at a time to turn the momentum around and
finish the competition on a high note. Of the
eleven routines on vault and parallel bars, the
(Cardinal missed just two.

"lii tlit* final two rotations, the team really
pulled together and posted some good scores
that salvaged what had been a lackluster meet
until then," Nesbitt said.
Finishing the meet on that high note was a
very good sign. In past competitions, Stanford
has been unable to generate good momentum
alter struggling on an event.
Last weekend against BYU, for instance,
Stanford had difficulties on pommel horse
early in the meet and was unable to find any
consistent rhythm afterwards. This weekend
was much different, as the Cardinal found the
confidence necessary to hit their final routines.
"We managed to finish with two strong
events after doing poorly on two of them," said
junior co-captain Rico Andrade. "This is the
most encouraging improvement from last
week at BYU."
Time is still running short for the Cardinal.
With just lour meets left before the post-sea
son, Stanford needs start posting higher
scores to qualify to NCAA Championships.
"We're starting to reach the do-or-die point
in the season," Nesbitt said. "If we don't start
putting it together soon, there won't be a post
season."
Stanford's next competition will be a dual
meet at Berkeley this Saturday. With the addi
tion of Katsampes to the lineup and the mo
mentum from the end of this weekend's meet,
the Cardinal is anxious to face the Bears and
post a high team score.
