### KATIE FITZPATRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If first impressions mean any
thing, the No. 10 Stanford
women's gymnastics team (5-2,2-2
Pacific 10 Conference) should do
very well when it competes at
Boise, Idaho, for the NCAA
Championships.
Sunday, at the site of Nationals,
the Cardinal hit its season high,
and posted season highs on every
event, blasting Boise State
196.825-195.775.
The Cardinal was led by the
outstanding all-around perfor
mances of senior All-American
Larissa Fontaine and sophomore
Katy Herbert. Fontaine showed
why she is the Stanford Student-
Athlete of the week, posting a ca
reer-high all-around score with a
total of 39.650 - an all-around
score that is the second highest in
Stanford history.
Herbert added several season
highs and a career high to the Car
dinal's remarkable team perfor
mance.
"Larissa and Katy were on fire,"
assistant coach Wayne Wright
said.
The meet started off well for
the Cardinal on uneven bars with
a solid 9.7 performance by junior
Jennifer Exaltacion. Freshman
Alissa Cooper contributed a 9.85
and senior Ail-American Sarah
I larding added a 9.875. Fontaine
and Herbert shared the uneven
bar title with near-perfect scores
of 9.9.
"Katy was amazing - she did a
perfect routine," Fontaine said.
Stanford traveled to vault for
an exciting performance. Every
Cardinal, save one, stuck their
vaults. Exaltacion executed a
near-perfect handspring pike
front for a score of 9.85. Fontaine,
the 1998 NCAA Vault Champion,
tied her career high with a score
of 9.975. One judge deemed
Fontaine's performance worthy
of a'perfect 10.'
"My vault has been feeling real
ly good lately, but 1 really want a
10," Fontaine said.
The floor lineup for Stanford
showed signs of its talent and bril
liance. The judges gave Herbert's
spunky routine a 9.875, a career
high for the sophomore. Exalta
cion posted a career-high 9.9.
I larding, a finalist on the event at

Nationals last year, added another
9.9 to the Cardinal total. Fontaine
finished oil the rotation with an
impressive 9.925.
Stanford ended on beam with
another strong rotation filled with
solid routines. Sophomore Becky
Meldrum opened up with charac
teristic steadiness for a season
high 9.775. Exaltacion added a
9.825 and Fontaine gave a 9.85.
Herbert and freshman Kelsey
Stillinger took second in the event
with scores of 9.875. The event
title went to freshman Abby Gair,
whose solid performance earned
her a career-high 9.925.
The Cardinal's win was a need
ed boost coming off a disappoint
ing performance last week against
UCLA. Stanford needed a good
score to boost their Regional Qual
ifying Score which will determine
their placement at Regionals and
affect their ability to qualify for Na
tionals.
The Cardinal needed to have a
solid score at Boise to stay in the
nation's top 12, and it did. The
Cardinal's consistency allowed it
not to count a major mistake on
every event - one of its core goals
every meet. This consistency was
reflected in the Cardinal's high
team total which should boost its
national ranking and give Stan
ford the opportunity to compete
in a better venue for Regionals.
"It was really motivating to
compete at the Nationals site. We
were excited to be there and ready
to compete," Fontaine said.
"We showed Boise what Stan
lord was really made of . We went
out with attitude and confidence
and we had a lot of fun," Exalta
cion said.
The Cardinal will return home
for two meets this weekend. On
Friday, it will host Cal and on
Monday it will host BYU. The
team's performance against Boise
will likely give it a lift as it returns
home.
Stanford should be able to build
on its performance and carry it
through the remainder of the sea
son. To achieve its goal of qualify
ing for the NCAA team finals, the
Cardinal will need performances
like it gave at Boise for the rest of
the season.
"We want to continue the atti
tude we developed in Boise
throughout the rest of the season,"
Exaltacion said.
