# MP3 Wars:
## Napster and MP3.com square off against the RIAA in a fiesty battle 
### SALAS SARAIYA 
"For chrissake, we're still in beta; we are
freaking lour months old."
1 love CEO talk. Of course, this isn't just
any (E() we're talking abc>ut. Normal ( EOs
use words like "venture capitalism" and
"market evaluation." not words like "chris
sake" and "freaking." I hat's why I love
Eileen Richardson. She brought us Napster.
Napster's a great ser\ ice for freeloaders. I
had a friend who would sneak into movies
and switch prices on department store mer
chandise to get designer shoes lor hall price.
1 le said it was against his philosophy to pay
lor entertainment. 1 his one's lor you, Shilan.
I'm addicted to Ml\Ss so napster is great
tor me. Belbre Napster, I would constantly
sign on to Network Neighborhood in the
hopes that someone's ac count was no longer

password-protected or that someone had
(1< )wnl(>at lec lor I nunecllie\\ \ll '.'Vs. i ,y< -os was
also available, but its ftp links would burn out
nine out often times.
Napster is more efficient than l.vcos or
other Ml\S search engines because its links
are dynamically created. When a user, we'll
call him bigMoneySalsa, signs on, ;ill the
songs from a specified directory or direc to
ries are uploaded. Other users are free to
download songs from bigMoncv'Salsa and
bigMoneySalsa is free to download songs
from all other users. When bigMoneySalsa
signs oil, all his songs go with him.
So what's to stop bigMoneySalsa from rip
ping his new (hitkast ( \) and making it avail
able to everyone through Napster? Mow
does Jay Z ensure that the money is his
thang? I low indeed.
I lie old guard in the* music scene, groups

like the Recording Industry Association of
America and the digitallv c harged newcom
ers, like startup Napster and publicly traded
MP3.com, do not get along. Not only have
lawsuits been bounced back and Ibrth like an
e-mail to a private list, but the two sides have
bashed each other on their Web sites.
YVhv do the two sides hate each other? 1
could write a book. You might not read it
but ii would be out there. I"he R.IAA sees the
new companies as naive, unsophisticated
punks who are a threat to its vested interest
— whether that interest is to control music
industry's artists or to protect the artists' in
terests is debatable.
Napster and Ml*3.com see the RIAA as a
collection of sttilled suits. There's nothing us
C'.S dorks hate more than st tilled suits. That,
and shaving. Stuart Scott of Sports Center
has a saying, "Don't bate the player, hate the

game." And as any .coin company worth its
weight in gold knows, if you hate the game,
it's your responsibility to change it
The RIAA has sued Napster for copyright
infringement. While it has yet to be proven
that the increase in MIM usage is causing CD
sales to fall, I know too many people who
have quit buving CDs because MP.'Vs are free
to question that theory. Now that it's so easy
to attain MP3s through the Internet and
burn them on to your own CD, it's hard to
see the market for CDs increasing.
But who should be punished? The RIAA
claims that Napster should be punished for
making it ridiculously easy for consumers to
pirate songs and transfer them through the
Internet. Napster claims that consumers

si k >11 Id be responsible lor their own
actions. Alter all. there are legal
MPSson the Internet as well. Some
bands use M P3s as a way of getting
their sound out, bypassing the old
system of impressing radio bigwigs
like those at RIAA with their style
and substance and then hoping
radio D|s like theii musi<.
I lie RIAA is also suing
MP3.com. MP3.com lias ;i service,
"Beam-it," thai enables users to in
sert a CD-ROM into their drive
and then access the music tli.it was
on that (11) from anywhere.
MP3.com has burned ;in astound
ing 45,000 ( IDs that consumers can
access in this way. I bis system lias
many loopholes. I sers ol
MP3.com don't iiecessarilv have to
own the (ID. they just have to load
it into their (ID-R( )\1 di ive.
Also, a user can share his usei 11 >
and password with otliei people so
they can sign on and use the same
MP3s.
I lie RIAA claims the) have no
problem with MP3s per se, but just
with the Beam-it set \ ice. I "hey say
it cheats its artists out ol nione\ I>\

making it easier for consumers to
commit copyright infringement.
MP3.com, however, stresses
that its set vice actually benefits
artists. With Beam-it, artists can lo
cate its consumers and market di
rectly to them. Their technology is
the future, they say, and the RIAA
had better get used to it.
MP3.com has countersued, say
ing that the RIAA has discouraged
other vendors from using MP3
technology through njilair busi
ness practices, declination, and
trade libel. MP3.com CEO Michael
Robertson told Wired News that,
"RlAAand Rosen, on behalfofand
in concert with the RIAA's record
ing industry members, have waged
a campaign to impugn and dispar
age MP3.com as supporting music
'theli,' piracy' and other disrep
utable practices, and to use these
false allegations to disrupt and in
terfere with MP3.com's financial
and business relationships, and
market capitalization." 1 lie RIAA
responded on its Web site by c all
ing these charges a weak attempt to
cover up the truth.
I be lawsuits against Napster
and MP3.com come partially be
cause of the difficulty of suing the
people actually using illegal MP3s.
It's nearly impossible to determine

who has illegal MP3son their com
puter and, even if you could, the
number of suits would be stagger
ing. My guess is you'd have to pros
ecute over half of the university stu
dents in America.
Some universities are taking
care of the situation for the RIAA.
Schools that have banned Napster
include Bucknell and Oregon State
University. This ban is instituted
through a firewall preventing ac-
tyapttw mmi'h
are generally, n<H, lo
calise of the piracy implications but
because of the unique and heavy
bandwidth taken up by Napster.
Because students are trading
such large files (MP3s are generally
three to five megabytes), Napster
takes up a lot of the server's re
st mixes. Also, since students have
I I or higher modems, they can ac
cumulate many Ml'3s, which leads
to high incoming traffic from out
side users seeking to download the
MP3s off the students' computers.
Normal traffic is generally outgo
ing. with students logging on to
outside web servers.
At USC, Napster was taking up
40 percent of the servers, "causing
delays and disruptions of impor
tant Internet service to the acade
mic community," according to a

notice sent to the student body call
ing for a town meeting to discuss
the service.
My advice to you: if you are a
frequent user of Napster, don't up
load all your files onto the server.
That way the traffic won't be as
high and won't cause unnecessary
disruptions for Stanford.
Also, be careful not to get be
tween RIAA and the Internet com
panies, unless you want to get
dirty.
With the amount of mudsling
ing they're doing, they could be
nominated in the Republican pri
mary.

1 love CEO talk. Of course, this isn't just
any (E() we're talking abc>ut. Normal ( EOs
use words like "venture capitalism" and
"market evaluation." not words like "chris

Napster is more efficient than l.vcos or
other Ml\S search engines because its links
are dynamically created. When a user, we'll
call him bigMoneySalsa, signs on, ;ill the
songs from a specified directory or direc to

download songs from bigMoncv'Salsa and
bigMoneySalsa is free to download songs

So what's to stop bigMoneySalsa from rip

I lie old guard in the* music scene, groups

like the Recording Industry Association of
America and the digitallv c harged newcom

MP3.com, do not get along. Not only have
lawsuits been bounced back and Ibrth like an

Napster and Ml*3.com see the RIAA as a
collection of sttilled suits. There's nothing us
C'.S dorks hate more than st tilled suits. That,

it's your responsibility to change it
The RIAA has sued Napster for copyright
infringement. While it has yet to be proven
that the increase in MIM usage is causing CD
sales to fall, I know too many people who
have quit buving CDs because MP.'Vs are free
to question that theory. Now that it's so easy
to attain MP3s through the Internet and
burn them on to your own CD, it's hard to
see the market for CDs increasing.
But who should be punished? The RIAA
claims that Napster should be punished for
making it ridiculously easy for consumers to
pirate songs and transfer them through the
Internet. Napster claims that consumers

si k >11 Id be responsible lor their own
actions. Alter all. there are legal
MPSson the Internet as well. Some
bands use M P3s as a way of getting
their sound out, bypassing the old
system of impressing radio bigwigs
like those at RIAA with their style
and substance and then hoping
radio D|s like theii musi<.
I lie RIAA is also suing
MP3.com. MP3.com lias ;i service,
"Beam-it," thai enables users to in
sert a CD-ROM into their drive
and then access the music tli.it was
on that (11) from anywhere.
MP3.com has burned ;in astound
ing 45,000 ( IDs that consumers can
access in this way. I bis system lias
many loopholes. I sers ol
MP3.com don't iiecessarilv have to
own the (ID. they just have to load
it into their (ID-R( )\1 di ive.
Also, a user can share his usei 11 >
and password with otliei people so
they can sign on and use the same
MP3s.
I lie RIAA claims the) have no
problem with MP3s per se, but just
with the Beam-it set \ ice. I "hey say
it cheats its artists out ol nione\ I>\

making it easier for consumers to
commit copyright infringement.
MP3.com, however, stresses
that its set vice actually benefits
artists. With Beam-it, artists can lo
cate its consumers and market di
rectly to them. Their technology is
the future, they say, and the RIAA
had better get used to it.
MP3.com has countersued, say
ing that the RIAA has discouraged
other vendors from using MP3
technology through njilair busi
ness practices, declination, and
trade libel. MP3.com CEO Michael
Robertson told Wired News that,
"RlAAand Rosen, on behalfofand
in concert with the RIAA's record
ing industry members, have waged
a campaign to impugn and dispar
age MP3.com as supporting music
'theli,' piracy' and other disrep
utable practices, and to use these
false allegations to disrupt and in
terfere with MP3.com's financial
and business relationships, and
market capitalization." 1 lie RIAA
responded on its Web site by c all
ing these charges a weak attempt to
cover up the truth.
I be lawsuits against Napster
and MP3.com come partially be
cause of the difficulty of suing the
people actually using illegal MP3s.
It's nearly impossible to determine

who has illegal MP3son their com
puter and, even if you could, the
number of suits would be stagger
ing. My guess is you'd have to pros
ecute over half of the university stu
dents in America.
Some universities are taking
care of the situation for the RIAA.
Schools that have banned Napster
include Bucknell and Oregon State
University. This ban is instituted
through a firewall preventing ac-

are generally, n<H, lo
calise of the piracy implications but
because of the unique and heavy
bandwidth taken up by Napster.
Because students are trading
such large files (MP3s are generally
three to five megabytes), Napster
takes up a lot of the server's re
st mixes. Also, since students have
I I or higher modems, they can ac
cumulate many Ml'3s, which leads
to high incoming traffic from out
side users seeking to download the
MP3s off the students' computers.
Normal traffic is generally outgo
ing. with students logging on to
outside web servers.
At USC, Napster was taking up
40 percent of the servers, "causing
delays and disruptions of impor
tant Internet service to the acade
mic community," according to a

notice sent to the student body call
ing for a town meeting to discuss
the service.
My advice to you: if you are a
frequent user of Napster, don't up
load all your files onto the server.
That way the traffic won't be as
high and won't cause unnecessary
disruptions for Stanford.
Also, be careful not to get be
