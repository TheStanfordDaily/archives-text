"For chrissake, we're still in beta; we are
freaking lour months old."
1 love CEO talk. Of course, this isn't just
any (E() we're talking abc>ut. Normal ( EOs
use words like "venture capitalism" and
"market evaluation." not words like "chris
sake" and "freaking." I hat's why I love
Eileen Richardson. She brought us Napster.
Napster's a great ser\ ice for freeloaders. I
had a friend who would sneak into movies
and switch prices on department store mer
chandise to get designer shoes lor hall price.
1 le said it was against his philosophy to pay
lor entertainment. 1 his one's lor you, Shilan.
I'm addicted to Ml\Ss so napster is great
tor me. Belbre Napster, I would constantly
sign on to Network Neighborhood in the
hopes that someone's ac count was no longer

password-protected or that someone had
(1< )wnl(>at lec lor I nunecllie\\ \ll '.'Vs. i ,y< -os was
also available, but its ftp links would burn out
nine out often times.
Napster is more efficient than l.vcos or
other Ml\S search engines because its links
are dynamically created. When a user, we'll
call him bigMoneySalsa, signs on, ;ill the
songs from a specified directory or direc to
ries are uploaded. Other users are free to
download songs from bigMoncv'Salsa and
bigMoneySalsa is free to download songs
from all other users. When bigMoneySalsa
signs oil, all his songs go with him.
So what's to stop bigMoneySalsa from rip
ping his new (hitkast ( \) and making it avail
able to everyone through Napster? Mow
does Jay Z ensure that the money is his
thang? I low indeed.
I lie old guard in the* music scene, groups

like the Recording Industry Association of
America and the digitallv c harged newcom
ers, like startup Napster and publicly traded
MP3.com, do not get along. Not only have
lawsuits been bounced back and Ibrth like an
e-mail to a private list, but the two sides have
bashed each other on their Web sites.
YVhv do the two sides hate each other? 1
could write a book. You might not read it
but ii would be out there. I"he R.IAA sees the
new companies as naive, unsophisticated
punks who are a threat to its vested interest
â€” whether that interest is to control music
industry's artists or to protect the artists' in
terests is debatable.
Napster and Ml*3.com see the RIAA as a
collection of sttilled suits. There's nothing us
C'.S dorks hate more than st tilled suits. That,
and shaving. Stuart Scott of Sports Center
has a saying, "Don't bate the player, hate the

game." And as any .coin company worth its
weight in gold knows, if you hate the game,
it's your responsibility to change it
The RIAA has sued Napster for copyright
infringement. While it has yet to be proven
that the increase in MIM usage is causing CD
sales to fall, I know too many people who
have quit buving CDs because MP.'Vs are free
to question that theory. Now that it's so easy
to attain MP3s through the Internet and
burn them on to your own CD, it's hard to
see the market for CDs increasing.
But who should be punished? The RIAA
claims that Napster should be punished for
making it ridiculously easy for consumers to
pirate songs and transfer them through the
Internet. Napster claims that consumers
