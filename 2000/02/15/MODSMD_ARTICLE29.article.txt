Editors Note:
Lab Watch is a bi-weekly column
that will highlight a specific laborato
ry within the Stanford community in
order to offer readers a glimpse of the
dynamic scientific efforts undertaken
at the University.
(ireat things are going on in
the Department ol Anthropolog
ical Sciences. One of the depart
ment's members, Assoc. Prof.
Dr. Joanna Mountain, celebrat
ed the official opening of her lab
on Feb. 1 1.
Mountain is an anthropologi
cal geneticist with a dual ap
pointment to the Department of
Anthropological Sciences and to
the Department ol (ienetics. She
received her doctorate from the
latter department in 11)1)4 and
lotuses her widespread interests
on researching human evolu
tionary genetics.
Mountain's interests also in
clude modern human origins,
the relation of genetic and lin
guistic variation and the culture
and genetics of Kast Africa,
where she was once a Peace
(lorps volunteer.
Stanford began renovating
laboratory space for Mountain in
| an nary of 1998, when she
began her post as an associate

professor. Mountain's facility,
housed in Building 80, is the
only laboratory spate located in
the inner quad.
Because it is an anthropologi
cal genetics facility, the lab work
centers around the genetics of
human evolution, exploring
such topics as the social struc
tures ol past societies, the rela
tion between genetic, cultural,
and linguistic variation and the
inference of human evolution
and history.
Mountain noted,"()ur lab dif
fers from other genetics labora
tories in that we focus on human
genetic variation and what that
variation tells us about human
evolution and human history.
I his is very different liom most
genetics labs, where researchers
focus more on cell biology and
the genetic basis for disease."
Mountain's research group
has been generating computer
based research since the summer
of 1999 and launched its re
search in molecular biology this
past December.
Mountain remarked on Feb.
II that, "Today we celebrated
obtaining our first genotype re
sults and opening the lab up to
visitors, including many peo pie
who had assisted us in setting tip
the lab. We had a good crowd,
despite the pouring rain!"
Research scientist Dr. Alec

Knight is ;i member of Moun
tain's lab group along with An
thropological Sciences graduate
students Charles Roseinan and
Holly Morten sen and under
graduate Jason Blue-Smith.
Mountain commented that,
"While 1 anticipate that the
group will remain relatively
small, I expect to include addi
tional undergraduates in the fu
ture."
Mountain's lab has been fund
ed by the National Science f oun
dation to produce genetic work
on lour linguistically different
populations in Tanzania.
"f.acli of these groups repre
sents one of the four language
families in Africa, Mountain sai<I.
Ihe liad/abe are a
hunting/gathering group, the
Da tog are pastoralists, the lraqw
areagi o-pastoralistsand the \V"a
sukunia are agrii ulturists.
We hope to determine
whether genetic differences pai
allel linguistic and cultural dil
ferences."
Additional funding of Moun
tain's woi k has been pro\ ided bv
the National Institutes of I le.it11
(NIII). '1 lie* Nil I grant will go to
ward the development of genetic
systems designed to bolster the
ability of researchers to predict
huge scale human activih in the
distant past.
"We call these systems

"SNPSI Rs" (pronounced "snip
sters")," Mountain explained,
"because the\ are a combination
of Single Nucleotide Polymor
phisms (SNI's) and Short fan
dem Repeat (SIR) polymor
phisms."'
fhe genetic systems that
Mountain's lab is developing will
test current hypotheses concern
ing human migrations and pop
ulation expansions.
One graduate student is
working on an analysis of the
chromosome using data gener
ated by the famed geneticist
I.uca Cavalli-Sfor/a and col
leagues from the Stanford CÂ»e
netics Department. I lie projects
involves inferring where and
when human populations have
migrated from patterns of genet
ic variation
It will be interesting for re
searchers to see the contribu
tions that Mountain's laboratory
will make to the scientific com
niunit) .it Stanford and exciting
to learn about what Mountain's
research can tell lis about our
past.
