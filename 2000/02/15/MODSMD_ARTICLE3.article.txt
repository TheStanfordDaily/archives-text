# Egg donor ad draws scrutiny
## 
### MARGAUX HALL CONTRIBUTING writer 
In the wake ofa Daily ad that ap
peared numerous times over the
past few weeks, a national contro
versy has arisen, attracting the at
tention of news media such as (INN
and MSNBC!, along with many oth
ers.
The advertisement, which was
sponsored by a Christian-affiliated
organization named Families 2000,
offered $100,000 for a Caucasian
donor of "proven college level ath
letic ability."
This sum of money marks the

largest-known offer made for an
egg-donation, exceeding the
$50,000 egg donor ad posted at sev
eral upper-tier universiriT*S'.includ
ing Stanford, in the last academic
year. A typical egg donor receives
around $4,000 compensation for
the procedure.
Using the phrase "Cive the Gift
of Love and Life," the full-page ad
vertisement offers to pay the sum of
money either directly to the donor
or to the charity of her choice.

ductive technology, some members
of the Stanford community have
been voicing their concerns over
the large sums couples are willing
to pay to have "a superior child,"
said Bioethics Prof. William Hurl
but.
I lurlbut said he has witnessed a
largely negative response from the
students in his bioethic s classes.
Junior Kate Bonzon, one of
lluilbut's students, explained, "I
think that's a very private, personal
thing to donate to somebody else,
especially a stranger."
By plac ing the acl in the newspa
per of a well-recognized university
such as Stanford, many community
members feel that the ad was an at
tempt to obtain the best possible
genes.
"I see the ad as an attempt to get

a donation from a person they
think will be successful in an intel
lectual and athletic realm," Bon/on
added.
In addition, Hurlbut said he
worries that parents who place re
quirements on their egg donors are
similarly placing requirements for
their offspring to have the most de
sirable attributes.
"As parents, you make an im
plicit commitment to love the off
spring you produce," Hurlbut said.
"When you place requirements on
an egg donor, it implies that there
are expectations of the child."
In addition to the moral issues
associated with egg donation, med
ical associations across the country
are acknowledging that the repro
ductive technology is new and
therefore carries with it yet
unidentified risks.
According to the American Soci
ety for Reproductive Medicine,
women who donate eggs have a
heightened risk of contracting
ovarian cancer and may experi
ence an early onset of menopause.
Other health professionals fear
that there may be other risks yet to
be discovered, given the technolo
gy, which has only come into active
use in the past decade.
"You're playing with something
tender and unsure," Hurlbut said.
"The technology is still quite new."
Other Stanford community

members expressed surprise at
Families 20()0's affiliation with the
Christian faith.
The organization, which is
based in Southern California, de
fines itself on its website as having
been "founded and operated on
Christian values."
"It seems like a Christian orga
nization would want birth to be in
its most natural sense and from the
two people who will be raising the
child," Bonzon said.
Families 2000 did not return
phone t ails for comments on the
Christian affiliation of its organiza
tion or on the ad.
