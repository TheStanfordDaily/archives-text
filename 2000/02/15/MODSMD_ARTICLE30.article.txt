# Health risks deter potential egg donors
## 
### MONYA DE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A year ago, I lie Daily printed an
advertisement promising $50,000
in compensation to a 510" egg
donor with SAT scores ovei 1 tOO.
1 lit advertisement set national
news win s on lire and sparked de
bate over the wisdom ol'premium
salaries lor egg donation.
A veai later, the $50,000 origi
nal!) ollered lias been eclipsed by
an organization offering twice that
amount plus medical and inconve
nience expenses to a college-athlete
female willing to give up a few ga
metes.
While the idea ol obliterating
student loan payments is justifiablv
attractive, the pi ice of egg donation
has sk\rocketed for two reasons:
rarity and i isk. In today's wage-po
larized society, couples with money
to burn are willing to pay the cost
required to seek out the woman
with the credentials they want in
children born ol in vitro fertiliza
tion.
What isn't apparent from ads,
though, is the significant prepara
tion required lor a sua ess fill dona
tion The prospective donor must
undergo an initial psychological
screening, including a meeting
with a counselor, the presentation
of a recipient couple and a meeting
between the couple and the donoi,
if the donation is to be open
Having passed this test, the
donoi is screened lot 'social dis
eases' such is \I1)S as well as any
othet pre-existing conditions. I he

couple is screened for disease as
well. A legal contract is drawn up
and each partv reviews the contract
with a lawyer. If all are in agree
ment about the financial and logis
tic terms of the donation, the con
tract is signed and a legal clearance
report is issued.
The donor is then reach for an
IYT cycle.' First, the menstrual cy
cles of the donor and recipient must
be synchronized so that they begin
their cvcles on the same day. In
preparation for a Day 14 egg re
trieval, the donor is stimulated with
a series of hormone injections that
tell her body to release more eggs
than normal cluiing ovulation.
Before ovulation, the donor's
hormone levels are monitored
through blood tests and transvagi
nal ultrasounds are taken to moni
tor follicle development.
When the eggs reach the right
size, human chorionic go
nadotropin is injec ted to prepare
them for aspiration. 1 he eggs are
aspirated during a same-day proce
dure performed under partial
anesthesia.
\ needle is inserted through the
vaginal wall and used to reach the
eggs in the follicles, which are visi
ble on a vide o screen that the physi
cian watches as he manuevers the
ultrasound probe and needle.
Blood and other fluid collected
I i t nil the pat iei it is examined under
the microsope for the presence of
eggs. Vlthough as many as 50 eggs
have resulted from a single re-
trieval, a typical number is seven.
After the eggs are retrieved, they
are snipped of their protective
outer coating and prepared for fer
tilization. Usually, the husband or
partner's sperm is used, but donor
sperm may be used if the male is in
fertile or 110 male partner exists.
The zygote might beheaded for the
prospective mother's uterus or a
surrogate mother's uterus, de
pending on whether the mother is
physically ablÂ£ to "carry a child to
term.
The chance of a normal preg
nancy and delivery resulting 112 rom a
single IVFcycle is about 20 percent.
In the event that the eggs are not
fertilized or do not implant, a
prospective donor must be aware of
the amount of money she will be
paid as well as her legal protection.
In addition, a donor is subject to
the risk of future infertility and
ovarian cyst formation due to the
hormonal stimulation and the aspi
ration process. In general, repeat
ed donations put a woman at much
higher risk for reproductive prob
lems than a single donation.
Because the chances of the fertil
ized egg implanting into the uterus
are so low, embryologist Barry
Belli and reproductive endocrinol
ogist Amin Milki of the School of
Medicine sought to improve the
odds for implantation.
The method they developed in
volved incubating the fertilized
eggs for five days rather than three
in a 'soup' that imitates conditions
ill the fallopian tube. Forcing the

eggs to survive longer in vitro
demonstrates whit li ones are fittest
and most likelv to develop without
genetic defects.
When implanted, these egg-: at e
also entering the uterus at a time
closer to the time the egg would
naturally end up in the uterus if it
were traveling from the fallopian
tube.
The emotional investment of the
donor can he minimal to immense.
An egg donor who is trading her
eggs for mone\ musi be prepared
to deal with the prospect of being
the biological parent of a child she is
unlikely to meet.
Couples seek out egg donation 1
for many reasons. The most com
mon is female infertility due to age
or illness. I lie woman's ovaries may
not produce eggs due to cysts, or
she may have even experienced
mem >pausc. C louples heterozygous
for genetic disorders might wish to
prevent the birth of a ver\ sic k
child.
I lowever, recent allegations that
parents placing ads for Amazonian
geniuses are engaging in a form of
21st centurv eugenics have been
made by bioethicists who fear that
monev may be too large .1 plaving
card in the hands of infertile cou
ples.
They question the wisdom of
'pie-ordering babies when genet
ics is known to be lie kle and unpre
dictable as well as debatabh the
source of such traits ;is athletic abil
ity or stanclardizecl-test prowess.
Still, the fact that companies
such as Fgg Donation. Inc. inc t ease
their compensation for repeat
donors shows a willingness to p.iv
the price to keep most desired
genes in the egg pool.
