### MONYA DE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A year ago, I lie Daily printed an
advertisement promising $50,000
in compensation to a 510" egg
donor with SAT scores ovei 1 tOO.
1 lit advertisement set national
news win s on lire and sparked de
bate over the wisdom ol'premium
salaries lor egg donation.
A veai later, the $50,000 origi
nal!) ollered lias been eclipsed by
an organization offering twice that
amount plus medical and inconve
nience expenses to a college-athlete
female willing to give up a few ga
metes.
While the idea ol obliterating
student loan payments is justifiablv
attractive, the pi ice of egg donation
has sk\rocketed for two reasons:
rarity and i isk. In today's wage-po
larized society, couples with money
to burn are willing to pay the cost
required to seek out the woman
with the credentials they want in
children born ol in vitro fertiliza
tion.
What isn't apparent from ads,
though, is the significant prepara
tion required lor a sua ess fill dona
tion The prospective donor must
undergo an initial psychological
screening, including a meeting
with a counselor, the presentation
of a recipient couple and a meeting
between the couple and the donoi,
if the donation is to be open
Having passed this test, the
donoi is screened lot 'social dis
eases' such is \I1)S as well as any
othet pre-existing conditions. I he

couple is screened for disease as
well. A legal contract is drawn up
and each partv reviews the contract
with a lawyer. If all are in agree
ment about the financial and logis
tic terms of the donation, the con
tract is signed and a legal clearance
report is issued.
The donor is then reach for an
IYT cycle.' First, the menstrual cy
cles of the donor and recipient must
be synchronized so that they begin
their cvcles on the same day. In
preparation for a Day 14 egg re
trieval, the donor is stimulated with
a series of hormone injections that
tell her body to release more eggs
than normal cluiing ovulation.
Before ovulation, the donor's
hormone levels are monitored
through blood tests and transvagi
nal ultrasounds are taken to moni
tor follicle development.
When the eggs reach the right
size, human chorionic go
nadotropin is injec ted to prepare
them for aspiration. 1 he eggs are
aspirated during a same-day proce
dure performed under partial
anesthesia.
\ needle is inserted through the
vaginal wall and used to reach the
eggs in the follicles, which are visi
ble on a vide o screen that the physi
cian watches as he manuevers the
ultrasound probe and needle.
