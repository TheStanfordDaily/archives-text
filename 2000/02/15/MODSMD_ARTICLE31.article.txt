### WENHSIN LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Heidi Roizen, managing direc
tor of Softbank Venture Capital,
enlightened a packed room of
students, community members
and faculty last Friday afternoon
as she explained the unpre
dictability and excitement of ven
ture capital funding.
Roizen is this quarter's first
speaker in the Industry Thought
Leaders Seminar, co-sponsored
by the Industrial Kngineei ing de
partment, the Business Associa
tion of Stanford Kngineers and
the Stanford Technology Ven
tures Program.
Junior John Ken said that the
talk was "especially relevant con
sidering the cm rent flood of start
up companies seeking funding."
In her talk, Roizen explained
the varying fat tors that determine
whether a business plan is over
looked or adopted by a venture
capital fh in.
"The first step is getting a
meeting with us," she stated.
Roizen commented that send
ing as much material as possible
to her desk is overwhelming
rather than helpful, and she rec
ommends sending an executive
summary of the business plan in
an e-mail text.
Roizen also described how Hot
bank, the incubator lor new start
ups that operate out of the base
ment of Softbank Ventures, pre
pared themselves for venture cap
ital funding.
"Often it's a couple of people

with a laptop who need a place to
work," she stated. "The level of
energy in there is incredible and
exciting."
Roizen spoke of the new cul
'ture of start-up companies and
also related her personal path to a
position in venture capital fund
ing.
As a mother of young children
and a wife, Roizen preferred to
work from home. After being
asked to work at Softbank Ven
tures full-time, Roizen continues
to set her own hours even though
she works at the office.
Junior Tim Choi of BASKS
stated, "I learned a lot from
1 leidi's personal story. She decid
ed how to build her career based
on what she wanted out of life
rather than conforming to soci
etal rules."
"I found her to be a very dy
namic speaker, and she spoke
very honestly on bow venture
capital firms decide who to 112 und,"
(ihoi stated.
I lie next speaker in the series
will be l a-Lin Hsu of H&Q Asia,
followed by Ann Winbald, co
founder of Hummer Winbald
and Ken Wirt, founder and CEO
of Riffage. The theme for this
quarter's series is Clobal Entre
prenuership Marketing.
"We invited people who take
enlreprenuership to the interna
tional level," Choi stated. "For in
stance, Heidi Roizen works with
companies in Asia as well as in the
United States."
Open to all students as well as
Stanford community members,

the series will continue every Fri
day afternoon from 4:30 p.m. to
5:45 p.m. in I eiman Auditorium.
Speakers will also be broadcast on
SITN channel El and on Stan

"One of the goals of BASES is
to bring entreprenuership to
Stanford students, and the
Thought Leaders seminar has
been very successful in accom
plishing that goal.
"We continue to merge our
goals of combining entrepreneur
ship with technology companies
with our ongoing winter quarter
events," Choi said.

ford Entrepreneur's Challenge
