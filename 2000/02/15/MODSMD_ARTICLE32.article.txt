# Start-up CEO offers advice on the high tech fast lane of Silicon Valley
## 
### ANGEL PUERTA 
As the stream of Stanford stu
dents who sign up with high-tech
start-up companies continues to
swell, so do the ranks of those stu
dents who in the process will seri
ously damage their careers. They
may compromise their personal
lives and belatedly discover that
at the end of the rainbow, if they
find gold, it does not mean much
to them anyway.
I he popularity and appeal of
stock option plans has complete
ly overshadowed the many nega
tive, unethical and even immoral
aspects of such plans. First and
foremost is how the con-

cepts of professional de
velopment and a career
have taken a backseat to
the allure of opportunity.
What ought to be 40
years of professional life is
being replaced by four
years of vesting. What
must be a working situa
tion in tune with the goals

and values of a person is instead a
willingness to suller a major loss
of personal freedom, of respect
for the value of life and work and
of the ability to control one's own
destiny and growth.
And while decisions to post
pone professional development
until after cashing out are made
in one breath, little thought is
given to the fact that a Stanford
student, however brilliant and
promising, after four years of vir
tual stagnation, will be undoubt
edly struggling to distinguish
himself or herself from the mass
es of mediocrity. Rich or poor,
that is a daunting task to face.
just as troublesome is how stu
dents are abandoning even their
academic development for the
siren calls of start-ups. Juniors
decide that their senior year
would be a waste of time for now
anyway. Seniors figure that they
can just pretend to be in school
for a few quarters and get their
diploma while actually starting to
vvojk at a start-up. And graduate
and prospective graduate stu
dents are convinced that going
through the grind of graduate
school would be an obstacle

rather than a benefit.
By and large, they are all
wrong. They are underestimat
ing by a large margin the value of
education and of knowledge,
which is the most precious com
modity of the 21st century. These
students, with the complicity of
their employers, are being
thrown into responsibilities for
which they have neither the
preparation, knowledge, wisdom
or experience to carry out suc
cessfully.
They are not being told, and
they do not realize, that for the
most part start-ups are not learn
ing situations in a professional

sense. There is typically no one to
learn from, there is no company
history to show how quality prod
ucts come 112 rom quality processes,
and there are numerous in
stances of organizational chaos,
poor management and unadul
terated incompetence. Yet when
it comes to trade that for a Stan
ford education, there seems to be
little doubt of what is best. Small
impatiences ruin big plans in
deed.
Stock options also attack an
important fabric of our society;
something that the parents of
many Stanford students have in
stilled in them for years on end:
that education, hard work, dedi
cation, pel severance, honesty
and patience are virtues to be cul
tivated, and that those virtues will
bring great rewards to a person's
life.
I wonder, however, what
these students that are choosing
opportunism over anything else
will be able to tell their sons and
daughters when it comes a time
for these students to be teachers.
Certainly, they will lack a moral
base to lecture their kids on those
virtues of life, and even more ter

tainly, their kids will know that
and act accordingly.
Start-ups are guilty as well of
using stock options to play to the
lowest human emotions. Greed
of course is the most prominent
of those. Without a second
thought from the employers, stu
dents are presented with stories
of riches, with the urgency of a
small "window of opportunity"
that will soon close and with the
cold reality and hot urgency that
there are not six, four or even two
months to decide because every
thing is moving so fast.
There is rarely the realization
from the student, or perhaps the

self-confidence or business
savvy, that if a company re
ally wants you, none of
those rules apply. If they
just want a body to fill a
place, then all of those rules
apply. It defies my imagi
nation to understand why
anyone would consider
taking a job under those
circumstances. Yet, it hap-

pens every day; several times.
Stock options do have a place
and a healthy role. They should
be a vehicle for a company to
share its good fortune with those
who are responsible for it. They
should be part of a compensation
package and working environ
ment that are fair even if the op
tions turn out to be worthless.
They should be taken by stu
dents only within the context ol
fulfilling their professional and
personal values and goals. Hut
unfortunately, every day I see
less and less of this. 1 am afraid
that the poverty of soul and mind
that these options can one day
create for many students will
greatly surpass any richness of
the material kind that they will
receive.
