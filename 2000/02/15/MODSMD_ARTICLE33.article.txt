# Your Lives.com seeks to help young professionals succeed

In June many students will
graduate from Stanford and start
new jobs. When they leave, they
will have to do many new things for
themselves and will face unfamiliar
situations, such as how to ask a su
perior for a raise. Soon, these stu
dents will be able to access a Web
site called Your Lives.com for help.
Your Lives plans to offer a site to
assist college students beginning
their careers.
"Our goal is simple: To aid
young professionals as they navi
gate through the ever-changing
challenges, experiences, and re
wards of their lives," said co
founder Atukwe Newell, a senior in
Mechanical Engineering.
"Your Lives.com will provide
commerce, services and advice,"
helping young professionals to
manage all facets of their lives once
they have found a job, Newell said.
To cater to the many students
starting to work are living on their
own for the first time, the site will
offer practical living tips such as
how to cook meals. They will also
find hints about the workplace, like
ideas on getting promoted. In ad
dition there will be information on
entertainment and so-called "hot
spots" in different cities.
Besides offering advice to pro
fessionals, Your Lives will create
links with the companies for which
their subscribers work. Your Lives

will sell businesses a service that
provides new employees with ori
entation materials. A recently hired
employee will be able to log on to
his company's site at Your Lives

and order office supplies and busi
ness cards, fill out a W-2 tax sheet
and complete other lorms online
before beginning work.
Having access to this service will
allow new hires to start their jobs
and join projects immediately. In
the industry, Your Lives thus falls
under the category of a "business
to-business" company because it
sells a service to other businesses.
There are positive and negative
aspects to working at a start-up,
Gibson said. "It's a lot of work. It's a
pretty risky environment," he said.
On the other hand, he said that
he has "freedom, autonomy and
the possibility to have your idea
and turn it into reality." Overall,
Gibson said he thinks the good
points outweigh the bad points.
There is also a strong start-up
culture that is "aggressive, hard
charging [and] very big-pit ture ori
ented," Gibson said. While the peo
ple in this culture are close-knit, he
said, "It can be pretty hard to get
in." Also, being in such an environ
ment is humbling and "Ibices you

to do your best."
In November Your Lives en
tered an incubator program spon
sored by Conxion and IBM. While
still in its early development,
Your Lives will remain under the
support of Conxion's Dot Com in
cubator. The start-up is among 50
companies participating in the pro
gram.
Incubators provide resources
for fledgling companies. While
many such programs supply olfice
space and fulfill other business-re
lated needs, the Dot Com incubator
instead oilers start-ups technical
support, such as full server and
software use.
"This incubator is certainly the
largest technology incubator, if not
the only of its kind," said John
Seamster, director of Marketing at
Conxion.
The incubator provides approx
imately $1 million in software and
services horn companies that sup
port the program, Seamster said.
Conxion hosts servers and main
tains Internet infrastructure, while
IBM offers software, servers, train
ing and support. Other companies
support the program as well. One
company called Vignette produces
a web-development tool to allow
users to personalize Web sites.
Gibson said that there are three
main advantages to working under
the incubator. The first is that the
start-up has access to the knowl
edge of experienced businesspeo-

pie; the second is the
large contact network
within the incubator;
the third is the posi
tive public relations
garnered by such a
program. "It is easier
to raise capital and
easier to recruit peo
ple," he said.
In return, the
companies who offer
resources to the incu
bator have a chance of
earning the future
business of the start
ups. The program
does not require

commitment to use the supporting
companies' products. Instead they
want to establish "brand-comfort,"
according to lan Bonner, vice pres
ident of Global Business Partner
Marketing at IBM.
Through the incubator pro
gram, IBM introduces its technolo
gy to start-ups, hoping that after
they leave the incubator, the new
companies continue to use IBM
products.
Newell said that he also believes
the companies that offer services
and products to these start-ups "re
ally have an interest in entrepre
neurs being successful."
In addition, Newell said that if a
start-up begins developing its
product using certain programs, it
would probably continue using
those tools throughout its corpo

rate life. Hence, the supporting
companies can establish long-term
relationships with good potential
c lients, while also helping them.
"When [the start-up) launch[es],
they don't have to scrap their de
velopment effort and start over be
cause they used world-class tools
for the development phase," said
Megan O'Reilly-Lewis, senior pub
lic relations manager at Conxion.
Start-ups therefore do not have
to create a demo on one set of tools
and then begin again on another
set to develop the real version. Fur
thermore, start-ups can develop
their products more quickly on this
high-end software.
"We are in discussions with our
partners about designating pei ma
nent spots [in the incubator] for
qualified students," O'Reilly-Lewis

said, meaning thai there ma\ be a
student company in< hided in every
run ol the progi am.
Conxion and IBM do not select
start-ups lor the incubator. In
stead, their partners — Silicon Val
ley Bank and (iarage.com —
choose which applicants will pat tic -
ipate.
Seamster stresses that compa
nies in this program must have
thought seriously about a sophisti
cated business model liist.
In addition to Newell and C'.ib
son, Kevin Wilson, a senior in
Computer Science, and Bennie
Johnson, Ibrmer vice president of
marketing at Discovery /one, com
prise the companv. \fter gradua
tion, the members of Your Lives
plan to work (or the start-up lull
time, Newell said.
