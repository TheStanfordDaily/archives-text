# Nylon by MacGyver makes perfect sense
## 
### YAR WOO 
Let's face it— if the world were
an elementary school, most Hol
lywood villains would not be in
the gifted class. Despite ostensibly
having the smarts to pull off bil
lion-dollar heists and lipid entire
nations hostage, they neverthe
less display the reasoning abilities
of grated cheese when faced with
the relatively simple task of dis
patching secret agents tied se
curely to what look like ironing
boards, only more evil.
The bad guys in MacGyver are
no exception. The obvious thing
to do would be to trap MacGyver
in a room and leave bottles of
chemicals conveniently lying
around. The kicker, of course,
would be that the chemicals
would all be mislabeled, using the
provided conversion table (see
Figure 1):
My drawmate (a big MacGyver
fan) tells me that MacGyver
would be able to use his blood
hound-like sense of smell to sniff
out any phony labeling, but 1
have serious doubts about this.
Especially for the Folgers' Crys
tals.
Needless to say, the bad guys
never think of this, and instead
they let MacGyver loose with a
plethora of correctly labeled
chemicals that would put most

university labs to shame. In one
episode, MacGyver combines
bottles of adipic acid, hexaineth
ylene dianiene and iron filings to
make—and I'm sure you chem
majors are way ahead of me on
this one—( heez Wiz.
No, actually; he 112 uses these
chemicals to synthesize nylon, the
wonder polymer (literally, "many
mers") used in common house
hold items ranging from tennis
racquets to pantyhose.

REAL CHEMICAL FAKE LABEL
hydrochloric acid "poison antidote"
nitroglycerin "Cheez Wiz 1 M "
Folgers' Crystals "expensive European coffee"

But how scientifically sound is
MacGyver's nylon synthesis? For
the answer to this, 1 consulted the
Internet. It turns out that Mac-
Gyver's little process is how they
actually manufacture nylon in in
dustry. From what I understand,
the chemistry behind the reaction
works something like this:
Adipic acid has a carbonyl
group —an oxygen double bond
ed to a carbon. When two adipic
acid molecules meet, one of the
carbonyl oxygens donates a pro
ton to the other carbonyl oxygen.
This makes one of the carbonyl
oxygens slightly positive. Appar

ently, oxygen doesn't like to have
a positive charge, so to neutralize
itself, it draws electrons from its
attached carbon. Now, because
the carbon has fewer electrons
than normal, it now has a positive
charge.
Hexamethylene diamene, ,for
its part, has nitrogens stickiilg out
both ends. These nitrogens have
a free pair of electrons. The ni
trogen's free electrons are attract
ed to the positive carbon on the

figure 1
acid, so the hexamethylene di
aniene "attacks" the apidic acid,
though I doubt it's nearly as ex
citing as it sounds.
After a lot of electron shuf
fling, the end result is a nylon
dimer, which is a miniaturized
version of the eventual nylon
polymer. These dimers react with
each other to form increasingly
large chains. Eventually the re
sulting nylon clump becomes
large enough to be considered a
polymer.
And the iron filings? They
aren't necessary, but they act as
catalysts, which means that they

speed up the reaction without
being directly affected by it.
How about the experimental
evidence? Well, I vaguely re
member synthesizing nylon in
my freshman chemistry lab. I'm
not sure if this is exactly how we
did it. Plus, 1 think oun group
may have stretched a result here* 1
and there (I place all responsibil
ity for this on my lab partners),
but I'm willing to take Mac-
Gyver's word for this one. Ver
dict? Close enough.
I'm getting pretty sick of Mac -
Gyver, so next week I'll move on
to another topic. If anyone has a
TV show or movie they'd like an
alyzed, e-mail me at the address
