Small can indeed he beautiful.
Especially when we're talking
about fabricating tiny electro-me
chanical structures. Researchers in
the Ultrasonics Group of the Elec
trical Engineering Department
have developed tiny little devices
called capacitive micro-machined
ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs).
"This new technology has a
wide array of applications ranging
from under-water last cameras to
real-time medical imaging to
micro-machined printer jet
heads," said Electrical Engineer
ing Prof. Butrus (Pierre) Khuri-
Yakub, who oversees the group.
The underlying principle of the
CMUT is this. Imagine that you
have two electrically charged metal
plates, one of which is fixed. If you
change the charge on one of them,
then the other one moves closer or
farther depending on the polarity
of the charge. Now what il you
made the mobile plate lighter than
the fixed one and kept alternating
the polarity of the charge applied?
The lighter plate will start vibrat
ing and emit ultrasonic waves â€”
that is, vibrations too fast for us to
hear. CMUTs can thus be used as
ultrasonic transducers, which con
vert acoustic energy to electrical
energy and vice-versa.
Applications for the new trans
ducers include flow sensing, non
destructive testing of structures
and developing more efficient ink
jet heads for printers. The mass
produced transducers can also be
applied to existing fluid ultra
sound technologies, such as med
ical imaging. This would allow re
searchers to realize less expensive
and more efficient equipment.
"We can now detect defects in
materials without the need for
physical contact, which is required
by most of today's ultrasonic in
spection systems," said Sean
Hansen, a doctoral student work
ing in the group. Conventional
testing systems require fluid cou
pling, immersion or contact with

the sample. '! his breakthrough en
ables new applications of ultrason
ic inspection, such as the ability to
detect flaws in moving parts.
Conventionally, ultrasound is
generated using a piezo-electric
transducer. A piezo-electric device
simply consists of a crystal which
when deformed develops electric
charges. The reverse is also true.
That is, by subjecting the crystal to
an alternating electric field, we can
make it vibrate and emit sound
waves.
Researchers have conventional
ly found it difficult to work with ul
trasound because ultrasonic sig
nals weaken rapidly. In order for
these new devices to operate at
high frequencies, they must be
much smaller than today's piezo
electric transducers that can oper
ate only at low ultrasonic frequen
cies.
"MUTsoflera low cost, high ef
ficiency alternative to piezo-elec
tric devices. That's our promise,"
Khuri-Yakub said.
In order to produce these tiny
devices, micro-machining technol
ogy is required. Micro-machining
is simply manufacture of silicon
structures that have dimensions of
the order of micrometers. Micro
machined ultrasonic transducers
can emit and receive airborne ul
trasound waves at frequencies
much higher than current ultra
sonic transducers.
It is possible to fabricate arrays
of such devices using a simple
micro-machining process. These
arrays consist of hundreds of tiny
transducers, each about as wide as
a human hair and 100 times thin
ner than a sheet of paper. The ar
rays can be used to generate and
detect ultrasound.
CMUTs offer a more efficient
alternative to piezo-electric de
vices used in medical imaging ap
plications. Ihe piezo-electric crys

tal lias to be placed in contact with
the person and then moved to
look at the desired organ. But
what if a surgeon could insert a
tiny little detector into the artery
during a critical operation? This
would give him an inside view of
the patient's body, which he other
wise would have to only imagine.
It is not possible to achieve this
using a piezo-electric device.
CMUTs are ideal for such applica
tions.
"This technology will enable
real-time three-dimensional med
ical imaging systems in the fu
ture," Khuri-Yakub said. "It also
offers improved image quality, re
duced cabling requirements and
low cost disposable probes. With
the addition of on-chip electron
ics, these transducers represent
the most promising technology for
realizing high-quality, real-time
three-dimensional imaging sys
tems."
By coupling two CMUTs to
gether, tiny on-chip transformers
can also be realized. This is benefi
cial since conventional transform
ers are bulky and cumbersome to
interface with on-chip electronics.
"Pierre and I are really excited
about the prospects of this new de
vice," said Mohammed If. Badi, a
doctoral student working under
Khuri-Yakub. "Its key is its versa
tility in that depending on how it's
engineered, it can be anything
from a simple filter to au amplifi
er. This is definitely a revolution
ary idea."
The new technology has
opened up a wide range of new
applications that were previously
not possible. "We are very excited,
there is definitely a lot of cool stuff
going on here," said Dr. ArifSanli
Ergun, a Research Associate who
is currently working on finding
new detection techniques for
CMUTs.
