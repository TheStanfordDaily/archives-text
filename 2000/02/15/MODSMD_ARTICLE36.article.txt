# Researchers flirt with truth in Wonderfest 2000

### PADMA SUNDARAM 
Could we be alone in our part of
the galaxy? Could we be the only
technologically advanced society in
the universe? Are life supporting
worlds common in the cosmos? Is
the universe 11-dimensional?
This and other compelling scien
tific questions were the topic of de
bate at Wonderfest 2000, which
took place at Stanford, UCSF and
Berkeley February 12 and 13. The
non-profit educational project was
created by 112 licker Hiatt, a physics
teacher at the Branson school in
Ross, California.
At the science festival,, academic
scholars, scientists and researchers
addressed questions people may
think about but don't have the time
or inclination to investigate. The fes
tival, was themed "truth is a great
flirt."
The event gave the general pub
lic a look into current research in

fields such as astronomy, chemistry,
medicine and psychology. The festi
val consisted of a series of debates
between accomplished researchers
followed by questions from the au
dience.
Among t he invited speakers were
Frank Drake, who is President of
the Search for Kxtra Terrestrial In
telligence Institute and a professor
ai UC-Santa Cruz, Stanford Com
puter Science Profs. Nils Nilsson
and Jerry VVinograd, Stanford Psy
chiatry Prof. William. C. Dement
and Stanford Physics Prof. Stephen
Shell ker.
Founder Hiatt said he was in
spired to create Wonderfest by Carl
Sagan's book, " The Demon-1 faunt
ed World." The aim of Winterfest
was to "celebrate the scientific spir
it," he said.
"I am a science teacher, and I
love science. Sagan's book inspired
me to contribute to popularizing sci
ence. Wonderfest' 98 was a great
success, and I hope to make this a bi

ennial science festival," said 1 liatt.
At a Saturday afternoon session
at Stanford entitled "Is Intelligence
likely to evolve elsewhere in the uni
verse?," NASA scientist Christopher
McKay and Seth Shostak from SFTI
discussed the chances of the exis
tence of intelligent life elsewhere in
the universe.
They discussed why evolution
only occasionally produces intelli
gent beings.
"Dinosaurs were bulky, but not
exactly bright," McKay said. "After
all, dinosaurs had 200 million years
to learn and become intelligent.
Why didn't they develop intelli
gence?"
"Life is likely to be common. But
intelligence may be rare. Searching
is the only way to find out," McKay
concluded.
Shostak concurred. "So far no
extraten estial transmissions have
been found," he said. "While no ex
periment can prove we're alone,
SFTI experiments could show that

we're not."
One audience member asked,
"So if you scanned the galaxies for
another hundred years and still
didn't find any trace of life out there,
would it be a good time to throw in
the towel and say that we tried, but
didn't find anything?"
"I don't think this is a bounded
problem," McKay said. "No time is a
good time to stop. It's like Robinson
Crusoe. Everyday you wake up and
you search. And you never stop
searching."
Other topics explored during
the festival were "Can Machines
Think?," "Do we Understand the
Depth of Animal Awareness?" and
"Do Parents Matter?".
The two-day festival was spon
sored by New Scientist magazine,
Activate.net, Yahoo Inc., Media
Now, Tech-Star Industries and
Wind River systems. It also received
support from the David and Lucile
Packard foundation.
