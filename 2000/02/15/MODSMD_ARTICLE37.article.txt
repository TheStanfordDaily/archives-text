# Prevalent STDs affect student body

The high rate of sexual activity
and occurrence of unprotected sex
ual behavior contribute to c hlamy
dia, herpes and human papillo
mavirus, the three most common
STDs on the Stanford campus.
Immunology Assoc. Prof. Robert
Siegal, M.D., Ph.D., states, "One
thing that leads to the frequency of
the three is that all are capaple of
causing infections with mild or no
symptoms."
According to studies conducted
by the Center for Disease Control in
1990, 75 percent of females and 8(1
percent of males have engaged in
sexual intercourse by age 20. Fewer
than 40 percent of these adolescents
reported using condoms at last in
tercourse.
Those who have chlamydia, an
infection caused by the bacteria
Chlamydia trachomatis, may not
even be aware that they are infected.
Up to 90 percent of women and 25
percent of men with the infection are
asymptomatic, or show no symp
toms.
For women who have clinical
manifestations of disease, symptoms
include increased vaginal discharge
(with or without color or odor), pain
during intercourse, especially on
deep penetration, bleeding after in
tercourse, burning with urination
and fever.
For men, symptoms may include
penile discharge, itching at the end
of the penile opening, swelling of the
scrotum or lymph glands in the
groin, burning with urination and
frequent or urgent urination.
The use of condoms may prevent
the spread of chlamydia, and antibi
otics will cure this disease. Women
who are not treated may develop
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, or an
infection of the upper reproductive
tract.
IfPID is not treated appropriate
ly, 10 percent to 50 percent of affect
ed women will become sterile. I'll)
may not present symptoms, and if it
does, women may experience ab
dominal pain, pus-like vaginal dis-

charge and
fever.
Uncompli
cated cases of
PII) may be
cured with ad
ministration of
antibiotics, but
more severe
forms of the

disease may require hospitalization
and administration of intravenous
antibiotics.
Men who are left untreated are
also at a risk for infertility and other
genital complications.
Herpes simplex viruses, the
cause of herpes, enter the body
through the skin and mucous mem
branes of the mouth and genitals.
There exists many different strains
of the herpes virus that may cause
cold sores, genital sores, chicken
pox and shingles.
Of these, two types are transmitted
through sexual intercourse and oral
sex. Those infected with these two
types will experience mild tingling
and burning sensations before le
sions and watery blisters appear on
external and internal genitalia.
One to three days after the ap
pearance of lesions, they become
red, ulcer-like sores which eventual
ly crust over and heal.
Symptoms also include mild
fever, headache, muscle aches and
tender, swollen lymph nodes in the
groin or throat. Most infections heal
on their own.
Though there is no cure for her
pes, there are treatments that may
relieve symptoms. These treatments
include pain relievers and an anti
viral drug called Acyclovir. Wearing
loose clothing helps the blisters and
lesions heal.
Intercourse should be avoided if
watery blisters and lesions are pre
sent. In addition, eating utensils,
clothing, towels and washcloths
should not be shared.
Since chlorine bleach kills the
herpes virus, it should be used in the
laundry and on toilet seats, bathtubs
and eating utensils to further pre
vent the spread of infection.

II the lesions have turned into
sores, condoms cannot be relied
upon as protection against transmis
sion if they do not cover the sores
completely.
In addition to being one of the
three most common STDs on Stan
ford campus, human papilloma
virus is the most common STD in the
U.S. There are many subtypes of the
virus that causes warts and lesions in
various areas of the body. HPV6,II,
1() and 18 are a ome of the subtypes
that are associated with genital infec
tion.
Most infections are asympto
matic, and those that do present clin
ical symptoms will manifest as le
sions, lumps or irregularities on the
skin surface. In women, warts can
persist in the vagina and on the
cervix.
"The incidence of 11PV is close to
50% among sexually active women,"
said Siegal.
Condoms do not prevent trans
mission of 11PV since it may be
spread by skin to skin contact.
The virus may exist on areas not
protected by condoms, such as the
scrotum and pubic area, and rub
bing of these areas may facilitate the
spread of infection.
The reason why regular Pap
smears are important for women is
because IfPV infection is wide
spread and is strongly associated
with cervical cancer. According to
the World Health Organization,
HPV is found in more than 95 per
cent of cervical cancer cases.
Pap smears can detect changes in
cervical cells and abnormalities
caused by genital warts. Other can
cers associated with HPV include
cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus
and penis.
