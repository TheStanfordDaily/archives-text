# Stanford may own streets of Reno, Nev.
## 
### MARISA PAVLIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Due to Leland Stanford's hand
in creating the city of Reno in 1868,
Stanford University may own part
of Reno's streets.
Litigation between the city of
Reno and the downtown casinos
over air rights in Reno led to the dis
covery that the streets may belong to
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia schools. Stanford and the UC
schools, as the heirs of the men who
first created Reno, are named in the
lawsuit.
A judge is currently considering
the case, which says that Stanford
has a claim to twenty-five percent of
the disputed streets, the UC schools
fifty percent and the last quarter's
ownership is unknown.
" 1 his is one of the strangest cases
I've known about," said Debra
Zumwalt, who, as acting general
counsel for Stanford, is involved in
all Stanford legal cases.
1 he case began with a dispute be
tween the city and the casinos over
air rights. Casinos built skywalks

from parking garages to the build
ings over streets and challenged the
city when Reno made them pay
lease for the air space.
In an effort to figure out exacdy
who had lights to the streets of
Reno, the city decided to settle own
ership of the streets once and for all.
"This litigation is attempting to
settle everybody's rights once and
for all, so every possible claim has
been brought in," said Carol Dillon,
Stanford's lawyer in Palo Alto.
The city expected the schools to
file quit-claim deeds, giving up any
possible property rights to the
streets. However, neither Stanford
nor the UC system did so.
"We're a trust and we have a duty
to look into things," Zumwalt said.
"We didn't file the suit, but we can't
just give away assets. We have to
look into the possible worth and
ownership."
Michael Chapman, a Reno
lawyer hired by the city, said that if
the schools filed the quit-claim deed,
"that would have made things sim-
I'le"
"In my opinion, Stanford has no
rights but in order to completely
dear the title, we formally have to
list them," (lhapman said.
"It's a long story, but the bottom
line is that the I diversity doesn't
own anything and judgment needs
to relied that." (lhapman said.
Stanford and the I'd schools
jointh hired a local lawyer in Reno
to request discovery and find out
mot e information.

"The city of Reno brought us in,"
Dillon said. "We were named in
lawsuit and had to respond to ac
tion by hiring lawyer in Reno."
"Stanford is a charitable trust
and the Board of Trustees obligat
ed to maintain, preserve and pro
tect assets," Dillon said. "To give
something up without evaluating
what it means wouldn't be a pru
dent way to handle obligations as a
trust."
Dillon said the litigation is an at
tempt to answer the questions:
"Since ('.rocker didn't give streets to
the city, what does it mean? If it
wasn't done the way it's normally
done, what does it mean?"

In modern times, a developer
designs a subdivision and then of
fers the streets up for public dedica
tion.
"Most cities are not laid out by a
robber baron and parceled off ," Dil
lon said. I lowever, 132 years ago, a
group of four businessmen, Leland
Stanford, Mark Hopkins, Charles
Crocker and Collis Huntington,
created Reno as their railroad com
panies moved across Nevada.
Crocker of the Central Pacific Rail
road plotted out the streets and
parceled out the land.
"He sold property, but it's un
clear il he ever gave the streets to
the city," (lhapman said.
