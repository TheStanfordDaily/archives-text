# Political Science as usual?
## Department moves to Encina for safety; draws mixed reactions 
### ANI KHONDKARYAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Department of Political
Science will move from Build
ing 160 in the Quad to Encina
West in August 2000.
Lncina West will become the
permanent home for the de
partment, according to Political
Science Prof. Barry Weingast.
"It takes a while lor people to
get accustomed to a new place,"
said | ay Cross, staff associate for
facilities and sponsored pro
jects. "But the relocation will be
as smooth as can be expected."
The Department's move to
Lncina West will create a social
sciences cluster, since the Insti
tute of International Studies is
located in Lncina Last and Lnci
na Central and the Economics
Department is located across
the street from Lncina, in Lan
dau.
Another reason for the move

is that tlic University must make
sure that Building 160 complies
with earthquake safety provi
sions.
Because Building 160 has
unreinforced masonry, it must
be seismically upgraded In Sep
tember 2000 to comply with
Santa Clara County rules.
The University will start ren
ovations in August.
In eighteen months to two
years, when renovations are
complete, the building will
house the new Stanford Learn
ing Lab, which focuses on im
proving the undergraduate
learning experience at Stanford
through learning technology.
According to Ora Hurd, ad
ministrative services manager,
the relocation will be "expedi
ent." The entire department
will be transferred at once.
Moving consultants will talk
with all the people who work in
the building about how they
want their new workspace set
up. According to Cross, the
moving consultants will pack up
bookcases and move just about


Encina Hall
will become
the home of
the Political
Science De
partment after
their move
next summer,
joining a so
cial sciences
cluster of
buildings.

everything.
" I he Political Science Depart
ment members associate with the
jtiembei s of the Institute of Inter
national Studies," Weingast said.
After the move, it v\ ill be easier for
the departments to work together
since they will be in closer quar
ters.
"Mam of them also have ap
pointments at the Iloover Institu
tion. and now they'll be closer,"
Weingast said.
Most students welcome the
move.
. "Building Mi() is about the
worst building on campus," said
junior Shelli Carol, a political sci
ence major. "Although Kncina
West is more removed from the
campus than the previous loca
tion, ilie Institute of International

Studies is already ai Kncina, so it
will be beneficial because a lot of
my professors have their offices
there already."
But some students are not as
convinced that the relocation will
be a positive change.
"1 liked having the Political Sci
ence Department close to tin- his
tory corner," said senior David
Countryman who is majoring in
political science and economics."I
feel like the economics building is
getting segregated. And-in Knci
na, you don't get to meet as many
other people who are majoring in
anything other than political st i
ence or related majors."
"I think it would be more con
venient for the students if they just
renovated the building and let us
stay," said senior Si-Eun Sung who
is majoring in political science and
history. "A lot of the political s< i
ence majors are also taking classes
outside their department for their
major, such as history, sociology,
and psychology."
