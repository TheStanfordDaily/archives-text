# Hoover Institution donates Reagan papers
## Nancy Reagan asks to have all Reagan's papers in one place 
### AMIT GARG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last week, the Hoover Institution formally
donated former President Ronald Reagan s
gubernatorial papers to the- Reagan Presiden
tial Library in Simi Valley. 1 he donation has
become an issue of contention among certain
members of the Institution.
The request to have the archive moved
came from Nancy Reagan.
"Mrs. Reagan asked (Hoover Institution

Direc tor) John Raisian to have all of Mr. Rea
gan's papers in one place," said Deputy Direc
tor and C '.liief Archivist Charles Palm.
It was "a nice, honest request," Raisian told
I lie San Franc isco Examiner.
I he request was approved alter consulting
with the I loover Board of ()verseersand Pres
ident (ierhard Clasper.
1 hough the 47 boxes of paper were
shipped away, the Hoover Institution is
"keeping the information content here," re
marked Palm.
" I he arrangement is that we will keep a mi
crofilm copy of the core, which is ol most re
search value."
Not everyone approved though.

Emeritus Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell, who was tlu* Institution's director
between 1960 and 1989, sent a complaint let
ter to Casper regarding the decision.
"Reagan is suffering from Alzheimer's. Do
you think Nancy even talked to him about
this?" he said.
" The papers are going to .1 place where
they will be seen even less. Sinn Valley is 100
miles from any place of importance."
According to Campbell, the papers are
worth $20 million.
"I know the informational content will stay
here, but so what? I lie gubernatorial papers
are gone."
Campbell initially brought the
Reagan papers to 1 foover in 1975

and tried unsuccessfully to estab
lish the Reagan Presidential Li
brary at Stanford.
Palm said, " I he decision was
not an easy one. I am comfortable
though because there were other
considerations which we took
into account."

I fowever, Campbell disagrees.
"I was not called in the decision
making. It was an act of conffjete
cowardice. They knew what ljiv re
action was going to be. I [spent
good years of my life defending
this place and now, nobody of im
portance knows about it,"he said.
