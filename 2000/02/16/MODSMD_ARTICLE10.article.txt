# Admissions reconsiders Admit Weekend guidelines
## 
### ANNE CORTINA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Admissions ()ffice is consid
ering a more moderate tone for its
proposed behavior guidelines for
prospective freshmen on Admit
Weekend, in response to current
students' concerns.
On Feb. 9, Lirkin staff'members
published a letter to the editor in
the Daily taking issue with the tone
and content of the guidelines.
"In addition to being insulting
and deterring attendance," the let
ter stated, "these guidelines threat
en important underlying values of
this University. Unlike the rest of
the year, the administration expects
residential staffs to lx- police that
weekend."
After becoming aware of the sin
dents' concerns, 112 lolly Haley
Knapp, assistant dean of under
graduate admission, met with

Larkin Resident Fellow Stephen to
let the students know iheir ideas
were being considered.
"1 wanted him to let them know
that due to their student input, we
were going to go back and re-re
view the language that was used in
these guidelines," Haley Knapp
said. "We took into consideration
the current students' feelings about
the tone."
Alex Newell, a resident
assistant and one of the letter-writ
ers, said that "we are not opposed to
having them sign something."
"Our disagreement was with the
language" of the original behav
ioral contract, she said. "Students
come here under agreement with
the Fundamental Standard," she
continued, and are expected to Ix--
have accordingly.
Along the same lines, I.arkin RA
Michael Cummings said that abid
ing by the Fundamental Standard

is "all we can ask of admits."
The Larkin resident assistants
were most concerned with the "po
lice" role the new guidelines pre
scribed for them.
Unlike other universities such as
UC-Berkeley and the University of
Washington, RAs at Stanford are
not required to enforce alcohol reg
ulations on behalf of the University
or law enforcement. Stanford has
traditionally encouraged RAs and
residents to cooperate with each
other Twenty-two points, plus
triple-word-score, plus fifty points
for using all my letters. Game's
over. I'm outta here.when, for ex
ample, a resident may have had too
much to drink.
According to Haley Knapp, RAs
are not expected to behave any dif
ferently with the prospective fresh
man than they do with their resi
dents.
"There isn't a policing role," she

said. "It's to remind them that they
have signed these guidelines."
"The guideline is there which
talks about.. . that they are expect
ed to adhere to the Fundamental
Standard."
Sonal Rana, a freshman who at
tended Admit Weekend last year
and is a House Host in Cedro this
year, believes that current students
know to l(X)k out for prospective
freshmen.
"I think the RoHos and Hollos
and RAs know not to send the pro
fros out into the evil world all on
their own," she said.
The guidelines were designed to
prevent a recurrence of last year's
incident in which a prospective
freshman had to be rushed to the
hospital due to alcohol poisoning,
though they are just one of many
steps the Admissions Office is tak
ing.
"I think there's a growing na

tional concern about alcohol and
college students and high school
students going into college," I laley
Knapp said. "It's not just because of
[that | incident."
Applicant Isaac Kohn of Chica
go doesn't have a major problem
with the guidelines, though he is
concerned about the impression it
gives the students.
"My general feeling is that that
kind of thing isn't inappropriate
and it's reasonable for people's ex
pectations to be made clear," he
said. "It is going to lx* people's first

impression of the school. I don't
think it's necessarily bad, but peo
ple are very likely g( >ing to see it that
they don't expect enough maturi
ty-"
Overall, I laley Knapp is glad the
students were open with their con
cerns. "We feel like students have
had positive input in making a
change," she said. "It's unfortunate
our first draft was viewed as being
heavy-handed."
