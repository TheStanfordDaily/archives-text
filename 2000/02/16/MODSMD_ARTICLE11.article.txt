## Vatican & PLO sign agreement 
### 
VATICAN CITY (AP) — The
Vatican joined the Palestinians
yesterday in condemning Israel's
hold over all of Jerusalem as
"morally and legally unaccept
able," aggravating the Israelis just
a month before the pope's \ isit to
the Holy Land.
An agreement signed by the
Vatican and Palestinian officials
called for an internationally guar
anteed statute to preserve "the
proper identity and sacred charac
ter" of the city, which is holy to
Jews, Christians and Muslims.
The text did not mention Israel
by name, but the Jewish suite has
consistently considered Jerusalem
its indivisible capital since it
annexed the eastern section fol
lowing the 1967 Mideast War.
The Vatican, like many states,
has never recognized Israel's occu
pation of eastern Jerusalem. The
final status of the city is to be
decided in talks between Israelis
and the Palestinians, acknowl
edged as one of the most difficult
points in the entire peace process.
The strong wording in yester
day's bilateral agreement
appeared to take the Israelis by
surprise.
The Foreign Ministry said the
Vatican's representative in Israel
has been asked to come to an
"urgent meeting" today to discuss
the matter.
"Israel flatly rejects the refer
ences to Jerusalem in the afore
mentioned document," the Israeli
Foreign Ministry saitl in a state
ment. "Jerusalem, was, is, and
shall remain the capital of the
State of Israel; and no agreement
or declaration «al|pse 01 any
other parties will change this fact."
Zvi Till, spokesman for Israel's
embassy to the Holy See, said that
while the Vatican's stance was
known, yesterday's action
amounted to interference in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotia
tions. He also said the Palestinians
appeared to have breached an
agreement with Israel limiting the
types of further agreements they
could make.
The accord signed yesterday
covers the Vatican's relations with
the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion and the status of churches
and freedom of worship in the
Palestinian territories.
It was signed on the same day
that Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat met with Pope John Paul II
and offered a last-minute invita
tion — accepted by the pope — to
add another Palestinian city, Jeri
cho, to his Holy itinerary,
which already includes Bethlehem
and a Palestinian refugee camp.
