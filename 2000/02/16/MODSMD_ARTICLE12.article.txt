HARARK, Zimbabwe — Vot
ers delivered President Robert
Mugabe his first electoral defeat
in 20 years by rejecting a revised
constitution that would have
safeguarded his autocratic and
increasingly unpopular rule, ref
erendum results demonstrated
yesterday.
The vote of no confidence in
Mugabe's government embold
ened the opposition. The Move
ment for Democratic Change,
the main opposition group,
called for the government to
resign.
"In a normal democracy, if a
government loses a referendum
it loses its power to rule and is
no longer legitimate. But this is
not a democracy," said Morgan
Tsvangirai, the opposition
group's leader.
In a television broadcast late
yesterday, Mugabe accepted
defeat.
"The government accepts the
results and respects the will of
the people," he said. "Let us all,
winners and losers, accept the
referendum verdict and start
planning our way to the future."
Mugabe spoke in an unchar
acteristically conciliatory tone.
Responding to the high turnout
among the nation's 70,000
whites. He said they appeared to
have shrugged off apathy
toward political participation.
"I hope this can be extended
to other national events and
processes," he said.
Election officials announced
final results yesterday. Fifty-five
percent of voters rejected
Mugabe's proposed changes,
while 45 percent voted in favor
during Saturday's vote.
The constitutional changes
woulcMiave allowed Mugabe to
retain most of his powers, rule
for two more five-year terms
and permit the government to
seize land owned by white
descendants of British settlers
without paying compensation.
The vote was an indication of
Mugabe's waning popularity as
the nation faces its worst eco

nomic c risis since independence
from British colonial rule in
1980.
"This is a 'no to corruption,
unemployment and suffering. It
says enough is enough, its time
for democratic change," said
jubilant opposition official I ddie
Monteiro. "We want elections
tomorrow."
Parliamentary elections are
scheduled lot early April.
Mugabe's Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front
party has dominated p;ist elec
tions, winning landslide victories
in every poll since indepen
dence. It holds all hut three seats
in the 150-member Parliament.
But Mugabe, 75, has faced
growing criticism at home and
from Western nations for his
authoritarian rule. Economic
hardships worsened sharply
after he sent 11,000 troops to
support embattled Congolese
President Laurent Kabila.
The International Monetary
Fund froze aid to Zimbabwe last
year, citing unexplained mili
tary expenses in the Congo
while government spending on
health, education and social ser
vices declined.
The tails' was 097,754 votes
against the constitutional
changes, with 578,210 in favor.
About one fourth of the nation's
5 million eligible voters cast
their ballots.
During the weekend voting,
lines for scarce kerosene, used by
the poor for cooking, lighting
and heating, were longer than
those at polling booths. Short
ages of gasoline and power
blamed on economic misman
agement by the government
have crippled transpou, agric ul
lure and £< viecjm
months, filiation ancl unem
ployment have soared to record
levels.
The National Constitutional
Assembly, an alliance of political
opposition groups and civic and
church organizations, said it w ill
not pursue allegations of vote
rigging Instate election officials.
