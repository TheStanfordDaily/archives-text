# Holocaust insurance claims will soon be accepted

### 
WASHINGTON (AIM — An internation
al commission began a long-awaited pro
gram yesterday to settle insurance claims
never paid to Holocaust victims or their
heirs.
The International Commission on Holo
caust Era Insurance (llaiins said people who
believe they have claims would have two
years to apply. It was planning a newspaper
ad campaign and setting up telephone cen

ters in 41 countries to help those who
believe they have such claims, said the
panel's chairman, former Secretary of State
Lawrence S. Eagleburger.
Eagleburger said he didn't know how
many people have such claims or how much
they're owed overall. But he said some have
estimated it could cost up to several billion
dollars to pay them back under the negoti
ated agreement that they get 10 times the

original value of their policy.
" Today is about justice . . . for some of
the victims of the most horrible crime in the
history of the world," said Glenn Pomeroy,
North Dakota's insurance commissioner
and a member of the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners, which helped
create the commission two years ago.
The program is for any Holocaust vic tim
who owned, was covered by or was the ben

eficiary of a polio toi lift- insirance, educa
tion or dowry issued between 1920 and
1945.
Officials have said some survivors or
heirs who tried to collect on policies after
World War II went unpaid because insurers
asked for documentation such as policies or
death certificates — something impossible
to produce lor most concentration camp vic
tims or their survivors.
