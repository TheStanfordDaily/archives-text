BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) — Stung by
Britain's decision to suspend Northern Ireland's
power-sharing government, the IRA deepened
the province's political crisis today by breaking oil
negotiations on disarmament.
In a hard-line statement, the Irish Republican
Army accused Britain and the province's major
Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, of ignoring
its disarmament proposals.
"Both the British government and the leader
ship of the Ulster Unionist Party have rejected the
propositions put to the (disarmament commission)
by our representative. They obviously have no
desire to deal with the issue of arms except on
their own terms," the IRA said.
It was the IRA's failure to disarm that triggered
the recent crisis, leading Britain to suspend North
ern Ireland's lledgling Protestant-Catholic gov
ernment Friday.

I lours alter the suspension, the IRA suggested
it would be prepared to put its weapons stockpiles
"beyond use" in certain political circumstances —
a euphemism lor disarmament. That shift broke
new ground lor the IRA, but it fell short of the
clear-cut commitments being sought by the Ulster
Unionists. In its statement today, the IRA said it
was withdrawing the oiler.
I lie IRA statement exacerbated a political crisis
that began when the province s disarmament com
mission reported Jan. 31 that the IRA had not
begun giving up its weapons.
"I am disappointed at the IRA's decision,
because I believe this is a time when all channels
need to be kept open," said Britain's Northern
Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson.
The province's lledgling local administration
took power more than two months ago, ending 28
years of direct rule bv Britain.
