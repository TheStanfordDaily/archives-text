COLUMBIA, SC. (AP) — Fac
ing their final debate before the
make-or-break South Carolina
primary, John McCain turned
philosophical yesterday while
George W. Bush tried to trump
him with a rival plan to overhaul
campaign financing.
McCain told an audience in
Irmo: "I'm as interested in how
this campaign is judged as I am in
winning or losing. I've always had
a sense of history."
Bush used his own appearance
in the town to roll out a six-point
plan that repackaged some of his
previous campaign finance pro
posals and included a new one:
prohibiting federally registered
lobbyists from donating to law
makers while Congress is still in
session.
