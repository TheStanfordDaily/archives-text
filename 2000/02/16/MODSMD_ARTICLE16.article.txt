## THERE IS NO SPOON Building a better baby 
### 
While still basking in the glow
of this past Valentine's Day,
which I spent most of in bed
— by myself, I ran across
that full-page "give the gilt of love" ad in
The Daily.
But rather than selling chocolates or
roses or diamond rings, this ad asked for a
"veiy special egg donor" (as opposed to all
the average, everyday egg donors out
there).
After ransacking the paper for match
ing sperm donor ads, I decided to pose
this question to a female: given the

surgery and moral
implications, would you
sell your eggs for
$1 ()(),()()()?
(In retrospect, it
makes sense there's no
analogous deal for guys;
otherwise, you'd have a
new breed (pun intend
ed) of sixteen-year-old
multimillionaires.) So I
called my sister.

Alter pic king herself up off'the kitchen
floor, she wanted to know where she could
sign up and if I was sure about the
$100,000. (My sister's pretty cheap — she
would've done it for $50,000.)
But then I read the next part: "Our
donor will have the following qualities:
Caucasian — under 30 years old, athlete
for athletic family, proven college level
athletic ability preferred — family wait
ing."
Intellectually, I understand the motiva
tion of wanting a baby that would match
your family and your family's lifestyle.
But, regardless, the listing of donor
requirements seems a bit chilling.
It's almost like going down El Camino
and ordering a baby at the "Baby in a
Box" drive-thru.
"Hi, I'd like ... umm ... a girl baby
with blonde hair and blue eyes .. . and, oh
yeah, good at sports and a 1300 SAT
score."
"Would you like a predisposition for
music with that?"
"Umm . . . wait a sec . .. honey, do we
care about music? No? Okay ... yeah, we
don't need the music thing."
"Okay then, that'll Ix- one Aryan Alice
Happy Ova Kit to go."
"Super-sized, please."
I am sensitive to the needs of infertile
couples, but I guess what bothers me is
that the proliferation of ads like the one in
The Daily seem catered towards "Building
a Better Baby" with shades of "1981,"
Aldous Huxley and Nazi Germany.
They aren't looking to match a family's
characteristics to get a baby that "fits in" to
the family as much as they are looking to

match a family's desires for"the perfect
baby," whether the family is "perfect" or
not. And as those of us with younger sib
lings know, what a family wants in a child
can be very different from what a family
gets.
After looking at the Web site featured
on the advertisement, the requirements
listed read more like general guidelines
for all donors than one specific family's
wishes. (1 doubt that there are roomfulsof
childless, athletic white couples all coinci
dentally waiting for that rare and elusive
athletic white egg donor.)
And while I sympathize with parents
wanting the best for their baby, just
because you want an Olympic hraniac
doesn't necessarily give you license to mix
one up in a petri dish.
I did find a more inclusive egg donor
ad for "all races" buried in The Daily clas
sifieds, but they only offered $5,000.
Racial politics aside, assigning economic
costs to physical characteristics seems dicey
at best.
Who's going to eventually determine
which chromosomes are worth more and
will that decision be based on?
Will beauty just be another perk for the
rich? ("Wow You're only 5 f<x>t 4 inches?
Your parents must've been poor.")
Perhaps we're not that far away from
Aniazon.com selling supermodel eggs
alongside e-bay kidneys. (Books. Music.
Video. And now introducing Human
()rgans.)
Probably because my only experience
in egg donation is when the aliens har
vested Scully's reproductive organs on
" The X-Files," I find the whole idea — to
put it mildly — a bit creepy.
With bioengineering cjni< kly becoming
the hot new science discipline and the
identification of the human genome a
reality, creating an Ulx'rbaby is not-that
far a stretch.
Yes, the surgery is fully invasive. Hor
mone therapy lasts a year after the opera
tion and some women have experienced
problems in future pregnancies.
But $100,000 is a lot of money. It's like
twelve questions on "Who WANTS To Be
A Millionaire?" without having to deal
with Regis. It's like four years at Stanford.
Or three months rent in Palo Alto.
Still, although 1 definitely am not the
person to say whether or not egg donation
is worth it for you, 1 know that it's not for
me.
