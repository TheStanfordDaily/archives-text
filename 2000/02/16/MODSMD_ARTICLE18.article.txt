More thoughts on abortion
This letter is in response to Mr. Noel
D'Angelo's statements, published in The
Daily on Feb. 14. He states, "To absorb
the horror of abortion, one need only
look at a picture of an aborted fetus. If this
does not dissuade someone from support
ing a woman's 'light to choose,' I don't
know of anything that will."
I completely agree that the photos are
horrible and that the processes used are
barbaric. But emphasizing this ad nause
-unit as many- anti-chnice activists do, will
not be nearly as effective as educating
people, especially young teenagers, on
birth control methods instead of empha
sizing that abstinence is the best way.
That nothing else is 100 percent effec
tive is given and must be emphasized, but
not over everything else. Trying to make
peoples' minds up for them merely
encourages them not to think for them
selves, which in turn reduces their capa
bility to make mature, rational decisions
when accidents happen.
In addition, I think he misunderstands
the pro-choice concern about women
being forced to get illegal abortions. No
one has ever claimed that abortion is com
pletely safe — of course there's a risk of
dying! It's much like carrying a child to
term in that way.
It cannot be denied, however, that a
woman has a much better chance of sur

viving when she can visit a licensed medi
cal doctor who, in addition to using sani
tary tools, can prescribe drugs to reduce
the risk of bleeding and infection.
D'Angelo goes on to say, "1 fail to see
how one can be against abortion and yet
support a person's right to choose abor
tion." Well, that's really quite simple.
Imagine that you or someone you loved
found out that they were pregnant.
For the sake of argument, and since this
debate was sparked by a Stanford group,
we'll assume she is a student — graduate
or undergraduate,-even high school, it
really doesn't matter. She lias very few
choices, and none of them are good.
She can carry the baby to term and
become a young, unprepared mother
who is unable to support her child and
who may or may not have the benefits of
a supportive partner or family to help her.
She could also put the baby up for adop
tion, which entails caring for someone for
nine months, going through painful
labor, and then giving the child up to
someone else.
Either way, she will most likely have to
drop out of school, at least temporarily.
Then there's abortion, which, as you so
graphically illustrated, is a terrible ordeal.
What would I do if I wdre in such a situa
tion? 1 honestly do not know, and I intend
to make sure that I never have to make
that decision.
Unfortunately, the majority of the pop

illation has not had access to the educa
tion that 1 have and, as a result, have not
thought clearly about what could happen
and what they would have to do if it did.
Abortion IS, unfortunately, about con
trol of a woman's body. Although, techni
cally, the difference in DNA and blood
type makes the fetus a unique individual,
it cannot be a completely distinct entity
until it is capable of surviving 011 its own.
1 find it deeply ironic that, in a civilized
society such as ours, the rights of a fetus
are often considered more important
than those of'tlie-fully sentient lieing who
is risking her lite for it.
