# FROM APATHY TO ACTIVISM
## South Asians as activists 
### MEGHANA REDDY GUEST COLUMNIST 
Editor's Note: This is the first in a rotating col
umn series that will explore issues of activism at
Stanford.

Body-vibrating rhythms spill from
the door of the ballroom of Old
Union. Thrilling and intense
war cries can be heard above the
rumbling beats.
The dimly lit room is filled with a trop
ical heat that is radiating from the leap
ing, lunging, rocking, thumping, kicking
and screaming bodies of what appears to
be a group of South Asian students, their
limbs flailing to the pounding rhythms of
the dlwl. I enter the circle and am over
come by a wild flurry of sharp elbows and
dry-skinned knees.
Sanskriti, a South Asian association on
campus, is holding a workshop for new
members on a modern Indian dance
known as bhangra, a necessary tool for
any South Asian-American to prove that
they have not been entirely consumed by
mainstream society. Of course, the circle
of South Asian students does not recog
nize the obvious ridiculousness of this

claim.
Observing these South Asian students
dancing to Indian beats in their New Bal
ance sneakers, cargo pants and fleece
vests, I feel as if 1 am watching a really bad
ethnic GAP advertisement: Khaki swing,
Khaki groove, Khaki Bhangra.
But, according to Sanskriti, this is what
it means to be South Asian: bouncing to
bhangra music, along with eating exclu
sively at South Asian restaurants when
with South Asian friends, preparing high
ly predictable musical and dance perfor
mances for various religious festivals,
socializing with other South Asians in sti
fling cliques, and majoring in engineering
or computer science.
Although this is certainly part of being
South Asian, it definitely isn't all. It seems
as if the members of Sanskriti are so fear
ful of being seen as "coconuts" (brown on
the outside, white on the inside) that San
skriti defines what it means to he South
Asian in a context that can be easily
accepted by the majority of America. This
restricts "Asian-ness" to stereotypes and
those qualities most obviously ass<xiated
with the homeland.
"Yes, I am South Asian because I can
distinguish between a sitar and a veena!"

"Yes, I am South Asian because I eat spicy
curry dishes!" "Yes, I am South Asian
because I know the names of all the East
ern religions!"
But why does being South Asian not
mean becoming involved in political
issues concerning South Asians and other
minorities in America or discussing
racism and violence towards and within
the South Asian community? Why does
being South Asian not include trying to
understand the problems that different
generations of South Asians face in the
U.S. or demanding an expansion of
South Asian studies on campus?
By seeing itself through the eyes of
majority America, Sanskriti is directly lim
iting its role and function, both on this
campus and in society. If Sanskriti per
petuates the image of "South Asian-ness"
as being nothing more than eating, con
versing, singing and dancing, how will
South Asians ever be able to force Ameri
ca to see protesting, discussing, strug
gling, adapting, fighting and understand
ing as also being a part of the South Asian
people?
This is not to say that Sanskriti does not
attempt to become involved in the com
munity. Indeed, Sanskriti provides tutor
ing and guidance to South Asian children
in the area and assists in bringing a range
of speakers to campus.
But, even within this context, Sanskriti

only becomes involved in social and cul
tural events that show the South Asian
community in a favorable light, reluctant
to address the inequity, conflict and
aggression that South Asian people in
America must deal with.
The reality of the situation is that sig
nificant problems plague the South Asian
community. I hate to disillusion all those
young South Asians out there but, HEY!
We are NO T a model minority! We still
have to fight to even have a voice in Amer
ican society! We have violence, gangs,
poverty, drugs, and sexual promiscuity in
our community! We experience active
racism and discrimination! We are still
outside of the American system!
We are not immune to tragedy. Wealth
and University life might distance San
skriti from the real problems with which
South Asians, both in America and Asia,
battle. This does not mean, however, that
an association made up of South Asians
and dedicated to the South Asian com
munity should not at least discuss issues
impacting their community in hopes of
raising awareness.
Admittedly, Sanskriti makes no defi
nite claims to be an activist group â€” it is
a social organization. However, because
Sanskriti is the largest South Asian orga
nization on campus, the Stanford com
munity is likely to regard it as represen
tative of the South Asian population,

whether that is fail or not.
As a result of its prominence and influ
ence in the community, Sanskriti has an
obligation to be more than just a social
organization. It is a social group, but per
haps it should consider broadening its
horizons to do justice to its perceived role
as Stanford's most representative South
Asian organization.
Fortunately, Sanskriti has the authority
and resources to change both how the
organization is perceived on campus and
how they themselves understand what it
means to be a South Asian in America.
Individually, there are many Sanskriti
members who are taking on amazing
tasks. These people must demand that
Sanskriti become more involved in social
issues that are significant to the South
Asian community.
Even though activities such as creating
a "Sanskriti Dating Service" is an essential
fundraising endeavor for this South Asian
organization, 1 hope that Sanskriti will
eventually take more seriously their role
as the voice of South Asian students on
this campus.
