# 6 percent increase in tuition slated for next year
## Trustees boost financial aid by $6 million, loosen aid eligibility rules and decrease student contribution 
### KIMBERLY DOWNS EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Board of Trustees increased undergraduate
tuition and room and board In 5 percent for the
2000-2001 academic year at their meeting yesterday.
The hoard also decided to increase student finan
cial assistance by nearly $6 million in order to ensure
that admitted students are able to attend. After the
decision to raise tuition by 3.5 percent lor the 1999-
2000 academic year, the board approved only
$500,000 in additional aid.
Taken separately, undergraduate tuition for next
year will increase by 0 percent to $24,441 from last
year's price tag of $23,058. Room and board will in
crease by 1.9 percent from $7,781 to $8,030.
The increased aid the Uiirdj^waoAUrive

year that Stanford has in
creased the amount of
money available for finan
cial aid. A press relase issued
by the Board of Trustees
said the amount students on
financial aid pay will not in
crease as long as their fami
lies' financial capability does
not change.
"Stanford has been one
of the primary contributors
to the technologies that are
the foundation of the new
economy," said Robert
Bass, chairman of the
board.

"Because the new technology is centered largely
in Silicon Valley, Stanford and the valley have mutu
ally benefited from each other's presence. That pres
ence has made Stanford one of the most exciting
places for faculty and students. But the valley also has
generated significant pressures on the University, es
pecially in recent years, due to its high wage and
housing costs," Bass added.
Bass said the board's tuition and financial aid in
creases were made in response to these higher costs.
The University is enhancing its financial aid pro
grain and providing additional need-based aid for
middle-income families.
The board wants to lower the standard self-help
requirement — the amount students are expec ted to
contribute to their educational costs through loans
and part-time work during the school year — by
$ 1,000, from $6,500 to $5,500.
They also hope to implement a new methodology
in financial aid calculations to further assist middle
income families by reducing the parental contribu
tion.

The board will also cap the parental con
tribution in financial aid calculations at 20
percent of incomes for families with annual
household incomes of $50,000 to $100,000,
which will result in nearly one-third of these
families being eligible for increased aid.
The University is also making plans to as
sist graduate and doctoral students as well.
The minimum graduate student stipend will
increase by 6 percent next year.
Stanford is also working on a program to

lighten the tuition load on doctoral students
and their sponsors through a reduction in the
graduate residency requirement. This pro
gram is scheduled to be implemented at the
beginning of the 2001-2002 academic year.
The aid which Stanford can offer its stu
dents is limited both by the inflationary pres
sures in the Bay Area that have driven up the
University's costs and the size of the Univer
sity's endowment, saitl the trustees.
Though the strong economy has bolstered
the endowment, only 16 percent of Stan
ford's operating costs were covered by en
dowment interest in 1998-1999. Compared
to other private universities, Stanford ranks
21st in terms of endowment per student.
