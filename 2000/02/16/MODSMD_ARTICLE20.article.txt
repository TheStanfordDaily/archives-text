## Stanford can rely on Gall 
### TIM KANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Zero for six. Having a hitting day like that will
usually get someone sent to the bench for a little
while, probably get them stuck in the coach's dog
house — especially il you're a freshman making his
first collegiate start.
John Gall, however, isn't just "someone.".
Sure enough, the senior third baseman and leader
of the Stanford baseball team had a miserable begin
ning to his collegiate career, but since that day Gall
has gone nowhere but up during his time with the
Cardinal.
Gall began the 2000 season as Stanford's all-time
hitting leader with a .364 mark, to go with 192 runs
batted in (sth overall) and 277 hits (7th). That's quite
a turnaround from going o-fer in your first college
game. . .
Beginnings probably aren't Gall's strong point.
"The first time 1 ever hit a ball was at a picnic when
I was four or five years old, playing with my cousin.
He said 1 couldn't play, but my next door neighbor
said, 'let him hit.' So I hit it over the guy's head and

ran the wrong way around the bases."
Born in nearby Portola Valley, located practically
next to the Stanford campus, (iall started playing Little
League when he was nine and eventually joined the
team at nearby Saint Francis High School in Mountain
View. He played mostly third base, a little bit of second
— and he pitched pretty well too. In fact, he happened
to throw a no-hitter in one game, and strike out 15 bat
ters (in a seven-inning game) in another.
When it came time to pick colleges, the choice
came down to Stanford and a familiar enemy for Car
dinal fans — UCLA. The choice didn't prove to be
that difficult for Gall, however.
"Stanford was close to home, my parents could
come and see every game, I was familiar with the area
. . . plus the overall academic excellence, and I'd get
more playing time," said Gall, summing up his rea
sons for coming to the Farm.
Sure enough, Gall was thrown into the mix quick
ly as a freshman, playing through his hitless begin
ning to become a regular in the starting lineup.
"He was very mature... he approached hitting like

a junior or a senior when he was a
freshman," said baseball head
coach Mark Marquess of Gall, who
hit .376 his first year with eight
homers and 59 RBIs while starting
60 of 65 games.
Over the next two years, Gall
would build off of his phenomenal
freshman season. His power num
bers increased to 15 and 12 homers,
respectively, whftf his RBIs jumped
to 63 and then 70. Beyond the
numbers, though, Gall was becom
ing one of the team's leaders, a play
er Marquess counted on to guide
the freshmen.
"I think he leads by example in
the way that he practices, and the
way that he plays — hard, all the
time. A lot of guys can talk the talk
but can't walk the walk, but he can
and he does, and he does what he

expects other guys to do on the
team," said Marquess.
Gall's perspective is not like
that of your typical ballplayer, as
over the past two summers he has
played tor Team USA in competi
tions against other countries all
over the world. He saw Italy,
Japan, even Nicaragua, and came
away with an altered view of life.
"I went from the Far East to
Central America to Europe, and
it's so different from where I grew
up. As far as understanding peo
ple, it opened your mind to new
things," (rail said.
You don't always have to go far
to learn, however, and Gall's rela
tionship with Marquess appears to
have accomplished that.
"He's more of a factor than I
thought he would be, and he's had
a great influence on my life. What
he does for most players around
here is shape the way we lead our
lives. I respect the man greatly,
and he's become a good friend,"

Gall said.
As mentioned above, one of
Gall's main reasons for coming to
the Farm was for the proximity to
his family, who have seen most of
the games during his career. His
parents still live in Portola Valley,
and so once a week Gall makes the
trek home for dinner (and per
haps some laundry).
"They're incredibly support
ive, but they also let me live my life
like 1 was away from home." said
the senior.
So what happens when gradua
tion comes along? Gall was draf ted
in the 50th round by the Cleve
land Indians after last season, but
decided to return to Stanford.
He'll likely be drafted again after
the season is over, and although
he'd like to "play centerfield for
the Yankees," he knows he'll start
at the bottom of the rung, Single A
ball in the minor leagues. If base
ball doesn't happen to work out,
this political science major doesn't

exactly have a backup plan in
place yet.
"To be honest, I don't know
what I would do without baseball.
Everything 1 have is focused to
wards baseball, in that direction,
and if it wasn't, I wouldn't feel like
I'm giving it the greatest chance to
succeed."
Back to the present — Gall's
focus is squarely on getting the
Cardinal back to Omaha for the
second year in a row, this time
winning the College World Series
instead of coming in third as was
the List year and in Gall's
freshman year.
t he Cardinal ran into a tempo
rary setback at Florida State last
weekend, losing two of three, but
Gall doesn't think it will derail the
team in the long run.
"We have a lot of talent, and I
can't see us not having a great
year," he said.
Not the way you'd expect some
one who started 0-for-6 to end up.
