## Stanford can rely on Gall

Zero for six. Having a hitting day like that will
usually get someone sent to the bench for a little
while, probably get them stuck in the coach's dog
house — especially il you're a freshman making his
first collegiate start.
John Gall, however, isn't just "someone.".
Sure enough, the senior third baseman and leader
of the Stanford baseball team had a miserable begin
ning to his collegiate career, but since that day Gall
has gone nowhere but up during his time with the
Cardinal.
Gall began the 2000 season as Stanford's all-time
hitting leader with a .364 mark, to go with 192 runs
batted in (sth overall) and 277 hits (7th). That's quite
a turnaround from going o-fer in your first college
game. . .
Beginnings probably aren't Gall's strong point.
"The first time 1 ever hit a ball was at a picnic when
I was four or five years old, playing with my cousin.
He said 1 couldn't play, but my next door neighbor
said, 'let him hit.' So I hit it over the guy's head and

ran the wrong way around the bases."
Born in nearby Portola Valley, located practically
next to the Stanford campus, (iall started playing Little
League when he was nine and eventually joined the
team at nearby Saint Francis High School in Mountain
View. He played mostly third base, a little bit of second
— and he pitched pretty well too. In fact, he happened
to throw a no-hitter in one game, and strike out 15 bat
ters (in a seven-inning game) in another.
When it came time to pick colleges, the choice
came down to Stanford and a familiar enemy for Car
dinal fans — UCLA. The choice didn't prove to be
that difficult for Gall, however.
"Stanford was close to home, my parents could
come and see every game, I was familiar with the area
. . . plus the overall academic excellence, and I'd get
more playing time," said Gall, summing up his rea
sons for coming to the Farm.
Sure enough, Gall was thrown into the mix quick
ly as a freshman, playing through his hitless begin
ning to become a regular in the starting lineup.
"He was very mature... he approached hitting like
