# Softball sweeps weekend tourney
## 
### EMILY DRESSEL 
After going undefeated on its first road trip of
the season, the Stanford Softball team (7-0) re
turned home, beaming and with plenty to brag
about.
The team, currently ranked No. 21 in the Na
tional Fastpitch Coaches' Association Foil, fin
ished an impressive 5-0 in the Fhoenix Fiesta
Bowl Tournament this weekend.
The Cardinal opened Friday with its bats
clanging, scoring six runs in the first inning of
play against No. 16 Massachusetts.
Freshman pitcher Dana Sorensen kept the
opponent to two hits and a sole run in three in
nings on the mound.
"It was pretty nerve-wracking at first,"
Sorensen said. "We were away from our home
fields against some tough competition, but soon
I got into a rhythm and I had confidence in our
offense."
After a solid comeback by Massachusetts,
freshman teammate Jaime Forman-f.au took
over the pitching duties for Stanford and
recorded her first win of the year, beating the
Minutewomen 9-7.
The team started off strong again in the sec
ond game, putting two runs on the scoreboard
in the first inning against the UNLV Rebels. In
the fourth inning, the Cardinal had the Rebels at
its mercy, causing four different UNLV pitching
changes as the Cardinal offense refused to yield.
Forman-Lau and Sorensen again split the
time in the circle with Sorensen earning the win
off a 12-2 Stanford slaughter.

Sophomore Sarah Beeson led the offense,
going a phenomenal 5-6 for the day with five
RBl's.
Alter a night's rest, Stanford returned to the
Rose Moffbrd Sport's Complex to defeat Geor
gia and Wisconsin in back to back afternoon
games. The scores were 8-3 and 5-4, respective
ly.
In the Georgia game, Kira Cliing and Mau
reen LeCocq demonstrated what freshmen are
capable of as they both smashed home-runs
over the outfield fence against the Bulldog
pitcher.
The Wisconsin game also got off to a quick
start with a two run double by LeCocq that was
answered by a Badger first inning grand slam.
Sorensen, however, kept her cool and retired
twenty of the next twenty three batters to fizzle
Wisconsin's momentum.
"1 have to get used to the fact that these girls
are going to hit the ball and score a lot more runs
than I'm used to in high school," Sorensen said.
"They hit a grand slam off me, but we were hit
ting the ball like crazy and I was sure our team
could come back."
Sunday meant facing the toughest opponent
yet, No. 13 Nebraska. Sorensen dominated on
the mound and added another win to her cur
rent four game streak.
) unior Jenni Shideler was an impressive force
at the plate, bombing a three-run homer in the
fourth to clinch Stanford's eventual 7-2 victory.
I he Stanford offense was on fire this week
end, led by Beeson who batted a staggering .563
with eight total RBl's.

Sophomore Robin Walker (.438), junior Ra
mona Shelburne (.429), and LeCocq (.400) also
contributed to the Cardinal's success and the
consistent first inning rallies Stanford posted
during each game.
Overall, the team scored a combined four
teen runs in the first innings of five games, sug
gesting this year's team isn't messing around.
"We knew going in there was going to be lots
of good competition," Beeson said. "We had to
be at the top of our game, step up the chal
lenge, and not give the other team any oppor
tunities."
Success in these early tournaments is critical
for regional standings later on.
'These games are important for getting accli
mated with our play and will only help in the
long run against our competition in the Pacific
Ten Conference," Sorensen said.
However, Stanford wasn't the only team to go
undefeated in the tournament.
It's no surprise that none of the participating
Pac-10 teams dropped a game in Phoenix — the
same Pac-10, that is, that brags six of the top 12
ranked teams in the country in the preseason
poll.
Yet, there is no rest for the weary. The Cardi
nal will play in two more consecutive nationally
recognized tournaments before the beginning
of March.
But, so far the players aren't complaining.
"We've been practicing for so many months.
We just want to go out on the field and play,"
Sorensen said.
And play they'll get to.
