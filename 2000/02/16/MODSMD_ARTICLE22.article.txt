# Cardinal swimming its way to Olympics

### LORI MAUND EDITORIAL STAFF 
Richard Quick, the head coach for Stanford
swimming, sat behind his desk and scratched his
head. He was thinking hard, really hard. With
so many athletes who have already competed in
the Olympic Games on his current Stanford

team, it is hard to keep track of them all.
"1 believe," he said with hesitation, "that [ju
nior] Siobhan [Cropper] swam in the Olympic
Games last time."
He pauses to think again.
"OK, she did. She did swim in the 1996 sum
mer Olympics."
In total, nine current and former Stanford fe
male swimmers were represented in the 1996
Atlanta Games. They won six gold medals.
Quick was the head coach in 1996 and will make
his fifth Olympic appearance in Sydney 2000.
The Cardinal's long history of women's swim
ming takes credit for a grand total of 24 gold
medals, 11 silver and four bronze.
It almost seems like too much for one coach
to count. Poor guy. It can get tough to remem
ber all that.
"It's not typical at all," Quick said. "It's just a
part of Stanford and Stanford University swim
ming. People think at that level."
The Stanford women's swimming program
currently boasts three veteran Olympians from
a team of 13 swimmers. Along with Cropper
(Trinidad and Tobago), seniors Gabrielle Rose
(Brazil), and Catherine Fox (U.S.) also swam in
the Atlanta Olympics. Fox came home from the
Games and entered her freshman year at Stan
ford with two gold medals, one in the 400-meter
Free Relay and the other in the 400-meter Med
ley.
Of the 13 current Cardinal swimmers, eight
are training for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
