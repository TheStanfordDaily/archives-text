"The goals of the program are to have
Olympians and to have those Olympians be suc
cessful," Quick said. "It is not just that we want
to win the NCAA championship or win the Pac
-10 Championship. It also encompasses the
Olympic ideal.
"Eight of them can think legitimately that
they have a chance for the Olympic team. Now,
some have a lot stronger chance than others.
Not all eight are going to make it, but they all
have a chance."
Those eight Olympic hopefuls are sopho
mores Sylvia Berektiyei, Jessica Foschi and
Shelly Ripple, juniors Cropper, Misty flyman
and Lauren T hies, and seniors Fox and Rose
(who declared U.S. sports citizenship in 1997).
The United States Olympic Trials will be held
this August in Indianapolis. The timed results of
this race will determine which swimmers repre
sent the United States in Sydney.
"The Olympic Games are part of the goals of
our team, to put people on the Olympic Team
and for them to be successful in the Olympic
Games. It is part of the core goals of our pro
gram," said Quick.
Eveiy four years, just like clockwork, the
Stanford women's swimming program under
goes a change. Every four years, the intensity
picks up. The cross-training picks up, the focus
picks up, and the swimmers get
one step closer to the Olympic
rings.
"The focus has shifted a lot. The
last three years it is like we have
been getting ready to get ready for
the Olympics. This year we are
doing it," Bereknyei said.
Monday, Wednesday and Fri
day, the team has two official
practices, and Tuesday and
Thursday they practice only once
a day. Like the non-Olympic
years, there are additional dry
land workouts available to the
swimmers, but these workouts
are individualized and optional.
Swimmers tend to participate in
more optional and independent
workouts when they are prepar
ing for the Olympics.
According to Quick, it is not just
the workout schedule that increas
es during an Olympic year, but the
intensity of the workouts also in
crease.
"Intensity picks up more on the
part of the athlete than on the pro
gram because it is an Olympic year.
The volume of work doesn't in
crease that much, but everybody
gets more focused in the Olympic
year," Quick said. "We have the
same philosophy year in and year
out but I think everybody's focus
picks up."
Hyman, a junior who is current

ly ranked No. 3 in the world in the
100 m fly, No. 6 in the 200 m fly,
and No. 9 in the 50m fly, sees a
marked change in her lifestyle this
year.
"I have put swimming as the
main priority in my life. I have fully
committed myself to that, and I do
anything I can to reach that goal. I
do a lot of the little extra things,
from additional massages to addi
tional workouts in my free time."
A typical day for Hyman con
sists of at least three workouts. On
her three main workout days, she
swims 6:30 to 8:30 a.m. with the
team, lifts 9 to 10:30 a.m., does Pi
lates (a type ofstrength/Y oga) 2:15
to 3:15 p.m., and swims again from
3:30 to 5:30. The other two days,
she does Pilates for an hour in the
morning, bikes 2:15 to 3:15 p.m.,
and swims 3:30 to 5:30 p.m.
As a student-athlete, Hyman
and the rest of her teammates have
had to balance this rigorous work
out schedule while also taking a full
academic course load this quarter.
Hyman partially credits Stanford
and its Athletic Department for
making this possible.
"It's been a challenge, and I am
taking a lighter academic load this
quarter. I can't imagine better re
sources or opportunities some
where else. We have the support of
the Athletic Department to pursue
excellence in the pool and outside
the pool. That combination is hard
to come by," Hyman said.
Bereknyei also recognizes the
challenge of balancing swimming
and school.

"As a sophomore, I need to take
classes for my major, but some
times I have to shift my focus. Now,
my focus is swimming, and 1 need
to pursue those goals," she said.
As the date of the Olympic Tri
als approaches, the swimmers will
focus more of their effort on im
proving their swimming. After the
NCAA tournament at the end of
winter quarter, it is likely that
many of the Olympic hopefuls will
not take classes in the Spring in
order to prepare for Sydney. The
swimmers will stay on campus to
train but will not be enrolled in any
courses.
"If you are qualified to try-out
for the Olympic Team, then you
can either stop out or take a lighter
load. Until now, everyone has
taken a full load. Spring is when it
will make a difference," Quick
said.
With eight potential
Olympians, it is likely that at least a
few of the Stanford swimmers will
join Quick on the Olympic squad
this year.
"It's a thrill to watch somebody
represent their country. One of the
greatest honors in sports is to be
able to represent your country in
international competition, espe
cially the Olympic Games," Quick
said.
As Stanford students, staff and
affiliates gather around to watch
the summer Olympics, it is likely
that what they see in the swim com
petition will not just be another
American on the stand, but a Stan
ford student.
