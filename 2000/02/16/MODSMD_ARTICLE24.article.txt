# Signs of spring: Baseball is here
## 
### 
I have one of those "Count
down to the Millennium" clocks
on my bookcase; the one that
counted down the seconds to the
stroke of midnight, 1999. It's the
sort of thing that became as obso
lete as the 20th-century Fox logo
New Year's Day. Refusing to let a
perfectly good piece of disposable
schmaltz die a natural death, I've
taken to setting it to countdown

to various im
portant events
in my own life,
thus putting
my job inter
views, say, on
par with a
world w i d e
celebration of
brotherhood.
Right. . .
now, the clock

reads two days, 14 hours, 45
minutes, 12 seconds left. I'm
counting down to Friday, 9 a.m.
Eastern Standard Time — the
beginning of spring training for
professional baseball. (The
more mathematically inclined
among yon may deduce when
I'm writing this, giving yon an
idea exactly how much fore
thought I've put into this week
ly offering.) It's the biggest
thing to look forward to since
Lucky Charms started those
multicolored marshinallows.
In many sports, this time of
the year is the nadir of the sea
son, the dog days of winter, the
rock-bottom middle where
opening-day excitement is long
gone and championship season
is still a distant gleam at the end
of the tunnel. Professional
sports this time of year are a
wasteland of mind-numbing
All-Star spectacles, featuring all
the money-grubbing and self
aggrandizement and none of
the human drama or suspense.
Hockey without checking, foot
ball without blitzing, three-point
contests — I'll take going to
Meyer and watching back (IS
106 lectures for thrills and chills
over those games.
College basketball, ordinarih
the salvation of the winterized
sports fan, is bogged clown in
the middle of semi-important
conference play. I don't care if
ESPN started their "Projecting
The NCAA Seeds" articles in
October; the fact is that noth
ing's settled for real until March.
Even the smaller-ticket
sports, Stanford's bedrock of
athletic success, seem a little dis
tant this time of year. Women's
gymnastics? ()ff in Boise. I rack?
Setting records out in Arkansas.
Women's tennis? Loving the
winter, I'm sure, in Wisconsin.
Out of sight, out of mind; if I

can't sit in the stands and heck
le, it's like it never happened.
NCAAs lor swimming, Pac
l()s for wrestling, champi
onships for rugby — all weeks or
months away.
This time of year is why
Sports Illustrated invented the
swimsuit issue.
And that is why I cling to my
Stanford baseball scores like the
post office continues to cling to
those cookies your mom sent
you three weeks ago. Where
baseball goes, spring follows. It's»
a happy coincidence of history,
geography, and the rules of the
game that the sport of baseball
has become so identified with
the seasons of good weather,
and I still think it's why America
claims it as the national pastime.
What else would it be? The
NFL? Are we going to celebrate
our team in the snow and the
wind as they make obscene ges
tures and belittle the officials?
Well, if'you follow the (Cleveland
Indians, I suppose.
But the rest of us like our
sports in the sun. when we can
roll up our sleeves, lean back in
the bleachers, and feel like we've
got nothing in the world to do
for a few hours but eat a hot dog
and harass the other team's
bullpen. (Southern Califotnians
and Floridians, don't get all
smug. You may have that all
year, but you've also got the
Dodgers, the Angels and the
Marlins.)
College baseball season and
spring training are closely
linked for me. I've got more
emotional investment in the
former, now that I'm at a school
where it matters. Kven so, 1
think the fan base here suffers
from the Northern California
winter weather schizophrenia.
At Florida State, students jam
the stands for a preseason
scrimmage. Win shouldn't
they? It's not like they've got
any classes to go to, and when
it's always summer, it's always
baseball season.
Ip here, even though it in
jures inv East Coast roots to sav
this, it's still ;i little nipp\ for
baseball. But Jason Young, Fd
mund Muth and Damien Al
varado serve for me as the
groundhog who doesn't see his
shadow, or perhaps like a peppv
little robin — they're signs of
spring. Baseball and the best
time of'the year are linked, inex
tricably, in the minds of the fan.
Neither one can come soon
enough for me.

Jeff C'.ooper, a junior J'rom Huston,
hunt's that t/u\ is the year. l : or real
He 's serious.
