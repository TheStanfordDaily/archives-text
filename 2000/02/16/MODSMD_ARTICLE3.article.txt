Operations manager promises criminal audit by the Inspector General

The ()fliceofthe Inspec tor General
will conduct a criminal investigation
and audit of the the post office,
promised Robert Reed, acting manag
er of post office operations, at an ASSU
open forum on the post office yester
day.
After 45 minutes of emotional com
plaints by students and relatively little
response from Palo Alto postmaster
Masa Sato, second-year law student Ty
Glevenger asked what immediate ef
forts the post office would take to rem
edy service and quality problems.
"OIG will be asked to come here to
investigate the Stanford post office,"
Reed said.
I lie () IG, in conjunction with the
established (ieneral Accounting ()flice,
was created by the 1 louse of Represen
tatives in 1993 to oversee federal pro
grams and ensure accountability to the
American people.
l'i i<>i to announcing the investiga
tion, Reed had already acknowledged
that the current quality of service was
unacceptable.
"There'* no excuse tor thv
post office is operating right now,"
Reed said.
John (Vkeefe, manager of Adminis
trative Services of the San Francisco
Postal District, Frank Ganalez, post of
fice acting manager, Jim Ruiz, former
post office acting manager, Gliris
Ghristofferson, University manager
for facilities operations, and Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education
James Montoya also attended the
meeting.
Student complaints ranged from
outrage over extremely late mail to ac
cusations of sexual harassment.
I he primary complaint of the night,
however, was the poor customer ser
vice and hostile attitudes of employees.
Many students stated that they are con
sistently treated with contempt and are
made to feel insignificant by postal
workers.

Reed said in response to this that
there is a common courtesy effort dis
trict-wide to help promote customer
service.
While there is no employee incen
tive program in place for encouraging
good customer service, Sato said, there
are employee evaluations.
Investigators from an outside
agency have been hired to pose as
shoppers in order to evaluate the post
office's efficiency ancl customer service.
According to Sato, the wait time for
parcel pick-up has since decreased.
As the primary spokesperson for the
post office, Sato explained changes in
stituted to facilitate better customer
service.
Sato said the post office boxes had to
be removed from the old post office in
order to renovate the building. There
was no building on campus that could
house the- approximate 9,000 boxes, so
it was necessary to build a temporary
post office.
The box numbers were changed to
make mail sorting in the long run more
efficient and also to eliminate any box
duplicates in the Palo Alto area. The
new are now in a sequential
order. This will allow the mail sorting
machine to distribute mail in a more
timely manner.
Sato says there is no doubt that there
has been a delay in the delivery of mail,
but the hiring of additional clerks and
a new manager have resulted in fewer
mail delays.
I lie post office lias created several
initiatives to increase customer satisfac
tion and decrease wait times, Sato said.
As an example of these initiatives, Sato
cited the new service supervisor, who is
stationed in front of the post office
from 1 1 a.m. to 1 p.m. everyday to an
swer customer questions.
The primary reason for the renova
tion oft lie post office, according to offi
cials, is to make the post office more
"do-it-yourself." There will be a post
office store that will reduce wail time In
allowing customers more self-service

options.
Drainage problems wire addressed
as well.
O'Keefe said that the temporary
siii was designed !»\ a c i\ii engineei
and a new drainages) stem has been in
stalled to decrease mud and flooding.
Clevenger initiated ;in e-mail cam
paign to Senatoi Diane l einstein and

U.S. Rep. Anna Kshoo, D-Atherton,
earlier this year to bring attention to
what he felt was the unacceptable ser
vice of the post office. The meeting be
tween students and numerous postal
service officials was arranged after
I shoo s aides met with postal authori
ties. according to an article in yester
days San Francisco Chronicle.
