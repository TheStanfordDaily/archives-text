## 
### KIMBERLY DOWNS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Complaints about Cowell Health
Center may soon be silenced. The
Board of Trustees approved the con
struction of a new student health facility
to replace the current Cowell Student
I iealth Service building, which lacks ad
equate space and does not meet current
standards for seismic safety and access
for the disabled, at its meeting yester
da>-
The new, two-story building is ex
pected to be opened for use at the start
of the academic year in 2002. It will be
located to the east of the c urrent build
ing on Campus Drive on what now
serves as CowcH's parking lot.
Cowell will remain open until the
new building is ready, and then it will be
torn down and turned into the parking
lot of the new facility.
"I am thrilled that students will have
this new resource," said James Mon
toya, vice provost for student allairs. "A
strong health care program for under
graduates and graduate students is of
key importance to a residential universi
ty."

The new building will Ik- no bigger
than the existing structure, which is
30,000 square feet, since Stanford is
under development constraints from
Santa ( lara County. Though the size ol
the new building will not be increased,
its spat e will be better utilized than that
of the current building.
Cowell was built in I'.Mi"). and thus it
has large amounts of unusable spaa

and numerous functional deficiencies,
including an insufficient number of
exam rooms.
"Our new lacilit) v\ill help us to bet
tci serve .ill Stan fold students. It will
offer improved seismic salctv and better
comfort, privacv and disabled access,"
said Dr. Ira M. Friedman, directol of
C lowell Student 1 lealth Service.
"It will be exciting to pi act it e in ;i set-

ling that is designed for modern health
care. Students will be able to feel and ap
preciate the dilference," Friedman
added.
The plans to address Cowell's defi
ciencies have been in development for
live years. I lie University originally
hoped to renovate the existing building,
bin officials realized after extensive
analysis ih.it a new building could be
constructed for the same amount of
money: $9 million.
Construction of the new facility is ex
pected to begin no later than July 2001.
Friedman noted that there will be nonet
effect on parking in the area and that
every measure will be taken to minimize
the inconveniences caused b\ the con
struction.
Cowell has been working closelv with
housing services and residential educa
tion officials to ensure that nearby Cow
ell cluster residences are not adversely
affected. The new facility will be over
100 feet from the residential buildings
and will not face them.
"I am happy that we will remain in
the same location on Campus Drive,
which students say is convenient for
them," said Friedman.
