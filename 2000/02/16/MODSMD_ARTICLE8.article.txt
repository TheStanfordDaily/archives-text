World" will deliver a keynote address titled
"Keepin' It Real: Social Consciousness for a Col
lege Generation" as part of Black Liberation
Month at 7:SO p.m. tonight in Terman Audito
rium.
Powell's talk will probably focus on the"state
of America, specifically the social and political
state, education, and how it has shaped our so
cial consciousness," said senior Tiencia DePass,
a member of the NAACP's programming com
mittee.
"He'll talk to students about how to be agents
of change and their responsibility to their com
munity," said James Jordan, assistant director
of the Black Student Union.
"1 le seemed really excited about the oppor
tunity to speak at Stanford," Jordan said, "lie's
never been here before."
The Black Liberation Month committee
began working last (October to bring Powell to
campus. The Black Students Union and the
NAACPare co-sponsoring his visit. The event is
open to all students.
"In the past, one of the things people want
ed was someone younger who could relate to
students better," DePass said. "We thought
about bringing a younger person, an up-and
coming voice."
Jordan echoed these sentiments, stating that
"students really relate to him; he's not much
older than them, and he's grown up with some

of the same experiences."
Besides appearing on 'The Real World,"
Powell's social and political critiques have ap
peared in Essence, Rolling Stone and The
Washington Post. He also wrote a book called
"Keepin' It Real: Post-MTV Reflections on
Race, Sex and Politics."
"He's come to be the spokesperson for the
hip-hop generation," Jordan said. "[The Real
World'] is a show most students have grown up
with."
Jordan hopes this talk will inspire students
from a variety of backgrounds to think about
ways they can change the world around them.
A group of students will do a presentation at
noon in front of the bookstore to help Powell get
a sense of black history at Stanford over the past
30 years. He will have dinner with the officers of
the BSU, the Black Lilieration Month commit
tee and the NAACP.
"He wants to talk to the students, see how
they feel about certain issues," Jordan said.
Members of the planning committees seem
excited to meet and speak with Powell. "He re
ally prides himself 011 being a poet, journalist
and activist," DePass said.
Powell's talk will address this year's theme
for Black liberation Month, which is "Black
achievement in the next millennium." Powell's
visit will be followed by a gospel extravaganza
this weekend and a poetry night on Feb. 25.
"Being at Stanford provides us with unique
opportunities," DePass said. 'The doors are
open here and they're shut for many others."
Receptions and lx>ok signing will follow the talk
in the Ujamaa Lounge.
