# Construction to begin on deGuerre climbing wall
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER 
After three years of delays, construction
on Stanford's long-awaited climbing wall
l>egan yesterday in a deGuerre squash
court.
Now, in his own words, freshman Jack
son Wagstaff will no longer have to practice
his sport on "Memorial Church or the art
building."
The Climbing Wall Group, a student or
ganization promoting and organizing the
construction of the new wall, circulated a
petition for the construction of a wall in
1990 and collected 500 signatures of sup
port.
In 1997 the ASSU voted to set aside
$30,000 for a rock gym, and the Athletic De
partment provided matching funds. A year
was spent, however, finding a building site.
Although a contractor, Comp-YVall, was
hired, there were difficulties acquiring the
necessary permits, and the process dragged
on for another two years. spring, mem
bers of the Climbing Wall Group expressed
dissatisfaction with what they perceived as
the University's foot-dragging.
Now that the climbing wall is under con
struction, the greatest difficulty, according
to junior Dan Arnold, a member of the
Climbing Wall Group, will be in finding
trained staff to man the climbing wall all the
time. Arnold is optimistic, though, saying
that the future of the climbing wall "looks
more promising now."
With a wide range of challenges, the fa
cility will appeal to both novice and expert
climbers, Arnold said. "We want to get a lot
of people interested in the sport."
Wagstaff added, "There are a lot of peo
ple in my dorm who would be interested in
trying it."
The wall will include areas both for rope
climbing and lower level climbing without
ropes, referred to as "bouldering." Safety
harnesses and climbing shoes will be avail
able for rental.
"We hope the wall gets used as much as
possible," said Arnold, who is unsure when
the wall will be completed.
