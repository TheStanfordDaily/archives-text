## Clinton addresses death penalty and other issues 
### 
WASH INCHON (AP) — President Clinton reject
ed calls for a national moratorium on capital pun
ishment yesterday but urged the nation's governors
to "look very closely" at their death penalty systems
to make sure that innocent people are not executed.
He said it was courageous of Illinois Gov. George
Ryan to impose a freeze on executions after the
exoneration of 13 death row inmates in his state over
two decades. Clinton said death penalty supporters
— including himself— have "an especially heavy
obligation" to make sure there is no question of guilt
lor condemned prisoners.
During an hourlong news conference ranging
from domestic subjects to foreign policy, Clinton
refused to say whether he will challenge ethics com
plaints seeking to strip him of his Arkansas law
license because of his conduct in the Monica Lewin
sky scandal.
He said he paid $850,000 last year to settle a relat
ed case — the sexual harassment suit of Paula Jones
— only to prevent it from being a distraction to his
presidency. He said the suit "had absolutely no
merit."
On another subject, Clinton said he has not ruled
out a visit to Pakistan next month when he visits its
arch rival, India. He said his decision would hinge
on whether stopping in Islamabad could stop the
regional arms race, promote democracy in military
ruled Pakistan and resolve the India-Pakistan con
flict. He said the United States would be happy to
help mediate the dispute over Kashmir, but only if

both countries seek help.
L'pon striding into the East Room for his first reg
ular news conference of the year, Clinton
announced the release of $125 million in federal
money to help needy families buy home heating oil
in the Northeast.
The president also said he would seek $600 mil
lion in emergency funds to deal with the current cri
sis and problems likely to occur later this year in
areas suffering from extreme heat. Clinton said he is
restricted by law from tapping into the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve to moderate fuel prices, but
added, "I have not ruled out any action."
The idea of a death penalty moratorium has gath
ered momentum since Gov. Ryan took the unprece
dented step Jan. 31 of putting all executions on hold
in Illinois, saying that the state's system was "fraught
with error."
Before that, the American Bar Association had
called for a death penalty moratorium. Last week,
Sen. Ru'ss Feingold, I)-Wis., urged Clinton to sus
pend federal executions.
"In the federal cases, I don't believe it is called
for,"the president said. He said 27 people have been
condemned under federal law, 20 in civilian courts
and seven through the military system.
He said the Justice Department is reviewing
whether the death penalty is being imposed fairly
from a racial standpoint, and is drawing up guide
lines to make it easier for prisoners to pursue
clemency requests.
