### 
NEW YORK (AP) — A former Bank of
New York executive and her husband plead
ed guilty yesterday to laundering billions of
dollars for crooked Russians in one of the
biggest such schemes in U.S. history.
The pleas were the first major admissions
of wrongdoing since the investigation caused
an international scandal last August and
strained relations between Russia and the
United States.
Standing side by side, Lucy Edwards, 41.
and Peter Berlin, 40, each told a federal judge
how they used Edwards' position as a vice
president in die bank's Eastern European
division to Russian bankers laupdej: jn<{te
than $7 billion. i . , ~, , ,
Investigators believe most of the money
came from Russian importers trying to avoid
taxes, though they are looking into whether
some came from Russian mobsters. No one
directly addressed the matter in court.
But a prosecutor did say that $300,000 of
the laundered money was ransom for a kid

napping in Russia.
And Edwards said the bankers she teamed
up with in 1995 at the Russian bank DKB had
some sinister connections.
"1 was aware that personnel for DKB were
on occasion in fear of their customers and
afraid to leave the bank because they said cus
tomers with machine guns were waiting for
them," she said.
Edwards also said Russian banking officials
were accomplices in the scant. The adminis
tration of former President Boris Yeltsin has
called the Bank of New York allegations a cre
ation by the West to tarnish' Russia:
Exlvyqrds aticj Berlin, a Russian business
man, surrendered to the EBl on Tuesday'
after flying to New York from London, where
they had been living.
The couple could face up to 10 years in
prison at sentencing May 3 but could get less
er sentences by identifying others involved.
They also agreed to surrender more than $1
million.

Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant director of the
FBl's New York office, called the pleas a sig
nificant development but said "much remains
to be done" in the investigation.
T. Barry Kingham, an attorney for
Edwards and Berlin, said the couple will keep
cooperating with investigators. "They are anx
ious to fulfill their obligations here and
resume a normal life," he said.
Dressed in black and smiling frequently
during the hearing, Edwards described creat
ing an illegal banking network for Russians —
without required licenses — that was run
"tlrtough accounts*at*the -Bank of New York.
The Bank of New York was not accused of any
wrongdoing.
Money laundering involves moving
deposits through a series of accounts to dis
guise their illicit source.
In this case, Edwards and her husband set
up accounts at Bank of New York for shell
companies with offices in New York City and
Jersey City, N.J.
