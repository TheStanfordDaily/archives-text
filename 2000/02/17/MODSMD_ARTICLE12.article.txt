# Dennis Rodman threatens NBA head
## 
### 
DALLAS (AP) — Dennis Rod
man ejected? That's old stuff. This
time, Rodman is taking a new
approach. He wants to duke it out
with David Stern.
"I don't know who gave David
Stern all the power in the world to
sit there and make all the rules in
the world, but this league has
gone to hell," Rodman said after
his ejection from Tuesday night's
game, only his second with the
Mavericks. "It's ridiculous."
Rodman, speaking on his way
from the locker room to the park
ing lot, then challenged the com
missioner to settle their differ
ences with their fists.
"I wish me and David Stern
can get some damn gloves on, and
we go in the ring and we can see
who'll come out the winner,"
Rodman said. "Me and him."
Rodman could be fined and
suspended for his words and
actions. There was no immediate
comment yesterday from the NBA.
The latest blowup began with
7:13 left in Dallas' 112-99 loss to
Milwaukee.
Rodman complained that the
Bucks should have been called for
an illegal defense. As Sam Cassell
went to shoot the free throw, Rod
man went to the other foul line
and sat down in protest, drawing
another technical and an auto
matic ejection.
"1 told the referee, 'Why don't

you kick me out for a reason? Let
me hit somebody first. That's a
good reason. Don't kick me out
because I sit down,'" Rodman
said. "I've been a marked man for
years. Nobody else in the league
would have gotten kicked out for
that."
Rodman also may be peeved at
Stern for forcing him to move out
of the guest house of Mavericks
owner-in-waiting Mark Cuban.
The commissioner said the
arrangement violated salary cap
rules even though Rodman was
paying rent. He was given 72
hours to move out or the team
would he heavily fined.
"He's moved into a high-rise
apartment," Cuban said Tuesday.
"I don't know if all the stuff is
completely moved yet, but it's
done."
Rodman has brought the Mav
ericks plenty of attention, but not
necessarily the right kind. After
winning seven of eight, Dallas has
lost two straight with the eccentric
rebounding star in the lineup.
Rodman actually was having a
good game before being tossed.
He had 16 rebounds — the most
by a Dallas player this season —
and added six points and four
assists in 36 minutes.
Teammates said Rodman was
upset that the Bucks were not
called for fouls while playing
rough defense against him.
