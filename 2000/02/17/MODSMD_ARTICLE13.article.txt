# McCain garners Republican support
## 
### 
GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) —
Pushing toward Saturday's pri
mary, Sen. John McCain won
endorsements yesterday from
former rival Gary Bauer and a
California official switching
from George W. Bush.
The Texas governor laid
plans .for a fresh round of fund
raising after running through
$50 million.
While McCain crowed about
gathering enthusiasm. Bush
rebuffed suggestions that he
had too little to show for his
money, saying he was already
campaigning in every state and
"I. have got a good chance of
winning."
Bush was sharply criticized
by one of his numerous con
gressional supporters, Rep.
Peter King of New York, who
said the governor offended him
as a Catholic by speaking at Bob
Jones University, controversial
for anti-Catholic and racial
remarks by past president Bob
Jones Jr.
Polls put Bush and McCain
in a dead heat just days before
the important Republican pri
mary in South Carolina.
Bauer, who quit the race two
weeks ago, announced his sup
port for McCain at a rally at
Furman University.
"He is our best shot" at win
ning the White House, Bauer
said, arguing McCain has a lix
on "the moral idea of America."
Bauer, who was an adviser to
President Reagan and whose
own campaign focused largely
on opposing abortion, is an
important force in the competi
tion for social conservatives'
votes. Bush has sent repeated
mailings to social and religious
conservatives questioning
McCain's commitment to
opposing abortion.
"There's been so much
doubt raised about my commit
ment to some of these issues,"
McCain said about the Bauer
endorsement. "He'll dispel
that."
Also signing on was Califor
nia Secretary of State Bill Jones,
the highest elected Republican
in that state, which votes March

7 as part of the big round of pri
maries that could well settle the
GOP presidential nomination.
Jones, whose own election in
1998 relied on independents
and Democrats, said he
switched his endorsement
because McCain's message of
campaign finance reform
would reach beyond Republi
can stalwarts and help build the
party. He complained that
some Republicans in South
Carolina were sending the mes
sage that "your vote doesn't
count as an independent or
crossover unless you vote lor
Bush."
Rep. King, R-N.Y., said he
was "reconsidering my support
for Bush" because his appear
ance at Bob Jones University
was hard to defend and made
Bush seem "almost blind to
Catholic sensibilities."
Aides said Bush was set to
report he had about $20 million
left from his vaunted $70 mil
lion campaign treasury. That's
about twice what McCain said
he had left in the bank. Bush
already has set a new record for
primary-season spending.
Bush was revving up his
fund-raising machine after a
lull, seeking a refill to compete
in looming and expensive big
states. McCain has been fund
raising heavily since bis surprise
blowout in New Hampshire.
"We have a plan in place
that's going to enable me to stay
in this race for the long run,"
Bush said, noting he was cam
paigning in more states than
McCain. And he suggested
McCain was breaking the rules
by surpassing state-by-state
spending caps imposed on can
didates who take federal match
ing funds. Bush isn't subject to
the limits because he declined
taxpayer funds.
Dismissing the c harge as crit
icism from"the $80 million
man," McCain said he was
obeying the rules. The Arizona
senator said he would report
spending $20 million, with $10
million on hand as of Jan. 31
and a goal of spending $41 mil
lion throughout the primaries.
