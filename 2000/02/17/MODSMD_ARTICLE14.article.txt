## The
						Stanford Daily Rethinking the Admit Weekend contract 
### 
AFTER a STRONG reaction from
residential education stafl mem
bers and the Stanford community,
the Office of Admission
announced Tuesday its plans to revamp the
newly-created contract that potential stu
dents will be obligated to sign before partic
ipating in Admit Weekend.
Students had argued that the language
of the contract established an atmosphere
of distrust between prospective students
and the University and undermined
reliance on the Fundamental Standard to
govern student conduct.
The Office of Admission announced it
will rework the contract's language and

lighten the tone of the statement. This
effort gives the Office a unique opportunity
to build a positive, trusting relationship
with future students rather than rely upon
draconian threats — such as the revokation
of admision offers — to moderate conduct.
Admit Weekend is a time to explore the
University and take in a whole host of expe
riences which contribute to the decision to
choose a college — a very important decision.
It should not be a time spent living in
fear of University reprisals for student
behavior. The reason we have a Funda
mental Standard is that Stanford students
(and prospective students) must be respon
sible and accountable for their actions.

If a contract is necessary at all, perhaps
prospective students should sign an agree
ment to uphold the Fundamental Standard
— the same principles which Stanford stu
dents are bound by during their time here.
Why is there such a disproportionate
standard for prospective students, only five
months removed from entering the Uni
versity as freshmen, than for actual Stan
ford students?
Such a dichotomy seems to suggest an
equally large gap in the level of responsibil
ity of the two groups.
Perhaps most important about the con
tract is the role it forces upon residential
assistants and other staff members, as well

as the student Admit Weekend hosts. Just as
RAs are not intended to act as enforcers of
the Fundamental Standard, it is unreason
able to ask them to play a policing role with
prospective freshmen.
By creating an adversarial relationship
between potential students and Stanford
students, who they look up to immensely
during Admit Weekend, the University
threatens to alienate a potentially large seg
ment of the incoming Stanford community.
If the Office of Admission insists upon
prospective students signing a contract for
Admit Weekend, it must ensure that such a
contract keep both the University and the
students' interests in mind.
