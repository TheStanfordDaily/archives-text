## Mission to Mars 
### 
Days go by, messages are sent, the
world listens and the Mars Polar
Lander remains obstinately
silent. Stanford's gargantuan
Dish remains pointed at the Red Planet
while graduate students and Palo Alto's
health-conscious citizens jog by under
neath, but it's becoming apparent that the
brave little lander has lost the capacity to
answer back — assuming it's still in one
piece.

At this point,
attempts to contact the
lander are starting to
resemble those plead
ing e-mails to an ex-sig
nificant other who just
won't write back. Soon
NASA's cadre of jilted
radio astronomers will
have to accept the
inevitable, realize that

tlit* relationship just isn't working any
more, and start concentrating on building
better telemetry with the next interplane
tary probe.
As in the end of any relationship, the
immediate reaction of everyone involved
is to start dishing out blame. So far, what's
mostly come under attack is NASA's
recent "better, faster, cheaper" approach
to space exploration, which calls for more
frequent small-scale missions rather than
the occasional big-budget extravaganza.
Faster and cheaper it may be, and two
out of three isn't necessarily bad. Howev
er, in recent months many of NASA's
spacecraft have developed the bad habit
of disappearing unexpectedly.
lake the Mars Climate Orbiter, which
vanished from the radar screen last
September as it was preparing to settle
into orbit. After a week of hemming and
hawing, NASA announced that apparent
ly one team of scientists had been using
English units (inches, feet, pounds) for
their calculations, while another team had
been using the metric system.
It's the sort of honest mistake that any
one could make, and that anyone who did
AP Physics labs in high school probably
has made. But when the people responsi
ble are an elite group of rocket scientists
culled from NASA, Lockheed and the Jet
Propulsion laboratory, the whole thing
starts to resemble a "Far Side" cartoon.
Everyone jokes about government incom
petence, but we're still disturbed to find it
exemplified so luridly.
Compare the scene in Terry Gilliam's
"Brazil" where a government construction
worker assures Kim Greist that "we don't
make mistakes," then immediately drops
a circular piece of flooring right through
the hole that it was supposed to fill.
"Bl(X)dy typical," announces the worker,
"they've gone back to metric without

telling us." The future, apparently, is now.
There's also the question of what to
think about the Mars Polar Lander's offi
cial Web site; aside from one article asking
"Is MFL alive?" there is little indication
that anything has gone awry. More typical
are optimistic predictions such as "We
("Xpert ro st images*from the
lander's stereo camera as soon as one
hour after landing. A partial panorama of
the horizon should be available within a
day." If "Brazil"'s propaganda was sinis
ter, this is just vaguely sad.
The whole process tends to make one
embarrassed for one's country, rather like
last year's accidental bombing of the Chi
nese embassy in Belgrade (as it turns out,
the embassy had moved four years ago
but the CIA hadn't gotten around to
updating the address). It's enough to
make one nostalgic for the Cold War;
McCarthy-type witch hunts aside, at least
the obvious presence of an enemy made
feats like the moon landing possible. We
were going to get a man up there before
the Commies, and by God, that's just what
we did. It might not be a fair trade for
decades of nuclear terror and political
hysteria, but bipolar global conflict does
have a marvelous way of focusing the
mind.
These days, our national agenda seems
a little more aimless, which perhaps
explains NASA's switch to the "better,
faster, cheaper" credo. Space flight is
expensive, and it's not surprising that the
agency wants to publicize its leaner bud
get, but unfortunately it seems to have lost
quality control somewhere along the way.
The Polar Lander cost $120 million;
the Climate Orbiter cost $328 million.
This is a lot of money to spend on equip
ment that blows up in deep space, but
consider that the War on Drugs, for
instance, has cost several billion dollars
annually since its inception in 1989, and
has arguably done even less than two crip
pled spacecraft. A recent poll shows that
despite the recent debacles, 70 percent of
Americans support continued Mars mis
sions, suggesting that we may not need a
Red Menace to justify boldly going where
no one has gone before.
There is, after all, something strangely
exhilarating about sending machines off
into the unexplored ether; we all grew up
watching Star Trek. Which is presumably
why we want NASA to keep on going, dif
ficulties with the metric system notwith
standing. Hope springs eternal; Valen
tine's Day may have passed without any
word from the lost lander, but maybe next
time we can make the relationship work.

nothing about astrophysics.
