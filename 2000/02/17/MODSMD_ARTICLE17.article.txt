Defending Sanskriti
I am writing in regards to the guest
column, "South Asians as activists," which
ran in yesterday's Daily. The perception
that Sanskriti is strictly bhangra and
party-based is a stereotype that the author
made.
All South Asians do not do bhangra. All
South Asians do not eat at South Asian
restaurants. All South Asians do not
belong to one clique or not at all. Sanskri
ti has been trying to shed these percep
tions for years; here I will try again.
I will not deny that a large part of our
mission is to try and build a South Asian
student community at Stanford; this
involves social events.
It even involves bhangra parties.
There is nothing wrong with holding
social events; this is how people meet and
friends are made, South Asian and non-
South Asian alike.
But that is not all we do. We attempt,
with the very programs the author criti
cizes, to showcase aspects of South Asian
culture to the Stanford community at
large. And we succeed. Students of all
races, creeds and beliefs watch, sing,

dance the ancient classical forms and
(yes), do bhangra. We believe that this is
the most successful sort of activism —
inclusion, sharing and the beginnings of
understanding, accomplished on a per
sonal level.
What of other activities? Kartar Singh
Duggal, a famous Punjabi poet, came ear
lier this year to deliver the powerful mes
sage of his life and experiences. This year
Sanskriti's community service committee
is establishing a mentoring program for
high school students and a program
through which talented students can per
form for audiences at hospitals and com
munity centers.
As for student and political activism, it
is true that Sanskriti attempts to stay out
of political issues involving South Asia; in
this respect we do not wish to alienate
portions of the Stanford community or
create divisiveness by adding the conflicts
between our homelands to our cultural
mix. But we do interact with and support
organizations that engage both in student
activism and service in the subcontinent.
We cannot be all things to all people;
thus we attempt to work with others who
have strengths where we are weak.

Despite all that I have just said, I doubt
that I have erased all the perceptions peo
ple hold of Sanskriti. 1 therefore chal
lenge the Stanford community to support
our activism in all its forms. Join our com
munity service programs. Teach and
learn cultures. Make a difference person
by person — these are the differences that
last.
