## 
### DENNIS TYLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I he ASSU held its longest
meeting ever Tuesday, accord
ing to its president Mike Levin,
as it made important changes to
the rules for the 2000 ASSU elec
tions.
After the forum to address stu
dent complaints regarding the
temporal - )' post office, the ASSU
resumed its normal business: dis
cussing the Campaign Practices
(lode, which provides election
guidelines pertaining to the con
duct of candidates, slates, special
fee requests and sponsors.
Prospective Undergraduate
Senate candidates are expected
to compile 100 signatures for
placement on the ballot, instead
of the previous 50.
"We have raised the number
of signatures in hopes to dis
suade students who are not seri
ous about ninning for Senate,"
said ASSU Vice President John
Mills, a doctoral student in ge
netics. "This year we want to cre
ate a more meaningful election

for the student body, which is
less name driven and more
image driven."
For these reasons, the ASSU
has placed limits on campaign
spending. After much heated
debate, two-thirds of the Senate
decided that capping campaign
spending would make people
pay more attention to the plat
forms of the candidates.
According to Levin, a junior,
"Mavingstudents makinga lot of
buttons and t-shirts to get votes
takes away from the essence of
what we want for these elections,
which are committed students
who are best suited for the [Un
dergraduate] Senate."
On the other hand, Senate
(lliair Steven Aronowitz, a se
nior, argued that "placing limi
tations on spending is a clear vi
olation of the students' freedom
of speech." After much delibera
tion, however, the majority
ruled to impose spending limits
on the campaigns.
()ther changes to the election
process include the elimination
of monetary fines on students

who violate the code. Instead,
the Senate has decided to note
on the ballots that a particular
candidate has violated the rules,
allowing students to punish can
didates by not voting lor them.
Additionally, the Senate has
introduced a new plea bargain
option for campaigns that are
charged with violations of the
code. Candidates will now have
the option of pleading "no con
test" to the charge in question
and accepting a punishment de
fined by the hearings officer.
According to campaign regu
lations, such a plea would not
signify an admission of guilt. It
merely would signify that an in
dividual does not wish to contest
thee barges levied against him or
her and is willing to accept a plea
bargain.
liy drafting these new
amendments, "the Undergradu
ate Senate has stepped up to its
mandated role of determining
new policies, which in the past
has been left to the decision of
the Elections Committee," Mills
said.
