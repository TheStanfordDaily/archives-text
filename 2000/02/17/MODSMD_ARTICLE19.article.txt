Members of Stanford in Government are hoping
to ease summer internship anxiety and encourage
students to pursue careers in government and pub
lic service at their annual SIG internship night
tonight at 7 p.m. in km. 41 of the Psychology build
ing.
Hie program is geared towards students interest
ed in careers in public service, public policy, govern
ment and business. The goal of the program will be
to inform students of the many opportunities avail
able in those fields as well as walk students through
the process of gett ing an internship.
Anne Greenblatt, a public service career coordi
nator at the Career Development Center will speak,
as will Chuck Ludlam, a Stanford and SIG alumnus.
1 .udlam, who has had previous experience in careers
in government, is the SIG alumni advisor.
I'he program will also include a panel of four stu
dents who interned in various organizations last
summer and will conclude with a question and an
swer session.
Director of I).C. Resources, senior Chad Bollen
bach, encourages anyone interested in working in
Washington, I).C. to come to the event. Bollenbach
interned in the State Department last summer.
"We will provide info on what's out there to the

students instead of making them come to us," Bol
lenbach said.
However, Bollenbach does encourage students to
drop by the SIG office in the Haas Center anytime.
SIG hopes that all interested students make it a
point to come tomorrow night.
"If students have the idea of interning in mind,
this will be a great time to become familiar with the
process, " said sophomore Andrew Blotky, a public
relations director for SIG.
Blotky worked as a page on Capital Hill last sum
mer and said he learned a lot from attending SIG
events like this one his freshman year.
Later this year, SIG will publish two helpful
guides to students; "Approaching Washington"and
"Approaching Sacramento." The guides will tell stu
dents about the do's and don'ts of interning as well as
a view of life as an intern.
Junior Folake Qguntebi said she is excited about
attending tonight's program. "I don't have any plans
for the summer yet so I want to learn about all the op
portunities that are available to me," she said.
Margot Brandenburg, also a junior, expressed
many of the same sentiments. "I think SIG intern
ship night is a really good opportunity for those peo
ple like myself who are a little behind in setting some
thing up for the summer .... It will hopefully give
me the chance to scan through a number of
different organizations at once."
