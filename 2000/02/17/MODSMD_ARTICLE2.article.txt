# Study shows Internet use stunts social growth

### MEREDITH ROWE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Practically everything can be done
011 the Internet these days: shopping,
chatting with strangers from all over
the world, e-mailing old friends and
even conducting business.
However, according to a study re
leased yesterday by the Stanford Insti
tute for the Quantitative Study of So
ciety — one of the first ever on the so
cial impact of the Internet — this isn't
necessarily good news.
Statistics gathered show that out of
a sampling of 4,1 13 adults age 18 and
above, 55 percent have Internet ac
cess. Of those, 36 percent spend five
or more hours per week online.
Stanford political scientist Norman
Nie, the principal investigator and co

author of the study with Prof. Lutz Er
bringofthe Free University of Berlin,
said as people are increasingly turn
ing to the Internet for their needs,
they are shutting themselves off from
s< >ciety.
"People who use the Internet at
even modest amounts, such as five to
ten hours a week, are reporting that
they see fewer people, talk to fewer
people and go out less often," he said.
"This definitely merits concern."
In fact, the study (the results of
which can be accessed at

suggests Internet users begin to spend
noticeably less time chatting on the
phone with family and visiting
112 riends: more than 25 percent report
ed a decrease in these social activities.
Nie said that while communicating

with others via the Internet definitely
beats no contact, it can never take the
place of real telephone calls 01 face-to
face conversations.
"The technology that has created e
mail is far superior to no contact at
all," he said. "But I don't think it's su
perior to social contact or even contact
through the telephone. It's a poor
substitute for social interaction."
Of course, the study's findings
don't come without a bit of controver
sy among Internet proponents. Some
argue that wonderful relationships
can be developed online, and that
face-to-face contact isn't always neces
sary to have a healthy, thriving social
life.
"It's true by definition that if you're
spending more hours hitting the key
board you're not spending time with

other people," said Amatai Etzioni, a
sociologist at George Washington
University, in an interview with The
New York Times. "But people do
form very strong relations over the In
ternet, and many of them are relations
that they could not find any other
way."
However, Nie said, this kind of in
teraction can interfere with those who
should occupy the most important
places in the Internet users' lives.
"If you go home at 6 p.m. and
spend three hours e-mailing people
all over the world, you still haven't re
ally seen anyone until the next morn
ing," he said. "You still haven't talked
to your family."
Nie said, though, that he worries
