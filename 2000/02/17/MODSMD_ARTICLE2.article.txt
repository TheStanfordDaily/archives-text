# Study shows Internet use stunts social growth
## 
### MEREDITH ROWE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Practically everything can be done
011 the Internet these days: shopping,
chatting with strangers from all over
the world, e-mailing old friends and
even conducting business.
However, according to a study re
leased yesterday by the Stanford Insti
tute for the Quantitative Study of So
ciety — one of the first ever on the so
cial impact of the Internet — this isn't
necessarily good news.
Statistics gathered show that out of
a sampling of 4,1 13 adults age 18 and
above, 55 percent have Internet ac
cess. Of those, 36 percent spend five
or more hours per week online.
Stanford political scientist Norman
Nie, the principal investigator and co

author of the study with Prof. Lutz Er
bringofthe Free University of Berlin,
said as people are increasingly turn
ing to the Internet for their needs,
they are shutting themselves off from
s< >ciety.
"People who use the Internet at
even modest amounts, such as five to
ten hours a week, are reporting that
they see fewer people, talk to fewer
people and go out less often," he said.
"This definitely merits concern."
In fact, the study (the results of
which can be accessed at
http://www.stanford.edu/group/siqss)
suggests Internet users begin to spend
noticeably less time chatting on the
phone with family and visiting
112 riends: more than 25 percent report
ed a decrease in these social activities.
Nie said that while communicating

with others via the Internet definitely
beats no contact, it can never take the
place of real telephone calls 01 face-to
face conversations.
"The technology that has created e
mail is far superior to no contact at
all," he said. "But I don't think it's su
perior to social contact or even contact
through the telephone. It's a poor
substitute for social interaction."
Of course, the study's findings
don't come without a bit of controver
sy among Internet proponents. Some
argue that wonderful relationships
can be developed online, and that
face-to-face contact isn't always neces
sary to have a healthy, thriving social
life.
"It's true by definition that if you're
spending more hours hitting the key
board you're not spending time with

other people," said Amatai Etzioni, a
sociologist at George Washington
University, in an interview with The
New York Times. "But people do
form very strong relations over the In
ternet, and many of them are relations
that they could not find any other
way."
However, Nie said, this kind of in
teraction can interfere with those who
should occupy the most important
places in the Internet users' lives.
"If you go home at 6 p.m. and
spend three hours e-mailing people
all over the world, you still haven't re
ally seen anyone until the next morn
ing," he said. "You still haven't talked
to your family."
Nie said, though, that he worries

most about the effects Internet
use has on those who have a lim
ited social circle to begin with.
"My concern is much more
about the information worker, he
or she who's not married, who
works alone and spends a great
deal of time alone," Nie said. "I'm
much more concerned about
them."
The presence of family and
friends can serve as a sort of sen
tinel, he said, monitoring and
limiting Internet use.
"I'm a Net-aholic," Nie said.
"But luckily for me, I'm married,
and my wife says, 'Get off, I've got
to talk to you. Get off, we've got to
go somewhere.' She provides
some social discipline."
Before World War 11, Nie said,
people tended to complain about

the "tyranny of family," citing
obligations to others as their
greatest misery. However, after
World War 11, complaints of
loneliness and isolation have
taken the front seat, not coinci
dentally arriving at the same time
as the prevalence of Internet user
For those Stanford students
who spend copious amounts of
time checking course Web pages,
chatting with friends online and
researching for papers, Nie ac
knowledged that the Internet is
an extremely useful resource.
"Definitely, it's an unparal
leled instrumental device for effi
ciency," he said.
"It can't be beat. This is part of
the reason why we've had nine
years of uninterrupted economic
growth. In this case, we know
where our students are, and we
know where their assignments
are," he added.
In the future, however, college
students will have to be careful

not to let their Internet usage in
vade into their personal time.
"Another big issue which faces
all Stanford students in a couple
of years is work," Nie said. "The
Internet is helping to destroy the
boundary between the workplace
and home, which is a threat to
family life."
One of the study's findings
that seemed to challenge conven
tional beliefs is that people actual
ly do not devote much of their
on-line time to e-commerce and
stock trading.
Instead, the study indicates
that just 25 percent of Internet
users spend the time shopping,
and less than 10 percent partici
pate in financial activities such as
online banking or stock trading.
Most people—-84 percent of Inter
net users—cite e-mail as one of
their most frequent online activi
ties.
"To date, in terms of its use,
the Net is a giant library with a

commercial tilt," Niesaid." 1 hat's
what people use it lor, in addition
to ceitain entertainment. Com
mercial activity still represents a
very small amount of it all.
The Stanford study follows
August 1998 findings by
Carnegie Mellon University re
searchers that those who spend a
great deal of time on the Internet
report higher incidences of lone
liness and depression.
In the Carnegie Mellon study,
however, investigators focused
more on psychological problems,
while the Stanford study looks at
the societal impact of Internet
usage as well as demographics.
Nie maintains that as Internet
usage becomes even more wide
spread, social problems will only
increase.
"If you think this is compelling
now," he said, "just wait until
bandwidth increases over the next
lew years.Just wait until the Inter
net is truly an animated world."
