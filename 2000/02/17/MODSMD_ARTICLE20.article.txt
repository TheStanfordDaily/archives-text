## Lacrosse ready for new year New core of freshmen enters mix as team tries to defend its WWLL title 
### EMILY CADEI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the women's lacrosse team
prepares to take the field against
UC-Davis tonight, there will be
more than a few shivers running
up their spines. For nine fresh
men this will be their first glimpse
at collegiate play, first experience
of New Maloney Field under the
lights, first adrenaline rush from
the cheers of the ever-enthusias
tic Stanford sports fans. The rest
of the team has experienced all
this before â€” they know these
emotions and they have missed
them. After a long and sometimes
arduous offseason, they are
ready to play.
The 2000 season is filled with
promise for a young Cardinal
squad, and it will get its first test
against the aggressive and hun
gry Aggies. After losing to the
Cardinal in the Western
Women's Lacrosse League cham
pionship the past two years, there
will be no lack of motivation for
Davis in this year's season open
er. As sophomore Sara Lev ex
plained, "Davis always gets really
pumped up to play us. There is
no love lost between our two
teams."
For Stanford, the return of a
strong sophomore class, bol
stered by the experience of a year
under their belts, and the addi
tion of an exciting and dynamic
crop of freshmen has the team in
credibly optimistic. Add to that
the firepower of sole junior
Katherine Barnes 011 offense and
the morale and leadeiship of five
seniors, including captains
Rachel Gallagher and Christina
Gilyutin, and you have a squad
that will be looking to compete
with the top teams in the nation.
But Davis will not be intimi
dated. A scrappy, physical, and
disciplined team, the Aggies hope
their collapsing style of defense
can counteract the skill of Stan
ford's front line. Davis makes it
hard on opposing offenses by
crowding the middle and em
ploying team defense to stop its
opponent's attacks. Stanford will
have to be cautious in not letting
this sometimes-frenzied style of
play disrupt its offense.
With Barnes, last season's
points leader, missing tonight's
match to attend a funeral, Stan
ford will look to sophomore Car
oline Osterwise and senior Hedy
Born to step up and shoulder
much of the scoring load. Lev
and fellow sophomore Liz Britt
also figure to play an integral role
in the offense.
In the midfield, the blazing
speed and intensity of freshman
Lauren Dietrich and sophomores
Jenny Silverman and Emily Ro
driguez should factor heavily in
helping Stanford control the ball
and tempo of the match.
Sophomore Patti Zettler,
freshman Kim Cahill and Gi
lyutin will anchor the tenacious
Cardinal defense and aid fresh
man goalie Rachel Neumann in
preventing any balls from finding
the net. Neumann, Sara Lev
pointed out, "is a huge asset to the
team. We really have faith in her
back there."
UC-Davis will depend on the
play of senior midfielders Jenna
Rivett and Alison Stonebarger to
lead them to a victory against
their arch-nemesis. Stonebarger,
a second-team All-American last
season, led the Aggies in goals last
year and has set a myriad ol Davis
scoring records. Rivett scored
four goals in the championship
game against Stanford last yeai
and was third on the team in
goals scored for the 1999 season.
As a whole, the (Cardinal squad
feels more than prepared to com
mence its season.
"I think we're ready. Lev said.
"We've had some pretty intense
practices, we're in good shape,
and we are focused. I'm excited to
see how we do."
