# Living out a dream
## Freshman Ron Won takes a break from Stanford golf to shoot a round with the pros 
### MATT LONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's not very often that a college fresh
man sits down to enjoy lunch with golfing
phenom Tiger Woods. It's an even rarer
occasion that an amateur golfer is grant
ed the opportunity to compete in a PGA
tournament.

Ron Won took his moment in stride
this weekend as he teed up in the Buick
Invitational at the Torrey Pines Golf
Club in La Jolla, Calif. Won, Stanford's
top freshman golfer, began Thursday,
hitting a four-over-par 76, then failed to
make the cut Friday with a second
round 77, finishing the first two days at
nine over par. While Won acknowledges
he did not play the best golf of his life, he
walked away from the weekend with
nothing but tremendous memories.
"I was just excited I had the opportu
nity to play," Won said, "I was not wor
ried about how I played and I know I got
the best out of every experience."
Highlighting these memories were
encounters with golfing greats, including
three of Won's personal favorites, Davis
Love 111, Fred Couples and Woods.
Love, who led the first round of the tour
nament, introduced himself to Won as
they both warmed up at the driving
range.
"[Love] was hitting balls behind me
and when he finished he just came right

over and shook my hand," Won said.
Won dined with Woods and Mark
O'Meara on Friday. The tournament
was particularly important for Woods, as
he was going into it with a six-tourna
ment winning streak, the longest in 52
years. He finished tied for second, four
strokes behind winner Phil Mickelson.
"Tiger Woods is rriy role model and I
want to follow in his footsteps," Won said.
"What impressed me most was his char
acter. He was veiy gentleman-like and
down to earth. He made it a comfortable
environment."
Won and his hero talked mostly about
the' course, which is familiar to both
golfers. Woods is the Buick's defending
champion and Won, a native of Irvine,
Calif., has played there many times before.
"Torrey Pines is a great course," Won
said. "It is very tough and had the best
conditions I've ever seen there for the
tournament. Overall, I did not feel as
much pressure as 1 thought I would. I
knew going in that everyone I played
with would be someone good. On the
Tour, just because they don't have a big
name doesn't mean they're not great
golfers."
Won qualified for the Buick 011 Oct. 6
at Torrey Pines by beating out 100 other
hopefuls. This weekend Won finished
second out of the three amateurs who
earned spots in the Invitational. Charley
Hoffman concluded the second day at
one over par and Won beat Russ Bloom
by a stroke.
"My game was not my A' game as
Tiger would say," Won said. "I knew I
didn't have my best game, but I shot as
well as I could have with what I bad. It was

a different environment, especially on the
first tee with the crowds behind me."
Won could easily learn to love the
pressure and crowds of professional golf,
and this weekend just reaffirmed his
dreams of playing on the PGA Tour,
dreams that began at age 11. Like Tiger,
his dad was the one who introduced him
to the game. Won began playing com
petitively at age 13, and his sophomore
year in high school, while visiting Stan
ford on his brother's college visit, he de
cided the Farm was where he desired to
compete collegiately.
In his senior year he attained what
he considers his two greatest golf
achievements. At University High
School in Irvine he was a first-team Ail-
American and set the record for best
round in the California State Champi
onship. Both of these were also accom
plished by Woods, and Won's score of
66 eclipsed Tiger's old mark of 67 to
clinch the state record.
Won knows his path to the profession
al golf world is not one to be tread with
ease. Seeing his heroes in action and
competing along side them has effective
ly inspired him to put even more work
into his game.
"The pro tour is still my goal," Won
says. "This weekend made me realize
that if I still want to get there 1 have a lot
of work to do."
Back on the college level, Stanford is
ranked No. 12 nationally and Won is the
82nd-ranked individual collegiate golfer.
He improves in every match as he be
comes acclimated to the difficult courses
