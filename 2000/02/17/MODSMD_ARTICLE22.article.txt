Sometimes, if you w ant to play tennis, you have to
move indoors.
The Stanford women's tennis team (7-0, 4-0 Pa
cific 10 Conference) has not competed in two weeks
after two dual matches were canceled over the week
end due to rain.
The team's practice schedule has also been ham
pered by the constant showers.
Today, the Cardinal travels to Madison, Wise.,
for the National Indoor Team Championships. The
tournament is played in a facility designed to with
stand tough weather, so the players are guaranteed
some court time.
In last year's event, the Cardinal was ousted by
then-No. 1 Florida in the semifinals. This year, Stan
ford hopes to go all the way.
In the first round, the Cardinal faces No. 13
