# Women's water polo faces off with San Jose State
## Cardinal expects a tough rematch after last weekend's 11-1 thumping of Spartans 
### ELISSA KESZLER 
This Saturday the Stanford
women's water polo team (4-2) will
take on San Jose State at 1 2 p.m. in
the Spartan pool. The Cardinal
cruised to an 11-1 victory over the
Spartans last weekend in San
Diego, but is still expecting a good
match this Saturday because San
Jose will have the home-pool ad
vantage and five additional games
of experience under its belt.
"Last weekend's game against
San Jose State was the first game of
the season for both teams," said
head coach John Tanner. "We got
up to an early lead and caused San
Jose to lose its momentum. As the
tournament continued, San Jose
did increasingly better."
One example of that improve

ment was the Spartan's 11-6 romp
over UC-Santa Barbara, a team
that gave Stanford trouble before
the Cardinal pulled away for a 9-6
win.
This weekend Stanford will
focus on improving defensive skills
and becoming more efficient on its
fast breaks at the beginning of its
counterattacks. The Cardinal is
known for its swimming speed and
its counterattack will be one of its
major weapons this year.
For the past six weeks the Cardi
nal's concentration has been on in
dividual skills, strength training
and conditioning. As it moves into
its season Stanford will begin to
focus on tactical situations and how
to incorporate its individual skills
into its game plan.
The Cardinal also wants to im
prove in its transitional skills in
changing from offense to defense
and in man-up and man-down sit
uations.
"Early in the season many teams
have difficulty in this area," Tanner
said. "We want transition to be in-

Minimal by the end of the season."
Stanford has an exceptional ad
vantage in its tnan-npsituationsbe
canse the team's two lelt-handed
players, juniors Kris kohlik and
Anne-Marie Keenan, allow Stan
lord to be a threat to the goal from
.ill angles.
"()nr goal against San Jose is to
play hard from the beginning and
(.my that momentum through all
loin quarters," said freshmen Amy
1 jghtner.
"San Jose State is a tough team,"

said junior Kelly Shouey. "We will
have to come out playing hard and
consistently if we want to win."
The Cardinal entered last week
end's tournament ranked No. 2.
This ranking was based on Stan
lord's second-place finish to USC
last year at the national collegiate
championships. Alter Sunday's two
losses to U( and USC, Stanford
is now ranked N0.4.
The nation's top lour teams,
USC, UCLA, California and Sum
lord are evenly matched this year.
"'lTie national title could go to
any of these teams this year," Tan
ner said. "'Hie light for first place
will be a battle to the end."
With that in mind, Stanford
looks at ;ill of its games as opportu

nities to learn and expand as a
team, with the intention of improv
ing itself in preparation for the na
tional collegiate championship
tournament this May.
"Every game is an important
step toward our ultimate gc>al of the
national championship," Shouey
said. "We want to use the game this
weekend to improve on things
from our last tournament."
After Stanford's game this Sat
urday it will travel to Santa Barbara
to participate in another preseason
tournament. Like the San Diego
tournament, Santa Barbara's will
host the nation's top teams, giving
Stanford another shot at USC and
Cal, and hopefully allow the Cardi
nal to improve its overall ranking.
