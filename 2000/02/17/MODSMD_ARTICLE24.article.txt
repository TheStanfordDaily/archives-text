# Volleyball braves for some tall Waves
## Team tries to continue winning ways as No. 3 Pepperdine comes to Maples Pavilion 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
I lie Stanford men's volleyball team
returns to Maples Pavilion tonight after
three weekends on the road. But the
squad's welcome home party will be any
thing but relaxing, as the Cardinal (4-6,
4-4 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
laces No. 3 Pepperdine (6-1, 4-1). The
Waves are coming of! a five-game upset
ol No. 4 UCIA, a team that held the cov
eted No. I ranking lor the first month of
play this season.
With four returning starters and two
Ail-Americans, Pepperdine seems un
la/ed by the absence of its all-time kill
leader, outside hitter George Roumain.
Roiiniain graduated last year after gar
nering back-to-back NCAA Player of the
Yeai titles and is now on the U.S. Nation
al I earn bound for Sydney.
A pair of All-American outside hitters
hits made it easy for Waves' fans to let go
of a legend. Roumain, step aside, the
spotlight is now lor junior Scott Wong
and senior Andre Breuer.
"After graduating George Roumain,
everyone thought Pepperdine might

drop off," Stanford head coach Ruben
Nieves said. "But with the arrival of
Andre Breuer [a transfer from Hawaiij
and the added experience of the other
players, 1 think it is a better overall team."
Breuer seems to have had little trouble
adjusting to his new team. The former
Rainbow currently leads Pepperdine
with 152 kills, averaging 6.33 kills per
game. A defensive force as well, Breuer is
third on the squad in blocks with 23.
Wong is not far behind, posting 141 kills,
with a 5.22 per-game average.
Both players boast kill averages good
enough for the top 10 in the MPSF, be
hind Stanford's freshman superstar Curt
Toppel, who leads both the country and
the nation with his 8.41 kills-per-game
average.
But unlike Stanford, which relies on
Toppel to carry most of the offensive
load, Pepperdine has strength beyond its
two main powerhouses, giving oppo
nents nowhere to turn.
"It's hard to just key in on Wong and
Breuer, because their other players are
also strong and capable. UCLA did a
good job containing Wong and Breuer,
but the others hit high percentages,"
Nieves said referring to Wong's measly
.094 hitting percentage and Breuer's
.243, that were counterbalanced by the
hitting percentages of junior Donny Kil
lian (.556) and freshman Brad Keenan
(.548).
Another strength that the Waves
bring to the floor tonight is their domi

nating service game, a hurdle that Stan
ford will have to overcome in order to
succeed.
"Pepperdine serves the ball very ag
gressively," Nieves said. 'They have a lot
of service errors, but the ones that go in
are tough and cause problems for the
other team."
Though Pepperdine has served 201
errors this season, 70 more than Stan
ford, it is second in the conference in aces
with 66, while Stanford only boasts 30.
Both Wong and Keenan are in the top 10
in the conference for service ace aver
ages.
Complicating tilings lor Stanford is a
host of injuries that leaves the squad
scrambling to finalize a starting lineup
that will be indefinite until match time.
After a career-high 48 kills against San
Diego State last weekend, Toppel is suf
fering from a sore shoulder that kept him
out of the UC-San Diego matchup and
may keep him on the bench tonight. Ju
nior middle blocker Brett Youngberg,
second on the team with his 3.68 kills
per-game average, has been nursing a
lingering back problem that has lead to
limited playing time for the past two
weekends. Freshman middle blocker
Paul Bocage rounds out the injury list
with a sprained ankle that prevented him
from playing last weekend.
The new batch of injuries adds to pre
season injuries that left junior setter Brad
Griffith out for the season and senior out
side hitter Josh Palacios out indefinitely.
