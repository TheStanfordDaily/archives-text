# Basketball's solution for beat-the-traffic fans

### 
One of these things is not like the
other: A tiny kid lost in Jason
Collins' cavernous jersey. A hall
court shot to pay for tuition. A
c heck presentation from e-Healthcare.com.
()ne of these things just doesn't belong.
As Stanford's home basketball season
winds to a close, fans filing out of Maples at
halltime has become a common sight. Is it be
cause Maples fans aren't impressed by Mark
Madsen's alley-oop over the (oi vallis Wood
chucks? Are people bored by a 40-point rout
of the Pullman Polecats?
()r should another culprit, like check pre
sentations, take the blame?
f.ven a /aniboni driver can keep hockey
lans in the house between periods. But since
we can not all hope to possess the stamina and
sophistication of hex key fans, it is clear that a
lew improvements must l)e made to keep
Stanford basketball fanatics on the edges of
their seats.
Step No. I: More little kids. Little kids tend
to bungle the simplest of tasks, making for

easy laughs. But when kids come out and re
ally perform, fans are easily impressed.
Anyone who remembers the high-flying
antics of the Karate Kids from San Jose last

year knows what I mean.
Little kid basketball scrim
mages, little kid gymnas
tics, little kid fights: half
time showcases of raw tal
ent are always impressive
to us grown-ups.
But little kids seem to Ik*
in short supply these days.
Consider the Cardinal
Kid's Club Challenge at
the Oregon State game.

Normally, two area youngsters race each
other to half court, put on the enormous jer
seys of Stanford players and race back to the
baseline, dribbling a basketball.
Ixist week's Challenge appeared to pit a
pre-st liexiler againstaCedro freshman in this
battle of quickness and skill. The pre-school
er made it interesting, but he was clearly over

matched.
Quick remedy: monkeys. Several studies
have shown that monkeys are hilarious, espe
cially when dressed up in costumes. Slightly
more skilled than kids, chimpanzees would
surely boost the quality of halftime shows.
After the med school is done with their
"Project X" experiments on these little guys,
send them our way. We'll put them to work at
Maples playing ball, cooking churros and
making us chuckle.
Step No. 2: Revise the T-shirt launch. In
theory, the T-shirt launch is a great idea: pe
riodically incite a frenzy in the crowd by
throwing a free shirt up fin grabs. But who
wants those XL undershirts anyway?
Irately, the only excitement from the launch
occurs in the case of a misfire, when a sno< >zing
alum catches a speeding shirt upside the fine.
Funny? Yes. Potential for disaster? I ligli.
lake the launcher back to its roots and fire
harmless water balloons into the crowd. I his
tactic could awaken more than one alum at a
time, maybe even getting them to make some

noise.
I lie money saved in eliminating I -shin
production could he spent on what the Sixth
Men realh want: gold and silver ingots. Just
launching three or lour such ingots through
out the game would surely please these
diehards and keep them coining hack.
This brings me to Step No. IV. Raise the
stakes. Sinking a hall-court bucket lor two
free plane li( kets is so I 980s, and the free-tu
ition shoot has losi its appeal. Why not shoot
Ibi SI million? Since roughly $1 million is
brought in by Pepsi sales at each home game,
this hardly seems like asking too much.
Maybe you think these improvements are
unrealistic. However, it is clear that basketball
iisell no longer keeps us happy. We want,
need and demand a variety show —entertain
us, or we leave.
