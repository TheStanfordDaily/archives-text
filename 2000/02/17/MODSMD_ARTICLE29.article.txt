# Stanford's ten minutes at Sundance
## 
### STEVEN RAPHAEL SENIOR MUSIC CRITIC 
The Sundance Festival is the ultimate
showcase for independent filmmakers.
Every year, over 2,500 optimistic applicants
submit tapes in the hopes of having their
films screened during the ten days of festivi-

ties. From thousands of submissions, a mere
100 feature films and 60 short films are
selected each year.
Among the few filmmakers honored at
Sundance 2000 were two of Stanford's own
graduate students, Hope flail and Sadia
Shepard. "It was a huge thrill to be at the
Sundance Festival presenting ni\ student
work in a professional context," Shepard
said.
After viewing all ol the films at the festival,
the Sundance Channel those five to pur
chase. Both Hall and Shepard were
approached and offered a "slightly suspi
cious looking piece of paper" which would
give Sundance exclusive domestic rights to
their documentary films. After a couple davs
and a lot of phone calls, both signed. I heir
films will be shown on the Sundance Chan
nel starting this April.
Shepard's film, "Reinvention." is a touch
ing portrait of an 83-year-old inventor
named Pete and bis GG-year-old muse,
Mary. Both widowed, the two of them met at

Mary says during the film. "Well, two out of
three is not bad."
The four-minute film was Shepard's first
venture into the world of non-fiction film.
Originally drawn to film from an interest in
storytelling, she began her film career with
narratives before progressing to real lift* sto
ries. L<x)king to make a film about an inven
tor, she was surprised to find a tale as fanci
ful as her narratives.
" 'Reinvention' is definitely a story that 1
carved out of their reality," Shepard
explained. "It's about how it's possible to
reinvent your life. Pete and Mary are just
determined to have a permanent vacation
together." Shepard skillfully juxtaposes sto
ries and images of Pete's strange inventions
with those ol the love affair to paint a beau
tiful picture of the couple.
Set to swing music, "Reinvention" is a
feel-good piece that leaves viewers smiling.
I lie overall message is one of appreciation
of life. "I'm a person who believes you better
enjo\ every day of your life," Pete says."And
I've got the perfect person to enjoy it with."
Hall's film, "This is for Betsy Hall," is a
six-minute long, deeply personal message
from 11.ill to her mother. "It was a way for
me to speak to her what I have never been
able to speak to her before," I fall said. I he
film was awarded an Honorable Mention at
the festival, the first Sundance honor ever
awarded to a Stanford filmmaker.
When Hall was seven, her mother, suf
fering from bulimia and anorexia, was no
longer able to take care of her children. She
left I fill and her siblings to be raised by their
father. I fill's lather remarried, and she grew
up without her mother. They saw each
other only twice a year until she turned 15.
"She was always this sort of murky enigmat
ic figure in my life," I fall said.

For the last 15 years, 1 fall and her moth
er have been "hashing our way though our
relationship," she said. They talk at least
once a week, but recently, 1 fall realized that
her mother was doing most of the talking.

She began searching lor other ways to
express herself.
After lilniing some footage din ing a rare
family visit, I lall sent ii to her mother, who is
still anorexic and bulimic. Spurred on by an
article about an anorexic woman who uses a
video camera as part of her treatment, Hall
began to Ibrmulate her film.
She interspersed photographs, letters,
and choreographed underwater sequences
to tell the visual story. Flaying over these
images are conversations with her mother,
conversations with her lather, a brief narra
tion, and a mournfully strummed acoustic
guitar. 1 lall said, "Whenever I was confused
about how to edit something, I just tried to
imagine my mom sitting in the audience,
and that actually made it pretu eas\ to edit.'
Hall is deeply moved that her Ii I m has
received so much attention. "1 really onlv
meant lor it to be seen by one person," she
said. "It's encouraging to me that people are
making the ellbrt to speak about things that
are hard to speak about.
"Hvervone has someone tliev know who's
bulimic and anorexic," she said. "It's amaz
ing. When people come up to me after a
screening, everyone lias a story. And yet, it's
pretty well covered over in our culture."
In addition l< > the honor ol being selected
for the festival, actually attending was quite

an experience. "At Sundance," Shepard
said, "you have all of these celebrities and
high profile people in the film industry that
come together to see each other's work and
to make deals. I was very much like a happy

tourist in that aspect."
Although meeting celebrities may not
have meant much to Shepard, it was highly
significant (<> someone important to her. "To
my grandmother, the fact that I met Robert
Red lord means that I'm doing the right
thing with my life. For her to think that is a
wonderful feeling," she said.
What Mall noticed about the festival was
that "the promotional interests have really
gotten out of hand. Sundance has become a
marketplace lor films to be bought and sold,
and lor new projects to get underway." She
felt like the locus of the festival was mis
placed. "What matters is watching the films
and meeting other filmmakers."
I he chance to see other director's films
was tremendously powerful for Shepard,
too. "It's not always so easy to see really good
nonfiction work in our everyday lives," she
explained.
Shepard and Mall are both second year
graduate students in Stanford's documen
tary film program, the only one in the nation
exclusively dedicated to non-fiction film
making. The program accepts just ten stu
dents each year.

socially minded,

STEVEN RAPHAEI/The Stanford Daily
Stanford student filmmakers Sadia Shepard and Hope Hall were featured at the Sundance
Film Festival this year.
lord program have had their films
screened at Sundance over the
years, Communication Depart
ment Chair Kris Samuelson said
that this is the lirst time two stu
dent films have been shown in one
year. Moreover, Hall's honorable
mention is the lirst time that a
Stanford student has received a
Sundance award. "It's probably
the strongest showing we've ever
had al Sundance," Samuelson said.
Stanford's program is intense,
but Shepard said that she's very
glad to be here. Being a part of a
large university was one reason
why she chose Stanford. "1 want to
make films about the world, but 1
don't want to isolate myself in a
world of film," she said.
After making one film per quar
ter during their first year, students
spend their second year making a
longer film. Hall's project is a med
itation on the millennium. The
film is structured like an expanded
countdown, with one minute rep
resenting each of the ten seconds
that .tie counted down immediate
ly before midnight. She wonders
why people have "arbitrarily cho
sen ten seconds of our year that we
infuse with all this meaning, hope,
possibility, vigor, and emotion. My
hope is to make the point that
those ten seconds are passing all
the time, and to instill a sense of a
little more possibility in each ten
seconds that passes."
"Eminent Domain" is the title of

Shepard\s thesis project, which is a
portrait of a small town in Missis
sippi that is being demolished to
make way for a four-lane highway,
ll is both ;i portrait of the town and
its residents, and a deeper look
into the implications of physical
space 011 memory.
"This film will be an examina
tion of life in a small town and how
fragile living history can be," Shep
ard said. "I hope that ultimately
you'll come away from it re-exam
ining the role of the physical spaces
that you inhabit in your own life."
After finishing their thesis pro
jects, both students will graduate
this spring. They are already mak
ing plans for the future.
I lall plans to move to New York
and begin a new life as a "projec
tion artist," pursuing her dream of
being a filmmaker. She said that
she hopes to show her work in a
museum or a gallery because the
setting is quiet and reflective, and
because it requires commitment
for someone to visit one.
Hall said that the one film-relat
ed job she would never consider is
working for television. After a stint
filming d(xumentaries for VH l's
"Behind the Music," she discov
ered that the television world left
her feeling unmotivated.
Aside from that, she hopes to do
a lot of genre crossing. She admits
to wanting to go into Hollywood
filmmaking, but her principle
objective is working on documen
taries. Her ideal future will find
her films being used in museums,
then adapted to lit in a theatrical
production, then shown as a photo
exhibit, and finally made into a

book. That is, until she can think of
more genres where her art will be
appreciated.
Shepard plans to continue mak
ing short films, eventually making
longer ones when she finds the
right subject. "The hope when you
make films," she explained, "is that
you will find people who want to
see them so you can keep working.
Whether that means film festivals
or television, I don't know."
She expects to stick with docu
mentary filmmaking, however. "I
am interested in non-fiction film
making as an approach to living,"
she said. "In making documen
taries, we are constantly throwing
ourselves into different worlds,
meeting new people and con
fronting new situations. I feel like
every experience in my life is
research in some way."
Shepard hopes to teach some
day, so Stanford may be seeing
more of her in the future. Of her
work, she said, "Ideally, I would
really love to have a body of work
that I'm proud of and that shows
some kind of evolution over time."
The beginning of her evolution,
and the other nine documentary
film students, can be seen this
spring. Their thesis films will be
screened in (lubberly Auditorium
on June 10.
"It would be so great to get
more of the Stanford community
involved in our screenings," Shep
ard said. Her film, "Reinvention,"
will also be showing at the San
Film Festival Cinequest on Feb. 29;
and Hall's film, "This is For Betsy
Hall," can be seen online at
