# Stanford's ten minutes at Sundance
## 
### STEVEN RAPHAEL SENIOR MUSIC CRITIC 
The Sundance Festival is the ultimate
showcase for independent filmmakers.
Every year, over 2,500 optimistic applicants
submit tapes in the hopes of having their
films screened during the ten days of festivi-

ties. From thousands of submissions, a mere
100 feature films and 60 short films are
selected each year.
Among the few filmmakers honored at
Sundance 2000 were two of Stanford's own
graduate students, Hope flail and Sadia
Shepard. "It was a huge thrill to be at the
Sundance Festival presenting ni\ student
work in a professional context," Shepard
said.
After viewing all ol the films at the festival,
the Sundance Channel those five to pur
chase. Both Hall and Shepard were
approached and offered a "slightly suspi
cious looking piece of paper" which would
give Sundance exclusive domestic rights to
their documentary films. After a couple davs
and a lot of phone calls, both signed. I heir
films will be shown on the Sundance Chan
nel starting this April.
Shepard's film, "Reinvention." is a touch
ing portrait of an 83-year-old inventor
named Pete and bis GG-year-old muse,
Mary. Both widowed, the two of them met at

Mary says during the film. "Well, two out of
three is not bad."
The four-minute film was Shepard's first
venture into the world of non-fiction film.
Originally drawn to film from an interest in
storytelling, she began her film career with
narratives before progressing to real lift* sto
ries. L<x)king to make a film about an inven
tor, she was surprised to find a tale as fanci
ful as her narratives.
" 'Reinvention' is definitely a story that 1
carved out of their reality," Shepard
explained. "It's about how it's possible to
reinvent your life. Pete and Mary are just
determined to have a permanent vacation
together." Shepard skillfully juxtaposes sto
ries and images of Pete's strange inventions
with those ol the love affair to paint a beau
tiful picture of the couple.
Set to swing music, "Reinvention" is a
feel-good piece that leaves viewers smiling.
I lie overall message is one of appreciation
of life. "I'm a person who believes you better
enjo\ every day of your life," Pete says."And
I've got the perfect person to enjoy it with."
Hall's film, "This is for Betsy Hall," is a
six-minute long, deeply personal message
from 11.ill to her mother. "It was a way for
me to speak to her what I have never been
able to speak to her before," I fall said. I he
film was awarded an Honorable Mention at
the festival, the first Sundance honor ever
awarded to a Stanford filmmaker.
When Hall was seven, her mother, suf
fering from bulimia and anorexia, was no
longer able to take care of her children. She
left I fill and her siblings to be raised by their
father. I fill's lather remarried, and she grew
up without her mother. They saw each
other only twice a year until she turned 15.
"She was always this sort of murky enigmat
ic figure in my life," I fall said.

For the last 15 years, 1 fall and her moth
er have been "hashing our way though our
relationship," she said. They talk at least
once a week, but recently, 1 fall realized that
her mother was doing most of the talking.

She began searching lor other ways to
express herself.
After lilniing some footage din ing a rare
family visit, I lall sent ii to her mother, who is
still anorexic and bulimic. Spurred on by an
article about an anorexic woman who uses a
video camera as part of her treatment, Hall
began to Ibrmulate her film.
She interspersed photographs, letters,
and choreographed underwater sequences
to tell the visual story. Flaying over these
images are conversations with her mother,
conversations with her lather, a brief narra
tion, and a mournfully strummed acoustic
guitar. 1 lall said, "Whenever I was confused
about how to edit something, I just tried to
imagine my mom sitting in the audience,
and that actually made it pretu eas\ to edit.'
Hall is deeply moved that her Ii I m has
received so much attention. "1 really onlv
meant lor it to be seen by one person," she
said. "It's encouraging to me that people are
making the ellbrt to speak about things that
are hard to speak about.
"Hvervone has someone tliev know who's
bulimic and anorexic," she said. "It's amaz
ing. When people come up to me after a
screening, everyone lias a story. And yet, it's
pretty well covered over in our culture."
In addition l< > the honor ol being selected
for the festival, actually attending was quite

an experience. "At Sundance," Shepard
said, "you have all of these celebrities and
high profile people in the film industry that
come together to see each other's work and
to make deals. I was very much like a happy

tourist in that aspect."
Although meeting celebrities may not
have meant much to Shepard, it was highly
significant (<> someone important to her. "To
my grandmother, the fact that I met Robert
Red lord means that I'm doing the right
thing with my life. For her to think that is a
wonderful feeling," she said.
What Mall noticed about the festival was
that "the promotional interests have really
gotten out of hand. Sundance has become a
marketplace lor films to be bought and sold,
and lor new projects to get underway." She
felt like the locus of the festival was mis
placed. "What matters is watching the films
and meeting other filmmakers."
I he chance to see other director's films
was tremendously powerful for Shepard,
too. "It's not always so easy to see really good
nonfiction work in our everyday lives," she
explained.
Shepard and Mall are both second year
graduate students in Stanford's documen
tary film program, the only one in the nation
exclusively dedicated to non-fiction film
making. The program accepts just ten stu
dents each year.

vowed I was
going to look for
a man who's
socially minded,
loves people, and
goes to church,"
