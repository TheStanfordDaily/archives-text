# Leo's 'Beach' leaves audience cold
## 
### MICHAEL PFYL 
Today, in a world saturated
with pagers, cell phones, the
Internet and modern technology,
people often feel lost and discon
nected. This is the premise
behind director Danny Boyle's
latest film, "The Beach," in which
Leonardo DiCaprio plays
Richard, a young American tin ill
seeker desperate to escape the
beaten tourist path and experi
ence something different.
Set in the tropical paradise of
Phi Phi I.e. a small island oil the
coast of Thailand, "The Beach " is
an undeniably beautiful lilni.
However, despite the beautiful
setting and cast, "The Beach"
flounders like a dying fish.
The convoluted plot begins in
a cheap Bangkok hotel, where
Richard meets a crazed, rambling
traveler named Daffy, played In
Robert Carlyle. Daffy tells
Richard about a secret island
untouched by tourists, a paradise

on earth.
I he next day, Richard finds a
map with directions to the island
on his door and discovers that
Dally has committed suicide. He
persuades an attractive French
couple, Francoise (Virginie
Ledoven) and Etienne (Cuillaume
(!!aiiet), who are staying ai the same
seedy hotel, to travel to the island
with him. To get to the beach, they
are forced to swim several kilome
ters across the open sea, evade
armed guards, and jump from the
top of a 120-foot waterfall.
Eventually, they reach their
destination and discover a small
Utopian community of travelers
who welcome them into the
group. Soon lliev lose all desire to
return to the modern world they
knew before. Predictably, all is
not perfect in this heaven on
earth. Multiple allairs and per
sonal conflicts lead to a series ol
violent events that fragment the
community and force the travel
ers to decide how far they arc
willing to go to preserve their par

adise.
While there are some beautiful
scenes in this movie, like when
Richard and Francoise kiss
beneath the surface of the lagoon
at night in the midst of swirling,
biohuninescent plankton, the plot
gets disjointed and ridiculous. In
one scene, Ric hard swims out into
the lagoon to spear fish and is
suddenly surrounded by sharks.
As a Creat White speeds towards
him, Richard extends his hand,
grabs the shark by the nose and
stabs it with a knife, all the while
holding its gnashing teeth at bay.
It's impossible to believe that any
one, much less a pretty boy like
DiCaprio, could pull this off.
Credibility is also stretched later
when Richard inexplicably sinks
into a primitive, Mr. Kurt/ - like
madness straight out of "Heart of
Darkness." He isolates himself
from the community and scav
enges for food in the woods,
makes booby traps, and has imag
inary conversations with Daffy,
the dead lunatic who lirst gave

him the map to the island. None
of this deterioration is adequately
explained. I o make it even
worse, (lin ing this bout of insani
ty Richard envisions himself as
the protagonist of a video game
and for a lew moments we are
forced to watch an animated
DiCaprio traipse through the

woods with a moronic grin on his
face, rac king up game points.
1 lie problem with "The
Beach" is that it tries too hard to
be meaningful. It pushes themes
more skillfull) explored in several
older movies such as "Apocalypse
Now." and "Ford of the Flies,"
and though it's not a complete

disappointment, it falls far short
of these classics.
