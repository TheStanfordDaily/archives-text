# Costello, Bjork fuel quartet's classical music collaborations

Coming from a household
where (Dream albums shared
shelves with Bing Crosby, I've
always been open to listening to a
variety of musical genres. I n choirs
over the years, I've sung Manhat
tan Transfer jazz numbers along
side early Renaissance madrigals
and Handel's Messiah. While most
recently my tastes have tended
towards "chick music," as my
boyfriend puts it, I've always been
receptive to anything that catches
my ear.
One of the genres I have great
ly neglected, however, is classical
music. While I've attended a few
classical concerts and occasionally
used Tchaikovsky as background
music for homework, I must admit
I've never really given classical
music its due. While livelier tunes
get me swaying my arms like a
conductor, the slower, swelling
pieces have always made me want
to find a blanket and curl up to
sleep. Helping me to wake up to
classical music is The Brodsky
Quartet.
The Brodsky Quartet is a
British ensemble that was formed
in 1972. Over the past 2H years,
they have played a varied reper
toire of music, ranging from

Beethoven to Brubeck, Copland
to Elvis Costello. Their most
recent album, "Best of Brodsky
Quartet," is an excellent compila
tion of songs that capture their
musical diversity.
While the majority of the album
is purely instrumental, the quartet
also highlights modern music by
accompanying Klvis Costello and
Bjork. Though Klvis Costello's
lounge-pop voice seems a stretch
lot classical accompaniment on
first thought, the two songs on
which he performs are actually
very well done. His tame voice
melds beautifully with the gentle
swell ol the violins, viola and vio
loncello.
The driving tension and the
fragile soaring of the strings alter
nately contribute heightened pas
sion and tenderness to a remake of
Bjork's "Hyperballad." Bjork's
voice, with her quirky Icelandic
accent, is soft and childlike on the
verses. Yet when she breaks into
her rich, powerful chorus, the
arching climax of the strings
brings an intense force that is lack
ing in the programmed beats of
the original version of this song.
Songs from Gershwin's musical
opera "I'orgy and Bess" have been
interpreted multiple times by
artists like Ella Eitzgerald, janis
|oplin, and Diana Ross. "Summer

time" and "Bess, You is My
Woman Now" in the hands of The
Brodsky Quartet leaves the focus
on the beautiful melodies that tell
stories even without words.
Dave Brubeck's "Strange
Meadow Lark" and Aaron Clop
land's lively "Hoe Down" should
also be familiar to anyone who
pays attention to the music accom
panying commercials.
Amidst standard classical music
like Prokofiev's "March in C," less
familial songs are likewise worthy
of attention. There are the playful
tunes like "Dan/a espanola,"
which are reminiscent of the Rus
sian Jewish folk tunes of "Fiddler
on the Roof'. "Nanatsu-no-ko," a
Japanese folk song, is a heart
breakingly tender piece that
deserves more than a cursory lis
ten.
"Best of Brodsky Quartet" is a
great introduction of classical
music to the modern ear. Every lis
tener should be able to find a gem
in this beautiful collage of old and
new music.
