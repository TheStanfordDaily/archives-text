# 'New Directions' for young jazz artists
## 
### STEVEN RAPHAEL SENIOR MUSIC CRITIC 
"New Directions" could just as
well have been called dreg Osby
and the Blue Note All-Stars
explore the blue Note catalog. I he
album is the result of tenor saxo
phonist Osby being asked by the
label to choose his favorite young
signecs and cover some of the
label's classic hits. As a result, the
album features some of the most
talented young jazzmen of this era.
In an interesting instrumenta
tion choice, Osby selected both a
pianist and a vibraphonist. Pianist
Jason Moran is a risk taker, never
afraid to throw in an off-beat or
dissonant chord. His playing is
always distinctive, but it's often
hard to decide if what he is doing
is helping or hurting the music.
Vibraphone player Stefbn Har
ris adds light subtle counter
melodies that sweeten any song
and solos that are surprisingly
solid for a naturally airy instru
ment. I lis playing is often the high
light of the album. "Beatrice" lea
ttires the two in an inspiringly
romantic duet.
Both saxophonists, Osby and
Mark Shim, blow powerfully emo
tional improvisations. On tracks
like "Tom rhumb," the unique
arrangement has them weaving in
and out of one another. Osby
opens the song with a high singing
phrase on the alto sax. While this
repeats, Shim then comes in on
tenor sax with the melody before
the two parts converge into har
monies.
Not every song fares as well,
however. Horace Silver's "Song
For My Father" was originally an
upbeat, catchy bossa nova piece.
Here, the catchy saxophone
melody feels somewhat awkward
over the odd piano accompani
ment. This illustrates the problem

with musicians attempting to
retoixl new versions of classic jazz

tunes. Often, they make bad
changes simply to be different.
Yet, New Directions clo succeed
in giving many of the songs they
cover new life. In "Song For My
Father," following the awkward A
section, the vibraphone takes the
melody for the B section. Upon
returning to the A section, the
vibraphone continues to offer
sparse commentary on the melody.
A reworked version of Joe I len
derson's "Recorda Me" features
the piano playing a repeated riff,
while the vibraphone inserts gentle
chords beneath the harmonized
saxophone melody. Unexpected
twists like these keep a listener on
his toes and make the overall expe
rience more pleasurable.
Throughout the album, the cre
atively solid has* and drums
anchor the group. Consistently
top-notch solos are the icing on
this jazz cake, which overall is a
very satisfying look back at the
Blue Note catalog through the
eyes of musicians not old enough
to remember when.
