# Jazz Legend Metheny and his latest triumph
## 
### STEVEN RAPHAEL SENIOR MUSIC CRITIC 
It's difficult to be critical when
evaluating a new album from a
legend.
Pat Metheny is without a
doubt one of the best and most
influential guitarists of all time.
His work has helped to define
jazz guitar.
Yet he has never allowed him
self to be limited to straight jazz.
Part of what has defined his
work is his willingness to experi
ment.
On the other hand, it's also
difficult to praise a new album
from a legend.
With so many quality record
ings under his belt, how can one
possibly hope to compare his
work on this album to his previ
ous work?
Even amazing music might
somehow fall below his norms.
" Frio 99>00" features Methe
ny with bassist Larry Grenadier
and drummer Bill Stewart.
Playing in a trio can be one of
the most challenging musical
experiences for a musician
because there is no room to hide.
To his credit, much of Methe
ny's best work has been with
trios.
One area in which Metheny
has previously experimented is
with different synthetic tones
and effects.
On "Trio," Metheny limits
himself to clean, natural sounds.
His guitar gets a sweet warm
tone that keeps a listener's atten
tion while still sounding pleas
ant.
The album has a slightly mel
low feeling overall.
The songs are as varied as one
would expect from such a versa
tile artist.
"(Go) Get It" is one of three
fast-paced jazz numbers, show
casing the power and speed of
Metheny.
He weaves flowing melodic
lines that are pushed onward by

the incessantly driving drum
beats.
"What Do You Want" is
another thriller of a song, pack
ing pure excitement into its
solos.
)<>llll Coltrane's challenging
"Giant Steps" is slowed down
from its standard breakneck
pace for a unique guitar inter
pretation.
The slow tempo allows Methe
ny to really explore the implica
tions of the odd chord changes.
"Soul Cowboy" is a medium
tempo gem, showcasing Methe
nv's ability to be tasteful while
interspersing harmonic patterns
into bis sweet solos.
Other songs feature Metheny
on acoustic guitar, playing beau
tifully composed pieces that
would make a classical guitarist
proud.

"We Had a Sister" is a mellow
piece that is more classical than
jazz. It is a beautiful song, and
fits nicely with the overall feel of
the album.
"Travels" could almost be a
radio hit if the right vocal shared
Metheny's melody.
"Trio 99>00" finds living leg
end Pat Metheny in fine form.
Now 4fj, he has clearly aged
well as a musician, and will con
tinue to shape the future of jazz
guitar for years to come.
