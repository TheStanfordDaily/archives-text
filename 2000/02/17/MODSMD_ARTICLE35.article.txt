# Nothing new in 'God's Country'

### CHRIS CROWELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
San Jose Stage Company's
mounting of Steven Dietz's <I<Hll<l
rama "C i<kl's (Country" tak<'s its title
and theme music from one <>l 12's
In'st-known songs, but the similari
ties iK'tvveen the playwright and
pop star Bono's creative efforts
don't end,there. Both are well-per
fbrined and well-presented. Both
are trying to say something pro
found. And both make the audi-

ence It-el tli;it it has heard the mes
sage before.
"Cod's Country" is about the
19M Denver murder of Alan Berg
(played by Randall King), an out
spoken and controversial Jewish
talk radio host. Berg was killed by
members of a militant white
supremacist group called the
()rder, and the play weaves togeth
er the story ol the Order's violent
rise with the narrative ol Berg's last
days.
1 he narrator describes Berg as
a "bleeding heart liberal with an
acid tongue," and King is convinc

ing in the role. Hunched over a
microphone in 1970s hippie-style
attire, Berg chain-smokes his way
through on-air harangues directed
against his callers.
I he Order is led by Robert Jay
Matthews (John Flanagan), who
easily matches Berg's charisma.
Matthews espouses his racist con
victions in hypnotic chants accen
tuated by boot-stomping and pac
ing about the set. Flanagan man
ages lo capture the insanity of
blind hatred in his eyes and in his
unpredictable, restless movement.
Berg and Matthews are both
presented as unpleasant charac
ters, but Diet/, never adds depth to
his depictions. We never under
stand what motivates Berg or
Matthews at a personal level, and
so we are never allowed to
empathize with their condition.
Diet/ seems more concerned
with giving a general account of
the white supremacy movement.
He delights in exposing promi
nent Americans' (Henry Ford,
Charles Lindbergh) hidden Nazi
sympathies, and he revels in
uncovering the line line which
seperates the American Pastoral
from the American Berserk
(female Order members indoctri
nate their children while darning
socks).
Diet/ lets us know how much he
disapproves ol white supremat ism
by Hashing timcworn homilies
across the television screens
mounted over the stage.
There is little new here, and I
wish that the c ast's considerable tal
ent could have been put to better
use.
