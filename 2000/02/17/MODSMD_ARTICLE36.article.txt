# Chinese historical drama could rule Oscars

### RANDY MANO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Some themes are timeless. For
bidden love, for example, reared
its head for a reincarnation in
"Titanic." Gong l.i's latest role in
"The Emperor and the Assassin,"
meanwhile, is a tribute to the age
old ideas of love and war. A glori
ous epic has been directed by
Kaige Chen in a style more believ
able and involving than Gibson's
"Braveheart" or Costner's
"Waterworld."
"Emperor" has a bit of history
to it: The kingdoms of China
remain separated around 200
8.C., and Ying Zheng (played by
Xuejian I.i), the King of Qin terri
tory, wants to unify them all into
one glorious empire.
His lady friend, the beautiful
Lady Zhao (Gong Li), has a

haunted past hut tries to hide her
desires behind an exterior of
placid calm.
Interesting additions to the
mix are Marquis (Zhiwen Wang),
a seemingly loyal and happy-go
lucky servant to the Qin, and Jing
Ke (Fengyi Zhang), a hired assas
sin who grows weary of his job
alter a terrifying incident involv
ing a blind girl.
That brings up one thing to
note from "Emperor." Scenes
with children are scorched into
memory because of the high lev
els of horror and shock.
One example: When a city is
being massacred by the Qin war
riors, children happily jump off
the city walls in order to die with
pride. What a vivid image and
message.
"Emperor" is a far cry from
two of (ion g Li's other acting

efforts, "Farewell My Concubine"
and "To Live." The drama
between the assassin and the King
takes too long to build up â€” my
guess is that a good handful of
minutes could have edited from
the middle third of the film, when
the relationship between the
assassin and Lady Zhao is devel
oped.
Another problem is the transfor
mation of the King. Ying Zheng
begins the story as an intelligent,
forgiving ruler; he ends as a mani
acal, power-hungry and ruthless
dictator of sorts.
"Emperor" makes the shift a bit
too abruptly and unbelievably in an
otherwise realistic and smooth pro
duction.
Hopefully, this entry from
China will get nominated by the
Academy this week in the foreign
language film category. The bat

tie scenes are truly exciting, with
all sorts of ancient gadgetry and
kill techniques to pump up the
action. Gong Li, as always, makes
you wonder why there aren't
more talented Asian actors
involved in Hollywood today.
So add a little culture to com
plement those Euro-centric histo
ry courses, and take in an audi
ence-friendly introduction to the
beginnings of the Chinese
empire.
And don't worry, there are
subtitles for this Mandarin-lan
guage film.
