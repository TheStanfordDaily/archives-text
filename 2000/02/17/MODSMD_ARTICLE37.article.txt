# Keitel gets too close to his feminine side in Jane Campion's quirky 'Holy Smoke'
## 
### JAD FAKHRY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Holy Smoke," directed by
Jane (lampion (The Piano) falls
short not because of any lack of
talent, but because of the sudden
and drastic transformation of the
characters and plot. Ruth (Kate
Wiuslet) travels to India and is
taken over by a male cult. Her
alarmed parents, employ l'.|.
Waters (Harvey Keitel) to
"deprogram" her and return her
permanently to her home, Aus
tralia.
Keitel and Winslet both act
remarkably well and fill their
roles with all the restrained emo
tional, spiritual, and dramatic
flair that have marked their pre
vious roles. Keitel's role as the
professional who can reverse the
messiest situation is reminiscent

of his role in "Pulp Fiction."
While he does not live up to pre
vious performances in "Mean
Streets" and "Pulp Fiction," it his
not as much bis fault as it is the
fault of the ridiculous premise in
this film. Winslet is convincing
both in the scenes in India when
she is part of the cult and in Aus
tralia when she is not.
I he movie starts off with
Winslet as a spiritual cult follower
of an Indian guru, and ends with
her and Keitel falling into a deep,
spiritual love in Australia. This
sudden love is exactly where the
film becomes a little hard to swal
low. That Keitel could come
under the spell of Winslet's
charm is hard to believe. In the
beginning, Keitel is a coarse,
masculine figure while Winslet
embodies the exact opposite. In
the end, Keitel lias become soft

er, more sensitive and Winslet
stronger and more powerful.
What makes some of this
movie enjoyable and interesting
is its weirdness- how much both
characters change from their ini
tial states. It is difficult, again, to
believe Keitel after seeing him in
his previous roles. Another rea
son why the movie might have
failed is its overly feminine tone.
Not that feminine movies are
bad, it is just that this idea is ham
mered into the viewer's head
over and over again until it
becomes excessive.
While the ending and premise
might not be perfectly set up, the
screenplay and dialogue are well
crafted and the* panoramic shots
of the Australian outback are
mesmerizing. The cinematogra
phy captured the tone of the
Indian cult and the spell that

Winslet fell under remarkably
well.
It was just so hard to believe
Keitel's transformation after his
macho role in "Mean Streets." In
that movie his girlfriend, trying
hard to penetrate his thick shield
of masculinity, asks what he likes
and all he can muster is "I don't
know ... I like chicken with lemon
and garlic." He finally adds "I
like you" after she continues to
prod him. In "Holy Smoke" he is
just a bit too quick to answer to
Winslet's advances, making this
quirky turn a bit too quirky.
