# 'Beach' author gets deep into characters
## 
### RENEE CANADA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Still relatively young for a writer, Alex Gar
land lias already proven that lie is a master of
his t rillt. His first novel, "The Beach," was a
best-seller and is now being released as a
movie. Similarly, Garland's latest novel, "The
I esseract," has won rave reviews.
"The Fesseract" is a suspenseful story that
brilliantly weaves the lives of three unique
sets of characters. Fate tragically brings these
characters together when a misunderstand
ing is taken to a deadly extreme, l old from
three dilferent perspectives, Garland has
written an intense, thought-provoking tale.
I lie story begins with Sean, an inexperi
enced British merchant seaman who is sent to
the- Manila to meet with a Filipino mafia lord,
Don I'epe. I rapped in a seedy hotel until
their appointment, Sean becomes paralyzed
by lear and paranoia. He is overcome by the
suspicion that the menacing Don Pepe and
his henchmen are planning to kill him. When
they finally meet, Sean panics, sparking a
deadly chase through the streets of Manila.
Meanwhile, in the suburbs, a mother of
two young children reminisces about her
past. Back in the remote island where she

grew up, Rosa abruptly left behind a passion
ate childhood romance. In Manila, she has
gone on to marry a man she loves and to bear
his two children. Still, it is impossible for Rosa
to erase the painful memory of her first love.
Also haunted by the memory of a lost love
is Alfredo, a wealthy psychologist studying
Filipino urban youths. He is particularly fas
cinated by the dreams of a street kid named
Vincente. Years earlier, Vincente's father
brought him to the city on a bus and disap
peared, leaving Vincente to fend for himself.
Then Vincente met Totoy, the diminutive
son of a drug addict, who would become his
best friend and constant companion on the
streets of Manila. During one of their more
exciting adventures on the run, Totoy and
Vincente accidentally get caught up in the
chase that ties together all of the separate sto
ries of the novel.
With the tesseract, a three-dimensional
unfolded cube, as his metaphor, Garland uses
the intersection of the three threads of his
story to explore the reasons why things hap
pen the way they do in this world. Neither
fate nor science alone can answer this ques
tion, so perhaps somewhere between the two
lies the answer. This is a question Garland
never tries to answer, but one can't help
admiring his intelligent and refreshing explo-
