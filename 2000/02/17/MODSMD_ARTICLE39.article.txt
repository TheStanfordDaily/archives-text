# Drug novel a bad trip
## 
### STEVEN RAPHAEL SENIOR MUSIC CRITIC 
"Prescription for Mayhem" is
based upon an interesting premise.
To finally solve many problems
within the United States, Congress
decides to legalize drugs â€” all
drugs. Prescriptions are no longer
needed, and drug dealers are no
longer criminals who must be dealt
with. The bcx>k follows the effects of
legalization on seven people,
including a doctor, a policeman and
a drug addict.
Although the concept is interest
ing, Mohnarke's writing is simply
not believable. When facing a
premise so outrageous, it is impor
tant for an author to keep one f<M>t
firmly planted in reality.
Writers such as Aldous Huxley
and George Orwell have examined
similarly outrageous premises, yet
have clone so in a realistic manner
that left readers unsure if the situa
tion might really arise. During a
1938 radio broadcast of his story,
"The War of the Worlds," H.G.
Wells was able to convince most of
America that Martians were invad
ing by keeping everything else in
his story realistic. Yet, even before
Molmarke has Congress passing
the legalization bill, he has com
pletely discarded all credibility.
For instance, at the Congress

meeting, the Speaker of the House
of Representatives easily bullies the
Congress into accepting his deci
sion. He refuses to acknowledge
any point of view other than his
own, and quickly manages to get all
of ihe Congressmen to assent.
Meanwhile, another Congressman
orders a quart of whiskey and coffee
to make Irish coffee, as he always
does iu times of duress. By the end
of the meeting, after loudly inter
rupting the meeting with a belch
and a fart, lie has passed out and is
softly snoring in a pool of his own
urine.
The next day, he is summoned
by the Speaker of the House and
named head of the committee.
With this shaky of a beginning, a
reader has trouble placing any con
fidence in the rest of the book.
What could have been a significant
examination of the drug policies of
the United States becomes a ridicu
lous farce. Mohnarke's book falls
short of meaningful, veering off
towards poorly written and ridicu
lous instead.
