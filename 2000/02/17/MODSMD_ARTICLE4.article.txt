# Religious groups split on Prop. 22

### AMY L. KOVAC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While five Palo Alto churches
have joined a group of South
Bay churches that are actively
opposing Proposition 22, cam
pus religious organizations re
main divided over the contro
versial "limitation of marriage"
initiative. The measure will ap
pear on the March 7 California
Primary ballot.
Also known as the Knight Ini
tiative, Prop. 22 would amend
the California Family Code by
adding the sentence, "Only mar
riage between a man and a
woman is valid or recognized in
California."
While same-sex marriage is
not legal in any state, this mea
sure would complicate future at
tempts to make it legal in Cali
fornia.
Prop. 22 is supported by anti
gay organizations and is viewed
by some as a purely anti-gay
measure.
Divisions over this issue are
apparent within the religious
community on campus.
Ihe national Mormon
Church supports the initiative
and has joined a coalition of
other religious groups and orga
nizations working to secure its
passage.
According to senior Mark

Nladsen, student leader of the
Stanford Latter Day Saints Stu
dent Association, "The Church
is supporting the campaign for
Prop. 22 and many church
members are volunteering their
time. As far as the LDSSA goes,
LDS students on campus have
not been formally organized."
Similarly, the California
Catholic Bishops' official posi
tion is to support the initiative.
However, Father Patrick La-
Belle of the Catholic Communi
ty at Stanford said, "I am not so
sure that changing the defini
tion of marriage is the best way
to ensure equality, but the whole
matter remains a bit unclear for
me. My hope is that this initia
tive will not stifle serious discus
sion about the broader issues [of
family values]."
However, there are some
campus religious leaders who
not only oppose the measure,
but are actively speaking out
against it.
Reverend D. Maurice
Charles, associate dean for reli
gious life, opposes the proposi
tion and spoke out against it in a
forum held in October of last
year that was sponsored by the
United Campus Christian Min
istry.
I he forum was an event for


The All Saints Episcopal Church is one of five Palo Alto churches that that
have united to defeat Proposition 22, the Knight Initiative against gay
marriages. The religious communities on campus, however, are divided
on the issue.
