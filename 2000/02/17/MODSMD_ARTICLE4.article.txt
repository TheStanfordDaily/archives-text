# Religious groups split on Prop. 22
## 
### AMY L. KOVAC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While five Palo Alto churches
have joined a group of South
Bay churches that are actively
opposing Proposition 22, cam
pus religious organizations re
main divided over the contro
versial "limitation of marriage"
initiative. The measure will ap
pear on the March 7 California
Primary ballot.
Also known as the Knight Ini
tiative, Prop. 22 would amend
the California Family Code by
adding the sentence, "Only mar
riage between a man and a
woman is valid or recognized in
California."
While same-sex marriage is
not legal in any state, this mea
sure would complicate future at
tempts to make it legal in Cali
fornia.
Prop. 22 is supported by anti
gay organizations and is viewed
by some as a purely anti-gay
measure.
Divisions over this issue are
apparent within the religious
community on campus.
Ihe national Mormon
Church supports the initiative
and has joined a coalition of
other religious groups and orga
nizations working to secure its
passage.
According to senior Mark

Nladsen, student leader of the
Stanford Latter Day Saints Stu
dent Association, "The Church
is supporting the campaign for
Prop. 22 and many church
members are volunteering their
time. As far as the LDSSA goes,
LDS students on campus have
not been formally organized."
Similarly, the California
Catholic Bishops' official posi
tion is to support the initiative.
However, Father Patrick La-
Belle of the Catholic Communi
ty at Stanford said, "I am not so
sure that changing the defini
tion of marriage is the best way
to ensure equality, but the whole
matter remains a bit unclear for
me. My hope is that this initia
tive will not stifle serious discus
sion about the broader issues [of
family values]."
However, there are some
campus religious leaders who
not only oppose the measure,
but are actively speaking out
against it.
Reverend D. Maurice
Charles, associate dean for reli
gious life, opposes the proposi
tion and spoke out against it in a
forum held in October of last
year that was sponsored by the
United Campus Christian Min
istry.

The All Saints Episcopal Church is one of five Palo Alto churches that that

marriages. The religious communities on campus, however, are divided
on the issue.
those in the on-campus religious
community in opposition to the
Knight Initiative.
Student representatives from
a variety of religious groups at
tended.
Charles, who performs over
liU weddings a year in Memorial
Church, said, "Same-sex unions
are in no way a threat to the insti
tution of marriage."
While Memorial Church as a
body does not have a stance on
the issue, Charles said, "I will def
initely be voting against the ini
tiative."
Jim Burklo, campus minister
tor UCCM, also opposes the mea
sure. Burklo has performed a
holy union service for a gay cou
ple and said he found it to be a
very moving experience.
"The commitment of these
two men to a life-long, loving,
caring partnership was obvious
to the many people who attend
ed. ;VJ)fir, ,sy;ei)gf l\en*;di
my conviction that a place needs
to be made in our culture for the
blessing of gay and lesbian rela
tionships and for ensuring that
such couples have legal protec
tions and responsibilities that fol
low from such bonds," Burklo
said.
Burklo also added, "1 have
seen signs that say 'Yes on Knight
— Protect Marriage' but 1 think
the opposite is the case. In order
to protect marriage, we must vote
noon this proposition."
Sophomore Ryan Boehner, a

peer minister for the Stanford
Lutheran Campus Ministry,
voiced the Lutherans' strong op
position to the measure.
"Personally, I cannot in good
conscience support or frankly
stomach the thought of condemn
ing an entire segment of the popu
lation that seekft ights equal to the
rest of the population and wants to
live by the same values we claim to
treasure," he said.
Boehner said the Lutheran
Ministry will join the Bay Area
churches in weekly meetings that
will culminate in a candlelight vigil
on March 6, the eve of the vote.
Boehner, Luther
an Campus Chaplain Richard Fos
ter, cites Bishop Emeritus Stanley
Olsen in opposing the initiative.
"Proposition 22 is similar to past
laws forbidding the right of mar
riage (or all African Americans in
our nation. Proposition 22 de
serves a 'NO' vote. It is unworthy
of the people of a great state and
nation," Olsen has said.
Benjamin Davidson, director
of the Lesbian, Cay, Bisexual
Community Center, said that al«
though lu.* knows some students
on campus are opposed to the
measure, no one has come to him
via a religious organization to vo
calize their opposition.
"I have not been personally
contacted bty any religious
groups on campus with regards
to this issue," he added.
But. Davidson said he believes
that in the coming weeks there
will be a growing movement of
collaboration between the les
bian, gay and bisexual communi
ty and various religious organiza
tions to ensure a "no" vote.
