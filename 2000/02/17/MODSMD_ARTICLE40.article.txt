### STEVEN RAPHAEL SENIOR MUSIC CRITIC 
"The Gift of Fear: Survival Sig
nals That Protect Us From Vio
lence" just may save your life. Its
central thesis is that true fear is a
gift; by trusting your intuition,
you can know when you are in
clanger and how to best deal with
the situation. In addition to
telling you when you are in dan
ger, learning to heed your intu

it ion can help you know when
you are not in danger, reducing
needless worry.
Author Gavin de Becker is one
of the nation's leading expert on
predicting violence. He is a three
time presidential appointee and
the designer of MOSAIC, the sys
tem used to evaluate threats on
Supreme Court Justices. His firm
has overseen the advisement and
management of over 18,000
cases, including celebrities, abor

tion clinics, and domestic violence
cases.
De Becker says that, regardless
of his years of experience, you are
also an expert in predicting vio
lence. He says that you just need
to listen to your intuition. Toward
this end, he presents many specif
ic situations in which violence is a
possibility and explains what signs
to look for.
By explaining the warning
signs and the best ways to deal

with them, de Becker presents a
self-intuitive survival guide. He
adds a human element to this by
presenting specific cases, includ
ing the case that he says taught
him the most: a woman holding
her husband at gunpoint. As he
watched, his mother pulled the
trigger, shooting at his father.
This was not an isolated incident
in de Becker's childhood, and it
was one of many that led him to
his current career.

l)t- Becker presents three goals
which will allow you to live free of
fear, except when warranted.
They are: "1. When you feel fear,
listen. 2. When you don't feel
fear, don't manufacture it. ,'i. If
you find yourself creating worry,
explore and discover why."
In a wonderfully articulate
manner, de Becker elaborates
these three goals, ultimately
teaching you to "harness and
respect your ability to recognize

survival signals. . . . [to] see haz
ard only in those stormclouds '
where it exists and [to] live lile >
more fully in the clear skies,
between them."
