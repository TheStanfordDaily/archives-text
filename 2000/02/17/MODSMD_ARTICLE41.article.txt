### Roxy Sass 
You're rubbing your hot and
sweaty body all over your lover.
Your kisses are growing more
frantic, and your hips are thrust
ing like a locomotive chugging up
a steep hill as you moan and sigh
and pant. You're nearing break
ing point, you're sure you're
going to explode ...
The phone rings.
Do you answer it? It's probably
your mom. Picking up might not
be worth pulling out, but maybe
you're interested in tangling your
bodies in coiling phone cords and
having a nice chat, fit her way, the
interruption of a phone presents
an interesting twist for your
romantic tryst.
Why answer the phone at all,
you ask? For the 'M percent of
Americans who have talked on the
phone during some form of sex,
it's the tin ill of the challenge —
how well you can hide what you're
really doing from the person on
the other end of the line?
You say that you're watering
the plants or using your I high
master as you smuggle orgasms
under the pillows, but certainly
you and your lover know what
you're really doing. You can talk
about your grades going up as
your pulse rate rises and discuss
the weather as vou start to sweat.

Th e
whole point of
the experi
mental exer
cise is to see
how long you
can keep from
cracking up or
yelling out,
and your sex
will feel more
daring. Fur
thermore, you
and your
lover will

share this special secret of what
you were doing while mom was
chatting about her new bedroom
suite, and the winks and laughs
will bring you closer and make
you feel more connected.
Consider how easy it would be:
Mom: Hi sweetie, what's up?
You: (Watching your lover run
a tongue over your body) Oh,
everything's up here. I mean,
everything's great, yeah. . .
Mom: Really? What's that
squeaking in the background I
hear? Are you panting?
You: ()H, ooooh, (smack, lick)
I'm just doing ;i new aerobics rou
tine, mom. Lots of leg lifts and hip
raises. Really gels me excited, gets
my heart rate up. Oh, bold on, I
think I need to sneeze. . .
Mom: You're sic k, too?
You: . . .ohhhoooooohhh,
(sigh, moan, climax) achoo!
You can explore other sexual
options by using the phone itself
as an enhancer of sexual pleasure.
In this case, having a cordless
spoils all the fun. A phone cord
can be used to tie a person's hands
together as you continue to chat
with mom, and (oils of the phone
cord create unique sensations
when rolled or pulled along your
lover's body, or twine it around
both of you until there's no way

you could get off the phone even
if you tried.
"Not now, mom, I'm having an
oorgassmmmm," Miss Sass said,
suddenly noticing the horrified
expression on her lover's face.
Guess that isn't one she'll be bring
ing home anytime soon.
For some reason, Miss Sass's
lover didn't see the fun in sharing
play-by-play details with a
parental unit. But why not? II
Mom calls, there's no reason to be
shy — just admit what's up, what's
in and what's out.
She obviously understands the
joy of copulation or you wouldn't
be on the phone with her in the
first place. She might even have
some tips that were lost in the gen
eration gap.
It's perfectly normal to want
other people to know you're hav
ing sex. After all. the third most
common American fantasy of both
heterosexual males and females is
to have other people observe their
sexual activity in some way.
Freud would probably say that
having your mom or dad listen
while you have sex is a safe way to
release the frustrations of your
Oedipal complex. He insists that
an undercurrent of eroticism
underlies every intimate and
affectionate interaction. Thus,
every young child forms an erotic
attachment to the parent of the
opposite sex. II the Oedipal com
plex is never resolved, the child
will grow up still wanting to have
sex with the parent. Freud would
touch himself in glee il you told
him that, while having sex with
mom or dad on the phone, you
fantasize about having sex with
your parent, or maybe you even
hope that your parent will become
aroused by listening to your
moans.
Miss Sass doesn't buy it. More

likely, if you get oil on letting your
parents listen in, it's because you
feel like it lets you reveal your
wild, rebellious side in a more cre
ative way than dyeing your hair
orange. You want to raise some
eyebrows, but you're not thinking
about raising much else.
Or, maybe it's your way of say
ing, "Hey dad, I finally lost my vir
ginity!" (Honey, it's about damn
time.) It's much easier to be dar
ing and revealing about your sex
life behind the mask of a phone
— why else would phone sex be
so popular?
Miss Sass has been interrupted
by a phone call from a mother
more times than she has sex in a
week-an extraordinarily high
number, to be sure —so it's
bound to happen to you at some
point. While having a close rela
tionship with your parents is a
good idea, some people still aren't
comfortable with sharing every
aspect of their lives with mom.
While the sound of your mom's
sweet and unassuming voice on
the answering machine may be
potentially embarrassing for
some, it can be a huge turn-on for
anyone with some degree of Oedi
pal fascination. Miss Sass thinks
that even someone who doesn't
have much sexual interest in Mom
will smirk at the irony of the situa
tion. After the answering machine
goes beep and you thrust deep,
you can enjoy the sound of your
mom's voice and smirk at your
downright naughtiness.
Rather than letting the phone
become a nuisance when it 1 ings,
it's better to accept it and use it to
further your sexual enjoyment
somehow, whether through fanta
sy or the value of a competitive
challenge. Clearly, the phone itself
ton Id be used as an erotic toy, but
that's another story. . .
