Devotees of Indian cuisine
often wish that dishes came in
larger portions, but the secret to
sampling an abundance of rich
curries, desserts, and appetizers
is to try the brunch buffet at Swa
gat in Mountain View.
For a reasonable price of $9,
Swagat offers a daily brunch buf
fet from 1 1 a.m. to !i p.m.
With an array of dishes that
vary from day to day, we sam
pled the buffet on a Sunday and
were pleasantly surprised.
For dinner, I usually cannot
finish my meal if I order all the
Indian specialties 1 love: naan,
basmati rice, chicken tikka
masala and palak paneer, not to
mention mango ice cream and
gulab jamun for dessert.
But at the brunch buffet, I
sampled over ten dishes without
blowing my budget or overeat
ing. The buffet included soft
drinks as well as salad and
dessert.
Among my favorite dishes
were the chicken makhani, bone
less chicken cooked in a spicy
butter sauce.
lender and flavorful, the
chicken dish was pungently
smooth without overwhelming
the taste buds.
1 also enjoyed the aloo palak,
a potato and spinach dish
cooked with traditional Indian
spices.
My roommates found the
samosas ;i little too salty, but they

were quick to defend the naan,
traditional Indian bread, and
basmati rice that they used to
soften the spicy taste of many of
the dishes.
Other traditional Indian dish
es offered include tandoori
chicken, vegetable koorma, egg
plant curry, sambar (lentil and
vegetable soup, and chicken
masala.
I finished off my meal with
mango ice cream and gulab
jamun, a traditional Indian
dessert made with cheese.
1 have never had mango ice
cream from a soft serve machine
before, but it was so delicious my
roommate gave me the brilliant
idea of buying a machine for our
room.
Swagat serves lunch and din
ner in addition to the buffet, and
specializes in South Indian cui
sine, with dishes including
madras specialities, vegetarian
entrees, and tandoori dishes
cooked in a clay oven.
With simple decor and excel
lent service, Swagat is appropri
ate for both large parties and
intimate gatherings.
In the main room booths line
the side walls and in the back
private rooms are available for
large parties.
