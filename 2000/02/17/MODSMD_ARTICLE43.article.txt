I am hopelessly addicted to the
Internet. I simply can't find ;mv
lliing heller than surfing to lake my
mind oil of the work thai otherwise
would he occupying my screen.
And il I know anything ahoul the
typical Stanford student, you proba
bly have the intravenous
hookup going as well.
I also find myself addicted lo
movies. I he big screen is fascinat
ing, and I enjoy knowing as much
as 1 c an about c inema.
So, on those long nights of typ
ing away, I often find myself feeding
both addictions with .1 long ride
through all (lie movie siles thai littei
cyberspace. Since I might have
more time on in\ hands than vour
self. I II narrow il clown for you.
My | jersonal favorite is a racl littk*

site called www.darkhorizons.com.
Dark Horizons is an anomaly: a
professionally run site that doesn't
have am commercial aspirations.
An Aussie named (iarih Franklin
runs the sile in his spare time, and
the only vestige of capitalism on his
site is contained neatly in one little
ad banner.
At Dark I lori/ons, you c an not
only read reviews for almost every
11 oily wood release, you can see the
trailers and previews for upcoming
movies as well. Definitely the best
pari of the site is the trailer section
I've seen the leaser for the
upcoming "Batman Beyond" Hick
countless limes by now.
I here is a rumor section for the
hard core movie junkies among us,
but if you like rumors, the site lor
vou may be www.aint-it-cool
news.com. Run by supergeek
Marry Knowles, the sile is a lit lie

harder 011 the eyes. If you can make
your way through the barely navi
gable sile (the search engine is hor
rible), you will find some nuggets of
news.
A more professional site can be
found at www.reel.com. Reel has a
better selection than Dark Horizons
— where Dark I lori/ons has info on
most Hollywood releases, Reel has
bios for most releases across the
board.
Any American site is going to be
Hollywood-biased, but Reel has a
mighty fine collection of foreign
releases, and categories from cult to
lesbian.
If Reel had trailers and reviews,
il would rule the Cyberworld. For
each movie. Reel can tell you about
the cast, the awards the movie won,
and give you a guide to the "anato
my" of the movie. Ibis guide can
tell vou t hat the movie you want to

see would be a 9 in "character devel
opment" but merely a 1 in "ollbeat
energy." I lardly a review, but help
fill.
Another shortcoming of Reel's is
the whole on-line commerce sec
tion. I'm on a student budget here,
so I'm not about to take advantage
of the "Buy at Reel!" section any
time soon.
www.Ultimatemovies.com has a
cool idea going when il comes to
getting movie times without a news
paper around.
They ask you for your zip code,
how far you'd like to drive, and
what newspaper you'd like your
information and reviews from.
After some circuits hum, you get
movie times for all the cinemas near
you as well as reviews for the movies
involved.
An interesting idea comes from
www.inoviecritic.com. At movie

critic, after a lengthy registration,
you can see how the computer
thinks you would like a movie, as
well as how others on (lie site have
rated the movie.
As a procrastination technique,
you can't heat it —you rate movies,
then surf around looking to pick a
light with the computer.
I definitely got a little ticked
when the computer told me I
wouldn't like " True Romance."
For each of the movies rated by
visitors to moviecritic, there is a link
to the Internet Movie Database.
www.imdb.com is the webspeak fin
this incredibly thorough site.
Included in the database are links to
reviews, related movies, and infor
mation about the cast.
You can even find times for the
movies in your zipcode. Pretty thor
ough, those IMDB guys.
An issue across movie sites tends

to be the differences in search
capacity. Dark Horizons, unfortu
nately, doesn't have a search
engine.
Most movie sites do, though —
it's much easier to find the movie
you're looking for if you can just
type it in.
But if you find a site with all the
relevant information (times,
reviews, trailers) and a search
engine, bookmark it and email me.
They are hard to find, and I'm
always looking to optimize my pro
crastination techniques—l am a
Stanford student, after all.
