## Blake's: Drinking with the enemy 
### GIL LOPEZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For my inaugural I >;ii review,
I decided to cross die Bay and
head into enemy ten itory.
Lite whole Stanford-Califor
nia rivalry aside, many students
at Stanford either have friends at
UC-Berkeley or find a reason to
head over there at least once a
while on the farm.
I his Friday's women's basket
ball game is the perlect opportu
nity to soak in some of the Fast
Bay atmosphere.
Of course, when wandering
the streets looking for a good
time afterward, you may want to
remove any Stanford parapher
nalia.
In fact, definitely remove your
Stanford gear. You don't go into
shark-infested waters smeared in
blood.
No matter how heated the
whole Stan(ord-C]al rivalry might
get, there's one area in which no
one can deny I (.-Berkeley's
superiority: city life.
Let's face it, Palo Alto does for
city life what Caltech does for the
male-female ratio, only much,
much worse.
There are several places to
choose from in Berkeley, but I'll
focus 011 Blake's on Telegraph.
The music is a little too loud,

bin ii has a great atmosphere
that's reminiscent of the old Col
fee I louse.
Aside from the standard tables
and diaiis, ii has two bars (one
upstairs, one down) and has two
big couches — think "Friends,"
bui without Jennifer Aniston.
Blake's < laim to fame is its
menu of eight mixed drinks it
claims w ere developed bv its bar
tenders, though I still suspect
that the recipe for "Irish Coffee"
may have been stolen.
But the drinks are generally a
student favorite, and the Ann-
Solie (Stoli Vanilla, Bailey's and
Frangelico mixed with coffee
and lopped with whipped
( ream) is a good creative mix.
Half of the specialty drink
menu is made up of coffee
blends, but the other half is pel -
fed if you like fruity drinks.
I he Siain Sigh (tequila, gin,
in in and vodka mixed with
pineapple and cranberry juice) is
the girl-drink equivalent of a
Long Island Iced Tea.
flie menu also has a good mix
of beer — 12 on tap, another
seven bottled — and the tequila
and whiskey menus are small,
but varied.
flic house's shooters menu is
also interesting, featuring Sex
with a Goat (Peach Schnapps,

Bacardi 151, Creme de Cassis
and pineapple and cranberry
juice) and To the Moon (Amaret
to, Bailey's and 151).
The truly brave can attempt
the Irish Car Bomb, which is a
shot of Bailey's, Jameson's
Scotch Whisky and Korbel
Brandy dropped into a pint of
(iuitmess.
I have done some foolish
things when it comes to alcohol,
many of which I had to have
recounted to me the next day,
but I'd sooner swallow a brick
then attempt to pound a pint of
Guinness.
Remember their old motto?
"We don't make Guinness, we
build it."
And of course, five types of
wine are available if beer and
mixed drinks aren't your prefer
ence.
So head on out and support
the Cardinal, or just get off cam
pus for the sake of doing so.
And remember, always find a
nearby place to crash or appoint
a designated driver.
