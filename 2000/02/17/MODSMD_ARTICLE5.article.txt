# Stanford Fund receiving negative feedback
## 
### KEITH ITO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Some student groups who use The Stan
ford Fund Student Group Partnership as a
fundraising tool have expressed frustration
with the new payment plan introduced earli
er this year.
Organizers of the partnership program, in
which students write personal letters thank
ing donors, intended to allow groups more
flexibility under the revamped system.
However, many participants say they feel

that the increased burden on group leaders
has outweighed the benefits of the new free
doms.
"It was a logistical nightmare," said senior
Brian Chu, who coordinated Testimony A
Capella's participation in the program in fall
quarter. "We had 14 people in our group and
needed to write 400 letters. We also had to
handle all of the letters and proofread them."
In the past, the partnership program al
lowed student groups to earn money by work
ing shifts at The Stanford Fund offices in
Encina Hall.

Under the new plan, student organizations
write letters on their own time. I hey are offi
cially paid $25 per hour. I lowever, this figure
is calculated in terms of the number of letters
that a group writes rather than the amount of
time that they work.
Initially, the program's pay scale was based
011 students writing four letters per hour.
However, in response to student feedback,
The Stanford Fund recently reduced the
number of letters students are expected to
complete per hour to two.
"We listened to student feed
back and the consensus was that
four letters per hour was not
manageable," said Suzanne Men
doza, director of student devel
opment for The Stanford Fund.
"So we changed that to two let
ters per hour, with the same stan
dards. In fact, they could make
the letters more personal than be
fore since they didn't have to do
as many."
The change was a relief to
those who had become discour
aged by the expectations at the
outset of the program.
"We decided that if we were
going to continue to [write let
ters], we'd have to ask for only
about half as many hours," said
Chu. "But they essentially did
that for us by reducing the num
ber of letters."
Many student groups were
taken by surprise by last year's
change in the payment scheme.
In previous years, student groups
were paid at a rate of $20 per
hour, regardless of the quality or
quantity of letters they wrote dur
ing their shifts. The new plan was
introduced this fall without any
prior warning.
According to Mendoza, stu
dent groups had complained

about the requirements that the
letters be written within the of
fice.
"They didn't like being in a
structured environment where
they fell that they had to come in
at an inconvenient time and
place," she said.
According to Alternative
Spring Break Co-Coordinator
Miranda Ip. a junior, this year's
plan placed additional burdens
on the student groups by placing
responsibility for the letters' qual
ity in their hands.
"Our trip leaders and coordi
nators are proofreading tons of
letters, [and] then trying to get
people to come in and rewrite
them," Ip said. She estimated
that ASB members put in about
two hours of work for every hour
tor which they were paid.
"It certainly puts more re
sponsibility on the contact person
to be more informed about
guidelines and parameters,"
Mendoza said.
However, she also emphasized
that the new plan gives organiza
tions more freedom as to when
and how the letters are written.
Now that The Stanford Fund
has corrected for some of its ini
tial problems, it is focusing on ex
panding its program. "Now that
we have gone through a year of
transition, adjusting the program
so that all of the work is done out
of the office, we'll be able to offer
more hours and fund more stu
dent groups," Mendoza said.
