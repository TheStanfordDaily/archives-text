# Students launch OPAL satellites
## 
### VIVEK SRINIVASAN 
lutst Saturday, the ()i biting Pi
cosalellite Activated Launcher,
designed and built predominant
ly by Stanford students, took one
major step towards completing its
mission.
OPAL, a three-year project at
the Spate Systems Development
laboratory, released the last two
of its six original picosatellites —
small satellites alioul the size of a
Klondike bar — into space. I bis
prompted SSDL Director and
Consulting Prof. Koliert Twiggs
to say the mission was "99 percent
completed."
Despite its current success,
OPAL has suffered several set
backs since its Jan. '_!(> launch.
Both the()PALlx.*acon and the
SSDL ground antenna have had
communication disruptions, and
the OPAL batteries almost over
heated Friday due to direct sun
light exp< >sure.
In addition, the ongoing
search by NASA's jet Propulsion
laboratory for the Mars Polar
lender has tied up the Dish,
which was needed to contact the
picosatellites. OPAL delayed the
launch of the first two picosatel
lites to accommodate this search.
OPAL has already set a num
ber of precedents.
Besides In-ing the first student
built satellite at Stanford, ()PAL is
the first satellite ever to launch pi
cosatellites. which are smaller

than conventional space probes.
"Picosatellites will allow future
space communication to be less
expensive and more reliable,"
Twiggs said. Santa Clara Univer
sity students built three of the pi
cosatellites aboard OPAL; the
Aerospace Corporation built two
of them; and amateur radio en
thusiasts in the Washington, D.C.
area built one picosatellite.
Additionally, OPAL's launch
from Vandenberg, Calif , on a re
tired Air Force rocket demon
strated the viability of Interconti
nental Ballistic Missiles as space
launch vehicles.
Twiggs' estimated the costs of
designing and constructing
OPAL at $75,000.
"Because we are in a university
and on a low budget, we took
some risks in the design," said
OPAL Project Manager and elec
trical engineering graduate stu
dent James Cutler. "It has worked
out pretty well."
Even with the mission's phe
nomenal success, Twiggs said,
"from an educator's perspective,
the mission was a success before
the satellite was launched." Aero
nautics and Astronautics Depart
ment Chair George Springer
called SSDL "a second-to-none
experience where students learn
alxmt management and commu
nication."
OPAL will serve as a magne
tometer and accelerometer test
bed over the next few months, ac
cording to Cutler.
