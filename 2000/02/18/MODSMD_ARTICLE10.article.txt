A group of (i() fiftli- and sixth
grade students will be oil campus
today to get a taste of'the "Stan
lord experience," minus dorm
food, fraternity parties and long
lines at the post office.
From 10:30 a.m. to 1:45 p.m.,
students from the Alian/a (lharter
School will he around "to meet
Stanford students, tour the cam
pus |and| meet with fatuity," ac
cording to a press release from the
Haas Center for Public Service.
I he Alian/a students are affili
ated with "Kids Around the Uni
versity," a project based out of
I ('.-Santa Cruz that "oilers cur
riculum ilial introduces- kids to
what college and university life is
all about," said Katie Stonebloom,
I ( -Santa Cruz project coordina
tor for the program. The visitors
from Alian/a ('.barter School, near
Watkinsville, are predominately
Chit ano students from low-in
come households, said
Stonebloom.
Alian/a students will start the
day with a tour of cam pus, includ
ing a visit to (lasa Zapata and Rin
conada dormitories. "The tour
should provide a realistic, down
-to-earth view of what it is like to
be a Stanford student," said Creg
Vaughn, academic coordinator

for the Upward Mound program
and a chief organizer of the event.
"We those Casa Zapata for the
tout because it has a rich history,
as well as beautiful architecture
and murals. VVe hope the Alianza
students will get a sense of why
students chose to live there."
Following the tour, students
will break up into six groups to
participate in talks with Stanford
faculty in one of six subject areas:
medicine, computer science, law,
engineering, library science or po
litical science.
"I was an elementary school
teacher before gratl school, and
have taught high school before, so
teaching these kids will be a great
way to keep alive my connection to
K-12 education," said Asst. Politi
cal Science Prof. Robert Reich. "I
will be facilitating a discussion
about philosophical dilem
mas .... I want to get them to
have conversations anil get them
to become philosophers timing
the talk. We will philosophize to
gether about old and difficult
questions, like 'What is the nature
of truth?'"
After the faculty discussions,
Alianza students will eat lunch
with the Stanford Society of Chi
cano/Latino Fngincers antl Sci
entists.
Ilasi< ally, SSC J,I\S is hoping to
give these kids the opportunity to
set- what college life is like," said
sophomore Roberto Garcia, the

meeting, they can see what the so

tivities are available at a school like
