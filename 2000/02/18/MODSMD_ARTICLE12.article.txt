### DENNIS TYLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Gloria Anzaldua, a Ghicana les
bian feminist writer, read selec
tions fi om her fiction last night at
the "Gonocimiento in Dialogue"
forum and also participated in a
panel discussion about her work
with Asst. English Prof. Paula
Moya and Spanish and Por
tuguese Prof. Yvonne Yarbro-Be
jarano.
In her talk, Anzaldua discussed
the importance of self-acceptance
and expression.
"Instead of blanketing one's
thoughts, we should openly share
them with one another," said An
zaldua.
The purpose of the discussion,
according to Anzaldua, was to cre
ate a space where everyone could
communicate openly about his or
her feelings, especially within the
gay, lesbian and bisexual coitimu
nity. '
Anzaldua described "con
ociniiento" as a "reflective dia
logue where everyone jumps in
and shares their ideas and stories
with the entire group. It is a queer
way of looking at things
and . . . connecting with one's
spiritual dimension and soul."
Stating that these sorts of issues
are too often forgotten in acade
mia, Anzaldua encouraged college
students to "go with your heart, go
with your passion."
Obtaining this 112 reedom of con
sciousness would allow people to
receive what she called "La
Llorona," the call.
To clarify, she provided the
audience of 70 to HO people with
a story about a pregnant woman
whose body wast ut into pieces
alter the birth of her baby. This
story, according to Anzaldua
compares to "how many of us in
the academy feel: displaced and
fragmented" because of the in

ability to open up.
At the request of Yarbro-Be
jarano, Anzaldua read one of her
short stories about a rebellious
young girl, who is being forced
into marriage so that she can be
come a part of the legacy of her
land.
Afterwards, An/aldua, Moya
and Yarbro-Bejarano participated
in a dialogue in which they exain

ined further the meaning of
"queer conocimiento."
"The idea is not to become nor
malized but to always stand in a
transversed relationship with the
norm," commented Bejarano. An
zaldua agreed that "we need to
queer all of our thoughts" in order
to prevent assimilation into the

majority group.
"Queer conoc iemiento began
as an interactive dialogue within
the community, but has become
increasingly more transnational
and global because of computer
interaction," said Anzaldua.
All of these ideas are discussed
in her works as well, Borderlands
/ La Frontera: The New Mestiza,
her most well-known work.
"She is a very eclectic writer of
poetry and fiction, whose work
spans the whole array ol literary
genre," said Fnglish Prof. Ramon
Saldivar.
In her work, Anzaldua mostly
explores the "mestiza concious

ness," which is a "substantive con
ception of the human good,"
Moya said.
"The mestiza consciousness
conies in waves that go in and
come out, said An/alclua. In
struggling to put ourselves to
gether, one has to decide their
path and concentrate on it."
"Conoc imiento in Dialogue"
was organized by Stanford's Les

nity Center, the Feminist Studies
Program, F.I Centro Chicano,
Chicano/a Studies and the gay,
lesbian and bisexual Latino

because it is the lirst major col

said LGBCC Director Ben
Davidson.
