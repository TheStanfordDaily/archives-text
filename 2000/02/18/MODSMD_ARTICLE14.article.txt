MAI.GOBEK, Russia (Al>) —
(Ihechens trying to leave their war
ravaged republic are being tor
tured in Russian detention camps
and subjected to severe beatings,
rapes and other brutality, refugees
and human rights groups say.
I he allegations come on the
heels of other complaints of
human lights abuses in the Rus
sian offensive in Chechnya, includ
ing reports of summary executions
of civilians in (iro/.ny, the Chechen
capital.
Russian officials deny the allega
tions, but Chec hens who have lied
into neighboring republics tell sim
ilar, grisly accounts of their deten
tion in camps that Russia says it set
up to filter out rebels who are try
ing to escape disguised as civilians.
A 21-year-old Chechen, lying
in pain in a bed in Malgobek in
neighboring North Ossetia, said
that his ordeal began Jan. 22
when police dragged him off a
bus of refugees and took him to a
camp in the Chechen village of
(Ihernokc >/ovo.
fhe man, who asked that he be
identified only by his first name,
Ruslan, said he was forced to run a
gantlet of masked policemen
swinging truncheons, had his

clothes torn off and was forced to
stand naked in a cold storage room.
"1 asked what they were detain
ing me for, but they didn't
answer," he said. I fe was released
only after his mother paid a bribe
to the camp directors, he said.
At least three such camps are
operating, according to Peter
Bouckaert, a researcher for the
Human Rights Watch group in the
region.
"Russia appears to have
declared any (Chechen male to l)e a
suspected rebel, subject to arbi
trary arrest and brutal treatment,"
he said.
fhe allegations were echoed by
the World Organization Against
Torture, which issued a statement
in Geneva yesterday saying, "We
cannot ignore that the filtration
camps are indeed concentration
camps where Russian soldiers are
committing the worst atrocities, in
all impunity, against most of their
prisoners."
In Washington, State Depart
ment spokesman James P. Rubin
said yesterday that "Russia has a
clear obligation to investigate the
numerous credible reports of civil
ian killings and alleged misconduct
by its soldiers promptly."
