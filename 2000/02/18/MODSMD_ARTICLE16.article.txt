LOS ANGELES (AP) — Mayor
Richard Riordan recommended yester
day that Los Angeles set aside its share of
the national tobacco settlement — up to
$300 million — to cover lawsuits
brought by victims of the city's police
corruption scandal.
"This is the best use of these dollars,"
Riordan said at a news conference.
"Though we have no way of knowing
the dollar amount, we must expect and
prepare for tens of millions of dollars of
liability," added Riordan.
The mayor said the move would safe
guard against possible cuts in city ser
vices or new taxes.
City officials have estimated that law
suits associated with the scandal in the
police department's Rampart Division

will cost at least $125 million.
Lawsuits already have been filed on
behalf of some men wronglv imprisoned
police.
Investigators say rogue cops planted
evidence, made up testimony, staged
crime scenes and in some cases, shot
unarmed suspects.
Under the national $206 billion
tobacco settlement, Los Angeles is to get
up to $300 million over 25 years.
Also, yesterday, a judge agreed to
throw out the convictions ol nine more
people whose cases prosecutors say were
tainted by police misconduct.
The dismissals bring to 40 the num
ber of convictions overturned.
"We have do/ens of more cases
under review," District Attorney (iil

(iarcetti said.
As many as 20 officers have been
relieved of duty, lired, suspended or
have quit since the investigation started.
Police have refused to say how many
officers are still under suspicion.
(iarcetti said he is doubling the num
ber of prosecutors assigned to the inves
tigation, with a stall of 19 expected to be
on board within the next two weeks.
Former undercover officer Rafael
fere/, c onvicted of stealing cocaine from
an evidence locker, has detailed the cor
ruption in his former unit and suggested
it went beyond Rampart.
No charges have been filed against
any officers implicated in the corruption,
but police have recommended prosecut
ing t luce officers.
