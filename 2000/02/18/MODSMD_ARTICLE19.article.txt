## The 						Stanford Daily Stanford Fund changes questionable

Til E NEW PAY MEN I plan for the
Stanford Fund Student Group
Partnership, designed after stu
dent dissatisfaction with the previ
ous system, may need some more time at
the drawing board.
According to the old system, student
groups were allotted a time slot during
which they had to work shifts writing
"thank-you" letters to donors at the Stan
lord Fund offices in Encina Hall. In
exchange, they were paid a flat rate of $20
per hour. However, after complaints about
the inflexible nature of the system — stu
dents had to all come in at the same preset
time and write letters — changes were insti
tuted in the system.

Instead, students are now allowed to
write letters on their own time, and are paid
for the number of letters written rather than
the overall amount of time spent working.
Although the rate of pay is calculated at $25
per hour, this is based on the expectation
that students will write two letters each hour.
Though intended to allow more flexibili
ty and 112 und a greater number of students,
the new system is severely flawed and needs
some reworking.
New rules place a heavier burden on stu
dent group leaders who are required to
proofread letters and ensure their quality.
Letters are rejected for very specific proof
reading and stylistic guidelines that the
Stanford Fund provides, but which writers

can easily miss. In many cases, group mem
bers are asked to rewrite their letters. What
all this amounts to is that student groups
end up spending considerably more time in
the process than for which they are reward
ed.
Furthermore, the new guidelines were
introduced at the beginning of the school
year without any advance warning or
attempts to consult student groups whether
this would best suit their needs.
According to Suzanne Mendoza, director
of student development for the Stanford
Fund, the new changes were introduced
after complaints about the old system.
"They didn't like being in a structured envi
ronment where they felt that they had to

come in at an inconvenient time and place,"
said Mendoza.
The simple fact that this change appeared
to be in response to student input would
seem to require that there was an opportu
nity for feedback or critique before it was
put into place.
Ultimately, the goals of allowing some
flexibility to students and the capacity to
fund more groups are laudable. However,
in trying to allow for this, a bigger problem
shouldn't be created.
The Stanford Fund should work to cor
rect many of these avoidable problems by
working closely with student groups to
design a system that is fair to both students
and the University.
