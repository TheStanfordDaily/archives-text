# THE 						FLIP SIDE
## Making changes 
### 
Character is overrated. I'm not
talking about the type of "char
acter" that politicians throw
around in their smear cam
paigns. I'm talking about character in tht—
sense that something is unique and spe
cial. But who needs unique and special?
Stanford has understood that it is time for
a change. With much foresight, we're
bringing back the days of drab and usual.
I ake for instance the (Capital Improve
ment Project.
\i the end of every year, we rave about
which Stanford dorm is going under CIP

on-white walls, poop-brownish-greenish
doors and llourcscent lighting has made

environments throughout campus.
Speaking of color and variety, it really
is foi the best that the freshmen never got
to see the mural of "The Wild Things" in
Whitman or the multitude of colorful, stu
dent-produced murals that used to cover
the inside of l erra. Painting over them
was the aesthetically pleasing tiling CIP
could have done on this campus. We
won't even get into Alpha Sig.
Though I am moved to tears in the
number ol ways that (HP is saving our
campus by making all our houses look the
same, I was still appalled to discover that
there actually used to be an arcade and
pool hall in I'residder. Out ranking in
U.S. News and World Report probably
lumped from like 50 to 49 when such
havens ol reckless abandon were replaced
by a clean and pure sanctuary known as
I he Pulse.
Oh I he Pulse. Let me count the ways
in whit h I love The Pulse. It has made my
Stanford experience whole. Pulse, you

complete me. And now that the once stu
dent-decorated pit next door known as
the Coffee House has turned into Star
bucks, Tresidder can take its place in the
"World as one of the premier mini-malls in
the area, devoid of any character any
where except Vice Provost Montoya's
office.
But I think I know what Stanford's
character problem stems from. It's called
free dress. What we need as college stu
dents is uniforms. Think of it. All of our
houses would look the same, our student
union would look exactly like every other
block in Sunnyvale and our students
would all look like they went to Catholic
school!!! It's perfect. No such thing as
variety. It would be the most efficient edu
cational environment possible.
Even better. Let's go for uniform
thought. Ix't's just make everybody pre
med. Everyone would constantly be think
ing the same tiling. And most of the peo
ple here were pre-med anyway when they
first came. And Lord knows that premeds
never have time to think about anything
except being premed. We'd all be Ux>
scared to even talk to each other. The
entire campus would be
like ... well ... Lantana. That would do
it. Everyone would live in the same type of
house, wear the same clothes, and more
importantly, THINK the same exact
thing.
Yes, I'm Ix'ing extreme. Part of me
misses going into different houses and see
ing what they would be like that year. The
rest of me is just really bitter about our
stale, yellow CoHo that doesn't serve gua
camole and salsa with their chips any
more. I'm a senior and all seniors (after
being hired by their respective consulting
firms) start to remember all the things
they really loved about Stanford — things
that really made Stanford unique and spe
cial. But we all know that it's students that
bring this school character. Let's make
sure it stays that way. Bring your house to
life and turn it into something with a rep
utation, even if it's a bad reputation. I rue
the day when I will go to Synergy and not
expect nudity.
lake back the CoHo. Paint a wall
somewhere with something. Stand up to
the Big Angry Cuy at the Post Office. Well,
actually, be careful with that last one.
Especially since that's one part of campus
that will always have character, and that's
one character that will never hesitate to
kick vour ass.
