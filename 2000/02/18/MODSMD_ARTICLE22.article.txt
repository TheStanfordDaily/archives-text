Post office investigation
Editor's Note: This letter urn sent to Mr.
Robert Reed, Acting Director of Operations for
the San Franciso Region of the U.S. Postal
Sendee.
I was very disappointed to read in yes
terday's San Francisco Chronicle that you
do not intend to request an immediate
outside investigation into the Stanford
substation of the U.S. Postal Service. I
hope you can assure me that the informa
tion 1 read was incorrect.
At Tuesday night's meeting, I had to
rephrase my question repeatedly before
you finally agreed to call for the outside
investigation. There are nearly 60 wit
nesses (and a few tape recorders) who
heard you agree to my request for an
immediate investigation and audit. I find
it unconscionable that you should even
consider breaking your promise so quick

ly, and I hope you can assure rue that you
will not.
1 would direct your attention to Title
18, Sections 1700-1703 of the United
States Code, which deals with obstruction
and desertion of mail (available at
http:www.usps.gov/websites/depart/inspe
ct/usclB/desert.html). These are criminal
offenses. You heard abundant testimony
Tuesday night that mail and packages are
missing and/or delayed. I can attest to it
personally. One can conservatively esti
mate that there are hundreds (and more
likely thousands) of missing or delayed
letters and packages.
This necessitates a criminal investiga
tion, particularly when one considers
Postmaster Sato's own admission that he
has not been receiving the complaints
about lost or missing items. Why hasn't he
received these complaints?
1 can provide you affidavits if you need
them, but you don't. You heard the evi

dence, and you made a commitment to
request the outside investigation. Please
honor that commitment.
