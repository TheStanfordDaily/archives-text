# From under the fronds — a word from The Tree
## 
### TREE GUEST COLUMNIST 
The following is a transcript of a tape
recording recovered amid the rubble of 21st
centnry Reading, Massachusetts. It appears
to be evidence of a conversation between
Jabba the Hutt, Punch /; om (.Ihl's,
Shaquille O'Neal, Andy Rooney, Shock (> (of
Digital Underground fame) and the Stan
ford Tree.
The first 39 seconds are indecipherable
because oj the low recording speed, but the
tape quickly accelerates faster than a Uni
versity-wide crackdown on fun, and the fol
lowing is audible:
Andy Rooney (piercing, nasal tone):
Why? I mean, do I need all that pack
aging?
Ponch (aside, to Tree): I'm serious,
bro. One more comment like that outta
him and I'm gonna introduce him to
Lucille (motions to his holster.) We
could make it look like an accident.
Shaquille O'Neal: Yeah, dog. Any
more boshiznat from Gomer Pyle over
there might make me bust out my
Shaq-Fu.
Shock G: Whatever, fatso — and you
might release a rap album that isn't
roundly mocked and berated, but I'm
not worried about that either.
Shaq: T hat's not cool, man — that's . . .
That's just not cool!!!

Stanford Tree: Hey, don't lake it so
hard, Shaq — I think he's being a little
unfair.
Shaq: You do? You mean, you like my
style?
Tree: Who doesn't? 1 think that your
work with Fu-Schnickens has aged par
ticularly well, especially, "What's Up
Doc, Can We Rock?"
Shaq: Really! That's great, because —
Tree: No, not really, Shaq, you're terri
ble.
Shaq:(whimpers)
Ponch: Hey, pass the Glenfiddich, will
ya?
Shock G: 1 can rap better than you.
Ponch can rap better than you. Come
to think of it, Larry-freaking-Bird can
rap better than you.
Jabba the Hutt (freestyling): Morisay
'kna ra felon, risini, paolu-champa
knnzyka, BIATCH!!!
(translated: All 1 see on the M-I-C is T-
P-G for L-I-F-E, my fat sloth brotha!!!!)
AR: I don't get this rap business, I mean
I just don't get it. Mary had a little
lamb, her fleece was white as
/v %s!@#s snow — am I missing some
thing here? And 1 mean, what's with
artists' names these days? Prince? The
artist formerly known as? The artist?
What is that all about? And those
instructions on shampoo bottles? I
mean —

(A gunshot l ings out, and Rooney is not
heard from for the test of the conversa
tion. Here the tape is clearly erased, as
there are 17 telltale seconds of silence.
When the tape resumes, a gun is heard
smoking.)
JTH: Bonzoni ni cariii lockrisso.
Pwa/.kay reelio? Kna!!!
(Actually, I thought 100 Miles and Run
ning was ,i great album, hut 1 digress.
Pass the cheetos.)
Ponch: Right on, dog.
Shock G: We're not getting onto this
again, are we? I mean, this conversa
tion is about as much fun as an a capel
la marathon.
Shaq: (drying eyes) Hey, I thought Big
Sing was ok.
JTH: Hpehalllo rackaznay! (You
would, you Zima-swilling punk. Your
musical taste matches your free-throw
shooting.)
Shock G: Forget these guys. Ponc h, say
you're Treein'
Tree: Treein'?
Shock G: Nobody else is seein'
Shock G: And the Dollie that you're
with is in front of you . . .
Tree: Uh, wait, that's not how it
works . . .
Shock G: The booty's two feet from ya'
head . . .
Tree: 1 swear, that's not how it works —
I'm just friends with the Dollies, 1

swear.
Ponch (returning from the bathroom):
Whatevs, Tree-boy! Gitsa call ta' git dat
booty action?
Tree: Ok, wh, fine . . . Let's just change
the subject. Future plans, anyone?
JTH: Fek u iou sidsini, tpaolu kroop!!!
(That bastard Spielberg cut me out of
Fpisode II!! 1 swear revenge, I'll freeze
him in', uh, that stuff we put Han Solo
in?)
Ponch: You mean, carbonite?
JTH ( under his breath): Alewjar realzo.
(Star Wars freak loser)
Ponch (blushes):
Shock G: I'm still just a freak. But I'm
hoping to land a job as a dean here at
Stanford. Think you could put in a
good word for me?
Tree: Uh
Shock G: I'm serious, dog, I've got
some great ideas about merging with
UCSFI
Tree: Well
Shock G: An' youse the Tree...
Tree: You got that right, Shock G.
Ponch: Anyway, I'm making a come
back.
Shaq: ChiPs is back???
Ponch: No, not exactly. But me and
John are getting back together and
we're going to be on the field at the
next Big Game! It's gonna rock!!
Tree: Are you serious?

Ponch: Oh, hells yeah! We're adminis
trating blood and urine tests to every
one in the stands, and I heard we're
getting flamethrowers for crowd con
trol!
JTH: Thiggu kna-fallapoo. (Uh, sweet)
Shaq: Fool, I'ma win the NBA cham
pionship this year, then the next 6
years in a row, and I'ma be MVP four
times, and I'm comin' out with Shaz
am II and 11l-
Tree: Enough. You're a joke.
Shaq: Oh yeah? Well your toungue is
offensive! And the sunglasses are
stupid! And- and- and- it was better
when it was a pine tree!!!
JTH: Knacka. Ponch, get his arms
and legs. Tree, get me some coffee
and a pack of cigarettes. Shock G,
team up with the Sugar Hill Gang to
remix the Humpty Dance. I'll handle
all the rest.
The sound of duct tape peeling off a
roll is heard, followed by a brief scuffle.
The tape ends.

Evan Meagher is a junior coterming in Eco
nomics and Sociology-Organizational Stud
ies. Sometimes he dances around in a goofy
palm Tree costume, but wouldn't you? He
does not like Jello, considers himself a mod
ern Odysseus, thinks heaven is going 2-for-5
every night against Bob Gibson and can be
reached for dirty talk at 7-AXIL.

Shock G: We're not getting onto this
again, are we? I mean, this conversa
tion is about as much fun as an a capel
la marathon.
Shaq: (drying eyes) Hey, I thought Big
Sing was ok.
JTH: Hpehalllo rackaznay! (You

Shock G: Forget these guys. Ponc h, say

Shock G: The booty's two feet from ya'

Ponch: You mean, carbonite?
JTH ( under his breath): Alewjar realzo.
(Star Wars freak loser)
Ponch (blushes):
Shock G: I'm still just a freak. But I'm
hoping to land a job as a dean here at
Stanford. Think you could put in a
good word for me?
Tree: Uh
Shock G: I'm serious, dog, I've got
some great ideas about merging with
UCSFI
Tree: Well
Shock G: An' youse the Tree...
Tree: You got that right, Shock G.
Ponch: Anyway, I'm making a come

Shaq: ChiPs is back???
Ponch: No, not exactly. But me and

next Big Game! It's gonna rock!!
Tree: Are you serious?

Ponch: Oh, hells yeah! We're adminis
trating blood and urine tests to every

trol!
JTH: Thiggu kna-fallapoo. (Uh, sweet)
Shaq: Fool, I'ma win the NBA cham
pionship this year, then the next 6
years in a row, and I'ma be MVP four
times, and I'm comin' out with Shaz
am II and 11l-
Tree: Enough. You're a joke.
Shaq: Oh yeah? Well your toungue is

JTH: Knacka. Ponch, get his arms
and legs. Tree, get me some coffee
and a pack of cigarettes. Shock G,
team up with the Sugar Hill Gang to
remix the Humpty Dance. I'll handle
all the rest.
The sound of duct tape peeling off a
roll is heard, followed by a brief scuffle.
The tape ends.

The following is a transcript of a tape
recording recovered amid the rubble of 21st
centnry Reading, Massachusetts. It appears
to be evidence of a conversation between
Jabba the Hutt, Punch /; om (.Ihl's,
Shaquille O'Neal, Andy Rooney, Shock (> (of
Digital Underground fame) and the Stan
ford Tree.
The first 39 seconds are indecipherable
because oj the low recording speed, but the
tape quickly accelerates faster than a Uni
versity-wide crackdown on fun, and the fol
lowing is audible:
Andy Rooney (piercing, nasal tone):
Why? I mean, do I need all that pack
aging?
Ponch (aside, to Tree): I'm serious,
bro. One more comment like that outta
him and I'm gonna introduce him to
Lucille (motions to his holster.) We
could make it look like an accident.
Shaquille O'Neal: Yeah, dog. Any
more boshiznat from Gomer Pyle over
there might make me bust out my
Shaq-Fu.
Shock G: Whatever, fatso — and you
might release a rap album that isn't
roundly mocked and berated, but I'm
not worried about that either.
Shaq: T hat's not cool, man — that's . . .
That's just not cool!!!

Stanford Tree: Hey, don't lake it so
hard, Shaq — I think he's being a little
unfair.
Shaq: You do? You mean, you like my
style?
Tree: Who doesn't? 1 think that your
work with Fu-Schnickens has aged par
ticularly well, especially, "What's Up
Doc, Can We Rock?"
Shaq: Really! That's great, because —
Tree: No, not really, Shaq, you're terri
ble.
Shaq:(whimpers)
Ponch: Hey, pass the Glenfiddich, will
ya?
Shock G: 1 can rap better than you.
Ponch can rap better than you. Come
to think of it, Larry-freaking-Bird can
rap better than you.
Jabba the Hutt (freestyling): Morisay
'kna ra felon, risini, paolu-champa
knnzyka, BIATCH!!!
(translated: All 1 see on the M-I-C is T-
P-G for L-I-F-E, my fat sloth brotha!!!!)
AR: I don't get this rap business, I mean
I just don't get it. Mary had a little
lamb, her fleece was white as
/v %s!@#s snow — am I missing some
thing here? And 1 mean, what's with
artists' names these days? Prince? The
artist formerly known as? The artist?
What is that all about? And those
instructions on shampoo bottles? I
mean —

(A gunshot l ings out, and Rooney is not
heard from for the test of the conversa
tion. Here the tape is clearly erased, as
there are 17 telltale seconds of silence.
When the tape resumes, a gun is heard
smoking.)
JTH: Bonzoni ni cariii lockrisso.
Pwa/.kay reelio? Kna!!!
(Actually, I thought 100 Miles and Run
ning was ,i great album, hut 1 digress.
