# Environment an issue in campaign
## Major candidates tackle Kyoto Protocol automobile emissions 
### GREG PAGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Fight years ago, former President George Bush
mocked Sen. Al Gore, the environmentalist De
mocratic vice presidential candidate, calling him
"Ozone Man."
The "Ozone Man" is campaigning again, but he
is now joined by all of the other major candidates
in identifying environmental policy as a key theme
of this year's presidential election.
Environmental policy has only recently become
a serious issue for American voters. In fact, it has
only become an issue at all in the past 40 years.
Gore has made several environmental issues
central to his campaign.
To fight urban sprawl, Gore has proposed
spending $2 billion to set aside more urban and
suburban park land. To 112 und this purchase, Gore
would enact a mining industry fee. When he out
lined this plan last year, Gore said, "All working
families deserve easy access to parks and open
space, whether they live in the inner city or on the
growing edge of suburbia."
Gore has stated repeatedly that lie supports the
Kyoto Protocol. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol sets
greenhouse gas reduction targets for the United
States and other developing countries. The U.S.
has not signed this treaty, as it has been argued
that the proposed carbon dioxide emission cut
could threaten the economy.
(lore's Web site claims, "The Clinton-Gore ad
ministration has enacted strong new clean air

standards for soot and smog that will prevent up
to 15,000 premature deaths a year; new measures
to protect drinking water; aggressive toxic waste
clean-ups; and new steps to give communities
more information about chemicals released into
their air and water."
In a speech on Monday at the Sierra Club
Headquarters in San Francisco, Sen. Bill Bradley
stressed the importance of cleaning up the envi
ronment during the current economic boom.
"We are at a moment of great prosperity," he
said, "and I say that now is the time to use that
prosperity to secure our future and there is no
wiser way to do that than to preserve and protect
our environment."
Bradley, a supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, also
believes in tougher automobile emissions stan
dards as a way of improving air quality. In Octo
ber, he told the Sustainable Energy Coalition, "We
need new strategies to get cat owners to get old
clunkers off the road since they contribute dispro
portionately to pollution."
(i()P presidential candidate and Sen. John Mc-
Cain does not support the Kyoto Protocol. How
ever, according to Project Vote Smart, McCain
supports the following principles: "strengthening
the Clean Water Act, encouraging development of
alternative fuels to reduce pollution and strength
ening emission controls on all gasoline or diesel
powered engines, including cars and trucks."
Freshman Kimberly Torrence, head of the
John McCain campaign at Stanford, said, "Mc-
Cain is calling for a plan to revitalize America's 379
national parks. His plan includes 'identifying and
prioritizing park needs; setting goals and mea-

surement standards with spec ific
timelines; and developing a bud
get to implement the plan.
"He also wants the people ol
California to be able to decide lor
themselves on the issue ol oil
shore drilling for oil and not leave
it in the hands of the national gov
ernment," said I orrence.
McCain's OOP rival, Texas
Cov. Oeorge bush, also opposes
the Kyoto treaty.
In a November campaign
speech, Bush said the best wav to
ac liieve clean air and water was to
"work with local jurisdictions
using market-based solutions and

not try to sue our way to c lean air
and water."
In his campaign, Bush has
stressed the need for inexpen
sive, environmentally sound oil in
the form of natural gas. At a Man
chester, New Hampshire OOP
Debate in January, he said, "()ur
country belter become less de
pendent on foreign crude...and
that's why I'm lor the exploration
of natural gas."
At a December debate in
Phoenix, he said, "I have got
great hope for the natural gas
business, which is immune to
OPFC and hemispheric in na
ture. I he natural gas business is
finally recovering from the Ibol
ish ways ol the Jimmy C latter era
when the\ tried to nationalize in
essence the natural gas business
with price fixing and demand."
