# Quality of faculty life debated
## 
### KARI LUNDGREN 
The future role of the Planning
and Policy Board and a discussion
on "Faculty Quality of Lite, Re
cruitment and Retention" were
the two major themes of yester
day's Faculty Senate meeting.
The planning and policy board
(PPB) completed its second three
year term in the fall of 1999. It was
created to examine long-term
trends and address issues that re
mained uncovered by other over
burdened, standing committees.
According to History Prof. David
Kennedy, the previous policy
boards have had a somewhat "the
atrical history" with limited suc
cess. I le cited the play "Waiting for
Godot," saying, "Nothing hap
pened twice."
In spite of this apparent lack of
success, Kennedy and Psychology
Prof Ewart Thomas were both
eager to revise the charter and
turn the PPB into a "dormant"
standing committee. At the begin-

ning of each
academic year
an "executive
comm i 11 e e,"
comprised of
the two most re
cent senate
chairs would
act as scouts, "to
consider issues
that might war-

rant PPB attention." The commit
tee would then be activated upon
the recommendations of these two
chairs.
Opposition to this proposal ar
gued that the PPB was an experi
mental committee that had accom
plished nothing during its six years
of existence. Thomas argued that
the point of the committee is to re
tain a futuristic perspective and
promote discussion, not necessari
ly to have specific, tangible results.
Their proposal passed with two
small additions concerning faculty
interaction and junior faculty rep
resentation.

Fat Jones, vice provost ot facul
ty development, presented and led
discussion on a report entitled
"Faculty Quality of Life, Recruit
ment and Retention." Jones pre
sented statistics concerning re
cruitment and retention. She con
cluded that the major concerns
were housing, spouse / partner ca
reer options and job beneflts.
Several faculty expressed a tie
sire to see Stanford retention / re
cruiting statistics in relationship to
other universities. Others hoped
ihat more attention would lx- paid
to recognize potential faculty loss
before it actually happened. Presi
dent Gerhard Casper was especial
ly adamant that the key to success
ful recruiting / retention was to
"convince people that they are
wanted" and to create a "vibrant,"
"intellectual" environment.
The senate also recognized
Art Prof. Matthew Kahn for his
"fifty years of distinguished
teaching and service to Stanford
University."
