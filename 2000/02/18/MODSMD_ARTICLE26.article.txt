# Free copies continue in libraries
## 
### DAVID ABRIL 
Stanford Libraries are trying to simplify the pho
tocopy charge system, though many students enjoy
the current system of free copying.
Library officials are currently working to over
come technological problems caused by the imple
mentation of a new card payment system.
According to Deputy University Librarian Karen
Nagy, difficulties stein largely from a new system
that will allow faculty and students to pay for copies
with their Stanford ID card.
"The use of a Stanford ID card as a way of pay

ment and the ways you can put money on it is a
means of paying for copying in a discounted way.
However, tlit- technological implementation of
doing that has been difficult," Nagy said.
Last November, the University libraries ended
their contract with Ikon and began one with Xerox.
The transition has required updating the interfaces
on the libraries' 52 public copy machines to accept
the 11) cards, a process that Nagy says is taking
longer than expected.
The libraries are still working with the Stanford
II) (lard Office and the Bursar's
C )l!i< e to devise a system that will
enable a student to put money on
a t aid account via DART ma
chine. I liese cards would be ac
cepted by any of the library ma
c 11iilcs. Nagy said that live new
DAK I mac hines will be installed
in locations around campus.
Since students learned about
I lie free copying, Nagy says that
use ol die machines has increased
dramatically. Students who use
tlu machines frequently are espe
cially pleased with the situation.
"I've been going though jour
nals in the library a lot for my the
sis research," said senior I .tike*

Miner. "A lot of the stuff I
wouldn't get to unless I copied it,
so the new policy has been really
beneficial."
Nagy reported that the li
braries and Xerox will share the
cost ol public copy service until
spring, when the new copy sys
tem is implemented. Photocopies
will cost $.08 per page from a
card account and S. 10 per copy
otherwise.
"We're suffering from unan
ticipated technical problems
right now," said Nagy. "Fortu
nately, Xerox has been very pro
fessional and is helping us absorb
the costs from this. We know that
the word is out about free copy
ing, and we hope that students
take responsibility and be reason
able when copying material."
