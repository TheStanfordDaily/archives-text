On Thursday at the Skilling Auditori
um, Nkosinathi Biko presented his docu
mentary, "Steve Bantu Biko: Beacon of
Hope," the 20-year documentary com
memoration of his father, the highly in
fluential South African activist.
The event, attended by approximately
80 people, was co-sponsored by the ASSU
and the African Student Union and pre
sented by the ( '.enter for African Studies.
In the words of Nkosinathi Biko, "the
story of South Africa is embodied in the
story of Stephen Bantu Biko."
Stephen Biko founded the South
African Black Consciousness movement,
which maintained that "black liberation"
began with "black psychological self-re
liance." However, in the words of Larry
Diamond, this year's co-director of. the
Center for African Studies, "Biko's mes
sage went beyond Black Consciousness,
and extended to hope and dignity, equal
ity and liberation."
Nkosinathi Biko, the eldest son of
Stephen Biko, is an independent film
maker. Like his father, he continues to

work in the Black Consciousness move
ment and the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, a South African institution
granting amnesty to former foot-soldiers
of the apartheid regime, in exchange for
the truthful revisiting of the past.
According to Diamond, "Biko was for
bidden to function fully as a public per
sonality," but still went on to become an
activist comparable today to Nelson Man
dela.
In August 1977 Stephen Biko was ar
rested and held in custody by the South
African police. They beat him to the point
of brain damage and for weeks, held him
handcuffed in a jail cell. On Sept. 12,
H)77, he died after an unexplained 750-
mile ride from Pretoria to Port Elizabeth.
His funeral was attended by thousands,
including many Western diplomats. The
tragedy of his death prompted the U.S.
government to impose the oil and arms
embargo against ine South African
apartheid regime.
lhe police had alleged that Biko's
death was caused by his violent resistance
to interrogation. This account had been
officially accepted, but not publicly ac
knowledged. It has only been in the last
few years that the police officers admitted
the brutality with which Biko was killed to
the Truth and Reconciliation Commis
sion.
