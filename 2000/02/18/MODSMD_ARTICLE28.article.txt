## Waves slip by Card Stanford volleyball shows signs of life against Pepperdine, Loyola is next 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
In the wake of upsetting
previously ranked No.l
UCLA, the No. 3 Pepperdine
Waves may have thought that
last night's match over un
ranked Stanford would be a
sure win. But in a match just
shy of three hours, the Cardi
nal made it clear that it wasn't
going down without a fight.
Through an intense four
game side-out battle (15-10,
14-lb, 15-11, 15-12) that fi
nally went the way of the
Waves, Stanford (4-7, 4-5
Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration) fought its strongest
match against a top-live team
this season.
While No. 1 Long Beach
State, N0.2 USC, No. 4 UCLA
and No. 5 BYU have all
cruised by Stanford in three
games this season, it was not
so easy for Pepperdine (7-1,
5-1).
"I think we could've won
the match," said freshman
outside hitter Kyle Strache.
"It's exciting to be in every
game at this level, but at the
same time we want to win."
The key to Stanford's step
up in play last night was its
consistently strong side-out
game. In previous matches
the squad has struggled to
keep teams from scoring
points in runs, but last night
the Cardinal allowed the
Waves only one run of more
than two points.
"We were much tougher
with our side-out game, we
sustained our play and were
much more consistent," said
head coach Ruben Nieves.
"We are playing with five
times the mental toughness
we played with a couple
weeks ago. The guys have re
ally taken it upon themselves
to be a tough team."
In game one, both teams
were stingy in giving up
points, and it wasn't until
Stanford was down 8-9 that
Pepperdine broke away
slightly, only to be held oil at
match point before ending
out the game 15-10.
