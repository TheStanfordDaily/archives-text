## Waves slip by Card Stanford volleyball shows signs of life against Pepperdine, Loyola is next 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
In the wake of upsetting
previously ranked No.l
UCLA, the No. 3 Pepperdine
Waves may have thought that
last night's match over un
ranked Stanford would be a
sure win. But in a match just
shy of three hours, the Cardi
nal made it clear that it wasn't
going down without a fight.
Through an intense four
game side-out battle (15-10,
14-lb, 15-11, 15-12) that fi
nally went the way of the
Waves, Stanford (4-7, 4-5
Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration) fought its strongest
match against a top-live team
this season.
While No. 1 Long Beach
State, N0.2 USC, No. 4 UCLA
and No. 5 BYU have all
cruised by Stanford in three
games this season, it was not
so easy for Pepperdine (7-1,
5-1).
"I think we could've won
the match," said freshman
outside hitter Kyle Strache.
"It's exciting to be in every
game at this level, but at the
same time we want to win."
The key to Stanford's step
up in play last night was its
consistently strong side-out
game. In previous matches
the squad has struggled to
keep teams from scoring
points in runs, but last night
the Cardinal allowed the
Waves only one run of more
than two points.
"We were much tougher
with our side-out game, we
sustained our play and were
much more consistent," said
head coach Ruben Nieves.
"We are playing with five
times the mental toughness
we played with a couple
weeks ago. The guys have re
ally taken it upon themselves
to be a tough team."
In game one, both teams
were stingy in giving up
points, and it wasn't until
Stanford was down 8-9 that
Pepperdine broke away
slightly, only to be held oil at
match point before ending
out the game 15-10.
The two teams swapped the
lead throughout game two, but
Stanford lost its 11-10 lead and
faced three match points before a
serving surge by junior outside hit
ter Curtis Graham helped Stan
ford catch up. The Cardinal was
then able to capture a 16-14 victo
ry-
"Coming back was big for us in
game two," Nieves said. "We exe
cuted well down the stretch and
took advantage of every opportu
nity."
Game three was another emo
tional roller coaster as the two
teams shared the spotlight. Pep
perdine up three, a Stanford
comeback, two more points for
Pepperdine, then three more lor
the Cardinal — such was the play
typical of game three and most of
the match.
A Pepperdine comeback from
6-8 to 1 1-8 helped boost its play to
an eventual 15-11 final that rolled
the way of the Waves.
As the fans began to tire and fil
ter out of Maples Pavilion, it
seemed that the Cardinal may too
have been throwing in the towel as
Pepperdine jumped to a quick 4-1
lead. But as redshirt freshman
middle blocker Jon Palacios served
Stanford to an 8-8 tie, it was clear
that Stanford wasn't done yet. And
though the Cardinal fell to 10-14,
it again denied two match points
before losing 15-12.
"We played tough the whole
time," said sophomore outside hit

ter Marcus Skacel. "But we would
let up around 10 points and they'd
get a lead, then we'd start playing
again. Tomorrow night [against
Loyola Marymount] at 10 points,
we've got to bear down and get the
lead."
"It was our best team effort but
in crunch time we would lose that
lire somewhere," Strache said.
"We couldn't get over that hump
and that's the time we need to
work the hardest and come to
gether the most."
Despite the losing effort, the
Cardinal boasted four players in
double digits for kills. As Top pel

nior setter Josh Lukens, who fin
ished with a season-high 98 assists,
did well moving the ball around.
loppel lead with 36 kills, while
Skacel and Strache both finished
with 20 and junior middle blocker
Brett Youngberg, limited by a sore
back, posted 17 kills on the night.
Defensively, Stanford shined
with its blocking and outblocked
its opponent for the third time this
season with a season-high 19. Pep
perdine recorded 18 blocks.
Youngberg and Strache led in
blocking with seven apiece.
Well-deserved and much-need
ed rest from such a hard fought
match will be limited lot the Cardi
nal which will get to test its ability
and stamina once more in a
matchup with No. 9 LMU tonight
at Maples.
"Every match we need to prove
ourselves all over again," Nieves
said. "We'll find out [tonight | what
kind of team we are going to be
and if we can battle just as hard.
We have the next 21 hours to be at
our best."

with 20 and junior middle blocker
Brett Youngberg, limited by a sore
back, posted 17 kills on the night.
Defensively, Stanford shined
with its blocking and outblocked
its opponent for the third time this
season with a season-high 19. Pep
perdine recorded 18 blocks.
Youngberg and Strache led in
blocking with seven apiece.
Well-deserved and much-need
ed rest from such a hard fought
match will be limited lot the Cardi
nal which will get to test its ability
and stamina once more in a
matchup with No. 9 LMU tonight
at Maples.
"Every match we need to prove
ourselves all over again," Nieves
said. "We'll find out [tonight | what
kind of team we are going to be
and if we can battle just as hard.
We have the next 21 hours to be at
our best."
