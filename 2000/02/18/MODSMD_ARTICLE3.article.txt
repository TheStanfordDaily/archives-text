# Dish signals not from Mars Lander
## Long-shot theory now definitively disproved 
### EILEEN CHAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Nearly two months of collabo
rative investigation between Stan
ford and NASA came to a close
Wednesday when NASA scientists
confirmed that the signals re
ceived In the Stanford Dish were
not from the lost spacecraft Mars
Polar Lander, hut from earth it
self
The Dish had picked up faint
signals that were hypothesized to
be from the Mars Polar Lander, a
$165 million spacecraft that disap
peared from radio contact just a
few minutes before it was sched
uled to touch down on Dec . 3. The
signal was thought to be received
on two instances, Dec. 18 and Jan.
4.
"We found what looked like a
candidate signal that was much
weaker than it should have been if
it came from the lander, but pos
sessed some of the c haracteristic s
we thought that we would see,"

said Ivan l.inscott, a senior re
scan h engineer at Stanford's
Space I elecoinmunications and
Radio Science Laboratories
(STAR), in an earlier Daily report.
I low ever, from the very begin
ning scientists were hesitant to be
lieve they were from the Mars
spacecraft.

"It's a really long shot, and I
wouldn't want to get anyone too
excited about it," NASA's Polar
lender Project Manager Richard
(look told reporters shortly after
tlu- first signals were detected.
Since the first detection, re
searchers at Stanford's STAR labs
along with NASA's Jet Propulsion

Laboratory in Pasadena tried un
successfully to establish contact
with the lost spacecraft. NASA also
contacted scientists at three large
telescopes in England, the Nether
lands and Italy. However, none of
these sites heard any signals.
Despite conflicting investiga
tive results, the most convincing
piece of evidence that indicated
the signal's earthly source was the
regularity iu its radio frequencies,
according to Linscott. An addi
tional analysis was performed on
the characteristics of the signal,
measuring its stability and purity.
"It turned out that the signal
was quite clear," Linscott said. "It
was substantially in contrast with
the less pure quality that a signal
from Mars would have."
l he frequencies should have
been highly irregular if they
were coming from Mars, Lin
scott told The San Francisco
Chronicle. Electric particles
which flow from the sun create
turbulence and a "solar wind"
that would distort the waves and
create a varied frequency.

Scientists declared signals recieved by the Stanford Dish to be from else
where on earth, not from the missing Mars Polar Lander.
If the scientists and engineers
were able to locate and establish
communication with the space
craft, they would have been able to
assess the damage to the craft and
find reasons lor malfunction.
"[ldentifying a signal from the
lander] would simply mean it has
been located; whether the mission
is saved depends on future
events," said CI. Leonard Tyler,
former director of STAR Lab and
the leader of STAR's Mars Global
Surveyor project, in a previous
Daily article.
"This would give us a clue as to
the state of the lander and would
be indicative that the landing se
quence worked properly."
Regardless of any successful
contact with the Polar Lander,
NASA had "little hope" that the
spacecraft could ever continue on
its mission: gathering Martian
soil, in search for signs of frozen
water and monitoring weather
conditions in the south polar re
gions.
Although the confirmation that
the signals were not from Mars was
not a surprise, Linscott said he
wasn't pleased with the outcome.
"We felt the signal initially was
a really long shot, but there was
hope," he said. "I thought we
might have had a role to play in
helping discover what happened
to the Lander, lint that turned out
not to be the case. It was a disap
pointment."
The loss of the Polar Lander,
along with two other recent
NASA failures, has prompted
NASA to create review boards to
investigate the probable causes of
failure.
The future of this Mars project
will be determined In the reports
submitted by the review board. It is
unclear if another craft like the
Mars Polar Lander will be
launched next year, or if the Mars
mission will be delayed.
