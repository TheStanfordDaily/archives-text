# Dish signals not from Mars Lander
## Long-shot theory now definitively disproved 
### EILEEN CHAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Nearly two months of collabo
rative investigation between Stan
ford and NASA came to a close
Wednesday when NASA scientists
confirmed that the signals re
ceived In the Stanford Dish were
not from the lost spacecraft Mars
Polar Lander, hut from earth it
self
The Dish had picked up faint
signals that were hypothesized to
be from the Mars Polar Lander, a
$165 million spacecraft that disap
peared from radio contact just a
few minutes before it was sched
uled to touch down on Dec . 3. The
signal was thought to be received
on two instances, Dec. 18 and Jan.
4.
"We found what looked like a
candidate signal that was much
weaker than it should have been if
it came from the lander, but pos
sessed some of the c haracteristic s
we thought that we would see,"

said Ivan l.inscott, a senior re
scan h engineer at Stanford's
Space I elecoinmunications and
Radio Science Laboratories
(STAR), in an earlier Daily report.
I low ever, from the very begin
ning scientists were hesitant to be
lieve they were from the Mars
spacecraft.

"It's a really long shot, and I
wouldn't want to get anyone too
excited about it," NASA's Polar
lender Project Manager Richard
(look told reporters shortly after
tlu- first signals were detected.
Since the first detection, re
searchers at Stanford's STAR labs
along with NASA's Jet Propulsion

Laboratory in Pasadena tried un
successfully to establish contact
with the lost spacecraft. NASA also
contacted scientists at three large
telescopes in England, the Nether
lands and Italy. However, none of
these sites heard any signals.
Despite conflicting investiga
tive results, the most convincing
piece of evidence that indicated
the signal's earthly source was the
regularity iu its radio frequencies,
according to Linscott. An addi
tional analysis was performed on
the characteristics of the signal,
measuring its stability and purity.
"It turned out that the signal
was quite clear," Linscott said. "It
was substantially in contrast with
the less pure quality that a signal
from Mars would have."
l he frequencies should have
been highly irregular if they
were coming from Mars, Lin
scott told The San Francisco
Chronicle. Electric particles
which flow from the sun create
turbulence and a "solar wind"
that would distort the waves and
create a varied frequency.

Scientists declared signals recieved by the Stanford Dish to be from else
where on earth, not from the missing Mars Polar Lander.
