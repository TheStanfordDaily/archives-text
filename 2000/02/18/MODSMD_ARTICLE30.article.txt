# Men's hoops ready for physical Bears
## With Borchardt day-to-day, Madsen and Collinses take center stage against Cal 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
Besides fourill-ranked Arizona, there
might be onl) one thing that could derail
No. 2 Stanford's quest to repeat as Pacific
10 Conference (lhanipions â€” injury.
Stanford (21-1, 10-1 l'ac-10) has been

rolling through the conference season,
beating opponents by an average of more
than 19 points per game. Since the Cardi
nal's three-point loss to the Wildcats Jan. 8,
Stanford has won nine straight games con
vincingly.
But an injury to freshman center Curtis
Borchardt has put a crimp in the Cardinal's
vaunted depth and given Stanford reason
to pause going into what should be anoth
er physically bruising matchup with Cali
fornia (14-9, 5-6) tomorrow afternoon.
Originally, the stress reaction to Bor
chardt's right foot was supposed to be min

imal. Because of the pounding his 6-foot,
11-inch frame puts on a pair of already
fragile feet, he had been wearing a pair of
orthotic supports. After not wearing those
for a few days, Borchardt began to feel
some pain in his foot and eventually was
unable to play.
After he sat out last Thursday's game
against Oregon, Borchardt said he would
be back to play against California, but now
the timeline has been pushed back with no
firm return date in sight.
The absence of Borchardt did not hurt
Stanford this past weekend as the team de

feated Oregon and Oregon State by a com
bined 41 points. Hut the Cardinal bad
come to rely on Borchardt as a security
blanket, knowing that if either senior Mark
Madsen, junior Jarron or freshman Jason
Collins got into foul trouble, his energy and
shot-blocking prowess meant Stanford re
mained strong inside.
"I don't think it's major if the other
three kids stay healthy," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery. "It was sure nice
to have him as a fourth because he was
going in .iikI making some real
positive plays, but where you'd
miss ii is with the foul situation."
I hat could he an espec ially
acute problem tomorrow.
I hough (i;iI lias been an up-and
down team this season, its inside
strength and depth has never
been questioned. While most
teams acknowledge Stanford's
low-post advantage and try lor
si k < ess el sew here, the Hears were
not all aid to take it right at Stan
lord in the Cardinal's SI-70 victo
r\ at Berkeley on Jan. 22.
"I can't imagine it being any
more pli\si(.il than it was last
game," Montgomery said. But
\(>u look at tlieii team and, gosh,
tlieii third and linn tli post guys,

Solomon [Hughes] and [Shahar]
(ioi don, are capable of coming in
and being pretty physical. So,
yeah, I would expect that they
would come after us pretty good."
I .ast game, the bruising nature
of play led to a slow, plodding,
Ihul-plagued contest. The teams
combined to commit 53 louls and
both had problems keeping their
big men on the floor.
(arron Collins sat out most of
the first half with two fouls; Jason
Collins fouled out fairly early in
the second half, and Borchardt
ended up playing only two min
utes aftei being called for three
quick ones.
Cal freshman Nick Vander
Laan, who finished with 15 points
and I 1 rebounds, played much of
the game with four fouls while
sophomore Solomon I lughes was
on the floor for only seven min
utes because he picked up four of

his own.
Though Borchardt's foul trou
ble made him a non-factor in the
teams' first matchup, his absence
means that if the referees call the
game as tightly as before, Stan
ford might have to rely on fresh
man Joe Kirchofer to fill some
minutes.
"Curtis had three fouls about
as quick as yon can bat an eye,"
Montgomery said. But, "we have
to be careful with the matchups
with Joe. We can't put Joe in a sit
uation where he can't succeed. 1
don't know that a healthy dose of
Sean Lampley is the answer for
him."
That prescription probably
isn't very healthy for anyone.
In January, Lampley was kept
out of the starting lineup for
unidentified disciplinary reasons.
But Lampley, who leads Cal in
scoring and rebounding, finally

down by Madsen for the majority
of the game. In the second half, as
the Bears struggled to stay with
Stanford, he was 7 for I 1 with 14
points.
"Like yon do against any pre
mier player, v<>n minimize," said

Montgomery, adding that Mad
sen will definitely match up with
Lampley again. "You don't elimi
nate; you minimize, try to keep
him fiom having a huge night

would be what we would try to do
again."
