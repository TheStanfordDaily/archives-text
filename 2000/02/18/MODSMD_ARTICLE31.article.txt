"Being a senior gives yon a sense of urgency," says
senior guard Milena Mores. "(ioitig into my last year,
I really wanted to make it special and take advantage
of all ot the work that my coaches have done for me
and that 1 have done for myself."
Mores hopes to finish her career at Stanford in
style and see all of the hard work and dedication cul
minate in a "very special ending."
|list past the season's midpoint, Mores is posting
impressive numbers across the board. To date, Flo
res has started in all 21 games and is averaging 37.3
minutes per game. At this rate, she will break the
school record of 36.5 minutes set by Virginia Sourlis
in 1984-85.
But Mores is more interested in the team's success
than am personal accolades.
"I hope to come out and to be a good leader for
the team. Mores says. "1 want to help the team win
in any way possible."
"The team always comes lirst," Mores emphasizes.

With goals that include a Pac-10 tide
and advancing as far as possible in
the tournament, however, a
little of Flores' personal touch will
certainly be welcomed by team
mates.
A master of the pass, Flores is on

track to be the first player to lead the Pa
cific 10 Conference in assists for three

straight seasons.
During last week's game against Oregon, career
assist 593 moved Flores past Stanford's Jamila Wide
man to fifth on the Pac-10 assist list and third on the
Stanford chart. The only two Stanford players above
her are Sonja Henning (1987-91) with 757 and Jen
nifer A/zi (1986-1990) with 751.
Flores contributes in many other areas. Averaging
10.8 points per game, she also holds the conference's
top mark at the charity stripe at 88.9 percent. She
adds to Stanford's strong three-point shooting, rank
ing seventh in the Pac-10 at 38.1 percent.

Flores is really starting to look
to the future now, aware that her
time left at Stanford is waning.
1 hough the team's goals may
be high, Flores wants to leave on
an upswing.
According to Flores, however,
the team is not foreign to con
quering tough tasks. The squad's
win against Oregon earlier this
season ranks only a close second
behind the team's last Final Four
appearance, when Flores was a
freshman. In both instances, Flo
res remarked, "the team showed
heart."
A dedicated team player with

an enormous passion for the
game, Flores lias always shown
heart.
"I always tried to be my best,"
explains Flores when describing
her childhood. Growing up. All
Star Laker point guard Magic
Johnson was her idol.
Legendary women's coach
Tara VanDerveer has also been a
great motivator for Mores.
"Playing for VanDerveer lias
been a great experience," she
said. "She has high expectations,
which can be a challenge at times.
She sees the greatness in her ath
letes and helps to bring it out."
If VanDerveer can extract any
more greatness from her star
court general, the future looks
bright for both Flores and the
Stanford women.
