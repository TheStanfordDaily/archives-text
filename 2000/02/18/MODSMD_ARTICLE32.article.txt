# Women's hoops host Bears
## Cardinal women look to stay in Pac-10 race against conference doormats at Haas Pavilion 
### MAUREEN MULLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I he ('.ardinal women's basketball team (15-6, 8-3
Pacific 10 Conference) makes its first trip up to the
new 1 laas Pavilion to take on Pac-10 archrival Cali
fornia (7-14, 2-9) tonight. 1 he game is another criti
cal matchup in Stanford's pursuit of the conference
title.
1 lie Cardinal is coining off'a split last weekend in
Oregon which left them in a tie for second place in
the Pac-10 with the Beavers. Arizona and Oregon
(both 9-3) sit atop the conference, one game ahead of
the ('.ardinal.
Cal is currently ninth in the conference, coming

off two losses last week in Oregon. The Bears have
lost 12 of their last 14 games after starting strong with
a 5-2 record.
Stanford prevailed in the earlier meeting of the
two teams at Maples Pavilion, 83-57. The Cardinal
accumulated an impressive 20-2 lead in the opening
minutes of the game. In the second half Cal would
get no closer than 21 points.
Senior Milena Flores led the Cardinal with 12
points, eight assists and eight rebounds. Sophomore
Lindsey Yamasaki chipped in 12 points as well, and
sophomore Bethany Donaphin added 11.
However, the Cardinal women cannot take this
game lightly. This season, a majority of their losses
have come against unranked opponents and have
come on the road. The Cardinal is 6-5 on the road
this season, including a 3-3 mark in Pac-10 games.
The Cardinal has not lost four Pac-10 road games
since the 1986-87 season.
Cal has been plagued by injuries all season. It
is questionable whether point guard Courtney
Johnson, who leads the Bears in scoring (12.1
points per game) will take the floor against Stan
lord tonight. Her status is uncertain due to re
curring symptoms of a concussion.
1 lowever, the Cardinal will see the return of
Cal sophomore center Ami Forney. Forney, who
averages H. 2 points and 5.8 rebounds for the
Bears, will probably see some minutes after
being sidelined for nine games with a stress frac -
ture.
Critical in Stanford's effort will be continued
success from behind the three-point arc. The
Cardinal led the nation in three-point percent
age for the third straight week at -13 percent.
Sophomore Lauren St. Clair leads the Pac-10
and is sixth in the nation in three-point percent
age. She has shot an impressive 65.4 percent in
her last five games, and teammate Jamie Carey is

not tin behind. I'he
freshman is currently
second in the confer
ence and 12th in the
country.
Another key to
Stanford's offensive
game is Flores, who
currently leads the
Pac-1() in assists.
"Cal has been a real
tough opponent," said
the senior guard. "Es
pecially playing them
at their place is going
to be difficult, but if we
stick to our game plan
things should come
out well for us."

Rebounding will be another important factor
in the game. The Cardinal has struggled recent
ly in the battle of the boards, and will have to
eliminate Cal's offensive rebounds and second
chance shots. Currently the Bears lead the Pac
-10 in offensive rebounds.
