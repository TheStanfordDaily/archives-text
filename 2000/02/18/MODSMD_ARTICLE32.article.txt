I he ('.ardinal women's basketball team (15-6, 8-3
Pacific 10 Conference) makes its first trip up to the
new 1 laas Pavilion to take on Pac-10 archrival Cali
fornia (7-14, 2-9) tonight. 1 he game is another criti
cal matchup in Stanford's pursuit of the conference
title.
1 lie Cardinal is coining off'a split last weekend in
Oregon which left them in a tie for second place in
the Pac-10 with the Beavers. Arizona and Oregon
(both 9-3) sit atop the conference, one game ahead of
the ('.ardinal.
Cal is currently ninth in the conference, coming

off two losses last week in Oregon. The Bears have
lost 12 of their last 14 games after starting strong with
a 5-2 record.
Stanford prevailed in the earlier meeting of the
two teams at Maples Pavilion, 83-57. The Cardinal
accumulated an impressive 20-2 lead in the opening
minutes of the game. In the second half Cal would
get no closer than 21 points.
Senior Milena Flores led the Cardinal with 12
points, eight assists and eight rebounds. Sophomore
Lindsey Yamasaki chipped in 12 points as well, and
sophomore Bethany Donaphin added 11.
However, the Cardinal women cannot take this
game lightly. This season, a majority of their losses
have come against unranked opponents and have
come on the road. The Cardinal is 6-5 on the road
this season, including a 3-3 mark in Pac-10 games.
The Cardinal has not lost four Pac-10 road games
since the 1986-87 season.
