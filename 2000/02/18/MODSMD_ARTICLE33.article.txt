Center

cific 10 Conference, Washing
ton 5-2,0-0.
Game Notes: Stanford's quest
for a 12th Pac-10 title begins
today against a Washington
team that lost two All-Ameri
cans to graduation. This week
end also gives the Cardinal a
much-needed chance at play
ing time, as rain forced the
team to cancel most of its two
matches last weekend. A win
would help Stanford in its bid
to host a regional match for the
NCAA tournament.
