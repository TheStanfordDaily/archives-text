# Tennis gears for Pac-10 play
## Huskies, Ducks visit Taube Family Tennis Center as conference play opens 
### SAMEER AHMED CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's tennis team
begins its quest for a third-consecutive Pa
cific 10 Conference title this weekend with
matches against Washington and ()regon at
the Taube Family Tennis Center.
The Cardinal (2-0) plays the Huskies (5-
2) today at 1:30 p.m. and the Ducks (3-2) to
morrow at noon.
Ironically for Stanford, winning a Pac-10
championship has been a lot harder than
winning an NCAA championship. While
the team has won 16 national titles, more
than any school in the nation, it has won
only 1 1 Pac-10 titles. This is perhaps be
cause the Pac -10 has dominated college ten
nis in recent history. During the past 27
years, only one team outside the Pac-10,
Georgia, has won a national championship.
"The Pac-10 is one of the toughest con
ferences in the nation in tennis, head coach
Dick Gould said. "The teams will not only
be competing for a conference champi

onship, but more importantly for a chance
to host a regional match in the NCAA tour
nament."
The path to both championships starts
today when the Cardinal hosts Washington.
Although Washington is ranked in the mid
dle of the Pac-10, the Huskies have had
their best seasons ever during the past two
years. In 1998, they were ranked No. 17 in
the final Intercollegiate Tennis Association
team rankings and last year were ranked
No. 25.
While the Huskies lost two important
players from last year's team, All-Americans
Eric Drew and Robert Kendrick, they con
tinue to have a strong team led by junior
Andy Posavac from Austria and highly tout
ed freshman Matt Hanlin, ranked 69th in
the country, from England.
Tomorrow, Stanford continues its Pac
-10 competition against Oregon. Although
the Ducks are not known f<>r having a very
good tennis team, they have shown this year
that they can compete with the best teams in
the country. Last week they gave No. 8 Pep
perdine all it could handle before losing 4-3
in a very close match.
These matches will be the first real test
for the entire Stanford team this season. So

far this year, Stanford's limited
competition in team play has not
challenged the Cardinal. In their
two dual matches this season, the
Cardinal swept past Hawaii and
Georgia Tech without losing a
match and losing only one set in
11 matches.
While Stanford has performed
extremely well in the lour nation
al tournaments it has attended
this year, the team usually can
only send its top three to four
players. As a result, the Cardinal
lias three of the top six players in
the country, No. 2 Alex Kim, a ju
nior, No. .'i K.J. Hippensteel, a
sophomore, and No. (> Geoff
Abrams, a senior.
However, besides these three
players and freshman David Mar
tin, HippensteePs doubles partner,
no other player on the team has had
that much playing time this year
outside of the two dual matches.

"I don't really know how good
our team is as a whole," Gould
said. "While our top few guys
have performed excellently in in
dividual tournaments, the other
players on our team haven't got
that much playing experience."
The rain last weekend took
away even more playing opportu
nities for many members on the
team. The team's match against
San Diego State was canceled last
Friday. Also, in the Georgia lech
match last Saturday, the teams
only played four out of the nine
scheduled matches (six singles
and three doubles) because they
were forced to play indoors, lie
cause Stanford won the first four
singles matches, junior Ali Ansari
and freshman Scott Lipsky did
not have to play.
1 lowever, to win most dual
matches, the team needs all six
players to perform well. Gould is
hoping there will be no rain this
weekend, so all of his players will
get the experience that they'll need
when competing at the National
Team Indoor Ghampionships
next week in Louisville, Ky.
