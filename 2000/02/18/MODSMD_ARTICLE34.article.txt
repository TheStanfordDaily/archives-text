# Tennis gears for Pac-10 play
## Huskies, Ducks visit Taube Family Tennis Center as conference play opens 
### SAMEER AHMED CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's tennis team
begins its quest for a third-consecutive Pa
cific 10 Conference title this weekend with
matches against Washington and ()regon at
the Taube Family Tennis Center.
The Cardinal (2-0) plays the Huskies (5-
2) today at 1:30 p.m. and the Ducks (3-2) to
morrow at noon.
Ironically for Stanford, winning a Pac-10
championship has been a lot harder than
winning an NCAA championship. While
the team has won 16 national titles, more
than any school in the nation, it has won
only 1 1 Pac-10 titles. This is perhaps be
cause the Pac -10 has dominated college ten
nis in recent history. During the past 27
years, only one team outside the Pac-10,
Georgia, has won a national championship.
"The Pac-10 is one of the toughest con
ferences in the nation in tennis, head coach
Dick Gould said. "The teams will not only
be competing for a conference champi

onship, but more importantly for a chance
to host a regional match in the NCAA tour
nament."
The path to both championships starts
today when the Cardinal hosts Washington.
Although Washington is ranked in the mid
dle of the Pac-10, the Huskies have had
their best seasons ever during the past two
years. In 1998, they were ranked No. 17 in
the final Intercollegiate Tennis Association
team rankings and last year were ranked
No. 25.
While the Huskies lost two important
players from last year's team, All-Americans
Eric Drew and Robert Kendrick, they con
tinue to have a strong team led by junior
Andy Posavac from Austria and highly tout
ed freshman Matt Hanlin, ranked 69th in
the country, from England.
Tomorrow, Stanford continues its Pac
-10 competition against Oregon. Although
the Ducks are not known f<>r having a very
good tennis team, they have shown this year
that they can compete with the best teams in
the country. Last week they gave No. 8 Pep
perdine all it could handle before losing 4-3
in a very close match.
These matches will be the first real test
for the entire Stanford team this season. So
