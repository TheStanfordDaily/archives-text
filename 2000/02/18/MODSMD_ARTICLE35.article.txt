# Fourth time the charm for men's gym?
## Stanford hopes to snap losing streak against Cal post impressive numbers for NCAA consideration 
### SCOTT FINKELSTEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's crunch time for the No. 14 Stanford men's
gymnastics team. With just four meets remaining
before the postseason, time is quickly rutuiiug out
on I lie Cardinal gymnasts.
After a solid week of practice, Stanford (4-4, 4-4
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) will travel to
Berkeley tomorrow to compete against No. 8 Cali
fornia (5-0, 5-0).
In this season's three previous matchups with
Cat, the Golden Bears have been victorious. This
time, the Cardinal is ready to challenge the Bears
and make it a close competition.
"We can beat Cal," said senior co-captain Craig
Nesbitt. "Can we do it this weekend? Possibly. Is that
necessary right now? No."
"(ial is not my concern," said Stanford head coach
Sadao Hamada. "I only care about getting my team
ready for NCAAs."
In order to qualify for the NCAA Champi
onships, the Cardinal does not need to defeat Cali
fornia. As long as Stanford ranks somewhere among
the top 12 teams in the nation by mid-March, the
team will compete at NCAAs in April.
National rankings are determined by the combi
nation of each team's highest home score and its two
highest away scores. This makes it very important
for Stanford to post a high score at Berkeley this
weekend.

"The only thing we should be worried about [this
weekend J is hitting more routines and posting a
higher team score," Nesbitt said.
The Cardinal comes into (his weekend's meet oil
a strong finish at last week's Southwest Cup at Ari
zona State. Stanford put together a solid perlor
mance in its final events to earn wins over ASU and
UC-Santa Barbara.
"We have some momentum coming off the big
finish we pulled off in Arizona," Nesbitt said.
This weekend, senior All-American Jason Kat
sampes returns to action lor the Cardinal. Last
weekend, the team was without Katsampes' services,
as he was competing at the Winter (Tip C ilialfehge in
Las Vegas.
Katsampes was Stanford's only representative at
the Winter Cup Challenge, a stepping stone to the
2000 Summer (Mympics. I le did well in the compe
tition, finishing 18th.
With Katsampes back in the lineup this weekend,
the Cardinal is expected to make a strong showing
against the Bears and boost its team score.
"I think we can score about 225 this weekend il
we hit," Hamada said. "We still haven't clone
enough routines in practice, bui we're getting
there."
"The team score will rise dramatically if people do
in the meets what they've been doing in practice,"
Nesbitt said.
The Cardinal continues to train with great inten
sity and has improved routine consistency in prac
tice. In order to earn high scores from the judges,
the team needs to perform with that consistency
under the pressure ol competition.
Although the season has been slow to develop for
Stanford, the team remains focused and lully ex
pects to compete at NCAA ('championships.
"Kverything is still on track," I laniada said.
