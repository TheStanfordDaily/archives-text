# Swim closes out dual-meet season
## Bears haven't beaten Cardinal since 1991 
### KELLY WIGINTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The California men's swim
team is looking to break its eight
year losing streak against the Car
dinal this weekend. Sixth-ranked
Stanford (5-3, 2-1 Pac-10 Confer
ence) closes Pacific 10 Conference
competition this weekend when it
hosts the No. 4 Bears (6-2,2-1 Pac
-10 Conference) tomorrow at noon
in deGuerre pool.
The Bear's unsuccessful track
record against Stanford is not in
any way indicative of their talent.
Although California has not de
feated Stanford since Feb. 23,
1991 (107-134), it came very close
last year at the Pac-10 Champi
onship meet. The Bears finished
second to the Cardinal by a nar
row eight-point margin.
The Bears' only two losses of
the season have come to extreme
ly respectable opponents — No. 1
Texas and No. 5 USC. With both
Stanford and California at 2-1 in
the Pac-10, Saturday's meet
promises to be entertaining to
fans.
"The Pac-10 is very good this
year," said junior All-American
RobCanales. "Everyone is beating
everyone."
With this season's Pac-10 Cham
pionship meet just around the cor
ner, the Cardinal will not only be
looking to beat the Bears, but to
prepare for its next meet and keep
its conference streak alive. Stanford
holds the longest conference win
ning streak in the history of any
sport, winning the Pac-1 0 (Champi
onship for 18 years in a row.
"Ibis weekend should be a
pretty good primer for us,"
Canales said. "It could go either
way. It just depends on which
team steps up the most."
The Cardinal is coming off an
impressive and exciting meet
against USC two weeks ago, where
it defeated the Trojans in the last

event of the day. USC defeated
California 128-115 on Feb. 4,
while the Cardinal beat USC by
the same score the next clay, win
ning the 400-meter freestyle relay
in the final event.
"With USC beating Cal, and us
beating USC, we feel like we have
a lot of momentum going into this
weekend," Canales said.
The Bears have posted 1)6
NCAA consideration times in vari
ous events so far this season. Lead
ing the way for California this
weekend w ill most likely be senior
Bart Jvizierow ski — the defending
NCAA champion in the 100-meter
freestyle. He has already earned
an automatic NCAA qualifying
time in the event this year, promis
ing him a spot at the NCAA meet.
In the breaststroke events, Se
nior Ratapong Sirisanont aVid
sophomore Andrew Chan will be
competitive against Stanford's
Canales, junior Ail-American .An
thony Robinson and sophomore
Michael O'Neil.
The Big Meet against Califor
nia will be the Cardinal's final
home meet of the season, as well as
its final regular-season dual meet.
