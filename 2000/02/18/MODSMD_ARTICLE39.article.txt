After last week's debacle at Florida
State, things can only get better for the
Stanford baseball team. Looking to re
bound oil its first losing series of the
year, the Cardinal will battle the No.
12 Texas Longhorns at Sunken Dia
mond in a three-game set starting
tonight at (3 p.m.
"They have a very rich baseball tra
dition, which always makes them cliffr
cnlt no matter what team they have. I
think their strength is in their pitching
— the guy who starts Friday night,
Beau Hale, just threw a no-hitter,"
said head coach Mark Marquess.
Last weekend, Florida State, who
knocked the Cardinal out of the Col
lege World Series last year with back
to-back victories, took two games out
of three in Tallahassee, Fla., and took
over Stanford's perch as the No. 1
team in the country. Stanford pitchers
gave up a whopping 32 runs during
the series, rather surprising given that
pitching is supposed to be the big
strength of this year's team.
Hitting hasn't gone well of late ei

ther for the Cardinal — in the words of
Marquess, "We need to pick it up a lot
more offensively. . .we're hitting 50 to
60 points below where we should be
hitting."
The Cardinal will probably be with
out junior Jason Young, the stall ace
and a first-team All-American, when
they face the Longhorns. Young left
the first game of the Florida State se
ries due to shoulder soreness after fat -
ing just four batters.
According Marquess, "It'll be week
to-week . . . But the good news is that
it's not serious. I may pitch him one or
two innings one of those three days de
pending on how he feels."
Young's injury means junior Justin
Wayne will get the ball tonight against
Texas ace Hale, who pitched a no-hit
ter and struck out 13 batters against
Sam Houston State on Feb. 11.
"[Hale] is a young pitcher that's
coming into his own, and he has a
great arm, throws the ball real hard
and should be a high draft pick," said
Marquess.
Sophomore Brian Sager will take
the mound tomorrow afternoon for
Stanford against an unannounced
Texas pitcher. Sager will be coming off
a rough outing against Florida State,
where he gave up five earned runs,
seven hits and three walks in four in

very well out of the bullpen, al
lowing one earned run and three
hits in eight innings pitched.
The man with the hot bat for
the Cardinal is senior first base
man Craig Thompson, who cur
rently leads the team with a .359
average and 14 hits and is tied

for the lead in homeruns with
two.
Senior shortstop Eric
Brunt lett has also been swinging
the bat well, and is second to
Thompson in average with a .324
mark.
The Texas offensive hasn't ac -
counted for much power thus far
— they have hit one home run in
10 games — hut through the hit
and-run, stolen bases and timely
hitting they get the job done.
