### MEENA MALLIPEDDI 
When word reached sophomore and Equestrian Team
menibei Cindy I.in last September that the National Cen
ter for Equine Facilitated I herapy (NCEFT) in Woodside
was in need of vol-

unteers, >he imme
diately passed on
the information to
her teammates.
"It was a neat
link from being on
the Equestrian
Team to volunteer
ing there," said I.in.
"[The NCEFT] was
in need of volun
teers, so I decided
to pass the informa
tion along, and it
just sort of took oil
from there."

The volunteering is strictly on an informal basis
and has no real connection to the equestrian team.
Said I.in, "It's not a formal team thing. I just coor
dinated it for them. I here's about six of us doing it
now."
When asked exac ilv win she decided to volun
teer at NCEFT, fin said simply, "Because it com
bines inv love of horses with my love for kids."
Sophomore Crey Baker, a fellow equestrian
team member and NCIT I volunteer, agreed. "I
do it because I hadn't volunteered for several
years, and to be able to do so while working with
the horses I love is perfect." Baker also liked bow it
made him more aware of all be had. "We take for
granted our mobility, how lucky we are to be able
to walk," he said. "Many of these kids [with cerebral
palsy] don't have that option."
Cerebral oalsv. a condition of muscular weak-

ik'ss and difficulty in coordinating volunlar\ movement, is
caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain before, during or
after birth.
According to Dr. Jessica Agramonte, director ol the Mo
lion and Cait Analysis Lab at Lucille Packard Children's
Hospital, among the main symptoms ol'cerebral pals\ art

muscle weakness and spasticity, an increased sensitivity of
the stretch reflex leading to prolonged muscle contrac
tions. Children with cerebral palsy thus have ;m abnormal
walking pattern or gait and may have postural balance
deficits.

At the NCEFT. a relatively new treatment
called Hippotherap\ is used to treat this and
other muscular disorders. I lippothei ap\ is the
use of a horse's movement as a tool tot real pa
tients with muscular-skeletal and muscle t< ne
problems. As patients sit on the moving horse,
their trunk, pelvis and leg muscles respond au
tomatically to its three-dimensional movement.
Janelle Brokenshire-Cv;, Direc'oi of the
flippotherapy Program ai the NCEFT, said
the principle behind their Ilippothcrapy pro
gram is that "when you sit on a horse, the pelv is

is facilitated to move in the same way as if the person were
walking. If a patient has a neural disorder, they are unable
experience this normal motion. I lippotherapy helps famil
iarize the body with ibis movement." According to
