# Softball drops first game of weekend
## 
### EMILY DRESSEL 
These days, the Stanford soli
hall schedule is beginning to rival
that of a professional sports
team.
I his weekend, the Cardinal is
on the road again and anxious to
defend its near-perfect record of
7-1.
The young team, ranked No.
21 in the country, headed down
to the San Diego area Wednes
day armed with seven new fresh
men ready to take the Camp
bell / (iartier Classic tournament
by storm.
Stanford dropped its fust
game of the season yesterday, 2-
0, in a pitchers' duel that pitted
freshman Dana Sorensen
against No. (> Michigan's Marie
Barda. Bare la was the Big Ten
Pitcher of the Year in 1999.
After seven innings of score
less play, the deadlocked teams
went into an international
tiebreaker. The tiebreaker al
lows the offense to begin each
extra inning with a runner on
second base.
Michigan scored two runs in
the top of the eighth, which Stan
ford could not answer.
The game was the Wolver
ines' first of the season.
Before the Michigan loss,
Stanford maintained a seven
game winning streak alter going
undefeated in five games at last
weekend s fiesta Bowl Classic in
Phoenix. Alter defeating nation
al powerhouses No. H> Massa
chusetts and No. 13 Nebraska,
the pressure is on lor Stanlbrd as
it still must face off against No. 15
Long Beach State.
Stanford will be looking to

sophomore first baseman Sarah
Beeson to showcase her bril
liance at the plate after hatting an
exceptional 3 with eight RBIs
in Arizona.
Beeson was very pleased with
the team's play last weekend,
commending freshman Kira
Cubing and Maureen LeCocq for
their offensive contributions and
Sorensen for her outstanding ef
fort on the mound.
"We played very well overall
and concentrated on making
clean plays during the tourna
ment," Sorensen said. "We have
a rough road ahead with all the
tournaments on the schedule
this month, but it will be good for
our mental focus."
If Stanford can produce any
where near the number of runs it
generated last weekend, the team
will be one of the more competi
tive forces at the ongoing tourna
ment.
What seemed to work well for
the team in Arizona was to open
strong and get some runs on the
scoreboard in the first innings of
play.
Overall, the Cardinal man
aged to tally 14 first-inning runs
over the five-game tournament.
The Cardinal will play live
more games over this weekend.
Stanford will have to work
hard to get the win against Ten
nessee (2-3), which finished with
a 44-27 record last year. Two of
its three current losses can be at
tributed to No. 1 UCIA.
Arkansas (4-4), Cal State-
Northridge (2-2-1) and San
Diego State (2-7) finalize the list
of competitors fin the Cardinal
this weekend.
