# Women's gym hosts California, BYU
## Team begins its stretch run, readies for postseason meets 
### KATIE FITZPATRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
lot the No. 9 Stanford women's
gymnastics team (5-2, 2-2 Pacific
10 Conference), President's Day
weekend will be busy spent host
ing California tonight and No. 12
BYU on Monday.
I lie Cal meet carries special sig
nificance, not only because of the
traditional rivalry, but because it
will be Senior Night — honoring
the accomplished careers of Stan
ford's three seniors. Ail-American
and school-record holder Larissa

Fontaine (vault), Ail-American and
school-record holder Sarah Hard
ing (floor), and Academic Ail-
American Kim Young are three of
Stanford's best gymnasts ever.
Fontaine is having a fantastic
year to cap oil a storied career.
The 10-time U.S. National Team
Member and 1996 U.S. Olympic
Trials participant is flourishing in
her final year, setting new person
al bests. She is currently ranked
seventh in the nation in the all
around, third on vault and 15th on
bars.
"Larissa has held the team to
gether with her leadership, and
she is also doing amazing gymnas
tics," said Amy Murakami, a senior
on the team last year who current
ly holds the school all-around
record that Fontaine is chasing.
Harding is also having a suc
cessful fmale to her career. The se
nior has worked herself back into
the uneven bar lineup and was
one of the leading scorers for the
Cardinal last week in Boise,
Idaho. She is also shining in her
best event, floor. Still, Harding is
intent on improving her perfor
mance.
"1 know I can improve on bars
and on my difficulty on floor. I'm
going to continue training to get
my routines better so that I can
compete them consistently well,"
Harding said.
Young shined during her
sophomore and junior years but
was hampered by injuries during
her freshman and senior cam
paigns. The former U.S. National
Team Member and two-year Car
dinal co-captain is contributing to
the team through her leadership,
experience and positive attitude.
"As a two-year co-captain, Kim
has been an integral part of the
success of the Stanford program,"
Fontaine said.
Coming off the success of last
weekend, the Cardinal is excited

to bring its momentum to Burn
ham Pavilion.
Keeping in mind injuries and
the physical difficulty of compet
ing in two meets within four days,
Stanford will likely have different
lineups for each meet, giving the
team an opportunity to display its
depth.
""fhe goal is to compete as well
as we can but to keep everyone
healthy," Fontaine said. "There
are still many meets left in the
year."
fhe Cardinal will be led on Fri
day by the all-around perfor
mances of junior Jennifer Fxalta
cion, Fontaine, freshman Abby

Clair and sophomore kat\ ller
belt. All four gymnasts haw ilk
ability to vie foi the all-around title
and individual c\etit titlcv
Other perlormaiues to watch
will be the vaulting ol liolnnan
Alissa Cooper and freshman
Kelsey Stillinger and the lut rou
tines of Harding and sophomore
All-American Kristin Jensen.
"It's reallv exiting to come hack
and compete at home. We'ie pi.tu
ning on hitting awesome tontines
and crushing the Bears,' I •salta
tion said.
"I'm stoked for the ( al meet, it's
always fun to beat them .it any
thing," Meldruin said.
