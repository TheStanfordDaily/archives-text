I ~isi night's season opener did
not hi! n out (|iiiu*as the Stanford
women's lac rosse team had envi
sioned. In a nail-biting contest,
the (lardinal fell to UC Davis 9-8
in overtime on two late goals by
the Aggies.
I he man h demonstrated
l)oth the potential and the incon
sistencies ol the Cardinal team,
with flashes ol brilliance marred
by errors and disorganization.
Stanford demonstrated its
passing superiority throughout
the match but let Davis's physical
style of play and crowding ol the
middle take it out of its game time
and time again.
"We didn't play our game,'"
said sophomore Kmily Ro
driguez. "We played down to
I licit level."
Stanford's pre-game jiltcis
were evident in the first ten min

utes ol play as the team went
down 2-0 to an energized and
hungry Davis squad.
Davis look advantage of swifi
cross-field passing to move the
ball down the field and tire out
the Cardinal defense. However,
Stanford gradually settled down
and began to turn the momen
tum around with sophomore Liz
Bi itt opening the scoring lot the
(lardinal in the 21st minute.
Sophomores Caroline Oster
wise and Jenny Silverman fol
lowed up with two more goals in
the last six minutes to put the
(lardinal ahead 3-2 at the half.
The stilldefense of the first
lull gave way to an offensive free
for-all in the second, with both
teams consistently tailing to get
hack on defense.
Stanford struck first with a
beautiful run by Rodriguez to set
up britt's second goal. Davis an
swered with two goals in a span of
two minutes to tie up the game and
regain the momentum.
After trading goals to remain
locked in a tie at 5-5, Stanford
surged ahead with two quick goals.
But just when the Card seemed to
have the game wrapped up, Davis
regained their composure and
scored two goals in the closing min
utes to send the game into overtime.
Overtime, which consists of two
three-minute periods, saw the Car
dinal self-destruct. After going up 8-

7 on a goal by senior I ledy Born, the
team watched helplessly as Davis re
sponded with two goals in the sec
ond period to wrap up the game.
File Aggies, ecstatic at beating
the Cardinal after losing to them all
three times last year, rushed to the
center of the field as the Stanford
fans went silent.
While the loss was a disappoint
ing way to start the season, it also
provides the (Cardinal with many as
pects to work on in preparation for
their upcoming game against Cali
fornia next weekend.
Offensive standout katherine
Barnes, missing for the Davis game,
will be back, and the young Stanford
squad will try to regroup.
