Comments by departing Senior Directoi
of Undergraduate Admissions Jon Reidei
made last week to The Daily have raised tjucs
tions about the stalling and operations of the
office.
"I don't know olanv other admissions of
fice that is expected to work at this level," Rei
dei said last week, citing the office's workload.
"I'ai I ol it is space, and part of it is money ...
are they going to build us a building? I don't
think so."
Reider compared Stanford's ()ffice of Ad
missions on the second llckjc ol Old Union,
where two members of the admissions stall
currently share an office, with that of Har
vard I Diversity, saying I larvard had twice as
many people in their admissions off ice.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid Robert Kinnally said, "[Al
though] I larvard probabl) has an admissions
staff maybe three times the size <>l ours. Many
of their stall members have dual limctions(in
admissions and financial aid]. If you add our
financial aid and admissions stalls together,
we're about even."
According to I larvard Dean of Admission
and Financial Aid Marlyn McCrath-Lewis,
the si/e ol I larvard's staff is the equivalent of
51.5 lull-time employees, including 15 fiill
time admissions officers who split time be
tween reading applications and working on
financial aid.
Stanford, on the other hand, has a staff of
:<l, including 12 admissions olficers whose
sole job is in the admissions department. In
fact, including Stanford's financial aid offi
cers, the total size of the admissions stall rises
to 53, slightly larger then I larvard's.
both schools receive approximately
20,000 freshman and transfer applicants
each year.
I'he stalls ol both I larvard and Stanford
are within the same range as those of the
schools' peer institutions, for example, Co
lumbia University has about FS lull-time ad
missions olficers who read the 15,000 appli

cations that come in each year, according to
Jaye Pace with the C '.olumhia ()fiice of Admis
sions.
By fin the largest department in terms of
admissions staff'per student among the uni
versities contacted was Emory LDiversity. Ac
cording to Kmory Assoc. Dean of Admissions
Leonoict Carroll,the department includes 11'
senior staff with 20 support staff and a sepa
rate financial aid department of 32 people,
meaning that Emory has more workers than
both Harvard and Stanford. Emory receives
1 (),()()() applicants a year.
Kinnally also said he believes that the
processes bv which each university makes
their admissions decisions makes a difference
in staffing demands.
"Each admissions of lite does
things their own way," kinnally
said. "What works at Yale might not
work at Stanford."
In contrast to Stanford, which
uses mainly written comments and
small groups to evaluate applicants,
eveiy applicant to Harvard is dis
cussed in a committee made up of
the If) admissions officers and 15
administrators.
"It's entirely a talking process ...
[and] it's a very long process," Mc-
Clrath-ljewis said.
Most other universities use a sys
tem somewhere Ijetween Stanford's
and Harvard's. At Emory, for ex
ample, all applicants are first dis
cussed in small groups, and the en
tire admissions staff then looks
upon the "maybes."
Most admissions off icers agreed
that they would be more than en
thusiastic about having additional
stall members. As Carroll said,
" The demands of perspective stu
dents and their families grow every
year with the new technology. They
want information faster. The role
of the admissions officer has
changed."
