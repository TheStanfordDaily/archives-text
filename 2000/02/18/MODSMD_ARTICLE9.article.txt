Stanford Medical Center will
lose a major fund-raiser in March,
when Dennis Mulhaupt, associate
vice president lor medical and ex
ternal alfairs at the Medical Cen
ter, leaves for a new position at
Claremont McKenna College.
"Stanford is a wonderful place,
and Ill miss the institution as well
as the people, hut I look forward
to he able to teach undergradu
ates again," said Mulhaupt, a for
mer professor of International
Relations at Cambridge Universi
ty and at the University of South
ern California.
Mulhaupt's responsibilities at
Stanford included funding, alum
ni relations, corporate relations,
and communications for the Med
ical School.
In a recent memo to the stalls
in the Office of Development,
V it t* president for development
John Ford said, "We are sorry to
see Dennis leave after a little more
llian two years at the Medical (Cen
ter. In that time, Dennis and his
colleagues have generated excel
lent gilt growth and have taken
the initial steps to define a major

fund-raising campaign fix medi
cine."
Concerning the issue of the
failed merger between UCSF's
School of Medicine and Stanford
Medical Center, Mulhaupt strictly
denied that it had any effect on his
decision. "[My leaving] had ab
solutely nothing to do with the de
merger. I have nothing but the
greatest respect for this school and
its people," he said.
"Unlike Stanford, Claremont
McKenna is not a research institu
tion. But it's nevertheless a very
good school, and it was too good
an opportunity for me to turn
down," said Mulhaupt.
Despite some anxieties about
working in a completely differ
ent environment, "one of the
biggest anticipations is handling
the full operations and responsi
bilities for an entire institution,
something I never did here,"
said Mulhaupt.
His new position at Claremont
McKenna College, in Southern
California, will be vice president
for Development and Kxternal Af
fairs, in which he will be working
for the president and the Board of
Trustees.
