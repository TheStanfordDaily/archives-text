Stall c hanges are afloat at Stanford's alumni
magazine.
Bob Cohn, Stanford magazine's prior edi
tor, left his post on Jan. 28 after a four-year
stint. He is now the executive editor of The In
dustry Standard, an e-commerce-based maga
zine.
Mark Robinson, Stanford magazine's for

mer managing editor, has replaced Cohn as
acting editor. According to Bill Stone, president
of the Alumni Association, a permanent ap
pointment could be just weeks away. Robinson
is still in the running.
"[We will] try to sort out our plans in the next
lew weeks," said Stone, who will make the final
decision. A committee from the Alumni Associ
ation's Board of Directors will advise Stone on
the decision.
Stone said the search process is not com
pletely set.
"We have to decide what our plans are going
to be for an editorial search," he said. There is
110 list of potential editors, but Stone has de
vised criteria that will be instrumental in these

lection. "For an editor of an alumni magazine,
you want a good eye for the campus, a sense of
who the readers are and a pretty broad set of
managing and editorial skills. Curiosity is an
other important thing," Stone said.
A December 1999 survey by the association
found that "Stanford magazine lis] the single
biggest source of information for Stanford
alumni," Stone said.
While the editor of the magazine may
change, the magazine's format will remain the
same.
"In some ways, a magazine like this always
takes on the personality of those who are [run
ning] it.... but the purpose doesn't change,"
Stone said.
