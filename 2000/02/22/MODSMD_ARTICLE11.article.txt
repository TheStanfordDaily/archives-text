## Bands help Coffee House toot its horn

The Stanford Concert Network aims to give critics
of the newly-remodeled Coflee House one less
thing to complain about.
Weekends have started early for the past four
weeks with SCN's Thursday concert series in the
newly remodeled environment.
Sophomore Jonah Merger, who heads SCN,
said the decision to hold a concert series was based
on a number of factors. "We had a series last year
and it went well," said Berger. "We don't hold any
of our bigger shows in the winter, so this quarter
was a good opportunity to bold the series."
Berger said the Co Ho Concert Series has at
tracted bands from all over the country. This
1 hinsday, the final concert in the series will fea
ture a well-known Boston band called The Slip.
S( :N < hose bands from groups who submitted
requests to play at Stanford and from students'
suggestions in the Concert Network.
Junior Scott Mooney was instrumental in
bringing the Berkeley band Dealership to the Cof
fee House last Thursday. Mooney had heard the
group play at a local show and was determined to
bring them to campus.
Mooney said he was pleased with SCN's open
ness to suggestions. "I think there is a lot of good
local music out there," he said. "You've just got to
be willing to search it out."
Despite the large number of performances
held over a short period of time, the Col lo Con
cert Series does not place an unmanageable finan
cial burden on SCN, which is funded by ASSU
special fees.
Though unable to comment on specific com
pensation paid to each band, Berger said, "We
have to pay for production, |but otherwise] it's
( heap compared to the other things we do during
the year."
Student reaction to the series has been positive,
even among those who don't normally frequent
the Coffee House. "The time that I went [to the
Coffee House] was only because it was opening
night." said sophomore Sarah Cluckstern. "1
thought the fact that they had a live band was cool."
()tlie-i s said they were oblivious to the existence
of the series. Sophomore Sam Cheng said, "1 don't
know about the music, but it'sa good social scene."
Sophomore Bi Ade said she felt that advertising
lor the- series was inadequate. "I've only seen one
poster and au e-mail," she said. "Maybe if they did

follow-ups with eye-catching phrases, more peo
ple would know about it."
Ade also found the lac k of diversity among the
groups disappointing, and said she hopes that
SCN will eventually bring hip-hop and R B
groups to the Coflee I louse.
Berger said that reaction from Coffee House
management has been good. "We are helping
them with more business," he said. "We put out a
weekly e-mail with what's going on in the Co Ho
in addition to our series."
Overall, Berger is enthusiastic about the suc
cess of the series, and said that SCN might orga
nize another series in the spring.
"We really felt this has gone very well and we'd
like more people to get out to the (ol lo more," he
said. "The Co Ho really is a great place for stu
dents to hang out and study. We want to bring
more of a social atmosphere to campus."
