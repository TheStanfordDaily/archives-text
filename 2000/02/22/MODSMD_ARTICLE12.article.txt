## GOP race heats up Troops block Albanian crowd in Kosovo 
### 
HAMTRAMCK, Mich. (AP) —
Janet Hess is bouncing on her
toes to keep warm in the pre
dawn chill, watching George W.
Bush shake hands outside a facto
ry gate. "I was with John
McCain," she says, her breath
forming a white stream of vapor.
"But things changed the other
day."
It was just the other day when
the Texas governor staggered
McCain s presidential campaign
with a runaway victory in South
Carolina's Republican primary,
rallying bedrock GOP voters in
numbers to swamp McCain's dis
parate collection of indepen
dents, Democrats and moderate
Republicans.
With little time to recover
before today's primary here, the
Arizona senator is trying to
increase his support among party
regulars while reaching outside
the GOP base to urban
Democrats, suburban Republi
cans and blue-collar indepen
dents like Hess.
Bush, meanwhile, is following
the traditional GOP playbook, the
same one he used in defeat dur
ing New Hampshire's leadoff'pri
mary campaign and in his Satur
day victory in South Carolina.
His all-establishment lineup
includes Gov. John Engler, the
state's lieutenant governor, the
secretary of state, 21 ol its 23 GOP
senators, 51 of 58 lawmakers and
the entire Republican congres
sional delegation.
Polls show the race is a dead
heat, and analysts say Michigan
Republicans are expected to be
more receptive to McCain than
their South Carolina counter
parts. But interviews yesterday
with independent analysts, opera
tives in both campaigns and more
two dozen voters suggest that
McCain's Michigan-style coalition
is as fragile as it is unpredictable.
"Nobody knows who will turn
out so nobody knows who will
win," said Michigan pollster Fx I
Sarpolus. But he said McCain lias
tightened the race with dual
appeals to traditional and non
traditional voters.
For McCain to succeed, he
needs huge turnouts in places like
Saginaw, a working-class city 96
miles north of Detroit. But his
visit to a local high school yester
ay drew fewer than 200 actual
voters in a made-for-'l V crowd
filled out with raucous teen-agers.
After seven of every 10 Repub
licans supported his rival in South
Carolina, McCain made the GOP
base his top priority here.
He campaigned in western
Michigan, heart of the state's con
servative movement, at the
expense of friendlier indepen
dent-minded bedroom commu
nities north of Detroit — and
declared himself the race's true
conservative. "Texas has the most
liberal laws on campaign
finance," lie told more than 1,000
supporters in Traverse City.

KOSOVSKA MI FRO VIC A, Yugoslavia
(AP) — French and British troops fired tear
gas to push back thousands ol ethnic Albani
ans trying to Ibrcc their wav across a bridge
into the Serb-controlled side of this etlmicallv
divided city.
Up to 4.000 Serbs were waiting on the
north side of the bridge, determined to battle
the Albanians themselves to keep them Irom
entering their part of this northwestern Koso
vo industrial city.
I he Albanian c rowd, numbering between
6,000 and 10,000, managed to breach French
positions on the approach to the bridge over
the I bar River, and more French troops
rushed to the bridge and began firing volleys
of tear gas in live-minute intervals.
British troops blocked the bridge with
armored vehicles and pushed awa\ ethnic
Albanian men who tried to climb over the
vehicles.
By the (i p.m. start of a daily 12-hour cur
few, crowds on both sides were dispersing.

In a sign that the Serbs were prepared for a
showdown, some Serb women and children
began evacuating the city, and a local Serb
leader, Nikola kabasic, told a Belgrade radio
station that the Serbs were bringing in rein
forcements from neighboring villages to
defend their part ol the citv if NATO cannot
control the Albanians.
No American troops were involved in the
scuffles at the bridge. On Sunday, U.S. troops
taking part in a weapons search in the Serb
part of the c ity withdrew to the ethnic Albani
an south bank after Serbs pelted them with
stones.
Fhe commander of the embattled, NATO
led Kosovo Force, German Gen. Klaus Rein
hardt, congratulated the troops for showing
restraint in the face of escalating tensions,
which threaten to engulf this city and perhaps
the entire province in an all new round of
bloodletting.
"The key thing really was to prevent an
escalation in which somebody fired on the

other one," Reinliardt said. "Ii would have
been a disaster. My soldiers were very reason
able. They used just the amount of power
needed and did not overreact."
kosovska Mitrovica is the most ethnically
tense city in Kosovo because it contains the
largest Serb community remaining in the
province.
Most Kosovo Serbs fled following the with
drawal of Yugoslav troops in June and the
arrival of NATO-led peacekeepers.
In New York, the American ambassador to
the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke,
blamed the Yugoslav government for foment
ing trouble in Kosovska Mitrovica.
The 9,000 Serbs who remain here fear that
if the 00,000 ethnic: Albanians living across the
river are allowed free access to the north side,
they will launch reprisal attacks such as
occurred elsewhere in Kosovo after Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic halted his c rac k
down against ethnic Albanian separatists and
withdrew his troops from the province.
