BEIJING (AP) — With a
month to go in Taiwan's presi
dential election campaign, China
warned yesterday that ii might
attack the island if Taiwanese
leaders indefinitely refuse to talk
unification.
The threat, delivered in a pol
icy paper from China's cabinet,
was intended to increase the pres
sure on Taiwan's three presiden
tial candidates.
Although there was no imme
diate reaction from Taiwan's gov
ernment or the candidates'
camps, policy toward China has
been at the center of the cam
paign. which ends March 18.
Already this month, China
sailed its newly acquired, heavily
armed Russian-built destroyer
through the Taiwan Strait.
And Chinese President Jiang
Zemin over the weekend toured
military bases in southern China
that would be the ones used in
any invasion of Taiwan, the Hong
Kong media reported.
Such tactics, and yesterday's
heated words from the State
Council, were ominous
reminders that Taiwan and
China remain antagonists in an
unfinished, seven-decade civil
war.
Although democratic Taiwan
has relinquished its claim to the
communist mainland, China con
siders the island a rebel province.
China has long vowed to wage
war if Taiwan declared indepen
dence outright or foreign forces
inec ; lfll<4.
The policy paper from the
State Council added Taiwanese
foot-dragging over unification
talks to the list of provocative
circumstances that would com
pel China to attack.
II any of those three situa
tions arose, "then the Chinese
government will be forced to
adopt all drastic measures possi
ble, including the use of force, to
. . . fulfill the great cause of
reunification," the document
said.
