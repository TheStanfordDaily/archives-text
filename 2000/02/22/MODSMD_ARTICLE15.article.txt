# Khatami answers political demands from Iranian detractors

### 
(AP) — President Mohammad Khata
mi's reformist faction routed the hard-line
opposition in historic legislative elections
that Iranians hope will lead to more free
dom and jobs in this fundamentalist Mus
lim country. Now he has to deliver.
Iranians are looking for a cure for their
stagnant economy and rampant unem
ployment. Many also want continued
expansion of social freedoms.
It will be a new challenge lor Khatami,
who has pushed reforms since 1997 but
thus far has been restrained In hard-liners

who dominated other positions of power.
Seventy percent of Iran's 62 million
people are Ix-low 30 years of age. Tired of
the hard-line clergy that has ruled with an
iron hand since overthrowing the U.S.-
backed shah in the 1979 Islamic revolu
tion, young people were behind Khata
mi's 1997 election victory and the thrash
ing of the hard-liners in Friday's voting
lor the Majlis, or parliament.
Though final returns are not yet in, the
reformists have won 137 of 191 seats so far
— 72 percent — and are leading in crucial

races in Tehran. Victories there will assure
them a majority in the 290-seat Majlis, or
parliament.
L ntil now, Iranians had blamed almost
all of the nation's ills on the hard-liners.
But after it consolidates its new power,
Khatami's pro-reform faction will have to
take direct responsibility for all of Iran's
shortcomings.
Official figures put the unemployment
rate at 20 percent, but Iranian economists
say the rate is much higher. Nearly every
family has young men and women who

can't find jobs and can't marry because
they cannot afford housing.
A senior civil servant earns no more
than the equivalent of $300 per month
just enough to make ends meet. In a
country that is the world's third-largest oil
producer, many workers hold two or even
three jobs just to survive.
Little is likely to change without first
tackling the bonyads — huge, wide-rang
ing foundations that control millions in
assets.
After the revolution, the enormous

assets ol the shah and his cronies were
given to the bonyads to care lor the needy.
While the) still do that, their focus has
changed to acquiring wealth by control
ling large chunks ol the economy.
(lonservative estimates sa\ the dozen or
so main bonyads control at least a quarter
of the economy.
I he largest, the Honyad Mosta/alan,
cares for the poor and veterans of the
1980-88 war with Iraq, but it also owns
everything from suit drink plants to luxu
ry hotels.
