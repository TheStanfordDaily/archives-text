## The 						Stanford Daily Knight Initiative more than just a legal action

Willi SOMK ARI.A churches
recently deciding to rally against
Proposition 22 and Stanford reli
gious organizations decidedly split
on the issue, the outcome of the March 7 vole on
the so-called "Knight Initiative" remains uncer
tain at best.
I he Knight Initiative — named for its prima
ry proponent. State Senator I Vie Knight —seeks
to amend the California family Code with the
statement: "()nl\ a marriage between a man and
a woman shall be valid and recognized." On its
face, the Initiative appears to be a formal
endorsement of heterosexual marriage and,
consequently, a formal denial of the validity of
same-sex marriages in the state of (ialifbrnia.
I lowever, as straightforward as this may seem,
ii overlooks one simple lad — namely that same
sex marriages are currently illegal in California.

Willi this in mind, the Knight Initiative, if
passed, would not be changing California state
law at all. What would change, however, is Cali
fornia's approach to marriages recognized in
other states.
California currently recognizes all marriages
conducted in other states, whether they are in
keeping with California policies on "marriage"
or not. Thus, if other states chose to recognize
same-sex marriages in the future, the Knight
Initiative would effectively prevent California
from recognizing same-sex couples married in
those states.
In precluding California from ever recogniz
ing same-sex marriages, whether in or outside
the state, the Knight Initiative becomes more
than an action of legal necessity, for it is already
the law. Instead, it serves as a moralistic legislative
statement against homosexuality in general.

According to a report entitled, "Same-Sex
Couples: Marriage, Families, and Children: An
Analysis of Proposition 22, the Knight Initiative"
by Stanford Law Prof. Michael S. VVald, propo
nents of the Initiative site several reasons why
recognizing same-sex marriages would he
harmful. The first of these centers on the notion
that "homosexuality is morally wrong."
Second, proponents claim that same-sex mar
riage runs contrary to the very nature of mar
riage, which is to procreate and, furthermore,
that "sexual intercourse itself is morally accept
able only for the purpose of procreation," there
by limiting "acceptable" sex — and, consequent
ly, marriage — to heterosexual relations.
Among some of the other claims, proponents
also contend that same-sex marriages are so
unlike heterosexual marriages that "standard
family policies" should not apply to them.

Regardless of one's feelings on the morality
of same-sex marriages, it is easy to see why, with
400,000 same-sex couples currently living in
California, any and all of these claims would
and should not hold up under Constitutional
scrutiny. It is not the place of California's legis
lature to take a stance on matters such as same
sex marriage on the basis of its specific value
system.
If there was a compelling legal need for the
passage of legislation like the Knight Initiative —
if California lacked a position on same-sex mar
riage altogether — such legislative action would
be justified. However, given that California has a
definitive stance and, consequently, that the
rationale behind this legislation is wholly moral
istic in nature, it seems unnecessary at best and,
at worst, an outrageous affront to conscientious
law-makers and citizens alike.
