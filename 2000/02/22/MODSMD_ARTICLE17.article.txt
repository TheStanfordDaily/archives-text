## The 						California Myth 
### 
The following story is what is iu
the minds of fast Coasters —
who find validation for the
inyth in everything from televi
sion ("90210" — need I sav more?),
movies ("1..A. Story" conies to mind)
and even books (" I he (>rapes of Wrath"
and certain issues of "Playboy").
Once upon a lime, far, far awa\ on
the other side ol the country, there was
a wonderful land called California. It
was said to be perpetually sunny and
warm, and ;ill the inhabitants frolicked
in the waves, lounged on the beaches
and hiked in the mountains to no end.

I heir language was
riddled with quaint
\v<>i (Is like "dude ' and
"hella" and even the
oc( asional "gnai ly."
Ihe women were
most l.iii with long
blonde hait and big . .
. handbags ... and
were even given the
title of "Valle) <.ills."
I hey consistently

uttered wise phrases like "()h inv god!,"
"Gag me with a spoon!" and other apho
risms w hit 11 < on lon tided even the wisest
of oui Kast Coast philosophers.
It was said tli.it all Caliibrtiians loved
the outdoors, but, lor some reason,
spent hall then time in BMW's and Mer
cedes-Benz's, driving them on special
roads denoted with the mysterious num
bers " 10")" and "1011 hev were places
Id) them to worship the foundation of
their "car culture," as it was tailed, as the
roads were collectiveb named "free
ways,' in honor ol the freedom the ( ali
fornians lelt (even if they weren't actual
ly moving) while in their automobiles.
1 lien, one day, an adventurous trav
eler — we'll call liiin (lliris — decided to
forgo the calm and sale lile ol the l.ast
and made a pilgrimage to the fountain
ol wisdom that la\ in the middle ol (lal
ifornia, tailed Stanford. He wanted to
see if all the stories were true, to see lot
himself if lile i eallv was better there or il
indeed it was just the cheese. He wanted
to become indoctrinated into the glori
ous ways of life, to lee I the constant sun,
to sin! in the aina/iiig waves and to set*
the fairest women of all the Kartli.
To begin with, the palms, symbols ol
paradise, were not even native. 1 hey
were ripped up from some real sun
drenched paratliasit al land and
dragged to the perpetually "nice" Cali
fornia. "How is the weather today?"
Chris would ask, and the response was
always the same: "Nice." It was never
hot and it was never told. It was like
some sort of sick mind-game where one

invariably ended up being either too hot
or too cold simply because it was always
so "nice" and never at 11Kills hot or cold.
I he only solution was changing gar
ments five times a dav.
And then winter approached and,
while it was (ailed winter, it too was a lie.
I he sun disappeared lor weeks on end
and the firmament was ripped asunder
and niiii drenched the land lor days on
end without relenting. Moods and mud
slides were everywhere, but Chris, poor
Chris, little did he know, lie could buy
a nice rain-coat to battle the elements,
but il he wore it to class, by the time he
lelt, it was clear and blue.
And il he forgot it? Cuaranteed it
would be raining in time for the long
ride back to his home. It was as though
being a n lie (ialiloi nian meant eternalK
having a wet bottom from biking in the
rain — the same rain that wasn't sup
posed to have been there in the first
place. It w.is .1 sick, sic k joke.
And then the worshipping on the
frecwa\. It turned out that that was a lie
as well. It was actually nothing more
than a simple traffic-jam — just like back
at home in the 112 ast, ( lit is even went to
the beach, but the heaw wind and icy
water would deter all but those who
donned special suits treated lor the
sport. I his was no beach paradise — it
was .ill a lie, a big invth propagated In
the powerful community o! Hollywood
who peddled their stories the world
over to suck people in to their society.
But we must return to (lln is. I'liey
got him — oh \es, he could never live
on the fast ('.oast again. His first real
winter back, he nearly died from the
shock of true cold weather and snow —
<i phenomenon he had all hut forgotten,
besides, the traffic was always so horri
ble that he could never make it off 280
to get to the airport anyway. The land of
the Colclen Hear had brainwashed him
with its beautiful maidens and glorious
landscapes and different (if nothing
else) approach to life.
Yes, California was a fine place to
live, as long as one got over the earth
quakes, fires, riots, mudslides, traflic
jains, smog and "nice" weather. I hcre
was something about the place — a will
to live, a joie de vivre — that made it
impossible to leave and impossible to
forget, lo Chris, California, for some
inexplicable yet inescapable reason, had
become home.
)'ou can compliment Chris Moloney at
cmoloneyQileland. the rumors of his deoth
store are simply untrue. In fact, on the East
('.oast, death-staring is a sign of friendship
and openness.
