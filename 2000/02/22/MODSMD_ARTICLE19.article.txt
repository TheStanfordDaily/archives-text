Former faculty explain rationale for
filing Labor Department complaint
lull lot's Note: This letter was originally sent to
the University's Hoard of Trustees in October by
a group of women who 112 iled a complaint with the
labor Department concerning possible discrimi
nation iti Stanford's hiring, promotion, and
compensation practices.
As you are no doubt aware, the U.S.
Department of Labor's Office of Federal
Contract Compliance ("OFCCP") is inves
tigating Stanford University. This investi
gation is the result of numerous com
plaints that point to widespread gender
and race discrimination in the University's
hiring, retention, and promotion of
women and minority faculty and senior
researchers. Federal investigators are
presently on campus. At stake in this inves
tigation are the approximately $500 mil
lion Stanford University receives annually
in federal contract payments and research
grants.
I he allegations that prompted the
Department of Labor investigation are
well founded, and our own experiences
suggest that investigators will uncover
extensive violations of federal equal oppor
tunity laws. Many women and minority
faculty have initiated individual legal
actions in addition to filing complaints with
the Department. Some of these
legal proceedings are ongoing; others have

already been settled. But our goal extends
beyond simply obtaining redress on a
piecemeal basis for individual wrongs. We
want to put an end to discrimination at
Stanford.
We believe that discrimination at Sum
lord is deeply rooted and pervasive. It is
important to be clear about what we mean
when we make such a charge. Discrimina
tion in the 1990s is different from the dis
crimination prevalent in the United States
in the earlier part of this century that
prompted the passage of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964. It is nonetheless still prevalent,
especially at the highest levels of the insti
tutions that shape and govern American
life.
Discrimination today in places such as
Stanford is best described as a pervasive
pattern of acts that demean, marginalize,
and exclude traditionally disadvantaged
groups. These acts occur not only in hiring
and promotions but also in other less
noticed areas such as teaching assign
ments, mentoring, allocation of valuable
resources like laboratory spat e or research
money, inclusion on significant commit
tees, and involvement in informal conver
sations about the management and direc
tion of the institution. The present-day
form of discrimination is sometimes delib
erate or overtly hostile; more often it is
unconscious. It sometimes consists of a sin
gle blatant, highly damaging act; more
often it is an accumulation of seemingly

trivial but persistent slights. Whatever its
form, it is enormously destructive and
demoralizing and should be as soundly
condemned as the earlier forms of bigotry
that so shocked the nation's conscience.
Discrimination is not a problem that is
unique to Stanford. Universities have one
of the worst records of any U.S. industry
with respect to the hiring, retention, and
promotion of women and people of color
at their highest levels â€” namely in the
ranks of faculty and senior researchers and
administrators. We believe that the poor
record of universities is due in large part to
the highly subjective and secretive nature
of the evaluations that determine who
should enjoy the privileges that these insti
tutions confer. Decisions that are made in
this context are apt to be fraught with bias.
Even among institutions of higher learn
ing, however, Stanford appears to stand
out, in the severity of its gender and race
problem and, more important, in the
unhelpful and self-defeating way it has
responded to the problem.
Stanford faculty and students have
repeatedly attempted to get University
leaders to engage in an open and honest
dialogue on the lack of faculty diversity.
Their aim has always been to work with
University administrators to define the
precise nature of the problem, identify its
causes, and develop and implement effec
