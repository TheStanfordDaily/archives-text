Former faculty explain rationale for
filing Labor Department complaint
lull lot's Note: This letter was originally sent to
the University's Hoard of Trustees in October by
a group of women who 112 iled a complaint with the
labor Department concerning possible discrimi
nation iti Stanford's hiring, promotion, and
compensation practices.
As you are no doubt aware, the U.S.
Department of Labor's Office of Federal
Contract Compliance ("OFCCP") is inves
tigating Stanford University. This investi
gation is the result of numerous com
plaints that point to widespread gender
and race discrimination in the University's
hiring, retention, and promotion of
women and minority faculty and senior
researchers. Federal investigators are
presently on campus. At stake in this inves
tigation are the approximately $500 mil
lion Stanford University receives annually
in federal contract payments and research
grants.
I he allegations that prompted the
Department of Labor investigation are
well founded, and our own experiences
suggest that investigators will uncover
extensive violations of federal equal oppor
tunity laws. Many women and minority
faculty have initiated individual legal
actions in addition to filing complaints with
the Department. Some of these
legal proceedings are ongoing; others have

already been settled. But our goal extends
beyond simply obtaining redress on a
piecemeal basis for individual wrongs. We
want to put an end to discrimination at
Stanford.
We believe that discrimination at Sum
lord is deeply rooted and pervasive. It is
important to be clear about what we mean
when we make such a charge. Discrimina
tion in the 1990s is different from the dis
crimination prevalent in the United States
in the earlier part of this century that
prompted the passage of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964. It is nonetheless still prevalent,
especially at the highest levels of the insti
tutions that shape and govern American
life.
Discrimination today in places such as
Stanford is best described as a pervasive
pattern of acts that demean, marginalize,
and exclude traditionally disadvantaged
groups. These acts occur not only in hiring
and promotions but also in other less
noticed areas such as teaching assign
ments, mentoring, allocation of valuable
resources like laboratory spat e or research
money, inclusion on significant commit
tees, and involvement in informal conver
sations about the management and direc
tion of the institution. The present-day
form of discrimination is sometimes delib
erate or overtly hostile; more often it is
unconscious. It sometimes consists of a sin
gle blatant, highly damaging act; more
often it is an accumulation of seemingly

trivial but persistent slights. Whatever its
form, it is enormously destructive and
demoralizing and should be as soundly
condemned as the earlier forms of bigotry
that so shocked the nation's conscience.
Discrimination is not a problem that is
unique to Stanford. Universities have one
of the worst records of any U.S. industry
with respect to the hiring, retention, and
promotion of women and people of color
at their highest levels — namely in the
ranks of faculty and senior researchers and
administrators. We believe that the poor
record of universities is due in large part to
the highly subjective and secretive nature
of the evaluations that determine who
should enjoy the privileges that these insti
tutions confer. Decisions that are made in
this context are apt to be fraught with bias.
Even among institutions of higher learn
ing, however, Stanford appears to stand
out, in the severity of its gender and race
problem and, more important, in the
unhelpful and self-defeating way it has
responded to the problem.
Stanford faculty and students have
repeatedly attempted to get University
leaders to engage in an open and honest
dialogue on the lack of faculty diversity.
Their aim has always been to work with
University administrators to define the
precise nature of the problem, identify its
causes, and develop and implement effec
tive remedies. The present crisis, includ
ing the Labor Department investigation,
can be traced directly to the steadfast
refusal ol the University's leaders to
address tlu- problem of disc rimination or,
remarkably, even to acknowledge its exis
tence.
Statements by University officials
regarding their obligations under federal
equal opportunity laws have been very
troubling. As reported in The San Fran
cisco Chronicle, President Gerhard
Casper, responding to news of the Labor
Department investigation, complained
that it was difficult "to know precisely what
the law dictates" in this area. But the law
that governs federal contractors such as
Stanford is straightforward. It requires the
elimination of discrimination and the
removal of barriers to equal opportunity
for women and minorities. Where there
are fewer women or minorities that would
be reasonably expected given their avail
ability in the labor market, employers are
required to establish goals and timetables
to counteract the bias that has led the dis
parity. The law also requires that equal
opportunity be made available at all levels
of emplovment — in hiring, retention,
and promotion. Yet, speaking on behalf of
the University, former lYovost Condolee/-
/a Rice has repeatedl\ stated that she sup
ports equal opportunity in bit ing but not
promotions. She also has stated that she
does not believe in goals and timetables.
Stanford's response to complaints by
women and minorities of unequal treat
ment also compares unfavorably to that of
some of its peer institutions. The recent
action In the Massachusetts Institute of
Tec hnology provides a striking contrast.
In March 1999, Ml I issued a report
ac knowledging that women on its lacultv
siillcr from pervasive, if unintentional, dis
crimination. The report also announced
specific steps Mi l would be taking to
increase the number of women faculty,
improve their status and professional lives,
and ensure their equitable treatment. I bis

report, unprecedented in its candor, was
distributed to the international press and
posted on the Internet.
Ihe enlightened approach taken by
MlT's leaders not only has avoided a rash
of lawsuits and a major federal investiga
tion, but has resulted in MIT being hailed
as a visionary institution. The San Fran
cisco Chronicle, among others, said that
the Mi l report "should serve as a catalyst
for colleges and universities throughout
the country to seriously re-evaluate treat
ment of women faculty members."
Stanford has often attempted to defend
its record by arguing that those women
and minorities who were not hired, or
have resigned, or been dismissed, or
denied promotion, simply did not mea
sure up to the University's exceedingly
high standards of excellence. We find such
arguments, in and of themselves, to be
reflective of deeply entrenched institution
al bias. As MIT so eloquently stated in its
report on the status of women: "First and
foremost it is essential to set aside the issue
of whether these women were badly treat
ed because they were simply not good
enough. It must be understood that for
these particular women the opposite was
undeniably true. Despite discrimination,
most of these women achieved at an out
standing level within their professions . . .
Only people above the average Mil facul
ty could have succeeded at this level
despite the many obstacles the senior
women faculty encountered in their
careers. Indeed it should be almost obvi
ous that the first women, the first blacks,
the* pioneers who break through despite
enormous barriers must be exceptional.
Once and for all we must recognize that
the heart and soul of discrimination, the
last refuge of the bigot, is to say that those
who are discriminated against deserve it
because they are less good."
We care deeply about the University
and its mission. It is in that spirit that we
are taking the extraordinary step of
appealing directly to the Board of
Trustees. The discrimination we experi
enced at Stanford, and our decision to
speak out publicly against it, have come at
an enormous personal and professional
cost. We readily concede that we
are angry. But our anger is rooted
in more than llu- loss of our indi
vidual professional lives. We arc
angry at the- loss of possibility not
only for us, but for our students,
our colleagues, and indeed lor the
institution whose purpose we had
committed our lives to fulfilling.
1 lie current state of affairs has
taken a heavy toll. Stanford lias
been beset by a record number ol
internal grievances and lawsuits. It
has losi some of the nation's most
talented, accomplished, and distin
guished female and minority sc hol
ars, research scientists, and teach
ers. Morale among students .is well
as faculty lias sullered. Precious fi
nancial and administrative re
sources have been diverted into
costly and protracted legal battles.
I here lias been a barrage < •! nega
tive publicity. 11 seems obvious thai
Stanford is in need of a more con
structive response.
It lias been 35 years since the
passage of the ( ivil Rights Act and
the century is rapidly drawing to a
close. I lie lac k ol faculty diversity in
I S. universities is a national dis
grace. Stanford should be striving
to be a model of true diversity. In
stead, University officials have
sought to defend Stanford's pool
numbers by arguing that they arc
doing as badl\ as everyone else. II
the I Diversity continues on its pre
sent path, Stanford is destined to be

remembered as one ol the last stub
born bastions of bigotry, instead of
as a leader in the fight for race and
gender equality.
We encourage you to pay close
attention to these matters, and to be
vigorous in your quest for answers
and solutions. Your commitment to
excellence in higher education, as
well as your fiduciary responsibility
as a trustee ol one of the world's
premier universities, requires
nothing less.
