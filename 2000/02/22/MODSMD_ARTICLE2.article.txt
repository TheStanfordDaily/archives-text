Stanford's Ad Hoc Advisory

viewing Stanford's interdiscipli
nary programs to determine the
most effective ways to run IDPs.
"We don't want to close down
any IDPs," said Chemistry Prof.
Dick Zare, chair of the commit
tee. "We're dealing with much
bigger issues than any one I DP
- we're not trying to say one
I DP is stronger than the other."
Zare said this is the first time
any evaluation of this type has
been done at Stanford.
Twenty-five percent of Stan

an IDP. Stanford offers 4l dif
ferent IDPs, ranging from Fem
inist Studies to Human Biology.

One of the first concerns the
committee will review is "the re
lationship of the I DP to the de
partment and the department's
relationship to the IDP," accord

affects undergraduate teaching

and innovation

view determine whether the
IDP can continue to grant de
grees.
"1 believe IDPs benefit from
the reviews and that is at least
partly why many, including
Human Biology, have excellent
teaching and well-rationalized
curricula," Fernald said. Fer
nald added that departmental
curricula are not systematically
reviewed.
The review process for IDPs
is currently internal, which
makes many committee mem
bers wonder if the process is bi
ased toward existing programs.
"There are a number of pro
grams that have self-reviews,
and it's not clear that they really
are subject to the same sort of re
view that other departments
are," Zare said.
The committee is also looking
at the possibility of changing the
current structure of IDPs. For
example, the committee is con
sidering if chairpeople should
head I DPs and how I DPs should
be staffed.
"These issues make people ner
vous," Zare said. "Do smaller

IDPs get stronger if you have an
actual administration, il you have
a secretary?"
Some people predict this move
would cause smaller depart
ments, such as Native American

Studies and Asian American
Studies, to lose individuality. (fil
ers believe this move would ulti
mately benefit the departments.

whether those incentives are ade

there are also few of them," /are
said. "How do we deal with them
if they get burned out and we
