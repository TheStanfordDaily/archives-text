The Ad Hoc Committee,
which is supervised by the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, began its study last month
by presenting questions at the
Jan. 20 Faculty Senate meeting.
Although a Jan. 26 article in
The Stanford Report said that

Stanford's Ad Hoc Advisory
(Committee on 1 nterdepartmen
tal Programs recently began re
viewing Stanford's interdiscipli
nary programs to determine the
most effective ways to run IDPs.
"We don't want to close down
any IDPs," said Chemistry Prof.
Dick Zare, chair of the commit
tee. "We're dealing with much
bigger issues than any one I DP
- we're not trying to say one
I DP is stronger than the other."
Zare said this is the first time
any evaluation of this type has
been done at Stanford.
Twenty-five percent of Stan
ford undergraduates major in
an IDP. Stanford offers 4l dif
ferent IDPs, ranging from Fem
inist Studies to Human Biology.
"In general, IDPs give stu
dents an opportunity to learn
about topics that relate to sever
al disciplines," said Psychology
Prof. Russ Fernald, head of the

wants to address issues with de
partmental reviews, resources
and incentives.
One of the first concerns the
committee will review is "the re
lationship of the I DP to the de
partment and the department's
relationship to the IDP," accord
ing to Zare. "This relationship
affects undergraduate teaching

and innovation
within each
unit."

riculum. The results of the re
view determine whether the
IDP can continue to grant de
grees.
"1 believe IDPs benefit from
the reviews and that is at least
partly why many, including
Human Biology, have excellent
teaching and well-rationalized
curricula," Fernald said. Fer
nald added that departmental
curricula are not systematically
reviewed.
The review process for IDPs
is currently internal, which
makes many committee mem
bers wonder if the process is bi
ased toward existing programs.
"There are a number of pro
grams that have self-reviews,
and it's not clear that they really
are subject to the same sort of re
view that other departments
are," Zare said.
The committee is also looking
at the possibility of changing the
current structure of IDPs. For
example, the committee is con
sidering if chairpeople should
head I DPs and how I DPs should
be staffed.
"These issues make people ner
