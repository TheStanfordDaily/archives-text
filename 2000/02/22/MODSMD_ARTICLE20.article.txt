# Wanted: A few good grad students
## 
### JOHN MILLS GUEST COLUMNIST 
Just like in) fellow grad students who
explore "extracurricular" activities, I
became involved in the ASSU for one
simple reason — to meet new people.
A friend of mine organized a group of six
grad students — that's right, six — to write
me in lor (»raduate Student Council in the
ASSU Spring 1998 General Election.
It was supposed to be a joke. And, to
my friend's credit, I still laugh about it
today, not because it was funny, but
because it opened the door to one of the
most rewarding experiences of my life*.

The best I had
hoped lor was a change
ol pace from the d;iilv
grind of the lab —
maybe even a lew fresh
faces to broaden my
somewhat limited
social c ircle. Bel ore I
knew it. I was helping
to organize ;i rally to
advocate for more grad
student housing, pi.in-

ningcampus-w ide grad student parties and
coordinating the Pacific 10 Leadership
Conference. In the meantime, I was being
encouraged by then-ASSU President
Maren Norton and Vice President Santos
Manoquin to stick around li>i this year's
ASSU — in a larger, and, for a grad stu
dent, more pioneering capacity.
I he campaign lor ASSU president and
vice president was nothing less than exhil
arating. It gave me a Ibrum to talk about
the issues that I cared about and held the
promise of the opportunity to actually
make a dillerence In ac ting on them. I hey
included matters like campus safety,

enhancing the quality of student life on
campus and increasing student voice at all
levels of University decision-making. And,
along the way, I also managed to meet
new people — scores of them.
Since my election as ASSU vice presi
dent, I've never forgotten what a rare
opportunity I've been given and what a
short amount of time I have to take advan
tage of this opportunity to the fullest
extent. I've tried to look at my campaign
promises like a "To Do" list — just method
ic ally work through them, one by one.
I'm still working on campus safety,
compiling the results from our recent sur
vey on campus lighting and writing a cor
responding report. The Stanford After
Midnight Program has, on the whole,
been a success — a tangible improvement
to the quality of student life on campus.
And perhaps the achievement of which
I'm most proud is ensuring that both a
grad student and an undergrad sit on the
Presidential Search Committee.
Ensuring that grad students have a
voice on this campus has been my goal,
above and beyond all others. As ASSU
Vice President, I'm constitutionally a
member of the GSC and my hope has
been to use my dual role in the ASSU to
strengthen the grad student voice.
1 like to think that I've been able to do
just that — be it through a conversation
with the right administrator, a carefully
worded e-mail sent to the right people, a
"Letter to the Editor" of The Daily or just
being present at a meeting where a grad
student had never been present before.
And, in my two years with the ASSU, 1
think the University has made strides in
trying to foster a sense of belonging for
Stanford's grad students. I applaud the re
organization of the Dean of Students

Of lice to include a Graduate Life Division.
I also commend the Stanford Alumni
Association for its efforts to reach out to
the grad student community through its
Student Services Division. And 1 praise
Cowell Student Health Service for taking
the giad student voice into account during
the process of selecting a new health insur
ance provider for students.
But my work here isn't over. And the
work of the Graduate Student Council
isn't over. Far from it, in fact. Recently, we
learned that the ofl-campus grad student
housing subsidy program may be
reduced. Yes, we've made significant
progress over the last two years, but this
latest news is a clear indication that grad
students have a long way to go.
Still, although my work here may not
be over, my time as ASSU vice president is
rapidly drawing to a close. Which leads me
to the point of my story — you. II you are
a grad student, and you've read this iiir,
please keep reading. We need you. Your
fellow grad students need you. I need you.
1 need you to pick up where I will have to
leave off. There is so much left to be done.
There is so much more that vou can do.
Just think about it. Think about taking
a few hours out of your week, a lew hours
away from your research, to make Stan
lord a better place lot grad students, for all
of ns. Tin not asking you to run lor ASSU
vice president (although I would whole
heartedly encourage it). Just find a way to
become involved. You can thank me later.

John Mills, this war's ,fS'.S7 ' vice president, is a
doctoral student in (imetics. // you would like to
speak to him about running Jor office (ASSI
local, state, national, whatever) or just about
how to get involved, e-mail him at
