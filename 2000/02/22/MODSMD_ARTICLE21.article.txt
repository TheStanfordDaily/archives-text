## Mannequins simulate life 
### CINDY LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
4 A '"<* you ok, Annie?' is a line that many of us
ZA may recall from a CPR training class as we
Jl address the mannequin.
For more and more medical students, residents
and physicians today, they too are learning about
medical decision-making by practicing on man
nequin patient simulators before they deal with real
life situations.
A Stanford team led by Assoc. Prof, of Anesthesi
ology David M. Gaba invented the modern anesthe
sia simulator in 1986. I he current patient simulator
model is called the Eagle Patient Simulator, which
simulates an anesthetized or critically ill patient.
Recent advances in computer technology have fu
eled the development of the patient simulators that
can imitate the 112 unctioning of a human body under
medical emergencies.
The mannequin is connected to an interface cart
that controls its electrical and air pressure compo
nents and has the input cables for electronic monitors
such as blood pressures and heart rate.
The cart is connected to a main computer at a con
trol station that the instructor can control to simulate
medical crises such as a heart attack or malignant hy
perthermia, which is an adverse reaction to anesthe
sia when the temperature surges to 115 degrees.
This simulator is also capable of exhibiting symp
toms ranging from cardiac arrythmia or swollen legs
and arms to responses to different drug dosages in
jected through an IV.
1 fowever, Gaba remarks that the simulaw>r is not
entirely realistic, as individual patients have unique
responses.
"Every patient is different, and the spectrum of

'reactions' and 'timings' of even, say, young healthy
people is fairly broad," said Gaba.
"The mannequin is, as we call it sometimes, 'plas
ticman' — currently he doesn't sweat, form tears or
get warm or cold. Some things are as good as they can
be given the constraints. And some things are very re
alistic, like the data on the monitoring screens and so
forth."
At Stanford, the patient simulator is used in a cri
sis management course for anesthesia residents,
medical students rotating through anesthesia and in
collaboration with a Anesthesia Crisis Resource Man
agement course for neonatology to simulate resusci
tation of a newborn who is delivered with problems.
Gaba says that the simulator is most valuable for
imitating crisis situations and for training students
and residents who usually stand to the side and let an
experienced physician takeover with real patients.
"We like to use the simulator for things that can
not be taught very well or at all in real life," Gaba said.
"[Crisis situations] don't occur everyday in real life,
and they can't be 'scheduled.' "
The ethical dilemma associated with students or
residents administering treatments for the first time
on a real patient is also quelled by letting these physi
cians in training practice on a mannequin.
"With the simulator, we can let the junior people
be in charge, and we can let them succeed or fail — il
they make bad decisions, they have to deal with the
consequences," Gaba said.
Patient simulators are currently installed at teach
ing hospitals other than Stanford. These include
Harvard, Washington and Thomas Jefferson Uni
versities.
l he cost of a patient simulator of the complexity of
the Eagle costs between $150,000 and $200,000 for
the mannequin, computer and interface hardware.
