# Surfing the Web for money
## 
### SALAS SARAIYA 
Most of my working friends in college are making
around $200 a month. I am too — for getting some

much needed shut-eye. When Psychiatry
Prof. William Dement lauds the sanctity
of sleep, only a few of us know what he's

really talking about. It's all about that
green.
The basic model for pay-for-surf
companies was brought to the Internet
community by storm. When AllAdvan
tagecameup with its pay-for-surf idea in

the middle of last year, there were many
skeptics. When All Advantage rose in pop
ularity and started fulfilling its twofold

promise of attracting advertisers and con
sumers, copycats started springing up all over
the Internet map.

I checked out All Advantage, Spedia, Go
to World, ePipo, CashSurfers, Get Paid, Payßar,
Desktop Dollars, UtopiAD, AllGommunity, Money
for Mail, Dot Ad, Shark Hunt, It Ads Up, Extra
Salary, Value Pay and lie Paid, all of whom will pay
you to either surf the Web or to use one of their ser
vices.

By now, you've probably heard the spiel for
these companies, either from a Daily ad or a friend
desperate to make some cash. Let's say user big-
Money Salsa gets tired of listening to pirated MP.'Vs
and wants to earn money to buy C IDs. When big-
Money Salsa joins one of these sites, he enters per-

sonal information about the ads he would like to view

and his household income. This informa-

tion is intended to determine what kind of
interests bigMoneySalsa would have, big-

Money Salsa gets a referral code

which he can use later

bigMoneySalsa gets some
money, usually between 40
and (j() cents each hour he
views ads on a bar on the
bottom of his screen, up to a
limit of around 25 to 30
hours a month.
I hen comes the begging pe-

riod, when bigMoneySalsa
pleads with people to sign up.

II the friends sign up with big-

MoneySalsa's referral code and use

the service, bigMoneySalsa gets a frac-

tion of the friends' income. Then if the
friends recruit other people, bigMoneySal
sa gets a fraction of their income too. Then
if the friends' friends recruit other people,
bigMoneySalsa gets a fraction of their in
come too, and so on for four or five levels.
The Internet startups get their
money from advertisers. Advertisers can
directly market to bigMoneySalsa based
on the information he entered upon sign
ing up and the Web sites he visits.
