# Surfing the Web for money
## 
### SALAS SARAIYA 
Most of my working friends in college are making
around $200 a month. I am too — for getting some

much needed shut-eye. When Psychiatry
Prof. William Dement lauds the sanctity
of sleep, only a few of us know what he's

really talking about. It's all about that
green.
The basic model for pay-for-surf
companies was brought to the Internet
community by storm. When AllAdvan
tagecameup with its pay-for-surf idea in

the middle of last year, there were many
skeptics. When All Advantage rose in pop
ularity and started fulfilling its twofold

promise of attracting advertisers and con
sumers, copycats started springing up all over
the Internet map.

I checked out All Advantage, Spedia, Go
to World, ePipo, CashSurfers, Get Paid, Payßar,
Desktop Dollars, UtopiAD, AllGommunity, Money
for Mail, Dot Ad, Shark Hunt, It Ads Up, Extra
Salary, Value Pay and lie Paid, all of whom will pay
you to either surf the Web or to use one of their ser
vices.

By now, you've probably heard the spiel for
these companies, either from a Daily ad or a friend
desperate to make some cash. Let's say user big-
Money Salsa gets tired of listening to pirated MP.'Vs
and wants to earn money to buy C IDs. When big-
Money Salsa joins one of these sites, he enters per-

sonal information about the ads he would like to view

and his household income. This informa-

tion is intended to determine what kind of
interests bigMoneySalsa would have, big-

Money Salsa gets a referral code

which he can use later

bigMoneySalsa gets some
money, usually between 40
and (j() cents each hour he
views ads on a bar on the
bottom of his screen, up to a
limit of around 25 to 30
hours a month.
I hen comes the begging pe-

riod, when bigMoneySalsa
pleads with people to sign up.

II the friends sign up with big-

MoneySalsa's referral code and use

the service, bigMoneySalsa gets a frac-

tion of the friends' income. Then if the
friends recruit other people, bigMoneySal
sa gets a fraction of their income too. Then
if the friends' friends recruit other people,
bigMoneySalsa gets a fraction of their in
come too, and so on for four or five levels.
The Internet startups get their
money from advertisers. Advertisers can
directly market to bigMoneySalsa based
on the information he entered upon sign
ing up and the Web sites he visits.

When the money in big-
MoneySalsa's account exceeds $20
to $30. lie gets a check. Now big-
Money Salsa has money and can
waste it on little flat doughnut discs.
Many people have come up with
macros or programs that 'fake surf.'
They emulate surfing the Internet
by imitating mouse movements
and changing Web sites every
minute or so. You can run these
programs while you're not at your
computer and make money while
sleeping, going to class or running
naked through White Plaza.
Many companies, such as
Money For Mail and CiotoWorld
pay you to use other services, such
as e-mail and instant messaging,
through them as well.
I Ye been an All Advantage mem
ber since March of last year, and
have had nothing but good experi
ences with the company. Each
month I make $200 without break
ing a sweat.
When 1 visited sites of the other
companies, I expected to see well
organized companies and profes
sional looking Web sites. I was seri
ously disappointed by the majority
of them.
Most of the Web sites (Go
to World, Get Paid, Ignifiige, Cash-
Surfers, All Community, Money
For Mail, UtopiAD, It Ads Up) I vis
ited made me feel like a customer at
a used car lot. On Desktop Dollars'
home page, there were thirteen ex
clamation points. Thirteen!
They were pretty outdated too;
a few hadn't been updated since last

year. Many claimed they were on
the brink of releasing their view
bars, but didn't give a date.
When I checked their populari
ty ratings at PC Data Online, I
found out why these start-ups had
been slacking. All the companies
with the exception of two had risen
in popularity when All Advantage
made its first mass payments (Octo
ber/November of last year) and
quickly fallen back into oblivion
soon afterwards.
The two exceptions? All Adva
ntage (currently No. 16 Web proper
ty on the Internet, ahead of Real-
Networks, Ask Jeeves and kara's
Adult Playground) and
BePaid.com (currently No. 431
Web site).
While BePaid.com is ranked
eighth in unique visitors among
pay-for-surf Web sites, it is the only
one save .All Advantage that contin
ues to grow.
While the other companies have
small viewbars and a click through
rate of only 0.8 percent, BePaid
shows full screen ads and antici
pates a higher click through rate.
BePaid claims that its higher click
through rate will entice advertisers
to spend more per consumer view,
and enable BePaid to pay more to
its customers.
They claim that they will be able
to pay between $20 and SI2O per
hour to anybody using their ser
vice. The $20 minimum is to be en
forced by BePaid.
Like other services, you also get
money lor referrals. BePaid is plan
ning to release its product in the
next two months.

as e-mail and instant messaging,
through them as well.
I Ye been an All Advantage mem
ber since March of last year, and
have had nothing but good experi
ences with the company. Each
month I make $200 without break
ing a sweat.
When 1 visited sites of the other
companies, I expected to see well
organized companies and profes
sional looking Web sites. I was seri
ously disappointed by the majority
of them.
Most of the Web sites (Go
to World, Get Paid, Ignifiige, Cash-
Surfers, All Community, Money
For Mail, UtopiAD, It Ads Up) I vis
ited made me feel like a customer at
a used car lot. On Desktop Dollars'
home page, there were thirteen ex
clamation points. Thirteen!
They were pretty outdated too;
a few hadn't been updated since last

year. Many claimed they were on
the brink of releasing their view
bars, but didn't give a date.
When I checked their populari
ty ratings at PC Data Online, I
found out why these start-ups had
been slacking. All the companies
with the exception of two had risen
in popularity when All Advantage
made its first mass payments (Octo
ber/November of last year) and
quickly fallen back into oblivion
soon afterwards.
The two exceptions? All Adva
ntage (currently No. 16 Web proper
ty on the Internet, ahead of Real-
Networks, Ask Jeeves and kara's
Adult Playground) and
BePaid.com (currently No. 431
Web site).
While BePaid.com is ranked
eighth in unique visitors among
pay-for-surf Web sites, it is the only
one save .All Advantage that contin
ues to grow.
While the other companies have
small viewbars and a click through
rate of only 0.8 percent, BePaid
shows full screen ads and antici
pates a higher click through rate.
BePaid claims that its higher click
through rate will entice advertisers
to spend more per consumer view,
and enable BePaid to pay more to
its customers.
They claim that they will be able
to pay between $20 and SI2O per
hour to anybody using their ser
vice. The $20 minimum is to be en
forced by BePaid.
Like other services, you also get
money lor referrals. BePaid is plan
ning to release its product in the
next two months.
Zzzz... Oh sorry, 1 fell asleep for
a second there. I needed to pay the
phone bill.
