Through the millions of dollars
our nation spends on biomedical
research, it is evident that our hope
in improving the nation's health is
placed in the hands of bioniedic ine.
At Stanford, where new research
facilities are constantly under con
struction and the intensive biomed
ical curriculum is notorious, em
phasis on bioniedic ine is especially
apparent.
Yet, even with the increasing
dollars going into biomedical re
search, alternative medicine is also
increasing in popularity. Accord
ing to an article in the journal of the
Americ an Medical Association enti
tled "Trends in Alternative Medi
cine Use in the United States, 1990-
1997," there lias been a 47.3 per
cent total increase in the number of
visits to alternative medicine practi
tioners from 1990 to 1997.
I low is it possible that alternative
medicine is rising in popularity de
spite the strong influence and suc
cesses of biomedicine?

I here must be some component
of alternative medicine that makes
it appealing even in a highly bio
niedically advanced nation.
According to a local Chinese
herbalist, alternative medicine is
often better at treating long-term,
chronic problems such as aches and
pains, impotency or diabetes
whereas biomedicine is superior in
emergency situations.
Furthermore, alternative medi
cine is seen as a more natural way
toward healing, rather than aggres
sively destroying one's own body as
in surgery.
The philosophy behind the Chi
nese healing art has a lot to do with
the importance of harmony. Chi
nese medicine is a highly holisitic
approach to healing.
Rather than being concerned
only about a particular diseased
organ or part of the body as in bio
medicine, its main concern is the
functioning of each part in relation
to the whole.
Illness is caused by a greater im
balance in the whole system or bodv
clue to improper Qi flow. Qi can be
described as "vital energy" which
flows through the organs and chan
nels connected throughout the
be >dy.
When a channel is blocked and
(,)i cannot flow through, a symptom

results.
Thus, when a person is sick or
has a particular ailment, the Chi
nese healer does not simply treat a
particular symptom, but looks at
the illness as a disharmony of the
entire be>cly.
This holistic approach has been
with the Chinese for centuries. In
many cases, it has proven a success
ful method toward treating chronic
problems.
And with the increasing popu
larity oft his healing art, it is evident
that many people are starting to
recognize these qualities.
Although there are a few alter
native medicine practices located
around campus and some efforts to
explore the benefits of Chinese
medicine, biomedicine is still the
main focus at Stanford.
It is unquestionable that bio
medicine has had many great
achievements and is an important
investment in the future of our na
tion's health.
However, it is important that
our community also keeps an open
mind to other forms of medicine.
I he benefits of alternative medi
cine have only begun to be recog
nized, and perhaps the best treat
ments may be a combination of
both biomedical and alternative
medicine.
