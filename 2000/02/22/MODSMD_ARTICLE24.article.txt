# Action movies: rocket science for the rest of us
## 
### YAR WOO 
If life is like ;i box of chocolates, llien ac
tion movies are like a box ol Junior Mints —
you pretty much know what you're going to
get before you even open it.
In fact, it has been recently proven that
you can reduce all action movies released in
the last three years to diflerent combina
tions of the following elements:
a) Specially designed vehicles which,
when flipped over, immediately explode
(thus ensuring that the passengers inside
are unable to sue the auto manufacturer).
b) An elite cabal of international terror
ists, headed by . . .
c) I he embittered master c riminal, who
hates the hero for some personal reason.
d) An evil ninja who has spent years hon
ing his skills in some innovative, yet ridicu
lously stupid martial arts technique instead
of taking three minutes to learn how to
shoot a gun.
e) An ex-cop with a grudge.
I) At least one light scene aboard a mov
ing object of some sort.

g) One-line wisecracks delivered with
what can be charitably described as unfor
tunate timing.
h) A scene where a bomb or missile
launch is stopped in the nick of time, thus
preventing . ..
i) More explosions (add as necessary).
The great thing is that, with this discov
ery, poor students like you and me unable
to take out the second mortgage needed to
afford a movie can make our own ac tion
blockbusters by picking items randomly
from the list.
For example, (e) (i) (b) becomes:
jack Daniels was an ex-cop with a grudge —
three months earlier, his wife had been exploded fry
an elite calxd of international terrorists.
Likewise, (g) (d) (1) (a), in Action Speak,
translates roughly to:
"/ he/ . '<• this is your stop." yelled Jack as he
threw tin poison-spiked-yo-yo-wielding ninja
/row the gondola, which then promptly Jhppetl
over and exploded.
And (c) (h)? Kasy:
"/ killed your wife, and I'll kill yon too," said
jack's ex-partner-turned-cnminal-mastennind,

"I've had my blood replaced In nitroglycerin, and
I'm set to go off in five nannies."
Luckily, Jack managed to defuse the ex
plosive villain with three seconds to spare.
But it's still not the same as the real thing.
And so, for the next few weeks, I will be pay
ing tribute to that most-watchable of gen
res, the crappy action bloc kbuster. To kick
things off, I'll talk about one of the most
overused cliches in the action movie, and
that is bomb delusion.
In many a tension-filled Hollywood
scene, perspiring bomb squad members
work furiously as time tic ks clown to trace
the reel and blue wires from the explosive to
the bright LGD readout back to the explo
sive, then carefully select one and cut.
Apparently, all of this is not necessary,
because it eventually boils down to the fact
that whatever wire they snip is the right
one. I don't even know why they even both

uniforms.
What the hell is an eighth of an inch of
rubber going to do when two kilos of (14 ex

But I digress. I lie point is that this
method of bomb delusion is mostly bunk. I
did some research on the Internet about
how bombs are defused in the real world,
and it's actually quite interesting.
It turns out that terrorists and bomb
s(jua<ls are constantly trying to come up
with new ways to foil each other — many ol
today's bombs go lar beyond the simple
clock /dynamite / wire setup.
And the methods used to disable them?

the bomb casing. ()nce the water penetrates
