### PADMA SUNDARAM 
Welcome to the Global Village.
Population: 150,923,012.
You're a "Neti/en" and so am I.
I'm a typical Net user. I have a com
puter at home and at school. 1 have e
iii.nl — si\ accounts iu all. I belong to a
lew virtual communities. When I travel
out of town, I buy my tickets online. I
even have a favorite Web site (1 won't tell
\<>u which one). And I will only use
Map Quest to liud driving directions.
I keep track of the "Cyberguy," the
"1 )<>t( :<iin(>uv" and other intrepid trail
bla/ers on the e-commerce frontier. I
also dig up valuable information on
evervthing from research to the latest
Pull Daddy records. And yes, I will only
use (.oogle.
So maybe you don't want to admit to
this, i>ut I will. I love getting e-mail. Not
spam mail, but some clays, even that will
do. Reading the words "You have new
mail" is among the thrills of my day.
Maybe one <>l these days, they will
change the message to "You have new
mail, but you've got no life.
(iontinuelves/no)?". And that's line with
ine. I ley, I'm just another digital hippie
()kr And virtual life is important. More
important than the real one. Online I
can be anyone I s< > wish to be — a force
on Wall Street or in Hollywood. And I
don't e\en have to wear heels.
A sludv released last week by the
Stanford Institute for the Quantitative
Stud\ ol Society Ibuncl that the Net is
causing Americans to spend less time
with li lends and family.
I low true is this? People spend their

time doing lots of different tilings.
"Wired News" rebutted the findings
with a fake report from the Stanley Lotus
Institute of Farming that Americans who
have dogs spend the time with their dogs
instead of watching TV, surfing the Net,
visiting with friends and doing nothing.
So what is it that clogs do that their
friends can't? 1 don't think I want to an
swer that question.
Although "Wired's" report was
meant to merely ridicule the Stanford
survey, it does have a point. The Inter
net has connected and brought people
together in ways that were not possible
before.
It has become the buffet of a global
cultural smorgasbord. Money and cul
tural influence are now gushing away
from New York and Los Angeles toward
Bob and Jane sitting at their keyboards.
I\-commerce is a force to reckon with —
practically everything and everyone has
a Web site. The stock market has gone
mad with dotcom fever. And of course,
we can't forget singularities, such as live
Internet birth, the Internet virgins hoax
and the Starr report.
So really, what'sa nice person like you
doing on a Net like this? Read on . ..
squeegee_guy: "I spend all my time
on the Net. I use the Net for just about
everything, I don't know what I'd do
without it. I feel sorry for people that are
not on the Net. It really makes me angry.
Mow can people ignore technology? As
soon as I meet someone, I ask them, "Do
you like computers?" If they say no, I
don't talk to them. I love computers, I
want a smartcard and a c hip in my brain.
I want to have robotic eyes. 1 want to be
a walking Cyborg. II people can't under

stand, then they are just plain stupid."
little_drummer_boy: "I use the Net
to stalk squeegee_guy."
gold_horse77: "Posting my picture
on my Web site generated much of the e
mail in my In box. For one girl who vis
ited ni) Web page, it was love at first
site."
dark Tangent (sings):
"I'm sitting by the roadside
with nothing to do,
My modem is broken —
I got the super-highway blues."
gentle_Gloria: "I can party online.
During the day, these chat rooms are
deader than Fencing 101, but they come
alive at night. And yes, AsFastAsA Turtle
is my best friend."
AsFastAsATurtle: "I'm alive ever
since I died in 1989. Alvan, my pet, was
the first guinea pig in cyberspace."
purplePeanut69: "If you're a nerd or
a geek or a nutzoid art type, then ves, I
wany-to-chat."
So you're now busy chatting online
with say, "TopKapi" from Tokyo, and
you aren't even getting good financial
advice. You might be bored, and you
might visit dullmen.com and vote for
"Dull Man of the Year." And I'm sure
that you're not alone, at least when
you're online.
But sometimes you need a real hug,
not a virtual one. The chat rooms may be
full of people, and although purple-
Peanut 69 may offer you his cyber-shoul
der, sometimes that's just not good
enough.
