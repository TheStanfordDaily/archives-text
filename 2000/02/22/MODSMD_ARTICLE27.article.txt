# Netscape needs Mozilla
## 
### SALAS SARAIYA 
In 1994 Netscape made a drastic, unprece
dented move and allowed everyone to use its
browser for free. Netscape became the Inter
net's most popular browser, and Microsoft's In
ternet Explorer tried feebly to catch up.
In 1998 Netscape made another drastic un
precedented move and opened its source code
to the public. All proprietary code and licensing
code was removed, and the toned down brows
er changed its place of residence from Netscape
offices to the public domain.
The project was called Mozilla, and on the
day of the code release a party was held for
"freeing the lizard." Netscape's thinking was
that they would package the best features of
Mozilla, what hackers and Netscape engineers
could come up with, as Netscape 5.0. What,
you're still running Netscape 4.7? Yeah, me too.
Netscape figured that if programmers from
all over the world in addition to its own engi
neers got a chance to pick at the code from
Netscape4.s, it would outpace Microsoft Inter
net Explorer and retake the browser market.
Netscape released the code from version 4.7 as
well, adding it to the Mozilla project. I he sup
posed end-product, Netscape 5.0, is still not
ready to ship, and it may already be too late.
According to Zona Research, Netscape's
share of the browser market lias slipped from a
peak <»112 87 percent in 1996 to 36 percent in No
vember 1999. According to WebSideStory,
which analyzes traffic on small web pages in
cluding mine, the share of Netscape had
slipped to 25 percent as of August 1999.
In short, Netscape needs to make a huge
splash with version 5.0t0 reclaim its base. There
are still some proponents of Mozilla who still
think this is possible. Eric Krock, senior product
manager of Netscape Communicator, told l'( ]-
World in November 1999 that Netscape 5.0 will

be "groundbreaking." Krock said that
Netscape's estrangement from the popular
Windows platform is less important than its ag
gressive adoption of World Wide Web Consor
tium standards, because the Internet is not
based on a platform.
The new Netscape is rumored to be about
half the size of former versions, which should
make the new software significantly faster.
Technology developed by the Mozilla project, is
at the heart of this improvement.
Some maintain that the new Netscape is des
tined to be a failure, however. Wired News Ser
vice named Netscape 5.0 the third biggest fail
ure of 1999.
By several accounts, the real reason Mozilla
failed to come out on time was not because of a
faulty open-source model but because of mis
management.
()neof the kev leaders of the Mozilla project,
Jamie Zawinski quit his job 011 April 1, 1999. Ac
cording to Wired, he called the Mozilla project
a "failure" and added that Netscape had had
trouble convincing people outside the organi
zation to help out on the project.
Zawinski also told Wired that more time
should have been invested in the Mozilla tech
nology rather than wasting time 011 releasing
Netscape 4.5. 1 le called this, "not even so much
an excuse as a stupid, terrible mistake."
Adding to the confusion behind the Mozilla
project was America Online's November 1998
acquisition of Netscape. The buyout led to 850
firings, 425 from each parent company.
There was initially some question over
whether AOL would choose to keep or to dis
mantle the project. In the end, AOL decided it
would let its Netscape branch sink or swim with
the success of Mozilla.
I lopefully for AOL, the gamble will pay off.
Otherwise, Mozilla may become known as the
lizard that drowned Netscape.
