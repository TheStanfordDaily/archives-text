digmatic sliili toward post-literacy.
In ordci to come to terms with this
new condition ol post-literai\ and to bet
ter understand how technology is facili
tating such i hange. one must first define

and deconstruct the 'literacy' from which
il is escaping.
I rom the Latin for'letter'-littera-liter
acy ranges in definition from simply the
capacity to read and write to the more
specific idea ol skilllulness in an area of
specialty. Among its synonyms listed by
Roget are 'culture/ 'intellectuality' and,
more obviously, 'book learning.' This list,
when viewed from the tight perspective,
highlights the essence of the term litera
cy/
First, ii allows for the realization that
the understood relationship between
'book learning' and 'intellectuality' is
indelibh branded into literate minds.
I hough il is objectively conceivable
that one might be illiterate and learned,
unable to read yet able to think, these
qualities seem — to the literate — at
< )dds.
Indeed, some have begun to abscond
from such stereotypical visions ol erudi
tion and are turning toward 'unconven
tional/ ancient sources for wisdom sue l,i
as Kastern and Native American schools
oI thought. I liese folks are not necessari
ly counter examples to the development
ol post-literacy, but rather are individuals
taking ,i reactionan siep back from the
slippery slope ol serious change.
Second, ii brings out the literal ties be
tween the book, as the primal) medium
for communication of ideas, and the con
cept ol knowledge inherent in book-inlel
lectuality, or 'literacy.' I wo observations
must be brought up to fully appreciate
the impact ol these lies on society.
One is thai there is a distinctive and

fundamental linearity to reading and
writing, a one-dimensionality they can
not escape. Further, this linearity is al
ways constructionist — each previous
piece builds upon other previous pieces
to eventually form a whole.
These characteristics become clear
upon dissection of any piece of prose.
Kach begins with a first character. Other
characters follow, which, when put to
gether in the order of construction, form
a word. One word follows another until
they complete a thought, a sentence. Sen
tences lit end to end to form paragraphs,
and the linear progression continues
until the work reaches its conclusion. (If
you do not yet believe in the absolute lin
earity of books, or at least of written text
— the mediate analog ol the book-simply
attempt to make sense of any sentence in
this article by starting at a random c har
acter, in a random word, and proceeding
in any direction but forward.)
I he second necessary observation is in
Marshall McLuhan's statement that "the
medium is the- message." Again, this point
is non-obvious but crucial: it ties the lin
earity ol reading and writing to the lin
earity of literacy, and hence of literate
thought.
All Ibrms of communication, methods
ol the transfer of ideas from one individ
ual to another, involve a medium. In
deed, distinct types of communication
are distinguished based upon their
media.
l or example, there is a physical con
duit lor the information as one brain
sends it through space to another. It is

part of the medium. Also a part of the
medium is the type of representation lor
the information, be it through language
(spoken or written), or through a more
abstract grammar. Nearly the only part of
the communication th.it is not mediate is
the content.
As an illustration, a television commer
cial involving prominent athletes speak
ing on the success of Pepsi 1 Nl in quench
ing their thirst might be a communication
of the idea that Pepsi™ is a refreshing
beverage.
The idea that Pepsi' 1 M is refreshing is
content. The qualities of the television,
the qualities of the background music in
the commercial and any qualities associ
ated with the communication of the ath
letes (such as speech-pattern and other
non-verbal < ties) are the medium for this
idea. ()f course, there may be several lev
els of communication in ibis one com
mercial, but the idea that Pepsi 1 Nl is re
freshing is the chosen content in this ex
ample, around which everything else is
medium.
McTuhan argues that the real mes
sage, or the lasting impression of any
communication on its target, is not the
content but the medium. I lis 'message' is
the elled of any single communication
event on an individual's future percep
tions, or, to the structure of his or her
thought process.
I o accept this claim completely may be
difficult. But ii need only be partially ac
cepted — to the extent th.it the medium
of a message contributes to an individ
ual's thought structure — to make the
