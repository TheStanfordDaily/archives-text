surprising connection between the dras
tic development of communications tools
and projections of as â€” drastic reorgani
zations of thought structure among par
ticipating individuals.
In the case of literate media, those with
a specific basis in reading and writing, as
well as speech as a medium, the overrid
ing characteristic is linearity. This linear
ity hard-wires a one-dimensional,
cause/effect, uni-directional construc
tionist structure of thought. Literacy.
Today, advances in technology have
made commonplace the multi-media
communication pair of video camera and
television. Emerging tools, such as Inter
net web pages and virtual reality, literally
span new dimension(s) as communica
tion media. This dimensionality empha
sizes an integrating, correlating, associat
ing and connecting structure of thought.
Post-literacy.
This is not to say that literate minds do
not harbor robust thoughts. It has long
Ik-cm stated that 'a picture is worth a thou
sand words.' The difference is that tech
nology now allows individuals the medi
ate bandwidth to communicate with such
pictures in a meaningful and integrated
way. As always, a wider bandwidth re
quires more power, but the price of direct
expression carries exciting rewards. It is
worth it.
