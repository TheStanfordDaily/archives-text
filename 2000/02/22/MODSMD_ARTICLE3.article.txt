# This spring's Draw brings few changes
## Freshman / Sophomore College now 'priority' 
### EILEEN CHAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite the recent turnover of
leadership in Housing Assignment
Services, this spring's Draw will
bring few changes besides the addi
tion of slots for Freshman / Sopho
more College.
This year, former Freshman /
Sophomore College director Todd
Benson replaced Kathleen Brans
field as manager of Housing .As
signment Services.
Benson, who most recently
served as associate director of ad
vising at the School of Medicine,
plans to get a feel for student needs
before he implements any changes
in the spring housing lottery.
"My main goal will be to listen to
students in order to gain an under
standing of the different student
perspectives on the strengths and
weaknesses of the current Draw
system," Benson said.
Housing Assignment Services is
now evaluating all the houses for
which students must use one of
their "priority" years.
"There are criteria that need to
be completed in order to be a
house of 'priority,' " said Under
graduate Housing Assignment Su
pervisor John Judicki. "We send
out requests to all houses of'prior
ity' to review the criteria of these
houses. They all have the ability to
redefine their criteria without
changing their [main themes]."

"Priority" houses include theme
houses, Creek houses and Sopho
more College.
This year, Freshman / Sopho
more College was added to the list
of "priority" housing. Still in its
debut year, the college currently
has no Draw program, but Hous
ing Assignment Services is working
with Freshman / Sophomore Col
lege administrators to come up
with a feasible plan.
"We had to come up with a sys
tem because we need to know
which freshmen want to stay next
year," said Freshman / Sophomore
College Assistant Dean Marina Bo
nanno. "This way we know how
many open spaces we have for
other incoming sophomores who
want to live at the college."
Freshman / Sophomore Col
lege administrators will consult
Housing Assignment Services as
they develop a plan for this spring's
Draw.
"They came to us with a specific
proposal to ask what's workable for
Housing and Dining Services," Ju
dicki said. "We explained how
other processes with 'priority' and
Creek housing work and they went
back to work out the proposal."
According to Judicki, the group
will meet again in early March to
work out the details. But Bonanno
already knows the basics of the new
system.
"It will be similar to the Creek
form," Bonanno said. "If [fiesli
inenj students choose to stay, they
won't have to go into the Draw, but
