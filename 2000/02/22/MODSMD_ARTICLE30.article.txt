# Fight crickets, fight!

### NINA CANN-WOODE 
Cricket fighting has been a fa
vorite pastime in China for cen
turies.
I he insects — usually two ag
gressive males — are pitted against
each other in a fierce battle of
brawn. At the end of one round,
one cricket is proclaimed victori
ous and profits from bets made
during the fight are rendered to
the winner's trainer.
However, after time, trainers
discovered that loser crickets
avoided aggressive encounters
with all other crickets and refused
to fight for approximately 24
hours after their defeat.
This presented a difficulty for
the trainers, who wanted their in
sects ready to fight again immedi
ately.
Techniques to restore the ag
gressive spirit within crickets were
tried and tested. According to an
cient Chinese folklore, one
method worked: if a defeated
cricket was shaken in clasped
hands, thrown in the air and
caught several times, it would re
gain its fighting spirit.
Now Hans A. Hofmann, a post
doctoral researcher in the Stan
ford Department of Psychology,
has found evidence that this mvth

ical technique has a scientific ex
planation.
He, along with co-author Paul
A. Stevenson, reported his find
ings in the Feb. 10 issue of Nature
magazine.
"It is not fully understood what
makes animals aggressive," wrote
Hofmann and Stevenson, "al
though ancient Chinese gamblers,
betting fortunes on the outcome of
cricket fights, seemed to know a
few tricks.
"Inspired by their age-old wis
dom, we found that we could com
pletely restore aggressiveness in
defeated subordinate crickets sim
ply by activating their motor pro
gram for flying."
Hoffman and Stevenson con
ducted their research at the Uni
versity of Leipzig in Germany.
They constructed a miniature area
to stage lighting matches between
male Mediterranean field crickets
(Gryllus bimaculatus De Geer).
"I had been interested in the
general behavior of crickets for
some time," said Hofmann. "They
have much less complicated struc
tures than vertebrates and can also
serve as models in the study of neu
rotransmitters such as dopamine
and seratonin, which plays a role in
regulating mood."
Typically, in a cricket wrestling
match, the two insects "initially

fence with their antennae and then
display spread mandibles [jaws]
which later interlock before the an
imals finally wrestle," wrote Hof
mann and Stevenson in Nature.
"The contest can be stopped at
any level by one animal retreat
ing"
The retreating cricket is
deemed the loser and sulks away
while the winning cricket strums a
victory song with his legs.
At this point in the experiment,
the two researchers put the ancient
solution — which Hofmann found
only after an exhaustive review of
Classical Chinese literature — to
an objective test.
"No one believed that shaking
and catching a cricket would work
to restore aggressiveness!" said
Hofmann. "I myself thought it was
only superstition, but as I read
more I became more interested in
finding a possible scientific
grounding."
And indeed there was. Nearly
57 percent of the losing crickets re
gained their original aggressive
ness after being shaken and
thrown in the air.
But the next question that the
researchers wanted to answer was
whether the shaking or the tossing
was changing the crickets' behav
ior.
In order to find out. Hofmann

and Stevenson tried simply tum
bling the loser crickets around in a
rotating tube, but this had no effect
because the crickets still refused to
fight.
To test the effects of being
thrown in the air, losers were sus
pended on a wire and placed in a
small wind tunnel, where they had
no choice but to fly.
The results were dramatic: four
out of five defeated crickets re
turned to the arena leady to fight
their opponent in another match.
Hofmann and Stevenson thus
surmised that shaking the cricket
had 110 real effect and that tossing
it up in the air only worked if the
insect had the opportunity to fly
for at least a few seconds.
"The effect of flight on aggres
sion was independent of its dura
tion," Hoffman and Stevenson
wrote in Nature. "A 10-second
flight was as effective as a 15-
minute flight, and the influence of
a one-minute flight was still evi
dent hours later.
"Furthermore, the flight treat
ment could be repeated many
times, whenever an animal lost,
without losing its effectiveness."
A closer look at t he anatomy of a
cricket reveals the key to why it
changes its behavior after being
able to fly.
"The brain is the source of ag-

gressive behavior but the
command to fly comes
from an electrical signal
received from a nerve in
the cricket's thorax, or
chest area," said Hoff man.
"We found that when
we cut the nerves connect
ing tht* thorax to the brain
of a defeated cricket, the
animal was still able to fly
but flight did not restore
its willingness to fight."
This indicates that the
very act of flying releases a
neurotransmitter or some
other chemical sigtial that
directs the brain to restore
the cricket's aggressive
ness.
The finding in the
study of crickets has po
tential ramifications in the
research of human de
pression. Studies have
shown that sleep-de
prived patients suffering

from depression experience a feel
ing of euphoria after a period of
time.
But according to I lofmann, this
may not be the best therapy.
"After a time, patients will be
come very ill or die from lack of
sleep. And also, when they sleep,
their symptoms come back. The
important question is this: what

were the patients doing when they
weren't sleeping?
"Perhaps the motor activity
they were involved in at the time
induced their euphoric symptoms.
Perhaps we could then come up
with some sort of exercise program
for depressed patients that would
produce the same results," states
Hofmann.
