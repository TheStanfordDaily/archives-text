# New reproductive technologies give parents more choice in 'designing' future children

"As long as it's healthy." That's
what an expecting couple typically
hopes for of their unborn child.
Now, though, they may have
greater control over the roll of the
dice when it comes to determining
the characteristics of their off
spring.
Often, patients who turn to in
fertility clinics do so as a last re
sort. They feel a lack of control
when it comes to family planning.
But in reality, assisted repro
ductive technology offers more
choices compared to those associ
ated with natural conception.
Beyond helping to establish preg
nancies, it can also help to analyze
and manipulate the unborn.
One of the technologies avail
able at infertility clinics is called
blastocyst transfer. Although it's
not yet helping parents conceive
what they might perceive as their
"perfect" child, it has the potential
to do so.
"The big breakthrough hap
pened when 1 developed this new
medium to grow embryos out of
the body longer than they typical
ly were able to be grown success
fully," says Barry Behr, director
of the In Vitro Fertilization / As
sisted Reproductive Technology
laboratories at Stanford.
Behr's group developed blas
tocyst transfer, through which
fertilized embryos are grown for

five days — to the blastocyst stage
of development — before trans
fer to the woman's uterus.
Normally, embryos could not
be kept alive for more than three
days in the laboratory.
When three-day old embryos
are used, doctors transfer multi
ple embryos, hoping that one will
be healthy enough to implant
and develop into a baby.
Unfortunately, this can lead to
multiple births. These situations
can create high-risk pregnancies,
the need for selective reduction
of fetuses and the delivery of pre
mature infants.
"The major benefit right now
[of blastocyst transfer] is in the
enhanced ability to select viable
embryos," Behr says. "By devel
oping a system to keep embryos
alive longer, we eliminate the
ones that definitely won't make a
baby."
Using blastocyst tranfer, fewer
embryos need to be transferred
to the woman's uterus in order to
establish pregnancy.
"It was my area of interest to
try to develop a system to grow
human blastocysts in a chemically
defined medium," says Behr.
"The big breakthrough was
the development of the medium,
and now that we're able to grow
the embryos, our current re
search is more clinical."
They plan to look at which pa
tients and applications are best

suited for this technology.
Blastocyst transfer does not
allow a couple to pick out the very
best embryo of the batch that sur
vives for five days in culture,
though. When it comes to assess
ing the quality of the blastocysts,
Behr says, "1 believe that is very
subjective."
But there are other technolo
gies that can allow potential par
ents greater selection options.
One such technology, called Mi
crosort, has been offered for sev
eral years now.
Developed by The Genetic
and IVF Institute in Virginia, Mi
cro Sort separates X and V sperm
cells before fertilization. If a cou
ple wants to have a girl, the man's
X sperm cells are collected and
used to fertilize the woman's egg.
This technology is offered to pa
tients who are at risk of passing on
sex-linked diseases as well as to pa
tients who seek "family balance."
For family balancing, selection
is offered only "for the gender
found in less than 50 percent of
the children of the family," ac
cording to the institute's Web
site.
Microsorting involves selection
of a particular sex by separating
the X sperm and Y sperm before
fertilization. Other technologies
can look at the sex of the actual
embryo (after fertilization).
One of these techniques is
called Pre-implantation Genetic

Diagnosis. Behr's blastocyst sys
tem will make PCi 1) more useful
and reliable. Current PCD in
volves removing a few cells from
the embryo at the three-day stage.
When done at the blastocyst
stage, embryos are larger and less
damaged when the cells are taken
away.
Behr stated that, "It's only a
matter of time before some pro
grams will offer [PCD for family
balancing] to patients — probably
not a university program or an
academic center, but certainly it
wouldn't surprise me to see some
private practitioner offering it."
PCD can also be used to check
for disease-causing genes and
perhaps for genes determining
other traits as well.
Technologies such as blasto
cyst transfer, Micro Sorting and
Pre-implantation Genetic Diag
nosis will provide increasingly
greater selection options con
cerning characteristics of the un
born.
And of course the choices be
come even greater when a couple
uses someone else's eggs or
sperm.

fered $100,000 for the donated
eggs of an athletic woman.
Technology is continuing to
expand options for people who
are willing to go to great lengths
in an attempt to select their chil
dren's traits.
