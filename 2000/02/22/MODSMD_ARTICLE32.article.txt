## Hoops storms to No.1 ranking Stanford routs Cal, climbs to top of polls after Cincinnati falls 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
If Stanford wanted to send a message, Satur
day's 101 -50 win over California at Maples Pavil
ion might have done the trick.
With a rematch against Pacific 10 Conference
rival Arizona on the hori/on March 9 and the
NCAA Tournament just a few weeks down the
road, Stanford looked unstoppable, rolling to its
biggest conference win in history.
Combined with Cincinnati's loss to Temple
on Sunday, the win gave the Cardinal (22-1, 11-
1 Pac-10) the No. 1 ranking in both major polls.
Though Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery and Cal's Ben Braun emphasized that
the overwhelming final score was a bit of a fluke,
Stanford's complete domination could not be
overlooked.
The Cardinal outshot, outrebounded, out
passed, outhustled and outthought the over
matched Colden Bears (14-10, 5-7) in what has
become an increasingly lopsided series. Stanford
has won the last seven against Cal.
"Well, that was pretty good," Montgomery
said in his usual understated tone. "We can't play
a whole lot better than that."
T hat's probably true. The Cardinal shot al
most 65 percent 112 rom the field and hit 50 percent
of its three-point shots. Five Stanford players
scored in double figures as the team piled up 2(5
assists and outrebounded Cal by 15.
On the other side of the ball, Stanford's statis

tics were just as impressive. T he nation's top
rated defense held the Colden Bears to 33 per
cent shooting and allowed only one player to
score in double figures â€” star forward Sean
Lampley, who finished with 10 points, all in the
first half. Cal finished with more turnovers (20)
than made field goals (18).
But senior guard David Moseley, who blis
tered Cal for a career-high 28 points in a shock
ingly efficient performance, refused to admit
that Stanford, now in the midst of a 10-game
winning streak, had maxed out its potential.
"If we could do this every night, it'd be fun,"
he said. But, "we're not even close to where we
want to be."
Where Stanford really wants to be is in Indi
anapolis, the site of this year's Final Four, wear
ing freshly printed t-shirts and hats proclaiming
the Cardinal national champs. As the team has
reiterated throughout the year, its first goal is to
defend its Pac-10 championship. Its second is to
be the last team standing after March Madness
comes to a frenetic close.
The Cardinal could accomplish goal No. 1 by
winning its remaining six games, including the
rematch with Arizona (22-4,12-1). That March 9
contest looms larger every day as the fourth
ranked Wildcats continue to keep pace. As Stan
ford lias rolled through the Pac-10, beating op
ponents by an average of more than 22 points, it
looks like Arizona might be the only team capa
ble of putting up a fight against the bruising C Car
dinal.
But Montgomery wants no part in looking
forward to the Arizona game, at least publicly.
"That game will take care of itself," he said. "If
we stumble along the way, it loses its meaning. It
doesn't do any good to think about it."

T hat philosophy has apparently spread
throughout the team. Stanford has completely
avoided the letdowns that have plagued the Car
dinal in past years.
In fact, Stanford has appeared to elevate its
game as the season winds down. Where past
teams have played down to an opponent's level,
Stanlord is now playing like its only opponent is
its own high standard of expectation.
In Saturday's game for example, Stanford
held a slim 17-14 lead almost midway through
the first half. California is a young but strong
team that looked ready to avenge the Cardinal's
11-point win at Berkeley a month ago.
But a jarring 25-4 run over the following
seven minutes killed any chances Cal had to stay
in the game. Moseley, who hit 10-of-12 shots and
3-of-4 free throws, keyed the spurt with 14
points.
After taking a 27-point lead into the locker
room at halftime, the Cardinal was not ready to
stop.
Senior Mark Madsen broke out, scoringStan
fbrd's first six points of the second half and
recording a quick steal in the first minute back on
the floor. Then Moseley began where he left off,
hitting a three-pointer and slicing through the
lane to throw down a ferocious follow-up dunk.
Three minutes later, a three-pointer from
freshman Casey Jacobsen gave Stanford a 40-
point lead. Seven minutes alter that, an authori
tative slam by redsliirt freshman Jason Collins
pushed the lead over 50 points.
While the Colden Bears came into Maples
Pavilion looking for an upset to bolster their
chances at getting into the tournament, they left

the low post, scoring 13 points and grabbing 10 rebounds.
