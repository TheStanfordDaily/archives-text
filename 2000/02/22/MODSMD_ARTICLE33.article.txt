# Pass-catcher Davis drops out of school
## 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
Another integral part of Stan
ford's vaunted passing attack
might not be returning next year
to help the Cardinal defend its
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onship.
Todd Husak, Deßonnie Pitts
and consensus All-American
Troy Walters were supposed to
be gone — all have used up their
four years of elgibility in fine fash
ion. But the future of Dave Davis,
an athletic wide receiver who was
to be a showcase player in Stan
ford's offense next fall, is now up
in the air.
Athletic Department officials
have confirmed that Davis, a red
shirt sophomore from Syracuse,
N.Y., with two more seasons ofel
gibility remaining, is no longer
enrolled at Stanford and is in

stead taking classes at Menlo C Col
lege, a Division 111 school in
nearby Atherton.
In accordance with school and
N(IAA regulations, Davis must
complete the academic semester
at Menlo, which ends May 5, and
then petition to return to Stan
ford, meaning Davis is inelgible
to participate in spring practice.
However because he has re
mained in the area, it appears lie
will try to return to the Farm
when that option becomes avail
able.
Though Stanford is barred by
law from releasing any academic
information, the athletic depart
ment source did indicate acade
mic difficulties likely led to Davis'
departure.
Davis emerged two years ago
as a solid third receiver behind
Walters and Pitts, catching 48 pass
es for 707 yards and six touch
downs.
Ixist fall Davis was still a crucial,
if often underrated, member of
the nation's lOth-ranked passing
offense which led Stanford to its
first Rose Bowl since 1972.
Davis and Stanford head coach
Tyrone Willingham were both un
available for comment.
