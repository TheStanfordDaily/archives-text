BKRKELEY â€” The Cardinal
women's basketball team (16-0, 8-3
Pacific 10 Conference) ousted Cali
fornia (7-17, 2-10) 81-56 Friday at
Haas Pavilion, to move into a three
way tie for first place in the tight Pac
-10 race.
It was a genuine team effort for
Stanford. All 11 players on the ros
ter scored, and four were in double
figures.
"It was great to see some of our
other players playing really well,"
said senior guard Milena Flores.
Flores, who is averaging 37.3
minutes per game, saw some rare
moments on the bench after leading
the Cardinal with 15 points and five
assists.
The Cardinal started slowly at
I laas , committing five turnovers in
the opening five minutes. Powered
by the play of junior forward Sarah
Dimson, Stanford got a much need
ed offensive spark. Dimson came off
the bench and within minutes ignit-

Ed the game with two three-point
plays. She continued her domina
tion, scoring all 10 of her points in
the first half" and grabbing six re
bounds to contribute to a 16-2 Sum
ford run.
"I don't think my role matters at
all," Dimson said about coming oil
the bench. "Whatever it takes to
help the team I will be more than
willing to do it."
But Dimson's run didn't put the
Golden Bears down for good. They
mounted a 12-2 run of their own to
come within two of the Cardinal.
However, Stanford's consistent
perimeter shot came through on
the stretch, as lx>th freshman Jamie
Carey and sophomore Lauren St.
Clair hit threes before halftime,
sending Cal into the l<x:ker room
down 40-32.
Hie second half was all Cardinal.
Carey and Flores combined for 12
points in the opening five minutes
of the half, accounting for a large
part of the 14-2 run that put Stan
fold ahead by 20 and ending any
hopes ofaCal victoiy.
Carey continued her stellar
freshman year, increasing her
three-point percentage to 47.9 by
hitting 4 of 7 from downtown before
sitting down for the last 13 minutes
of regulation.
"They were just on transition,"
she said. "1 kind of spotted up and
hit them."

"She has the greenest of green
lights from out there," head coach
Tara VanDerveer said of Carey.
However, while three-point
shooting was definitely a Cardinal
strength, Stanford went a relatively
low 40 percent from behind the arc,
compared to the 47.3 percent it has
averaged in its previous 13 games.
Dimson, Junior Carolyn M<x>s and
sophomore Lindsey Yamasaki con
tributed in the fronctourt. M<xxs had
11 points and Yamasaki added
nine.
For the Colden Bears, center
Shavaki Jackson led the way with 19

points and nine rebounds. Senior
Paige Bowie chipped in 11 points.
The Cardinal victory marks its
14th straight win over arch-rival
California.
"It feels pretty good to be unde
feated against any team, particularly
your cross-Bay rival," said Flores,
after going 8-0 against the Colden
Bears in her career.
The win causes the Cardinal to
look ahead to the remainder of its
Pac-10 season, and to the NCAA
tournament. Currently Stanford is
tied at 9-3 in the Pac-10 with ()regon
and UCLA. Arizona (ell a half a

game behind at 9-4 after losing to
UCLA Saturday. In the close con
ference race, it will Ix* difficult for
any Pac-10 team to secure a first
and second-round hosting site for
the NCAA tournament.
"I think a team in the Pac-10, to
get a home bid, would have to win
the championship outright," said
VanDerveer of her team's chances
for a home-court advantage. "If it
were today? No."
Right now the Cardinal is focus
ing on its two games against the
Washington schools this week at
Maples.
