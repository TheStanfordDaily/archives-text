# Tennis captures another indoor title
## After squeezing past Georgia, women blank California to take fifth straight team championship 
### BILL HANSON STAFF WRITER 
Heading into this past weekend, the Cardi
nal women's tennis team boasted 25 straight
match wins, its most recent loss coming against
California last March.
Thus, a lot was on the line this weekend at the

2000 I'STA/n ANational Team Indoor Cham
pionships held at the University of Wisconsin in
Madison, Wis.
Ihe Cardinal needed to win the tourna
ment, which features the nation's top teams, in
order to maintain its unblemished record.
And win it did, boosting its streak to 29
straight.
Not only did Stanford win the tournament, it
exacted revenge over Cal with a dominating 8-
0 victory in the tournament final.
While the final was a blow-out, the Cardinal's
path to the title was ridden with obstacles.

Every team participating in the tournament
was forced to adjust to an experimental scoring
format in which the three doubles matches are
played before, rather than after, the six singles
matches. Under the complicated new format, a
2-1 lead after doubles counts for a 1-0 lead
heading into singles play, while a 3-0 doubles
triumph translates into a 2-0 lead.
Stanford had no trouble on Thursday in its
first-round match against 14th-ranked South
Carolina. After taking all three doubles matches
and mounting a 2-0 lead, the Car
dinal promptly swept all six singles
matches in straight sets.
The Cardinal's quarterfinal vic
tim, however, 17th-ranked Notre
Dame, mounted greater resis
tance. Notre Dame's duo of
Michelle Dassoand Becky Varnum
upset Stanford's Teryn Ashley and
Marissa Irvin in the No. I doubles
match, and Stanford, which won
the other two doubles encounters,
took a precarious 1-0 lead into sin
gles play.
While Stanford's rookies made
quick work of their singles oppo
nents, its senior veterans strug
gled. Senior Ashley was routed by
Notre Dame's Kelly Zalinski in
the No. 3 singles match, while se
nior Jennifer Heisei was toppled
by Kim Guy, 7-0 (9-7), 7-5, at No.
6.
Ashley, the team captain who
has been ranked as high as fourth

in the nation, has been struggling
with erratic play this season while
recovering 112 rom persistent tendini
tis in her wrist.
Although Ashley suffered some
surprising losses over the weekend,
she also posted some convincing
victories, indicating that she may
be regaining her championship
form.
On Saturday, Stanford faced
fourth-ranked Georgia in what
proved to be one of the tourna
ment's most tense encounters.
A 2-1 victory in doubles gave the
Cardinal a 1-0 lead heading into
singles play.
Again, Stanford's young stars
shined while its more experienced
players faltered.
In the No. 1 singles match,
sophomore Irvin topped (Georgia's
Aarthi Venkatesan, 6-1, 7-5.
At No. 99, Irvin is currently the
highest-ranked amateur on the
Women's Tennis Association l our,
having posted several impressive
results while participating in pro
fessional competition over the past
few months.
In January, Irvin upset 35th

ranked Corina Morariu in the
first round of the Australian Open
in Melbourne, Australia, before
succumbing to eventual champi
on Lindsay Davenport in the sec
ond round. Three weeks ago,
I rvin captured her second profes
sional title at the $35,000 Chal
lenger tournament in Clearwater,
Fla.
Although I rvin came to Madi
son without a collegiate ranking,
her strong weekend showing will
likely earn her a place among the
nation's elite in the next Intercolle
giate Tennis Association's rankings
report.
"I think Marissa is the best play
er in the country," said head coach
Frank Brennan. "She's got a lot of
confidence going for her light
now. I'm expecting her to win.
She's got a lot of good stuff."
Freshman Laura Granville was
equally impressive at No. 2 singles,
dismantling Georgia's Marissa
Catlin, 6-1,6-1.
Granville, who won the presti
gious Rolex National Intercolle
giate Indoor Championships, the
third leg of the collegiate Grand

Slam, in early February, has
launched a precocious debut cam
paign.
At No. 2, she is currently the na
tion's highest-ranked freshman.
She sports a 26-2 singles record.
"Granville is such a rock," Bren
nan said after the match. "She's so
good. She just destroyed a really
good player today. Catlin is a very
good player and (Laura) just
played her so tough."
Ashley, Heiser and sophomore
Kalvaria all dropped their
respective singles matches, but
sophomore Gabriela Lastra won
easily at No. 5 to secure the 4-3 vic
tory.
Sunday's final against California
was somewhat anticlimactic. After
the narrow victory over Georgia,
however, the players were content
with an easy, uneventful match.
Stanford swept both doubles
and singles in carving out the 8-0
victory.
The Cardinal looks for wins No.
30 and 31 this weekend as it takes
on the UNLV Runnin' Rebels on
Friday and has a rematch with Cal
ifornia on Saturday.
