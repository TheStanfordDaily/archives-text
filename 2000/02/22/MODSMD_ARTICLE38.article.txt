## Record crowd watches pitchers hold off Hornets in Sacramento 
### BRETT KAUFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sophomore reliever Mike
Gosling held off a two-out Sacra
mento State rally in the bottom of
the ninth inning to preserve a 4-2
victory for the second-ranked Car
dinal over the unranked Hornets
yesterday in a nonconference road
game.
Gosling mowed through the
Hornet lineup for three innings of
strong relief, but ran into trouble
in the ninth while sitting on a 4-2
lead. He retired the first two bat
ters before facing senior Jesse
Krebs, who struck out swinging
but reached first base on a
dropped third strike.
Visibly shaken from the lost op
portunity to shut the door on the
Hornets, Gosling threw a wild
pitch and then walked the next two
batters to load the bases. Head
coach Mark Marquess elected to
stay with the left-hander, allowing
him to face pinch-hitting junior
Mike Bender. Gosling induced a
game-ending ground ball back to
the mound and walked oil the field
unscathed by the last-ditch Sacra
mento State effort.
"The control problem was def
initely more mental than physi
cal," Gosling told KZSU radio
after the game. "I'll learn from
that. Hopefully, it will never hap
pen again."
A dynamite offensive showing
from senior John Gall and a solid
starting pitching performance
from sophomore starter Jason
Luker also carried Stanford over
the Hornets in front of a Hornet
Field-record crowd of 821.
Gall scored once and drove in
two runs against the Hornet
starter, left-handed junior Joey
Robinson, in the first three innings
to help Stanford collect the victory.
The Cardinal third baseman is rel

ishing his new cleanup spot in the
lineup, batting .500 with five RBIs
since Marquess swapped him and
junior right fielder Joe Borchard
over the weekend.
His second-inning double
gave him 59 career two-base hits,
placing him third among career
leaders on the Stanford doubles
list and leaving him only eight shy
of Troy Paulsen for the all-time
lead.
Luker lasted five innings in his
first start of the season to pick up
the win, but struggled early with
his control. He hit the first batter of
the game, junior Aurelio Jackson,
with a curve ball and began to let
his pitches stay up in the strike
zone early.
However, the solid Cardinal de
fense that has been a hallmark of
the squad this season picked up
Luker's slack in the first. Gall field
ed a ground ball and threw to se
nior Craig Thompson at first, who
tossed it back across the diamond
to senior shortstop Eric Bruntlett
at third to tag a sliding Jackson for
the double play.
Later in the inning, Borchard
threw from right field to the cutoff
man, sophomore second baseman
Chris O'Riordan, who perfectly re
layed the ball home to erase a
would-be Hornet run.
The Cardinal, which never
trailed, got started with an RBI sin
gle from Borchard in the second.
Borchard has struggled of late,
prompting his slide from fourth to
fifth in the lineup, but was much
more patient at the plate yesterday
than he had been this season.
In the sixth, Marquess lifted
Luker with a 3-2 lead for Gosling,
who has been the most consistent
pitcher out of the Stanford bullpen
this season. His 16.1 innings of re
lief work and 20 strikeouts lead the
Cardinal pen, and yesterday's per
formance dropped his earned-run
average below 1.70.
Stanford takes the remainder of
the week off before traveling across
the bay to face rival California for
three nonconference games at
Evans Diamond.
