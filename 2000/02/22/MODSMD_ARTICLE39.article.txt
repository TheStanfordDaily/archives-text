# Baseball splits with Texas
## 
### TIM KANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At least for one game, the
slumbering bats of the Stanford
baseball team came awake.
The Cardinal scored eight
runs against Texas on Friday
night for an 8-2 win over the
Longhorns in the first game of a
three-game series at Sunken Dia
mond, although the offense sput
tered again on Saturday in a 3-2
loss in the second game. The
third game was rained out on
Sunday afternoon, leaving Stan
ford with a split of two games with
Texas.
"We need to pick it up a lot
more offensively," Stanford base
ball head coach Mark Marquess
had said following a dreadful se
ries against Florida State that saw
the Cardinal average less than
four runs for the three games.
That isn't much for a Stanford
lineup stacked with power hitters
such as Joe Borchard, Edmund
Muth and John Gall.
Taking the coach's words to
heart, the Cardinal exploded for
13 hits on Friday night, led by the
smoking bat of senior first base
man Craig Thompson, who got
the first four-hit game of his ca
reer while hitting his team-lead
ing third home run and scoring
three runs.
On the mound, junior Justin
Wayne moved into Jason
Young's spot in the rotation and
pitched easily the best game of
the year for the Cardinal, going
the distance for the win while al
lowing only two runs, three hits
and striking out 12 batters.
Wayne improved his career
record on the Farm to 19-1, ac
counting for the best winning
percentage in Stanford history.
"It's not something I really
think about," Wayne said regard
ing his career record. "I just go

out and try to do my job. I'm glad
I gave our team a chance to win
tonight."
Wayne came up big his battle
with losing Texas pitcher Beau

Hale, who threw a no-hitter
against Sam Houston State only
the week before. Hale gave up
eight runs, all of them earned, in
three innings of work while sur

rendering 10 hits to Stanford bat
ters.
Alter Texas went three up,
three down to start the game,
Thompson stepped into the box
and blasted a homer to right field,
the second time this year he lias
opened the Stanford offense with
a home run. Three consecutive
singles by Eric Brundett, Muth
and Gall, brought home another
run to stake the Cardinal to a 2-0
lead in the first inning.
Texas struck back with two
runs in the top of the second on a
homer by Jeff Ontiveros, but
Stanford got four of its own in its
half of the second, with a sacrifice
fly by Brundett and a three-run
shot by Muth putting the Cardi
nal up to stay at 6-2. Stanford
would add two more runs in the
bottom of the fourth for the final
margin.
On Saturday afternoon, how
ever, the pop just wasn't there for
the Cardinal, as winning Texas
pitcher D.J. Jones went eight in
nings while allowing only two
runs. Stanford was actually tied
with the Longhorns in the top of
the eighth inning, when Jeff On
tiveros smacked a 2-2 pitch from
Mike Wodnicki into right center
to bring home Todd West and
put Texas up for good at 3-2. Jeff
Bruksch took the loss for Stan
ford, as be put West on base and
allowed him to steal second, set
ting up Ontiveros' heroics.
"They got the big hit today,"
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess said after the game, refer
ring to the key eighth-inning
double by Ontiveros. "It was a
tight game all the way but they
pitched a little better as well."

starter Brian Sager, as Ontiveros

BrunUett scored on a dribbler
by Gall in the bottom half of the in

Freshman Jason Cooper
tripled to lead off the fifth for the
Cardinal, after which Thompson
singled him home to put Stanford
by a run. Texas tied the score
again with a run in the top of the
seventh on a sacrifice fly by Sam
Anderson.
After Ontiveros* hit in the
eighth, Longhorn pitcher Charlie

Thames came in for Jones and set
the Cardinal down in order for liis
third save of the season.
Sunday afternoon saw forebod
ing dark clouds gathering over
Sunken Diamond, giving the im
pression that once the game start
ed it wasn't going to go for long.
After four and a half innings of ac
tion, which included a Texas triple
play and a home run by Joe Bor
chard, the rain came pouring
down.
After a5l -minute delay, the de
cision was made to cancel the
game, meaning all the statistics
were wiped out.
