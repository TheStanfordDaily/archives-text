### JESSICA TUCKER-MOHL EDITORIAL STAFF 
After 14 months of investigation,
the U.S. Labor Department re
leased to Stanford the names of
nine women involved in a gender
discrimination complaint against
the University. The department re
leased the names in January, at
Stanford's request.
"Stanford requested [the names]
repeatedly," said Provost John
Hennessy, "although it is standard
protocol [by the Department of
Labor] to release the names of the
complainants."
"By providing [the names] to
Stanford, we've created a protected
class," said Labor Department
Spokesman Tino Serrano in Janu
ary. Fhe Labor Department pro
hibits the University from taking
any action against individuals in a
protected class.
The Department of Labor's Of
fice of Federal Contract Compli
ance is currently investigating Stan
ford's hiring, promotion and com
pensation policies.
Several former Stanford profes
sors who have publicized their in
volvement in the complaint sent a

letter to the Board of Trustees last
October in which they described
discrimination at Stanford.
According to the letter, if Stan
lord is violating federal hiring poli
cies, the University will lose $500
million in federal contract pay
ments and research grants.
Former Asst. History Prof.
Karen Sawislak, former Assoc. Prof.
Linda Mabryofthe Law School and
former Senior Medical School Re
search Scientist Colleen Crangle
signed the letter.
They state,"The allegations that
prompted the Department of
investigation are well found
ed, and our own experiences sug
gest that investigators will uncover
extensive violations of federal equal
opportunity laws."
"The DOL has released the
names of nine complainants to the
University, in response to our re
quest that we be informed of all the
complaints against Stanford that
are currently pending," said Senior
University Counsel Tom Fenner.
"We are seeking to confirm
whether these nine are all of the ac
tive complainants."
Some people who have with
drawn their names from the com
plaint claim that the Department of
Labor promised them anonymity.
But Hennessy said that the original
complaint form states that the de
partment will release the name of
the complainant to the employer.
"As 1 understand, [the Depart
ment of Labor] offered the com
plainants the opportunity to with
draw from the complaint and not
have their names released," said
Hennessy.

The employees filed the com
plaint in November 1998 on behalf
of past and present Stanford em
ployees.
The complaint grew to include
about 32 people, according to Saw
islak.
The University maintains that
these allegations of discrimination
represent isolated cases. "There's no
evidence of any systemic problems
in regard to hiring, promotion or
compensation or any other aspect of
employment regarding women
and minorities," said Fenner. "We
have provided data to the Depart
ment of Labor to demonstrate this.
Thus what we are left with is a
number of individual complaints."
