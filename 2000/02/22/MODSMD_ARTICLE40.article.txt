### KATIE FITZPATRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Senior Night, the seniors
stole the show leading No. 9 Stan
ford to a commanding victory over
California (195.35-193.15) in the
women's gymnastics version of Big
Game.
The Cardinal did not have a
flawless meet, hut All-American se
niors Fontaine and Sarah
1 larding contributed nearly flaw
less routines in a total team effort.
Fontaine accumulated a 39.6 all
around total en route to a sweep of
every event title.
Fontaine's scores were as im
pressive as her routines: 9.825 in
vault, 9.925 in bars, 9.9 in beam,
and 9.95 on bars.
"It was the perfect senior meet
— some of the best routines I've
done. It felt good to perform well
when everyone was there," said
Fontaine.
Harding also had one of her
best meets of the season. She
placed second on floor with a 9.9
and had astrong9.B2sshowingon

bars.
"Of all nights, I wanted Senior
Night to go well. It was an ama/ing
feeling," Harding said.
Bars was the best event of the
night for Stanford, where it gar
nered an impressive 49.325 team
total. Stanford managed to shut a
respectable lineup of Bear bar per
formances out of the awards.
Sophomore Katy Herbert took
second behind Fontaine with a
9.875, and third place was a 9.85
tie between junior Jennifer Kxalta
cion and freshman Abby Gair.
One of the most astonishing
performances of the night was by
freshman Alissa Gooper on bars.
Cooper's right grip tore as she
began her routine. Because this
was considered an equipment fail
ure, gymnastics rules allowed her
to begin her routine again.
However, she was forced to
wear a new pair of grips which
often take hours to adjust to and
feel comfortable. Unrattled, (loop
er hit her set for a 9.75 in a pair of
grips she had worn few times be
fore.

"I couldn't believe it — that has
never happened to nit* before. I re
ally wanted to do well because the
rotation was going so well," Coop
er said.
leammates praised Cooper's
perseverance. "Alissa's perfor
mance was huge," Fontaine said.
"One of the hardest things to do is
to adjust at a moment's notice in a
pressure situation and she did."
Sophomore Becky Meldrum
also displayed remarkable
strength. Meldrum hit a 9.8 floor
routine, filling in at the last mo
ment for Kxaltacion, who
scratched the event due to a sore
back.
Meldrum, the most consistent
Cardinal performer 011 beam this
season, also hit yet another solid set
011 beam for a 9.65.
"I was happy with how 1 did. 1
just concentrate on what I do in
practice," Meldrum said.
Fellow sophomore I ferbert also
had a great night, placing second
in the all-around with a career
high 39.15. Herbert's steady rou
tines also earned her second place

honors on bars and beam (9.8).
Other key performances to the
Cardinal victory was the 9.65 vault
performance of freshman Kelsey
Stillinger who attempted a new
vault for the first time this season,
tin* 39.15 all-around effort of Cair

and the solid 9.7 floor perfor
mance of sophomore Kristin
Jensen.
1 he strong team effort against
Cal admist adversity reflects well
on the Cardinal's postseason
chances. Stanford will continue to

train hard and focus on improving
its' gymnastics as the season winds
down.
"It wasn't about beating Cal.
Our focus was on making im
provements and we did that,"
Cooper said.
