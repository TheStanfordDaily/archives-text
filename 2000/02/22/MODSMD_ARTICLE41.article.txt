meet next weekend.
"We swam very well this weekend," said

junior All-American Anihony Robinson.
"[Cal] was ranked above us, and I think
they were expecting to beat us."
"The whole team was pretty nervous be
forehand, including the coaches," said se
nior co-captain Kurt Spenser. "We had a
meeting about what we thought their line
up would be and just focused on what we
had to do to get the job done."

American Rob Canales's performance in
the 200-yard individual medley, where he
not only took first place and earned an
NCAA provisional qualifying time but also

we're strong from top to bottom," Spenser
said. "We have a lot of depth. We won the
[Cal] meet with our depth."
Several Cardinal swimmers displayed

top five in the events that they did not win.
