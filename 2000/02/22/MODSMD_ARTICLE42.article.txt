## Young stars shine in win over LMU 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
I he Loyola Marymount Lions proved to be
the kindling Stanford needed to light the
men s volleyball team on fire Friday night as
the Cardinal breezed by No. 9 LMU 15-8, 15-
4, 15-5.
Stanford (5-7, 5-5 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation), which has struggled to post wins all
season, began to show its true potential in a tight
battle with No. 3 Pepperdine Thursday night.
While Pepperdine won 3-1, the Waves had to
fight for three hours to secure the win. Friday
night Stanford did it in half that time.
Its not what 1 expected, but it was sure nice
to see us dominate," head coach Ruben Nieves
said. "It was good after a hard-fought match
[ I hursday night] to get on them and get out of
there."
\\ it h two of Stanford's kill leaders plagued by
injuries, freshman outside hitter Curt Toppel
(296 season kills), limited by a sore shoulder and
junior middle blocker Brett Youngberg (109
season kills) out with a back injury, starring roles
have opened up for the ( at dinal. And on Friday
night, Stanford found itself with a host of new
heroes stepping up to fill the spot.
At the top of the list is sophomore outside hit
ter Marcus Skacel who notched a career high in
kills with 25, and bettered his career high hitting
percentage of .636 with a .647 performance.
Skacel has been a consistently strong force for
tlie Cardinal this season, leading the team in
digs (93) while placing second on the team with

kills (154) and assists (18). But in the past two
matches, Skacel has dominated the court.
"Marcus was unstoppable," Nieves said. "1
give credit to the setter (junior Josh Lukens] for
giving Marcus good swings, but most of the
credit goes to Marcus for hitting so effectively."
Supplementing the strong play of Skacel
were quick hitters Jon Palacios, a redshirt fresh
man, and Kyle Strache, a freshman, who both
tied their career bests in kills with nine and eight
respectively, while boasting .529 and .462 hit
ting percentages.
Game one started out tight with the two
teams swapping the lead until Palacios decided
it was time to break away. Palacios served Stan
ford from a close 7-6 lead to a decisive 11 -6 lead
and Stanford went on to allow only two points
before closing out the game.
Stanford had struggled to hold teams from
scoring in streaks earlier this season, but in the
past two matches has allowed only three runs of
greater than two points.
"We did well with them not getting a lot of
streaks," Palacios said. "We focused really well.
Finishing was an important part and we knew
we had to do it."
While Stanford boasts of its recent knack for
preventing its opponents from going on runs,
LMU (2-5, 1-5 MPSF) can't say the same.
"Jon Palacios' deep float serve gave [LMU] a
lot of trouble and us a lot of points," Nieves said
citing his serving streak in game one as the most
critical point of the match. "Until then we were
sea-sawing back and forth, we needed someone
to take charge. Jon did that and we never looked
back."
Stanford jumped to a decisive 14-0 lead in

game two propelled once again by an impressive
serving surge by Palacios that gave the Cardinal
a four-point streak and match point. The Lions
survived five match points before Stanford
freshman Will Curtis came of! the bench to shut
down LMU with the game-winning kill.
Game three saw much of the same Stanford
domination as the Cardinal easily closed out the
match surrendering only five points to LMU.
"We played as a team and we played hard,"
Skacel said. "We were fired up and wanted to
win right from the start. Everything went our
way."
To silence the mighty roar of the Lions, the
Cardinal had to contain senior outside hitters
Reid Priddy and Corin Bemus, who belbre the
match were ranked second and fourth respec
tively in the conference for kill averages. Prid
dy's 7.33 and Bemus' 7.17 put the two behind
Stanford's Toppel, who is leading the confer
ence with a 7.84 average.
"We had a good game plan," Skacel said. "We
knew it was going to go to Bemus and Priddy so
we stuck on them and they didn't do very well."
Stanford held Priddy to a .383 hitting per
centage and Bemus to a .000 hitting percentage,
while keeping LMU to a mere .231 hitting per
centage as a team compared to Stanford's .483
tally.
Defensively, Nievessaid his squad had its best
match. The Cardinal outdug LMU 38-29. Top
pel lead the squad with 1.3 digs proving that his
strength goes beyond his nation leading kill-per
game average.
Tonight the Cardinal returns to Maples
Pavilion to see il it can maintain its new-found
intensity against No. 15 UC-Irvine (6-7,2-5).
