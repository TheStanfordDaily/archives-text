# Red-hot softball eats Classic for breakfast
## 
### EMILY DRESSEL 
A San Diego area Denny's Restaurant
was treated to a chorus of cheers and
squeals this past Sunday as Stanford soft
ball coaches proudly revealed a first place
trophy to their players over breakfast.
It rained all morning Sunday, thus
drawing a premature close to the intend
ed six-game weekend of softball play in
Foway.
With four tournament wins under
their belt and a crushing loss to No. (>
Michigan in extra innings on Thursday,
the team awoke Sunday ready to take on
C lal State Noi thridge and end the (lamp
bell / Cartiei Classic tournament with au
thority.
I he team went to-break fast that morn
ing with fans and family from the San
I )iego area while the coat lies explored the
wet field conditions at the tournament
site.
"I I all way through breakfast, then nich
es walked in and told iis the tournament
was canceled due to the rain," sophomore
center-fielder and tournament MVP Jessi
ca Mendo/asaid. "But, then they removed
the bag that was covering a trophy and
said we had won the tournament. Kvery

one started shouting and cheering. Kven
the waitresses got into it."
Following play on Saturday, only two of
the nationally acclaimed participating
teams could boast one loss. One was the
Cardinal, whose new record stands at 11-
1 overall, and the other was No.Fresno
State.
With identical records of 4-1 for the
weekend, tournament officials looked to
runs allowed to determine an overall
champion.
However, the teams were deadlocked
in that area as well, having each allowed
live runs throughout tournament play.
Fventually, runs scored had to be taken
into account and Stanford won handily
with a grand total of 28 runs, compared to
six from the Bulldogs.
I he team opened with a nail-bitter loss
against Michigan Thursday, Stanford's
first defeat of the year.
Freshman pitcher Dana Sorensen, who
was named to the All-Tournament team,
battled it out on the mound with the
Wolverine's l ( .) ( .) ( .) Big Ten Pitcher of the
Year, Marie Bat da.
After seven scoreless innings, the teams
resorted to an international tie-breaker,
which allows the offense to place a runner

on second at the start of every extra inning
of play.
()n a (Cardinal error, Michigan was able
to load up the bases and drive in two runs
in the top of the eighth inning, which the
Cardinal could not duplicate.
"During that first game we didn't have
that much momentum," Mendoza said.
"We could have beaten them. 1 would
have liked to have seen what would have
happened had we played them later on in
the weekend."
I lowever, the team bounced back with
a vengeance and dominated Tennessee
(9-0) and Arkansas (8-2) the next after
noon.
"After falling a little short in Thursday's
game In gi\ ing Michigan some outs in the
last inning, they stayed focused and came
back the next day ready to play," head
coach John Rittman said of his team.
I lie Cardinal disposed of Tennessee
early in a game that was cut short by the
run-rule, or an eight-run lead alter five
lull innings of play.
Freshman pitc her Fori Nyberg, mak
ing liei debut on the mound after being
sidelined In a persistent rib injury, com
bined with Sorensen for the shutout.
Later that day, freshman pitcher Jaime

Forman-Lau struck out eight in four in
nings against Arkansas. Eventually, Ny
berg relieved Forman-Lau against the
Lady Backs and added three more score
less innings.
Saturday Stanford's aggressive offense
kicked off again in a five-inning, 8-0 win
over No. 15 Long Beach State. Mendoza
pounded a two-run homer over the fence
in the third, which freshman third-base
man Kira Ching later rivaled with her
fourth inning grand-slam.
The score of the San Diego State game
at least gives the impression that the Car
dinal was challenged this weekend. Stan
ford barreled clown the A/tecs as well with
a dazzling performance from Forman-
Lau in the c irc le, who struck out 10 in five
innings.
Mendoza, who went .429 for the tour
nament, cranked two more home-runs in
the 3-1 victory, proving her bat is as hot as
they come.
Keeping with the trend of the season,
the Cardinal made it a point to come out
scoring right from the first inning. In its
last 12 games, the team has tallied a grand
total of 28 runs in its first innings of play.
"One of our main goals is to get ahead
early. It puts pressure on the other team

and relives pressure on us," sophomore'
shortstop Robin Walker said. "Then, you
just keep scoring until you eventually shut
them down."
It is players like Walker, who batted a. .
solid .400 for Stanford this weekend, who
makes such early scoring possible. The-..;-
team's offense this year is impeccable^».
lacking even the slightest weak link. -.V
. "One of our strengths is our line-up,"
Rittman said. "From our lead-off to the
ninth spot in the order, the other teams
can't pitch around anyone."
It seems as though the players are in
perfect sync with one another. If one play
er isn't producing, another will step up
and fill that void.
"Different people proved themselves-,
this weekend and made up for those who
might have been struggling,'' Walker said.
Mendoza agrees. "Everyone is so capa
ble this year," she said. "The game isn't
dependent on one person's at bat because |
everyone, even people on the bench, can!'* •
step it up."

to load up the bases and drive in two runs
in the top of the eighth inning, which the
Cardinal could not duplicate.
"During that first game we didn't have
that much momentum," Mendoza said.
"We could have beaten them. 1 would
have liked to have seen what would have
happened had we played them later on in
the weekend."
I lowever, the team bounced back with
a vengeance and dominated Tennessee
(9-0) and Arkansas (8-2) the next after
noon.
"After falling a little short in Thursday's
game In gi\ ing Michigan some outs in the
last inning, they stayed focused and came
back the next day ready to play," head
coach John Rittman said of his team.
I lie Cardinal disposed of Tennessee
early in a game that was cut short by the
run-rule, or an eight-run lead alter five
lull innings of play.
Freshman pitc her Fori Nyberg, mak
ing liei debut on the mound after being
sidelined In a persistent rib injury, com
bined with Sorensen for the shutout.
Later that day, freshman pitcher Jaime

Forman-Lau struck out eight in four in
nings against Arkansas. Eventually, Ny
berg relieved Forman-Lau against the
Lady Backs and added three more score
less innings.
Saturday Stanford's aggressive offense
kicked off again in a five-inning, 8-0 win
over No. 15 Long Beach State. Mendoza
pounded a two-run homer over the fence
in the third, which freshman third-base
man Kira Ching later rivaled with her
fourth inning grand-slam.
The score of the San Diego State game
at least gives the impression that the Car
dinal was challenged this weekend. Stan
ford barreled clown the A/tecs as well with
a dazzling performance from Forman-
Lau in the c irc le, who struck out 10 in five
innings.
Mendoza, who went .429 for the tour
nament, cranked two more home-runs in
the 3-1 victory, proving her bat is as hot as
they come.
Keeping with the trend of the season,
the Cardinal made it a point to come out
scoring right from the first inning. In its
last 12 games, the team has tallied a grand
total of 28 runs in its first innings of play.
"One of our main goals is to get ahead
early. It puts pressure on the other team

and relives pressure on us," sophomore'
shortstop Robin Walker said. "Then, you
just keep scoring until you eventually shut
them down."
It is players like Walker, who batted a. .
solid .400 for Stanford this weekend, who
makes such early scoring possible. The-..;-
team's offense this year is impeccable^».
lacking even the slightest weak link. -.V
. "One of our strengths is our line-up,"
Rittman said. "From our lead-off to the
ninth spot in the order, the other teams
can't pitch around anyone."
It seems as though the players are in
perfect sync with one another. If one play
er isn't producing, another will step up
and fill that void.
"Different people proved themselves-,
this weekend and made up for those who
might have been struggling,'' Walker said.
Mendoza agrees. "Everyone is so capa
ble this year," she said. "The game isn't
dependent on one person's at bat because |
everyone, even people on the bench, can!'* •
step it up."
After claiming the Campbell / Carrier
Classic title this last weekend, the Stanford , •
Softball team is quickly becoming one of
the top teams to beat this season nation
wide.
