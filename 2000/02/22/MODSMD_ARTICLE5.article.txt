of home-schooled applicants

home-schooled students
jump from 15 to 36

Four students in the Class of 2003 were admit
ted to Stanford even though they never graduated
from high school. These students, along with a
growing number of American students, were
home-schooled and are causing a stir in the ad
missions offices of colleges and universities.
According to a Wall Street Journal article,
home-schooled students across the nation are
scoring so well on standardized tests, including the
SATs, that colleges must take notice. Many schools
are modifying admissions processes to accommo
date the lack of high school transcripts and other
documentation that home-schoolers do not pos
sess.
This is true at Stanford, where the Office of Un
dergraduate Admissions has just begun to orga
nize and systematically track home-schooled ap
plicants.
According to Jon Reider, senior associate direc
tor of admission, 1999 was the first year that the
Admissions Office grouped home
schoolers under their own code.
Fifteen home-schooled students
applied for admission to Stanford
last year; four were admitted and
joined the 1999-2000 freshmen
( lass. This amounts to a 27 percent
acceptance rate for home-school
ers, nearly double the overall ac
ceptance rate. This year Stanford
has 36 home-schooled applicants,
hut because the Admissions Office
has not finished the admissions
process, the acceptance rate is still
unknown.
Because of an increase in appli
cations from home-schooled stu
deuts, a section of the Admissions
Office's Wei> |)age 1 low ac 1(h esses is
sues that those applicants face.
" The normal criteria of admis
sions are applied to them," Reider
said. "The unusual part is the sec

ondary school report because this is
filled out by their parents. It can be
challenging for parents to write
about their kids' development and
to be objective, but some are really
good at this."
Because of the lack of quantita
tive information, test scores play a
large role in Stanford's evaluation
of these students. Ii also helps if the
students have attended community
college courses or have had tutors
who can give perspectives diflerent
from those of the applicants' par
ents.
"Usually the home-schoolers
that we see are well-motivated,"
Reider said. "The key is to articu
late that in the application."
Becca I fall and Tim Stonehock
er, both freshmen, were home
schooled.
Hall chose home-schooling on
her own.
"I did the kind of'home-school
ing called 'unschooling' which basi
cally means that my curriculum was
interest-led," said I lall. "I did pret

ty much everything on my own. I
was not really taught by anyone-it
was more like independent study."
When applying to college, Hall
and her parents hired a guidance
counselor to help them research
schools and admissions processes.
For Hall, (lit* most difficult part
of the process was putting together
a transcript.
"Instead of providing a tran
script, I did a summary of every
thing that I studied," Hall said.
"But the Stanford application was
good because of all t he essays where
I could provide additional informa
tion."
"In coming to Stanford, 112
thought it might be hard because I
would have people telling me what
to do, hut it isn't that bad because I
am here because I want to be here,
and if I don't want to be here, 1 can
leave," Hall said.
Stonehocker and his family de
voted a lot ol time to researching
what information colleges expect in
students' applications. Their two

main resources were their local
public high school and Wheaton
College in Illinois. Because the sur
rounding area lias a high number
of home-schooled students,
Wheaton holds workshops that
help home-schoolers understand
what colleges are looking for in the
admissions process.
"I spent a lot of time writing the
essay, taking the time to learn about
what tliey wanted to know about
me and how 1 should present my
self," Stonehocker said.
"Probably the only thing that
was much different was having to
compile a list of my classes. 1 did
some correspondence work and
took some classes from a local pri
vate high school, so I did receive
grades from other institutions to
help supplement my transcript."
Because "home-schooling
taught me to manage my time and
to work at my own pace in order to
get the work done," the transition
to college was not difficult, Stone
hocker said.
