# Local man overcomes history of hardship
## Kurdish cafÃ© owner builds a newlife far from ancestral home 
### CAITRIN McKIERNAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When Stanford students and professors walk
through the doors of the upscale Italian restau
rant, Cafe Pro Bono, they might not know they
have entered a Kurdish enclave. Moreover, they
might not realize that the downtown Palo Alto
business is one of more than 30 Kurdish-owned
restaurants in the Bay Area.
Kurt Ugur, Cafe Pro Bono's proprietor, was
born in Turkey in 1950. He came to the United
States in 1979, and his story is much like those of
the:*() or so other Kurdish restaurant owners
who have immigrated from Turkey to the Bay
Area.
Until he was 11-years-old, Ugur lived in a
mud stone house without electricity in Haag, a
r>o-household Kurdish mountain village in the
Dersim region of northeastern Turkey. A creek
and waterfall, outlets of the Euphrates River,
flow through the village. In the springtime,
Ugur fished for silver salmon by standing under
the waterfall and grabbing the fish. He also
learned the family trades: raising barley, beans
and watermelon, grafting pear trees onto apple
trees, plowing the fields with oxen and herding
sheep.
Now, sitting at a white cloth-covered table in
his restaurant, Ugur reflected, "I sometimes
think I come 112 rom the Middle Ages."
But that does not mean he looks back with
disdain. In fact, when he describes his old life, he
becomes quiet.
"I still miss the place I was born," he said.
He does not, however, miss the constant fear.
From 1923 to I9f>7, outsiders were forbidden to
travel to the Dersim region, an area "about the
size of Northern (California." It was ruled by the
jatidur nut, the military police.
"They were the law of the land. I knew ibis at
five years old .. .they searched our house. They
checked on you. If they come to your home, you
have to feed them; you have no choice. They
would tell us that they would kill us."
The military presence continued after 1957,
when the area was opened and roads were built.
Just two years earlier, llaag.s elementary
school had opened, and Ugur was a member of
the first class. Ugur's Kurdish teacher was for
bidden to teach the Kurdish language to the stu
dents.
Ugur and his cousin were the first to leave the
village and pursue further education. At age 1 1,
he moved to Istanbul, where he lived with his
uncle and attended middle school. For the first
time, he felt the sting of being Kurdish.

"When I started middles* hool, every student
would tease me and joke with me and call me
'Kurd, Kurd, Kurd,' making a play on my
name, Kurt. One day, I was very sad. My music
teacher, a Turk, came and asked, 'Why do you
cry? Be proud to be a Kurd.' She taught me a
lot."
During high school, Ugur lived alone and
supported himself. His uncle had returned to
llaag to take over family affairs following his
grandfather's death. During the winter, Ugur
attended school, and in the summer he worked
as a waiter in Italian and French restaurants, his
first jobs in the restaurant business.
When Ugur graduated from high school, he
qualified to attend a university.
"But, because of the political turmoil of the
late 60s and early 70s, [acceptance was contin
gent upon | connections."
Turkey. Ugur explained, was divided be
tween the National Action Party and the Funda
mentalist party. As a Kurd and a non-Muslim,
he felt that he could join neither.
Around the same time, Ugur watched a doc -
umentary about Yosemite National Park, which
led him to consider the possibility of emigrating
to California.
"The place where I come from is identical to
Yosemite. Trees, mountains . . . California has
very similar weather."
In order to obtain a passport, however, he
had to serve 18 months in the Turkish military.
"I was beaten [because I was a Kurd]," he
said.
Following his military service, Ugur contin
ued his restaurant work in Istanbul. He moved
to Berlin in 1970 and shortly thereafter to Lon
don, where he worked as a waiter in Picadilly
Square.
"I was drawn to tlie restaurant business. It
was the only thing I knew," he said.
In London, while working at the Arizona
Steak House, he waited on his future wife and
her family, who were on vacation from Castro
Valley, California. I hey took their picture to
gether and, three months later, she sent it to
him. They were pen-pals until 1979, when he
landed a job on the Caribbean Cruise Line,
which brought him to Miami. There, he found
a job as a stock clerk. Michele, his 112 uture wife and
the only person that he knew in the United
States, came to visit.
Soon after, he moved to C '.astro Valley, where
he rented out a small room, worked as a stock
clerk for an orthopedic technology company
during the week and installed hardwood floors
lor Michele's father on the weekends. In 1980,
Ugur and Michele married, and Ugur found a
third job waiting tables three nights a week while
Michele attended college.
His work ethic, Ugur explained, came from
his grandfather.
"lie never ate lunch alone. He always had to
share his food . . . my whole family is this way."
Even now that Ugur owns a successful restau
rant and his own home and sends his children to
a private school, lie still works seven daysa week.
I le funds Kurdish relief efforts and helps recent
immigrants find food, shelter and jobs. Since
Ugur emigrated from I m key, approximately
1 ,000 Kurds from the Dersim region, including
much of his family, have emigrated to the Bay
Area.
"All of them have worked in the [restaurant
business] with me or my brother or our associ
ates," he explained.
Ugur is a motivated businessman. One day,
while working as a stock clerk at the orthopedic
technology company, he inarched into his boss'
office.
"(live me two days and two men to supervise,
he said, and I will organize your inventory," he
said. He did just that. When he quit working for
the company live years later, Ugur was super
vising 80 to 100 people.
At that point, Ugur decided to return to the
restaurant business. He and his brother bought
a French restaurant in San Mateo, which they
owned for three years. They sold the restaurant

in 1989, and Ugur bought Cafe Pro Bono,
whose menu he c hanged after remodeling the
establishment.
"I hired the top chef in the valley, who has
opened 17 Italian restaurants," he said. The
chef still cooks at the restaurant.
(Cafe Pro Bono is tucked away on Birch
Street, a block off (California Street, ft is often
bustling with Silicon Valley executives, Stanford
professors and the occasional Stanford students
on a lane y dale. Framed letters from food critics
requesting a recipe or praising a dish adorn the
walls. Ugur stands at the front door, greeting
diners with his booming voice, calling his cus
tomers "sir, miss or madam." During the meal,
he makes his way through the restaurant, chat
ting-
"l like to be with people," he said.
Even on a lazy afternoon, before the restau
rant opens for dinner, he sits on the front patio,
interrupting one conversation to chat with nu
merous people who pass on the sidewalk.
Despite his new life, Ugur still feels a strong
connection to his Kurdish roots. His three c hil
dren have Kurdish names. I le pronounces each
with emphasis and carefully explains the Eng
lish meaning. Also, he tries to speak Kurdish
with his children.
On the weekends, between restaurant
hours, Ugur attends his daughter's basketball
and volleyball games. Still, he maintains that,
"my children never had the c hildhood that I
had. I think every child should live in the
mountains."
But they cannot return to the village.
"I will return as a visitor," he explained.
In 1990 the valley was dammed In the Turk
ish government. Ugur's mud stone house,
which was in his family for (570 years, was on the
top of a mountain. Now, only the roof is visible
above the water. People are forbidden to return
to the portion of land which remains.
"1 knew every village (in the area because my
family) had a general store," Ugur said. "Most
people are dead or gone. Now the c ivilization
has died or is gone, perished In the lore col gov
ernment."
I le acknowledges the struggle on all sides:
" This war has been bad lor Turks and Kurds
alike. [We] have to find a better way ... I sup
port a peaceful solution."
He feels that he is working toward this solu
tion on a smaller level by raising awareness
among his friends in the Bay Area community.
"At least they know that the Kurd exists, he
has a business, he is in Palo Alto," he said.
