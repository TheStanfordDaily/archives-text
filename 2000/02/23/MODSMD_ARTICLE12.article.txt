## Rioting kills 20 in Nigeria 
### 
ABU JA, Nigeria (AP) —Heav-
ily armed soldiers patrolled the
empty streets of the northern
Nigerian city of Kaduna yester
day, where two days of bloody
religions rioting killed at least 20
people and left buildings burned.
More than 100 rioters were
arrested during the fighting,
police said.
Police and residents said the
lighting, ignited In a proposal to
bring Islamic law to Kaduna state,
had ended by early yesterday
afternoon. Only soldiers and
police officers were seen on the
streets, residents said, but the city
remained highly charged with
anger.
Witnesses said at least 20 peo
ple died in the violence, though
police said only 13 corpses had
been found by late yesterday
afternoon.
Officials have declared a 20-
hour-a-day curfew for Kaduna,
about 120 miles north of Abuja,
and have set up roadblocks keep
ing visitors well away from the
city.
"No movement will be allowed
into and within the metropolis,"
Deputy Governor Stephen
Shekari said. Police later said the
curfew and the roadblocks would
be lifted this morning between 8
a.m. and noon.
All businesses were ordered
closed, and people were ordered
to remain indoors.
The violence started as chant
ing Christians demonstrated
Monday morning against a pro
posal to bring sharia, or Islamic
law. to Kaduna state. They were
met by Muslim coiinter-demon
strators and the groups began
fighting.
By Monday afternoon, the two
sides had taken control of differ
ent neighborhoods and divided
the city into warring /ones.
Dozens of homes and businesses
were burned, along with a
Roman Catholic cathedral and
the city's central mosque.
Sharia, which officially went
into affect last month in neigh
boring Zamfara state, has become
an increasingly inflammatory
issue in this nation of 120 million,
where bloody ethnic and religious
violence are common.
Supporters of sharia say the
laws will not a fleet Christians,
who will retain the light to be
tried in secular courts under sec
ular laws.
But that has done little to
assuage Christian fears.
