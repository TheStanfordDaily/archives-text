through citv streets to Capitol llill to protest
diesel fuel prices and demand tax breaks to
offset greatly increased operating costs.

now."
More than 200 truckers joined a convoy

throw them out ol business and wreak havoc
on an ccononn that depends on trucks to
transport 90 percent of loods, including lood.
clothing, cars and appliances.
