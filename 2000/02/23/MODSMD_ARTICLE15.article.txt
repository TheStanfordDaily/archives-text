CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
(AP) — The space shuttle
Endeavour and its crew of six
headed for home yesterday
with more than a week's worth
of radar images that will be
transformed into the finest
maps of Earth ever created.
Custy wind at Cape Canaver
al forced NASA to put off land
ing for another 90-minute
orbit. After the wind eased,
however, Mission Control gave
the go-ahead for a landing right
around sunset.
During their I 1-day voyage,
Endeavour's astronauts worked
in round-the-clock shifts to
keep two large radar antennas
running — one in the shuttle
cargo bay and one on the end
of a 197-foot mast. The method
is expected to produce amaz
ingly precise 3-D maps of
Earth's peaks and valleys.
1 he radar mapped 43.5 mil
lion square miles ol Earth's ter
rain at least twice, just 2.5 mil
lion square miles shy of NASA's
original goal. The surveyed
land stretched as far north as
British Columbia and as iar
south as Cape I lorn, and repre
sented three-quarters of the
world's terrain.
NASA's first order of business
involved unloading the more
than 300 digital tapes containing
all the radar data. After several
weeks of making copies of every
thing, the tapes will be flown to
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena. (lalif.

NASA and rts partner, tne
National Imagery and Mapping
Agency, expect it will take one to
two years to analyze all of the
tapes, fhe astronauts collected
nearly 12 terabytes of data,
enough to fill 20,600 compact
discs.
Ihe Pentagon will use the
information to improve the aim
of missiles and provide better
navigation for fighter pilots and
ground troops.
fhe best maps will be
reserved for the military.
Evervone else — arc haeologists,
geologists, airline pilots, emer
gent \ relief groups — will have
lo settle for less precise charts.
Bin even those will be better
than current ones.
Next up for NASA is an April
ferry flight by space shuttle
Atlantis to ihe fledgling interna
iional space station.
