not likely to last.
I'he Fox network, meanwhile, is
divorcing itself from the idea ol ever
marrying oil another multimillionaire
alter the embarrassment ol finding out

annul the marriage, no questions
asked. He said he thought that would
happen.

$35,000 engagement ring and an

letting the air out of the tires on her
car. He said he has a temper but "it

doesn't manifest itself 100 often.
