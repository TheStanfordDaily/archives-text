ager Robert Reed, who promised
siiklt'iHs liisi week thai the Office ol
I Ik' Inspector General would con
duct .in cxtei nal investigation ol the Stanford
post oHice, should be ready to make good on
its claims.
Horace llinshaw, a spokesman lor Reed's
ollice, told I he Sail Francisco Chronicle on
l eh. 17 that, il there was no reason to suspect
criminal actions ;it the Stanford station, the
investigation would likel\ Ih* conducted at the
district level.
Information ahout criminal actions can only
surface with a thorough investigation of the
Stanford station, and such information will
not (oine from an internal investigation ol the
post office. Reed said last Tuesday, l eh. 15, at
the ASM public Ibruni: "()I(i will be asked to

come here to investigate the Stanford post
office," and this promise should stand as is.
Hinshaw's ambiguous response to The
Chronicle speaks poorly of the office's credi
bility to uphold their promises, as well as their
judgement concerning the situation at the
Stanford station.
Reports of lost mail, misplaced complaint
forms, rude customer service and even an
instance of sexual harassment by a postal
employee cannot be ignored by an outside
investigator such as the <)I(i, but can, howev
er, be buried by bureacracy in an internal
investigation conducted by the district office.
Indeed, it appears that the increasingly
escalating postal concerns that students have
had over the past several years have been
shifted aside. I here can be no other explana
tion for students' rightful observations that

service at 11 it* post office lias not gotten better
over tlie years, but steadily worse.
How ( an we expect an ollice that is clearly
either over-burdened and / or extremely dis
organized lo instigate an ellcctive investigation
ol iis own seriously questionable practices?
And, il many of these oversights have
occurred under the watch of the very individ
uals conducting the investigation, will those
mistake's ever even come to light? It would be
foolhardy to place trust in the hands of an
office that has repeatedly demonstrated it has
too many unaddressed issues of its own.
In the wake of the very serious problems
that have been plaguing the post ollice in the
past few months, it seems only reasonable that
an outside authority or agency is the only solu
tion for any investigation ol the post office.
An independent investigator can, with an

unbiased stance, look deeply into ilie case,
interview individual employees, identify prob
lem areas and arrive at a game plan for insti
tuting improvements. Such an investigator
would also be more likely than internal inves
tigators to enforce any policies ii may create.
And, an investigation conducted by the OKI
can determine if there has indeed been crimi
nal negligence and take action based on what
ever conclusion it reaches.
Reed has assured students and representa
tives for Senator Diane Feinstein and U.S.
Rep. Anna Kshoo, D-Atherton, that he has fol
lowed up with the OICI in the past week.
Hopefully, his contact with the ()I(i will even
tually amount to an external investigation of
the post office and a solution to the problems
that have been troubling patrons of the Stan
lord station for some time.
