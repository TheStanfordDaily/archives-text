So, Klvis was a had man. Not because
he sang all ol Big Mama 1 hornton's
repertoire. ("Mound Dog" ring a bell?)
Not because lie died on the toilet seat,
coked to the gills. And not because his
daughter performed in that horrifying
Micluiel |a< kson video. But because In
passed die songs oil'as his music and his
originality. I doubt Big Mama Ihornton
received a penn\ in royalties.
likewise, Mr. Ice Ice Baby proclaimed
his roots with tales of growing up hard on
llic streets with his gangsta friends. I won
der il lie would have been as popular if lie
had |iist told the truth (childhood in sub
urbia) instead of regaling the public with
lalse gangbangcr tales. (II it's one thing
VI I-1 has taught us, it's not to lie about
youi past. Are you listening, Britney?)
I guess it's all about respect. Both for
and from vour audience and your musical
heritage.
Personally, I have a lot of respect lor
gospel music. And yet, even alter three
sears, I'm still not sure if I have crossed
that line from being an out.si(lei t<> being a
member ol the gospel choir community.
I feel like I'm always on the fringe,
reminded that this cultural heritage
belongs to somebody else. Acknowledged,
maybe even respected. But not quite
accepted. Acceptance involves not just the
group itself, but also m\ own sense of
belonging and the audience's validation ol
lis as a unified entity.
l or now, though, what I have may be
the most that I can expect. I lie lad
remains that gospel isn't the culture I've
grown up with and lived. Alter all, Viet
namese (or, as Senator John McCain calls
us, "gooks") don't have a gospel music tra
dition. Still, that doesn't mean I can't
appreciate it.
Believe me, this is not a call to arms lor
Asians to get involved in hip-hope// masse.
Nor is it a plea lor more Asians, or more of
aiivbo(l\ lor that matter, to join the (iospel
Choir. Singing with them has given me a
new personal perspective, but, as great as
having perspective is, it's the music that
matters most to me. I guess I just want to
be seen as a good singer. Not someone
who can sing pretty well for an Asian.
