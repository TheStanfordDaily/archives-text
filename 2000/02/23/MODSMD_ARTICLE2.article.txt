## Census officials hope to remedy problem of student undercount 
### SABA BIREDA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In addition to minorities, the poor, the
homeless, and children, college students are
among the most undercounted individuals by
census workers.
College students are particularly difficult to
count because of their multiple addresses and
low census questionnaire response rates.
This year, the Census Bureau is hoping to
curl) miscounts and undercounts by embark
ing on an ambitious program of community
partnerships and outreach.
" 1 his is the first time the CCensus Bureau has
made partnerships on a mass scale... they
have taken outreach to an unprecedented
level," said census analyst and Sociology Prof.
Matt Snipp.
In addition to paid advertisements and
newly formed Complete Count Committees,
local census officials plan to aggressively attack
the problem of undercountingon the Stanford
campus.
Phil Matthews, assistant manager for re
cruiting in the Sunnyvale Census 2000 office,
said hisollice is working with various students
groups, fraternities and sororities to heighten

awareness among Stanford students. The of
fice will also attend several basketball games to
distribute information about the census, as well
as recruit students to be field counters.
Field counters make about $15.50 an hour
and census office workers earn about $ 11.75 an
hour.
Matthews added that Stanford has been the
most difficult university to plan activities for in
Santa Clara County. Difficulties in posting in
formation on the campus and other forms of
bureaucracy hinder outreach efforts.
Santa Clara government officials estimate
that roughly 9.5 to 10 percent of the under
count in the last census originated in unincor
porated county areas like Stanford. Because
census figures are used to decide how federal
funding is distributed, the county loses money
for every student not counted.
Pete Kutras, the assistant county executive
for Santa Clara county estimated that the
county lost between $60 million and $180 mil
lion in funding over the past 10 years due to an
approximate undercount of 40,000 people in
the 1990 census.
"The census bureau has told us the real issue
is not the [undercountj of the dorm population
but the students who are living off campus or in
group settings where one person may not fill
out the form for all the people living in the
house," he said.
Kutras said the county has formed partner

ships with Stanford administrators and ASSU
President Mike Levin.
"We wish to be as helpful as possible. We
know that Stanford is a complex institution and
knowing who to go to is difficult," said Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education James
Montoya. "That is why we are currently in con
versation with the Census Bureau."
The Census Bureau has expressed a strong
interest in having Stanford administrators help
recruit student workers for the bureau, Mon
toya said.
"We're open to any conversation that would
