# Stand up and be counted
## Census officials hope to remedy problem of student undercount 
### SABA BIREDA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In addition to minorities, the poor, the
homeless, and children, college students are
among the most undercounted individuals by
census workers.
College students are particularly difficult to
count because of their multiple addresses and
low census questionnaire response rates.
This year, the Census Bureau is hoping to
curl) miscounts and undercounts by embark
ing on an ambitious program of community
partnerships and outreach.
" 1 his is the first time the CCensus Bureau has
made partnerships on a mass scale... they
have taken outreach to an unprecedented
level," said census analyst and Sociology Prof.
Matt Snipp.
In addition to paid advertisements and
newly formed Complete Count Committees,
local census officials plan to aggressively attack
the problem of undercountingon the Stanford
campus.
Phil Matthews, assistant manager for re
cruiting in the Sunnyvale Census 2000 office,
said hisollice is working with various students
groups, fraternities and sororities to heighten

awareness among Stanford students. The of
fice will also attend several basketball games to
distribute information about the census, as well
as recruit students to be field counters.
Field counters make about $15.50 an hour
and census office workers earn about $ 11.75 an
hour.
Matthews added that Stanford has been the
most difficult university to plan activities for in
Santa Clara County. Difficulties in posting in
formation on the campus and other forms of
bureaucracy hinder outreach efforts.
Santa Clara government officials estimate
that roughly 9.5 to 10 percent of the under
count in the last census originated in unincor
porated county areas like Stanford. Because
census figures are used to decide how federal
funding is distributed, the county loses money
for every student not counted.
Pete Kutras, the assistant county executive
for Santa Clara county estimated that the
county lost between $60 million and $180 mil
lion in funding over the past 10 years due to an
approximate undercount of 40,000 people in
the 1990 census.
"The census bureau has told us the real issue
is not the [undercountj of the dorm population
but the students who are living off campus or in
group settings where one person may not fill
out the form for all the people living in the
house," he said.
Kutras said the county has formed partner

ships with Stanford administrators and ASSU
President Mike Levin.
"We wish to be as helpful as possible. We
know that Stanford is a complex institution and
knowing who to go to is difficult," said Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education James
Montoya. "That is why we are currently in con
versation with the Census Bureau."
The Census Bureau has expressed a strong
interest in having Stanford administrators help
recruit student workers for the bureau, Mon
toya said.
"We're open to any conversation that would

help provide a more accurate
count," he continued.
Because federal research fund
ing and financial aid dollars are not
dependent on census counts of
Stanford's student population, the
University is not directly affected
by census results.
Student counts are s'ill impor
tant, however, according to
Matthews.
"The student population im
pacts the funding for the sin
rounding community — the way
things are governed and funds are
allocated," he said.
Census results are used to deter
mine congressional district bound
aries and federal funding distribu
tion. In addition, many students
benefit from federal dollars allocat
ed to the area for services like pub
lic transportation, highways and
hospitals.
Undercounts result in a loss of
funding for the county, which may
result in decreased services for the
area.
The biggest cause of under
counting is individuals failing to re
spond to the census mailing, a CCen
sus 2000 public information official
said. From 1970 to 1990, census re
sponse rates dropped from 78 to 05
percent.
Low response rates have forced
the federal government to spend
$225 million dollars to hire field
counters. Stanford students will re

reive a census form if they have a
city address, which most dorms
have. II they do not fill out the
form, a counter will be sent to their
residence. Sending a counter to a
residence costs about eight times as
much as mailing a census form.
Snipp encouraged students to
take the census seriously.
"The census is a civic responsi
bility, like voting. The conse
quences a are bit less obvious, but it
does impact communities, and it is
your way of making sure you are
represented," he said.
College students are the subjects
of many reports and profiles pub
lished by the Census Bureau. The
number of students on financial aid
as well as the number of minority
college students are available from
the Census Bureau.
The feelings of Stanford stu
dents vary on the census issue.
Junior Daniel Lipkin said. "1
don't think people care about the
census. They should know more
about politics in general." Lipkin
added that he would work as a cen
sus counter.
Freshman Jainila Webb felt she
knew little about the census but
said she would lill it out "as her duty
as a black person in America."
Census forms will be mailed on
March 15. Census 2000 workers
have been working for months and
will continue to work well into next
year to make sure an accurate
count is taken. Through outreach,
advertisements (one of the first pre
miered during the Super Bowl),
and hiring student counters, the
Census Bureau hopes to make this
census the most accurate ever.
