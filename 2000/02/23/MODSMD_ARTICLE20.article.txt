Webb Ranch workers protest

about their struggle."
In this letter we want to express all the
problems, abuses and injustices caused
by management's discrimination against
the workers.
First of all, we will highlight several
points with which we I eel dissatisfied.
Workers are exposed to a variety of
dangers (poison oak, extreme tempera
tures. high-risk falls, etc.) and, in spite ol
this, Webb Ranch does not want to pro
vide a medical plan.
We do not get any paid vacation days
or holidays, even though almost 50 per
cent ol our workers have been working
for the company lor over 25 years.
When we do oil-ranch work, clients
are charged over $10 to 12 an hour for
the services we provide, but we are not
paid over $8.
It's because of all this that we the
workers are demanding a lair contract

and a better salary, so that we can give
our children a better level of life and a
better future, so that they do not have to
experience the same humiliations and
exploitation as their parents.

Unethical Sleep and Dreams assignment
furthers professor's political goals
I'm a student enrolled in the popular
"Sleep and Dreams" course lliis quarter
and I would like to comment on an
extremely unethical assignment which is
part of the Sleep and Dreams curricu
lum.
This assignment, a full 10 percent of a
student's grade, is to write a one-page
letter to one's Congressperson urging
that Congress address the problem of
sleep debt and sleep disorders iu our
society.
Now, whether or not sleep debt and
sleep disorders are a serious problem
worthy of Congress's attention is beside
the point. Actually, 1 believe that it is a
serious issue. But, by forcing students to
write letters espousing a single view
point, the professor of Sleep and
Dreams, Dr. William Dement, is uncthi

rally using students to further his own
political agenda.
Dr. Dement lias spent enormous
amounts ol time and eflbrt addressing
the issues ol sleep debt and sleep disor
ders .ind has repeatedly testified before
Congress urging that action be taken to
combat these problems. This assignment
is nothing more than a way for him use
the Sleep and Dreams course to continue
his crusade.
Ihe letters to Congress cannot
espouse a student's individual opinions
ol the subject of sleep debt and sleep dis
orders, but must conform to Dr.
Dement s own views. Indeed, the assign
ment clearly states that the student must,
"convince (longress that there is a serious
problem out there," and part of the
grade is based on how well the student
conveys that message.
Needless to say, it is highly inappro
priate and unethical for a professor to
use his power to grade students as a lever
lor his own political agenda. 'I his consti
tutes a serious breach of academic stan
dards.
Now, to be fair, the letter is not strict
ly mandatory. The assignment adds that
students also have the option of writing a
two to three page report on a specific
sleep disorder, using at least five differ
ent bibliographic sources. Let's see ... a
