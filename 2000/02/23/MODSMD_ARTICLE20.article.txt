In this letter we want to express all the
problems, abuses and injustices caused
by management's discrimination against
the workers.
First of all, we will highlight several
points with which we I eel dissatisfied.
Workers are exposed to a variety of
dangers (poison oak, extreme tempera
tures. high-risk falls, etc.) and, in spite ol
this, Webb Ranch does not want to pro
vide a medical plan.
We do not get any paid vacation days
or holidays, even though almost 50 per
cent ol our workers have been working
for the company lor over 25 years.
When we do oil-ranch work, clients
are charged over $10 to 12 an hour for
the services we provide, but we are not
paid over $8.
It's because of all this that we the
workers are demanding a lair contract

and a better salary, so that we can give
our children a better level of life and a
better future, so that they do not have to
experience the same humiliations and
exploitation as their parents.

Unethical Sleep and Dreams assignment
furthers professor's political goals
I'm a student enrolled in the popular
"Sleep and Dreams" course lliis quarter
and I would like to comment on an
extremely unethical assignment which is
part of the Sleep and Dreams curricu
lum.
This assignment, a full 10 percent of a
student's grade, is to write a one-page
letter to one's Congressperson urging
that Congress address the problem of
sleep debt and sleep disorders iu our
society.
Now, whether or not sleep debt and
sleep disorders are a serious problem
worthy of Congress's attention is beside
the point. Actually, 1 believe that it is a
serious issue. But, by forcing students to
write letters espousing a single view
point, the professor of Sleep and
Dreams, Dr. William Dement, is uncthi

rally using students to further his own
political agenda.
Dr. Dement lias spent enormous
amounts ol time and eflbrt addressing
the issues ol sleep debt and sleep disor
ders .ind has repeatedly testified before
Congress urging that action be taken to
combat these problems. This assignment
is nothing more than a way for him use
the Sleep and Dreams course to continue
his crusade.
Ihe letters to Congress cannot
espouse a student's individual opinions
ol the subject of sleep debt and sleep dis
orders, but must conform to Dr.
Dement s own views. Indeed, the assign
ment clearly states that the student must,
"convince (longress that there is a serious
problem out there," and part of the
grade is based on how well the student
conveys that message.
Needless to say, it is highly inappro
priate and unethical for a professor to
use his power to grade students as a lever
lor his own political agenda. 'I his consti
tutes a serious breach of academic stan
dards.
Now, to be fair, the letter is not strict
ly mandatory. The assignment adds that
students also have the option of writing a
two to three page report on a specific
sleep disorder, using at least five differ
ent bibliographic sources. Let's see ... a
one page letter, no outside research
required or expected . . . versus a
research report double to triple that
length, with a minumum of five outside
sources needed.
for the average time-strapped Stan
lord student, the very nature of those two
choices puts implicit pressure to choose
the letter to Congress option. The pres
ence ol the second option may somewhat
disguise the political agenda behind this
assignment, but surely Dr. Dement
knows that the vast majority of students
will choose to write the letter rather than
the report simph because of the relative
amounts of work required.
()ver the course of this quarter 1 have
i nine to great I \ respect Dr. Dement for
his academic work and political activism.
But this assignment is most unethical
preciseh because it blurs the line
between the two and taints an academic
course with Dr. Dement s own political
goals.

Sanskriti does as much as it can
Meghana Reddy's passion is com
mendable, but her column (Feb. 10) is
misplaced and inappropriate.
Main of her sentiments echo the frus
trations expressed by South Asian stu
dents over the years: why doesn't San
skriti ever DO anything? The short
answer: it does, to the extent that it can.
for example, the Awaaz conference,
which oc c urs even spring quarter, is one
ol the most insightful series of workshops

I've ever attended regarding problems in
South Asian communities.
But there is more to it than that. San
skriti faces a problem that no other eth
nic group on this campus must deal with:
defining a purpose for its existence. Indi
ans are a jumble of religions, cultures,
histories and languages. Add in Pakista
nis, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis,
Bhutanese and Nepalis, and you've got
one confused "ethnic group" â€” and this
is before you talk about South Asians who
are Ishmaeli, Fijian, Guyanese,
Caribbean, African or first generation in
this country.
Stanford has them all, and Sanskriti,
for all its flaws and Indo-centric orienta
tion, does its best to try to accomodate a
membership base that is more diffuse
than that of any other ethnic group on
campus. Primarily, Sanskriti is, and prob
ably always will be, an organization
searching for an identity; its social events
are simply mechanisms to find a mass
appeal.
This social orientation notwithstand
ing, Reddy's complaints about lack of
activism are misplaced; 1 would argue
that there is more activism in our com
munities than in the overall campus.
Groups such as Saathi, SAPHOP, Pro
ject Dosti, Saheli and Asha draw most of
their membership from the South Asian
communities. Many, many South Asians
on this campus lobby for change, fight
for causes and spread the gospel about
problems in our community and others.
They just don't use Sanskriti as their
vehicle for change.
Reddy's lecture to the community at
large is bold for a student who has been
here for less than two quarters; in fact, it
is entirely inappropriate. Whatever her
perceptions of cliques and crowds (and
they do exist, in our communities as in
every other), she has never met most of
the South Asians on this campus.
The vast majority of us are at most two

generations removed from living side-by
side with (if not in) some of the most
grinding poverty on earth. 1 In our family
memories linger the Bengali famine, the
murderous times of Partition and the
taste, ethnic and religious violence that
still plague our various homelands
(where many of Our families still live).
Contrary to Reddy's assertion, most of
us are keenly aware of our good fortune
and are unable to forget our humble ori
gins and the problems in our communi
ties, both here and abroad. Perhaps she
should talk to some of us before she cate
gorically dismisses us.

The Daily "short-shrifts" Bush's
views on environment
I am not sure why The Daily feels it
needs to inform us that "Environment an
issue in campaign" (Feb. 18). 1 am even
less certain as to why The Daily has to
report on a highly controversial issue as
the "environment" in such a narrow way.
Speaking as someone who lias a lot of
sympathy with George W. Bush's agenda
on this issue, 1 felt The Daily's coverage
of the topic was symptomatic of a rather
conceited and lazy attitude towards what
the left wing likes to call "the environ
ment."
Gov. Bush gets a little yelp at the end
of the article, after four paragraphs of
Gore and Bradley describing the Kyoto
summit as if it were the Eleventh Com
mandment. The reporter's sympathies
are clearly with Gore and Bradley. His
inclusion of Bush's views as an
afterthought just go to show how poorly
standards of journalistic objectivity 112 ur
ther debate.
If The Daily intends to assist political
debate on campus, might I suggest that

it actually try to represent unpopular
views as if they were worth some consid
eration. Otherwise the "Environment an
issue in campaign" article simply
becomes another way for the left wing
on this campus to have its beliefs sooth
ingly massaged.
I believe that the Kyoto plan is noth
ing short of evil. I believe that it will ben
efit China, which has no intention of
cleaning up its act, to the detriment of
American industry. I believe that envi
ronmentalists would sacrifice every
human being for the sake of an unachiev
able world, without asking for permission
and without thinking of the conse
quences.
My views, while popular nationwide,
get short-shrift on this campus, and The
Daily seems quite happy to keep things
this way.
Don't report on national debates
unless you intend to report on them AS
DEBATES.

Land use debate continues
In 1993, 102 Nobel laureates and
1,()()() other scientists warned humankind
that we must "change our stewardship of
the earth ... if vast human misery is to
be avoided . . . Many of our current prac
tices put at serious risk the future that we
wish for human society." Since then, our
global environmental problems have
continued to increase faster than our
efforts to solve them.
Stanford enjoys a well-deserved and
actively maintained reputation as a
"world class university." It has attracted
some of the nation's best scientists, com
puter modelers, conservation biologists
and environmental policy experts.
And yet Stanford is proposing that in

order to maintain its status in the
world, it needs to build another four
million square feet and add another
2,200 students, faculty and stall (plus
their spouses and children) to an
already overcrowded area thai is strug
gling to maintain its quality of lile and
few remaining open spaces.
If so many in the global scientific
community can agree on the magnitude
of the problems facing humankind,
surely it is time for a university that
aspires to be "world class" to begin
responding to that reality by modeling
appropriate answers.
We need academic pioneers who can
demonstrate ecological innovation and
develop new technologies without con
suming ever more natural resources
and open space. We need Stanford to
embody the limits to physical growth
that are now confronting the entire
globe and show us that such limits need
not stilie intellectual creativity and
invention, but quite to the contrary, can
engender them.
