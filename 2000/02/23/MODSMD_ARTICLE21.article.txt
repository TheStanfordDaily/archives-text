## Epic win by the numbers 
### 
By now, main of you have
seen some ol the absurd
numbers Irom the men's
basketball "game"
against Cal this past weekend.
Domination of the sort we wit
nessed on Saturday lends itself to
this sort ol number crunching
and milestone-marking, and so
you see that Cal finished with
more turnovers (20) than iissists
(18), that we shot .f>oo from the H
point line to ('.al's . I 88, that (lal
had never lost to anyone, much
less theii hated and feared rival,
I love those stats. I could
crunch those numbers all clay.
When you see that Stanford's
starting five shot — get reach foi
this — .781 from the floor, you've
gotta smile. When you see that
('.al's starting five shot — even
more fun — .290 from the lloor,
you've gotta dance.
I started thinking midwav
through the game that just look
ing to basketball lor comparisons
isn't good enough. A demolition
like this demands absurd compar
isons. Where does this accom
plishment lit in all of sports?
Consider the score: 101-30.
For every point that the\ scored,
we scored two.
Let's sav the two teams had run

a marathon, and Stanford did
twice as well as Cal. I lie world
record in the marathon is two
hours, six minutes, five seconds,
so let's be humble and say we fin
ished in two hours, HO minutes
flat. I hat means that our team
would have had time to take the
victor's podium, shower up, do a
couple interviews, run out to Safe
way, pic k up a couple of steaks
and some charcoal, marinate,
cook 'em up, and greet the Cal
runnels with some tastv I -bones
fresh off the BBQ pit when they
arrived, hulling and pulling.
Perhaps another metaphor
w ill serve better. Imagine our two
squads as golfers, <>ui for a dav's
fun at Pebble Beach. The course is
a par 72. We will be generous and
imagine ourselves as finishing the
day perhaps four strokes under.
Kxtrapolating Cal's score, they
finish the clav with a KU>, putting
their handicap at approximately
64.
Sean l.anipley, Cal's best play
er. was the only man to store iu
double figures lor the Colden
Bears. He had 10 points, and
every one of them came in the
first half. I<> continue oil this
metaphorical jaunt through


Jeff Cooper
sport, imagine Stanford and (lal's
lootball teams locked in battle.
Lample\ averages I .">.B points per
game; (lal running ba( k |oe Igber
averages (>li. I yards per game. So
in ibis mythical liig (iaiue, lgbei
manages to s< ramble Ibi a big 20
yards in the lii si hall and then
never crosses the line ol scrim
mage again. And lie's the best of
lensive option (lal has.
We've talked team - what
about individual performances?
David Moseley was 10-12 on Sat
urday, which works out to an .S.'W

shooting percentage. Moselev
was averaging a . shooting
percentage coining into Satur
days game. Let's use baseball
tei ins. tor the Amci icans in the
audience — that's Randy Johnson
(10. I strikeouls/gaine) coming
into, say, San Francisco, and
putting up 20 k s on the day.
|cez, that's almost a record or
soniething.
You can play this game all da\.
(la I used Hi players against Stan
lord. I hey ve only got 17 guy s on
the roster. (Lan you imagine a situa
tion in which lyrone would use,
oh, KS players in one lootball game,
even Ibi one play? You'd need to
run shuttles to move that mam
guvs on and oil the sidelines.
In the end, the most telling

metaphors max be in the world ol
basketball aftei all. liefore Satur
da\. Stanford was averaging 77
points a game: ( <il was averaging
7.").5. I he average NIV\ team, as
ol todav, was averaging 97.f>
points a game. So imagine turn
ing on Sport sCei iter and seeing a
Kings (Celtics game with the score
I 2N-(il>.
M\ friends, I can tell you what
111;11 is in onl> two words: a blud
geoning.
\ K)t c>l sportsw liters hate the
freakish games; tliev'd rather
watch a closely-fought, down-to
the-uiie game with perfect fun
damentals and chess-like coac li
iug moves.
Not me. I here 's something
about the fifiv-poini wins that ap

peals to the six-year-old in me.
Call it a guv thing; I like to see - ■
things blown up bigger, thrown
farther, ground into the tiniest of jj
tin\ pieces. 11 takes me back to the
days when one could win argu
ments In demanding, "What?

I Itron's weak little adamantiiun- •

flat. I hat means that our team
would have had time to take the
victor's podium, shower up, do a
couple interviews, run out to Safe
way, pic k up a couple of steaks
and some charcoal, marinate,
cook 'em up, and greet the Cal
runnels with some tastv I -bones
fresh off the BBQ pit when they
arrived, hulling and pulling.
Perhaps another metaphor
w ill serve better. Imagine our two
squads as golfers, <>ui for a dav's
fun at Pebble Beach. The course is
a par 72. We will be generous and
imagine ourselves as finishing the
day perhaps four strokes under.
Kxtrapolating Cal's score, they
finish the clav with a KU>, putting
their handicap at approximately
64.
Sean l.anipley, Cal's best play
er. was the only man to store iu
double figures lor the Colden
Bears. He had 10 points, and
every one of them came in the
first half. I<> continue oil this

We've talked team - what
about individual performances?
David Moseley was 10-12 on Sat
urday, which works out to an .S.'W

shooting percentage. Moselev
was averaging a . shooting
percentage coining into Satur
days game. Let's use baseball
tei ins. tor the Amci icans in the
audience — that's Randy Johnson
(10. I strikeouls/gaine) coming
into, say, San Francisco, and
putting up 20 k s on the day.
|cez, that's almost a record or
soniething.
You can play this game all da\.

oh, KS players in one lootball game,
even Ibi one play? You'd need to
run shuttles to move that mam

In the end, the most telling
