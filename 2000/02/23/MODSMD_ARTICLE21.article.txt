## Epic win by the numbers 
### 
By now, main of you have
seen some ol the absurd
numbers Irom the men's
basketball "game"
against Cal this past weekend.
Domination of the sort we wit
nessed on Saturday lends itself to
this sort ol number crunching
and milestone-marking, and so
you see that Cal finished with
more turnovers (20) than iissists
(18), that we shot .f>oo from the H
point line to ('.al's . I 88, that (lal
had never lost to anyone, much
less theii hated and feared rival,
I love those stats. I could
crunch those numbers all clay.
When you see that Stanford's
starting five shot — get reach foi
this — .781 from the floor, you've
gotta smile. When you see that
('.al's starting five shot — even
more fun — .290 from the lloor,
you've gotta dance.
I started thinking midwav
through the game that just look
ing to basketball lor comparisons
isn't good enough. A demolition
like this demands absurd compar
isons. Where does this accom
plishment lit in all of sports?
Consider the score: 101-30.
For every point that the\ scored,
we scored two.
Let's sav the two teams had run

a marathon, and Stanford did
twice as well as Cal. I lie world
record in the marathon is two
hours, six minutes, five seconds,
so let's be humble and say we fin
ished in two hours, HO minutes
flat. I hat means that our team
would have had time to take the
victor's podium, shower up, do a
couple interviews, run out to Safe
way, pic k up a couple of steaks
and some charcoal, marinate,
cook 'em up, and greet the Cal
runnels with some tastv I -bones
fresh off the BBQ pit when they
arrived, hulling and pulling.
Perhaps another metaphor
w ill serve better. Imagine our two
squads as golfers, <>ui for a dav's
fun at Pebble Beach. The course is
a par 72. We will be generous and
imagine ourselves as finishing the
day perhaps four strokes under.
Kxtrapolating Cal's score, they
finish the clav with a KU>, putting
their handicap at approximately
64.
Sean l.anipley, Cal's best play
er. was the only man to store iu
double figures lor the Colden
Bears. He had 10 points, and
every one of them came in the
first half. I<> continue oil this
metaphorical jaunt through
