# Rowe shines for Stanford at Waikoloa
## 
### MATT LONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Friday the Stanford men's golf team teed up
against a backdrop of clear skies and crashing waves
and demonstrated just how talented they are. As the
weekend produced a steady downpour in Palo Alto,
Stanford's No. 12 ranked duffers played in sunshine
at the Waikoloa Intercollegiate in Hilo, Hawaii.
Though they finished in eighth place for the three
day tournament, the Cardinal shot a cumulative one
under on the Waikoloa Beach Course Friday, sec ur
ing the best score of the day.
1 he tournament consisted of 24 teams, 1 I of which
hold spots in the top 30 nationally, including tourna
ment champion and No. 1 ranked Georgia lech.
Stanford tied for ISth place after the first day of the
match, shooting a 299 at the King's course, the more
challenging of the two courses used in the tourna
ment. After its superior second round, the Cardinal
squeezed into eighth place going into the final round,
ten over par and 18 shots behind leader Georgia
l ec h, which had already built a si/able lead.
"In team golf, il you play average golf and every
one else does too, you stay in the same place," said
Stanford head coach Walk Goodwin.
Stanford must have played average golf then, as
the team llew back to the mainland with an eighth
place finish overall and a final round 307, a round
which was marred b\ high scores clue to the heavy
winds of the clay. Winds of 20 to 30 mph, lava lined
fairways and fast putting surfaces interac ted to pro
duce unlamiliai conditions lor the team. I he squad's
score, however, reflects its mental toughness in han
dling the change.
"It was a way better than average trip," Goodwin
said. "We may have clone five or six shots better with
out mental mistakes, but rapport was awesome, there
w as some great bonding and almost everyone played
within a shot or so ol his ability."
Stanford's top individual finisher was sophomore
Philip Rowe. ranked No. 153 nationally. Rowetied for
seventh place with an even pat 214, six shots behind
Georgia lech's dual medal lists, Bryce Moler and
Matt Kuc bar, ranked No. 2 and No. f> respectively.
"I had a fantastic time in I lawaii." Rowe said." I hit
a lot of greens and didn't make too many mistakes. I
did better than my previous performances."
Goodwin attributes Rowe's sudden improvement
to linalh adjusting to life at Stanlbrd after transfer
ring this vear. Rowe is from (ireat Britain and played
lor Kxeter I Diversity last year.
"Rowe has now settled into school," (.oodwin says.
"I le should have a great future lor us."
Rowe concurs, admitting that
"when I first came I found myself
rushing with classes and sc hool
work and practice. Now 1 can
compose myself in between each
and I can work on golf, concen
trate on improving. 1 have adjust
ed to the team and the lifestyle,
like having to work out at 7 am
every morning.' 1 am also thinking
more positively"
Junior Jimmy Lee was second
on the team with a 220, tying for
26th place. Next came Stanford's
top ranked golfer, senior captain
Dusty Brett, ranked No. H) na
tionally. Brett shot a 224, good
enough to tie for 44tli place.
Rounding out scoring lor the Car
dinal were junior Alex Aragon at
229and freshman Jim Seki at 242.

"1 played pretty well but didn't
score well," Brett said. "I hit well
but had a tough time with the
greens. They were a different type
of grass, Bermuda, and you have
to read the green and break,
which adds a lot to think about.
\V'e played well in one round, but
didn't put it together."
I lie team now has seen how it
has to play to reach the highest
caliber, and the next couple of
weeks will indicate whether the
team can consistently play at this
level. Coaches and players all ac
knowledge the necessity of im
proving the short game and
avoiding costly mental errors.
With the emergence of players
such as Rowe and with the rest of
the team following in the wake of
established winners like Brett,
Stanford can move into a position
to secure a spot in their first
NCAA championships in four
years, their ultimate goal.
