# Pro tour lures underclassmen

### SAMEER AHMED CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In recent years, there has
been a lot of debate over the de
cision of college athletes, espe
cially basketball and football
players, to leave school early and
go to the pros.
At Stanford, however, many
athletes have left the s( hool early
in a dilferent sport: men's tennis.
Perhaps the most famous
Stanlord tennis player who did
not graduate was |olm Mc Enroe,
who won the NCAA singles
championship in 1978 and then
the I S ()pen a year later. But in
the past decade alone, live men's
tennis players have left the
school early to enter the pro cir
c 11it. Most recently, twins Mike
and Bob Bryan, both two-time
All-Americans and NCAA cham
pions, decided to depart from
Stanford after their sophomore
year in 1998.
What drives college tennis
players like the Bryan brothers
to join the A 1 1' tour without
graduating? fhe major reasons
are derived from the fact that the
dynamics ol college tennis are
dilferent than any other colle
giate sport.
First of all, main professional

tennis players do not even go to
college. American tennis star
Michael Chang started plaving
on the pro tour when he was 15
vears old. In addition. I'ete .Sam
pras, one ol the greatest tennis
players of all time, won the I S
()pen when he was <>nl\ 19. And
McEnroe was a top world tennis
player before he even came to
Stanford.
"Because |McEnroe] was a
semifinalist at Wimbledon before
coming to Stanford, I assumed
that he wouldn't be here lour
years," head coach Dick Clonic!
said. "I was hoping he'd be here
the one vear he said he was going
to."
I lowever, McEnroe is the ex
ception to the rule. Gould has
never recruited anyone who
didn't tell him they wanted to go
to Stanford for all lour vears.
Secondly, in tenuis, a player
can be an amateur and have a
professional ranking at the same
time. Dining the summer and
lall quarter, main collegiate ten
nis players compete in profes
sional events. I herelbre, they
have the ability to rank them
selves against the pros. Some
plavers who play well in the sum

iner might not even come back to
school.
Stan lord men's tennis is unique
in that almost every athlete who
plays at Stanford will become a
professional tennis player at some
point in his lile.
"My top seven, eight, or nine
guys are all going to play pro ten
nis," (ioultl said. "It's just a inattei
of when they are going to do it.
I hey are playing |on the pro tour|
now in the summer and they are
going to play it before grad st hool.'
finally, collegiate tennis is
unic|ue because there are not only
team rankings but also individual
rankings. Additionally, there arc
two separate NdAA tournaments,
one lor the teams and one lor the
individuals. So while eat Ii player
is competing for his team, he is
also playing to better his individ
ual ranking at the end ol the ycai
and a chance to be an N(IAA
< banipit>n.
Winning an N(IAA champi
onship seems to be key latToi in
many players' decisions to entci
theprotoui without graduating.
"| Leav ing earlyj was probably
the toughest decision of tan lile,"
Uob Bryan said referring to him
self and his brother. "After win
ning the NCiAA championship,
agents olfei you high-paying ton
tracts and vou don't know il you
will get the same opportunity next
year. Mike and I decided to join
the tour and keep improving 0111
games."

197 I, lei t Stan lord eai l\ alter his ju
nioi \car to start a 5-year pro career
in which he was ranked in the top

bles. W'hitlinger reiterated Hob
Bryan's point about the importance
ol winning an NCAA champi
onship when (letiding logo pro.
"I felt I was ready to go and
play <>n the torn ," VV'liitlinger said.
"Looking back at it, I probably
should have turned pro altei I
won the N(iAA 11ipic* (towii aliei
111 \ sophomore vcai 01 staved all
lour years."
In general, (ioultl believes the
most ol)\ioiis reason ili.it colle
giate tennis players leave early is
pride.
" I here is something inside
I hem when | the) see J their friends
who have left school, or who have
not gone to school, and have done
well in the pros that makes them
want to get out there and test iheii
abilities," (ioultl said.
Lven il players leave s< hool
early t<» play professional tennis,
do the\ have an advantage ovei
the plavcrs who tlet ided to stay all
lour years?
(ioultl believes that, in general,
sta\ ing in st liool hasn't hurt the
progress of an v ol the players on the
pro torn . While (ioultl admits that
it takes about a vear and a half lor a
graduated player to catch up to
other (oinpetitors his age, he (itcs
Paul (ioldstein and Alex (VBrien, a
current I S Davis (!up member, as
two Stanford tennis players who
stayed on the farm lor loin vears
and are now having solid piolcs
si< >i lal careers.
(ioldstein, an unprecedented
lour-t ime All-Ainei ic an who
helped Stanford win (bin straight

M) ( .). r > to 199N, is currently ranked
No. '.) ! in the world and lias won
over $;J()(),()()() in prize money on
the tout. While (ioldstein does not
totally disagree with (iould's as
sessment, he believes that staying
ins( liool might have hurt his ten
nis career in some aspects while
helping it in olhers.
"I don't regret staying |at Stan
ford! ' 01 lour years at all," C.old
stein said. "Kmotionally I think it
was real good for me. W : ien
you're out on the tour and lose
three to four matches and you
don't have a win lor six or seven
weeks, w lii< li is inevitablv going to
happen, I'm not going to think
'Jeez, I should've stayed in school.'
" I hough, from a tennis stand
point, I think for the first six lo
eight months out there I lelt I was
making np ground a lot, and per
haps I could've been developing if
I was on tour."
At the same time, Bob Bryan,
who has won over S—()(),()()() in
prize monc) and is currently
ranked .'loth in doubles with his
brother, does not have many re
grets leaving Stanford early either.
"While I miss my friends, at
Stanford and could have easily
slaved four years, Mike and I |iisi
bought a new house, new cars,
and we're traveling .ill ovei the
world," Bob Bryan said. "We're
living our dreams beating guvs we
used to watch on TV."
However, for the most part,
(»ould advises the players that
leav ing early will not substantially
bettei thcil pro careers, first of
all. (iould states that the average
pro career lor a male tennis playci
is seven to nine years, and the typ
ical player reaches his prime when

lie is 29 «>i .'?(). I herelorc, il a ten
nis player graduates from col lege
when lie is 22, on avei age, his ten
nis career will finish just ;is lie
reac lies his prime.
Secondly, (iould believes that
the players should not least' early
loi the prize money because the
prize money keeps on getting bet
ter each veai.
I he player v\ho will likely be
laced with this decision is sopho
more K. | I lippensteel. ()nl\ in
his second veai on the team, I lip
pensteel was an \lI-.American and

an \( AA doubles champion as a
freshman, and has been the No. I
c ollcgc plavci in the country lor
most ol t his year.
"li s tough thinking about leas
ing earlyl lippensteel said.
"While it has always been m\
dream to become a pro, as long as
I keep improving, I'm staying
here. M\ goal right now is to be-
No. lat the end ol tlie season and
win the N( AAc hampionship."
I lippensteel also c ited academ
ic reasons about why he wants to
graduate from Stanford.

"I also have goals alter tennis,"
I lippeiisteel said. "I want to be an
astronaut. That's another reason I
came to Stanford instead of some
other school. Stanford has a great
combination of academics and
athletics."
However, if Hippensteel wins
an NCAA championship in the
next two years, he might be per
suaded I>\ the sports agents and
iluii lucrative contracts to leave
Stanford, like the Bryan brothers
and other Stanford men's tennis
plavers before them.
