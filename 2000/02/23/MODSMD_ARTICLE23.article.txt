In recent years, there has
been a lot of debate over the de
cision of college athletes, espe
cially basketball and football
players, to leave school early and
go to the pros.
At Stanford, however, many
athletes have left the s( hool early
in a dilferent sport: men's tennis.
Perhaps the most famous
Stanlord tennis player who did
not graduate was |olm Mc Enroe,
who won the NCAA singles
championship in 1978 and then
the I S ()pen a year later. But in
the past decade alone, live men's
tennis players have left the
school early to enter the pro cir
c 11it. Most recently, twins Mike
and Bob Bryan, both two-time
All-Americans and NCAA cham
pions, decided to depart from
Stanford after their sophomore
year in 1998.
What drives college tennis
players like the Bryan brothers
to join the A 1 1' tour without
graduating? fhe major reasons
are derived from the fact that the
dynamics ol college tennis are
dilferent than any other colle
giate sport.
First of all, main professional

tennis players do not even go to
college. American tennis star
Michael Chang started plaving
on the pro tour when he was 15
vears old. In addition. I'ete .Sam
pras, one ol the greatest tennis
players of all time, won the I S
()pen when he was <>nl\ 19. And
McEnroe was a top world tennis
player before he even came to
Stanford.
"Because |McEnroe] was a
semifinalist at Wimbledon before
coming to Stanford, I assumed
that he wouldn't be here lour
years," head coach Dick Clonic!
said. "I was hoping he'd be here
the one vear he said he was going
to."
I lowever, McEnroe is the ex
ception to the rule. Gould has
never recruited anyone who
didn't tell him they wanted to go
to Stanford for all lour vears.
Secondly, in tenuis, a player
can be an amateur and have a
professional ranking at the same
time. Dining the summer and
lall quarter, main collegiate ten
nis players compete in profes
sional events. I herelbre, they
have the ability to rank them
selves against the pros. Some
plavers who play well in the sum
