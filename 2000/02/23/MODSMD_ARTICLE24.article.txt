Pepperdine on Thursday and a de

Maryinount last Friday, the Cardi
nal looked to be climbing out oi its
earlv season slump that spiraled the
squad into a six-game losing streak.
But a weak start hist night may
have given Stanford fans a slight
case of deja vu as the Cardinal
made a few sloppv mistakes and
struggled to prevent Auteater
streaks. In game one Stanford
watched a 3-1 lead turn into a 3-6
chase from behind. A three point
Auteater run later in the game
brought the Cardinal to 9-Li and
Irvine closed out the game uithout
much of a fight.
"We didn't like the wax we start
ed out," head coach Ruben Nieves

said. "We thought li vine gol oil to
a last start because lhe\ came out
realK hustling" on delcnse. I lie
biggest difference was all the digs
the\ made and all the digs we didn't
make."
Instead of discouraging Stan
lord's squad, the 11 list rating begin
ning gave the team the spark it
needed to halt its descent back into
a slump.
At the start of game two, a three
point streak served In freshman
outside hitter Billv Strickland and

Skacel gave Stanford an earlv 4-2
lead. Stanford dominated the rest
of the game until Irvine survived

"It took us a little while to get

Youngberg. "We picked up our de

the dillerence."

Youngberg, who sal out the
match against I.MI with a back in

squad with his entrance into the
match at the end of game one.

"Brett coining oil the bench re

and the middles aren't producing,
we bring Brett oil the bench."
