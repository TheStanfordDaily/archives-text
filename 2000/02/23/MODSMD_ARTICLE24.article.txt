### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
1 lie u 11 ranked Stanford men's
volleyball team (6-7, ()-5 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) beat its
third ranked team in a week last
night with a 11-15, 15-10, 15-11,
15-() victory over the No. 15 UC
lrvine Anteaters (6-8, 'i-(j).
Alter a strong light against No. .3
Pepperdine on Thursday and a de
cisive upset over No. 9 Loyola
Maryinount last Friday, the Cardi
nal looked to be climbing out oi its
earlv season slump that spiraled the
squad into a six-game losing streak.
But a weak start hist night may
have given Stanford fans a slight
case of deja vu as the Cardinal
made a few sloppv mistakes and
struggled to prevent Auteater
streaks. In game one Stanford
watched a 3-1 lead turn into a 3-6
chase from behind. A three point
Auteater run later in the game
brought the Cardinal to 9-Li and
Irvine closed out the game uithout
much of a fight.
"We didn't like the wax we start
ed out," head coach Ruben Nieves

said. "We thought li vine gol oil to
a last start because lhe\ came out
realK hustling" on delcnse. I lie
biggest difference was all the digs
the\ made and all the digs we didn't
make."
Instead of discouraging Stan
lord's squad, the 11 list rating begin
ning gave the team the spark it
needed to halt its descent back into
a slump.
At the start of game two, a three
point streak served In freshman
outside hitter Billv Strickland and
fueled b\ two definitive kills bv
sophomore outside hitter Marcus
Skacel gave Stanford an earlv 4-2
lead. Stanford dominated the rest
of the game until Irvine survived
lour game points before Stanford
linall\ put ihcgameawav.
"It took us a little while to get
lired up, but once we got going we
prett\ much controlled the match,"'
said junioi middle blocker Brett
Youngberg. "We picked up our de
lense and bloc king and that made
the dillerence."
Stanford's bench and injurv re
serves contributed to the come
from behind boost that carried the

(lardinal to victoi v.
Youngberg, who sal out the
match against I.MI with a back in
jurv, helped revitalize the Stanford
squad with his entrance into the
match at the end of game one.
Youngberg has been a vital part of
the Cardinal oflense this season
posting 109 kills good enough lor
third behind freshman Curt l op
pel (,'WO) and Skacel (17b). Last
night Youngberg notched lf> kills
and the strongest hitting percent
age (.019) of the night. I le also led
the team in blocks with four.
"Brett coining oil the bench re
ally gave the team a lili," Nieves
said. "I le s a starter who's not start
ing, so if things aren't going well
and the middles aren't producing,
we bring Brett oil the bench."

But a weak start hist night may
have given Stanford fans a slight
case of deja vu as the Cardinal
made a few sloppv mistakes and
struggled to prevent Auteater
streaks. In game one Stanford
watched a 3-1 lead turn into a 3-6
chase from behind. A three point
Auteater run later in the game
brought the Cardinal to 9-Li and
Irvine closed out the game uithout
much of a fight.
"We didn't like the wax we start
ed out," head coach Ruben Nieves

said. "We thought li vine gol oil to
a last start because lhe\ came out
realK hustling" on delcnse. I lie
biggest difference was all the digs
the\ made and all the digs we didn't
make."
Instead of discouraging Stan
lord's squad, the 11 list rating begin
ning gave the team the spark it
needed to halt its descent back into
a slump.
At the start of game two, a three
point streak served In freshman
outside hitter Billv Strickland and
fueled b\ two definitive kills bv
sophomore outside hitter Marcus
Skacel gave Stanford an earlv 4-2
lead. Stanford dominated the rest
of the game until Irvine survived
lour game points before Stanford

"It took us a little while to get
lired up, but once we got going we
prett\ much controlled the match,"'
said junioi middle blocker Brett
Youngberg. "We picked up our de
lense and bloc king and that made
the dillerence."
Stanford's bench and injurv re
serves contributed to the come

Youngberg, who sal out the
match against I.MI with a back in

squad with his entrance into the
match at the end of game one.
Youngberg has been a vital part of
the Cardinal oflense this season
posting 109 kills good enough lor

the team in blocks with four.
"Brett coining oil the bench re

said. "I le s a starter who's not start

and the middles aren't producing,
we bring Brett oil the bench."
