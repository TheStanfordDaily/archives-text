Behind Stanford's 1 ( .)'.)7 men's

It was Mike l.amhei I, then a se

driven In a desire to he the third

*97.
" I bought everyone a cigar and
told them to put it somewhere
where they could see it and smell
it everyday and think how nice it
would be to be smoking it after we
won," Lambert said. "It's lunin
how something so sillv turned
into something we could attach to
and give it meaning. At time-outs
sometimes we'd just say 'cigar'."
Compounded with his colle
giate career totals that placed him

No. 2 ill kills (2,083) and aces
(1 12) and No. lin blocks (373) on
Stanford's all-time list, it was that
kind ol team spirit oil the court
that set Lambert apart from the

After leading Stanford to its 1997 NCAA title, alumnus
Mike Lambert now is looking to lead his team to Olympic
gold.
the U.S. out of the top three and
kept the squad from securing an
Olympic bid. But wins over tradi
tional volleyball powerhouses
Brazil, Italy, ('uba, and Argentina
at the Cup gave the team confi
dence that helped propel them to
a victory at the (Continental Cup in
January.
The team spiked, stuffed and
dug its way to the top of the tour
nament and into the ()1\ mpics by
gliding over Puerto Rico, Mexico
and Canada. Lambert was named
MVP of the tournament as his
3.083 kills-per-game and .458 hit
ting percentage put him second
only to Pepperdine graduate
George Roumain. A defensive
Ibrce as well, Lambert notched
..">B3 blocks-per-game to lead the
squad.
Being on top is nothing new for
Lambert who has consistently es

tablished his presence as a domi
nating force on the court whether
it be playing for the country or for
the Cardinal.
"His best skill is spiking, he's
gifted to the point where he can
spike at net or in the back row,"
Nieves said. "But what makes
Mike special is he's also a very
complete player. He has good ball
control, the ability to pass, receive
serve and he has very good block
ing instincts."
Sure enough, this man of many
skills earned All-MPSF and Ail-
American honors his sophomore
and junior year. As a junior, Lam
bert dominated the team across
the board leading in kills (623),
aces (36), while placing second in
digs (174) and blocks (103). After
his junior year the ()lympics came
calling and Lambert took off a
year from Stanford to represent
the U.S. as the only undergradu
ate player on the National Team.
Despite his age, Lambert shoul
dered much of the offensive load
in Atlanta and his 91 kills at the

Games led the team.
But before he could stay with
the National learn full-time,
there were two more things Lam
bert needed — a NCAA c hampi
onship and a Stanford degree. In
1997, he earned both.
His sisters, Debbie (Stanlbrd)
and Mia (UCLA), each had their
own NCAA volleyball title and now
it was Mike's turn. All the ingredi
ents were there: a near-flawless 22-
3 season, a c rop of talented players,
and a strong coaching stall. Lam
bert's international experience and
burning desire for a championship
was the icing on the cake.
"Although some of the stats
don't show it, [Lambert's] best
year of volleyball was his senior
year," Nieves said. "His maturity,
leadership, ability to perform
under pressure, and locus had ad
vanced greatly as would be ex
pected after a year playing with
the best players in the country,
against the best teams in the
world."
After a grueling five-game

match against UCLA, Stanford fi
nally secured its first ever men's
volleyball title.
"The team banquet was glori
ous," said Lambert, who was
named MVP of the final Four for
his team-leading 27 kills in the
championship match. "Lighting
our cigars was one of my proudest
moments. Sitting there knowing
we did it, pretending to be .ill big
time — it was very gratifying."
Lambert, who was named by
the 1 )aily one of the sexiest men at
Stanford in 1997, left behind a leg
end on the court and an attitude
off the court that won't soon be
forgotten at Stanford.
"He brought intensity to the
court that hasn't been matched
here since," said current senior
captain Josh Palacios, the only re
maining player from the 1997
championship squad. "I remem
ber 1 met him on my recruiting
trip. He shook my hand and his
hand just engulfed mine."
"112 rom day one at Stanford he
was a star volleyball player,"

Nieves said. "But he was most
comfortable when his team got the
praise. He always had a very good
understanding of how important
the team was to personal success
and he always showed his appreci
ation."
for all that this champion gave
Stanford, Lambert remembers
the experience that Stanlbrd gave
him in return as preparation lor
the next level of competition.
"We had a good recruiting
class," Lambert said citing stand
out teammate Matt Fuerbringer.
"Stanford attracts talent and plays
the top schools. It was good learn
ing ground, but the international
level is a big jump. It's so much
faster, more intense, it takes years
to get good at it."
It seems that Lambert, who was
named National Team MVP in
1999, has figured it out in three
and hopefully in the fall this Stan
lord grad will have one more
medal to add to his collection and
one more stogie to smoke in cele
bration.

After leading Stanford to its 1997 NCAA title, alumnus
Mike Lambert now is looking to lead his team to Olympic
gold.
the U.S. out of the top three and
kept the squad from securing an
Olympic bid. But wins over tradi
tional volleyball powerhouses
Brazil, Italy, ('uba, and Argentina
at the Cup gave the team confi
dence that helped propel them to
a victory at the (Continental Cup in
January.
The team spiked, stuffed and
dug its way to the top of the tour
nament and into the ()1\ mpics by
gliding over Puerto Rico, Mexico
and Canada. Lambert was named
MVP of the tournament as his
3.083 kills-per-game and .458 hit
ting percentage put him second
only to Pepperdine graduate
George Roumain. A defensive
Ibrce as well, Lambert notched
..">B3 blocks-per-game to lead the
squad.
Being on top is nothing new for
Lambert who has consistently es

tablished his presence as a domi
nating force on the court whether
it be playing for the country or for
the Cardinal.
"His best skill is spiking, he's
gifted to the point where he can
spike at net or in the back row,"
Nieves said. "But what makes
Mike special is he's also a very
complete player. He has good ball
control, the ability to pass, receive
serve and he has very good block
ing instincts."
Sure enough, this man of many
skills earned All-MPSF and Ail-
American honors his sophomore
and junior year. As a junior, Lam
bert dominated the team across
the board leading in kills (623),
aces (36), while placing second in
digs (174) and blocks (103). After
his junior year the ()lympics came
calling and Lambert took off a
year from Stanford to represent
the U.S. as the only undergradu
ate player on the National Team.
Despite his age, Lambert shoul
dered much of the offensive load
in Atlanta and his 91 kills at the

Games led the team.
But before he could stay with
the National learn full-time,
there were two more things Lam
bert needed — a NCAA c hampi
onship and a Stanford degree. In
1997, he earned both.
His sisters, Debbie (Stanlbrd)
and Mia (UCLA), each had their
own NCAA volleyball title and now
it was Mike's turn. All the ingredi
ents were there: a near-flawless 22-
3 season, a c rop of talented players,
and a strong coaching stall. Lam
bert's international experience and
burning desire for a championship
was the icing on the cake.
"Although some of the stats
don't show it, [Lambert's] best
year of volleyball was his senior
year," Nieves said. "His maturity,
leadership, ability to perform
under pressure, and locus had ad
vanced greatly as would be ex
pected after a year playing with
the best players in the country,
against the best teams in the
world."
After a grueling five-game

match against UCLA, Stanford fi
nally secured its first ever men's
volleyball title.
"The team banquet was glori
ous," said Lambert, who was
named MVP of the final Four for
his team-leading 27 kills in the
championship match. "Lighting
our cigars was one of my proudest
moments. Sitting there knowing
we did it, pretending to be .ill big
time — it was very gratifying."
Lambert, who was named by
the 1 )aily one of the sexiest men at
Stanford in 1997, left behind a leg
end on the court and an attitude
off the court that won't soon be
forgotten at Stanford.
"He brought intensity to the
court that hasn't been matched
here since," said current senior
captain Josh Palacios, the only re
maining player from the 1997
championship squad. "I remem
ber 1 met him on my recruiting
trip. He shook my hand and his
hand just engulfed mine."
"112 rom day one at Stanford he
was a star volleyball player,"

Nieves said. "But he was most
comfortable when his team got the
praise. He always had a very good
understanding of how important
the team was to personal success
and he always showed his appreci
ation."
for all that this champion gave
Stanford, Lambert remembers
the experience that Stanlbrd gave
him in return as preparation lor
the next level of competition.
"We had a good recruiting
class," Lambert said citing stand
out teammate Matt Fuerbringer.
"Stanford attracts talent and plays
the top schools. It was good learn
ing ground, but the international
level is a big jump. It's so much
faster, more intense, it takes years
to get good at it."
It seems that Lambert, who was
named National Team MVP in
1999, has figured it out in three
and hopefully in the fall this Stan
lord grad will have one more
medal to add to his collection and
one more stogie to smoke in cele
bration.
