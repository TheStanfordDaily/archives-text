# Cal barely downs men's gymnastics

### SCOTT FINKELSTEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Even though the Stanford men's gymnastics
team fell to the California Bears last Saturday for
the fourth time this season, spirits remain high
on the Cardinal squad.
In the dual meet competition, both teams set
season-high scores, but No. 5 Cal (7-0,7-0 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) easily outdis
tanced No. 13 Stanford (4-5,4-5) by a final score
0f227.675 to 223.300.
The Bears were led by Freshman Michael
Ashe, who secured first place in the pommel
horse (9.95), high bar (9.925) and the all-around
(57.675). Cal gymnasts dominated most events,
earning top honors in five of the six competitive
events.
Despite the loss to the Bears, Stanford had its
best showing of the season, improving its team
score by over three points.
"The good news is that we improved three
points over our previous top score and hit over
50 percent of our routines," said senior co-cap

tain Craig Nesbitt. "Both are encouraging signs
of improvement."
Leading the way for Stanford was senior All-
American Jason katsampes. katsampes turned
in a solid performance and posted a season high
all-around score of 57.15, earning him second
place behind (lal's Ashe.
As a team, the Cardinal scored exceptionally
well on parallel bars (38.3) with sophomore
David Durante and Katsampes posting solid
scores of 9.65. The team was also solid on rings
(38.45), where freshman Marshall Erwin earned
first place with a 9.85. Stanford is now ranked
fourth in the nation on rings and fifth on paral
lel bars.
" The guys did a great job on rings and paral
lel bars," said Stanford head coach Sadao 1 lama
da. "But in order to get to the top, we need to
perform much better on the other four events."
• Two events that continue to plague the Car
dinal are pommel horse and high bar. Stanford
is ranked 15th in the country in both of these
events. Drastic improvements on these events
alone will push the team far up in the rankings.

"High bar and pommel horse have not been
improving and continue to produce low scenes
because we are not hitting routines at all." \es
bitt said. "With those events, people are going to
have to hit."
"We just need to lot us on hitting ever\ rou
tine but also keep our minds set on minimizing
small deductions," said junior Reshad C »aran.
Stanford will get two chances to improve ii>>

"Having two meets, two days in a row, in two
locations that are over 300 miles apart is pi< >ba
