# Palo Alto City Council tries to curb panhandling
## 
### JENICE WILSON 
The Palo Alto City Council enacted
a safety ordinance banning panhan
dling on streets and median strips yes
terday, despite opposition from Palo
Alto residents, Stanford students, and
lour council members,
"It's targeting a population we have
already marginalized," said junior
Dorcas (Iheng, a member of the home
less advocacy organization Night Out
reach. The student group presented a
petition of 254 signatures to the coun
cil stating that no substantial evidence
exist s to prove the homeless are of any
threat to the safety of passing vehicles.
" The activity of soliciting employ
ment, business or contributions from

occupants of vehicles distracts drivers
from their primary duties to .. . watch
traffic and be alert for possible traffic or
pedestrian hazards ...," the text of the
ordinance reads.
All of the Palo Alto community
members who spoke at the meeting op
posed the ordinance.
"If this is about safety, why don't we
simply prohibit standing in these areas
.period?" asked Paul Gilbert, a Palo
Alto resident. "If the concern is truly
safety, then it seems to me we should be
consistent about it."
In response to accusations that the
ordinance is specifically directed to
ward the homeless community, Coun
cilman Gary Fazzino was quoted in the
Feb. 9 Palo Alto Weekly as saying,

"When we relate this issue to homeless
ness, it trivializes the real issues faced
by the homeless."
"Maybe this . . . city hall needs
cleansing," said Victor Frost, who iden
tified himself as a homeless panhan
dler. "Do what your conscience dic
tates."
More than one community member
spoke of the "guilt" that Palo Alto resi
dents feel when they see homeless peo
ple.
"There is no statistical evidence that
there is any problem in regards to peo
ple holding up signs," said Douglas
Cowen, a local resident. "It's simply an
issue of aesthetics. We're embarrassed
to have people say they are homeless
here in Palo Alto."

The ordinance states, "It shall be
unlawful for any person, while that
person is located on a street location
designated by resolution of the city
council, to solicit employment, busi
ness or contributions from occupants
of vehicles on that street location."
Fa/./ino suggested the designated
locations will probably include the Km
barcadero Road and El Carnino Real
entrances to Town and Country Vil
lage and Arboretum Road between
Sand Hill and Quarry Roads, near the
Stanford Shopping Center.
The ordinance was first presented
in January, but failed to received the
simple majority necessary to become
law. This vote was held again last Mon
day and passed with a 6-3 vote.
