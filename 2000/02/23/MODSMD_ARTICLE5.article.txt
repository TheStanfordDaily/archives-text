# Post office could escape external audit
## 
### RITU BHATNAGAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
Robert Reed, acting manager of
post office operations, said yester
day that he has contacted the Office
of the Inspector General and noti
fied officials there of student com
plaints concerning the Stanford
post office.
Reed would not comment on
whether this meant a post office in
vestigation would be an internal
one instigated by the district office,
or an external one, conducted by
the OIG.
Reed promised students an OIG
criminal investigation and audit of
the Stanford station at the Feb. 15,
ASSU-sponsored public forum.
However, a spokesperson for
Reed's office, Horace Hinshaw,
told The San Francisco Chronicle
on Feb. 17 that if there is no reason

to suspect criminal negligence 01
fraud at the post office, the investi
gation could remain internal, at the
district level.
An internal versus external p< >st
office investigation is a difference
that is of significant concern to
some students.
"An internal investigation could
cover up what the real problems
are," said ASSU President Mike
Levin, a junior. "An independent
investigator can uncover exactly
what's going on. The post office
may not want higher-up people in
vestigating because they're afraid of
the potential for what they could
find."
Second-year law student Iv ( le
venger, who has spearheaded
much of the student response to the
post office, said he thought an ex
ternal investigation would be better
for I lie post office's "image," whit li
he said is "in shambles."
" There is no reason not to bring
in someone from the outside, unless
they have something to hide," Cle
venger said. "Saying that they're
committed to fixing the post office is
in their best interest and will im
prove their image. . . We can't trust
them to dean it up themselves.
"11 on tfie one hand this hap
pened on their watch, it's not to
their advantage to expose stuff they
should've known about. There can
be no other explanation for wanti
ng an internal investigation except
to bury stuff like that," Clevenger
said.
Christopher Mitchell, a repre

sentative in the office of U.S. Rep.
Anna Eshoo, D-Atherton, told Cle
venger that Esh<x)'s office will follow
up directly with Reed and the OIC
on the possibility of an external in
vestigation. Clevenger also said that
representatives in Senator Diane
Feinstein's office have said the sena
tor will send a letter to Reed con
cerning the Stanford station.
Clevenger is presently trying to
assemble a task force composed of
faculty, staff and students that could
look into establishing a post oflice
competitor on campus.
"We need to address questions
like, 'Should we bring in a competi
tor to lease out a space?' so that stu
dents have other options," Cle
venger said. "The University can
lease out space to a store like Postal
Express, which is easier than trying
to get the postal services contracted
out, which the U.S. Postal Service
has to agree to."
