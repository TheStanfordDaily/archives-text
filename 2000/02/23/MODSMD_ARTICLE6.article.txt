# Stanford rejects Yahoo! survey
## 
### SCOTT DORFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford has joined 10 other universities in
choosing not to participate in Yahoo! Internet
Life magazine's fourth annual survey of America's
most wired schools.
Tony Navarrete, manager of customer advo
cacy for Information Technology Systems and
Services and charged with answering most of the
Yahoo! survey questions, said the primarv reason
for the decision was the general, often irrelevant,
nature of many of the questions.
"There has been an ongoing discussion that
many universities have been having about the
survey," said Navarrete. "We have found that the
questions used are not very helpful for prospec
tive students, and I was unable to give answers
that accurately represented Stanford."
"An example question was 'Are freshmen re
quired to have computers?'" he said. "An answer
of no doesn't look good, but 95 percent of stu
dents come to school with computers anyway and
we have over 1,000 already on campus. Still, I
have to answer 'No,' and have no chance to con
vey the extra information in the survey."
Stanford joins the University of Chicago, UC-
Berkeley, Cornell, Yale, Princeton, Brown, Har
vard, Michigan and Washington Universities in
its refusal to participate in the Yahoo! survey.
The decision not to participate was made joint
ly by Navarrete and Raman Klianna, chief infor
mation officer for ITSS, after discussions with the
Office of University Communications.
"Stanford has spawned numerous information
technology companies like Yahoo! and Sun," con
tinued Navarrete. "Also, a lot of pioneering work
is being done here with technology and educa
tion, especially with the Stanford Learning Lab."
"This stuff is hard to capture on a survey," he
said, "and it can't be boiled down to numbers and
charts."
Yahoo!'s methodology uses a combination of
academic, computer hardware and miscellaneous
survey questions to compile its list
of the 100 most-wired colleges. Ac
cording to Yahool's Web site, the
sui-vey inquires "into every aspect
of a school's wired life, from student
Web usage and network speed to
Net resources available for the see
ing and hearing-impaired."
According to Kate Chesley, asso
ciate director of University Com
munications, "The methodology of
the Yahoo! survey was looked at a
couple years ago, when we got
ranked lower than we might ex
pect. We found that this survey is
too general and tries to put round
pegs in square holes.
"If schools can't lie compared,
they try to force comparisons on
them in order to generate a rank
ing," she said.

Stanford finished 27th in the
1998 survey and 31st last year.
Dartmouth College took the num
ber one spot in 1998, and Case
Western Reserve University
topped the list last year.
Both Chesley and Navarrete say
the time-consuming nature of fill
ing out surveys makes it crucial that
results are both valid and valuable.
"We participate in 50 or 60 sur
veys a year as a service to prospec
tive students and their parents,"
said Chesley. "If a survey really
doesn't seem to be helpful to stu
dents and parents, or if it is very
questionable in its design, then we
have to ask whether it is worth the
time commitment of gathering the
data and filling it out."
Stanford is not refusing to par
ticipate in all future Yahoo! sur
veys, but would like to see adjust
ments made before reconsidering
its decision.
