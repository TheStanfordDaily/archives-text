## Battle for Republican presidential bid strengthens 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Shak
en by defeat, Republican leaders
allied with George \V. Bush
strongly criticized his campaign
tactics yesterday and warned that
rival John McCain is a serious
threat to the hobbled GOP front
runner.
Governors, fund-raisers and
ranking GOP officials second
guessed Bush and his strategists
in the aftermath of McCain's
sweep of Michigan and Arizona in
l uesday primaries. The com
plaints ranged from his decision
to visit a conservative South Car
olina university — which one gov
ernor called "stupid" — to the $1
million TV ad campaign in
McCain's home state.
"I think there's a learning
curve happening right now in
terms of running a national cam
paign." said Chris DePino, chair
man of the Connecticut Republi
can Party and a staunch Bush
supporter.
The allies said they still believe
Bush will prevail in upcoming pri
maries. "When it comes down to
it, and they actually have to
choose a nominee and a presi
dent, voters are going to be look
ing for the guy who had done
stuff and not just look at the slo
gans and a lot of rah rah," said
Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.

"That's when Governor Bush will
prevail."
But their willingness to critique
the campaign underscores a
growing concern about the c andi
date they anointed a front-runner
long before the first votes were
cast.
McCain, meanwhile, crowed
about his "overwhelming and
phenomenal victory" during a
Washington state swing, as both
campaigns drew up strategies for
the upcoming two-week stretch of
contests in 16 states and four
American territories.
Republicans were hit with the
stark realization yesterday that
they may be in for a long, expen
sive race that could produce a
weakened nominee.
"There's a lot of people who
signed on early with Gov. Bush
who are wondering why this is
going on so long," said New
Hampshire party chairman Steve
Duprey.
The sentiment was echoed
throughout GOP circles, as the
fallout from the Michigan defeat
engulfed Bush's closest allies.
Several said his visit to Bob
Jones University, renown for anti-
Catholic sentiments, gave McCain
an issue in Michigan and several
other primary states with large
Catholic populations.

"1 think it was stupid," Con
necticut Gov. John Rowland said.
Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keat
ing, one of Bush's closest allies,
questioned why the Texan spent
$1 million to air TV atls in Ari
zona. Bush lost the state by nearly
a 2-to-l margin, though McCain
didn't air any ads.
"You want to play in every state
and show that you're a national
candidate, but obviouslv a sitting
senator's home state is not a place
you want to invest many
resources," Keating said.
DePino, one of Bush's early
fund-raisers, sighed loudly into
the telephone when the subject of
Arizona spending came up. " 1 just
wish I had a little more input on
how they directed some of this
money," he said.
Bush struggled to defend the
Arizona spending, telling
reporters, "I never expected to
win Arizona. It was just part of
our overall strategy."
Bush's fast-spending ways are a
constant complaint now that pub
lic records show that McCain has
narrowed his financial advantage.
Rowland said Bush also relies
too much on TV at the expense of
grass root so r ga n i z: i n g.
"It's voter turnout. It's contact
and follow up. It's good old-fash
ioned one-on-one bv the candi

date. I don't think there's been
enough of that" by Bush, said the
governor of Connecticut, where
Bush trails McCain in polls.
One Republican governor and
the top political aide to another,
both speaking on condition of

anonymity, said Bush's team has
been reluctant to ship money and
resources to state GOP organiza
tions in the March 7 states.
In one state run by a Bush-sup
porter, the governor helped raise
more than $1 million and has

received less than $5,000 from
Austin to finance his grassroots
operations.
Bush, who felt he could end
McCain's threat in Michigan, is
now forced to splurge on the
March 7 states.
