### 
ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — The
jury began deliberating yesterday
in the case of four white police
officers charged with killing an
unarmed black man after the
judge said the jurors could acquit
if they believed the officers acted
in self-defense.
The officers could be cleared if
jurors believe their claim that they
fired 41 bullets at Amadou Diallo
because they thought he had a
gun and wanted to shoot them,
Justice Joseph Teresi said. "A per
son who acts in self-defense is not
guilt) of any crime,'' he said.
1 lie judge spent more than
three hours going over the legal
instructions for each of 24 crimi
nal counts before deliberations
began.
He gave the jurors the option
of considering charges other than
murder, and told them the law
allows police officers to stop and
question someone if wrongdoing
is suspected.
"You should figuratively put

yourselves in the shoes of each
defendant and consider how the
situation appeared to him," the
judge said. "You should consider
what Amadou Diallo did before or
during the encounter."
Earlier, Teresi replaced a
female juror for talking about the
case outside of court. The jury is
now composed of four black
women, one white woman and
seven white men.
Sean Carroll, Edward
McMellon, 27, Kenneth Boss, 28,
and Richard Murphy, 27, each
have pleaded innocent to second
degree murder. They face a max
imum prison sentence of 25 years
to life if convicted.
I lie defendants were members
of a roving unit of New York City
plainclothes officers that has been
accused of stopping and frisking
young black men without cause.
Diallo's slaying sparked such
intense publicity and so many
protests that the case was moved
to Albany.
