CRESCENT CITY, Calif. (AP) â€” Guards
killed one inmate and wounded eight others
as they fired their weapons to end a race riot
yesterday at the maximum-security Pelican
Bay State Prison.
About 200 black and Hispanic inmates
using handmade weapons began lighting
about 9:30 a.m., said Ll. Ben Grundy. It
ended a hall-hour later alter guards, who first
used tear gas and pepper spray, resorted to
lethal force.
One inmate was killed by a guard. Another

was critically injured. Eight were taken to area
hospitals, said Grundy, who would not give
details on the others' conditions.
I he violence erupted in the yard of the
highest security wing of the prison, which was
built lor 2,2H0 but houses 3,400 of the state's
most dangerous and escape-prone inmates,
most of whom were sent there after being
involved in violence at other prisons.
Inmates stabbed and hit each other with
blunt objects. (iuards pulled the inmates apart
and used tear gas and pepper spray belore

resorting to bullets, Grundy said.
"It was black and Hispanic inmates light
ing," said Grundy, who did not know what
sparked the violence. "We've had racial inci
dents in the past."
Guards used tear gas and rubber bullets
last August to end another riot at the prison,
which is near the Oregon border, about 290
miles north of San Francisco.
A guard underwent surgery lor a fractured
cheekbone, but no inmates were seriously hurt
in that disturbance.
