# Pope John Paul II arrives in Egypt
## 
### 
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) — "It is
a beautiful thing, tjiis visit," says
Adel Abbas, a Muslim caretaker
at the old synagogue in the
crumbling Coptic Christian
quarter known as Babylon,
awaiting a Roman Catholic
pope.
In a fresh millennium, John
Paul II comes to holy ground to
weave together ancient threads.
He arrives today in Cairo,
where tradition says Joseph and
Mary brought their young son,
lleeing the wicked King Herod.
Before leaving on Saturday,
he visits Mount Sinai, where the
Bible says Moses received God's
law chiseled in stone after
escaping the pharaohs across a
magically parted Red Sea, 13
centuries before Christianity.
Rarely has a papal visit been
so charged with symbolic mean
ing. But this is Cairo, not easily
fazed. Rarely has the pontiffs
imminent arrival caused so little
stir.
"Cairo made a much bigger
deal of Hillary Clinton last
year," says Maggie Michael, a
Copt student at the American
University in Cairo. "I don't
know why, but people aren't
talking about the pope."
Muhammecl Fareq, in red
coat and shiny buttons, greeted
yet another faceless foreigner at
the Conrad Hotel with heart
warming insincerity: "All of
Egypt is glad you are here, sir."
When asked his opinion of
the pope's visit, however, the
clued-in archetypal doorman
looked puzzled. "Who, sir?"
Workmen painted Vatican
yellow on rusted hoardings by
the stadium where the pope is
to celebrate Mass tomorrow.
But not one banner, poster,
T-shirt or coffee mug was spot
ted on a tour of Cairo's chaotic
streets.
Deep in the Khan el-Khalili
souk, it was business as usual: a

raucous bustle of overeager
merchants, ■ wide-eyed tourists,
undersized beggars; bootMatks
and indifferent it well-armed
police.
In Babylon, at the heart of
Christian Cairo, a Muslim
woman named Fathia sold her
usual gaily painted saints and
Santa Clauses.
She had not heard of this
man, the pope, nor did she
know he was coming to Cairo.
Near the stadium, Ahmed
Mustafa, a 21-year-old comput
er programmer, knew someone
known as the pope was expect
ed, and that he lived some
where in Italy.
But that was it.
Others, however, brimmed
with enthusiasm.
"Even if they don't show it, I
think many Egyptians are excit
ed that the pope is coming and
are eager to see him in their
land," says Rasha Soliman, a
young water expert. "It is
important that he comes in
peace and security."
It will be John Paul ll's first
trip to Egypt.
"1 am Muslim, but 1 am
thrilled by this visit," exclaimed
Ann Abbas, from behind a col
orful wall of soft drinks for sale.
" This will give a true image
of Egypt and show the world we
want peace with no discrimina
tion." Abbas added.
Nearby, a trendy young cou
ple, Coptic Christians, were
eager to see the Roman pope.
"He is coming because of the
massacre last month at el-
Kusheh, to repair bad feelings,"
says Ahmed Shafq, a glue sales
man. expressing a widely held
belief among Copts.
On Jan. 2, terrorists on a
rampage shot or beat to death
23 people, all but two of them
Christians, in the village of el-
Kusheh, south of Cairo along
the Nile.
