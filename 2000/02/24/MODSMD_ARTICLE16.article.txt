## The 						Stanford Daily Municipal panhandling ban an unjust decision 
### 
Published Since 1891

The city of Palo Alto, along with many
of the surrounding communities, has
long had a reputation for being home
to some of the wealthiest, most edu
cated and influential people in this country.
However, the passage of a "safety ordinance" by
the City Council on Tuesday "banning panhan
dling on streets and median strips (between
lanes of traffic)" will undoubtedly ensure that
Palo Alto will soon be equally well known for its
intolerance of the less fortunate segments of
society and obliviousness to the growing social
problems facing it. Simply put, this ordinance
smacks of injustice and even appears to be a fla
grant violation of basic civil rights.
According to the language of the document,
the premise behind the law is that "The activity
of soliciting employment, business or contribu
tions from occupants of vehicles distracts
drivers from their primary duties to ... watch

traffic and be alert for possible traffic or pedes
trian hazards" Inspite of outrageous claims to
the contrary from proponents of the ordinance
like councilman Carry Fazzino, who assert that
this does not relate to the issue of homelessness,
it is plain and clear to anyone that this ordi
nance does indeed single out the local homeless
population. By further working to marginalize
a group that already has very little political
clout, the city is setting a very dangerous prece
dent indeed — such actions could readily form
the basis for a further abrogation of the rights
of the homeless community.
Supporters of the ordinance may argue that
this is a safety issue. However, what concrete
evidence has been brought forth linking the act
of "soliciting employment, business or contri
butions" with traffic accidents or any other
mishaps? Furthermore, how widespread a
problem is this type of panhandling? It would

seem that a more common occurrence in this
area — the use of cell phones while driving —
would pose a greater threat to traffic safety and
be a more worthy target of the City Council's
legislative efforts.
What the act will ultimately accomplish is the
suppression of one of the most basic civil rights
guaranteed under law: free speech. In this
manner, it is a threat not only to the homeless
population but also to everyone. It will in no
way make Palo Alto a safer place to drive. Fur
thermore, what certain members of the City
Council have also demonstrated is that they are
willing to unfairly target the poor and marginal
ized in order for pure political gain. Cranted,
there are many people in Palo Alto who oppose
this law, but without a doubt there are certain
elements backing the ordinance and the City
Council is responding to that.
It is indeed unfortunate that the City Coun

cil decided to devote its energy to such a minor
issue, especially when there are so many larger
problems to he dealt with namely the lack ol
affordable housing, growing income disparities
and the real crisis of homelessness. The City
Council's decision to enact such a law and focus
the town's attention on this trivial issue is made
all the more absurd when compared with the
weighty and more pressing social issues in near
by East Palo Alto.
Sadly however, it appears that many in Palo
Alto are unwilling to face up to the problem of
homelessness in their town. After all, iliis ordi
nance only serves to criminalize poverty. It
would be a much better step indeed if the City
Council realized that wealth should not make
people indifferent to social ills and that construc
tive measures must be taken to solve such prob
lems rather than forcing them underground.
