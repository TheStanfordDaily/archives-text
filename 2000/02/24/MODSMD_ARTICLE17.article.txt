# MODERN LIFE IS RUBBISH
## The 						perils of the Web

The word is out: our worst fears
are realized. Apparently the

in fact eating away at our social fabric.

lion marks are his; it's clear that he sees
online communication as fimdamental
ly unsatisfactory in some way.
This is where interpretation goes
beyond anything inherent in the
results. The survey never asked
whether Internet users actually felt iso
lated. It simply demonstrated the obvi
ous: If you're e-mailing people, you
can't be talking to them at the same
time. I he Institute took it upon itself to
go alarmist, plotting the data on an offi
cial-looking line graph and tilling it,
"Social Isolation Increasing."
The media is following right along,
already drawing connections to a 1998
Carnegie Mellon study which showed a
slight connection between depression
and heavy Internet use. But then,
depressed people also watch more TV.
11 stands to reason that anyone suf
fering from the ennui of modern life is
more likely to sit around the house and
occupy themselves with whatever is
available there. To assume any direct
causal connection is simply naive.
The real question is: if e-mail is an
inadequate form of communication,
then why does everyone use ii so much?
It's not as though the Internet is some
autonomous parasitic organism invad
ing our lives of its own volition; it's pop
ular because people find it useful.
Nobody can deny that it is changing,
and will continue to change, the way in
which we communicate, and the Insti
tute is providing an essential service by
collecting data on these changes. But
sounding the alarm bell is simply
uncalled for.
There's a tendency in our culture to
be pessimistic about the future; from
"19H4" to "The Matrix," we seem to
consistently imagine it as totalitarian, or
post-apocalyptic, or both. lied to this,
and rooted just as deeply in our psy
ches, is an instinctive distrust of tech
nology.
But the truth is that people are and
will remain people, no matter what the
machines do. Cutesy misspellings aside,
the conversation in your average chat
room isn't qualitatively different from
that in your average bar; it's still all
about sex, booze, music and everything
else that makes life worth living.
The Internet isn't about to usher us
into a Utopia, but it won't tear us apart
either. Studies can disturb us, but in the
end the future isn't as bad as we think.
