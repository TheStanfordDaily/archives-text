Stanford and its environment
II Kclith Kddy, a resident of Palo Alto,
thinks that Stanford not building housing
for 2,200 stall, students and faculty mem
bers will solve environmental problems,
she is dead wrong.
Stanford does not mean to expand the
number of its employees or students; it
seeks to house those it already has and
without whom it cannot do.
If they do not live "in my backyard"
they will commute from farther away,
adding to congestion on the roads and
hence, to pollution.
Let us not confuse real environmental
issues with surface ones. Perhaps the let
ter writer would better utilize her ener
gies by lobbying Silicon Valley companies
to relocate elsewhere. A university just
cannot move.
