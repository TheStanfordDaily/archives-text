# Palo Alto facing student surge
## 
### AMY L. KOVAC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Enrollment in Palo Alto public schools is es
timated to grow between 30 and 40 percent
over the next 10 years, according to a recent re
port by the Palo Alto School District, creating
the potential for overcrowded classrooms and
campuses.
Worried teachers, parents and school offi
cials are all wondering how this problem can he
alleviated and where the money for proposed
solutions will come from.
According to District Assoc. Superintendent
lor Business Services Boh Golton, the problem
has been growing since 1990.
"We are a very desirable school district with
high test scores and high-quality teachers and,
as a result, many people with children want to
move into Palo Alto," Golton said.
School Board member Mandy Lowell
echoed Golton's comments. "1 think that the
strong public schools in Palo Alto are a draw to
people moving here. We need to continue to
provide the excellent education that we have
when new students arrive," she said.
There are currently 10,026 students en
rolled in the school district, and facilities need
to be expanded at the elementary, middle and

high school level in order to keep pace with the
anticipated rise in enrollment.
The most acute problem at present is that
the existing middle schools, David Starr Jordan
and Jane Lathrop Stanford, each have an en
rollment of 1,100. This exceeds the enrollment
limit of 900 set by the district.

"The facilities are old, no new permanent
buildings are under construction and pre-fab
buildings were erected this past year. Over
crowding in this age group is a real problem as
these children continue to work best with indi
vidual attention and teachers who are not
forced to work in crowded classrooms," Bird
well said.
Marcie Brown, president of the Palo Alto
Council of PTAs, also has a child at JLS.
"A large problem is that there are just a lot <>l
people trying to get to the same place at the
same time. The hallways are full and the lunch
lines can be very long," Brown said.
With their current overcrowding and ai it it i
pated future growth, middle schools present
the biggest challenge to the district.
"Middle schools are our top priority,"
Golton said.
The district is planning to open a new mid

die school within the next three years and is
looking at three sites for the new school, in
cluding the former Terman Junior High
School site, the former Cubberley High School
site or a piece of land on Deer Creek Road,
which is on University property.
According to a recent article in the Palo Alto
Weekly, the lerman site, which currently
houses the Jewish Community Center, is most
desired by the district.
Last week, School Board President Cath\
Kroymann seht a letter to Palo Alto Mayor Li/
kniss requesting that the school board and citv
council work together to negotiate selling Ter
man back to the school district. However, ac
cording to (iolton, the district has not ruled out
the other two possible sites.
Ihe situation with elementary and high
schools is not as severe, since, enrollment has
not yet exceeded the maximum levels set by the
district. However, to plan for future growth,
the district is exploring options to open new el
ement. in schools and to expand the existing
high schools. It is possible that a third high
school, with a specialized curriculum, will be
built, Hi it no definite plans have been made.
While the total cost for all of these improve-
