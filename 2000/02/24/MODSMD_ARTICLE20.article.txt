## Women's swim tackles Pac-10s No. 4 Cardinal squad seeks 14th consecutive league title this weekend in Long Beach 
### MAREN EWERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I lit* Cardinal women's swim
ming and diving team will take
on the teams of the West this
weekend as it heads to Long
Beach, Calif., lor the Pacific 10
Conference Championships.
The defending Pac-1() cham
pions will face a difficult battle as
they embark on their quest for a
14th-consecntive Pac-1() win.
Ranked third in the nation
with a f)-l record, Stanford will
face some of the best NCAA
teams as well as some of its most
bitter.
Foremost among the compe
tition are No. 2 Arizona, No. 4
California and No. 5 USC. Addi
tionally, Stanford will face the
U( lIA Bruins, who defeated the
Cardinal in a dual meet in Janu
ary.
The meet this weekend will be
somewhat different than in past
years. The meet rules have been
altered so that each team can
have up to 24 athletes that com
pete for points. Until this year,
the limit was 18. According to
Cardinal assistant coach Ross
Gerry, the rule change will de
crease Stanford's chances of win
ning the meet.

"The new rule allows teams
with less star power and more
depth to gain an advantage,"
Gerry explained. "This means
that our small squad will Ik- lac
ing an uphill battle this weekend
because some of the other teams
will be competing with twice as
many athletes as we will. We are
going into the meet with a posi
tive attitude, hut it will be ex
tremely difficult to win the title
this year."
Despite the fierce competi
tion and the new rule, the Stan
ford squad is prepared to face
the competition. The team is
small, yet powerful, and has
many returning Pac-10 and
NCAA stars.
The Cardinal boasts two re
turning Pac-10 champions: ju
nior Misty I lyman and senior co
captain Catherine Fox. Hyman
was victorious both the 100- and
200-yard butterfly events, and
helped her team secure wins in
three relays: the 800 freestyle,
the 200 medley and the 400
medley. So far this year, 1 lyman
lias national top-10 rankings in
the 200 free, 200 back, 200 lly
and 200 individual medle) this
year.
Fox is the defending Pac-10
and national champion in the 50
freestyle, an event she has won
for the last two years at the Pac
-10 championships and for the
last three at the NCAA champi
onships. Fox will most likely
compete in the 50 this weekend,
as well as the 100 backstroke and
several relays.
Others to look for this week
end include senior co-captain
Gabrielle Rose, who placed sec -
ond in the 200 individual medley
at Pac-lOs last year. |unior Siob
han dropper, who holds top-20
times in the sprint freest)le events
this season, will also be a strong
contender, dropper led the 1999
team to two victories in the 200
freestyle and 200 medley relays,

and placed seventh in the 50
freestyle.
Sophomore Shelley Ripple,
who placed third in the 200 but
terlly and the 100 and 200 back
stroke events in 1999, is yet anoth
er Stanford gem. This year, Ripple
is ranked fifth in the 100 back
stroke, and has achieved an auto
matic NCAA qualify ing time in this
event. I fer roommate, sophomore
Jessica Foschi, will also be a major
contributor this weekend. She is a
favorite in the 500 and 1,650
freestyle events, and is ranked in

the top 10 in the nation in both
events.
Stanford is well-prepared tor
the meet, due in large part to the
team's two head coaches. Head
coach Richard Quick, who is in his
12th season at Stanford, has
amassed a 89-4 dual meet record
and seven NCAA titles in his Stan
ford career. Quick was named
coach of the U.S. women's national
team for the 2000 Olympics in Syd
ney, Australia, marking the fifth
time Quick will coach an Olympic
team in some capacity.

At the other end of the pool,
head diving coach Rick Shavone is
also well-known for his coaching
abilities, and was voted coach of the
year in 1999. Shavone coached ju
nior Kim Powers to a victory in the
three-meter, a second-place finish
in the platform, and a co-diver of
the year award in 1999.
Powers will be joined in Long
Beach by juniors Erin Sones and
Shawn Sinesky. Both have had
good seasons thus far, and aim to
qualify for the NCAA champi
onships this weekend.
