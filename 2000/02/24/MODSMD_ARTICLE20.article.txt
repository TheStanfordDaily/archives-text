## Women's swim tackles Pac-10s No. 4 Cardinal squad seeks 14th consecutive league title this weekend in Long Beach 
### MAREN EWERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I lit* Cardinal women's swim
ming and diving team will take
on the teams of the West this
weekend as it heads to Long
Beach, Calif., lor the Pacific 10
Conference Championships.
The defending Pac-1() cham
pions will face a difficult battle as
they embark on their quest for a
14th-consecntive Pac-1() win.
Ranked third in the nation
with a f)-l record, Stanford will
face some of the best NCAA
teams as well as some of its most
bitter.
Foremost among the compe
tition are No. 2 Arizona, No. 4
California and No. 5 USC. Addi
tionally, Stanford will face the
U( lIA Bruins, who defeated the
Cardinal in a dual meet in Janu
ary.
The meet this weekend will be
somewhat different than in past
years. The meet rules have been
altered so that each team can
have up to 24 athletes that com
pete for points. Until this year,
the limit was 18. According to
Cardinal assistant coach Ross
Gerry, the rule change will de
crease Stanford's chances of win
ning the meet.

"The new rule allows teams
with less star power and more
depth to gain an advantage,"
Gerry explained. "This means
that our small squad will Ik- lac
ing an uphill battle this weekend
because some of the other teams
will be competing with twice as
many athletes as we will. We are
going into the meet with a posi
tive attitude, hut it will be ex
tremely difficult to win the title
this year."
Despite the fierce competi
tion and the new rule, the Stan
ford squad is prepared to face
the competition. The team is
small, yet powerful, and has
many returning Pac-10 and
NCAA stars.
The Cardinal boasts two re
turning Pac-10 champions: ju
nior Misty I lyman and senior co
captain Catherine Fox. Hyman
was victorious both the 100- and
200-yard butterfly events, and
helped her team secure wins in
three relays: the 800 freestyle,
the 200 medley and the 400
medley. So far this year, 1 lyman
lias national top-10 rankings in
the 200 free, 200 back, 200 lly
and 200 individual medle) this
year.
Fox is the defending Pac-10
and national champion in the 50
freestyle, an event she has won
for the last two years at the Pac
-10 championships and for the
last three at the NCAA champi
onships. Fox will most likely
compete in the 50 this weekend,
as well as the 100 backstroke and
several relays.
