# Card travels to Washington
## No. 1 men's basketball takes on conference cellar-dwellers in Huskies, Cougars 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
Heading into the wet wilds of
Washington this weekend with the
No. 1 ranking once again strapped
112 irmly to its back, Stanford is hoping
that neither of the Pacific 10 Con
ference's worst two teams will rain
on what is becoming quite a parade
for the Cardinal.
With Cincinnati's loss to Temple
Sunday, the Bearcats building aura
of invincibility has been punctured,
at least for the ume being. Stanford,
which had waited patiently in the
wings despite winning 10 straight
by an average margin of more than
22 points, was pushed back to the
top of the polls, a spot it held for
three weeks in late December and
early January.
But last time ilic- Cardinal held
the top spot, few Stanford fans even
thought the team belonged there.
Despite the team's undefeated
record and quality wins over Duke
(now ranked No. 2) and Auburn
(No. 11), Stanford had yet to look
like a dominant team.
But now after the team's impres
sive roll through the conference has
highlighted its stifling defense and
balanced storing machine, Stan
lord (22-1, 11-1 Pac-10) is at the top
legitimately. Even head coach Mike
Montgomery, always loathe to talk
about rankings, admits being No. 1
means a little more this time.
"We're proud of it,"he said.
"Early on 1 thought there really
wasn't any consistency in terms of
being able to choose somebody that
might be in that spot. But we've
bee n fairlv consistent, we've won

some games. We're kind of proud
of it now."
While the achievement is obvi
ous, Montgomery and Stanford un
derstand implicitly that the ranking
could quickly turn into an unneces
sary burden should it run across a
surprise this weekend in Washing
ton.
But consider this: A month ago,
Stanford methodically beat Wash
ington State and Washington by ;i
combined 55 points, then last week
end Stan lord polished oil its archri
val with a vengeance, demolishing
California 101 -50 in a humbling dis
play of the Cardinal's overwhelm
ing strength, depth and talent.
With they way Stanford has been
playing, an upset by Washington
State (5-17, 0-13) tonight in Pull
man, or by Washington (9-16, 4-9)
Saturday in Seattle, is almost un
thinkable. Vet the C Cardinal, wary of
upset losses to USC, Oregon State
and Conzaga last year, is treating
eveiy game seriously.
"There's no way [Washington
State is] an 0-fer team in the confer
ence," Montgomery said of the
(lougars, who have the chance to be
the Pac-10's first-ever winless team
in conference. "They're better than
that. They've been in overtime
games, they've had chances to win.
1 hey just haven't had it happen for
them."
Montgomery even discounted
Stanford's 25-point pounding of
Washington State at Maples Pavil
ion last month, pointing out that last
year the Cardinal also killed the
Cougars when they ventured down
to Palo Alto, blowing out Washing
ton State 94-45. However, up in
Pullman, Stanford scrapped for a
tough (>4-58 win.
"Last game was probably closer
than the final score would have in
dicated," Montgomery said. "So
we'll just probably take a look at the

"I think they're better playing
small and spread and I think
Walcott really helps them do
that." Montgomery said. "They

their two bigger players, and I
don't think that was the answer

and ( I halo) (Ireen they spread

Smart enough to beat Stanford?
With the Cardinal playing as well

and as Ibeused as ever, that's not
likely. Stanford, back at the top of
the heap nationally, still technically
sits in second plate in the Pac-10,
hall a game behind Arizona. I hat's

"We kind of know what our j< >b is

Montgomen said. "Right now

doesn't ailed us one way or the
other I don't think."
