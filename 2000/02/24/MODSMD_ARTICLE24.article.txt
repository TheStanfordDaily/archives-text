### ALEX BENJAMIN 
Kor the Stanford men's wrestling team, the
Pat ific 10 Conference Championships will be the
culmination of a season which lias seen tips and
downs all year long. Affected by assorted injuries
and'the unexpected death of assistant coach Tod
Surinon on New Year's Day, the team has had to
overcome a number of obstacles to make it
thi/nigh the year.
Sievertheless, everything that has transpired
during the regulai season will have little eflect on
the tournament's anything-can-happen atmos
phere. This will be the Cardinal's last chance to
make a mark on the rest of the Pac-10 as it heads
to I C-l)avis for this weekend's championships.
I he tournament will consist of 10 wrestlers
per weight dass, one from each school, with the
lop lour finishers qualifying for the NCAA
Championships in mid-March. At last year's
meet, hosted by the Cardinal, Stanford pro
duced three Pac-10 finalists including Beau

Weiner (157), who placed seventh at the NCAA
Championships, and seniors Zacli Zimmerer
(133-pounds) and Rudy Ruiz (125). This year
the Cardinal could stand to do even better.
"1 am hopeful that at the Pac-10s we will win
our share of the close matches, and that we will
qualify' three to five athletes to the NCAA Cham
pionships," said Stanford head coach Chris I lor
pel. "If we do that, we will finish somewhere in
the middle of the Pac-10 team conference."
I hose that have a good chance to qualify are
seniors Warren McPherson (157), Clay Hacker
man (105) as well as Ruiz and Zimmerer, who
look to return to the N( AYs again this year. (lur
rently, Zimmerer sits atop the Pac-10 with only
one loss on the year, Ruiz and McPherson are
both ranked third and I lackcrman, who injured
his knee two weeks ago, has gotten better and
will also have a good possibility of qualifying
come t his weekend.
"The team is looking pretty tough right now,"
Hackerman said. "Stanford wrestlers always
seem to step it up just before the Pac- 10s, and I
think that's what I'm witnessing this year. The in
tensity in the practice room is high, and nobody
seems to be burned out.
()thers wrestlers who have an outside chance
at finishing in the lop foui include freshmen
Justin Walker (I II). Isaiah (lamp (149), I larold
Penson (174) and Brad Selln (285), as well as

sophomores Chuck Fairbanks (184) and Andy
Hunter (197).
"I think this is the strongest individual lineup
we have fielded for Pac-l()s since I have been in
the program," Hunter said. "Personally, I am
peaking at just the right time. I feel relaxed and
confident about next weekend, and I plan to
make the trip to St. 1 .ouis next month to compete
at nationals."
Despite being injury prone all year, the Car
dinal will finally see the return of its usual 10
starters. Ruiz has been out with a rib injury.
I lealthy now, lie is eager heading into this week
end.
"I feel great. My injury lias healed complete
ly, and the time I was forced to stay off the mat
really kept up my hunger for competition," Rui/
said. "I'm excited to face off against my rivals, es
pecially those I haven't had a chance to wrestle
yet this year."
1 he team has had these last two weeks to heal
and motivate them into the l'ac-10 Champi
onships. With nothing else to worry about, they
are focused on what will happen on Saturday
and Sunday.
"We have really worked hard the last 10 days,
concentrating on vei*y specific techniques, per
sonalized lor each of our 10 starters," I lor pel
said. "If we stay healthy and continue to train
smart, I think we will be readv."
