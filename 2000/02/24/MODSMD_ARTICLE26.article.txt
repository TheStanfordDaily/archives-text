Wait! Before you judge my
words by the quality of the
photo which accompanies
them, hear me out.

You may
have come to
associate that
mug shot
with verbal
tripe
sports non
sense. You
may be sur
prised, then,
to i 111 cI that

my sports knowledge greatly
exceeds your own. Sad, but
true.
Posting the trot. Fartlek.
More than just disgusting bath
room euphemisms, these are
actual sports terms (in equestri
an and distance running, re
spectively) whose meanings
you need to know to carry on
successful cocktail conversa
tion. You do not know them.
I admit that your sports
know-how is lackluster at best.
To help you out, the following
is a brief refresher course to
help bolster your sports IQ.
Let's begin:
In volleyball, libero is (a) the
free and easy lifestyle choice es
poused In most players; (b) a
iia/ing ritual in which fresh
man guys must play a match
with no "athletic support"; (c) a

player who may substitute after
any play; (d) the tulebook
translated in Portuguese.
If you chose (a), the lifestyle
choice, you would be wrong.
Most volleyball players refuse
to take a stance on the so-called
"libero" lifestyle. The correct
answer is, of course, (c). The
libero player may substitute at
any time, but must remain be
hind the 10-foot line and may
not hit.
On to fencing — identify the
style of sword not currently
used in competition: (a) epee;
(b) saber; (c) foil; (d) scimitar.
I hough high-seas pirates
have lobbied fencing leagues
around the world to adopt it,
scimitar competition has yet to
catch on — (d) is correct.
Note the fact that the foil is
the only sword for which the
crotch is specifically distin
guished as a legal area for at
tacking. However, swashbuck
ler efforts to have crotch shots
count for double points have
also fallen flat.
Brush up on your ejection
knowledge. In water polo, a
player my be ejected (a) zero
times; (b) once; (c) three times;
(cl) any number of times before
he or she is permanently re
moved 112 rom the game.
