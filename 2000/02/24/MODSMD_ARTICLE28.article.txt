## Softball looks ahead to Utah Invitational

duplicate iis stellai pel lot malices from the last
two lournaiiieiiisoii the road.
l or the third wee kend in a row, the (Cardinal
will abandon iis home lui I to duel against some
ol (lie most competitive teams in the country,
this lime at the I tali Invitational.
As many ol the players point out, the more
games ihe\ plav eai lv on, the faster their team,
especially with seven new Ireshman on the ros
ter, can adjust to one auothei on the field.
Stanford, although ranked No. lin the pre
season National lastpiich Coaches' .Association
poll, based on last year's standings, earned the
No. If spot yesterda\ after demonstrating the
capabilities ol this year's team.
As of last weekend, the team has racked up a
total ol I I wins and jnsi one loss, against No. 6
Michigan, and appears to lie acclimating fairly

quickly.
"Winning these early season games can only
help your team's political standing later on
clown the road for regionals," freshman pitcher
Dana Sorensen said.
These tournaments also provide the Cardi
nal with an excellent opportunity to play teams
it wouldn't normally liice, as will he the case in
Utah this coming weekend.
"The Utah Invitational is a new tournament
this year out of St. George," head coach John
Rittman said, "But, it will give us yet another im
portant opportunity to lace teams out of region."
Stanford kicks into gear tomorrow at noon
against Tulsa, followed immediately by a game
against Utah.
Saturday and Sunday's games versus No. 7
Oklahoma, Brigham Young University and
Utah State will also serve as valuable practice for
the tough squads the Cardinal will be pitted
against later on this year within the Pacific 10
Conference.
Although the team's bats have been produc
ing like crazy for the Stanford offense, Rittman
was hoping Mother Nature would cooperate
and enable the team to get some outdoor de-

fense practice in before heading to Utah
tonight.
"We gave up some unnecessary runs and
committed a couple errors in the
[Campbell/Cartier Classic] tournament,"
Rittman said. "I'd really like to get the team out
on the field and work some things out defen
sively."
But, at the rate the Stanford softball team is
chewing up and spitting out its opponents these
days, there is little doubt that missing practice
due to a little rain is going to stop this ball club's
winning steak.
"Our goal is to go out there and win," fresh
man pitcher Tori Nyberg said, who made an
impressive tournament debut last weekend
after recovering from a rib injury. "We're going
to keep doing what we've been doing: try to
score in the first inning and get ahead right
from the beginning. That seems to be working
for us."
Nyberg seems to have the right idea.
In the world of softball, if it ain't broke, don't
fix it.
And these days the Stanford softball team is
running like a well-oiled machine.
