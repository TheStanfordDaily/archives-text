### DENNIS TYLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After last week's focus on post
office issues, the ASSU Under
graduate Senate was back to its
own business as it approved
funding Ibi lour out ol live of I he
organizations nuclei considera
tion at lucsdav night's meeting.
I lie lii si organization to re
ceive funding was the High
lighters I lieatei (Iroup, which is
planning to perform "God," a
play written b) Wood\ Mien. Be
cause ol the ASSU funding, sin
denis will now be able to attend
the performance free oft barge.
I he I 'pward Bound program
received funding as well. I pward
Bound provides first generation
and low-income high school stu
dents from Fast Palo Alto and
Redwood dii\ with academic
support and guidance in order to
prepare them loi a < ollcge educa
tion.
I lie only aspect ol I pward
Bound's proposed budget that
was questioned was the purchase
of two iMAd-DV computers.
However, because the program
uses video gi aphics w hen playing

with kids, it was agreed that they
would need the DV-model com
puter because it has special video
editing features.
The Jewish Student Associa
tion and "Brainier Presents" also
received funding.
I he only group not to receive
funding was I fui 'O Hawai'l. The
Senate agreed that the group
should not receive funding be
cause its umbrella organization
already receives Special Fee
money, rendering it ineligible.
I fui '() Hawai'l's goal is to learn
about, preserve and share Native
Hawaiian traditions with the
Stanford community.
After 112 unding issues were dealt
with, Serge Kassardjian, a sopho
more senator, proposed that the
Senate ban fliers from being
placed in bathrooms and instead
require the use of handbills. The
idea was to get students to talk
more about the issues in their
campaign.
ASSU President Mike Levin, a
junior, said that such a change
"would not set the light prece
dent for the Senate. First we told
students that we could put fliers
up in the bathroom, now we are

saying that students cannot put
lliers up. It makes the ASSU look
very unorganized."
Speaking in favor of the
change, Matt Spence, a cotermi
nal student in International Poli
cy Studies, said that "having can
didates put up handbills would be
a great idea because the current
candidate handbook has no pur
pose."
"And unlike last year when the
Elections Committee changed the
rules in the middle of elections,
the 2000 elections have not start
ed yet. Therefore, this would be a
good time for us to change some
rules because no one is officially
running for Senate," Spence said.
Also, Levin presented a new
funding proposal for the ASSU
Online Course Cuide. Next year
he wants to hire faculty to take on
the project.
Levin wants to pass a petition
to get the ASSU Course Guide on
the 2000 ASSU ballot. "If we put
this on the ballot then we can see
if students would be willing to
give an extra two dollars a year
for this service. Personally, I feel
like this is the best course guide
we ever had," Levin said.
