# Anthropology split deemed productive
## Two years later; professors satisfied with new departments 
### CORINNE YATES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Professors in both of Stan ford's
anthropology departments almost
unanimously agree, two years after
they split apart, that the move was
necessary.
Both departments, Anthropo
logical Sciences and Cultural and
Social Anthropology, have been
able to concentrate on scholarship
and teaching now that their con
flicts have been set aside, profes
sors say.
"1 have never been happy about
the split. For me, it was simply the
lesser of two evils. As one depart
ment with two warring factions, we
were never going to get any
where," said AN Iff SCI Depart
ment Chair Bill Durham.
The decision was made after
more than a decade of personal
tensions within the department re
garding the direction of the field of
anthropology. While CASA em

phasi/es cultural interaction,
AN I 11 SC '.I puts more of'a focus on
biological history and archaeology.
"There are courses in both de
partments that seem to lit into
both," said senior Jessica Amey,
who declared as an anthropology

major before the split. "It's obvious
that there was a split, and not so
much because of content."
"Although there had long been
a variety of tensions within the for
mer Anthropology Department,
they began to focus in the mid-90's

around issues concerning profes
sorial appointments. The faculty
coalesced more and more into two
groups which, in my opinion, w ere
looking for two different kinds of
scholarship," Durham said.
" These two groups began to
stymie and block each other's ef
forts to make good new appoint
ments. Sadly, we began to behave
like separate rival entities long be
fore the Dean's office offered to let
us vote on separation," he added.
Since the separation, however,
relations between the two depart
ments have improved.
"There are open lines of com
munication," said senior Shelley
Hou, a peer advisor for ('.ASA.
"When a student comes in with in
terests that seem to match those of
ANTH SCI, 1 just refer them over
like I would with .. . CSRE [Com
parative Studies in Race and T.th
nicity] or any other department."
"It is working out wonderfully,"
said CASA Prof. Akhil Gupta.
"Now there is real cohesion and
similar goals within the depart
ment. There is no animosity and
no fights."
"For years, it was difficult to do
