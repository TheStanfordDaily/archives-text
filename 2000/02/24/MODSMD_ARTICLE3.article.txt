# Anthropology split deemed productive
## Two years later; professors satisfied with new departments 
### CORINNE YATES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Professors in both of Stan ford's
anthropology departments almost
unanimously agree, two years after
they split apart, that the move was
necessary.
Both departments, Anthropo
logical Sciences and Cultural and
Social Anthropology, have been
able to concentrate on scholarship
and teaching now that their con
flicts have been set aside, profes
sors say.
"1 have never been happy about
the split. For me, it was simply the
lesser of two evils. As one depart
ment with two warring factions, we
were never going to get any
where," said AN Iff SCI Depart
ment Chair Bill Durham.
The decision was made after
more than a decade of personal
tensions within the department re
garding the direction of the field of
anthropology. While CASA em

phasi/es cultural interaction,
AN I 11 SC '.I puts more of'a focus on
biological history and archaeology.
"There are courses in both de
partments that seem to lit into
both," said senior Jessica Amey,
who declared as an anthropology

major before the split. "It's obvious
that there was a split, and not so
much because of content."
"Although there had long been
a variety of tensions within the for
mer Anthropology Department,
they began to focus in the mid-90's

around issues concerning profes
sorial appointments. The faculty
coalesced more and more into two
groups which, in my opinion, w ere
looking for two different kinds of
scholarship," Durham said.
" These two groups began to
stymie and block each other's ef
forts to make good new appoint
ments. Sadly, we began to behave
like separate rival entities long be
fore the Dean's office offered to let
us vote on separation," he added.
Since the separation, however,
relations between the two depart
ments have improved.
"There are open lines of com
munication," said senior Shelley
Hou, a peer advisor for ('.ASA.
"When a student comes in with in
terests that seem to match those of
ANTH SCI, 1 just refer them over
like I would with .. . CSRE [Com
parative Studies in Race and T.th
nicity] or any other department."
"It is working out wonderfully,"
said CASA Prof. Akhil Gupta.
"Now there is real cohesion and
similar goals within the depart
ment. There is no animosity and
no fights."
"For years, it was difficult to do

just about anything positive and
productive. ' I "lie department was
locked in a total impasse. The split
was positive in the sense of breaking
the logjam," Durham said.
"There have also been major
auricular innovations in both de
partments,, resulting... in better,
stronger, and more fix:used courses
of study for undergraduate and
graduate students alike," he said.
I)espite the positive effects of the
departmental split, it also comes
with some drawbacks. Among these
is the division of resources.
"The division of resources lias
not always been equitable and fair
in my opinion. Anthropological
Sciences was seriously disadvan
taged from the start in such things
as equipment, staff, faculty posi
tions, office space, even location—
we remain scattered over four
buildings today, although that is
scheduled to improve," Durham
said.
In June, AN 111 SCI is sched

uled to move to Building 360. The
department hopes that this will
solve some problems.
"Access to rooms that many of us
used freely and on equal lixxing for
decades —like classrooms, confer
ence and seminar rooms—has In
come a bit of a pain. We're all a bit
tired of making special requests to
CASA for the use of rooms that
should have been shared 50-50
until our move."
Despite these problems, most
members of both departments said
that, in retrospect, the split was nec
essary for their 112 uture growth.
"Both departments seem to be
experiencing a kind of renaissance,
a burst of creativity and energy now
that both groups are free to go their
own ways," said Durham.
Stanford is not the first universi
ty to have split anthropology de
partments. Harvard and Duke also
have departments that operate sep
arately.
"People all around the country
have watched us split," said Cupta.
"They were concerned about what
it would mean for anthropology.
For us it worked out reallv well."
