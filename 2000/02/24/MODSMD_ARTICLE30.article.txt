# Stanford Sports Hall of Fame suffering technical difficulties
## Exhibit at Arrillaga Family Sports Center lacks functioning monitors to complete historic displays 
### PATRICK C. CROSETTO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Built in 1994, the Stanford Athletics Hall of Fame
exhibit was supposed to be a place to relive the past
glories of Stanford sports. However, a mechanical
breakdown in the video monitors a couple of years
ago has made it impossible for visitors to watch these
highlights as originally intended.
The Hall of Fame was created in 1954 by Palo
.Alto Times reporter Walt Gamage as a way to honor
the athletic endeavors of former Stanford athletes.
Over the past 50 years, more than 250 athletes, in
cluding Jim Plunkett, John Elway, Pop Warner, Bill
Walsh and Summer Sanders, have been inducted.
In 1994, the Hall of Fame was moved into the
new Arillaga Family Sports Center. Since its opening
that November, over 50,000 visitors from over 20
countries have come to the Hall of Fame to experi
ence the legacy of Stanford Athletics.
"Norwegians want to know about track and field,
the Japanese want to know about gymnastics and
swimming, the South Africans and Australians want
to hear about soccer," said Crystal Gamage, widow
of the hall's founder and one of the many volunteers
who act as its staff and guides.
The design of the Hall of Fame is based upon

the spoke of a wheel, with different sections repre
senting different sports. The floors of each area
represent the fields upon which each sport is
played.
For example, the floor of the football section is As
troturf and the floor of the water polo and swim
ming sections are tiled like the bottom of a pool.
The unique design has attracted visitors from
athletic departments across the country who wish to
replicate Stanford's Hall at their own universities.
Other visitors simply come to admire the live
Sears Directors Cup awards, which Stanford has re
ceived for overall collegiate athletic excellence. The
coveted trophies sit in the center of the room.
"The only problem," Gamage said, "is that we
have six inoperative TV screens."
The monitors were meant to show highlights
from the past history of Stanford sports, giving each
visitor the ability to call up video of selected athletic
achievements. ,
However, a technical glitch has prevented On
screens from functioning for years. ' â€¢
Hal Curry, a basketball season ticketholder who
frequents the Hall of Fame at Arrillaga. said, "li is
ironic that in this general area and at this period of
great athletic success the technology at the Hall was
not functioning. There have been some fabulous
events in recent years, not to mention the past, that
many would enjoy seeing again."
Varsity fencer Avin Bansal, a sophomore, agreed
with Curry's comments, saying, "The rest of the Hall
of Fame is so well put together, it's a shame the mon
itors don't work."
