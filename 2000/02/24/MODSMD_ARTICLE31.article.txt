Alfred Hitchcock would have turned 100 last
summer, and directors throughout Hollywood marked

the occasion with a decades-old ritual. They copied him.
The Master of Suspense, who was 80 when died in 1980, has

indisputably influenced the movie industry since he began making
silent thrillers in the late 19205. Hitchcock's self-professed twisted out
look played perfectly on the black-and-white screen, and his films have
brought some of the most chilling, burn-in-yom-brain images to the silver

screen.
l hat effect has carried on posthumously, as a generation of directors that
came of age studying Hitchcock's work now borrows liberally from him in its

productions.
"He is the one who distilled the essence of film," Brian de Palma, direc
tor of "Carlito's Way" and "Carrie," once said. "He's like Webster. It's all there.
I've used a lot of his grammar."

A lot of folks used his grammar last summer. Among the culprits: "Lake
Placid," "The Sixth Sense," "Eyes Wide Shut" and"The Blair Witch Project." I'he
first four sampled Hitchock's characters or themes — a psychologist in need
of self-healing here, a blurry quest fueled by sexual obsession there. The suc
cess of "Blair Witch," a film straight from Hitchcock's suspense-by-sugges

— __ 7 — P } / —on —
tion textbook, mirrored that of another low-budget thriller, 1960's "Psy
cho."

And while nearly all of those movies did well at least in part, none
could match the minute-for-minute intensity of a Hitchcock classic.
They weren't trying to, and for good reason.

That reason — that nobody beats the Master at the suspense
game — is on display nightly from now until the end of April on Uni
versity Ave. in Palo Alto. The Stanford Theater, a true old-time

movie house that specializes in black-and-white fare, launched a
Hitchcock film festival earlier this month that showcases the
director's genius in a chronological tour of his work.

The festival features more than 40 Hitchcock films, from
1927's "The Lodger" to 1976's "Family Plot." The program
includes every movie he made in Hollywood, beginning with

"Rebecca," the 1940 Oscar-winning Gothic drama and Hitchcock's first
American film, which opens tonight and runs through Sunday.

Such a large collection can seem daunting, particularly for moviegoers
whose Hitchcock experience is limited to "Psycho" or "The Birds." But the Stan
ford Theater knows how to run a retrospective festival, taking the director's best
known works, pairing them with "closet classics" (every show at the theater is a double

feature) and giving them weekend showtimes.
The result is a chance for newcomers and fanatics alike to experience some of Hitchcock's best
work. Among the highlights: a must-see pairing of "Vertigo" and "Rope" starting March 30, "Psy
cho" and"The Trouble With Harry" two weeks later and the month-ending "Dial M for Murder" in

3-D.
If you're looking for a hidden gem, try "Strangers on a Train," which plays with "Lifeboat" starting
March 16, the end of Finals Week. The story of a tennis champion pushed by a smooth-talking psychopath
into a murder pact, "Strangers" includes a classic opening sequence widely regarded as one of the best in film
history.

The film is best known for Robert Walker's subtly brilliant portrayal of Bruno, the Oedipal madman who
attempts to force Guy Haines (played by Farley Granger) to kill his father. It's a performance Matt Damon tried to
repeat in the most blatant Hitchcock-clone film of 1999, "The Talented Mr. Ripley," a psychological thriller based on

a book by Patricia Highsmith, the same author who penned the base text for "Strangers on a Train."
Damon does an adequate job as Ripley, but he's no match tor Walker, a contrast that partially underscores why Hitch
cock's films are so tough to match. Not only is the directing superb, but the acting usually excels as well.
Particularly impressive is
Hitchcock's ability to coax great
performances from stars and no
names alike. For some oi the
best, check out Gary Grant in
"North by Northwest," Ingrid
Bergman in "Notorious," Jimmy
Stewart in "Rope" and Anthony
Perkins in "Psycho." But Walker
as Bruno may top them all.
Whomever you end up watch

ing, here are a few tips to maxi
mize your theater experience.
First off, get downtown early.
Growds have been lining up
around the corner for the festival
so far, especially for the later two
shows, but you can beat them by
catching the later afternoon half
of the double feature first, then
staying for the 7:30 p.m. show.
Another way to avoid the
masses: try a weeknight.
If you go Monday through
Wednesday, you'll hit a pair of
lesser-known Hitchcock films
that even the most die-hard fans

might not have seen. And if
you're aching for"The Birds," it
starts on a Thursday.
Finally, enjoy the Stanford
Theater for what it is — a funky
old movie house with a working
organ (played each night before
the 7:30 p.m. show) and a cur
tain-covered screen. Don't expect
surround sound. Take a date, sit
in the balcony, and let the Master
work his magic on you.
Tickets for all shows are $6,
which buys you admission to
both halves of the double fea
ture.

Whomever you end up watch

ing, here are a few tips to maxi
mize your theater experience.
First off, get downtown early.
Growds have been lining up
around the corner for the festival
so far, especially for the later two
shows, but you can beat them by
catching the later afternoon half
of the double feature first, then
staying for the 7:30 p.m. show.
Another way to avoid the
masses: try a weeknight.
If you go Monday through
Wednesday, you'll hit a pair of
lesser-known Hitchcock films
that even the most die-hard fans

might not have seen. And if
you're aching for"The Birds," it
starts on a Thursday.
Finally, enjoy the Stanford
Theater for what it is — a funky
old movie house with a working
organ (played each night before
the 7:30 p.m. show) and a cur
tain-covered screen. Don't expect
surround sound. Take a date, sit
in the balcony, and let the Master
work his magic on you.
Tickets for all shows are $6,
which buys you admission to
both halves of the double fea
ture.
