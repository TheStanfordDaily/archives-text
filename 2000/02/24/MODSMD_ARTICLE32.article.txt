# 'Dora' goes way too deep

### ZACH UDKO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford Drama Department's produc
tion of Helene Cixous' Freudian play "Por
trait of Dora" is about ego. Not necessarily
Freud's term ego, but rather the unmiti
gated ego involved in the assumption that
students will want to flock to see this intel
lectual masturbation.
It is a play that is rather characteristic in
tone and style of most Stanford drama.
Dance and art collide with lofty abstrac
tions as incomprehensible themes copulate
on a gorgeous set. That is what Stanford
drama is all about, it seems. And ii it's not
going to change, one might as well accept
it and embrace it with open arms.
"Portrait of Dora" is an impenetrable
work of art, the type of play one must read
before and after a visit to the theater to
grasp its elusive language. It follows
Freud's early case work of his patient Ida
Bauer, a woman in the throes ol hysteria.
Jumping back and forth between the past
and the present, between reality and
dream worlds, Cixous attempts to "express
what is inexpressible in language," accord
ing to the program notes. For the most
part, "Dora" is a challenge to read and pos
sibly (in the wrong hands) even more diffi
cult to sit through.
Under graduate student Felory
Williamson's deft multimedia direction,
however, it becomes a masterful display ol
beauty. Soon, it doesn't matter if you fol
low the play's plot: like a finely burnished
tone poem, it pleases the ear without mak
ing much sense.
A cast of six is along for the ride. They
dance, freeze in ridiculous poses, and revel
in the play's dense language. Zack (yes, just
Zack) plays a wonderfully understated
Freud without dialect. He is a masterful

thinker on the stage, carefully endowing
his moments of silence.
Dora is given an actress for the past
(jyoti Bollmann) and present (Suzannah
Tipermas), and both wonderfully convey
the broad range of emotions that the part
entails. Bollmann, too, is by the best dancer
in the ensemble — perhaps the only per
former that should have been dancing.
An elegant Kim Dienes as Frau K and a
dignified Bill Hanson as Hen k round out
a fine ensemble. The British Justin Moore
sticks out as a bit of an aberration as far as
dialect is concerned as Dora's father Hen
B. Accents tend to distract in the wrong
context.
But the true star of the evening is Chris
Tate, for his mesmerizing video footage,
playing in the background on two separate
screens. Tate's black-and-white films
explore Dora's thoughts and dreams, tak
ing us where Cixous' text never could.
Williamson does her best to make the
play accessible to her audience, but ulti
mately her material is not that exciting.
