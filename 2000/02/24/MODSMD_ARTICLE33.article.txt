# 'Slip' to Coffee House for jazz jams
## 
### STEVEN RAPHAEL SENIOR MUSIC CRITIC 
Aiming to enrich social
and cultural life on campus
through entertainment, the
Stan lord Concert Network is
closing its latest effort with
jazzy jam band The Slip play
ing the last of a series of SCN
concerts at the Stanford Cof
fee House.
I he Slip is a guitar, bass
and drum trio that special
izes in abstract jazz instru
mentals. The former Berklee
School of Music students cite
influences as varied as
AC/DC, Stevie Ray Vaughn,
Louis Armstrong, early New
Orleans style music, and pre
cursors of swing and bebop.
Hailing from the north
east, they are in the middle
of a national tour. "When we
encounter a new audience,"
said The Slip bassist Mare
Friedman, "we try to attack
them with our material. Even
if we only attract five new
fans in a night, it's worth it."
Their stop at the Coffee
House is one of few free
dates in a tour featuring such
venues as Santa Cruz's
Palookaville and San Francis
co's Last Day Saloon.
While many of their songs
are smooth, guitar driven
jazz compositions, others fea
ture Sting-esque vocals over
poppy backbeats. Still others
are mellow, almost new-age
sounding pieces. Nearly all
feature constantly evolving
drum beats, complex moving
bass lines, and laid back gui

tar improvisations.
Even if they don't all have
a catchy melody to stick in
your head, the group's songs
are certainly enjoyable.
Moreover, the chemistry
between the members is
undeniable. Brothers
Andrew and Brad Ban form
the core of the group on per
cussion and guitar, while
Friedman holds down the
bottom line on bass.
Although the group is typ
ically clustered with other
jam bands, they don't quite
seem to lit the mold. Their
stripped-down trio setup
doesn't allow as much free
dom as a larger band would.

In a larger band, there is
more texture to hold the
song together. When playing
in a trio, on the other hand,
if more than one musician
gets too far from his part, the
song loses all coherency.
This places more respon
sibility on each member.
Although all three have the
skill to solo continously, at
any given time two members
must restrain themselves.
Unlike the majority of the
jam band genre, The Slip is
mainly a jazz band, with each
member soloing in turn.
On their recordings, they
seem to sharply separate
improvisational and vocal

music. Songs such as "Eube"
are upbeat, catchy pop tunes
capable of standing their
own oil top 40 radio stations.
Meanwhile, in songs like
"Yellow Medicine," a jazz
tune, and "Spice Groove," a
funky number, the group
explores improvisation.
Their concert tonight is
the fifth in the SCN concert
series that featured Allette
Brooks, Rubberneck,
Neosoreskin, and Dealer
ship. In a new role for the
organization, they will also
be co-sponsoring next week's
Battle of the Bands.
