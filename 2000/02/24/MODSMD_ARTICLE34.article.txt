# No fire in this 'Boiler'
## 
### RANDY MANO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
" I he Boiler Room" is a tale of
two movies. The first half is
crackling with sharp wit and a
keen eye for modern capitalism.
1 he second portion turns down
right sloppy. It's unfortunate,
really, that " 1 he Boiler Room"
couldn't build more on the
excesses of "Wall Street" and
"Glengarry Glen Ross."
Rising star Giovanni Ribisi,
who previously starred in "Sav
ing Private Ryan" and"The
Other Sister," is the focus of Ben
Younger's debut effort. Ribisi
plays Setli, the main character,
very carefully — his cocky
demeanor has to mask his vul
nerable, caring side.
Slowly, Seth turns away from
a well-managed, illegal casino
set-up in order to satisfy his
father by taking a position at J.T.
Marlin, which immediately
brought a smile to my face after I
heard the name. Okay, a good
one-laugh gag, but can Younger
sustain the energy?
He does, for a while. Seth and
his co-workers, many of whom

were hired by Jim Young (Ben
Affleck, in a cameo role), talk
trash about brokers from the
likes of J.P. Morgan and Gold
man Sachs, and the results are
on the money. Hot-headed
Richie (Scott Caan, "Varsity
Blues") pulverizes some random
guy at a bar; Setli is wisely
restrained by Chris (Vin Diesel),
his mentor at tlit* firm.
Seth's boss is Greg (Nicky
Katt), a guy who grows increas
ingly jealous of Seth's prowess
both at work and with his former
girlfriend, Abby (Nia Long). The
love scenario is fairly weak and
feels out-of-place; the movie
functions much better within the
intense, "boiler room" setting.
Tom Everett Scott rounds out
the testosterone-laden cast as
Michael, the ambitious head of
J.'f. Marlin who dishes out
worthless stock picks for the
money-hungry brokers to sell to
gullible clients.
I have to admit the cast isn't
terribly deep in character devel
opment. This problem becomes
especially apparent in the second
half when Setli suddenly devel
ops a conscience. The whole FBI

involvement in the ensuing
investigation of J.T. Marlin is
rather ridiculous and black-and
white.
But "The Boiler Room" still
functions as a whole, though just
barely. What is interesting to me
is that boiler rooms do, in fact,
exist; very recently, one such
practice was shut down in New
York, according to a CNN
report. This movie typifies the
present day atmosphere of greed
— many people, both on the
business and the client side, sim
ply have too much money for

their own good.
I recommend this film espe
cially to those of you who are
considering an entrance into the
corporate world. I certainly am,
and I welcomed this opportunity
to find some humor in some of
the empty-headedness oi the
pn jceedings.
