# Sci-fi flick is perfect mix of camp and crap

### LUKE MINER 
Walking a fine line between
camp and crap, "Pitch Black" is a
sci-fi horror film that entertains
by virtue of its sheer awfulness.
Let me start by saying that "Pitch
Black" is a very, very stupid
movie. The plot borrows heavily
from "Alien," "Starship Troop
ers," or almost any Arnold
Schwarznegger movie, the spe
cial effects, by today's post
"Matrix" standards, are dull and
uninspired, and the acting is for
ever overwrought. And yet it is
precisely for these reasons that 1
found this movie so charming.
"Pitch Black" tells the story of
a group of space faring Aus
tralians who run into a meteor
shower and are forced to crash
land on a barren planet. Curi
ously enough this planet bears a
striking resemblance to the Out
back. Among the survivors is a

convicted killer, Riddick (Vin
Diesel) who is being brought

back to prison by a dashing
young bounty hunter, Johns
(Cole Mauser). The captain dies
in the crash, leaving sassy young
Caroline Fry (Rhada Mitchell of
"High Art"), to single-handedly
lead a Muslim cleric, a stowaway,
a weak intellectual type and a
couple of other random Aus
tralians back to Earth. Unfortu
nately this Riddick character,
who apparently loves the smell of
menstrual blood (oh, come now,
who doesn't?), escapes from bis
captor, runs amok in the desert,
and kills one of the survivors.
Or so it seems: As the plot
progresses we learn that Riddick
really isn't such a bad guy. Yes,
he has had bis retinas "shined"
so he can see in the dark; yes, he
has killed a few people. But at
least he isn't a dirty drug addict
like Johns, who shoots cocktails
of morphine and speed into bis
own eyeball. And guess what!

While exploring the murder
scene, Caroline learns that Rid

dick didn't actually kill the
new member. Instead, it was the
work of a species of light-fearing
monsters that live in an enor
mous network of caves beneath
the ground.
When a neighboring planet
blocks the sun, plunging them
all into complete darkness, the
real fun begins. A veritable
horde of nasty chattering crea
tures emerges from under
ground to wreak havoc upon the
hapless survivors.
All seems lost: The only per
son who can see is a homicidal
maniac and half the crew is
promptly gobbled up. Hut then
the weak intellectual remembers
that lie brought several cases of
Jack Daniels with him. Suddenly
things are looking up. Not only
does it go down easy; this fine
sour mash whiskey makes Ibr a
great torch, scaring off all of the
carnivorous monsters.
All of which brings me to a
very important point: People
todav complain that movies have

become too violent, that they
lack the moral element necessary
for the proper development of
this nation's youth. Fortunately,
"Pitch Black" does not fall prey
to the same shortcomings. Its
wholesome Australian message is
a beacon in these troubled times:
drugs are bad, but hard liquor is
good.
"Pitch Black" is full of many
more half-surprises and not-so
witty one-liners. Vin Diesel's per
formance as kiddie k is especialb
over the top, allowing for hours
of hilarity. So if you have an
afternoon to burn and you like
sci -11 B-movies, go see "Pitch
Black." You won't be disappoint
ed.
