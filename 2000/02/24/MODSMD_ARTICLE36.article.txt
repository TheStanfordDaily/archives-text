# 'Wonder' what they were thinking

### ZACH UDKO EDITORIAL STAFF 
"Wonder Boys" is a film that
aims to shock with its off-beat
humor. Whether or not it fulfills
its goal is another story.

Jr. skips jail to play a gay book
editor. Terr) Crabtree spends
hall of the film chasing after a
transvestite (Michael Cavadias)
and the other half after the
young and confused writing stu
dent James (Tobey Maguire).
And a psychotic James Brown
look-alike (Richard Knox), an
ambitious and infatuated teach
er's pet (Katie Holmes), a preg
nant and adulterous chancellor
Sara Gaskell (Frances McDor
mand) and a murdered dog are
all thrown into the mix to make
this ride all the more quirky.
According to press materials,
this is a movie about "Grady
(Douglas) the famous writer who
is also a professor who was avoid
ing the editor (Downey, Jr.) who
came to the party that was
thrown by the chancellor
(McDormand) who was in love
with the writer. . . and this is the
student (Maguire) who could
change his life if onh the writer
would let him." Any questions?
Posters insist that this eccen
tric journey promises to be
unpredictable,
unforgettable." I couldn't agree
more with the first two adjec
tives, but this film is hardly what
it boasts with the third.
(irady is at a breaking point in
his life. 1 le's on page 2,612 of his
newest novel, has just impreg
nated his boss's wife, served as
the accomplice to murder of his
boss's dog, and to make matters
worse, his wile has just walked
out on him.
Crabtree is in his own crisis,
without a successful book since
Grady's last. James revels in
teenage angst and the mark of

genius. Sara faces divorce and a
possible abortion.
But what's more interesting
that any of the baggage these
characters carry is the underly
ing theme of what it means to be
a writer. "Nobody teaches a writ-

er anything,"
Douglas explains. His work went
to hell when lie closed himself off
to the outside world, keeping
only a joint for company. Great
writing comes from exploration,
getting into trouble, facing life's
idiosyncrasies and meeting the
bizarre characters that roam our
streets every day.
Douglas gives a wry and
funny deadpan delivery as
Grady ("I wish you hadn't shot
my girlfriend's dog," he tells
James flatly). Downey, Jr. shows
oil his enormous talent in yet
another role that makes us want
to hit him over the head for
being so dumb„in real Jiie.
McDormand adds stable energy
to the piece, while Maguire goes
through the motions in his
usual slow-talking, wide-eyed
innocent role.
Under "L.A. Confidential"
director Curtis Hanson's keen
guidance, "Wonder Boys"
delights and charms in several
moments. But ultimately, Steven
Cloves' script, which is based 011
Michael Chabon's novel, is
quirkiness for the sake of quirki
ness, and ultimately too reticent
to belong wholly in the realm of
absurdity.
Finally, this film suffers from
chronic horrible ending syn
drome. There is so much poten
tial here, but ultimately it all falls
short of greatness.
