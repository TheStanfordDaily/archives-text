4 112 I Delinquents are back, and
you know they can never be
-A. wack!" That's the beginning of
the catchy hook on the first cut from the
Delinquents' new album, "Bosses Will
Be Bosses, from their own Dank Or Die
Records label.
Please, believe it! The Delinquents
have been holding it down for Oakland

and the Bay Area for nearly a decade
now. Over the years, they have earned
the respect and admiration of a contin
ually increasing fanbase.
In the year 2000, the Delinquents are
back — bigger and better than ever.
And they brought a whole Bay Area Raj)
Mobb with them: Master P, Too Short,
Mack 10, B-Legit, Richie Rich, Yuk
mouth, C-Loc, Young Bleed, The
Whoridas, Brotha Lynch Hung,
3XKrazy, Askari-X, Money-B, The
Dominion, Father Dom, Otis & Sluig,
Rhythm 8c Green, J-Dubb, Harm and
Will from Tony Toni Tone. How does
an independent label manage to get so
many high-profile guest appearances?
What was the process of putting togeth
er this mammoth 18-track CD project?
In an exclusive, wide-ranging interview,
G-Stack and V-Dal of the Delinquents
answer these questions and many more.
What becomes clear is that the Delin
quents are not just back. They're here to
stay.
"Bosses Will Be Bosses"
"Bosses Will Be Bosses," the Delin
quent's filth album, covers a full range of
topics, from the eerie scenario of the last
days on "Armageddon," to the soulful,
moving memories of Africa on " Thinking
About 1 lome" to male-female relationships
on "That Man," a heavily requested record
on KM FT 100.1 right now.
"When we first started on the album,
we really just wanted to do something
better than what we always do. That's
how we always start our albums. We
want to do something to outdo the last
one," G-Stack said, discussing the Delin
quent mentality when approaching this

album. "So, when we started on it, it was
like, 'Okay, let's do this; let's do some
thing for the club; let's do something to
kinda put our edge on to it, put a Delin
quent twang to it.' And so when we
started on it, as usual, we do all our
songs first with just mine and his verse
on them. And after we do our songs
first, we'll sit back and listen to them and
say, 'Okay, well, what would sound good
on this? Master P would sound good on
this one. Mack 10 would sound good on
this one.' And that's how we started

putting the people onto the songs.
That's why the songs sound so tailor
made to what everyone does."
The Delinquents have managed to
maintain a coherence and cohesiveness
rarely found on such broad-ranging
albums.
"We won't know what the song really
means and the vibe it sends until after
he and I lay our vocals onto it. Because
it may just be cool without nobody, you
know what I mean? And it's a challenge
for us to put people on there that are
kinda more known than us, and we still
carry our own weight," G-Stack
explained, speaking directly to the chal
lenge of working with a diverse group of
artists. "So, that's why we chose to get
half the people on there that was a little
bit harder to get for everybody else. And
the other cats, you know, we pretty
much know everybody on the album. . .
. And we just like getting on songs with
cats that bring something to the table,
cats that flow hard, cats that got their
own style. It makes us work harder."
Bay Area artists are known for their for
thier independent approach to the rap
industry, something G-Stack saicl helped
attract many of the guest artists on the
album. "If you notice, most of the cats are
from the Bay Area, or was from the Bay
Area at one point. Since we've been doing
this for eight years, we knew them."
In the Beginning . . .
In discussing this latest album, V-Dal
reminisces on the early days in that hip
hop-back-in-the-day narrative style: "I
started rapping shit, like in the sixth,
fifth grade! So, you know, I had been

rapping, writing, but I had never actu
ally gotten into the production part of it
and laid nothing on a track or nothing.
But 1 always had songs written. And you
know everybody got a Casio keyboard
for Christmas at one point in time. And
I would record. Get the Casio keyboard
and play the beats that was already in
the keyboard, you know, the pre-made
beats that were in there. 1 started right
there. And then I started listening to
instrumentals, as far as buying vinyl,
455, you know what 1 mean? Back then,
that's what they was ... It wasn't CDs. It
was more like vinyl or tape . . . And I
would buy instrumentals and I would
just rap to them, write to them."
How does a fifth grader become
interested in rapping? At eleven years
old, V-Dal knew he was going to make it
in the rap game, but he can't forget
those days when rapping was just a
hobby. Continuing the narrative, he
adds: "Rapping was like a sport. It was a
hobby for me. It wasn't really money.
Back when 1 was in the fifth and sixth
grade, it wasn't no big gold chains and
big cars and mansions, you know what I
mean? It was on a small level. So, you
know, it was a sport for me. You know
the biggest material item that was prob
ably involved back then was a big gold
chain, as far as anything that was mate
rialistic. But it wasn't like you see now —
you see the Puffys with the Bentleys and
the Rolexes. It wasn't about that. It was
a sport. It started like, I guess, from
poetry. I used to write poetry when I
was younger." Those who knew V-Dal
in elementary school will tell you that he
used to take an entire book, and rap the
words just to make it more interesting!
Coming Up Out Oakland
The Delinquents can be seen riding
through East Oakland to West Oakland.
When you see that big. Delinquent-dec
orated bus riding through your hood,
you know it's G-Stack and V-Dal. That
famous bus was parked in the lot of the
Oakland Coliseum during a concert last
month put on by Cash Money Records
that ended in mayhem. Through it all,
The Delinquents could be seen
"breakin' bread" with the people of "the
Town."
When asked about coming up in
Oakland, G-Stack answers with a sense
of pride. "Born and raised."
"To me, to be from Oakland, I mean,
I wouldn't want to be from nowhere
else. Because we from Oakland," V-Dal
adds. "We don't got gangbangin here,
you know what I mean? We're a urban
city so we got out share of problems, like
every other urban area, but we don't
have gangbangin'. And il it's some prob
lems, it's more than likely it's personal
problems between individuals. Just like
the stuff that happened at the Cash
Money concert. It happened that the
Coliseum is in Oakland. We don't have
a Coliseum in Richmond. We don't have
a Coliseum in Hayward. We don't have
a Coliseum in Stanford, you know what
1 mean? So, based on the fact that it's
based in Oakland, we get that negative
stigma. But they don't realize that when
you throw a Cash Money concert, you
got people coming from Pali Alto [East
Palo Alto], Richmond, Fresno, San
Francisco, Sacramento. So, you know,

it's just some more stigma to throw on
top. We done had our fair share of drug
kingpins, out fair share of killings,
shootings.
"But, J mean, everybody got prob
lems. And Oakland is a good place," V-
Dal said, laughing. "And if 1 had to do it
all over again. I'd do it the same way!"
through the years, Oakland has
staked out its territory on the Hip Hop
World Map. One of the most recogniz
able names coming out of the Oakland
tradition is the multi-platinum artist,
Too Short, who is currently working on
his umpteenth album. Growing up in
"the O," you had to hear some Too
Short.
"My uncles, they used to get a hold of
Too Short — Special Request. Too
Short wasn't even exploited at all. He
wasn't even known," V-Dal said,
recounting his first time hearing Too
Short. "Basically, he was just known in
Oakland, because lie made mixtapes.
He hung out at the park. And you'd pay
him for the tapes and he would go
home, he would rap on a instrumental,
which would be somebody else's beat,
like Buffalo Girls or something. And il
you had a spec ial request, you'd pay
him extra, and he'd put your name in it
and that was your tape. He didn't have
a record deal. He used to buy tapes
from Thrifty's (or wherever he'd buy
tapes from) and go home and record
them. And tnv uncles and them would
get a hold of him. It was Too Short and
it was Freddie B. They were like on the
same level... I would listen to them and

they kinda inspired me because I knew
that they weren't like no major artists.
You could tell that thev was in the
house, taping their own tapes, and sell
ing them!"
2000 and Beyond
The Delinquents have been busy this
past month doing a variety of activities
in the community. 1 hey are among a
core group of hip hop artists now speak
ing out against Proposition 21, which

would allow young teenagers to be sen
tenced as adults. 1 hey will he speaking
;it local middle schools and high schools,
as they have done in the past, to help
raise awareness about the proposition to
die very constituency that it is most like
ly to affect il it passes.
"|list go ahead and vote noon Propo
sition 21," G-Stack urged. "And il you
don't vote, you can't blame the white
man as to why you didn't vote!" The
urgency in G-Stack's voice serves to
remind voters that the March 7 vote on
Proposition 21 is rapidly approaching.
(.-Stack also places the proposition in
a broader context, encouraging African
American youth and other youth of
color to vote. "Just keep it positive, man.
Everybody needs to go back to being
more consciously aware of what they're
doing. I mean, when we were growing
up, you know how they used to say, 'It
takes a village to raise a child?' Really, a
village used to try to raise a child. Now,
it's like, 'Don't you say nothing to my
baby! Don't you do that to my baby!'
Now, it's back to all on me to raise my
child, but how can someone do that
when they drink and they smoke coke,
you know what I mean? So, now, it's like
nobody's raising the children. They're
children of the state. What I'm sup
posed to say?"
The Delinquents are not about to
slow down any time soon.
"We got the DNA Project — the
Delinquents and Askari X — coming
out. Our w hole catalog of Dank or Die
should be available by April. All five

albums. We got The Dominion coming
out in late 2000. We got Chris Lockett
coming out in late 2000," \ -Dal said.
"And basicalK that's all we're working
on right now, and focusing on getting
all of them done correctly."
The Delinquents, Askari-X, DT,
Chris Lockett. and the rest of The
Dominion will be coming strong and
representing the Bay Area to the fullest.
C-Stack lias the final word. "Yeah, it's
gonna be hot. Look forward to Dank or
Die doin' it in 2000!"
