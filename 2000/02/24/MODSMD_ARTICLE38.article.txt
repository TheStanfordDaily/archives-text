# Helium singer's solo debut is solid
## 
### JUNG LAH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a 1997 Village Voice article
about Mary Timony's band Heli
um, Ten i Sutton said that Timo
ny wouldn't fit in at the Lilith
Fair "because she says it straight
up: the Queen of Fire wants to
fuck unicorns." And in this one
statement, we see the somewhat
problematic reputation following
I imony in her musical career
that has led us to her latest offer
ing, a solo album called "Moun
tains."
I imony established her rock
world credentials by playing in
the post-punk Dischord Records
band Autoclave in the early '90s.
Since then, her adventurous gui
tar work has flourished. Her
band Helium's melding of new
wave and prog rock (with a pen
chant towards fantasy-based
lyrics stemming from Timony's
appreciation for Lord Of The
Rings) has proved someone who
cannot seem to escape the classi
fication of gender can still suc
ceed.
Timony is comparable to Liz
Phair in that her musical talents
have been overshadowed by her
looks and the suggestiveness of

her lyrics. In interviews, it almost
seemed like Timony played up
the "feminine" aspect of her
music. With lines such as "the
only good man is a dead man," it
is understandable to see why a
lot of the press surrounding
Timony's past is more associated
with her image as a "Queen of
Fire" than with her unconven
tional take on traditional pop.
Indeed, no one can deny
Helium's success as a force in the
art rock world after four record
releases on Matador Records.
1997 marked the last new Heli
um album, and with a March 7,
2000 street date set for "Moun
tains," also on Matador, Timony
is again attracting a fair amount
of attention in the not-so-main
stream critical music circles.
As a debut solo piece, "Moun
tains" is definitely a less forceful
entry, at least in terms of vol
ume. A slow-paced and mellow
album from start to finish, Timo
ny barely ever raises her voice to
anything above the sparse drum
work, viola, and harpsichord
that accompany her singing. The
fifteen tracks all feel similar in
terms of structure and sound,
entrenched in string instrument
backgrounds, but they offer an

interesting take on music that
sound like a mixture of indie
rock and something you would
hear at the Renaissance Faire.
The song titles themselves call
to mind a Renaissance feel, with
names like "Dungeon Dance"
and"The Golden Fruit," whose
lyrics discuss horse riding and
forbidden apples in the context
of yearning to break free of oth
ers' expectations.
"1 fire myself," Tiinom says in
the third song on the album, and
perhaps she's speaking the truth.
"Mountains" is her way of dis
tancing herself from a supra
feminized image and instead
relying on musical innovation to
produce a record that may not
be the most exciting thing you've
ever heard, but is certainly a
solid first solo effort. Expect
more from Timony, both on her
own and with Helium, in the
very near future.
