### MONYA DE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Eleanor: Her Secret Jour
ney," playing at the Marines
Memorial Theater in San Fran
cisco, opens with a fleeting pho
tographic journey through the
life of the famous first lady. The
dialogue that follows is like the
photographs; full of information,
yet missing elements that tell a
complete story.
Jean Stapleton ("You've Got
Mail," "Dr. Doolittle"), a 77-year
old acting veteran who your par
ents will remember from her
years with "All In The Family,"
transcends time to bring this
one-woman portrait of Eleanor
Roosevelt to life. Under the
direction of John Tillinger, the
play moves rapidly through
moments of history and histori
cal fiction that shape this portrait
of the First Lady.
Rhoda Lerman's script, writ
ten with Stapleton in mind, often
falls into heavy-handed exposi
tion in order to move the story
along. But with this much buried
history to cover, Eleanor must
start from scratch. "Eleanor"
takes place in 1945, the year
Franklin Roosevelt died. She is
being asked to serve the United
Nations, but insists that her pub
lic life is over. Yet, through flash
backs, she begins to recall all that
she has suffered, all that has
made her strong — and recon
siders.
Beneath the tough, proud
exterior lies an insecure woman,
thrust into the public glare and

gamely trying to deal with her
husband's adultery with White
House social secretary Lucy Mer
cer. Her rebellious and progres
sive nature is in direct conflict
with the role of the first lady, and
this is nowhere more apparent
than in her shock during a tour
of a battlefield. As Franklin raves
about the brilliance of the trench
arrangement, she cannot stop
thinking about the thousands of
men who died in the trenches
themselves, without emerging.
Her feminine perspective
brings to light incidents and rev
elations that have been either
unspoken 01 considered mun
dane. In an especially humorous
sequence on domestic political
life, Eleanor chats with Teddy
Roosevelt, who tells her that her
husband should be president.
She only mentions it to FDR
after Teddy is dead, and FDR is
furious; "I would have asked him
to make a formal announcement
on my behalf]" Eleanor is also
the one person who realizes that
nobody won the war; the war
itself won. A word she repeats
over and over is "ambivalence,"
and ambivalent she is — about
her roles, about her husband,
and about her purpose in life.
Stapleton is a captivating
actress. It is impossible not to
become involved with Eleanor's
story and gasp with dismay when
FDR's affair is revealed. Staple
ton differentiates a wide array of
characters with apparent ease,
including gruff military men,
her masculine mother-in-law,
and FDR himself. Her portrayal

of the latter is particularlv good.
She captures the grandiose
nature as well as the inner con
flicts of the President.
She is also a master of deadpan
humor, tossing off" one-liners with
the gravest of faces as the audience
howls with laughter.
Austere musical interludes,
such as the lonely "Meditation
from Ihais" by Jules Massenet,
and subtle light changes provide
the transitions between
vignettes. The music is more
effective in this production, how
ever, when it augments Staple
ton's lines. For example, in
recalling the jolly harmonica
playing of an Army sergeant,
Eleanor's speech quickens and
rises in pitch in synchrony with
the music.
Light is also used as the main
source of scenery, sometimes
with great success and sometimes
not. Several times during the
evening, it was difficult to dis
cern what the backdrop patterns
were symbolizing. Although it
ends abruptly and leaves ques
tions unanswered, the play is a
must for any history buff or fem
inist. It is a thought-provoking
account of a woman who sur
vived "not only war, but mar
riage" to come into her own as a
crusader for peace.
