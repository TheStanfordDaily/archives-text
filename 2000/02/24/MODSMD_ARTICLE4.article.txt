# Six-year-old acing Stanford physics

### KEITH ITO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It is not often that you will find a six-year-old
who spends his evenings writing essays about
"The Iliad" and examining the subtleties of
Newtonian mechanics. But then, Justin Chap
man is not your average six-year-old.
Chapman, who was still in diapers when cur
rent Stanford freshmen were entering high
school, has been taking college-level courses on
line through Stanford's Education Program for
Gifted Youth for about a year.
This month, he made headlines when he of
ficially enrolled in a class at the Universitv of

Rochester, becoming perhaps the youngest col
lege student in history. "1 love learning," Chap
man said, "It just comes at a faster pace for me."
Chapman, who lives in upstate New Vork, of
ficially registered for a University of Rochester
history course this semester. I fe has earned
grades of "A" and "IV on all of his assignments
so far, including a paper about Babylonian cre
ation myths and"The Iliad."
Rochester administrators say Chapman is
the type of student who comes along once in a
lifetime." I don't know of any others his age who
are qualified [to attend college]," said Tom Ri
cley, University of Rochester spokesman. "And
I don't think we'll be seeing any more anytime

soon."
The instructors at the Sum ford program
who regularly deal with highly gifted youth
were equally astounded by Chapman's age.
"The first time we had an online session, 1
didn't know his age. He writes very well. 1 as
sumed he was at least ten," said Gary Oas,
Chapman's physics instructor at EI'CY. "Then
one day his mother called and mentioned, 'By
the way, he's five years old.' 1 just said, 'Wow!'"
Oas said that Chapman is incredibly self-mo
tivated, attending every online problem session
and often staying to talk afterwards.
"I le has a voracious appetite lot
learning," said Oas. "I've never
had a student who was that inter
ested in learning, even at the uni
veisitv level." He recalled a time
when he was working a problem
with Chapman and happened to
mention that it was based on the
l*»ok "Ringworld."
" I lie next time I talked to him,
he told me, I've read about half of
it, and it's an interesting book,' "
Oas said.
I lie KI'CY program was found
ed at Stanford in 1985 with the goal
providing academically gifted
students an opportunity to take
courses l>eyoncl their grade level.
Since then, it has grown to in
«hnle over 2.200 students from 28
countries. Students listen to digi
tized lectures on CD-ROM at their
own pace, and take both online
and written examinations.
They also have an opportunity
to interact with KI'CY stall in "vir
tual classrooms" where students
.ind instructors can meet online to
discuss course material.
"A program like KI'CY is very
important," Chapman said. "I
learn better when I can learn on
n»v own time, not when someone

tells me I have too. If I leel like
doing some lectures at 2 a.m., I c an.
II I want to spend the whole day
learning about thermodynamics, I
can."
Despite KPGY's help, Chap
man's quest tor academic success
has not come easily. When his
mother Klizabeth tried to enroll
him at a local elementary school in
1996, he was sent home alter sev
eral days when administrators dis
covered that he was only three
years old.
Chapman's mother also ran into
problems trying to borrow text
books from a local high school for
her son. "Some people have dilli
culty seeing past my age," Chap
man said. "I leel society becomes
accustomed to what the 'norm' is
and cannot see past those typical
stereotypes."
As a result, Ms. Chapman has
home-schooled her son. year,
he enrolled at Cambridge Acade
my. a correspondence school in
Ocala, Florida.
"He's amazing," said Cam
bridge Superintendent lanzee
Nalias. "He's already completed
two years of coursework in the year
that he's been enrolled, and that
doesn't count the college work
yet."
Chapman has initiated an Inter
net-based letter writing campaign
aimed at ending age cliscrimina

tion in public schools. "Everyone
should Ik* allowed to learn at their
own pate," lie said.
"Their age should not dictate
how far they can go."
He has also delivered speeches
at school board meetings and writ
ten a guest column in a local news
paper in an effort to gain publicity
for his cause.
Recently, publicity is something
that Chapman has seen no short
age of. Since appearing on the
front page of the New York Post
last week, Chapman has been in
undated with public attention.
I le has met with New York Gov.
George Pataki and is juggling invi
tations from talk show hosts includ
ing Rosie O'Donnell and Maury
Povich.
"1 was surprised how quickly the
word spread about me and how
supportive people are about my
ideas. I think that the more people
know about age discrimination the
better," Chapman said.
As for the future, Chapman
plans on taking the SAT this sum
mer and applying to colleges next
year if his mother approves.
"It was hard enough convincing
[her] to let me attend part-time,"
he said. "I am happy the way my
schooling is now. 1 have plenty of
both high school and college cours
es to keep mt* learning for a long
time."
