It is not often that you will find a six-year-old
who spends his evenings writing essays about
"The Iliad" and examining the subtleties of
Newtonian mechanics. But then, Justin Chap
man is not your average six-year-old.
Chapman, who was still in diapers when cur
rent Stanford freshmen were entering high
school, has been taking college-level courses on
line through Stanford's Education Program for
Gifted Youth for about a year.
This month, he made headlines when he of
ficially enrolled in a class at the Universitv of

Rochester, becoming perhaps the youngest col
lege student in history. "1 love learning," Chap
man said, "It just comes at a faster pace for me."
Chapman, who lives in upstate New Vork, of
ficially registered for a University of Rochester
history course this semester. I fe has earned
grades of "A" and "IV on all of his assignments
so far, including a paper about Babylonian cre
ation myths and"The Iliad."
Rochester administrators say Chapman is
the type of student who comes along once in a
lifetime." I don't know of any others his age who
are qualified [to attend college]," said Tom Ri
cley, University of Rochester spokesman. "And
I don't think we'll be seeing any more anytime

soon."
The instructors at the Sum ford program
who regularly deal with highly gifted youth
were equally astounded by Chapman's age.
"The first time we had an online session, 1
didn't know his age. He writes very well. 1 as
sumed he was at least ten," said Gary Oas,
Chapman's physics instructor at EI'CY. "Then
one day his mother called and mentioned, 'By
the way, he's five years old.' 1 just said, 'Wow!'"
Oas said that Chapman is incredibly self-mo
tivated, attending every online problem session
and often staying to talk afterwards.
