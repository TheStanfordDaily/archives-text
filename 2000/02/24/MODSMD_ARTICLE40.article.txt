# Golden Hitchcock highlights
## 
### 
Ghances are you don't have
the necessary 50 or so hours of
free time to watch all 30 of the
remaining movies in the Stan
ford Theater's Alfred Hitchcock
film festival.
Don't worry. 1 he festival is
diverse, the double features are
marvelously assembled, and you
can catch all the Hitchcock you
need in the span of one or two
weekends. Here's a look at some
festival must-sees.
"Notorious" and "Shadow of a
Doubt," March 9-12. One is
famous, the other a touch
obscure, but both these films
offer first-rate sinister suspense.
Regarded by many as Hitch
cock's greatest work, 19 Mi's
"Notorious" tells the story of a
I S. agent (Gary Grant) and a
notorious party girl (Ingrid
Bergman), who infiltrate a gang
of post-war holdover Na/i plot
ting one last German conquest in
South America.
Grant, Bergman and (Maude
Rains turn in three of the best
performances ever in a Hitch
cock film.
"Shadow of a Doubt," written in
part by Thornton Wilder and
released in 1943, is a lesser
known tale of small-town family
deceit. Set (and filmed on loca
tion in) Santa Rosa, Hitchcock

tracks (he road from idolatry to
fear through the eyes of a young
woman who gradually discovers
the truth about her favorite
uncle.
"Strangers on a Train," March
16-19 (playing with "Lifeboat").
Based on a book by Patricia
Highsmith, the same woman
who wrote " The Talented Mr.
Ripley," "Strangers" is the story
of a tennis champion trapped by
a smooth-talking psychopath
into a murder pact. Whatever
you do, don't miss the first live
minutes: the film includes a clas
sic opening sequence widely
regarded as one of the best in
movie history.
"Rear Window" and"The Man
Who Knew Too Much," March
23-29. Two classics, both featur
ing the incomparable James
Stewart looking nothing like
George Bailey here. The former
has Stewart playing a voyeuristic
reporter confined to his apart
ment by a broken leg; in the lat
ter. a remake of Hitchcock's
1934 British film of the same
name, he plays a man whose
daughter is kidnapped after he
and his wife (Doris Day) hear a
dying secret agent detail a mur
der plot. Day steals the show,
though, with her Oscar-winning
rendition of "Que Sera Sera."

"Vertigo" and "Rope," March 30
through April 5. If you only see
one double-feature all festival,
see this one. "Vertigo" is a psy
chological-thriller masterpiece
that gripped theater audiences,
critics and film students alike.
The acting (Stewart and Kim
Novak in the leads) is superb and
the scenery (in and around San
Francisco) more than a touch
familiar.
"Rope," made 10 years earlier in
1948, is an experimental film
that flopped at the box office and
with initial critics but whose leg
end has grown over time. Hitch
cock shot the movie, a story of
murder for kicks set at a high
rise dinner party, in continuous
10 minute takes. There are no
quick cuts or edits — the effect
throughout the film is of one
long, constant scene.
"North by Northwest," April 6-9
(with "To Catch a Thief'). If
you're looking for haunting
images (and Gary Grant's best
acting in a Hitchcock film), check
out this 1959 piece of absurdist
scenery. Watch it for the crop
duster scene and the Mt. Rush
more climax, if nothing else.
