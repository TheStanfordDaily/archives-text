(lollege students contemplate sex a
lot. Stanford students think about
careers and money pretty often, too.
I In is. ii should come as no surprise
di.»t, amidst the Internet start-ups and
the uiklct-'JI millionaires swarming
allovet Silicon Valley, an enterprising
student with sex on the brain has
turned tlicit entrepreneurial thinking
in a new direction.
Meet lit it Morgan (her name's
been changed, naturally), a junior
who (ame up with an idea for a "Most
I liings Phallic" shop she hopes to
open <ilu-i graduation.
"This world is stock lull of phallic
things, Morgan told Miss Sass while
polishing her llute. "Look around
\oiii loom. I plan to till the store with
everything that has a phallic resem
blance.
"We'll have a food section with
items like carrots, zucchinis, cucum
bers, bananas, sausages, popsicles, lol
lipops, corn dogs and egg rolls. We'll
have phallic-shaped of lice equipment
including pens, glue sticks and mini
pencil sharpeners. We'll have a com
plete line ol bath and body products
like lotion dispensers, toothpaste, hair
spray bottles, curling irons and hair
dryers. Basically anything that squirts

or discharges
has a phallic
quality to it,
right? I also
hope to include
a tourist section
with miniatures
of Hoover
lower, the Eif
fel lower the
Empire State
Building and
other buildings
suggestive of a
penis. Then
there will lie a

lot of miscellaneous items like cactus
es, bottles, candles, baseball bats,
umbrellas and spray cans."
The store will even include Miss
Sass's favorite midnight snack: penis
pasta. Seriously, honey. The only
phallic items lacking are penises
themselves.
Miss Sass hopes Morgan will
include items of all sizes in order to
empower men about their penis
size — after all, if pencil erasers are
considered just as phallic as Hoover
lower at Most Things Phallic, then
size shouldn't have much effect on
perceptions of manhood.
Morgan insists her vision resem
bles a convenience store rather than a
kinky sex shop. She declares that any
one who thinks of it only as a novelty
store is completely missing the point.
"This would be a really useful
store," she said as she smoked a
cigarette. "Sometimes you know you
want something, but you have no idea
where to shop for it. Now, you just
have to think about whether it's phal
lic or not — if it is, you know where to
go. In this store we classify by shape
rather than purpose, which is a much
more natural way of thinking about a
product. Eventually you'll be trained

to think about items in a new way."
Morgan's business idea may be
unique, but Miss Sass notes that her
fascination with the penis is not. The
Greeks were so fascinated by the erect
penis that phallic monuments and
phallic amulets were common. The
use of these phallic symbols was not
intended to be obscene, frivolous, or
erotic. Rather, the Greeks associated
phallic symbols with protection, fertil
ity and immortality.
Phallic worship was also an impor
tant part of Roman religion. Phallic
symbols were endowed with magical
powers such as deflecting the force of
the "evil eye." A legacy of this belief is
the word "fascinate," which is derived
from fascinum, a Latin term for penis
that originally meant "bewitchment."
Freud, too, was fascinated by phallic
symbols and translated their presence
in dreams into a sexual significance.
Morgan got the idea after hanging
around 112 riends who had a tendency to
see everything as phallic.
"I used to have a guy friend who
you seriously could not eat a banana
in front of because he had such an
adolescent mind. I le trained me in
the art of seeing the phallicism in
everything," she said. "But seriously,
everyone loves phallic things. College
students will visit the store for kicks,
and I'm sure that even little old ladies
and sketchy old men will be interested
in checking it out. Even little kids love
phallic things-they put them in their
mouths all the time."
Miss Sass expects some people will
visit the store with hopes of expand
ing their sexual horizons with the use
of ordinary objects. Why order a dildo
when you could buy roll-on deodor
ant from Most Things Phallic and get
a two-for-one deal?
Morgan envisions the store as a 24-
hour K-Mart style quick stop with a

more intimate atmosphere, prefer
ably located in 1 ressider Union. She
hopes to feature shopping bags that
look like condoms and advertise
ments with phrases like "Only alter
several visits will the experience truly
penetrate you."
"It's important that it be conve
niently located," she said. "Sometimes
you need an aspirin; then again,
sometimes you just crave something
phallic. Our logo will be 'Big Enough
to Satisfy.'"
Morgan plans to price competitive
ly, but she expects people will In
happy to pay for the convenience and
community atmosphere.
"Sex sells," she notes. "Plus, we'll
have a high-quality brand name."
Morgan said she's willing to open
more stores across the country if slit
sees demand for her products.
"My goal is not expansion, but cer
tainly if sales go up, I'll get excited,"
she said. "1 wouldn't mind getting a
taste of some other business commu
nity."
