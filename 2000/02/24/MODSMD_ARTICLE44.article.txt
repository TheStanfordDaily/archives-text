# 'Stomp' bangs out a slamminâ€™, rhythmic sound
## 
### LAUREN RUSSELL EDITORIAL STAFF 
I heir Coca-Cola and Target commercials
are definitely a sell-out. And if you saw them
on Letterman or Oprah, you were probably
not completely blown away.
But regardless of the over-commercialized
hype that it has been getting in recent years,
"Stomp," which plays in San Jose until Satur
day, is nothing short of absolutely incredible.
"Stomp" originated in the U.K. in 1991 and
has exploded into popularity with its mix of
what the New York Post describes as "mime,
dance, kabuki, martial arts, and street llair."
Sound confusing? It is.
"Stomp" is certainly an art form of its own.
This is one of many good reasons why you
have probably heard of this worldwide phe
nomenon.
The show delivers unstoppable percussion
and a unique, stirring form of dance with the
ingenious help of some brooms, a few sinks,
garbage cans, pipes, and objects generally
regarded as trash. Perhaps the coolest thing
about Stomp is this: A two-hour long rhythm
and dance performance is given with the use
of the body and tilings that could be found in
any garbage dumpster.
And that it delivers. Hoy does it deliver!

How on earth entertainers like this came
into existence is beyond me.
I he performers, who dance an impressive
modern hybrid oi'jazz tap, also manage to pull
oil resounding and perfectly timed percussion
performances in which they innovatively beat
on everything they can get their hands on,
including their own bodies. Jaws drop and
grins widen at the sight and sound of "Stomp."
The choreography of movement and sound
is simply stunning.
While there are some booming moments
where walls full of tin cans, metal signs, pans
and trash cans are banged on by nine syn
chronous performers with enormous sticks, it
is also interesting to watch several of them
develop a musical number with two paper
lunch bags, a slurpee cup, and a match box. ()t
a performance in the dark created simply by
opening Zippo-lighters rhythmically.
There is a good mix of loud, complex per
cussion and simple-yet-awe-inspiring percus
sion in Stomp.
It will make yon lean forward in your seat
by turning the ordinary into the extraordi
nary.
And I doubt I am the only audience mem
bet who played on my steering wheel on the
way home - and the bathroom sink, and my
Spanish book - you get the pic ture.
