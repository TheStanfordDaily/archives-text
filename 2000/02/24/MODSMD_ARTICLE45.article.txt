### ENO SARRIS 
My (iuide to Procras
tination's newest chapter
covers perhaps the
broadest and most pop
ulated area of the Inter
net — music. I, myself,
have converted my com
pute! into an expensive
music box of some soil,
with just llie bare mini-

mum of my computers space devoted to such lofiy ideals
as e-mail and Microsoft Word. Yes, those illegal little MP3s
dominate my computer — and yet somehow I don t
expect the Internet Police to come knocking on my little
virtual door any time soon.
MP3s are hand) buggers, and at the center of the
online music industry, illegal or not. I he problem is that
you can't really build youi site around the dispersal of
MP3s (which is what everyone wants) because you will be
arrested. And quickly.
Unless you are clever like the fellows at
www.napster.com and www.scour.net, and you only
make legal space for people to trade illegal megabytes
back and forth. Sound fishy.'' It is, but then again, I have
some kickin' Phish bootlegs on my computer without all
the work of pen-paling with some phreak (as fun as they
probably would be).
Of the two, I recommend Napster. Scour works like a
search portal, a Yahoo for M P!is, but returns anyone who
has ever used Scour and owns the song you want. I hat
doesn't necessarily mean the person has his computer on
and you can download that new Christina Aguilera.
Napster is actually a search program that you down
load. I lie engine, once you limit the hits to computers
with good connections, only returns songs that you can
download* immediately and quickly. Because when you
need that Aguilera whine, you need that whine.
www.MP3.coin is a completely different approach to
the use of MI 'lis online — the bad one. Since the owners
of MP3.com would rather not be imprisoned, they have
opted for Irving to be a launching board for the success of
unsigned artists. I his means you won't be able to find a
single MP3 from anyone you have ever heard of. If you
have all the time iu the world, check it out. You just might
find the next Built to Spill iu there somewhere, among the
millions of artists the site oflei s.
I I you would really like a site to bump to, try a different
format. Streaming audio formats can be listened to with
plug-ins like Real Audio and /or Windows Media Agent
(even if they don't sound familiar, you probably have one
or the other, trust me), don't sound as clear as MP3s, as
their method of compression is slightly less well thought
out. I he upside, though, is that without committing a mis
demeanor vou can hear dope artists.
An incredible example of a streaming audio site would
be www.undergroundhiphop.com. If you like hip-hop,
you will love this site. You can peruse their top 25, their
singles library, or even check out some of the newest
instrumental tracks. Hopefully they've paid their copy
right fees — otherwise they'll have some lawvers knocking
on their doors soon enough. But for now at least, you can
hear some lat tracks from Akrobatik to Mystic Journey
men to i gly Duckling (those of us that got tlie chance to
listen to these fools at the Roots concert may c hoose to stay
away from I )u< kling).
If drum and bass is more your thing, try www.pirate
radio.eo.uk. You can either listen to streams set up by the
site, or find yourself a pirate radio show to listen to.
There's even a l)J section if you really know your English
drum and bass scene well.
This takes me to the last worthwhile type of internet
music — radio stations, www.broadcast.com is a good
portal, letting you find even your favorite radio station
from high school. I was delighted recently by the discov
er) that Boston's W.YAT was online, and then surprised to
find that I no longer found the station as stimulating.
Realaudio.stanford.edu is actually the only place I now
indulge in online radio, as it is the home of the Zoo, our
favorite KZSI'.
Iu any case, the variety of music sites out there makes
cyberspace your aural oyster. (lo eat.
