# Dealing with the humanity of 'Mr. Death'
## 
### MICHAEL BAER STAFF WRITER 
Frrol Morris is perhaps the
most lamous documentary film
maker <>l modern limes, hut, due
lo ihe current state of documen
tal \ film in popular culture (or its
lac k of one), he's virtually
unknown.
Ills most popular films, "The
I liin Ulue Line." "A Uriel' History
ol lime," «iii(l "Fast, Cheap, and
Out ol Control," are all movies
about which we could say, "Oh
yeah, I had a friend who saw it
.iihl realh liked it." Hut when it
conies time to go to the theater
ourselves, we'd rather deal with
the "Matrix" than a real look at
the justice system, cosmology, or
true genius.
F.i rol's latest film, "Mr. Death
I lie Rise and Fall of Fred A.
Leuchter Jr.," opening tomor
row at the San Jose Camera
Cinemas, is yet another look at
.in obsessive soul, someone
whom the viewer could either
admire or disdain for his ideas
and his passion for them. The
subject of this film, Fred
Leuchter, started his career
designing machines for lawful
execution, and effectively ended

it with a "professional conclu
sion" which gave fuel to the fire
of Holocaust deniers and pariah
status to Leuchter.
Fred Leuchter Jr. grew up
around the prison system, his
father having been a guard. As
such, he obtained a firm grasp on
the social and technical aspects of
this system, which lie shares with
us in this film. He also recounts
the horror of "modern" execution
devices, with which everything
could (and did) go wrong. He
resolved to fix this.
He started, with no training,
by understanding the technical
details of the electric chair, and
went to Tennessee system with his
ideas. From there, he redesigned
and refurbished their outdated
chair. It was a success (from Ten
nessee's viewpoint, anyway), and
Leuchter went on to redesign gas
chambers, gallows, and lethal
injection systems.
Describing them Leuchter
takes us in to a social world most
of us — even thpse who support
the death penalty — would rather
ignore. He takes pride in giving
inmates a dignified and humane
death, as well as making execu
tion easier and safer for the
guards and other witnesses. He

also takes pride in his technical
work; he tells us how the
machines work and what could go
wrong. However, this is not an
arrogant pride one would associ
ate with hubris, something many
later accused him of.
These accusations are associat
ed wilh his final career move:
Being hired by Ernst Ziindel, a
Holocaust revisionist on trial for
publications make in Canada.
Ziindel decided that the best
defense was a good offense, and
sent Leuchter to communist
Poland to examine Auschwitz gas
chambers and determine whether
their historically-reported use was
accurate.
Leuchter broke Polish law by
sneaking into the decrepit cham
bers and taking samples as well as
making measurements. His work
was painstaking, and many
around him, including his new
bride, were puzzled and unhappy
about the course it took.
Leuchter felt that as one of the
only experts on death machines,
he was the one who should help
Ziindel, who Leuchter says was on
trial as a result of exercising free
speech and was entitled to a fair
trial. Others, both those for and
against Ziindel, feel Leuchter was

"a mouse of a man" off on "a
grand adventure."
Whatever the case, his conclu
sion — that these chambers never
could have been used for mass
murder — resulted in shock and
in his personal downfall. Even in
the (ace of true experts — engi
neers and historians — wjth solid
explanations and better proof,
Leuchter maintained his claim.
He saw it himself, and his mind
was made up. He had been suc
cessful at all his engineering
endeavors and now thought lie
could play Sherlock Holmes, an
investigator, a scientist. But as
Holocaust historian Robert Jan
Van Pelt noted, he was no Sher
lock.
That's the story, but the devil
(and the fascination) is in the
details, from Leuchter's 40 cup-a
day coffee habit, to his failed
attempt to sell an execution
machine through the want ads.
Many of these are shared in the
film, though some things, like a
good timeline, are ft ustratingly
omitted. The film absorbs the
viewer, who can look on in admi
ration, fascination, and disgust, at
all parties— Leuchter, his allies,
and his enemies. The camera
style is varied, first reminding the

viewer of MTV more than I'BS,
but soon, drawn into the film's
story, the audience is absorbed in
the world Morris presents us. Mis
bias is difficult to detect, and
most viewers will be able to sym
pathize with the views ol both
Leuchter and his detractors, even
il we don't understand all their
actions.
