The Freshman Book program aims to bring high-profile authors to campus
to address l-Hum students. This year's featured speaker was Arcadia'' play
wright Tom Stoppard (right), wno won an Academy Award last year for Best
Screenplay with the acclaimed film "Shakespeare in Love "
Passage" by Charles Johnson.
This year, the freshman class was
given the play "Arcadia" by Tom
Stoppard.
Some freshmen said they felt
that the book project was not
worthwhile. Many said that they
neither read "Arcadia" nor at
tended Stoppard's lecture on Jan.
10. Elam said that 500 freshmen
went to the lecture, or less than
one-third of the class.
"1 just didn't have the time,"
said freshman Michael Stat, who is
taking the Structured Liberal Ed
ucation I-Hum sequence. "I had
so much other SLE reading that I
just couldn't get around to it."
According to Elam, "It's fool
hardy to expect that every fresh
man read it. It's the second year
[of the program]; we figure this is
a program that will grow ."
Complicating matters further,
students in SLE and the "Litera
ture of Transformation" I-Hum
sequence will read "Arcadia" in
spring quarter. But Stoppard's

lecture was in January.
Elam said the book project was
meant to be an addendum to the
freshman curriculum rather than
an element of it.
"We purposely don't want it on
the reading list of courses so that
students can come to it on their
own," he said.
Despite criticism from faculty
and students, the program does
have several strong supporters.
Freshman Cindy Keeler said,
"It's a good idea with good possi
bilities. The problem is a lot of
people don't read it, but [that's]
their loss." Keeler said she en
joyed reading "Arcadia."
Elam stressed his belief that if
the program encouraged even a
small minority of freshmen to look
at their work or at the humanities
in a new light, then it would have
achieved its goal.
"It's not something you can
measure in that quantitative way
. . . maybe the impact won't be felt
until years later."
According to the project's Web
site, "Students are encouraged to
read [the book] on their own so
that conversations about this text
will emerge without faculty inter

vention or course assignments."
Ani Manichaikul, a freshman,
said, "I would have liked to talk
about it more in class. I know ilie
idea was to have us discuss it with
each other, but that didn't really
happen."
Buc cautioned against lending
too much weight to the complaints
of students about the lx>ok pro
ject. He said. "No matter what we
do, I-Hutn. as CIV was, will Ik- a
focus for frosh disaffection. Any
mandatory shared experience is."
"This does not mean, of course,
that professors should not work to
improve it." Buc added.
Buc's suggested answer to
some of these criticisms is the use
of many books in this project',
rather than just one. He said. "I
am of the opinion that we need
more of a core of readings flexible
to adapt this core to the dillerent
tracks."
The project is currently pro*-
ceedingas planned in the midst <>l
the discussion about possible
changes. Although next year's
book and author have not Ixvn se
lected yet, Elam predicts that the
choice will be finalized within a
few weeks.
