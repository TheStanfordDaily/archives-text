### KATHY VERMAZEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Five Stanford students, all members of Stu
dents for Knvironmental Action at Stanford, at
tended a meeting last night to speak out against
llie Medical Sch<x>l's practice of processing its
utedkal waste in a low-income Oakland neigh
bootliood.
"In i in >t a sc iei itist or engineer but one <>112 mat ly
< Hi/ens who deserve clean water and air," said one
u immunity member at the Oakland People's
Hearing on Dioxin, Health and Environmental
justice.
According to Janelle Ishida, a sophomore and
a SEAS cooi dinator, the meeting provided an
ofxMlunity for community members "to get to
geflier and share support for zero dioxin."
Nearly 130 people met in the Oakland City
Half to discuss the impact of waste disposal on the
community and how the problem could be solved.
I lie meeting fixused on the dangers present
wl by the chemical dioxin. Dioxin is a toxin that is
i vie ased into the atmosphere when chlorinated
|>la.stks are burned. These plastic s are commonly
lound in medical wastes prcxiuced at major hos
|nials. including Stanford Hospital.
Stanford Hospital uses Integrated Environ-

mental Systems/Norcal to dispose of its haz
ardous medical wastes. The waste from Stanford,
which comprises 15 percent of the total waste
processed at IKS, is incinerated, releasing small
amounts of dioxin into the air.
The meeting's organizers claim that dioxins
have l)t*en shown to contribute to cancer and de
velopmental defects and that exposure is particu
larly serious for young children and breast-feed
ing mothers.
A publication released by SEAS suites that IKS
lias incurred 7.'} environmental permit violations
since 1996. The student group argues that IKS
has not Ijeen held to appropriate standards, that
testing has been lax and that fines as a result of
these violations have amounted to "a slap on the
wrist" for the large company.
Speakers at the meeting included healthcare
workers, union inemlxrs, youth groups and «>-
munnity members. They addressed a nine-mem-
Ixr listening panel that included representatives
from many government organizations as well as
the office of (California Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
One woman said, "It is outrageous — people
are dying!" She then called for members of the lis
tening panel to "take a train ride, not a plane, and
see what's really happening in this country."
The students attending from SKAS also ad-

dressed the panel. Wearing re el costumes meant
to depict tlie red'bags used to transport medical
waste, they called for Stanford to pressure IKS to
change its practices or find another means of
waste disposal.
Paul Watkins, a Stanford f hospital administra
tor, urges caution in interpreting the findings pre
sented by SEAS.
When the hospital decided to use IKS several
years ago to dispose of medical waste, it "believed
it was an environmentally sound method of dis
posal," according to Watkins.
"Generally when we entei into an agreement
we investigate to ensure compliance with state and
federal codes."
Watkins said the hospital is "looking at how
we'll continue to manage [medical] waste" and will
explore "several different techniques."
Their options include processing the wastes in
ternally at the hospital, or continuing to contract
them out through a company like IKS. I lowever,
information regarding specifics is not yet available.
Hospital officials plan to release an official re
sponse to the clioxin concerns within the next
week.
According to Ishida, the meeting "went well —
the coalition [(California Zero Dioxin Kxposure Al
liance] did a really good job."
