### AMIT GARG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Mystery writer Walter Mosley spoke
alx>ut the universality of race issues and the
enslavement of capitalism to an audience of
about 75 people in Cubberly Auditorium,
yesterday night.
Mosley is a two-time finalist for the
NAACI' award in fiction and former presi
dent of the Mystery Writers of America.He
spoke about his latest — and first nonfiction
— work, entitled "Workin on the Chain (>ang:
Shaking Off the Dead Hand of History."
"My lxK)k, contrary to what the name ma\
say, is not about race," said Mosley.
"Most people say non-fiction is real and
fiction is unreal. I lx*lieve non-fiction is true
and fiction is a lie," he said. "The problem is
that many non-fiction writers select facts to
adapt to their own vision. I wanted to change
that."
He described how uncomfortable he felt
writing about something at which he was not
a specialist. But he emphasized that "I need
ed to raise my voice, even il 1 am not an ex
pert, to make a change."
Citing such maladies as "AIDS in Africa,"
"drugs in the streets," the "lies in nightly
news," Mosley urged the audience towards
social consciousness.
"Most of our problems are common," he

said. "You think you know them but you
don't. After much thought I have arrived at
this equation: mass oppression for mass pro
duction."
He explained he believed that in order to
achieve higher pr< >diu tivity, society oppress
es the individual more.
Mosley argued that the problems of
whites are no different from the blacks. Ac
cording to him, the root of these problems is
capitalism.
According to him, even when the institu
tion of slavery died, blacks remained under
"virtual slavery." Meanwhile whites, "who
don't know their history" continue to be re
pressed by the system. "But I am not a Marx
ist. I reject Marx's dictatorship of the prole
tariat as much as Plato's educated
elite... I he key to greatness is that our
moral actions equal our technological and
economic progress." Mosley also urged his
audience to break "the silence we have creat
ed around us."
"I thought he was great," said Sean Ran
dall, Bookstore Sales Manager. "I've read
many of his books and he was consistent
throughout."
"I fe was very ingenious," said sophomore
Malac hi Mc Kinney. "I le presented black his
tory very accurately. However, 1 was in
trigued by his saying that charity breeds
poverty."
