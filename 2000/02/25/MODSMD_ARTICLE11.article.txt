Housing and Dining Services prevented
Haus Mittleuropa from installing a satellite
dish last week and later removed an existing
one from Storey 112 louse in accordance with the
1999-2000 1 lousing Policies and Services docu
ment.
The house planned to install the IS" direct
broadcast dish on a tall concrete umbrella stand
with a pole inside. Resident Juan Bruce-Novoa,
a senior, said this setup would be "completely
removable" and would not physically harm the
house.
While installing the dish. Facilities Supervi
sor Lisa Thornton told the house's residents
that the dish was prohibited under the resi
dence agreement which states: "due to an
agreement with Stanford Communication Ser
vices, satellite dishes are not allowed."
The house purchased the dish as a cheaper
method of receiving (able television stations for
their common area. Currently, Communica
tions and Networking Services requires a house
to pay the $21 monthly rate for every student in
the house if it wishes to receive basic cable ser

vices in a common area.
The satellite dish would also enable the
house to receive additional Kuropean channels
that are not available under the Stanford cable
service. According to Bruce-Novoa, these chan
nels would be especially appropriate for Mit
tleuropa, the Kuropean theme house.
lu attempts to install die dish, the house told
Thornton that Storey 1 louse also had a satellite
dish, according to Bruce-Novoa. Thornton
said "no agreement [about the dish had been]
made with Storey and the satellite dish was re
moved."
Bruce-Novoa contended that Housing and
Dining Services' prohibition violated the F(lC's
Over-the-Air Reception Devices Rule, adopted
as part of'thc Telecommunications Act of 1996,
which "prohibits restrictions that impair the in
stallation, maintenance or use" of satellite dish
es. It applies to "private covenants" such as the
residence agreement and to rental property.
Assistant Director for Communication Ser
vices Maureen I riniin said the law does not
apply to University housing. "You have [these
lights] only if you're the homeowner or lease
holder," she said. The text of the regulation
says the law applies to people with a "direct or

indirect ownership interest" in the property.
According to Trimm, Communications and
Networking Services has several reasons for the
dish ban, including safety, aesthetic and finan
cial issues.
The safety issues stem from dangers inher
ent in self-installed dishes. Dishes installed by
residents can lead to hazardous wiring, Trimm
said. Residents installing dishes also have the
potential to harm housing by drilling holes in
walls, allowing water penetration.
Trimm said that the aesthetic issues arise
from the possibility of satellite dishes sticking
out of many dorm windows.
The financial issues come from the setup of
Communications and Networking Services.
When the University installed cable service, it
planned to recover its investment through a
certain level of student subscriptions, Trimm
said.
According to Trimm, allowing satellite dish
es would diminish the number of subscribers
and-could impair the University's ability to
keep rates low. The 71-channel basic cable ser
vice, which students receive at a lower rate of
$21/ month, costs $39/ month in Palo Alto, she
said.
