# Grad students receive less aid

### AMY L KOVAC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
According to University
Archivist Margaret Kimball, tuition
at Stanford until 1920 was free for
all students, undergraduates and
graduates alike. A lot has changed
since the founding days of the Uni
versit. Full-time tuition for the
1999-2000 academic year for un
dergraduates and most graduate
students is $23,058.
While the Financial .Aid Office
has a strong commitment to com
prehensive financial aid programs
to help undergraduates cover tu
ition costs, it does not have a similar
commitment to meet the financial
needs of all graduate students, ac
cording to Director of Student
Awards Cynthia Hartley.
"The University's commitment
is to fund doctoral students, but
master's students have to rely on
loans and other ways to pay for tu
ition," Hartley said. "It is difficult
for masters students and many of
these students must rely on outside
alternative methods."
Master's students can apply for
loans, including the Stafford and
Perkins loans, but even a combina
tion of those loan programs would
not cover total cost.
While the FAO does work with
graduate students, most graduate
financial aid concerns are dealt with
in the department in which the
graduate student is enrolled. All de
partments on campus give some
kind of aid to doctoral students, in
cluding paying for tuition and pro
viding for a living stipend, but most

do not offer any type of aid to mas
ter's students.
In the Department of Biological
Sciences, doctoral students [aire
guaranteed to receive a stipend, as
well as having their tuition paid,
through spring quarter of tlieir
fourth year, according to the de
partment's Student Services Man
ager Rania Hegazi.
However, the situation with
master's students is entirely differ
ent.
"Master's students do not re
ceive any financial aid at all from
the department, but they can be
employed by professors as TAs,"
said Andy Hernandez, the depart
ment's student services specialist.
"A lot of master's students are
forced to take out loans. We make it
very clear to them [when they, are
applying], and they usually don't
apply unless than can afford it or
are willing to take out loans."
This is also true in the Depart
ments of Psychology and Chem
istry, where the departments pay
tuition for nine units per quarter
and offer a living stipend for'their
doctoral students. These depart
ments have primarily cotermioal
master's students, and there is no
departmental financial aid for these
students.
The Religious Studies Depart
ment is similar to the Psychology
and Chemistry Departments.. â€¢
"There is no money availabje for
master's students [in the depart
ment] and we usually send them to
the FAO if they need help," said
