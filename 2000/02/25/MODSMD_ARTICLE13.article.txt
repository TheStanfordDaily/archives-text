## President urges trade with China 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi
■ dent Clinton said yesterday a
- trade deal with China is a "once
in-a-generation" opportunity that
should not be rejected because of
Beijing's human rights problems,
global arms sales or threats
against Taiwan.
• . The deal is vital for America's
economic and national security
interests, Clinton said, and it
• would be "a devastating setback"
il Congress killed the accord.
. \ !The president spoke about
• China in an economic speech in
Philadelphia and earlier in Wash
ington before the Business Coun
cil,'a gathering of corporate lead
•ers-eager to win access to China's
market, the largest in the world.
• 1 • He urged the business chiefs to
help him persuade Congress to
give China permanent trade ben
efits in return for its pledge to
open its doors to American goods.
The U.S.-China deal is a key
ingredient in China's campaign to
•win admission to the World
Trade Organization, a 135-nation
• organization which sets the rules
lor global trade.
• -.Congressional critics say the
•United States should not reward
China with trade benefits as long
as'it abuses human rights, intimi
dates Taiwan and sells weapons to
other countries.
"China still does things that we
don't agree with," Clinton
acknowledged. "We can't control
what China does, and I'm not
going to stand here and tell you
that they're going to turn out as
we would hope.
"But I'll tell yOu this, we can
control what we do," the presi

dent said. "If we do this, 20 years
from now we'll look back and
wonder why we ever even debat
ed it. If we don't, 20 years from
now we'll still be kit king ourselves
in the seat of the pants for turning
away from an enormous opportu
nity to give our children a safer
world."

Clinton said that China's will
ingness to open its markets is "the
kind of opportunity that comes
along once in a generation."
Already facing formidable
opposition, the deal ran into
more trouble this week with
China's escalation ol threats
against Taiwan.
