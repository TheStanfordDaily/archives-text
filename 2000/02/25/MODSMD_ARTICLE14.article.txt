### 
HUNTSVILLK, Texas (AP) — A 62-year-old
woman was executed In injection yesterday alter
Gov. George \V. Bush rejected her claim that she
killed her fifth husband in sell-defense and deserved
a reprieve.
Betty Lou Beets became the fourth woman to be
executed iu the United States since the Supreme
Court in 1970 allowed the death penalty to resume.
She was the second woman executed in Texas since
the Cavil War.
She gave no final statement as she lav strapped to
the death chamber gurney. She made no eye contact
with the victim's family, but smiled at relatives watch
ing through a window at her side. She continued
smiling as she slipped into unconsciousness.
Death penalty opponents and domestic violence
organizations had urged Bush to grant Beets a l M)-
clay delay, arguing it would be consistent with his
description of himself as a "compassionate conserva
tive" in his presidential campaign. The delay was
Bush's only option, since the state parole board did
not recommend that bet sentence be commuted to
life iu prison.
During his 5 1/2 years as governor, 120 convicted
killers have been executed in I'exas. He lias spared
one condemned inmate.
"After careful review of the evidence of the case, I
concur with the jury that Bettv Lou Beets is guilty of
this murder," Bush said in a written statement after
returning to Texas from California, where he was
campaigning lor the Republican nomination.
"I'm confident that the courts, both state and fed
eral, have thoroughly reviewed all the issues raised
by the defendant."
Beets and her lawyers insisted the Ibrmer bar
tender-waitress, convicted of fatally shooting fifth
husband Jimmy Don Beets nearly 17 y ears ago and
burying his body under a flower garden, was the vic
tim of years of domestic abuse and should be allowed
to live.
Yesterday, the sth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in New Orleans rejected an appeal that accused the
state of not following its own rules in reviewing
Beets' case.
I he arguments were dismissed Wednesday In a
federal judge iu Austin as a delay tactic .
Beets' lawyers also took the matter to the L'.S.
Supreme Court, which rejected it without comment.
According to the governor's ollice, Bush had
received 2,108 phone calls and letters opposing

Beets' execution by yesterday afternoon, and 57 calls
and letters favoring it.
"A decision to stay the execution of Ms. Beets
would demonstrate your compassionate conser
vatism and that you are willing to do what is right
even in the face of potential criticism from your con
stituents," the Rev. Jesse Jackson wrote to Bush.
Steven 112 fawkins, executive director of the Nation
al Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty implored to
Bush grant a reprieve "so evidence of her being bat
tered ... may be fully evaluated.
"Far from receiving careful consideration, the
role of domestic abuse in Betty's crime has been con
tinually swept under the rug by the Texas court sys
tem," I fawkins said.
Before Beets, the last woman executed in Texas
was karla Faye Fucker, on Feb. 3, 1998. Fucker
hacked two people to death with a pickax but said
she had a religious conversion in prison and
appealed for mercy. Bush was critic ized for mocking
Fucker in a magazine interview last year.
Beets was the ninth convic ted killer and the sec
ond in as many days to be executed in Texas, the
nation's most active death penalty state.
She spent yesterday morning meeting with rela
tives. She declined to request a final meal.
Although Beets insisted she was innocent, a jury
convicted her of killing )immy Don Beets, a Dallas
Fire Department captain, to collect his life insurance
and pension.
Her claims of domestic abuse surfaced only
recently and were not a factor in her 1985 trial,
although one of her daughters, Faye Lane, in a tear
ful plea for her mother's life, said this week her
mother was acting in self-defense alter vears of
abuse.
"I know that if the jury heard the truth about my
momma, she only could have done something like
this if she'd been very scared or threatened," Lane
said.
James Beets, the murder victim's son, discounted
claims of abuse, saying she told 112 riends her husband
of 1 1 months had been the best thing to happen to
her.
"Why is she saying what she is saving about my
daddy?" James Beets said.
Betty Lou Beets also was convicted of shooting
and wounding her second husband, Bill Lane, and
was charged but never tried in the 1981 shooting
death ol her fourth husband, Doyle Barker.
