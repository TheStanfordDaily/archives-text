# U.N. forces will monitor cease-fire implementation in Congo
## 
### 
UNITED NA TIONS (AP) — Half a
year after six nations and three rebel
groups signed a cease-fire on the Congo,
the U.N. Security Council yesterday
authorized a 5,500-strong observer Ibrce
to monitor its implementation and lay the
groundwork for possible deployment of a
peacekeeping force.
. The former combatants are already
pressing for the United Nations to send
peacekeepers, but the Security Council
first wants the opposing sides to honor
the cease-fire.
- -The 15-member council unanimously

agreed to the U.S.-drafted resolution to
send 500 military observers, supported b\
5,037 security troops and logistic s person
nel. The group will verify that all parties
are observing last summer's cease-fire
aimed at ending a I 1/2-year war in
Congo that has destabilized central Africa.
U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke
has said the United States will not provide
troops but may provide logistical support.
Many council members recognize that
sending such a small mission to a country
a quarter the size of the United States
with few roads and poor communications

'may not be militarily effective but can be
politically important.
"The Security Counc il has taken a crit
ical step to help the Congo come to a
peace that its people so desperately
need," said Holbrooke, who devoted his
presidency of the council last month to
African issues. "The time has now arrived
to act."
T he Congo observer mission, expected
to cost around $500 million for the first
12 months, is the fourth major U.N.
peacekeeping operation approved by the
Security Council in eight months. It had

already agreed to send 4,800 civilian
police to Kosovo, 1 1,100 peacekeepers to
Sierra Leone, and 10,800 peacekeepers
and civilian police to Fast Timor.
The war in Congo has been called
Africa's first world war.
Russia's U.N. ambassador, Sergey
Lavrov, yesterdav described it as "the
largest conflict in modern Africa." It has
not ended despite the cease-fire agree
ment — a point reiterated In speaker
after speaker.
Congo is backed l>\ Angola, Zimbabwe
and Namibia. The rebels who took up

arms to oust President Laurent Kabila
Irom power in August 1998 are support
ed by Rwanda and Uganda.
In Kinshasa, Congolese Foreign
Affairs Minister Alxloulaye Yerodia com
plained that the resolution didn't spec ifi
cally name the "aggressors" and demand
their withdrawal. 1 "he resolution mereh
calls lor the withdrawal of "all loreign
forces."
As recently as Wednesday, at a one-da)
summit in Lusaka, Zambia, the ke\ play
ers renewed their commitment to imple
ment the cease-fire quickly.
