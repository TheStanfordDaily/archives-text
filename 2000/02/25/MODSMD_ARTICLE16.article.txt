PLAIN FIFLD, Ind. (AP) â€” Leaders of
two orthodox Muslim groups long at odds
with Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam
are expected to attend Farrakhan's annual
gathering this weekend, raising tlie
prospect that the religion's fractured U.S.
followers may eventually unite.
* -Mainstream Islamic leaders from
other nations also planned to attend the
Nation of Islam Saviour's Day events in
Chicago and will look for signs that Far
rakhan's group is embracing orthodox
Islamic beliefs, a leader of the key immi
grant Muslim group in this country said
yesterday.
"They want to watch this transforma
tion," said Sayyid Syeed, secretary general
of the Islamic Society of North America.
"They will be disappointed if that transfor
mation does not take place. 'I'here should
at least be some commitment in that direc -
tion."
Meanwhile, Farrakhan and W. Deen
Mohammed, the son of Elijah Muham
mad and head of the black and orthodox
Muslim American Society, have scheduled
a joint news conference today. The Islam
ic Society and other mainstream Muslims
recognize Mohammed's group as ortho
dox.
Farrakhan and other Nation of Islam

leaders did not return calls seeking com
ment. Messages left with the Muslim
American Society, based in suburban
Chicago, also were not returned.
However, an article posted Feb. 1(> on
the Nation of Islam's Web site quoted Ish
mael Muhammad, an assistant to Far
rakhan, as saying a "mega-highlight" of
the Saviour's Day weekend would be the
unification of the Nation of Islam with fol
lowers of W. Deen Muhammad.
Syeed acknowledged the Nation of
Islam would need time, perhaps years, to
completely move away from founder
Muhammad's original doctrines, includ
ing a belief that whites are "devils."
1 lowever, he said moves in recent years
to observe today's prayers and to fast (lin -
ing the holy month of Ramadan had left
him encouraged the Nation of Islam
would fully embrace orthodoxy within
four or five years.
"We have noticed a desire on his part to
introduce his followers to mainstream
Islam. We understand that these things
cannot happen overnight," Syeed said in
an interview Wednesday at the Islamic
Society's headquarters in Plainfielcl, near
Indianapolis.
Syeed said he will speak tomorrow on
fundamental principles of Islam and the

need lor the Nation of Islam to join a uni
versal Islamic alliance in the United States.
His society says it represents some 4
million Muslims in the United States, most
of them immigrants from Muslim conn
tries.
"Islam is a universal religion, lor all
races, all colors, all groups. We need to
unite under one (lod, under one prophet
and one universal brotherhood," Syeed
said.
Orthodox leaders are eager lor Far
rakhan's group to embrace conventional
belief as last-growing Islam seeks to join
the American mainstream.
Syeed said normalization would bolster
the image ol the religion, which many
Americans associate chiefly with terrorist
acts In Muslim activists abroad.
Anti-white and anti-Semitic statements
from Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam
did nothing to help that public relations
problem, Syeed said.
"Demonization has been our major
challenge in America.' said Syeed, who
directs the day-to-day activities of the
Islamic Society, an umbrella organization
of 500 Islamic groups.
Islam rejects the race theology that Far
rakhan has pteached in the past.
Farrakhan, (>(>, has battled prostate c an

cer and said last December that a "near
death experience" earlier in the year had
left him a changed man. Since then, he has
stressed unit\ for all races and religions.

11 it* Nation of Islam has held its own
interpretation of the Muslim treed,
"There is no god hut Clod and
Mohammed is his prophet."
