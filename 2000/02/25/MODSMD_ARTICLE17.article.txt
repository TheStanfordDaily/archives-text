## The 						Stanford Daily Freshman Book program needs restructuring 
### 
Alter loin Stoppard's January lecture
to liitixxliiction to the Humanities
students as part of I-llum's Fresh
man Hook program, some legitimate
questions arose about the value and efficacy ol
the program. Despite the validity of these con
cerns, the Freshman hook program, like all
new endeavors, must experience some growing
pains before it can be properly evaluated.
Now in its second year, the Freshman Book
program aims to bring one high-profile author
to speak to I-I lum students each year. Ihe pro
gram gives students the authors hook and
encourages, but does not require, them to read
it.
I lie program seeks to oiler students the
opportunitv to experience a piece ol literature
at their leisure and outside a strictly academic
arena. As admirable as this core notion ma\ be,
some matters of choice and approach must be
addressed before the program itself Can suc
ceed.

I irst, there is the issue of choosing the cor
rect book. Because of the wide range of stu
dents in 1-1 luni, the 112 reshman Book must have
a broad enough appeal to reach students in and
outside of the humanities.
I he first Freshman Book, Charles Johnson s
"Middle Passage," enjoyed a good deal of suc
cess in the program because both the language
and the story itself were accessible enough to
reach a large audience.
Because a piece like "Arcadia" requires a cer
tain degree of background and familiarity with
I x>tli the humanities and the play's subject mat
ter, one might expect that students would have
more difficulty relating to and, subsequently,
enjoying the piece. Accessibility, then, becomes
one of the most central concerns in choosing a
successful Freslunan Book.
Secondly, all the 1-Huin courses must
approach the Freshman Book program uni
formly. Although the program's basic concept,
which involves avoiding routine, some unifor

mity must be instituted to ensure the success of
the program.
One way of accomplishing this goal rests with
scheduling. Students should receive the hook
toward the end of fall quarter but before
Thanksgiving and winter breaks so that they
have a wide enough window within which to
read it. This should be followed up by an
optional lecture and /or section given by I-
Huni classes so that students, having read the
book, can begin to think about il in some depth.
The author should not appear to give the
actual lecture until the spring so that students
have time to develop enough perspective on
the piece to enjoy the lecture. Yet, more impor
tant is that by maintaining the Freshman Book
program as a year-long process, the program
sustains students' interest in the book, its author
and lilt' program itself.
The final ingredient for keeping the Fresh
man Book Program new and engaging is pub
licity. Although reasonable efforts at publicity

for the program have been made in the past,
there must be more. The success or failure of
the Freshman Book program each year not
only determines the program's own ultimate
fate, but it also greatly affects the way that this
campus views the I-Hum program itself.
Thus, greater efforts at publicity must be
made now, in the formative years, so that Stan
ford stops thinking of the Freshman Book pro
gram, and I-Hum itself, as a "new" and some
what separate entity rather than an established
part of Stanford's curriculum.
The relative "newness" of I-Hum and, con
sequently, many I-Hum-based programs like
the Freshman Book program, necessitates a
good deal of adjustment, which will always
include some setbacks. But that hardly means
that they will not be successful in the long run.
Much value exists in the Freshman Book pro
gram as is, and it is certainly worth keeping, but
its ultimate success will depend on how much
effort is put into firmly establishing it now.
