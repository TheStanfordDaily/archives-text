It's simple.
It's called image.
IVing successful is a 'J I hour-a-clav,
intensive process ol making sure you
look like you're successful and more
importantly, that everyone around you
notices von are successful.
I low do son get tln- image? Well,
here are a few of the little things I've
noticed that those "spec ial" Stanford stu
dents, destined lor success do on dailx
basis that . . . well . . . set them apart
from the rest of us. l or all von freshmen
and sophomores out there, listen care
fully because the\ won't teach you this in
the I luinan liiologv core.
first and foremost: Communication.
()w n a cellular phone. I ,o\ e your cellular
phone. Realize that vou are worthless
without voiir cellular phone. You might
still get b\ without a I'almPilot, but these
d-avs. c ellulai phones are as important to
\om sue cess as I )ebbie (iibson was to the
l!)8()s.
But just having a cell phone is not
(iiougli. I lie key is to leave the cell
phone turned on at ALL times (in class.

Bender Room ol'Creen Library). When
\onr cell phone plays the William I ell
Overture in the middle ol Leon I with
|olm laylor pontificating about that
same, stupid Supply & Demand curve,
\ou will be making a statement to every
one in the room that vou are one of the
elite.
In fact, you would be so cool that

glance your way and recognize the care
vou exhibit loi your "clients" by leaving
voi u (ell phone constant Iv turned on, as
well as your style since the choice ol

One small maneuver and both the pro
lessor .md the (>OO students in Leon I are
guaranteed to stare .it vou in adoration
as a campus power plaver, an individual
willing to inlen upi lec lure lor a conver
sation ol obvious importance.
Second, the Look. I lie true Stanford
sue c ess is a master ol costume. But We're
talking more than one clay career fair
pinstripes and perms. The Business suit
is an essential daily■ item. But just like cell
phones, cvervboch owns a business suit.
I he kev here is timing. If you have an
interview on Thursday, the world needs
to know starting at breakfast that morn
ing all the wa\ through to dinner that
night. Stanford dining halls are your
opportunity to stand out, to tell the
world that vou are upper level manage
ment material with your power outfit,

failed.
I'bird, the Connections. It's not who
you are, it's who you know and what
they think of you that counts. Sitting in
the front row may get you better grades,
but it won't get you anything I'rotn your
professors except a better view of their
sweaty armpits. Learn the art of point
less post-c lass conversation as well as the
art of going to office hours without any
questions. I alk to your professor con

•Fourth, the Career Fair. Everything
that was said about connections also
applies in this arena. Ignore the sounds
and smells of a meat market. It's just
your mind thinking about . . . iinim . . .

dinner. Think of the c areer fair as a flow
er market. And you're just there to buy
flowers. And all those big unfeeling and
uncaring corporations with computer
companies on either side, are just . . .well
. . . florists. Remember, you're not selling
out to them. You really WANT to be a
consultant. It really isn't just for the
money. Really. |ust keep telling yourself
that. And you'll leave the career fair with
a bouquet that smells of money and
opportunity.

Yes, 1 learned very quickly that I do not
have what it takes to play the game (that's
why I've chosen to become an Engineering
grad student. If you have friends co
terming in Engineering, that's the real rea
son why). It really is amusing to see how
for four years, we are essentially trained at
Stanford to become consultants.
So, what's the point of this column? It's
for seniors really. And it goes a little some
thing like this. When vou play the "hiring"
game, remember it has the potential to

make you really annoying. Don't let it.
You've worked hard (or hardly worked if
you're a Comm major), and you're gradu
ating from Stanford. You'll do line. And
finally, please, please, please, turn your cell
phones off in class. If you haven't realized,
vou look foolish, not cool.
