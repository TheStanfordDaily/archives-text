## 
### CHRIS DRAKE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
University administrators and representa
tives from Stanford .Alter Midnight participants
met on Wednesday afternoon to review the
program's popularity. The program extends
the business hours of several vendors and ser
vices on campus.
Participating organizations and vendors,
who have maintained late hours since January,
may decide to adjust their hours based on the
numbers of students who are making use of the
program. Their decisions will be announced
next Tuesday afternoon.
"Thestudent, body has spoken, and Stanford
After Midnight has been a great success," said
ASSU President Mike Levin, a junior. "The
core of the program, including athletic facili
ties, common areas, places to eat and libraries,
will remain part of Stanford After Midnight for
next quarter and, hopefully, main years to
come."
Levin attended Wednesday's meeting and
confirmed the participants' positive attitude
about the program, noting that most facilities
are expected to maintain their late hours.
"We have had a tremendous showing of sup
port from many of the participating vendors, as
well as many in the University," he said.
"Tresidder Fitness will remain open till 2 a.m.,
seven nights a week, till at least the end of the

year," Levin added.
The ASSU is also "looking forward to Meyer
Library being open 24 hours a day, seven days
a week, for students," he said.
Vendors agree that business is running
smoothly after midnight.
"[We get] pretty good business after mid
night, better than before," said Treehouse
Manager Saul Alvarez, who also worked at the
restaurant when it was known as Polio Rey.
Coffee House manager Melody Lambelet
said that the cafe is busy shortly after midnight,
but that business dwindles thereafter.
"After I a.m., things die off. Just a few people
come in and hang out," she said. "Personally, I
would close it at 1. I'm looking at it from a busi
ness point of view, and [revenue during I a.m.]
is not enough to justify staying open."
Lambelet said that the old Coffee 1 louse was
open until 1 a.m. during the week and until
midnight on Friday and Saturday. She said that
extending business hours has not been as bene
ficial as she hoped.
Nevertheless, she said, "1 realh enjoy the
Stanford students. I hope they're getting a bet
ter feeling about the Co I io."
While some Stanford After Midnight partic
ipants have been enjoying throngs of students
after midnight, according to Levin, others have
not had such extensive usage.
"DeGuerre (racquetball courts) isn't being
used as much [after midnight]," Levin said,

adding that the Ford Center might c ut back its
Friday and Saturday hours for the same reason.
"I encourage all students to go to the basketball
courts on Fridays and Saturdays if they want it
to stay open," he said.
Jamba Juice might sign on as Stanford After
Midnight's newest participant.
"We talked to Jamba Juice, and they're hesi
tant to join Stanford After Midnight because
the) don't feel that the smoothie business is con
ducive to staying open late at night," Levin said.
Even so, "they've expressed an interest in possi
bly extending their hours," he said.
Dora Martinez, a three-year Jamba Juice
employee, noted that the Tresidder Jamba
Juice initially stayed open until II p.m.
"I think [extending Jamba Juice's hours J is a
good idea," she said. "I wouldn't mind if Jamba
Juice were open [till midnight]," said junior
Nick Judge,while waiting for a smoothie.
Levin said the ASSLJ will host two events in
early March to promote Stanford Alter Mid
night. ()n March 4, before the men's basketball
team takes on I CIA at Maples Pavilion, the
ASS I will distribute free pi/./a to fans waiting in
line.
On March 9, the ASSI will host a party at
1 residder similar to the one it held at the Cof
fee House and I reehouse earlier this year,
both events will be part of an early celebration
of the NCAA tournament also known as "March
Madness."
