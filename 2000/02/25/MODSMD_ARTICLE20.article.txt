Article needs more balance
I would like to congratulate contribut
ing writer ('.aiti in McKiernan on her
ellbrt in introducing the lilt- story of a
Kurdish cafe owner in "Local man over
comes history of hardship" (Feb. 2.5).
However, the piece lacks the main jour
nalistic qualities of impartiality and objec
tivity, and it is even misleading for the
majority of readers who do not know
much about I in key.
I was appalled by the use of place
names like- "I laag" or "Dersim": the first,
I have never heard, the second is sup
posed to be a province of Kurdistan. The
important point is that no such adminis
trative regions exist in Turkey, which
makes the piece political up front.
The piece is a totally one sided story. It
presents the hardships that Mr. I gar has
gone through ;is only caused by his eth
nicity. I have to remind readers of 1 he
Daily that life in Turkey has never been
easy for the great majority <>l people —
regardless of ethnicity. \\'e have had a
history of economic difficulties and politi
cal turmoil, and those have not targeted

any ethnic group in particular.
An impartial article would give some
empirical facts about what percentage of
the rural areas of Turkey had electricity
and schools in the 19505. It is worth
reminding that it is not only Kurds who
emigrated to urban areas to work or
study or who went to Germany as guest
workers in the 19605.
Military forces have had a strong pres
ence all over the country; the concentra
tion in eastern Turkey was and still is due
to the rampant terrorism in the region.
A few more, facts to correct the mis
leading presentations: The comment
about how the dam built in 1990 left the
village under water sounds like it was
intentional. That dam was a part of a
grand irrigation project aimed at enhanc
ing irrigated agriculture in the southeast
and thus at elevating the economic
prospects of the inhabitants.
In addition, every male Turkish citizen
has to serve in the military for IK months,
and it is not a particularistic policy.
In sum, 1 would agree with the quote
from Mr. Ugar saying that the conflicts in
the region have been bad for Turks and

Kurds alike, especially if the wasted funds
are considered. However, the conflict
can only be solved with "mutual" under
standing, and I don't think the portrayal;
in your paper contributes to that process. •
I would urge you to be more careful
about the implicit claims and objectivity!
of what you publish. '
