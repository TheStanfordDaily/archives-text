# Med Center waste disposal raises concerns about dioxin
## 
### SHALINI BHARGAVA EDITORIAL BOARD 
At the People's Hearing on Dioxin,
Health and Environmental Justice in Oak
land last night, community members
affected by toxic pollution spoke out
against their slow poisoning by dioxin, a
carcinogen emitted by waste incinerators.

DAILY OP-ED

Dioxin has become the focus of envi
ronmental justice debates in the area in
part because the chemical accumulates in
body fat, meaning that once exposed,
there is no way to purge dioxin from the
body. Dioxin is also suspected to stunt
brain development, which leads to learn
ing disabilities. Babies who accumulate
diOxin early on through their mother's

breast milk sutler these disadvantages
before they even know how to talk.
Ironically, these environmental threats
to health are fueled locally by the inciner
ation of medical waste from Stanford
1 lospital. The Hospital currently sends its
medical waste to East Oakland, where a
company by the name of Integrated Envi
ronmental Systems rims one of the few
remaining incinerators in California.
Most incinerators in the state have shut
down due to health concerns and the
availability of cleaner alternatives, such as
steam sterilization, and microwaving.
Although the Hospital is one of sever
al IKS customers, its waste constitutes
about 15 pei tent of the waste incinerated
at the site. Just because lES has already
invested in capital machinery for an
incinerator does not justify the company's
continued use of an outdated, often

unsale disposal system. At some point,
such investments must be seen in light of
the health threats to local residents. Safer
alternatives exist. Autoclaving, or steam
sterilization of medical waste, produces
no dioxin.
The problem of where to locate plants
and what sterilization methods to use
may seem complicated. Does environ
mental justice require that these plants
move to high-income, white communities
like Palo Alto Where else are they sup
posed to go? These questions, while
important, mask the more structural
problems that create inequality and con
tribute to bad health. Environmental jus
tice is a movement that, among other
things, calls attention to these structural
causes — the political, economic and
social dimensions of environmental
threats to health and well-being.

According to a flyer handed out by
Students for Environmental Action at
Stanford at a rally on Tuesday, 53 out of
54 toxic waste disposal sites in California
are located in low-income communities of
color. Some may say that dumping in
poor communities is an unfortunate but
necessary result of market economics; il
certain neighborhoods, for whatever rea
son, offer cheaper land, and the local
community is regarded as politically pow
erless, waste disposal companies will flock
to set up shop there.
Some also contend that it is only "unin
tentionally" that communities of color bear
the greatest environmental burdens and
that this makes the situation less intolera
ble. However, if particular populations
"happen" to always be the ones to suffer
from exposure to carcinogens, how can we
overlook it simply because no one indivicl-

ual "meant" for this to happen? Faced with
such a high correlation between race and
the location of waste disposal sites, we
should look lor explanations. What is it
about the workings ol our economy and
political system that create environmental
racism? How can they be changed?
The U.S. has a great rhetorical commit
ment to freedom. In a country where the
political culture is fixated on lights and lib
erties, it is ridiculous that obvious con
straints on freedom, such as debilitating
illnesses caused by economic, political and
social institutions, should go ignored and
even encouraged. Because problems of
environmental injustice are structural, no
solution will seem entirely acceptable to
everyone. The first step in this particular
case is for Stanford Hospital to pursue
cleaner alternatives and cut down on waste
where possible.
