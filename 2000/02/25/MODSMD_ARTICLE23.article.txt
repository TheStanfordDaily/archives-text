## Cardinal breezes by WSU No. 1 Stanford rolls to 37-point stomping of the 0-14 Cougars at Pullman 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
PULLMAN, Wash — When
it's cold outside, and the oil's a lit
tle low, it sometimes takes a while
for the car to get started.
But when the tar is a 2000
Stanford, rated No. 1 in its class
by the Associated Press, it doesn't
take too long for it to start run
ning on all cylinders.
After a tiring start to its two
game swing through the chilly
state of Washington— because of
a plane delay, the team didn't get
into its hotel until close to three
in the morning Thursday — the
top-ranked Cardinal looked
lethargic in the opening mo
ments against Washington State
last night.
But paced by senior Mark
Madsen's fiery play and Casey
Jacobsen's hot shooting, Stan
ford revved up and ran down the
Cougars 89-52.
The win was the 11th straight
for the Cardinal (23-1, 12-1 Pa
cific 10 Conference) and the 14th
straight defeat for Washington
State (5-18, 0-14), which has not
won in more than two months.
"The crowd was a little flat and
we had a tough time getting
here," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "But we
didn't want to make any excuses."
A strong opening to the sec
ond half meant the Cardinal
could walk out of the Palouse ex
cuse-free. But for a few minutes,
it appeared that Stanford might
have reason to worry. Only Mad
sen, who scored Stanford's first
eight points, seemed to be play
ing with any intensity.
But finally, on the back of Ja
cobsen's four three-pointers, a
couple of which came from NBA
range, Stanford went on a 31-14
run to end any threat from an al
ready depleted and downtrod
den Cougar team.
"I don't have much to com
plain about," Montgomery said.
"But in the first half, we were a
bit sloppy. We were up 1 7 going
into halftime, but we didn't feel
good."
The second half must have
cheered Montgomery up. Stan
ford hit 14 of its first 15 shots to
blow the game open. The Cardi
nal went on a blistering 32-8 run
as Jacobsen, Madsen and senior
guard David Moseley all had the
hot hand.
