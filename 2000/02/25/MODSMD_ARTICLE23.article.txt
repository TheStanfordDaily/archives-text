## Cardinal breezes by WSU No. 1 Stanford rolls to 37-point stomping of the 0-14 Cougars at Pullman 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
PULLMAN, Wash — When
it's cold outside, and the oil's a lit
tle low, it sometimes takes a while
for the car to get started.
But when the tar is a 2000
Stanford, rated No. 1 in its class
by the Associated Press, it doesn't
take too long for it to start run
ning on all cylinders.
After a tiring start to its two
game swing through the chilly
state of Washington— because of
a plane delay, the team didn't get
into its hotel until close to three
in the morning Thursday — the
top-ranked Cardinal looked
lethargic in the opening mo
ments against Washington State
last night.
But paced by senior Mark
Madsen's fiery play and Casey
Jacobsen's hot shooting, Stan
ford revved up and ran down the
Cougars 89-52.
The win was the 11th straight
for the Cardinal (23-1, 12-1 Pa
cific 10 Conference) and the 14th
straight defeat for Washington
State (5-18, 0-14), which has not
won in more than two months.
"The crowd was a little flat and
we had a tough time getting
here," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "But we
didn't want to make any excuses."
A strong opening to the sec
ond half meant the Cardinal
could walk out of the Palouse ex
cuse-free. But for a few minutes,
it appeared that Stanford might
have reason to worry. Only Mad
sen, who scored Stanford's first
eight points, seemed to be play
ing with any intensity.
But finally, on the back of Ja
cobsen's four three-pointers, a
couple of which came from NBA
range, Stanford went on a 31-14
run to end any threat from an al
ready depleted and downtrod
den Cougar team.
"I don't have much to com
plain about," Montgomery said.
"But in the first half, we were a
bit sloppy. We were up 1 7 going
into halftime, but we didn't feel
good."
The second half must have
cheered Montgomery up. Stan
ford hit 14 of its first 15 shots to
blow the game open. The Cardi
nal went on a blistering 32-8 run
as Jacobsen, Madsen and senior
guard David Moseley all had the
hot hand.
Jacobsen, who finished with 23
points, hit another three three
pointers, leaving him one short of
a school record eight in a game.
"We played a little better in
the second half," Montgomery
said before looking at the box
score. "Well, we shot 82 percent
in the half, so I guess we played a
lot better."
Madsen, who ended the con
test with 20 points and nine re
bounds, said the team wanted to
pick up its level of play to end the
contest.
"We came out very focused,"
he said. "We just wanted to put
some distance between us and
them."
Jacobsen, who was 8-for-ll
shooting on the night, put much
of the distance between the two
teams, killing the Cougars with
his shooting and his confidence.
"For the first time this season, I
knew my shots were going in be
fore 1 even shot them," he said. "I
was so confident. I picked the ball
up ready, my mechanics were
perfect, I knew it was going in."
Jacobsen actually missed his
first two threes, before hitting the
last seven consecutively.
"The first miss, 1 thought that
was in,"he said afterward, look-

ing somewhat annoyed. "The sec -
ond, I double-pumped, I wish 1
could get that shot hack."
Stanford not only shot more
than 80 percent overall in the sec
ond half, it shot 78 percent from
beyond the arc. The team com
bined to set a Friel Court record
with 13 threes.
In fact, the Cardinal almost
shot better from behind the
three-point line than from be
hind the free-throw line, hitting
54 percent of its threes for the
game and only 5b percent of its
foul shots.
"1 thought our free-throw
shooting was a good indicator
that we were tired," Montgomery
said. "We hit 7 of 15 in the first
half, we were walking on some
fast breaks, we just weren't play
ing that hard."
But Montgomery said Madsen
was the one player who really got
Stanford out of the doldrums.
"Madsen just comes to play
every night. He really kept us in
early when we weren't tuned in to
it. Then Casey started shooting
the ball and we were all right."
Washington State might have
kept the game somewhat interest
ing, but the loss of senior guard
Jan-Michael Thomas to injury was
too much. Thomas, the Cougars'
third-leading scorer, injured his
knee in practice Tuesday and is out
for the season. Walk-on Cedric
Clark started in his place.

didn't want to make any excuses."
A strong opening to the sec
ond half meant the Cardinal
could walk out of the Palouse ex
cuse-free. But for a few minutes,
it appeared that Stanford might
have reason to worry. Only Mad
sen, who scored Stanford's first
eight points, seemed to be play
ing with any intensity.
But finally, on the back of Ja
cobsen's four three-pointers, a
couple of which came from NBA
range, Stanford went on a 31-14
run to end any threat from an al
ready depleted and downtrod
den Cougar team.
"I don't have much to com
plain about," Montgomery said.
"But in the first half, we were a
bit sloppy. We were up 1 7 going
into halftime, but we didn't feel
good."
The second half must have
cheered Montgomery up. Stan
ford hit 14 of its first 15 shots to
blow the game open. The Cardi
nal went on a blistering 32-8 run
as Jacobsen, Madsen and senior
guard David Moseley all had the
hot hand.
Jacobsen, who finished with 23
points, hit another three three
pointers, leaving him one short of
a school record eight in a game.
"We played a little better in
the second half," Montgomery
said before looking at the box
score. "Well, we shot 82 percent
in the half, so I guess we played a
lot better."
Madsen, who ended the con
test with 20 points and nine re
bounds, said the team wanted to
pick up its level of play to end the
contest.
"We came out very focused,"
he said. "We just wanted to put
some distance between us and
them."
Jacobsen, who was 8-for-ll
shooting on the night, put much
of the distance between the two
teams, killing the Cougars with
his shooting and his confidence.
"For the first time this season, I
knew my shots were going in be
fore 1 even shot them," he said. "I
was so confident. I picked the ball
up ready, my mechanics were
perfect, I knew it was going in."
Jacobsen actually missed his
first two threes, before hitting the
last seven consecutively.
"The first miss, 1 thought that
was in,"he said afterward, look-

ing somewhat annoyed. "The sec -
ond, I double-pumped, I wish 1
could get that shot hack."
Stanford not only shot more
than 80 percent overall in the sec
ond half, it shot 78 percent from
beyond the arc. The team com
bined to set a Friel Court record
with 13 threes.
In fact, the Cardinal almost
shot better from behind the
three-point line than from be
hind the free-throw line, hitting
54 percent of its threes for the
game and only 5b percent of its
foul shots.
"1 thought our free-throw
shooting was a good indicator
that we were tired," Montgomery
said. "We hit 7 of 15 in the first
half, we were walking on some
fast breaks, we just weren't play
ing that hard."
But Montgomery said Madsen
was the one player who really got
Stanford out of the doldrums.
"Madsen just comes to play
every night. He really kept us in
early when we weren't tuned in to
it. Then Casey started shooting
the ball and we were all right."
Washington State might have
kept the game somewhat interest
ing, but the loss of senior guard
Jan-Michael Thomas to injury was
too much. Thomas, the Cougars'
third-leading scorer, injured his
knee in practice Tuesday and is out
for the season. Walk-on Cedric
Clark started in his place.
