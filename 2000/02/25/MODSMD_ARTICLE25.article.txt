# Women's hoops pull away from Cougars
## Despite a tough first half Cardinal stays in Pac-10 hunt with tough win at home 
### MAUREEN MULLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's basket
ball team (17-6, 10-3 Pacific 10
Conference) turned to the efforts
of its often forgotten inside game
as it squeezed past Washington (4-
20, 1-13) 78-73 at Maples Pavilion
last night.
The Cardinal held off the ef
forts of Cougar senior Alke Dietel
who had game-highs of 30 points
and 10 rebounds. Dietel shot 6 for
11 from three-point-range.
In what is starting to become
the story of the season, the Cardi
nal once again started out slow,
and was down by as much as 13 in
the first half. Washington State
beat Stanford at its own game,
consistently hitting the three
point shot while also nailing some
easy layups.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer
was not happy with her team's
poor performance in the opening
minutes
"It seems that sometimes our
team is waiting to see what kind of
game it is going to be before we
start playing," she said. "We have
t< > get a bloody nose before we start
lighting."
The Cardinal didn't get going
until late in the first half . Down 36-

23 with 6:16 remaining in the half ,
freshman Jamie Carey hit a three
and then a lay-up to spark a 14-0
Cardinal run.
The end of the half belonged to
senior guard Milena Flores. Flores
hit a three to put the Cardinal
within three with just under three
minutes remaining.
On her next run down the
floor, Flores hit senior Christina
Batastini with a beautiful pass,
marking her 600 th career assist.
Flores then drilled a lay-up to give
Stanford a 37-36 lead, its first since
the opening minute.
"I love it when Christina's out
there because she runs her lane so
well and so hard," said Flores. "I
just tried to put the pass between
the two defenders and 1 knew
she'd hit it."
Flores is only the fifth player in
Pac-10 history and the third play
er in Stanford history to hit the
600-assist career mark. She cur
rently leads the conference in as
sists as she bids to become the first
player in Pac-10 history to win the
assist title for three straight sea
sons.
After halftime, the Cougars
continued to hit the threes, staying
close to the Cardinal. It was not
until the 13-minute mark that the
Cardinal finally began to pull
away. It mounted a 17-1 run,
putting it ahead 68-52 with 7:20
remaining.
However, Dietel and the
Cougars weren't going to be put
away that easily. They outscored
the Cardinal 21-8 over the next
seven minutes, the run culminat

ing with a Dietel three that put
Washington State within three
with 17 seconds remaining.
The Cougars fouled Flores,
who made both free throws,
putting the game out of reach.
Stanford again held a balanced
attack with Flores leading the way
with 16 points. Junior Carolyn
Moos was not fair behind with 15,
and sophomore Fnjoli Izidor and
Carey contributed 14 points
apiece. Sophomore Corey Eng
hausen led the Cardinal in re
bounds with eight.
In addition to the 30 points of

Dietel, Yvonne Volkman put in 15
for the Cougars. Katie Nyseth had
a game-high 10 assists for the visi
tors.
VanDerveer was glad that her
team pulled it out, but was discon
tent with the close nature of the
game.
"There is only so many times
you can go to the well," she said.
"It's great that we can come back,
but you've got to be able to put
people away"

After Oregon's (20-6, 11-3) 89-
72 win over UCIA (9-4) last night,
the C Cardinal is now alone in second
place in the conference standings,
a half-game behind the Pucks. The
Bruins and Arizona are a full game
behind in third place.
Tomorrow the Cardinal looks
to avenge its loss against Wash
ington (7-19, 3-11), which upset
Stanford 85-83 when the Cardi
nal traveled to Seattle earlier this
season.
Stanford will have to contain the
play of Megan Fran/a and Loree
Payne, who are first and third, re
spectively, in I lie Pac-10 scoring
standings.
