Senior Zach Zimmerer may be a
monster on the mat, but his quieU
leadership and determination off
it may make him Stanford's
four-time NCAA participant

The Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships will likely mark the end of the year
for most of the Stanford Men's wrestling
team. However, for one member, it will be the
beginning to his ultimate goal of becoming a
national champion.
Fifth-year senior Zach Zimmerer heads
into this weekend's tournament hoping to
qualify for his fourth-straight NCAA Tourna
ment, something no other Stanford wrestler
has done.
Over Zimmerer's career as a four-ytar
starter, he has accumulated a record of 81-41,
with only 23 losses by pin. After finishing
fourth his freshman year and second the past
two years, he currently sits at first in the Pac
-10 and sixth in the nation heading into the

Pac-10 Championships.
1 lowever, Zimmerer has not always been
at the top of his game. As a Stanford fresh
man, he was inconsistent. As head coach
Chris Hoi pel remembered, one of his first
years, Zach led the team in both wins and loss
es, a rather unusual mix.
"He could beat an All-American one week
and lose to someone below his skill level the
next," Horpel added. "However, as he ma
tured, he really learned the mental prepara
tion part of wrestling. "
Now Zimmerer, wrestling at 133 pounds,
has finally harnessed his potential and be
come a more invariable part of the team. So
far this season, he has fallen to only one op
ponent, Fresno State's Paris Ruiz.
This one has been a rather unusual year
for Zimmerer. Normally, he wrestles more
than 30 matches. So far this year, he has only

wrestled a total of 14
Due to the death of assistant coach lod
Surmon, the Cardinal was forced to with
draw from two competitions earlier in the
year. Due to an ankle sprain, Zimmerer also
had to withdraw from Midlands, the only
tournament where Cardinal wrestlers face
opponents outside the Pac-10. He was also
compelled to sit out the All Cal Invitational
because of a pinched nerve in his neck. Hut .ill
of this luis not effected his attitude going into
the Pac-lOs.
"My one loss was good for me in a way,"
Zimmerer said. "It lias forced me to work
harder, and I feel a key to my success will be
if I can throw the rest of the season behind me
and go in thinking that this is the one and
only tournament of the year.
