Senior Zach Zimmerer may be a
monster on the mat, but his quieU
leadership and determination off
it may make him Stanford's
four-time NCAA participant

The Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships will likely mark the end of the year
for most of the Stanford Men's wrestling
team. However, for one member, it will be the
beginning to his ultimate goal of becoming a
national champion.
Fifth-year senior Zach Zimmerer heads
into this weekend's tournament hoping to
qualify for his fourth-straight NCAA Tourna
ment, something no other Stanford wrestler
has done.
Over Zimmerer's career as a four-ytar
starter, he has accumulated a record of 81-41,
with only 23 losses by pin. After finishing
fourth his freshman year and second the past
two years, he currently sits at first in the Pac
-10 and sixth in the nation heading into the

Pac-10 Championships.
1 lowever, Zimmerer has not always been
at the top of his game. As a Stanford fresh
man, he was inconsistent. As head coach
Chris Hoi pel remembered, one of his first
years, Zach led the team in both wins and loss
es, a rather unusual mix.
"He could beat an All-American one week
and lose to someone below his skill level the
next," Horpel added. "However, as he ma
tured, he really learned the mental prepara
tion part of wrestling. "
Now Zimmerer, wrestling at 133 pounds,
has finally harnessed his potential and be
come a more invariable part of the team. So
far this season, he has fallen to only one op
ponent, Fresno State's Paris Ruiz.
This one has been a rather unusual year
for Zimmerer. Normally, he wrestles more
than 30 matches. So far this year, he has only

wrestled a total of 14
Due to the death of assistant coach lod
Surmon, the Cardinal was forced to with
draw from two competitions earlier in the
year. Due to an ankle sprain, Zimmerer also
had to withdraw from Midlands, the only
tournament where Cardinal wrestlers face
opponents outside the Pac-10. He was also
compelled to sit out the All Cal Invitational
because of a pinched nerve in his neck. Hut .ill
of this luis not effected his attitude going into
the Pac-lOs.
"My one loss was good for me in a way,"
Zimmerer said. "It lias forced me to work
harder, and I feel a key to my success will be
if I can throw the rest of the season behind me
and go in thinking that this is the one and
only tournament of the year.

"When 1 face my opponents this
weekend, I have to think it is the
first time that 1 have met them and
clear my mind of what has tran
spired in the past," Zim merer said.
Despite his success, Zimtnerer's
tenacity on the mat is usually sub
dued to a rather mellow demeanor
off of it.
"He is pretty quiet," said Stan
lord men's wrestling coach Clu is
Horpel, "but he is a terror on the
mat."
As quiet as he may seem, Zim
merer is an emotional leader.
Beinga team co-captain lor the sec
ond year, he continues to inspire
his teammates.
"Zach is an irreplaceable part of

our team," sophomore Andy
Hunter said. "During the past
three years he lias played several
different roles for me: mentor,
friend, motivator, sometimes even
coach. In the practice room he is
quiet, yet exudes a. very intense
presence that lifts the room."
His role as captain allows him to
be an integral and essential part of
the team, which is a responsibility
that he enjoys and takes a lot of
pride in.
"An important part of being
captain is being able to relate to the
other guys on the team," Ziinmer
er said. "From (lie best guy on the
team to the worst, I feel that I can
connect with what they are feeling.
"As a freshman, I remember
dealing with all of the outside influ
ences that some of my teammates
are dealing with now, and by let
ting them know that I have had to
deal with these same issues, thev

are able to have respect for me."
I lis teammates, whether incom
ing freshmen or fellow seniors, all
hold Ziminerer with the highest
amount of respect. Although he is a
key to gaining points for the Cardi
nal, the effect he has on his team
mates is an even greater part of the
team.
"Regrettably, I have not had the
honor of being around him for
more than a few months," fresh
man Brad Selby said. "But he has
impressed me so much with his
lead-by-example intensity and in
credibly solid work ethic.
"He brings so much to the
wrestling room in his words of en
couragement and ability to domi
nate, and he's also a great friend off
the mat. I've enjoyed getting to
know him personally. He's a top
notch wrestler and person."
Senior Rudy Ruiz agreed.
"1 think he's taught a lot of guys

by example, the mental and physi
cal toughness it takes to be success
ful at the collegiate level," he said.
"When I've been down and lost
confidence, he's made a huge dif
ference by coming along to en
courage me and to help me re
focus."
Beyond this weekend's Pac-10
Championships and the likelihood
of a fourth NCAA appearance,
Zimmerer will leave Stanford with
a double major in Mechanical En
gineering and Economics and
head out into the battle of the work
place, to take on any competition
the real world throws at him.
But for now, he's focused on this
weekend.
"The whole season is a mix be
tween wrestling and school, but
once the Pac-lOs start, it is as if
wrestling is the only thing on my
mind and it is the only thing that
matters."
