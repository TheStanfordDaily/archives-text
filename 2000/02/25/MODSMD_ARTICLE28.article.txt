# Tennis takes on Bears
## No. 1 Stanford heads to Berkeley to face off with No. 2 California Golden Bears 
### BILL HANSON STAFF WRITER 
Exactly one year ago, (California
narrowly triumphed over arch
rival Stanford, 5-4, at the Taube
Family I ennis Stadium.
A lot can change in a year.
These days. Stanford, now the
nation's top-ranked team, seems
to have No. 2 Cal's number.
Last weekend, the Cardinal
crushed Cal, 8-0, to win the 2000
L S I A/ I 1 A National Team In
door Championships held at the
I niversih of Wisconsin in Madi
son.
"We knew we had to take it to
them to win that match," said se
nior Teryn Ashley. "I was proud of
how everybody fought. We really
wanted to sweep them and we
did."
The Cardinal (11-0, 5-0 Pacific
10 (Conference) now boasts a string
of 29 straight dual-match victories.
Tomorrow, the Cardinal will
face Cal again, this time on the
Be ars' home courts. Despite Stan
ford's recent lop-sided victory, the
Bears remain a threat.
"I know they're going to be
gunning foi us," Ashley said.
"They're probably going to
change their lineup around a bit,
but we'll be ready. I not only have
confidence in myself, I have confi
dence in all my teammates."
The Bears are led by seniors
Amy Jensen and Anita kurimay.
Jensen, a left-handed serve-and
vollever ranked 19th in the nation.
is known both lor her explosive tal
ent as well as for her explosive
emotional volatility.
Kuray, on the other hand, is a
gritty all-court player with a low
houncing backhand slice. Kurimay
has caused fits for the Cardinal in
the past, notching wins over both
Ashley and sophomore star Maris
sa Irvin.
Irvin, who last season reached
the final of the NCAA Individual
tournament and concluded her
freshman campaign ranked sec
ond in the nation, travels to Berke
ley unranked by the Intercollegiate
Tennis Association. Although she
sports a perfect 7-0 match record,
slie has yet to participate in enough
dual matches to qualify for a colle
giate ranking.
In lieu of collegiate competition,
Irvin has participated in profes
sional tournaments over the past
several months. At No. 99, she is
currently the highest-ranked ama

teur on the Women's Tennis Asso
ciation Tour
In January, Irvin upset 3T>tlÂ»-
ranked Corina Morariu in the first
round of the Australian Open in
Melbourne, Australia, before suc
cumbing to eventual champion
Lindsay Davenport in the second
round. Three weeks ago, Irvin
captured her second professional
title at the $35,000 Challenger
tournament in Clearwater, Fla.
Freshman Laura Granville
plays No. 2 singles for the Cardinal.
Granville, who won the prestigious
Rolex National Intercollegiate In
door Championships, the third leg
of the collegiate Grand Slam, in
early February, has launched a
debut campaign reminiscent of
Irvin's precocious debut one year
ago.
At No. 2, Granville is currently
the nation's highest-ranked fresh
man. She boasts a 20-2 singles
record.
Ashley, the team's senior cap
tain who has been ranked as high
as fourth in the nation, has been
struggling with erratic play this
season while recovering from per

sistent tendonitis in her wrist.
Nonetheless, Ashley was
pleased with her play in Madison
after knocking offCal's Claire Cur
ran, 6-0, 6-4, at No. 3 singles and,
with partner Irvin, upsetting the
nation's top-ranked duo of Jensen
and Curran, 8-4, at No. 1 doubles.
"I feel really good about my
game," she said. "I fought really
hard in the second set [against Cur
ran]."
Sophomore Cabriela Lastra is
also feeling good about her game.
She has not lost since early Janu
ary, having won her last 10 singles
matches.
"She's playing No. 5 singles, and
last year she played No. 3," Ashley
said.
"She wants to win every match.
There's a lot of pride on the line for
her. That's the attitude she takes to
the court."
Before tomorrow's match
against Cal, Lastra and the rest of
the Stanford squad will take on No.
66 UNLV at home today. Accord
ing the Ashley, the match should
serve as a warm- up for Saturday's
duel.
