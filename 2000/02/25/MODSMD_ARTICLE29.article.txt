### TIM KANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last weekend, the California
basketball team took on Stanford
and got sent back to Berkeley
with its tail between its legs. This
weekend, it's the No. 2 baseball
team's (8-4) turn to try and pun
ish the Golden Bears (5-7), as the
two teams meet for a three-game
nonconference series at Evans Di
amond in Berkeley.
The first game gets under'way
at 2 p.m. today, with junior Justin
Wayne taking on Cal's Trevor
Hutchinson.
The game will be an interest
ing reunion of sorts lor Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess and
Cal head coach David Esquer. Es
quer, who took over lor the re
tired Bob Milanoin the oil season,
was Marquess's right-hand man
on the Farm from 1991-96, and
played under Marquess from
1984-87 as a shortstop, winning a
national championship in 1987.
"He was a great player — I
know him well," Marquess said.
"He's an outstanding person and
a great young coach, and he'll do
a good job over there."

Will ii be unusual seeing Es
cjuer in blue and gold? "It will be
at first, but we'll get over it," Mar
quess said with a smile.
Undoubtedly, Esquer will be
hoping that junior third baseman
Xavier Nady will help Cal avoid
the same fate their basketball

team suffered. Nady was named
the preseason National Player of
the Year by both Baseball America
and Collegiate Baseball in addition
to being a first-team preseason Ail-
American, and is likely to be the first
player chosen in baseball's amateur
draft in June.
"He's one of the better hitters in
baseball, and he's put up big num
bers for two years," said Marquess,
referring to Nady's 38 home runs
and 132 runs batted during his two
years at Cal. Nady also clubbed 17
homers while playing for Team
USA in international play during
the summer.
Pitching around Nady is made

more difficult by the feet that catch
er Mike Tonis bats behind him.
Tonis jacked 17 homers of his own
last year to go with 60 RBIs and a
team-leading .384 batting average.
"They've got a good one-two
punch there," said Marquess. "
Stanford's big hitter this season
continues to be senior first baseman
Craig Thompson, who went 5 for 8
against Texas last weekend and is
currently hitting a blistering .392,
while leading the team in hits with
20 and being tied for the lead in
home runs at three.
The rest of the team isn't quite so
hot, with its collective batting aver
age currently at .264,.
"We've done a g<xxl job defen
sively, but I think we need to pick it
up with the bat, and hopefully that
will come as we go along," said Mar
quess.
