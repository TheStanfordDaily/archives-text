### TIM KANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last weekend, the California
basketball team took on Stanford
and got sent back to Berkeley
with its tail between its legs. This
weekend, it's the No. 2 baseball
team's (8-4) turn to try and pun
ish the Golden Bears (5-7), as the
two teams meet for a three-game
nonconference series at Evans Di
amond in Berkeley.
The first game gets under'way
at 2 p.m. today, with junior Justin
Wayne taking on Cal's Trevor
Hutchinson.
The game will be an interest
ing reunion of sorts lor Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess and
Cal head coach David Esquer. Es
quer, who took over lor the re
tired Bob Milanoin the oil season,
was Marquess's right-hand man
on the Farm from 1991-96, and
played under Marquess from
1984-87 as a shortstop, winning a
national championship in 1987.
"He was a great player â€” I
know him well," Marquess said.
"He's an outstanding person and
a great young coach, and he'll do
a good job over there."

Will ii be unusual seeing Es
cjuer in blue and gold? "It will be
at first, but we'll get over it," Mar
quess said with a smile.
Undoubtedly, Esquer will be
hoping that junior third baseman
Xavier Nady will help Cal avoid
the same fate their basketball
