# Volleyball's eye on Tigers, revenge
## Men seek to regain a spot in the top 15, but Tigers have Andric 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
Two teams with similar
records, similar statistics and simi
lar dreams will battle it out tonight
at Maples Pavilion as the Stanford
men's volleyball team (6-7, 6-5
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa

tion) meets Pacific (5-9, 4-6).
For Stanford it will be a fight to
work its way back into the rank
ings, for No. 12 Pacific, a fight to
stay there. Whoever comes out on
top will be an important step clos
er to snagging a MPSF playoff
berth.
Memories of past meetings
with the Pacific Tigers probably
jar pangs of frustration and disap
pointment for Stanford fans. Last
year the Cardinal climbed to a
convincing 2-0 lead in both
matches with the Tigers only to

fall 3-2 both times. The losses not
only pushed Stanford into a losing
record for the season, but also
kept the squad out of the tourna
ment.
This year the Cardinal is out for
revenge. The squad has been
steadily improving since its early
season six-game losing streak and
has already downed two ranked
teams this week, then-No. 9 Loy
ola Marymount and No. 15 UC-
Irvine. It's time for Stanford to go
for three.
"We have a team that if we
work hard, stick together and
come ready to play, it's a team
that's going to improve," said
head coach Ruben Nieves. "We
have seven freshmen who have
never played at this level before,
but we've done those things and
now we're seeing the results."
Stanford currently boasts the
nation's top hitter in freshman
Curt Toppel, who has notched an
impressive 330 kills for a 7.67 kills
per-game average. But the Cardi
nal's strength in its recent wins has
been taking the pressure of Top
pel and utilizing other talent.
The versatile Marcus Skacel, a
sophomore, has had a recent
surge in kills, finishing with more
than 20 kills in each of the past
three matches, destroying his pre
vious career high of 16. Skacel has
also taken charge on defense and
leads the team in digs with 109
and a 2.53 per-game average that
puts him comfortably in the na
tion's top 20.
In the past four matches, five of
Toppel's teammates, Skacel, ju
nior Brett Youngberg and fresh
men Billy Strickland, KyleStrache
and Will Curtis have recorded at
least one double-digit perfor
mance in kills. The consistent
team effort has revitalized the
squad.
"Right now we have a good for
mula," Nieves said of his lineup.
"But we have a ways to go, we can
still get significantly better."
Tonight would be a good time
for Stanford to take another step
in its improvement. The squad
can start with containing junior
Tiger standout Vladimir Andric.
A 1999 All-MPSF recipient, An

dric led the Tigers across the
board in kills-per-game (5.58),
aces-per-game (.490) and digs
per-game (1.76).
Stanford veterans will remem
ber the name Vladimir Andric as
Pacific's powerhouse that snagged
AVCA National Player of the
Week honors after posting a ca
reer-high 50 kills against Stanford
last year.
"We're going to have blockers
in front of [Andric] all night,"
Nieves said. "It's a good strategy,
but that's what we did last year
and as the match went on they set
him more and more and he kept
putting balls away."
Andric has been on fire again
this year and currently leads the
team with 228 kills while placing
second in aces (12) and digs (72).
The Cardinal will have to contain
him better than last year in order
to shut down the Tigers.
"This year we have the ability to
serve [Andric] and hopefully that
takes away part of his game," said
assistant coach John Kosty.

Freshman Paul Bocage converts junior Josh Lukens' assist into a kill. Stanford
takes on No. 1 2 Pacific tonight at Maples.
"And we need to contain his
jump serve. If the guy gets hot hit
ting his jump serve, lie's going to
feelgood about his attacking. But il
we pass well he's going to hit hard
er and harder and create errors."
On paper, the two teams have
the statistics that should make for
a close game. Stanford and Pacific
rank seventh and eighth in the
conference in dig averages with
10.38 and 8.71, respectively, and
in block averages, Pacific is eighth
(4.68) while Stanford ranks ninth
(4.22). They are also back-to-back

in hitting percentages with Pacific
leading Stanford .308 to .304.
Against conference opponents,
Pacific upset BYU (3-2), a team
that shut Stanford down 3-0 earli
er this season. But Stanford has
posted wins over Loyola Mary
mount and UC-Irvine, both
teams that have tamed the Tigers
this season.
"It's a big match for us, because
this is one of the teams that we
need to beat out for a playoff
spot," Nieves said. "Our point
scoring was good [against UC-
Irvine] but it was our weakest
sideout match in our last five
games. To beat the top teams we
have to combine good point scor
ing with a strong sideout game."
