# Golfers take 3rd at Arizona Invite
## Women shoot past top teams Duke, USC for impressive show in Tucson 
### MATT MCQUINN 
The sixth-ranked Stanford
women's golf team placed third
in Wednesday's Arizona Invita
tional in Tucson, Ariz., eight
strokes behind No. 1 Arizona
and just one stroke back of No. 3
Arizona State.
The team fired three solid
rounds for a final 865, finishing
1 over par at the Randolph Park
Golf Course — perhaps its most
impressive finish since the Pacif
ic 10 Championship last year.
This tournament fronted the
best teams from across the coun
try, including the top eight Divi
sion I teams. The Cardinal fin
ished eight strokes ahead of
N0.2 Duke and 24 ahead of con
ference rival USC.
" It was probably the best field
we played this year," said junior
Stephanie Keever. "It was much
like the NCAA finals."
Leading the team was fresh
man Kim Rowton, who finished
tied for second with a three-day
212,4 under. Rowton, a San An
tonio native, was a three-time
high school Ail-American, lead
ing her high school to three con
secutive state titles. With such a
resume, her stellar play came as
no surprise to her coach.
"Coming into this year, Kim
was the top-rated high school
player in the country. We knew
she would one day step up to the
challenge," said Stanford head
coach Caroline O'Connor. "If
we aspire to win championships,
we need players like Kim to step
up."
Rowton finished just one
stroke back from first place,
claimed bv Duke star Beth

Bauer.
Rowton was followed by All-
American teammate Stephanie
Keever, whose 2-under total of
214 landed her in 10th place in
dividually.
Yet, the entire team con
tributed to Stanford's outstand
ing 112 inish. Keever carded consis
tent rounds of 75, 73 and a final
day 72 to aid the Cardinal.
In addition, senior JaeJean
Roc's and junior Salimah Mus
sani's respective rounds of 71
and 73 on Monday helped pro
pel the Cardinal.
To open the tournament, the
Cardinal posted a season-low
284 and led by live strokes with
two days to play.
Arizona's 277 on Tuesday
vaulted the Wildcats ahead of
the Cardinal. The Cardinal fin
ished with daily scores of 290
and 291 — good scores, but still
not low enough to catch run
away Arizona.
"Despite such a low score on
Monday, We played better in
the final round," said O'Con
nor. "In the final round we hit a
lot of shots close."
This tournament marks the
Cardinal's second straight third
place finish. The team also
placed third in the OSU / SMU
Invitational, Feb. 7-9. With
these consecutive solid finishes,
the Cardinal seems to be gather
ing momentum for the rest of
the season and the Pac-10
Championship in April.
The team will next travel to
Hawaii to compete in the Rain
bow Wahine Invitational on
March 28, one of three tourna
ments before the conference fi
nals.
"Everybody has a lot of confi
dence and we realize we can
compete with other teams,"
Rowton said. "It's great to have
that confidence going into the
spring. We know we will be in
contention for the national
championship."
