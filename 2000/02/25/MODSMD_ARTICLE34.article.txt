# Women's gym heads to Corvallis
## No. 8 Stanford keeps rolling to postseason as it faces off against slumping Oregon State 
### KATIE FITZPATRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Coming off a record-setting
weekend, the No. 8 Stanford
women's gymnastics team (7-2, 3-2
Pacific 10 Conference) is on a high
as it heads to Oregon State (7-4,3-1)
tonight.
Because the Cardinal competed
against BYU on Monday, the dual
against Oregon Suite will be its third
meet within a week's time. The
gymnasts have had only one day of
training to prepare for the meet and

could be tired.
"We'll train veiy specific tilings
this week. We're going to try to keep
everything the same tor Oregon
State," said assistant coath Rene
Lyst C<x)k.
The gymnasts agree.
"We don't need to make any dra
matic changes, it is just a matter of
building confidence and continuing
to refine things," said senior co-cap
tain Kim Young.
Stanford was nursing injuries
against both California and
Brigham Young but managed to do
very well due to some excellent per
formances. Stanford may continue
to rest key individuals this weekend,
most notably junior Jennifer Exalta
cion.
Exaltation, a 1996 Canadian
Olympian, has been a strong all
around performer for the Cardinal
this year. The school-record holder
on the beam, Exaltat ion could com
pete only balance beam if she is not
healthy enough for the all-around
competition.
If Exaltacion is sidelined, look for
senior All-American Larissa
Eontaine to continue to produce for
the Cardinal. Fontaine shattered
the school all-around record against
BYU, scoring no lower than a 9.925
on every event. Her all-around total
of 39.825 is the highest all-around
score in the NCAA this season. Be
cause of her line performances last
weekend, Fontaine is currently the
Pac-10 C iymnast of the Week for the
second time this season.
The performances of sopho
more Katy Herbert and freshman
Abby Gair will also be key for Stan
ford. Both recorded new career
high scores in the all-around com
petition against BYU.
In addition to her contributions
on other events, Herbert will be es
pecially valuable in the beam lineup
where the team will be without the
services of its most consistent per
former of the year, sophomore
Beckv Meldrum, who will miss the

meet to attend a family funeral.
Herbert, the 1999 Regional balance
beam champion, is well qualified to
lead the team on this event.
Without Meldrum, fellow sopho
more Kristin Jensen could see ac
tion on beam. Jensen stepped up
big last weekend in the absence of

Exaltacion, vaulting for the first"
time all season and returning to the
bar lineup. Jensen will also be a*
strong competitor on floor.
The vault lineup may see the v&4
turn of junior ' Jenny Wilson. Wilson*

is a powerful vaulter and will be a
valuable addition to the vaulting
lineup, which is currently lacking
some depth.
Freshman Kelsey Stillinger has
been working to improve the depth
of the vault lineup. She recently
began competing a more difficult
vault and is still working to improve
it. Stillinger will also be needed to
hit a clean set on beam.
Freshman Alissa Cooper should
produce big scores for the Cardinal
on both vault and bars. Cooper
t(K)k second place against BYU on

vault and has l)een a consistent per
former on bars this year.
Senior Ail-American Sarah
Harding will Ix* an important piece
of both the bars and floor lineup.
On floor last week, she scored a
near-perfect 9.95. Harding may in
crease her tumbling difficulty of her
first pass against Oregon State,
something she has been looking to
do all season.
Oregon State, normally a Pac-10
powerhouse, has been struggling
this season. But there is still a large
amount of fan sport enjoyed by the
Oregon State gymnasts, making it a
difficult place to compete. Stanford
may be tired, but it has proven itself
to be mentally tough and capable of
handling adversity.
