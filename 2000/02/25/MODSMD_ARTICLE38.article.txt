# MPSF Indoor next for track teams
## Men, women use one last meet to prepare for NCAA Championships in March 
### CHRISTOPHER LYLE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The fast feet of the No. 2 Stan
ford men and No. 9 women, well
rested altera week off from compe
tition, are heading for the bright
lights of Reno, Nev., this weekend

to compete in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Indoor Champi
onships.
"This meet will be a great oppor
tunity tor our men's team to com
pete together," said head coach Vin
Lananna. "We have been splitting
the squad between several different
meets throughout the season and
this will lie our first combined team
effort."
Another break from the rest of
the season to this point is in meet
philosophy. Thus far, qualifying
athletes by NCAA standards for the
championship meet has been a top

priority. With a very impressive list
of athletes already qualified, that
objective will not cany the same
weight.
Lananna said athletes have been
entered in events where they will
benefit the most, but not necessari
ly where they will be in the best po
sition to reach NCAA qualifying
marks.
The meet should feature some
good competition for the Cardinal.
Most of the Pacific 10 Conference
schools, as well as Utah Suite and
Long Beach State, will be in Reno.
Lananna expects especially good
performances from No. 13 Arizona
and No. 23 Washington State 011
the men's side.
The women can expect a chal
lenge if No. 2 UCIA shows up, but
the Bruins have traditionally made
light of this meet. At No. 14, Arizona
State is also strong.
The men will be challenged, in
particular, byjefl Dutoit of Arizona
in the pole vault and lan Waltz of
Washington State in shot put.
The men are looking for key
performances from the middle-dis
tance and distance squads, which
have had not problem blowing by
the competition so far in the season.
Specifically, sophomores (labe Jen
nings and Jonathon Riley and ju
nior Michael Stember will be top
competitors.
The Stanford distance ranks suf
fered a blow when it was an
nounced that senior Brad Hauser,
last year's indoor 5,000-meter
champion, will miss the meet in
order to train for the World Cross
Country Championships in March.
I lauser's absence this weekend
indicates that he will not compete in
the NCAA Indoor Championships
for the Cardinal.
Stanford will also be well repre
sented on the field. Sophomore
Chris Sprague will continue a
strong season in the shot put, and
junior Todd Beyerlein and senior
Toby Stevenson will try to continue
their winning ways in the high
jump and pole vault, respectively.
The women boast an athlete in

the top five of ever)' event in the
MPSF, including three of the top
five in the 3,000 meters.
A strong performance at the
MPSF meet would be another
notch 011 an already, impressive list
of performances by the team so far.
"I am very pleased with our ath
letes this season. We have a record
number of athletes that achieved
the Mountain-Pacific conference
standard and we have our largest
contingent of NCAA qualifiers ever.
We wanted to use the indoor season
to prepare us for a great outdoor
campaign, and I believe we have
put ourselves in an enviable posi
tion for the spring of 2000."
This will be the last indoor meet
except for those athletes who have
qualified for the NCAA Indoor
championship meet, held on
March 10 and 11.
