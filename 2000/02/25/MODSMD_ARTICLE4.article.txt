# Candidates propose different improvements to health care
## 
### GREG PAGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As candidates from both parties gear up
tor the "Super Tuesday" primaries on
March 7, which includes twelve states for
the Republicans and fifteen lor the Democ -
rats, health care is one of the primary issues
on voter's minds.
George W. Bush's health care stance is

based on the idea that the system should be
decentralized, and that it should be more
flexible.
"The danger in the health care debate is
that America falls prey to the idea that the
federal government should make all the de
cisions for consumers, and the federal gov
ernment should make all decisions lor the
providers, that the federal government
should ration care," Bush said at a January

(i()!' debate in lowa.
"Bush wants to give the freedom of
health care to the people," said sophomore
Tai-Li Chang, president of the Stanford
Republicans. "As a case in point, he wants to
allow patients to appeal denials of care to an
independent review panel, and in some
cases take the HMO to court. 1 le wants to
strengthen Medicare by providing more
choice and more private sector alternatives

for the elderly."
John McCain, the other GOP candidate,
also says patients should have more free
dom in choosing their health care.
"Americans should be free to choose
their doctors, including specialists, if they
are willing to bear the additional costs which
may accompany this freedom," said McCain
in a Senate statement last year. "People
should be able to enroll in a point-of-service

plan with access to a multitude of physicians,
rather than be limited to an HM() which re
stricts freedom of choice in doctors."
Like Bush, McCain proposes a system by
which citizens could take 1 IM() decisions in
court. On the Senate floor last year, Met lain
called for "external appeals processes
which are fair and readily available and
which use neutral experts who are
not selected, paid, or otherwise be
holden to the HMO."
Bradley has made universal or
near-universal health care a central
theme of his campaign. On his
Web site, Bradley writes, "We must
make a clear national commitment
to cover, as close as possible, all peo
ple in America."
" The plan will cost between $50
billion and $65 billion a year,"
Bradley said at an October Debate
at Dartmouth College. "It will come
either from the surplus, or it will
come through the enormous sav
ings that we can get through the ap
plication of technology to the med
ical system."
Bradley would move towards
his goal of expanding insurance
with his plan to line up all Medicaid
recipients with a primary care
physician. At a January Democratic
debate in lowa, Bradley said, "II

you're a Medicare recipient, two
thirds of doctors won't accept you.
You go to an emergency room to
get the most expensive care. 1 want
to provide a primary care physician
for everyone."
While Gore also says he wants to
expand the scope of health care, his
plan is slightly less comprehensive
than Bradley's.
"My health care plan provides
coverage for almost 90 percent of
the American people .... The
cost is $146 billion over ten years,"
Gore said at the Dartmouth De
bate. Gore is also championing
more patient freedom of choice, as
well as parity between mental and
physical health issues.
"I strongly support a health care
patients' bill of rights, an 11M() pa
tients' bill of rights," Gore said at
the Dartmouth Debate. "I support
moving toward parity in the treat
ment of mental health ... in the
same way as physical health. The
availability of treatment for dia
betes and the availability of treat
ment for depression or schizophre
nia ought to be the same."
