A Stanford sheriff's car struck a freshman biker last night in front of Florence Moore Hall. The student sustained no serious injuries. This
is the second time this month that a student on a bike was hit in the intersection, according to senior Megan Tompkins, an Alondra RA.
'This is ridiculous/' said Tompkins. "We've been trying to get something done here for a while now, like getting a red light put in."
