## 
### NICOLI RICHARDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Nearly 2,700 parents and family mem
bers are scheduled to arrive on the Farm
as part of Stanford's annual Parents'
Weekend. Parents can look forward to
some new events during the weekend.
"We hope to provide parents with the
opportunity to get all of their questions an
swered as well as to give them a taste of
Stanford life," said Beverly Momoi of Uni
versity Communications, who is one of the
coordinators for the weekend.
The weekend will be kicked off today
with two welcome addresses. Vice Provost
of Student Affairs James Montoya will
speak to freshmen and their parents and
Dean of Student Affairs Marc Wais will
welcome continuing students and their
parents. The topics for both speeches will
be how parents can help their children
makes the most out of their undergradu
ate years.
Alter the traditional welcome speeches,
parents can attend another address, given
by Vice Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation John Bravman and Associate
Provost Ellen Woods. They will speak
about recent changes designed to enhance
undergraduate education. Bravman will
address freshman and sophomore parents

on the recent developments in Stanford's
introductory studies program, and Woods
will address junior and senior parents
about ways in which Stanford's curriculum
is designed to enrich the undergraduate
experience, such as various research op
portunities.
Next, parents can attend an informal
talk and question and a answer session
with President Gerhard Casper. Following
this, parents are invited to attend lectures
given by various professors around cam
pus and visit the residence halls for wel
come receptions.
A panel discussion Saturday morning
011 career advising is one of the new op
tions available this year. The panel will be
made up mostly of administrators with
some students and some parents to discuss
resources available for both students and
parents to help in the decision-making
process. Director of the Career Develop
ment Center Robert 1 hirsk is scheduled to
attend and facilitate the discussion.
Momoi said she is glad to report anoth
er change to this year's itinerary: more res
idence halls are participating in Parents'
Weekend welcome receptions. Momoi
said the large size of the freshman class will
not result in a larger attendance at this
year's weekend. I'he number o( registered
parents is 2,700, which is consis
tent with attendance from the last
three years.
Parents also have the option to
register on-site upon arrival.
Momoi said the office will prepare
a couple hundred on-site registra
tion packets for late-comers, hut
that last year only a little over a
hundred parents used this option.
Momoi said she expects 50 per
cent of freshman parents, 20 to 2;i
percent of sophomore parents, 15
percent of junior parents, and 12
to 13 percent of senior parents to

attend the weekend. In addition,
other family members like grand
parents, siblings, and aunts and
uncles can attend.
She said these numbers are fair
ly consistent from year to year de
spite the fact that invitations are
sent to all undergraduate parents.
I lie success of the weekend de
pends upon students and stall
who volunteer to welcome par
ents and facilitate activities.
"Their participation is vital to
the success of the weekend,"
Momoi said.
She said it would be virtually
impossible to manage the 2,700
additional persons expec ted to be
wandering the grounds of the
campus this weekend.
