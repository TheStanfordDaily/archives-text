Loneliness - that painful
feeling of isolation from
others - is familiar to most
students. It takes different forms
in different people. Some feel
lonely when they are excluded
by an individual or a group
(social loneliness); others feel it
when they have no one to talk
to about their deepest concerns,
or with whom to build a close
personal relationship (emotional
loneliness).
Loneliness is different from
solitude: we choose solitude for
an opportunity to be still or to
reflect on our lives; we
experience loneliness as an
involuntary lack of connectedness
to others.
Being alone doesn't automati
cally mean loneliness - many
people enjoy it. And you can feel
lonely in a crowd, in class, or at a
party or a sports event. You can
also feel lonely with a partner,
best friend, or family member.
Causes
Loneliness is often caused by:
■ Separation from family and
friends
■ New and unfamiliar sur
roundings
■ Shyness
■ The break-up of a relationship
■ Fear of rejection or repeated
relationship disappointments
■ The absence of people who
understand you, your interests
or experiences
Effects
The effects of loneliness include:
■ Increased self-doubt, self
consciousness, and lowered
self-esteem
■ Poorer performance resulting
from decreased self-confidence
■ The (false) assumption that
others are evaluating you
The satisfaction that comes from
being connected to others is
timeless. Here Stanford zoology
students get together for a picnic
in 1898.
negatively
■ Unrealistic expectations, like
thinking everyone should
like you or include you
■ Difficulty introducing yourself,
making phone calls, or
participating in group activities
■ Dependence on others to
build your self-esteem and
initiate activities
■ The possibility of becoming
more isolated, withdrawn,
angry, unhappy
Become an Observer
Notice when loneliness hits you
(what times of day, holidays,
anniversaries, birthdays) and
plan to be busy during these
times. Watch for behavior that
perpetuates your loneliness, and
ways you put up barriers to
others. Observe those you
consider to be socially skilled,
and learn from them.
What Else to Do
■ If you are lonely, do something
about it
■ Do not become a hermit: find
situations that allow you to
be involved with others
■ Introduce yourself and say
hello
■ Practice starting short
conversations with someone
sitting next to you
■ Focus on others rather than
yourself
■ Attend every social event
you can
■ Get involved in a class
discussion or activity
■ Ask someone in your class to
be your study partner
■ Go to leisurely student hang
outs (places like coffee houses)
■ Pursue the activities you
enjoy so you'll meet people
with the same interests
■ Join a club, pursue a spiritual
interest, or do some
volunteer work
■ Don't expect others to do
things for you - take the
initiative
■ Don't wait for others to call
you - contact a friend and
invite him or her to do
something with you
■ Don't take a rejection
personally
■ Don't be too quick to judge
others - give them a chance
■ Do expect others to be
different from you; and be
respectful of those differences
■ Be a friend first; the best
soulmates are based on
friendship
■ Beware of getting stuck in
loneliness; it can lead to
overeating, sleeping too
much, numbing your-self
with alcohol or other drugs,
and depression
■ Don't worry or brood when
you're alone; instead, see the
time as positive, be pro
ductive, enjoy yourself
■ Keep talking with people
until you overcome your
loneliness
Remember, reaching out shows
strength. If loneliness continues
to be a problem, call CAPS for
help (723-3785).Q
