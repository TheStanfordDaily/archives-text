## Boeing workers on strike Negotiation attempts continue to falter 
### 
SEATTLE (AP) — Boeing
engineers were back on the pic k
et lines yesterday after contract
negotiations between the compa
ny and their union broke down
and a federal mediator left town.
No further talks were sched
uled, and engineers and technical
workers promised to keep picket
ing until a new contract agree
ment is reached.
At least 17.000 workers
remained on strike over the
weekend. T he workers walked off
the job Feb. 9.
I he three oilers that Boeing
has made show little movement,
union officials said.
Talks between T he Boeing Co.
and the Society for Professional
Engineering Employees in
Aerospace (SPEEA) broke down
Saturday, and C. Richard Barnes,
the nation's top federal mediator,
left town shortly thereafter.
"We kind offigured this might
happen," said Geoff Lawrey, a
software engineer and 12-year
Boeing veteran who picketed in
front of company headquarters
yesterday."It would've been nice
(to have an agreement), but
nobody seriously thought it
would happen."
Boeing spokesman Peter
Conte said yesterday: "We came
to the table with what we thought
were viable alternatives. We
thought SPEEA's counter-pro
posal was not viable."
Sl'E EA n egot i a tor s' had"sou g I i t
more guaranteed pay raises and
bonuses similar to those received
by the larger Machinists union.
Boeing has insisted on mostly
selective pay increases, reductions
in life insurance benefits and
increased health insurance pre
miums for employees.
While Boeing did not offer
guaranteed bonuses, it did offer
employee stock options. But the
engineers on the picket line —
many of whom know fellow tech
nologists in Seattle's high-tech
workforce — said the options
offer was nearly meaningless.
The union said that Boeing's
latest offer this weekend was very
close to its original offer on Nov.
11, which was near-unanimously
voted down. The second offer,
which was turned down by a slim
margin, was made Jan. 13.
SPEEA contracts cover 22,600
employees in the Seattle area,
California and Kansas, but the
union has only about 64 percent
of those workers as members.
Conte confirmed that Boeing
has started to hire short-term
contract workers to take over
engineering and technical func
tions until the strike is resolved.
I fe did not know how many con
tractor replacements have been
hired.
The company delivered three
more aircraft to customers on Fri
day, bringing the total deliveries
up to nine since the strike began
on Feb. 9. In 1999, Boeing deliv
ered 17 aircraft in the month of
February.
Fim Murphy, a lead engineer
with the company, now drives to
picket sites throughout the region
with large urns of coffee for strik
ing workers. Wherever he's gone,
he said workers remain willing to
strike as long as it takes.
"You know, the longer this
goes on, the more we're going to
ask for when we come back to the
table," Murphy said. "We don't
need to be here. There are plenty
of great jobs out there light now."
