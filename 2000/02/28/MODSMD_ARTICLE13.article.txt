# Pope John Paul II will visit the Holy Land in March
## Trip renews debate on role of prior pontiff during Holocaust 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Consid
ered a hero by the Roman
Catholic church, excoriated as a
villain by many Jews, Pope Pius
XII has left a legacy that is haunt
ing next month's papal pilgrim
age to the I lolv Land.
I he Vatican's top diplomat in
the Holy Land says the wartime
pontiff'kept silent about the Na/i
genocide precisely because he
wanted to save Jewish lives — a
defense ridiculed yesterday by
Holocaust historians and used as
ammunition by ultra-nationalists
in Israel calling for a boycott of
Pope John Paul li s visit.
Archbishop Pietro Sambi's
nationally broadcast comments
and the bitter reaction they have
drawn could overshadow hopes
for reconciliation during the
landmark pilgrimage.
Yisrael Gutnian, the c hief his
torian at Israel's Yad Vashem
Holocaust memorial, said Pius'
failure to condemn the Na/is was
reprehensible.
"Silence could of course not
help," Gutnian said. "It could
only be interpreted as a lack of

interest or as a lack of will to
interfere in the Nazi policy . . .
and murder."
Proceedings to beatify Pius,
the penultimate step before saint
hood, have further strained Jew
ish-Catholic relations, historically
tense over persecution and mas
sacres of Jews by Catholics dur
ing the Inquisition and the Cru
sades and accusations of Vatican
sponsored anti-Semitism.
Some ultra-nationalist Jews
and some ultra-Orthodox Jews
have criticized Israel's chief t ab
bis for planning a meeting with
the pope, saving the March 20-26
visit might spur Christian mis
sionary activity.
Slogans like "Don't meet the
pope" and "No to blasphemy,
No to meeting the pope" were
found yesterday spray-painted
on the exterior walls of the build
ing that currently houses Israel's
chief rabbinate.
I here are still hopes that the
pontiff's historic trip here — the
first for a pope since 1964 — will
be a watershed in Catholic-Jewish
relations, capping years of recon
ciliation work between the faiths.
John Paul 11 has been widely
praised for his overtures to Israel
that culminated in a 1994 treaty
establishing diplomatic relations
between the Vatican and the Jew

ish state.
However, Sambi's comments
vesterdav to Israel FY defending
Pius Nil's wartime record re
opened a painful debate.
"I am convinced that a great
strong condemnation would have
increased the persecution of
Hitler against the Jews," Sambi
said.

I he historian, Cutman, also a
Holocaust survivor, acknowl
edged that at the very final stages
ol the war, Pius did attempt to
save some Hungarian Jews from
the death camps and helped shel
ter others inside the Vatican. He
said. however, that throughout
the war, Catholic institutions and
individuals who put themselves

at risk to save Jewish lives did so
at their own initiative, without
Vatican encouragement or Vati
can support.
Holocaust scholar Yehrtda
Bauer, in a review published in
the daily Jerusalem Post.-of a
recent biography of Pius XII,
said the pontiffs silence was a
moral failing.
