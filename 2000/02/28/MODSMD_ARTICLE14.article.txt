AUSTIN, Texas (AP) â€” In a letter to the
leader of New York's Catholics, Gov. George
W. Bush says his campaign appearance at a
South Carolina school with anti-Catholic
views was a "missed opportunity causing
needless offense, which I deeply regret."
Bush has come under steady criticism lor
his Feb. 2 visit to Bob Jones University, a
Christian school whose leaders have criti
cized the I'ope and labeled the Catholic
church a "Satanic cult."
Opponents have assailed Bush for not

using the appearance to denounce those
views and the school's ban on interracial (lilt
ing. Bush spoke about his conservatism.
In a Feb. 25 letter to Cardinal John
O'Connor of New York, leader ol the arc h
diocese's 2.4 million Roman Catholics, Bush
stated his "profound respect" for the
Catholic Church and said the criticism of
him is unfair and unfounded.
"On reflection, I should have been more
clear in disassociating myself from anti-
Catholic sentiments and racial prejudice,"

Bush said in the letter, which his campaign
released yesterday."It was a missed oppor
tunity causing needless offense, which I
deeply regret."
The letter marked an abrupt reversal for
Bush, who only last week had said: "I don't
make any apologies for what I do in the
campaign."
At a news conference before departing for
Seattle, Bush said he had a c hange of heart
after thinking about impressions of himself
as an anti-CCatholic "that just are not true."

"I regret not using the opportunity to
speak out against the policies," he said. "My
job is to lead the nation. My job is to convince
people to follow me. This was a missed
opportunity and 1 regret it."
Bush faced questions about the speech
almost as soon as he finished it. In response,
he has repeatedly stated his opposition to the
ban on interracial dating and the comments
of the school's leaders. Bush also has noted
that one of his brother and sister-in-law's are
Catholic.
