## The
						Stanford Daily University too lax in defining freshman car policy 
### 
HAVINC ANNOUNCED ITS deci
sion last spring to eliminate fresh
man parking permits for the
upcoming academic year, the Uni
versity has yet to develop or elucidate a
defined policy solution fort lit* problems likely
to be caused by denying freshmen the ability to
possess cars on campus.
The University's inaction in this area could
pose a number of problems for both the
Office of Residential Education and Trans
portation Services as this year concludes and
particularly as freshmen arrive on campus
next year.
When the decision was announced last year,
the University promised an expansion of Mar
guerite service to make up for the elimination
of freshmen's cars. While there were incre
mental increases in both tlie time availability

and area serviced by the Marguerite last year,
these were not in response to the freshman car
policy, and, since then, there have not been the
large-scale changes necessary to deal with the
increased transportation requirements of
freshmen without cars.
The University cannot rely on the Mar
guerite and public transportation alone to
accommodate all the needs of freshmen who,
until the upcoming year, have had access to
their own cars or cars of other freshmen.
If there is no policy in place, much of the
burden for accommodating these concerns is
likely to fall on the shoulders of Res Ed, mak
ing this issue especially salient in light of the
upcoming selection process for resident assis
tants and college assistants for the 2000-2001
academic year.
I low are dorm staffs supposed to deal with

the varied transportation needs of their stu
dents without a defined University stance?
Will there be an increased burden on staff
members and upperclassmen in four-class
dorms to help freshmen deal with the lack of
cars?
The freshman car elimination policy is a
radical departure from current policy and
there seems to be a lack of requisite University
response to handle the problems it poses.
How will the University meet the needs of
students who have off-campus employment or
medical requirements in areas or at times that
are not serviced by public transportation
options?
And, beyond that, there is no plan to accom
modate the unforeseeable times when stu
dents use cars for a variety of social, academic,
and community service-related reasons.

Forcing students to rely on public trans
portation alone, with no other viable option,
appears to greatly limit the ability of students
to enjoy the numerous resources of the com
munities surrounding Stanford.
With Admit Weekend in the near future
and an influx of new prospective freshmen
coming to Stanford, the University must make
a more substantial effort to develop and make
clear its policy on providing transportation
options for freshmen.
At a school whose parking problem pales in
comparison to that of many major public uni
versities, Stanford cannot simply eliminate the
ability of freshmen to have cars and expect
both incoming freshmen and Res Ed staffers
to automatically adjust to the problem within
the bounds of the existing transportation
infrastructure.
