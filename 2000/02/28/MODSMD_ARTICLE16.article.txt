# WHAT THE HECK I'M TALKING ABOUT
## What's my age again? 
### 
I'm getting old. At 21 years of age,
I can already feel the first inklings
of stuffy conservatism sinking in.
The one thing 1 never thought I'd
say is, "I'm turning into my mother."
But the metamorphosis has begun, and
I can do nothing but observe as the first
terrifying changes take place. Oh, the
horror!
It hit home when my cousin, a 17-
year-old junior in high school, was bust
ed by his parents and called me up for
sympathy. Here's the scoop: my Uncle
"Jacob" (not exactly your typical Mexi
can-American Catholic name, but just

play along), is search
ing through the
garage for something
when he comes upon
my cousin "Peter's"
bag on one of the high
shelves. For whatever
parental reason,
Uncle Jacob pulls
down the bag and
unzips it. Inside he
finds two empty beer

bottles and three cans of spray paint.
Spray paint! I couldn't believe it.
I must say that Peter is considered to
be one of the more upstanding cousins.
1 won't get into the ludicrous shenani
gans of the rest of my extended family at
present, but let's just say that Peter has
always been a favorite of the grandpar
ents .and a good student — an outgoing,
friendly kid we used to call "Smiley" and
who always let the girl cousins try his
new video games and play with his "Hot
Wheels" collection.
1 wasn't too surprised about the
drinking, since that's something 1 think
that most high school boys are exposed
to. But I was flabbergasted (yeah, flab
bergasted) to find out that he'd been
graffiti-ing industrial buildings in his
spare time.
Peter explained that he's really into
the hip-hop scene these days — 1
couldn't name anything he listens to,
but he loves finding out about under
ground concerts and seeking out artists
with "raw talent."
His best friend, "Joey," convinced
him that a unique and productive way
to express their commitment to the anti
the-man, anti-institutional messages
they hear in the music they listen to
would be to decorate an industrial
building in a low-income neighborhood
wi(h their art.
This, Peter said, demonstrated the
absurdity of huge corporate properties,
many of them factories or cubicle-filled,
warehouse-style offices where "the indi

vidual is imprisoned."
In effect, the graffiti was their way of
making an artistic political statement.
They didn't write any words, just drew
things. 1 don't know what they drew,
but, according to Peter, they were "anti
consumerist, creative expressions of
individualism." Um, okay.
I was just so taken aback by the whole
thing that I didn't know what to say to
him. 1 didn't want to tell him that I was
on his parents' side*. They had ground
ed him for one month and taken away
his driving privileges for two. I didn't
think it was that harsh. I lie kid needed
to learn a lesson.
Yikes! Where did that come from?
Against my will, I envisioned what the
consequences might have been had
Peter gotten caught under Proposition
21, which (California residents are voting
on iu the March 7 election. He could
have been tried as an adult and gone to
jail. And the fine would have irrevocably
changed his whole family's life — our
whole family's life.
"But what about when you were in
high school and you ..."
" That's different," I said. I was start
ing to feel uncomfortable.
While I do think my individualist
acts of rebellion were quite different
from misdemeanors, I realize how
much I've (hanged as a person since
high school. I thought about how Peter
must feel, having all those high school
revelations for the first time — from
academic discoveries, like reading
"Catcher in the Rye" for the first time,
to social ones, like finding a world of
injustice that exists outside of our own
personal sphere.
I'm glad I had the chance to talk to
Peter because I'm conscious of the fact
that aspects of my Mom are slowly
creeping into the person I've become
(someone slap me, however, if I start
wearing nothing but khakis, white
Oxfords, and seasonal vests).
I find myself taking so many factors
into consideration as 1 grow older —
how will this affect me in the future, in
my career, or in my lifestyle? 112 low will it
reflect on my friends and family?
But I would also like to try and revive
that fiesh excitement about the issues
that 1 cherished back in the day. Back in
the day, when I was young — I'm not a
kid anymore, but sometimes I sit and
wish 1 was a kid again . . . Sorry,
couldn't help it.
