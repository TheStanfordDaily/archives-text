Senior University Counsel responds
to discrimination complaints

On Feb. 22, I lie Daily printed a letter
to Stanford's Board of Trustees from
three women identified as having filed
discrimination complaints with the
Department of Labor. The letter paints
an inaccurate picture of the progress the
University has made in its ongoing
efforts to diversify its faculty.
Former Provost Condoleezza Rice
pointed out the following facts in a pre
sentation she made to the Faculty Senate
last spring:
1) Over the past ten years, Stanford
has more than doubled both the number
of women and the number of minority
group members on the faculty.
2) Women and men are promoted to
tenure at Stanford at the same rate.
:J) Male and female faculty at Stanford
receive comparable salaries.
4) Women are increasingly moving
into key academic leadership positions
around the University; during the
19905, the number of women depart
ment chairs increased from two to 13,
three of the last seven chairs of the Fac
ulty Senate have been women, the Uni
versity has had a woman provost and
now Stanford has its first woman dean.
5) Using the Department of Labor's
own anaivtical method, the number of

women faculty at Stanford compares
favorably to the composition of the
national "pools" from which such faculty
are drawn.
Thus, although the University should
by no means be complacent, the claims
of the letter that there is "widespread
gender and race discrimination in the
University's hiring, retention and pro
motion" of faculty, and that there are
"extensive violations of Federal equal
opportunity laws," have no basis in fact.
The allegation in the letter that there
has been a "steadfast refusal of the Uni
versity's leaders to address the problem
of discrimination or, remarkably, even
to acknowledge its existence," is particu
larly off-base.
President Casper and former Provost
Rice have been strong supporters of
affirmative action and equal opportuni
ty. In the arena of student admissions,
for example, President Casper in 1995
took a position of national leadership in
his support of affirmative action in the
face of Proposition 209.
Similarly, former Provost Rice has
been a vigorous advocate of Stanford's
affirmative action guidelines, which
require every faculty search to include
aggressive outreach to and identification
of women and minority candidates.
She has actively promoted the use of
the University's innovative Faculty

Incentive Fund, which provided over $5
million during her tenure as provost to
hire women and minority faculty mem
bers. She also initiated a University-wide
study of faculty salaries to search out and
correct any gender disparities.
What President Casper and former
Provost Rice have been unwilling to do,
however, is to cross the line from affir
mative action and equal opportunity, on
the one hand, to reverse discrimination
on the other. Although the legal status of
affirmative action is the subject of con
siderable controversy in the courts
today, there are certain legal principles
that are clear.
One is that it would be illegal for
Stanford to use quotas in its faculty hir
ing. It would be similarly illegal for Stan
ford to depart from its longstanding pol
icy and begin to apply different stan
dards for promotion to tenure based 011
the race or gender of the candidates. It
is this principled stand that the letter
mischaracterizes by stating that former-
Provost Rice "supports equal opportuni
ty in hiring but not promotions."
No one denies that there are difficult
issues regarding gender and race that
Stanford — like most American institu
tions — must grapple with. We are con
fident, however, that an objective review
of the facts will result in a determination
that Stanford has been responsible in its
commitment to diversity and equal
opportunity.

Alondra residents appeal for action at
Florence Moore Hall crosswalk
We are writing in regards to the slew
of bicycle accidents that have occurred at
the intersection of Mayfield Avenue in
front of Alondra at East Florence Moore
Hall.
The impotency of the Stanford
Administration in addressing this issue
has culminated in yet another East Flo
Mo resident being struck by an automo
bile while crossing Mayfield. Ironically, a
Stanford sheriff struck Kwadwo Ofuso-
Barko, an Alondra resident, on Feb. 24
around 8 p.m., causing him serious

physical injury.
This incident was the second in one
month involving an Alondra resident
being struck by a car. Numerous other
East Flo Mo residents have also been
struck and injured, not to mention
do/ens of unreported near-incidents
with inattentive drivers as well. How
many students must be injured before
the administration will stop passing the
buck and finally attempt to rectify the
situation?
In the past weeks, two influential
members of the Stanford community
have seriously injured two Alondra resi
dents: the assistant clean of students and
a Stanford sheriff. Both are people in
leadership positions with the explicitly
articulated responsibility to enforce reg
ulations regarding student safety, yet
they have failed to meet these standards
themselves.
In addition, while both the assistant
dean of students and the sheriff have
demonstrated strict enforcement of alco
hol policy and party regulation in the
name of student safety, they have both
contributed to an even greater demon
strated problem, namely the serious
danger posed by inadequate crossing

safety on Mayiield Avenue.
Student safety crossing the street out
side their homes should be just as impor
tant as their safety at parties, yet the
administration fails to realize this or,
worse, it simply chooses to ignore it.
The administration must realize that
a traffic signal is the most effective and
consistent sale* solution to the problem.
Currently, a pair of stop signs, obscure
in visibility, are the only protection
guarding the many bikers and pedestri
ans that frequent the intersection.
Granted, bicyclists often move too
quickly across the street, but, in all the
reported accidents this year, the bicy
clists were moving slowly and the
responsibility and fault of the accident
derived from lack of attention or visibili
ty by the drivers.
This serious problem further affects
the entire Stanford community with the
addition of the new post office on Levin
field adjacent to Flo Mo, wherein hun
dreds more people cross the street daily
under hazardous conditions.
The remedy for this problem is quite
simple, but the administration seems to
be in no hurry to make the streets safer
for its students. If their rationale for not

placing a traffic signal is due to the cost,
I implore them to do some simple math.
What is more expensive, $250,000 for a
new traffic signal or the $1 million law
suit that will result sooner or later from
the obvious danger of the intersection.
In a similar fashion, if the administra
tion believes that a traffic signal would
be an eyesore (a sentiment expressed by
some campus leaders), I can assure them
that the student body values its safety
above superficial image in a small section
of the campus. Are bodies littering the
ground more attractive than a simple
safety precaution?
The East Flo Mo staff has exerted
enormous effort to collaborate with Uni
versity administration on finding a solu
tion to the Mayfield Avenue problem.
However, so far, their efforts have been
met with little response and slow, reluc
tant action or absolute lack thereof. How
much more will it take before this seri
ous student safety issue is remedied?
This letter is an appeal to the Stan
lord administration pleading for help in
solving this problem. Five serious
impacts in five months, plus numerous
other near-accidents, is far too many.
The crossing outside Alondra poses a

m
m *
serious safety risk to all
ford, and it is past time tor actieivto be
taken on behalf of students'
hold the administration accountable to
hear and answer our concern. V
