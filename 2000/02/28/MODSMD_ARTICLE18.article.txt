Senior University Counsel responds
to discrimination complaints

On Feb. 22, I lie Daily printed a letter
to Stanford's Board of Trustees from
three women identified as having filed
discrimination complaints with the
Department of Labor. The letter paints
an inaccurate picture of the progress the
University has made in its ongoing
efforts to diversify its faculty.
Former Provost Condoleezza Rice
pointed out the following facts in a pre
sentation she made to the Faculty Senate
last spring:
1) Over the past ten years, Stanford
has more than doubled both the number
of women and the number of minority
group members on the faculty.
2) Women and men are promoted to
tenure at Stanford at the same rate.
:J) Male and female faculty at Stanford
receive comparable salaries.
4) Women are increasingly moving
into key academic leadership positions
around the University; during the
19905, the number of women depart
ment chairs increased from two to 13,
three of the last seven chairs of the Fac
ulty Senate have been women, the Uni
versity has had a woman provost and
now Stanford has its first woman dean.
5) Using the Department of Labor's
own anaivtical method, the number of

women faculty at Stanford compares
favorably to the composition of the
national "pools" from which such faculty
are drawn.
Thus, although the University should
by no means be complacent, the claims
of the letter that there is "widespread
gender and race discrimination in the
University's hiring, retention and pro
motion" of faculty, and that there are
"extensive violations of Federal equal
opportunity laws," have no basis in fact.
The allegation in the letter that there
has been a "steadfast refusal of the Uni
versity's leaders to address the problem
of discrimination or, remarkably, even
to acknowledge its existence," is particu
larly off-base.
President Casper and former Provost
Rice have been strong supporters of
affirmative action and equal opportuni
ty. In the arena of student admissions,
for example, President Casper in 1995
took a position of national leadership in
his support of affirmative action in the
face of Proposition 209.
Similarly, former Provost Rice has
been a vigorous advocate of Stanford's
affirmative action guidelines, which
require every faculty search to include
aggressive outreach to and identification
of women and minority candidates.
She has actively promoted the use of
the University's innovative Faculty

Incentive Fund, which provided over $5
million during her tenure as provost to
hire women and minority faculty mem
bers. She also initiated a University-wide
study of faculty salaries to search out and
correct any gender disparities.
What President Casper and former
Provost Rice have been unwilling to do,
however, is to cross the line from affir
mative action and equal opportunity, on
the one hand, to reverse discrimination
on the other. Although the legal status of
affirmative action is the subject of con
siderable controversy in the courts
today, there are certain legal principles
that are clear.
One is that it would be illegal for
Stanford to use quotas in its faculty hir
ing. It would be similarly illegal for Stan
ford to depart from its longstanding pol
icy and begin to apply different stan
dards for promotion to tenure based 011
the race or gender of the candidates. It
is this principled stand that the letter
mischaracterizes by stating that former-
Provost Rice "supports equal opportuni
ty in hiring but not promotions."
No one denies that there are difficult
issues regarding gender and race that
Stanford — like most American institu
tions — must grapple with. We are con
fident, however, that an objective review
