I hink the Sixth Man Club is passionate about bas
ketball? Try attending a cricket match in India.
Visiting Anthropology professor Kamachandra
Gulia, will give a lecture entitled "Cricket: South Asia's
True Religion," at 8 p.m. tomorrow in Room 2 of Lane
History Corner.
The lecture, the second in a quarterly series spon
sored by the Stanford South Asia Initiative, repre
sents the group's effort to increase campus awareness
about political, social and economic issues in South
Asia. This past fall, South Asian author Amitav Ghosh
gave the inaugural talk in the series.
Gulia's talk will focus on the societal effects and
politics of cricket in South Asia, where the sport has
the power to evoke profound and passionate reac
tions from its spectators.
In commenting on the importance of cricket in
South Asian countries such as India, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka, freshman and New Delhi native Ramesh lial
akrishnan said that the sport "captures the people's
minds, souls. It's a frenzy. Daily activities come to a
stop when cricket matches are on. Everyone is glued
totheT.V. ... It's a religion."
Linda Hess, a faculty organizer of the South Asia
Initiative, also emphasized the importance of the
sport in South Asia. "Like any massively popular team

sport, cricket is full of sociological, political, economic
and psychological significance. These are compound
ed in the case of Indian cricket because of its British,
imperial and nationalist associations."
She called Gulia a "very dynamic speaker" and
praised him as "oneof India's most versatile, interest
ing and impressive intellectuals."
Since obtaining a bachelor's and master's degree in
economics and a doctoral degre in Sociology, (luha
has served as a United Nations consultant in technol
ogy transfer, taught al Vale University, the Indian In
stitute of Science and UC-Berkeley. He has also au
thored numerous books and articles on various sub
jects, including the environment in India and the
sport of cricket.
He currently writes two popular newspaper
columns in India which reflect bis varied interests,
one on cricket and another 011 politics and culture.
(Juha's most recent book profiled Verrier Klwin.a
scholar of tribal cultures in India and advisor to for
mer Indian Prime Minister |awaharlal Nehru.
(>uha is perhaps most renowned, however, for bis
work on South Asian ecological issues. Mis publica
tions on the subject, which include the books " The
Unquiet Woods" and "This Fissured Land," are con
sidered pioneering studies in South Asian environ
mental history.
(Julia was invited by Stanford to teach two courses
011 ecological and social issues in South Asia lor the
Anthropological Department of Sciences this quar
ter.
After winter quarter, (luha will return to his home
