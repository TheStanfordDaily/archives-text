# Post office begins audit
## District manager says no external, criminal investigation in works 
### MARISA PAVLIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Palo Alto postmaster Masa Sato
has begun an internal investiga
tion of the Stanford post office, ac -
cording to Robert Reed, acting
manager of post of 112 ice operations
for the San Francisco region. .
It is unlikely that the Office of
the Inspector General will con
duct an external audit, according
to Horace llinshaw, a postal ser
vice spokesman. "There's no evi
dence of wrongdoing," he said.
"There's no pattern of losses or
complaints."
However, at the Feb. 15 forum,
held to discuss the quality of ser
vice at the post office, Reed
promised the launch of an exter
nal criminal investigation.
"There is no evidence of a Hood
of responses to incidents," llin
shaw added. "There have been
some managerial concerns about
procedure that needs to be cor
rected. Once it's corrected, stu
dents will see improvements."
"If there was evidence, we'd be
the first ones to say, 'I ley, we need
inspector services,' but there's no
pattern," he said. "There's no evi
dence of serious crimes, like em
bezzling or mail theft."

At the Feb. 15 thrum, students
complained about slow mail deliv
ery, long lines and a lack of cour
tesy Irom post office employees.
Ty Clevenger, a second-year
law student who has been an out
spoken critic of the Stanford post
of lice, responded to Hinshaw's
denial of major problems by say
ing, "That is absolutely dead
wrong. There is no question that a
large volume of mail is missing."
Reed said several changes have
been made in response to the
forum, which was organized by
the ASSU. Changes include in
stalling a drainage system, mak
ing all parcel lockers operational
and having Sato visit the tempo
rary site on Levin Field to talk to
students.
Reed said he notified both the
OKI and the I.S. Postal Service
Inspection Service and "[ap
prised] them of the issues." At the
forum he said he would do so.
fhe ()IC i, which is indepen
dent of postal management, was
created by the House of Repre
sentatives in 1993 to investigate
and evaluate postal serv ice opera
tions to ensure efficiency and in
tegrity.
Students at the forum ex
pressed concerns about the ability
of the post office to investigate it
self.
Describing the internal audit
process, Sato said, "We address
concerns and look at operations,
such as waiting in line and how
panels arc handed out — all con
cerns ill.u students brought up."
He also said "we don't interview
employees" during the audit.
Reed s;iid the post office will be
"doing internal testing, sending
letters and parcels through the
mail and monitoring the timelines
of delivery. We're sending letters
to old ,ind new addresses."
Sato did not give a timeline for
the investigation. Reed said lie wjll
follow through to"( heck il the ser
vice is at the (jualitx level students
expect."
"Based on a significant rc
sponsofroin | postal officials to the
forum|, I'm cautiouslv optimistic
that this is a of hope," said
(lln is ( In isiollct son, associate
vice president for facilities ;uid I he

provost's office liaison between
Stanford and the post office.
At the forum, one student
brought up an accusation of sexual
harassment by a postal employee.
"We're doing that investigation
internally," Reed said. "We take
this extremely seriously. It's not
tolerated at all."
" The student has to come for
ward and give information," I lin
shaw said, adding that neither he
nor Reed nor Sato knew the name
of the alleged victim.
"The bottom line is we want to
work with students," 1 linshaw said.
"We're taking a pro-active response
with monitoring and improving
the service so students will be
happy. Once we move to the new
facility, every*>ne w ill be happy."
"Masa's been out there every
day," I linshaw said. "Students
know him very well and are not
hesitant to talk to him. I le's been
ver\ visible. Students have told
(lb lis that service has improved."

Postal officials also plan to form
an advising council made up of
students and coordinated with
(Ihristoflerson.
" I lie advising council will get
ongoing information back and
forth," Hinshaw said. "The key is
sharing as much information as
we possibly can."
If students need to report mail
loss or rifling, Reed urged them to
use tht' Postal Service Form 1510,
available at all post offices. Copies
of the complaint are sent to the re
gional chief inspector and, if nec
essary, the claims and inquiry sec
tion of the postal service.
Reed emphasized that the post
office investigates ;ill complaints
I tied using the forms.
(ihristoilerson also urged "any
one with specific problems" to
contact him directly. He said he
would make sure complaints are
lot warded to the proper authori
ties, asking "if the people com
plaining can be as specific as possi

ble about what's missing, what's
sent, and to include their P.O. box
numbers."
Hinshaw said that he was at the
post office in Levin Field recently.
"It seemed very good, very effi
cient," he said. "There's always
room for improvement, but we're
monitoring customer complains
at the 1-800 number and Masa's
office is following up."
"Students will work with us,"
he added. "We're listening. We've
heard their voices." Concerning
the efforts spearheaded by Cle
venger to bring a competitor on
campus, Hinshaw said, "I'm not
goitig to address that."
Although students have been
unhappy with the post office for
years, Reecl said, "I can't account
for fifteen years. Many of us
haven't been here."

the first ones to say, 'I ley, we need
inspector services,' but there's no
pattern," he said. "There's no evi
dence of serious crimes, like em
bezzling or mail theft."

At the Feb. 15 thrum, students
complained about slow mail deliv
ery, long lines and a lack of cour
tesy Irom post office employees.
Ty Clevenger, a second-year
law student who has been an out
spoken critic of the Stanford post
of lice, responded to Hinshaw's
denial of major problems by say
ing, "That is absolutely dead
wrong. There is no question that a
large volume of mail is missing."
Reed said several changes have
been made in response to the
forum, which was organized by
the ASSU. Changes include in
stalling a drainage system, mak
ing all parcel lockers operational
and having Sato visit the tempo
rary site on Levin Field to talk to
students.
Reed said he notified both the
OKI and the I.S. Postal Service
Inspection Service and "[ap
prised] them of the issues." At the
forum he said he would do so.
fhe ()IC i, which is indepen
dent of postal management, was
created by the House of Repre
sentatives in 1993 to investigate
and evaluate postal serv ice opera
tions to ensure efficiency and in
tegrity.
Students at the forum ex
pressed concerns about the ability
of the post office to investigate it
self.
Describing the internal audit
process, Sato said, "We address
concerns and look at operations,
such as waiting in line and how
panels arc handed out — all con
cerns ill.u students brought up."
He also said "we don't interview
employees" during the audit.
Reed s;iid the post office will be
"doing internal testing, sending
letters and parcels through the
mail and monitoring the timelines
of delivery. We're sending letters
to old ,ind new addresses."
Sato did not give a timeline for
the investigation. Reed said lie wjll
follow through to"( heck il the ser
vice is at the (jualitx level students
expect."
"Based on a significant rc
sponsofroin | postal officials to the
forum|, I'm cautiouslv optimistic
that this is a of hope," said
(lln is ( In isiollct son, associate
vice president for facilities ;uid I he

provost's office liaison between
Stanford and the post office.
At the forum, one student
brought up an accusation of sexual
harassment by a postal employee.
"We're doing that investigation
internally," Reed said. "We take
this extremely seriously. It's not
tolerated at all."
" The student has to come for
ward and give information," I lin
shaw said, adding that neither he
nor Reed nor Sato knew the name
of the alleged victim.
"The bottom line is we want to
work with students," 1 linshaw said.
"We're taking a pro-active response
with monitoring and improving
the service so students will be
happy. Once we move to the new
facility, every*>ne w ill be happy."
"Masa's been out there every
day," I linshaw said. "Students
know him very well and are not
hesitant to talk to him. I le's been
ver\ visible. Students have told
(lb lis that service has improved."

Postal officials also plan to form
an advising council made up of
students and coordinated with
(Ihristoflerson.
" I lie advising council will get
ongoing information back and
forth," Hinshaw said. "The key is
sharing as much information as
we possibly can."
If students need to report mail
loss or rifling, Reed urged them to
use tht' Postal Service Form 1510,
available at all post offices. Copies
of the complaint are sent to the re
gional chief inspector and, if nec
essary, the claims and inquiry sec
tion of the postal service.
Reed emphasized that the post
office investigates ;ill complaints
I tied using the forms.
(ihristoilerson also urged "any
one with specific problems" to
contact him directly. He said he
would make sure complaints are
lot warded to the proper authori
ties, asking "if the people com
plaining can be as specific as possi

ble about what's missing, what's
sent, and to include their P.O. box
numbers."
Hinshaw said that he was at the
post office in Levin Field recently.
"It seemed very good, very effi
cient," he said. "There's always
room for improvement, but we're
monitoring customer complains
at the 1-800 number and Masa's
office is following up."
"Students will work with us,"
he added. "We're listening. We've
heard their voices." Concerning
the efforts spearheaded by Cle
venger to bring a competitor on
campus, Hinshaw said, "I'm not
goitig to address that."
Although students have been
unhappy with the post office for
years, Reecl said, "I can't account
for fifteen years. Many of us
haven't been here."
