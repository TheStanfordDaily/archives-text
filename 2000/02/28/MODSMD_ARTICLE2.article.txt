# Post office begins audit
## District manager says no external, criminal investigation in works 
### MARISA PAVLIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Palo Alto postmaster Masa Sato
has begun an internal investiga
tion of the Stanford post office, ac -
cording to Robert Reed, acting
manager of post of 112 ice operations
for the San Francisco region. .
It is unlikely that the Office of
the Inspector General will con
duct an external audit, according
to Horace llinshaw, a postal ser
vice spokesman. "There's no evi
dence of wrongdoing," he said.
"There's no pattern of losses or
complaints."
However, at the Feb. 15 forum,
held to discuss the quality of ser
vice at the post office, Reed
promised the launch of an exter
nal criminal investigation.
"There is no evidence of a Hood
of responses to incidents," llin
shaw added. "There have been
some managerial concerns about
procedure that needs to be cor
rected. Once it's corrected, stu
dents will see improvements."
"If there was evidence, we'd be
the first ones to say, 'I ley, we need
inspector services,' but there's no
pattern," he said. "There's no evi
dence of serious crimes, like em
bezzling or mail theft."

At the Feb. 15 thrum, students
complained about slow mail deliv
ery, long lines and a lack of cour
tesy Irom post office employees.
Ty Clevenger, a second-year
law student who has been an out
spoken critic of the Stanford post
of lice, responded to Hinshaw's
denial of major problems by say
ing, "That is absolutely dead
wrong. There is no question that a
large volume of mail is missing."
Reed said several changes have
been made in response to the
forum, which was organized by
the ASSU. Changes include in
stalling a drainage system, mak
ing all parcel lockers operational
and having Sato visit the tempo
rary site on Levin Field to talk to
students.
Reed said he notified both the
OKI and the I.S. Postal Service
Inspection Service and "[ap
prised] them of the issues." At the
forum he said he would do so.
fhe ()IC i, which is indepen
dent of postal management, was
created by the House of Repre
sentatives in 1993 to investigate
and evaluate postal serv ice opera
tions to ensure efficiency and in
tegrity.
Students at the forum ex
pressed concerns about the ability
of the post office to investigate it
self.
Describing the internal audit
process, Sato said, "We address
