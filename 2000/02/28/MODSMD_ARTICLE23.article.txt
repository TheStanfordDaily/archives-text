Senior Larissa Fontaine will
finish her gymnastics career in
April leaving Stanford as the
most accomplished gymnast in
school history. But few on cam
pus know her as anything other
than a normal student.
"Larissa is one of the most j

modest people I know. She's an
incredible athlete, and nobody

knows it," said roommate and for
mer teammate Ann I hananopavarn.

Fontaine has the unique combina
tion of incredible talent, a fiery compet
itiveness and a remarkable work ethic.

"It's like coaching Michael Jordan.'" said as-

sistant coach Wayne Wright, who coat lies ihe (Chicago native.
Fontaine came to Stanford after deferring a vear to train lor the
Olympics with an established name in the spoil — there is even a
skill named after her — and impressive credentials: a ten-time I .S.
National Team Member, a two-lime World Championships I cam
Member and a 1 99f> Olympic I rials participant.
Yet, she hasn't rested on her laurels at Sianlord - she's been 100
busy setting records. In 1998, Fontaine, onl\ a sophomore, became
the first gymnast in Stanford histon to win a National Champi
onship title. Her vault win was also the first time in NCAA histon
that an individual qualifier to Nationals has won a title.


Senior Larissa
Fontaine leads the
Cardinal with an
incredible blend of
style, intelligence
and athleticism
Last year, slit* was sidelined For
most of the season with a severely
broken finger that required
surgery to repair. While doctors
told her that her season was over,
Fontaine fought back to compete
in three events iti the postseason
for the Cardinal. Alter only a lew
weeks of training, she finished
third in the vault at Nationals.
Her senior year looks to be the
best ever for Fontaine. She is the
healthiest she has been in years
and doing the best gymnastics ol
her collegiate career.
Earlier this year, she received
her first 'perfect 10,' becoming
only the fourth gymnast in school
history to score a 10. In the same
meet, she recorded the highest
all-around total in the NCAA this
year — a 39.825 — which shat
tered the Stanford record.
The team is having a great deal
of success as well. With Fontaine
at the helm, it is currently ranked
eighth in the nation — its highest
ranking in school history.
"Larissa's determination to
succeed is carrying over to the
team," said assistant coach Rene
Lyst Cook. "She is the definite
leader of the team, leading both
by example and verbally."
"I wouldn't trade this year for
the world. I look forward to going
in the gym every day because of
who I get to spend time with,"
said Fontaine.
Fontaine is currently ranked
third nationally in the all-around,
fifth on vault, and fifth on bars.
Making her rankings all the
more impressive is the fact that
chronic elbow injuries, including
three surgeries, were supposed to
keep her out of the bar lineup and
the all-around this year. Coaches
thought that if they kept the inter
nationally-renowned bar worker
off the event for the year, her
elbow would be less painful, and
she would be able to contribute
more on other events. Larissa,
however, had other ideas.
"I approached the coaches
during Christmas break and
asked to try bars for a week and
see how my elbow felt. I really
missed bars - it's my favorite event
— and I thought I could help the
team," said Fontaine.
Within a few weeks, the senior
was able to complete full bar rou
tines, an amazing feat considering

she had not trained bars for over a
year.
"For me, that is the true spirit
of sports — to push beyond your
known limits and succeed. That's
Larissa in a nutshell," said sopho
more teammate Katy Herbert.
Fontaine's feats also carry her
outside of the gym. The senior is
a Mechanical Engineering and
English double major who is
planning on co-terming next year
in Mechanical Engineering.
She is also extensively involved
in the elite gymnastics communi
ty, serving as an Athlete Repre
sentative for USA Gymnastics, a
role which allows her to use her
knowledge and experience to
bring the issues and concerns of
athletes to the national governing
body for gymnastics.
"Gymnastics is an intrinsic
part of my life — it carries into
everything I do. 1 will have to
find a new direction for my en
ergy after this year, but gymnas
tics will always be part of who I
am," said Fontaine.
Fontaine had a very different
childhood and high school expe
rience than most students, mov
ing away from home two different
times to train with some of the best
coaches in the nation. However,
during her collegiate years she
has been able to experience a
more normal life and have friends
outside the gymnastics world.
"Larissa is such a well-rounded
person. She's a very loyal friend,"
said Thananopavarn.
"Larissa is the most amazing
person I have ever met," says
close friend and former team
mate Amy Murakami. "Things
are coming together really well
for her this year - it's like a fairy
tale. I'm happy she's enjoying it
so much."
For Fontaine, the fairy tale
would be complete if the team
qualifies to "Super Six", the team
finals of the NCAA national
championships.
"It's something Stanford has
never done before. I'd love to be
a part of a team that does it for
the first time - it would be very
fulfilling," said Fontaine. "But
the program is building. If we
don't do it this year, they'll do it
next year."
The team will have a difficult
job filling Larissa's shoes next
year. "It will be a big void not hav
ing her next year," said Lyst
Cook. "We'll probably cry with
out her."
