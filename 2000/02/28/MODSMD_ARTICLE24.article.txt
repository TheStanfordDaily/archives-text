Sager had the no-hitter going
until the top of the seventh, when
Gal's tommy Clallen doubled to
left field to give the Golden Beat s
their lone hit for the game.
Gosling relieved Sager in the sev
enth after Sager had loaded the
bases by hitting Nady and catcher
Mike I onis, and added three hit
less innings ol his own to get his

second save of the year.
"I felt comfortable on the
mound today and concentrated
on my tempo," said Sager. "My
goal was to have the same ap
proach on every pitch. I was able
to get ahead in the count a lot and
make good pitches when I was
ahead."
Senior shortstop Eric Bruntlett
and senior catcher Damien Al
varado blasted solo homers in the
fourth inning to provide the of
fense for the Cardinal.
"We had a good pitching job
today from both Cosling and
Sager," Marquess said. If you
only give up one hit, you should
win. We've had pretty good pitch
ing and defense all season com
bined with a bit of timely hitting,
I hat is the way we have one most
of Our games."
Finally, on Sunday afternoon,
Stanford finished the Golden
Bears off with a convincing 8-2
win, with freshman Tim Cunning

legiate victory.
I his time, Cal actually got the
jump on the Cardinal, taking their
first lead of the entire series when
I onis smacked an RBI double off
of Cunningham in the bottom of
the litst. After Stanford added a
run in the top of the second, the
Card got two more in the third
when senior third baseman John
(>all hit a ball that landed just in
front of Cal left fielder Brent
Cook, bringing home second
baseman Andy Topham and
I honipson. Cal added another
run on a balk by Cunningham,
and then Stanford completely
took over.
Bore'hard led off the fourth
with his second home run of the
year, and later the Card added
four more in the top of the sixth
on a pair of RBI singles, an RBI
walk and an RBI hit-by-pitch by
