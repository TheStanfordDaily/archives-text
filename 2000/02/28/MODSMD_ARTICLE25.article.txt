### BILL HANSON STAFF WRITER 
At No. 2, California currently trails
top-ranked Stanford by only a lew
points in the Intercollegiate Tennis As
sociation's national team rankings.
()n the court, hoxvexer, the two teams
are separated bx ;i much greater inar
gin.
()n Saturday, the (Cardinal (I 1-0, 7-0
Pacific 10 Conference) swept the Bears
(f>-3, 4-2) for the second time in as inaux
weeks.
A week ago, the (Cardinal crushed the
Bears, K-0, to take the title at the
I I A I SI A National Collegiate Indoor
Championships at the L'nixersitx <>l
Wisconsin in Madison, W is.
I his time, the Cardinal was just as
brutal, taking all six singles mate lies be
fore the doubles were canceled due to
rain.
" I he girls were motivated," said
head coach Frank Brennan. "()I course,
we always pick it up for Berkeley. Any
time you can win every match, you feel
great. It's nice not to haxe to console
anyone."
I lie weather conditions for Satur
day's match were not ideal. Wind

wreaked havoc upon main players'con
sistent and timing.
Nonetheless, Stanford focused on
the task .it hand, as each player on the
(Cardinal scjtiad took her match in
straight sets.
" 1 lie conditions were tough," Bren
nan said. "It was cold and nasty. It was
very windv. For a while there. I didn't
think we would make it through the sin
gles."
Sophomore Marissa Irvin, who last
season reached the final of the NGAA
Individual tournament and concluded
her 112 reshman campaign ranked second
in the nation, routed Cal's Amy Jensen
in the No. 1 singles match, 6-1, 6-2.
Irvin has been infallible this season,
amassing a perfect 9-0 singles record.
Despite her record, she has yet to partic
ipate in enough dual matt lies to qualify
for a collegiate ranking.
In lieu of collegiate competition,
Irvin has participated in professional
tournaments over the past several
months. At No. 99, she is currently the
highest-ranked amateur on the
Women's Tennis Association Tour
Freshman Laura Granville was
equally dominant at No. 2 singles, cruis
ing past (lid's (ilaire (lurran, 6-2, 6-2.

"Granville is the best freshman in the
country," Brennan said. "She's just tak
ing very good players apart. I never
have to worry about her as a coach. She
never lets up."
Granville, who won the prestigious
Rolex National Intercollegiate Indoor
(Championships, the third leg of the col
legiate Grand Slain, in early February,
has launched a freshman campaign
reminiscent of Irvin's precocious debut
one year ago.
At No. 2, she is currently the nation's
highest-ranked freshman. She boasts a
2N-2 singles record.
Senior captain 1 eryn Ashley, on the
other hand, sports a far less impressive
season record.
Ashley, w ho has been ranked as high
as fourth in the nation, has been strug
gling with erratic play this season while
recovering from persistent tendinitis in
her wrist.
()n Saturday, however, she was back
in fine form, dismantling Cal's Karoline
Borgerson, 6-4,6-1, at No. 3.
"She's performing when we really
need her," Brennan said. "It's wonder
ful to liax e our senior captain playing so
well."
In fact, every member of the Cardi

nal squad seems to be on top of her
game.
Sophomores Lauren Kalvaria and
Gabriela Lastra posted easy wins at the
No. 4 and ~> singles positions, respective
ly.
Kalvaria, ranked a career-high sixth
in the nation after notching several
breakthrough wins over the past few
months, upended Gal's Lisa Swierniak,
6-3,6-2.
Lastra, who has won her last twelve
singles matches, double-bageled a frus
trated Morisa Yang.
Senior Jennifer Heiser was given the
toughest test of the afternoon at No. 6
singles, eventually prevailing, 7-6 (7-1),
6-2, over Cal's Christina Fusano.
Once Stanford secured victory,
Brennan admitted that he was
pleased by his squad s performance.
"We definitely know we're the No. 1
team in the country," Brennan said.
"I'm just not sure Cal's the No. 2 team.
After all, Florida's been injured, and
Georgia was very tough last week in
Madison."
For the time being, the Cardinal can
revel in its dominance. Stanford has
won its last 31 matches, with its last loss
coming to Gal a little over a year ago.
