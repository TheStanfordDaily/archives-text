# Card leashes Huskies, 77-52

### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
SEATTLE â€” Asot last week, No. 1 Stanford led the
nation in margin of victory, winning percentage and
opponents' field goal percentage. The Cardinal, 22-1
at the time, was beating its opponents by an average of
more than 21 points per game while holding them to
34 percent shooting.
This weekend didn't do anything to hurt those im
pressively gaudy statistics.
After beating up Washington State 89-52 Thursday
night, Stanford went right after Washington in Seattle
Saturday, bringing home another regular, old, 77-52
win.
But as opposed to Stanford's recent 26, 51 and 37-
point victories, this one felt different. Even though
Washington was never within single digits after the
first five minutes, the game almost had a feeling of ur
gency.
"That felt like a close game," said senior guard
David Moseley, who finished with 13 points. "When
they got it down to 11, it almost felt like a two or three
point game. We didn't want to let them get under dou
ble digits."
Stanford, now 24-1, 13-1 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence and a perfect 8-0 on the road, was facing the sec
ond-worst team in the conference whose starting point
guard, sophomore Senque Carey, played only six
minutes because of foul trouble and injury.
But still, when an 11-point lead feels constricting, a
team is doing pretty well. So well that Stanford itself

sometimes has d ouble drawing conclusions from its
play.
"Your perception's clouded when you're beating
guys by 20 or 30 points," Moseley said. "It's hard to tell
what you're doing wrong and what you're doing
right."
Any way you look at it, though, Mark Madsen, who
scored 16 points and pulled down a career-high 20 re
bounds against Washington, is doing a lot of tilings
right. In the last five games, the senior power forward
is averaging close to 18 points and 13 rebounds per
game.
Saturday, Madsen was in a zone. As Stanford
streaked to an early 17-2 lead, he would not be denied
a rebound. With just over three minutes gone, he al
ready had six boards.
While Madsen's intense, passionate play is expect
ed at Cardinal games, his performances of late have
still inspired awe from observers.
"Madsen's playing so well lately," said Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery. "It's great to see him
finishing off this well. He's playing about as well as
ever. That's good to see."
junior Jarron Collins also capitalized against Wash
ington's small and thin front line. Collins, who dis
played just a few of his many offensive skills, finished
with his sixth double-double of the year, scoring 12
points to go along with 12 rebounds.

Saturday, which should not keep him out of any fur-
