# Card leashes Huskies, 77-52
## 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
SEATTLE â€” Asot last week, No. 1 Stanford led the
nation in margin of victory, winning percentage and
opponents' field goal percentage. The Cardinal, 22-1
at the time, was beating its opponents by an average of
more than 21 points per game while holding them to
34 percent shooting.
This weekend didn't do anything to hurt those im
pressively gaudy statistics.
After beating up Washington State 89-52 Thursday
night, Stanford went right after Washington in Seattle
Saturday, bringing home another regular, old, 77-52
win.
But as opposed to Stanford's recent 26, 51 and 37-
point victories, this one felt different. Even though
Washington was never within single digits after the
first five minutes, the game almost had a feeling of ur
gency.
"That felt like a close game," said senior guard
David Moseley, who finished with 13 points. "When
they got it down to 11, it almost felt like a two or three
point game. We didn't want to let them get under dou
ble digits."
Stanford, now 24-1, 13-1 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence and a perfect 8-0 on the road, was facing the sec
ond-worst team in the conference whose starting point
guard, sophomore Senque Carey, played only six
minutes because of foul trouble and injury.
But still, when an 11-point lead feels constricting, a
team is doing pretty well. So well that Stanford itself

sometimes has d ouble drawing conclusions from its
play.
"Your perception's clouded when you're beating
guys by 20 or 30 points," Moseley said. "It's hard to tell
what you're doing wrong and what you're doing
right."
Any way you look at it, though, Mark Madsen, who
scored 16 points and pulled down a career-high 20 re
bounds against Washington, is doing a lot of tilings
right. In the last five games, the senior power forward
is averaging close to 18 points and 13 rebounds per
game.
Saturday, Madsen was in a zone. As Stanford
streaked to an early 17-2 lead, he would not be denied
a rebound. With just over three minutes gone, he al
ready had six boards.
While Madsen's intense, passionate play is expect
ed at Cardinal games, his performances of late have
still inspired awe from observers.
"Madsen's playing so well lately," said Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery. "It's great to see him
finishing off this well. He's playing about as well as
ever. That's good to see."
junior Jarron Collins also capitalized against Wash
ington's small and thin front line. Collins, who dis
played just a few of his many offensive skills, finished
with his sixth double-double of the year, scoring 12
points to go along with 12 rebounds.
His brother Jason, who suffered a mild ankle sprain
Saturday, which should not keep him out of any fur-
ther action, finished with seven
points in 10 minutes.
"Mark, Jason and I went into
the game knowing we could estab
lish positions and make shots and
take control," Jarron said. "We felt
they didn't have the players to stop
us."
Saturday it looked like the only
team that could stop Stanford was
draped in Cardinal red. Though
the team shot 46 percent for the
game, the Stanford offense was not
as consistently productive as it had
been in games past.

"Wo were struggling a bit, that's
going to happen in the [NCAA]
Tournament," Jarron said. "Hut
it's our defense that'll keep us in
games. Defense wins games fin us."
Saturday was no exception.
Washington opened the game I
for-9 from the field and finished
the first half shooting under 28
percent. Overall, the I fuskies shot
only 31.7 percent for the game.
"We were not as sharp on of
fense," Montgomery said. "The
ball wasn't moving quite as well as
we would want, some shots weren't
falling. Hut the thingthat kept us in
was our defense."
With USC and UCLA, both
good defensive teams, coming into
Maples, Stanford might actually

see a few competitive games before
its long-awaited March 9 throw
down wit 11 No. 3 Arizona in Tucson
and the season finale against Ari
zona State.
"I think we will have a lot of sit
uations in the next four games
where each shot means some
thing," Montgomery said.
I leading into the always-unpre
dictable NCAA Tournament,
which Montgomery likes to refer to
as the "third season," a close game
will be welcomed by Stanford.
Repeated 25-point victories do
little to steel a team for a close, lose
and-you're-out game with, for ex
ample, an upstart like Conzaga, a
team which beat second-seeded
Stanford on this verv same Key

Arena court a year ago.
Hut of course this Cardinal
team, which set a school record for
the best start in school history,
eclipsing the 193(>-37 squad's 23-1
opening, feels it's better to maxi
mize its potential than play down to
an opponent for the sake of com
petition.
"We just need to peak at the
right time, and we've been doing
that," Madsen said. "It gives us mo
mentum going into next week with
the 1..A. schools and beyond."
And beyond - a mammoth game
that will potentially decide the Pac
-10 championship and a month of
madness that will crown a single
National C Ihampion - is what it's all
about.
