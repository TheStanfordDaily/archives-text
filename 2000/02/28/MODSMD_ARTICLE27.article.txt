# Women rout Washington
## 
### MAUREEN MULLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal women's basketball team (18-6, 11-3
Pacific 10 Conference)ook revenge on Washington (7-
20, 3-12), trouncing them 76-46 at Maples Pavilion on
Saturday. Stanford has not held a team to fewer than
40 points since its 67-45 win against Texas Tech in the
second round of the NCAA tounnament back in 1997.
"We concentrated all week on our defense, and re
ally shutting them down." said junior forward Sarah
Dimson. "Our defense really came through for us this
game."
The win moves the Cardinal to a sole spot atop the
Pac-10 standings, after USC upset Oregon Saturday.
The Ducks (20-7, 1 1-4) are currently a half game be
hind Stanford. However, the conference race remains
tight and with two weeks remaining, Arizona, UCLA
and Oregon State also have a chance at the title.
The game remained close throughout the first half.
The Huskies held the Cardinal, which averages a na
tion-high 43.9 percent from three-point territory, to
only one for 10 from beyond the arc. Stanford got
some much-needed offensive and defensive firepower
from Dimson, who went 4-5 from the field for eight
points, and grabbed five rebounds before the break.

Sophomore guard Lauren St. Clair goes up for a lay-in
against Washington's Carli Halpenny.
The Huskies struggled as well.
Pac-1 0 scoring leader Megan Fran
za was held to just three points in
the first half for Washington.
Stanford went into the locker
room ahead 29-21.
However, if the Cardinal did
well in the first half, they shined in
the second half, as senior Milena
Flores erupted, giving Stanford
much of the intensity that seemed
to missing in the game.
She led the Cardinal on a 21-1
run midway through the second
half, putting Stanford up by 31.
Flores scored I 1 of her team-high
1 3 points alter the break, as she im
pressed thee rowd with her spec tac -
ular drives. She added a game-high
eight assists.
"We, especially, are so depen
dent on out point guard," said
head coach lata VanDerveer of
Flores. "I just said [to Mores] look at
all these people, show them what
you can do. 1 see it every day in
practice and Milena's been playing
really well with a lot of confidence."
"Milena Mores is a true point
guard," said Franza. "She runs
everything out there and is one of
the best leaders I've ever seen. Just
tier presence makes the team do
bettei when she is on the floor."
In addition to the heroics of Flo
res, Stanford got 12 points out of
freshman Jamie Carey on 3-for-6
three-point shooting before the
Cardinal guard was pulled out of
the game with a reaggravated high
left ankle sprain.
(larey got tangled up as she was
i uniting down the floor and left the
game with four minutes remaining
in obvious pain. Right now her sta
tus is questionable loi lliursday's
game.
"We were able to get a lot of peo
ple some real quality minutes," said
VanDerveer. "But unfortunately I
didn't get Jamie out fiist enough.
That was the one big negative of
this game."
Scoring was evenly distributed
throughout the Cardinal roster.

Complimenting Mores and Carey
were Dimson, also with 12 points,
and junior Carolyn Moos with nine.
Sophomore Lindsey Yamasaki
scored seven points and grabbed
five rebounds in just 13 minutes on
the floor.
However, it was the Cardinal de
fense t hat led the way. Washington
was held to a dismal 29.8 field goal
percentage.
Stanford out-rebounded Wash
ington 46-34. Dimson grabbed a
game-high nine rebounds for the
Cardinal, including five offensive
boards. Sophomore Enjoli Izidor
added six rebounds for Stanford.
Megan Franza led the Huskies
in scoring with 14 points, and team
mate Loree Payne chipped in nine.
T he Cardinal looks to stay atop
the Pac-10 with a road trip this
weekend, when they will meet No.

The Cardinal women's basketball team (18-6, 11-3
Pacific 10 Conference)ook revenge on Washington (7-
20, 3-12), trouncing them 76-46 at Maples Pavilion on
Saturday. Stanford has not held a team to fewer than
40 points since its 67-45 win against Texas Tech in the
second round of the NCAA tounnament back in 1997.
"We concentrated all week on our defense, and re
ally shutting them down." said junior forward Sarah
Dimson. "Our defense really came through for us this
game."
The win moves the Cardinal to a sole spot atop the
Pac-10 standings, after USC upset Oregon Saturday.
The Ducks (20-7, 1 1-4) are currently a half game be
hind Stanford. However, the conference race remains
tight and with two weeks remaining, Arizona, UCLA
and Oregon State also have a chance at the title.
The game remained close throughout the first half.
The Huskies held the Cardinal, which averages a na
tion-high 43.9 percent from three-point territory, to
only one for 10 from beyond the arc. Stanford got
some much-needed offensive and defensive firepower
from Dimson, who went 4-5 from the field for eight
points, and grabbed five rebounds before the break.

Sophomore guard Lauren St. Clair goes up for a lay-in
against Washington's Carli Halpenny.
The Huskies struggled as well.
Pac-1 0 scoring leader Megan Fran
za was held to just three points in
the first half for Washington.
Stanford went into the locker
room ahead 29-21.
However, if the Cardinal did
well in the first half, they shined in
the second half, as senior Milena
Flores erupted, giving Stanford
much of the intensity that seemed
to missing in the game.
She led the Cardinal on a 21-1
run midway through the second
half, putting Stanford up by 31.
Flores scored I 1 of her team-high
1 3 points alter the break, as she im
pressed thee rowd with her spec tac -
ular drives. She added a game-high
eight assists.
"We, especially, are so depen
dent on out point guard," said
head coach lata VanDerveer of
Flores. "I just said [to Mores] look at
all these people, show them what
you can do. 1 see it every day in
practice and Milena's been playing
really well with a lot of confidence."
"Milena Mores is a true point
guard," said Franza. "She runs
everything out there and is one of
the best leaders I've ever seen. Just
tier presence makes the team do
bettei when she is on the floor."
In addition to the heroics of Flo
res, Stanford got 12 points out of
freshman Jamie Carey on 3-for-6
three-point shooting before the
Cardinal guard was pulled out of
the game with a reaggravated high
left ankle sprain.
(larey got tangled up as she was
i uniting down the floor and left the
game with four minutes remaining
in obvious pain. Right now her sta
tus is questionable loi lliursday's
game.
"We were able to get a lot of peo
ple some real quality minutes," said
VanDerveer. "But unfortunately I
didn't get Jamie out fiist enough.
That was the one big negative of
this game."
Scoring was evenly distributed
throughout the Cardinal roster.

Complimenting Mores and Carey
were Dimson, also with 12 points,
and junior Carolyn Moos with nine.
Sophomore Lindsey Yamasaki
scored seven points and grabbed
five rebounds in just 13 minutes on
the floor.
However, it was the Cardinal de
fense t hat led the way. Washington
was held to a dismal 29.8 field goal
percentage.
Stanford out-rebounded Wash
ington 46-34. Dimson grabbed a
game-high nine rebounds for the
Cardinal, including five offensive
boards. Sophomore Enjoli Izidor
added six rebounds for Stanford.
Megan Franza led the Huskies
in scoring with 14 points, and team
mate Loree Payne chipped in nine.

the Pac-10 with a road trip this
