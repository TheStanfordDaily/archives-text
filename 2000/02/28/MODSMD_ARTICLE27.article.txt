The Cardinal women's basketball team (18-6, 11-3
Pacific 10 Conference)ook revenge on Washington (7-
20, 3-12), trouncing them 76-46 at Maples Pavilion on
Saturday. Stanford has not held a team to fewer than
40 points since its 67-45 win against Texas Tech in the
second round of the NCAA tounnament back in 1997.
"We concentrated all week on our defense, and re
ally shutting them down." said junior forward Sarah
Dimson. "Our defense really came through for us this
game."
The win moves the Cardinal to a sole spot atop the
Pac-10 standings, after USC upset Oregon Saturday.
The Ducks (20-7, 1 1-4) are currently a half game be
hind Stanford. However, the conference race remains
tight and with two weeks remaining, Arizona, UCLA
and Oregon State also have a chance at the title.
The game remained close throughout the first half.
The Huskies held the Cardinal, which averages a na
tion-high 43.9 percent from three-point territory, to
only one for 10 from beyond the arc. Stanford got
some much-needed offensive and defensive firepower
from Dimson, who went 4-5 from the field for eight
points, and grabbed five rebounds before the break.
