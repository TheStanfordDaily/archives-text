# Volleyball sails past Pacific at home
## 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
On Friday night the Stanford
men's volleyball team (7-7, 7-5
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) learned just how sweet re
venge can be.
In a 3-1 victory over Pacific (6-
10, 5-7), the Cardinal not only
avenged two heartbreaking 3-2
losses to the Tigers last year, but
also notched its third straight win
over a ranked team and slid itsell
into MPSF playoff contention as
fourth in the Pacific Division.
112 n its two matchups with Pacif
ic last season, Stanford built a
convincing 2-0 lead, only to fall 3-
2 both times. On Friday, the Car
dinal again jumped ahead 2-0,
but instead of surrendering
three, the squad dropped just
one game to the Tigers before se
curing the 15-10, 15-13, 11-15,
15-6 victory with a commanding
fourth game performance.
"The guys were disappointed
not to win in three, so they were
determined in game four to get it
done," head coach Ruben Nieves
said. "The returning players
knew that they had to buckle
down because this team has a his
tory of coming back against Stan
ford."
It was clear from the start of
game four that Stanford was not
going to let another playoff bid
slip away. Bloc ks by juniors Brett
Youngberg and Josh Lukens
helped Stanford jump to a quick
3-0 lead. I he Tigers managed six
points before Lukens served a
four-point run that left a Cardi
nal victory just two points out of
reach.
Point 14 was a complete team
eflort as Stanford battled Pacific
through a long, dramatic rally to
secure the point and set the team
up to serve for the match. The
Tigers survived through two
match points before Stanford
clinched the victory.
" The team's maturity is really
showing when it comes to big ral
lies," said Lukens, who finished
the night with 87 assists. "We're
winning a high percentage of
them, and it really boosts our con
fidence."
Effective passing combined
with determined diving and slid

ing efforts kept Stanford strong
in long rallies, like the one in
game four. Throw in Stanford's
solid serving night and successful
defensive performance to give
the Cardinal the edge on the
night.
Game one was tight until
freshman Kyle Strache served
three straight points for the Car
dinal, followed by a four point
streak served by freshman Billy
Strickland. Suddenly, Stanford
faced an 1 1-4 lead before closing
out the game 15-10.
An impressive blocking and
digging eflort by the Cardinal
helped sophomore Marcus Ska
cel serve Stanford to a quick 5-0
lead in game two.
"They made errors, and we
made blocks and digs," Nieves
said. "But Pacific came back and
did the exact same thing to us.
They served good balls and
blocked well, we made some hit
ting errors and the momentum
changed."
Pacific freshman Christopher
Tamas served a four-point run,
and Stanford went from 7-2 to 7-
9.
Strength off the bench in
Youngberg, junior Curtis Gra
ham and freshman Paul Bocage
helped Stanford finish the* game.
Bocage served out the coine
from-behind win, and Stanford
jumped from 10-13 to 15-13.
"With Curtis you know that
lie's going to bring enthusiasm
and positive energy, so when we
brought him in late in game two,
we thought the team could use
that. He had a real positive influ
ence," Nieves said. "Paul has the
physical ability to make things
happen with his hitting and
blocking. His serving was a real
nice bonus for us."
Stanford had trouble handling
a barrage of Pacific tips in game
three that left the Cardinal chas
ing Pacific 8-10. Not even impres
sive late-game efforts by Skacel
and Toppel could thwart the
Tigers, and the match was
pushed into a fourth game.
Unlike last year when Pacific's
powerhouse Vladimir Andric hit
his way to AVCA National Player
of the Week honors with 50 kills
against Stanford, the Cardinal
was able to contain the Tigers' kill

leader, holding liiin to a . 1 OH hit
ting percentage.
Meanwhile, Stanford utilized a
variety of its hitters as the squad
posted tour players in double dig
its for kills on the night.
Leading the way was loppel
who, with 39 kills, had the kind of
night that makes him the No. 1
hitter in the country. Skacel post
ed 14, while both Youngberg and
freshman Billy Strickland each
had 10 kills.
Serving was another factor
that made the difference for Stan
ford Friday night. While Pacific
outpaced Stanford 4-3, its 22 er

rors compared to Stanford's
seven gave the Cardinal a host of
easy side-outs while Stanford
forced Pacific to deal with one of
its strongest serving nights.
"Pacific was having a hard time
passing the ball," Lukens said,
"which allowed us to set up well
formed bloc ks and allowed us to
play great defense; we were dig
ging a lot of balls."
Stanford outdug Pacific 52-51
with libero Seth Ring, a redshirt
freshman, leading the squad with
13 digs despite a sprained ankle.
Skacel was second for the Cardi
nal with 12.
