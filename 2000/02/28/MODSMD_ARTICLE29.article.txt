### KATIE FITZPATRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
No. 8 Stanford women's gymnastics (8-2, 5-2 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) won an exciting meet in Corvallis, edging Oregon State (7-5,3-
3 Conference) on the last event. The Cardinal triumphed on Friday
night, winning 195.1-194.8.
Stanford had some very good performances, but was not always
rewarded with scores similar to what it has been recording of late. In
a subjective sport like gymnastics, oftentimes the home team enjoys
an advantage with the judge's scores.
"It's always hard competing at OSU; it tends to be a little biased.
It's not terrible, but it's enough to make a difference," said senior co
captain Larissa Fontaine.
The Cardinal fought back, not allowing the disappointing scores
to damper its spirits.
"We used it to motivate us," said sophomore Katy Herbert. "You
can't focus on judging — if you're good enough to win, you're going
to win."
The Cardinal proved in the end, it was certainly good enough to
win. Trailing OSU throughout the whole meet, Stanford pulled out
a 49.025 team effort on its last event, beam.
"The whole team stepped it up," Herbert said.
The beam title went to Herbert, who hit a near-perfect 9.9 set.
Freshman Abby Cair went first for the Cardinal, nailing her set for a
9.775. Fellow freshman Kelsey Stillinger added a 9.75, as did sopho
more Kristin Jensen. Jensen competed in beam for the first time in
her collegiate career. Fontaine gave a 9.85 effort, while junior Jen Fx
altacion added a 9.875.
Stanford also had a fine team effort on floor. Senior All-American
Sarah Harding and Fontaine shared second place with scores of
9.875. 1 larding, one of the best floor performers in the nation, hit a
great set.
"Sarah's floor routine was perfect," said Fontaine.
Fxaltacion and Cair both posted 9.775 floor efforts. Herbert was
close behind, rewarded with a 9.725 for her spunky floor routine.
()n bars. Stanford hit solid routines. Fontaine was the highest scor
er for the Cardinal with a 9.85 performance. 1 lerbert hit a good set
for a 9.725. Cooper, Harding and Jensen had line performances, but
were each only rewarded with scores of 9.65.
The vault title went to Fontaine with yet another near-perfect
9.95. Freshman Alissa Cooper took fourth on the event with a 9.70
for her clean but powerful vault.
Junior Jenny Wilson returned to the vault lineup for the first time
since early this season. With her vaulting ability, her return to (lie
lineup will help Stanford immensely in the postseason.
In the all-around, Fontaine continued her steak of wins, winning
with a 39.525. Cair totaled a 38.725 for third place. Jensen compet
ed in the all-around for the first time in her career for a 38.5 total.
The win was a very positive one for the Cardinal. The team was
able to put together a strong performance without the contributions
of sophomore Becky Meldrum and with Fxaltacion competing on
only two events because of a back injury.

Stanford also competed in front of its biggest ci owd of the year —
almost 5,000 boisterous Oregon State fans. The environment in Cor
vallis was similar to that of postseason gymnastics meets. With the
Cardinal's impressive performance amidst adversity, it should go fai
th is year.
