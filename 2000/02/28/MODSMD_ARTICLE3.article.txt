Internet can be summed up in one word:
wow. And whether this new medium wows
you or worries you, according to the panelists

at last night's
"Summit in Sili
con Valley"
hosted by NBC
news anchor
Tom Brokaw,
the Internet is

going to revolutionize the way the world does
everything — from business to social interac
tion.
"Stanford is the natural choice for this
event," Brokaw s;iid after the forum, which
was held in Memorial Auditorium. "You are at
the intersection of all knowledge and you guys
are constantly in the lead."
I'he two-hour live discussion, which was
televised on MSNBC, featured such Internet
legends as Jerry Yang, (Class of '94), founder
of Yahoo!, Jeff Bezos, founder of
Ama/on.com, Andy Crove, chairman of Intel
.iihl Steve (lhase, (T.() of America ()nline.
A group of journalists from papers such as
I lie New York Times and The Wall Street
Journal also participated.
The discussion was open for a few audience
questions, and a group of Stanford students
even got to participate in the discussion while
at the lech Museum of Innovation in San
Jose.
Panelists discussed the serious topic ol the
Internet's future — focusing mainly on issues
of e-comtnerce, censorship and equality of In
ternet access.
"These people lead companies that are
c hanging the future, so 1 figured the opportu
nity to hear them speak on campus was a
unique one that \v;is definitely worth coining
out early for," said sophomore Anthony (ihiu.

Chiu wasn't the only one excited to attend
the event. He said that although the doors
didn't open until 3:30 p.m., he arrived at 2:45
only to find about 100 people already in line.
C Ihiu and his friends then waited another hour
and a half until the summit 112 inally started.
"We are in the seminal stages of a revolu
tion," Brokaw began. "And these eight people
are at the epicenter."
One of the first issues the panel disc ussed
was Internet monopolies and how they will ai

led business on-line.
Brokaw asked Intel co-fbunder Grove if he
"was happy with Time-Warner and AOL get
ting together." Grove's reponse was a blunt,
"No."
Some audience members believed differ
ently, though. At 5:30 p.m., a group of stu
dents unfurled a banner from the balcony that
read "You've Got Monopoly." Security took

the banner away, but later in the
evening, one student produced a
bull-horn and demanded the ban
ner back. The student began ask
ing the panelists questions about
whether the Internet should be
used for advertisting.
According to Ankur Shah, one of
the students holding the banner,
they acted on behalf of the Stanford
group THINK! to add a turbulent
twist to an event they thought was
overly staged and scripted. T rue to
their Web site's promise to give "a
megaphone to the one that's really
pisseq/*ff," Shall and Christian Pea
caut also interrupted Tom Brokaw
with a bullhorn while the produc
tion was on the air.
Brokaw smoothed it over by say
ing, "You'll get your banner back,
and we'll give you some MSNBC
sweatshirts."
The discussion continued as
Brokaw asked eßay CEO Meg
Whitman if she thought there
would ever be a time when shop

ping would be conducted only on
line.
"I don't think so," Whitman
said. "Land-based stores will always
be a part of the experience."
Another problem e-commerce
companies may face is the possibil
ity of being saddled with taxes.
While most states generate a large
part of their revenue with sales tax,
it is unclear how or if sales tax will
be charged on Internet business
transactions. Courts have ruled
that companies may only be forced
to charge sales tax to customers
who live in the same state as the
company's physical location.
Gateway chairman Ted Waitt
said "Sales tax in this country is ex
tremely broken; it's very gray for
us."
Cisco Systems president John
Chambers felt differently. "We
should take this opportunity to
look at our tax system; if we don't
change things now, we won't get a
chance in the next ten years."
The discussion then shifted to
the social side of the Internet, with
University Provost John Hennessy
asking a question about censorship
on the Internet.

The audience watched a short
video montage about some of the
hate Web sites that are easily ac
cessed on the Internet.
Intel's Grove, a Holocaust
refugee, said "It chills me, it scares
me, but we still have to find some
way to balance things."
Darien Dash, CEO of DM K In
teractive Holdings, a service that
targets African-American popu
lations, said that the problems are
even more basic: over 70 percent
of African-American and Hispan
ic households don't have com
puters.
He says the revolution is leaving
certain groups in the dark, but he
hopes to work with other groups to
change that.
The panelists agreed that some
of the problems with the Internet
are also problems faced by swiety
in general, just carried to a new
venue.
They concluded the event by of
fering advice to the audience. Al
though eight millionaires sat on
stage, eßay's Whitman said,
"There are lots of young people
who are interested in contributing,
but it isn't all about money."
