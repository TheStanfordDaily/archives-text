## 
### SAMEER AHMED STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's ten
nis team (8-0, 2-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) defeated Pac-10 rival No.
7 UCIA yesterday, 4-3, to capture
its 11th title at the USTA/ITA Na
tional Men's Team Indoor Cham
pionships in Louisville, Ky.
Stanford's win at the National
Team Indoors, the premier colle
giate team indoor event of the sea
son, almost guarantees them a No.
1 ranking when the ITA collegiate
rankings come out on Wednesday.
Junior Alex Kim, the No. 2 play
er in the country, beat Jong-Min
Lee, 6-4, 4-6, 1-0 (10-4) at No. 1
singles to break a 3-3 tie and clinch
the title for Stanford.
The Cardinal was actually los
ing to UCLA in the beginning of
the match during doubles play. Al
though Kim and senior Ceoff
Abrams, the No. 1 doubles team in
the nation, defeated Lee and Bran
don Kramer, 8-5, at the No. 1 spot,
Stanford lost the other two doubles
matches, and UCLA clinched the
doubles point to go up 1-0.
However, the Cardinal battled
back in singles to win the match.
Besides Kim, Abrams, ranked
sixth in the country, and juniors
Scotty Scott and Ali Ansari all won
their singles matches to give Stan
ford the 4-3 victory.
"UCIA has a great team, and
I'm sine they'll get back at us this
year," head coach Dick Could said.
"We play them another two times
and might even be meeting in the
big one [NCAA final] down the
road. So you can't get too excited
about it.
"I'm very happy with the way
we competed, the way we came
back and the way we kept fighting,
especially when things weren't
going our way."
The Cardinal and the Bruins
will meet at least two more times
this season. UCI A visits The Farm
on April 7, and Stanford goes to
Los Angeles on April 22.
Both teams were playing with

out their top players in yesterday's
final. Stanford sophomore K.J.
Hippensteel, ranked third in the
country, has not played a dual
match this season because of a bout
with mononucleosis. Also, UCLA
Ail-American Jean-Noel Grinda
has sat out 12 of UCLA's 13 mate li
es this season because of a back in
jury.
These two teams have played
exceptionally well at the National
Team Indoors over the past
decade. In addition to the Cardi
nal's victory this year, Stanford
won team indoor titles in '92, '94,
'95 and '98, while UCLA won titles
in '91,'93, '96, '97 and '99.
Overall, the Pac-10 has domi
nated play at the National Team
Indoors, as four different schools -
Stanford, UCLA, California and
Southern California - have won the

title every year since 1987. In fact,
a school outside of California has
won this tournament only three
times since its inception in 1973.
However, the road to the Na
tional Team Indoors title was not
very easy lor the Cardinal this year.
Stanford even came very close
to losing its first round match
against No. 8 Illinois. In the decid
ing match, freshman David Martin
fought off two team match points
in the second set tie-breaker
against Jama! Parker. Martin bat
tled back to win, 4-0, 7-0 (9-7), 1-0
(10-7), giving the Cardinal a 4-3
victory.
The Cardinal then routed Indi
ana State in the second round, 7-1,
and squeezed past No. 14 Ten
nessee in the semifinals, 4-3. Martin
again clinched the Cardinal victory
by defeating Adam Carey, 6-4, 0-3.
