## Multi-year program still in "infancy stage" 
### TOMOKO SAKAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite efforts by I lousing and Din
ing Services to improve the consistency
and quality of (lining hall food, student
reaction remains mixed in the first year
of the Value Enhancement Program,
designed to keep students happy and
cut costs.
Undei the program, dining halls
have begun pi oducing food close to ser

vice time to eliminate waste. I'lans also
< all lor major renovations of Stern (lin
ing hall 11 lis summer and Wilbur dining
hall in 2001. Dining halls have in
creased hours of operation this year
and support the Stanford After Mid
night program at Stern and Lakeside
dining halls.
Shirlev Everett, director of Dining
Services, talked about passing savings
on to students.
"I'd say one of the major accomplish
ments we've made this year was to keep
the costs ll.it lor meal plans. We hope to
continue reduc ing costs next year too,"
Kveretl said.

"Our aim is not only to increase the
quality and consistency of
food, but to enhance the overall dining
service - including lighting,
equipment, menus and stall training,"
she said.
But many students hadn't even
heard of the nev\ initiative, and some
still complained about the quality of
dining hall food.
Freshman Sarah Huntwork, who
lives in Casa Zapata, is one such stu
dent.
"1 don't think there is anv steadv iin-

provement in the quality of meals
served here at Stern. What espe
cially bothers me is the overall
greasiness of food."
Other student complains in
volved the quality of service at
the dining halls.
Senior Syaril Hussin, a Roble
resident, said, "One thing that
seriously needs improvement is
the efficiency of management,
especially in the rush hours of
lunch. More than one person
should be serving at the main
entrees."
But Hussin and others said
they had seen an improvement
in the quality of dining ball food.
"I've never heard of the Value
Enhancement Program," said
Hussin. "But the meals at Lake
side have definitely improved —
more choices and better quality."
Students also expressed dif
ferent opinions on the quality ol
dining halls across campus.
Freshman Lindsey (ox, who
lives in Lagunita, said, "There is
definitely a disparity between a lot
of eating places. I'm overall satis
fied with my dining ball, and I es
pecially like theme nights - they
c reate a home-like ambience."
Senior Miguel Sanchez, who
lives in Kimball, said, "(loin
pared to places like Wilbur and
Ricker where some foods are
over-cooked or under-cooked,
the meals served at Manzanita
are very, very good. II anyone
had a c hoice of eating at Wilbui
or Manzanita, everyone would
dine here."
T.J. Shiang, a freshman living
in Florence Moore I fall, said, "As
its reputation holds, I think Flo
Mo has overall the best quality ol

food, especially compared to
Wilbur and Branner. Lakeside is
pretty good, l>nt Mo Mo still
wins."
Everett emphasized that i lit*
program will continue.
"We want students to realize
that the Value Enhancement
Program is a multi-year ellort,
and is still in its inlancy stage,"
Everett said.
ASSU President Mike Levin
said the ASSU is extremely con
cerned with the progress <»l the
Value Enhancement Program.
"A few years ago when we
took a consensus, the majority
of complaints were centered
around the old dining halls ol
Lagunita. Since then the) have
been replaced by lite new
Lakeside kitchen, and we have
been receiving satisfactory
opinions.
"In that sense, I'm very
pleased to say that the dining
halls which oiler mediocre food
qualities will be newly renovated
in the near future."
Everett s;iid communication
with students is an ai ea that Din
ing Services takes seriously.
Some familiar methods are ilu
lliers placed on dining hall tallies
and suggestion c aids.
"Branner takes in lots ol sug
gestions, and tliev lake out com
ments seriously. I liry are be
coming more responsive, and the
food is becoming more satislv
ing," said freshman kor\ Bern,
who lives in Branner.
"Suggestions arc responded
to the next day, and I appreciate
that." agreed freshman Lynn Ye,

"We try very bard to respond
to as many student concerns and
feel ii isom rcsponsihilil\ lo keep
them informed about the vai ious
progresses we are making," said
Everett.
