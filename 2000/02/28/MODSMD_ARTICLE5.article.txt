# Residence survey draws few responses
## ASSU requests student opinion for Draw Guide 
### JOHN HUETTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Aii ambitious new oil-line l)r;i\v
(iuicle may not include much student
input, as response has been low to a sur
vey designed to gather student opinions
about their residences.
Freshman Henry Towsner, ASSU

On-line Draw (iuide project manager,
said lew students have lilted out the
Draw (luide survey online at
lit tp://www.< lravv.stanldrd.edu.
An optimal response, according to
I owsner, would involve about 1,000 stu
dents rating various aspects of their resi
dences in the survey, which takes about
two minutes to complete, he said.
I lowever, Towsner has set his hopes
lower given the poor response to previ
ous survevs. "I'm hoping lor 500 to 600
| replies]." said Towsner. "We have about

half that."
ASSI I)eput\ ( '.hair Ben I.iu agrees
with Towsner's assessment. "We're
shooting for 1,000. We're expecting 750.
We have 300."
Liu, a junior majoring in Llcctrical
Kngineering and Kconomics, said the
lack of feedback hurts the (.uide's value
as a student resource.
" The best thing about the Draw
(Utide is that you can read what tirher
people wrote," said Liu. "It helpspeople
make informed draw choices and
makes sure people don't draw
into a house and find that every
room's a triple."
Guide designers are also con
cerned that content students
might be less likely to fill out the
sm'veyV while students unhappy
\\itji their housing situation will
eagerly come forward to attack
their residences.
"We've had surprising num
bers where only one person re
sponded, more negative than av
erage," Towsner said. As an exam
ple, he said one house — with
only one respondent — received
scathingly poor reviews in several
categories mixed with good scores
lor the rest.
Several students interviewed
said rhey had little knowledge of
the questionnaire. Orlando Lara,
an I jamaa freshman, said he
hadn't heard of the Draw Guide
survey; when asked il lie would
complete it, l.ara said, "I don't
kju>\v |iow, I don't know where. It
hasn't been advertised."
Aaron Greenfield, a Xanadu
junior, had a similar response.
"Gan't say that I have | heard ol the
survey]," said (ireenfield.
Chough the ASSU has used a
series of e-mails and flyers to pub
licize the survey, Liu admits the
campaign has its problems.
"We've put up flyers, but
they're limited in effectiveness,"
he said.
lowsner acknowledged the
difficulties in informing students
about the survey.

"You can send all the e-mails
you want - no one will read them.
You can post all the flyers you
want — no one will read them.
There's literally no way to tell peo
ple anything on this campus."
ASSU senators and associates
have attempted to start a word-ol
mouth campaign - "the only thing
that works," according to Towsner.
Informed students appear re
ceptive to the survey. As Green
field put it, "I'd probably just do it
because I thought it"<l be helpful
to other people, and I'd hope
other people'd do the same."
Sintha Keddy, a Roble fresh
man, agreed. "I was told it was
pretty quick and would help make
the Draw Guide a little better. I
was planning to use the Draw
(iuide myself."
In addition to these factors, the
ASSU will award three $100 prizes
to three randomly selected re
sponded. However, the number
of similai surveys and prizes may
have harmed the ability of the
ASSU to get results through such
incentives.
"Because ol the abundance of
surveys, you're less likely to take
any given survey," said Reddy.
Towsner hopes the ASSU can
consolidate the Draw (iuide sur
vey with other groups in the fu
ture years to avoid overwhelming
the students with multiple Winter
Quarter questionnaires. "Hous
ing has a survey," stated Towsner,
"Dining has a survey, ResKd lias a
survey, we have a survey."
()ne proposed solution for dis
tinguishing the Draw (iuide sur
vey from all the rest entails raffling
oil a high draw number (possibly
the number one slot) to those opt

ing to complete the form. "That
would definitely get more peo
ple," said Lara.
"1 think that'd be a better in
centive than the $300. I think
more peopled be more likely to
fill it out," agreed Greenfield.
Liu and Towsner both believe
the idea has merit, but are skepti
cal of tfie ASSU's ability to gain
such a prize. "I don't think that's
going to happen," said Liu.
"We have no control over the
draw itself," said Towsner.
Without the information, how
ever, the guide may still be an im
pressive resource. Since October,
Towsner, along with a group of
Senate associates, has taken over
350 digital photos, researched
Stanford's 50 undergraduate resi
dences and written countless lines
of code to ready the project for
spring quarter.
When asked about the total
man-hours given to the project,
Towsner laughed, "I wouldn't
know where to start."
The guide itself is proceeding
on schedule and will be released
sometime between winter quarter
dead week and the beginning of
spring quarter despite the low
feedback.
"Worst comes to worst, we're
going to go ahead with what we
have now," said Lowsner.
I fowever, the guide would dis
play links to the survey, hoping
students will reason, as l owsner
put it, "Now that I'm here, I might
as well iill it out."
"People should know it only
takes two minutes,'' said Towsner.
"The more people who do it, the
more useful the guide is lor every
one."

vey designed to gather student opinions
about their residences.
Freshman Henry Towsner, ASSU

On-line Draw (iuide project manager,
said lew students have lilted out the
Draw (luide survey online at
lit tp://www.< lravv.stanldrd.edu.
An optimal response, according to
I owsner, would involve about 1,000 stu
dents rating various aspects of their resi
dences in the survey, which takes about
two minutes to complete, he said.
I lowever, Towsner has set his hopes
lower given the poor response to previ
ous survevs. "I'm hoping lor 500 to 600
| replies]." said Towsner. "We have about

half that."
ASSI I)eput\ ( '.hair Ben I.iu agrees
with Towsner's assessment. "We're
shooting for 1,000. We're expecting 750.
We have 300."
Liu, a junior majoring in Llcctrical
Kngineering and Kconomics, said the
lack of feedback hurts the (.uide's value
as a student resource.
" The best thing about the Draw
(Utide is that you can read what tirher
people wrote," said Liu. "It helpspeople
make informed draw choices and
makes sure people don't draw
into a house and find that every
room's a triple."
Guide designers are also con
cerned that content students
might be less likely to fill out the
sm'veyV while students unhappy
\\itji their housing situation will
eagerly come forward to attack
their residences.
"We've had surprising num
bers where only one person re
sponded, more negative than av
erage," Towsner said. As an exam
ple, he said one house — with
only one respondent — received
scathingly poor reviews in several
categories mixed with good scores
lor the rest.
Several students interviewed
said rhey had little knowledge of
the questionnaire. Orlando Lara,
an I jamaa freshman, said he
hadn't heard of the Draw Guide
survey; when asked il lie would
complete it, l.ara said, "I don't
kju>\v |iow, I don't know where. It
hasn't been advertised."
Aaron Greenfield, a Xanadu
junior, had a similar response.
"Gan't say that I have | heard ol the
survey]," said (ireenfield.
Chough the ASSU has used a
series of e-mails and flyers to pub
licize the survey, Liu admits the
campaign has its problems.
"We've put up flyers, but
they're limited in effectiveness,"
he said.
lowsner acknowledged the
difficulties in informing students
about the survey.

"You can send all the e-mails
you want - no one will read them.
You can post all the flyers you
want — no one will read them.
There's literally no way to tell peo
ple anything on this campus."
ASSU senators and associates
have attempted to start a word-ol
mouth campaign - "the only thing
that works," according to Towsner.
Informed students appear re
ceptive to the survey. As Green
field put it, "I'd probably just do it
because I thought it"<l be helpful
to other people, and I'd hope
other people'd do the same."
Sintha Keddy, a Roble fresh
man, agreed. "I was told it was
pretty quick and would help make
the Draw Guide a little better. I
was planning to use the Draw
(iuide myself."
In addition to these factors, the
ASSU will award three $100 prizes
to three randomly selected re
sponded. However, the number
of similai surveys and prizes may
have harmed the ability of the
ASSU to get results through such
incentives.
"Because ol the abundance of
surveys, you're less likely to take
any given survey," said Reddy.
Towsner hopes the ASSU can
consolidate the Draw (iuide sur
vey with other groups in the fu
ture years to avoid overwhelming
the students with multiple Winter
Quarter questionnaires. "Hous
ing has a survey," stated Towsner,
"Dining has a survey, ResKd lias a
survey, we have a survey."
()ne proposed solution for dis
tinguishing the Draw (iuide sur
vey from all the rest entails raffling
oil a high draw number (possibly
the number one slot) to those opt

ing to complete the form. "That
would definitely get more peo
ple," said Lara.
"1 think that'd be a better in
centive than the $300. I think
more peopled be more likely to
fill it out," agreed Greenfield.
Liu and Towsner both believe
the idea has merit, but are skepti
cal of tfie ASSU's ability to gain
such a prize. "I don't think that's
going to happen," said Liu.
"We have no control over the
draw itself," said Towsner.
Without the information, how
ever, the guide may still be an im
pressive resource. Since October,
Towsner, along with a group of
Senate associates, has taken over
350 digital photos, researched
Stanford's 50 undergraduate resi
dences and written countless lines
of code to ready the project for
spring quarter.
When asked about the total
man-hours given to the project,
Towsner laughed, "I wouldn't
know where to start."
The guide itself is proceeding
on schedule and will be released
sometime between winter quarter
dead week and the beginning of
spring quarter despite the low
feedback.
"Worst comes to worst, we're
going to go ahead with what we
have now," said Lowsner.
I fowever, the guide would dis
play links to the survey, hoping
students will reason, as l owsner
put it, "Now that I'm here, I might
as well iill it out."
"People should know it only
takes two minutes,'' said Towsner.
"The more people who do it, the
more useful the guide is lor every
one."
