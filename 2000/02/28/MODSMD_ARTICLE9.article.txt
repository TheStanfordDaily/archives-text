# Candidates give views about military defense

### GREG PAGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Currently, the United States is
in the midst of the largest peace
time economic: expansion in its his
tory. In addition to discussing how
to maintain this growth, this year's
presidential candidates are also
busy discussing how to maintain
that peace.
Vice President A 1 Gore, a De
mocrat, is highlighting his past
arms control efforts and hoping
for future gains.
"As Vice President, Gore has led
important arms reduction efforts
around the world — including the
dismantling of Kazakhstan's nu
clear arsenal, the third largest in
the former Soviet Union; negotiat
ing Ukraine's decision to give up
all its nuclear weapons; and a deal
with .Russia and Kazakhstan to
keep-m£)re than halfa ton of bomb
grade uranium from tailing into
the hands of terrorists," reads a
Gore campaign statement pub
lished last month.
Gore has criticized the Senate's
failure to ratify the 1996 Compre
hensive Test Ban Treaty (nations
who ratify the Treaty agree not to
expand their nuclear arsenals).
no more important
challenge than stopping the
spread of nuclear weapons," Gore
said in an October radio advertise
ment. "This vote goes against the
tiide of history and the advice of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff from the Clin
ton, Bush, Reagan and Carter ad
ministrations."
Democratic candidate Bill

Bradley, a former Senator, is fo
cusing on reduced military spend
ing.
"We must re-examine our mili
tary policies and objectives in light
of the fact that we live in a post-
Cold War era. That will help us de
fine our defense needs. We must
also be careful about funding
weapons systems that powerful
congressional sources want, but
the military doesn't.
"I don't think we need to in
crease the defense budget as much
as the President has proposed,
particularly if we are able to elimi
nate those unnecessary weapons
systems," Bradley said during an
October Democratic debate in
New Hampshire.
Like his rival Gore, Bradley de
rides the Senate's failure to pass
the Test Ban Treaty. "It was a seri
ous loss. There's no more impor
tant issue than the control of nu
clear weapons in this world. The
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
would have prevented other coun
tries from getting nuclear
weapons. It also gave us the means
— through sensors and on-site in
spections —to monitor anyone
breaking the agreement. It is a
major job of the next president to
bring this treaty back to the Senate
in a way that allows a vote in favor,"
Bradley writes on his Web site.
Republican candidate Texas
Gov. George Bush proposes main
taining a strong military presence
and increasing the strength of the
military.
