# Candidates give views about military defense

### GREG PAGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Currently, the United States is
in the midst of the largest peace
time economic: expansion in its his
tory. In addition to discussing how
to maintain this growth, this year's
presidential candidates are also
busy discussing how to maintain
that peace.
Vice President A 1 Gore, a De
mocrat, is highlighting his past
arms control efforts and hoping
for future gains.
"As Vice President, Gore has led
important arms reduction efforts
around the world — including the
dismantling of Kazakhstan's nu
clear arsenal, the third largest in
the former Soviet Union; negotiat
ing Ukraine's decision to give up
all its nuclear weapons; and a deal
with .Russia and Kazakhstan to
keep-m£)re than halfa ton of bomb
grade uranium from tailing into
the hands of terrorists," reads a
Gore campaign statement pub
lished last month.
Gore has criticized the Senate's
failure to ratify the 1996 Compre
hensive Test Ban Treaty (nations
who ratify the Treaty agree not to
expand their nuclear arsenals).
no more important
challenge than stopping the
spread of nuclear weapons," Gore
said in an October radio advertise
ment. "This vote goes against the
tiide of history and the advice of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff from the Clin
ton, Bush, Reagan and Carter ad
ministrations."
Democratic candidate Bill

Bradley, a former Senator, is fo
cusing on reduced military spend
ing.
"We must re-examine our mili
tary policies and objectives in light
of the fact that we live in a post-
Cold War era. That will help us de
fine our defense needs. We must
also be careful about funding
weapons systems that powerful
congressional sources want, but
the military doesn't.
"I don't think we need to in
crease the defense budget as much
as the President has proposed,
particularly if we are able to elimi
nate those unnecessary weapons
systems," Bradley said during an
October Democratic debate in
New Hampshire.
Like his rival Gore, Bradley de
rides the Senate's failure to pass
the Test Ban Treaty. "It was a seri
ous loss. There's no more impor
tant issue than the control of nu
clear weapons in this world. The
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
would have prevented other coun
tries from getting nuclear
weapons. It also gave us the means
— through sensors and on-site in
spections —to monitor anyone
breaking the agreement. It is a
major job of the next president to
bring this treaty back to the Senate
in a way that allows a vote in favor,"
Bradley writes on his Web site.
Republican candidate Texas
Gov. George Bush proposes main
taining a strong military presence
and increasing the strength of the
military.
"I support inc leased pav and
bcttei benefits ,ni(l training lot
our citizen soldiers. Rebuilding
Amei i( a s home delenses is an ur
gent priority. I support deploying
antiballistie missile systems to
guard against attack and black
mail. And America should mod
ernize its militan capability by in
vesting in research and develop
inent to make oui militai \ more
suited to the needs of the twcnt\-
first century." he writes in his
book, "A Charge to Keep, pub
lished lasi year.
At his candidacy announcement
speech in lowa last June, bush
said, " I his is still a world ol terror
and missiles and madmen. We are
challenged In aging weapons and
failing intelligence. I will rebuild
oui militan power — because a
dangerous world still requires a
sharpened swoi <1.
"I will mow <iuickl\ to defend

our people and our allies against
missiles and blackmail. And I will
have a foreign policy with a touch
of iron — driven by American val
ues and Amcric an interests."
(.Ol* challenger Senator John
McCain, w ho hcquenth mentions
his own experiences as a soldier in
the Vietnam War, stresses the im
portance ol military background in
national leadership.
"I think the st.ite of our militai \
is still important. I think the lad
that we have a president of the
I nited Stales, National Securit\
Adviser, a Sec i clan of State and a
Sccrclan of Defense, none ol
whom have ever spent one minute
wearing the uniform of the I nited
Stales of America's militan is a dis
grace. and we're going to change
that," Mt (lain said at a South (Car
olina Republican debate last
month.
McCain, who voted against the
Comprehensive lest Han I'rcalv,
also opposes I he \nli-Ballistic Mis
sile I reatv, a 1 ( .)72 agreement be
tween the I .S. and I .S.S.R. which

said neither would build nation
wide missile defense.
"A massive nuclear exchange
between the U.S. and the Soviet
I nion is no longer our central
pie-occupation. The threat is
much more diverse, and more
chllic ult to deter. We urgently
need a practical ballistic missile
dclensc, and the ABM Treaty is

tor the moment blocking us from
obtaining it.
"[We should develop] a defense
against terrorists and rogue states
that will benefit all nations. Let us
praise the good intentions that cre
ated the ABM Treaty, then consign
it to the history pages where it be
longs," McCain writes on his Web
site.
