### ANNE CORTINA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Though Big (..line (iaieties may have
been lasi quarter's entertainment, it is this
quarter's business lor Ram's I lead, the stu
dent theater group that produces (iaieties,
Original W inter One Acts and the Spring
M usual.
Last night, Ram's Head held a post
mortem lor (iaieties in which the produc
tion, artistic and technical stalls met with the
producer of next year's (iaieties to discuss
successes and problems with the 1999 pro
duction. Ram s I lead members hope that
next year's producers will learn from this
vear's c ast inembei s., reflected on her expe
rience.
"because Rain's Head oflicers switch
evei \ veaisaid junioi (larina I raiqat, pro
due er of (iaieties 1999, "we want some kind
of continuitN l)\ sharing what goes into di
recting |and | producing and what makes ac -
tors happy."
This "post-mort" is different than others
in its timing. Ac c ( >1 ding to senior Kath\ Steel,
executive producer of Ram's Head, "post
morts" are usualK done two weeks to a
month altera slu >\\, w bile this one took place
nearly lour months alter (iaieties.
"I here are some things that seemed likea
realh big issue at the time." Steel said. "But
now we can look and see what really big
changes need to be made."
The main c hallenges Gaieties laced last
year were space and funding.

As a student theater group separate from
the I 'nivcrsity. Rain's I lead has had trouble
finding reheaisal space. This year, finding
space ibrthe large cast to sing and dance was
a challenge, ac cording to Uraiqat.
"We only had six weeks to rehearse," she
said. "And we couldn't just c anc el a rehearsal
or two because we couldn't find space. We
needed big spaces to rehearse lor lour hours
a night."
Sophomore |ohn I urnbull, vocal direc
tor of(iaieties 1999, said the Drama Depart
ment and Lively Arts performances used
main prime rooms.
"The Drama Department rehearses
shows |iu the same place] from the begin
ning, so (other | shows can't go up," I urnbull
said. "Anothei issue is Lively Arts. |Their]
tic ket prices are so high that most students
c an't ailbrd [their shows]. I hey use space
that could be used lor student rehearsal. It
shouldn't be at the price ol student work."
According to I urnbull. Stanford lags be
hind peer institutions in its support for stu
dent theater. But Rani's Head has been
lighting loryeai sto get more I niversity sup
port lor student theater, Steel said.
"Space has been talked about Ibr a couple
years," she said, "and there's been a lot of
promises, but nothing specific. We're still
waiting. It's a perpetual nightmare to get
space."
More than 4,000 pec >ple saw (iaieties this
yeai. According to I'raiqat, producing a
