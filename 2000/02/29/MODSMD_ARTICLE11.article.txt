### SCOTT DORFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Noted scholar Song Yongyi, re
leased last month from a Chinese
detention center, detailed his expe
riences with the Chinese prison and
legal systems and addressed the
health of Hua Di, a Stanford re
searcher detained in the same
prison, in a speech on campus yes
terday.
Song researches the Cultural
Revolution at Dickinson College in
Carlisle, Fenn.
A crowd of over 50 people at
tended his speech at the Asia-Pacific
Research Center iu Encina Hall.

in discovering the truth of a case.
" l he people at the Beijing Bu
reau were only interested in getting
a promotion," he said. "Most of
them were under-educated and
they did not know what constituted
'state secrets.' The most important
thing was saving face, and it didn't
matter if innocent people were
harmed iu the process."
August, authorities also de
tained Song's wife, Helen Yao, due

wife as well as the husband, and if
