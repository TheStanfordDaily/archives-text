# Row kitchen manager deemed a tough job
## Feeding a house proves challenging for staff 
### ERIC SHEN 
When trying to satisfy hungry Row
house residents, procuring the pro
duce, managing the menus and coor
dinating the cooking crews can be a
tough job. These tasks fall to the
house's kitchen manager, a position
that — while rewarding — can cause
stress that can lead to misuse of house
funds, s.iid .1 former kitchen manager.
"1 actually don't think we pleased
anybody. We didn't even please our
selves," said a former kairos kitchen
manager, referring to herselfand a co
kitchen manager.
"In retrospect, perhaps the difficul
ties of the job drove us to dabble in
some . . . corrupt practices. For in
stant e, s.i\ we were at Price Club on a
big run lor groceries and supplies; we
might pic k up a wheel of brie, a bottle
of wine . . . once I bought a Pearl Jam
(11). I think we might have convinced
ourselves we deserved a perk or two
lot such an underappreciated job."
Row houses typic ally choose one or
more kite lien managers through elec
tions oi consensus meetings, accord
ing to Augie (>alvan, assistant director
foi student management for the Row.
Most c andidates share an interest in

food and cooking, but there are no ex
plicit prerequisites for the job. "I had
some work with kitchens ... I lived
here the previous year, and did a lot of
cooking," said Tom Nguyen, a junior
and kitchen manager at Kairos. "II
people are interested in running the
kitchen, kitchen managers will proba

bly train them," lie said. "Experience is
really helpful, but not required."
Kitchen managers also receive
training through the Row office and
Student Organized Services program,
