## McCain critiques evangelists 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — John
McCain derided Pat Robertson
and other evangelical "agents ot
intolerance" yesterday in a high
stakes bid to expand his Republi
can coalition without alienating
religions conservatives whose
votes and contributions have
fueled the party's rise.
"We are the party of Ronald
Reagan, not Pat Robertson," the
Arizona senator said yesterday in
Virginia Beach, home of Robert
son's ( Inistiiin (loalition.
"1 am a Reagan Republican
w ho will defeat Al Gore," he said.
Rival George W. Bush "is a Pat
Robertson Republican who will
lose to Al (lore."
McCain's advisers likened his
visit to the lion's den to a 1992
address by President Clinton, who
chose to criticize a black rap artist
while sharing the stage with the
Rev. Jesse Jackson — dramatizing
the Arkansas governor's pledge to
tear away the Democratic Party
lioni the clutches ol its most liberal
elements.
McCain's address marked a
sharpening of his strategy to
"build a bigger Republican Party"
by courting independents,
Democrats and moderate Repub
licans who normally don't partici
pate in the political process.
Religious conservatives are an
active component of the Republi
can coalition that controls
Gongress, an electrified "third
rail" of C •( )P politics rarely crossed
by candidates seeking a party
nomination or needing help in a
general election.
" I he social conservatives are
an important part of the Republi
can coalition and they need to be
part ol'a winning coalition to beat
Al Gore," said GOP strategist Scott
Reed, who ran Bob Dole's 1996
presidential campaign.
Exit polls showed that 17 per
cent of the general election voters
in 1996 identified themselves as
( hristian conservatives.
In Virginia, where McCain
laces Bush in an important prima
ry today, 21 percent of all voters in
the 1996 general election called
themselves Christian conservatives.
And one-fourth of California
Republicans who voted in the
state's 1996 primary were reli
gious conservatives. They could
play a critical role in the state's
Match 7 primary, which McCain
believes he must win to keep his
candidacy alive.
"Everything in politics has its
downside," McCain campaign
manager Rick Davis said. A possi
ble downside for McCain, he
said, would be for his comments
"to be characterized inappropri
ately as going on some anti-
Republican, anti-religions right
crusade."
Indeed, Bush replied to the
speech In accusing McCain of
"playing the religious card."
"Ronald Reagan didn't point
fingers. I le never played to peo
ple's religious fears like Senator
McCain has shamelessly done,"
the Texas governor said during a
news conference in Bellevue,
Wash. Republicans in Virginia,
Washington State and North
Dakota are voting today.
In a speech conceived over the
weekend and written by longtime
aide Mark Salter, McCain said he
was criticizing some of the move
ment's leaders — not rank-and
file conservatives. Gary Bauer, a
i eligious activist who chopped out
of the presidential race and now
supports McCain, suggested that
the Arizonan should praise
prominent religious conservatives
Charles Colson and James Dob
son; McCain took his advice.
