VIENNA, Austria (AP) — Right-wing
leader Joerg Haider — criticized for anti
foreigner statements and past praise of
aspects of the Nazi era — resigned as head
of the freedom Party yesterday, an appar
ent bid to end Austria's ostracism that Ibl
lowed his rise to power.
1 laider, 50, made the announcement at a
closed-door meeting of his party's national
leadership at a hotel in downtown Vienna.
Haider remains governor of Garinthia
province and insisted that his decision does
not mean he is retiring from the national
political scence.
Although Haider holds no post in the
national government, his controversial
image as well as his his iron-hand control of
the Freedom Party made him the most visi
ble member of the Austrian political estab
lishment of late.
Haider will be succeeded as party chief
by his trusted lieutenant, Vice Chancelloi
Susanne Riess-Passer, 39. She told reporters
she had not wanted Haider to step aside,
but she said she respects his decision.
flie Austria Press Agency said Haider

told the parts leadership meeting that he
was stepping down because he did not w ant
"to stand in the wav" ol the work of the new
government.
I he 11 other European Union members
have downgraded relations with Austria
because of the presence of I laider's parts in
the government which took office I eb. 1.
I bis outrage was based on 11 aider's anti
immigrant stand .is well as bis past praise of
veterans of the murderous Wallen SS and
the "orderlv" employment policies used In
Adolf Hitler.
I here was no immediate reaction from
other El members. In Washington, howev
er, State Department spokesman James
Rubin said Haider's resignation was a "step
in the right direction" but noted that the
freedom Part\ remains in government "so
we'll be watching their behavior."
Some Austrian politicians and commen
tators doubted that the resignation signaled
the end of I laider's influence on the nation
al government. Riess-Passer and others in
the freedom Parts leadership have long
established reputations as Haider disciples

who owe their political positions lo him.
I he newl\ elected head ol the opposi

plv "one ol Haider's main tactical tricks"
and would give the coalition a respite Irom

pivotal in lorcing I laider to step down.
"We only hope that his resignation sends
a strong message to other members ol the
