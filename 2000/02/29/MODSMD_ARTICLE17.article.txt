## The 						Stanford Daily Internal post office investigation won't solve problems 
### 
Published Since 1891

Sato's recent announcement that he is
beginning an internal investigation ol
the Stanford post office is a cop-out at
best. Not only does the pending internal investi
gation make Acting Manager Robert Reed's
promises of an external audit by the ()flice of the
Inspector (ieneral ring false, but it also provides
little hope that post office operations will
improve.
11orace I linshaw, a postal service spokesman,
told I he Daily yesterday, " There's no evidence
of wrongdoing. There's no pattern of losses or
complaints."
It's worth speculating how any "evidence"
can be found without performing an investiga
tion. It seems as if post office representatives are
assuming no criminal intent and are taking that
as "evidence" tliiit nothing wrong has been done

— in the very absence of an investigation that
could confirm such a bold conclusion.
Hinshaw's interesting statement that there
has been "no pattern of losses or complaints"
completely contradicts students' concerns that
were raised at the Feb. 15 ASSU forum. At that
forum, Sato, as well as Reed, heard students dis
cuss the various problems they have had with
slow and rude service, lost mail, and even sexu
al harassment.
This pattern of ineffective service and lost
mail has been particularly problematic in the
past few months since the post office's move, but
has been on-going for a number of years, stu
dents said.
Does this not constitute a "pattern" that can
be investigated? Are post office officials con
vinced that there are no instances of lost mail,
despite the fact that mail from November and

December is suddenly arriving in students' mail
boxes? Where was that mail before, if not disor
ganized, or, indeed, lost?
With Sato preparing to begin an internal
investigation, students should lie rightly con
cerned about the effectiveness of such an
endeavor. Sato did not know the name of the
student who complained of sexual harassment
at the Feb. 15 forum, even though Reed told
The Daily, "We take this extremely seriously. It's
not tolerated at all."
1 linshaw added that "the student has to come
forward and give information" — is that not
what she did at the forum, in the presence of
both Reed and Sato? Why was her information
not taken down then?
I low can Sato conduct an investigation of
the very office that has gone downhill under his
watch? Will his office be able to provide objec

tive reasons for problems for which they may
be responsible?
An internal investigation is not the answer to
the post office's problems. It is highly unlikely
that an office that has faced such tremendous
disorganization and ineffectiveness can actually
throughly investigate itself and arrive at viable
solutions while trying to mend its ways.
And it is unreasonable to expect that an office
that has been either disregarding or ignoring
the complaints of students — as evidenced by
their insistence that there is no "pattern" of lost
mail — will suddenly begin to take those claims
seriously.
In addition, the post office's insistence that
students must use the formal Postal Service
Form 1510 to file complaints, suggesting that

lliiscdiioii.il represents the opinion of the Daily's editorial Ixkuxl. I lie hoard consists of loin Dail\ editors, two st.iH members .it-large, and three I niversity community members at-large.
Signed columns and contributions are the view ol the writer and do not necessarilx represent the view ol the editorial board.
disregarded, simply serves to fur
ther hinder the process of re
dress.
Also, the lack of any defined
timeline for tlu* internal investi
gation only further supports the
notion that an internal investiga
tion cannot be elfective. With 110
established timeline for the inves
tigation, any accountability for ac
tually conducting the investiga
tion is effectively lost as it will al
ways be "ongoing."
The post office cannot investi
gate* itself. II it has problems func
tioning in its daily processes, how
can ;i successful internal investi

gation be possible?
Only an external investigation,
conducted by the OIG, can ac
complish what the post office
needs — an in-depth, unbiased
look at what the post office's
problems have been, and what
types of solutions can be institut
ed.
Students should push for an
external investigation of an office
that has been providing ineffec
tive service on this campus for far
too long. Reed and his office need
to be by-passed and the OIG
needs to step up to the plate. If
not, students should join the task
force attempting to bring a post
office competitor onto campus.
Only with such efforts will solu
tions to the grave post office
problems become evident.
