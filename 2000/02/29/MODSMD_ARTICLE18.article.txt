# FARM LIFE
## Naughty winter quarter 
### 
I got a 35 out of 100 on my Econ SO
("Statistics for Social Scientists")
midterm. There, I've said it. That
wasn't so bad. According to the
high-tech i/io.stanlord.edu, the average
lot the c lass was around 55 with a stan
dard deviation of 22 (!).
Now, don't think getting a 35 percent
is something I take lightly. Hardly — in
fact, I just about had a heart attack when
I saw n st,ii ing me blindly in the lace (and
ni\ parent's lac rs — they happened to be
here loi the weekend to make it even
worse).
Yours trulv is one of those sit ko 20-

units-a-quarter-since-1-
t»< >l-IICM C" |K'()|)lt'ail(l, ll|)
until now, I've emerged
unscathed. It just means
selecting a do-able
course load and sat rili< -
ing a lew parlies here
and there. (My draw
mates are saving "veali
right as we speak),
lor kcon SO, I'd

done line on every
problem set. never missed a lecture, went
to ollice hours and section, and studied.
I left the midterm leeling line — so what
happened? Iwervlhiug should have
worked out, no?
lint obvious Kit didn't, and I've been
agonizing these past lew days trying to
see what I did wrong—and I can't find
the answer. I here are those classes
where vou leave the exam knowing you
took .1 hit, but this wasn't one of them.
I 'his was a case ol an out-of-nowbere
and lor-,ibsoluteK-no-reason academic
shock; I've only bad it happen once before
in my college career — with a paper I
spent hours on for Introduction to the
I lumanities, and got a D+. It was during
last dastardly winter quarter as well.
All right, poor Chris, so what's your
point here? Basically, I'd like to talk
about the "Winter Quarter Curse." Yup,
that's light. A curse. My old I-Hum
leaching fellow said that, during winter
quarter, students typically do better
because the weather Ibrces them to study
more and keep indoors.
As far as I'm concerned, that's a lie. So
far — and this is my second winter quar
ter here — it's been my worst term. The
impossible-to-figure-out, but generally
depressing weather, the lack of light, the
bt evitv of the term, the lure of Tahoe —
all of these contribute to making winter
quaiter the quarter from hell.
And I haven't even gotten to "Arabian
Nights," "Professors and Naughty
Schoolgirls" or "Heaven and Hell,"
though I wouldn't know — I missed

them because I was studying for this gad
dang midterm, and look what ii got me:
nothing, save depression, confusion,
depravity, and sobriety. (I guess the latter
might be a good thing).
What I'd like to know is, in this aca
demic world of ours, WHAT GIVES?
You're told to do something and, if you
follow it, it should be all good. That's the
path I took with my Econ SO class, but it
failed me, and who's to blame?
What kills me is that there are plenty
who've missed lecture, took an easy way
out with the problem sets, and yet, for
some inexplicable reason, I'm sure they
did way above the average on this horrif
ic midterm. And they probably went to
"Arabian Nights" and the Talisman/
Taiko extravaganza.
I ll say it again. 1 lie questions we all
ask ourselves when this happens: what
gives? Why me?
Now, in absolutely no way am I advo
cating missing lecture and cheating. Both
I find abhorrent — why would you be
shelling out over $30,000 to slack off and
what about that little thing we call morals
and ethics? But what I am advocating
(and perhaps this is simple advice that is
really only enlightening to me, but you
might get something out of it too) is that,
basically, you have to make the most of
this.
Have fun, and work gaddang hard.
Sometimes crap happens for absolutely
no reason and there's nothing you or I
can do about it. Dance naked in the rain
— maybe even drunk — and ski every
weekend, finish every problem set, sit
through every section, and give it your all
even if fate wants to spank you anyway.
Balance your life and, in the end, at least
you'll know you tried. That's the best you
or I can do during this annual season of
the "Winter Quarter Curse," so we've
just got to deal.
As you know, things have a funny way
of working themselves out. That l) + I-
I lum paper — my final grade in the class
was an A-. I'm not saying this to brag, but
rather to show the proof of the hope we
must have in order to come out okay. It's
what'll keep me going through Econ 80,
and every other rainy winter quarter; in
the end, Statistics for Social Scientists will
be just a memory with an impact that, in
the long run (econo-talk, I'm sorry), will
be just a bad memory and (hopefully)
nothing more.

regressions and hypothesis testing.

depravity, and sobriety. (I guess the latter
might be a good thing).
What I'd like to know is, in this aca
demic world of ours, WHAT GIVES?
You're told to do something and, if you
follow it, it should be all good. That's the
path I took with my Econ SO class, but it
failed me, and who's to blame?
What kills me is that there are plenty
who've missed lecture, took an easy way
out with the problem sets, and yet, for
some inexplicable reason, I'm sure they
did way above the average on this horrif
ic midterm. And they probably went to
"Arabian Nights" and the Talisman/
Taiko extravaganza.
I ll say it again. 1 lie questions we all
ask ourselves when this happens: what
gives? Why me?
Now, in absolutely no way am I advo
cating missing lecture and cheating. Both
I find abhorrent — why would you be
shelling out over $30,000 to slack off and
what about that little thing we call morals
and ethics? But what I am advocating
(and perhaps this is simple advice that is
really only enlightening to me, but you
might get something out of it too) is that,
basically, you have to make the most of
this.
Have fun, and work gaddang hard.
Sometimes crap happens for absolutely
no reason and there's nothing you or I
can do about it. Dance naked in the rain
— maybe even drunk — and ski every
weekend, finish every problem set, sit
through every section, and give it your all
even if fate wants to spank you anyway.
Balance your life and, in the end, at least
you'll know you tried. That's the best you
or I can do during this annual season of
the "Winter Quarter Curse," so we've
just got to deal.
As you know, things have a funny way
of working themselves out. That l) + I-
I lum paper — my final grade in the class
was an A-. I'm not saying this to brag, but
rather to show the proof of the hope we
must have in order to come out okay. It's
what'll keep me going through Econ 80,
and every other rainy winter quarter; in
the end, Statistics for Social Scientists will
be just a memory with an impact that, in
the long run (econo-talk, I'm sorry), will
be just a bad memory and (hopefully)
nothing more.

You can ro mini se rate with Chris at
cmaloneytfvleland. Until next time, he will be
listening to upbeat South African music and
thinking about the summer while doing simple
regressions and hypothesis testing.
