# Graduate housing subsidies cut
## University cites budget, new housing as reasons for funding reduction 
### NINA HOLLY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Many graduate students are ques
tioning the I niversity's priorities after
receiving letters informing them that,
due to budgetary constraints, Stanford
may not subsidize oil-campus housing
in the future.
flie letter came with a survey of stu
dent preferences for off-campus hous
ing. The mailing caused a stir among
graduate students living off-campus,
many of whom believed that the survey
was a binding commitment that might
determine their housing assignments
for next year.
Keith (iuy, associate vice provost lor
housing, said that the University is now
building several hundred on-campus
units for graduate students. This Sep
tember, 508 units will be reach w itli the
completion of the new graduate hous
ing complex on Campus Drive.
The rest, approximately 300 units,
will open next winter.
Sharon Green and Oak Creek —
two Menlo Park apartment complexes
— will be ending current leases for
graduate students under the new plan.
Guy said that graduate stTTftaits living
in those apartments are currently in
one-year leases, v\ hie h will be curtailed
to accommodate the students' move to

less expensive, less convenient units or
to on-campus housing.
Administrators are currentlv work
ing to ease the transition Irom oil-cam
pus to on-campus housing.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Kducation James Montoya said of the
change, "The graduate student com
inunitx has effectively voiced those is
sues which are most related to the tran
sition from oll'-campus subsidized
housing to new graduate housing on
campus."
Rodger W hitney, director of Stu
dent I lousing Services, said, "There is
a balancing act between students hav
ing to move within the lottery and
seeking stabilitv. Nobody wants to have
the students move."
I lie Graduate Student Council is
activelv representing graduate student
rights in this transition. One of the
council's goals is stability for students
li \ ing oil campus; moving back to cam
pus will mean high costs for main
graduate students.
GSC nieinbei lluntei I art, a gradu
ate student in mat hematic sand chair of
the Graduate Housing Association
(loin in it tee. said that the main issue lin
ing graduate students who live off cam
pus is having to move, possibly more
than once dm ing the academic vear.
fart said that the committee is cur
rent l\ measuring students' demand
"loi the housing lotterv, for off-cam
pus housing and [for] student willing
ness to move into housing that will be
come available in the middle of the
year."

The committee is putting out its
own housing survey, which should he
functional later this week, to clar i I \
their demands.

Kellv Russell, a married graduate
student liv ingofl campus. said the sur
vey will provide a more accurate pic
ture of graduate student needs. He
cause she is married, Russell said, liv
ing farther Irom campus would place
additional pressures on her husband
and her. "Having one car if I live far
from campus is not an option," she
said.
Oil-campus housing lias heen nec
essary lor many graduate students,
since Stanford does not have enough
apartments to house them all. Since
1 111\ 1998, spec ial rent funds have sub
sidized the living costs ol students
forced to live oil campus clue to lack ol
housing.
In 1998, the I niversitv allocated
emergencv housing aid to students
who found themselves in linanciallv
precarious situations, such as rapid
rent increases.
I hough the emergen* v stipend has
increased about eight percent per vear
since its inception, that increase is not
enough in a housing market with val
ues increasing an average of 20 per
cent annually.
The graduate students will likelv
need to comph with the housing tran
sition. but "meeting [ofl-campus] hous
ing costs is ridiculous," according to
Russell.
