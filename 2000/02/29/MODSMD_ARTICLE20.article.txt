Post office audit a conflict of interest
Editor's note: This letter was original!y sent In Stall Tuck
er, district manager of the San Francisco Region I '.S.
Postal Service.
A growing body of evidence suggests
local and district postal officials are con
cealing severe mismanagement and pos
sible criminal acts in the Stanford substa
tion. Until this weekend, I could not
understand why Robert Reed and Masa
Sato were so hesitant to call lor an outside
investigation of the Stanford substation,
particularly when they had been present
ed with so much evidence of malfeasance
and wrongdoing. Then I learned that the
manager of customer service for Palo Alto
is Julie Reed, wife of Robert Reed.
Numerous complaints about missing
mail and packages should have been
directed to Mrs. Reed, who in turn
should have informed Mr. Sato and the
Postal Inspection Service. Yet Mr Sato
and other postal managers claim they
were unaware of all the complaints con
cerning the Stanford substation. Clearly,
Mrs. Reed is one party (among others)

who could be implicated in the missing
complaint forms. So, doesn't it seem like
a conflict of interest for her husband to
oversee an internal "investigation" that
might implicate her?
Moreover, Mr. Sato claims he had no
knowledge of the myriad of problems at
the Stanford substation. Doesn't this sug
gest he has failed to oversee the facilities
under bis direction? Yet, Mr. Sato is
essentially being allowed to investigate
himself is another c lear conflict of interest.
I he conduct of local postal service offi
cials has ranged from inept to inexcus
able. Horace Hinshaw's comments in
today's Stanford Daily were no excep
tion. 1 realize Mr. Hinshaw is a public
relations flak, and I realize it's bis job to
try to put a good spin on bad news, but
his comments in the Daily were more
than spin, in that they were blatantly
false. Mr. Hinshaw is either spreading
misinformation negligently or he is
telling bald-faced lies intentionally. Nei
ther speaks well of your office.
A few examples of Mr. Hinshaw's dis
tortions:

"There' s no evidence of wrongdoing."
I his statement seems particularly odd
since Mr. Reed is quoted in the same arti
cle as saying an incident of sexual harass
ment at the Stanford substation is cur
rently under investigation (or maybe the
postal service doesn't consider sexual
harassment to be "wrongdoing").
"We're doing that investigation
internally," Reed said. "We take
this extremely seriously. It's not
tolerated at all." Ac tually, that's not
true in that neither Mr. Reed nor
anyone under his direction is con
ducting an investigation because
they didn't bother to get the name
of the student who reported the in
cident. I know her name, and I've
taken the liberty of referring her to
the Postal Inspection Service.
I' rankly, she doesn't want to report
it to your people because she
doesn't trust them and neither do
I.
" I here's no pattern of losses or
complaints." Numerous students
attested to missing packages and
mail in the presence of Mr. Reed
and Mr. Sato at the Feb. 15, 2000
meeting at Stanford. I n the last two
days, two more students told me of
packages that arrived with the con -
tents missing. I'm receiving re
ports from all over campus that
mail from weeks ago â€” even
months ago is suddenly being
found and delivered now that the
postal service is under the gun. I
suddenly had mail show up that
was sent three-and-a-half months
ago. If there is no "pattern" of loss
es or complaints it is because offi
cials have been "losing" or "misdi
recting" all the complaints that
were sent to them. We have al
ready demonstrated that com
plaints have been sent directly to
Mr. Sato and yet he claims not to
have received them. Who's fault is

that?
"There is no evidence of a Hood
of responses to incidents." In his
garbled syntax, Mr. Ilinshaw
seems to be saying there hasn't
been a "flood" of complaints. So
how many "responses to incidents"
does it take to constitute a "flood"?
Ten, twenty, or a hundred coin
plaints isn't enough? Tell me how
many complaints 1 need to bring
you before your bureauc rats real
ize there's a bona fide problem
here.
" There's no evidence of serious
crimes, like embezzling or mail
theft." When the contents of a
package have been removed and
the package has been re-sealed
and delivered, that constitutes mail
theft. Right? Well I'll get you all the
evidence you need. Tell me when
and where you need the affidavits,
since it's obvious the postal ser
vice's "internal investigation" isn't
uncovering any of the evidence
I've found.
If you truly want to repair the
tattered relationship between the
Stanford community and the U.S.
Postal Service, you can start by
telling Mr. Hinshaw to shut his
mouth. Every time he utters such
blatant falsehoods on the front
page of our campus newspaper,
there are at least 14,000 people
who know he is full of bovine ex
crement. It is offensive that lie
should try to downplay the magni
tude of the problems here?
In his Feb. 25 letter to me, Mr.
Reed said he contacted the Postal
Inspection Service and Office of
Inspector General on Feb. 16. He
noted that these agencies indepen

dently make their decisions to in
vestigate oi audit. I am concerned
that if Mr. Reed reports the situa
tion at the Stanford substation to
these agencies like Mr. Hinshaw

Steinbeck exhibit engenders
outrage
1 am writing to express my out
rage over the Steinbeck exhibit in
the Peterson Room of the Bing
Wing in Green Library, on display
from Feb. 27 to March 8.
The exhibit hardly pays tribute
to Steinbeck. The display cases are
so poorly lit and Steinbeck's letters
are placed so far in the back of the
cases that one has to press one's
nose up against the glass in order
to make out any of Steinbeck's faint
hand writing. But one's squinting
eyes quickly tire of such strenuous
reading conditions, 112 urthermore,
two of the display cases are practi
cally adjacent to the restrooms.
Steinbeck was not a happy un
dergraduate at Stanford, and this
exhibit unjustly serves him and his
memory.

Steinbeck exhibit engenders
outrage
1 am writing to express my out
rage over the Steinbeck exhibit in
the Peterson Room of the Bing
Wing in Green Library, on display
from Feb. 27 to March 8.
The exhibit hardly pays tribute
to Steinbeck. The display cases are
so poorly lit and Steinbeck's letters
are placed so far in the back of the
cases that one has to press one's
nose up against the glass in order
to make out any of Steinbeck's faint
hand writing. But one's squinting
eyes quickly tire of such strenuous
reading conditions, 112 urthermore,
two of the display cases are practi
cally adjacent to the restrooms.
Steinbeck was not a happy un
dergraduate at Stanford, and this
exhibit unjustly serves him and his
memory.

Post office audit a conflict of interest
Editor's note: This letter was original!y sent In Stall Tuck
er, district manager of the San Francisco Region I '.S.
Postal Service.
A growing body of evidence suggests
local and district postal officials are con
cealing severe mismanagement and pos
sible criminal acts in the Stanford substa
tion. Until this weekend, I could not
understand why Robert Reed and Masa
Sato were so hesitant to call lor an outside
investigation of the Stanford substation,
particularly when they had been present
ed with so much evidence of malfeasance
and wrongdoing. Then I learned that the
manager of customer service for Palo Alto
is Julie Reed, wife of Robert Reed.
Numerous complaints about missing
mail and packages should have been
directed to Mrs. Reed, who in turn
should have informed Mr. Sato and the
Postal Inspection Service. Yet Mr Sato
and other postal managers claim they
were unaware of all the complaints con
cerning the Stanford substation. Clearly,
Mrs. Reed is one party (among others)

who could be implicated in the missing
complaint forms. So, doesn't it seem like
a conflict of interest for her husband to
oversee an internal "investigation" that
might implicate her?
Moreover, Mr. Sato claims he had no
knowledge of the myriad of problems at
the Stanford substation. Doesn't this sug
gest he has failed to oversee the facilities
under bis direction? Yet, Mr. Sato is
essentially being allowed to investigate
himself is another c lear conflict of interest.
I he conduct of local postal service offi
cials has ranged from inept to inexcus
able. Horace Hinshaw's comments in
today's Stanford Daily were no excep
tion. 1 realize Mr. Hinshaw is a public
relations flak, and I realize it's bis job to
try to put a good spin on bad news, but
his comments in the Daily were more
than spin, in that they were blatantly
false. Mr. Hinshaw is either spreading
misinformation negligently or he is
telling bald-faced lies intentionally. Nei
ther speaks well of your office.
A few examples of Mr. Hinshaw's dis
tortions:

"There' s no evidence of wrongdoing."
I his statement seems particularly odd
since Mr. Reed is quoted in the same arti
cle as saying an incident of sexual harass
ment at the Stanford substation is cur
rently under investigation (or maybe the
postal service doesn't consider sexual
harassment to be "wrongdoing").
"We're doing that investigation
internally," Reed said. "We take
this extremely seriously. It's not
tolerated at all." Ac tually, that's not
true in that neither Mr. Reed nor
anyone under his direction is con
ducting an investigation because
they didn't bother to get the name
of the student who reported the in
cident. I know her name, and I've
taken the liberty of referring her to
the Postal Inspection Service.
I' rankly, she doesn't want to report
it to your people because she
doesn't trust them and neither do
I.
" I here's no pattern of losses or
complaints." Numerous students
attested to missing packages and
mail in the presence of Mr. Reed
and Mr. Sato at the Feb. 15, 2000
meeting at Stanford. I n the last two
days, two more students told me of
packages that arrived with the con -
tents missing. I'm receiving re
ports from all over campus that
mail from weeks ago â€” even
months ago is suddenly being
found and delivered now that the
postal service is under the gun. I
suddenly had mail show up that
was sent three-and-a-half months
ago. If there is no "pattern" of loss
es or complaints it is because offi
cials have been "losing" or "misdi
recting" all the complaints that
were sent to them. We have al
ready demonstrated that com
plaints have been sent directly to
Mr. Sato and yet he claims not to
have received them. Who's fault is

that?
"There is no evidence of a Hood
of responses to incidents." In his
garbled syntax, Mr. Ilinshaw
seems to be saying there hasn't
been a "flood" of complaints. So
how many "responses to incidents"
does it take to constitute a "flood"?
Ten, twenty, or a hundred coin
plaints isn't enough? Tell me how
many complaints 1 need to bring
you before your bureauc rats real
ize there's a bona fide problem
here.
" There's no evidence of serious
crimes, like embezzling or mail
theft." When the contents of a
package have been removed and
the package has been re-sealed
and delivered, that constitutes mail
theft. Right? Well I'll get you all the
evidence you need. Tell me when
and where you need the affidavits,
since it's obvious the postal ser
vice's "internal investigation" isn't
uncovering any of the evidence
I've found.
If you truly want to repair the
tattered relationship between the
Stanford community and the U.S.
Postal Service, you can start by
telling Mr. Hinshaw to shut his
mouth. Every time he utters such
blatant falsehoods on the front
page of our campus newspaper,
there are at least 14,000 people
who know he is full of bovine ex
crement. It is offensive that lie
should try to downplay the magni
tude of the problems here?
In his Feb. 25 letter to me, Mr.
Reed said he contacted the Postal
Inspection Service and Office of
Inspector General on Feb. 16. He
noted that these agencies indepen

dently make their decisions to in
vestigate oi audit. I am concerned
that if Mr. Reed reports the situa
tion at the Stanford substation to
these agencies like Mr. Hinshaw
misrepresents the situation to the
press, then these agencies will not
reali/e the need for an investiga
tion.
