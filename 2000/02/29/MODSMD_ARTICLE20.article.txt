Post office audit a conflict of interest
Editor's note: This letter was original!y sent In Stall Tuck
er, district manager of the San Francisco Region I '.S.
Postal Service.
A growing body of evidence suggests
local and district postal officials are con
cealing severe mismanagement and pos
sible criminal acts in the Stanford substa
tion. Until this weekend, I could not
understand why Robert Reed and Masa
Sato were so hesitant to call lor an outside
investigation of the Stanford substation,
particularly when they had been present
ed with so much evidence of malfeasance
and wrongdoing. Then I learned that the
manager of customer service for Palo Alto
is Julie Reed, wife of Robert Reed.
Numerous complaints about missing
mail and packages should have been
directed to Mrs. Reed, who in turn
should have informed Mr. Sato and the
Postal Inspection Service. Yet Mr Sato
and other postal managers claim they
were unaware of all the complaints con
cerning the Stanford substation. Clearly,
Mrs. Reed is one party (among others)

who could be implicated in the missing
complaint forms. So, doesn't it seem like
a conflict of interest for her husband to
oversee an internal "investigation" that
might implicate her?
Moreover, Mr. Sato claims he had no
knowledge of the myriad of problems at
the Stanford substation. Doesn't this sug
gest he has failed to oversee the facilities
under bis direction? Yet, Mr. Sato is
essentially being allowed to investigate
himself is another c lear conflict of interest.
I he conduct of local postal service offi
cials has ranged from inept to inexcus
able. Horace Hinshaw's comments in
today's Stanford Daily were no excep
tion. 1 realize Mr. Hinshaw is a public
relations flak, and I realize it's bis job to
try to put a good spin on bad news, but
his comments in the Daily were more
than spin, in that they were blatantly
false. Mr. Hinshaw is either spreading
misinformation negligently or he is
telling bald-faced lies intentionally. Nei
ther speaks well of your office.
A few examples of Mr. Hinshaw's dis
tortions:

"There' s no evidence of wrongdoing."
I his statement seems particularly odd
since Mr. Reed is quoted in the same arti
cle as saying an incident of sexual harass
ment at the Stanford substation is cur
rently under investigation (or maybe the
postal service doesn't consider sexual
harassment to be "wrongdoing").
