## Young returns tonight vs. SJS 
### BRETT KAUFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Second-ranked Stanford comes into tonight's contest with
San Jose State riding a wave of momentum and a four-game
winning streak, looking for encouraging signs from its injured
No. 1 starter.
Stanford ace Jason Young, who has not pitched since a Feb.
I 1 start at Florida State, will make his return to the mound this
evening. After facing just four batters in Tallahassee, Fla., he
exited the game after feeling soreness in his right shoulder.
Young's status will he the main question the Cardinal at
tempts to answer against San Jose State, which will play its third
game in two days when it travels to Sunken Diamond tonight.
More important than this mid-week nonconference game is
the health of the highly touted junior starter, who will be an in
valuable part of a championship run.
Young "feels good, the problem with his shoulder feels
good, and there's nothing seriously wrong," said head coach
Mark Marquess.
Marquess plans to pitch Young for several innings tonight
and then follow him with a committee of relievers simply to get
them more work on the mound. He also will attempt to use
Young, a first-team preseason Ail-American, in relief this week
end against Santa Clara in order to keep him fresh.
Barring a sudden complication, Young should reclaim his
spot in the regular starting rotation when USC visits Stanford
on March 17. This projection would give Young 16 out of 17
(lays rest after tonight's start in which to nurse his shoulder to
a full recovery.

Although (Cardinal pitching has been stellar of late, allowing
just seven runs in the last four games, the bats have been kept
silent. Stanford is hitting .200 as a team heading into tonight's
contest, a notably low average lor a team that boasts hitters
throughout the lineup that can hit for both average and power.
Junior right fielder Joe Borchard exemplifies the team's dis
appointing offensive performance thus far. Borchard, v\ ho en
tered the season after a 1999 campaign in which he hit .372,
conies into tonight's game at a .270 clip. Bore hard also leads
