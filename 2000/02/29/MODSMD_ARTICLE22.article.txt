# Softball claims title with sweep in Utah
## Eleventh-ranked Card runs record to 16-1 with wins at Red Desert Classic; Georgia tourney promises to be test next weekend 
### EMILY DRESSEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Three clown and one to go.
That's the story of the No. I 1 Stanford
soitball team as it awaits the last of four
consecutive tournaments after going un
defeated at tilt- Red Desert Classic in Utah
this past weekend. Hie Cardinal won live
games to improve its overall record to an
outstanding Hi-1.
Although the Cardinal started off the
weekend fairly timid, it claimed victories
against both Tulsa and Utah, 3-1 and 2-1.
"We came out pretty flat and had prob
lems hitting the ball. After playing so well,
it was sort of a wake up call, a reminder not
to take things lot granted," sophomore
first-baseman Sarah Beeson said.
I he team dominated the previous

weekend in Poway at the Campbell/Cartier
Classic and took home the first place tro
phy with a 4-1 record on the tournament.
The Stanford offense had been a force
to reckon with, even against some of the
top pitchers in the country, knocking in a
total of 28 runs on the weekend, many of
which were generated from the first in
nings of play.
It had become a Stanford trademark, a
priority, to start the game off strong, get
ahead, and let the other team choke on
their dust.
However, after two close match-ups
with Tulsa and Utah early on, such did not
appear to be the case in the Canyon Com
plex in St. Ceorge, Utah.
"We faced two really good pitchers. It
was cold and the wind was blowing. Both
teams took their time in getting going,"
head coach John Rittman said. "We kept
hitting the ball right at their players, which
only gave their pitchers more confidence.
Eventually, though, we pulled through
and adjusted to the umpire's strike zone."
The next morning, Stanford got back
on track offensively, beating No.
25 Oklahoma State 5-1 and BYU
9-4.
Sunday afternoon, the Cardi
nal dominated Utah State 7-3, se
curing an undefeated showing at
the Classic.
In the first game Friday, Tulsa
threatened in the second inning
after scoring one and loading up
the bases with no outs.
Freshman pitcher Jaime For
man-Lau was as composed as
ever and smothered the Golden
Hurricane's rally with two con
secutive strike-outs and an easy
pop fly to second to get the Car
dinal out of the inning.
However, the players found
themselves faced with an unfa
miliar task at hand, to come from
behind and get on the board.
After four quiet innings at the
plate, junior Ramona Shelburne
got things started with a RBI shot
that bounced off the center-field
wall, which she stretched into a
triple.
Later in the inning, sopho
more shortstop Robin Walker
followed Shelburne's lead and
smashed a rope down the third
base line to drive in two more.
Freshman pitcher Maureen
LeCocq capped off mound duty
in the seventh and held Tulsa to
one run.
During the Utah game, Shel
burne was again the offensive
queen, scoring the tying run and
batting 1.000 for the day.
Dana Sorensen threw a com
plete game and struck out 12 Ute
batters, a new career high for the
freshman pitcher.
The team scored one off
LeCocq's base hit in the first
game Saturday against the Cow
girls.
Senior catcher Kellie Wigin
ton started the fourth inning off
on the right four with a single
down the right-field line. The
Cardinal processed to bunting its
way around the bases and capi
talized on several Oklahoma er
rors to bring the score to 5-1.
Saturday, Sorensen was the
commander in the circle for six
innings, holding the Cowgirls to
one hit and striking out five. Like
the previous day, LeCocq pol
ished off a scoreless seventh in
ning from the mound.
"We like to put our pitchers in
different situations and utilize
their individual strengths,"
Rittman said. "Each pitcher
brings something a little differ
ent to the field. Yet, they all com
pliment each other very well. If
the other team is on to one of our
pitchers, we'll throw someone
else in to mix things up a bit."
Freshman pitcher Tori Ny
berg got her first start in college
softball against BYU and went a
strong six innings, before For
man-Lau entered in the seventh,
striking out three, as her relief.

Balls were scaling the outfield
fence off Stanford swings in the
second game, giving Nyberg
some offensive support. Junior
Jenni Shideler clobbered her sec
ond home-run of the season in
the second as sophomore center
fielder Jessica Mendoza racked
up her fourth of the year in the
bottom of the fourth inning.
Stanford, back in the habit,
started off strong, scoring two in
the top of the first with help from
Mendoza, Shelburne and Walk
er.
Overall, the Cardinal offen
sive was merciless with Mendoza,
who went 2 for 2, Shelburne (2
for 3) and Walker (3 for 3), along
with Beeson, who drove in four
of Stanford's seven runs.
The Aggies struggled against
three Stanford pitchers:
Sorensen, LeCocq (who entered
in the fourth) and Nyberg, who
relieved two innings later.
Sorensen, now 8-1 with 32.2 in
nings under her belt, earned the
win.
In those innings, Sorensen
has held the opposition to a mere
12 hits and two earned runs, im
pressive statistics considering
four of the teams she has thrown
against have been on the Nation
al Fastpitch Coaches' Association
ranking poll.
To most people, a record of
16-1 and an undefeated week
end would seem pretty exem
plary. However, Wiginton un
derstands the importance of al
ways looking for areas that need
improving.
"This weekend we didn't play
up to the level of our abilities,"
Wiginton said. "We need to keep
our focus, pick an particular as
pect of the game that needs work
and do it. I bis next weekend will
be an excellent opportunity for
us to do that."
Rittman agrees.
"Our team has been winning.
That's good, but we don't want to
be content. We have lots of room
for improvement. Our pitching
has been solid which takes the
pressure off offensively.
"But, defensively we have had
a lot of letdowns. We have this
tendency to play to our oppo
nent's level. A team needs to have
its own intensity and motiva
tion."
Come Friday when the Cardi
nal kicks off play in Columbus,
Ga., in the NFCA Leadoff Clas
sic, the nation will see what the
Stanford softball team is really
made of.
In is its last gasp in a series of
four straight tournaments, this
next weekend will determine
how it matches up to the best
teams around the country.
"Georgia will be an especially
tough tournament," Walker
said. "Many of the top 25 teams
will be there and I know we are
slotted to play Oklahoma and a
talented University of Massachu
setts team."
