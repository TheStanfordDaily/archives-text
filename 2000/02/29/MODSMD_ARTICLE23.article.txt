## 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
UCIA forward Jaßon Rush, suspended since De
cember for violating NCAA rules, is coining back just in
time lor the Bruins.
UCLA athletic director Peter Dalis announced yes
terday that the sophomore will be elgible lor the first
time in 24 games this Saturday when UCLA, on the
brink of missing the NCAA Tournament for the lirst
time since 1988, takes on No. 1 Stanford at Maples Pavil
ion.
I he NCAA had originally suspended Rush Feb. I lor
a total of 29 games, reportedly for taking $6,525 fie tin an
AAU coach in high school and another $200 from an
agent last season in violation of stringent NCAA rules.
Yesterday the NCAA finally acted on UCLA's appeal
of that suspension, reducing it to nine games. Before this
suspension began, Rush had already been forced to sit
out 15 games by UCIA as it investigated the situation.
According to the school, UCIA is working with Rush,
a sophomore who was averaging I 1.7 points and 4.3 re
hounds per game prior to the suspension, on a schedule
lor him to repay the money.
Rush and U( II A, on the other hand, can never be re

paid lor his time in street clothes. Without its leading re
bounder and third-leading scorer Ironi a year ago, the
legendary Bruins (15-11, 0-8 Pacific 10 Conference)
have struggled this season and probably need to win at
least three of their final lour games to even make the
tournament they have won a record I I times.
Thursday UCLA plays California, another team
lighting to get into the tournament, in Berkeley. Satur
day the Bruins take on Stanford, and the following
weekend Pac-10 cellar dwellers W ashington and Wash
ington State head south to West wood.
Meanwhile Stanford (24-1, 13-1), tied with Arizona
for first place in the conference and lighting hard for a
top seed in the tournament, is probably not too excited
about providing Rush such a large stage lor his return.
In his only appearance at Maples, Rush scored 20 points
and pulled down II rebounds last year as I CIA fell to
Stanford by four points.
Rush's suspension was one of many well-publicized
cases this year in the NCAA. Former AAU teammates
Kareent Rush (Jaßon's brother and a freshman at Mis
souri) and Andre Williams of ()klahoma State, have also
been suspended for games this year. So have St. John's
Krick Barkley, Michigan's jamal
Crawford, Cincinnati's Dermarr
Johnson and Anhiirn s Chris Porter,
who was suspended Sunday forsup
posedlv taking over $2,000 from an
agent lasi week.
Crawford and Porter could both
potent ialh be out for tlie rest of the
season.
Stanford did get some good
news vesterday, though, I he latest
Associated Press poll lists the (Cardi
nal .is ,i consensus No. 1, making
Stanford the first team to garner
every first-place vote in the poll
since North Carolina on Dec. 22.
