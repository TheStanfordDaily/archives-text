School records dropped like flies this weekend at the

of 142 points, 48 more than second place Arizona. The
No. 9 women took second with I Hi points.
"Our athletes scored in almost every event, they
broke several school records, and we had many NCAA
qualifying performances, said head coach \ in Lanan
na. "It was a great overall team effort that will serve us
well in the outdoor season."
I lie men and women combined to produce four
new provisional and three new automatic NCAA quali
fying times to the NCAA Indoor Championship March
10-11 at the University of Arkansas. In their efforts, five
athletes broke Stanford indoor records.
The Cardinal has now automatically qualified seven
athletes to the NCAA Indoor Championships along
with the men's and women's distance medley relay
teams. The teams have also provisionally qualified 23
athletes.
"I think [the MPSF meet] lets us we are
ready to compete well in a championship meet,"
Lananna s;iid. I look lorward to a strong Stanford
presence at'the N( A Vs.
