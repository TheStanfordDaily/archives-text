I lie Stanford women's swimming and diving
team snapped a 13-year tradition of dominance
this weekend when it placed second at the Pacific
10 Conference championships for the first time
ever.
I lie Cardinal h;ft won each of the 13 previous
Pac-I() championships and has placed in the top
live ;it the N( IAA c hampionships lor more than 10
years in a rov\.
I his weekend in Long Beach, however, the
(iardinal was not able to keep the streak alive. Ari
zona dominated the meet Irom da\ one, and was
able to secure the victory with 1,325 points. Stan
lord earned 1,11)7 points to take second, followed
closely b\ (lalifbrnia, which placed third (1.1 S2).
Depth killed the Cardinal at the meet. I bis year,
2 I swiminers per team were all<>wed to compete for
points, compared to I (Sin previous years. I he Car
dinal took only 14 swimmers to Long Beach.
"We definitely felt the loss," sophomore Jessica
lose hi said. "This year marked the end of a long
winning streak lor Stanford, but it is not a big blow
to our team. I his meet is harder for us to win than
NCAAs because there are fewer teams. At NCAAs,

the points will be spread out among many more
teams, so we should have a good shot at the title."
The coaching staff was similarly affected by the
weekend.
"Depth plays a large role in the Pac-10 champi
onships, and the other teams just had more num
bers than we did," saitl assistant coach Ross Gerry.
"But we had a very good meet."
Foschi had an outstanding meet, earning victo
ries (or the Cardinal in both tlu* 500 yard freestyle
(4:40.37) and the 1650 freestyle (16:12.16). Fos
( hi s 500 freestyle time was the fastest in the nation
this year. Foschi also placed third in the 200
freestyle behind junior Lauren I hies, who took
second in the event. Foschi's three swims were all
lifetime bests.
Senior co-captain Catherine Fox was another
double-winner for the Cardinal. She defended her
50 freestyle title for the third year in a row (22.76)
and also won the 100 freestyle (49.37).
In a display of Stanford's backstroking domi
nance, sophomore Shelly Ripple won the 100 back
stroke (53.20) as Fox took second (53.31). Ripple fin
ished the meet with as much gusto as she began it,
taking first in the 200 butterfly (1:56.50) and second

the last day of the meet. Junior
Misty Hynian placed third in both
events.
The diving team also had a suc -
cessful weekend. Junior Ki in Sones
won the three-meter springboard
event with 486.67 points. She also
placed second in the one-meter
event and took fourth in the plat
form. Freshman Mc Reuse Murph\
also gained points for the Cardinal,
placing second in the platform and
third in the three-meter.
"It was a great team effort, but
our best meet is still to come," Ross
said. "We are going to be looking
great at NCAAs in two weeks. If we
swim like we swam this weekend,
we will be in the hunt for the na
tional championship."
