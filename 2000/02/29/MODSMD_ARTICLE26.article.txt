# Golfers test themselves against flurry of tough competition at SW Intercollegiate
## 
### MATT LONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I! playing against the best coin
petition forces a team to raise its
level, then the Stanford men's golf
squad should prove to Ir* at the
peak of its game iu no time at all.
Last week, the 12th ranked Car
dinal traveled to Hawaii to face
eight top 25 teams. The result was
an eighth-place finish and the
emergence of sophomore Philip
Rowe, who finished tied for sev
enth place.
Rowe is back today as Stanford
competes in the Southwestern In
tercollegiate at North Ranch Coun
try Club in Westlake. The tourna

ment features nine top 25 teams,
including No. 8 Arizona State,
which boasts Paul Casey, the top
ranked collegiate golfer.
Stanford played 36 holes yester
day and concludes with 18 more
today. *
Two freshmen qualified to play,
Ron Won and George Downing.
Downing beat out junior Alex
Aragon to secure the last spot in the
tournament, his first since coming
to Stanford.
"I am thrilled that two freshman
are going," said head coach YVally
Goodwin. "They earned their way
in there. George won the playoff
and all year long he's been one shot
behind. I fe is well rounded and ag

gressive with a good junior record,
and I have good hopes for them
both."
With all the rain on campus the
past week, practice has been diffi
cult to squeeze in between show
ers. The team has been unable to
practice anything but the short
game since returning from
Hawaii. None of this matters in
Southern California though, as
North Ranch is a very challenging
course.
"It is a very demanding golf
course and we will have to drive the
ball well," Goodwin said. "It's been
muddy here, but we should be just
fine."
Stanford will also bring along se

nior Dusty Brett and junior Jimmy
Lee, ranked 49th and 66th respec
tively. These two should provide
the veteran leadership and consis
tent play the team needs to succeed
and realize its goal of a berth in the
NCIAA Championships.
"We need to play well as the sea
son goes to crunch time," Rowe
said. "These tournaments are all
practice runs leading up to the
NCSA's."
The Cardinal has faced every
team it will see this weekend before
with the exceptions of No. 7 BYU
and No. 24 Oklahoma. The caliber
of competition will be familiar as
will the players, eight of whom are
ranked in the top 50.
