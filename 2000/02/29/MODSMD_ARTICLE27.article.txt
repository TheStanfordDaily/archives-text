game-tying goal by pi'tuiig up a
lob from the with three
seconds lef' of the third.
Both teams remained scoreless
in the fourth quarter, bringing on
two quarters of overtime. Fresh
men Julie Gardner scored the
only Cardinal goal in overtime, al
lowing Cal to pull off a 8-7 victory.
"YVe had a disappointing loss
against Cal," said team co-captain
junior Hilary Gallogly. "While we
played decent fundamental water
polo, we had some holes in our de
fense that they capitalized on. We
also missed some scoring opportu
nities in the fourth quarter that
could have put away the game."
Dingeldein led the scoring
against California with two goals.
Juniors Kris Koblik, Anne-Marie
Keenan and Ali Riddell, sopho
more Kate Pettit and Gardner all
added one.
In the 5-4 upset of top-ranked

logly and freshman Amy Light
ner, held All-American and na
tional team player Catherine von
Schwartz scoreless. Dingeldein
led the Cardinal scoring with two
goals. Koblik, Pettit and Gardner
each contributed one.
"We really came together in

the UCLA game and played great
defense, forcing them out of their
game," Gallogly said. "Our setters
did a fantastic job the entire week
end of scoring the ball and assist
ing perimeter players."
Stanford setters Pettit, Gard
ner and junior Kelly Shouey pro
vided the base for the Cardinal of
fense. The setters contributed
many of the Cardinal's goals, gave
several assists and drew player
ejections against their defenders
creating 6-on-5 scoring opportu
nities for Stanford.
On the first day of the tourna
ment Stanford routed Loyola
Marymount 13-2 and conquered
the San Jose Spartans 10-7.
Against Loyola Marymount,
junior Dani Bell and Gardner
each scored 3 goals. Dingeldein
added two and Pettit. Koblik, Rid
dell, Gallogly and freshman
Nicole Huszcz all put away one.
Pettit, Dingeldein and Gardner
all had two goals against the Spar
tans. Bell added one.
"It is disappointing to finish sec
ond, but we keep improving, and
that is what is most important," Rid
dell said. "We get l>etter and better
with every game we play. We have
a long way to go until May, but we
are on the right track."
Stanford will now focus on its
game with USC in Los Angeles
Friday. It will be Stanford's sec
ond Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration game this season. USC is
currently No. 2 and is expected to
put up an intense fight.
"Overall, we're starting to de
velop the flow that only comes
from playing as a team against op
ponents," Gallogly said. "This
week we'll focus specifically on the
USC game on Friday. We need to
be mentally prepared to play ex
tremely physical water polo."
