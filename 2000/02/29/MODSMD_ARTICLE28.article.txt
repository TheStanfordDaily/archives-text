### ALEX BENJAMIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford wrestling team
came back from the Pacific 10
Conference Championships at
I C-Davis falling short of what it
had hoped lo accomplish as a
team. * .
Of the 10 wrestlers who com
peted this weekend, head coach
Chris I lot pel had hoped to send
three to five to the NCAA Cham
pionships in March .md finish
somewhere in the middle of the
Pac-10 as a team. At the end of the
two day tournament, the Cardinal
emerged seventh as a team and
qualified two wrestlers to compete
.it the NCIAAs.
There were positive results to
this weekend. The major accom
plishment came from senior co
captain Zach Zimmerer (Im
pounds), who won his first Pac-10
championship.
Zimmerer finished fourth his
freshman year and second the
past two years. By qualifying again
this year, it makes him the only
Cardinal wrestler in history to
make it to the NCAA Champi
onships four straight years.

"Zach wrestled a perfect tour
nament. I le was calm in all of his
matches, and there was never any
question at the end as to who the
better wrestler was," said senior
Clay Hackerman (165). "Nobody
could stand up to him. He was just
better and tougher than everyone
else."
Another positive note of the
weekend came from the other co
captain, senior Warren McPher
son (157). Forced to miss last
year's Pac-lOs due to an injury, he
was able to make it as one of three
wild card finishers this year.
In each of the 10 weight classes,
the top four finishers automatic al
ly qualify for the NCAAs. McPher
son was chosen by the coaches as a
fifth-place finisher to represent
the Pac-10 in the national tourna
ment.
()ne of the biggest surprises on
the weekend came from senior
Rudy Ruiz, who failed to qualify.
An NCAA qualifier for the past
two years, Ruiz lost two tough
matches against Boise State's K.C.
Rock, who won the tournament,
and Cal-State Fullerton'sT.J. Hill,
who finished third.
