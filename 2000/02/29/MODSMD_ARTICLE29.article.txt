The Stanford men's gymnastics team re
turned to campus late Friday night after
traveling* Boo miles in two days, competing
twice in 24 hours and still managing to keep
a glimmer of NCAA Championship hope
alive.
On Thursday night, No. 13 Stanford (6-6,
6-6 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) flew
to L.A. to compete in the UCIA Invitational
against No. 19 UC-Santa Barbara (0-9, 0-9)
and No. 21 Arizona State. Although Stan

lord was inconsistent and struggled on many
events, the team easily won with a final score
of 217.90.
"[Thursday night] was a rough meet for
us," said senior Ail-American Jason Katsam
pes.
One of the only bright spots for the Car
dinal was the outstanding vaulting perfor
mance of freshman Matt McLean. Mc'Lean
landed his vault for the first time ever in
competition and received a 9.55 and third
place honors for bis efforts.
Immediately after Thursday's competi
tion, the team rushed out of the arena to

catch a plane at Los Angeles International
Airport just 45 minutes later. The Cardinal
did make that plane, thanks to a one-hour
delay.
Tired and jet-lagged, the Cardinal squad
traveled to Berkeley on Friday afternoon to
face No. 5 California and No. 9 BYU in a tri
meet.
The Cardinal was shaky in the competi
tion and tallied a 223.05 team score. This was
good enough to defeat BYU's 218.20, but
was short of California's impressive 228.60.
