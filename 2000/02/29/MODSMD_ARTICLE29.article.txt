# Gymnasts survive whirlwind weekend, beat BYU and UCSB to aid NCAA hopes
## 
### SCOTT FINKELSTEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's gymnastics team re
turned to campus late Friday night after
traveling* Boo miles in two days, competing
twice in 24 hours and still managing to keep
a glimmer of NCAA Championship hope
alive.
On Thursday night, No. 13 Stanford (6-6,
6-6 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) flew
to L.A. to compete in the UCIA Invitational
against No. 19 UC-Santa Barbara (0-9, 0-9)
and No. 21 Arizona State. Although Stan

lord was inconsistent and struggled on many
events, the team easily won with a final score
of 217.90.
"[Thursday night] was a rough meet for
us," said senior Ail-American Jason Katsam
pes.
One of the only bright spots for the Car
dinal was the outstanding vaulting perfor
mance of freshman Matt McLean. Mc'Lean
landed his vault for the first time ever in
competition and received a 9.55 and third
place honors for bis efforts.
Immediately after Thursday's competi
tion, the team rushed out of the arena to

catch a plane at Los Angeles International
Airport just 45 minutes later. The Cardinal
did make that plane, thanks to a one-hour
delay.
Tired and jet-lagged, the Cardinal squad
traveled to Berkeley on Friday afternoon to
face No. 5 California and No. 9 BYU in a tri
meet.
The Cardinal was shaky in the competi
tion and tallied a 223.05 team score. This was
good enough to defeat BYU's 218.20, but
was short of California's impressive 228.60.
"On Friday we showed the po
tential for a very high team
score," said sophomore David
Durante. "We ended up with only
a 223 because we had some mis
takes that were very costly."
Stanford started the meet off
on a good note with an above-av
erage pommel horse perfor
mance. Durante led the Cardinal
with a solid 9.80 and was closely
followed by Katsmapes' 9.75.
The Cardinal moved to the
rings next and gave its usual
strong performance. Katsampes
posted a career-high 9.95 on the
event. Freshman strong-man
Marshall Erwin scored a 9.65, ju
nior co-captain Rico Andrade
added a 9.5, and senior co-cap
tain Craig Nesbitt rounded out

the Cardinal scores with a 9. 15.
Stanford struggled a bit on
floor, averaging just under a 9.2
on the event. Parallel bars came
next, and the team did quite well.
Redshirt freshman Cade Raggio
led Stanford with a season-high
score of 9.7.
The team then moved to high
bar and fell apart. This event has
been a trouble spot all season
long, and Friday's meet was no
exception.
katsampes and Raggio posted
Stanford's only scores above a 9
on the event, scoring a 9.5 and
9.15 respectively. Cardinal gym
nasts missed release moves and
faltered to tally a team score of just
35.35.
"We just cannot seem to hit
[high bar]," Nesbitt said. "T his
event has plagued us all season
and we have to figure out a way to
do better."
Stanford finished up the meet

on vault and Nesbitt nailed his
vault, a layed-out handspring
front, for an impressive 9.8. Un
fortunately for the Cardinal, it was
not enough to reverse the effects of
high bar, and the team was forced
to settle for a disappointing
223.05.
Stanford has just one home
meet remaining before the post
season.
"Our next meet is an impor
tant one for us and everyone
knows it," Durante said.
In order for the Cardinal
squad to qualify to NCAA Cham
pionships, it must post a very high
score at its last home meet next
weekend and at the M I\SV (cham
pionships in three weeks.
"Right now we are on the bor
der of making it to NCAAs and we
put ourselves in this position."
Duranted said. "We have to stay
very focused and we can't give
up."
