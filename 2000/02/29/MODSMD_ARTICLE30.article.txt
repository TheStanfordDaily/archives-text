The Stanford women's lacrosse team's (1-1,
1-1 Western Women's lacrosse League) motto
should be that of the U.S. Postal Service, some
thing along the lines of "In wind, rain and
snow, we deliver."
Deliver it did against California (1-1, 0-1
WWLL) on Saturday night, winning 6-3 de
spite less-than-ideal weather conditions. Stan
ford did not let the cold or the rain that began

pouring down in the second halfdistract it from
the goal at hand: proving that despite its loss to
UC-Davis in the season opener, it will indeed be
a force to be reckoned with in the WWLL this
year.
Stanford's aggressive play in the midfield
and on defense, as well its control of the pace of
the game, proved it did not let the lessons from
its loss against Davis fall by the wayside.
By employing high-pressure double teams
when Cal had the ball, the Cardinal kept the
Bears on their heels all evening. This led to

Stanford's ability to dictate the tempo of the
match and that, in addition to crisp passing and
few turnovers, provided it many offensive op
portunities.
In the first half, the Cardinal came out ex
tremely aggressive but struggled to convert its
offensive pressure into goals, repeatedly miss
ing to the sides or off the bar. The teams traded
goals back and forth on several occasions, with
Stanford going up only to see Cal even the score
minutes later.
