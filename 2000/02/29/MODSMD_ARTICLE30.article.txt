The Stanford women's lacrosse team's (1-1,
1-1 Western Women's lacrosse League) motto
should be that of the U.S. Postal Service, some
thing along the lines of "In wind, rain and
snow, we deliver."
Deliver it did against California (1-1, 0-1
WWLL) on Saturday night, winning 6-3 de
spite less-than-ideal weather conditions. Stan
ford did not let the cold or the rain that began

pouring down in the second halfdistract it from
the goal at hand: proving that despite its loss to
UC-Davis in the season opener, it will indeed be
a force to be reckoned with in the WWLL this
year.
Stanford's aggressive play in the midfield
and on defense, as well its control of the pace of
the game, proved it did not let the lessons from
its loss against Davis fall by the wayside.
By employing high-pressure double teams
when Cal had the ball, the Cardinal kept the
Bears on their heels all evening. This led to

Stanford's ability to dictate the tempo of the
match and that, in addition to crisp passing and
few turnovers, provided it many offensive op
portunities.
In the first half, the Cardinal came out ex
tremely aggressive but struggled to convert its
offensive pressure into goals, repeatedly miss
ing to the sides or off the bar. The teams traded
goals back and forth on several occasions, with
Stanford going up only to see Cal even the score
minutes later.
Junior Katherine Barnes finally
put the Cardinal ahead for good,
scoring oil'an artful assist from se
nior Hedy Born with only 15 sec
onds left in the half.
Ihe Cardinal dominated the
second hall, shutting out Cal while
talk ing two more goals of its own,
both by sophomore Caroline Os
terwise. As the rain started coming
down harder and harder, it
seemed to only foster more deter
mination in the Stanford squad to
lock down the Bears and prevent
them from getting back in the
game.
Strong team defense and the
solid play of 112 reshman goalkeeper
Rachael Neumann, who notched
seven saves for the game, kept the
Bears from mounting any sort of

rally and wrapped up the Cardi
nal's first win of the season.
For Stanford, Osterwise,
Barnes, Born and sophomore Li/
Britt combined their speed and ag
gressiveness to propel the team on
offense. Overall, however, it was a
true team effort as each Cardinal
player performed well on both of
fense and defense.
For Cal, the bright spot in the
loss was freshman goalie Eden
Coelho, who almost single-hand
edly kept the Bears in the game
with 16 saves.
After it was all over, the Stan
ford team expressed its satisfaction
with its play and optimism for im
provement in the future.
" 1 think it speaks to the character
of our team," sophomore Cinda
McClelland said, "that we were able
to regroup after last week, figure
out our problems and address them
immediately, which I think really
showed in our game against Cal."
