### PADMA SUNDARAM 
Sssh ... The year 2000 is here.
And we still inch to work on
crowded asphalt with our windows
rolled up against the fumes from
idling exhausts. But cheer up. A
new generation of clean cars is

coming to a showroom near you

Motor vehicles consume half of
the world's oil and account for a
quarter of the greenhouse-gas
emissions, according to Scientific
American. The biggest source of
air pollution in a majority of the
world's cities is auto exhaust.
As we enter the 20th Century,

new car registrations skyrocket
and the number of miles the aver
age person drives each year rises.
Unless something changes, the
concentration of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere is expected to
reach it highest level in 50 million
years by the year 2100. This could
wreak havoc on global weather
patterns.

Despite the grim state of affairs,
there is much reason for hope.
New technologies oiler an alterna
tive to the swift onset of global
warming. The solutions will in
volve embracing new sources of
energy and making the old ones
cleaner and more efficient.
Carmakers are now beginning
to offer vehicles that not only great

ly reduce pollution but also per
form more efficiently, travel far
ther and last longer than anything
we've ever seen.

Laws in California now re-

quire that 10 percent of all

cars sold by the year 2003
need to be zero-emission

vehicles. Designed to re
<l me air pollution.

these laws require
that vehicles do not

emit exhaust that is
Jill J;
harmful to the envi-

ronment. Under the
new laws, the annual

sales of zero-emission
vehicles are expected
to surpass 200,000 in
California by 2003.

In order to help meet
this demand, America's Big
Three automakers — Ford,
Chrysler and General Motors —
have formed the "Partnership for a
New Generation of Vehicles" to
spur development of alternative
vehicle technology. Their long
term goal is to develop vehicles that
will deliver up to three times
greater fuel efficiency and cost no
more to own and operate than
today's midsize family sedan.
For those of you out there who

want to drive your very own
"green" vehicle, there are a lot of
options — electric battery powered

cars,
hybrid cars

which use both gas and electricity,

solar cars, fuel-cell cars and

many more. Some of these
options are currently avail
able while others are still

concept vehicles. Here are
some options available for
those who want an eco
friendly ride to work.

Electric cars and the Tzero
An electric vehicle, or an EV, is
propelled by an electric motor and
an electronic control module. The
main reason to drive an electric car
is an ecological one. Compared to
gas-powered cars, EVs do not pro
duce harmful exhaust and are
much quieter when idle. Thus they
can help reduce air and traffic
noise pollution.
EVs do have unique battery
maintenance requirements, how
ever. On a single charge, an EV can
travel only 40 to 60 miles. Because
of the limited range of the EV, it is
presently not possible to address
the consumer need for extended
travel range.
However, if you're an enthusiast
with a checkbook and a flair for
high performance sports cars, then
you should definitely look at the
Tzero, an electric sports car manu
factured by AC Propulsion Corpo
ration of San Dimas, California.

File Tzero is one of the

world's fastest and most effi
cient cars. In a recent series of im
promptu 1/8 mile races held at
Moffet Field in Mountain View,
California, the Tzero out-per
formed a Ferrari F355, a new
Corvette and a Porsche Carrera 4.
It can accelerate to 60 mph in 4.1
seconds and has zero emissions. It
makes less noise than some of the
most luxurious cars out there and
of course, it is electric.
The Tzero has a superb driving
feel that is direct, linear and imme
diate. It has an ultra-rigid chassis,
which provides an excellent foun
dation for the adjustable four
wheel double wishbone suspen
sion.
It also has a 200 HP premium
copper-rotor AC induction motor
and a 200 k\V on-board charger.
This enables easy recharging of the
batteries. Few other streetcars pro
vide comparable levels of effortless

and accessible performance.
"The Tzero has proved its per
formance early on. We're aiming
to start a low-volume production
run soon," said Tom Gage, Vice-
President of ACPropulsion Corpo
ration.
"Building a high-end sports car
is the best way to make electric cars
popular," Gage said. "The big car
makers feel that hybrids and elec
tric vehicles are an unwarranted
diversion and make marketing
non-elforts, which makes it diffi
cult to mass-produce electric cars,"
he said.
The role of big companies

of EVs will require a confluence of

political factors that transform them
into an attractive choice for con-

sumers.
M isconc eptions abound
about electric cars. They're slow.
They're inconvenient. They're too
limited in range. Granted, some of

these criticisms aren't totally unfounded
But they clo have a way of distorting reality
as well as ignoring technological innova
lions.

Some say the big carmakers are not se
rious about building cleaner, less polluting
and more fuel-efficient vehicles. Jt seems that
initially, the major car companies were
stonewalling and resisting building clean cars
despite a widespread public demand for
them.

Auto and oil companies killed the 1998 Califor
nia mandate that required 2 percent of the cars
011 the road in California to be zero-emission.
Hut despite the auto industry's efforts to dis
parage and discourage electric vehicles, there
have been some c hanges in attitude. A lot of big
automakers are now working on electric tech-

nologies and vehicles. I he race is now on to see
who can build the cleanest, most efficient automo-

bile in the world.
Companies such as Toyota, Honda, Ford and Daimler

('.hrysler are workingon "hybrid" cars that have two engines

one gas powered and the other electric. This successfully
combines the speed and range of a gas-fueled car with the eco-friendly
benefits ol an electric one.
I his is shaping up to be one of the most profound and sweeping
( hanges in automotive design since the descent of the internal combus
tion engine.

Fuel cells

A UVI Wild
While the high cost of electric
cars limits buyers to corporate
and government customers,
hybrid cars have definitely

gained the favor of ordinary
car buyers. But there is still

much work to do. Hybrid
cars are heavy, due in
part to their large nickel
hydride battery packs.
The market now awaits

the arrival of lighter fuel
celled cars.

In a fuel cell, hydro
gen and oxygen are
combined to produce
i electricity and water.

This is great for the
environment. But the
biggest problem is
that fuel cells are still
too expensive. One

kev reason is that not
enough are being made to

allow economics of scale.
America's first fuel-cell car made its street debut in early 1998. It ear
lies two people, runs at ;i top speed ol 35 mph and has a range ot 30
miles. It ( an he refueled in two minutes and emits no exhaust other than
water vapor. I lie cai is a cherry-red, pint-sized coupe, produced at
I lumboldt State University's Sc hat/ Kncrgy Research Center
I n March 1999, Daimler (Chrysler unveiled the N HCAR 4 — a fuel-cell
vcliic le that can reach a top speed of 90 miles per hour, travel nearly 280
miles on a lill up and can carry up to five passengers.
Ihe NH( AR I — short for New Klec trie (lar, is based on a Mercedes-
Ben/ compact car. It is ;i big breakthrough in fuel cell technology because
it contains a very powerful fuel cell sys-

tem, which is small enough to be

packaged in a compact car.

I he NKCAR 4 how-

ever uses

liquid hydrogen fuel, which must Ik- stored at cold tem-

peratures. I his makes it ;m impractical fuel. Daimler

Chryslei therefore plans to replace this concept car with
NKCAR X. which will union methanol. Daimler ( .In ysler hopes to have
the cars in production hy 2004.
()ther companies including Ford Motor. (ieneral Motors, Toyota and
I loncla ;ilso hope to market fuel cell vehicles In 2004.
Solar cars
The sun will be around lor some time, at least considerably longer
than the projected 100-year supply of remaining fossil fuels. And solar
energy is definitely ;i viable resource, especially here in (California.

The Stanford Solar Car Project was started in 1989 by a group of Stan
ford engineering students, a visiting professor and a wandering gradu
ate student. For the past two years, the SSCP has been collaborating with
CalSol, the Solar Vehicle Project at UC-Beikeley.
The past solar cars include the SUnSurfer, the Sunßurner, the After
burner and the After Burner 11. I heSUnSurfer was Stanford Solar's first
car. The Sunßurner was the next solar car, which had a revolutionary
design, incorporating a parabolic concentrator on high efficiency cells,
which was later scrapped for a more conventional design.
Along with similar teams in universities across the country, the SSCP
competes in national and international solar car competitions, such as
Sunrayce and the World Solar Challenge in Australia
The team is currently in the process of designing its fifth generation
solar vehicle. "We want to try something new," said Joel Segre, a junior.
"We feel it's time to make the jump from evolutionary design to revolu
tionary design."
Nitrogen-powered car
So how about a car that runs on air, doesn't poison the atmosphere
and cleans up air pollution? This does sound too good to be true. But
that's what engineers at the University of Washington are trying to de
velop.
The LN2OOO car is a brainchild of Abe Hertzberg, professor emeritus
of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the university. He and his colleagues
have set out to create a better alternative to gas-powered vehicles. The
LN2OOO uses liquid nitrogen as fuel and generates no harmful emissions.
In the EN2OOO, high pressure nitrogen gas is fed to an engine which
converts pressure into mechanical power. The only exhaust is nitrogen,
and since 78 percent of the atmosphere is already nitrogen, the environ
mental effect of driving LN2OOO vehicles is virtually undetectable. Eco
logically this is a dream come true.
Funded by a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy, the LN2OOO
project team has built a prototype from a converted mail truck. From the
outside, the vehicle looks much like any other postal truck on the road.
However, instead of generating plumes of foul exhaust, the LN2OOO
emits cold nitrogen gas, which freezes water vapor in the air to form small
clouds behind the vehicle.
.As of now, the motor used in the LN2OOO prototype gives gas guzzling
a new meaning by consuming about five gallons of nitrogen fuel per mile.
Plus, it musters a top speed of only 22 mph and chugs laboriously up hills.
But there is still a lot of room for improvement and when ready, the im
plementation of a large fleet of LN2OOO vehicles could prove to be ex
tremely beneficial to the environment.
Electric dragsters
You've probably heard of "drag strips," "dragsters" and "drag rac
ing." If you haven't, then you probably wonder — what is drag racing
anyways?
The premise of drag racing is simple — two cars race in a straight line
for a distance of 1,320 feet. Although the premise is linear, the approach
to these contests has become increasingly abstract and bizarre.
Aesthetics aside, the main objective here is the speed achieved. And in
order to satisfy their thirst for speed, speed and more speed, out of con
trol mechanical savants sculpt strange looking cars called dragsters.
To complement the car's unorthodox appearance, the motors and the
fuel are exotic. A basic car engine is now supercharged or injected, and
the fuel is maximum octane airplane fuel, methanol or the highly volatile
nitro methane.
"The drag racing scene is not taking off like crazy, but it is gaining
more and more interest," said Otmar Ebenhoech, a local Palo Alto resi
dent who builds racing motor controllers for electric dragsters. "There
are lot of drag racing hobbyists and a typical drag race would have
around 20 electric dragsters and around 100 gas-powered cars. One
might also see street legal cars like the Mazda RX7 which is an electric,"
Ebenhoech said.
There are annual drag races held in Oregon, Colorado and Phoenix.
The one in Phoenix called the Desert Kilowatt Challenge will be held
next month. This will be exciting as top contenders compete and set new
records in the process.
Dennis Berube from Arizona owns the world's quickest electric drag
ster, the Current Eliminator 11. It can accelerate from 0 to 140 mph in
8.7 seconds. Dennis offers a $ 1,000 reward to anyone who can beat him
in a quarter mile drag race. No one has yet claimed the prize.
All in all, electric dragsters are fun and exciting and get your adren
aline pumping. This is a great way to popularize EVs. Soon, you'll want
one too.
Three-wheeled electric vehicles

Alter the general buzz about electric cars, hybrid cars and fuel-cell
cars, we come to tilting three wheeled F Ys. I hree-wheeled vehicles lean
properly in curves, unlike conventional cars, allowing them to take
tighter turns. They can zoom around corners like motorcycles and can
also seat a passenger beside the driver. There are also other benefits —

they are more economical and beneficial to the environment.

It was designed
by Larry Ed-

in spacecraft and cut-

ting-edge inter-city and

urban transit systems.
"1 am very confident about

the future of leaning vehicles, which will

necessarily be three-wheeled ones rather than four-wheeled ones. Two
wheeled ones lean just fine hut haven't figured out in a century how to
enclose them against the weather and to be safer for occupants,' Ed
wards said.
"The most obvious use for the three wheelers is in neighborhoods
and resorts. Also if such a vehicle caught on with teenagers, it would
be very cool," Edwards said. "Also these vehicles have traits that are
advantageous to teenagers who want to drive fast," he said.
Mercedes-Ben/ introduced its tilting three-wheel prototype, the
F3OO, and claimed that it "blended the special thrill and cornering dy
namics of a motorcycle with the safety and comfort of a sedan."
Other tilling three wheelers include C.M's lean machine, BMW's CI
and the Sparrow, developed by CorbinMotors.com.
