# High-tech cars gunning for gas guzzlers

Sssh ... The year 2000 is here.
And we still inch to work on
crowded asphalt with our windows
rolled up against the fumes from
idling exhausts. But cheer up. A
new generation of clean cars is

coming to a showroom near you

Motor vehicles consume half of
the world's oil and account for a
quarter of the greenhouse-gas
emissions, according to Scientific
American. The biggest source of
air pollution in a majority of the
world's cities is auto exhaust.
As we enter the 20th Century,

new car registrations skyrocket
and the number of miles the aver
age person drives each year rises.
Unless something changes, the
concentration of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere is expected to
reach it highest level in 50 million
years by the year 2100. This could
wreak havoc on global weather
patterns.

Despite the grim state of affairs,
there is much reason for hope.
New technologies oiler an alterna
tive to the swift onset of global
warming. The solutions will in
volve embracing new sources of
energy and making the old ones
cleaner and more efficient.
Carmakers are now beginning
to offer vehicles that not only great

ly reduce pollution but also per
form more efficiently, travel far
ther and last longer than anything
we've ever seen.

Laws in California now re-

quire that 10 percent of all

cars sold by the year 2003
need to be zero-emission

vehicles. Designed to re
<l me air pollution.

these laws require
that vehicles do not

emit exhaust that is
Jill J;
harmful to the envi-

ronment. Under the
new laws, the annual

sales of zero-emission
vehicles are expected
to surpass 200,000 in
California by 2003.

In order to help meet
this demand, America's Big
Three automakers — Ford,
Chrysler and General Motors —
have formed the "Partnership for a
New Generation of Vehicles" to
spur development of alternative
vehicle technology. Their long
term goal is to develop vehicles that
will deliver up to three times
greater fuel efficiency and cost no
more to own and operate than
today's midsize family sedan.
For those of you out there who

want to drive your very own
"green" vehicle, there are a lot of
options — electric battery powered

cars,
hybrid cars

which use both gas and electricity,

solar cars, fuel-cell cars and

many more. Some of these
options are currently avail
able while others are still

concept vehicles. Here are
some options available for
those who want an eco
friendly ride to work.

Electric cars and the Tzero
An electric vehicle, or an EV, is
propelled by an electric motor and
an electronic control module. The
main reason to drive an electric car
is an ecological one. Compared to
gas-powered cars, EVs do not pro
duce harmful exhaust and are
much quieter when idle. Thus they
can help reduce air and traffic
noise pollution.
EVs do have unique battery
maintenance requirements, how
ever. On a single charge, an EV can
travel only 40 to 60 miles. Because
of the limited range of the EV, it is
presently not possible to address
the consumer need for extended
travel range.
However, if you're an enthusiast
with a checkbook and a flair for
high performance sports cars, then
you should definitely look at the
Tzero, an electric sports car manu
factured by AC Propulsion Corpo
ration of San Dimas, California.

File Tzero is one of the

world's fastest and most effi
cient cars. In a recent series of im
promptu 1/8 mile races held at
Moffet Field in Mountain View,
California, the Tzero out-per
formed a Ferrari F355, a new
Corvette and a Porsche Carrera 4.
It can accelerate to 60 mph in 4.1
seconds and has zero emissions. It
makes less noise than some of the
most luxurious cars out there and
of course, it is electric.
The Tzero has a superb driving
feel that is direct, linear and imme
diate. It has an ultra-rigid chassis,
which provides an excellent foun
dation for the adjustable four
wheel double wishbone suspen
sion.
It also has a 200 HP premium
copper-rotor AC induction motor
and a 200 k\V on-board charger.
This enables easy recharging of the
batteries. Few other streetcars pro
vide comparable levels of effortless

and accessible performance.
"The Tzero has proved its per
formance early on. We're aiming
to start a low-volume production
run soon," said Tom Gage, Vice-
President of ACPropulsion Corpo
ration.
"Building a high-end sports car
is the best way to make electric cars
popular," Gage said. "The big car
makers feel that hybrids and elec
tric vehicles are an unwarranted
diversion and make marketing
non-elforts, which makes it diffi
cult to mass-produce electric cars,"
he said.

of EVs will require a confluence of
