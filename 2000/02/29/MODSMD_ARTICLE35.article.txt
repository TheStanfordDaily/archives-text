# Myzack to rewrite Web
## 
### CHRISTOPHER LYLE RAVI SARIN 
Stanford students have been writing the
Web since graduates produced sites such as
Excite and Yahoo!.
But that was generations ago, at least in
Internet time — almost seven years. Now,
Stanford alumni Matt Patterson and Issac
Roth have founded Zack Network with
plans to rewrite the Web.
Last Friday, Zack Network announced
its patent-pending technology, the Zack
Engine™, which can capture and modify
any Web page without time delay.
Price comparison, instant messaging
and community browsing are just some of
the possibilities with this robust mechanism
that can deliver any type of content or lea
lure to a designated Web page.
With this technology, Zack claims that
they can analyze, modify and return a Web
page to a visitor with additional pertinent
information.
"The Zack Engine™ is changing the
way the Web works by rewriting Web
pages," CEO Patterson said. "Zack has
opened a new realm of possibilities for ln

ternet users by providing a more exciting
and compelling Web experience."
The rewritten Web pages delivered by
Zack use the Zack Bar™ to deliver content
to site visitors. Zack Bar™ is a little window
that pops up the user's browser and dis
plays content related to that page.
It works like this: let's say a user is
searching for a book at Amazon.com. Zack-
Bar™ will pop up and display other loca
tions in which that book can be purchased
as well as book reviews, lowest prices and
other information.
A wish-list feature allows the user to in
dicate interest iti a product if you don't
want to buy it immediately.
Much more can be added to this "truly
revolutionary" product, according to Stan
ford alumna and Zack Marketing Manager
ktistie I.ilje '97.
Patterson said he and Roth founded
Zack Network in the beginning of last year
with one mission in mind: to make the Web
more useful for every individual.
So what drove these two entrepreneurs
to Zack? After graduating from Stanford,
they kept in touch by way of computer as
they traveled around the world, according

to Patterson.
From Paris to Lithuania and
Kazakhstan to Germany, they
continued working on new ideas
of personalizing the Web.
Returning from their travels in
January 1999, they began to work
out of a loft in San Francisco, max
ing out credit cards as they went.
Nights were spent writing and
rewriting software and business
plans.
When the time was right, they
rounded up a group of angel in
vestors and secured their initial
funding.
They put the money to work
and, with a group of summer in
terns from Stanford, continued to
code.
Soon, however, Patterson's liv
ing room wasn't enough work
space. When the interns went
back to school, Patterson and
Roth started a hiring frenzy, and
the company grew to its current
size of 25 employees.
The primary focus for Zack
Network is e-commerce. Current
ly, Zack supports over 175 sites
ranging from computer retailers
to pet supply companies.
This number will increase as
Zack grows. Over 12,000 people
currently use the service, and the
company hopes to have 1 million
users by the end of the year.
"Our new release provides use

ful shopping features directly
where consumers lack it most, on
'sticky' retail sites that have every
incentive to keep a user from leav
ing," Patterson said.
"By delivering relevant prod
uct information to users on a
given product page, Zack frees
consumers from the tyranny of
online retailing," he added.
Another feature of the Zack
Engine is that it does not require a

software download.
Rather than taking the time to
get the software and install it, a
user can sign up at the Web site
and have the service go to work
for them without taking up space
on his hard drive.
In more technical terms, the
Zack Engine operates at the
proxy/caching level on the serv
er's end rather than the end
user's.

The Zack team is loaded with
homegrown talent. Seven ol the
25 employees were cultivated at
the Farm.
The seven former students are
Patterson: CEO and co-founder,
Jason Campbell: CIO, Bree
DeMoss: Product Manager,
Michael Schneider, Forrest Mel
lon and Tobias Kun/e: Develop
ers and kristie Ulje: Marketing
Manager.
