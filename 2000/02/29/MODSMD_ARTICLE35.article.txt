# Myzack to rewrite Web
## 
### CHRISTOPHER LYLE RAVI SARIN 
Stanford students have been writing the
Web since graduates produced sites such as
Excite and Yahoo!.
But that was generations ago, at least in
Internet time — almost seven years. Now,
Stanford alumni Matt Patterson and Issac
Roth have founded Zack Network with
plans to rewrite the Web.
Last Friday, Zack Network announced
its patent-pending technology, the Zack
Engine™, which can capture and modify
any Web page without time delay.
Price comparison, instant messaging
and community browsing are just some of
the possibilities with this robust mechanism
that can deliver any type of content or lea
lure to a designated Web page.
With this technology, Zack claims that
they can analyze, modify and return a Web
page to a visitor with additional pertinent
information.
"The Zack Engine™ is changing the
way the Web works by rewriting Web
pages," CEO Patterson said. "Zack has
opened a new realm of possibilities for ln

ternet users by providing a more exciting
and compelling Web experience."
The rewritten Web pages delivered by
Zack use the Zack Bar™ to deliver content
to site visitors. Zack Bar™ is a little window
that pops up the user's browser and dis
plays content related to that page.
It works like this: let's say a user is
searching for a book at Amazon.com. Zack-
Bar™ will pop up and display other loca
tions in which that book can be purchased
as well as book reviews, lowest prices and
other information.
A wish-list feature allows the user to in
dicate interest iti a product if you don't
want to buy it immediately.
Much more can be added to this "truly
revolutionary" product, according to Stan
ford alumna and Zack Marketing Manager
ktistie I.ilje '97.
Patterson said he and Roth founded
Zack Network in the beginning of last year
with one mission in mind: to make the Web
more useful for every individual.
So what drove these two entrepreneurs
to Zack? After graduating from Stanford,
they kept in touch by way of computer as
they traveled around the world, according
