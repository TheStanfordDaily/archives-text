# T-1000: A mighty possibility
## 
### YAR WOO 
One of the most crucial elements of
any successfully kick-ass action movie is
the hero. In order to become an action
hero (this is a little-known fact), the
MI'AA requires you to liil out the fol
lowing multiple choice application,
published for the first time here:
1. Which of the following adjectives best
fits your personality: a) mellow: b) meticu
lous; c) gun-toting?
2. If you could be any animal, you would
choose to be: a) a lion: b) a butterfly; c)
Predator.
3. You generally arrive at parties: a)
right on time; b) fashionably late; c) through
the skylight.
The correct answer tc» all of these
questions, of course, is to take a crayon
and scrawl all over the paper as hap
hazardly as possible.
Drool marks are a definite sign of
stardom. Steven Seagal's application
had to be line-dried before it was sub
mitted (and if you're reading this,
Steven, I live on the fourth floor of Mir
rielees, where I go by the nickname
"Rahul Gupta." Bring it on, fatso . . . ).
But as great as Steven is, no action
hero is as representative of the genre as
the master, Arnold Schwarzenegger.

From sci-fi thrillers like "Total Re
call'to horror classics like "Jingle All
The Way," Ali-nolcl has shown us that
he can be depended on to steadfastly
mutter his lines in the heat of a pitched
battle or in the case of "Junior," in the
heat of labor.
The finest of Schwarzenegger's bul
let-fests, however, is the superb "Ter
minator 2: Judgment Day." It is in this
movie (and its prequel, of course), that
his bulging muscle and robotic delivery
actually make SENSE.
In case you haven't seen it (and if
not, I suggest watching SCBN, which
occasionally screens it and other
movies between showings of "Indiana
Jones and the East Crusade." "Termi
nator 2" consists of one action scene
after another, occasionally punctured
by brief, poignant exchanges between
the 1-800 (Arnold) and John Connor
(some kid) that run a little like this:
John: You can't kill people! Don't you
understand?
T-800: IHighhgubhlamrm. liugarham
mug.
John: Yon are one radical dude.
T-800: Hurba lummragh.
But what really makes this movie su
perior to its predecessor is the addition
of possibly the coolest villain ever to

grace the screen — the T-1000.
Made of liquid metal, he can melt
into the floor, make his hands into
blades, change into other people and
do all sorts of other neat stuff", except
for putting away the good guvs when
he needs to the most.
But could such a machine ever
exist? No. I'm not going to report some
announcement that some lab scientists
have created a working I -1000 proto
type. The answer is that the T-1000 will
probably never see the light of day.
However, researchers around the
country are currently working on pro
jects which when further developed
could change the static way in which we
look at matter.
I lie field is called MEMS, which
stands for Micro-Elect ro-Mechanical-
Systems. In essence, MEMS are micro
scopic machines that can sense the en
vironment around them and change

themselves and their environ
ment, based on whatever they are
programmed to do.
The idea behind MEMS is
that, eventually, when the ma
chines become small enough and
powerful enough, they can be
embedded in other, physical stat
ic material and be able to change
that material's fundamental
properties such as shape, color or
strength on demand.
The technology is still very
new, but already researchers at
Xerox have constructed a col
umn which can increase its load
bearing strength by up to three
times under the proper, pre-pro
grammed conditions.
Another project currently
being worked on at Xerox in
clude a "air-driven paper path in
which microactuators move the
paper, enabling it to bend
around circuitous patlnvavs with
out touching the machine."
Whether this technology
could be applied to designing ef
ficient cyborg killing machines is
as of yet unknown.
This week's brainteaser ... is
not really a brainteaser. It's a
paradox, known as the "enve
lope paradox," that's pretty
neat. Here it is:
Suppose you are given two en
vehpes, each of which has some money
in it. All you know is that one of the
envelopes has twice the amount o(
money as the other.

So let's say you pick an envelope,
open it.and there''- SIOO inside.
Should you swap emu lopes? Well,
the olio r envelop* tnis eithei S2OO or
$51). -o ij you're huhy ;on'U gain
$100 over what you have now, anil
if you're unlucky you'll lose 550.
Sinn 1 tin ehance is you should
swap your envelope.
Its a "double-or-hulf bet, as op
posed to a "douhle-or-nothing." In
fact, no mallei how much money you
find, you should always swap en
velopts. In fact, without even opening
it, you know that you 're going to swap,
so why bother > just p'n 112; the other en
velope.
Hut something is clearly ridiculous
here . . you could go 11; rough the
same reasoning if you pit ked the olhei
envelope first.
I haven't heard a really con
vincing answer to this — in fact,
the author of the hook I got it
from says there isn't really a
good one (especially once you
make a few subtle modifications
to the problem .. . but it was
easier to state in this form). So
send me your thoughts at
yarwoo(o hotmail.com and I'll
give the prize to the best (or fun
niest) answer.
Congratulations to Sanmit
Basil for a) solving la>t week's
brainteaser. and b) finding me
on whois because Wenhsin for
got to print mv e-mail address
