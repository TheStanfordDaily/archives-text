## Startup job fair brings more than free stuff 
### SALAS SARAIYA 
I preferred the bouncy ball.
Sure Penguin Computing's
poster stating, "Cood evening Mr.
Cates, I'll be your server today,"
where a giant penguin towered
above the Microsoft Building,
symbolized the struggle, real or
perceived, of most startups
against the existing powers in the
industry and their desire to over
come.
But eVoice's bouncy ball was
awesome. It flashed red when it
hit stuff. Cool.
Contrary to popular opinion,
there was more at the BASES
Startup Job Fair than free stuff.
There was the distinct stench of
opportunity. That's what you get
when you crowd hundreds of
Computer Science majors, into
two relatively small tents in the
middle of White Plaza. Sniff, sniff.
The stench of opportunity.
The startup adjective is some
what of a state of mind. What
makes an Internet company a
startup? With a handful of excep
tions, they were all started in the
last decade or so.
Ask anybody who knows any
thing about the industry and
they'll be able to tell you what Al-
LAdvantage, IcleaLab! and the
aforementioned Penguin Com
puting do.
Ask anybody who works for
some of the startups, like Fireclick
and Woosh however, and they
won't be able to tell you what their
products do. It's top secret. But
that belies the fact that they're re
ally excited about what they do,
that they'll take your resume and
that they think you'd be a great
addition to their company.
The exchage rate of goods at
the job fair was very high. Be
tween students handing potential
employers their resumes, poten
tial employers handing out vari
ous free paraphenelia to anyone
who wanted it and my neverend
ing soliciting for Web sites that
pay, enough litter was created to

work the Palo Alto Traffic Police
into a frenzy.
The companies represented
covered the spectrum of startup
Internet companies — from small,
20 employee companies who
seemed to be still operating out of
a garage, to multinational corpo
rations like Handspring and Al
l Advantage — from C Level De
sign, who wanted programmers,
to KnowMed, who would be just
as likely to take Biology majors.
The only similarity between the
companies was that they all had
ideas that would change the
world. Or at least they thought
they did.
The startup fair was organized
by the Business Association of
Stanford Engineering Students,
which prides itself on being "the
primary extracurricular vehicle
for all Stanford students to learn
about the issues faced by entre
preneurs and technology compa
nies."
The demand among startups
for being in the tents was so high
that many had to be turned away,
said BASES Job Fair Coordinator
Alex Liu, a coterminal student in
Electrical Engineering.
Many current and former Stan
ford students who are working at
startups showed up to attract new
Stanford blood. 1 counted a for
mer CS teaching assistant, a for
mer fellow SAATHI member and
two current dormmates among
those pitching their companies.
With becoming a part of the In
ternet revolution being such an at
tractive opportunity, many Stan
ford students are beginning to
work for startups even before they
graduate.
I talked with CEO of Ama
zon.com Jeff Bezos after the Sum
mit in Silicon Valley, which fol
lowed the startup fair. He gave me
two pieces of advice as a student
who wants to work for a startup:
look for a "best practices" compa
ny and "follow your passion."
And go for the red bouncy
balls. They're cool.
