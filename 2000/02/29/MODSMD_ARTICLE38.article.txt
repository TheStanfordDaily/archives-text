### NINA CANN-WOODE 
Although humans have always been
adept at learning about unknown objects
by using their sense of touch, robots have
been confined to operate in structured
environments and are thus not equipped
with the capability to learn about objects
previously unknown to them.
Enter Marvin, the two-fingered robot
ic "hand" and brainchild of Mechanical
Engineering Prof. Mark Cutkosky and a
lew talented technicians in the Dex-

trous Manipulation Laboratory.
Unlike most current robots, Marvin

uses the technology of tactile sensing
to gather data about objects in re-

mote locations.
Among other things, Cutkosky
is director of the Dextrous Manip
ulation Lab and co-director of the

Stanford Integrated Manufactur
ing Association. He began work in the
Design Division of the Department of
Mechanical Engineering in 1985 after
working for several years in the Robot
ics Institute at Carnegie-Mellon Uni
versity.
Since then, Cutkosky has focused his
efforts primarily on computer-aided
concurrent engineering — which pro
vides support for people using computa
tional programs to collaborate 011 design
and manufacturing projects — and dex
trous manipulation (tactile manipulation
by robotic and teleoperated hands).
Marvin is the culmination of years of
research in the latter.
Mimicking the human process of ex
ploration, Marvin's exploratory proce
dure consists of a sequence of phases in
which fingers alternately manipulate
and explore an object's surface using two
active lingers and a "palm," or stationary
surface.

"During the manipulation phase," the
lab's Weh site summarizes, "the two ac
tive lingers grasp the object asd rotate it,
using rolling contacts to increase the
workspace. During the exploratory
phases, one linger and the palm stably
grasp the object while the third lingerex
plores by rolling and sliding over the ob
ject's surface."
Another of the lab's projects, the
"Mini-Sprawl," simulates the move
ments of a living organism. At first

glance, the cockroach-like machine ap
pears only to be a complex jumble of
wires and circuits.
But with a bounce and a whir, the
Mini-Sprawl comes to life as a highly ad
vanced robot with the capacity to per
form with much greater robustness in
unstructured environments than most of
today's robots. This gives the Mini-

Sprawl an advantage in exploring un
known terrains.
I he Mini-Sprawl is one type of lobot
in a series of biomuuetic robots, 01 ro
bots that mimic life or imitate biologic <il
systems. This new generation of ma
chines is substantially more compliant
and stable than traditional robots and
incorporates new developments in ma
terials, fabrication techniques, sensors
and activators.

The Mini-Sprawl is the middle child
in a family of robots built bv the lab.

"Sprawlita" and "Sprawl" are re-

spectively the smallest and
largest of the three.

"These projects are a continua
tion of work begun in the past,"
said Cutkosky. Sprawl was com
pleted over a period of two and a

hall weeks last summer, while
Mini-Sprawl look three davs last
fall and Sprawlita onlv a few davs in

/ January.
"The same circuitr) and code were
used in both of these projects, and that
is why they took much less time."
Cutkosky said.

The potential applications of Marvin
and Sprawl are numerous, ranging from
sea floor probings to exploration of plan
etary surfaces.
Incorporating the tactile manipula
tion technology used in Marvin. Sprawl
might one clay be used in a mission to
Mars to efficiently collect data lioni the
Red Planet's surface.
"Field geologists determine and cate
gorize locks in part bv their texture."
said Cutkosky. "If you had a Mars rovei
like Sprawl that examined texture in un
structured environments and sent data
back to Earth, field geologists would pos
sibly be able to identify any rocks that
may have had water running over
them."
