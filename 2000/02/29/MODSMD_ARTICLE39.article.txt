## Rising stress levels alarm health educators 
### JOANNE WU STAFF WRITER 
No time for sleep, no time for playing
games, no time for going to parties. You
must get that six-figure job, you have to
get an A in this class, and you must suc
ceed. These days, it seems like stress lev
els are skyrocketing on college campuses,
and Stanford is certainly not immune to
the pressures of a fast-paced world.
"I think that the pressures and de
mands 011 students have increased in
some interesting ways, and students face
different challenges," noted Carole
Pertofsky, director of Health Promotion
at Cowell Student I lealth Services.
According to a 1999 survey released
last month conducted by the Higher Ed
ucation Research Institute at the UCLA,
30 percent of freshmen entering college
last autumn reported feeling stressed
compared to only 16 percent in 1985.
Over 260,000 students at 462 colleges
contributed to the survey.
Much of the stress can be attributed to
the changing lifestyles and attitudes of
students.
"I'm sometimes astonished at how fu
ture-oriented our students are and the
degree to which success is measured by
materialism," Pertofsky said. "For exam
ple, up until recently, 1 never heard
groups of students discussing 'success' in

terms of being millionaire CEOs by age
30. Having serious data profiles of their
ideal mates. Questioning whether they
should pursue their ideals in a public ser
vice capacity, yet intensely worried about
not being able to keep up a lifestyle com
patible with their friends in other fields. I
think these are real stressors."
Besides worrying about their careers
and activities, students also have to face
the fast pace of life created by modern
technology.
"Technology has made [life] more
stressful, with e-mail and cell phones —
you never get any break from it all," said
junior Sharon Chen, a peer health edu
cator in Otero.
One possible advantage for new stu
dents is that they might be better in
formed of what to expect from college
life-.
Junior Miranda Ip, a peer health edu
cator in Florence Moore Hall, said, "In
coming freshman are a lot more aware of
the stresses that they will encounter as
college students — whether that prepares
them to deal with it better is still debat
able."
According to the research report, stu
dents do not appear to be resorting to un
healthy means of coping with stress. In
fact, the proportion of freshmen that
smoke, as well as the level of drinking
among freshmen, have both decreased

nation-wide.
At Stanford, according to Pertofsky,
"Smoking has remained fairly consistent.
About 20 percent of Stanford undergrads
smoke less than four times a year. Only 8
percent report smoking regularly."
"Regarding alcohol — we see a trend
toward the extremes. More students do
not drink at all (20 percent in 1997 versus
17 percent in 1993), hut the heavy
drinkers drink more, and drink more
often. This is also a national trend,"
Pertofsky said.
"I feel like students generally deal with
stress in healthy ways — the most impor
tant of which is relying on friends and a
strong support system," Ip said.
"Smoking and drinking, 1 feel, are
constant factors, hut I have the impres
sion that these two venues are used most
frequently by a small subset [of the] pop
ulation — not the average student popu
lation."
However, even though students may
not show the effects of stress in unhealthy
habits, the psychological and social effects
of stress can influence students in less ap
parent ways.
"One of the most serious conse
quences is that while students are so busy
packing resumes, they are missing out on
the great stress relievers — connecting
with other people, having a rich and
varies social life and cultivating hobbies

and interests that are truly satisfying as
opposed to 'resume packers,' " Pertofsky
said.
Interestingly, the survey showed that
women reported feeling stress more
often than men. While 39 percent of
women said that they experienced stress,
only 20 percent of men attested to being
stressed.
Still, despite the survey's results, men
may actually experience the same level of
stress as women, but are just more inhib
ited in reporting these feelings. Men may
feel the need to express independence
more than women and can be less likely
to acknowledge a need for help.
In their activities, women spent more
time studying, volunteering, participat
ing in student groups and doing house
work. Men, on the other hand, reported
spending more time participating in
sports, watching television, partying and
playing video games.
"I think women are more stressed out
than men, in general," Ip said.
"Maybe it's because their attitude
nowadays focuses on what must be done
now for future rewards — women are
taking less time out to relax and de-stress.
Extracun iculars pile on and impinge on
free time, whereas [for men] this free
time could be spent simply hanging out
and shooting hoops."
"Every student health survey indicates

that women self report higher stress lev
els," Pertofsky said. "My hunch is that al
though men more easily deny discom
fort, women do face particular chal
lenges."
"For example, in a Stanford study,
replicated nationally, professors tend to
call on males with considerably more fre
quency than females. They also view male
assertion styles as positive, and goal-di
rected, whereas the same behaviors in a
female are seen as pushy and aggressive,"
Pertofsky explained.
"In a competitively academic envi
ronement, I think its much harder for
women to feel that they have hit their
stride and find true mentorship."
