Alter evaluating comments submitted
In more than 1.000 students on a Res Ed
survey, the review board settled on numer
ous suggestions for the specific house that
will be assigned to Greek groups that are
awarded housing.
Among the suggestions were to select a
house that was not desirable in the previ
ous Draw, to select a house that takes the
least number of two-room doubles and sin
gles out of the Draw, to select a house that
was previously (ireek, and to not select a
house on the inner Row or in an existing
cluster of Greek houses such astheCowell
I louses.
The selected house must also comply
with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

For example, Bob is scheduled

lowing its renovation in 2000 and
contains I I two-room doubles and
eight singles.
It also is located on the inner
Row, and has consistent!) been
one of the most desirable houses
in the Draw.
Camarillo said Res Ed must
conduct further research into the
possible houses.
"We still have to do a lot of the
research to see if anything elimi
nates any one ol them. I lie ADA is
a < l itical concern," she s;iid.
According to the press release.

at the beginning of next quarter.

Denied Greek groups
react to decision
Leaders of the two Greek orga
nizations that were denied hous
ing said they were not too disap
pointed by tlie decision.
"I'm really happy for [the Kap
pas), it's great," said Sig Ep Presi
dent Will Martwell, a junior.
"Of course I wish that they
would have decided to give us
housing, but Sig Ep has been an
excellent chapter for 15 years, and
will keep being an excellent chap
ter regardless of whether or not
we are housed,'" he added.
Kappa President Zareen Khan,
a junior, echoed Hartwell's senti
ments.
"We are really excited lor them,
and we hope to be able to support
them. . . . We've always been a re
ally strong chapter on this cam
pus, and we're sure we're going to
remain one," Khan said.
Senior Stephanie Blossom, ISC
president, also reacted positively
to the news.
"I'm excited. . . . It's very good
lor the entire community," she
said.

Blossom also said that, while
she was disappointed that Res Kd
elected not to house the Kappas,
she was optimistic about the na
ture of the decision.
"I was disappointed, but 1 was
encouraged that it had nothing to
do with a shortcoming of the chap
ter; it had to do with the housing
criteria," she said.
According to Hartwell, Res Ed
denied housing to bis fraternity
because officials "didn't think we
had written quite as good an ap
plication as we could have."
Both Hartwell and Khan said
they believed the process was con
ducted fairly.
"| Res Eel J looked at all applica
tions independently," Hartwell
said.
Khan concurred. "1 definitely
don't think it was a competition.
They evaluated all three [organi
zations] fairly in terms of their ap
plications," she said.
Chi Omega
response varies
Senior Amanda Van Kpps,
president of the (ihi ()mega soror
ity which elected not to submit a
housing application this year fol
lowing an unsuccessful bid last
year, said the decision to house I'i

Phi does not affect the Chi-Os'
housing ambitions.
"At this point, it's not some
thing we're looking for at all. We
enjoy being unhoused, and t hose
not to apply for a house for good
reasons. But it's something we re
consider every year," she said.
However, Chi-O Alexandra de
Zwart, a junior who was not a
member of the sorority last year,
said that Chi-O did not apply lor
housing this year for a very specif
ic reason.
"TheChi-Os were told last yeai
that we would be the next sororitv
to get housing, but that we
shouldn't apply this year because
we should wait to get our [mem
bership] numbers up," de Zwait
said.
Camarillo vehemently denied
that she had made any such assur
ance to the sorority.
"Absolutely not. It's not the
spirit of the criteria to say, 'Wait
until your numbers go up and
you'll be guaranteed housing,'
she said.
"No one on my stall would
guarantee anyone would be the
next chapter awarded housing.

ity which elected not to submit a
housing application this year fol
lowing an unsuccessful bid last
year, said the decision to house I'i

Phi does not affect the Chi-Os'
housing ambitions.
"At this point, it's not some
thing we're looking for at all. We
enjoy being unhoused, and t hose
not to apply for a house for good
reasons. But it's something we re
consider every year," she said.
However, Chi-O Alexandra de
Zwart, a junior who was not a
member of the sorority last year,
said that Chi-O did not apply lor
housing this year for a very specif
ic reason.
"TheChi-Os were told last yeai
that we would be the next sororitv
to get housing, but that we
shouldn't apply this year because
we should wait to get our [mem
bership] numbers up," de Zwait
said.
Camarillo vehemently denied
that she had made any such assur
ance to the sorority.
"Absolutely not. It's not the
spirit of the criteria to say, 'Wait
until your numbers go up and
you'll be guaranteed housing,'
she said.
"No one on my stall would
guarantee anyone would be the
next chapter awarded housing.
I he evaluation process happens
every year, with new proposals
evaluated .it the time they are sub
mitted."
In a decision handed down late last
night, the Office of Residential Education
awarded the Pi Beta I'lii sororitv a house
on campus lor next vear and denied the
housing applications of the Kappa Kappa
(lamina sororitv and Sigma Phi Kpsilon
fraternity.
" I he Pi Beta Phi chapter was by far the
clearest and besi choice. Il mel and ex
ceeded the housing c riteria and had a dra
maticallv improved application from the
previous vear," said Res I d Direcloi |ane
(lamarillo.
(lamarillo made the final decision alter
the (.reck Housing Review Board re
viewed the groups' applications and re
ports from the (.reek Judicial Board, Of
fice <>fStudent Activities, and Intcrfraterni
iv and luleisororitv Councils. I lie board
also conduc ted interviews with each c hap
ter's leaders.
Pi Phi President Jessica Sisco, a junior,
confirmed Res l-.d's dec ision, but declined
further comment.

According to a Res Ed press release, the
(.reek Housing Review Board has estab
lished criteria that will help Camarillo de
cide to which house she will assign Pi Phi.
Alter evaluating comments submitted
In more than 1.000 students on a Res Ed
survey, the review board settled on numer
ous suggestions for the specific house that
will be assigned to Greek groups that are
awarded housing.
Among the suggestions were to select a
house that was not desirable in the previ
ous Draw, to select a house that takes the
least number of two-room doubles and sin
gles out of the Draw, to select a house that
was previously (ireek, and to not select a
house on the inner Row or in an existing
cluster of Greek houses such astheCowell
I louses.
The selected house must also comply
with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
l he press release named four possible

houses !o w hie li Pi IMii (ould he as
sit> net I: Hoi), Narnia, Whitman,
and 080 l.omita. I lowever,eac hof
these houses \ iolate at least one ol
the review board's c i iteria.
For example, Bob is scheduled
to achieve ADA compliance fol
lowing its renovation in 2000 and
contains I I two-room doubles and
eight singles.
It also is located on the inner
Row, and has consistent!) been
one of the most desirable houses
in the Draw.
Camarillo said Res Ed must
conduct further research into the
possible houses.
"We still have to do a lot of the
research to see if anything elimi
nates any one ol them. I lie ADA is
a < l itical concern," she s;iid.
According to the press release.
Res Ed will finali/c the list of can
didate houses In the end ol winter
<11lai ter and will soli* 11 input from
current residents ol these houses
at the beginning of next quarter.
After consulting with Dean of
Students Man VVais and Vice
I'rovost loi Student Affiiils James
Mont ova, (iamai illo will make the

final decision on which house to
award the sorority.
Denied Greek groups
react to decision
Leaders of the two Greek orga
nizations that were denied hous
ing said they were not too disap
pointed by tlie decision.
"I'm really happy for [the Kap
pas), it's great," said Sig Ep Presi
dent Will Martwell, a junior.
"Of course I wish that they
would have decided to give us
housing, but Sig Ep has been an
excellent chapter for 15 years, and
will keep being an excellent chap
ter regardless of whether or not
we are housed,'" he added.
Kappa President Zareen Khan,
a junior, echoed Hartwell's senti
ments.
"We are really excited lor them,
and we hope to be able to support
them. . . . We've always been a re
ally strong chapter on this cam
pus, and we're sure we're going to
remain one," Khan said.
Senior Stephanie Blossom, ISC
president, also reacted positively
to the news.
"I'm excited. . . . It's very good
lor the entire community," she
said.

Blossom also said that, while
she was disappointed that Res Kd
elected not to house the Kappas,
she was optimistic about the na
ture of the decision.
"I was disappointed, but 1 was
encouraged that it had nothing to
do with a shortcoming of the chap
ter; it had to do with the housing
criteria," she said.
According to Hartwell, Res Ed
denied housing to bis fraternity
because officials "didn't think we
had written quite as good an ap
plication as we could have."
Both Hartwell and Khan said
they believed the process was con
ducted fairly.
"| Res Eel J looked at all applica
tions independently," Hartwell
said.
Khan concurred. "1 definitely
don't think it was a competition.
They evaluated all three [organi
zations] fairly in terms of their ap
plications," she said.
