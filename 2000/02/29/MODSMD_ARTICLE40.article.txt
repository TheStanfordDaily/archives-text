# Hoover fellow addresses biological warfare and arms control concerns

### KATHARINE MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"The challenge of arms con
trol is as bad now as it has ever
been," said physicist and arms
control specialist Sidney Drell, a
senior Hoover fellow, last week.
Although the risk ol nuclear
war is largely "out of the way,"
according to Drell. "biological
weapons pose a growing threat
of indiscriminate destruction."
Because nuclear arms have
been the main national security
threat for the last 50 years,
"Physicists have born a dispro
portionate part of the burden ol
advising the government on Na
tional Security Issues," said
Drell, "but now I'm passing the
torch to the biologists."
Drell is in a position to pass
the torch because he has spent
the last 40 years as an advisor to
the Fxecutive and Legislative
branches of government on na
tional security and defense tech
nical issues.
There are a dozen or more
countries working on the devel
opment of biological weapons
because such weapons can be de
veloped with simple cloning
technologies readily available to
even the poorest nations.
Even if a treaty bans the de
velopment of tools l or germ war
fare, it is nearly impossible to
verify compliance with the
treaty. Indeed, a 1972 treaty be
tween the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.
banned the development ol bio
logical weapons — but neither
side complied with that treaty.
In his talk titled "Science and
National Security, Drell de
scribed scientific developments
that, during the last fifty years,
helped to avert nuclear war.
His theme: the scientific com
munity has a moral obligation to
assist society in political deliber
ations related to national securi
ty. Scientists can help define how
technology can be used to ad
vance policy goals and also ad
vise government officials on the
safety and practicality of military
technologies.
Does Drell's experience work
ing to control the nuclear threat
teach us any lessons that will
help control biological weapons."
Although Drell didn't spell out

an answer to this question, his
talk suggested a few ways that
scientists can help address na
tional security threats in general.
First, scientists can develop
technologies that help control
weapons proliferation. For ex
ample, during the Cold War, sci
entists slowed escalation of the
nuclear arms race by developing
aerial and satellite reconnais
sance tools.
Because these tools gave the
L'.S. information about the loca-

tion and number of Soviet
weapons, it was easier to distin
guish real threats (e.g., the
Cuban Missile Crisis) from inac
curate (and dangerous) rumors.
Reconnaissance information
also allowed meaningful talks
about arms reduction, since we
knew how many weapons there
were to begin with.
Second, scientists can help
identify which defense strategies
are technologically reasonable
and realistic as opposed to a use
less waste of money.
President Reagan's Star Wars
proposal, for example, was de
veloped without input from a
Presidential Science Advisory
(lommittee. There were no prior
discussions of what was techno
logically feasible and practical.
Ultimately, a report by the
American Physical Society defin
itively ruled out Star Wars as un
realistic.

Third, scientists can inform
(lie public about the scientific
support for or against a particu
lar national security strategy. In
the debate over Star Wars, scien
tists played a key role in inform
ing the public of the impractical
ities of Reagan's plan.
And fourth, scientists can de
velop technologies to make sure
that our own weapons arsenal is
safe and secure. For the nuclear
arms race, this role has signifi
cance for the prevention of fu
ture testing: if technologies are
developed for ensuring that the
existing arsenal remains safe
and effective as it ages, perhaps
the Senate will feel more com
fortable ratifying the Compre
hensive lest Ban Treaty that
Clinton signed four years ago.
Whether these lessons have
applicability to biological war
fare prevention remains to be
seen. It is not yet clear if technol
ogy can help verify compliance
with biological weapons treaties,
but time will tell.
Biologists can certainly play a
role in advising the government
about whether it is wise to devel
op a biological weapons arsenal,
how best to respond to other na
tions' developments of such ar
senals, the actual risks posed by
different types of biological
weapons, possible defenses to bi
ological weapons, and the safety
risks involved in biological
weapons research.
Biologists can also spread the
message that developing biolog
ical weapons is a bad idea. By
doing so, scientists establish
what Drell called "norms of be
havior." That is, U.S. scientists
play a leadership role in the in
ternational scientific community
— helping to establish what is
and is not acceptable scientific
protocol.
Drell warns, however, that
public discussion of biological
weapons may stimulate the de
velopment of more weapons by
pointing out how easy they are
to make.
Is it worth that risk? Probably,
since the risk exists even without
the public discussion. So biolo
gists get busy! The physicists did
their job; now it's your turn to
tackle the problem of national
security.
