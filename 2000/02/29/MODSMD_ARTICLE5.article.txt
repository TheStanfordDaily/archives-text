about their characters," Mendel
son said.
"It's great to establish some sort
of connection to someone who cre
ated the work," Leeds said.
li is rare that a small group can
bring a famous speaker to campus
without University assistance, stu
dents said. "I think that it is really
exciting that a student group
could bring such a well-known
lyricist to campus completely by it
self," said senior kathy Steel, exec
utive producer of Ram's Head.
Mendelson, Leeds and several
Ram's Head actors began writing
to Schwartz via e-mail as early as
September. They got his address
from a Web site.
"He responds to every single e
mail," said Leeds. "I saw that he
went to I farvard and spoke [there]
last year and so 1 asked him if he
could speak here. The timing
worked out perfectly, so he said he
would come."
" This is something we all go
through," Schwartz said of the
"Pippin" plot, which centers on a
young man's search for himself.
"VVe all make choices about our
lives. It's evervbodv's story."
