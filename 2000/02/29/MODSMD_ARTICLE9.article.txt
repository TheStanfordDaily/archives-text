## Exhibit showcases Steinbeck's life in Stanford and Salinas 
### PATRICK C. CROSETTO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Before the c uri ent wave of students drop
ping out ol Stanford to make millions in In
ternet start-ups began, the I 'diversity's most
famous drop-out was a Pulitzer and Nobel
prize-winning writer who, legend has it,
failed college wi iting multiple times.
An exhibit entitled " John Steinbeck: From
Salinas to Stockholm" celebrates the es
teemed authoi of "The (irapes ol Wrath"
and other classics. I he exhibit, which opened
on Sundav and runs through April 30, is on
display in the Peterson Fxhibit (iallery in the
Bing Wing of (Ireen Library.
Ac i ok ling to hill Mc Pheron, exhibit cura
tor, the display of John Steinbeck memora
bilia "was prompted by our wanting to wel
come the at i ivalol the largecollec tion of fani
ilv materials that Well# Fargo enabled the li
brary to gel last year."
In addition to the materials Ik tin the Wells
Fargo Steinbeck (Collection, the library is dis
playing items from its oihei collections.
I'hese include letters and manuscripts that
Steinbeck sent to former Stanford classmates,
his literaiA agent Flizabeth Otis and I lolly
wood friends David (). Selznick and Jules
Buck.
McPheron said that although the exhibit
includes only a small fraction of Stanford's
Steinbeck-related holdings, "it's representa
tive ol our entire collection ... [which] in

chides thousands and thousands of pieces en
tirely available to scholars and students."
McPheron estimates that Stanford's Stein
lK'ck collection is the largest in the world.
The exhibit chronicles the Steinljeck's life
from his days growing up in nearby Salinas
Valley through his two brief stints as a Stan
ford student to his rise to critical acclaim and
his garnering of the Nobel Prize in literature,
the only native Califbrnian to hold that dis
tinction.
Part of the exhibit details Steinbeck's life as
a propaganda writer for the United States
government during World War II and as a
screenwriter iu I lollywood during its (iolden
Age.
Steinbeck wrote more than 10 screenplays
lor renowned directors such as Klia Kazan
and Alfred Hitchcock, earning three Acade
my Award nominations.
The exhibit has many original manu
scripts and personal letters written b\ Stein
beck that share with the \ isitor a unique por
tal into the private life that he kept hidden.
"He wrote his work out of his life,"
M< Pheron said, "but it's not autobiographi
cal. There's not too much [in his writing] from
which you can get a sense of the real John
Steinbeck."
For this reason McPheron said he finds an
original manuscript of "(tannery Row" in the
exhibit that depicts Steinbeck as a character in
the novel to be intriguing. I his section was
deleted before the novel was sent to the pub
lisher so the public has never before seen it.
McPheron, however, said his favorite item
is "a telegram that Krskine ('.aldwell wrote
