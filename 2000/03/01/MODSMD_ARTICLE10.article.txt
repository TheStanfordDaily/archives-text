# Changes to Mayfield Ave. in works to increase safety
## 
### KATHY VERMAZEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford is looking at a variety of measures to
improve biker safety on Mayfield Avenue, includ
ing barricades to force bikers to walk their bikes
at crosswalks, the removal of trees which reduce
visibility and the addition of speed bumps.
Thursday's bike accident on Mayfield, the lat
est in a string of accidents at the crosswalk in front
of East Florence Moore Hall, prompted renewed
efforts by Residential Education and the Stanford
Department of Public Safety to find a solution to
the problem of biker safety at the crosswalk.
According to senior Megan Tompkins, a resi
dent assistant in Alondra, the accident was the
second this month involving an Alondra resident.
The crosswalk is marked and includes stop signs,
which Tompkins said may be part of the problem.
The stop signs "give the students a false sense
of security," she said. Tompkins stressed that nei
ther of the last two incidents have been the fault
of the bikers.
"In addition to the reported accidents, there
are many more that go unreported or involve
"near accidents with inattentive drivers," Tomp
kins said.
"Bicyclists do need to take due cautio — stop
signs do not give them the right of way," added
Sergeant Laura Wilson of the Stanford Depart
ment of Public Safety.
Many bicyclists may not realize how difficult it
is for motorists to see them or stop in time. Ac

cording to Wilson, motorists using the standard
"look left, look right, go" approach at stop signs
would need to spot moving bicyclists when they
are over 25 feet from the intersection in order to
avoid hitting them.
Current proposals focus on the installation of a
double set of barricades at the curb, Wilson said.
These barricades would force bicyclists to walk
their bikes across the street. By law, bicyclists
using pedestrian crosswalks are already required
to walk their bikes through intersections.
Other proposals from the department include
the removal of trees at the side of the road to in
crease visibility for drivers and bikers and the
placement of speed tables at the intersection.
Speed tables, also found near Stanford Hospital,
are less severe than traditional speed bumps but
would still force motorists to slow down.
Jane Camarillo, director of Res Ed, said any
changes would probably not occur immediately.
"As you might imagine, this kind of action
takes time and additional consulting with groups
around campus like Transportation Programs of
the University Planning Office and Student Af
fairs. We, however, are all in favor of coming up
with safer traffic controls for this area."
Wilson said the department's proposals will be
released by the end of the week. "This is some
thing we hope will happen soon," Wilson said.
Despite the efforts of the Public Safety Depart
ment to find a solution, Tompkins said she
"would like to see more response from the Uni
versity — this has been a problem for years."
