Chamber of Commerce.
"One of the main goals of
Leadership Midpeninsula is to
help bridge the three cities, re
ducing barriers and strength
ening community bonds," said
program director Phil Kilcl
bridge.
"One of the reasons we chose
to discuss racism today is be
cause we see it as a barrier pre
venting Midpeninsula commu
nities from coexisting. Until We
open up this topic for discus
sion, we cannot create a harmo
nious environment," he said.
Keynote speaker and Stan
ford Law School alumnae
Judge LaDoris Cordell began
the program by describing her
experiences with racism, which
included being followed
around by security guards in
department stores and dealing
with non-color blind realtors
when searching for a home in
Palo Alto.
Cordell began her career as
a judge in 1982 when she was
appointed to the Municipal

Court of Santa Clara County.
Cordell is the first African-
American woman to serve as a
judge in northern California.
Cordell said, "Being black
has always framed my world. I
was taught my future and suc
cess depended on how I dealt
with white society."
Assoc. Political Science Prof.
Luis Fraga then talked about
the "trust deficit" that he said
characterizes today's society.
According to Fraga, there is
an inability to solve problems
collectively because there is
such a lack of trust in other peo
ple and the public institutions
available to us.

ty Safety Coordinator at the En
terprise Foundation, discussed
racial injustice in his communi
ty, Fast Palo Alto.
"East Palo Alto is generating
enormous wealth in the busi
nesses of Palo Alto and Menlo
Park," Hoover said. "However,
when we [residents of East Palo
Alto] want to build our own
businesses, we are denied capi
tal and given lawsuits."
Stanford Law Prof.
Stephanie Smith, the only
white person on the panel, said
she found the extent of racism
in local communities disturb
ing.

Palo Alto Hyatt, brought in
