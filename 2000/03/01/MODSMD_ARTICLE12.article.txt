## Candidates battle for final votes 
### 
ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) —
George W. Bush and John
McCain battled in Republican
presidential contests in Virginia,
North Dakota and Washington
state in the final test of political
strength before next week's 13-
state "Super Tuesday" showdown.
"I feel things are going my way,
that the campaign is progressing
very well," the Texas governor
told reporters in Cleveland.
The Arizona Republican
declared himself his party's best
general election candidate, assur
ing GOP voters, "VVe will at last
start winning again."
Trailing in delegate-rich Cali
fornia, McCain reversed course
and decided to participate — by a
satellite TV hookup — in a Los
Angeles debate in advance of next
week's voting there. The Bush
camp said he, too, might now take
part by satellite.
On the Democratic side, (for
mer) Sen. Bill Bradley and Vice
President /VI Gore squared off in
Washington state. No delegates
were at stake, but the former New
Jersey senator hoped for a symbol
ic victory to breathe lile into his
troubled campaign.
In the race for the 1,034 dele
gates needed to win the Republi
can nomination, McCain had 96
and Bush 93 headed into Tues
day's contests. Eighty-seven were
up for grabs in Virginia, North
Dakota and Washington state.
At stake next week are 613
GOP delegates, more than half the
total needed to win the presiden
tial nomination.
flie increasingly bitter cam
paign is pitting McCain and his
coalition of independents and
Democrats against Bush and the
GOP establishment. McCain may
have widened the divide by
strongly criticizing certain evan
gelical leaders and portraying
Bush as a captive of the religious
right.
flie Arizona senator also
attempted to tie Bush to a conser
vative South Carolina university
that has espoused anti-Catholic
views.
Bush accused McCain of
"denionizing people, holding peo
ple up for scorn." In a visual mes
sage, the Texas governor sat next
to a Catholic priest as the television
cameras recorded his Cleveland
event.
Virginia's primary was open to
all voters who promised not to
participate in another party con
test. McCain hoped the pledge
would not dissuade his base of
independents and Democrats.
Bush hoped that injecting reli
gion into the race would hurt
McCain in Virginia, home of the
Christian Coalition. The strategy
cost McCain the vote of Cindy
Haynes, a Roanoke woman who
said, "I think he's trying to create
issues and is tearing the party
apart."
Bush vastly outspent McCain in
Virginia until the last week of the
race and was supported by the
state's top Republican leaders. T he
Texan's victory in South Carolina
gave him reason to hope for simi
lar results in like-minded Virginia.
While Bush could hardly afford
a defeat on such friendly terrain,
McCain hoped for a Virginia
upset to fuel his momentum
against a rival who is better orga
nized in upcoming primary states.
On March 7, Republicans in
California, Connecticut, Georgia,
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, Missouri, New York,
Ohio, Rhode Island, Vermont and
Washington state will choose their
favorites. Bush holds the edge in
California while McCain is faring
well in New England polls.
