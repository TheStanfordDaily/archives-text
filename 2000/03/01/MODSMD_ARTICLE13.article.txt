### 
DILI, East Timor (AP) — In an effort to
make amends for 24 years of brutal occupa
tion, Indonesia's president solemnly apolo
gized for human rights abuses his country
inllicted on the small, predominantly Chris
tian territory.
Abdurrahman Wahid is Indonesia's first
head of state to visit East Timor since it broke
away from the world's largest Muslim nation
last year, prompting anti-independence mili
tia to go on a violent rampage.
Overall, the democratic reformer was
warmly welcomed by East Timor's long-suf
fering people. But his landmark attempt to

foster reconciliation was marred when U.N.
peacekeepers fired shots over the heads of a
noisy group of anti-Indonesian protesters.
During the visit, Wahid laid a wreath at
Santa Cruz cemetery next to the graves of
about 200 East Timorese civilians slaughtered
by Indonesian soldiers in 1991. He then paid
homage to Indonesian soldiers buried in an
adjacent field.
"1 would like to apologize for the sins that
have happened in the past, to the victims or
the families of Santa Cruz and those friends
who are buried in the military cemetery," he
said.

"These are the victims of circumstances
that we didn't want."
Wahid did not specifically address last
year's violence, which saw at least 250 people
killed and thousands of homes and buildings
destroyed alter the East Timorese voted over
whelmingly to break away from Indonesia in a
U.N.-sponsored referendum.
Wahid's trip is being labeled as symbolic,
and sets the tone for future relations between
East Timor and its former master.
It comes as Indonesian prosecutors pre
pare to lay charges against military officers
and militia members blamed for the mayhem.
