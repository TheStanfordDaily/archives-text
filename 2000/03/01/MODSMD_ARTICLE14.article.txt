sky was freed from custody yester
day, but much of what happened
to him since being detained by
Russian forces in Chechnya in Jan
uary remained a mystery.
Babitsky only said he was kept
in the Chernokozovo detention
camp in Chechnya in the early
days he was held, and that Russian
guards used nightsticks to beat
him.
Babitsky's reporting from the
rebel side for the U.S.-funded
radio Liberty had angered Rus
sian officials. After his detention,
authorities said he had been
turned over to rebels in exchange
for captured Russian soldiers.
The case was shrouded in mys
tery for weeks, with Babitsky's
whereabouts unknown and Rusr
sian officials making contradictory
statements about the swap. Many
of Babitsky's colleagues feared ht
had been killed.
On Friday, he reappeared in
Makhachkala, the capital of Dages
tan, in the custody of authorities
who charged him with carrying a
forged Azerbaijani passport.
Ihe detention and the
exchange sparked protests in Rus
sia and abroad, with foreign offi
cials and human rights groups
demanding that Moscow clear up
the case. Acting President
Vladimir Putin stepped in, saying
there were insufficient grounds
