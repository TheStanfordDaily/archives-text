# First-grader killed in elementary school shooting

### 
MOUNT MORRIS TOWNSHIP, Mich.
(AP) — A 6-year-old boy shot a little girl to
death in their first-grade classroom yester
day, a day after they may have scuffled on
the playground.
In a school shooting made especially
shocking by the age of the youngsters, the
boy fired a bullet from a .32-caliber gun
inside Buell Elementary near Flint, 60
miles from Detroit, striking his 6-year-old
classmate in the neck. She died a half-hour
later.
The boy was taken into the custody of
the state child welfare agency.
Prosecutors did not say how they think
lie got the gun, though they said it had
been reported stolen in December and was
in the boy's home. President Clinton said
he was told the boy's brother gave him the
weapon.
It was unclear whether the shooting was
accidental or intentional.
"It would appear from the investigation
so far that there may have been some sort
of scuffle or quarrel on the playground the
day before the shooting between this little
boy and this little girl," Genesee County
Prosecutor Arthur A. Busch said.
Regardless of what the investigation
reveals, it may be impossible to bring
charges against the boy, the prosecutor
said.
But he said someone may face charges

for enabling the boy to obtain the gun.
"There is a presumption in law that a
child ... is not criminally responsible and
can't form an intent to kill. Obviously, he
has done a very terrible thing today, but
legally, he can't be held criminally respon
sible," the prosecutor said. "We will get to
the bottom of how that gun got into that lit
tle boy's hands."
T he names of the two youngsters were
not released.
The boy is by far the youngest gunman
in a series of deadly school shootings that
have rocked communities around the
country over the past three years.
In 1998, two boys, 11 and 13, opened
fire at a middle school in Jonesboro, Ark.,
killing four girls and a teacher.
"Where does it stop? First-graders shoot
ing first-graders. The culture of violence is
manifesting itself here with what occurred,"
said Sam Riddle, a spokesman for the fam
ily of Isaiah Shoels, who was among 12 stu
dents killed by teen-age gunmen Dylan
Klebold and Eric Harris in their attack on
Columbine High School in April. Riddle
grew up in Flint.
At Buell Elementary, Freddie Booth
arrived after the shooting to look for his 8-
year-old daughter, Fredricka.
"I don't believe this is happening,"
Booth told flie Flint Journal. "A first-grad
er shoots another first-grader. First-graders

shouldn't be able to get a gun. 1 just want
my daughter out of here. She has been
traumatized, I'm sure."
About 500 children attend Buell Kle
mentary, which is in an area of neat, small
single-family homes.
Other parts of the Flint suburb, which
has a population of about 25,300, are more

run-down, with dilapidated homes and
boarded-up storefronts.
"I moved out here because I had
thought it"d be safer for my grandkids,"
said Katherine Sutton, who lias lived in the
area for five years.
"I thought things would be better, but I
see it's not.
