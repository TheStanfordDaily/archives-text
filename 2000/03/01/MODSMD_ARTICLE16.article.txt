# Clinton may tap nation's emergency reserve oil supplies
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Clin
ton said yesterday that lie may tap the
nation's emergency petroleum supplies if he
can find no other way to reduce oil and gas
prices.
"I have not taken the petroleum reserve
issue off the table, and I certainly wouldn't do
that in the event that we don't seem to have
any other options," Clinton said before leav
ing the White House for a political trip to
Florida.
Clinton's remark seemed to contradict
previous administration statements, includ
ing a declaration made Monday by White
I louse spokesman Joe Lockhart that "at this

point in time, that's not an option that we're
considering."
Another White House spokesman, Jim
Kennedy, said yesterday that while using the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a possibility,
"that doesn't mean it's being considered for
use in the current context."
Several lawmakers from the Northeast,
where fuel oil prices have risen to extreme
levels, have urged the administration to
release oil from the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, a stockpile of government-con
trolled oil.
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and
other administration officials have said

repeatedly they do not intend to clip into the
reserve, which was created to ease supplv dis
ruptions, not to influence prices.
There also is the fear that if the strategic
reserve were tapped it would make ii more
difficult to persuade OPEC oil producers to
increase production when they meet in
March to consider their future production
strategies.
If production goes up, "then oil prices will
go down, the gasoline prices will go down,
and that's really what is needed here," Clin
ton said today.
"We'll see. I'm encouraged that that might
occur."

I he reserve has been tapped only once, a
partial drawdown in 1991 .it the beginning of
the Persian Gulf War. That combined with
production increases abroad maintained sta
bility m supplies and prices during the six
week wai.
Clinton also said the White House may
pursue a "swap," basically a deal to allow oil
companies to borrow from the reserve.
l.'ndcr that scenario, oil companies could
bid for petroleum in the emergency reserve.
I he companies would promise to return
the oil in the future, with "interest" in the
form of additional barrels. No money would
< hangc hands.
