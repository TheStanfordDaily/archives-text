Ten years of sanctions and bombings in Iraq have led to over 1.5 million
deaths. Since the imposition of the sanctions, the death rate for children under the
age of five has more than doubled. Moreover, one out of five Iraqi children is malnourished.
In spite of these facts from a recent report issued by
UNICEF, U.S. justification for the sanctions has fixused on
lil)erating the Iraqi people from the dictatorship of Saddam
Hussein. Proponents of the sanctions argue that ousting
Hussein would promote Iraqi human rights.
At a talk on Monday night, Richard Becker, Western Regional
Coordinator of the International Action Center, debunked this and other
myths about American justification for the sanctions, which were imposed four

days after Iraq's Aug. 2, 1990, invasion of Kuwait.
International policy makers in the U.S. have framed the sanctions as a

humanitarian effort to promote democracy. Yet, with support for the sanctions
dwindling in the Security Council and among other members of the United

Nations, the sanctions are far from multilateral. Both the chief of the World
Food Program in Iraq and the U.N. Aid coordinator in Iraq resigned earlier this

month in protest of the inhumane impact of the sanctions.
The sanctions policy in Iraq is only the most recent instance in a historical pat-

World War 11, the U.S. instituted a policy that would ensure their control over

newly-found oil stores 111 the Middle Last. Ine founding of the Arabian American
Oil Company, Aramco, in that same year gave the U.S. its desired foot-hold, which

it has since been loath to relinquish.
This historical evidence contradicts U.S. claims that the sanction policy is pro-

democracy, or pro-human rights, because the sanctions are actually a continuation
of business as usual in the light to control oil supplies.

Another main justification of the sanctions is suppressing Iraq s military power.
However, this developing country of 20 million people does not pose as

major a threat its U.S. policy makers would have one believe. In the
Gulf War, the U.S. suffered 147 casualties while Iraq had over

150,000.
