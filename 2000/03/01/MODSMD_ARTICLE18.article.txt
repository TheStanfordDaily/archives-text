# SHOULD THE U.N. LIFT SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAQ?
## Con 
### BEN JONES OPINIONS EDITOR 
The economic sanctions imposed on Iraq following the Gulf
War were designed with a varied set of objectives — not only to pun-

ish Iraq for its aggression against Kuwait but also to create the domestic
instability necessary to undermine Saddam Hussein's stranglehold on the govern
ment.

Although the sanctions have not yet had the intended effect of aiding the
removal of Hussein from power, it is unfeasible given the current state of affairs in

Iraq and iu the Middle East to lift the sanctions without potentially harmful effects.
It is impossible to ignore the sub-standard living conditions throughout almost

all of Iraq, yet the causality between economic sanctions and these conditions is
unstable at best and invisible at its worst. The Food and Agriculture Organization,

a U.N. humanitarian organization, has gone to great lengths to distance itself
from the notion that the sanctions are the causal agent of the suffering in Iraq.

It is, in fact, more likely that the source of Iraq's infrastructural degrada
tion is the Gulf War itself — namely the destruction of key industrial facilities

including sanitation plants, major telecommunications networks and food pro-

cessing plants.
While an influx of foreign currency would greatly aid the reconstruc-

tion of these vital facilities, there are absolutely no guarantees that the benefits
reaped from the lifting of sanctions would in any way reach the Iraqi people

currency to flow into Iraq — namely through the sale of Iraqi oil on the open market —
