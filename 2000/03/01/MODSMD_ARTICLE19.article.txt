Greeks taking over upperclass housing
We were appalled to learn this morn
ing that still more upper class housing is
going to be granted to a Greek organiza
tion. Attractive housing options for non-
Greek upperclassmen have been steadily
dwindling as freshmen have been moved
into two-room doubles (the Freshman
Sophomore Gollege) and sororities have
overtaken the Cowell cluster.
Apparently, Residential Education
feels that upperclassmen who cannot
withstand the social rigors of rush do not
deserve better than a one room double in
Wilbur.
It is especially unfair that such coveted
houses as Bob, Narnia, 680 Lomita and
Whitman should Ix* removed from the
draw. It seems absurd that belonging to
an arbitrary and exclusive stx ial organiza
tion should entitle a student to the best
housing on campus.

Daily misrepresented itself to source
In the Feb. 29 article, "Row Kitchen
manager deemed a tough job," it is obvi
ous the lengths at which the editors of The
Daily will go to create a headline.
I was interviewed tor that article under
the impression that it would be an infor
mational source for prospective applicants
to managerial positions on the Row. One
can imagine my surprise and disgust
upon reading the article and finding
information that was injurious to Ixrth my
house and the Row program as a whole.
In addition, I have also learned that
the writer of the article himself had not
intended to include that particular inter
view, but rather was coerced by the edito
rial staff into including and emphasizing it
for the explicit purpose of "making the
story more interesting."
I do not defend the actions of the pre
vious Kairos kitchen manager quoted in

the article. Nor do I fully disagree with
The Daily's desire to present this informa
tion to the public. Transgressions are
inevitable in any situation in which people
are given wide jurisdiction over money
and decisions. For this reason, it is neces
saiy that managers, residents and the
University as whole are aware of this pos
sibility.
However, the manner in which The
Daily has attempted to make this informa
tion available is inappropriate and incom
plete. It only serves to victimize a program
that has otherwise proven itself time and
again to be legitimate and necessary to a
large population of students on this cam
pus.
Integrity and responsibility are the
very premise of the Row program. People
who choose to live and work in self-ops
and co-ops recognize that Stanford stu
dents are (or at least should be) mature
enough to handle the often difficult
requirements of student management.
To paraphrase a comment made by
Ann Porteus, the director of the Row pro
gram, numerous representatives from
other colleges have come to learn how the
program works and are often surprised to

see how much freedom students are
allowed in the administration of their res
idences.
The fact that students continue to show
interest in Row houses as alternatives to
standard University housing is ample
proof of the program's efficacy, even in
the face of isolated incidences of manage
rial corruption.
This is the true nature of the Row pro
gram, a positive angle which has been
overkx)ked in favor of a resentful story
provided by an anonymous source who is
too cowardly to take responsibility for her
own actions.
The Row program should be applaud
ed, not exploited, for the purpose of
increasing readership. The latter is usual
ly accomplished through good writing
and legitimate news, not shoddy attempts
at investigative reporting.

Stanford student reacts to Diallo verdict
Good morning, Stanford. I write this

on Tuesday, Feb. 29, 2000. On this, the
last clay of the first Black History Month of
the new millennium, justice does not exist
for blacks in America.
In this, the 137 th year since the signing
of the Emancipation Proclamation, which
effectively ended slavery in the United
States, justice does not exist for blacks in
America.
In this, the 79th year since the seldom
taught, barely-known Tulsa Riot, in which
more than 3,000 blacks were killed, justice
does not exist for blacks in America.
On this, the 390 th day since a 24-year
old, unarmed black male was shot and
killed while standing in front of his Bronx,
New York apartment by four police offi
cers, justice does not exist for blacks in
America.
I'm sure to some readers, my claim of
the absence of justice seems outlandish,
but if one considers how America, Ameri
cans and the United States legal system
has celebrated each of the last two Black
History Months, the claim might not seem
quite so outlandish after all.
