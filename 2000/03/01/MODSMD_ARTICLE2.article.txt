# Possible sorority houses stir debate
## Res Ed's consideration of popular houses for Pi Phis upsets students 
### MARISA PAVLIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Some students have found the Office of Residential
Education's decision to house the Pi Phi sorority in Bob,
Narnia, Whitman or 680 Lomita controversial because
these houses have traditionally drawn very well.
Inter Sorority Council President Stephanie Blossom, a
senior, said these are the only houses being considered
right now for the Pi Phis. "After further analysis, if they're
all invalid, we'll create a new list," she said.
The future house must comply with American Dis
abilities Act guidelines and be large enough to house
the majority of the sorority, Res Ed Director Jane Ca-
marillo wrote in an e-mail
message.
She also acknowledged that a
majority of students who expressed
opinions about criteria for Greek
housing had additional concerns.
Specifically, these students sug
gested that houses that drew very
well or had a lot of singles or two
room doubles be excluded from
consideration. They also urged Res
lid not to select a house on the end
of the row closest to White Pla/a or
to create a concentrations of Greek
housing.
While none of the four houses
fulfill all of of the criteria set forth
by students, Res Ed plans to re
search the houses. Camarillo will
make the final decision after talk
ing with Dean of Students Marc
Wais and Vice Provost for' Student
Affairs James Montoya.
"Pi Phi feels very privileged
that the University lias offered us
a house," said Pi Phi President Jes
sica Sisco, a junior. "This will allow
us to strengthen our chapter in
ternally and expand our program
and efforts to the greater Stanford
community. We've very excited."
Some residents in these four
houses say they are displeased with
the prospect of the Pi Phis moving
into the houses.
Macy Lau, sophomore in Nar
nia, said she thinks housing the Pi

Phis in Narnia is "a terrible idea."
She said Narnia has a unique at
mosphere that should be pre
served.
"We always have a large turnout
at events. We're not isolated in
draw groups. A lot of old Narnians
comeback and become eating ;isso
ciates. We have an awesome com
munity and an open atmosphere,"
Lau said.
"It's not fair if the I'i Phis get a
house with such a high draw," Lau
said.
"Narnia is not ideal for them.
It's so fiu out â€” it's the farthest on
the lake. I'd be really, really sad to
see it turn into Greek housing,"
Lau said.
Lau said she thinks the former
Deke house would be a better
choice, because it was recently a
Greek house and is closer to most
campus activity.
Junior Amit Chadha, who lives
in Bob, said he thinks it would be
"detrimental'' if the sorority were
housed in Bob.
"I hope they don't get Bob," he
said. "Bob would be one more
place cut off from students and one
more place they can't draw into."
Senior Jennifer Gipperly feels it
would be "a real shame" if the Pi
Phis were housed in (>H() Lomita,
where she currently lives.
"There's been a lot of e-mail dis
cussion," she said. "A lot of people
are really upset."
She said that one of the house
managers has already started a pe
tition asking that Phi Delt be re

moved from the list (if possible Fi
Phi houses.
"They're taking away one of the
most popular residences. It's a real
loss to the general community," she
said. "We're not getting as much
back as we do by keeping it open,
especially since it has so many two
room doubles and it's a beautiful
house."
"There are other houses more
suited to what they're looking for,"
Cipperly said.
She added, "We just finished the
staff selection process for next year
and it's not very fair that the Uni
versity knew we were on the chop
ping block but let us think every
thing was fine."
Blossom said the policies of
Sorority Rush will remain the
same. Sororities are not allowed to
show rushees their houses.
"Housing is so new to sororities
[at Stanford]. It's only been an op
tion for the past three years. We
don't want (o make it unfair for un
housed sororities."
Blossom was informally in
volved in the decision to house Pi
Phi. As Inter Sorority Council pres
ident, she gave information to the
Greek Housing Review Council
about each chapter.
"1 provided insight about how
chapters handle themselves and
how they would behave if put into
a situation of being housed," she
said.
She said that "each application is
judged on how it meets the criteria.
It's straightforward."
