# THERE IS NO SPOON
## What Britney taught me 
### 
After Christina Aguilera's come
front-behind win at the Gram
my's last Wednesday, 1 felt com
pelled to answer a burning question of
national importance.
Yes. Britney was robbed.
Though certainly not as vocally

impressive as Christi
na Aguilera, Ms.
Spears should have
nabbed the Grammy
for Best New Artist
because of her blind
ing inspiration.
Scoff if you
must at the power of
Britney, but that for
mer Mickey Mouse

Clubber has shown
me the true path. And I'm not talking
about some Spice Girl's overhyped "girl
power." I'm talking the real deal. The
chance to change your life. All I really
need to know I learned from Britney
Spears.
Eook all around you. Every other
MTV video is a Backstreet Boys knock
off. Teen pop rules the airwaves, and
Ms. Spears is heading the revolution.
But it's not like bubblegum actually
left us. Remember New Kids on the
Block? It's the same old formula, just
in time for a new generation. There's
the young, blond kid. I lie older guy.
The lead singer Tiger Beat guy. And
Marky Mark's older brother. (Okay.
Maybe Backstreet doesn't have that
last one.)
Even MTV — who'd se II their
Nielsen ratings for another 'N Sync
video — recently satirized the boy band
effect by filming a fake boy group
singing fake songs (like the Monkees)
and showing the movie on their chan
nel. Perhaps it's not that surprising,
then, that MTV is successfully selling
their fake boy band CD in real record
stores.
But the bubblegum formula isn't lim
ited to just the guys. Their female coun
terparts have also discovered the secret
to teen pop success. Christina Aguilera
is the new Debbie Gibson — the one
who can sing. And Britney is the latest
Tiffany — another trailer park nialirat
who can't sing her way out of a paper
bag.
However, just because she's tone
cleaf doesn't mean that Britney can't be
an inspiration. Just look beyond her
inane songs and goofy choreography,
and you'll see a mind as crafty as any
morally corrupt Stanford student's.
With song lyrics like, "You drive me
crazy, I just can't sleep," "Sometimes I
run, sometimes I hide, sometimes I'm
scared of you," and, "Baby hit me one
more time," Ms. Spears is obviously in a
dysfunctional, abusive relationship. It's
really quite courageous of her.
By singing about her shattered emo
tional state — or at least her songwrit
er's shattered emotional state, she
allows all of us to realize that our li\cs

ARE better than hers. She empowers us
Stanford students with the cockiness
with which we left high school.
Britney also undertakes the thankless
task of destroying our remaining myths
about beauty. As a future porn star,
Britney's implants and plastic surgery
seem grossly unnatural and, yet,
strangely mesmerizing.
Don't let her tell you her breasts are
natural, either. You don't gain four cup
sizes between two videos through "diet
ing." By surgically altering her body,
Britney tells us it's okay to deform your
body for the sake of art (or money).
Imagine that.
Forget those three years of I-Bank
ing . . . er . . . corporate slavery after
graduation! Silicone implants will help
you get rich overnight! Why bother
being a corporate whore when you can
be a . . . no, too easy.
And the little Catholic schoolgirl uni
form? Not since Julia Roberts in "Pretty
Woman" has the vice industry been so
highly validated. (And not since Jodie
Foster in "Taxi Driver" do pedophiles
have such a reason to rejoice.)
But perhaps the most important
thing that Britney has taught me is that
mediocrity sells. You don't need to be
the best (or even halfway decent) at
something. You just need good publi
cists.
When I apply that to my Stanford
career, even the hardest classes become
instantly stress-free.
Don't bother going to (lass; just
know how to chat up a professor during
office hours. Don't bother handing in
your assignments on time; just know
how to whine at a teaching assistant and
grovel for an extension.
Come to think of it, maybe Christina
Aguilera was the best choice for a Best
New Artist Grammy. Kid Rock is ;m
"Entertainment Tonight" "Where Arc
They Now?" cover story waiting to hap
pen. (Bawida-what?)
Susan Tedeschi is alread) an "Enter
tainment Tonight" "Where Are I hev
Now?" cover story. And whv boi her j^i\ -
ing a Grammy to Macy Gray — a tal
ented original with a unique voice?
I lie only one left is Britney.
So call Britney an untalented liatk
performer who can't even sing live on
the Granum's. Call hei a lluke bub
bleguin sensation whose I ~> minutes are
almost up. Call her an unfortunate
example of today's dumbed down pop
ular culture.
We all know that Britney's got st,i\-
ing power — unless she takes invest
ment advice from MC Hammer.

I (Irian is a senior who will hopefully graduate
in June. You ean reach him al adrianhia Stan
ford.edu. He promises that I'.veryday People
will sing NO Britney Speais tunes al eilht i
their concert with the Yale l)nkes Men on
Sunday, March 5, or as hosts of the National
C.hanefiionshif) of Collegiate I C.appella Semi
final on Friday, March 3.

ing." By surgically altering her body,
Britney tells us it's okay to deform your
body for the sake of art (or money).
Imagine that.
Forget those three years of I-Bank
ing . . . er . . . corporate slavery after
graduation! Silicone implants will help
you get rich overnight! Why bother
being a corporate whore when you can
be a . . . no, too easy.
And the little Catholic schoolgirl uni
form? Not since Julia Roberts in "Pretty
Woman" has the vice industry been so
highly validated. (And not since Jodie
Foster in "Taxi Driver" do pedophiles
have such a reason to rejoice.)
But perhaps the most important
thing that Britney has taught me is that
mediocrity sells. You don't need to be
the best (or even halfway decent) at
something. You just need good publi
cists.
When I apply that to my Stanford
career, even the hardest classes become
instantly stress-free.
Don't bother going to (lass; just
know how to chat up a professor during
office hours. Don't bother handing in
your assignments on time; just know
how to whine at a teaching assistant and
grovel for an extension.
Come to think of it, maybe Christina
Aguilera was the best choice for a Best
New Artist Grammy. Kid Rock is ;m
"Entertainment Tonight" "Where Arc
They Now?" cover story waiting to hap
pen. (Bawida-what?)
Susan Tedeschi is alread) an "Enter
tainment Tonight" "Where Are I hev
Now?" cover story. And whv boi her j^i\ -
ing a Grammy to Macy Gray — a tal
ented original with a unique voice?
I lie only one left is Britney.
So call Britney an untalented liatk
performer who can't even sing live on
the Granum's. Call hei a lluke bub
bleguin sensation whose I ~> minutes are
almost up. Call her an unfortunate
example of today's dumbed down pop
ular culture.
We all know that Britney's got st,i\-
ing power — unless she takes invest
ment advice from MC Hammer.

I (Irian is a senior who will hopefully graduate
in June. You ean reach him al adrianhia Stan

will sing NO Britney Speais tunes al eilht i
their concert with the Yale l)nkes Men on
Sunday, March 5, or as hosts of the National
C.hanefiionshif) of Collegiate I C.appella Semi
