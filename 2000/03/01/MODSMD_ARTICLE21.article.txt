# FROM APATHY TO ACTIVISM
## Seeing marriage in a different light 
### MING WONG GUEST COLUMNIST 
Marriage is a runny thing. Kven as millions of straight people
are frantically trying to get out ol it (and to get out with as much
stuff as they can possibl) wrest from their soon-to-be ex-spouses),
millions ol queer people are trying to he allowed in.
Marriage reminds me ol the "clubs" I formed in my childhood,
with friends, which would pointedly exclude an arbitrary group of
people. 11 lis exclusion was a defining feature of the clubs, which
realh existed lor no other reason than to make their members feel
special.
Marriage, of course, is slightly clillerent. You still get to led spe
cial, .uid there are initiation rites and other fun things, but you also
get a huge welcome present from I ncle Sam, in the lorni of guar
antees ol certain rights to property, attorney, tax breaks and child
adoption (among others).
I his is not a recent phenomenon. Marriage has a history ol
excluding people from its ranks (remember the old anti-misce
genation laws). I he Yen definition of it contains the idea of exclu
sion. In ellcd, marriage is society's wa\ of saving: Some pairs of
people will be given special legal rights, and many other pairs of
people will not.
hi tlieorv, all you need to get married is to be in love and com
mitted to sta\ ing in a relationship (with someone of the appropri
ate age and opposite gender). In practice, the parenthetical
requirements are enforced more sti icth than the central one.
It's ver\ difficult to sa\ if two people are "really" in love with
eat h oilier. Reallv, it's hard enough trying to figure out if you're
in love with someone else. You have to respect, or at least be
ania/ed at, people who are romantic enough to still believe that
legal marriages are about anv'thing like love and commitment.
Most recently, with the lesbian couple in Hawaii, the Supreme
( mil l ruling in Vermont and Proposition 22 in ('alilbrnia's March
7 ballot, attention has been drawn to the issue of whether or not
same-sex marriage should be legal.
Interestingly, some queer radicals do not want sanie-sex mar

riage to be legalized. The argument for not allowing ourselves into
the "Marriage Club" is that marriage is an expression of oppres
sive patriarchy and a limit on human sexual freedom, which we as
liberated denizens of the queer world should not be endorsing by
our participation.
So, the "debate" about same-sex marriage goes something like
this: Pete Knight, the sponsor of proposition 22, and his ilk are
taunting us, in effect, with, "Nyah! No queers allowed in my spe
cial club!" To this, some queer radicals respond with the equiva
lent of, "Bleah! We don't want to be in your stupid club anyways!"
Meanwhile, others whine "Please let us in!" It's a charming state of
affairs.
I his is admittedly an over-simplification of this position, which
in the larger picture is not so much a negative evaluation of mar
riage as a positive affirmation of alternative living and loving
arrangements. 1 personally believe in this system of thinking about
human relationships but tend to agree more with thinkers who
would c arry it to its logical conclusion, that is, the abolition of mar
riage as a legal entity altogether.
Since marriage is unlikely to vanish any time sckjii (apparently
even thinking about it makes some people jittery), I would settle
for some basic equality. It is a little undignified, I know, to beg.
However, in the absence of a leader who will come along and tell
people to grow up and stop playing exclusionary games, it's better
than nothing.
If my (hypothetical) boyfriend and I decide that we want to get
married and live just like our parents did (assuming our parents
were married), legal rights and all, we should be allowed to as long
as heterosexuals are allowed to. It's a free country.
I lomosexuals are allowed to smoke, we are allowed to drink to
excess, we are allowed to wear fur, we are even allowed to join the
Republican party. All manner of idiotic and unethical behaviors
are legal, why not something that isn't at all idiotic and unethical
to so many people â€” same-sex marriage?
