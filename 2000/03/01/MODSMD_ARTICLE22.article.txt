# Expansion of Lane Library planned
## 
### ELLIE RITCH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After narrowly escaping probation for
inadequate teaching and library facilities
last year, the Stanford Medical School is
extensively renovating the Lane Medical
Library.
When the renovations are complete,
the library should have new computer
and simulation labs, more meeting space
for students, as well as new bathrooms
and air conditioning, both of which the li
brary currently lacks.
Poor conditions at the library were a
key reason why the Liaison Committee
on Mediefil Education, tlie national
board that accredits medical schools,
gave the school a poor accreditation rat
ing last April.
A major issue spurring the library's
renovation has been a lack of space. The
Lane Library is wedged between two
classrooms. However, Thomas Rind
fleisch, director of Lane Library, said the
Medical School has plans to ameliorate
this problem.

"The staff offices will be moved out of
the library to clear up space for public
functions and new technologies. Part of
the older and more historical document
collections will be moved to off-site loca
tions that are still accessible," Rindfleisch
said.
Problems with the library have existed
for many years. The accreditation survey
has listed many of the same issues every
year since 1983. Lane Library was built in
the 19505.
This newly approved project is just
one aspect of a $ 185 million plan for new
construction at the Medical School. The
construction will be finished by 2004.
Without accreditation from the
LCME, Medical School graduates would
be ineligible for the United States Med
ical Licensing Examination, a test one
must pass to legally practice medicine in
the United States.
Students also had a role in bringing li
brary conditions to the Medical School's
attention. A petition signed by 99 percent
of the Medical School student body last
spring demanded better teaching facili

ties and helped set the tone foe the
LCME's blunt assessment of the Medical
School.
The extensive modifications to the li
brary, which will add 3,500 square feet to
the building, must be approved under
Stanford's proposed Land Use Plan for
the next ten years. The renovations will
also use space currently occupied by the
Edwards building and its adjacent patio.
"We have had to rethink how the li
brary is laid out. The Edwards building
will be entirely torn down, and the new li
brary entrance will come 112 rom that direc
tion. The entry way to the new library will
be built covering the courtyard in an atri
um-type fashion," Rindfleisch said. "Our
main goal is to move Lane Library to
wards digital media and materials.
()ne of the new additions will be a sim
ulation laboratory that will help students
learn through computer models of vari
ous organisms and systems. For exam
ple, students will be able to.use the system
to practice injecting a needle into the
veins of simulated younger patients,
older patients and even drug users.
