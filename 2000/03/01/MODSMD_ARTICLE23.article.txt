## Sports Illustrated meets 'Real World' 
### 
I have a vision. This vision came
to me as I was flipping
through the pages of my
newly arrived Sports Illustrat
ed Swimsuit Issue. Many visions
have come to many men in these cir
cumstances, but few of them are
printable.
lliis was not one of those types of

visions, though.
My vision was
grander, and it
came to me spec i
fically when I was
checking out the
"athletes and
their wives" sec
tion of the issue.
For the uniniti
ated in the audi-

ence, this is a feature SI started
doing a couple years after they
made the swimsuit issue a stand
alone special, rather than replacing
a week of actual sports coverage.
The idea, apparently, is that by in
cluding pictures of beautiful women
in skimpy bikinis who are married
to famous athletes, or occasionally
famous athletes themselves, SI can
continue to claim that they are cov
ering sports as opposed to merely
covering a few square inches of skin

with gold lame and body paint.
What struck me about the sec
tion anew this year is the continuing
convergence of SI with People
Magazine. SI, and indeed every
sports journalism organization in
the world, try their darndest to pre
serve their image as an athletics —
rather than an athlete — centered
institution.
But, of course, athletes and their
fame and their money and their rap
careers and their felony convictions
sell papers and ads just as well as any
celebrity.
This is why "Up ( '.lose" and " The
Last Word" and other up-close
and-personal athlete talk shows
thrive.
This is why every newspaper and
magazine in the world features the
human-interest features about the
heartbreak and trauma and person
al struggle that the athlete had to
undergo to triumph in his or her
arena.
Liking human interest doesn't
make you bad — it's makes you
human. Everyone wants to have
more reasons to love or hate the
members of the teams they already

love or hate.
And from this sprang my vision.
"Real World: Major Leagues."
The premise is simple. We'll
pick the NFL, but the same sce
nario could apply to any pro, semi
pro, or collegiate athletics league
Ux)king to make some cash and
garner some unbelievable ratings.
Pick two teams. Two teams that
won't much rniss any of their
starters. I'll go out on a limb here
and suggest the 49ers and the
Raiders.
Take those 50-odd guys out to a
tropical island, with any and all at
tractive wives / family members /
agents / flunkies / high school bud
dies they care to bring. Make sure
all the cheerleaders and Anna
Kournikova get included.
Stock the closets and bureaus
well with brand-name swim trunks
for the men and bikinis three sizes
too small for the women.

Put cameras everywhere — in
the trees, the dorms, the practice
footballs, the urinals.
Then have them play some foot
ball every couple of days. Between
games, they can live their lives and
get filmed. Maybe to add some
"Road Rules"-esque flavor, you
could move the playing field
around to the top of a volcano, say,
or to an alligator-infested swamp.
Whoever wins the most games
in a season gets to go home. Who
ever loses gets left on the island
with no food, or possibly they're
forced to watch Leonardo Di-
Caprio's new one, "The Beach,"
continuously.
Everyone would watch this.
Let's be clear: everyone would
watch this.
Imagine the story-lines.
Clan the Raiders overcome de
hydration, snakebite and wife
swapping to roll to victory?
Can Steve Young stay pure and
resist Anna's temptations?
Can Charles Woodson brew
beer from coconuts? Hilarity en

sues when his girlfriend finds the
hidden tank in her bikini drawer!
American popular culture,
dominated by the young male de
mographic, is converging inex
orably to this peak.
It's the WWF, the swimsuit
issue, "Who Wants To Marry A
Multimillionaire," the Pro Bowl,
Sports Center and Maxim all rolled
into one. You can't fight it.
Other franchises could follow.
Can Ken Griffey, Jr. out-slug Mark
McGwire on the field — and in the
hotel bar? Will Dick Vitale survive
when the Duke Blue Devils run
out of meat and turn to cannibal
ism?
Si's on the right track with the
"athletes in swimsuits" idea. They
just need to take it a bit farther.
Sun, fun, skin, marital infidelity
and ACL tears. It's what everyone
wants. SI just needs to give it to us.

Jeff Cooper, a junior, would like to
apologize to Emily St. Thomas for not
writing about lacrosse. There, you 'rein
the Daily.
