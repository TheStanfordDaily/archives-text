## Sports Illustrated meets 'Real World' 
### 
I have a vision. This vision came
to me as I was flipping
through the pages of my
newly arrived Sports Illustrat
ed Swimsuit Issue. Many visions
have come to many men in these cir
cumstances, but few of them are
printable.
lliis was not one of those types of

visions, though.
My vision was
grander, and it
came to me spec i
fically when I was
checking out the
"athletes and
their wives" sec
tion of the issue.
For the uniniti
ated in the audi-

ence, this is a feature SI started
doing a couple years after they
made the swimsuit issue a stand
alone special, rather than replacing
a week of actual sports coverage.
The idea, apparently, is that by in
cluding pictures of beautiful women
in skimpy bikinis who are married
to famous athletes, or occasionally
famous athletes themselves, SI can
continue to claim that they are cov
ering sports as opposed to merely
covering a few square inches of skin

with gold lame and body paint.
What struck me about the sec
tion anew this year is the continuing
convergence of SI with People
Magazine. SI, and indeed every
sports journalism organization in
the world, try their darndest to pre
serve their image as an athletics —
rather than an athlete — centered
institution.
But, of course, athletes and their
fame and their money and their rap
careers and their felony convictions
sell papers and ads just as well as any
celebrity.
This is why "Up ( '.lose" and " The
Last Word" and other up-close
and-personal athlete talk shows
thrive.
This is why every newspaper and
magazine in the world features the
human-interest features about the
heartbreak and trauma and person
al struggle that the athlete had to
undergo to triumph in his or her
arena.
Liking human interest doesn't
make you bad — it's makes you
human. Everyone wants to have
more reasons to love or hate the
members of the teams they already
