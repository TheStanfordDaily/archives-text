# San Jose State slams Stanford
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 2 Cardinal (11-5)
squandered a wonderful outing
from junior Jason Young in his re
turn from injury as it dropped a
mid-week night game 4-1 to the
San Jose State Spartans (10-3).
More important than the result
in the nonconference game
against the Spartans was the per
formance of the Cardinal ace.
Young looked impressive in his
first start on the mound since in
juring his shoulder early in a Feb.
1 1 start at Florida State. Last night,
Young struck out two Spartan bat
ters, throwing only 12 pitches in
the top of the first inning.
He continued to mow through
the San Jose State lineup, allowing
only one base runner until head
coach Mark Marquess pulled him
after his third inning of work in
favor of sophomore Dan Rich.
The 43 pitches Young threw
was a small sum but gave enough
of an indication of Young's recov
ery to give Stanford a bit of opti
mism about his return to the regu
lar starting rotation.

The most encouraging sign for
the Cardinal about Young's re
turn to dominance was his curve
ball, a pitch that he relies on which
can be troublesome for pitchers
coming back from shoulder in
juries.
He put tremendous movement
on the ball without any signs of
pain, giving Marquess and pitch
ing coach Tom Koonis exactly
what they wanted last night.
Young "threw really well, his
arm felt gtxxl, and he had gr eat ve
locity and control," Marquess said.
"It was a very good outing for him."
The Stanford coaching staff
wanted to limit Young's start to
around 45 pitches in order to ease
along his recovery as well as give
other members of the Cardinal
bullpen an opportunity to get
some work. However, Young
made the coaches' decision to lift
him from the game a difficult one,
striking out four hitters and not
surrendering a hit to a Spartan
team batting .275 on the season.
"It was nice to be able to come
out and face some batters again,"
Young said. "I'm feeling perfect
right now."
Once Young exited the ball
game, Rich promptly gave up a pair
of walks and a single to load the
bases. Junior John Fagan followed
with a towering shot to left field off a
two out, 1-0 fastball for a grand slam
that gave the Spartans the early lead.
The mistake gave Rich his second
loss in two relief appearances.
The Cardinal's offensive woes
continued after manufacturing a
first-inning run on senior John
Gall's sacrifice fly. Spartan starter
Steve Murphy, who had pitched just
one-third of an inning in his senior
campaign, went six and one-third
strong innings and struck out six
Stanford batters for the win.

Stanford did have opportunities
against the right-handed Murphy to
push runs across the plate, but
stranded nine runners before Mur
phy came to the mound in the sev
enth. The Cardinal could not con
vert its scoring chances, remaining
stagnant at the plate in the cold air at
Sunken Diamond.
Marquess did use the mid-week
game to give his bullpen some
much-needed activity on the
mound, handing the ball to five dif
ferent pitchers last night. Aside from
Rich's two-out fastball leaving the
yard, Cardinal relievers did a good
job keeping their team in the game.
However, any hopes of a late-in
ning comeback died as Gall lined out
deep to right field to end the Cardi
nal ninth stranding one on base.
Playing from behind has been an
issue with the Stanford team early in
the season, and continued last night

as hitters could not get anything
started at the plate after the Spar
tans' grand slam.
Marquess believes that his team's
offensive issues are not related to
(ailing behind early but speak to a
general lack of activity at the plate.
"We haven't really swung the bat
well all season," he said. "We've
scored runs in spurts, but hitting so
poorly as a team is not going to get
the job done."
Young's outing encouraged
coaches so much that he may have
earned himself a Sunday start at
home against Santa Clara in which 1 le
could throw as many as 70 pitches de
pending on how his shoulder feels.
If Young can reclaim his spot in
the Cardinal rotation, it would pro
vide the team with some much
needed dominance on the mound
in order to overcome a disappoint
ing team slump with the bats.
