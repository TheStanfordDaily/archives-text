# San Jose State slams Stanford

### BRETT KAUFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 2 Cardinal (11-5)
squandered a wonderful outing
from junior Jason Young in his re
turn from injury as it dropped a
mid-week night game 4-1 to the
San Jose State Spartans (10-3).
More important than the result
in the nonconference game
against the Spartans was the per
formance of the Cardinal ace.
Young looked impressive in his
first start on the mound since in
juring his shoulder early in a Feb.
1 1 start at Florida State. Last night,
Young struck out two Spartan bat
ters, throwing only 12 pitches in
the top of the first inning.
He continued to mow through
the San Jose State lineup, allowing
only one base runner until head
coach Mark Marquess pulled him
after his third inning of work in
favor of sophomore Dan Rich.
The 43 pitches Young threw
was a small sum but gave enough
of an indication of Young's recov
ery to give Stanford a bit of opti
mism about his return to the regu
lar starting rotation.

The most encouraging sign for
the Cardinal about Young's re
turn to dominance was his curve
ball, a pitch that he relies on which
can be troublesome for pitchers
coming back from shoulder in
juries.
He put tremendous movement
on the ball without any signs of
pain, giving Marquess and pitch
ing coach Tom Koonis exactly
what they wanted last night.
Young "threw really well, his
arm felt gtxxl, and he had gr eat ve
locity and control," Marquess said.
"It was a very good outing for him."
The Stanford coaching staff
wanted to limit Young's start to
around 45 pitches in order to ease
along his recovery as well as give
other members of the Cardinal
bullpen an opportunity to get
some work. However, Young
made the coaches' decision to lift
him from the game a difficult one,
striking out four hitters and not
surrendering a hit to a Spartan
team batting .275 on the season.
"It was nice to be able to come
out and face some batters again,"
