# Life hits the road for softball

Passengers bustle about, in and out of the airport termi
nals, clutching briefcases and diaper hags, self-absorbed and
anxious to be on their way.
Yet,a group of sixteen college women have mastered the
art of turning heads this past month, even at the tumultuous
San Francisco airport.
l'hey are the Stanford women's softball team, presently
16-1, an almost Unthinkable record for a team that went var
sity as recently as 1994.
Led by head coach John Kittman, this year's roster threat
ens to be one of the most successful in the school's history, al
ready having leveled traditional national powerhouses, such
as No. 19 Long Beach State and No. 25 Oklahoma State.
ft is one month into the season and already it has been a
long, but rewarding journey.
The team will compete in its last of lour tournaments on
the road this weekend as the\ head to Columbus, Georgia.
"If we have enough time, we'll dress up lor our road trips.
And in our travel sweats we are a very conspicuous group.

People come up to us all the time, wanting to know who we
are, where we're from, if we are winning," said senior catch
er Kellie YViginton with a laugh. "Yup, you can meet some
pretty 'interesting' people in airports."
Yet, none of the players seem to mind the attention.
I liese clays, it's just fun to bask in the glory that all their hard
work and dedication has afforded them.
"Sometimes people will mistake us for the women's bas
ketball team," Wiginton said. "1 mean, we have a few tall girls
on our team, but basketball?"
Junior right-fielder Ramona Shelburne has experienced
the same scenarios of mistaken identity.
"I mean, basketball? I'ms'2". But, you answer their ques
tions and are flattered by their curiosity. After all, they don't
know that 50 other people already asked you that question
today."
It is a tough schedule. Leave after classes on Thursday,
play five tournament games over the weekend, return home
late Sunday night, tackle school the next morning, practice
a couple times during the week, and then get set to do it all
over again come Thursday evening.

But as Rittman points out, this
chaotic lifestyle is nothing new to the
talented young players on his
squad, who played travel ball year
round, some since they were twelve.
"They are used to having to
manage and balance their time ef
fectively. In fact, I always find they
perform better winter quarter in the
classroom than any other time, lo
calise they can't afford to procrasti
nate. Besides, the away tourna
ments are something we have to do.
'Hie competition travels to play the
best teams. And so we must."
The past three tournaments
have afforded Stanford the oppor
tunity to prove itself nationally and
gain ranking for post-season bids.
So far, Stanford has made quite
the impression.
The Cardinal went undefeated
at its first tournament in Phoenix on
February 11-13.
On three days rest, the team pro
ceeded to earn the championship
trophy at the Camplx-ll / Cartier
Classic in Poway the next weekend,
surpassing No. 5 Fresno State.
Last weekend, Stanford bull
dozed five more teams in Utah at
the Red Desert Classic, dropping
none and improving their record to
16-1 overall.
It seems as if life equals Softball
these days for the pack of sixteen.
"Going on the road has it's up
side and down side," Shelburne
said. "It keeps you focused mentally
on the job at hand. But, you are liv
ing out of a bag for three weeks. By

the time you get back, there is this
dash to get all your errands done
and then you're leaving again."
However, as Rittman explains,
"The players aren't traveling any
more than any other team in the
conference. It just happens to be
four weeks in a row. Laptops are
dragged along, papers are faxed to
professors, tests are taken on the
road. It's not ideal, but somehow
everything gets done."
Two years ago, Stanford played
two tournaments back to back, last
year it was three. And now, in keep
ing with the trend, the team is up to
four. To the seven freshman, life on
the road has become the routine.
"Everyone's been pretty good
about staying ahead in their school
work, doing work in the airports,
and talking to profs and T.A.s be
forehand, instead of playing catch
up," YViginton said. "I've been espe
cially impressed with the freshman,
considering it usually takes time to
develop the time management skills
you need."
The weekends are jam packed
not only with Softball, but <x)dles of
laughter from those "you had to be
there" kind of moments, evenings
in front of "Saturday Night Live"
after an exhausting double-header,
and vicious debates over where to
get dessert.
After all, "Coach has to have his
desert," Shelburne said.
Fortunately, the team seems to
be getting along exceptionally well.
The players ride and room with dif
ferent people to mix things up each
weekend. But, above all, they are
aware what their main job is on the
road, to play and play well.

"There haven't been any prob
lems yet. I think our group is really
special in that it is not often you
could take a group of sixteen girls,
who spend almost all their time to
gether, four weeks in a row, and not
have any issues."
In fact, the only fighting seems to
revolve around who gets to claim
the front benches in the four vans
the team takes to the field each
morning because you can't hear
anything from the back seat.
And of course, there's the idio
syncratic details that add flavor to
the trips, â€” arguments over who
gets first shower or what time to set
the morning wake-up call for.
All the important issues.
Perhaps, then, the greatest part
about the Cardinal's month on the
road has not necessarily been the in
tense competition. Although crucial
to the team's success, so is the cama
raderie the players are gaining
through such experiences.
"I know Kellie will order a cran
berry juice on the plane and I will
order a ginger ale. I even know
what Jess wants when we go to
Chile's," Shelburne said.
Those are the precious tidbits
that will be recalled years from now
with a smile just as much as a victor)
over No. 23 Massachusetts will.
Who knows, maybe even more
so.
"My only complaint are those
Southwest Airline's Magazine cross
word puzzles," Shelburne said.
"We've been on so many flights this
past month that we have the Febru
ary clues memorized."
Hang in there, ladies. March is
just around the corner.
