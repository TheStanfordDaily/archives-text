# Life hits the road for softball

Passengers bustle about, in and out of the airport termi
nals, clutching briefcases and diaper hags, self-absorbed and
anxious to be on their way.
Yet,a group of sixteen college women have mastered the
art of turning heads this past month, even at the tumultuous
San Francisco airport.
l'hey are the Stanford women's softball team, presently
16-1, an almost Unthinkable record for a team that went var
sity as recently as 1994.
Led by head coach John Kittman, this year's roster threat
ens to be one of the most successful in the school's history, al
ready having leveled traditional national powerhouses, such
as No. 19 Long Beach State and No. 25 Oklahoma State.
ft is one month into the season and already it has been a
long, but rewarding journey.
The team will compete in its last of lour tournaments on
the road this weekend as the\ head to Columbus, Georgia.
"If we have enough time, we'll dress up lor our road trips.
And in our travel sweats we are a very conspicuous group.

People come up to us all the time, wanting to know who we
are, where we're from, if we are winning," said senior catch
er Kellie YViginton with a laugh. "Yup, you can meet some
pretty 'interesting' people in airports."
Yet, none of the players seem to mind the attention.
I liese clays, it's just fun to bask in the glory that all their hard
work and dedication has afforded them.
"Sometimes people will mistake us for the women's bas
ketball team," Wiginton said. "1 mean, we have a few tall girls
on our team, but basketball?"
Junior right-fielder Ramona Shelburne has experienced
the same scenarios of mistaken identity.
"I mean, basketball? I'ms'2". But, you answer their ques
tions and are flattered by their curiosity. After all, they don't
know that 50 other people already asked you that question
today."
It is a tough schedule. Leave after classes on Thursday,
play five tournament games over the weekend, return home
late Sunday night, tackle school the next morning, practice
a couple times during the week, and then get set to do it all
over again come Thursday evening.
