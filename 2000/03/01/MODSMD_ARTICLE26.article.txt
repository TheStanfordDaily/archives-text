# Ticket lottery is unfair
## 
### 
The NCAA tournament is still two weeks away,
but as we usher in the first day of March, mad
ness has already set in at the Stanford .Athlet
ics Department.
The folks in the department are understandably
crazy about the top-ranked Cardinal men's team, which
seems poised for a deep tournament run. But they're
certifiably nuts if they think their system for allocating
student tournament tic kets is fair.
At the beginning of the season, the basketball market
ing office introduced Stanford to the Justairive card— a
first-of-its kind ticketing system that sells an unlimited
number of unguaranteed seats and rewards the most
die-hard fans by ensuring them spots at the season's
biggest games.
The new system worked well. Stanford students
didn't have to camp out for weeks in Oc tolx*r to buy sea
son tickets, and they pack Maples Pavilion whether the
team plays Arizona or Marathon ()il. Pi e-game lines are
long but bearable.
Students, many of whom eyed the plan with skepti
cism in the fall, now seem largely to favor it. It sa fail sys
tem, they say. The best fans earn the best seats.
Except when it comes to the playoffs.
Athletics Department officials announced this week
that the fans with the most points, earned from game at-

tendance throughout the season,
might find themselves ticketless
when the tournament tips off March
16.
A weighted lottery will allocate
Stanford's tickets for each step on
the tournament ladder. Students
will get one chance in the drawing
for eveiy 10 fanaddict points — the
equivalent of one game attended —
they've earned throughout the year.
Statistically speaking, the lottery
should grant tickets to fans with the
most points. But lotteries have a
funny way of acting up on you (just
ask the LA Clippers), and tfie girl
who's been to every home game
might find herself home watching
CBS at tourney time.
In past years, chance was just part
of the post season game. Students
entered drawings and crossed their

fingers for tic kets. But this year was
different, fans thought — being a
die-hard actually meant something.
Stanford already had a good sys
tem for allocating high-demand
tickets: guarantee 50 to 75 percent of
the tickets to students with the most
points, then pass out the rest on a
first-come, first-served basis.
With a few tweaks, that plan
could have worked for the playoffs.
The University should have
started with a form like it uses now,
asking students to request tickets
for any venue site where they
would be willing to travel, because
the team won't know where it's
going until Selection Sunday on
March 12.
()nce the pairings are set athletics
department officials should use the
Justarrive database to set a cut-off
point that guarantees seats to the top
half to three-quarters of point hold
ers who want them.
One notable exception: the de

partment should throw out points
earned in the four games over win
ter break, an unfair advantage for
students 112 rom the Bay Area.
The weighted lottery comes in
after the guaranteed seats go, allo
cating the remaining seats.
Finally, the school should guar
antee tickets throughout the tour
nament to anyone who makes the
first-round trek and wants to keep
going. Currently, separate lotteries
will decide who gets seats at each of
the three locations (first round,
Sweet Sixteen and Final Four) that
Stanford could reach if it survives to
play for a national title.
Speculating about Stanford's title
hopes before the end of the Pacific
10 Conference season is a guaran
teed way to make Cardinal head
coach Mike Montgomery crazy. But
pulling the rug out from under
Stanford students who bought into a
system built on fairness is worse.
It's sheer madness.
