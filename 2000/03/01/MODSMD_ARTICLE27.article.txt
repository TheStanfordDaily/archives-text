# California awaits undefeated Card
## 
### SAMEER AHMED STAFF WRITER 
If one team has completely dominated another
throughout the history of a sport, would the teams
still be considered rivals?
Since the beginning of men's collegiate tennis.
No. 2 Stanford (iS-O, 2-0 Pacific-10 Conference) lias
posted an unprecedented 67-9 record over sup
posed rival California (4-1, 1-1 Pac-10).
In its final match of the quarter, Stan lord will
meet the Bears today at 1:30 p.m. in Berkeley as the
Cardinal will attempt to add another win to its un
defeated season. Last year, Stanford downed the
Bears, 6-1, in both of their regular season meetings.
Stanford's dominance over Cal in men's tennis
probably lias more to do with the (lardinal s excel
lence than the Bears' mediocrity.
Stanford is coming off a huge weekend in which
it captured the team title at the I S I VI I A National
Team Indoor Championship, the premier collegiate
team event of the season, in Louisville, Kentucky- In
the tournament, Stanford defeated main quality
opponents, including No. 8 Illinois and No. 7 1 (LA
in the final.
" The Indoor tournament was a great win lor us,'
said head coach Dick Could. "Our guys competed
really well down the line. People were a little sur
prised by our victory."
It is especially impressive that Stanford continues
to win without one of itstop players, sophomore K.J.
Hippensteel, ranked third in the country. Hippen

steel is indefiniteh out with a case ol mononuc leosis.
I lie rest of the team lias been playing phenomenal
ly in his absence. All si\ players who competed last
weekend had important wins at the National I eani
Indoors.
Besides Hippensteel. Stanford's other highly
ranked plavers in singles are junior Alex Kim, the

No. 2 player in the country, and senior Geoff
Abrams, ranked sixth. Juniors Scotty Scott and Ali
Ansari and freshmen David Martin and Scott Lipsky
make up the rest of the top six.
In doubles, Kim and Abrams are the No. 1 duo in
the nation.
Cloach Gould wants to see how his players will
react to their outstanding performance in the Na
tional Team Indoors.
"We cannot let down [after winning the Indoor
title]," Gould said. "Gal is always tough for us out
there. Our guys are a bit beat up and jet lagged,
and this will be a good test for their mental tough
ness."
With only one loss this season, the Bears are a
solid team, and the Cardinal must be ready to com
pete. Gal's top three singles players are junior Erik
Dmytruk and freshmen John Paul Fruttero and
Robert Kowlaczyk. Fruttero and Kowlaczyk were
both ranked in the top ten in the country during
high school. However, Gal will probably be missing
another key player, junior Adrian Barnes. Barnes
did not play in Gal's last two matches and probably
won't play today either.
In doubles, Gal is led by the No. 21 ranked duo of
Dmytruk and junior Scott kintz. So far this season,
Dmytruk and Kintz are undefeated in dual match
play.
After defeating Oregon and losing to Washington
last week, Gal is situated in the middle of the Pac-10
in which Stanford, UCLA, and USC have established
themselves as the three top teams so far this year.
