In May of last year, I applied for and received an Under
graduate Research Opportunities Creative Arts (irant to
ride my bicycle from I ancoiwei; British Columbia to Ti
juana, Mexico and photograph along the way. Joining
me was Erik Larsen, my best friend since kindergarten.
He is currently double majoring in Sociology and Ceog
raphy at UCIA. Without him, this trip probably would
not have happened and def initely would not have been
completed as fast. But there is a question to be asked:
Why did we do it ?

Erik and I have enjoyed bike riding ever since grade
school. In sixth grade, he became the first kid to start
riding to school. By the time seventh grade rolled
around, 1 had convinced my parents to allow me to
ride every morning the lour miles from my house to Paul Re
vere Junior 1 ligh, and to ride every alter"noon back up again.
I felt oh-so grown-up.
Soon, Krik and I noticed that ours were the only bikes
locked up in front ol the school on a daily basis. This became
a source of pride. For the next two years we rode even on the
unusual day that a ride was offered by our parents. Sickness
became the only acceptable excuse.
In a month or two, feeling proud wasn't enough. We need
ed something new to keep us entertained. This something
s< ion discovered to be an orange tree marking the point where

our respective routes home went their separate ways. Day after day, we took a seat on the
wooden bollards flanking the dusty driveway, and made up game after game after game
to play with those oranges. We lined them upon the road so that ;i single car would squash
as mail) as possible. ()ur record is still standing at seventeen. We tossed them into the bay
of moving pickup trucks, dump trucks and garbage trucks and determined the winner
based on the best percentage. We picked a particular rock in the stone wall guarding the
house across the street and spent hours trying to hit it. We had orange eating contests. We
had orange peeling contests. We juggled them; we bowled them; we stomped them; and
threw them as far as we could. We did everything you can think of to do with oranges, and
probably quite a few that you can't. We had a fine time.
After the customary two hours were spent, we saddled up and rac ed each other home.
I had farther to go — three and a half'miles — but his route was much steeper. As soon as
I got home, I threw down the bike, whipped out my keys, and tore into the living room,
reaching for the phone. I dialed his number, and il it rang more than four times, I began
pumping my fist, readying insults. Regrettably, more times than not, I was the one with
the unenviable task of answering the ringing phone. Most often, I began with the patent
ed comeback, "I know you are but what am I?," in response to the similarly scathing,
"Slow-poke, slow-poke, slow-poke" (bant coming from the other end of the line.
When the insults had been exchanged and breathing returned to normal, we recount-

t'd the details of our respective trips home, usually accompanied l>\ laughter brought on
by the remembered pain.
At some point, one of lis exclaimed. "()kay. So you think that was hard? I hink how
hard it would be to ride toC '.anada! '. The thought of doing such a thing was a concept our
thirteen -year-old minds struggled to v\ rap themselves around.
It seemed ridiculous and hilarious; it became a running joke. But not long afterwards,
we were talking, with all the seriousness we could muster, about actualh doing it.
By the time high school rolled around, basketball had become a big part ol my lile, as
running had in his, and our daily riding regiment was crowded out. We hiked onh spo
radically throughout high school; most often on the dirt roads criss-crossing the Santa
Monica Mountains, sometimes down to Venice Beach, and verv occasionalh t<» school.
()ur grand plans had fallen, more or less, by the side of the road and staved there until last
year.
Then one of us — I'm convinced it was me. he's coin inced it was him — brought them
up again. A month of discussion settled it. We were going to ride from ( .anada to Mexico.
Editor's Mole: Today's section, "Stiajishots." is the first in <i saws of monthly, sfurud li Sections that
The Daily xeill cover concerning student life, in and outside of Stanford.


We started in Vancouver, ferried to
Victoria, caught another one to Port
Angeles, headed west 80 miles to
the coast, and then hugged the Pa
cific all the way to Tijuana.
