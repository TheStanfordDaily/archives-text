Right on schedule, the train tarrying
Krik, me and two bicycles, pulled
into Vancouver, British Columbia.
I he first thing we did was leave the
guide book — our lift-blood — on tin* train.
Wedowhat we do for the next 24 days: hop
on our bikes arid ride. We spent the first hour
of our epic journey nervously searching for
another guide l)ook. Luckily, on the train
from Seattle, each of us spent an hour copying
directions onto the backs of our hands to pre
vent constant stopping-fbr-direction consulta
tion.
We knew how to get 112 rom the depot to the
main part of town. Beyond that, we were lost.
Six miles later, we stumbled onto a bookstore.
Miraculously, they had the exact same book in
stock. It turns out that this particular guide
book is commonly referred to among tourers
as the "Bicycle Bible." A dog-eared, sweat
spotted copy was to be found hidden some
where in the luggage of every cyclist on the
route. It provides unsurpassed, incredible de
tail . . . turn-left-on-32nd St.-and-Matna-
John's-Bakery-is-t he-fbu rth-st ore-on-your
left kind of detail.
Book in hand, we were off. We burst
through town, scarcely slopping to soak up
Vancouver's multiple charms. We paused
briefly in 112 ront of what is purported to be the
world's greatest anthropology museum and
carefully considered going in for a total ol five
seconds before shrugging our shoulders and
pushing on. We were on a mission; we had a
ferry to catch; and we would not be slowed
down by such triflings.
The ferry dropped us off, just as dusk was
falling, in a place called Swart/ Bay about 25
miles north of Victoria. We discovered, upon
consulting our trusty guidebook, that a ( amp
site by the name ol Royal Oak was located
eight miles outside of town. We coasted by,
saw no signs, rode back, coasted by again, and
again saw no signs. Now, well after dark, we
questioned a number of locals, one ol whom
said, "I've lived here my entire life, and I've
never, ever heard of a place like that. In fad, I
think the place you boys are mentioning is
now a garbage dump."

l lu* locals suggested lidding down alongside Beaver
I .ake, and for lark of a belter option, we took tlieii adv i< e.
A blind ride down a forested path put us at shore. I lasti
ly, we unwrapped the sleeping bags and the snndwiehes
we had picked up at a nearby gas station. Exhausted, rav
enous and still wet with sweat, we c limbed into the bags
and took refuge in the roast beef. It was wonderful. We
rode (>4 miles that dav.
