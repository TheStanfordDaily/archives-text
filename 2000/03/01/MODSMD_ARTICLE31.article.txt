Two hours of gear grinding plated us at Ruby
Beach, die Mil's first ol many contact points
with the I'acilu Ocean, a steÂ«id\ companion
lor the rest ol the trip. I relished the opportu

niiy to look .it something besides trees. We both relished
11 it- < banc e to stretch our legs and run sand through our
toes. Presenting a camera to a stranger provided an ex
< use to climb up the backside of one of the many rocks,
111111 si our heads through the wind carved holes, and
grin like C heshire cats. A gently curving stream provided
the perfect venue for a rock skipping contest.
In the late afternoon, just before turning off the
101 and into the Olympic National Park rain forest
loi the night, I found myself talking to a kid, maybe
twelve years of age, donning full camouflage and rid
ing a bike ol his own. I fe was looping la/ily around
iu c ircles outside a trailer. I asked if there was a store
up the road where we could buy provisions for the
night, and he said, "Yes. Jus' 'round the corner up
I here." I hen, just before wheeling oil, I asked him what
sort of bike he was riding.
I le broke into a big grin and said with contagious ex
uberance, "A I lufFv!"


Just outside the town of Raymond, Wash, we stumbled upon Pete's Auto Body Shop. The car out front
stood as a testament to the quality of Pete's Work.


This porcupine in northern Washington was one of a disturbingly high number of
dead animals strewn along the side of the highway.
