In spite <>112 till' previous night, the morning was
wonderful. W'e rode b\ one place proclaiming
themselves "Clainelot," another sign reading
"Junk & Stnll lor Sale" and yet another advertis

Marked by an earlv start, perlect weather and a gen
tly rolling terrain, it was a wonderful day ol riding. We
passed through Raymond, a tow n seemingh obsessed
with iron sculptures. K.very ten leet along the road, graz
ing elk, a wallowing pig or a gardener stands artist icalh
posed, all in mid-thought, and all ol I hem cast in iron.
Leaving town, we passed by Fete s .Auto Pody Shop.
A car with a crumpled hood and i\ v growing out ol the
windows, stood out in front asa testament to the <|iialii\
of Pete's craftsmanship. I left with smile on im lace.
Eighty miles later, sunset was nearing, so we made
our way to North Point and ('.ape Disappointment to
view the lighthouses. A glorious sunset necessitated a
photograph, so I went up to an elderly couple and asked
the woman if she wouldn't mind. Plight, twinkh eyes lit
up a line covered in smile lines as she answered, "You
got it honey!"
While she lined it up, confusion over the direction I
had designated spawned a small argument between
them. In hopes of dispelling the argument. I ollerecl,
"Maybe if your wife moved over here." I he man, who
was sporting sunglasses and a worn-out, blue baseball
cap, hastened to clarify'. "Oh. She's not my wile. We're
just old friends." And with her gently ribbing him all i he
while, he elaborated. I lis wile had died long ago and liei
husband had passed on in the last year or two. I pon
hearing the bad news, he made a phone call that began
with him offering condolences and ended with a dec i
sion to meet lor lunch. In almost Cronkitean fashion,
the man reported, "We likeel it and decided to meet for
lunch again. It gets kind ol lonely by yourself in a home
built for two, and so we just started spending time." At
this point she punched him lightly in the i ibs and teased,
"Aw, you just wanted someone to cook for you . .
He continued without skipping a beat but a sup
pressed smile was beginning to curl at the fin corners of
liis mouth. " That's what it's all about, you see ... having
someone around that you like- to talk to and spend time
with." The woman piped up again ". .. and to clean up
after you!"
"You see," he continued after shooting us a look of
mock indignation, "at our age, there are no hoi inones
and all that sort of silly business to get in the way. It's
much better this way." Smiling, she nodded in agree
ment.
The four of us watched the sun go down together.
The pair then wished us a pleasant trip and walked off

our arms and legs into long pants and sleeves. Feeling

inosevrd down the path to the beach and parked our
selves on a weather beaten log. We watched a couple of
kids (King a kit e and ran sand through our toes while ex
