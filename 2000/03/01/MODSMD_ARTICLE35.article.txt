That evening we saw roughly 25 deer. Most were either
bounding through or standing in pastures, staring
back at us with as much interest as we did at them.
Unfortunately, only 23 were alive. Two lay dead at the
side of the road. ()ne had had its eyes eaten out and was well past
the point of stench. The other looked like it had been killed the
night before. Its left hind leg was broken off at the hip and still
wet blood pooled beneath it. The number of dead animals lit
tering the road is the most jarring aspect of touring. In a one
mile stretch, just south of Bodega Bay, six raccoons, two pos
sums and several pieces of fox littered the pavement. Their
slightly sour stench is a sickening reminder of the perils of living
on, or next to, the road. It's hard to make a distinction as to
whether you follow the stench or whether the stench follows you,
but its presence is an unfortunate constant. It is one of the few
aspects of touring that one is unable to derive at least some en
joyment from. There is pleasure, albeit sadistic, to be found even
in the crippling soreness, the soggy sleeping bag, and the 6 a.m.
start times but the roadside carnage is nothing but sad.
That night's exhaustion won its argument with reason. We
pitched tent by the side of the rode, just south of several threat
ening "No Trespassing" signs. The sound of gunshots echoing
through the canyons coaxed us to sleep.
