Early the next morning, we rode the steepest portion of the
Pacific Coast and were greeted shortly after 11 a.m. by the
smiling faces of my father and my brother. My family were
driving up the road to look for us.
Erik and I visited my folks for just under 24 hours, who were va
cationing in Sea Ranch. We savored a home-cooked meal and fell
asleep early. For one night, we were able to enjoy a shower, clean
clothes and a warm bed. After a 7:30 a.m. wake-up call, I slid myself
down off the top bunk, over the sleeping brother Burge and went
down to breakfast — two burritos, a bowl of spaghetti, four pieces of
toast with honey, two bananas, an apple, four glasses of milk and or
ange juice. Our appetites never ceased to amaze me.
Our time to leave was nearing, so we climbed back onto our bikes
and started riding. And man, did we ride. On glassy roads, we glid
ed over wind-swept, grass-covered hills, up, down, up, down. We hit
our top speed through this section at 47 mph.
We destroyed the bluffs at Jenner. On a particularly steep section,
a woman leaned out the side of her SUV and pumped her fist while
yelling "Great Ride!" We switchbacked up hills and dropped into
coves. We crossed cattle guards. Wc pedaled past Bodega and
Tomales Bays, stopping only for a lunch of all-you-can-eat 112 ries at a
Bodega Bay hamburger joint called the "Dog House." By the time
we rode past the turnoff to Point Reyes, it was nearing 7 p.m. We
stopped at a market — I raised a few eyebrows by photographing a
display of lunch meats — and polled a number of locals, while wolf
ing down dinner, on how far away San Francisco was. The estimates
ranged from 60 to 30 miles, but we decided to go with the shortest
one. It turned out to be very near the ac tual 31 mile distance.
At 8 p.m., we came to a consensus. Destination: Golden Gate
Bridge. From then on, we rode in darkness. Failing bike lights, roads
riddled with potholes, and a fog covering the new moon made teeth
grinding necessary and progress nerve-wracking. Four hours and
many stops later, to check and double check our route, the rhythmic

boom of a foghorn spurred us on through Marin's southernmost stretch.
I was riding on the brink of exhaustion when the last ascent began. And just to make it
interesting, a wind had kicked up, and rain was coming down. The higher we rose, the hard
er the wind and the rain hit. With ponchos pulled tight, we squinted our eyes and battled
up the final rise. At long last, we pulled our bikes up a rise off the side of the road, not more
than a stone's throw from the Golden Gate. Finally, 1 was allowed to be still, and as 1 lay on
my back and stared up through the branches of pine, the seeping warmth of exhaustion
blissfully spread throughout. We logged 110 miles that day.
I woke up to water droplets sprinkling on my face. The torrential rains and gail force
winds crashing down on us the night before were discovered to be nothing more than wind
driven fog. ()ne hour later, 1,221 miles after leaving Vancouver, we rode the fog swamped
Golden Gate across the bay and into San Francisco.


We spent an inordinate amount of time in public restrooms... but this one, in the town
of Little River, about 150 miles north of San Francisco, almost made it worth it. Erik
was convinced the janitor had come in and arranged the toilet paper so it was just so
