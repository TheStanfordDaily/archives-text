We watched a UGIA football game at the"The Scorecard," a typical sports bar.
The place was filled with smoke, cheap bear and patrons who made a point
to spend more than their fair share of time in sports bars tilled with smoke
and cheap beer. The bar tender, who couldn't have been more than 40, spe
cialized in flashing toothless grins at his customers, in a misplaced attempt tolx* welcoming.
Hie man was friendly enough, but it looked more like a jack-o-lantern's leer than a gesture
of good will. We rode 70 miles that day and bedded down in a school yard.
