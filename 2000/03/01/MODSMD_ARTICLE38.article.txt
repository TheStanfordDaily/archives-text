The last three days of our journey felt like ... well, let me put it this way: 1 would
rather have been back in elementary school doing standards eight hours a day.
1 had covered the terrain before; I was tiring of watching the road fly by seven
hours a day, and 1 was suffering from an inevitable let-down from being so near
ly finished.
Every long-distance tourer 1 have spoken to has gone through the same thing. Extreme
physical exhaust ion and mental tedium join forces and cause the cyc list to start questioning
iiis motives. You wonder why you are denying yourself a hot meal and a warm bed, or why
you are forcing yourselfout at the crack of dawn, and suffering the nagging injuries or en
during the discomforts. Now, I could answer readily and with relish, but I sure couldn't have
at the time.
The one thing 1 took any pleasure in was our mileage. It had really picked up. On Sept.
12 we rode 111 miles from the Lompoc school yard to the rock at Point Dume, just south of
Ventura. The 13th was spent pedaling 108 miles to a patch of dirt just inside the gates of the
Ixiguna Beach resort community of Pelican Hills, an exclusive beach front condominium
