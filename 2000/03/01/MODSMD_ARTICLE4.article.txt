# Webb Ranch workers get raise
## Labor conditions on Stanford-owned land were at issue 
### MELISSA LAMBERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Augustin Gonzalez will soon be
able to take his first paid vacation
in 30 years. Although he has
worked at Webb Ranch, a 237-acre
farm on Stanford land near Alpine
Road, for over a quarter of a cen
tury, he has been paid just above
minimum wage and has received
no paid vacation or health benefits.
But that all started to change yes
terday.
The workers' union and ranch
management, who have been ne
gotiating with each other since De
cember, agreed yesterday after
noon on a tentative new contract
which will allow for a substantial
wage increase and paid vacations.
Students and some University
stall members have been con
cerned about low wages, lack of
benefits and poor working condi
tions on the ranch since the late
1980s.
University officials say there is
nothing they can do about the situ
ation. "It's not that the University
isn't concerned about the issues at
Webb Ranch," said Debra

Zumwalt, acting general council
for Stanford, "but legally Stan lord
doesn't have any right to get in
volved."
The Webb family has leased the
land from Stanford since 1922,
growing berries and corn and
boarding horses, including those
belonging to the members of the
Stanford Polo Team.

John Mauley signed a letter last
week stating, "We will not sit still as
long as [the managers of Webb
Ranch] deny the rights of their
workers.'
The letter was sent to several
Bay Area newspapers.
Members ofSI AC also met with
Webb Ranch workers and their
union representatives during the
negotiation process. In the past,
most of the ranch workers were
paid $6.10 an hour. Junior Shaw
San I.in, one of the members of
SLAC who has been meeting with
the workers, said that no one was
paid over $7.33 an hour —and
that was only to (Gonzalez, who has
worked there for over 30 years.
Most of the workers have been
employed by Webb Ranch for over
25 years. Under the new contract,
these experienced workers will re

ceive a raise of 40 cents a year over
a period of three years for a total
raise of $1.20. Less experienced
workers will receive a total raise of
$1.
Ranch Manager loin Hubbard
said the ranch is worse oil finan
cially than in years past but the new
contract gives the workers "what
we economically were able to
carry."
Mel Pritchard, the workers'
union representative, said he
didn't know if the efforts of Stan
ford activists had made a differ
ence in the negotiations.
"We didn't get what we actually
wanted but we got something
everyone can live with," he said.
Pritchard added that the work
ers could live a lot better if they re
ceived health care as well.
Although he is the highest paid
w<)rker on the ratich, Gon/ale/ still
does not have enough money to
purchase health care in the U.S. It
is cheaper for him to return to
Mexico to visit a doctor. He is cur
rently in Tijuana, Mexico seeing a
dentist.
Fraga agreed that Stanford
does not have a legal responsibility
to improve the Webb Ranch con
ditions. But he said lie believes that
Stanford, "asan institution ofhigli
er education and a corporate citi
zen of the larger community, has a

legal responsibility to make sure
that all of its resources are used to
promote justice and fairness."
" I here is a long history of Stan
ford activists working with Webb
Ranch," said senior Kli Naduris-
Weissman, a SI .Ad member.
In the late 1980s and early
19905, allegations surfaced that 1111-
safe working and living conditions
existed at Webb Ranch.
According to Mauley, when ap
proached about the issue at a Fac
ulty Senate meeting in 1989, Don
ald Kennedy, the president of the
I Diversity at the time, said that
every minute he spent on Webb
Ranch was time away from impor
tant I niversity business.
" I he I diversity knows about

the situation but they are simply
stonewalling," Mauley said. "Their
rationale is that the workers are in
a union, so it's not the University's
pre )blem."
But Xumwalt contends that the
University has hundreds of tenants,
including Macy's, Neiman-Marcus,
Hewlett-Packard and IBM. She
said that she sees the relationship
with Webb Ranch as no different
than that with any other tenant.
"It's just as if the employees of
Macy's were complaining about
their benefits," said Zumwalt.
"Stanford doesn't have any power
to tell Macy's what kind of benefits
to give their employees."
According to Leonie Batkin,
Manager of Property Services for
Stanford, Webb Ranch's current
lease, negotiated in 1990, will come
up for renewal later this year.
Batkin said Stanford "won't set
any stipulations oil the ranch when
thev renew the lease."

ford activists working with Webb
Ranch," said senior Kli Naduris-
Weissman, a SI .Ad member.
In the late 1980s and early
19905, allegations surfaced that 1111-
safe working and living conditions
existed at Webb Ranch.
According to Mauley, when ap
proached about the issue at a Fac
ulty Senate meeting in 1989, Don
ald Kennedy, the president of the
I Diversity at the time, said that
every minute he spent on Webb
Ranch was time away from impor
tant I niversity business.
" I he I diversity knows about

the situation but they are simply
stonewalling," Mauley said. "Their
rationale is that the workers are in
a union, so it's not the University's
pre )blem."
But Xumwalt contends that the
University has hundreds of tenants,
including Macy's, Neiman-Marcus,
Hewlett-Packard and IBM. She
said that she sees the relationship
with Webb Ranch as no different
than that with any other tenant.
"It's just as if the employees of
Macy's were complaining about
their benefits," said Zumwalt.
"Stanford doesn't have any power
to tell Macy's what kind of benefits
to give their employees."
According to Leonie Batkin,
Manager of Property Services for
Stanford, Webb Ranch's current
lease, negotiated in 1990, will come
up for renewal later this year.
Batkin said Stanford "won't set
any stipulations oil the ranch when
thev renew the lease."
