After careful review and much discussion, Jane Camarillo, Director of Residential
Education, would like to announce that the Pi Beta Phi Sorority has been awarded a
chapter house for the academic year 2000-2001.
From the Greek Housing Criteria of 1996, the Greek Housing Review Board was
charged to evaluate proposals and make recommendations to the Director of Residential
Education about whether a chapter met these housing expectations and then identify
possible house assignments. In addition, there is a current limit on Greek housing to
10'12 houses. There were three chapters that submitted proposals this year, two sorori
ties and one fraternity. The Board felt that Pi Beta Phi had clearly met the expectations
set forth in the University's Greek Housing criteria. In that evaluation process, the
Housing Board reviewed the written proposals submitted by the Greek organizations, any
reports from the Greek Judicial Board, Office of Student Activities, Interfraternity and
Intersorority Council and finally conducted interviews with each chapter's leadership.
The Greek Housing Review Board also reviewed comments regarding Greek Housing
submitted by 1044 students on the Residential Education Residence Evaluation. The
specific question asked students to recommend what criteria the Review Board should
use to pick a house for a Greek organization. It also started with the expectation that
any house selected would need to be able to house the majority if not all of the member
ship. The house must also meet ADA requirements.
While not addressing the specific survey question, about 19% of the 1044 respondents
expressed disagreement with the policy that allows for housing Greek organizations.
Another percentage of students recommended non-Row housing (such as Wilbur) for
Greek chapters. A small percentage of students recommended criteria to select a Greek
organization. The majority did respond to the question requesting specific criteria for
selecting a house and these respondents consistently identified the following factors:
• Select houses that were not desirable in the previous Draw (e.g. drew with higher #'s).
• Select a house that takes the least number of two-room doubles and singles.
• Select a house that was previously Greek.
• Do not select a house in the inner Row (Mayfield north of Campus Drive).
- • Do not create a cluster of Greek houses (e.g. don't assign another house in Cowell).
• Select a house that fits the membership size.
• Don't assign a theme house or one that has a clear identity that adds value to the
housing program.
There was a minority of opinion that a smaller house should be selected that did cluster
Greek houses together or was more easily filled by a large chapter.
With all these factors in mind, the following houses are considered:
• Bob (capacity = 54, scheduled for ADA living in 2006, 14 two room doubles,
8 singles, but disadvantage in being in the inner Row and desirable in the Draw)
• Narnia (capacity = 54, currently ADA living, 25 two room doubles, 4 singles, not in
inner Row and formerly Greek, still desirable in the Draw)
• Whitman (capacity=ss, currently ADA living, 21 two room doubles, 2 singles, but in
a cluster of other Greek organizations, not as desirable as Bob but more than Narnia)
• 680 Lomita (capacity = 55, scheduled for ADA Living in 2002, 21 two room doubles,
1 single, formerly Greek organization, not as desirable as Bob but more than
Whitman, and Narnia).
These houses emerge as the current possible assignments for the new housed chapter but
new information is still being sought to finalize this list.
While Pi Beta Phi chapter has been offered a chapter house, the specific house has not
been assigned. In order to allow for students to know which specific houses are under
consideration and allow for an opportunity to provide input before the decision is made,
we will be making the final decision the second week of Spring Quarter (prior to the
opening of Axess for the Draw). The anticipated schedule for this process is that we will
identify the possible houses under consideration, communicate this to students before
the end of Winter Quarter, then, invite any and all input from those communities dur
ing the first week of Spring Quarter. The final decision will be made by Wednesday,
April 5, 2000.
On a final note, a critically important recommendation emerged from the Greek
Housing Review Board. During their deliberations, other factors, while not part of the
formal criteria, seemed to be influencing the question of whether to award a house.
Specifically, the Review Board considered the following:
• Impact of housing on the Greek system as a whole.
• Timing - concern with the speed of bringing on new chapters when the current
sororities have not gone through one full cycle.
• Vision or structure of the currently housed Greek organizations over time.
• General student feedback regarding Greek housing or Row housing for Greeks.
• Availability of current resources of support for new housed organizations.
• Future limits on the number of houses awarded housing at one time.
With these factors in mind, the Greek Housing Review Board recommended that the
status of Greek housing since the report of the 1996 Greek Task Force Report be
reviewed given the development and implementation of University's Greek Housing
Criteria. The Board recommends that this review be completed before any future
proposals are reviewed. This recommendation will be submitted by the Director of
Residential Education to the Dean of Students and the Vice Provost for Student Affairs.
We are excited about the Pi Beta Phi transition to a housed sorority and believe their
new status will strengthen the organization, Greek life, and Residential Education.
While Kappa Kappa Gamma and Sigma Phi Epsilon were not offered housing in this
process, we also believe that they remain remarkably strong unhoused organizations.
