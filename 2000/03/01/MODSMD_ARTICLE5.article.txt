## 
### TOMOKO SAKAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In response to allegations of a
'conflict of interests' in the internal
investigations being conducted at
the Stanford post office, Palo Alto
Postmaster Masa Sato adamantly
denied the existence of any such
impropriety.
Hie allegation of a conflict of in
terests' was made by law student 1 \
Clevenger in a Feb 28. letter to
Scott Tucker, the District Manager
of the San Francisco region for the
U.S. Postal Service.
Clevenger alleges that a fair in
ternal investigation cannot be tar
ried out within the Stanford post
office because Julie Reed, the wife
oHortner Acting Manager of Op
erations Robert Reed, work# for
the customer service department
of the Palo Alto district. The de
partment is being examined as part
of the internal investigation to de
termine if it was delivering student
complaints about mail service.
"You can't have someone inves
tigate on an issue that overimpli
cates their spouse," said (Revenger.
" I lie fact that Julie Reed works
for customer service and Robert
Reed is investigating on that does
not present a conflict of interest.
The two relationships have ab
solutely nothing to do with each
other," Sato said.
According to post oflice officials,
Julie Reed's official position at Palo
Alto post oflice is letter carrier and
not customer service manager, as
Clevenger alleges.
"Julie Reed is not in charge of
customer service. She is just a part
of it. She does not make am deci
sions," said Sato.
Clevenger''s accusations were
based on the experience of Ellen
I'lrich. a Stanford student's par
ent.
week when I was on the
Stanford campus visiting from up
state New York, I drove to the Palo
Alto Post Office and was told that 1
could talk to the Head Of Cus
tomer Service about my concerns,
at which point I was introduced to
Mrs. Reed," Ulrich said. "After a
lengthy conversation, 1 specifically
asked for her name and title. She
saw me write it down."
Julie Reed declined to com
ment.
The customer service depart
ment will be included in the inter
nal investigation because Sato de
nied knowledge of major com
plaints about the post office. Cle
venger says that Sato denied
knowledge of complaints at a stu
dent meeting held on Tuesday,
February 15 at Stanford.
However, Sato claimed he is
aware of all complaints. "I never
denied knowledge of student com
plaints. I've always known cus
tomer responses and complaints,"
he said.
Clevenger claims Sato is chang
ing his position. "If Sato is saying he
knew student complaints, either he
is changing stances now, or he was
misleading us at the student meet
ing," he said.
Sato said the post office is in the
process of investigating allegations
of sexual harassment and is at
tempting to identify the accuser.
The student alleging sexual harass
ment presented her claim publicly
attheASSU forum on Feb. 15.
Robert Reed was unavailable for
comment. He resumed his regular
position as Menlo Park Postmaster
on Monday, Feb. 28. He had been
acting manager of operations for
the San Francisco Region of the
U.S. Postal Service while the regu
lar manager was out of town.
