presents:
Materializing Identities
The CASA colloquium series in Winter 2000 will explore various processes of identity
formation in terms of individuals, gender, and community. In particular the central lole of
material culture in making identities will be examined. In this way, even if not concerned
with the distant past, all the contributions are 'archaeological', in that they deal with the
materialisation and objectification of social processes.
