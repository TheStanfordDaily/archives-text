This Weekend!
Don V miss the men in tutus!
Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo
Saturday, March 4, 8:00 p.m.
Sunday, March 5, 2:30 p.m.
Memorial Auditorium
Come frolic with the Trocks! Ignore the hairy chests beneath
the tutus —these darlings can dance. For more than 25 years,
the men of Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo have
delighted audiences with giddy parodies of the masterworks.
Pirouetteing en pointe, these no-holds-barred balletomanes
bestow the unabashed fun so many of us have wished for
upon classical dance, while maintaining brilliant classical
technique. Cult-like followings and critical roars keep them
dancing and audiences cheering.

Friday Night!
Meredith Monk/The House
Magic Frequencies
Friday, March 3, 8:00 p.m.
Memorial Auditorium
Post-performance discussion with Meredith
Monk and company follows
"There is no one like Monk and no other
work like "Magic Frequencies. "
—the Los Angeles Times
In the Northern California premiere of
Meredith Monk's new theatrical and playful
"science fiction chamber opera," offbeat
vignettes of everyday life fuse cutting-edge
music with movement, pantomime, and other
worldly objects in a kaleidoscopic collabora
tion that exposes the cracks between the tem
poral and the spiritual, revealing the magic
frequencies on which we communicate. "In
originality, in scope, in depth, there are few to
rival her," says the Washington Post.
Stanford students:s 10/$ 1 3/$ 16
