# Groups register students to vote

With California's March 7 primary rapidly ap
proaching, many out of state students have regis
tered to vote at the polls here. Others, however, may
have already voted, casting absentee ballots in their
home states.
While there are both pros and cons for out-of
state students to register in California, several stu
dent organizations, including Stanford Democrats
and Stanford in Government, have led campaigns
to register students here.
The Democrats registered 750 students before
the Feb. 7 deadline to register for the upcoming pri
mary. The deadline to register for the November
presidential election is in October.
"[ln California], you have the most influential
vote you can have in a presidential primary," said ju
nior Bi-yan Hughes, director of communications for
Stanford Democrats. "And there are very few other
stales with propositions of such significance."
In addition, Hughes noted that many proposi
lions, such as those concerning medical marijuana,
ihe discontinuation of affirmative action and cam
paign finance reform, first appeared on the ballot in
(California and quickly spread to the rest of the na
tion. "People really look to what California does," he
said. "We tend to lead the way in a lot of issues."
Political Science Prof. Morris Fiorina disagreed.
"[Students] who are from out of state will vote a few
limes and then leave. Given one vote and how little
one vote matters, I don't think that it makes much of
a difference," he said.
Although the specifics vary from state to state,
most require that voters request an absentee ballot at
least a week prior to the election and that it be either
|>ostmarkcd or received prior to the closing of the
polls on election day.
According to Hughes, this time frame has the po
lenlial to create problems. "If you delay a few days in

requesting your ballot, then delay a few more in fill
ing it out and delay more in sending it, they might
not receive it on time," he said.
Hughes, who votes absentee so that he can vote
on local races in his home district, said that he hasn't
had a chance to look over all of the issues yet and
may be forced to express mail his ballot to ensure
that it is received on time.
The most significant factor in many students' de
cision to vote absentee appeared to be a greater feel
ing of connection with issues at home.
"A lot of people who were politically active in high
school have political ties to the races at home," said
Hughes. "They want to have a say in these races."
Freshman Brian Quistorff said, "I know more
things about the home issues. I'm not really affected
by much out here because it seems too isolated."
Sophomore Paige Kotuby expressed similar
views. "I don't feel like I have a stake in the referen
dums out here. I just haven't taken the time to find
out about them."
Several students also listed concerns about being
required to pay California state income taxes should
they decide to register here, though anyone who
earns income in California has to file a state income
tax return regardless of their voter registration.
However, according to Hughes, this is not the
case. "California has one of the more open policies
on voter registration," he said. "You don't have to be
a permanent resident, and you don't have to change
your car registration or driver's license."
Political Science Prof. Luis Fraga, on the other
hand, mentioned that several students have com
municated concerns to him about scholarships in
their home states which specifically asked if the stu
dent was registered to vote in their home state as a
criterion for funding.
But, I raga said, "In general, it's advisable for
people to be registered where they are living. So I
encourage students to think about registering here
very seriously."
