## Congress votes to end work penalty 
### 
WASH INC TON (AP) — In
uncommon election-year biparti
sanship, House Republicans and
Democrats united yesterday
behind legislation allowing
800,000 senior citizens between
ages 05 and 09 to work without
fear ol losing Social Security ben
efits. President Clinton pledged
his support.
I he House voted 122-0 to
send the Senate ;i bill repealing
the Social Securitx earnings limit,
which amounts to a penalty of $1
in benefits lor ever) ;i recipient
earns < >\ er 517,000 I his vear.
Sponsors s.iid the time has
arrived to scrap the Depression
era law, oiiginalh enacted to
make more jobs available foi
younger woi kers.
Retailers, restaurants and
othei businesses are battling a
labor shortage and Congress is
searching for modest accomplish
ments to oiler senior voters
panic ularh because agreement is
less likel\ on broader Medicare
and Social Security relorins.
"Win in the world would we
want to discourage am American,
whether they're 17 or 57, from
working? said Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Texas, chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee.
"Americans are living longer now .
and older Americans can work,
they want to work, and they
shouldn't be punished In an out
dated law."
Senate supporters promised
prompt action. Clinton, in a letter
to congressional leaders, said he
would sign the bill into law as long
as it remains unencumbered by
tax cuts or other changes he could
not accept and that have doomed
several past repeal ellbrts.
, "We should reward jfveiy
American who wants to and can
sta\ active and productive." said
Clinton, who first called for the
repeal in his 1992 campaign hook
"Putting People first" and includ
ed it in his p;isi two budgets.
I he legislation would take an
estimated 522.7 billion out of the
Social Secuiiix trust fund over 10
years.
In the long run, it would not
furthei jeopardize the program's
solvency, the Social Security
Administration says, in part

because more people working
means more in payroll tax contri
butions to the program.
Repealing the law would
increase the available national
labor pool by an estimated 5 per
cent — beyond the 800,000
directly affected, many more peo
ple are discouraged from working
at all — and save up to $150 mil
lion in administrative costs, con
gressional sponsors said.
"We can't afford to keep this
resource, these people who have
built this country — we can't
afford to keep them out," said
Speaker of the House Dennis
I lastert, R-111.
for Republicans, the bill's easy
passage marks the second success
of their election-year strategy of
enacting a series of popular
items individually, rather than
lumping them into a huge pack
age like last year's vetoed $792
billion tax cut.
Last month, the GOP pushed
through a more controversial
10-year, $182 billion measure
that would ease the income tax
"marriage penalty" paid In mil
lions of two-income couples.
"We have a piece of Social
Security reform," said Rep. E.
Clay Shaw, R-Fla. "This is a vei \
important piece for our seniors.
We're not wasting time."
Because the bill was not tied
to unpalatable COP tax cuts,
Democrats found it irresistible
and took pains lo point out that
tliev had supported the concept
for years.
"This is the first time we've
had a clean vote on this issue."
s.iid Rep. Cene Creen, I)- Texas.
But many Democrats also
faulted the COP lor failing to
; address longer-term senior citi
zen issues such as a Medicare
prescription drug benefit and
using debt interest savings to
keep Social Securit) solvent
through 2050.
Democrats said the main ben
eficiaries would be older Ameri
cans who do not have to rely
completed on Social Security
.ind Medicare, accomplishing Ut
ile for the neediest senior citi
zens of all — panic ularl\ elderly,
widowed women who never
worked much outside the home.
