BEIJING (AP) â€” Chinese authorities have
detained the parents of a 14-year-old Bud
dhist leader who fled Tibet to India, replaced
monks at his monastery and closed it to visi
tors, a monitoring group said yesterday.
The report came as U.N. human rights
chief Mary Robinson appealed at a conference
in Beijing for better human rights protections
in Asia. Ii also followed the U.S. State Depart
ment's accusation in a report last week that
China's rights record deteriorated markedly
last year.
I he Londoiirbased Tibet Information Net

work said authorities investigating the IJigiit
of the Karniapa Lama took liis parents,
Dhotidup and Loga, from their home in
Lhasa and put them under close surveillance
in Chamdo, a prefecture in eastern libel
where they previously lived as nomadic yak
herders.
Citing sources ii did not identih. the group
said authorities also closed the Kannapa's
monastery, 1 surphu, to visitors, detained two
security workers, replaced monks who man
aged the monaster) and questioned others,
warning them that thev needed to improve

tjiejr "political attitudes."
A Chinese government spokesman in
Lhasa, Tibet, denied the report, calling it
.nothing but "rumors." The spokesman, who
gave his name as Zhangxi, denied that the
karmapa's parents or people at his monastery
had been detained and said Tsurphu
remained open.
I he llight of the 17th Karmapa Lama was
an embarrassment lor Beijing, underscoring
its inability to cultivate leading Buddhist fig
ures to help legitimize (China's often brutal 50-
year rule over Tibet.
