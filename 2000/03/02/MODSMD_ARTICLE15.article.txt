## 
### 
JKR USA I. KM (AP) — Israel's
parliament gave preliminary
approval yesterday to a bill that
could doom ;in Israel-Svria peace
aeeord or even bringdown Prime
Minister Kliud Barak's coalition
government.
I lie measure, which raises the
percentage ol votes needed to win
approval of am peace deal in a
national referendum to a nearly
unattainable amount, could limit
Barak's bargaining abilitv or lead
Svria to conclude there's no point
in negotiating further.
In a (>O-53 vote, lawmakers
gave preliminary approval to the
Likud opposition bill, which
would require an absolute major
itv of eligible voters in a referen
dum to approve a peace deal with
S\lia.
Kven with Israel's traditionally
high turnout rate ol nearly HO
percent, about (>5 percent of those
actualh voting would have to
approve the treat\ — a highh
unlikely result.
Parliament's move came as
Deputy Defense Minister
Kphraim Sneli, returning from
talks in Washington, said he had a
"gut Iceling that (Israel-Syria)
negotiations will resume in a
month.'

Israel and Syria held two
rounds of peace talks in the Unit
ed States in December and Jan
uary after a nearly four-year
break.
S\ ria called off the third round
in january, and the talks have not

restarted.
I he parliament vote showed
that at least for now, a majority
would rather keep the strategic
Golan Heights, captured in the
l<)(>7 Middle Kast war, than trade
most or all of it for peace with

Syria, as Barak proposes.
Cabinet ministers pledged to
bury the bill in committee. but the
message was clear — Barak's
coalition, designed to ensure
approval of peace deals, failed its
litst real test.
