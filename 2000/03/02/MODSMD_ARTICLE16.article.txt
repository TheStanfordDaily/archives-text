the two apparent I) had scu I lied
on the pla\ground at Buell Kle
nietitan School.
Ihe bo\ is too young to
understand what he was doing,
and probabl) won't be c harged,
the prosecutor said.
Altei the shooting, the bov
put the gun in his desk and went
to the school office, Superinten

there draw ing pictures."

"He is a victim in many
wavs," (ienesee County Prosecu

sad. We need to put our arms
around him and love him."
Busc h said the house where
the boy and bis 8-year-old broth
er were staying with an uncle
was frequented by strangers,
and the boy's father — who is in
jail — told the sherill that people
.it the house traded crack
cocaine for guns.
I he ramshackle house is sur
rounded by mud-caked trash,
and the front yard is cluttered
with an empty vodka bottle and
a rusting black Camaro. The
home has tattered and stained
curtains, and 11 uttering plastic
garbage bags taped over broken
windows. No one answered the
door yesterday.
I he boy and his brother had
been staving for about two weeks
with the uncle — their mother's
brother — after the mother had
been evicted from her home,
