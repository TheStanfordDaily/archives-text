## The 						Stanford Daily New ASSU Campaign Practices Code raises questions 
### 
Published Since 1891

As the time for our annual ASSU
elections draws near again, the
Undergraduate Senate has
made some recent modifications
to the Campaign Practices Code, a docu
ment that defines how candidates may go
about campaigning on campus.
This year's changes were intended to
allow all students, regardless of their
financial situation, the opportunity to run
for office.
Campaign spending was capped, and
some other minor changes were made. In
addition, fines for violating the CPC were
removed. Instead, candidates will be
assigned "demerits," based on how serious

their offense is deemed to be.
The number of demerits a candidate
receives will then be listed under their
name on the online ballot.
While the senate undoubtedly had the
best of intentions when implementing
these changes, assigned demerits instead
effectively blackballs candidates from the
election.
With so many students on campus and
so many candidates running for senate,
class president and groups for special fee
each year, the student body at large tends
to be relatively uninformed in these elec
tions. And who can blame them when the
only campaigning one generally sees from

candidates are catchy slogans and bright
fliers? So, if a student is forced to select 15
candidates from a list of 40 people he
doesn't know, what happens if 10 candi
dates have demerits under their name?
It would not be surprising if there was
very high correlation between the num
ber of demerits a candidate has and how
far down the list he or she is when the
final vote counts are tallied.
But granted, perhaps a candidate
deserves to lose if he or she earns a lot of
demerits.
Perhaps this system will prevent the
election of people who feel they are
allowed to bend the rules. But if this was

what the demerit system was truly con
structed to do, the CPC should have been
written much more clearly. For example,
according to the CPC, "on election day, no
campaigning is permitted within 15
meters of the polling sites." But since
polling is all online, what exactly does that
mean?
There is obviously a need for some sort
of regulations regarding campaign week,
but the demerit system falls sort of the
task.
When the punishment for one flier out
of place essentially translates into not
being elected, something needs to be
changed.
