# MODERN LIFE IS RUBBISH
## Believing the hype 
### 
As if the AOL-Time Warner merg
er weren't enough, anti-corporate
types now have a new reason to
carp. Artisan Entertainment, the

movie distributor that
scored a major financial
coup last year by snag
ging "The Blair Witch
Project" for general
release, recently
announced that they are
seeking product place
ment deals for the forth
coming "Blair Witch"

sequel and prequel.
Among other companies, they are current
ly courting, of all things, Altoids — the
'curiously strong' mints.
Under the provisions of the deal, Altoids
would not only have its logo placed on the
inevitable glut of "Blair Witch" merchan
dise, but would have its mints appear in the
actual film.
It's troubling enough to imagine charac
ters sucking on Altoids as they flee from
invisible forest ghouls, but there is the even
more disturbing possibility of tie-in televi
sion commercials. Imagine a harshly lit,
teary-eyed Heather Donahue whispering
into the shaking camera that she's sorry...
so sorry; she's made a horrible mistake,
and her non-Altoid breath mints just aren't
strong enough, ('.all it "Blair Witch" Hali
tosis.

To give Altoids its clue, the company
doesn't seem too sure about horror films as
a marketing vehicle. No decision has been
leached as yet, but a company spokeswom
an has voiced concerns that "it wouldn't be
the right fit." In this era of classless promo
tion, Altoids' concerns constitute a surpris
ing instance of good taste. Maybe it's
because they're British.
But mints or no mints, the advertising
juggernaut will goon. Artisan's promotion
al packet, unapologetically titled "The Blair
Witch Franchise," outlines its plans to
release tie-in comic books, trading cards,
jewelry, stationery, leather apparel, four
different video games and action figures
designed by "Spawn" creator Todd McFar
lane. This last item is especially confound
ing, since the whole point of the Blair
Witch is that nobody knows what it looks
like. A poetic though improbable solution
would be to depict the witch exactly as Arti
san sees it: a fat, dewy-eyed cash cow.
In any case, a piddling detail like an
invisible monster won't prove a major
obstacle for marketing executives. Promot
ing a movie as unconventional as "Blair
Witch" might seem a quixotic enterprise,
but Artisan hits demonstrated a 112 rightening
competence at fitting it into the mold.
For instance, how do you release a
soundtrack to a movie with no music? Easy:
