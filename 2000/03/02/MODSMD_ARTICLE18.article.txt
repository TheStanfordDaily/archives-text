# MODERN LIFE IS RUBBISH
## Believing the hype 
### 
As if the AOL-Time Warner merg
er weren't enough, anti-corporate
types now have a new reason to
carp. Artisan Entertainment, the

movie distributor that
scored a major financial
coup last year by snag
ging "The Blair Witch
Project" for general
release, recently
announced that they are
seeking product place
ment deals for the forth
coming "Blair Witch"

sequel and prequel.
Among other companies, they are current
ly courting, of all things, Altoids — the
'curiously strong' mints.
Under the provisions of the deal, Altoids
would not only have its logo placed on the
inevitable glut of "Blair Witch" merchan
dise, but would have its mints appear in the
actual film.
It's troubling enough to imagine charac
ters sucking on Altoids as they flee from
invisible forest ghouls, but there is the even
more disturbing possibility of tie-in televi
sion commercials. Imagine a harshly lit,
teary-eyed Heather Donahue whispering
into the shaking camera that she's sorry...
so sorry; she's made a horrible mistake,
and her non-Altoid breath mints just aren't
strong enough, ('.all it "Blair Witch" Hali
tosis.

To give Altoids its clue, the company
doesn't seem too sure about horror films as
a marketing vehicle. No decision has been
leached as yet, but a company spokeswom
an has voiced concerns that "it wouldn't be
the right fit." In this era of classless promo
tion, Altoids' concerns constitute a surpris
ing instance of good taste. Maybe it's
because they're British.
But mints or no mints, the advertising
juggernaut will goon. Artisan's promotion
al packet, unapologetically titled "The Blair
Witch Franchise," outlines its plans to
release tie-in comic books, trading cards,
jewelry, stationery, leather apparel, four
different video games and action figures
designed by "Spawn" creator Todd McFar
lane. This last item is especially confound
ing, since the whole point of the Blair
Witch is that nobody knows what it looks
like. A poetic though improbable solution
would be to depict the witch exactly as Arti
san sees it: a fat, dewy-eyed cash cow.
In any case, a piddling detail like an
invisible monster won't prove a major
obstacle for marketing executives. Promot
ing a movie as unconventional as "Blair
Witch" might seem a quixotic enterprise,
but Artisan hits demonstrated a 112 rightening
competence at fitting it into the mold.
For instance, how do you release a
soundtrack to a movie with no music? Easy:


Paul K*rs<h«n
put out a CD titled "Josh's Blair Witch Mix"
and pack it with appropriately menacing
tunes from goth staples like Bauhaus, Skin
ny Puppy and Type O Negative — pre
sumably what Josh would have listened to
if he hadn't been too busy dying in the
woods.

The promotional blitz is, however, only
to be expected. The truly questionable
thing is Artisan's decision to make sequels
to a movie whose defining virtue was its
minimalism. The idea of a prequel sounds
even more alarm bells; one can't help
thinking of George Lucas's hubris in drag
ging out the "Star Wars" series with an
Episode One that was so heavily hyped it
couldn't fail to disappoint.
Not that laco Bell's "Defeat the Dark
Side and Win" tie-in helped matters.

But then, that's the blueprint for the
modern entertainment industry. A deal is
struck, and suddenly we're sitting through
inexplicable television commercials where
theTaco Bell chihuahua drives a tank over
Planet Naboo in search of the forbidden
chalupa.
We might feel our intelligence to be
insulted, but someone is still making a lot of
money off taco sales. This isn't far from the
future depicted in David Foster Wallace's
"Infinite Jest," where the United States cal

endar is subsidized by corporations so that
most of the novel's action occurs in the
Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment.
It's unclear whether there's a lesson
here, aside from the obvious caution that
buying tacos won't actually defeat any evil
jedi. It's easy to complain about the media
pandering to the lowest common denomi
nator. but the situation isn't likely to c hange
in the near future.
So the "Blair Witch" action figures will
come out, kids will buy them, parents will

protest the violence and the literati will
gripe about the bastardization of what start
ed out as a quirky, innovative film. And
everyone will go to sleep feeling a little bet
ter about themselves. li - , " 1 '
It may actually be a blessing in disguise.
After all, if the media weren't so consistent
ly crass, whatever would we have to com
plain about?
