A former researcher at Stanford's (lenter fir
International Security and Cooperation, who
was sentenced to 15 years in a Chinese jail last
year for "leaking state secrets," is seeking med
ical parole because he has cancer, his sister an
nounced yesterday in a press release.
Hua l)i, 63, is suffering from a rare form of
male breast cancer. Both Una's family, re
searchers at the center and the United Nations
are working as quickly as possible to get Hua
released.
"I'm convinced that Hua I)i does need at
tention of a specialized nature that lie probably
couldn't get in China," said John Kamin, di
rector of the Project in Human Rights Diplo
macy at Stanford.

Una's sister has hired a lawyer to seek his
medical parole, and she has also appealed to
U.N. Human Rights High Commissioner
Mary Robinson. Robinson is in Beijing on a
three-clay visit to try to release Hua.
President Clinton, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Political Science Prof.
Emeritus John Lewis have all made repeated
trips to Beijing in an attempt to release 1 fuaon
humanitarian grounds.
Hua is also receiving assistance from Song
Yongyi, a researcher at Dickinson College in
Pennsylvania, who was detained by the Chi
nese government in Beijing for six months.
Song was suddenly released from detention
last month.
Song came to Stanford on Saturday to de
liver a seminar about the Cultural Revolution
and to talk about 1 lua's case. 1 le spent most of

Monday and Tuesday talking with Kamin and
Lewis.
"Mr. Song's visit continued three things,"
said Lewis, an expert in Chinese politics and a
former director of the International Security
Center. "He totally and completely disproved
all the rumors that had been going around."
Song continued first that 1 lua was in a de
tention center, which contradicted a report
published in Beijing last year that said Hua
might have been ii double agent.
"Song was in cell KAI2 and 1 lua was in cell
KAIO in south Beijing," Lewis said. A Teb. 25
article in the San Francisco ( hronicle said that.
Song, who never saw Hua, heard his voice
coining from the other cell and from the de
tention center's exercise yard.
