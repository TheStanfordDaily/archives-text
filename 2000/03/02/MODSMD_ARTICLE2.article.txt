### MEGAN KNIZE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A former researcher at Stanford's (lenter fir
International Security and Cooperation, who
was sentenced to 15 years in a Chinese jail last
year for "leaking state secrets," is seeking med
ical parole because he has cancer, his sister an
nounced yesterday in a press release.
Hua l)i, 63, is suffering from a rare form of
male breast cancer. Both Una's family, re
searchers at the center and the United Nations
are working as quickly as possible to get Hua
released.
"I'm convinced that Hua I)i does need at
tention of a specialized nature that lie probably
couldn't get in China," said John Kamin, di
rector of the Project in Human Rights Diplo
macy at Stanford.

Una's sister has hired a lawyer to seek his
medical parole, and she has also appealed to
U.N. Human Rights High Commissioner
Mary Robinson. Robinson is in Beijing on a
three-clay visit to try to release Hua.
President Clinton, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Political Science Prof.
Emeritus John Lewis have all made repeated
trips to Beijing in an attempt to release 1 fuaon
humanitarian grounds.
Hua is also receiving assistance from Song
Yongyi, a researcher at Dickinson College in
Pennsylvania, who was detained by the Chi
nese government in Beijing for six months.
Song was suddenly released from detention
last month.
Song came to Stanford on Saturday to de
liver a seminar about the Cultural Revolution
and to talk about 1 lua's case. 1 le spent most of

Monday and Tuesday talking with Kamin and
Lewis.
"Mr. Song's visit continued three things,"
said Lewis, an expert in Chinese politics and a
former director of the International Security
Center. "He totally and completely disproved
all the rumors that had been going around."
Song continued first that 1 lua was in a de
tention center, which contradicted a report
published in Beijing last year that said Hua
might have been ii double agent.
"Song was in cell KAI2 and 1 lua was in cell
KAIO in south Beijing," Lewis said. A Teb. 25
article in the San Francisco ( hronicle said that.
Song, who never saw Hua, heard his voice
coining from the other cell and from the de
tention center's exercise yard.
"He also confirmed that Una's
health was getting worse, and on
two occasions he heard that Hua
had to Ix- carried away in an ambu
lance," l.ewis said.
Finally, on Tuesday, Song said
that he was convinced that 1 lua was
innocent of the charges of leaking
state secrets to the U.S. Lewis
agreed.
"From the beginning, he plead
ed innocent and he was innocent,"
Lewis saitl. "He used open docu
ments that you can find in the Stan
ford Library."
Lewis said lie's thankful for
Song's confirmations because
they've finally "put to rest all the ru
mors that kept people standing
back."
Hua, an expert on China's mis

sile program and a member of
China's ruling elite, wrote a famous
article supporting the democracy
protesters in Tiananmen Square in
1989. He then sought political exile
in the United States.
Kamm said Hua has appealed
the guilty verdict in the Chinese
Court of First Instance and is wait
ing to hear the deciscion of his first
parole effort.
" The appeals are almost always
rejected, but there is the possibility
of a reduced sentence or a different
charge," Kamm said. 1 he appeal
decision should come sometime
this month.
"In my own experience, the Chi
nese won't reverse the verdict, but 1
think they might be impressed by
his medical condition," Lewis said.
"They may give him medical pa
role which does not free them to
the verdict."
Even so, Kamm points out pa
role may be difficult because it

works to get prisoners removed
from prison, but since Hua is being
held at a detention center, "parole
may be a little tricky."
If the appeal fails, which is most
likely, Kamm and Hua's family
members are ready to present the
appeal for medical parole.
"We want the University to be
come supportive of the case to give
parole," Lewis said. "We are also
talking to different groups of physi
cians who support human rights
who can help us." Kamm con
firmed this statement.
"We want to get the opinions of
the best physicians on this rare
disease," he said.
But for right now, all Hua's sup
porters can do - just like Hua - is
wait.
'The Chinese authorities move
very slowly - we're hopeful that it
will move quickly," Lewis said. "But
we don't want to do anything to
damage Hua Di."
