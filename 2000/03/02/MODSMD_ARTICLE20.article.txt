Responding to Pi Phi housing decision
I recently finished reading Director of
Residential Education Jane Camarillo's
release about the Greek housing issues.
After reading it, I can only hope that it
was writ ten as some kind of a twisted joke.
Responses from the recent student res
idential survey indicate that the majority
of the students do not want prime hous
ing— housing on the Row, housing with
two-room doubles and housing that
draws well — to be given over to the
Greek system. The committee has chosen
four of the most appealing houses, by
those and other criteria, to be considered
for the Pi Phi's new house. It seems that
the prospective houses were selected by
size, with utter disregard to student
input.
I was one of the people who opposed
Greek housing on the residential housing
survey. I am not opposed to Greek hous
ing in general, but I feel strongly that the
rest of the undergraduate population
should not be adversely affected when
fraternities or sororities get housing.

It makes no sense to me that a group
of people should be guaranteed good
housing, simply because they selected
themselves for a Greek organization,
while non-Greek people must draw
unpreferred and risk living in the unde
sirable Wilbur or Stern during their
unpreferred year.
Having such different standards for
Greek and non-Greek students is simply
not fair.
II the fraternities and sororities have
such a need to live together, then let them
live in dorms, or even mediocre houses,
but don't select their future residences
from a list of the most appealing houses
on campus, with apparent disregard to
opinions from the student surveys.

As many Stanford students have
recently found out, the Pi Beta Phi soror
ity will receive campus housing in the
2000-2001 school year. In Residential
Education surveys, students listed criteria

for specific Greek housing as houses that
are not on the inner Row, do not draw
very high and do not contain a great deal
of two-room doubles or singles.
However, the administration decided
that they would offer four houses that
contradict the criteria directly, slapping
Stanford students in their collective face.
What many students do not know is
that the Stanford Band has been forced to
re-apply for housing every year over the
past tew years. This year, we were sad
dened to bid farewell to our home for
over a year, a triple-wide trailer at 69 1/2
Galvez. Being an organization by the peo
ple and for the people, the Band would
like to respond to students' concerns and
offer 69 1/2 Galvez for the Pi Phis.
Not only does this facility fit each of the
criteria set forth by the students, we feel
that it has much to offer the Pi Beta Phi
sorority.
Located in a scenic gravel lot near the
Ford Center and across the street from
the newly constructed Alumni Shrine, 69
1/2 Galvez offers enough parking for any
combination of 55 BMW 'i-series convert

ibles and Z3s. Bathrooms are convenient
ly located at the Ford Center during busi
ness hours, and at the History Corner 24
hours a day.
What's more, this fully air-condi
tioned(!) facility is raised four feet off the
ground, allowing its inhabitants to easily
look down on passers-by. True, this is not
ADA compliant, but the Band dealt with
the problem by simply lifting our
wheelchair-propelled members by hand.
If the Pi Phis cannot do this, they can at
least take solace that 69 1/2 Galvez will be
renovated under the CIP program in
2027. Believe me, it is well worth it to be
raised so far above others.
The size of 69 1/2 Galvez might seem
worrisome to prospective residents, but I
can assure you all that it is of adequate
size. Clearly, if 200 slightly overweight
individuals and their instruments can
reside there for an extended period of
time, so can 55 slender women. With the
addition of a little furniture, we actually
found 69 1/2 Galvez quite cozy, even with
a population density rivaled only at San
Quentin State Prison and some parts of

New Delhi.
From one service organization to
another, the LSJUMB is happy to offer
69 1/2 Galvez to the Pi Beta Phi sorority.

I would like to applaud Director of
Residential Education Jane Camarillo's
recent decision to grant what will likely lie
a prime residence to yet another one of
Stanford's noteworthy community service
organizations.
1 believe that this decision by the Office
of Residential Education sends a strong
message to all students on campus, which
is that community service is the way to go.
Community service is an admirable goal
for people of our age, who are too often
overly involved with trivial issues such as
physical appearance, clothing, status or
inter-organizational cattiness.
Fortunately, community service orga
nizations are above this. They invest all of
their time and energy to service, never
once giving in to their own individual
needs or concerns. These community ser
vice organizations deserve the best and
most desired housing on campus, because
they embrace the entire campus commu
nity, constantly enriching student life by
holding social events which are open to

each and every one of us, regardless of
whether or not we have chosen to join a
similar community service organization.
Furthermore, these community ser
vice organizations openly welcome new
members. The comprehensive selection
process is one in which trivial details such
as hairstyle and shoes are ignored; only
the most genuine individuals, those who
are completely dedicated to the ideals of
community service, are considered for
membership.
So go ahead, Jane Camarillo, give
away Bob, or Narnia, or Whitman or 680
Lomita, four of the most desired houses
on campus, despite the fact that student
input suggested that houses such as these
be kept for the general student popula
tion.
Let the shining community service
organizations live there. As for the rest of
us, who are too self-absorbed in our indi
vidual, unimportant activities such as ath
letics, music, art, research, volunteering
or working to pay our way through
school because mom and dad can't afford
it? We don't deserve the privilege.

Flo Mo crosswalk not the real problem?
This letter is in response to the numer
ous articles and letters about the "May
field Avenue Bike Accident Problem."
First of all, there is no problem. Flo
rence Moore Hall residents are the prob
lem. I used to live in 080 Lomita and had
to cross Mayfield on a daily basis. Sorry to
disappoint your cause, but I was never hit
by a car. Only idiots get hit by cars.
Instead of trying to stop motorists
from driving over Flo Mo residents, why
don't you (the Flo Mo staff) inform your
residents that cars are heavy and made of
metal, and unless they enjoy the feeling of
being pressed into asphalt by a car tire,
they should make safety a personal
responsibility and look for cars before
crossing the street.
Don't expect cars to stop. You stop.
Ruining our campus by planting more
stop signs or building an unnecessary
light signal is not the solution. Looking
both ways and riding defensively is the
solution. Use your brain and maybe you'll
live to ride another day.

Graduate Student housing plan
Tuesday's Daily carried a headline
for a front page story about a reduction
iu graduate housing subsidies which
was not representative of the facts.
While the number of graduate students
who will be subsidized in off-campus
apartments will be reduced, the Uni
versity will increase the total number of
students receiving direct housing sup
port.
The University has approved an
increase in the subsidy program to sup
port the financing of 508 new on-cam
pus studio apartments. In addition,
subsidies will continue for 300 to 400
students in off campus apartments.
That represents financial support for a
total of up to 900 students, a 509J
increase over the number subsidized in
1999-2000.
In mid-January, Housing Assign
ment Services sent a letter and a survey
to graduate students in subsidized off
campus apartments asking them to pro
vide information about their own plans
and alerting them to the possibility of
changes in the subsidy program for the
coming year. This letter was sent out

prior to the decision by the senior
administration to increase the funding
of the subsidized housing program.
As a result of that increase, not as
many of the possible modifications to
the off-campus program may have to
occur.
We will, however, need to make
every effort to be efficient in the use of
the off-campus subsidy funds so we can
help the largest possible number of stu
dents. Higher priced subsidized apart
ments and those which are farthest
from campus will likely be eliminated
from the program during the course of
next year.
Currently, staff members and gradu
ate students are working together to
find ways to maximize the use of the
available subsidy funds and to do so in
ways that have the least negative impact
on the stability of graduate student
lives. All are working cooperatively to
learn more about graduate students'
housing needs and to develop
approaches to the housing problem
aimed at meeting them.

If the Pi Phis cannot do this, they can at
least take solace that 69 1/2 Galvez will be
renovated under the CIP program in
2027. Believe me, it is well worth it to be
raised so far above others.
The size of 69 1/2 Galvez might seem
worrisome to prospective residents, but I
can assure you all that it is of adequate
size. Clearly, if 200 slightly overweight
individuals and their instruments can
reside there for an extended period of
time, so can 55 slender women. With the
addition of a little furniture, we actually
found 69 1/2 Galvez quite cozy, even with
a population density rivaled only at San
Quentin State Prison and some parts of

New Delhi.
From one service organization to
another, the LSJUMB is happy to offer
69 1/2 Galvez to the Pi Beta Phi sorority.

I would like to applaud Director of
Residential Education Jane Camarillo's
recent decision to grant what will likely lie
a prime residence to yet another one of
Stanford's noteworthy community service
organizations.
1 believe that this decision by the Office
of Residential Education sends a strong
message to all students on campus, which
is that community service is the way to go.
Community service is an admirable goal
for people of our age, who are too often
overly involved with trivial issues such as
physical appearance, clothing, status or
inter-organizational cattiness.
Fortunately, community service orga
nizations are above this. They invest all of
their time and energy to service, never
once giving in to their own individual
needs or concerns. These community ser
vice organizations deserve the best and
most desired housing on campus, because
they embrace the entire campus commu
nity, constantly enriching student life by
holding social events which are open to

each and every one of us, regardless of
whether or not we have chosen to join a
similar community service organization.
Furthermore, these community ser
vice organizations openly welcome new
members. The comprehensive selection
process is one in which trivial details such
as hairstyle and shoes are ignored; only
the most genuine individuals, those who
are completely dedicated to the ideals of
community service, are considered for
membership.
So go ahead, Jane Camarillo, give
away Bob, or Narnia, or Whitman or 680
Lomita, four of the most desired houses
on campus, despite the fact that student
input suggested that houses such as these
be kept for the general student popula
tion.
Let the shining community service
organizations live there. As for the rest of
us, who are too self-absorbed in our indi
vidual, unimportant activities such as ath
letics, music, art, research, volunteering
or working to pay our way through
school because mom and dad can't afford
it? We don't deserve the privilege.

Flo Mo crosswalk not the real problem?
This letter is in response to the numer
ous articles and letters about the "May
field Avenue Bike Accident Problem."
First of all, there is no problem. Flo
rence Moore Hall residents are the prob
lem. I used to live in 080 Lomita and had
to cross Mayfield on a daily basis. Sorry to
disappoint your cause, but I was never hit
by a car. Only idiots get hit by cars.
Instead of trying to stop motorists
from driving over Flo Mo residents, why
don't you (the Flo Mo staff) inform your
residents that cars are heavy and made of
metal, and unless they enjoy the feeling of
being pressed into asphalt by a car tire,
they should make safety a personal
responsibility and look for cars before
crossing the street.
Don't expect cars to stop. You stop.
Ruining our campus by planting more
stop signs or building an unnecessary
light signal is not the solution. Looking
both ways and riding defensively is the
solution. Use your brain and maybe you'll
live to ride another day.

Graduate Student housing plan
Tuesday's Daily carried a headline
for a front page story about a reduction
iu graduate housing subsidies which
was not representative of the facts.
While the number of graduate students
who will be subsidized in off-campus
apartments will be reduced, the Uni
versity will increase the total number of
students receiving direct housing sup
port.
The University has approved an
increase in the subsidy program to sup
port the financing of 508 new on-cam
pus studio apartments. In addition,
subsidies will continue for 300 to 400
students in off campus apartments.
That represents financial support for a
total of up to 900 students, a 509J
increase over the number subsidized in
1999-2000.
In mid-January, Housing Assign
ment Services sent a letter and a survey
to graduate students in subsidized off
campus apartments asking them to pro
vide information about their own plans
and alerting them to the possibility of
changes in the subsidy program for the
coming year. This letter was sent out

prior to the decision by the senior
administration to increase the funding
of the subsidized housing program.
As a result of that increase, not as
many of the possible modifications to
the off-campus program may have to
occur.
We will, however, need to make
every effort to be efficient in the use of
the off-campus subsidy funds so we can
help the largest possible number of stu
dents. Higher priced subsidized apart
ments and those which are farthest
from campus will likely be eliminated
from the program during the course of
next year.
Currently, staff members and gradu
ate students are working together to
find ways to maximize the use of the
available subsidy funds and to do so in
ways that have the least negative impact
on the stability of graduate student
lives. All are working cooperatively to
learn more about graduate students'
housing needs and to develop
approaches to the housing problem
aimed at meeting them.

Responding to Pi Phi housing decision
I recently finished reading Director of
Residential Education Jane Camarillo's
release about the Greek housing issues.
After reading it, I can only hope that it
was writ ten as some kind of a twisted joke.
Responses from the recent student res
idential survey indicate that the majority
of the students do not want prime hous
ing— housing on the Row, housing with
two-room doubles and housing that
draws well — to be given over to the
Greek system. The committee has chosen
four of the most appealing houses, by
those and other criteria, to be considered
for the Pi Phi's new house. It seems that
the prospective houses were selected by
size, with utter disregard to student
input.
I was one of the people who opposed
Greek housing on the residential housing
survey. I am not opposed to Greek hous
ing in general, but I feel strongly that the
rest of the undergraduate population
should not be adversely affected when
fraternities or sororities get housing.

It makes no sense to me that a group
of people should be guaranteed good
housing, simply because they selected
themselves for a Greek organization,
while non-Greek people must draw
unpreferred and risk living in the unde
sirable Wilbur or Stern during their
unpreferred year.
Having such different standards for
Greek and non-Greek students is simply
not fair.
II the fraternities and sororities have
such a need to live together, then let them
live in dorms, or even mediocre houses,
but don't select their future residences
from a list of the most appealing houses
on campus, with apparent disregard to
opinions from the student surveys.

As many Stanford students have
recently found out, the Pi Beta Phi soror
ity will receive campus housing in the
2000-2001 school year. In Residential
Education surveys, students listed criteria

for specific Greek housing as houses that
are not on the inner Row, do not draw
very high and do not contain a great deal
of two-room doubles or singles.
However, the administration decided
that they would offer four houses that
contradict the criteria directly, slapping
Stanford students in their collective face.
What many students do not know is
that the Stanford Band has been forced to
re-apply for housing every year over the
past tew years. This year, we were sad
dened to bid farewell to our home for
over a year, a triple-wide trailer at 69 1/2
Galvez. Being an organization by the peo
ple and for the people, the Band would
like to respond to students' concerns and
offer 69 1/2 Galvez for the Pi Phis.
Not only does this facility fit each of the
criteria set forth by the students, we feel
that it has much to offer the Pi Beta Phi
sorority.
Located in a scenic gravel lot near the
Ford Center and across the street from
the newly constructed Alumni Shrine, 69
1/2 Galvez offers enough parking for any
combination of 55 BMW 'i-series convert

ibles and Z3s. Bathrooms are convenient
ly located at the Ford Center during busi
ness hours, and at the History Corner 24
hours a day.
What's more, this fully air-condi
tioned(!) facility is raised four feet off the
ground, allowing its inhabitants to easily
look down on passers-by. True, this is not
ADA compliant, but the Band dealt with
the problem by simply lifting our
wheelchair-propelled members by hand.
If the Pi Phis cannot do this, they can at
least take solace that 69 1/2 Galvez will be
renovated under the CIP program in
