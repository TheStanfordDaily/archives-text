Responding to Pi Phi housing decision
I recently finished reading Director of
Residential Education Jane Camarillo's
release about the Greek housing issues.
After reading it, I can only hope that it
was writ ten as some kind of a twisted joke.
Responses from the recent student res
idential survey indicate that the majority
of the students do not want prime hous
ing— housing on the Row, housing with
two-room doubles and housing that
draws well — to be given over to the
Greek system. The committee has chosen
four of the most appealing houses, by
those and other criteria, to be considered
for the Pi Phi's new house. It seems that
the prospective houses were selected by
size, with utter disregard to student
input.
I was one of the people who opposed
Greek housing on the residential housing
survey. I am not opposed to Greek hous
ing in general, but I feel strongly that the
rest of the undergraduate population
should not be adversely affected when
fraternities or sororities get housing.

It makes no sense to me that a group
of people should be guaranteed good
housing, simply because they selected
themselves for a Greek organization,
while non-Greek people must draw
unpreferred and risk living in the unde
sirable Wilbur or Stern during their
unpreferred year.
Having such different standards for
Greek and non-Greek students is simply
not fair.
II the fraternities and sororities have
such a need to live together, then let them
live in dorms, or even mediocre houses,
but don't select their future residences
from a list of the most appealing houses
on campus, with apparent disregard to
opinions from the student surveys.

As many Stanford students have
recently found out, the Pi Beta Phi soror
ity will receive campus housing in the
2000-2001 school year. In Residential
Education surveys, students listed criteria

for specific Greek housing as houses that
are not on the inner Row, do not draw
very high and do not contain a great deal
of two-room doubles or singles.
However, the administration decided
that they would offer four houses that
contradict the criteria directly, slapping
Stanford students in their collective face.
What many students do not know is
that the Stanford Band has been forced to
re-apply for housing every year over the
past tew years. This year, we were sad
dened to bid farewell to our home for
over a year, a triple-wide trailer at 69 1/2
Galvez. Being an organization by the peo
ple and for the people, the Band would
like to respond to students' concerns and
offer 69 1/2 Galvez for the Pi Phis.
Not only does this facility fit each of the
criteria set forth by the students, we feel
that it has much to offer the Pi Beta Phi
sorority.
Located in a scenic gravel lot near the
Ford Center and across the street from
the newly constructed Alumni Shrine, 69
1/2 Galvez offers enough parking for any
combination of 55 BMW 'i-series convert

ibles and Z3s. Bathrooms are convenient
ly located at the Ford Center during busi
ness hours, and at the History Corner 24
hours a day.
What's more, this fully air-condi
tioned(!) facility is raised four feet off the
ground, allowing its inhabitants to easily
look down on passers-by. True, this is not
ADA compliant, but the Band dealt with
the problem by simply lifting our
wheelchair-propelled members by hand.
If the Pi Phis cannot do this, they can at
least take solace that 69 1/2 Galvez will be
renovated under the CIP program in
2027. Believe me, it is well worth it to be
raised so far above others.
The size of 69 1/2 Galvez might seem
worrisome to prospective residents, but I
can assure you all that it is of adequate
size. Clearly, if 200 slightly overweight
individuals and their instruments can
reside there for an extended period of
time, so can 55 slender women. With the
addition of a little furniture, we actually
found 69 1/2 Galvez quite cozy, even with
a population density rivaled only at San
Quentin State Prison and some parts of

New Delhi.
From one service organization to
another, the LSJUMB is happy to offer
69 1/2 Galvez to the Pi Beta Phi sorority.
