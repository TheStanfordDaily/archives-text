# Sixth Man wins in spirit, loses in behavior
## 
### PETER DOUGLAS GUEST COLUMNIST 
I love Stanford Athletics. 1 love the
teams and going to the games and
shouting myself hoarse. 1 just love
being a Stanford fan.

I especially love, and
have followed closely
over the past three sea
sons, our football team.
And, in that time, I
have learned a few
things about being a
fan: first, if you're a
Weenie, then you're a
violent, disgruntled
nimrod; second, being a

fan is primarily about supporting someone
else and helping someone else do the best
that they can; third, being a fan is only

marginally about socializing in the stands;
fourth, being a fan is not about directing all
of your pent-up aggression and negative
energy toward the opposing team (Kal
does that.) To sum up, being a fan is about
supporting your team, whether they win or
lose, whether they make a fantastic play or
screw up big-time.
How do 1 know all of the great things a
tan can be? Because 1 go to all of the home,
and a few of the away, football games. And
because I saw the Stanford fans behave
intelligently, passionately and honorably at
the last Big Game.
How do I know all of the useless and
self-centered things a fan is capable of
being, doing and saying? Because I've
twice watched the Kal fans violently attack
the Stanford students after Big Game (my
freshman year one of them hit me in the
head with a block of wood.) Because I've

seen the Weenies tear up their own field
and teat down their own goal post. And
because I've seen the Sixth Man in action.
At Stanford, going to a f<x)tball game
(with the possible exception of Big Game) is
something that people do only because
they love football, our team or the smell of
the grass. Going to a basketball game, on
the other hand, has become a symbol of
how "cool" you are and of your commit
ment to being a socialite.
I'm not suggesting that the football fans
are always perfect; nor am I suggesting that
the basketball fans are always an embar
rassment. But I will say that there's some
thing wrong when our team is shooting
free-throws and the Sixth Man is shouting
"left, right... SIT DC)WN," just as the shot
is being taken. If the pr oblem is not obvi
ous, let me interpret: the Sixth Man mem
bers do not, for the most part, understand

how the game is played; they almost never
cheer for our team if they lose the game
(granted we've only lost one this season,
but this goes for when we're behind in a
game as well); and even when our team is
succeeding or is victorious, the Sixth Man is
usually so preoccupied with trash-talking
the other team, or their lans, that they fail
to give our team any really positive demon
stration of support and confidence.
The fact is that the Sixth Man may be
loud as all hell when we're up by 30 and
someone dunks, but they're almost always
silent when we're down by ten.
I don't want this to come across as me
expressing all of my aggression and nega
tive energy. I intend everything I've said as
constructive criticism (wonderfully cliche,
isn't it?) Please, feel free to write angry let
ters to The Daily. II I can't get the Sixth
Man thinking about their behavior by c all

ing them "the largest collective of five-year
olds on campus," then why am I writing
this column?
One last thing. Last night someone sug
gested to me that maybe our basketball
team wants us to talk trash to the other
team. 1 o that, 1 say two things: one, if they
need our help in that sense then they're in
big trouble; and two, and more important
ly, 1 believe that it is always better, both eth
ically and spiritually, to build people up, to
support, rather than to tear people down,
to attack. Being a fan, this column and I are
about doing what's positive and ethical, not
what's popular. (And 1 am well aware that
both of those things are subjective, at least
in a temporal sense.) See you at the game.
