## Card faces rejuvenated Trojans USC men's basketball is back at full strength as No. 1 Stanford hosts last home games of season 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
If you were a Stanford player or coach, you might
start to get a little paranoid. It almost seems like every
one is out to get the top-ranked Cardinal.
When USC (14-12, 7-7 Pacific 10 Conference)
comes to Maples Pavilion tonight, Sam Clancy will be
making his first appearance returning from a foot in
jury that had sidelined him for over a month. Clancy,
who was injured along with Jarvis Turner in the Tro
jans' win over Arizona State on Jan. 20, was leading the
team in scoring when he went down.
Saturday, when UCLA (15-11, 6-8) rolls into town,
the top-ranked Cardinal will once again welcome an
opponent back to the floor. Sophomore forward
Ja√üon Rush, who led the Bruins in rebounding and
was third in scoring a season ago, will return to action
for the first time in 24 games. Monday the NCAA re
duced what had been an unprecedented 29-game sus
pension to nine games. Rush will serve the last of those
nine games tonight when UCLA plays at California.
Tuesday Stanford (24-1, 13-1) head coach Mike
Montgomery joked that with the way things are going,
maybe Kobe Bryant will regain his eligibility next.
Back in reality, the returns of Clancy and Rush do
change the dynamics of the next few games. Clancy

gives the Trojans added strength inside, something
they sorely missed in Stanford's win earlier this month.
Rush gives the sometimes anemic UCLA offense an
other weapon and a tremendous rebounding boost.
"Clancy was a tremendous part of what SC was
doing early on," Montgomery said, referring to the
Trojans' hot 5-0 start in conference. But, "he's not been
practicing full strength, and they're going to have to
work him in. Vou just don't know how Clancy's going
to respond. Certainly he can do some things, but what
kind of shape is he going to be in?"
On the other hand, Rush lias been practicing with
the Bruins throughout his suspension, meaning his re
turn to the team should be much more fluid.
"There shouldn't be a dropoff," Montgomery said.
"1 would guess that lie's in shape, he knows what
they're doing. He's a monster on the boards for sure,
and quite an athlete. So 1 would guess that's going to
give them a tremendous boost."
The returns don't stop at Maples. Tonight against
Oregon, Richard Jefferson will be making his first ap
pearance since going down with a foot injury in the
Wildcats' 68-65 win over Stanford Jan. 8. The return of
Jefferson, a solid, athletic small forward, gives Arizona
a great chance to continue its remarkable season, even
with the loss of center Loren Woods, who is out iiKlefi
nitely with a back injury.
While Jefferson will see time this week, he said he is
really gearing up his return for next Thursday's much
anticipated rematch with Stanford in Tucson, Ariz.
The game could potentially determine the Pacific 10
