# Borchardt out for year with stress fracture
## 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
Two weeks before the begin
ning of the NCAA Tournament,
Stanford's vaunted depth suf
fered a permanent hit yesterday
when tlie team learned that
freshman center Curtis Bor
chardt would be sidelined with
an injury for the remainder of
the season.
Borchardt has been on the
sideline for the past five games
with what was described as a
stress reaction to his right foot.
Recently, there was hope that
Borchardt would be able to re
turn and practice with the team
next week, but tests conducted
yesterday at Stanford Hospital
showed that, in fact, Borchardt
had a stress fracture and would
be out for the next six to eight
weeks.
The NCAA Championship
game is slated for April 3, less
than five weeks from today.
While Borchardt had only
scored a total of 10 points since
the conference season began in
early January, his energy off the
bench was something Stanford
had begun to rely on.
When he was injured, Bor
chardt was averaging two blocked
shots per game, good enough for
second in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence.

Borchardt burst onto the scene
for the Cardinal in a two-game
stretch in late November.
Against Cal-State Bakersfield
on Nov. 24, he set a Stanford
record with six blocks in the
game. Three days later, against
then-No. 2 Auburn, he scored a
game-high 15 points to go along
with four blocks and six re
bounds.
However, since the return of
senior forward Mark Madsen in
late December, Borchardt's min
utes and production have
dropped considerably.
