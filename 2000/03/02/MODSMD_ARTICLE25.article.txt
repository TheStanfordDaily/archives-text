Last April, Ari/.oiia State's Alli
son Bradshaw handed sopho
more Marissa Irvin one of her
seven season losses, upsetting the
Cardinal star, 7-() (7- [), 7-5.
Although Irvin, who coin lud
ed her freshman campaign
ranked second in the nation alter

reaching the NCAA finals in May,
deleated Bradshaw in two other
meetings last year, slu- looks for

the nation's Mth-rankeri player.
I he question is, does Brad
shaw stand a chance against Irvin
this lime around?
"It's not going to happen
again," said senior l eryn Ashley.
"She's not going to beat her
again."

Sophomore Marissa Irvin, who has recently returned to collegiate play after
a brief stint on the professional tour, will help to lead the No. 1 Cardinal
against No. 26 Arizona and No. 10 Arizona State this weekend.
several of the nation's top players.
Does any collegiate player pose
a threat to Irvin?
Interestingly enough, Irvin's
most legitimate threat may come
in the form of one of her team
mates, freshman Laura Granville.
Granville, who won the presti
gious Rolex National Intercolle
giate Indoor Championships, the
third leg of the collegiate Grand
Slam, in early February, has
launched a debut campaign remi
niscent of Irvin's precocious
debut one year ago, amassing a
28-2 singles record.
At No. 2, she is currently the
nation's highest-ranked fresh
man.
Of course, Irvin, the more de
veloped player, would likely have
an edge over Granville if the two
met in the NCAA tournament
later this year.
Both Irvin and Granville are
renowned for their potent fust
serves and Hat, powerful baseline
drives. Both players are quick
around the court and competent
at the net.
Irvin, however, boasts far more
professional experience.

In lieu of collegiate competi
tion, Irvin has participated in pro
fessional tournaments over the
past several months. Although
she has yet to participate in
enough dual matches to qualify
for a collegiate ranking, at No. 99,
she is currently the highest
ranked amateur on the Women's
Tennis Association Tour
In January, Irvin upset 35th
ranked Corina Morariu in the
first round of the Australian Open
in Melbourne, Australia, before
succumbing to eventual champi
on Lindsay Davenport in the sec
ond round. A month ago, she cap
tured her first professional title at
the $35,000 Challenger tourna
ment in Clearwater, Fla.
As its most crucial dual match
es approach, however, Irvin will
fully devote herself to the Cardi
nal.
This weekend, she'll lead the
top-ranked Cardinal (13-0, 7-0
Pacific 10 Conference) as it travels
to Arizona to face No. 26 Arizona
(6-3) and No. 10 Arizona State (7-
1). The Wildcats are led by
Michelle Cough and Lindsay
Blau, while the Sun Devils are led
by Bradshaw, No. 40 Karin Palme
and No. 92 Mhairi Brown.
"The conditions are tough in
Arizona," Ashley said. "There's

dry air, high altitude and it's
windy. But 1 think we're ready."
Ashley, who has been ranked
as high as fourth in the nation, re
cently endured a stint of erratic
play while recovering liom ten
donitis in her wrist. The senior
captain now seems to be back in
fine form.
"I've been playing better, so
I'm not worried," Ashley said.
"I'm still struggling to find a con
sistent rhythm."
Sophomore Gabriela Lastra,
on the other hand, has definitely
found a consistent rhythm this
season. Playing No. 5 singles for
the Cardinal, Lastra has not suf
fered a loss since early January,
winning her last 12 singles match
es in straight sets.
"I'm feeling very confident,"
Lastra said. "I'm playing two
spots lower than last year, so it's
easier. I just want to keep playing
my best."
As the Cardinal heads to Ari
zona, Irvin, Granville, Ashley and
Lastra hope to help the talented
Stanford squad maintain its un
blemished record. This season,
Stanford has won all 13 of its dual
matches. 111 fact, the Cardinal cur
rently sports a 31-match win
streak, its last loss coming in
March of 1999.
