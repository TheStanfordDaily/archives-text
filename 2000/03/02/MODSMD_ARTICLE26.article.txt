# Facing two directions
## After leading the women's basketball team in scoring last year, sophomore Lindsey Yamasaki is coming to terms with the demands of being a two-sport star

As the 1998-99 season drew to a
close, it looked like the Stanford
women's basketball team had
found its new up-and-coming
star. Freshman guard Lindsey Ya
masaki astounded fans with her
three-point shot and inside game,
while leading the Cardinal in scor
ing with 14.0 points per game.
She was second only to Milena
Flores in minutes played and as
sists, and was third on the team in
rebounding. It was no surprise
when Yamasaki was placed on the
Pacific 10 Conference All Fresh
man team, and was an All-Confer
ence honorable mention selection.
But after a stunning breakout
season, people are beginning to
wonder what ever happened to
lindsey Yamasaki. After offseason
knee surgery on her right patellar
tendon and an excellent fall sea
son on the Stanford volleyball
team, the freshman star is fulfilling
a much different role on this year's
team.
" I was out all spring and sum
mer with my surgery when the
team was playing together and
improving, and then I went
right into volleyball," Yamasaki
said. "I haven't played basket

ball since last year."
Yamasaki did not join the bas
ketball team until after the NCAA
Volleyball Championships in mid-
December. Since then she has
been seeing limited playing time,
averaging 14.2 minutes a game.
She is quietly contributing, aver
aging 6.5 points in the 17 games
she has played.
"It was a good year for me to
play volleyball," Yamasaki said. "I
missed it, but by the time basket
ball came around 1 was really ex
cited."
Yamasaki redshirted last year
on the volleyball team to ease the
transition to college sports. In her
first year, Yamasaki was a major
contributor on the national-run
ner-up Cardinal volleyball team,
earning her a spot on the Pac-1()
All-Freshman team, and honor
able mention Pac-10 honors.
However, along with the perks
associated with being a high-pro
file two-sport athlete, there are
many added pressures.
"Dealing with two different
teams, two different coaching
staffs and two different programs
is really difficult, because you want
to make both happy," Yamasaki
