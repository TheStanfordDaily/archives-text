# Facing two directions
## After leading the women's basketball team in scoring last year, sophomore Lindsey Yamasaki is coming to terms with the demands of being a two-sport star 
### MAUREEN MULLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the 1998-99 season drew to a
close, it looked like the Stanford
women's basketball team had
found its new up-and-coming
star. Freshman guard Lindsey Ya
masaki astounded fans with her
three-point shot and inside game,
while leading the Cardinal in scor
ing with 14.0 points per game.
She was second only to Milena
Flores in minutes played and as
sists, and was third on the team in
rebounding. It was no surprise
when Yamasaki was placed on the
Pacific 10 Conference All Fresh
man team, and was an All-Confer
ence honorable mention selection.
But after a stunning breakout
season, people are beginning to
wonder what ever happened to
lindsey Yamasaki. After offseason
knee surgery on her right patellar
tendon and an excellent fall sea
son on the Stanford volleyball
team, the freshman star is fulfilling
a much different role on this year's
team.
" I was out all spring and sum
mer with my surgery when the
team was playing together and
improving, and then I went
right into volleyball," Yamasaki
said. "I haven't played basket

ball since last year."
Yamasaki did not join the bas
ketball team until after the NCAA
Volleyball Championships in mid-
December. Since then she has
been seeing limited playing time,
averaging 14.2 minutes a game.
She is quietly contributing, aver
aging 6.5 points in the 17 games
she has played.
"It was a good year for me to
play volleyball," Yamasaki said. "I
missed it, but by the time basket
ball came around 1 was really ex
cited."
Yamasaki redshirted last year
on the volleyball team to ease the
transition to college sports. In her
first year, Yamasaki was a major
contributor on the national-run
ner-up Cardinal volleyball team,
earning her a spot on the Pac-1()
All-Freshman team, and honor
able mention Pac-10 honors.
However, along with the perks
associated with being a high-pro
file two-sport athlete, there are
many added pressures.
"Dealing with two different
teams, two different coaching
staffs and two different programs
is really difficult, because you want
to make both happy," Yamasaki

said. "You want eveiything to be
cohesive, but it doesn't work that
way. It was one big mess in the mid
dle. I was tugging both ways."
Women's basketball head coach
Lara VanDerveer is supportive of
Yamasaki's decision to play two
sports. However, she also notes the
competitive nature of basketball at
this level.
"She is in a much different role
on tfiis year's team," VanDerveer
said. "Getting back in the swing in
basketball at the highest level is very
difficult. We have a much different
team this year. We've got Jamie
Carey, and Lauren St. Clair is play
ing really well for us."
Yamasaki feels that she will
eventually probably have to elimi
nate one sport from her college ca
reer. Although she loves both bas
ketball and volleyball, she looks to
make it to the WNBA and realizes
that to accomplish that goal she w ill
have to concentrate her efforts
more in one direction.
"Had there been a professional
volleyball league, I would probably
be completely torn," Yamasaki
said. "One of these days I am going
to have to focus on one sport. It
could be next year, it could be two
years from now, it could be never."
As for the rest of the season, Ya
masaki definitely isn't out of the
Cardinal picture.
"We are looking for anyone to
contribute," said VanDerveer. "A
lot of it is playing within herself and
knowing what she is good at. I think
she is really concentrating on her
defense and working hard defen
sively. She would help our team
and help herself if she really got se
rious about rebounding."
Yamasaki also realizes that now
is definitely the time to step up. She
has been coming off the bench and
has given the Cardinal some g(x>d
minutes in recent games.
"Although there is that starting
group, and the sixth and seventh
men are right there," Yamasaki
said. "I think a lot of people have
stepped up at different times. We
are all going to play a big role in
postseason play."
If last year was any sign of Ya
masaki's big game intensity, it looks
like a lot could still be coming from
the sophomore. In Stanford's first
round NCAA loss to Maine last
year, she scored 24 points, includ
ing six three-pointers.
Fans shouldn't turn their eyes
just yet. Lindsay Yamasaki is ready
to make some major waves.
