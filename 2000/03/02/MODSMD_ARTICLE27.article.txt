# No. 9 softball rolls into Georgia
## Stanford faces another tough field in NFCA Leadoff Classic 
### EMILY DRESSEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
From No. 21 to No. 11 to No. 9. The Stan
ford softball team (16-1) continues to creep up
in the rankings behind historically talented

teams sucli as No. 8 Fresno State and No. 7 ( al
ifornia.
This weekend, the team will participate in its
fourth consecutive tournament on the road at
the NFC.A Leadoll'Classic in Columbus, (ia.
The players are coining oil a live-game un
defeated showing in St. Ceorge, Utah, Init dis
play not even a glimmer of a champion's cock
iness.
"At this level you have to play hard all the
time," sophomore shortstop Rohin Walker
said. "As soon as you let down your guard.

you'll get beat. We go in a lot ol the time not
knowing what our opponent is capable of, es
pecially in these tournaments. You have to ap
proach even game like vou're playing a Wash
ington or a U('LA."
|unior right-lielder Ramona Shelburne
couldn't agree more. " I his C.eorgia tourna
ment, espeeiall) , can produce a lot ol surprises.
It's hard to compare teams Irom ditt'erent areas
of the count rv until you can all plav each other.
I remember last year in Georgia,
walking by and seeing this
Louisiana-Lafayette team, who's
now ranked No. 15, and being
like, 'who are they?'. They wound
up beating Washington and win
ning the tournament."
Although a record of 16-1 is
nothing to frown at, the team is
quick to point out areas where it
still needs some fine-tuning. And
the players are absolutely
adamant about fixing them.
"We still have not played seven
full innings of softball," said
Shelburne. "One inning we'll play
well and the next won't be as
clean. We have definite glimpses
of what we are capable of, which is
encouraging. We just need to put
it all together."
The Cardinal will get a chance
to perfect its play come tomorrow
when it will face tough Mississippi
State and Massachusetts teams,
the latter whom they beat in
Phoenix three weekends ago.
However, the Stanford game
was the Minutewomen's first of
the season and much can improve
about a ball club in a matter of a
couple weeks.
The NFCA Leadoff Classic is
stocked with many of the nation's
elite teams. As Shelburne put it, "If
you are top team, you're there."
Of the 24 participating teams,
15 are in the top 25, and the re
maining six teams have all re
ceived honorary votes for top bids.
In other words, this will be no
picnic. The Cardinal has its work
cut out for it.
Saturday, the team is slotted to
play No. 5 Oklahoma before
heading into bracket elimination
play.

As for the goals for this particu
lar weekend, head coach John
Rittman stressed the importance
of not playing to the tempo of
their opponent, but setting their
own pace.
"We need to execute defensive
ly and improve on our base-run
ning," Rittman said. "Our offense

has been pretty dependable with
everyone picking up the slack
here and there. It's nice not to
have to depend 011 two or three
people to produce at the plate.
But, in close games, we can't af
ford to give away outs like we've
been doing. Good teams will capi
talize on that."
