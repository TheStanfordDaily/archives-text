# Men's tennis rebounds to dump California
## Stanford celebrates assent back to top of rankings by beating cross-Bay rivals 
### SAMEER AHMED STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team (9-0, 3-
0 Pacific 10 Conference) demonstrated that
it deserves to be the No. 1 team in the na
tion with a 5-2 defeat over Bay Area rival
California (4-2, 1-2) in Berkeley yesterday
afternoon.
The Cardinal was actually losing at the
beginning of the match in doubles play. Ju
nior Alex Kim and senior Ceoff Abrams,
the No. 1 ranked duo in the nation, defeat
ed the Bears' No. 21 doubles team of Scott
Kintz and Erik Dmytruk, 8-5, at the No. 1
spot. But Stanford lost the other two very
competitive doubles matches, both by the
score of 9-8, and Cal went up 1-0.
"The team could have definitely played
better in doubles today," associate coach
John Whitlinger said. "We needed to come
out with a little more fire."
However, the Cardinal battled back and
won five of the six singles matches to seal
the victory.

In the No. 1 spot, Cal freshman John
Paul Fruttero pushed Kim, the second
ranked player in the nation, to three sets
before losing 6-4, 5-7, 6-2. Kim improved
his overall record to 24-3 and dual match
record to 8-1.
The only other match to go all three sets
was in No. 4 singles, where Stanford fresh
man Scott Lipsky defeated Hiro Nakamu
ra, 6-4, 1-6, 7-5.
The rest of the Cardinal's wins came
with relative ease. In the No. 2 spot,
Abrams, ranked No. 11 in the nation, beat
Dmytruk, 7-6, 6-2, while freshman David
Martin cruised past Kintz at No. 3 singles.
"Cal is always difficult to play in Berke
ley," Whitlinger said. "It was good the way
our guys bounced back in singles. Luckily,
we had enough in the end."
Earlier yesterday, the ITA men's colle
giate rankings came out and Stanford was
back at the top of the poll for the first time
since March 8, 1999. The Cardinal's No. 1
ranking is primarily due to its title at the
USTA/ITA National Team Indoor
Championships last weekend in Louisville,
Ky., where Stanford defeated many quality
teams, including Pac-10 rival UCLA, cur
rently ranked No. 2 in the country.
However, to keep its status as the best
team in the country and its undefeated sea
son in tact, Whitlinger believes that the

Cardinal must play better than it did yes
terday against Cal.
"Overall, we've had a great quarter, but
we still have a lot of work to do." Whitlinger

said. "If you keep losing the doubles point
like we did against UCLA and Cal, you're
playing with fire. The Cal match was good
wakeup call for our guys."
