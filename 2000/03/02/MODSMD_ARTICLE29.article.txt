# Water polo faces Southern California
## Team looks to avenge earlier loss as they travel to face the defending national champions 
### ELISSA KESZLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Tomorrow the No. 2 Stanford
women's water polo team will trav
el to Los Angeles to take on No. 4
USC Trojans. The Cardinal (8-3,
1 -0 Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation) is looking for revenge after
losing to the Trojans earlier this
season in San Diego and for its sec
ond-place finish to USC at last
year's National Collegiate Champi
onship Tournament.
Stanford needs a victory over
USC this weekend in order to
maintain its position at No. 2 and
to maintain its undefeated MPSF
record.
USC is expecting to give Stan
ford an intense battle. Five of
USC's six leading scorers were re
cruited from Europe. Three play
ers, Nina Wengst from Germany,
Aniko Pelk from Hungary and
Sandra Milicer from Yugoslavia,
are all members of their native
countries' national teams. Last year
Pelk received All-America honors
at collegiate nationals and was
USC's top scorer.
Wengst, Felk and Milicer are
best known for their outside shoot
ing abilities. Fortunately, Stanford
has one of the nation's top goalies
in redshirt freshman Jackie Frank.
Frank redshirted last year in
order to be a member of the Unit
ed States National Team and par
ticipate in the Olympic Trials. In
this year's college season, Frank
has already established herself as a
force to be reckoned with.
Frank's blocking skills make her
the foundation for the Cardinal de
fense, and her long-distance pass
ing ability allows her to set up her
teammates on offensive counterat
tacks.
Stanford's plan to beat USC is to
play consistent defense through
out the game and to prevent the
Trojans' outside shooters from tak
ing clear shots. Offensively, the
Cardinal will focus on its counter
attacks, its two-meter players and
6-on-5 opportunities to score.
Sophomore Margie Dingeldein

is expecting to lead the Cardinal on
its counters. Dingeldein was Stan
ford's top scorer last year and is one
of the fastest players in collegiate
water polo. Her fast breaks and
rapid transition from defense to of
fense has helped to make Stan
ford's counterattack one of its
major weapons.
Juniors Anne-Marie Keenan
and Hilary Gallogly and freshman
Julie Gardner all had scoring suc
cess in Stanford's last meeting with
the Trojans. Keenan and Gallogly
also play key defensive roles as
two-meter defenders for the Car
dinal.
Gardner, sophomore Kate Pet
tit and junior Kelly Shouey strive as
the Cardinal's two-meter players.
Gardner is known for her quick
sweep shots from set, while Pettit
and Shouey use their grit and
power to score for the Cardinal.
Junior Kris Koblik is another
Cardinal weapon. Koblik masters
her position as a utility player by
being productive at all of the field
positions. Her left-handed shot
adds to Stanford's scoring threat
on 6-on-5, and her counterattack
tactics allow her to draw defensive
player ejections.
After last weekend's tourna
ment Stanford has moved up in its
ranking from No. 4 to No. 2, be
hind only No. 1 California. The na
tion's top four teams, California,
Stanford, UCLA and USC, re
ferred to as the "Fab Four", are ex
pected to fluctuate in their rank
ings throughout the season.
Immediately following its game
against USC] tomorrow, Stanford
will board a plane and head to
Hawaii to participate in the Aloha
Classic, which will be held Saturday
and Sunday. The Cardinal has
won the last two Aloha Classics it
has attended and hopes to bring
home its third Classic title this
weekend.
The two teams Stanford will face
in Hawaii are No. 8 San Jose State
and N0.6 Hawaii. One concern the
Cardinal has is the possible effects
of jet lag on its playing, as the first
game of the tournament for the
Cardinal on Saturday morning.
While the Cardinal has already
beaten San Jose Suite three times in
a row, it has not yet met with
Hawaii thus far this season. Hawaii
will be rested and in its home pool
and is expected to give Stanford a
strong fight.
