# Flood data posted on Palo Alto Web site
## 
### JOHN HUETTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The days of town criers or
sirens rousing the population
from their beds and alerting them
of disaster are over in Santa Clara
County. True to its Silicon Valley
location, Palo Alto has dropped
these outmoded clarion calls in
favor ofan online flood water mon
itoring service.
The Web site, found at
hll p:/ / w w w.city.pal o
alto.ca. Us/early warning/creek
levels. Html, was developed by
John Ballard, Palo Alto Public
Works Supervisor.
Currently, it contains a graphi
cal representation of the San Fran
cisquito Creek water level below
the Waverly Street and Chaucer
Street bridges, the Matadero
Creek level beneath West
Bayshore Road, and the Adobe-
Creek level under East Meadow
Drive.
The site also graphs the amount
of water in each creek for the last
12 hours and features a video feed
of the San Francisquito Creek at
the northbound Highway 101
bridge. All of the information is
updated every three minutes.
The goal of the website to give
citizens enough time to save be
longings and vehicles from on
coming waters and ready disaster
control teams in advance.
"This is not going to be an ab
solute predictor," said Palo Alto
Fire Chief Ruben Grijalva. "It
gives us an indicator to start notify
ing the community earlier in case
of flood conditions. It's a good tool
for the community to be looking
for conditions themselves from
their homes."
While such careful attention to
flood conditions may seem
overkill given California's reputa
tion for sunny weather, winter
flooding remains a constant prob-
lem in San Mateo and Santa (Mara
County.
After the February 1998 floods,
which caused $28 million in dam
age to Palo Alto, East Palo Alto, and
Menlo Park and shut down Stan
ford for a day, the Palo Alto Public
Works Department, with aid from
die Utilities and Information Tech
nology Departments, developed
and installed the site.
Ballard noted that, with the ex
ception of t he West Bayshore Road
monitoring system, compiling the
flow data has been "relatively inex
pensive" and "absorbed in the op
erating budget."
"I think that the value that it
brings to the city outweighs the
cost," said Ballard.
Residents, no doubt recalling
the 1998 damage to 1,700 area
homes, have Hocked to the new re
source.
"It's been tremendously suc
cessful and heavily utilized," said
Glenn Roberts, Palo Alto direc tor
of public works, who estimated the
site received "several thousand bits
per hour."
"I've been in discussion with
many residents," he said. "During
a storm, they'll log on and keep
track of it."
Grijalva agreed with the popu
larity of the resource. "It's one ol
our most actively hit sites. When it's
raining, we get thousands of hits."
Mick McDonald, Palo Alto Of
fice of Emergency Services manag
er, also spoke about the popularity
of the site. "It gives [residents] sort
of a yardstick on how high the
creek is at a given day. It gives them
a level of assurance. "
The site received a baptism ol
fire of sorts during the heavy
storms on February 13. During
heavy rains and rising creek vva

ters, Grijalva said the Web site al
lowed city officials to "compare
data with what we knew to be true
[of flood risks]" and reassure resi
dents the floodgates "didn't reach
half the volume that tliev did din
ing 1998."
Roberts said he believed the
February 13 storms were a good
test of the site, despite the populace
losing web access when the storm
killed power to the City of Palo
Alto's Internet service provider.
McDonald acknowledged that
"we're still in sort of an area of mas
saging our emergency plans a lit
tle." However, he stressed that < ity
ollicials never lost Internet capabil
ities.
I lie outage] never put us out
of commission," said McDon
ald."We had a direct link to our
utilities."
McDonald assured that losing
the site would not catch city de
partments unprepared during a
llood. "It is just a tool - not some
thing that is 100 percent accurate,"
said McDonald. "We don't rely on
this 100 percent ourselves. We
physically have people out there
checking creek levels." He also
noted that the c ity tracked numer
ous oilier llood (actors, including
ground saturation, forecasts, and
tides.
Ballard commented on the
powcr outages killing the commu
nity's commercial I Sl*, and ac
knowledged that the public could
lose access to the Web site during
the very storms they are attempt
ing to track.
However, he also stressed the
site was "just for information" and
upheld the need lor "common
sense" during storms, chastising
citizens who "become so depen
dent on it that they don't go outside
and check lor themselves when it's
raining." I lie site also was used in
conjunction with the automated
telephone messaging system, l elc
minder.

"We t hose an area thai could he
impacted hy vvhai (lie condition
was," said (aijalva. In this case,
they picked the area damaged dur
ing the 1998 Hoods and made
2,800 calls in two hours via l ele
ininder. ()nce conditions began to

consistently improve, the city
( eased the calls."lt starting getting
late, so we cut them oil'," said Mc-
I )onald.
"We were actually waking peo
ple up to tell them, T.verything's
okay, " said Clrijalva.

Despite the advance warning of
(lie Web site, McDonald, Clrijalva,
and Roberts all agreed that ii could
have done little to halt the $28 mil
lion damage of 1998.
"Only Moses could do that,"
said McDonald.

"This is not going to be an ab
solute predictor," said Palo Alto
Fire Chief Ruben Grijalva. "It
gives us an indicator to start notify
ing the community earlier in case
of flood conditions. It's a good tool
for the community to be looking
for conditions themselves from
their homes."
While such careful attention to
flood conditions may seem
overkill given California's reputa
tion for sunny weather, winter
flooding remains a constant prob-
lem in San Mateo and Santa (Mara
County.
After the February 1998 floods,
which caused $28 million in dam
age to Palo Alto, East Palo Alto, and
Menlo Park and shut down Stan
ford for a day, the Palo Alto Public
Works Department, with aid from
die Utilities and Information Tech
nology Departments, developed
and installed the site.
Ballard noted that, with the ex
ception of t he West Bayshore Road
monitoring system, compiling the
flow data has been "relatively inex
pensive" and "absorbed in the op
erating budget."
"I think that the value that it
brings to the city outweighs the
cost," said Ballard.
Residents, no doubt recalling
the 1998 damage to 1,700 area
homes, have Hocked to the new re
source.
"It's been tremendously suc
cessful and heavily utilized," said
Glenn Roberts, Palo Alto direc tor
of public works, who estimated the
site received "several thousand bits
per hour."
"I've been in discussion with
many residents," he said. "During
a storm, they'll log on and keep
track of it."
Grijalva agreed with the popu
larity of the resource. "It's one ol
our most actively hit sites. When it's
raining, we get thousands of hits."
Mick McDonald, Palo Alto Of
fice of Emergency Services manag
er, also spoke about the popularity
of the site. "It gives [residents] sort
of a yardstick on how high the
creek is at a given day. It gives them
a level of assurance. "
The site received a baptism ol
fire of sorts during the heavy
storms on February 13. During
heavy rains and rising creek vva

ters, Grijalva said the Web site al
lowed city officials to "compare
data with what we knew to be true
[of flood risks]" and reassure resi
dents the floodgates "didn't reach
half the volume that tliev did din
ing 1998."
Roberts said he believed the
February 13 storms were a good
test of the site, despite the populace
losing web access when the storm
killed power to the City of Palo
Alto's Internet service provider.
McDonald acknowledged that
"we're still in sort of an area of mas
saging our emergency plans a lit
tle." However, he stressed that < ity
ollicials never lost Internet capabil
ities.
I lie outage] never put us out
of commission," said McDon
ald."We had a direct link to our
utilities."
McDonald assured that losing
the site would not catch city de
partments unprepared during a
llood. "It is just a tool - not some
thing that is 100 percent accurate,"
said McDonald. "We don't rely on
this 100 percent ourselves. We
physically have people out there
checking creek levels." He also
noted that the c ity tracked numer
ous oilier llood (actors, including
ground saturation, forecasts, and
tides.
Ballard commented on the
powcr outages killing the commu
nity's commercial I Sl*, and ac
knowledged that the public could
lose access to the Web site during
the very storms they are attempt
ing to track.
However, he also stressed the
site was "just for information" and
upheld the need lor "common
sense" during storms, chastising
citizens who "become so depen
dent on it that they don't go outside
and check lor themselves when it's
raining." I lie site also was used in
conjunction with the automated
telephone messaging system, l elc
minder.

"We t hose an area thai could he
impacted hy vvhai (lie condition
was," said (aijalva. In this case,
they picked the area damaged dur
ing the 1998 Hoods and made
2,800 calls in two hours via l ele
ininder. ()nce conditions began to

consistently improve, the city
( eased the calls."lt starting getting
late, so we cut them oil'," said Mc-
I )onald.
"We were actually waking peo
ple up to tell them, T.verything's
okay, " said Clrijalva.

Despite the advance warning of
(lie Web site, McDonald, Clrijalva,
and Roberts all agreed that ii could
have done little to halt the $28 mil
lion damage of 1998.
"Only Moses could do that,"
said McDonald.
