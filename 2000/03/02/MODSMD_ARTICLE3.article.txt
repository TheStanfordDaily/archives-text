The days of town criers or
sirens rousing the population
from their beds and alerting them
of disaster are over in Santa Clara
County. True to its Silicon Valley
location, Palo Alto has dropped
these outmoded clarion calls in
favor ofan online flood water mon

The Web site, found at
hll p:/ / w w w.city.pal o
alto.ca. Us/early warning/creek
levels. Html, was developed by
John Ballard, Palo Alto Public

Currently, it contains a graphi

the Waverly Street and Chaucer

Creek level beneath West
Bayshore Road, and the Adobe-
Creek level under East Meadow
Drive.

of water in each creek for the last
12 hours and features a video feed
of the San Francisquito Creek at
the northbound Highway 101
bridge. All of the information is
updated every three minutes.

for conditions themselves from
their homes."
While such careful attention to
flood conditions may seem

tion for sunny weather, winter
flooding remains a constant prob-
