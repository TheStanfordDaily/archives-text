Rising subscription prices for academic jour
nals in recent years have forced Stanford Uni
versity Libraries to cut back on c ertain public a
tions and are pushing the library system toward
alternatives to print media.
The increases have been particularly high lot
journals in science, technology and medicine,
fields which rely heavily on the work published
in these journals to learn about new findings.
Even with a $5 million budget lor journals,
the increases have squeezed the library system.
Over (he last decade, journal prices liavO in
creased I)) more than 10 percent per year. In
some cases, the increases were as high as 25 per
cent per year.
The problem is mainly with commercial
publishers, rather than journals published by
professional societies, according to Assunta
I'isani, associate director of Collections Devel
opment for Stanford libraries.
Scholars send their papers to commercial
journals which often don't grant scholars any
rights regarding distribution to students. The
commercial publishers then charge libraries in
creasing prices for subscriptions, much of
which is not passed on to scholars.
It is "a vicious circle," according to I'isani.
Publishers c ite a number of reasons lor the
increased prices, from increasing I lie number
of pages per journal to increasing production
costs. The changing exchange rate ol the dollar
affects the cost of foreign and international
journals.
Librarians are not so sure. A faculty sub
committee ol the Academic Council Commit
tee of Libraries has formed to look into what
options Stanford libraries have as journal

priccs continue to rise.
()ne option that exists for libraries is increas
ing electronic access to journals. Stanford de
veloped I lighWire Press a number of years ago
to give students access to various journals over
die Internet.
The site, which is linked to the Stanford Li
brary home page, includes a number of jour
nals which Stanford has purchased online sub
scriptions to, as well as some which provide free
ac cess to back issues and some which are Sum
lord has access to for a trial period.
"I don't really care if they carry print copies,
as long as I'm able to get the information online,"
said junior Evan I lohlfield, a physics major.
Another option is document delivery, where
a student is able to locate and request specific
art it les on line, which the library will then order

and have sent to the school.
Some journals cost up to $20,000 per year to
subscribe to, and when higher priced subscrip
tions aren't frequently used, the library often
saves money by paying for individual articles.
However, online journals are not a 112 inal so
lution. A summary of the discussions held by
the committee, written by Electrical Engineer
ing Prof. Stephen Boyd, a committee member,
"archival permanence of scholarly work is
threatened by deterioration of storage media
and obsolescence of formats."
Pisani says the library considered canceling
all subscriptions from particularly high priced
publishers, but concern over the effect on stu
dents and faculty eliminated this option.
There is also a movement for scholars to
publish their work through professional society
journals rather than commercial publishers.
()nce scholars and libraries are able to work to
gether, Pisani says"the commercial publishers
are going to l>e on their knees."
Until then, Stanford libraries are trying to
cut costs in order to keep as many journals as
possible.
Last year, a group of science-related libraries
was given the job of cutting $200,000 worth of
titles through the elimination of duplication,
particularly in related fields such as biology and
medicine. Although students may have to look
for resources at different campus libraries,
most journals will continue to be available.
Decisions about which journals to cut and
which to keep are made with the help of spe
cialists who review the various journals, then
consult the faculty on which are most valuable
to the campus. The important thing, according
to Pisani, is to continue "to provide the students
and scholars at Stanford with the information
thev need."
