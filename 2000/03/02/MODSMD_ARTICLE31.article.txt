## A
						WEEKLY LOOK AT ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT AND STYLE AT STANFORD BATTLE of the BANDS Not your usual frat party? 
### SHIRLEY PALMA STAFF WRITER 
On March 4, some of you will witness
something like you've never seen
before. Some of you, on the other
hand, may have already weathered
four or more years worth of that kind of experi
ence. Either way, this Saturday, March 4, in Toyon
lounge, at 8 p.m. sharp, initiated and uninitiated
alike are invited to attend ... a frat party.
For 10 years, Phi Kappa Psi has been hosting its
most memorable party — Battle of the Bands.
What began as a Rush event in 1990 has remained,
turning into a major showcase for Stanford cam
pus bands. It's the best of its kind. Well, it's the only
one of its kind. And this year, it's sporting a glossy
new coat.
This year's Batde of the Bands will feature six
campus groups — Whoa Nelly!, Scott Hay &: Co.,
Hypnotix, The Grinning Idiqts, School of Ruckus
and Too Much Neon. You'll be treated to a 30 or
40 minute set from each band, but the night's not
all fim and games.
A panel of judges chosen from the
Department of Music and KZSU will evaluate the
groups' performances to determine the winners.
Prizes range from $200 gift certificates to a chance
to enter a nation-wide Battle of the Bands that may
lead to a performance at the Fillmore in San Fran
cisco. While the cash prizes alone should be enough
to draw the bands into competition this weekend,
the benefits reaped from Battle of the Bands reach
far, far beyond fame and fortune. (But, mostly, it's
for the fame. And fortune.)
While each group has different reasons for partic
ipating in Saturday's big event, for Phi Kappa Psi,
Batde of die Bands is both about promoting oil-cam
pus musical talent as well as promoting the fraterni
ty itself. It's an opportunity for the brothers to pre
sent Stanford's many groups together, where the
focus is on the bands themselves rather than the
bands just being background entertainment —
which is why the party didn't have much success in
its first incarnation as a rush event; people watched
the bands instead of talking to each other and get
ting to know each odier and about the fraternity.
Still, for a fraternity that's unhoused, Battle of the
Bands manages to be the Phi Kappa Psi's big 'house
party.'
Chris Montgomery, a sophomore Phi Psi and the
main coordinator of this year's Battle, not only gave
Intermission the run-down of specifics, but also
spoke extensively on the event's many qualities and
purposes.

It's been an important event to
support, not only for Phi Kappa Fsi,
but for the sake of campus music.
Even in 1993, when the fraternity
had a total of eight active brothers,
the show went on. And it's been a
favored source of good fun to all
sorts of Stanford community mem
bers — Montgomery said even the
cops joined in the party and danced
to the live music in Battle of the
Bands V.
This year's Battle of the Bands
may or may not have police involve
ment, but you can expect a night of
live music from some of Stanford's
own musical talent, and look for
ward to the fruits of 10 years' devel

opment. For example, for the first time, the Stanford
Conceit Network is co-sponsoring the event. Allen
Chen, Stanford Concert Network assistant direc tor
and general manager, is working along with Mont
gomery and Phi Psi to put on the most professional
Battle of the Bands yet.
The Stanford Concert Network often hosts live acts
on the Stanford campus, presenting music groups
like the Roots, Violent Fetlimes, and other perform
ers like David Spade. When John Cha of Too Much
Neon approached Chen about Battle of the Bands,
the concert network jumped at the chance to sup
port the event — it coincided both with the net
work's desire to start supporting on-campus talent
and with their recent acquisition of the funds to do
so.
The concert network's main role at this year's Bat
tle will be to provide production expertise and
equipment. In years past, the bands have provided
their own sound equipment of varying quality, but
this year the concert network will provide the stage,

lights and a professional PA system and soundboard.
Although the responsibilities are split between the
groups, Phi Psi and the concert network have forged
quite a partnership. From choosing the bands (from
amongst 14 entries this year) to determining the
stage setup, Phi Psi and the network are in this "bat
tle" together and are reaping the benefits of the joint
venture.
In the Battle of the Bands, the concert network
found a sure-fire way to demonstrate its new com
mitment to campus music with an event that has
become a tradition. And it's through SCN's contacts
with online music site iuma.com that the grand prize
winner will enter the nation-wide Battle of the
Bands, "Music O'Mania," for a chance to go on to
greater fame and compete for $10,000.
Expect the event to pack in (most of) a year's worth
of fraternizing and entertaining and have a unique
musical mission. It's rare for any party to pull off this
kind of feat. So grab a beer, stay a while and dream
about competing yourself some day.

The Grinning Idiots have been together as a
group since 1994, playing mostly dub shows in
San Francisco and the Peninsula. The type of

music the group puts out?
"It's a mix of groove laden rock, funky horn
licks, and jazzy textures. You know — Soul
Coughing meets the Beatles," said Scott Stan
ford, the Idiots' saxophonist.
This is the group's first Battle of the Bands,
and Stanford said they're excited to finally get a
chance to play in the competition.
"We've been wanting to play at the Battle
of the Bands for several years now, but we've
always had a scheduling conflict, usually involv
ing a haircut for our guitarist," he said. "It's
always exciting to play for the college crowd,
because today's students are tomorrow's unem
ployed alcoholics and smokers who pass out in
the clubs and pay our bills."
