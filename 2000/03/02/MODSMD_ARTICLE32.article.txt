# A 						haunting stable story told in all its glory
## 
### ZACH UDKO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Peter Shaffer's award-winning drama "Equus" holds its place today in tlie British dra
matic canon as "that psychological play with nudity." It should not surprise you that the
bulk of buzz this Stanford Drama Department production has been receiving revolves
around actors in the buff. Nor will this critic be the first ever to be a hit surprised by its fla
grant display of boob and balls. '
Audience members upon exiting the theater will either comment on the intensity of the
show or the bodies of its two exhibitionists. You will become a voyeur for an extended fif
teen minutes, plain and simple. And then, hopefully, you will get over it and move on, as
this critic is about to do. For to focus so much attention way down there completely miss
es the point, so to speak.
Beyond the states of dress and undress lies a production that is nothing less thfin a sheer
revelation. Graduate student Shawn Kairschner and a collection of 13 brilliant perform
ers have the ability to do what theater rarely can: keep an audience in awe lot over two
hours. This is what drama is all about. I bis is what Stanford Drama should continue to
strive for.
Keep in mind this talent is working with a masterpiece to begin with, unlike the ambi
tious performers who tackled Helene Cixous' troublesome "Portrait of Dora" last week.
Shaffer's wildly imaginative work takes us deep into the mind of Alan (played by David
Endelman), a troubled boy who has just blinded six horses with a hoof pick. Under the
guidance of his psychiatrist Dysart (Ellen Mease), Alan must come to terms with haunting
memories and inexplicable desires.
Note that Dysart, a role that has been played by Anthony Hopkins and Richard Bui -
ton, is now being portrayed by a woman. Mease, a visiting professor in the Department,
gives a whole new dimension to the complex part. Her sufferings as a wife stuck in a sex
less marriage seem to make all the more sense. Tension can also be increased between
Dysart and Alan with this alteration. The script has been touched up here and there to
accommodate Dysart's changed gender — quite admirable, 1 must say.
Mease tackles the role of Dysart with an enormous sense of control and fierce determi
nation. She is a tough cookie, to say the least. She is also fascinating to watch as an actress

at work. Endelman, too, churns out a finely detailed portrayal of the disturbed youth,
never for a moment straying from truthfulness. I lis role is by fat the play's most demand
ing, encapsulating Alan's life in a wide range of flashbacks, and Endelman

pulls it all off like a true virtuoso.

Also of note, Crystal Sholts serves up tawdry and provocative allure
as Alan's stable companion, Jill. Murphy Larson handles Alan's moth

er Dora with an enormous sense of
tenderness and sympathy.

✓ i /
Finally, here is a Dora whose
life we can understand.

Some will find discomfort
knowing that professors and older indi

viduals from outside the Stanford student body are
playing parts in a departmental production. But
one can hardly argue with the final product: who

prefers gray hair wigs to the real thing? If opening
up auditions to the outside community is what it takes

to achieve greatness, then by all means, charge on.
It's truly amazing what Stanford Drama can .

pull off once it has an absolutely thrilling
script on its hands. Kudos to all who made it
happen.
