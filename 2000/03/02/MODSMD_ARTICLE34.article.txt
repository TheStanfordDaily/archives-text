# Super-Baboons Escape Lab
## Brain-enhancement study halted when baboons make a break for car sale 
### 
"It doesn't take a genius to know
that the Corporate Motors Car Sale is
one smart way to buy a ear," says lab
technician Harry Yapc."The baboons
are undoubtedly getting pre-approved
ear loans from Stanford Federal Credit
Union then heading for the sale. We
feel we can intercept them along that
route."
Although the baboons have
received brain enhancement that
gives them intelligence equivalent to a
co-term KE, the lab reports that they
still drive like...well,...baboons.
It is speculated that the baboons
are hoping to blend with the crowd
expected at the Corporate Motors Car
Sale to be held Saturday, March 18th
from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. at 1500
Page Mill Road in Palo Alto. Because
most makes and models of cars will
be represented, lab officials disagree
on just what type of car, truck, van or
utility vehicle will be preferred by the
primates.
"They will go for luxuryâ€”maybe
a Lexus, Infmiti,"suggests Dr. Howell R.
Monkey.
"I'm guessing something more
sporty like a BMW or Honda "says Igor
Rilla.

"Don't forget, these arc super
baboons. I'd put my money on an
economy import or an SUV. contends
Harry Yape.
When pressed, the lab admits this
is not the first escape."lt's nothing to
be alarmed about, but there are prob
ably a few super-baboons living in the
dorms and attending classes right
now."
If anyone has information regard
ing the super-baboons, please contact
the closest authority figure.
