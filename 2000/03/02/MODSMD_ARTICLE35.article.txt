# Dreaded Lemon-Head Disease Spreading
## "We can prevent this proliferation" says SFCU 
### 
More and more consumers are
succumbing to the horrors of Lemon
llead Disease (MID), a condition
caused by the purchase of an ill-made
vehicle, or lemon. Lemons manifest in
high repair costs and recurrent prob
lems. A lemon can be a car that has
been in an undisclosed accident or
flood then "repaired" to appear in
good condition. Odometer tampering
is another way an unwary consumer
can end up with a lemon. Sadly, for
those already stricken with LHD, only
legal action can help. But for those in
the market for a quality used car,
prevention is just a few mouse-clicks
away at www.sfcu.org
In the "Deals on Wheels" section

of this informative site, consumers can
research the make and model of their
chosen cars by linking to buyer's
guides, Consumer Reports, and Car Fax
(a site that allows you to research VIN
numbers). Members of the Credit
Union can even apply for loans and
purchase cars online.

"We've got to stop this disease
before it gets out of hand. Information
is power and we'll bring that power
to the people!" was the emphatic
message of Warren Marshall, CEO of
SFCIJ in an emotional press confer
ence recently.
We urge our readers to take an
active roll in the prevention of Lemon-
Head Disease.
