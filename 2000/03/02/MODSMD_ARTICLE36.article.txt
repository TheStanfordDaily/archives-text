## METALLICA 'S and M' 
### SOREN JOHNSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Ever since white people
started taking rock n' roll seri
ously, numerous attempts
have been made to mix classi
cal and rock music. In the
'70s, prog-rock bands such as
Yes, Jethro Tull and ELP
mixed popular symphonic
ph rases into their music, cre
ating some historically awful
music. Then, as "classic rock"
became a reality, otherwise
intelligent orchestras like the
London Symphony wasted
their talents on symphonic
versions of Pink Floyd, Led
Zeppelin and other rock
groups.
Metallica now brings this
misguided dream to a new
generation with a live record
ing of a concert performed
with the San Francisco Sym
phony, conducted by Michael
Kamen. Although this project
will undoubtedly "shock"
Metallica's hard-core fans, the
band clearly fits into the tradi
tion of symphonic rock. They
make bombastic, pretentious
music, they take themselves
very seriously and they are
very, very white.
Nonetheless, this two-disc
set, entitled "S & M," is not as
bad as one might expect.
Kaman's arrangements make
the SFS sound like a good
soundtrack orchestra, and the
orchestra is mixed high
enough to be audible over
Metallica's rumble. Further,
the symphony adds a certain
level of majesty which Metalli
ca had never been able to
achieve with just a four-piece
band.
This cohesion is most
notable on Metallica's more

recent compositions, such as
"Bleeding Me" and "Outlaw
Torn." The highlight of the
concert is "No Leaf Clover," a
previously unreleased song
which presumably was writ
ten with the orchestra in
mind. Some nice wind pas
sages, sensitive pizzicato work
and actually soulful singing
produce a surprisingly tran
scendent moment.
Unfortunately, at least half
of the songs are from Metalli
ca's earlier, wooden age â€”
when the group had little
rock and absolutely no roll.
"Master of Puppets," "For
Whom The Bell Tolls" and
"Sad But True" trudge along
without any sense of humani
ty whatsoever. While this
dime-store nihilism may have
carried Metallica to fame, the
group betrays its true poten
tial by continuing to sell the
lie that hard-core metal mat
ters.
Though "S & M" is certain
ly not the embarrassment it
could have been, the album
suffers from the inclusion of
the group's stilted begin
nings. Of course, the inclu
sion of Metallica's earlier
works was likely meant to
appease the band's audience,
most of whom have probably
never heard a major sympho
ny orchestra in concert
before. Unfortunately, the
decision prevents those of us
who dislike bad music from
enjoying all of this album.
