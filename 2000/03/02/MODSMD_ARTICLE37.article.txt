# Vertical Horizon's latest isn't 'Everything You Want'
## 
### RENEE CANADA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When I slipped Vertical Horizon's
first major label album, "Everything
You Want," into the CD player, 1
thought I had accidentally hit the
stereo switch to radio. Kicking off
with the infectious rock anthem, "We
Are," each song sounds as it it has
been taken straight from the factory
of radio-friendly hits. While I
couldn't help bopping my head along
to the catchy tunes, it was still difficult
to tell the difference between this
band and the next on the Top 40
Rock charts.
Though the successful formula of
simple chords and driving rhythms
doesn't allow for abundant originali
ty, it certainly bodes well for the
band's market appeal. Sounding like
a mix between Counting Crows and
REM, it's no surprise that Vertical
Horizon's latest album has broken
into the charts, with their hit single,
"Everything You Want" recently
entering the Billboard Top 40. With
a strong acoustic feel overlapped by
reverb-ing guitar and impassioned

vocals, this hit also has made it's way
into the television show circuit, where
it helps advertise "The Practice" and
will accompany episodes of the sc i-li
drama "Roswell" and "Third Watch."
"Everything You Want" is an
impressive major label debut for the
New England-based quartet. First
formed in 1991, Vertical Horizon
originally began as an acoustic duo of
vocalist / guitarists Keith Kane and
Matt Scanned. With the addition of
drums and bass, the band gained an
impressive grassroots following as it
supported three independently
released albums with energetic live
shows. In their latest album, the
acoustic-based group brings a
moody, introspective feel to "Every
thing You Want."
Though the band is obviously com
prised of skilled musicians, Vertical
Horizon explores territory that has
already been conquered several times
over, leaving them with a generic
sound. Where they do shine best,
however, is in the heavily rhythmic
songs like "You're a God," with its
driving, almost annoying catchy cho
rus. "All of You" warrants attention

with lyrical verses of unusual chord
progression, sliding into a heavily
rocking chorus. "Everything You
Want" and "Shackled" have the most
poignant lyrics, revealing the acous
tic, introspective roots <>1 the group.
Though "Everything You Want"
has been receiving the most acclaim,
"We Are" is definitely the best song of
the album with its anthem-like cho
rus and hard-edged electric sound.
Unfortunately, many of the other
songs on this album lack the energy
that captures Vertical Horizon at its
best, sinking into forgettable, moody
tunes.
For those of you unwilling to fork
over the $12 to check out this album,
turn on the radio to a Top 40 rock
station. Even if it's not Vertical Hori
zon you hear over the airwaves, you'll
be hard pressed to know the differ
ence.
