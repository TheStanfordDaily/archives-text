# The 						organ steps up to the fore
## 
### STEVEN RAPHAEL SENIOR MUSIC CRITIC 
The Hammond B3 organ is a relatively new
instrument, having only been invented in 1935.
Yet, in the 65 years since then, it has quickly
become a widespread force, penetrating into
the heart of nearly every genre of music,
including jazz, funk, R&B, pop, and gospel.
The most prominent role for the organ has
been in the world of jazz, where musicians have
used it to push the boundaries of the genre.
Jazz organists, who often play bass simultane
ously with their left hand, forced jazz into funk
and soul territory long before Miles Davis shat
tered the distinctions with his landmark fusion
album "Bitches Brew." [[[possessive?]]]
The most recent compilation dedicated to the
powerful instrument is "Organ-ized: An All-
Star Tribute to the Hammond B3 Organ." In a
unique twist, each of the songs on the album
was recorded specifically for it, as opposed to
the standard compilation of previously record
ed tracks. Songs by legends like Jimmy Smith,
who was instrumental in defining the role of
the organ, are side by side with songs by
younger players like John Medeski, a key fig
ure in the adaptation of the organ to modern

times.
There is an abundance of good music on the
album. Starting with a bang, Joey
DeFrancesco's "Ashley Blue" is a solid jazz
number. Medeski's "Swamp Road" finds him
paired with DJ Logic in the most daring and
eclectic attempt on the album. The song is a
hot, funky sizzler, yet Medeski seems to be
overshadowed by the turntable rhythm section.
Art Neville turns in a swampy New Orleans
inspired song that's simply fun. The smooth
organ weaves its way though the jumpy beat
and heavily syncopated guitar, producing an
undeniable groove. Reuben Wilson's "Yes Sir,"
is catchy and upbeat, showing why this acid jazz
pioneer has been so heavily sampled by hip
hop groups.
Yet, not all of the album is as inspired.
Tommy Eyre's cover of the Chuck Berry song,
"I've Got To Find My Baby" is a generic boring
blues. Eyre's standard-issue blues licks add
nothing to the plodding beat. Jack McDufFs
tone on "Misty" sounds identical to old-fash
ioned ice skating music. Although McDuff has
long proven himself to be a master of the
organ, his skill is irrelevant when a listener
can't hear the music over his own laughter.
Ironically, the makers of "Organ-ized" were

never able to get com
pletely organized
themselves. The liner
notes seem undecided
as to whether the com
pilation is a tribute to
jazz organists or to the
diversity of the organ.
They try to resolve this
with a reference to the
"jazz style" of organ
playing, iu which
organists use Fender
bass tone to play bass
with their left hand.

Yet, many of the
organists featured on the album are not doing
this, working with electric bass players instead.
It's difficult to know for sure which organists
are playing with electric bass players because
"Organ-ized" completely omits reference to
many supporting musicians. Credit is given in
an almost random fashion, with some tracks
that feature organ, bass, drums, guitar, and
horns being credited all to one organ player.
Although it pays homage to many great
organists, "Organ-ized" is only a decent album.
If the makers of this album had only been a In

Me more organized themselves, they might
have made something great.
