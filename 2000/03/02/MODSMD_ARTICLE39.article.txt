# Sport meets spirit in 'Cup'

"How's a young monk meant to keep
his mind on his studies when Ronaldo's
playing for Brazil? reads (he publicity for
Khyentse Norbu's directorial debut, "The
Cup.
The film, which recounts the story of a
Tibetan monastery that becomes captivat
ed by the 1998 World Cup soccer champi
onships, explores the ancient traditions
and identity of exiled Tibetan monks with
witty insights into their role as followers o(
an ancient religion in a modern world.
Inspired by true events, the story fol
lows two young Tibetan boys, Palden and
Nylma, escaping Tibet and arriving at a
Tibetan monastery-in-exile in the
Himalayas. The boys are thrown into a
whirlwind of unexpected events not usual
ly associated with the austere atmosphere
of a traditional Tibetan monastery, all
focused on the World Cup finals. Among
the traditional monastic duties, the audi
ence catches glimpses of monks' loyalties
to various teams, as they bet on games dur
ing meals and sport homemade jerseys
under their robes.
Palden's roommate Orygen and his
sidekick Lodo involve the new monks in a
midnight outing to see a World Cup semi
final match, thus beginning the excite
ment leading to the final game. Orygen, in
a last attempt to fulfill his long-lasting wish
to see the World Cup Final, suggests to
Geko, the monastery's disciplinarian, that
the game be shown in the monastery itself.
To everyone's surprise, Geko gives per
mission, setting off a hilarious series of
events to prepare the monastery for the

transmission of the match. Orygen and
Lodo use every spare moment to get a
satellite dish and an old television set to the
Monastery, in time for a showing of the
final game.
Director Norbu's background adds to
the authenticity, for he is one of the most
important lamas in the Tibetan Buddhist
tradition today. He has had rigorous train
ing in classical Buddhism. Norbu explains
the connection saying, "Making a good
film, I suppose, is a bit like doing good
Buddhist practice. It all begins with an
awareness of how we're conditioned."
"The Cup" is the first feature-length
movie made in Bhutan; the film was shot
primarily at Chokling Monastery to
ensure authenticity. Likewise, the cast of
the film was mainly drawn from members
of the monastery, none of whom had any
acting experience — a daunting task for
the director, which he carries off extraor
dinarily well. Norbu captures the essence
of youthful idolization and rebellious ten
dencies in his treatment of Orygen, the 14-
year-old soccer-obsessed monk.
Director Norbu remarks, "Everyone
thinks monks are pious and disciplined.
But they forget that monks are human
too." "The Cup" affords the audience an
insider's l<x>k at much of Tibetan culture
and society as it faces the challenges of a
modern world. The film tells a charming
storv 112 ull of wisdom and humor.
