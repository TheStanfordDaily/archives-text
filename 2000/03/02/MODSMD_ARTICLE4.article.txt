## 
### DENNIS TYLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
University President Gerhard Casper and
ASSU President Mike Levin addressed a
joint meeting of the ASM Undergraduate
Senate and the Graduate Student Council
on Tuesday night.
Casper came to answer questions in an in
formal discussion with student legislators.
Students asked about issues such as the Uni
versity's duty to support performing arts and
provide graduate student housing.
Casper said that the survival of the arts is
more of a society issue rather than a Stanford
issue.
He said that "one of the biggest projects
that Stanford has ever done was the building
of the Museum of Art. And yet I hardly ever
see a student there."
Casper also said that everything is being
done to meet the demand for graduate stu
dent housing.
"We have no plans to decrease our sub-

sidy for graduate student
funding; in fact, we are in
creasing it,"he said. "We
have spent $3.2 million
this year on graduate
housing, and next year we
plan to increase that
amount to $5 million."
()ne senator asked why
Stanford's tuition is in-

creasing (i percent, since
the value of the Stanford endowment in
creased by 34 percent last year and the aver
age increase in tuiton was 2.5 percent.
"You cannot look, at the performance of
the University from one year to the next be
cause- the numbers always fluctuated," said
Casper.
"My greatest disappointment as president
is that I have not been able to convince facul
ty, administrators and students that Stanford
is not the wealthiest institution," he said.
"Overall endowment has been very unim
pressive."

Casper said that he hopes that Stanford
will put mote emphasis on advising in the fu
ture, especially in departments.
"M\ second major disappointment is that
we are still under-administrating our de
partments," he said.
I lesaid he feels students should be able to
walk into a department and have someone
there who can reaclih answer an\ ol their
questions.
Another student asked how lie felt about
student efforts to add a student representa
tive to the Board of I rustees. Casper said he
was skeptical about the idea for a number of
reasons.
"The president needs a space where he
can vent his feelings and not be quoted on
everything that lie says," Casper said.
" I hereiore, he will not have to feel as if lie
has to watch what he says because I do
enough of that. The one place where that
happens is at the Board ol Trustees."
He also said that board meetings are con
fidential, so a student would not be able to

talk about anything that is said in the meet
ings.
"Therefore, I don't see how having a stu
dent there can help," he said.
After Casper departed. Levin delivered
his State of the ASSI address in which here
tapped the successes that the ASSI has had
this year.
"It is my firm belief that we are serving the
undergraduates and graduates very well,"
said 1 .evin, as students applauded.
After discussing the success ol the Stan
lord After Midnight program, Levin stated
that the results for the Campus Safety and
Lighting Survey have been received.
I lie ASSI Commission ofC '.ampus Safety
is asking that the I niversity improve lighting
at Lake Lagunita. Junipero Sen a Boulevard
between Campus Drive Last and Campus
Drive West and Lasuen Street between Cam
pus Di ive and Arboretum Road.
According to Levin, this surve) signifies
the "power of the student voice in making
sound Universitv decisions."
