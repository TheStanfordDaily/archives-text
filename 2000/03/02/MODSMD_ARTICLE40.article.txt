# '4 Hands' not enough to save this show

### ZACH UDKO EDITORIAL STAFF 
If practice makes perfect, then what does too
much practice make?
American Conservatory Theatre's sparse
mounting of Ted Dykstra and Richard Green
blatt's autobiographical show "2 Pianos, A
Hands" just might be the answer: 90 minutes of
cutesy comedy and forced drama that lias about
as much freshness as a can of sardines.
This decent show lias been bumming around
the States and Canada for about four years now.
But with jokes stemming from playing the
"Cheers" theme, it feels like it'sl>een a helluva lot
longer.
In addition, the Canadians Cregory Charles
and Jean Marchand, who have been portraying
the authors Dykstra and (ireenblatt for a couple
of years, seem to Ix- running through their dia
logue like player pianos. The entire evening
exudes an unfortunate sense of staleness.
The play also fails to ever strike any real emo
tional chords. The script is Ix-yond self-serving,
following the trials and tribulations of Dykstra
and (ireenblatt as they attempt to gain stardom
as concert pianists, flaying more than 20 roles,
Charles and Marchand take us from childhood
piano lessons, to conservatory training, to the
moments they realized they didn't have what it
takes and finally to where they are today.
There's nothing really new here, and we've
heard most of these jokes before. Annoying par
ents. Sketchy piano teachers. Catholic school
training. Stereotypical jazz musicians. You name
the cliche, Dykstra and (ireenblatt have it.
In the end, we learn about human limitations
and the importance of staying true to yourself.

All this in a brightly-colored package that might make Hallmark
jealous.
Ultimately, these fallible characters are caricatures, and because
of their flat portrayals, we hardly care about either of them. This is
especially unfortunate since the play is supposedly based on the
real adventures of the authors.
Charles has more of a range when it comes to his ability to por
tray a wide variety of characters — both male and female. Marc
hand's French accent can sometimes be a bit distrac ting, especially
when he plays American roles. And though the two have several
fine moments on the stage, all in all, they seem to just be stuck in
an over-rehearsed duet.
Music is the third character in the play, and perhaps its most
important. Vivid selections ranging from Beethoven and Bach to
Billy Joel and Rodgers and Hart light up the stage with energy.
Both Charles and Marchand are undeniably sensational pianists.
Dykstra's direction is fast-paced and a real winning quality of the
night. Scenes run into each other with admirable fluidity, even il

they sometimes don't belong in the same play.
For the loyal music lover, "2 Pianos, 4 Hands" could certainly
oiler a satisfying evening at the theater. For the rest of us who
could never quite curve our lingers and lower our wrists at the
exact angle, it might all seem like a lame excuse to play a bunch of
Mozart and (Chopin.
These two guys have the bare bones of a decent play here with
some fine musical moments. It's a shame they had to rely on such
hackneyed conventions to tell their story.
