# Nightmare for Christmas
## 
### LAUREN RUSSELL EDITORIAL STAFF 
"Reindeer Games" is one of those films
that frustrates the hell out of reviewers
because it is so exciting and yet difficult to
talk about without revealing everything.
There are very lew things I can say
about the amazingly twisted plot because
talking about the coolest part of the film
would completely give the story away.
Director John Frankenheimer, who we
last heard from when he directed
"Ronin" in 1998 and when he played
General Sonnenberg in " The General's
Daughter," shows us once again that he is
a king in the world of action flicks, craft
ing a film that brilliantly pulls the audi
ence into the drama.
Ben Affleck plays Rudy, a recently
released prisoner whose best friend in jail
— Nick — leaves him quite an inheritance
when he gets out. Ashley, played by Ghar
li/.e Theron, is the girl next door who has
been writing to Nick as his pen-pal girl
friend. waiting for him to be paroled so
they could finally be together. Ashley has
never seen a photo of Nick, so when Nick
is killed in a prison light, Rudy decides to
change his identity for a little while so he
( an cash in on Ashley's delectable goods.

While it is hard to believe that a
woman as beautiful as Charlize Theron
would be writing passionate letters to an
inmate she has never met, its easy to for
get this and become tied up in the plot
knots Rudy finds himself in.
When Ashley's brother Gabriel (Gary
Sinise) shows up and turns out to be a
violent criminal who wants Rudy to pull
off a major casino heist with him, Rudy's
dreams of coining home for Ghristmas
turn into a nightmare. All he wants is a
big cup of hot chocolate and a warm
bed, but Rudy ends up covered in blood
and surrounded by enough plot twists
and turns to make a merry-go-round
dizzy.
1 am definitely not the queen of action
flicks, but "Reindeer Games" took me for
a ride that was enjoyable and surprising.
It had its fair share of gore (a sad group
of men in Santa suits with their heads
blown oil and insides hanging out, for
example), but relied more 011 substance
than blood to keep the audience engaged.
And "Reindeer Games" also delivered
impressive acting performances from
Theron, Affleck, and Sinise.
There were a few times where it
became obvious that "Reindeer Games"
was contrived. It lias some predictable

qualities, which is why I didn't walk away
completely blown away. The whole rela
tionship between Theron and Affleck has
no chemistry whatsoever, and it is difficult
to believe that Rudy is in love with Ashley
enough to risk his life at times.
If you are in the mood for an Oscar
worthy, intellectual film, skip "Reindeer
Games." It doesn't deliver much for the
heart — or for the mind, for that matter.
See it, but only if you are thirsting for a
break for your brain (which, in my opin
ion, we all could use around here at
times).
