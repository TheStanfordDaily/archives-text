# SCBN sketch comedy a sure-fire hit

"The Oval" is quickly
becoming a Stanford tradition.
Unlike The Treehouse.
1 suggest you start drinking
alter dinner tomorrow night—
possibly around nine o'clock
Pacific Standard Time, when a
new episode of SCBN's sketch
comedy show airs. You'll only
enjoy the crazy antics more if
you're a teensy bit loaded.
Personally, I wonder if these
guys are loaded when they per
form. They're just so.. .kooky.
Naw, I'd have to say they're
probably just chunk off life.
Not all the sketches are
funny — hey, even in its hey
day, Saturday Night Live had

troubles filling the whole show.
That's just how sketch comedy
works. But at least when they
go bad at "The Oval" it's just
weird enough to make you gig
gle anyway.
The four-year-old show
used to be live, back in the day,
and there are rumors that
there may be another live one
this year. But, in general, "The
Oval" has made the shift from
live to edited seamlessly. Ritik
Dholakia and John YVayland
pioneered the switch and do
most of the editing, and do it
well. I, in fact, prefer the new
format, as the ability to cut has
added new dimensions to the
humor.
One of their recent skits, in
which Ritik eats cereal with

"arsenic milk," is made by their
ability to insert and switch
angles. Fooling with time per
spective can be hilarious,
believe me.
I'he show also does a good
job of including different types
of humor. The cast itself is a
cornucopia of talent, from Ritik
and John delivering deadly
deadpan lines, to Art Schram's
glib and overdone style. Jeevan
Kalanithi is absolutely hilarious
in a yodeling sketch, and can
be counted on when slapstick is
needed. Matt Flannery does
the slightly-dumb, more-than
slighdy-male thing well (high
lighted in a piece in which he
pieces together a German Ass
puzzle).
An aspect of the show that I

found surprisingly endearing
was its Stanford-ness, or maybe
just it's college-ness. I'm not
bursting with Cardinal pride
by any account, but a sketch
about a slutty Stanford Dude
waking up in assorted beds
talks to me somehow. Especial
ly when that Dude is Clark
Durant, and those assorted
beds are along El Camino
Real.
Are you really going to be
doing anything at 9 p.m.
tomorrow night, anyway? It's
t(x> late to be working on a
weekend, and the parties won't
be going yet. Don't fool your
self. No one will lx- there until
at least ten. So kick back and
turn on SCBN for a couple of
laughs.
