# 'Best Thing' lacking

### JOSH CHAO ART DIAZ 
Apparently, a yoga instructor can make
a sizeable salary in Los Angeles, and
apparently a gay man can have a domesti
cated lxjring lamily life with his best
friend. But when that gay man and best
friend are played by Rupert Everett and
Madonna, that relationship can take on
the proportions of a Hollywood movie.
"The Next Best Tiling" is at times con
trived, over-produced, and melodramat
ic. No doubt it would have been a
straight-to-video movie if not for the star
power of Madonna and Everett's acting
ability.
"The Next Best Thing" chronicles the
relationship of Abbie and Robert (played
by Madonna and Everett respectively) and
the drama resulting from a one night
stand which produces Sam, their child.
Difficulties arise in their yuppie familial
bliss when Ben (Benjamin Bratt), a New
York investment banker, takes a romantic
interest in Abbie.
Robert's role as father then is placed
into question as the romance leads the
three into a dramatic courtroom battle.
The movie focuses heavily on gay issues.
Unfortunately, the issues involved are
politicized, which compromises the gen
uine nature of the story, (iay parenting
becomes an advocacy point, and the advo
cacy becomes so transparent that it almost
the feeling of a public service announce

ment paid for by the Human Rights Cam
paign. This isn't necessarily a bad thing,
mind you, but not the sort of material that
makes a great movie.
Visually, however, the movie is stun
ning. Actually, Madonna and Everett are
stunning. They fulfill their roles as eye
candy, and luckily for Madonna her
screen time decreases in the most dramat
ic moments, allowing us to appreciate her
for what she has to offer. Not her acting
ability, but rather her beauty and pres
ence. It's hard, though, to separate
Madonna from Madonna. The cultural
icon is inseparable from the actress, and
her performance as just another lovesick
Angelino is hard to swallow.
In fact it does seem that the actors are a
bit typecast. Madonna plays a yoga
obsessed single mother, while Everett
plays the gay man every woman desires as
a best friend. Needless to say, the roles
aren't much of a stretch for either actor.
Unfortunately, "My Best Friend's Wed
ding" is a much better movie. Compar
isons are inevitable, and to the dismay of
Madonna fans it seems that Julia Roberts
plays a much better gay man's best friend.
At least on the screen, anyway.
Despite the inherent flaws, the movie
has its en joyable and
sentimental moments. Madonna is her
best when she is herself, and Everett is
charming. If anything, the inovie is a great
date movie — it shows that even Madonna
and Everett, witty and attractive as they
are, can have a much more boring rela
tionship than most.
