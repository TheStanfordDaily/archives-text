# Exhibit is about the 'art of ideas'

It was a white frame, some cubes, pieced together, and in
spite of its imposing height of over eight feet, I barely
glanced at the sculpture as I passed by. In fact, I didn't even
realize it was the opening exhibit to a phenomenal display of
artwork. Moments later, I found myself in front of the sculp
ture again. This time however, I stood in amazement. How
could 1 possibly have passed it by with so little thought?
The first wall of the gallery is completely covered with
sketches dedicated to this "Four Part Modular Cube." Some
are done in ink, some stenciled, some on graphing paper and
others scribbled across sheets of yellow notebook pages.
Each piece of the cube is explored and the lines needed to
create the whole become more detailed. From those original
sketches refined pages of planning appear, complete with
measurements. And the result of this painstaking work is so
simple, so pure, that the unconscious viewer never realizes
the effort underlying each creation.
Sol LeWitt is a master of challenging the human mind to
see the power, complexity and beauty inherent in simplicity.
Beginning in the 19605, LeWitt became one of the key fig
ures behind Conceptualism, a movement interested in "cre
ating artworks that focused on ideas rather than on highly
crafted objects." For LeWitt, conceptualism "means that all
of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the
execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a
machine that makes the art."
This is why most of the displays in the exhibit were accom
panied with sketches and planning; in fact, some of the gal
leries themselves seemed like giant sketchpads. LeWitt cov
ers an entire BxB meter wall with scribbles. Imagine the
notepad you might have next to your telephone, but upon
this notepad, the chaos has created an amazingly complex
and stunning pattern. Each wall explores new patterns:
straight lines, concentric spheres, un-connected crooked
lines and un-connected straight lines. Attention is paid to
the strength of each line and the variations are astounding,
especially considering the tool being used is always a thin
pen or pencil.
Moving up to the second floor of the exhibit, the focus
turns from process to complete creations. LeWitt boldly cov
ers the giant walls with fantastic shapes and colors. Within
these candy-land galleries, the viewer shrinks and become
child-like, disappearing among the octagons, triangles, pyra
mids, stars and staircases. The sculpture that appears either
emphasizes the enormity of the figures on the surrounding
walls, or sucks the observer in and forces them interact; in
one piece, the viewer must make use of both hands and eyes
to guide themselves through a black Styrofoam corridor.
The exhibit covers four decades of LeWitt's work, from the
60s through the present. Because it is so extensive, make
sure to give yourself ample time and try to avoid crowds. It
will be running through May 21 and LeWitt himself will be
lecturing on February 25th. Other classes and lecture times
can be found on-line at http://www.sfmoma.org Sol LeWitt:
A Retrospective is a definite must see for anyone headed up
to the city this spring.
