# O'Keefe's art of things majestic and minute

Poppies were the first thing that came to mind
when I saw the advertisement for the new Geor
gia O'Keeffe exhibit currently being displayed in
the California Palace of the Legion of Honor.
O'Keefe is well known for her floral paintings;
pictures where the flowers leap out from the
canvas, huge and brilliantly colored.
However, The Poetry of Things is an exhibit
that not only does justice to her most popular
works, but walks the viewer through a gallery
that spans the artist's entire lifetime; a life, in
which flowers were merely one of many steps
towards greatness.
The exhibit explores two phases of O'Keeffe's
work: landscapes and things. Her "things" peri
od refers to her most recognized phase, and the
first gallery of the exhibit is dedicated to these
mostly "organic" works. The central exhibit of
the room begins with a painting called the "D.H.
Tree."
This painting, done in 1928 during one of her
first stays in New Mexico, depicts a tree from the
perspective of a person lying on their back and
looking up, through the branches into the night

sky. The colors are bright, almost child-like, and
it is easy to mistake the trunk for a root and the
black leaves for soil. Without the caption, the
viewer would not necessarily know they were
looking at a tree.
This is all part of O'Keeffe's magic. Her goal
was to play with the viewer's understanding of
microcosm and macrocosm. Size and direction
were all relative. The rest of the wall depicts the
leaves of the tree. All painted on canvases of the
same size, the leaves are enormous, like her
flowers, and the viewer is forced to see the deli
cate intricacies of each vein, curve and shading
difference.
Asked once why she made her flowers so large,
O'Keeffe answered, "Well, why don't you ask me
why I make my rivers so small?" As the viewer
passes from her enormous leaves into the next
gallery to see her petunias, cannas and jack-in
the-pulpits, the urge to observe the details only
increases.
O'Keeffe wanted people to see the beauty she
saw and felt that the only way she could was to
make the beautiful enormous so the observer
couldn't possibly ignore it. In the case of the
jack-in-the-pulpits, her focus on the 'pulpit' of
the flower resulted in a rush of sexual interpre-

tations. O'Keefle found these interpre
tations absurd and offensive. Her goal
was merely to paint whatever was
"most interesting."
After the death of her mentor Alfred
Stieglitz, O'Keelfe moved to New Mex
ico, a state that she had often visited.
Her paintings became more surreal as
she moved into this "landscape" phase.
Many of the works depict bones,
which O'Keefle saw as a symbol of life
rather than death. Her paintings com
bine the curves and bleached white
ness of the bones with colorful back
grounds of mountains and flowers.
Especially impressive is one of the rare
examples of her sculpture work that
sits in the center of the third room. In
her later life, as her eyesight failed,
O'Keefle enjoyed being able to mold
and create loveliness out of space.
The chronological progression of this
exhibit leaves the viewer with a much

broader understanding of O'Keeffe's growth as
an artist, and the small size of the gallery allows
plenty of time to fully appreciate each work. It
will be running through May 14. To get the most

out of the exhibit, pick up the slightly cheesy, hut
informative, headset. For more information,
