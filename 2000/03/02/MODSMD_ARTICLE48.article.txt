# Redemption in a bottle

### Gil Lopez 
This week, we trekked into the
heart of The City to search out a
bar in which to spend a relaxing
Saturday evening. Yes, San Fran
cisco's a real town that kind of
legitimizes going to school in Palo
Alto in much the same way that
Michael Corleone's leadership
legitimized not whacking Fredo
much sooner.
But anyway, what we found
was the Gold Dust Lounge. Yes,
the name is reminiscent of one of
the old-time theme restaurants
that they have at Disneyland.
Turns out, so was the rest of the
bar.
The lounge has a theater-like
appearance 011 the outside, and
seeing as it's located near the part
of town I don't want to be in at
night, I was expecting that it
might be a little seedy. What's
inside is a pleasant surprise.
Ihe establishment is pretty
small — 30 or so people and the
place starts to get crowded — but
that plays well into the bar's com
fortable atmosphere.
You walk in and you realize
you're not in a bar or a pub or a
club. It's more like you happened
to find a small-city dive in the
middle of San Francisco.
I he nicest feature of the place
is that virtually all the wall space is
covered with plush, couch-type
seating. Wood-paneled walls gave
the place a Western saloon feel,
only in a much smaller area.
How small? Let's put it this
way: There is actually a type of
mini-bar seating around whatever
jazz band happens to be playing
that night. The drummer we saw
was so cramped that he kind of
had his arms tucked in, making
him look like some feeble-limbed
dinosaur. But hey, floor space is a
high commodity in the Bay Area,
and anyone who's ever been to

Left At Albuquerque on a busy
night should appreciate the cre
ative use of space.
I he average patrons were in
their late 2()s to late 30s, but
everyone is extremely friendly.
It's a fun place to spend a night
and strike up a conversation with
someone you've never met and
will probably never see again.
I he only hitch — at least on
this night — was the jazz. I he fea
tured performers this evening
were a bassist and drummer, but
they were pretty much the last
thing you'd expect if you were
going to see a jazz band.
They were elderly white men,
and they bore a striking resem
blance to those two old Muppets
that sit in the theater balcony and
heckle Kermit and company.
Their music was heavily tinged
with Dixieland and some blue
grass flavor, not exactly what I
was expecting going in.
But in the end, the type of
music didn't matter. The impor
tant part was that the band was
fun, and knew how to involve the
crowd. And in a place as small as
the Gold Dust Lounge, that can
make the difference between hav
ing fun with everyone in a crowd
ed room and just hunching over
your drinks with your friends.
So if you're in the City and
don't want the noisy, impersonal
touch of a big club or bar, check
out the Gold Dust Lounge. And
try their Irish Coffee. Oh — men
tion this column and they'll just
give you a confused look.
