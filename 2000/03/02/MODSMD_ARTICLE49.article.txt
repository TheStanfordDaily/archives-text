# Just an alien lookin' for love
## 
### FREDERICK VALLAEYS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Imagine what would happen if the
main reason why men entered relation
ships was sex. That's exactly the premise

behind Mike Nichols' latest film "What
Planet Are You From?" While pretty

much any movie today deals with the
concept of men trying to get into a

woman's pants to some degree, this
movie is different. It explores what

happens when the man and the
woman truly are from different

planets — and those planets are
not Venus and Mars.

In an opening title sequence
reminiscent of "Star Wars," we

learn that Harold (played by
Gary Shandling) comes from a
planet three solar systems away

from Earth. Graydon (Ben
Kingsley), the leader of this
highly evolved planet, has plans

o / I 1
to conquer the universe by sending Harold to impreg
nate an earth woman so that they can start colonization
from within.
In one of the funniest scenes of the film, Harold,
whose species has 110 emotions and 110 reproductive
organs (they are all cloned) is trained 011 how to deal

with Earth women. Naturally, his training talis short of
conveying the subtleties of what makes humans tic k.
It doesn't take Harold long to figure out that travel
ing hallway across the universe was the easy part of his
mission. After complimenting any woman lie encoun
ters 011 her hair, shoes, and scent, lie has 110 qualms
about indicating that lie is ready to have sex 011 the spot,
resulting in quite a few slaps across the face. Another
problem that Harold faces is the fact that his prosthetic
penis makes a mechanical humming sound when lie is

aroused. I he more aroused he gets, the faster it hums.
One of Harold's dates suggests that maybe it hums
because it doesn't know the words. While this humming
gag was used throughout the movie, it did not get old.
Some enjoyable tangents to the story of Harold's
quest to have a baby involve a FAA inspector, Roland
(John Goodman), who is onto the

fact that Harold isn't human.
Because everybody thinks he is
crazy, he is set on obtaining proof
that an alien has made contact.

' Then there are the developments
at Harold's job where he befriends
Perry (Greg Kinnear), a horny man

" with no morals. Thanks to Perry,
Harold meets Susan (Annette Ben
ing), a recovering alcoholic, who

appears to be Harold's best shot at
scoring and completing his mission.
The characters in "What Planet Are

r You From" are portrayed in appropri
ately stereotypical ways by the cast. Ben
ing, who was nominated for an Oscar for

her role as the mother in the dysfunction
al family in "American Beauty," once again

does a wonderful job portraying a woman
with emotional problems who just cannot

seem to figure out relationships with men.
In the end, Harold's only chance of
getting someone pregnant is to learn how

women really work. This led to some scenes that felt a
bit moralizing, but overall, this originally offbeat come
dy about relationships is well worth seeing.
