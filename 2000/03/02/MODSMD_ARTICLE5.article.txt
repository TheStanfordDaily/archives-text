# Midnight program on for good
## 
### CHRIS DRAKE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's official: Stanford After Mid
night is here to stay, at least
through the 2000 Spring Quarter
Representatives from participants
in Stanford After Midnight met
last week to discuss late night
hours at each location. By the end
of the meeting, several partici
pants decided to adjust their busi
ness hours, while others elected to
continue theirs. Nevertheless, all
will continue to offer some extend
ed hours as part of the Stanford
After Midnight program.

Dean of Students Marc VVais is
sued a press release late this after
noon that detailed the decisions
each participant made.
"I'm excited that we've been
able to continue and enhance
Stanford .After Midnight," Wais
said.
ASSU President Mike Levin
was equally enthusiastic.
"1 am thrilled and delighted
that students have used the facili
ties later on at night and that the
program will continue through
out the remainder of the year and,
hopefully, for many years to
tome," Levin said. "I am hopeful
that the ASSU and the University
can partner on more programs
like Stanford After Midnight to
make tangible improvements to
the quality of student life."
Participants in Stanford After
Midnight include athletic facilities,
restaurants and various student
services, including Late Night Din
ing.
Jeanette Smith-Laws, director
of Meeting Services at Tresidder
Union, said that hours have been
adjusted to better accommodate
student needs.
"We understand it's really diffi
cult for students to find meeting
spaces," Smith-Laws said. While
Meeting Services had been keep
ing various spaces at Tresidder
open until 1:30 a.m. during the fall
of 1999, "what has happened is
we're now open 'til 2 a.m. seven
days a week," she said. "We like to
try different things."
Although few students have
been using meeting rooms at
Tresidder during late-night
hours, Smith-Laws said, the popu
larity of the study hall on the first
floor of Tresidder justifies the 2
a.m. closing time.
"We're like downtown Stan
ford. [Tresidder] is it," she said.
"We want to see if [usage] will pick
up. We want to give it a chance. We
encourage people to use the ser
vice."
"For us, the changes [in hours]

aren't really significant," said Bon
Appetit General Manager
Matthew Almeida. "We'll continue
to be open until 2 a.m. during
Spring Quarter."
Bon Appetit oversees such ven
dors as the Corner Pocket, the Cof
fee House and the cafeterias at
Tresidder.
Regardless of the drop-off in
sales during the one o'clock hour,
Almeida said, "it's important for
[Bon Appetit] to participate in
things that enhance student life
here. It doesn't take a huge
amount of sales to bring us to the
break-even point for that hour."
"Students are much safer here
than they are going into Palo Alto,"
Almeida said. Among many other
reasons, Bon Appetit is participat
ing in Stanford after Midnight in
an effort to have students stay on
campus late at night, he said.
According to the press release,
"the [Tresidder] Computer Lair
will be open until 2 a.m. each
evening." The same is true for
the Ford Center basketball
courts, meeting rooms at Tresid
der, including the first-floor
study hall, and the Tresidder Fit
ness Center.
The Treehouse will be open
until 2 a.m. from Monday
through Thursday and until mid
night on Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday.
The Coffee House will stay
open until 2 a.m. Sunday through
Thursday, and until midnight Fri
day and Saturday. Late Night Din
ing will still be available until 2 a.m.
at Stein and Lakeside Dining
Halls Sunday through Thursday.
I resitWer Express will close at 1

а.m. Sunday through Thursday
and at midnight Friday and Satur
day.
The Pulse will adjust its hours to
6 p.m. to 2 a.m. on Sunday, with
only self-service operations avail
able after 5 p.m. The store will be
open until 2 a.m. Monday through
Thursday and until midnight Fri
day.
Due to low student usage, two
of the participants in Stanford
After Midnight, the Stanford
Bookstore and the DeGuerre
Rackquetball Courts, will cut
back their business hours. Unlike
the other business hours adjust
ments, these changes are "effec
tive immediately," according to
the press release.
The-Stanford Bookstore will no
longer be open between 9:00 p.m.
and 11:00 p.m. on Friday nights.
The DeGuerre Racquetball courts,
previously open until 2:00 a.m.,
will now remain open until mid
night seven days a week.
Two other participants have
joined Stanford After Midnight for
spring quarter.
Starting next Monday, March
б, the first floor of Meyer Library
will be open 24 hours a day, seven
days a week. Jamba Juice will ex
tend its hours at least until 9 p.m.
each evening.
VVais said he was "thrilled that
Meyer will be open 24 hours a day
.. . since students will use this valu
able academic resource as they
prepare for finals."
VVais noted that the "future suc
cess and vitality of Stanford After
Midnight will depend on student
utilization of [vendors and services
during] these extended hours."
