# Super political sites for Super Tuesday
## 
### ENO SARRIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In honor of the upcoming Golden
State primaries, I pointed my browser
at the various political sites that litter the*
cylierworld. What 1 found was sobering
— the Internet is definitely the most
powerful extension of the long arm of
I he Media.
There I was, trying to get unbiased
information unfiltered by media giants,
on www.political2ooo.com, when the
paranoia struck. The presentation of
the site was a bit too flashy, and what
was that peacock doing in the corner,
anyway? Uh-oh. It seems that the large
media conglomerations have extended
their presence to the online world, reg
istering domain names left and right. I
guess it shouldn't lie a surprise — why
should computers be any different than
televisions?
I'll tell you why. Sheer volume alone
dictates that the Internet would return
some g<xxl sites with the bad. And it
did.
www.Electionsearch2ooo.org lifted
my spirits. Ihe site is beautiful in its
simplicity. Election Search is what it
claims to lx* — a search engine for polit
ical information. You can either search
a certain candidates' site for informa
tion regarding an issue or search all of
them lor a comparative l<x>k. Easy and
quick is how I like em. And then you
don't have to actually go to
www.keyes2ooo.org to find out that
Alan Keyes is crazy (as if you had to
anyway).
So it is spin from the doctors them
selves, taking their word for it, but it's
better than getting it second-hand.
www.govote.com also does the search

4
thing well, but in a more

cluttered approach.
Scattered headlines

about popular
issues hide the
best part of this

1
site — a
candidate
matching
quiz.

Answer a 1
few ques
tions, click a

few buttons,
and then complain

about their choice for

you.
My favorite site on the ol' World
Wide Web was www.opensecrets.org.
Open Secrets is a statistical approach to
the whole thing, and therefore the clos
est to unbiased info you can get. I
learned, a bit later than some of my
more learned friends, that the Republi
can Party consistently gets twice the
contributions that the Democratic Party
gets.
Campaign contribution information
isn't complete for all of the states, but
browse this site for a while anyway. Par
ticularly interesting are also the names
of the leading contributors to lx>th par
ties. Guess how much money the NRA
gives a year in your state.
www.votenet.com can also tell you
who's giving whom money. "Follow
the Money!" as they declare, by submit
ting a zip code. It's a bit unsettling to-see
all of your next-door neighbors' politi
cal choices — and also not really your
business. But Votenet is still an interest
ing site, with a $50,000 ePrimary con
test as well, if you're into that money
thing.

If you want less-spun info, try
www.npr.org/news/national/elec
tion2000. Don't let all tlie forward
slashes get you down — it's still just
NPR, and you don't need to remember
all the rest of that URL. Or, of course,
go straight to your favorite newspaper's
presence online — but remember how
similar "The Man" and "The Media"
are. www.Politicsl.com deserves an
honorable mention as an all right news
portal for elections, as they also include
profiles on all the candidates.
If you are looking for an Explanation
of the many propositions on the Cali
fornia ballot, go to www.lao.ca.gov. It
won't be immediately apparent —
you've got to search for "propositions"
to find them — but the analysis is to the
point and straight from the govern
ment, if that makes you any happier.
And for logistical and local voting facts,
www.sccvote.org is your place to be.
So go out there and sharpen the
weapon that is your knowledge. Then
take that weapon and strike down the
Man! Strike him down, I say!
