# 'My Dog' hard to love
## 
### RANDY MANO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
1 usually adore pets in movies, especially lovable ones that, say, get lost in the woods or
tan talk up a storm with other barnyard creatures. But Skip (played by the terrier from
"Frasier") and the boy who loves him are far from the most compelling pair on the big screen.
"My Dog Skip" is a clean, family-friendly film with some laughs and very few surprises.
Based upon a true story, "My Dog Skip" could be any youth's tale. The plot tracks Willie
Morris (Frankie Muni/ from "Malcolm in the Middle"), a child growing up in the segregat
ed confines of Yazoo, Miss, who eventually becomes the state's first Rhodes Scholar.
The golden-boy-next-door, Dink Jenkins (Luke Wilson), is Willie's hero. Willie wants to be

Ins friend as badly as Tom Ripley craved
to be in the Dickie Greenleaf crowd,
except here the motives are innocent and
attainable. Poor Willie: he's constantly
picked on by three bullies (who, wouldn't
you know it, grow to be his friends), so
when Dink leaves to serve in World War
11, Willie is alone.
Bring on Skip, the happy-go-lucky
pooch. Cue the endless moments of cute
dog scenes, invariably involving toilets,
an even cuter Rivers Applewhite (Caitlin
Wachs) or deli bologna. I love dogs —
and animals in general — but this movie
was simply too saccharine for its own
good.

In touch with the movie's caring tone, arguments about Skip and Willie between Ellen and
jack (Diane Lane and a crippled Kevin Bacon), Willie's parents, are mild and resolvable.
Lane and Bacon bring as much lite to the boring characterizations as humanly possible.
Funny as it may seem, Harry C ion nick Jr. provides the narration that pops up periodical-

ly throughout "My Dog Skip." There really is nothing
wrong or objectionable about Connick's voice-overs or
the rest of the movie. I just wonder why it was made and
why people would want to see it. Little new ground is
broken.
Predictable conflicts arise (e.g. dog runs away from
Willie, or Rivers is mad at Willie, or Dink isolates himself
from Willie) arid then are resolved.

Less melodrama and more depth in the characters
would have improved this family drama. The most interesting thing is probably the dog,
which actually isn't saying much in this case. "My Dog Skip" suffers from being too warm and
slow-moving in a world of special effects; still, this is one fuzzy, comic slice of nostalgia that is
very hard to criticize too harshly.
