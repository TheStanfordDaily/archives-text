### AMY L. KOVAC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Several pending research pro
jects in the humanities may prove
the Presidential Symposia in the
I lumanities and Arts to be a suc
cess, including some possible pro
jects in a new "humanities labora
tory'" to be established within the
next few months.
I he fourth and final Presiden
tial Svmposium was held Feb. I I
to 12.
I'hese svmposia were part of a
plan, announced in 1997 In Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper, to transform and
strengthen the humanities and
arts on campus.
I he plan includes the Presi
dential Lectures as well as the ad

dition of four new professorships
in the humanities and arts.
Unlike the Presidential Lec
tures which are expected to con
tinue, the symposia were experi
mental from the start.
Only four were originally
planned.
Their central mission was to
explore the present and future
relations between the humanities
and arts and other disciplines.
According to (comparative Lit
erature Prof. If,ms Gumbrecht,
director of the Presidential Lec
tures and Symposia, and French
and Italian department chair
Prof. Jeffrey Schnapps, the
money in the budget that was al
located for the symposia will like
ly be used to fund research
groups based on information
gained in the symposia and may
possibly be used within the
framework of the new Stanford
Humanities Laboratory.
The opening of the laboratory
will be formally announced at the
beginning of spring quarter and
is set to open this fall, according
to Schnapps, who is leading the
laboratory project.
" I he symposia were always
meant as an investment to pro
duce possibilities for highly inno
vative interdisciplinary re
search," said (luinbrecht.
As far as how the events went
to stimulate further inquiry into
researching the humanities and
their link to other disciplines,
Gumbrecht said, "I was very
happy with how the symposia
went."
Schnapps added, "I think that
they were extremely stimulating
events and involved distin
guished people from a wide array
of disciplines."
"The main level of impact was
that they will serve as a stimulus
for scholars to re-think the way
that they themselves envisage
their fields and to think adven
turously about their future pro
jects," he said.
"1 think that, wisely, the svm

posia were not meant to product*
a traditional product, like a book,
but rather to be much more open
ended than that."
The fact that there will be no
further symposia "is definitely
not [an indication of'J a case
where the administration has
taken money away from tlit' hu
manities," (luinbrecht said.
While there may be some
overlap in the research projects
of the laboratory and the subjects
discussed in the symposia,
Schnapps made clear that there is
no direct correlation between the
two.
At the present moment, there
is no set timetable for when the
possible research groups will In
formed.
However, Gumhrecht said,
"We will certainly try to do some
thing regarding the humanities
and sciences and humanities and
engineering, and we should start
somewhere in the next academic
year."
As for the future of special pro
grams in the humanities and arts,
University President Gerhard
Gasper is expected to make some
remarks regarding the humani
ties in his Stale of the University
speech according to Alan Acosta,
director of University Gotnmuni
cations.
Gasper's yearly speech takes
place today in Kresge Auditiori
uni at 4:15 p.m. The State of the
University is open to members ol
the Stanford community.
