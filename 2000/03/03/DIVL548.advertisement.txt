Memorial Auditorium
Post-performance discussion with Meredith
Monk and company follows
"There is no one like Monk and no other
work like "Magic Frequencies. "
—the Los Angeles Times
In the Northern California premiere of
Meredith Monk's new theatrical and playful
"science fiction chamber opera," offbeat
vignettes of everyday life fuse cutting-edge
music with movement, pantomime, and other
worldly objects in a kaleidoscopic collabora
tion that exposes the cracks between the tem
poral and the spiritual, revealing the magic
frequencies on which we communicate. "In
originality, in scope, in depth, there are few to
rival her," says the Washington Post.
Stanford students: $ 10/$ l 3/$ 16
