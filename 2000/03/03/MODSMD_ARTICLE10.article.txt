# Tresidder hits and exceeds its capacity
## 
### SANDRA UPSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students who have the tenaci
ty to mount the treadmill at I a.m.
are apparently not alone: I resid
der Fitness continues to be full to
capacity, even with the imple
mentation of its new Stanford
After Midnight hours.
Despite the extended hours,
the crowding at peak hours still
remains the same. I n fact, I resid
der Fitness has seen an increase
from around 500 to around 000
people per day who make use ol
the machines, causing excess
strain upon the equipment.
According to the statistics
maintained by the I residder 112 it
ness front desk, the crowd of peo
ple coming around H p.m. has
leveled out over the evening and
the current crowd has moved to
around 10 p.m.
"Friday afternoons we have to
keep people standing outside,"
said senior Sarah Thompson as
sistant manager at I residder 112 it
ness.
Only 55 people are allowed to
use the facility at one time. "We're
the most frequented gym of the
Bay Area in terms of cardio
equipment," said Thompson.
"With the gym being open from 7
a.m. to 2 a.m., it is inevitable that
the machines will break down
from such heavy usage, especially

the treadmills."
Compared to other facilities
on campus, I residder Fitness oi
lers a more comprehensive com
bination of cardiovascular ma
chines and strength machines.
Unlike the Arrillaga Weight
Room and the Ford Center,
1 residder Fitness boasts both car
diovascular and strength ma
chines. It also has a very conve
nient location on campus, which
makes it even more attractive to
students.
Other schools, such as Emory
and UCLA, have one compre
hensive center that covers all stu
dent needs. Emory's Williams
Oym has a weight room, a dance
studio surrounded by a small in
door track, and multiple indoor
and outdoor courts.
UCLA's John R. Wooden
Recreation and Sports Center has
around 700.000 people per year
use their 100,000 sq. ft. facility,
70-80 percent of whom are siu
dents. The center is open from 6
a.m. to 9:45 p.m.
"1 think the hours are ade
quate, but if they are expanded,
I'm sure they'd be well-received,"
said Dan Wax, manager of the
John Wooden Center. "No for
mal discussion on lengthier hours
has been initiated, but I think it
would definitely be a good idea
and administrators have started
to mention it."
Sherry Posthumus, who heads
Stanford club sports, agrees that a
new fitness facility is needed.
"It should definitely be highly
recommended to the university.
The Tresidder weight room
could probably double in size and
might still not be big enough."
According to Thompson, "The
University needs to either build
another facility or to up the main

tenance of the machines."
Posthumus saitl that the Athletic
Department is already trying to
find someone to more regularly
maintain the different gyms
around campus.
ASSU President Mike Levin
cited problems with ventilation in
the Tresidder weight room. "It's
hard to do anything to get more
ventilation .... Tresidder is an
old building."
"I've seen the gym during the
late afternoon and it gets really
crowded, so I wouldn't mind get
ting a new gym," said freshman
Wei Jiang Ho.
