### MARGAUX HALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the average American con
sumer may conscientiously buy prod
ucts with a "Made in the USA" label, a
former sweatshop worker told stu
dents last night that laborers produc
ing these garments frequently operate
under conditions far below national
labor standards.
The talk, given to an audience of
about 40 students, was held iu a lecture
room of the Psychology Building. It
featured former CAP Inc. sweatshop
worker Chie Abad, who focused on the
inferior work conditions of sweatshop
laborers in Saipan, a Pacific Island in
the U.S. Commonwealth of Marianas.
Abad said that approximately
Â» 15,000 workers working in sweatshops
in Saipan lack the basic labor rights of
US workers, although their products
bear the USA label.
These Saipan laborers produce gar
ments for dozens of mainstream cloth-

ing companies, including
Walmart, Lauren, Disney
Co., and Liz Claiborne, ac
cording to Abad.
She said that the majori
ty of Saipan workers leave
their homes in Asia to work
at the sweatshops under
the false impression that
their bosses will ascribe to
the labor policies of the US,
which they regard as "the
champion for human
rights."
During her six-year ca
reer at the GAP Inc. sweat
shop, however, Abad said
she witnessed degraded
working conditions and an
overall neglect for human
rights.

"We [l lie workers] lived
in unsanitary barracks behind barbed
wire," she said.
In addition, she said the workers
were forced to sign contracts that pre
cluded them from joining political and

religious organizations, marrying, or
complaining about their living condi
tions.
