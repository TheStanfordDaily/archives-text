### MARGAUX HALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the average American con
sumer may conscientiously buy prod
ucts with a "Made in the USA" label, a
former sweatshop worker told stu
dents last night that laborers produc
ing these garments frequently operate
under conditions far below national
labor standards.
The talk, given to an audience of
about 40 students, was held iu a lecture
room of the Psychology Building. It
featured former CAP Inc. sweatshop
worker Chie Abad, who focused on the
inferior work conditions of sweatshop
laborers in Saipan, a Pacific Island in
the U.S. Commonwealth of Marianas.
Abad said that approximately
Â» 15,000 workers working in sweatshops
in Saipan lack the basic labor rights of
US workers, although their products
bear the USA label.
These Saipan laborers produce gar
ments for dozens of mainstream cloth-

ing companies, including
Walmart, Lauren, Disney
Co., and Liz Claiborne, ac
cording to Abad.
She said that the majori
ty of Saipan workers leave
their homes in Asia to work
at the sweatshops under
the false impression that
their bosses will ascribe to
the labor policies of the US,
which they regard as "the
champion for human
rights."
During her six-year ca
reer at the GAP Inc. sweat
shop, however, Abad said
she witnessed degraded
working conditions and an
overall neglect for human
rights.

"We [l lie workers] lived
in unsanitary barracks behind barbed
wire," she said.
In addition, she said the workers
were forced to sign contracts that pre
cluded them from joining political and

religious organizations, marrying, or
complaining about their living condi
tions.


SASHA SIDDHARTHA/The Stanford Daily
Labor activist and former sweatshop worker Chie
Abad spoke last night about working conditions.
After Abad tried to organize a
workers' union she was fired.
Since then she has been active in
creating legislation that address
es the conditions. "No worker
should be treated like a slave,"
Abad said.
Together with the ABC televi
sion corporation's "20/ 20" pro
gram, Abad created a hidden
camera documentary of her fac
tory's labor conditions.
She added that her efforts,
with the help of the Global Ex
change organization, have al
ready resulted in the settlements
of several lawsuits with clothing

companies for violation of labor
standards.
Abad advocated student ac
tion by writing t lie companies op
erating such sweatshops and or
ganizing more-localized sweat
shop movements to raise aware
ness.
Numerous campus organiza
tions, including Stanford Labor
Action Coalition and MEChA, a
Chicano/ Latino student group,
helped sponsor Abad's lecture in
an effort to raise campus aware
ness of the existing sweatshop
labor conditions.
"We make everyday choices as
consumers, so it we [SLAC] basi
cally want to get people to think
about what companies they're
supporting," said freshman
Becca katz, a member of SLAC.
