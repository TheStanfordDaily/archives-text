a film 1 began in 1996 during the 100 th An
niversary of Adwa" Gerima said. "I went to
Ethiopia and documented what I could."
Gerima's film showing was one of several
events of ADWA 2000, a larger event hosted

African victory over a European force and

majority of the African continent was being

conquered bv Kuropeans.
" I his isn't a celebration of a military vic
tory," said the president of Stanford
Kthiopian Student Union Abel Bogale, a se

defend the culture and sovereignty of their
state."
The Stanford Kthiopian Student Union
chose to show this film and have Geritna as
a keynote speaker to promote awareness

been about Ethiopia; he rose to
fame with bis first film, "I farvest -
3000 Years," which depicted the
struggles of Ethiopian peasantrv.

more films.
At the showing, Gerima com

mented that young Ethiopians
now have both passion for pro
moting awareness, and skills and
education to spread their word.
Tin really proud to see young
Ethiopians reclaim our history in
such a vigorous fashion," Gerima
said.
According to Stanford alumni
Haeran l isseba, the Battle of
Adwa is significant to the entire
black community.
"[This is a time] to remember
and reflect on the victory of Adwa
lor all black people," Fisseba said.
"The battle of Adwa should be as
much a source of inspiration to
black people everywhere just as
Malcoin X and Martin Luther
king, Jr. were to the Ethiopians."
