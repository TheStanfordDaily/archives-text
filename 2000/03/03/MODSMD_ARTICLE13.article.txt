## Hacker is questioned 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Police
said yesterday that they ques
tioned a self-proclaimed teen-age
hacker known on the Internet as
"coolio," one of the monikers the
FBI suspects may have been
involved in last month's sensa
tional attacks against major Web
sites.
federal agents have seized the
youth's computer, and federal
prosecutors are weighing
whether to charge him with com
puter crimes unrelated to the
attacks that overwhelmed those
Web sites, a federal law enforce
ment official in Washington said.
The 17-year-old, who lives in
New Hampshire, acknowledged
to police that he had hacked into
100 Web sites, including one
based in Los Angeles.
The teen made his claims
when lie was being questioned by
Los Angeles police, L\Pl) Officer
Joe Buscaino said yesterday.
Federal prosecutors planned
to meet with New Hampshire
prosecutors today to discuss
charges.
Last month, Justice Depart
ment officials identified "coolio"
as one of several hackers, known
only by their monikers, sought in
connection with the string of
attacks on popular Web sites.
Federal investigators believe,
however, that the New Hamp
shire youth is only one of a num
ber of people who have used the
screen name coolio.
Federal prosecutors are con
sidering charging the New Eng
land youth with some computer
crimes other than February's
denial of service attacks.
