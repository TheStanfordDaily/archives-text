LONDON (AP) — Former Chilean dic
tator Gen. Augusto Pinochet departed
Britain a free man yesterday, ending a Hi
month legal saga heralded for establishing
that former leaders accused of human
rights abuses are not immune from prose
cution abroad.
"This has been an unprecedented case.
Both I and the courts have had to navigate
in uncharted territory," Home Secretary
Jack Straw told the House of Commons
after ruling that the 84-year-old general
was mentally unfit to be extradited to
Spain for trial on torture charges.
Straw also dismissed extradition
requests from three other nations that con
tended their citizens were victims of
Pinochet's regime — Belgium, France and
Switzerland.
Pinochet, who doctors say suffered
brain damage when he experienced two
small strokes last fall, left Britain yesterday
afternoon and was expected to arrive in
Santiago today after an undisclosed
stopover en route.
The former dictator issued no comment
as his detention in Britain came to an end,
but his eldest son, Augusto Marco Antonio,
said in the Chilian capitol, Santiago, that
his father received the news of his freedom
"very calmly, the way he usually is, without
showing his feelings and emotions."
While human rights groups expressed
dismay at Straw's ruling, they also
applauded the British and Spanish courts
for decisions that strengthened the reach
of an international law against torture that
had been little known despite ratification
by dozens of countries.
Under the law, which Britain adopted
in 1988, torture became an international
crime that any nation may prosecute and
from which no one enjoys immunity.
Britain's top court of appeals, the
House of Lords, cited the law in issuing its
precedent-setting decision to strip
Pinochet of his immunitv.
