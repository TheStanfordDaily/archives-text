# Underdogs McCain and Bradley try to push messages
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — John McCain
is railing against George W. Bush's cam
paign tactics and the evangelical leaders
who "unfairly attacked" one of his advis
ers. Suddenly an aide jumps up from a
hotel sofa, leans over a tray of coffee cups
and slips him a note.
"Social Security," is scrawled on the
paper, a reminder that — once again —
the boss is off message.
Getting the hint, McCain abruptly
changes the subject in his interview with
newspaper editors and launches into his

plans to bolster Social Security. "We're
going to be emphasizing that kind of issue
rather than this negative campaigning,"
the Arizona senator said yesterday, hours
before a Republican presidential debate.
"I think Americans are turned oil by"
negative politics.
He should know.
Republican analysts and some of
McCain's own advisers believe his insur
gent campaign has been knocked oil
track, first by a bitterly personal South
Carolina campaign against Bush and,

more recently, his scathing indictment of
Christian conservative leaders.
His pugnacious rhetoric has drowned
out the message that carried McCain this
far: a pledge to reform the political svs
tern and restore dignitx to the White
House. I he Arizona senator is sending
mixed messages to voters, particularh in
states like- (ialilbrnia u here he is relativelv
unknown.
Fellow underdog Bill Bradle\ has a
similar problem on the Democratic side.
His promise ol a new style of politics

never took root here — in large part,
aides believe, because McCain's momen
tum dominated the media's attention.
Needing to shake things up, Bradley
went alter Vice President A 1 Core in lowa
and New Hampshire and — alter losing
those contests — stepped the vitriol up a
notch. It wasn't until Wednesdays debate
here that Bradley returned to the
t bought lul style I hat attracted voters earh
011.
His candidate hanging In a thread,
Bradley wanted to leave a good impres

sion il it was his last.
McCain has troubles of his own, partic
ularly in this all-important state, but
unlike Bradley he still has a reasonable
chance to secure an upset in Tuesday's
13-state showdown. But he must redis
cover his message.
"The humble hero out to reform gov
ernment and be fiscally responsible with
Social Security and tax cuts — that's the
John McCain who gave George W. Bush
a run lot all his money," said California
GOP strategist Don Sipple.
