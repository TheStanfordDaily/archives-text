# Increased oil production may soon lower gas prices

LONDON (AP) â€” Three major
petroleum-exporting countries recom
mended a boost in crude oil production yes
terday to ease a world shortage and trim the
high prices consumers pay lor home heating
oil and gasoline.
But the oil ministers from Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela and Mexico wouldn't specify the
amount or timing and oil industry analysts
said this lack of specifics means prices aren't
likely to ease significantly any time soon.
"This market needs to see real barrels,
not promises. That's what's going to bring
prices down," said Peter Gignoux of
Salomon Smith Barney in London.
A final decision will likely come at a long
anticipated meeting of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna
on March 27.
"Uppermost in our minds is to maintain
stability in the markets," Saudi-Oil Minister
Ali Naimi told a news conference yesterday.
"We recognize that there is a need for addi
tional production. The issue is when and
how much."
Saudi Arabia is the wolf's No. 1 oil
exporter, and Venezuela has the third
largest output in OPEC. Mexico is a major
non-OPEC producer.
"We are convinced that we have to
increase production this year," said
Venezuelan Oil Minister Ali Rodriguez.

Oil exporters inside and outside of ()PE( 1
cut production in 1998 and 1999 to boost
historically low prices.
As a result, crude has soared from $ 10.72
a barrel on Dec. 10, 1998, to a nine-year
high on Wednesday of $31.77 in trading on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Heating oil prices have doubled in some
areas of the northeastern United States this
winter, and U.S. gasoline prices have nearcd
an average of $1.50 a gallon, an all-time
high. At that rate, it will cost about $900
more to fuel a popular, but gas-guzzling
Chevy Suburban this year than it did in
1999.
The increases could eventually endanger
economic growth in oil importing countries.
In recent weeks, exporters have come
under intense pressure from the United
States and other importers to pump more
crude so as to bring prices down.
One congressman introduced legislation
Wednesday that would bar military assis
tance to any oil-exporting nation involved in
price manipulation.
However, yesterday's announcement
from the oil exporters did little to inspire
confidence on the oil markets.
Future prices for light, sweet crude for
delivery in April rose as high as $32.15 in
New York, then eased off somewhat to close
at $31.69.
