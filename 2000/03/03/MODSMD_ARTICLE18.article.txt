## THE 						FLIP SIDE The 						thrill of victory 
### 
I love sports. The thrill, the excite
ment, the tears, the face of anguish
that always finds its way onto news
papers (you know the face, the one

that looks like you're
taking a really big
dump). Sports repre
sent the human strug
gle, our bitterest emo
tions and truest desires
coming through in our
search for victory. And
then of course, there are
llie moments in sports
which last a lifetime, the

"Do you remember when . .moments
that make it all worthwhile.
Going to Stanford, we get more "Do
you remember when .. moments than
most other schools. I here exist only two
constants in college athletics these days:
Florida State will destroy anybody at col
lege football and Stanford will win the
Sears Directors' ('.up. If Stanford were it's
own country, we would have ranked
fourth in the 1996 Olympics in the gold
medal count. Calling our athletic program
"good" is almost as insulting as Christina
Aguilera winning a Grammy.
Kvery year, our amazing athletes have
those special moments that slick iu every
body's minds. These moments emerge
equally from victory and defeat staying in
the minds and hearts of all students and

athletes who have participated in or
watched I lie struggle.
For instance, did you hear about the
Stanford women's tennis team last year?
It's the- National Championship final
against defending champion Florida. Alter
going down 2-1 after three singles match
es, Keiko Tokuda goes down 5-2 in the
fourth singles match before a rain delay.
She conies back from the rain delay to win
the match tying the overall score at 2
matches apiece. Next, Jennifer Heiser
conies back after facing triple match point
in the second set to force ;i third set where
she would finally win. All eyes turned to
freshmen, Lauren Kalvaria. After facing
three match points, she forces a tiebreaker
where she wins and caps an amazing string
of comebacks and victories for the Stan
ford team. The following day, Marissa
lin in played with Keiko Tokuda for the
first lime all season at No. 2 doubles, yet
still won to give Stanford the champi
onship.
Did you hear about the Fencing NCAA
Championships last year? Monique
Deßruin and Felicia Zimmerman were
lighting side-by-side in the individual
championships for Women's Foil and
Women's Kpee. All Stanford supporters
held their breath while watching both
Stanford fencers inch closer to victory.


Jit Bhattacharya
Deßruin won her match 15-10 as Zimmer
man went into sudden death. Winning the
first touch, Stanford returned home with
two individual NCAA titles won side-by
side.
Or then there's the Women's Lacrosse
Team. Most teams laugh at the thought of
Californians playing lacrosse, especially
against East Coast schools. Until they saw
the Stanford Women's Lacrosse team tied
at 7 with the University of Pennsylvania. A
puny California School beating one of the
big bad ogres of the East Coast? No, it
would never happen. And then it hap

pened. Katherine Barnes scored the win
ning goal for the Cardinal with minutes
remaining, stunning the Stanford team
and the entire East Coast.
Or more recently, you had to have seen
or at least heard about the Stanford
Women's Basketball team four weeks ago.
Down by 2f> points in the first half to 23rd
ranked Oregon, the game was pretty
much over. And then this sophomore
from Philadelphia, named Lauren St.
Clair, completed a 4-point play with about
four minutes remaining in thc j first hall.
And something changed inside Maples
Pavilion. It was as if a 22 point deficit was
nothing. Everyone seemed to know the)
had a shot. In the largest point
turnaround ever in the Stanford women's
team history, the Cardinal started clawing
back lead by Lauren St. Clair and fresh
man Jamie Carey (who shoots most ol her

threes fiom the NBA three point line) hit
ling threes from anywhere and every
where on the lloor. They came back to win
l>\ sixteen going away, lor everyone in
Maples Pavilion, they were the heroes of
the clay.
Did you hear about that game? You
must have. It was epic. Or have you heard
about the spectacular moments from the
Cross-Country season or from Men's and
Women's Rugby or Gymnastics or Ulti
mate Irisbee. OF COURSE YOU
HAVEN'T!! Nobody cares about those
sports. We are so turned on by Football
and Men's Basketball that we forget about
other sports on this campus. And here we
were thinking Stanford students are origi
nal in their obsessions.
Yes, our basketball team is ranked No. 1
right now. Yes, our football team went to
the Rose Bowl. But ifvou look at the num

her of National Championship teams we
have, it's pretty ridiculous how much hype
and support those two teams get in com
parison to the rest of sports here at Stan
ford. Most members of the 6th man club
probably don't even realize that the
women's basketball team is currently first in
the Pac-10. Of course, most members of the
6th man club don't really know what day it
is. It's either game day or some other day.
So many of our athletic teams are
National Championship contenders every
year that we start to take them for granted.
Simply acknowledging that one of our
teams wins a National Championship
doesn't give you the full flavor of the victo
ry. Everyone who has ever been to a game
knows the difference between going to a
game/seeing a game and knowing the final
score.
So this weekend, try something new.

When you're not at the Men's Basketball
game, go see the Synchronized Swimming
meet on Saturday. Or even better, come
cheer for four Stanford Teams at the Stan
ford Invitational Ultimate Frisbee Tourna
ment this weekend. You'll get to watch me
play (Yes, this is a shameless plug for my
own sport). If you come to the Ultimate
tournament, I can promise you any num
ber of "Do you remember when . .
moments. More importantly, you'll get a
glimpse at one of those "other" sports,
sports that you don't really know about,
but which hold more excitement and
struggle than you could possibly imagine.

fit Bhattacharya is in fact on the Stanford
Mens Ultimate Team. If you can't see him on
the field, it's because he's hidden in the crowd of
average height players. E-mail praise about his
frisbee skill to jit@leland.

When you're not at the Men's Basketball
game, go see the Synchronized Swimming
meet on Saturday. Or even better, come
cheer for four Stanford Teams at the Stan
ford Invitational Ultimate Frisbee Tourna
ment this weekend. You'll get to watch me
play (Yes, this is a shameless plug for my
own sport). If you come to the Ultimate
tournament, I can promise you any num
ber of "Do you remember when . .
moments. More importantly, you'll get a
glimpse at one of those "other" sports,
sports that you don't really know about,
but which hold more excitement and
struggle than you could possibly imagine.

fit Bhattacharya is in fact on the Stanford
Mens Ultimate Team. If you can't see him on
the field, it's because he's hidden in the crowd of
average height players. E-mail praise about his
frisbee skill to jit@leland.
I love sports. The thrill, the excite
ment, the tears, the face of anguish
that always finds its way onto news
papers (you know the face, the one

that looks like you're
taking a really big
dump). Sports repre
sent the human strug
gle, our bitterest emo
tions and truest desires
coming through in our
search for victory. And
then of course, there are
llie moments in sports
which last a lifetime, the

"Do you remember when . .moments
that make it all worthwhile.
Going to Stanford, we get more "Do
you remember when .. moments than
most other schools. I here exist only two
constants in college athletics these days:
Florida State will destroy anybody at col
lege football and Stanford will win the
Sears Directors' ('.up. If Stanford were it's
own country, we would have ranked
fourth in the 1996 Olympics in the gold
medal count. Calling our athletic program
"good" is almost as insulting as Christina
Aguilera winning a Grammy.
Kvery year, our amazing athletes have
those special moments that slick iu every
body's minds. These moments emerge
equally from victory and defeat staying in
the minds and hearts of all students and

athletes who have participated in or
watched I lie struggle.
For instance, did you hear about the
Stanford women's tennis team last year?
It's the- National Championship final
against defending champion Florida. Alter
going down 2-1 after three singles match
es, Keiko Tokuda goes down 5-2 in the
fourth singles match before a rain delay.
She conies back from the rain delay to win
the match tying the overall score at 2
matches apiece. Next, Jennifer Heiser
conies back after facing triple match point
in the second set to force ;i third set where
she would finally win. All eyes turned to
freshmen, Lauren Kalvaria. After facing
three match points, she forces a tiebreaker
where she wins and caps an amazing string
of comebacks and victories for the Stan
ford team. The following day, Marissa
lin in played with Keiko Tokuda for the
first lime all season at No. 2 doubles, yet
still won to give Stanford the champi
onship.
Did you hear about the Fencing NCAA
Championships last year? Monique
Deßruin and Felicia Zimmerman were
lighting side-by-side in the individual
championships for Women's Foil and
Women's Kpee. All Stanford supporters
held their breath while watching both
Stanford fencers inch closer to victory.


Jit Bhattacharya
Deßruin won her match 15-10 as Zimmer
man went into sudden death. Winning the
first touch, Stanford returned home with
two individual NCAA titles won side-by
side.
Or then there's the Women's Lacrosse
Team. Most teams laugh at the thought of
Californians playing lacrosse, especially
against East Coast schools. Until they saw
the Stanford Women's Lacrosse team tied
at 7 with the University of Pennsylvania. A
puny California School beating one of the
big bad ogres of the East Coast? No, it
would never happen. And then it hap

pened. Katherine Barnes scored the win
ning goal for the Cardinal with minutes
remaining, stunning the Stanford team
and the entire East Coast.
Or more recently, you had to have seen
or at least heard about the Stanford
Women's Basketball team four weeks ago.
Down by 2f> points in the first half to 23rd
ranked Oregon, the game was pretty
much over. And then this sophomore
from Philadelphia, named Lauren St.
Clair, completed a 4-point play with about
four minutes remaining in thc j first hall.
And something changed inside Maples
Pavilion. It was as if a 22 point deficit was
nothing. Everyone seemed to know the)
had a shot. In the largest point
turnaround ever in the Stanford women's
team history, the Cardinal started clawing
back lead by Lauren St. Clair and fresh
man Jamie Carey (who shoots most ol her

threes fiom the NBA three point line) hit
ling threes from anywhere and every
where on the lloor. They came back to win
l>\ sixteen going away, lor everyone in
Maples Pavilion, they were the heroes of
the clay.
Did you hear about that game? You
must have. It was epic. Or have you heard
about the spectacular moments from the
Cross-Country season or from Men's and
Women's Rugby or Gymnastics or Ulti
mate Irisbee. OF COURSE YOU
HAVEN'T!! Nobody cares about those
sports. We are so turned on by Football
and Men's Basketball that we forget about
other sports on this campus. And here we
were thinking Stanford students are origi
nal in their obsessions.
Yes, our basketball team is ranked No. 1
right now. Yes, our football team went to
the Rose Bowl. But ifvou look at the num

her of National Championship teams we
have, it's pretty ridiculous how much hype
and support those two teams get in com
parison to the rest of sports here at Stan
ford. Most members of the 6th man club
probably don't even realize that the
women's basketball team is currently first in
the Pac-10. Of course, most members of the
6th man club don't really know what day it
is. It's either game day or some other day.
So many of our athletic teams are
National Championship contenders every
year that we start to take them for granted.
Simply acknowledging that one of our
teams wins a National Championship
doesn't give you the full flavor of the victo
ry. Everyone who has ever been to a game
knows the difference between going to a
game/seeing a game and knowing the final
score.
So this weekend, try something new.

When you're not at the Men's Basketball
game, go see the Synchronized Swimming
