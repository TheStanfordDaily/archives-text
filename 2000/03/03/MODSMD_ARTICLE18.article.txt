## THE
						FLIP SIDE The
						thrill of victory 
### 
I love sports. The thrill, the excite
ment, the tears, the face of anguish
that always finds its way onto news
papers (you know the face, the one

that looks like you're
taking a really big
dump). Sports repre
sent the human strug
gle, our bitterest emo
tions and truest desires
coming through in our
search for victory. And
then of course, there are
llie moments in sports
which last a lifetime, the

"Do you remember when . .moments
that make it all worthwhile.
Going to Stanford, we get more "Do
you remember when .. moments than
most other schools. I here exist only two
constants in college athletics these days:
Florida State will destroy anybody at col
lege football and Stanford will win the
Sears Directors' ('.up. If Stanford were it's
own country, we would have ranked
fourth in the 1996 Olympics in the gold
medal count. Calling our athletic program
"good" is almost as insulting as Christina
Aguilera winning a Grammy.
Kvery year, our amazing athletes have
those special moments that slick iu every
body's minds. These moments emerge
equally from victory and defeat staying in
the minds and hearts of all students and

athletes who have participated in or
watched I lie struggle.
For instance, did you hear about the
Stanford women's tennis team last year?
It's the- National Championship final
against defending champion Florida. Alter
going down 2-1 after three singles match
es, Keiko Tokuda goes down 5-2 in the
fourth singles match before a rain delay.
She conies back from the rain delay to win
the match tying the overall score at 2
matches apiece. Next, Jennifer Heiser
conies back after facing triple match point
in the second set to force ;i third set where
she would finally win. All eyes turned to
freshmen, Lauren Kalvaria. After facing
three match points, she forces a tiebreaker
where she wins and caps an amazing string
of comebacks and victories for the Stan
ford team. The following day, Marissa
lin in played with Keiko Tokuda for the
first lime all season at No. 2 doubles, yet
still won to give Stanford the champi
onship.
Did you hear about the Fencing NCAA
Championships last year? Monique
De√üruin and Felicia Zimmerman were
lighting side-by-side in the individual
championships for Women's Foil and
Women's Kpee. All Stanford supporters
held their breath while watching both
Stanford fencers inch closer to victory.
