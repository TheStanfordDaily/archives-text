### JESSICA TUCKER-MOHL EDITORIAL STAFF 
Five generations of Stanford Tree
graced the court of Maples Pavillion last
night to welcome the newest "sprout" ju
niorAlex Newell.
" There's just something about Alex,"
said junior Evan Meagher, the current
Tree. "She's blinding.... [her perfor
mance was] beautiful but it also hurts your
eyes."
Newell, daz/ling in a green sports bra,
green body paint, brown spandex and a
plastic Christmas tree atop her head,
danced feverishly during time-outs at the
so-called "Sprout Night" at the Stanford-
USC basketball game.
"It was insane," she said. "It's what I've
wanted so badly ever since I've been here."
Newell is the first female tree since 1985.
Before then, however, women filled the
tree costume for six of seven years in a row.
When asked whether she represented
the beginning of a new era of female trees,
Newell shrugged. "I can't say ... the Cho
sen One is the Chosen One."

In her campaign to be tree, Newell
staged an "acid-inspired" checkers game, a
24-hour trampoline marathon in White
Plaza and literally raised the roof of her res
idence, Larkin, according to Meagher. "It
was like a halo."
On Wednesday evening, Newell orches
trated a performance of Michael Jackson's
"Thriller," replete with rotating spotlights
and 200 choreographed dancers. Attired in
a red leather-studded jacket, Newell won
over the Band and former Trees.
"[lt was] a campaign that can only be de
scribed as epic," Meagher said.
Early yesterday morning, Newell partic
ipated in a highly secretive ceremony with a
"machine-like gadget" known as the
"SWAK." According to Meagher, "[Alex]
scored a lot of points."
Newell and Meagher were joined last
night by past trees Chris Henderson, Matt
Merrill, Chris Cary and Chris Bonzon.
"It's the dawn of a new era," said
Meagher. "The future's looking bright."
