Debate over Pi Phi housing Continues
Many of the letters in response to the
Of lice of Residential (Education's decision
to grant the Pi Beta Phi sorority bousing
were closed-minded and way oil base.
While stSnie' were ftiotv humorous than
<Mbc l rs' (tlu" Band s' otter was more than
kind), the responses you published consist
ed of broad and unfair generalizations
about the organization. I hey only serve to
perpetuate the unfounded misconceptions
that people have about Greek organiza
tions on campus and to increase the divi
siveness over the housing issue.
Many of the critics who have spoken out
against Jane Camarillo's decision did so
with an air of resentment, like Pi Phi got
something they did not deserve. Nothing
could be further from the truth. After los
ing their housing over . r )0 years ago, the
young women in Pi Beta Phi applied, re
applied and worked very hard to finally get
it back. Mow many of their c ritics have
pledged to commit themselves to serving
others? Now many of them have demon
strated an interest in forming a community
in their own residence? I low many have
agreed to adhere to strict alcohol and sub
stance-abuse policies or risk losing their
housing?
Please remember that these young
women are vibrant and diverse individuals.
I hey are also a part ol the "undergraduate
population" that is in need of housing on
this campus. What many have forgotten is
that granting the Pi Phi's housing — no
matter where — still makes a dent in the
housing crunch campus-wide. I don't
know about you, but I'd take a room in
Manzanita Park over any of the potential Pi
Phi houses any clay. Are those opposed to
Camarillo's decision really concerned with
the scarcity of desirable housing? Or are
they using this decision to voice their nar
row-minded opinions about this organiza
tion in particular?
Even though I pledged Pi Phi in 1991, I
worked my way through school as a bash
er, drove a beat up Subaru Justy and spent
15 hours a week tutoring kids from Fast
Palo Alto. Being a Pi Phi did not make me
"slender," my Subaru did not magically
transform into a BMW convertible, and I
still had only $30 in my checking account.
Many of the women who I still call my sis
ters were in very similar situations. I won't
lie to you. A few in our midst were privi
leged, but the sorority gave me a chance to
know these girls for who they were, not
who their parents were.
I encourage Dan Ilsia, Sally Madsen
and the like to open their minds just a little
bit and make the same eflort to get to know
their fellow undergraduates — Greek and
non-Greek alike — before they go
begrudging them a hard-won victory.

They might begin by reaching out to the
people they live with in their very own res
idences.

First of all, let me make myself very dear
when I say that I think that if there are
housed fraternities, then there must be
housed sororities. I congratulate the Pi
Phis, and I entourage them to get whatev
er bouse they can.
This is my message to the residents and
bouse stalls ol the lour houses that might
be given to the Pi Phis next year: there is
not much you can do about it.
I lere is the fact: one bouse will be gone
next year. It may be one of the lour that are
already being considered, and it may be
another one. You have very little say in the
matter. The Pi Phis have very little say in
the matter. Jane (lamarillo has all of the say
in the matter.
Let us look .it what happened two years
ago when Alpha Sig and ATO were given
to the Kappa Alpha 1 betas and the Delta
Delta Delta. At the time, I was the resident
assistant at Alpha Sig. Both houses drew
well. So to say that you will not lose your
bouse because it draws well carries little
weight with the Office of Residential Fdu
cation. People will want to live on the Row
whether your house is there or not. Both
houses were in Cowell Cluster, far from
campus, far from any other Greek house.
Plus, each bouse held 53 residents.
When I spoke to the I betas and the I ri
Delts at the time, they were not happy to be
given Alpha Sig and ATO because it was
Cowell and because the houses were bigger
than what they bad asked lor. When it
comes to which house lias more tradition,
alumni involvement or passion, I can guar
antee that none of these houses come dose
to Alpha Sig.
I lived in Bob my sophomore year. Not
even close. I clo not mean to get into a piss
ing contest over whose house is better or
over whether my dad can Ix-at up your
dad. My point is simply that none of this
matters to Camarillo.
l lie official reason that I was given
about why Alpha Sig was chosen over other
houses was that the Row Office decided
that they were not getting enough commu
nication from the house staff. I can say for
a fact that they were right. We did not com
municate as much as we should have.
Whether that justifies throwing away 20
years of Alpha Sig traditions is debatable.
Whether this was tlu- real reason for their
decision, I cannot say.
So what can you do? If I lived in a Row
house (any Row house), I would lx- in as
much contact with the Row Office as possi

ble. You might be able to get the people to
whom Gamarillo actually listens on your
side. As far as how to get your message
across to Gamarillo, I have no idea.
You are fighting a lost battle. II it makes
you feel good to continue to light, than
more power to you. In my opinion, howev
er, most of what you say will lall on deaf
ears. The only way to speak to the Univer
sity is through money. Alter I leave here,
this University will never see another dime
from me.
II enough people make thai clear,
maybe things will change. Maybe they
won't.

I was dismayed to read about the Office
of Residential Education's choices for Mous
ing the Pi Phis next year. Whatever the
merits of housing more (1 reeks at Stanford,
there is no way that the University can jus
tify housing a closed society in any of the
four residences listed in Wednesday's
Daily. Three of these houses are all two
room doubles and are consequently very
popular with upperdassinen; Bob has been
a top (hawing residence since belore I
arrived on campus.
My suggestion is that you put the I'i Phis
in the old Delta Kappa Epsilon (I)kE)
house. I his house is Americans with Dis
abilities Act (ADA) compliant, has only one
two-room double, is not neat any ol the
other ('.reek houses and draws much worse
relative to Bob, Narnia, Whitman or (>8()
Eomita. Alternatively, you could put them
in the old Taxi house or Durand.
I was lucky enough to have had one
year on the Row in the old DKE house, and
then one in Narnia, which is the old Dell
house. I feel that I speak with considerable
personal experience in this matter. With
due respect to my many friends in Greek
organizations, including the Pi Phis, I am
completely ballled as to why the University
thinks it is appropriate to give more of the
prime housing on campus to groups whose
selection procedures are a) restricted by
gender to half of the underclass population
and b) arbitrary and subjective at best. The
rest of us receive housing based on random
lottery; why should members of these
groups be in such a privileged position?
1 value having housed Greeks on cam
pus because I think they do add something
to the campus community. Enough is
enough however: the University needs to
stop giving away popular housing picks —
and houses that common sense suggests will
lx- popular after Gapital Improvement Plan
(GIP) (e.g.. Alpha Sig, ATO) — to Greek
organizations that are "eligible" for housing.
That Res Ed would even consider such a
thing again points to a serious lack of
understanding of the feelings of the non

(ireek undergraduate community.
AMITAV Ml SKA
Si'iiim, Economics
Why is ilit' question of which house to
give up to a sorority being debated only
aliei making a binding decision to award
the house to the Pi Phis? The decision
should take into account two factors: (1)
whether a sorority / fraternity is ready for a
house (based on applications) and (2)
whether there is a house that it is appropri
ate to hand over.
The fact that the decision process cen
ters around the entitlement of fraternity or
sorority to a house suggests to me that the
Office of Residential Education does not
care about the residents who already live in
that house and really enjoy it'. Further
more, il suggests that Res Ed does not like
self-ops, since these are the only types of
houses that can be handed over to Greek
organizations.
Dormitories, theme houses and co-ops
are all exempt because they have "commu
nity." At the rate we're going, given the
number of Greek organizations and self
ops on campus, there won't be many left
before long.
Whitman, and other self-ops, do have
community. They need to be given a for
mal opportunity to defend their houses
from the claws of Res Ed. I'd be willing to
bet that Whitman has more tradition and
spirit than some Greek organizations. If we
need to get (Ireek letters to hold our house,
we will. The University owes it to those of
us who care about our self-ops a chance to
save our houses.

Equitable treatment for Webb Ranch
workers
Wednesday's article ("Webb Ranch
workers get raise") about workers at Webb
Ranch brought attention to their long
standing struggle to establish decent living
and working conditions.
Pen years ago, Webb Ranch workers
made $4.25 an hour, worked seven days a
week and some even had to pay rent to
sleep in their cars. Since gaining union
recognition, their conditions have steadily
improved. The tentative agreement
between the worker's union and the ranch
manager is another (small) step toward
fairness for these workers.
But any sense of 'justice served' that the
article inspired should be tempered by a
closer look at the reality of Webb Ranch
work. Webb Ranch workers must support
their family with extremely low pay and
without any provisions for health care.

Referring to these facts, The Daily article
states: "But that all started to change yes
terday."
I low much really changed on Tuesday?.
Next year, Webb ranch workers will make
between $6.40 and $7.80 an hour — main
workers, making just 65 cents above the
California minimum wage. And for this
small wage increase, workers have been
negotiating with ranch management since
December.
More significantly, Webb Ranch work
ers still lack any medical coverage. As their
letter, which was published last week in
The Daily attests, they are exposed to a
variety of dangers in their job including
poison oak, heat stroke and high-risk falls.
When an emergency strikes, the promise of
affordable health care 500 miles away (in
Tijauna) will be of little use.
As Stanford's general council, Debra
Zuinwalt, has made clear, Stanford has no
legal responsibility to get involved in the
labor conditions of its lessees. And as Man
ager of Property Services Leonie Batkin
affirms, Stanford "won't set any stipula
tions on the ranch when they renew the
lease."
Although this is a long-held University
line, Stanford's responsibility to the greater
community requires more. We only hope
that our University would show greater
commitment to fair and equitable treat
ment of workers on Stanford lands.
In their letter, the workers made very
clear what they want: to "give our children
a better level of life and a better future, so
that they do not have to experience the
same humiliation and exploitation as their
parents."
