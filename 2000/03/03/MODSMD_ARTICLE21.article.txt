# Criticisms of Pi Phi divide Stanford community
## 
### BEN JONES EDITORIAL STAFF COLUMNIST 
1 here has been a great deal ol talk,
both in Ihe Daily and around campus
about this week's decision to house the Pi
Beta Phi sorority beginning next year.

Un fort u nately,
however, the coverage
to date ol this decision
and the general
response on campus
has been one of nega
tivity, directed primar
ily at the sorority.
1 lie decision to
house another Greek
organization this year

and the decision ol which organization to
house is one solely in the hands of the
Greek Housing Review Board, and I will
not attempt to criticize either of these

moves. 1 find fault primarily with the fact
that criticisms have been levied almost
exclusively upon the Pi I'his.
Much of the outcry surrounding this
issue is centered around not the decision
itself to house the sorority, but the
announcement by Residential Education
as to which four houses — 680 Lomita,
Bob, Narnia and W hitman — were being
considered for the Pi Phi house.
Vet, the sorority had absolutely noth
ing to do with the selection of these lour
houses for consideration. In fact, in its
housing proposal, Pi Phi did not request
any certain house to be converted for its
use, but merely provided estimates of the
number of members who would be living
in the house.
I hat decision has been one made sole
ly by the Greek Housing Review Board.
Yes, you can find the decision to consid
er giving these houses to a Greek organi

zation unjust — they are all very popular
houses in the Draw — but, the blame for
this decision, if there is blame at all, does
not lie with the sorority.
I he Greek Housing Review Board
c ompiled this list of houses based on the
criteria for a facility that would best suit
the needs of the sorority. It was, for all
appearances, not a decision to give one
of the premium houses over to a Greek
organization. It was a matter of logis
tics.
The use of negative stereotypes and
slanderous language to characterize the
sorority, whether in letters to The Daily
or in speaking with other students on
campus, only further widens the gap in
the Stanford community. By presenting
the sorority only in a negative light, we
further isolate them during what is an
already extremely contentious time.
I lie honest truth is that the group

requested a house — as all student
groups have the opportunity to do —
and submitted an extremely strong pro
posal outlining the benefits of housing
the sorority. There was no malicious
intent to rob the Draw of another premi
um housing option.
You may or may not have friends or
acquaintances who are in the sorority,
but purposeful name-calling is in no way
going to change the minds of those
deciding on which house to grant the
sorority or improve the situation as a
whole.
The sorority itself, as with other Greek
organizations in general, should not be a
lightning rod for criticism, and does, like
many other student organizations on
campus, contribute a number of positive
things to the Stanford community.
Members of the sorority are involved
in numerous charitable activities on cam

pus and in the surrounding communi
ties, including the Green Oaks Tutoring
Program in East Palo Alto, the Ronald
McDonald House and Project 9865 — a
massive community service undertaking
in Los Angeles to cover a 155 foot oil
tower with floral panels painted by chil
dren in area hospitals.
In addition, Pi Phi provides the Stan
ford community with workshops on top
ics such as women's health and self
defense that are open to sorority mem
bers, and, at times, all members of the
student body.
It, of course, remains to be seen what
the impact of this decision will be on the
Stanford community. No matter the out
come and no matter your feelings on the
recent events, we must all be careful
though in criticizing and labeling mem
bers of that community for actions that
they may not be responsible for.
