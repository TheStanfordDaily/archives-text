## Reversal of Fortune 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
UCLA — college basketball's most storied program — now finds itself in a position once all too
familiar to Stanford: desperately clinging on for the postseason

....
n the fall of 1996, Jarron and Jason
Collins sat down to a recruiting din
ner with then-UCLA head coacn Jim
Harrick and UCLA players Cameron
Dollar and Charles O'Bannon,
among others.
It surely was a time of laughs and
flattery, of two young All-American
high school basKetbafi players being
treated to a night on the town. But that
seemingly innocent little dinner might
have shifted the balance of power in
the Pacific 10 Conference like noth
ing else in the past few years.

Weeks later, I farrick was fired by Athletic Di
rector Peter Dalis lor trying to skirt NCAA
regulations In lying and then covering up the
number oil (lIA players he took to the din
ner. Assistant coach Steve Lavin (above left)
took over and parlaved the opportunity into
what has been almost lour rocky years at the
helm.
Meanwhile, the (lollins twins, who were
deciding between I (I LA and Stanford at the
time, ended up leaving behind the Bruins'
legacy of unparalleled success in Westwood.
Instead thev headed north to Palo Alto,

which lor many years had been a virtual
wasteland on the college basketball scene.
"[The turmoil| was a factor, but other
things contributed to our decision too," Jason
Collins said recently. "We just felt the envi
ronment up here was better lor us."
Their decision was definitely better for

Stanford. Though Jason was hobbled by in
juries his first two seasons, in the brothers'
three years on campus, Stanford has been to
a Final Four, won a Pac-1() Championship
and risen to the top spot in national rankings.
Along with third-ranked Arizona, the Cardi
nal is now considered the cream of the con
ference.
It was not always this way, ofcourse.
I nder the white-haired Wizard of West
wood, the legendary John Wooden, UCIA
won 10 National Championships in 12 sea
sons. Such notables as Gail Goodrich, Walt

Hazzard, Henry Bibby, Bill Wal
ton and perhaps the greatest col
lege basketball player ever, ka
reein Abdul-Jabbar, became
champions under Wooden and
his lamed Pyramid of Success.
Even through Lavin's first
year as coach, the 1996-97 sea
son, the Bruins were the team to
beat. Harrick won the school's
1 Ith national title in 1995, coax
ing Tyus Edney, Ed O'Bannon
and company to a 31-2 record
and a gutty run through the tour
nament. UCLA then won Pac-10
titles under Harrick in 1996 and
Lavin in 1997.
But since then, the Bruins
have fallen on hard times, both
on the court and off. While Lavin
has consistently attracted the na
tion's top players, his results have
left much to be desired.
In 1997, in came Baron Davis,
the Gatorade high school player
of the year, along with the na
tion's No. 2 recruiting class. Lavin

was hailed as a rising young coach certain to
keep UCLA on a winning track.
But after senior Kris Johnson and junior
Jelani McCoy were suspended for allegedly
testing positive for marijuana, the Bruins
struggled, finishing a disappointing third in
the Pac-I() before making a run to the Sweet

1(5.
Last fall, with Davis hack from a knee in
jury and the nation's top-ranked recruiting
class coming to c ampus, hopes w ere sky-high
again. But the homesickness of Jaßon Rush,
the knees of Dan (lad/uric and the team's
maddening inconsistency left it in third place
in the conference.
Again this fall, UCLA showed up high in
the polls, even with Davis' early exit to the
NBA. The New York Times even ranked the
talented Bruins No. I in its season preview.
But in December, Rush, the team's lead
ing returning rebounder, was suspended In

the NCAA for taking inone\ Iroin
an agent and receiving benefits
from an AAU coach while in high
school. Rush will make his return
to the court tomorrow against
Stanford after sitting out a total <>l
24 games.
The Bruins' only constant re
cently has been their inconsisten
cy. This year UCIA has beaten De-
Paul and North Carolina, both
ranked at the time, but lost to Col
orado State, Gonzaga and Wash
ington and squeaked by South
Florida and Pepperdine. I lie Bru
ins' 7-8 record in the r»c-l() is less
than impressive, even though they
have won three straight.
The poor conference perfor
mances, the NCAA Tournament

upsets and the off-court problems
have .ill conspired to make it tough
lor Lavin, especially in the media
circus (>1 1 .os Angeles.
Lavin just tries to laugh oil the
ovet zealous criticism as something
that comes with the territory. But
being the head coach at the most
\isihle college basketball program
in the country is about more than
coaching. It's about having to re
place Harrick, UCLA's second
most successful coach, and Wood
en — called lA's most revered
sports figure by the Los Angeles
rimes — and about keeping one's
job and sanity intact.
"It's like a frog in biology class,"
Lavin saicl. "People like to dissect
everything here. That's just the
nature of the job. But I try to just
let it roll off my back."
Even as Stanford has risen to
unprecedented heights, the level
of scrutiny on the program and

Montgomery has remained rela
tively low. In direct opposition to
UCLA, the Cardinal has consis
tently outperformed expectations
while experiencing no public
problems with the NCAA or with
internal team discipline.
Still, it is difficult to say whether
the two programs' reversal of for
tune is a function of Montgomery
being a better coach running a su
perior program to Lavin's, as much
of the Los Angeles press has taken
to saying, or whether the difference
in performance can be attributed to
UCLA's youth and its supporters'
oversized expectations.
The eleven National Champi
onship banners UCLA owns cer
tainly cast long shadows in Pauley
Pavilion. But three years later, that
single recruiting dinner might cast
an even larger shadow on the pre
sent and future state of Pac-10 su
premacy.
