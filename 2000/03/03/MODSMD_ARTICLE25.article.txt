# Trojans fall hard against Cardinal
## Stanford buries USC under 43 point margin 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
Stanford fans have one last
chance to catch the No. 1 Cardinal
and its three departing seniors
play at home this season.
But with the way Stanford is
playing, expect to see them on
television in the NCAA Tourna
ment for most of the next month.
Stanford (25-1, 14-1 Pacific 10
Conference) won its 13th-straight
game last night by absolutely de
stroying USC, 1 1 1 -68. I he Cardi
nal shot over 58 percent from the
field and 84 percent from the
free-throw line and out-rebound
ed the Trojans by 19. Six players
scored in double figures and all 1 1
healthy players scored as Stan
lord rolled to its highest point
total ever in regulation confer
ence play.
And, with Oregon State's last
second, buzzer-beating, 70-69
win over No. 3 Arizona in Corval
-1 is. Ore., the Cardinal, which has
won its past five games b\ an aver
age margin of 36 points, moved
into sole possession of lirst place
in the Pac-K).
"We're just clicking right now,"
said senior David Moseley, who
finished with 13 points, live re
bounds and three assists.
I low true. I he man who keyed
most of the action was point guard
Mike McDonald, who dished out
nine assists. But the team was in a
giving mood all night, piling up a
total of 25 assists.
"We moved the ball around re
ally well," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery. "All live
guvs were scoring which makes us
pretty tough to stop, and 1
thought Mike's assists were key."
Stanford's defense was similar
ly impressive. It held USC to 37
percent shooting and was I breed
into committing 15 turnovers. Ju
nior forward Brian Scalabrine,
who sat out the second half with a
hip pointer, finished with only
lour points on 2-of-8 shooting.
In tlu- lirst half, USC tried to
kick, it tried to scratch, it tried to
press, it even tried to pull down
Case) |acobsen's shorts. But none
of it was enough.
With the game already well out
of hand with 1:28 left to go in the
lirst half, freshman Casey Jacob
sen took a pass on the right wing
and began to drive towards the
lane. But L SC'sJarvis I inner, sit
ting on the bench in street clothes
behind |acobsen, reached out and
pulled on his shorts as Jacobsen
made 11is move, drawing I,'SC's
second tec hnical foul ol the half.
" I hat was bizarre," said Jacob
sen. who noted that I inner, who
is out for the season with an ankle

injury, made a point of apologiz
ing alter the game. "I've never
seen that before or heard about
anything like that."
Southern California head
coach Henry Bibby also apolo
gized for the incident to Mont
gomery. Bibby, whose team was
embroiled in a postgame scuffle
with Arizona State two weeks ago,
emphasized that Turner's actions
were not encouraged.
"That's totally uncalled for and
uncharacteristic of him to do
that," Bibby said.
I lowever, Bibby made sure to
say that Stanford's dominating
performance was not similarly out
of character.
"They're the No. 1 team in the
country and they are a very, very
good basketball team," he said.
"They are well deserving of that
ranking. They completely took us
out of the game."
That is nothing new for Stan
lord. Since its three-point loss to
Arizona Jan. 8, the Cardinal has
won the last 13 straight games, all
in conference. No one has come
within single digits of Stanford in
those games and onlv I SC came
within 10 points in a 67-57 loss in
early February.
But Jacobsen, who scored a
game-high 23 points, said he was
avoiding looking ahead to the
NCAA Tournament..
"This is a special group." he
said. "This is a special year. We
don't want to miss anything. We
want to experience it all."
That includes tomorrow's
game against I'CLA, the final
home game of the year for what
could potentially be called Stan
lord's finest team in history.
Moseley, who along with Mad
sen <md Celbard will say their
good-byes to Maples Pavilion to
morrow during the pregame Se
nior Night celebrations, said he
was thinking about that final
game on his ride to today's drub
bing.
"On my way, I was listening to
my favorite CI) and I just started
to see the season flash before my
eyes," he said. "1 just wanted to
have this weekend end well.
Tonight was beautiful."
