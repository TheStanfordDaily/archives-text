### MAUREEN MULLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Reentering the rankings this week at No.
25, the Stanford women's basketball team
(18-6, I 1-:* Pacific 10 Conference) looks to
stay atop the conference ibis weekend as it
heads down to Los Angeles for important
games against I CLXand I SC..
The Cardinal is currently tied for the Pat -
10 lead with Oregon (12-4). However, Ari
zona (1 1-4), Oregon State (10-0) and I CI.A
(9-5) are all close behind beading into the
final two weeks of conference play.

Stanford lias some tough competition
ahead. In addition to the Los Angeles games,
the C lardinal hosts No. 20 Arizona on March
9 and Arizona State on March 1 1.
"These are huge games," said sophomore
I .indsay Yamasaki. "Kvery game is a champi
onship game. We're in first now, but if we
lose we can just keep falling and falling."
I he Bruins are coming off a less than stel
lar weekend in Oregon, where they were
swept by the Ducks and the Beavers and con
sequently knocked out of the rankings. After
jumping out to a 12-4 start, UCLA have lost
five of their last eight games.
Stanford defeated UCLA 83-68 in the
teams' first meeting this season at Maples
Pavilion. The Cardinal held 1999 Pac-10
Player of the Year Maylana Martin and
standout post Janae 1 fubbard to a combined

three points as hotli suHered (mil trouble.
Sophomore Bethany Donaphin posted a
team-high 21 points and II rebounds and
sophomore Lauren St. Clair went live-lbr
five from three-point territory enroute to the
victory.
However, the Cardinal has to figure Mar
tin and Hubbard will definitely play a role
this time around.
"We've got to have some of our bigger
players step in," said head coach I ara Van-
Derveer. "Against I CLA you've got to play
great post defense and you've got to re
bound."
Another factor that didn't figure in the
first matchup was the play of I CIA point
guard Krica Come/.. She sat for almost the
entire game due to an in jut \ sustained in
practice. Gomez is currently right behind

Cardinal senior Milena Mores in the l'ac-10
assist standings, and the two could easih be
touted as the conference's two greatest
guards.
Stanford could be without the services of
Iresh man guard Jamie (la rev, who re-aggra
vated a left ankle sprain after the Washing
ton game on Saturday. Carev is currently
second in the l'ac-10 in three-point percent
age behind teammate St. Clair. She is not
practicing with the team this week and her
status is questionable for Friday's game.
If Carey is out, VanDerveer will look for
other players to step up and fill in.

move Sarah [Dimson] to the perimeter. I
