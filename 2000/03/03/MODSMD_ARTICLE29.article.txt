# Is Stanford hoops too good?
## Stanford's dominance is hurting other Pac-10 teams' tournament hopes 
### JIM TANKERSLEY EDITORIAL STAFF 
Like a Imllv on a grade school playground, Stan
ford has spent the last lew weeks popping all the
other kids' bubbles.
With its I I I-OS dismantling of I S( last night,
the Cardinal knocked another Pacific 10 Confer
ence opponent oil the NCAA lournament bubble.
This after a 101-fiO thumping of Calilornia two
weeks ago that all-but eliminated the Bears from
Big Dance contention.
Tomorrow, UCLA brings another bubble pa
rade to town, and a week after that, the Cardinal
could drive the final nail into Arizona State's N1 I
coffin.
Stanford now owns a whopping "M\. l-point aver
age margin of victory over its last live games, and it
hasn't won by less than 10 since tailing to Arizona
Jan. 9.
If you're a voter iu the AP poll, or an LSPN com
mentator, or a member of the NC.AA lournament
selection committee, you re thinking two things
staring at those numbers: Stanford is very good,
and the rest of the Pac-10 north of I ucson . . . isn t.
Thanks largely to the Cardinal's dominance, the
conference may land just three teams (Stanford,
Arizona and Oregon) in the field <>l (i4 this year.
This is a new peak for Mike Montgomery's pro
gram: Stanford lias grow n so good, its hurting the
Pac-10.
"1 used to think years ago," the Cardinal head
coach said after last night s game, when Arizona
beat people by so much, that it was bad for the
league."
When you're the one blowing everybody out,
Montgomery conceded, "it takes some of th;it sting

away." I lojan coach Henry Bibby understandably
disagreed.
" I just don't like to be on the receiving end when
they win like this," Bibby said. "It's like a night
mare. It's like a nightmare you want to end."
But if you're a Stanford fan, who c ares about
Bibby? Who cares, for that matter, about the rest of
the league? Your team is playing great at t he end of
the year, beating the good teams In a lot and the
bad teams by a ton.
While USC looked tired and battered (that's
what playing a six-man rotation throughout the
conference season will do to you) last night, Stan
lord looked like it was playing on a couple weeks'
rest. ( That's what the Washington road trip this
year will do to you.)
Unlike the grind-it-out style that has become the
Stanford stereotype in recent years, the new-look,
run-and-gun Cardinal got out on the break last
night to score a barrage of breakaway baskets.
David Moseley clunked, Casey Jacobsen threw
one down, Jason Collins slammed a couple and
Julius Barnes finished a coast-to-coast drive with a
linger roll to push the team over the century mark.
It's a math class-and-recess contrast with last
year's squad, which dropped lour games clown the
stretch and limped into the tournament. You know
how that story ended.
And though they're enjoying the ride, the Stan
ford coaches and players think it would be a shame
for the Pac-10's 1999-2000 story to end mostly in
the NIT.
" The fact of the matter is, throughout the league
it's very competitive," Montgomery said. "It's a
tough league."
Jacobsen agreed, saying he'd be sorry to see only
three Pac-10 schools in the tournament.
"II that happens," lie said, "I'd be very disap
pointed. To penalize the other teams in the confer
ence who have to play us (and Arizona) . . . lour
times, I don't think that's fair."
