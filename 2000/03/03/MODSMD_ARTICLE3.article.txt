# Russian student leaders visit farm

### DEENA SKOLNICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
During the week of April 5 - 11, Stanford students
can expect to see 40 new faces on campus: 25 Russians
and 1") Americans. These students are being brought
to campus for a week by a new student group dedi
cated to fostering an exchange of ideas between Russ
ian and American college students.
"It's a student-designed project that will bring
Russian and American student leaders together for
the first time to discuss issues and challenges sur
rounding student activism in both countries," said
Cody 1 lan is, a senior and the group's vice-chair of ex
ternal relations.
The group's main concerns are to discuss ideas of
democracy, work on perfecting public service projects
which the student participants can implement at their
own universities, and to create a network of public
service-oriented students in America and Russia.
"There's really nothing like this going on any
where else," said Matt Spence, acoterminal student in

International Policy Studies, who is in charge of the
program.
Spence first conceived the idea of such a program
during the summer after his sophomore year, when
he worked at the National Security Council. As part of
his job, he helped to plan President Clinton's trip to
Russia by thinking of ways he could reach the next
generation of Russian leaders.
"I wanted to set up something of a student gov
ernment exchange [between the United States and
Russia]," he said. "But a lot of Russian universities
don't have a student government."
Spence believed that such an exchange program
could help to set up democratic organizations within
Russian universities and involve Russian students
more actively with their communities. Although there
were originally only five members, the number of in
volved students has since grown to twenty.
Two of the biggest challenges the group faced were
support and funding. Since most international ex-
change programs are organized
by the government or by the ad
ministration, it was difficult for the
student group to find the money it
needed. Funding came from pro
fessors such as Condoleezza Rice,
Coit Blacker, Vice Provost James
Montoya and Vice Provost John
Bravman. The group also re
ceived grants from the Hewelett
foundation and the Packard

Foundation which total $120,000.
Harris stressed the difficulty in
starting this program.
"We thought we'd just go to
Russia and find their student lead
ers and bring them over here, but
they don't exist. They don't have
that culture of student activism on
campus."
The most important part of the
application process for Russian
students was a question about
their own goals: what kind of com
munity service project would they
design for their university? Those
selected were then narrowed

down through an interview
process.
The fifteen American students
in the program were selected by
the same process.
The visiting students will be
housed by Room Hosts in Fresh
man-Sophomore College. After a
day of introduction to the campus,
the service projects available here,
and the surrounding neighbor
hoods, the students will attend lec
tures and panels made up of schol
ars from Stanford and the sur
rounding area on US-Russia rela
tionships and on democracy.

Participants will also attend
workshops to design their own
community service and student
government programs. I hey will
spend a day in San Francisco tour
ing, visiting community service
projects there, and possibly meet
ing with city and county officials.
The group is trying to involve
Stanford students in as many as
pects of the week as possible.
Spence encourages students to at
tend the panels and lectures and to
meet the Russian students on cam
pus. "That's the thing I'm most ex
cited about," he said.
