# Baseball looks for a jumpstart from generous Santa Clara
## Bats will rattle against shaky Bronco pitching 
### BRETT KAUFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With only seven games remain
ing until Pacific 10 Conference play
begins, the No. 2 Cardinal (11-"))
must find some way to ignite its
sputtering offense to support a
pitching staff that is shaping up to
meet, if not exceed, lofty preseason
expectations.
Stanford takes on the Santa
Clara Broncos this weekend for a
three-game series and will attempt
to prime itself for the upcoming
league season. The unorthodox
format of the series will see both the
opener and 112 inale played at Sunken
Diamond while the middle game
will be played at nearby Buck Shaw
Stadium in Santa C '.lata.
Santa Clara looked like an inferi
or opponent earlier in the season,

losing nine of its first 12 games.
However, the Broncos come into
the Stanford series on a hot streak
after winning four straight games to
capture the UNLV / Coors Desert
Classic title in Las Vegas last week
end.
1 he Santa Clara series provides
a perfect opportunity to get the
Cardinal bats going. Bronco pitch
ers have been extremely generous
thus lar, allowing more than eight
runs per game this season.
I lie lack of offense "would be
easier to correct i! it were one or two
guys, but it's;i lot of guys," said head
coach Mark Marquess. "So it's diffi
cult to put your finger on a single
thing."
I'he heart of Stanford's lineup
has been extremely inconsistent,
unable to produce when the team
needs it most. I he powerful trio of
veterans, composed of seniors John
(..ill and Kclmund Mutli and junior
Joe Borchard, has not lived up to its
potential so far, combining for just
six home runs in 185 at bats.

"Obviously it's been very frus
trating for us, and we're not per
forming the way we need to," Bor
chard said.
However, the Broncos have had
fits attempting to keep scores low in
the young season, meaning that the
Cardinal power threats must look
to break out of their slow start and

feast on tlu* struggling pitching
stall.
Conversely, Stanford pitching
has excelled behind the arms of its
starters, especially that of junior
Justin Wayne. Wayne's career
mark of 20-1 has not disturbed his
locus on his starts as he has easily
handled opposing hitters this sea

son.
Wayne moved into the starting
rotation's top spot alter junior
Jason Young suffered ;i shoulder
injury in a Feb. I 1 start. Way ne lias
not shown signs of wilting, continu

Stanford will look for a little less talk and a lot more action this weekend against Santa Clara.
