# Volleyball on cruise control
## Weaker Golden Bears and Banana Slugs next 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
After a two-week stretch of bat
tling ranked conference oppo
nents, the No. 14 Stanford men's
volleyball team (7-7, 7-3 Mountain
Pacific Sports federation) will fi
nally be getting a break.
This weekend the (Cardinal will
face two unranked Ba\ Area ri
vals. While the non-conference
matches promise the pressure of
historic rivalries, the\ will also
provide a step down in competi
tion for Stanford, which plavs in a
conference that boasts the top si\
teams in the country.
Tonight the Cardinal ends a
live-game run of home mate lie s as
it faces California (4-1) at Maples
Pavilion. The squad looks to in
crease its three-match winning
streak in which the Cardinal
downed then No. 9 Loyola Mary
mount, No. I") I C-lrvine, and
No. 12 Pacific. Ihe st retc li
bumped Stanford up to lourtli in
the Pacific Division of the Ml'Sf
and placed it back into tlu nation
al rankings.
Cal's Golden Bears are onl\ at
the club level and will therefore
not have the firepower that Stan
lord has had to handle all season.
And even though the ('.ardinal lias
always been able to tame the
Bears, head coach Ruben Nieves is
expecting a good match tonight.
"Cal has a great men's volley
ball tradition," he said, "and the
fact that they're Cal adds intrigue

to ihc conicst. 1 listorically it's been
a real good test lor ns."
(:Â«il Icll 3-0 to Stanford early in
the season at the Id-Santa Bar
bara Collegiate Invitational. The
Bears also bowed to Pacific 3-0, a
team that Stanford sent home last
weekend with a 3-1 loss. Cal has
split wins with I C-Santa Cru/., a
division 111 s<juad and Standard's
second opponent this weekend.
Santa (Irnz (2-8) shouldn't give
the Cardinal much trouble either
as Stanford takes its game on the
road to meet the Banana Slugs to
morrow night. Stanford has only
dropped one game to Santa ( '.i n/
in its past three seasons. I his sea
son the Slugs have fallen to UC-
Sau Diego, San Diego State and
I 'at ilic, all teams that Stanford has
defeated this season.
I his weekend gives Stanford
the perfect opportunity to give
much-needed rest to its starters
and valuable match experience to
its bench.
Making his season debut on the
court w ill be senior captain Josh
I'alacios who has been sidelined
due to a shoulder injury. Because
I'alacios has not regained full
range ol motion or complete
strength in his shoulder, the out
side- hitter will play in the back row
only. ;is libero.
"The first time out you're leery
of being rusty and nervous,"
Nieves said, "but [Josh Palacios]
has lots of reason to be confident.
I expect to see a poised veteran
vollcvball player out there, a guy
who can help us in the stretch run
of our season."
Nieves will sit his kill-leaders,
freshman Clint Toppel (369 sea

son kills), sophomore Marcus Ska
cel (190) and junior Brett Young
berg (134). The break will give
Toppel, who has suffered from a
sore shoulder this season, and
Youngberg, burdened with a back
injury, a chance to recover before
returning to conference play in
three weeks.
This weekend Stanford lias a
chance to prove its depth in a line
up that boasts four freshmen.
Redshirt freshman Setli Ring
has been a strong libero for Stan
lord over the past six matches, but
will shift back to outside hitter this
weekend. Before switching to the
libero position, Ring notched 67
kills for the Cardinal, good
enough for fifth on the team.
Ring will be joined by outside
hitters freshman Will Curtis and
junior Curtis Graham, while
freshman Paul Bocage and either
redshirt freshman Jon Palacios or
112 reshman Kyle Strache will start as
middle blockers. Junior Josh
Lukens will continue to set for
Stanford.
Besides Josh Palacios, each of
the Cardinal's starters this week
end has been an effective contrib
utor this season. Most recently,
Graham and Bocage came off the
bench against Pacific and each
played important roles in Stan
dard's upset victory. Nieves is con
fident that this starting lineup has
what it takes to succeed this week
end.
"We want to continue playing
at a high level," Nieves said.
"Kven though the personnel will
be different, we want to strive for
not having our level of play drop
off."


Freshman Jon
Palacios rains
a quick spike
down on Pacif
ic's defense.
Stanford will
take a break
from ranked
competition this
weekend to
play Cal and
UC-Santa
Cruz.
