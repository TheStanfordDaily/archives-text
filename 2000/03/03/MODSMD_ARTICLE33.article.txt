# Swim domination on the line
## Pac-10 streak stands at 18 straight titles 
### KELLIE WIGINTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
From before the time some of
the members of Stanford men's
swim team were born, the Cardi
nal has been winning the Pacific
-10 Conference Championship
meet.
Sixth-ranked Stanford looks to
keep the streak going (or yet an
other year this weekend at the
King County Aquatics Center in
Federal Way, Wash.
With 18 consecutive conference
titles under their belts, the Cardi
nal men (6-3, 3-1 Pac-10) hold the
most impressive winning streak in
the history of any sport in the Pac
-10. The Cardinal will be joined by
each of the other Pac-10 power
houses, including No. 2 Arizona,
No. 4 California, No. 5 USC, No.
1 1 Arizona State and unranked
Washington.
Considering the outcomes of
the regular season conference
dual meets, Stanford's odds of con
tinuing the streak are good. With
the exception of a heartbreaker
against Arizona, the Cardinal has
defeated each Pac-10 rival it has
been up against so far this season.
This includes a 128-115 upset over
USC, along with an even sweeter
137-106 upset against Cal.
With momentum from the Cal
meet still carrying them, the Car
dinal swimmers are expecting to
make another impressive showing
this weekend.
"We have the most momentum

right now, compared to the other
teams," said junior Ail-American
Anthony Robinson. "The win
[against Cal] took the wind out of
their sails and gave us confidence
and excitement going into the Pac
-10s."
Senior co-captain Kurt Spenser
agrees.
"This winning streak is not
something that anyone here wants
to see die," he said. "These last two
wins over Cal and USC have given
us a ton of momentum."
All-Americans Rob Canales,
Adam Messner, Glenn Counts,
Steven Brown and Robinson pro
vide the team with needed experi
ence, while freshmen Randall Bal
and John Waters should continue
to bring a spark with their speed.
Robinson, the defending Pac
-10 champion in the 100-meter
breaststroke, will be looking to de
fend his individual title as well as
the overall Conference title.
The Cardinal has dominated a
number of events in the recent his
tory of the Pac-10 championships.
A Stanford swimmer has won the
100-meter breaststroke for each of
the last nine years, the 100-meter
butterfly for the last five years, and
both the 200-meter medley relay
and the 400-meter free relay have
belonged to the Cardinal for the
past eight years.
The diving portion of the men's
Pac-10 championships took place a
week ago, along with the women's
swim meet. Senior Mark Michelin
and freshman Gavin Olmstead
made a good showing, giving Stan
ford 75 points going into this
weekend's meet. Michelin placed
third on the platform, as well as

sixth on the 3-meter dive and
tenth on the 1-meter dive. (Jim
stead also contributed, finishing
fifth on the 1 -meter, sixth the plat
form and seventh on the 3-meter.
The diving scores put Stanford
in fourth place going into the swim
meet. Arizona begins with 100
points, just a point ahead of Ari
zona State. Cal is just ahead of
Stanford with 90 points, while
L'SC: trails at 56 points.
"We're a young team that's
been maturing over the course of
the season," said Spenser. "We're
definitely a championship-style
team."
