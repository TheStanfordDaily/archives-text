### ALLI WIDMAN 
As winter quarter comes to a close and the weath
er gets warmer, a great ski season comes to an end.
But for Stanford's top ski racers, the season will not
truly be over until just before spring break. Nationals
at Loon Mountain, New Hampshire, will take place
March 9-11.
The team, led by coach Daniel Sheinberg, male
captain Jon Kait and female captain Renee Gold
schmid, lias been working hard since early fall. Some
extremely dedicated racers also trained in summer
ski camps at Mt. Hood or Ml. Bachelor in Oregon.
l he team first got on snow together after Christ
mas for a week of training camp in Tahoe before the
start of winter quarter. Through January and Febru
ary, the team trained or raced at a different resort in
Tahoe every weekend. The team owns a cabin on the
North Shore and usually races at areas in the vicinity.
Frequented resorts include I lomewood. Squaw Val
ley, Sugar Bowl, and Northstar.
The team has been strong from start to finish. The
first racing weekend of the year was huge for Stan
lord skiers. To kick off the season, they had a giant
slalom race at Alpine Meadows and a slalom at Bore
al.
"It was our first chance to see how we stacked up
against the competition after our winter training
camp," Sheinberg said, "and we learned that we were
right in the thick of things."
The women's team placed first in the slalom, led by
the first-place performance of Goldschmid, who also
won the giant slalom. Seniors Steven Aronowitz and
Jon Kart both had top 5 finishes that weekend.

The team showed a strong performance every
weekend. However, this past weekend takes the
prize. The team competed extremely well in the re
gional championships.
"Both the men's and women's team turned in
strong performances with the season on the line,"
Sheinberg said.
The women's team placed third in the slalom and
fourth in the giant slalom to finish third overall in the
division. I he men's team placed fourth in both events
to finish fourth overall.
Although only the top two women's and men's
teams in each region qualify for team nationals, Stan
lord skiers took both of the individual qualifying
spots for nationals.
Aronowitz, who took eighth in slalom and 10th in
giant slalom earned a spot, and Kart s ninth place fin
ish in the giant slalom and 10th in the slalom earned
him the first alternate spot to nationals.
Goldschmid, who placed sixth in slalom and a sev
enth in giant slalom also earned a spot to compete but
will not compete in nationals because they take- place
during dead week.
The men's giant slalom final will take place on
March 9 and the slalom will be on Marc h 11 . Steven
hopes to finish in the top 30 in each event and the top
25 overall.
This will be Steven's first time rac ing at nationals.
"It can be a little intimidating to see so many good
skiers in one place, but it's also a great opportunity to
compete," Sheinberg said. "I have a lot of confidence
that Steven will rise to the occasion and finish his col
legiate racing on a high note."
