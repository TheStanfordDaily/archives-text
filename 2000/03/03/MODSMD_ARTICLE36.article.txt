# Bears, Devils bring acrobatics
## Card fights to remain among nations top 12 
### SCOTT FINKELSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
After having back-to-back away
meets 400 miles apart last week,
this weekend's home meet should
be a walk in the park for the No. 1
Stanford men's gymnastics team.
The Cardinal (()-(>, (>-f> Moun
tain Pacific Sports federation) w ill
host No. 8 California and No. 21
Arizona State in its final home
meet of the season tomorrow at
Burnham Pavilion.
Stanford has defeated the Wild
cats twice this year but lias fallen to
the Bears in each of its four
matchups.
"Cal has looked very solid this
year," said junior Jason Biltz.
"They hit their routines consis
tently to earn their high [national]
ranking."
Beating Cal, however desirable,
is not Stanford's goal for this week
end's competition. The Cardinal
needs a successful outcome at this
meet to increase its chances of
qualifying for the NCAA Champi
onships.
Under the newly revised quali
fication procedures, the top 12

teams in the nation, ranked by the
average of each team's highest
home score and two highest away
scores, qualify to compete at
NCAAs.
Stanford is currently ranked
thirteenth, just tenths of a point
behind No. 12 University of Illi
nois - Chicago and a mere two
points behind Cal.
"We can still make it [to
NCAAs]," said junior co-captain
Rico Andrade. "All we need to do
is perlorm clean gymnastics and
hit our routines."
In order to post a high team
store, the Cardinal will look to se
nior All-Ainerican Jason katsam
pes to set the tone on all six events.
Katsampes is currently ranked
21th nationally in the all-around.
Senior co-captain Craig Nesbitt
looks to continue his consistent
ways this weekend. Nesbitt has
been particularly solid on the vault
this season, posting scores above
9.5 in his last tour meets. Coming
off a wrist injury, Nesbitt may be
able to help out on even more
events this weekend.
Other key players for the Car
dinal include Andrade and Biltz.
Both gyn asts have found confi
dence and greater consistency this
season and have contributed to the
team score effectively in every

meet. Stanford will count on
strong scores from this dynamic
duo on floor, rings, parallel bars
and on high bar, in particular.
Strong performances from
sophomore David Durante will
also be essential to the Cardinal's
success this weekend. Durante's
clean lines and near-perfect exe
cution could earn him high marks
on pommel horse, parallel bars
and high bar.
Freshman Marshall Erwin has
been outstanding on rings this sea
son, as he is ranked ninth nation
ally in the event. Stanford will
need another high score from
Erwin on rings this weekend.
Also essential to the Cardinal ef
fort will be junior Reshad Garan
on rings, junior Bobby Osterhoff
on pommel horse and sopho
mores Adam and Brandon
Berkenbile on floor,
"The success of this weekend
will depend on us giving a com
plete team effort on every event,"
Andrade said.
Even though the season has
been rough thus far, the Cardinal
gymnasts continue to train hard
and fully intend to qualify to
NCAAs. '
"We have two meets left [before
NCAAs]," Nesbitt said. "We need
to pull it all together right now."
