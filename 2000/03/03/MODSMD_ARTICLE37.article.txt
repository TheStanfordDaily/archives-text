## 
### CHRISTOPHER LYLE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Looking outside during the
past few days, it is hard to stay in
doors. The clouds and rain are
leaving Stanford just in time as
the track and field teams head
outside for the first meet of the
season.
The Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
dual meet this Saturday marks
the beginning of the outdoor sea
son. Up to this point, the team
has been running indoor meets
throughout the country. This
weekend will also be the first time
that this season that the Cardinal
will run at home at Cobb Track
and Angell Field.
Stanford will use the success of
the indoor meets as a spring
board into the outdoor season
which will end with the NCAA
Outdoor Championships May 31
to June 3.
"Our main goal is the outdoor
season," head coach Vin Lanan
na said. "We don't put a whole lot
of emphasis on the indoor season
at all."
The indoor season, however,
is not entirely over. Several mem
bers the team will sit out this meet

to prepare for the NCAA Indoor
Championships March 10-11 in
Fayetteville, Arkansas. Athletes
who qualified for the NCAA In
doors will begin their outdoor
season March 25 with the Stan
forld Invitational.
The Cal Poly meet will also
feature some great athletes. In
the 10,000-meter run, Stanford
senior Brad Hauser, a three-time
NCAA Champion and member
of the USA World Champi
onship Team, will lead the pack.
Freshmen Adam Tenforde, and
Andrew Hill, a Cross Country
World Championship qualifier,
will also run in the 10,000.
"This will be my first time to
run the 10,000," Tenforde said.
"I am just going to go out and
hang with Brad for as long as I
can."
The women will be loading up
in the 1,500-meter run. Six Car
dinal women will compete in the
event, including sophomore
Laura Turner, junior Adrienne
Dubin, freshmen Colleen Flaher
ty and Malindi Elmore and se
niors Kerry Dugan and Mary
Huang.
Competition for the Cardinal
this weekend will include Cal

Poly-San Luis Obispo and some
members of the Nike Farm
Team. The running events will
begin with the 1 (),()()() at noon,
and the field events with the
hammer at 12:45 p.m.
