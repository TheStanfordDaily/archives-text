# Gymnasts roam onto Nittany Lion turf
## Women at Penn State for final season meet of regular season 
### KATIE FITZPATRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Kverything seems to finally
have come together for the No. 8
Stanford women's gymnastics
team (H-2, 5-2 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) as it heads for an east-coast
matchup with No. 17 Penn State.
The long trip will be the first in
some time for the (Cardinal, which
normally competes in the west
during the season.
"I think the greatest part of
competing in a new region, loca
tion and environment is allowing
new parts of the nation to witness
the improvements Stanford is
making in their skills and compet
itive nature,'' said senior co-cap
tain Sarah I larding.
Stanford will have some famil
iarity with Penn State. Assistant
coach Rene Lyst Cook is a Penn
State alumnus and coached at
IVnn State before coming to Stan
lord. Lyst Cook has been working
hard to prepare the team.

"The exposure is great. [Perm
State] is also hosting Regionals so
there is a chance we could be
going there again," saicl Lyst
Cook.
Despite the grueling schedule
of late — the Cardinal has com
peted four times in the last two
weeks — gymnasts emphasize that
they are not fatigued.
"1 think everyone's really gain
ing more energy from the past
couple of competitions that we
have done really well at," said
sophomore Kristin Jensen.
Harding agreed.
' We've been training in a smart
fashion, trying to lessen the num
bers and increase both quality and
efficiency in our practices. At this
point in the season, it's more im
portant to be mentally than physi
cally prepared," said 1 larding.
With Stanford's recent success
es, il shouldn't need much help to
beat the Nittany Lions. Senior All-
American Larissa Fontaine is cur
rently ranked first in the nation in
the all-around, second in vault,
and third on floor. Other Stanford
gymnasts ranked nationally are
sophomore katy 1 let bel t (17t 1 i on
beam) and Harding (22nd on
floor).
Joining Fontaine in the all

around should be junior Jennifer
Exaltacion. While not fully recov
ered from a back, injury, Exalta
cion should be healthy enough to
return to the lineup.
II Exaltacion is not available,
look lor Jensen to step up for the
Cardinal again. Last weekend,
Jensen competed all-around for
the first time in her career, total
ing an impressive 38.5.
Junior Jenny Wilson also in
creased her contribution last
weekend, returning to the vault
lineup. Wilson, whose best event is
vault, should bolster the Stanford
lineup which currently lacks
depth.
Freshmen Alissa Cooper and
kelsey Stillinger will also con
tribute to the Stanford vaulting
lineup. (looper, in addition to her
fine bar performance, has been a
strong performer for Stanford all
year. Stillinger, whose best event is
beam, has recently been compet
ing a more difficult vault and is
working 011 perfecting it.
Although the team will be com
peting 011 the other side of the
country, the meet will be a chance
lot family, 112 riends, alumni, and re
cruits to see it in action. Approxi
mately half the team and most ol
next year's incoming freshman

are from the east coast.
"We're very excited to bring the
West Coast style to the east," said
Fontaine.
