# Casper delivers final address

### NINA HOLLY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
University President Gerhard
Casper gave his final State of the
University Address in Kresge Au
ditorium at 4:15 p.m. yesterday, to
an audience of 250 University
community members.
The speech title was "Transi
tions and Endurances," with a
focus on the changes that Casper
had seen during his eight-year
term as Stanford's president.
In the speech, he encouraged
those associated with Stanford not
to be complacent about the Uni
versity's prestige.
"We need to assure with vigi
lance that we do not stand still. 1
certainly owe much to many in my
efforts to concern myself with vir
tually every aspect of the Universi
ty, from undergraduate to gradu
ate, from classics to bioengineering
Casper emphasized efforts to

maintain Stanford's attractiveness
to potential students and faculty,
specifically mentioning housing
availability and faculty appoint
ments as two major issues.
On the housing issue, Casper
said that "... the vitality of the
University, and, for that matter,
the state, depends on the quality of
faculty and students that we re
cruit. They need to be housed, but
they also need the research and
teaching facilities that will keep the
University at the frontier."
Faculty appointments, Casper
stressed, were another challenge
to be overcome. "Sometimes 1
wonder that we manage to make
any faculty appointments at all. As
the market, and it is not just the
housing market, makes our com
petitive situation worse, we should
at least be nimble and creative in
the pursuit of faculty. I strongly
believe that we can be that without
any sacrifice in quality."

University President Gerhard Casper delivered his
final State of the University address yesterday, speak
ing about housing, faculty appointments and the rep
utation of the University. He also spoke about a grant
to the Stanford Humanities Center, which woula pro
vide three more years of presidential lectures and
symposia. Casper will also speak at the University's
Commencement in June.
Another way of maintaining the
University's competitiveness,
Casper emphasized, was Stan
ford's commitment to affirmative
action.
"Barriers continue to exist in
society and, therefore, affirmative
action asks us to cast our net more
widely to broaden the competition
and to engage in more active ef
forts for locating and recruiting
applicants."
"To the extent to which 1 per
sonally make appointments to

leadership positions, I have cer
tainly cast my net in atypical ways
and, I believe, this has benefited
the overall quality of the Universi
ty's leadership team. There has
been no glass ceiling."
I he importance of the human
ities at Stanford were a major
theme for Casper, who empha
sized their importance in bis 1997
book, "Clares of the University."
Casper spoke of several humani
ties grants that he bad instituted or
perpetuated during his tenure as
president.
"I have made a new grant, this
time to the Stanford Humanities
Center, for three more years of
presidential lectures and sym
posia," be said.

"In addition, I shall provide
endowment funds to create fifth
year dissertation fellowships in
the humanities so that by the aca
demic year 2002-03 we will have
added 20 such fellowships. Final
ly, to ensure a critical mass in
those departments hardest hit by
the small number of full fellow
ships currently available, the
Provost and 1 will offer a modest
number of tuition-only fellow
ships in tht* humanities and social
sciences."
"Departments would be expect
ed to fund the stipend going to a
student's living expenses through
gifts or other local resources.
These fellowships will be available
to students who are presently

being recruited for the coming
academic year."
Casper's speech ended on an
emotional note, as he closed with a
thanks to his wile, Regina. He re
ceived a full standing ovation,
which he jokingly ended by
pounding a gavel.
After the speech, Mathematics
doctoral student Michael
Grueneberg said that many of
Casper's themes resonated with
him. "The housing factor is defi
nitely a point of decision for stu
dents and faculty coming to Stan
ford," he said. "Also, it's difficult
for departments to hire even well
known faculty because of the bu
reaucracy. I think it's good that
Casper recognizes that."
