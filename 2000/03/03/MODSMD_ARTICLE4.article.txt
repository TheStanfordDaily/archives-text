### NINA HOLLY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
University President Gerhard
Casper gave his final State of the
University Address in Kresge Au
ditorium at 4:15 p.m. yesterday, to
an audience of 250 University
community members.
The speech title was "Transi
tions and Endurances," with a
focus on the changes that Casper
had seen during his eight-year
term as Stanford's president.
In the speech, he encouraged
those associated with Stanford not
to be complacent about the Uni
versity's prestige.
"We need to assure with vigi
lance that we do not stand still. 1
certainly owe much to many in my
efforts to concern myself with vir
tually every aspect of the Universi
ty, from undergraduate to gradu
ate, from classics to bioengineering
Casper emphasized efforts to

maintain Stanford's attractiveness
to potential students and faculty,
specifically mentioning housing
availability and faculty appoint
ments as two major issues.
On the housing issue, Casper
said that "... the vitality of the
University, and, for that matter,
the state, depends on the quality of
faculty and students that we re
cruit. They need to be housed, but
they also need the research and
teaching facilities that will keep the
University at the frontier."
Faculty appointments, Casper
stressed, were another challenge
to be overcome. "Sometimes 1
wonder that we manage to make
any faculty appointments at all. As
the market, and it is not just the
housing market, makes our com
petitive situation worse, we should
at least be nimble and creative in
the pursuit of faculty. I strongly
believe that we can be that without
any sacrifice in quality."
