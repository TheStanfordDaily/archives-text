# School choice debate splits parties

### GREG PAGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Super Tuesday, March 7, 15 states will hold Democratic
primaries while 12 will hold Republican primaries.
A major campaign locus for Rep. candidates Sen. John Mc-
Cain and Texas Gov. George W. Bush has been the importance
of school choice. Both support vouchers that would give stu
dents freedom in selecting between public and priv ate primary
and secondary schools.
McCain, a staunch supporter of school choice, has proposed
that funding for charter schools come from gas and sugar sub
sidies.
"Choice and competition are the key to the future of educa
tion in America. Students in America rank at the bottom in most
disciplines such as physics and chemistry. We should try char
ter schools all over America. I would take the gas and oil,
ethanol and sugar subsidies and take that money and put ii into
a test voucher program over three years to be used in every
poor school district in every state in America," said McCain at a
January debate in lowa.
McCain states on his Web site, "|1 believe] school vouchers
should be available to parents in order that they may place their
children in the best learning environment for their particular
needs."
Bush, too, believes in school choice.
When a federal judge suspended a Cleveland voucher pro
gram in August, Bush called the decision, "judicial overreach

with serious casualties â€” Cleveland's disadvantaged school
children. Parents and local communities should have the right
to chart their own path," he said. "If Ohio has decided to give
Cleveland parents a choice of where to spend local education
dollars, that decision should be left to parents, not federal
judges. The court's decision should be reversed."
In his book "A Charge to Keep," Bush writes, "Charter schools
encourage educational entrepreneurs to try innovative meth
ods. They break up the monopoly of one-size-fits-all educa
tion."
Sophomore Sam Abrams said he believes in school choice.
"The recent policy proposals of school choice and vouchers
epitomize the fundamental ideas behind the Republican Party
because they enfranchise communities with choice and discre
tion. Vouchers take advantage of free-market forces and bring
competition into the realm of education," said Abrams.
The Dem. candidates, Vice President A 1 Gore and former
Sen. Bill Bradley both oppose school vouchers. While Core has
always opposed them, Bradley formerly supported the con
cept .
At a Democratic debate in Harlem last month, Bradley ex
plained that he used to advocate parental involvement at the
school board level to those who were frustrated with the state of
urban schools. But reactions were negative.
"I voted to give them a chance with a couple of experiments.
There are now experiments in Milwaukee and in Cleveland,"
