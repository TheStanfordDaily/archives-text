### TOMOKO SAKAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As part of the Capital Improvement
Flan, plans to renovate Stern Dining I (all
this summer are rapidly developing.
"Alter this renovation, I believe Stern
Dining Hall will be substantially better
than FloMo, which currently has a very
high reputation," said Rafi Taherian, assis
tant director and executive chef for Cater
ing / Retail Services.
According to Taherian, who will over
see the majority of the renovation project,
the new Stern will incorporate innovative
features in its dining hall while maintain
ing the murals on the walls.
"One area of the dining hall is modeled
after a similar concept to a cyber cafe,
where students can order smoothies and
gourmet coffee, at an extended counter.
They will be able to book up computers at
dining tables, and we are looking at in
cluding high definition TVs and other
multi-media related equipment to en
hance the overall dining experience," said
Taherian.
The major locus of the renovation will
be on the exhibition of food and the effi
cient use of the entire dining hall.
"Our basic philosophy is to take pro
duction from the back to the liont of the
house. We will emphasize last minute

cooking and serving in front of the stu
dents," said Taherian.
Taherian also intends to resolve fre
quent complaints about the lac k of food va
riety at Stern by effectively utilizing area
and customize certain menus.
"We do have as large a variety of options
at Stern as in any dining hall. But the sad
fact is, ilit* presentation suffers because of
massive, currently unutilized spaces. I bis
renovation is going to centralize the two
current dining halls of North and South,
and make it one big walk-in where stu
dents will be able to select from an un
precedented variety of meal options," lit*
said.
Current plans include the implementa
tion of an extended salad bar, a self-service
pantry and a pizza station.
Another major change is switching to
the a la carte system, in which students pay
by points and not by a prepaid expense
plan, as they currently do in Stern.
In addition, the renovation will comple
ment Late Night by extending its hours of
operation.
Since some plans have not been submit
ted for cost determination yet, the entire
cost for this renovation is still unclear. 1 low
ever, according to Alicia Restrepo, Manag
er of the Capital Improvement Plan, the
project is going to be covered
wholly by the funds of the CIP.
"It's going to be a major face
lift, 112 rom the old style of mass
preparation and produce to the
more contemporary cooked-to
order style," said Ted Preston, one
of the service managers of Stern
Dining I lall. "Hie only thing that's
going to remain after the renova
tion is the mural on the wall."
Past and present Stern resi
dents differed in their opinions
about the renovation.
"I personally think such a huge

sum of money could be used else
where, like building nicer bath
rooms and more recreation facili
ties, like video game arcades, and
pool tables. Most large universities
have them," said sophomore
Major Coleman, who currently
lives in Stern.
"1 hope it creates a more cafe
like atmosphere after the renova
tion. And the quality of food could
always be improved," said fresh
man Tim Kane, also a Stern resi
dent.
"1 never knew they were reno
vating our dining hall," said fresh
man Ben Martinez, suggesting
"more decoration for a friendlier
atmosphere too: right now, it's too
clean and disinfected."
