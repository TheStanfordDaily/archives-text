Commonly Asked Questions
about reducing, reusing, recycling, buying recycled, and composting
Q What happens to all the recyclables collected on campus?
A Once all the recyclables are collected on campus, we bring them to our sorting line and separate the
different types of material. Once we collect enough of a certain material we haul it either to a mill, factory,
or broker who then sells it to a manufacturer who uses the material to make a new product. Glass is made
into fiberglass or glassphalt which is used on surface roads, newspaper and magazines often become new
newspaper and magazines. Mixed paper and corrugated cardboard are used to make the thin liner In corru
gated cardboard or made Into another paperboard product. White paper is used to make new paper.
Aluminum cans become new aluminum cans, car parts, or any other aluminum product. Plastic soda
bottles become new plastic containers, flberfill for sleeping bags, or car parts. Steel Is made Into new steel
products. All the material we collect finds a new home as a new product!
Q How many pounds of trash does the
average American produce each year?
A According to the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, in 1995 the average
American discarded approximately 1600
pounds per year or 4.4 pounds of garbage per
day. In the year 2000, the EPA expects the
number to go up to 4.5 pounds of garbage
per person per day.
Q What are the key benefits to recycling paper?
A Paper recycling reduces the need for raw materials and
uses less energy than producing new paper with virgin
material. A study by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency showed that for every ton of recycled paper we use
instead of virgin paper, we save 4100 kilowatt hours of
energy (that's enough to power the average home for six
months), conserve 7000 gallons of water, and keep 60
pounds of pollutants out of the air. Paper makes up
approximately 38% of the U.S. solid waste so recycling It
would significantly reduce our solid waste.
