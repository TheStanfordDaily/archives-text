Super-Baboons Escape Lab
Brain-enhancement study halted —
baboons make a break for car sale
It doesn't take a genius to know that
the Corporate Motors Car Sale is one smart
way to buy a ear, says lab technician Harry
Yapc. "The baboons are undoubtedly getting
pre-approved car loans from Stanford Federal
Credit Union then heading for the sale. We
feel we can intercept them along that route." .
Although the baboons have received
brain enhancement that gives them intelli
gence equivalent to a co-term EE, the lab
reports that they still drive
like.. we 11,.. baboons.
It is speculated that the baboons are
hoping to blend with the crowd expected at
the Corporate Motors Car Sale to be held
Saturday, March 18th from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00
p.m. at 1500 Page Mill Road in Palo Alto.
Because most makes and models of cars will
be represented, lab officials disagree on just
what type of car, truck, van or utility vehicle
will be preferred by the primates.
" They will go for luxury—maybe a
I.exits, Infini.ti," suggests Dr. Howell R Monkey.
"I'm guessing something more sporty
like a BMW or Honda says Igor Rilla.
"Don't forget, these are super-baboons.
I'd put my money on an economy import or
an SIIV," contends Harry Yape.
When pressed, the lab admits this is not
the first escape."lt's nothing to be alarmed

about, but there are probably a few
super-baboons living in the dorms
and attending classes right now."
If anyone has information
regarding the super-baboons, please
contact the closest authority figure.
