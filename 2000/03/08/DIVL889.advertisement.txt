▲"The Insider"
▲ "The Sixth Sense"
Randy
■ Who will win: Dreamwork s
"American Beauty," that Goliath of
critically acclaimed fare from 1999,
looks to he the lilm to heat, given that
its acting, writing and
7~T directing arc .ill superb.
ja( A repeat of last year —
when Miramax's
i | "Shakespeare in Love"
rightfully upset Dream
works' "Saving Private
fc.. I Ryan" — may happen
with Miramax's "The
(licler I louse Rules."
■ Who should win:
,r| My top film of the year,
"The Insider," is a per
sonal hope that commercial success
does not necessarily equate to Oscar
gold. The entire atmosphere of para
noia and corporate sec recy within the
entertainment and cigarette industries
makes for an entertaining, fast-paced
film.
■ Who was overlooked: A hig omis
sion from this category (and all others)
is "Man on the Moon," |im Carrey's
misunderstood epic comedy. "Being
John Malkovich,'' Spike Jonze's wacky
debut effort, has forever changed the
comedy genre. Either " The Sixth
Sense" or "The Cider House Rules,"
both very good movies in their own
right, should have been bypassed by
the voters to make way for these two
comedic gems.
Lauren
■ What will win: "American Beau
ty" was the first film to touch upon
some essential truths about beauty and
life in general, and it did so with abso
lute clarity and (lawlessness. Some
times the best subject matter is literally
next door, and I think everyone can
relate to the film on at least one of its
many layers. The fact that "American
Beauty" was so widely embraced has
renewed my faith in the consciousness
of this country.
■ What should win: I usually root
lor the underdog ("Good Will Hunt
ing" over "Titanic;" "Shakespeare in
Love" over "Saving Private Ryan"), but
there is no difference this year as to
what should win and what will win.
"American Beauty" kicks the ass of
every other film up for the little gold
man, partially because it was nominat
ed into a weak pool of competitors (il
you would go so far as to call them
such).
■ What was overlooked: I have
never been so disappointed with the
academy for its picks of best picture
nonis. Although all three are definiteh
worth seeing, I would replace " The
(lider I louse Rules, I lie
Sixth 'Sense," and"The
jB( Green Mile" with any
draft nunibc rof films t hat were
more powerful, including
1 " Ihe Ilurricane, I lie
n Talented Mr. Ripley,"
k*. " The Matrix" or "Magno
) J Zach
11 ■ What will win:
"American Beauty" had a
lock on this category long before it
picked up the Golden Globe. No sur
prises here.
■ What should win: For its com
pelling artistry, its deconstruct ion of
the American family, its exuberant per
formances, and its masterful direction,
"American Beauty" earned my confi
dent vote.
■ What was overlooked: "T hree
Kings, Ihe Talented Mr. Ripley,"
"Being |ohn Malkovich," "Klection,"
"Toy Story 2," "Sweet and Lowdown,"
"An Ideal Husband," and"The Cradle
Will Rock" were all far superior films
to the critically-acclaimed bore "The
Insider." "Magnolia" especially rivals
"American Beauty" as the year's best
picture. "The Hurricane" was also
snubbed, and rightfully so; I've never
seen such a worthy subject matter
served up with so much schmaltz.
Best Director
▲ Sam Mendes for "American Beauty"
A Spike Jonze for "Being John Malkovic h"
A Lasse Hal Ist mm for"The Cider
1 louse Rules"
A Michael Mann for"The Insider"
A M. Night Shyamalan for"The Sixth
Sense"
Randy
■ Who will win: Il is true an excel
lent movie cannot direct itself, so with
"American Beauty" slated for best pic
ture, common sense dictates Mendes
would get the directorial award for his
artistic flair.
■ Who should win: However, if
"American Beauty" does take top
prize, Jonze should be handed the
direc tor award for his visually distinc
tive and outlandishly clever "Being
|ohn Malkovich."
■ Who was overlooked: Frank
Darabont ("The Green Mile") has once
again been snubbed fora best-director
nominee, coining just four years after
his under-awarded work for"The
Shawshank Redemption," one of the
classics of the '90s.
Lauren
■ Who will win: Theater director
Sam Mendes shows us all who our
daddy is. We are all thirstily looking
forward to his next creation.
■ Who should win: If Mendes had
not created one of my favorite films of
all time, I would vote for the underdog
Spike Jonze. He doesn't stand far
above Mann, who directed " I lie Insid
er," but 1 sincerely hope thai Holly
wood will take more chances on odd-
balls in the years to come.
■ Who was overlooked:
[/ ; Again, I am sad to see
Ki|ft "The Sixth Sense" and
N ll\ "T he Cider House Rules"
IS ' ■ up there, nudging out
more deserving directors
like Norman Jewison for
"The Hurricane," which
I, is not the best film of the
year but certainly does a
' better job than an OK
film about a kid who talks
to ghosts. Mr. Willis, you are no Keyser
Soze. And David O. Russell really sur
prised me by turning a Marky Mark
film about a joke of a war into a pretty
cool movie with "Three Kings," so I
would have been pleased to see him
nominated as well.
Zach
■ Who will win: With the exception
of last year's director's win and best
picture loss for Steven Spielberg's
"Saving Private Ryan," the director of
the Best Picture customarily does not
walk home empty-handed. Stage
turned-film director Sam Mendes will
most likely find himself returning
home with a little gold man on March
26.
■ Who should win: Once again, I
find myself in agreement with the crit
ical consensus. Mendes is fully deserv
ing of the honor.
■ Who was overlooked: In "T he
Green Mile," Frank Darabont ren
dered Stephen King's prison fiction
beautiful once again. And Woody Allen
produced his best work since "Every
body Says I Love You" in "Sweet and
Lowdown." Both were ignored by the
Academy.
Best Actor in a
Leading Role
A Russell Crowe for"The Insider"
A Richard Farnsworth " The Straight
Story"
A Sean Penn for "Sweet and
I .owdown"
A Kevin Spacey for "American Beauty"
A Denzel Washington for
"The 1 lurricane"
Randy
■ Who will win: Washington, win
ner of the Golden Globe, is the favorite
in a tight category — and rightfully so.
His triumphant portrayal of boxer
Rubin "Hurricane" Carter towers over
the competition. I fear Spacey may end
up -riding an "American Beauty" tidal
wave.
■ Who should win: 1 agree (for
once) that the front-runner is the
proper choice, although I have not yet
seen Farnsworth or Penn in their
respective films.
■ Who was overlooked: M\ main
gripe with this.category is the contin
ued snubbing of Jim Carrey, who
should have been nominated for last
year's "The Truman Show" and
declared the winner for this year's
incredible performance as comic Andy
Kaufman in "Man on the Moon." T he
overlooking of' Matt Damon (" I lie Tal
ented Mr. Ripley") and Jim Broadbent
("'Topsy-'l"urvy") are less egregious but
equally surprising.
Lauren
■ Who will win: This, to me, is the
toughest category, with several equally
deserving actors in dramatically differ
- . 1 1 ent roles. I think Crowe
fth ! will win for " The Insider,"
but Washington, Penn,
vnX ij and Spacey pulled oil
Wf remarkable performances
as well and may bring
home the award,
■j { ■ Who should win: As
you can tell by now, I am a
IV, little biased towards any
*ij thing "American Beauty."
Spacey is just SO cool as
Lester Burnham, but I
would be equally pleased if Crowe wins
for his role as Jeffrey Wigancl in "1 he

renewed my faith in the consciousness
of this country.
■ What should win: I usually root
lor the underdog ("Good Will Hunt
ing" over "Titanic;" "Shakespeare in
Love" over "Saving Private Ryan"), but
there is no difference this year as to
what should win and what will win.
"American Beauty" kicks the ass of
every other film up for the little gold
man, partially because it was nominat
ed into a weak pool of competitors (il
you would go so far as to call them
such).
■ What was overlooked: I have
never been so disappointed with the
academy for its picks of best picture
nonis. Although all three are definiteh
worth seeing, I would replace " The
(lider I louse Rules, I lie
Sixth 'Sense," and"The
jB( Green Mile" with any
draft nunibc rof films t hat were
more powerful, including
1 " Ihe Ilurricane, I lie
n Talented Mr. Ripley,"
k*. " The Matrix" or "Magno
) J Zach
11 ■ What will win:
"American Beauty" had a
lock on this category long before it
picked up the Golden Globe. No sur
prises here.
■ What should win: For its com
pelling artistry, its deconstruct ion of
the American family, its exuberant per
formances, and its masterful direction,
"American Beauty" earned my confi
dent vote.
■ What was overlooked: "T hree
Kings, Ihe Talented Mr. Ripley,"
"Being |ohn Malkovich," "Klection,"
"Toy Story 2," "Sweet and Lowdown,"
"An Ideal Husband," and"The Cradle
Will Rock" were all far superior films
to the critically-acclaimed bore "The
Insider." "Magnolia" especially rivals
"American Beauty" as the year's best
picture. "The Hurricane" was also
snubbed, and rightfully so; I've never
seen such a worthy subject matter
served up with so much schmaltz.
Best Director
▲ Sam Mendes for "American Beauty"
A Spike Jonze for "Being John Malkovic h"
A Lasse Hal Ist mm for"The Cider
1 louse Rules"
A Michael Mann for"The Insider"
A M. Night Shyamalan for"The Sixth
Sense"
Randy
■ Who will win: Il is true an excel
lent movie cannot direct itself, so with
"American Beauty" slated for best pic
ture, common sense dictates Mendes
would get the directorial award for his
artistic flair.
■ Who should win: However, if
"American Beauty" does take top
prize, Jonze should be handed the
direc tor award for his visually distinc
tive and outlandishly clever "Being
|ohn Malkovich."
■ Who was overlooked: Frank
Darabont ("The Green Mile") has once
again been snubbed fora best-director
nominee, coining just four years after
his under-awarded work for"The
Shawshank Redemption," one of the
classics of the '90s.
Lauren
■ Who will win: Theater director
Sam Mendes shows us all who our
daddy is. We are all thirstily looking
forward to his next creation.
■ Who should win: If Mendes had
not created one of my favorite films of
all time, I would vote for the underdog
Spike Jonze. He doesn't stand far
above Mann, who directed " I lie Insid
er," but 1 sincerely hope thai Holly
wood will take more chances on odd-
balls in the years to come.
■ Who was overlooked:
[/ ; Again, I am sad to see
Ki|ft "The Sixth Sense" and
N ll\ "T he Cider House Rules"
IS ' ■ up there, nudging out
more deserving directors
like Norman Jewison for
"The Hurricane," which
I, is not the best film of the
year but certainly does a
' better job than an OK
film about a kid who talks
to ghosts. Mr. Willis, you are no Keyser
Soze. And David O. Russell really sur
prised me by turning a Marky Mark
film about a joke of a war into a pretty
cool movie with "Three Kings," so I
would have been pleased to see him
nominated as well.
Zach
■ Who will win: With the exception
of last year's director's win and best
picture loss for Steven Spielberg's
"Saving Private Ryan," the director of
the Best Picture customarily does not
walk home empty-handed. Stage
turned-film director Sam Mendes will
most likely find himself returning
home with a little gold man on March
26.
■ Who should win: Once again, I
find myself in agreement with the crit
ical consensus. Mendes is fully deserv
ing of the honor.
■ Who was overlooked: In "T he
Green Mile," Frank Darabont ren
dered Stephen King's prison fiction
beautiful once again. And Woody Allen
produced his best work since "Every
body Says I Love You" in "Sweet and
Lowdown." Both were ignored by the
Academy.
Best Actor in a
Leading Role
A Russell Crowe for"The Insider"
A Richard Farnsworth " The Straight
Story"
A Sean Penn for "Sweet and
I .owdown"
A Kevin Spacey for "American Beauty"
A Denzel Washington for
"The 1 lurricane"
Randy
■ Who will win: Washington, win
ner of the Golden Globe, is the favorite
in a tight category — and rightfully so.
His triumphant portrayal of boxer
Rubin "Hurricane" Carter towers over
the competition. I fear Spacey may end
up -riding an "American Beauty" tidal
wave.
■ Who should win: 1 agree (for
once) that the front-runner is the
proper choice, although I have not yet
seen Farnsworth or Penn in their
respective films.
■ Who was overlooked: M\ main
gripe with this.category is the contin
ued snubbing of Jim Carrey, who
should have been nominated for last
year's "The Truman Show" and
declared the winner for this year's
incredible performance as comic Andy
Kaufman in "Man on the Moon." T he
overlooking of' Matt Damon (" I lie Tal
ented Mr. Ripley") and Jim Broadbent
("'Topsy-'l"urvy") are less egregious but
equally surprising.
Lauren
■ Who will win: This, to me, is the
toughest category, with several equally
deserving actors in dramatically differ
- . 1 1 ent roles. I think Crowe
fth ! will win for " The Insider,"
but Washington, Penn,
vnX ij and Spacey pulled oil
Wf remarkable performances
as well and may bring
home the award,
■j { ■ Who should win: As
you can tell by now, I am a
IV, little biased towards any
*ij thing "American Beauty."
Spacey is just SO cool as
Lester Burnham, but I
would be equally pleased if Crowe wins
for his role as Jeffrey Wigancl in "1 he

■ Who should win:
,r| My top film of the year,
"The Insider," is a per

does not necessarily equate to Oscar
gold. The entire atmosphere of para

entertainment and cigarette industries
makes for an entertaining, fast-paced
film.
■ Who was overlooked: A hig omis
sion from this category (and all others)

debut effort, has forever changed the
comedy genre. Either " The Sixth

both very good movies in their own

the voters to make way for these two
comedic gems.
