"Man on the Moon" was definitely not
worth $8.25, Jim Carre) did an amaz
ing job — one I believe to be his best
ever — as Andy Kaufman. He put a
tremendous amount of himself into the
role (while, for the first time, not really
acting entirely like himself) and I was
surprised that he got snubbed fora
nomination.
Zach
■ Who will win: This one is a tough
call. My guess is that Richard
Farnsworth is out of the race (I doubt
enough Academy members saw "The
Straight Story." Did you?). Kevin
Spacey is playing the same role he
always does, although he may very well
walk away with Oscar. Russell Crowe
has a chance, but my guess is that
they'll give it to Washington fora fine
performance in a dud of a movie.
■ Who should win: Sean Penn gives
his most touching, energetic, funny and
profound performance ever in "Sweet
and Lowdown." It's a shame the guy
doesn't have a shot.
■ Who was overlooked: |im Carre) s
Andy Kaufman in "Man on the Moon"
was in my mind the best performance
by an actor this year. Matt Damon was
forgotten for his intense and somewhat
disturbing portrayal of an impostor in
" I he Talented Mr. Ripley," and poor
loin I lanks won't be showing up to the
Oscars as a nominee. And what about
Al Pacino, for both "The Insider" and
"Any (liven Sunday?" Forgetaboutit.
Best Actress in a
Leading Role
A Annette Bening for "American
Beauty"
A Janet McTeer lor " 1 utnbleweeds"
A Julianne Moore for " I he Fuel of
the Affair"
A Meryl Streep for "Music of the Heart"
A Hilary Swank for "Boys Don't Cry"
Randy
■ Who will win: Bening is a well
respected actress without any Oscars,
but her performance is too over-the-top
as a repressed, career-driven wife.
■ Who should win: Without a doubt.
Swank's gender-bending role as Bran
don Teen a is awe-inspii ing and incred
ible.
■ Who was overlooked: I am glad
Sarandon didn't grab a nomination foi
"Anywhere but Here," but I am not so
pleased about the lac k of a surprise nod
lor Sarah Polley, the star from "(>o." an
even better update ol the Los \ngeles
dub scene In director Doug Liman
("Swingers").
Lauren
■ Who will win: It's all about Ben
ing. but 1 am not being biased this time,
I swear. A weak actress would have
been completely upstaged by the rest of
the "American Beauty" cast (not to
mention terrified l>\ its screenpla) and
overall brilliance), but Bening took her
role and ran with it. Hell, she Hew to
the moon with it. She doesn't seem to
have much competition from the rest ol
the noms, either.
ad) ■ Who should win: I
! think you can guess m\
lopinion on that one.
V ■ Who was over-
JP| looked: I will not rant
«Jii' and rave about what was
overlooked, but rather
over the fact that Meryl
rStreep seems to have
ff* 1 | j taken home another noni
simply because she is
Meryl. Fora paltry role in
a piece of trash film, she deserves noth
ing but the $10 million they paid her.
And |uliannc Moore did an equal
amount (next to nothing) lor "The Fnd
of I he Affair," where she is either mak
ing love to Ralph Fiennes with her hus
band in the next room or making love
to Ralph Fiennes during the war. Hey,
I would do that lor free.
Zach
■ Who will win: It's about time that
julianne Moore got an Oscar. Unfortu
nately, "The Fnd of the Affair isn't her
Oscar-woithy performance. fry "Mag
nolia" or "An Ideal Husband" for
Moore at hei best. McTeer and Swank
are too unknown. Streep is too well
known. That leaves Bening, and I'm
betting on her.
■ Who should win: This is the year
for Annette Bening to shine. 1 ler multi
layered, complex portrayal of a woman
on the verge was nothing less than
sheer brilliance.
■ Who was overlooked: Emily Wat
son's fine portrayal of Angela
McCourt in "Angela's Ashes" and Reese
Witherspoon's hilarious and deranged
performance in "Election" deserve
recognition.
Best Actress in a
Supporting Role
A Toni Collette for"The Sixth Sense"
A Angelina Jolie for "Girl, Interrupted"
A Catherine Keener lor "Being John
Malkovich"
A Samantha Mqrton for "Sweet and
Lowdown"
A Chloe Sevigny for "Boys Don't Cry"
Randy
■ Who will win: Jolie has never been
one of my favorites, but her spunky
turn as a psychiatric patient has been
gathering the most attention.
■ Who should win: "Boys Don't Cry"
is one difficult film to watch, but the
single thing lifting it above the clouds is
the acting ability of its two leads. I've
alread) raved about Swank, but Sevi
gny deserves attention for her confused
portrayal of a sympathetic Nebraska
girl.
■ Who was overlooked: Collette and
Keener should have exchanged theii
spots for Michele Hicks (dazzling in the
thoughtful con joined-tw ins drama
"Twin Falls Idaho") and Cameron Diaz,
w ho was also forgotten last year for her
role in "There's Something about
Mary" and out-shined her nominated
I co-star Keener as a woman trapped in
I the wrong marriage and body.
'
Lauren
■ Who will win: 1 have not seen all
j the lilms in this category, so 1 feel afraid
I to take this one too seriously. Morton
I and Keener probably have the best
! c hances at the award, from what I have
seen.
■ Who should win: I would sav I oni
Collette, more for her potential than
what she actually did in"The Sixth
Sense." Perhaps 1 am bitter that she got
I ignored for her brilliant role in
"Muriel's Wedding" a few years back.
Zach
■ Who will win: Angelina Jolie seems
to he the favorite in this category, alter
bringing home a Golden Globe. Caro
line Keener might walk off with Mr.
Oscar, since her film probably won't get
noticed in its other two nominated cat
egories. Who has the edge? Probahh
|olie. Ilie Academy seems to love
manic-depressive performances.
■ Who should win: Mv favorites are
I oni Collette's worn-down mother in
" 1 he Sixth Sense" and Samantha Mor
ton's whimsical mute in "Sweet and
Lowdown." II I had my pick, I'd prob
ably go with Morton. Woody Allen has
a way of getting the best out of his per
formers, even when they don't say a
word.
■ Who was overlooked: (ulianne
______ Moore's work in "Mag
tin nolia' was the best per
j lormance of her career.
Charlize I heron and the
!../;! always wonderful
Gwyneth Paltrow were
skunked by the Academy

"The Cider House

Best Actor in a
Supporting Role
A Michael Caine for " I lie Cider
House Rules"
A Tom Cruise for "Magnolia
A Michael Clarke Duncan for
" I lie Green Mile"
A Jude Law lor "The Talented
Mr. Ripley"
A Haley Joel Osment for"The Sixth
Sense"
Randy
■ Who will win: I lie trophy leans
heavily toward Cruise, who lias come
close but has never been singled out by
the Academy. His tension-filled role is
one of many good ones in "Magnolia."
■ Who should win: In a perfect
world without age bias, Osment would
win the award — his turn as the
creeped-out kid with a penchant lor
attrac ting dead people's spirits is death
ly real.
■ Who was overlooked: I am disap
pointed I obey Maguire failed to get
any recognition for not one, but two
solid performances — in the heart
warming dramas "October Sky" and
"T he Cider House Rules."
Lauren
■ Who will win: This depends on
whether the academy will spring for
classically good acting (Michael Caine)
or for talented fresh blood (Tom Cruise
and Jude Law). The buzz is Tommy
Bo) will finally take home a statue for
his mantelpiece, but I wouldn't be sur
prised if Caine gets it. He is arguably
one of the best actors alive.
■ Who should win: Caine did a good
job with his role as an abortion doctor
in " I lie Cider House Rules," but 1
wasn't really moved by him (much less
by the film it self). Cruise should win
just lor the effort lie put into his role in
"Magnolia." Although, 1 think we are
all secretly hoping that Osment will
win, just because it would be cool to
hear his acceptance speech (if they can
actually bring the mic down low
enough).
■ Who was overlooked: Wes Bentley
from "American Beauty." 1 cannot
imagine any other actor doing a better
job of imparling the kind of peaceful
\et intense vibe that this role needed.
He gave us something we have never
seen before. And those eyes! I would
have liked to see Lawrence Fishburne
nominated for"The Matrix," as \yell,
but the academy is usually too holier
than-thou to nominate anything seem
ingly action-centered.
Zach
■ Who will win: This is perhaps the
most competitive category of the race.
All these performances were top-notch.
Michael Caine, Jude Law, and Michael
Clark Duncan are all outstanding
actors, but I think we can narrow it
clown to loin Cruise's psychotic male
chauvinist in "Magnolia" and 11-year
old Haley Joel Osment's spooky "I see
dead people" kid. It could go either
way, but the Academy
/u might want to offer it
®/ Cruise, since he still
gfgkm.i hasn't had a win and this
7 is his third nomination.
| / ■ Who should win: I
say give it to the kid. Not
fej| j only will the acceptance
■ -i* speech be memorable
(rivaling Anna Paquin's),
V ! but he really does deserve
> j the statue for one of the
best performances on the
screen in a long time.
■ Who was overlooked: Delroy
Lindo failed to receive attention for his
heart-breaking turn as an abusive
father in"The C '.ider I louse Rules." Bill
Murra) was once again ignored by the
Academy for his excellent work in "Cra
dle Will Rock." And being John
Malkovich didn't even help the guy get
nominated fora knock-out perfor-
Best Original
Screenplay
A Alan Ball for "American Beauty"
A Charlie Kaufman for "Being John
Malkovich"
A P.T. Anderson for "Magnolia"
A M. Night Shyamalan for"The
Sixth Sense"
A Mike Leigh for "Topsv Turvy"
Randy
■ Who will win: Ball will likeh get
the official kudos lor an elegant and
sharply wilt) script that makes lull use
of roses and Spacey's inflective voice.
■ Who should win: "Magnolia may
suffer because of its length and the
Academy's short attention spans, but
Anderson's work on connecting words,
images and motifs (including a bravado
musical sequence to the Oscar-nomi
nated "Save Me") is a triumph.
■ Who was overlooked: A nomina
tion to reward the Wachowski brothers
for the inventiveness of "The Matrix"
would have been appreciated.
Lauren
■ Who will win: I am predicting a
majoi sweep bv "American Beauty,'
although "Tops) I urvy" and "Magno
lia" also had strong screenplays.
■ Who should win: Anything but
"Sixth Sense" and I will turn oil the I \
and go to sleep happy on March 20th.
But, of course, I will skip bed altogeth
er and go out and part) il "American
Beauty" wins.
Zach
■ Who will win: I'd put my money on
Alan Ball and "American Beauty,"
although all the nominees in the cate
gory were fresh, original, and com
pelling pieces of work.
■ Who should win: "Magnolia" would
be my pick. Paul Thomas Anderson
weaves a group of disparate lives so
admirably you hardly notice t you've
been sitting in the theater for over
three hours.
■ Who was overlooked: Tim Robbins
"Cradle Will Rock," Woody Allen's
"Sweet and Lowdown," David O. Rus
sell's "T hree Kings," and even Trey
Parker and Matt Stone's "South Park:
Bigger, Longer, and Uncut" were other
masterpieces of original sc reenwriting.
Best Adapted
Screenplay
AJohn I rving for"The Cider House
Rules"
A Alexander Payne &c Jim Taylor for
"Election"
A Frank Darabont for "T he Green Mile"
A Michael Mann & Eric Roth "T lie
Insider"
A Anthony Minghella for " I lie
Talented Mr. Ripley"
Randy
■ Who will win: "The Cider House
Rules" has a lyrical and smooth script
adapted by Irving from his own novel.
■ Who should win: The only award
the overly sentimental and predictable
I- - '■-]"The Cider House Rules"
kgrj deserves is for its screen
play, which is a pure testa
ment to the heart and soul.
T/ B Who was overlooked:
1 am fully satisfied with the
iIM live nominees.
J Lauren
s j j ■ Who will win: I think
Eric Roth and Michael
Mann for"The Insider"
and John Irving for " I lie Cider House
Rules" have the strongest shot at the
()scar.
■ Who should win: "The Cider
House Rules" was carried by good act
ing, not by the script. "Election" was
well written, and since it did not get
attention anywhere else, I will root for
it to win. I'd vote for"The Talented
Mr. Ripley." although the word on the
street is that it would have been an even
more powerful film had the screenplay
better interpreted the book.
■ Who was overlooked: "Mansfield
Park" may have deserved a nomina
tion, although I can't say that whole
heartedly since 1 didn't read Jane
Austen's version of the story.
Zach
■ Who will win: John Irving will
clinch this category. It takes a lot of
work to transport a 500-plus page Irv
ing novel to the screen. One simply
needs to take a glance at the adaptation
of "The World According to Garp" to
see what a lesser talent can produce.
■ Who should win: "Election" is one of
fresh, bitingl) funny satires to come out
ol Hollywood in a long time. I'm glad to
see that the Academy decided to throw
Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor a bone
with this nomination, since it was over
looked in so many other categories.
■ Who was overlooked: Alan Park

tion of "Angela's Ashes" kept McCourt's
