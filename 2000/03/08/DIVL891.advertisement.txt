Would you like to take courses given in French that are not about French?
If you already have competence in French, interdisciplinary study is an efficient way to learn more
about your own or a different field of interest to you while keeping up your French at the same
time.
Three courses or sections of interdisciplinary French will be offered Spring Quarter. These are
not language or grammar courses. Rather, they are about other disciplines (music, engineering,
business).
> French Discussion Section of Music 4E (sec. 1). Fantasies and Nightmares: Turn of the
Century Music and Culture in Paris and Vienna <David Code>. Meeting time to be
determined with students at first meeting of course.
> French Discussion Section of Engineering 40 Introductory Electronics <Butrus Khuri-
Yakub>. Meeting time to be determined with students at first meeting of course.
> French 121 C. Advanced Topics in Business French <Marie Marchand> This course is
designed to be of particular interest to GSB students in the MBA program. The course will
include talks by French professionals who will speak about business in Europe. (Tuesday
12:15-1:05. Wednesday 12:30-2:05)
