# Palo Alto Police Dept. launches effort to prevent racial profiling
## 
### CAITRIN McKIERNAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Beginning July 1, the Palo Alto Polite Depart
ment will start collecting ethnicity-based statistics on
all motorists and pedestrians pulled over or
stopped, not only those cited or arrested.
In addition, the department will reemphasi/e re
spect fix constitutional rights through internal dis
cussions and continue "diversity training"
The department also plans a public information
program designed to familiarize the public with why
police stop people, what a person should do if
stopped, and his recourse if lie feels that he has been
treated unfairly.
Police Chief Patrick Dwyer announced his plans
to prevent racial profiling in a Feb. 25 memoran
dum to all police personnel,
Dwyer drafted the plan under the suggestion of
City Manager June Fleming. "I asked the police
chief to develop a policy responding to the concerns
raised about racial profiling," Fleming explained.
Fleming said that the city was responding to a na
tional trend to curb racial profiling, concerns raised
in local Palo Alto papers about racial profiling in
general and the concerns of three or four Palo Alto
residents who spoke with the Human Relations
Committee alleging racial profiling by the Palo Alto
Police Department.
Dwyer stressed that the step was precautionary.
"Periodically, every police department receives
complaints of discrimination and harassment,"
1 )wyer explained."[()urs] was a small number."
In the past year, the police department has re
ceived twoor three complaints of racial profiling, ac
cording to Dwyer.
Roy Clay, who identified himself as the only
African American ever to serve on the Palo Alto City
Council, explains that he has, in the past, met with

the police department about such complaints.
The present and previous police chiefs were
helpful and attentive to the issues raised, he said.
Both Dwyer and Fleming maintain that it is im
portant for residents to believe that they are receiv
ing equal treatment.
"I want to stress that we didn't think that there
were problems," Dwyer said. "We wanted to change
perception."
"If people perceive there is a problem," Fleming
said, echoing Dwyer's sentiment, "perception be
comes reality."
Clay is one such person. "If a police officer pulls
up behind me," he explained, "I start to get out my
license and registration. 1 just assume that he will
find a reason to pull me over."
Dwyer thinks the results will show "that Palo Alto
police officers do not make racial stops."
Clay thinks the study's results will spur a reduc
tion in the number of stops.
"Results are going to show that incidents are very
low," Clay said. "There are going to be fewer inci
dents because the incidents are going to be filed.
That will cause policemen to think."
Community response to the new program, ac
cording to Dwyer, has been "overwhelmingly posi
tive."
"1 commend the Palo Alto Police Department for
what it is doing now," said Clay.
The ACLU has also lauded Palo Alto's decision.
The costs, computer input and minimal labor
costs, Dwyer explains, will be negligible.
Dwyer also received positive feedback from his
officers, although he conceded that, as chief, lie
might not be aware of all the complaints.
The Police Department's announcement conies
in the wake of a nationwide spotlight on racial pro-
