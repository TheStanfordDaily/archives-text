## Germany switches candidate for IMF 
### 
BERLIN (AP) — Germany
pushed a new candidate yester
day to head the International
Monetary Fund alter backing
down from a diplomatic spat with
the United States, which declared
the first nominee unlit tor the
job.
Moist Koehler, 57, head ol the
European Bank lor Reconstruc
tion and Development in Lon
don, was expected to be the new
European Union candidate.
German Deputy Finance Min
ister Gaio Koch-Weser said yes
terday he was pulling out "so as
not to stand in the way oF better
understanding with the United
States."
Germany had argued the
debate over who would succeed
Michel Gamdessus ol France,
who resigned last month, was
really about a disagreement over
IMF reforms.
A 25-year World Bank veter
an, Koch-Weser had been consid
ered by some as unlikely to
streamline the IMF.
That's something that sup
porters and analysts said Koehler
— an unconventional thinker
who worked, in the German
Finance Ministry From 1982-93
— would be able to achieve.
Once referred to by former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl as a
"treasure," Koehler became a
deputy finance minister in 1990
and served as Kohl's envoy at
meetings ol the Group of Seven
industrialized countries.
The IMF candidate had done
critical work in reunifying Ger
many and preparing the nation's
entry into the EU, said former
German Finance Minister Theo
Waigel.
Koehler "has all the require
ments to be qualified for such a
post," Waigel told Hessischer
Rundlunk radio.
Koehler said yesterday that he
told Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder that he enjoys his pre
sent job.
"However, if a broad majority
of shareholders is of the view that
I am needed at the helm of the
IMF, then I would not decline
such a request," he said.
Last week, Koch-Weser won
the most support of three candi
dates in an IMF straw poll with
43 percent, but more than a third
of the IMF board abstained,
including the United States.
A spokesman for the current
EU president, Portuguese Prime
Minister Antonio Guterres, said
the new European candidate
would "certainly" be Koehler.
EU spokesman Norbert
Schwaiger said in Brussels, Bel
gium, that the European coun
tries would formally decide by
Monday.
The Fact that Schroeder, a
Social Democrat, would push a
candidate allied to his main
opposition party demonstrates
how badly he wants to get a Ger
man in a key international post.
Germany has traditionally
deferred to its neighbors in
Europe in seeking such positions,
not wanting to raise historical
fears of an aggressive country.
Koehler had been the first
German to head a significant
international financial institution
when he took over the EBRD in
October 1998.
The bank was set up in 1991 to
promote the transition towards
market-oriented economies in
eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union.
