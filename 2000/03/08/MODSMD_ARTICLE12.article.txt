TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) â€” About
10,000 demonstrators chanting "Shame on
Bush" jammed the state Capitol grounds
yesterday, demanding that Gov. Jeb Bush
back off his plan to ban racial and gender
preferences in university admissions and
state contracting.
Pouring into Tallahassee from around the
country, the demonstrators said they feared
Bush's plan to end affirmative action would
erase the gams blacks and other minorities
have made since the civil rights movement.
Bush has put portions of the plan into
effect through executive order, but other
segments still need legislative approval.
"This is the first step towards resegrega
tion," said the Rev. Timothy McDonald, who
came from Atlanta.
The rally was timed to coincide with the

governor's State of the State address and the
opening of the legislative session.
Police estimated the crowd at 9,000 to
1 1,000 people.
Participants included the Rev. Jesse Jack
son, NAACP President Kvveisi Mlinne, the
Rev. Martin Luther King 111, members of
Congress and state legislators.
Protesters sang "Amazing Grace" and
"We Shall Overcome," and waved signs
reading. "Jeb js Bush League," 'Jeb Crow"
and "Bush Whack." Vicki Whitaker's eight
year-old son Zac carried a sign that read,
"My Mom Needs Affirmative Action."
Whitaker, of Tallahassee, became a first-gen
eration college student when she attended
Florida State University.
"This is oppression, pure and simple," she
said. "It's not about color, it's about oppres

sioii. They art* telling us we have to trust peo
ple will do the light thing, and we know
from our history that will just not happen."
Inside the Capitol, Bush defended the
plan during his address.
"The vast majority of Floridians favor the
elimination of affirmative action programs,"
he said.
I'he Republican governor's One Florida
Plan bans consideration of race and gender
in admissions to the state's 10 public univer
sities and in the awarding of state contracts.
It guarantees college admission to the top
20 percent of each high school graduating
class, provided the students have taken col
lege preparatory classes.
Texas, Washington state and California
have also ended affirmative action in univer
sity admissions.
