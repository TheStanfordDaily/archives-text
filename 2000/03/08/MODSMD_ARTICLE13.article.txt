WASHINGTON (AP) — Com
plaining that Congress "has kept
the American people waiting long
enough," President Clinton
urged lawmakers yesterday to
break an eight-month deadlock
and require background checks
on gun show sales, lint Senate
Republicans reacted cooly to
Clinton's plea.
"We art* poles apart," said Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman
of a House-Senate negotiating
committee charged with writing a
compromise juvenile justice bill
that contains some gun control
provisions.
Clinton called on Congress to
pass a gun bill by the April 20
anniversary of the Columbine
High School slayings a year ago.
"How many people have to get
killed before we do something?"
he asked.
A week after the fatal shooting
of Michigan first-grader Kayla
Rolland, Clinton met privately
with the six-year-old girl's moth
er, Veronica McQueen.
In a television interview earli
er, McQueen said, "I just don't
want to see another parent have
to bury another baby over this,
over something that is pre
ventable, something that is very,
very preventable."
With election-year politics
clouding Congress' agenda, Clin
ton summoned the leaders of the
House-Senate conference com
mittee led by Hatch.
Last year, the Senate voted to
institute 72 hour background
checks on gun show sales, but the
House rejected that provision
when Republicans complained it
was too strict and some
Democrats complained it was too
weak.
