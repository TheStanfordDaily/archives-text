CHAQUALANE, Mozambique (AP) —
Stelio Mabunda and his brother Malic-lane
linger pensively under a tree, waiting for
their mother. She may never come.
Eleven-year-old Stelio and his six-year
old brother last saw their mother nine days
ago, when rising floodwaters forced tlieni
to llee their home in Chokwe. Now they
are among hundreds of Mozambique chil
dren wondering if they will ever see then
parents again.
Aid workers say an unusually high
number of children — as many as half Of
those arriving in camps — were separated
From their parents during the catastrophe.
The Mabunda brothers are among 58
children being cared lor by six Roman
Catholic nuns in Chaqualane, a village 87
miles north of the capital Maputo that is
now temporary home to 40,000 weary
llood survivors.
A month of floods in this southeast
African nation have left hundreds con
firmed dead and an estimated 1 million
people homeless. The Hoods have ebbed,
but aid agency officials expect the death

toll to soar into the thousands.
U.S. airplanes flew over Hood-stricken
areas of Mozambique yesterday, beaming
back video images of marooned people
and demolished terrain.
The information gathered by a Her
cules C-130 was to be passed to aid agen
cies in Maputo, Air Force Col. Gary Sadler
said.
Fhe Mabunda brothers became sepa
rated from their mother after a torrent of
water slammed Chokwe, about 125 miles
northeast of the capital.
"Our mother told us to run away when
the water came," Stelio said. "She was try
ing to gather our tilings together."
Pushing through the deepening tide,
the boys finally reached higher ground.
There was no sign of their mother, and a
truck brought them to Chaqualane, 40
miles away.
Looking at the ground with his hands
folded behind his back, Stelio said yester
day: "We think she is still in Chokwe."
Stelio said his father works in South
Africa, but he did not know where.

Although aid workers in Mozambique are working to reunite children and parents separated
during the flood, their efforts are sometimes unsuccessful.
