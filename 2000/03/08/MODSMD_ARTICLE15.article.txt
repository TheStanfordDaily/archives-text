# Barak and Arafat meet to settle differences in peace efforts

### 
RAM ALLAH, West Hank (AH) â€” Israeli Hriine Minis
ter Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met
late yesterday to try to settle their differences over stalled
peace efforts.
The two met in Savyon, an affluent suburb of Tel Aviv,
a senior Palestinian official said.
Separately, an Israeli official confirmed that the meet
ing had taken place but gave no further details.
President Clinton's top Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross,
arrived in Israel earlier in the day on his second visit to
the region since talks collapsed last month over a dis
agreement on an interim troop withdrawal from the
West Bank.
Ross' return prompted speculation that he was carry

ing new proposals for both sides. The Palestinian official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Ross was to
attend the meeting.
The official said the meeting was spurred by the
peacemaking efforts of Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, who called Arafat and Barak on Monday to
discuss a new package of Egyptian and American ideas.
The proposals include some minor Israeli concessions.
In the land dispute, Palestinians wanted the interim
troop withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank to
include populous suburbs of Jerusalem.
Israel refused, saying discussion of the suburbs should
be undertaken during final-status negotiations on the
city, claimed by both sides as a capital.

Arafat suspended final-status talks last month over the
issue, saying that if lie could not trust Israel on relatively
minor issues, there was no point in negotiating the major
issues.
Earlier yesterday, Arafat told his legislature that he
would declare Palestinian statehood this year, with or
without Israel's consent.
He said Israel must stop procrastinating if it wants to
meet a September deadline fora peace treaty giving it a
say on the terms of statehood.
"This is the moment of truth. The government of
Israel must stop dictating and wasting time," Arafat said.
"We will only accept the implementation of the agree
ments and will settle for nothing less than our full rights."
