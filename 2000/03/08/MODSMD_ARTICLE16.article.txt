## The 						Stanford Daily Humanities, faculty recruitment major issues for next president 
### 
IN HIS FINAL State of the University
address, titled "Transitions and
Changes," University President Gerhard
Casper spoke on a number of changes
witnessed (lining his eight-year term as presi
dent and the issues resulting from those
changes, which, as Casper leaves, will shape
the new president's tenure.
Among the most notable issues discussed by
Casper were the need fora commitment to
the humanities at Stanford, Stanford's grow
ing problem with housing faculty members
due to high local housing costs, the challenge
of attracting high quality faculty, affirmative
action in student selection, and the impor
tance of maintaining the University's overall
prestige.
In addressing the importance of the
humanities at Stanford and his continuing

support for the field, Casper cited grants he
had instituted during his tenure and fellow
ships that he has planned to be launched in
the near future. Among these were 20 fifth
year dissertation fellowships to be added by
the academic year 2002-03 and"a modest
number of tuition-only fellowships in the
humanities and social sciences."
Though admirable in its recognition of the
need for such programs, the University's next
president must take such initiatives a step fur
ther. Not only must more programs of this
type be instituted, there must also be some
administrative effort to support and sustain
these programs in a way that will demonstrate
the University's continuing and expanding
commitment to a quality humanities pro
gram.
Today, many argue that Stanford's "techie"

image not only becomes increasingly estab
lished every day, but also damages both the
reputation of the University's humanities pro
grams and the morale of its humanities stu
dents. Because such views are now present
and, in some cases, prevalent, reviving and
nurturing Stanford's humanities programs —
through funds, faculty appointments, and
other forms of support — must be a top pri
ority for the University's new president.
This leads to the question of attracting
high-quality faculty of all fields to Stanford, a
question that remains closely related to the
dearth of affordable housing in the areas sur
rounding Stanford. Stanford must be able to
recruit world-class faculty to compete with
peer institutions, making this issue a central
one for the new president. Faculty that are
unable to find adequate housing at reasonable

prices within close proximity to Stanford sim
ply cannot be expected to choose Stanford
over other appointments in areas without
such overwhelmingly difficult housing mar
kets.
However, as Casper himself stated,"... the
market, and . . . not just the housing market,
makes our competitive situation worse.
Other factors exist outside housing costs that
have the potential to affect whether or not
high-quality faculty choose Stanford over
other institutions.
Thus, Stanford might be better served by
offering more attractive options in the areas of
health care, salary or even, more simply, visi
ble administrative support of all fields, to
name a few, to compensate for the obstacle
posed by the housing market. For
instance, humanities faculty are more
likely to opt fora position at Stanford
if they perceive a genuine interest on

the part of the University in recruit
ing and retaining quality humanities
(acuity and maintaining a quality
humanities program.
Among the other matters discussed
by (Jasper, that of affirmative action,
though of importance on any cam
pus, may not be a priority for Stan
ford's next president. Over the years,

Stanford's admissions staff lias done
an admirable job of recruiting and
selecting a diverse pool of highly
qualified students. The diversity of
the resulting student body indicates a
degree of success in the goals central
to affirmative action, but this does not
preclude maintaining diversity as an
important issue in the future.

This introduces the final topic of
the University's overall prestige. One
cannot address this matter without
recognizing that the University's
prestige exists as a combination of
successes in many areas, including
academic balance, faculty recruitment
and student body diversity, among a
host of Others.

The University's prestige, though
undoubtedly one ol the most impor
tant larger concerns lor the Universi
ty's long-term success, remains intact
at this stage and, given successes in
the myriad other areas where the
University might improve, will con
tinue to he so fin into the next Uni
versity presidency and beyond.
