# THERE IS NO SPOON
## The
						forbidden extension 
### 
Ah, Dead Week. The quaint click
ety-clack of (1H keyboards. The
angry muttering of Computer
Science majors working in their

own private Bunny
worlds. And the stench
of caffeine, flopsweat
and musty, unread
Green Library journals.
Handing 111 a paper
or project on time is
entirely commendable.
1 try to do it all the
tune. But it definitely
gets hard to choose

between sleep and 10 more pages at S
a.m.
So in light of our upcoming onslaught
of class deadline's, I 'd like to share the one
thing I've learned to do effectively at
Stanford: how to get an extension.
Step One: Size Up Your Professor.
You must first realize that not .ill pro
lessors are exactly the same. (That's
Princeton.) You may, in fact, not even
have to suck up to the professor if your
teaching assistant is the one grading.
First, determine who grades you and
begin brown nosing. Fora good exten
sion, you must start schmoozing at least
two weeks before an assignment is clue.
Now, your average professor is a very
different kind of schmooze than a TA.
Your average professor just wants every

out* in class to under stand tlu- material.
On the whole, your average professor is
excited about your enthusiasm and will
Ik-ihl over backwards (providing it's dur
ing oflice hours) to help you.
When approaching your average pro
lessor, you MUST go to class that week.
Many an extension has been lost when a
professor soon realizes that you didn't
even bother to show up to lecture. You
are, however, not liable for the assigned
reading. Your average professor proba
bly hasn't even read the material recent
ly, so as long as you relate the conversa
tion to something mentioned in class,
your average professor won't even notice.
When talking with a TA, you must first
decide whether your TA falls into the
"wants to be perceived as cool'' camp or
the "just doing this for the stipend" camp.
If your TA falls into the former, you must
lay on the hero-worship awfully thick. 11
your TA is more of the latter category,
they couldn't really care less when you
turn in your paper â€” they've already
deter ruined your grade by the second
week of the quarter. (See related article
on I low to Talk in Section.)
Step Two: Get a Good Excuse.
Professors rarely give out extensions
because you're swamped with work.
Instead, an appropriate excuse/justi
