# THERE IS NO SPOON
## The 						forbidden extension 
### 
Ah, Dead Week. The quaint click
ety-clack of (1H keyboards. The
angry muttering of Computer
Science majors working in their

own private Bunny
worlds. And the stench
of caffeine, flopsweat
and musty, unread
Green Library journals.
Handing 111 a paper
or project on time is
entirely commendable.
1 try to do it all the
tune. But it definitely
gets hard to choose

between sleep and 10 more pages at S
a.m.
So in light of our upcoming onslaught
of class deadline's, I 'd like to share the one
thing I've learned to do effectively at
Stanford: how to get an extension.
Step One: Size Up Your Professor.
You must first realize that not .ill pro
lessors are exactly the same. (That's
Princeton.) You may, in fact, not even
have to suck up to the professor if your
teaching assistant is the one grading.
First, determine who grades you and
begin brown nosing. Fora good exten
sion, you must start schmoozing at least
two weeks before an assignment is clue.
Now, your average professor is a very
different kind of schmooze than a TA.
Your average professor just wants every

out* in class to under stand tlu- material.
On the whole, your average professor is
excited about your enthusiasm and will
Ik-ihl over backwards (providing it's dur
ing oflice hours) to help you.
When approaching your average pro
lessor, you MUST go to class that week.
Many an extension has been lost when a
professor soon realizes that you didn't
even bother to show up to lecture. You
are, however, not liable for the assigned
reading. Your average professor proba
bly hasn't even read the material recent
ly, so as long as you relate the conversa
tion to something mentioned in class,
your average professor won't even notice.
When talking with a TA, you must first
decide whether your TA falls into the
"wants to be perceived as cool'' camp or
the "just doing this for the stipend" camp.
If your TA falls into the former, you must
lay on the hero-worship awfully thick. 11
your TA is more of the latter category,
they couldn't really care less when you
turn in your paper — they've already
deter ruined your grade by the second
week of the quarter. (See related article
on I low to Talk in Section.)
Step Two: Get a Good Excuse.
Professors rarely give out extensions
because you're swamped with work.
Instead, an appropriate excuse/justi


Adrian Khattu

fication is often needed. The nick to get
ting a good excuse is to ground the
exc use in reality. Professors aren't stupid.
I hat s why they're professors.
So no Hying asteroids, gallbladder
removal operations or gratuitous auto
mobile-pedestrian accidents (unless yon
live in Florence Moore Hall). Creativity is
another component to a good excuse.

Your professors have heard more printer
horror stories than Epson Customer
Tech Support. And they've heard about
more rare, degenerative illness diagnoses
than the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention.
Emphasi/e your willingness to make
things right if it wasn't for that pesky
computer crash/ rare stomach flu / nasty
bike accident.
Sincerely apologi/.e for your forgetful
ness (lining your Federal tax audit/
emergency family flight home/room
mate's recent arrest.
And thank them profusely with a tear

hovering in your eye. (See related article
on How to Cry on Command.)
Step Three: Fake Death.
If worse comes to absolute worse, fak
ing death is a perfectly viable option.
Think of the benefits: no spring quarter
tuition bills, your parents will finally
appreciate you, and your roommate will
get straight As.
Many great authors have successfully
faked death. Mark Twain, Shakespeare,
and Elvis, to name just a few.
Faking death, believe it or not, is not as
hard as it sounds. A small explosion in the
lab, reports of a vicious traffic accident on

your way lo Jack in the Box at 4 a.m., a
signed Cowell release stating yon were
eaten by rabid coyotes in the Foothills.
And when yon come back from Tahiti
with your 20-page research paper all fin
ished, won't your professor be surprised!
Now don't get ine wrong. I'm sine that
there are many valid reasons to ask for an
extension. I myself have needed to ask for
one on many an occasion.
But the truth of the matter is we're all
busy people — students and professors
included. Asking fora little more time
isn't the end of the academic world. In
fact, professors should be pleased that

students are spending a little more time
perfecting the work we hand in. (Okay, I
almost got that out with a straight face.)
And, as 1 finish fixing my Epson print
er while struggling with a new hybrid
strain of mononucleosis while being inter
viewed by the Flil about my roommate's
computer habits, I would like to thank all
of my professors in advance for their
complete understanding.
