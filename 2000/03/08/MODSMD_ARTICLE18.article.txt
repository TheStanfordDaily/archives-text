Drivers need to exercise caution near
Florence Moore Hall
This is in response to Shane Sareli's
March i! letter in which he wrote, "Only
idiots get hit by cars." I'd like to thank
him for the absolute brilliance with which
he wrote this letter. 1 have no doubt that
everyone who read it thought to them
selves, "It's about time someone finally
used concrete logic in determining the
source of the Mayfield Avenue accident
problem."
I'm also writing as one of the "idiots"
who got hit by a driver two years ago on
Mayfield Avenue. Maybe I'm naive in
thinking that pedestrians have the right
of way when crossing at a marked cross
walk. In that case maybe we should find
fault in those responsible for writing the
rules of the road.
Or I could look up the driver who hit
me and apologize for cracking his wind
shield with my head and for making him
pay for the surgery 1 had to have on my
shoulder and the two years of rehab 1 just
finished as a result of my careless behav

ior. Better yet, maybe we should inform
the legal system how idiotic it was to find
the driver completely guilty for negligent
driving. Poor guy.
Clearly the author is writing from a
position of privilege, insensitivity and
immaturity. I hope that it doesn't take a
personal tragedy for him to realize how
ludicrous his letter was.

Defending the Sixth Man Club
Although 1 agree with Peter [Douglas]
that the Sixth Mail Club is not very
knowledgeable about the games right
now, 1 think that it has less to do with an
overall sense of "band wagon jumping"
and has much more to do with the new
ticketing system. The Justarrive system
makes it easier for students to get into
games, but also does not really reward
"hardcore fans." Instead, it rewards peo
ple who let friends borrow their card and
shirt. Because of this, it is very true that

many people in the stands have little
sense of what is going on and don't know
much about basketball.
However, that is no reason to kt*ep
them out of the stands. The goal should
be to keep these people coining so they
will learn how to be good basketball fans.
He also cannot complain about fans being
disinterested when we're losing because,
as Peter himself said, there is only one
example of us being in this situation all
year and this was one of the first "real"
home games of the season.
The Sixth Man Club does need to step
it up a notch, but just give it time. We
need to remember that the Club is still
evolving and is a little disorganized right
now. The best way to fix this would be to
get all the Sixth Man members communi
cating rather than just meeting at the
game and basking in our "coolness."
Two solutions are already out there.
The bootleg, an unofficial Web site cov
ering Stanford basketball and football,
has a message board set up at www.the
bootleg.com just for Sixth Man members
to talk about upcoming games. It cur

rently lias almost no users, but it more
Sixth Man members used it, the board
could be a great tool. Another option
would be for more people to join the
"Sixth-man-members" list. To do this, all
they need to do is send a "subscribe sixth
man-members" message to majordo
mo(alists.stanf ord.edu.
As the Club becomes more of a commu
nity and gains more knowledge, look for it
to continue to improve throughout the
rest of this season and seasons to come.

New CPC better serves student body
I was surprised and disappointed
about your editorial of Thursday, M.r.h
2, ("New ASSU Campaign Practices Code
raises questions"), which criticized the
new policy of demerits for Campaign
Practices Code violations.
Over the past few months, a small
group of dedicated ASSU leaders (who

arc NOT up for re-election) spent a great
deal of time and energy determining how
we could best reform election policies. We
engaged in countless hours of lively
debate about the philosophy as well as the
practicality and logistics of any changes to
the Campaign Practices Code. We decid
ed that the following goals were most
important: leveling the playing field for all
candidates, increasing voter awareness,
and encouraging candidates to "play fair."
And in all of our idealism, we also faced
reality: some candidates do have more
money than others, most students do not
pay attention to the campaign, and some
candidates will llagrantly violate the Cam
paign Practices Code.
Our new demerits policy is an innova
tive, "thinking-outside-the-box" method
of reaching our goals and facing the real
problems of ASSU campaign season. In
previous years, wealthier candidates
could break rules to their heart's content
— they would simply pay the enormous
fines they accumulated. Meanwhile, can
didates without those resources were the
only ones following the rules. This year,
we believe all candidates, rich or not, will
refrain from breaking the rules because
of the public consequences — their
demerit totals on the ballot will be seen by
all voters, even those students who have
not been paying much attention to the
campaign.
The Senate and Elections Commission
compile the CPC in an effort to make
elections fair and productive. Every time
a candidate violates the rules, the elec
tions become more unfair and less pro
ductive, degrading the process of choos
ing our student representatives. This
demerits policy is one step towards
changing the dynamics and incentives in
campaigning and revitalizing otu ASSU
elections as a whole.
This policy is just one of many new
ideas to provide students with better
information on candidates, special lees,
and the role of the ASSI' on campus. We
encourage you to take an active part in
creating Stanford's future by casting an
informed and thoughtful vote tins spring.

Final words on Pi Beta Phi
As representatives of the Stanfotd
chapter of Chi Omega sorority, we are
writing to clarify our position on the deci
sion to house Pi lit ta Phi, as we leel that
our chapter's views were misrepresented
in The Daily's orginal article ("Res Ed
awards house to sorority") on Feb. 2H.
First and most importantly, we want to
offer our sincere congratulations to the Pi
Phis. Our enthusiasm and support was
not at all conveyed by the article. We are
thrilled for the Pi Phis and will support
them in any way possible on their i\>ad to
being a housed chapter. This is wonder
ful fiir the Creek community in general,
and we support all housed chapters even
as we choose to remain unhoused.
Second, our chapter did NOT apply
fora house last year, contrary to the
report of "an unsuccessful bid last year."

We have no "housing ambitions," as was
stated in the article. We are happy to
remain one of Stafford's two unhoused
sororities and we currently have NO col
lective desire to be housed.
Third, our chapter was never made
any sort of guarantee about future hous
ing by anyone in the ()fhce of Residential
Education or elsewhere. Any impression
we might have given to the contrary was
the result of an individual misunder
standing. We fully understand that if in
the future we choose to apply for hous
ing, we will be assessed based on the qual
ity of Our application alone.
Congratulations again to the Pi Phis.
We wish you all the best.

In light of Elizabeth Andrews' testimo
nial, we would like to recant our former
statements regarding the inappropriate
ness of Pi Phi's recent victory ill their
noble crusade for on-canipus housing.
After some exhaustive soul-searching,
we would like to thank Andrews fin lend
ing us hard-won insight into our own
lives. We must admit that, at first, it was
painful to confront the void of our selfish
and narcissistic existence. I low can we, as
non-Pi Phis, evei truly commit ourselves
to the service of others? Sadly, it is too late
for us to pledge Pi Phi. Our minds, so
narrow, and our hearts, so bereft of good
will toward mankind, are beyond
redemption.
In closing, we would like to encourage
others to rush, others for whom it is not
too late. Freshmen women, go bravely
forth to become Pi Phis. Do not be dis
couraged by the exhaustive grilling you
will receive at Rush about your communi
ty service involvements. Do not be daunt
ed by the hardships of a life devoted to
driving'a Subaru Justy and tutoring in
East Palo Alto. Let the vibrancy and
diversity of your sisterhood be your solace
as you mourn the loss of your room in
Manzanita Park.

Many people have been complaining
recently about the fact that the Pi Beta Phi
sorority has been awarded a house. Last
Wednesday's Daily article (" Possible soror
ity houses stir debate") and a letter to the
editor both contained negative comments
from students that 1 feel are either incon
sequential or just plain stupid.
First of all, I am very happy for the Pi
Phis and surprised that the University is
actually awarding a Greek organization a
house after what seems to have been a
very anti-Greek past couple of years. With
three fraternities losing their houses in
the last two years, it is nice to know that at
least one house will be given back to the
Greek system, even if it isn't awarded to a
fraternity. Hopefully, in the upcoming
years, the administration will continue to
return the houses that they took from the
Greek community.
Regarding the numerous complaints
by non-Greek students in The Daily who
are afraid of losing their residences, I ask
you this; how do you think DKE, Taxi
and Phi Delt felt when they found out
they were losing their houses and, for the
most part, getting screwed with terrible
Draw numbers or random housing?
I feel no pity for the person who feels
it would be "a real shame" if the Pi Phis
were housed in Phi Delt or that "it's a real
loss to the general community." You
shouldn't even be living in Phi Delt right
now. Though the reason for Phi Delt los
ing their house is a sticky subject, it
should still be in Greek hands. There are
many unhoused fraternities and sorori
ties that deserved a chance at the house
before it was turned over to the general
student population. Phi Delt and Taxi
were a bonus to the Draw and should still
be Greek housing. It's a shame that what
have been fraternity houses fora long
time are now open to the general student
body.
And, to the ladies who said, "attractive
housing opportunities for non-Greek
upperclassmen have been steadily dwin
dling," what do you call the opening of
three very nice formerly Greek houses to

upperclassmen in the last two years
alone? As a part of Sigma Nu, a non
housed fraternity, I am in tile same boat
as any other non-Greek student dealing
with the Draw. But 1 would gladly give up
possible housing options to see that jus
tice is clone in returning to the Greek sys
tem what is rightfully ours.
I take personal oflense when many stu
dents say it is unfair that good housing be
given to Greek organizations. Many of the
houses on campus were Greek in the first
place and have since been robbed from us.
Why should we be forced to give up our
great houses (who wouldn't say that Taxi
is one of the most beautiful houses on
campus) and then be shafted with the less
desirable houses or, as some students sug
gested, be housed in Stern or Wilbur. 1 lie
Greek housing criteria that an awarded
house shouldn't have many two-room
doubles or singles and shouldn't be very
high in the Draw is preposterous. Many
students living in Row houses now who
voted for these criteria wouldn't be in
their house if the fraternity who lived
there hadn't lost it in the first place.
The Greek system is an institution at
Stanford and has been around since the
founding of the University. To relegate
us to non-desirable housing (or no hous
ing at all, for that matter) is an affront to
a group that is as much a part of Stanford
as the Band or the Dollies. Anyone who
has ever been to any sort of Greek event,
be it a community based event or a party,
cannot deny that the Greek system adds
considerably to the Stanford community.

It seems that, in all the arguments
about the recent decision to award hous
ing to the Pi Beta Phi sorority, one of the
biggest complaints among non-Greeks is
that the University is involved 111 a kind of
conspiracy to give all the good housing to
fraternities and sororities.
What these people seem to forget is
that over the past 15 to 20 years, far more
Greek chapters have lost their housing
than been awarded housing. The last sev
eral years alone have seen the Dekes,
Delts, Taxis and Phi Delts lose their hous
es. Even the house that was awarded to
the Tri Delts a few years ago previously
belonged to a fraternity: ATO. Most of
the inner Row houses that are now the

most popular houses in the Draw at one
time belonged to fraternities or sororities.
However, as the University has had to
deal with the campus housing crunch by
systematically removing a majority of
(ireek chapters from their houses, tew
(ii efk chapters have been awarded hous
ing despite reapplying year in and year
out. Perhaps before Stanford students
start crying that the University is stealing
their best housing they should consider
whose housing it was in the first place.
Assigning the Pi Phis to Bob, Whitman,
6XO Lomita or Narnia is not unfair to the
general student body.
