Drivers need to exercise caution near
Florence Moore Hall
This is in response to Shane Sareli's
March i! letter in which he wrote, "Only
idiots get hit by cars." I'd like to thank
him for the absolute brilliance with which
he wrote this letter. 1 have no doubt that
everyone who read it thought to them
selves, "It's about time someone finally
used concrete logic in determining the
source of the Mayfield Avenue accident
problem."
I'm also writing as one of the "idiots"
who got hit by a driver two years ago on
Mayfield Avenue. Maybe I'm naive in
thinking that pedestrians have the right
of way when crossing at a marked cross
walk. In that case maybe we should find
fault in those responsible for writing the
rules of the road.
Or I could look up the driver who hit
me and apologize for cracking his wind
shield with my head and for making him
pay for the surgery 1 had to have on my
shoulder and the two years of rehab 1 just
finished as a result of my careless behav

ior. Better yet, maybe we should inform
the legal system how idiotic it was to find
the driver completely guilty for negligent
driving. Poor guy.
Clearly the author is writing from a
position of privilege, insensitivity and
immaturity. I hope that it doesn't take a
personal tragedy for him to realize how
ludicrous his letter was.

Defending the Sixth Man Club
Although 1 agree with Peter [Douglas]
that the Sixth Mail Club is not very
knowledgeable about the games right
now, 1 think that it has less to do with an
overall sense of "band wagon jumping"
and has much more to do with the new
ticketing system. The Justarrive system
makes it easier for students to get into
games, but also does not really reward
"hardcore fans." Instead, it rewards peo
ple who let friends borrow their card and
shirt. Because of this, it is very true that

many people in the stands have little
sense of what is going on and don't know
much about basketball.
However, that is no reason to kt*ep
them out of the stands. The goal should
be to keep these people coining so they
will learn how to be good basketball fans.
He also cannot complain about fans being
disinterested when we're losing because,
as Peter himself said, there is only one
example of us being in this situation all
year and this was one of the first "real"
home games of the season.
The Sixth Man Club does need to step
it up a notch, but just give it time. We
need to remember that the Club is still
evolving and is a little disorganized right
now. The best way to fix this would be to
get all the Sixth Man members communi
cating rather than just meeting at the
game and basking in our "coolness."
Two solutions are already out there.
The bootleg, an unofficial Web site cov
ering Stanford basketball and football,
has a message board set up at www.the
bootleg.com just for Sixth Man members
to talk about upcoming games. It cur

rently lias almost no users, but it more
Sixth Man members used it, the board
could be a great tool. Another option
would be for more people to join the
"Sixth-man-members" list. To do this, all
they need to do is send a "subscribe sixth
man-members" message to majordo
mo(alists.stanf ord.edu.
As the Club becomes more of a commu
nity and gains more knowledge, look for it
to continue to improve throughout the
rest of this season and seasons to come.

New CPC better serves student body
I was surprised and disappointed
about your editorial of Thursday, M.r.h
2, ("New ASSU Campaign Practices Code
raises questions"), which criticized the
new policy of demerits for Campaign
Practices Code violations.
Over the past few months, a small
group of dedicated ASSU leaders (who

arc NOT up for re-election) spent a great
deal of time and energy determining how
we could best reform election policies. We
engaged in countless hours of lively
debate about the philosophy as well as the
practicality and logistics of any changes to
the Campaign Practices Code. We decid
ed that the following goals were most
important: leveling the playing field for all
candidates, increasing voter awareness,
and encouraging candidates to "play fair."
And in all of our idealism, we also faced
reality: some candidates do have more
money than others, most students do not
pay attention to the campaign, and some
candidates will llagrantly violate the Cam
paign Practices Code.
Our new demerits policy is an innova
tive, "thinking-outside-the-box" method
of reaching our goals and facing the real
problems of ASSU campaign season. In
previous years, wealthier candidates
could break rules to their heart's content
— they would simply pay the enormous
fines they accumulated. Meanwhile, can
