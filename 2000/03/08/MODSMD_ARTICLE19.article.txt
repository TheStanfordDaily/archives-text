## 
### TIM KANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Kickingoffyet another stressful Dead Week,
a variety of University administrators, profes
sors, and other staff'took part in Stanford's sec
ond annual "Midnight Breakfast" late Monday
night.
Run by the Dean of Students Office, the
event featured a full breakfast served to hungry
students by such luminaries as Vice Provost for
Students Affairs James Montoya, Dean of Ad
missions Robert Kinnally, Dean of Students
Marc Wais and Athletic Director Ted Leland.
A number of sponsors pitched in to help, in
cluding the Oflice of Development, the Stan
ford Alumni Association, the ASSU, Housing
and Dining Services and Bon Appetit.
"It's a gesture on the part of the University
to show students that we care and value them in
an informal setting, and wish them good luck
on finals," said Wais, who was the driving force
behind the event.
"It's a great opportunity for students to in
teract with faculty and administration," said
sophomore ASSU Senator Serge Kassardjian.
"The ASSU feels it's key that more students get
to know administrators."
The fare available for students was like that
of typical Dining Services breakfasts — scram
bled eggs, bacon, hash browns, muffins, bagels
and cereal — except, of course, for the novelty
of being served by people like Dean of Earth
Sciences Lynn Orr.
"This reminds me of my days of a hasher
years ago," said a smiling Orr, adding, "It's an
opportunity to mark the transition into Dead
Week and remind people that crunch time is
here."

Wais said the lour locations — Wilbur West,
Wilbur East, Florence Moore, and Tressider —
served nearly M,()()() students total, with about
60 percent being undergraduates and the re
maining 40 percent graduate students.
Even with the larger turnout than last year,
Dining Services Director Shirley Everett ex
pected more. "We would have liked to have
seen more students," Everett said.
The students present appeared to enjoy the

unusual break from studying.
"I think it's really cool to see professors
hanging around having a good time," said
sophomore Fred Luininoso.
Some expressed their wish for more mean
ingful discussions with the faculty, however.
"It's nice to have decent food at midnight," said
sophomore Tim Cao, "although the involve
ment of the administration was not what 1 had
hoped."
