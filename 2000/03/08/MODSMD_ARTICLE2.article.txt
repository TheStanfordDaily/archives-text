## 
### GREG PAGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In yesterday's "Super Tuesday" primary elections,
Republican Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Democ
ratic Vice President A1 Gore established themselves as
t he undisputed frontrunners in this year's presidential
election.
While Gore swept 16 Democratic primaries, Bush
won eight Republican states, including the two with the
most delegates, California and New York. Bush's GOP
rival Arizona Sen. John McCain won the primary con
tests in Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts and
Rhode Island.
Speaking to a crowd in Los Angeles last night, Mc-
Cain said, "Our message of reform has had a powerful
impact."
A senior McCain adviser told the Associated Press
that he expects McCain to exit the race Thursday, but
no firm decision has yet been made.
Last night, Bush told supporters at a victory rally,
"We have a national victory. Republicans and conserv
atives across America have said they want me to lead
the Republican Party to victory come November, and I
am ready and eager to do so."
Republicans on campus said they expect that Bush
can now focus his energies on the general election.
"A decisive victory is good because it allows consoli
dation within the party. Now that Bush has a clear lead,
the whole party can stand behind him. With one major
candidate, the race is not going to get dirty," said
sophomore Julian Wassenar, a registered Republican.

Speaking to supporters in lennesee, (.ore (ailed
the Democrats "the party of the mainstream," and
turned his attention to November, criticizing Hush's
tax cut plan.
Many Democratic observers expect Bradley, who
has not won any primary races so far, to drop out this
week, and Bradley supporters on campus are realistic
in their assessments of his candidacy.
In a statement made last night, Bradley summed up
the day's results. "He won, 1 lost," Bradle\ dead
panned.
"1 supported Bradley in his campaign, and it's un
fortunate that he didn't make a strong showing today.

If he drops out, however. 1 will throw
my support towards C lore," said Anisha
Ambardar, a sophomore.
The contentious battles for each
party's nomination made this year's
election turnout levels unusuallv high
across the country.
"I think the fact that this election

marks, numerically, the largest voter turnout in Cali
fornia history is heartening. It's unfi>l lunate, however,
that the vast majority of independent voters didn't re
alize their votes didn't count [for the delegates].
Nonetheless, it's a good sign lor the general election,"
said Ariel Lavinbuk, International Policv'Studies grad
uate student.
TheCalfornia primary was open to independents as
well as members of all parties, but only the votes of reg
istered Democrats and Republicans will count when
awarding delegates within each party.
