# NASA, Stanford pair up
## Joint venture will build powerful telescope 
### FRANCIS POLLOCK 
NASA has announced a new
collaboration with Stanford to re
search and build a telescope de
signed to investigate high-energy
radiation bursts from distant stel
lar objects.
The project will be based at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter. Physics Prof. Peter Michelson,
a researcher in the area of experi
mental high-energy astrophysics,
has been named the principal in
vestigator.
The Gamma Ray Large Area
Space Telescope project, known as
GLAST, is an international eflort.
The U.S. Department of Energy,
as well as France, Italy, Japan and
Sweden, are all contributing to the
project which is expected to cost
roughly $200 million dollars.
The GLAST, scheduled to be
launched in 2005, is different from
the average telescope. It will use
gigantic strips of silicon, 100

square meters in area, to detect the
emission of high-energy gamma
radiation. Sources of such radia
tion include black holes, neutron
stats and pulsars.
The telescope will also explore
the phenomenon of high-energy
bursts emitted from otherwise
low-energy sources. Scientists
hope that these high-energy pack
ets will provide insight into the hy
pothesized existence of dark mat
ter. <.
This will not be Michelson's In st
experience with NASA. He head
ed the Stanford Energetic Gamma
Kay Experiment Telescope Team,
which was also under the direction
of NASA.
The GLAST will have a detec
tion range 50 times more sensitive
than the EGRET, making it much
more effective for studying high
energy phenomena. The instru
ment detects energy ranging from
ten million to one trillion electron
volts. It will be able to pinpoint
sources that the EGRET was not
sensitive enough to define.
Michelson told The Stanford
Report that "CiLAST will enable
the study of many important cos

mological mysteries where particle
physics has fundamental rele
vance, including the mechanisms
of cosmic particle acceleration, the
physics driving the mysterious

gamma ray bursts, and the nature
of dark matter."
