# Patent revenues keep pouring into Stanford

### AMIT GARG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Patent royalties remain an important source
of revenue for the University, even though sev
eral lucrative patents have expired within the
past two years, slashing the total number of dol
lars brought in.
Stanford inventions are expected to bring in
$20 million this fiscal year, far below the $40.1
million received last year and the record $60.1
million earned in fiscal 1997-98, the final year
the University received income from the highly
profitable recombinant I)NA patent.
The fluctuation in royalty revenue, however,
does not affect tuition costs.
"The inventor, the department and the
school share one-third each of the net royalties,"
said Katharine Ku, director of the Office of
Technology Licensing, which has managed
Stanford patents since the 19705. "There is no
effect on tuition."
Stanford has a long history of successful in
novations. Besides Stanford-owned patents,
several others, such as the birth control pill,
DNA cloning and a myriad of computer tech
nologies, have a connection to the University.

But until 1994, researchers utilizing Stan
lord facilities owned the rights to inventions re
sulting from non-sponsored research. Under
the current policy, the University owns the
rights to any invention "conceived or first re
duced to practice in whole or in part by mem
bers of the faculty or staffol the University in the
course of their University responsibilities or
with more than incidental use of University re
sources."
"Although some could argue against, most
universities and companies would say that the
patent is theirs," said Ku. "The policy was de
bated by the faculty and the decision taken to
avoid conflicts of interest."
Last year, Stanford ranked fourth nation
wide in patent revenues. Earlier this year the Li
censing Executives Society of the United States
and Canada awarded Stanford the inaugural
Licensing Achievement Award.
Stanford has held patents for many impor
tant inventions, such as the recombinant DNA
technology. Until the patent's expiration in De
cember 1997, recombinant DNA brought in
over $250 million, which was shared between
the University of California and Stanford.
The University also licenses non-patented

technologies developed at Stanford such as the
Web search engine (loogle.
For this fiscal year, phycobiliproteins, highly
ellicient light-gathering protein-flnoniphoies
found in nature, brought in the highest revenue
of $4 million. Its patent will expire in 2002.
Patents are currently valid for 20 years from
their date of filing. Filing and getting a patent
can be a lengthy process.
"After an invention has been disclosed, it is
carefully evaluated," Kn said. "On average, we
receive 250 disclosures per year and file patent
applications on HO to 40 percent of them.'
"()ne of our major concerns is to market the
technology commercially," Ku said. "We will
concurrently market an invention and file a
patent application with the Patent and hade
mark Office, which can take from two to three
years to issue the patent."
Some inventors have expressed discontent
with the bureaucracy, said some Stanford re
searchers. There are also times when there is
thequestion of who are the actual inventors and
should be named on the patent.
"Science moves forward and it is not unusu
al for many people to invent the same thing at
the same time," said kn.
