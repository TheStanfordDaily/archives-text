# Education Prof. Massy calls for tuition reform
## Scholar testifies before Congress Committee on Governmental Affairs 
### NINA HOLLY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
William Massy, a professor
emeritus in the School of Educa
tion, testified last month before
Congress about rising tuition at
United States colleges and univer
sities.
Massy, a researcher on higher
education, told the Committee on
Covernmental Affairs that colleges
and universities could do much
more to keep costs under control.
He also said that elite, private
schools in particular increase their
costs to keep up with similar insti
tutions.
"The extra money frequently
does not go toward things that will
improve the overall quality of edu
cation, but things that will increase
the school's prestige, such as grad
uate research," he said in an on
campus interview.
Massy said universities can im
prove the value students receive
for their money by implementing
a control system that includes stu
dent evaluations of courses and
asking faculty what amount of
work they can best manage.
"Schools often discount the im
portance of student evaluations,"
Massy said. "But students do know
when they are learning [and] what
courses are oI great value."
He said another factor insetting
tuition is cost management.
"Though it's impossible to find
out how much it costs to teach,
costs of certain operations can be

tracked, especially in times of tran
sition, in comparing costs of old
ways and the new," Massy said,
calling this approach "activity
based cost." He noted that by
doing so a university could avoid
wasting resources.
Massy, who works as a private
consultant with universities both
in the U.S. and abroad to improve
efficiency, said that a good way to
track a school's effectiveness is to
determine how much students use
their education once they enter
the job market.
He said that a program he has
worked on in Hong Kong tracks
students after they leave school.
The university then follows up
with the students' employers, ask
ing them how well the students'
education prepared them for
work.
A broad, governmental ap
proach to keeping schools in line
usually does not work, Massy said,
because the system does not take
the schools' individual needs into
account.
"What the government can —
and should — do is ask the schools
relevant questions about whether
they are complying with certain
standards of educational quality,"
he said, noting that standard
should be tailored to individ*
schools.
He added that if the schools are
not meeting the standards, some
governmental funding could be
taken away. Massy said some Sen
ators are in favor of this method.
"Some elements of the system
are more receptive to this ap
proach than others," Massy said.
"We should be looking at a ten
year horizon to see significant
changes."
