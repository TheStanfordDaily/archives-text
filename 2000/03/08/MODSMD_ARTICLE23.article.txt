# Who wants to be just a millionaire? CS profs teach despite riches

Slightly less than one-third of Stanford's
45 computer science professors are million
aires.
Computer science professors art trying
their hand at running new dot-coms, and
ten of the department's professors are on
leave this year, alxnit three more than
usual.
"If faculty are successful in commercial
izing technology and they choose to stay in
the University, we expect them to be fully

committed to Stanford," said University
Provost John Hennessy, "Some faculty that
have been successful in their ventures have
actually devoted moreoftheir efforts to the
University by reducing their consulting
commitments.
Some students believe that wealthy pro
fessors, by remaining at the University,
demonstrate a genuine love of teaching.
"The millionaire profs are actually the
better ones, because they're the ones who
really want to be teaching," said sopho
more Julia Letchner. "Otherwise, with so
much money, why would they [still be

teaching]?"
"The important thing to understand is
that the individuals have chosen to stay on
the faculty. In the 1980s and [more] recent
ly, we saw some faculty that chose to pursue
their Silicon Valley dreams depart from
campus. That was a loss to the university,"
said Hennessy. ,
With one exception, all of the computer
science professors who have been successful
entrepreneurs have returned to the Uni
versity to teach and do research.
Many academics who have succeeded in
their Internet ventures hardly consider

quitting their University jobs. While many
professors have made their fortunes by sell
ing their startups to larger companies, most
have done so through successful initial pub
lic offerings. Because of their commitments
in private industry, some computer science
professors may take more time off from
teaching than does the average faculty
member.
"The success of a faculty member's out
side ventures has no bearing on what they
do at Stanford. They continue to teach and
do research just like any other faculty mem
ber," I lennessy said.

"I think that Stanford already provides
enough flexibility for professors," said
Computer Science Department Chair
Jean-Claute Latombe, referring to the sab
batical, leave of absence, and consulting op
portunities available to Stanford professors.
"There is no need to be more flexible, and 1
haven't lx*en."
"There is absolutely no difference of
treatment lx*tween one professor and an
other. Some universities that do not have
the same flexibility as us have recently lost a
