# Experts discuss women in medicine
## Panels will focus on gender discrimination 
### JENNIFER STEWART EDITORIAL STAFF 
I he experiences of women in
aerospace, in medicine as mid
wives in the Middle Ages and as
students, in modern medical
schools will be among the topics
of discussion at what organizers
bill as the first-ever conference on
women in medicine.
The conference, titled "The Pi
oneering Efforts of Women in
Medicine and the Medical Sci
ences," is the first of its kind, said
Cerald W. Friedland, a confer
ence organizer and professor
emeritus of radiology.
" The big goal is to make
known and public for the first
time the origins of the bias against
women in the medical sciences,"
Friedland said.
The conference draws 16
speakers from Canada and the
United States. Janet Bickel, from
the Association of American Med

ical Colleges, is the keynote speak
er. Friedland said that Bickel's re
search shows the challenges that
women in medicine still face. Her
research indicates that it will be 40
years before 15 percent of women
faculty rank as full professors.
Friedland said tlie idea for the
conference was born after he wit
nessed an act of discrimination
against women. "I was co-author
of a book on medicine's 10 great
est discoveries," Friedland said.
" I n the one section where women
played an important role, [the ed
itors] edited out the entire section
and said they had to it because of
length."
He said that he discussed the
experience with a female col
league who suggested the editor's
action was not atypical. Together,
the two decided to organize a
conference on the efforts of
women in medicine and the med
ical sciences.
Friedland said that women did
not always constitute a minority
in the medical profession. "Until
1850, women were probably the
majority of physicians," he said.
"There was probably a seven-to

out* ratio in favor of women as
surgeons." He said this changed
with "the arrival of male-domi
nated universities to which
women were really not admit
ted."
Women faced further chal
lenges when female physicians
were charged with witchcraft.
In addition to focusing on the
historical experience of women in
medicine, speakers will address
the experience of women in space
medicine, the role of women in
mental health and physiological
gender differences.
Friedland said he hopes the
conference will spark change.
"We hope it will start making peo
ple realize how much sexism
there is in medical schools and col
leges in general," he said. "And we
hope that it will result in action
that will start leveling the playing
field and increase the number of
women in leadership roles."
The conference will be in
Fairchild Auditorium in the Med
ical School on March 10 from
8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and is open
to all students and community
members.
