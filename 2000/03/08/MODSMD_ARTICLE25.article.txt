# Row tightens rules for staff elections
## In response to last year's concerns, residents are now part of selection process 
### DURANT GIPSON 
In light of concerns about alleged un
fairness in last year's Row house staff selec
tion, this year the Row Office has mandat
ed that all student-managed houses that
don't have the entire house vote on candi
dates must include at least two residents in
the staff selection process.
"Our position in the Row Office is that
we want staff selections to be conducted
fairly and equitably," said Ann Porteus, as
sociate director of Residential Education
and director of the Row program.
Last year, residents in two student-man
aged houses, 557 Maylield and Bob, com
plained the stall selection process was tin
lair, prompting the process, in which the

old stall chose the stall for the next year, to
be repeated. The second time, the selec
tion committees included several resi
dents, and in both houses some ol the stu
dents initially chosen lor stall positions
were not reselected.
The Row Office began to use a more
centralized process last year. Porteus,
along with former Assistant Director for
Student Management Laurette Beeson,
introduced a standardized application that
is kept on file at the Row Office and intro
duced mandatory attendance at informa
tional meetings for prospective student
managers.
These processes remain in place tor stall
selection this year.
This year, many houses are having their
residents approve the selection process.
"We're trying to make sure people are
more informed. Hopefully that will keep
problems from occurring," said Josh
Baughman, a junior and house manager at
Bob.

Lisa 1 lladik, a junior and social manag
er at 557 Mayfield, said that the .stall'there
put much effort into formulating the new
policy, which has a committee consisting of
the current staff and five residents. "We're
trying to make it a fair policy. This was the
most comprehensive tiling that we could
think of," Hladik said.
The stall Of 557 Mayfield required resi
dents to approve the process of selecting
the next year's staff. "We wanted everyone
to know what was going on," she said.
Porteus emphasized that the houses are
managed by students. "We're not monitor
ing them. We consult, advise, educate and
recommend," she explained. "We're try
ing to walk this fine line of allowing houses
to design their own processes, but insure
minimal standards in the system."
Jen Avery, a senior and resident assistant
in Clrove Lasuen, echoed Porteus's senti
ment. "They're trying to give us as much au
tonomy as possible while making sure the
problems don't happen again," she said.
