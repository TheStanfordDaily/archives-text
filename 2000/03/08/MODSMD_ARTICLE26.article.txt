## Dry-cleaning, video rental may be in works 
### EILEEN CHAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The newly selected CEO of
Stanford Student Enterprises,
senior Colby McCavin, is look
ing at possible new SSE services
such as on-campus dry cleaning
and video rental and wants to
improve the SSE Web site for
students. She is also spearhead
ing the new Business Leader
ship Program, which will put se
niors in contact with Silicon Val
ley entrepreneurs and business
professors before school starts
in the fall.
"I'm very excited about the
position," McCavin said. "I've
been with SSE for two years and
have learned a great deal from
all my experiences here."
SSE provides students ser
vices such as Flicks, the Student
Store and Lecture Notes.
Applicants for the CEO posi
tion had to go through a series
of interviews before being se
lected this month by a commit
tee of five people, including
both students and alumni in
volved with SSE and the ASSU.
According to ASSU president
Mike Levin, a junior, the final
choice was a very close and diffi
cult one.
"In the three years that I've
been here, this year was the year
with the strongest field of candi
dates to choose from," Levin
said. "1 think the organization is
in a very advantageous position
to have such qualified candi
dates."
McCavin, who started out in
SSE as a junior working in fresh
man apparel and advanced to
projects manager this year, was
chosen because of her experi
ence and enthusiasm for SSE,
according to Levin.
"She's gained a wealth of ex
perience and has a great knowl

edge of the relationship be
tween SSE and the ASSU,"
Levin said. "She understands
that the goal and purpose of the
ASSU is to provide a voice for
the students to the University,
and SSE helps in funding [this
goal.]"
Sean Lucy, the current CEO,
said he felt the position was ex
tremely demanding.
"The CEO runs the entire or
ganization of SSE and has eight
directors reporting to him,"
Lucy said. "At the same time, he
is also the financial manager of
the ASSU, where he has to bud
get their funds and advise them
in finance."
Levin said that McCavin
showed a willingness to learn
that would make her a success
ful CEO.
"[Lucy and I] can sit down
and teach her about the nuts
and bolts of what we do," Levin
said. "We will have an early col
laborative goal-setting time
where we can plan out our [vi
sions] for the future."
McCavin hopes to implement
some new projects for Stanford
students.
"We're conducting a survey
right now to get student input
on what they'd like to see," Mc-
Cavin said. "Everyone is excited
about oil-campus video-rentals
and campus dry-cleaning."
One new program spear
headed by McCavin is the Busi
ness Leadership Program,
which will start in September.
This program will run five days
before school starts and will
allow 60 to 70 seniors to meet
and talk with business profes
sors as well as business people
from the industry. Projects such
as these are what made McCavin
stand out, according to Levin.
"Colby is very interested in
reaching out to the student body
with more leadership pro
grams," Levin said. He added
that McCavin is looking outside
of Stanford for people to work

with the ASSU to provide more
opportunities for students.
"It's taking advantage of our
place in Silicon Valley," lie said.
Besides starting new pro
grams, an important goal for
McCavin is to evaluate and im
prove existing projects, accord
ing to Levin.
"Sean started many new ini
tiatives this year and 1 want to
continue working on them,"
McCavin said.
One such initiative is the
ASSU technology group, which
helped create the online course
guide.
"They are working on creat
ing an intranet to provide a
technological infrastructure to
the organization," McCavin
said. "They hope to create a
Stanford portal [so] students
will hopefully interact more
with [the Web page], which isn't
as well utilized as it could be."
With these ideas, McCavin
said she hopes she can fulfill her
position's duties as well as she
feels Lucy has.
" 1 have a tremendous
amount of respect for Sean,"
McCavin said. "He has done
such a great deal for SSE this
year and will leave a very strong
legacy. Those are big shoes lo
fill."
However, Levin has full con
fidence that McCavin will be
come a successful CEO for SSE.
"One thing that made her an
outstanding candidate was how
she wants to maintain strong
communication with the ASSU,
which is vital," Levin said. "Al
though we're two separate orga
nizations, we're driving towards
the same goal — providing stu
dents the [link] to their universi
ty. She will do a fantastic job as
CEO and financial manager."
McCavin will officially begin
her position, which also includes
being the financial manager of
ASSU, starting July 1, after
training with current CEO Sean
Lucy during spring quarter.
