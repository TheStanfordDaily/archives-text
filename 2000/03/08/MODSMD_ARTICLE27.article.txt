# Group focuses on environment
## Magic house residents debate environmentalism, values 
### PATRICK C. CROSETTO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the typical Stanford student, life after the
Farm may involve either long days at the office,
hours researching a thesis or another main
stream put suit. However, a local group called
Magic offers current and former Stanford stu
dents the opportunity to pursue a lifestyle with a
different perspective.
Magic, a residential community of environ
mentalists, was founded in 1972 by David Schrom
and two of his 112 riends in a house in Palo Alto. The

group is currently located at the corner of ()xford
and Ash Street, a block away from the original lo
cation and one mile from Hoover Tower.
"The three of us has each been doing work tor
causes we though worthwhile," said Schrom, the
only one of the group's originators who still re
sides at the Palo Alto location. "We saw an under
lying framework for action in [those causes]. Un
less we addressed these ideas simultaneously we
realized that we would be doomed to be held back
by unaddressed issues."
The campaign to preserve rainforests, Schrom
said, was a good example of an effort that would
be more successful if it incorporated a more holis
tic view of the causes of environmental problems.

Palo Alto resident David Schrom cradled the two newest members of Magic â€” his twin daughters Jen, left,
and Hillary, right. Magic is a community dedicated to pursuing a non-mainstream, environmentally-friend
ly lifestyle.
"The population of the world is
doubling every 25 years, and you
cannot deal with the rainforests
without dealing with human be
ings," said Schrom.
"We then decided to take a
more integrated approach," said
Schrom about the decision to
start Magic.
Magic attempts to answer
questions of value through what
Schrom describes as "an ecologi
cal approach, using the methods
and principals in science and
what you do and behaviors
through which can we achieve
healthy living."
The current members of the
group work on various commu
nity and public service jobs.
Schrom is in the process of writ
ing a book about the application
of science to questions of value.
The group also has many oppor
tunities for students to help vol
unteer.
"Every tree in this neighbor
hood that has been planted in t he
last 20 years, we have planted,"
Schrom said.
Magic has collected more than

SO,OOO trees from Central Valley
tanners and helped children in
the Bay Area plant them.
Salvage also plays a role in the
simple lifestyle ot the members of
Magic. "We live in a place where
everyday thousands of pounds ot
food are thrown away," said
Schrom. So the group has
arranged with a group of local
grocers to take away the excess
food instead of them throwing it
away. The food that Magic has
left over is later used in a compost
pile.
But Magic is not narrowly fo
cused on preventing food waste,
Schrom said. Rather, it is con
cerned with a range of ecological
issues.
Schrom offers an analogy in to
clarify his point.
"If you drive down the street
and you see a couch that says it is
free for whoever picks it up. Let's
say you have a friend who is just
moving into a new apartment
with no furniture," Schrom said.
"You know you're going to pick
up that couch, but that doesn't
mean you're in the couch busi
ness. You're in the business of
helping friends."
Magic has attracted several
Stanford students, including
Robin Bayer, who joined the

community after graduating in
19K9.
Bayer was first attracted to
Magic because she "liked the
questions the people were asking.
I had similar questions what do I
want for life and was ill-prepared
to answer those questions."
Sophomore Peter Stair be
came involved with Magic after
he learned of the group in his
freshman writing class. He views
the group as "a community of
people who are modeling a dif
ferent way of living that is more
self-conscious and economically
conscious."
Pam Olson, also a sophomore,
learned about Magic through a
presentation the group made to
her dorm, Otero, last spring.
Magic will give presentations to
interested students at Branner
Hall and Robinson on April 17.
"Magic has given me a per
spective that some people never
think about. We're trained that
it's logical and good to have com
pensation,'' ()lson said.
Olson's roommate, sopho
more Elizabeth Aab, jokingly
refers to Magic as a "cult."
Though Aab may be joking when
she says this, it is criticism the
group often receives.
"Everyone thinks it is a cult be

cause anyone who lives like that
in a different way and has non
mainstream beliefs is reacted to
in that way," Stair said.
"We have a structured society
that has made such behavior
heretical," said Schrom, who be
lieves he has been punished for
his values..
"I went to Vale Law School
and my net worth is 1,000 bucks.
Why isn't my work valued more
highly then folks dealing with
leveraged buyouts?" Schrom
said.
Magic hopes to gives students
more opportunities in the future.
"The students at Stanford some
where in one to three years are
going to be facing fundamental
choices about meaning, life, fam
ily and how to have a good time,"
says Schrom. "There is a list of
options on the menu and most of
the options are a reflection of
your background ... You've been
exposed to a set of ideas on what
a good life is. Magic is another op
tion to add to the list."
"We take care of each other
and dedicate our lives to public
service," Schrom said. "Does any
one at Stanford today want to do
that? 1 don't know. We want to
open people's eyes to a different
way people can do things."
