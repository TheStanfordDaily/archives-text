# Group focuses on environment
## Magic house residents debate environmentalism, values 
### PATRICK C. CROSETTO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the typical Stanford student, life after the
Farm may involve either long days at the office,
hours researching a thesis or another main
stream put suit. However, a local group called
Magic offers current and former Stanford stu
dents the opportunity to pursue a lifestyle with a
different perspective.
Magic, a residential community of environ
mentalists, was founded in 1972 by David Schrom
and two of his 112 riends in a house in Palo Alto. The

group is currently located at the corner of ()xford
and Ash Street, a block away from the original lo
cation and one mile from Hoover Tower.
"The three of us has each been doing work tor
causes we though worthwhile," said Schrom, the
only one of the group's originators who still re
sides at the Palo Alto location. "We saw an under
lying framework for action in [those causes]. Un
less we addressed these ideas simultaneously we
realized that we would be doomed to be held back
by unaddressed issues."
The campaign to preserve rainforests, Schrom
said, was a good example of an effort that would
be more successful if it incorporated a more holis
tic view of the causes of environmental problems.
