Acclaimed "Doonesbury" creator Carry
Trudeau praised satire Monday night in his
speech to a large audience in Dinkelspiel audi
torium. Satire, "the savage, unregulated sport
protected by the United States Constitution"
can be "an effective form of social control," he
jokingly said.
The Knight Fellows brought Trudeau to
Stanford as part of their speaker series.
Trudeau launched "Doonesbury," his politi
cal satire cartoon, in 1970. The strip now runs
daily in nearly 1,400 newspapers.
Trudeau began by saving that he was grate
ful to be speaking at Stanford. "It's the only uni
versity whose dropout rate is a leading econom
ic indicator," he said.
Trudeau, the first comic strip artist to receive
a Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning, said
that "Doonesbury" is "the only place on the
comics page" with "politics, rock and roll, sex
and drugs." He stressed the "generational au
thenticity" of his strips and related most of his
speech to his experiences as a baby boomer.
Trudeau also voiced his opinions on the cur
rent presidential campaign, saying, "Bush's is a
campaign and presidency thai really concerns
me."
He also discussed the role of the media in
people's lives and the various ways in which
politicians and readers react to his satire and
sarcasm.
"When people say that they keep up w illi the
news through 'Doonesbury,' it scares me to

death," he said.
Trudeau said he believes that part of his job
is to "rouse and surprise"—but publishers
haven't always agreed. However, since his
Pulitzer Prize in 1975, Trudeau has enjoyed
more mainstream acceptance. He said lie also
tries to "make [people] laugh and think at the
same time," which is often a challenge.
The question-and-answer session began with
an audience member shouting out, "How does
ii feel to be so loved?"
1 m response to an inquiry about his inclusion
of the women's movement in his strip,Trudeau
said it "started as a dating strategy" but led to an
"awareness of the rapid change of attitudes."
When asked if he admired any of the public
figures he insults, Trudeau responded with a
decisive "No." He explained that journalists
often become infatuated with a politician, but
are invariably let down. "Skepticism is neces
sary," he said.
Trudeau said he is fascinated by new technol
ogy and the way it opens new artistic venues. New
technology has allowed for the creation of a 3-D
real-til lie graphic image of Duke, one of his char
acters. Nexi month, Duke, who is currently cam
paigning for president in the strip, will appear on
CNN's "Larry King Live."
Trudeau, a New York native, attended
Yale University, where lie earned his bache
lor's and master's degrees in graphic design.
In addition to liis success with the "Doones
bury' strip, Trudeau lias received four ACL
award nominations, awards from the Cannes
Film Festival and an Emmy for his work in
television.
