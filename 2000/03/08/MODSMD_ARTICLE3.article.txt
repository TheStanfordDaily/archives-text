### JESSICA TUCKER-MOHL EDITORIAL STAFF 
A number of bicyclists and drivers traversing a haz
ardous crosswalk on Mayfield Ave. Tuesday morning
were surprised with a stern reprimand from the Stan
ford Police.
()fliters issued 33 citations to both drivers and bicy
clists between 7:30 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., in response to a
surge iu accidents and near-accidents occurring in the
crosswalk direct Iv in front of Florence Moore 11, ill.
The citations, all given for failure to stop at the stop
sign or before crossing iu the crosswalk, carried vary
ing fines depending on the speed at which the vehicle
was traveling. The police department was not able to
provide information regarding the number of citations
giv en to bikers relative to drivers, or how many were is
sued to students.
"It had come to our attention that the pedestrian
crosswalk had become quite hazardous â€” that there
was no regard for the stop sign there," said ( -apt. Mar
vin Moore of the Stanford Police Department. "We felt
that there was a need to do some enforcement and
heighten the awareness."

The police department set up a video camera over
the weekend to film the crosswalk, revealing what
Moore called "flagrant" violations. "We saw vehicles
not even stopping and bicyclists blowing right through
the crosswalk."
That evidence, in addition to several recent acci
dents and an "increasing number of reports of close
calls," according to Moore, prompted the police de
partment to stake out the intersection and issue cita
tions. "We came to the conclusion that that crosswalk
was absolutely out of control."
"[This enforcement] is consistent with what [the
Stanford Police] would normally do," said Moore.
"Sometimes you have to target areas. In the past we've
set up bicycle enforcement areas, to check for licenses
and bike lights."
Senior Megan Tompkins, a resident assistant in
Alondra, was pleased with the efforts of the Stanford
Police.
"I think education about the problem is probably
the most important thing they can provide both to the
residents of Flo Mo and to the Stanford community,"
Tompkins said.
"Perhaps this new information
will allow both students and com
munity members to realize how se
rious this problem is and adjust
their actions accordingly, by being

more aware and focusing on safe
driving and biking practices," she
said.
Moore said that many bikers did
not take proper precautions, and
seemed unaware of their status as
vehicles, not pedestrians.
Stanford Police remain 011 the
alert for traffic violators on Mayfield
Ave. "We plan on being out there
again tomorrow," said Moore.
