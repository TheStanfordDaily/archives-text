# UCLA stuns Cardinal, 'Cats still loom
## Despite upset loss to Bruins, Stanford is still in driver's seat for Pac-10 championship 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
In the emotional final mo
ments of Saturday's game against
UCLA, Stanford's final home
game of the season, the players on
the court and the ball they were
batting around accelerated to a
blur.

A ridiculously long three from
the recently reprieved Jaßon
Rush, a five-second violation, an
almost airball, a frantic scrum, a
loose ball in David Moseley's
hands, a pass off Casey Jacobsen's
fingertips, another Rush make, a
missed half court heave at the
buzzer, a protest, a celebration, an
upset win and, for Stanford, an
improbable 94-93 overtime loss.
Blink and you missed it.
"1 could've called a timeout,"
said Moseley, who had the ball
firmly within his grasp as he fell to
the floor underneath the Stanford
basket with five seconds left. "1
could've just held the ball because
we had the possession arrow. I
tried to get it to Casey, he mishan
dled it, Rush got it, hit the shot
and we were like 'Oh, all that hap
pened just like that.' "
Fora team that had steam
rolled through the Pacific 10 Con
ference, winning 13 straight
games by at least 10 points, the
end of this epic game seemed like
it came a little early, even if the two
teams did play an extra five min
utes. For the first time in almost
two months, previously No. 1
Stanford had lost.
Combined with Arizona's two
straight defeats last week, the Car
dinal's loss took some air out of to
morrow night's clash with the
Wildcats (24-6, 13-3 Pac-10) in
Tucson, Ariz. But the implications
of the game are still intact.
A Stanford win gives the Cardi
nal (25-1, 14-2) its second straight
conference championship and a
good shot at earning a No. 1 seed
in the NCAA Tournament. A loss
to Arizona will throw tournament
seedings fora loop but likely
means the two teams will share the
Pat-10 crown.
"Our job has not changed since
two months ago," said Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery.
"We have to go down into Arizona
and win."
Going into last weekend,
UCLA had a similar mindframe:
go north and win. With a possible
berth in the NCAA Tournament
at stake, the previously under
achieving Bruins needed to win at
least one, it not both of their
games against California and
Stanford.
Thursday night, UCLA, which
leads the Pac-10 in shooting per
centage, fell behind by 19 points
but stormed back to beat the
Golden Bears by 21 in Berkeley.
Saturday, as they welcomed Rush
back from a 24-game suspension,
the Bruins fell behind 19-4 in the
opening minutes before again
showing their resiliency and their
shooting proficiency.
The Bruins, who missed all 14
of their three-point attempts in
Stanford's 15-point win in early
February, shot 52 percent from
behind the arc for Saturday's
game. Inside the line, they were
just as good. UCLA, which shot
54.5 percent overall, became the
first team all season to hit more
than half of its shots against Stan
ford.
"We didn't play good defense
today," said Stanford point guard
Mike McDonald. "Any team that
can shoot 50 percent against us
deserves to beat us."
The Bruins may have deserved
to beat Stanford, but they almost
didn't.
In regulation, UCLA needed a
baby hook at the buzzer from
Jerome Moiso, who finished with
17 points and 12 rebounds, to ex
tend the game and nullify a three
that McDonald hit only seconds
before.
Then in overtime, Stanford
had the game locked up with a
four-point lead and less than a
minute remaining. But Rush,
who scored a team-high 19 points
on 7-of-10 shooting and later hit
the game-winning shot with three
seconds left, nailed a three-point
er over Mark Madsen from be
yond NBA territory to close the
gap to one point with 42 seconds
on the clock. Jarron Collins was
then called fora five-second viola
tion on the subsequent inbounds

play and the wild finish ensued.
After a buzzer-beating prayer
from McDonald fell short, even
more bedlam erupted. The Bru
ins— many shirtless, all ecstatic —
piled on each other at midcourt
while Montgomery and Stanford
protested that Ray Young's
midrange fadeaway with nine sec
onds left had come up short of the
rim and that the necessary shot
clock violation was never called.
But after viewing replays that con
firmed that the ball knicked the
rim, the referees upheld the play
and the final outcome of the
game.
As McDonald pointed out,
"You want to win every game,"
especially the last home game of
the season, a farewell for seniors
Alex Gelbard, Madsen and Mose
ley at Maples Pavilion. But at this
point in the season, a loss is not all
bad, particularly fora team which
had almost been on auto-pilot —
Stanford had won its past 13
games by an average margin of
more than 25 points.
"We haven't been in a close
game in a long time," said Mont
gomery. "We haven't faced a situ
ation in a while where we had to
think for 40 minutes."
Of course if Stanford wins to
morrow against an Arizona team
reeling from an awful weekend in
Oregon and playing without All
conference center Loren Woods,
many of the memories from Sat
urday will lade. But what was one
of the best games in college bas
ketball this year will not be forgot
ten easily, especially by Stanford.
"We're taking this game as a
challenge." said Moseley, who
scored a game-high 22 points, as
Madsen sat by nodding in agree
ment. "We're going to challenge
each other not to let it happen
again."

but stormed back to beat the
Golden Bears by 21 in Berkeley.
Saturday, as they welcomed Rush
back from a 24-game suspension,
the Bruins fell behind 19-4 in the
opening minutes before again
showing their resiliency and their
shooting proficiency.
The Bruins, who missed all 14
of their three-point attempts in
Stanford's 15-point win in early
February, shot 52 percent from
behind the arc for Saturday's
game. Inside the line, they were
just as good. UCLA, which shot
54.5 percent overall, became the
first team all season to hit more
than half of its shots against Stan
ford.
"We didn't play good defense
today," said Stanford point guard
Mike McDonald. "Any team that
can shoot 50 percent against us
deserves to beat us."
The Bruins may have deserved
to beat Stanford, but they almost
didn't.
In regulation, UCLA needed a
baby hook at the buzzer from
Jerome Moiso, who finished with
17 points and 12 rebounds, to ex
tend the game and nullify a three
that McDonald hit only seconds
before.
Then in overtime, Stanford
had the game locked up with a
four-point lead and less than a
minute remaining. But Rush,
who scored a team-high 19 points
on 7-of-10 shooting and later hit
the game-winning shot with three
seconds left, nailed a three-point
er over Mark Madsen from be
yond NBA territory to close the
gap to one point with 42 seconds
on the clock. Jarron Collins was
then called fora five-second viola
tion on the subsequent inbounds

play and the wild finish ensued.
After a buzzer-beating prayer
from McDonald fell short, even
more bedlam erupted. The Bru
ins— many shirtless, all ecstatic —
piled on each other at midcourt
while Montgomery and Stanford
protested that Ray Young's
midrange fadeaway with nine sec
onds left had come up short of the
rim and that the necessary shot
clock violation was never called.
But after viewing replays that con
firmed that the ball knicked the
rim, the referees upheld the play
and the final outcome of the
game.
As McDonald pointed out,
"You want to win every game,"
especially the last home game of
the season, a farewell for seniors
Alex Gelbard, Madsen and Mose
ley at Maples Pavilion. But at this
point in the season, a loss is not all
bad, particularly fora team which
had almost been on auto-pilot —
Stanford had won its past 13
games by an average margin of
more than 25 points.
"We haven't been in a close
game in a long time," said Mont
gomery. "We haven't faced a situ
ation in a while where we had to
think for 40 minutes."
Of course if Stanford wins to
morrow against an Arizona team
reeling from an awful weekend in
Oregon and playing without All
conference center Loren Woods,
many of the memories from Sat
urday will lade. But what was one
of the best games in college bas
ketball this year will not be forgot
ten easily, especially by Stanford.
"We're taking this game as a
challenge." said Moseley, who
scored a game-high 22 points, as
Madsen sat by nodding in agree
ment. "We're going to challenge
each other not to let it happen
again."

Gelbard, Madsen and Jarron
Collins look on in disbelief as UCLA
ekes out a victory over the Cardinal.
In the emotional final mo
ments of Saturday's game against
UCLA, Stanford's final home
game of the season, the players on
the court and the ball they were
batting around accelerated to a
blur.

A ridiculously long three from
the recently reprieved Jaßon
Rush, a five-second violation, an
almost airball, a frantic scrum, a
loose ball in David Moseley's
hands, a pass off Casey Jacobsen's
fingertips, another Rush make, a
missed half court heave at the
buzzer, a protest, a celebration, an
upset win and, for Stanford, an
improbable 94-93 overtime loss.
Blink and you missed it.
"1 could've called a timeout,"
said Moseley, who had the ball
firmly within his grasp as he fell to
the floor underneath the Stanford
basket with five seconds left. "1
could've just held the ball because
we had the possession arrow. I
tried to get it to Casey, he mishan
dled it, Rush got it, hit the shot
and we were like 'Oh, all that hap
pened just like that.' "
Fora team that had steam
rolled through the Pacific 10 Con
ference, winning 13 straight
games by at least 10 points, the
end of this epic game seemed like
it came a little early, even if the two
teams did play an extra five min
utes. For the first time in almost
two months, previously No. 1
Stanford had lost.
Combined with Arizona's two
straight defeats last week, the Car
dinal's loss took some air out of to
morrow night's clash with the
Wildcats (24-6, 13-3 Pac-10) in
Tucson, Ariz. But the implications
of the game are still intact.
A Stanford win gives the Cardi
nal (25-1, 14-2) its second straight
conference championship and a
good shot at earning a No. 1 seed
in the NCAA Tournament. A loss
to Arizona will throw tournament
seedings fora loop but likely
means the two teams will share the
Pat-10 crown.
"Our job has not changed since
two months ago," said Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery.
"We have to go down into Arizona
and win."
Going into last weekend,
UCLA had a similar mindframe:
go north and win. With a possible
berth in the NCAA Tournament
at stake, the previously under
achieving Bruins needed to win at
least one, it not both of their
games against California and
Stanford.
Thursday night, UCLA, which
leads the Pac-10 in shooting per
centage, fell behind by 19 points
but stormed back to beat the
Golden Bears by 21 in Berkeley.
