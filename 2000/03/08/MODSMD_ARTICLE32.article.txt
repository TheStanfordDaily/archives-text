# UCLA stuns Cardinal, 'Cats still loom
## Despite upset loss to Bruins, Stanford is still in driver's seat for Pac-10 championship 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
In the emotional final mo
ments of Saturday's game against
UCLA, Stanford's final home
game of the season, the players on
the court and the ball they were
batting around accelerated to a
blur.

A ridiculously long three from
the recently reprieved Ja√üon
Rush, a five-second violation, an
almost airball, a frantic scrum, a
loose ball in David Moseley's
hands, a pass off Casey Jacobsen's
fingertips, another Rush make, a
missed half court heave at the
buzzer, a protest, a celebration, an
upset win and, for Stanford, an
improbable 94-93 overtime loss.
Blink and you missed it.
"1 could've called a timeout,"
said Moseley, who had the ball
firmly within his grasp as he fell to
the floor underneath the Stanford
basket with five seconds left. "1
could've just held the ball because
we had the possession arrow. I
tried to get it to Casey, he mishan
dled it, Rush got it, hit the shot
and we were like 'Oh, all that hap
pened just like that.' "
Fora team that had steam
rolled through the Pacific 10 Con
ference, winning 13 straight
games by at least 10 points, the
end of this epic game seemed like
it came a little early, even if the two
teams did play an extra five min
utes. For the first time in almost
two months, previously No. 1
Stanford had lost.
Combined with Arizona's two
straight defeats last week, the Car
dinal's loss took some air out of to
morrow night's clash with the
Wildcats (24-6, 13-3 Pac-10) in
Tucson, Ariz. But the implications
of the game are still intact.
A Stanford win gives the Cardi
nal (25-1, 14-2) its second straight
conference championship and a
good shot at earning a No. 1 seed
in the NCAA Tournament. A loss
to Arizona will throw tournament
