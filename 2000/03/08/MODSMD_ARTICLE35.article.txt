# Saturday's defeat doesn't detract from contributions of seniors Madsen and Moseley

It would've been tough to write
a better Senior Night script than
the final Stanford men's
basketball home game of the
1998-99 season: say good-bye to a
quartet of starters who carried

you to the Final
Four, clobber
Arizona, cut
down the nets
to celebrate the
school's first
ever Pacific 10
Co 11 fere 11 ce
title.
When Stan
ford bid

farewell to Art Lee, Kris Weems,
Tim Young and Peter Saner last
year, sportswriters talked of the
end of an era — these were the
men who, with apologies to
Brevin Knight, really put Cardi
nal basketball on the national
map. And their college careers cli
maxed at that final home game.
The 1999-2000 Senior Night
did not run so smoothly. After
riding an emotional high to an
early 19-4 lead, Stanford fell prey
to a hot L (,IA team and fell 94-93
in an overtime slugfest. Instead of
leaving the gym one last time to a
deafening roar, Cardinal senior


Jim Tankersley
starters Mark Madsen and David
Moseley walked out in a stunned
silence.
I hey also walked out with a 25-
2 record and a chance to wrap up
another Pac-lO title and probably
the No. 1 seed in the NCAA's West
Regional tomorrow in Arizona.

They walked out with the knowl
edge that they lost to a very good
UCIA team (you hate to play
what-if, but if the NCAA doesn't
suspend Jaßon Rush for most of
the season and Baron Davis
doesn't bolt early for the NBA
draft, UCLA is probably a national
title contender).
And they walked oil having
proven, in the course of perhaps the
finest regular season in Cardinal his
tory, that eras don't end for Stan

ford men's hoops anymore. They
just pile one on top of the other.
Madsen and Moseley came to
Stanford in 1996 in the final year
of the Brevin Era, and they
shocked the nation by upsetting
Tim Duncan and Wake Forest in
the NCAA second round and near
ly knocking off Keith Van Horn's
Utah team in the Sweet Sixteen.
A year later, Art Lee carried the
Cardinal to the Final Four with a
late-game barrage against Rhode

Island. He capped the miracle
comeback with a steal and pass to
Madsen, whose slam dunk and en
suing arm-waving celebration
made a highlight reel image that
will be replayed for years to come
at tournament time.
But Lee and company didn't
fare well in their last go at the tour
nament, an unispired second
round loss to Gonzaga. Madsen
was by far the Cardinal's best play
er in that game, scoring 15 points
and pulling down 14 boards.
Moseley, in contrast, clocked just
12 minutes in the game and didn't
make a basket.
Even if the Cardinal suffers a
similar fate this year, Stanford fans
will remember Madsen and Mose
ley for their hard work, their up
beat attitudes, their constant im
provement over a four-year ca
reer.
They have each in their own
way come to symbolize the ideal
Mike Montgomery player: tough,
coachable, willing to put the team
ahead of themselves. Madsen fit
that bill his first day in a Cardinal
uniform; Moseley needed three
years to blossom into the consistent
player and leader that he is today.
Both are models for their younger
teammates.
Both also understand that this
season didn't peak at their last home
game. Arizona's loss at Oregon Sat
urday evening means that even
after falling to UCLA, Stanford can
still claim the Pac-10 title outright
with a win tomorrow in Tucson,
Ariz. Then comes the Tournament,
and a chance at redemption.
A chance to carve their own era
into the school record books.
