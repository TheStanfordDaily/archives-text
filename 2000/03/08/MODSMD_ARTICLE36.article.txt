Junior Misty Hyman says that
the Cardinal has a good shot at
the national title this year.
I I lis year's meet will be more
quality-oriented than it has been
in t he past," Hyman said.
"Because there are so many
strong teams, no one will be able
to dominate the meet with
depth. I lie team with the most
individuals and relays in the top
eight will end up winning the
meet."
Despite the tough competi
tion. the Cardinal has a long
background of dominance. It
lias been a swimming power
house for over a decade, placing
in the top three at the NCAA
championships for over eight

This year, she heads into the

) Hyman says she is prepared
to face stiff competition this year.
• "My events will be much more
competitive than they have been
for the last two years," Hyman
said. "There are a lot of fast
swimmers out there."
In spite of her past successes,
Hyman is focused on the upcom

about her glorious past.
