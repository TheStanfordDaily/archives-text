# Men's swim takes Pac-10 title
## With 19th-straight conference title wrapped up, men look ahead to national meet 
### KELLIE WIGINTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It has nothing to do with luck. It is more than
just a winning attitude. And it is more than just
a tradition. After winning last weekend's Pacific
10 Championships in Federal Way, Wash., and
extending the most impressive conference win
ning streak in history to 19 consecutive titles, the
Stanford men's swim program continues its

reign as the most successful team in Pac-10 his
tory.
In the diving portion of the meet which took
place one week ago, Cardinal divers Mark
Michelin and Gavin Ohnstead earned 75 points
for Stanford. Their performances were strong
but left the swimmers in fourth place before any
of the team events had even been raced.
However, the Cardinal swimmers did more
than just pick up the slack — they dominated
the swim lanes. Once again, Stanford relied on
its depth to gain the lead. Cardinal swimmers
finished First in nine of the 18 events over the
course of the weekend, but it was also their sec
ond, third and fourth place finishes which
helped secure the conference title.

"This weekend was just a great, great team ef
fort," said head coach Skip Kenney. "So many
people swam well and contributed to us win
ning"
"This meet was such a team effort,' said ju
nior Adam Messner. "During the meet, 1 would
look around and just feel like I was surrounded
by greatness and magic."
"We knew we had talent. We just had to real
ize it throughout the year," said senior co-cap
tain Kurt Spenser. "It all just came together for
us at the right time."
Freshmen Randall Bal and Dan Westcott
continued to swim impressively, as they have
since t lit* start of the season.
"Our freshmen are as good as
any freshman class we've ever had
here," kenney said. " The drops in
their times from high school till
now are better than we've ever
had."
In the first day of competition,
Stanford finished first in only one
of the five events — the 400-meter
medley relay. The relay team of
Bal. junior Anthony Robinson, se
nior (ilenn Counts and Messner
won the event and set a new meet
record with a time of three min
utes, 10.61 seconds.
After the second day of races,
however, the Cardinal had gained
momentum that it wouldn't lose,
winning six of that day's seven
events.
The 200-yard relay medley

team of Bal, Robinson, Spenser
and ('ounis finished first, and set a
new meet record .is well (1:26.68).
1 lie 800-meter free relay team of
freshman Creg Long, junior
Steven Brown, 112 reshman John Wa
ters and Messner also finished first.
()ther (Cardinal winners includ
ed Brown in the 400-meter indi
vidual medley, Wescott in the 100-
meter butterfly, Messner in the
200-meter freestyle, and Bal in the
100-meter backstroke.
In the final day of competition,
Bal won the 200-meter back
stroke and Messner won the 200-
meter fl\.
"Something we always talk
about is how we stand on the shoul
ders of giants." Spenser said. "We
are so lnck\ to have such great tra
dition and great alumni."
Next on Stanford's agenda is
the NCAA Championship, where
12 Cardinal swimmers will com
pete March in Minneapolis,
Minn.
