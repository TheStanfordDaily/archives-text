# Men's swim takes Pac-10 title
## With 19th-straight conference title wrapped up, men look ahead to national meet

It has nothing to do with luck. It is more than
just a winning attitude. And it is more than just

10 Championships in Federal Way, Wash., and
extending the most impressive conference win

Stanford men's swim program continues its

reign as the most successful team in Pac-10 his

However, the Cardinal swimmers did more

course of the weekend, but it was also their sec
ond, third and fourth place finishes which
helped secure the conference title.

"This weekend was just a great, great team ef

people swam well and contributed to us win

"This meet was such a team effort,' said ju

look around and just feel like I was surrounded
by greatness and magic."

us at the right time."
