where the nation-leading Cardi
nal shot a dismal 4 for 23.
"We live and die by the three,
and we were dying by it," said
head coach Tara VanDerveer.
1 lowever, the real story of the
game was the play of Bruin se
niors Maylana Martin and Janae
Hubbard. At Maples Pavilion
earlier this season, the two com
bined for only three points as
they sat with foul trouble. How
ever, on home turf they sent a
clear message to the Cardinal.
Martin scored a game-high 22
points, 20 of them in the second
half, while Hubbard grabbed 1.3
rebounds, including nine offen
sive boards.

beyond the statistics.
"[(iome/.] was a real kev to
their team," VanDerveer said.
"She calms the floor down and

as Stanford pulled off the nail
biter.
Senior Milena Mores led Stan

for-8 mark from the free-throw
line in Sunday's game.
"When you come down to your
last lew games you want to make
every one special," said Mores of
her performance.
Stanford struggled throughout
most of the game, as USC's tough
man-to-man defense limited shots
and forced turnovers. For the sec -
ond straight game, the Cardinal
did not hit a single outside shot in
the first half, relying on Flores to
drive through the lane and lay the
ball into the basket.
Perhaps the low-point of the
game for the Cardinal came with
10:30 left in the first point, when
freshmen guard Jamie Carey left
the game after hitting the floor
hard as she got tangled up going
fora rebound. Carey, who has
been battling injuries all season,
sustained a probable concussion,
but returned in the second half for
Stanford.
After Carey left the game, the
Trojans went on a 9-4 run that
gave them a nine-point lead over

committed 10 turnovers, shot only
1 lord from the free-throw line and
didn't connect on a single three
pointer, but some how managed to
go to the locker room down by only
two.
However, UCL\came out after
half-time in a whirlwind and the
Maylana Martin game began. Mar
tin hit two lay-ups early oil Come/
assists and didn't slow clown for the
rest of the game, showing Stanford
why she was the 1998-99 I'ac-10
flayer of the Year.
The Cardinal stayed dose to
I (;i.A throughout tin* half but was
never able to gain the lead. With
just minutes to pla\ Stanford went
down 58-50, its largest deficit of the
game.
Freshman Jamie Carey hit a
three to put Stanford within five
with 1:03 left in regulation. I low
ever, as the Cardinal was forced to
foul, the free-throw shooting of
UCLA's Nicole kaczniarski kept
the Bruins comfortably in the lead.
Carey hit two more threes in the
final 22 seconds, but it was too little
too late lor Stanford.
Carey led the Cardinal with lb
points. Flores added 12 points and

Stanford continued to struggle,
acquiring its seventh foul at the
nine-minute mark sending the
Women of Troy into the bonus
early in the half. The Cardinal
went into the locker room down
33-24.
Stanford's troubles continued
throughout most of the second
half, as it struggled to adjust to the
Trojan defense.
Whenever the game became
close, a USC player hit a three,
putting the lead out of reach for
Stanford.
However, in the second half it
was the Trojans that acquired early
fouls, allowing the Cardinal to fight
back at the free-throw line. A Flores
drive put the Cardinal within four.

sophomore Lauren St. Clair
drained a three, putting Stanford
down by only one.

51, giving the team its first lead of
the game since the opening min

stayed within one or two of the Car
dinal until the end, but Stanford hit
its free throws down the stretch to
cement the game.
In addition to the 8-for-8 effort
of Flores, Donaphin went 7-for-7 at
the free-throw line, as Stanford
shot an impressive 84.6 percent
from the charity stripe, including a
20-for-22 mark in the second half.
Stanford now heads into a criti
cal last week in the conference.
With the Pac-10 race still tight, and
tough games against Arizona and
Arizona State, the Cardinal will
have to be at the top of its game.
"We have to finish strong," said
head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"We're looking forward to playing
Arizona. We know that we are
going to have to play well and [Ari
zona is] going to be dangerous
coming off that big loss against
Oregon."
