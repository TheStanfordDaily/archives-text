# ASSU to post election guide, candidate profiles online
## 
### MEGAN KNIZE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the first time, all ASSU candidate profiles and
election rules will be available to students in an on-line
elections guide only, eliminating the paper version
that has been traditionally distributed.
"The purpose of the election handbook is to pro
vide the student body with information about issues,"
said Klections (Commissioner Jason Rang, an econom
ics co-terminal student. "Because 99.9 percent of stu
dents \ote online, ii makes sense for this to be online."
Rang acknowledges that some students may not
visit the Web site. "It's a concern," he said.
"I don't think people will use [the online guide],"
freshman Emily Dully said. "If vou walk into your

room, [the paper guide is] right there, and you don't
have to search for it."
Kim Chan, a senior majoring in Computer-Gener
ated Imagery, is designing the site.
"The medium will allow [the elections guide] to be
more friendly," Chan said. "The process is smoother
for us, and we're hoping many students will use the
guide."
Last year, students could access election informa
tion in both paper and online guides, but Rang said he
decided to eliminate the paper guide earlier this year.
"Last year, we had both, and our resources were
spread too thin," Rang said. He added that he was dis
appointed when, after putting handbooks under the
doors of students' rooms, "they
were still there a few days later.
There was definitely apathy."
Though some believe there
might be even more apathy if stu
dents aren't given the guide direct
ly in their rooms, Kang hopes to
encourage more student visits to
the site by giving away an iMac in a
drawing for students who use the
site. Chan also hopes the iMac in
creases voter turnout.
"The iMac will hopefully ensure
people will go online and at least
check out the site," she said.
"I don't think it will have a dras
tic eflect, and it will put the power
in the hands of the students," said
junior Mike Dudas, who is running
on a presidential slate.
Kang still believes the new
guide will be far superior to the old
one, adding that each candidate
will not be bound by the limitations
of the paper version.
"Candidates can submit up to
two pages of information about
themselves, rather than just 50
words like before." In addition to

reading their statements, students
will also be able to look at pictures
of the candidates.
"They can look at the pictures
and say, 'I know that guy, he's in
my CI V class, he's a smart guy, I'm
going to vote for him.' "
Kang said one of the benefits of
the online elections guide is that it
will not only save paper but it will
also save money, which can then be
used to publicize the guide and
publish more flyers to post in acad
emic departments. He also said the
online guide may be ready earlier
than ever before.
"I'm working on it tins week
and next week and I'm aiming to
have the design done before spring
break, or maybe at the very begin
ning of spring quarter," Chan said.
"We're hoping to have it up
four weeks before the elections,"
Kang said. This year elections will
be held on April ICJ1 C J and 20, which
means the guide should be up
when students return from spring
break.
Two teams of juniors have an
nounced their candidacy for ASSU
president and vice president. Seth
Newton and Malia Vilayas will
compete with Benjamin Liu and
Mike Dudas for the positions.
