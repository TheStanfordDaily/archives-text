# Baseball sweeps weekend with Broncos
## Broncos of Santa Clara now winless in last 14 games against Stanford 
### BRETT KAUFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the No. 2 Cardinal's bats showed signs of life last
weekend against Santa Clara, its pitching once again stole
the show and led Stanford to a three-game sweep and its
14th straight win over the Broncos dating back to 1997.
Friday night's outing by junior Justin Wayne set the
tone for the series, during which Bronco hitters simply
could not figure out Cardinal hurlers. Wayne improved
to 21-1 all-time at Stanford while tossing his first career
shutout in a brilliant performance on the hill.
Wayne's start was an absolute gem as he allowed just
three hits and struck out 12 Bronco batters. It was his
third straight start with 10 or more strikeouts.
"He mixed well, he got his breaking ball over any time
he wanted . . . he's a great college pitcher, no doubt about
it," said Santa Clara head coach Mike Cummins.
Stanford's No. 1 starter did not benefit from an out
pouring of offense, as the Cardinal collected just one run
on five hits against Broncos freshman Matt Travis. Travis
stood up to Wayne's challenge and made the game a clas
sic pitching duel, throwing for eight 112 ull innings and keep
ing a struggling Stanford offense without any opportuni
ties to blow the game open.
Wayne felt the pressure of a close contest and needed

to react with poise
Friday night, watch
ing his team score its
only run on a sacri
fice fly in the sixth
from senior Ed
mund Muth.
"When I go out
there, I'm not trying
to give up less runs
than the other
team," Wayne said.
"I'm going to try and
put up none."
Wayne looks as if
he may do just that
every time lie takes
the mound, improv
ing his season record
to 5-0 in six starts
with a minuscule
1.61 ERA.
Another encour
aging outing from
junior Jason Young
provided the book
end to the series with
an 8-3 win on Sun
day, as he threw six
strong innings with a
season-high nine

strikeouts lor his second win of the vear. Young did not
allow an earned run in the game and looked to have made
a full recover) from his shoulder injurv in carl\ February.
Young felt no pain and pitched without the lear of re
injuring his right shoulder. 1 le said he fee ls like he is back
to top physical condition, and with 12 da\s of rest before
his next start —at home against I S(. — Young should re
tun i to be the dominant lorce on the hill that set Stanford
records for both innings pitched and strikeouts last sea

With its starters rolling along and proving to be (he best
three-man rotation in the counti \, the (Cardinal began to
c reate some oflcnse inainh through big innings to lead
the wax to the sei ies sweep.
After being silenced In Travis in Friday night's opener,
the Cardinal bats came alive in the second inning ol S.it
urda\ s contest, the onl\ game ol the sei ies playeel at Bui k
Shaw Stadium in Santa Clara instead of Sunken Dia

to take the lead lor good and win 0-4.

I he* Cardinal's season-high six doubles on Saturday
and Muth's fourth home run of the year were good
enough lor the win as sophomore Brian Sager gave up
only three earned runs on four hits before making way for
sophomore Jeff Bruksch.
Bruksch proved yet again that he can handle the role
of closer in the Stanford bullpen, a spot yet to be secured
by any one pitcher. He gained his fourth save of the year
by retiring the potential tying run in the bottom of the
itint li inning 011 a fielder's choice.
"I always feel like it's my game from the time I get in
there," Bruksch said.
Despite the big second inning on Saturday, Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess was still disappointed in his
team's offensive showing. For Sunday's contest, he reacted
In moving senior Craig Thompson out of the leadoff spot
in favor of junior Billy Jacobson, whose speed and .333 bat
ting average make him a nice fit at the top of the order.
