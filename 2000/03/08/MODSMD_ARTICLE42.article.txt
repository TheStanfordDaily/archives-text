# Women's tennis sweeps UA, ASU
## Dominating wins in the desert mark 32nd- and 33rd-straight dual match victories for Cardinal 
### BILL HANSON STAFF WRITER 
The women's tennis team has
never had a more relaxing trip to
Arizona.
The plane ride was smooth,
the weather was cooperative and
the residents of Tuscon and
Tempe couldn't have been more
welcoming.
And, amid all the fun, the team
managed to trample over both Ari
zona and Arizona State, conceding
a mere point in the process.
On Friday, the top-ranked Car
dinal (15-0,4-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) crushed its first victims, the
lOth-ranked Sundevils (3-1, 1-1),
6-1.
The Sundevils' lone victory
came at the No. 6 singles position.
In that match, 81st-ranked Megan
Yeats upended senior Jennifer
Heiser, 6-2,6-3.
Sophomore Lauren Kalvaria
suffered the afternoon's only other
scare at the No. 4 spot, rallying to
overcome 92nd-ranked Mhairi
Brown, 6-3,3-6,6-1.
Heiser and kalvaria's troubles,
however, are understandable.
Despite playing No.'s 4 and 6,
Yeats and Brown are two of Ari
zona State's three highest-ranked
players.
The Sundevils, playing without
sophomore star Allison Bradshaw,
may have toyed with their line-up
in an attempt to rattle the Cardinal.
T he tactic backfired. While
Heiser lost, Kalvaria held off
Brown.
Meanwhile, the rest of the Stan
ford squad was busy dismantling
the remaining Sundevils in straight
sets.
Sophomore Gabriela Lastra

cruised past Arizona State's Cclena
McCoury, 6-4, 6-3, at No. 5, while
senior I eryn Ashley topped Faye
DeVera, 6-3,6-2, at the No. 3 spot.
Lastra has now won 14 straight
matches. Ashley, meanwhile, is
showing no signs of the wrist injury
that plagued her during the
preseason.
"I felt like I hit the hall pretty
well." Ashley said. "I adjusted well
to the windy conditions and play ed
smart tennis. In years past, we've
had a hard time in Arizona, espe
cially against ASU."
At the No. 2 spot, freshman
Laura Granville routed Kerr) Gia
rdino, 6-1,6-2.
The win was Granville's first as
the nation's top-ranked player.
On March 1, Granville found
herself atop the national rankings
for the first time, wrestling the
honor away from University of San
Diego star Zuzana Lesenarova.
Granville, who won the Kolcx
National Intercollegiate Indoor
Championships, the third leg of the
collegiate Grand Slam, in early
February, has amassed an unri
valed 30-2 singles record this sea
son.
"I think it's great," Ashley said.
"She deserves to be No. I. She has
the best record in the country. ()n
both Friday and Saturday, she was
the first off the court. She's not re
ally being challenged. There are
very few players that can challenge
her."
()ne of the players that can chal
lenge her, of course, is sophomore
Marissa Irvin, who last season
reached the finals of the NCAA
Championships and finished the
season ranked second in the na
tion.
