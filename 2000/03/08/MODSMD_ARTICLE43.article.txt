### SAMEER AHMED STAFF WRITER 
After an amazing winter quarter in which
the undefeated Stanford men's tennis team
(9-0) reclaimed its position as the No. I team
in the country, the players will gel a very well
deserved and needed two-week break.
Currently, four of the ten members of
the team are recovering from injuries.
Sophomore K.J. Hippensteel, who has not
played in a single dual match this year, has
been sidelined with a case of mononucleosis.
Junior Scotty Scott missed the Cardinal's
match against Cal last week because of a
wrist injury, while freshmen Scott Lipsky
and Ryan Haviland are both out with re
cently developed stress fractures. Head
coach Dick Gould hopes that all four players
will be ready to compete in the spring.
Because of the injuries, Gould could only
send two doubles teams this weekend to the
Pacific Coast Doubles Championship, an
open event mixing collegiate players with
independent teams, in La jolla, Calif.
l he first duo, junior .Alex Kim and senior
Geoif Abrams, breezed their way into the fi
nals before the championship match was
canceled because of rain. Kim and Abrams,
the No. 1 collegiate team in the nation, wei e
leading Kelly Gullet and Peter Smith, 2-1, in
tlu- finals when the rain hit.
Gullet, a former player at Pepperdine,
competes on the pro tour, and Smith coach
es the Waves men's tennis team. The tour
nament final has been rescheduled lor
March 2b.
"As the defending champions, .Alex and
Geoff completely outclassed everyone on
their way to the finals," (iould said.
Stanford's second doubles team, fresh

men David Martin and Carter Morris, play
ing together for the first time, reached the
second round of the tournament before los
ing in a three set marathon, 6-3, 4-6, 7-6, to
James Malhame and Casey Smith of Notre
Dame.
'l'he Cardinal's achievements this week
end represent the overall succ ess it has had
the entire quarter. Perhaps the greatest
highlight of the season so far was Stanford's
title two weeks ago at the USTA/ITA Na
tional Team Indoor Championships, the
premier indoor team event of the season. At
the tournament, the Cardinal competed
against the top teams in the country before
knocking off conference rival and No. 2
UCLA in the finals.
Stanford has excelled individually as
well. In the latest 1 I'A singles rankings, Kim
and Hippensteel were ranked second and
third, respectively. Kim, who has won sin
gles titles at the 11 A Regionalsand National
Collegiate Classic this season, has won 10
matches over ranked players this season. Al
though Hippensteel has not played since
mid-January, he remained at No. 3 on the
strength of his singles title at the ITA All-
American Championships in October.
Abrams was also ranked eleventh.
On the doubles side, the Cardinal have
two of the top ten teams in the country. Kim
<m<l Abrams continue their long run at the
No. 1 spot while freshman David Martin
and 1 fippensteel are ranked ninth.
"1 am pleased with the progress that the
team has made this quarter," Could said.
"We have solidified ourselves as one of the
top teams, but there's still tons we can do to
get better."
After a two-week hiatus, the Cardinal will
return to action on March 22 against BYU,
beginning a 9-match home stand. Stanford
will also host Cleinson and Cal over spring
break.
"While I BYU, Clemson and Cal] aren't
top-ten teams, they will be good matches to
get back in the swing of things," Could said.
"As long as we get healthy and play hard, we
should be okav."
