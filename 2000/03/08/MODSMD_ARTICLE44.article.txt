# Bears, Slugs both humbled by Card
## Men's volleyball crushes California and UC-Santa Cruz in easy weekend 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
Two weeks ago the California men's basket
ball team left Maples Pavilion with egos battered
.and dignity destroyed after a humiliating 101-
50 Stanford blowout. Friday night Cat came
-back to Maples only to suffer a similar fate. But
this time it was the volleyball team's turn to have
"its way with the Golden Bears.
In its first of two victories this weekend, No.
14 Stanford (8-7, 7-5 Mountain Pacific Sports
•Federation) sailed over Cal's club team (4-1) 15-
11,15-12, 1 5-9 iu an exhibition match. Saturday
'.night Stanford continued to dominate as it shut
down lilt' Banana Slugs in Santa (iruz, 15-9, 15-
(i, 15-8.
The matches gave Stanford a chance to start
a different lineup and welcome back senior cap
tain Josh Palacios, who has been out all season
with a shoulder injur}'. The (Cardinal's inexperi
enced bench, loaded with freshmen, seemed to
have no trouble stepping up this weekend. The
sijuad now looks to take a break before resum
ing conference play in three weeks.
Stanford's depth showed in its strength this
weekend, with the nation's kill leader, freshman
Can t Toppel, on the bench along with sopho
more Marcus Skacel and junior Brett Young
berg.
"It was a great opportunity for guys who
haven't been getting consistent match e\p» isurc
to be able to hit with confidence and to be
putting balls away all night," junior Curtis Gra
ham said alter the Santa Cru/ game. "Kven
though we haven't played together much, we
plavcd with confidence and got the job done. It
was a great team effort."
I lead coach Ruben Nieves noted the team's
side-out game as an integral part <>l the squad's
success this weekend.
"Siding-out starts with our two passers. Josh
Palacios was half of that and Seth J Ring| was the
other half. I hey passed well enough that we
were able to side-out," Nieves said of Friday's
match."()verall we sided-out well and we sided
out when we had to."
"Our mental toughness really showed,"
freshman Paul Bocage said. "We got down, but
kept siding-out and look advantage ol opportu
nities to score points when they came. '
Stanford finished the night with each of its at
tackers in double digits for kills. Graham led the
offensive effort with his career-high IS kills,
while Bocage and redshirt freshman Jon I'ala
cios both posted career-highs as well, with 14
kills apiece and .632, .500 hitting percentages
respectively.
Ring left the libera position in favoi of ou*-
side hitter and recorded a double-double with
12 kills and 15 digs. Freshman William Curtis
rounded out the attack with 10 kills on the
night.
Palacios seemed to need little time breaking
back into collegiate pla\ as he notched 13 digs as
libera.

"My shoulder felt good," Palacios said. "A
couple of times I held myself back, but for the
most part I did more than I have been doing in
practice. I felt I was able to contribute in the ca
pacity I wanted to without hurting the team
with m\ limitations."
| Palac ios sj ser\e-receivc was solid." Nieves
said. llc was ver\ poised and played pretty ag
gressively considering his shoulder. 1 le's a fifth
year senior, and when he plays, it shows. It's nice
to have him back playing."
Saturday night was much of the same Cardi
nal domination, as the Banana Slugs would stay
with Stanford through the beginning of each
game before falling behind as Stanford cruised
on to victory.
"It was a good night of side-outs," Nieves
said. "We just kept siding-out and eventual!)
they'd make a mistake or we would make a go< xl
block or a dig. Our side-out game allowed us to
control the match."
Stanford held Santa Cru/ to a .088 hitting
percentage, the lowest hitting percentage it has
allowed of its opponents this vear. Meanwhile
Stanford hit .372 with Graham posting 15 kills,
while Bocage had I I and freshman Kyle Stra
che recorded 10.
"We were very poised throughout the
match," Nieves said, referring to the noise and
heckling that filled Santa Cruz's tightly packed
gym. "It was a nice improvement over the way
we responded to a similar environment in
use."

Now Stanford lias lime to rest before a re
match with Cal on Mar. 21 before playing in
front of thousands in Hawaii against the No. 5
Rainbows (9-5, 5-4).
The matches in Hawaii will be critical in de
termining Stanford's place in tlit* conference as
wins wou'd put tliein in good position fora
lliird-place finish in the conference and an au
toinatic MI'SK playofl'berth.
Hawaii, like Stanford, has had trouble with
USC and BYI this season, but secured a 3-0 win
over No. 2 Long Beach State, handing the49ers
one of only two losses this season.
Recent injuries to sophomore starting setter
Stefan Krejci and sophomore outside hitter Eyal
/imet ma\ bring some opportunities for Stan
lord. 11 <>w ever, the Cardinal has injuries of its
own to worn about, including Youngberg's
back injury, Toppers sore shoulder and Skacel's
recent knee injury.
Even if krejci and Zimet aren't recovered by
match time, the Cardinal will still have to han
dle freshman Costas Theocharidis and junior
( '.lav Stanley who are fifth and sixth in the con
ferem ( with kill averages of 6.80 and 6.07 re
spectively.
"It'll be a new experience fora lot of our guys
and it's hard to prepare for that situation,"
Nievcs said, referring to large crowd and hype
that the match will draw. "We're going to have
to be sharp. After the layoff , we have to play like
a team that's rested and ready to play at its best,
opposed to a team that's rusty."
