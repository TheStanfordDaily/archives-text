# Duo of wrestlers heads to NCAAs
## Zimmerer makes school-record fourth-straight appearance at Nationals 
### ALEX BENJAMIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships two weeks ago,
the Stanford wrestling team
qualified two wrestlers to go to
the NCAA Championships on
March 16 in St. Louis.
Senior Zach Zimmerer (133
pounds) won his first Pac-10
Championship and also be
came the first Cardinal wrestler
ever to qualify for the NCAAs
four consecutive years.
Fellow senior Warren
McPherson (157) was also able
to qualify by finishing fifth and
being nominated by the league
coaches to represent t he Pac-10
in the national championships
as a wild card.
However, with a season that
has already been plagued by
injuries, the Cardinal just can't
seem to stay healthy.
After Zimmerer's final match
at the Pac-10s, he discovered
that Ik- had a staff infection in his
knee, and he has not been able
to go at full speed since.
Cardinal head coach Chris
Horpel plans to have him back
to complete strength this week.
Despite the injury, for Zim
merer and McPherson it has
still been a time of intense prac
tice to prepare both mentally
and physically for the,NCA<\s.
"They are alternating run
ning stadium stairs or weight
training in the mornings and
we have been doing lots of
NCAA-like matches every
other day in the wrestling
room," Horpel said.
"The rest of the time has
been spent working on tech
nique specific to each qualifi
er's needs."
For the rest of the Stanford
squad, the season seemed to
come to an end at the conclu

sion of the Pac-10s. However,
they too have a lot to do to help
Zimmerer and McPherson
train for nationals.
Despite a two-day break fol
lowing the Pac-10s, much of
the team has been to practice to
serve as workout partners for
the two qualifiers, and some
have begun to train for upcom
ing spring competitions.
As for how the wrestlers
chances are come the NCAAs,
Horpel is optimistic.
"Zach has been there three
times before and knows exactly
what to expect. He has been
ranked as high as sixth in his
weight and only has one loss so
far this season. I think he will
be an All-American, possibly a
national champion. He's just
going to have to be ready to win
the close matches.
"As for Warren, he is one of
the best Vtrestlers I have ever
coached who had never quali
fied until his senior season. He
wants to be an All-American
badly," said Horpel.
Although Warren has to be
considered a dark horse, he
has the ability to beat anybody.
If he put together several good
matches, he, too, will come
home an Ail-American."
In reply, McPherson had
only one comment,
"The only thing that I really
have to say is that my goal is to
be a national champion. I know
that I have the skills. I know
that I have worked hard. I
know that I have the capabili
ties to beat any wrestler on any
given day.
"Anything less than a na
tional championship for me
will be a letdown."
So, come March 16, the two
Cardinal seniors will show
what they have to the best in
the nation.
For Zimmerer, this is his
chance to attain the goal he has
fallen short of the past three
years.
As for McPherson, his first
time attending the tournament
will be his last chance to accom
plish something that he knows
he is capable of.
