# Penn State stops women gymnasts
## Cardinal falls on the road, 196.1-194.7 
### KATIE FITZPATRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the last meet of the regular
season, the streak of command
ing victories came to a close for
the No. 8 Stanford women's gym
nastics team as it fell prey to the
No. I 7 Nittany Lions in Universi
ty Park, Pa., by a final score of
196.1-194.7.
While the Cardinal (8-3, 5-2
Pacific 10 Conference) did not
take advantage of the opportuni
ty to build on its recent success —
possibly due to its grueling travel
ing and competition schedule as
of late — it did show signs of bril
liance.
Junior Jen Exaltacion re
turned to the all-around lineup
after being sidelined with a back
injury to have an incredible meet.
The 1996 Olympian totaled a
39.35 for second in all-around
competition and a personal ca
reer high behind senior team
mate Larissa Fontaine, who con
tinued her streak of wins with a
39.475.
Exaltacion scored a 9.9 on
vault — a career high and a per
fect score on her hand front pike
vault, which is only worth a 9.9.
Sophomore Katy Herbert also
gave a career-high effort on
vault, scoring a perfect 9.8 on her
vault which has a 9.8 start value.
"Jen and Katy were fantastic,"
said senior co-captain Sarah
Harding.
Fontaine, who is currently
ranked second in the nation on
vault, tied Exaltacion with a 9.9.
l lie impressive efforts of the
Exaltacion and 1 lerbert duo were

also highlights for the Cardinal
on beam. The Cardinal needed
big performances from the end of
the beam rotation after having
two falls in the rotation. Exalta
cion and Herbert delivered.
Herbert hit yet another fine
routine, tying for first on the
event with a 9.925. Exaltacion
scored a near-perlect 9.9 on her
beam routine for third on the
event.
Close behind for the Cardinal
were sophomore Becky Mel
drum, who had a 9.775 perfor
mance to lead off the Cardinal
and Fontaine, who earned a
9.875 to finish the Cardinal per
formances for the night.
Stanford's difficulties were not
limited to beam. The Cardinal
opened the competition with a
shaky start on bars. Stanford
couldn't break the 9.80 mark
until Fontaine redeemed the Car
dinal, winning the bar title with a
9.9 performance. Sophomore
Kristin Jensen gave a 9.75 effort,
and freshman Alissa Cooper and
Exaltacion turned in 9.7255.
Stanford also struggled on
floor with shaky tumbling passes.
Exaltacion was the high scorer
for the Cardinal with a 9.825 per
formance. Fontaine and fresh
man Abby Cair were close behind
with 9.80 efforts. However, mis
takes allowed the Cardinal to put
together only a 48.425 on the
event, its lowest event total of the
evening.
While Stanford is disappoint
ed in its performance at Penn
State, it is taking its loss in stride.
"The loss keeps things in per
spective, especially preparing for
Pac-lOs. It will remind us to make
use of each practice and peak
when we need to," said Harding.
