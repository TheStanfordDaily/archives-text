# Softball rebounds in Georgia tourney
## Women come back to take championship in Leadoff Classic's Silver Division 
### EMILY DRESSEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
That old sports cliche, "You
win as a team and you lose as a
team," reminded the No. 9
Stanford Softball team of some
thing this past weekend at the
NFCA Leadoff Classic. It is pos
sible to lose.
The Cardinal flew into
Columbus, Ga., boasting a stel
lar 16-1 record and anxious to
compete in one of the nation's
most prestigious regular-sea
son tournaments. With almost
every top-25 team represent
ed, the squad knew going in
that this would be no picnic at
the park.
After starting flat and losing
in extra innings to then-No. 6
Michigan two weekends ago,
the Cardinal again opened
without its usual zing and
dropped another extra-inning
game, this time to Mississippi
State.
Rain halted play against
Massachusetts Friday evening,
but the interruption didn't
seem to phase the Cardinal,
which destroyed the Minute
women 7-0 the following day.
Saturday marked the turn
ing point for the team as it suf
fered a stinging blow from No.
5 Oklahoma, 8-0, marking its
first loss in regulation play.
After regrouping at the
hotel, the team shut down last
year's tournament champion,
No. 15 Louisiana-Lafayette, 2-1.
The players gave it their all
on Sunday, adding two more
wins and claiming the Silver Di
vision title.
The Cardinal pounded the
same Mississippi State team
they lost to on Friday, 5-1, and
proceeded to beat No. 16 Al
abama 5-2 for the division
championship.
Stanford couldn't seem to
catch any breaks Friday against
Mississippi State. Although
freshman pitcher Dana
Sorensen plowed down three
straight Bulldog batters in the
top of the first, the Stanford of
fense was robbed of several
runs in its half of the first.
Center fielder Jessica Men
doza looped a high ball deep
into right center. The Bulldog
outfielder snagged the air
borne ball as she tumbled right
through the outfield fence.
When the umpire decided
that the controversial catch was
an out, the tone seemed to be
set for the Cardinal.
The game was neck-and
neck until the eighth, when in
international tie-breaker, the

Cardinal could not answer a
Bulldog run.
"The first game of the tour
nament we just came out flat,
not making the proper adjust
ments at the plate," said head
coach John Rittman. "I don't
think our bats were awake yet."
The next morning, No. 5
Oklahoma provided the wake
up call.
After dropping a five-inning
game to the Sooners (cut short
by the eight-run rule) Stanford
walked away a little more hum
bled than usual.
"After we were mercied by
Oklahoma, a lot of emotions
were flying, people were pretty
angry and upset at first,"
Rittman said. "Instead of
pointing the finger we realized
we were going to have to go out
there again and play like we
know how, together as a team."
A rejuvenated Stanford
team stepped onto the field
Saturday night against a tough
No. 15 Louisiana-Layette team
that knew how to use their bats.
Sorensen and Melissa Corona
do, the Lady Cajun's pitcher,
battled it out on the mound.
Sophomore first-baseman
Sarah Beeson's clutch two-run
homer broke the ice in the sixth
and helped Stanford claim vic
tory.
"It was one of those games
you see on TV, the ones where
the player hits the home run to
win the game," Mendoza said.
"We all dog-piled on home
plate as a team. It was one of
those great moments, the ones
where you say to yourself after
ward, "This is why 1 am here.' "
With the Oklahoma game
out of their system, the Cardi
nal returned to the fields Sun
day ready to give it their all.
fhe team was hungry for re
venge against Mississippi State,
and they got what they were
after with a 5-1 win.
The Cardinal's subsequent
5-1 victory over Mississippi
State placed the team in the Sil
ver Division championship
game against No. 16 Alabama,
where freshman pitcher Mau
reen LeCocq got to flaunt her
talent.
LeCocq held the Crimson
fide to two runs and was sup
ported offensively by Walker's
first-ever home run and senior
catcher Kellie Wiginton's two
run homer with two outs in the
second.
"I wasn't really thinking
how good their hitters were,"
LeCocq said.
"I knew I had to be smart,
aggressive and in control. But
my adrenaline was pumping
and 1 was so excited about
pitching that all I wanted to
show was that I was back."
After traveling four straight
weekends, Stanford's next
game isn't until March 19
against Santa Clara at home.
