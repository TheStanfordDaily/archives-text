## Senior Brad Hauser posts NCAA qualifying time in 10,000 meters 
### CHRISTOPHER LYLE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal came home this
weekend and showed their
strength in the Spring Opener, the
first outdoor meet of the season.
Both men's and women's teams
competed with smaller than usual
squads as athletes who qualified for
the NCAA Indoor Championship
meet next week sat out.

Senior Brad Hauser notched an
automatic NCAA qualifying time in
the 10,000-meter run with a blaz
ing 28 minute, 52.63 second effort.
Freshman pole-vaulter Kath
leen Donoghue recorded a provi
sional mark with her vault of 12 feet
9 inches.
Meanwhile, many of the Cardi
nal's top performers are looking
forward to the next two weekends.
The NCAA Indoors will be held
March 10 and 11 in Fayetteville,
Ark., and the World Cross Country
Championships will be March 18 in
Portugal.
"We want all our athletes to
compete and compete well. If we
do that, then hopefully we gener

ate a lot of points," said head coach
Vin Lananna.
Stanford is in good position to
do just that, with a strong list of
qualifiers. For the men, junior
Michael Stember has the fastest
mile time in the nation going into
the meet (3:59.20). In addition,
Stember will be part of the distance
medley relay team which also has
the fastest time in the nation.
Sophomore Cabe Jennings has
the third best mile time in the na
tion (4:00.47), and sophomore
Jonathon Riley will be part of a very
competitive 3,000-meter run.
Senior Brent Hauser also pro
vides great potential to score points
in both the 3,000 and 5,000-meter

runs.
"I will go in focusing on the
5,000 because it's first," Hauser
said. "Alter it's over, I'll recover
and get ready for the 3,000."
Brad Hauser will not be com
peting in indoors this season due to
some questions regarding eligibili
ty. Brad will be running, instead, at
the World Cross Country Champi
onships in two weeks.
"I have keyed off of Brad in a lot
of my races in the past," Brent said.
" This will be an opportunity for me
to run and get experience in a very
competitive race without him. I
also think Brad has a great oppor
tunity to get some experience in
the World Cross Country race."
Senior Toby Stevenson, a re
turning NCAA Indoor Champion,
goes into Saturday's meet with the
fourth best pole vault in the nation.
Lananna expects a top perfor
mance by the men, but he antici
pates stiff competition from
Arkansas. He also sees a potential
top ten performance by the
women.
The women will be led by a
group of three freshmen. Fresh
man Lindsay Hyatt will run the
800, and freshmen Lauren Flesh
man and Erin Sullivan will com
pete in the 3,000. Hyatt will enter
the meet with momentum after set
ting the Stanford school record
with a time of 2:07.63.
The distance medley team also
hopes to contribute to the women's
effort. The DM R team goes into the
meet with the third fastest time in
the nation.
" Fhe indoor season is always
wide open," Lananna said. "I'm ex
cited for the qualifiers — it is a great
opportunity for them and Stanford
— but what I am really interested
in now is the outdoor season. When
March comes to California, we start
thinking about outdoor track."
