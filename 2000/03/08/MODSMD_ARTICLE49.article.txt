### SCOTT FINKELSTEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Cardinal fans had much to cheer for at
Bnrnham Pavilion last Saturday, even though
the Stanford men's gymnastics team lost to Cal
ifornia for the fift.li time this season.
The undefeated Golden Bears (9-0, 9-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation), ranked
eighth nationally, outscored No. 13 Stanford
(6-7, (5-7) by a final tally of 228.95 to 225.60.
Both teams earned easy victories over Arizona
State, a club team finishing with a 208.00.
California performed well on all six events,
securing high scores by hitting routines and
sticking dismounts.
"Although Cal has shown improvement din -
ing the season, I still believe we can beat them
when it counts," said junior Jason Biltz.
The 3.35 margin of victory over the Cardinal
was the narrowest of the season. Halfway
through Saturday's competition, Stanford
trailed the Bears by a mere three-tenths of a
point.
"The first three events were incredible,"
Biltz said. "Unfortunately, we were unable to
keep up that same pace until the end of the
meet."
For the first time this season, Stanford was
strong on pommel horse, winning the event
with a 38.05. Leading the way for the Cardinal
was senior All-American Jason Katsampes with
a 9.95.
Rings continued to be Stanford's corner
stone, as it was the team's best event of the
evening. The Cardinal scored an impressive
38.80, with Katsampes and freshman Marshall
Erwin leading the way with a 9.85 and 9.75 re
spectively.
When the team moved to vault in the fourth
rotation, the momentum slipped away. Just one
of six Cardinal gymnasts landed a vault, as the
team struggled to score a 30.4 on the event.
Stanford finished the meet well on parallel
bars and high bar, posting over 37 points on
both events en route to a much-needed season
high total of 225.6.
"This was a very stressful meet for the team,
and I think everyone stepped up to the pres
sure," Biltz said.
The Cardinal squad was led In Katsampes
who won the all-around competition with a
score of 57.05. Biltz followed closely behind in
the all-around with a 55.60 and third-place
honors.
Although last weekend's meet was the final
regular season competition for the Cardinal,
the team is still uncertain about the status of its
NCAA Championship aspirations.
The top 12 teams in the country will qualify
to compete in lowa City, lowa, at the NCAA
Championships March 30-April 1. The qualify

ing teams w ill be determined in two weeks after
each conference holds its championship coin
petition.
Kadi team's national-qualifying score will be
determined by the average of the highest home
score and two highest away scores, with the con
ference championship score replacing the
highest of the first three stores.
I his makes the conference championship an
extremely important meet for every team, es
pecially lor Stanford. I he Cardinal will com
pete at the M I\SF Championships, which will be
held at the Air Force Academy in Colorado
Springs, Colo., March 17-18.
"Our goal right now is to do well at MPSF's
so we can secure a spot to nationals," junior Re
shad Garan said. "A spot at NCAA's is ours for

the taking if we just step up and hit all six
events."
This weekend's high score should bring
much-needed confidence to the Cardinal
squad. The team has been solid in practice, but
up until this past weekend, it has struggled to
find the same consistency in competition.
"We have the [level of] difficulty to score well
as long as we hit our routines," Garan said. "We
are ready to prove to everyone what we're ca
pable of doing."
Stanford will need to perform at its best at
MPSF's to qualify to NCAA's.
"If we all do our job then our score will speak
for itself," said sophomore David Durante.
"With the talent we have on this team, 1 have no
doubt that we will make it to nationals."
