imimty service, environmental
and general world welfare issues.
Sophomore Erika Moseson is
heading across the border to Can
cun for spring break, courtesy of
Stanford. Moseson will be travel
ing with Geophysics Prof. Robert
Kovacli and the rest of her class
mates from her Geophysics 5 class.
"We're going to study the
Mayan ruins at Chichen It/.a and
Tulum to see what we think about
whether earthquakes could have
been a significant factor in the up
heaval of the Mayan empire," said
Moseson.
The vernal equinox will occur
while her class is in Cancun,
Moseson said. In an annual natur
al phenomenon, snakes emerge 011
the sides of the ruins on that day.
Alternative Spring Break 2000,
Stanford's largest community ser
vice organization, is another way
Stanford students are choosing to
spend their week away from cam
pus. The program is offering four
new trips this year in addition to
the seven it has organized in past
years.
Senior co-coordinator Tammy
Lee is a trip leader for one of the
new trips titled, "Looking for Me in
the Media." This group of Stan
ford students will be staying at a
Unitarian.church in San Francisco
and teaching sixth to eighth
graders about ethics and the
media.
"We will be working with the In
dependent Media Institute," Lee
said, "teaching the kids how to be
critical observers of cigarettes,
body image and gender dynamics
in advertisements."
Applications for Alternative
Spring break are available in the
fall, and participants are required
to enroll in a one-unit preparatory
class given winter quarter. Lee is

helping her team prepare for their
task by leading group discussion in
their class.
Other projects include educa
tion iniatives in HIV/AIDS, U.S.-
Mexico border issues and rural
poverty problems in Oregon.
"The main idea of the Alterna
tive Spring Break trips are to cre
ate hands-on, direct service. Some
yf'the trips, such as the San Fran
cisco media trip, are more educa
tion and knowledge oriented,"
said Lee.
The University bears most of
the program's costs, but each par
ticipant is required to serve one
shift at The Stanford Fund and pay
$95 in fees.
While many students will be en
joying sunny weather or the ski
slopes, junior Jarron Collins, half
of the twin towers of Stanford
men's basketball, would be quite
happy spending his spring break
indoors.
"While the rest of Stanford's
student body will be sitting on a
beach," Collins said, "I will hope
fully be participating in the NCAA
national tournament and winning
a national championship for my
university."
Indianapolis, the site of the
Final Four, isn't traditionally a
happening spring break locale.
Laughing, Collins said, "Yeah, well
that's the hot place to go this time
of year."
Sophomore Jared Stacy,
Collins' friend and housemate,
agreed. "I'm saving my Mexico
money this year and hoping to
watch Jarron andjason play in In
dianapolis instead," said Stacy.
Senior Mike Frumin is planning
to take in the ocean air with a large
group of his friends. His cruise will
depart from Los Angeles, then sail
to Catalina and Ensenada before
returning to Los Angeles.
When asked what he plans on
doing while aboard the cruise ship,
Frumin replied, "It's all you can
eat."
