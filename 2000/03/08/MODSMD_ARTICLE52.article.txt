# Fans flocking to hear a jammin' 'Incident'

### STEVEN RAPHAEL SENIOR MUSIC CRITIC 
Anymore, I just tell people we're a rock band, a
widely eclectic rock band," said Keith Moseley, bass
player for the String Cheese Incident, a nationally
known jam band.
Its 110 wonder Moseley has grown tired of trying
to describe the band, who bring their Winter Carni
val tour to 1 he Warfield for two sold-out nights on
March 17 and 18. After all, when every member
contributes something unique, it can be difficult to
stamp a label on a band.
"It's kind of been that way from the beginning with
this band,' Moseley said. "We cover a lot of ground
stylistically. It's fun as we get better as musicians to
try and tackle some different styles, figure them out,
see what they're all about, learn to play them a little
bit, and then experiment with them."
Consequently, the band incorporates a portion of
nearly every genre into their music. Any given night
may find them playing bluegrass, jazz, funk, rock,
Afro-Cuban, Latin, or even rap. While adding their
own personal touch to everything they play, the
group turns out performances that would satisfy
purists from any of the genres.
Moseley considers himself "the glue" of the band,
holding everything together with his solid, "groovin'
bass lines. Sharing the stage with him are a jazz
pianist, a bluegrass guitarist, an Afro-Cuban and
Latin jazz-influenced drummer, and Michael Kang,
the unique multi-instrumentalist whose sweet violin
and screaming lead mandolin tones arc at the fine
front of the String Cheese sound. It's clear that this
group is one of a kind. "And honestly, every time we
play with someone, we get influenced in some way,'
Moseley said.
I lie String Cheese is famous for their live shows,
which thev refer to as incidents.

"Since the very beginning,"
Moseley said, "one of the goals of
the band was to put on the best
conceit experience: the best
music that we could play through
the best PA system, the best lights
that we could afford, the most
comfortable environment where

people have room and they feel at ease just hanging
out."
This may explain v\ hy fans not only flock to see the
band, hut follow them from town to town dining
tours. "We hope to have people leave our shows feel
ing positive about their lives, empowered a little bit,
and happy," Moseley said. I lie band will go out of
its way to "spread some love."
Just don't ask about the origin of their unique
moniker. "That's top secret information," Moseley
said. "I can't help you with that."
When they were just starting out, the String
Cheese Incident made a decision that would affect
the direction of their musical careers. They decided
to start their own record label, SC. I Fidelity Records.
The label affords them the kind of artistic freedom
that they might have had to compromise in order to
sign with a major record label. 'I'hey are able to
release whatever music they feel is best, including an
upcoming side project l>\ Michael Kang.
The most recent release from the band itself is enti
tled "Carnival '99." The album is a compilation of
their favorite moments from tlie winter and spring
tours of 1999. "It's a realh good example of what the
band does live," Moseley said. "Some improv jams,
some of our favorite tunes from early albums, and
stuff that we've never recorded before."
Moselev describes the album as a "snapshot in
time," capturing the musical development of the
ever-evolving group. It shows how the group has
matured since their early vears. In addition to stylis
tic modifications, with time the String Cheese Inci
dent is "becoming a tighter band," Moseley said.
"The goal of playing together is to learn to think like
a single organism and not five different people up
there."
When that happens onstage, it can be a phenom
enal experience. I he "rush of good energ\" that is
shared between the band and the audience can be

almost palpable at times.
Multi-show ruus, like the
Warfield, are especially con
ducive to these moments
because they allow the hand to
"reallv get the leel of the place
and get it ;ill dialed in," Mose
lev said.

When the String Cheese Incident comes to town
in March, Moselev's ultimate advice to music lims is

simple. "Come with an open mind and dancing feet
and you'll have a great time," he said.
