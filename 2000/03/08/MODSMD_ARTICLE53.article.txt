# A
						'Steely' look at long-departed fame

### ENO SARRIS STAFF WRITER 
So Steely Dan's lost a step
with their newest, "l\vo
Against Nature." That leaves
them only a few steps in front
of the rest.
Donald Fagen and Richard
Becker haven't released a
Steely album of all new mate
ria) since '79, but didn't really
miss a beat over those twenty
years. They mellowed a bit,
not surprisingly, but didn't
alter that jazzy sound that
made them popular with,
gasp, our parents.
All joking aside, they have
lost something, although what
exactly is hard to put a finger
on. The upbeat jazz licks are
still there, the horns still come
in right, the words are still "on
point," as some like to say. My
feet still need to tap, my head
still bobs, but something isn't
there that used to be.
Maybe it's endurance. "Two
Against Nature" is a mere
nine songs. That can't be it,
though, because I'd rather
have nine good songs than
fifteen mediocre ones.

Maybe it's their voices.
They've It-It the time there a bit. High notes
strain their older vocal chords a bit, a la Crosby,
Stills, and Nash. But 1 don't really care — you
might, but I don't. So there.
They actually gain some from age. "What a
Shame About Me" is a startling and honest look
at the aging r<x:k star, done insightfully by the
duo. T he words are poignant and depressed —
"I'm worrying about the future now/ Or maybe
this is it/ It's not all that I thought it would be/

What a shame about me." Or
how about "somebody told
me in the early '80s/ You
were going to be the Next Big
Thing/ Well now that was just
a rumor/But I guess I'm
doing line."
Reminiscing gets a little
more fun for the two in

"Cousin Dupree," the seventh track on 1 1 it*
new album. About a "down-home family
romance," tin- song gets to the "ow-ow-ouch"
in having a crush. I lie duo retains a bit of
cynism, though, declaring "that your mind has
turned to applesauce/ The dreary architecture
of your soul.''
Fagen does most of the horn arranging, and
still does it incredibly. "Janie Runaway," the
fourth track on "Nature," is well done. Beautiful,
perhaps. The only warning I can give is that you

n n /
must like j;i// in some wa\
to like this music. Other
wise. you won't. You just
won't.
But il you do like j;i//,
check out "Two Against
Nature." Steely s still got
it.
