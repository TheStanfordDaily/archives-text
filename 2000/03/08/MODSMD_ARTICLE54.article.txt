## Eclectic rap mix never quite gels 
### MICHAEL BAER STAFF WRITER 
"Grammy Rap Nominees
2000?" An awfully strange
concept for an album, con
sidering that the Grammy
Awards seem hopelessly
stuck in the early 70s, as
witnessed by their better
late-than-never recogni
tion of Santana, as well its
by year 2000 winning
cover songs like "Iron
Man," "WhiskeN in the
|ar," and "American
Woman." numbers which
came out years before the
first rap single.
I lowever, here it is, and
looking at the suiprisingh
licit\ liner notes (with lull
credits and album art from
those included), it seems to
have pretty much assem
bled itself: Songs from tlie*
albums and singles nomi
nated, except for the hand
ful which couldn't be
licensed from their record
company.

Because of this and because tlie Acadeim only gives
out three rap awards, we are presented with only 10
songs clocking in ;ii K) minutes. Kvcn at that, lout
rap pers appear twice, making this C I) a rather limit
ed view of rap circa 1999. Also, sequenced l>\ award
t\pe, the (II) doesn't quite gel as ;in album, though
it's admittedly clillic ult to come up with a good wax to
mix songs In Kinincm, W ill Smith, I he Roots and
Busta Rhymes, vou will certainly have my admira
tion.
()I c ourse, how you leel about this (il) will depend

on what \ou think of the current
state ol rap. Is it all sit kl\ strings,
grating grunts, and mainstream
mush? ()i is the return of I )rc and
the recent success ol I he Roots .in
indicator that things are onh gel
ting better?
II you're of the latter opinion,

you'll think most of the songs are pretty good,
though lew if any are great. I he loveliest song is The
Roots' "You (lot Me," featuring Erykah Badu. I he
song was the winner of the duo/group award tor
which it was nominated, so mavbe there's hope for
(irainmv alter all. The other winner, the rap parodist
Eminem, also contributes a couple of tracks —
though whether you enjoy them will depend on
whether the tracks' hyperviolence makes you laugh
or cringe.
In any <;isc\ you know what you're getting into with
this (.1): a representative sampler of mainstream rap

tracks (plus critical darlings The
Roots ;ind Missy Elliot), which
actually sounds ;i lot more varied
and fresh than what charts in
rock nowadays. If you're new to
tap and/or only want a taste of
what sells in the millions, this
should do the trick.
