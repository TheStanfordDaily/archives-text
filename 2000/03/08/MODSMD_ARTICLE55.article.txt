# Artsy Danish film's plot, direction never catches

When the first sex scene comes barely live min
utes into a movie, yon know that you're not see
ing your run-of-the-mill Hollywood film. Artistic,
foreign films have a way of keeping you on your
toes with edgy cinematography, overt metaphors,
and surprise twists. Director Soren Kragh-Jacob
sen's latest film, "Mifune," is no exception. 'With
quirky charm and deceptive promise. "Mifune"
quickly envelopes you in its offbeat plot.
Kresten, played by Anders \V. Berthelesen, is a
man who's left behind his rural upbringing and
unpleasant, humble past to build himself into a
business success in Copenhagen, Denmark. Ihe
morning after he marries the boss's daughter, he
receives a surprise phone (all from home,
informing him that his father has just died. His
new wife is flabbergasted by the news, since
Kresten has told everyone that he has no living
relatives. With some quick, incomplete explana
tions, Kresten kisses his wife good-bye and
returns to the dilapidated farm that he used to
call home.
At his homecoming, Kresten

finds his dad laying dead 011 the
dining room table covered with
flowers, and his mentally handi
capped brother, Rud, hiding
underneath. As he takes care of
funeral plans for his father,
Kresten also has to entertain

Rud, which he does by pretending to be a samu
rai named Toshiro Mifune, Rud's favorite game
from childhood.
Desperate to find someone who can take care of
the childlike Rudy so Kresten can return to his
business and his wife, Kresten advertises fora
housekeeper. In walks Liva, played by Iben Hje
jlu, au attractive woman who works as a call girl to
kerp her punk brother Bjarke in private school.
This is where the movie begins to fall apart.
Not surprisingly, this movie turns into a love
story, but it is neither heartwarming nor believ
able. Ihe only character one can really like or
believe in is the simple-minded Rud, but at times
he is portrayed more as a prop than a genuine
person.
Outrageousness abounds in the latter half of the
movie, which leaves viewers eager for the movie
to end. There's a ridiculous scene where wife
Claire comes to check in on Kresten, and spazzes
out when she sees the beautiful Liva. Without
seeking an explanation for what's going on, she
storms out in a huff, demanding a divorce.
Another scene with Liva and her brother Bjarke
has them musing over their need for attention.

Liva comments, "Life is one
huge turd that you have to take
a bite of every day." Fortunately
for us, this ridiculous movie is
not life, and we can just flush it
away with the rest of life's disap
pointments.
