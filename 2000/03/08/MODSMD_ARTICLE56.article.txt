# Roberts warms a chilling legal drama
## 
### DENNIS TYLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sentimental, heart-warming,
hilarious, and clever, "Erin
Brockovich" is a keeper. In a
world where equality is often lost,
Erin Brockovich helped to
restore faith in the justice system,
which should be prosecuting the
guilty and protecting the inno
cent. Consequently, she man
aged to uplift an entire commu
nity in need while also helping
herself.
Julia Roberts stars as the two
time divorced single mother with
two children and no job, a char
acter based on a true story. Her
life is, indeed, in turmoil. To top
it off, she gets into a car accident
which is not her fault and finds
herself in an even worse predica
ment when her attorney fails to
win her a settlement.
Broke beyond belief, she forces
the attorney, Ed Masry (Albert
Finney), to hire her. While on
the job, she discovers suspicious
medical records placed in a real
estate files and decides to do
some investigating. She then
unveils a cover-up by the compa
ny Pacific Gas and Electric Com
pany (PG&E), which contaminat
ed water in the communities
around their plant, causing dev
astating illnesses to the residents.
She gains the trust of the resi
dents and convinces them that
PG&E must be punished for
their actions. In the process, she
accumulates GOO plaintiffs against
the company.
The strength of the film is the
detail and attention it pays to the
lead character's story. The direc
tor, Steven Soderbergh, took the
time to formulate a realistic por
trayal of his protagonist. Erin was
not some crusading "superwom
an" who single-handedly waged
a war against one of the United
States' biggest corporations and
came out on top. No. She was a

human being with such a selfless
spirit that it just seemed that way.
There were many obstacles she
had to overcome while fighting
this case. In fact, because of her
dedication to work, she often
neglected her children, whom
she left at home with her
"assumed" boyfriend George
(Aaron Eckert) whose friendship
and support allowed her to pur
sue the case further. Additional
ly, many argued that she should
give up on the case and she was
often pitied because of her lack of
knowledge about the legal sys
tem.
But even with all of this, she
remained persistent and ended
up winning the largest settle
ment ever paid to a direct-action
lawsuit in the United States histo
ry — $333 million.
The film's flaw — if there must
be one — was its development of
the relationship, or lack thereof,
between George and Erin. Were
they merely friends or were they
lovers? Even in the end, I was not
sure if there was any emotional
attachment between the two of
them or if George had just
become a surrogate baby sitter
who took care of Erin's two kids.
But given the movie's recreation
of such a powerful and impor
tant issue, incorporating a love
story may have proved too diffi
cult.
All in all, the film was pure
excellence, full of so many tender
moments that one might have to
force a smile to fight the tears. (I
know I did.)
