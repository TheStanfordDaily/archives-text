# 'Mona' a black comedy hit
## 
### FREDERICK VALLAEYS STAFF WRITER 
Recently there have been quite a
few movies about dysfunctional fam
ilies, but "Drowning Mona," direct
ed by Nick Gomez, ups the ante and
brings us a film about an entire town
that is dysfunctional. The fact that
nearly everyone in Verplanck drives
a Yugo, the world's worst car ever
built, says something about the resi
dents' values, or their lack thereof.
The average Verplanck resident's
IQ appears to be south of 80, the
clergy get into drunken bar brawls,
and nobody even flinches when
Mona Dearly (played by Bette
Midler) dies when her Yugo drives
of a cliff into the Hudson river.
It's not that nobody knew her, it's
that they all hated her. The under
taker ("SNL's" Will Pen cil) says he's
seen people more upset about losing
money in a candy machine than
about Mona's untimely death. The
only person in town who cares
enough to suspect foul play is Police
Chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito).
His prime suspect is the scrawny,

innocent-looking Bobby Calzone
(Casey Aflleck), who runs a land
scaping business with Mona's ever
inebriated, good-for-nothing son
Jeff (Marcus Thomas). Alter having
been threatened, belittled and
attacked by Mona on more than one
occasion, he definitely has the
motive to want her dead. Unfortu
nately for Rash, his daughter Ellen
(Neve Campbell) is about to be mar
ried to bobby, and she's just found
out that she's pregnant with Bobby's
child. As a result, Rash may be
forced to put his son-in-law behind
bars unless he can find a more like
ly suspect.
In a town where Rona (Jamie Lee
Curtis) the diner waitress gets a fre
quent-visitor discount at the seedy
motel, Rash easily rounds up a few
more suspects, including Mona's
husband Phil (William Fichtner)
who is one of the many who thinks
he's in love with Rona. Fven Rash's
right-hand man, Feegee, who once
pulled over the Dearlys fora I)U1
only to get beaten by Mona, looks
elated enough at her death to be a
suspect.

While Mona's family
may sound like trailer
trash, it would be
unfair to that demo
graphic to compare
them to the Dearlys.
Their extreme igno
rance of their poverty
and stupidity makes
them hilarious. Mona
even goes berserk after
losing the town's annu
al knife-throwing con
test because winning it
would have been her
greatest accomplish
ment in life.
The wild story is car
tied forward by numer
ous flashbacks, all
involving incidents
with Mona. This tech-

nique was especially engaging when
the same incident was told from the
perspective of several participants,
with one of them usually twisting
reality a bit to make themselves look
more favorable. There are plenty of
good laughs in the story, which was
written bv Peter Steinfeld, and at

just over 90 minutes, it avoids drag
ging out a good thing for too long.
While this film is not a first-rate
murder mystery, it is a good, amus
ing whodunit with a great cast that
succeeds in creating the characters
necessary to make this film work.
