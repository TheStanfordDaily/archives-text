## 'Deterrence' is just dumb 
### JAD FAKHRY 
Deterrence, written and directed by Rod Luiie, is a rather
boring, flimsy movie about making monumental decisions
and their consequences. Kevin Pollack plays incumbent U.S.
President Walter Emerson, who is holed up in a small restau
rant in a Colorado mountain town during a debilitating
snowstorm. Set in 2008, Iraqi dictator Uday Hussain is invad
ing Kuwait while China is threatening its Asian neighbors.
Ihe problem is that the U.S. military is spread too thinly
and Iraq has biological and chemical weapons that it is threat
ening to use against U.S. allies. I hreatened with Iraq's bio
logical and chemical retaliation, Emerson must make a deci
sion.
Pollack is much better in his roles as a supporting actor
(Avalon, Casino, Usual Suspects). As the leading role, his
restraint as an actor just doesn't work here. I Ie comes across
as weak and rash when he tries to come across as strong and
decisive, limothy Hutton plays Marshall Thompson and
Sheryl Lee Ralph plays Gayle Redford, both members of
Emerson's cabinet. These supporting roles help to highlight
the questionable morality of President Emerson in that both
Marshall and Gayle offer alternative solutions to the crisis that
make much more sense than Emerson's.
So, faced with this debacle, Emerson must confer with his
advisors and make a national security decision. In an irra
tional flurry, President Emerson goes on national television
and decides to threaten Iraq with nuclear warfare if it does
not surrender in 24 hours. By deciding to threaten Iraq's
innocent civilians to scare China, the movie brings up a very
controversial point. Iraq, like many Arab nations, is used as a
convenient, faceless enemy by the U.S. and its allies.
To thicken the plot, Emerson is a Jew. This makes his nucle
ar threat against an Arab nation rather questionable. I lis mil
itary advisers denounce his decision and many question his
motives. Emerson claims to be completely neutral, but soon
his neutrality comes into question when Iraq threatens retal
iation with its own nuclear weapons. Iraq counters Emerson's
nuclear threat by announcing it has had nuclear weapons
and will strike at New York, Washington D.C., and other US
targets with nuclear missiles.
As Emerson's threat nears fruition, the world is in shock and
fear. Everyone in the world wants to avert the imminent glob
al nuclear disaster, but President Emerson stands by his
threat and decimates Iraq and its innocent civilians with a
massive nuclear bomb. What makes this disturbing is that
Iraq launches its nuclear weapons and they turn out to be
duds. W hat makes this even more disturbing is that Emerson
explains he that knew this — since he secretly sold Iraq the
fake nukes a few years earlier. This point shocks the world
and Emerson decides to resign.
Emerson concludes the movie saying that this "deterrence"
strategy is this price we must pay for peace, yet this makes no
sense sine Iraq had no capacity to execute its threat. Conven
tional warfare, as his advisors explain, could have ended the
problem.
What redeems this movie somewhat is that it truly makes
you think afterwards. It brings up the interesting notion that
killing millions of nameless, faceless Arabs is fine with Ameri
cans. Is massive genocide the price the world must pay to

deter other countries —
namely China — lrom
taking offensive action?
These questions are the
best part of this movie, as
the acting, storyline, and
cinematography are bor
ing and unimaginative.
