## A 						Coffee House homecoming 
### STEVEN RAPHAEL SENIOR MUSIC CRITIC 
When singer / songwriter dreg fhomas
plays at the Stanford Coffee Mouse on
March 1 I, it won't be his lirst time — just
the first time lie's not sitting behind a druin
set. I he 1992 Stanford graduate is a veter
an on-campus drummer.
"1 played in tons of groups," he tells me
over a cup of herbal tea. "I studied classical
percussion the whole time I was [at Stan
ford] and played in the symphony and s\ 111-
phonic band. I also played with Ram's I lead
quite a bit, and senior year, I was one of the
musical directors for (laities."
But his musical experiences at Stanford
weren't limited to the classical world. "Any
given weekend I was plaving at fraternity
parties to completely - drunken peo le
velling to play AC / DC," he explains.
We're sitting in a coffee house a few blocks
walk from Thomas's San Franc isco apart
ment. As we walk over, he reminisces about
his years at Stanford. Nearly 10 years ago,
he took the same classes that I take now,
and we laugh while comparing notes about
professors.
As the hot tea warms us on this brisk day,
he tells me about his life* since then. After
graduation, he considered becoming a full
time musician, but quic kl\ found that, limit
ed by club hours and landlords who
frowned on morning rehearsals, there was
nothing he could do between the hours ol
eight and noon. "And it occurred to me that
there is no reason not to also do some other
things that I love," he says.
Of course, this was easier said than done,
and lie* wound up in a series of corporate
jobs that made him miserable. The strict
hours intruded on his music, and the work
left him unfulfilled. "So, I asked myself," lie
explains, "what would I do if I were filthy
rich?"

Mis two passions, music and school,
sprung to mind. "And I figured, what the
hell? I'll act like I am tilth) rich." He paus
es before ironically adding, "And a couple
of credit cards later, here I am."
lie's found both the hours and the work
as a history I'h.l). student at I C-Berkeley to
be much more to his liking, fhe flexibility
has allowed him to plav shows "all the time,"
and to record and release his first solo
album, entitled "Remembrances of W hat's
I In face. Although "what's her lace' is not
am one in particular, Thomas chose the title
because "tnv songs all tend to be about the
same topic: relationships, and love long
gone, or love that's not going quite tight."
I Ie released the album himself, on his self
created label Sclunarglepop Records. One
reason win he c hose the title Sc lunarglepop
is "because somebody had already taken
Cireglhomas.com." lie sits nrjn^ckanger
fora moment. "Bastard! I don t Know wTio
he is, but I think I know his name," he
quips.
Although he still plays drums in"a bunch
of bands," songwriting has been his primary
locus for the last five or six years. 1 homas
has been writing songs with the guitar since
he was a child. As opposed to his years of
percussion training, his guitar playing is
mostly instinctual. Aside from a chord book
and learning the blues from his lather,
"everything else is learning Van Halen riffs,
Led Zeppelin riffs, or whatever I can do,"
he says.
Alter a phase where he only played ja//,
Thomas discovered alternative female
vocalists, lie credits women like Liz Pliair
and |uliana Hatfield with inspiring him to
return to pop music and songwriting.
"They've tapped into .1 reall) creative
place," lie- explains. "It reminded me of
when 1 first started playing music and the
energy I had.'
fhomas describes his homegrown sound

In comparing it to groups like the Counting
( '.rows, Matchbox 20, the Gin Blossoms, or
the Wallflowers. But lie's quick to mention
that the similarity comes only because he's a
m,ile vocalist. His true influences are the
alternative female singers.
Still, he tries to make his music more
mainstream than theirs. "You can be alter
native all day,"he says. "But the thing is,
you're never going to reach the amount of
people that other people are going to
reach." He's put special effort into making
sure his music is accessible to most people
— except for the current MTV audience,
that is.
"I've realized that I'm much too old to
relate to that kind of demographic," the 29-
year-old hail-jokingly says. He chuckles as
he remembers the last time he turned on
MTV and saw people like Christina Aguil
era awd-rjitney Spears performing. "I just
c an't relate to that kind of thing."
Returning to the Stanford Coffee House
isn't just another gig for Thomas. After all
of his good experiences playing there, he
takes any excuse he can to come back.
"Other than the fact that you'll be playing a
ballad and you'll hear the cappuccino
machine go on, I just love the environ
ment," he says. "To me, it's just comfort
able, warm, and cozy, so I like to be there
and to invite people to hear me there."
I Ie jokingly asks the "guy in the back who
always requests 'Free Bird' " to hold his
request fora while. "Someday," says
Thomas, "when I really get my act together,
I'm going to start off every show with 'Free
Bird.' just to get that over with." But despite
some bad experiences with "big drunken
guvs" demanding to hear country music,
Thomas thrives on audience interaction.
"When I'm playing ;i gig and there are 20
people in the audience that are yelling, it's
such a boost," he says."It makes all the
work worth it."

jobs that made him miserable. The strict
hours intruded on his music, and the work
left him unfulfilled. "So, I asked myself," lie
explains, "what would I do if I were filthy
rich?"

Mis two passions, music and school,
sprung to mind. "And I figured, what the
hell? I'll act like I am tilth) rich." He paus
es before ironically adding, "And a couple
of credit cards later, here I am."
lie's found both the hours and the work
as a history I'h.l). student at I C-Berkeley to
be much more to his liking, fhe flexibility
has allowed him to plav shows "all the time,"
and to record and release his first solo
album, entitled "Remembrances of W hat's
I In face. Although "what's her lace' is not
am one in particular, Thomas chose the title
because "tnv songs all tend to be about the
same topic: relationships, and love long
gone, or love that's not going quite tight."
I Ie released the album himself, on his self
created label Sclunarglepop Records. One
reason win he c hose the title Sc lunarglepop
is "because somebody had already taken
Cireglhomas.com." lie sits nrjn^ckanger
fora moment. "Bastard! I don t Know wTio
he is, but I think I know his name," he
quips.
Although he still plays drums in"a bunch
of bands," songwriting has been his primary
locus for the last five or six years. 1 homas
has been writing songs with the guitar since
he was a child. As opposed to his years of
percussion training, his guitar playing is
mostly instinctual. Aside from a chord book
and learning the blues from his lather,
"everything else is learning Van Halen riffs,
Led Zeppelin riffs, or whatever I can do,"
he says.
Alter a phase where he only played ja//,
Thomas discovered alternative female
vocalists, lie credits women like Liz Pliair
and |uliana Hatfield with inspiring him to
return to pop music and songwriting.
"They've tapped into .1 reall) creative
place," lie- explains. "It reminded me of
when 1 first started playing music and the
energy I had.'
fhomas describes his homegrown sound

In comparing it to groups like the Counting
( '.rows, Matchbox 20, the Gin Blossoms, or
the Wallflowers. But lie's quick to mention
that the similarity comes only because he's a
m,ile vocalist. His true influences are the
alternative female singers.
Still, he tries to make his music more
mainstream than theirs. "You can be alter
native all day,"he says. "But the thing is,
you're never going to reach the amount of
people that other people are going to
reach." He's put special effort into making
sure his music is accessible to most people
— except for the current MTV audience,
that is.
"I've realized that I'm much too old to
relate to that kind of demographic," the 29-
year-old hail-jokingly says. He chuckles as
he remembers the last time he turned on
MTV and saw people like Christina Aguil
era awd-rjitney Spears performing. "I just
c an't relate to that kind of thing."
Returning to the Stanford Coffee House
isn't just another gig for Thomas. After all
of his good experiences playing there, he
takes any excuse he can to come back.
"Other than the fact that you'll be playing a
ballad and you'll hear the cappuccino
machine go on, I just love the environ
ment," he says. "To me, it's just comfort
able, warm, and cozy, so I like to be there
and to invite people to hear me there."
I Ie jokingly asks the "guy in the back who
always requests 'Free Bird' " to hold his
request fora while. "Someday," says
Thomas, "when I really get my act together,
I'm going to start off every show with 'Free
Bird.' just to get that over with." But despite
some bad experiences with "big drunken
guvs" demanding to hear country music,
Thomas thrives on audience interaction.
"When I'm playing ;i gig and there are 20
people in the audience that are yelling, it's
such a boost," he says."It makes all the
work worth it."
