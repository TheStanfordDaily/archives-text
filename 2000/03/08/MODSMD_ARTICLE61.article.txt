### ROXY SASS 
Her mouth is wrapped
I around his penis; her tongue is
(in ling it like an elephant's
trunk around a tree during a
loi nado. I le's in ecstasy, her lips
are hurting. And everyone is
secretly mulling over the two
"S"-words. I hey're the same S
i words you were contemplating
when your parents bought a
new hrand ol baby food: spit or
swallow?
(ientlemen, think back to the
last time you were caught in an
undertow at the beach. You went
| under, you couldn't tell which
end was up, and you came up
gagging seawater and gasping for
aii. Now imagine how your girl
hiend leels when you've got her
by the hair, won't let her up for
air, and then you proceed to
spew the contents of your testicles

into her mouth. Honey, Miss Sass knows it's
heaven for you, but take a look at her next
' time, especial!) as she tries to dec ide what to
do with your "flower of the blood," as
Pythagoras termed semen. Miss Sass wonders
it Pythagoras was also a big fan of menage a
trois.
(lertaini) Miss Sass isn't recommending you
abstain from the joys of fellatio — heavens no!
However, the ladies might appreciate having
more options than spitting or swallowing. Miss
Sass hates to admit it. but sometimes the con
tents of youi light saber taste more like a c ryp
tic message from the Dark Side, yet rejecting
such a precious gift — the ancient Greeks
Ix'lieved an ounce of semen was worth 40
pounds ol blood — seems a bit impolite. What
to do?
Ladies, next time you decide you're in the
mood to kiss your way clown, forget every
thing you've heard about S&S — the real
choice is whethei to dodge or gulp. Miss
Sass wants to give you a play-by-play of
eac fi.
Dodging
ikes, semen?" you say. For the more
scjueamish among you, the key to dodgehall is
to determine the exact moment when lie's
alxnit to come. You see, sugar, it
bis fun il you stop too soon.
Your fiist goal, of course, is to prolong the
experience lor him. When he starts to hyper
ventilate or you begin to feel like your braces
are stuck to a bronco, that's your signal to
back oil a little. Use your mouth on his testi
(les. lick him gently until he relaxes, and then
you can stall up again. Eventually, he'll acci
dentalh pass the threshold of holding back —
that's when vou'll really have to move cjuick
l\. Now, Miss Sass knows you're reading this

iii the heat of the moment and it's hard to
concentrate, hut try to keep him right there
and we'll talk a little hit about the male ejacu
lation.
Ejaculation, the most obvious manifestation
of the male orgasm, has two distinct phases.
During the first, called "seminal emission,"
the smooth muscles of the prostate, seminal
vesicles and vas deferens contract, pouring
their contents into the dilated urethral hull).
At this point, your man knows lie's dose to
coming. In the second phase, tailed the
"expulsion phase," the semen is expelled l>\
the vigorous contractions of the muscles sur
rounding the root of the penis, other mus
cles of the pelvic region, and the genital
ducts.
Now, hack to you, dear, naked iu the bed
room. ()nce the first phase of orgasm has been
reached, you might as well go fbi it because
there's no turning back.
You can actually prolong the seminal emis
sion by placing your thumb lii inl\ against bis
prostate gland, between bis testicles and bis
anus. This pressure briefly traps the ejaculato
ry fluid mid-course, making bis orgasm seem
to last longer. However, while it may seem like
au cternit) longer to him, it's actualh onh a
few seconds, so you need to be prepared to
yank your mouth loose the moment he starts
to orgasm. Fortunately, the extended length
of orgasm will increase his pleasure so much
that he probably won't even notice that you
didn't swallow until he lookstlown ;ii bis si<>ni
ach.
If your thumb is in the right place, you'll
know the exact moment when lie's going to
start thrashing because you'll I eel bis prostate
pulsing. It's time for you to make your move.
You may taste a few drops of semen, but don't
gel distracted: remove your lace from firing
range, release vour thumb, wrap vour hand

around his penis and squeeze.
However, give him enough
space that he can thrust into
your hand — his skin will prob
ably still l>e wet enough that it
will lx- almost as pleasurable as a
blowjob. Circle the base of his
penis with the thumb and fore
finger of your other hand and
squeeze tightly to enhance his
orgasm. YVith practice, this pro
cess will become more of a
simultaneous motion. Aim his
penis toward his stomach — if
you're lucky you'll even manage
to keep clean sheets, a feat
almost impossible with the hor
rified spitting method. He'll
have a phenomenal orgasm,
and no one will feel nearly so
concerned about kissing after
ward.

Gulping
Miss Sass approves of your daring, and your
lover will likely lliank you for fulfilling one of
his sexual fantasies. As one man quoted in
"'f'lie Fundamentals of Human Sexuality"
admitted, "doming in a woman's mouth and
having her swallow it is something special."
While it's a nice treat for him, it's not always
a nice treat for her. especially if it doesn't all fit
in her mouth. The process of attempting to
swallow usuall) ends in a big mess. While Miss
Sass understands that messes are an important
part ol sandboxes as well as sex, there is a
cleaner way to swallow.
Miss Sass prefers to call it gulping. Similar to
a deep-throat blow job, you allow his penis into
the lilt recesses of your throat so that when he
orgasms, the semen slides right down your
esophagus without much trouble on your pait.
I lowever, it's not easy to allow his penis so far
back, especially when he's squirming and
thrusting — it's likely to elicit a gag reflex.
Solution? Don't send liiin spelunking so far
back into tlit- cave until lie's on the verge of
orgasm, then try to hold him dowp while you
relax your throat. Practice will also help to sup
press the reflex.
Ladies, whether you choose to dodge or
gulp, vour sucking expertise should light a
new admiration in his eyes. Once he's
(aimed down a bit, it's probably not too
much to send him into the valley and sug
gest tli.it he stop and smell the flowers
there.
Remember that oral sex is not a safe sex
practice il there is a likelihood that one partner
could be carrying AIDS or another S I I). But
once evervone has been tested, Miss Sass urges
you to have some tactile fun as soon as possi
ble. Alter all, you'll forget these details if you
d<ni l practice them soon.

and we'll talk a little hit about the male ejacu
lation.
Ejaculation, the most obvious manifestation
of the male orgasm, has two distinct phases.
During the first, called "seminal emission,"
the smooth muscles of the prostate, seminal
vesicles and vas deferens contract, pouring
their contents into the dilated urethral hull).
At this point, your man knows lie's dose to
coming. In the second phase, tailed the
"expulsion phase," the semen is expelled l>\
the vigorous contractions of the muscles sur
rounding the root of the penis, other mus
cles of the pelvic region, and the genital
ducts.
Now, hack to you, dear, naked iu the bed
room. ()nce the first phase of orgasm has been
reached, you might as well go fbi it because
there's no turning back.
You can actually prolong the seminal emis
sion by placing your thumb lii inl\ against bis
prostate gland, between bis testicles and bis
anus. This pressure briefly traps the ejaculato
ry fluid mid-course, making bis orgasm seem
to last longer. However, while it may seem like
au cternit) longer to him, it's actualh onh a
few seconds, so you need to be prepared to
yank your mouth loose the moment he starts
to orgasm. Fortunately, the extended length
of orgasm will increase his pleasure so much
that he probably won't even notice that you
didn't swallow until he lookstlown ;ii bis si<>ni
ach.
If your thumb is in the right place, you'll
know the exact moment when lie's going to
start thrashing because you'll I eel bis prostate
pulsing. It's time for you to make your move.
You may taste a few drops of semen, but don't
gel distracted: remove your lace from firing
range, release vour thumb, wrap vour hand

around his penis and squeeze.
However, give him enough
space that he can thrust into
your hand — his skin will prob
ably still l>e wet enough that it
will lx- almost as pleasurable as a
blowjob. Circle the base of his
penis with the thumb and fore
finger of your other hand and
squeeze tightly to enhance his
orgasm. YVith practice, this pro
cess will become more of a
simultaneous motion. Aim his
penis toward his stomach — if
you're lucky you'll even manage
to keep clean sheets, a feat
almost impossible with the hor
rified spitting method. He'll
have a phenomenal orgasm,
and no one will feel nearly so
concerned about kissing after
ward.

Gulping
Miss Sass approves of your daring, and your
lover will likely lliank you for fulfilling one of
his sexual fantasies. As one man quoted in
"'f'lie Fundamentals of Human Sexuality"
admitted, "doming in a woman's mouth and
having her swallow it is something special."
While it's a nice treat for him, it's not always
a nice treat for her. especially if it doesn't all fit
in her mouth. The process of attempting to
swallow usuall) ends in a big mess. While Miss
Sass understands that messes are an important
part ol sandboxes as well as sex, there is a
cleaner way to swallow.
Miss Sass prefers to call it gulping. Similar to
a deep-throat blow job, you allow his penis into
the lilt recesses of your throat so that when he
orgasms, the semen slides right down your
esophagus without much trouble on your pait.
I lowever, it's not easy to allow his penis so far
back, especially when he's squirming and
thrusting — it's likely to elicit a gag reflex.
Solution? Don't send liiin spelunking so far
back into tlit- cave until lie's on the verge of
orgasm, then try to hold him dowp while you
relax your throat. Practice will also help to sup
press the reflex.
Ladies, whether you choose to dodge or
gulp, vour sucking expertise should light a
new admiration in his eyes. Once he's
(aimed down a bit, it's probably not too
much to send him into the valley and sug
gest tli.it he stop and smell the flowers
there.
Remember that oral sex is not a safe sex
practice il there is a likelihood that one partner
could be carrying AIDS or another S I I). But
once evervone has been tested, Miss Sass urges
you to have some tactile fun as soon as possi
ble. Alter all, you'll forget these details if you
d<ni l practice them soon.

Her mouth is wrapped
I around his penis; her tongue is
(in ling it like an elephant's
trunk around a tree during a
loi nado. I le's in ecstasy, her lips
are hurting. And everyone is
secretly mulling over the two
"S"-words. I hey're the same S
i words you were contemplating
when your parents bought a
new hrand ol baby food: spit or
swallow?
(ientlemen, think back to the
last time you were caught in an
undertow at the beach. You went
| under, you couldn't tell which
end was up, and you came up
gagging seawater and gasping for
aii. Now imagine how your girl
hiend leels when you've got her
by the hair, won't let her up for
air, and then you proceed to
spew the contents of your testicles

into her mouth. Honey, Miss Sass knows it's
heaven for you, but take a look at her next
' time, especial!) as she tries to dec ide what to
do with your "flower of the blood," as
Pythagoras termed semen. Miss Sass wonders
it Pythagoras was also a big fan of menage a
trois.
(lertaini) Miss Sass isn't recommending you
abstain from the joys of fellatio — heavens no!
However, the ladies might appreciate having
more options than spitting or swallowing. Miss
Sass hates to admit it. but sometimes the con
tents of youi light saber taste more like a c ryp
tic message from the Dark Side, yet rejecting
such a precious gift — the ancient Greeks
Ix'lieved an ounce of semen was worth 40
pounds ol blood — seems a bit impolite. What
to do?
Ladies, next time you decide you're in the
mood to kiss your way clown, forget every
thing you've heard about S&S — the real
choice is whethei to dodge or gulp. Miss
Sass wants to give you a play-by-play of
eac fi.
Dodging
ikes, semen?" you say. For the more
scjueamish among you, the key to dodgehall is
to determine the exact moment when lie's
alxnit to come. You see, sugar, it
bis fun il you stop too soon.
Your fiist goal, of course, is to prolong the
experience lor him. When he starts to hyper
ventilate or you begin to feel like your braces
are stuck to a bronco, that's your signal to
back oil a little. Use your mouth on his testi
(les. lick him gently until he relaxes, and then
you can stall up again. Eventually, he'll acci
dentalh pass the threshold of holding back —
that's when vou'll really have to move cjuick
