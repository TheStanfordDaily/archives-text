millions of sites fbi last
veai s awards ceremo
ny, as well as all the
sites th.it mention the
Academy Awards in
any way. In any way.
I he "oftiiial" sites
are a good place to ,
start, though.
www.oscar.org is the
"Official Site of the
Academy of Motion Pic
ture Arts and S< iences."
Oscar.ol g is a bit sparse,
though - other than a list

of nominations and movie
credits, the onl\ things the site
boasts are posters for the Oscars. OI
course, \ou might be into that sort
of thing.
www.oscar.com is the "Official
\cademv Awards Site," just to get
this whole .org/.com thing sorted
out. I he .coin of the two is naviga
ble, and includes some more inter
esting features. Kilter the sweep
stakes. sure; read bios of nominated
films. OK; but make sure you " lest
\oiii Oscai IQ. If you do well on

older than me, or just plain

information on all the nominated
stars. And some detailed discussion
of the ridiculous fashion that some
times makes its way on to the red

It all comes hack to discussing
critical opinion of the films, and
where better to scoff at the critics
than www.critics.com? For every
nominated movie, www.critics.com
includes a review from assorted
newspapers. Wow, so much babble,
and yet so well organized.
A site that combines different
approac lies is www.oscarwatch.
