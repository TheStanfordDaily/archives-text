# Soleil's roaring 'Dralion' shines
## 
### LAUREN RUSSELL EDITORIAL STAFF 
Cirque du Soleil is truly
the most amazing thing I
have ever seen. Not only
is it a visual and aural
feast of overwhelming
color and live music, but
it also holds perfor
mances of some of the
most unbelievable physi
cal feats in the world. All
under one tent.
Cirque du Soleil, which
was founded in Montreal
in 1984, has soared to the
top of the circus world
over the past decade.
With five permanent
shows and three touring
shows all over the world,
the Cirque has become
the most popular circus
in the world — if you can
call it that. The Cirque du
Soleil has no animal per
formances, no annoying
oom-pa-pa music, and no
obnoxious M.C. But let
me describe what it does
have.
Dralion, the Cirque's
touring show (coming to
San Jose in April) has a
theme inspired by the
Chinese year of the Drag
on. Ihe performance is
inspired by many nation
alities, actually, perhaps
due to the fact that the 54
performers hail from
eigh(different countries.
There are African, Indi
an, Italian and French
aspects of the show, all
added to the dominant
Chinese theme.
Performers in "Dralion"
tackle feats such as cata
pulting seven people onto
each other's shoulders,
juggling nine balls at
once, and acrobatics from
a ring at least 100 feet in
the air without a safety

net. There are dance
and singing perfor
mances as well that will
wow you, including a
dance that takes place
partially in mid-air.

If"yon have yet to see a
Cirque performance,
reading a description can
only do so much. Ihe
performance is a visual
feast that must be taken
in to understand. I he set
definitely speaks <>la lot
more than "circus." It will
inspire your imagination
— expect some weird
dreams after seeing it! It
will definitely make your
jaw drop. And it will
make you laugh. The
Cirque du Soleil lias the
coolest clowns ever. I hey
do a lot more than make
you laugh — they will sit
on your lap, play the cello
while balancing on it, and
fly around the big top.
The Cirque du Soleil is
not only the coolest but
also must be one of the
most expensive circus in
the world. Seats range
from $40 and $150. But
believe me, it is worth it.
Sell back your Chem 31
book (actually, you'd have
to sell back a few hundred
to be able to afford a tick
et). Donate a few gallons
of blood — or sperm. l)o
whatever you need to, but
don't let the Cirque du
Soleil leave San Jose
before you have seen it.
A warning — if I have
thoroughly convinced
you, buy your tickets
soon! Cirque du Soleil
sells out everywhere it
goes. The San Jose per
formances will sell out
quickly, so if you are
going to splurge, splurge
soon.
For the truly inspired,
you can run away with
the circus . . . they're
holding auditions in L.A.
this month.
