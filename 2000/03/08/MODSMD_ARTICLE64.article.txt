# Mardi Gras (a day late)

"Trusses les bon tt-nips rouler!": a perfect
description for N( )LVs, Palo Alto's only Cajun,
Creole, southern and Caribbean restaurant.
Modeled after the French Quarter in Now
()rleans, NOLA's is located on Ramona Ave. in
downtown Palo Alto. NOLA (short for New
Orleans, La.) is a perfect mix of a lively atmo
sphere, friendly staff, and wonderful f<>od.
Ever since its opening in 1996 by owner Craig
Sinclair, NOLA's has been quite a success. As a
friend of mine said, NOlA's indoor atrium
and balcony seating along with the colorful
lighting and shiny bead necklaces make you
feel like "breaking into Mardi Cras at any
time."
Given this magical atmosphere, it's no sur
prise NOLA's throws a huge Mardi Gras party
every year, where they show a good time to
more than 2.000 people. Yesterday, for the
Mardi Gras festivities, they cleared out their
entire atrium area and filled it with a zydeco
band, a huge waterfall, nine bartenders and a
large dancing area. But if you missed the fes
tivities yesterday, don't worry. Every June,
they throw a Midsummer Mardi Gras party
that is even bigger than the real thing.
N( )LA's houses a large collection of original
art, all from five artists in New Orleans. In the
future, NOLA's hopes to open its own art
gallery to hold some of this art work.
We started off our evening with NOLA's
original drink specials. I had NOLA's version
<>1 the famous New Orleans "Hurricane," a
blend of fruit juices and rum. Presented in a
long glass with a pineapple on top, drinking
the Hurricane made me feel like 1 was basking
on a sunny beach. We also tried the "Bug
Spray," a rather strong but delicious drink with
five different types of rum, fruit juice and a
hint
of vanilla. The "Saucy Slipper," a raspberry
drink with a twist of citrus was another favorite
drink. We also tried the "Mojito," a rather

strong drink with fresh lime juice, mint leaves
and Absolut vodka.
Next we tried NOlA's delicious appetizers.
I he "Crispy Calamari and Onion Rings" sea
soned with Creole spices was by far our
Favorite. Ihe calamari melted in our mouths
and the jalepeno chipotle aioli sauce compli
mented the dish well. We also recommend the
"Authentic Seafood dumbo" and "Hector's
Da' Steak Quesadillas" with skirt steak, jack and
cheddar cheese, guacamole and salsa fresca.
After the filling appetizers, we were reluc
tant to order our main dishes. But how could
1 resist New Orleans's original jambalaya, a
mix of seafood, chicken, sausage, voodoo rice
and seven different Cajun spices? "Yo Mama's
Favorite Teriyaki Skirt Steak," a tender piece
of steak wrapped around NOLA's famous
mashed potatoes, topped with slender onion
rings, was also excellent. The"( Creole Mustard
Rubbed Salmon," a piece of Creole-seasoned
salmon on top of creamy basil mashed pota
toes, was delicious.
Despite our lull stomachs, we couldn't leave
NOLA's without sampling their wonderful
(lessens. F.ven though we enjoyed the "Rasp
berry-Chocolate Cheesecake" on the special
menu, our Favorite dessert by fin was the
"Pumpkin Pec an Pie" topped with vanilla bean
icecream and caramel sauce. I'll is was the per
fect ending to a delicious meal.
II you ever have a little money to spend and
want to have a good time while enjoying great
lood, I highly recommend NOLA's. It's a spe
cial place in Palo Alto that relocates you into
the Mardi (Iras atmosphere, any day of the
year.
