## Specialist in colonial theory discusses the role of narrative 
### ASTA SO 
In an age of superficial globalization, Pres
idential lecturer Homi Bhabha argued Mon
day evening that people should incorporate
the narratives of minority cultures into their
worldviews.
Bhabha, a humanities professor at the
University of Chicago who specializes in colo
nial and post-colonial theory, grew up in
Bombay, India and earned his doctorate in
English literature from Oxford University.
"My childhood was tilled with accounts of
India's struggle for independence, its com
plicated history of sub-continental cultures
formed in the embrace of imperial power
and domination," Bhabha said. "In a small
way, in a very small way, my own life was
formed on the crossroads that marked the
end of empire, the post-colonial drive to
wards new horizons lor the third world and
the free nations."
Bliaba, who describes narrative as the
"very soul of cultural creativity," discussed
the effect of India's cultural diversity and the
British colonial legacy on his own story.
"1 asked myself what it would be like to live
without the unresolved tension between cul
ture and country that has ljeconie the narra

tive of my lift- and the defining characteristic
of my work," said Bhabha.
While at Oxford, Bhabha realized the ex
tent to which minority regions and cultures
can he overlooked and their w< >rks forgotten.
"What one expects to find at the very cen
ter of life or literature may only Ix* the dream
of the deprived," Bhabha said. Although lie
did not want celebrate marginality, Bhabha
eniphasi/ed the obstacles emerging cultures
face in trying to make their voices heard.
"I do want to make graphic what it means
to survive, to produce, to labor, and create
within a world [where] major economic im
pulses and cultural investments are pointing
in a direction away from you, your country."
Bhabha urged individuals to suspend
their own beliefs and values while trying to
understand another culture, although lie ad
mitted that it was not completely possible to
do so.
He said the arts and humanities con
tributed to "cultural translation," which he
defined as "a process through which cultures
are required to revise their own systems of
reference, norms, and values."
The humanities are particularly impor
tant, Bhabha said, because they "propagate
and protect . . . the Right to Relate,' the au
thority to tell stories .. . that create the web of
social life and change the direction of [this]

world."
Narrative is part of freedom be
cause it is the right to be heard, tobe
recognized, Bhabha said.
Bhabha also discussed minoriti
zation, "a political
process that must transition and
translation work towards the global
democratic rule.

Bhabha warned against the dan
gers of a shallow commitment to
multiculturalism.
"It is too easy to celebrate a new
internationalism or
globalization by displaying foreign
cultures at a delicious distance
from ourselves," Bhabha said.
"Our own intimate, indigenous
landscapes must be rematched to
include those who are its new citi
zens or see themselves as emerging
cultural groups with the active right
to narrate."
