aid awarded to students with children, as well

job in order to provide for their children. Add
to that the exorbitant cost of i hildcare, and the
life of an undergraduate patent quickh be

We commend the University for recogni/ing
the hardships that undergraduate parents face.
Increasing the amount ol financial aid available to
these students will make a substantial, positive
contribution to their lives. Students will be able
spend fewer hours working at jobs and more time
enjoying the benefits of Universit\ life that other
students do, such as involvement in extrai urricu
lar activities. IVrhaps most importantly, iliev will
be able to spend more time with their children.
It is also important to consider that, without
improved financial aid pat kages, man\ ol these
undergraduate parents would not be able to at
tend Stanford. II the I niversitv is committed to
need-blind admission, these students should
not be denied the opportunitx to attend Stan

families. Just .is students from poorer families

struggles. I hese students have as much to offer
the Stanford community as am other group.
