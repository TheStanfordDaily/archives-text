# THE 						HARLEQUIN MANNEQUIN
## In search of the truth 
### 
Large lecture ( hisses sin k. Ihe
professoi doesn't know mv name
or mv late. What about the TAs?
lAs can't write tn\ graduate
school ret onitnendations. l-'ed up with lec
ture classes, I begin niv quest to enter the
innei sanctum of Stanfi»i <I undcrgi aduate
teaching — the seminai.
As a mere undergraduate acolvte, I
have to make extensive preparations be
fore gaining access to small-group semi
nars. I go through a purification proc ess,
known as "core requirements." You
know them. There's one for almost even

major: the Hum Bio
tore, the Bio core, the
Kcon T>o st-rics and the
IR sequence.
Although these pre
requisites teach virtual
ly nothing, they serve
the all-important pur
pose of cleansing the
body (all-nighters as
physical torture) and

the soul (exams as psvc hological torture),
(lore re(|uirements enable me to handle
"the truth" when it is finalh revealed in
uppei -division seminars.
Entry to the inner sanctum is competi
tive. Professors limit places to better lax ish
their attention on the hol\ few. 111 the Po
litical Science Department. I sign up fora
seminar two da\ s before c lasses start, loo
late — I .un already UOtli 011 the list. 1 show
upon the first da\ of class to plead and beg
and prav. 1 finally convince the professor
that tnv soul is 111 a suitable state. I am, fi
nally. able to behold the I lolv of I folies.
Imagine, then, 15 students arravecl
around a conference table, reach to dis
cuss and debate and exchange ideas. ()h,
how my intellectual horizons would be
stretched! 1 would finally understand,
learn and appreciate something. So what
do we talk about?
Absolute trash.
Fifteen undergraduates, each of whom
has absolutely no know ledge of the subject
except what came from two journal arti
cles, each declaiming, in turn. "1
think . . followed In a paraphrase of
someone else's ideas.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against
stating personal opinions. I'm not saving
other people don't have valuable, intelli
gent things to sav. But what sort of opin
ions are formed by a cursory clip at 2 a.m.
into a vast academic literature? Are these
the sort of opinions I waited, suffered core
requirements and paid $30,000 a year to
hear?
No.
Only the truth is important. I don't care

about what \ou think. I don't even care
about what 1 think. I care about what is.
Opinions, yours or mine, aren't impor
tant. I he truth is out there, somewhere,
.ind I want to find it.
Naturally, the fault is not with under
graduates. With the demands of beet. H.it
parties and Frisbee-throwing, who has
time to become well-versed in dr\ aca
demic writings? So whom do we blame,
and whom do we sue?
()ur professors.
I he fault is with professors who respect
pel sonal opinion too much. I his breed of
teacher refuses to understand that even
very smart people can sav very stupid
things sometimes, and that stupid things
must be squashed and ridiculed it the
ti nth is to come out. I his breed of protes
soi is "kind" and "nice." These guvs be
lieve that to disabuse a student of Insoi her
opinions is a no-no. It destroys self-es
teem. It makes fora poor image on the
ANSI course guide.
1 his breed of professor belongs to the
cult of the "1 think."
I he » ult of the "1 think" elevates free
dom of thought and expression above all
else. T.vcn truth. If 1 think niultination.il
corporations are the vcr\ incarnation of
evil, then it must be somehow true, "from
m\ perspective." 1 may as well think pink
elephants exist in the center of the Tartli;
it would be true, "from my perspective."
Professors in the cult of the "1 think"
nod sagely at wrong, stupid or ill-in
formed opinions, to be "charitable" to stu
dents. I hey may not affirm such opin
ions. but they don't bother with rebuttal
either. This is a symptom of a very deep
problem.
Respect for what students think has run
amok at Stanford.
The result? Endless strings of personal
opinions in our seminars, most of them
onlv very tenuously connected with reali
ty. Our seminars become a free-for-all,
w here everyone can state any view he or
she wishes. Truth is lost in the relativity of
personal opinion.
1 demand to be taught by professors,
not by undergraduates. I demand an
end to the cult of the" 1 think." I demand
the truth! Our professors must be willing
to make us feel small and stupid. Free
dom to think for undergraduates slips all
too easily into a tacit denial that truth ex
ists. If these are the winds of freedom that
blow through Stanford, they are an ill
wind indeed.
