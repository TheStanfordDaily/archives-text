Stanford Democrats should 'be cautious'
I am mystified In tlu 1 tone of the re
sponses to nn letter ("Student responds to
Denis' letter," March M\ letter was a
mild criticism, yet it was described as an
"appall[ing] . . . gross mischaracteri/a
tion" and an "attack on |( .laser's] personal
beliefs."
Glaser states that "Amendments guar
antee rights rather than limit govern
ment," but the claim that those are mutu
ally exclusive is untenable. Inherent to a
democracy is not only majority rule, but
the tempering of majority rule with respect
for individual rights, which the govern
ment is prohibited from infringing on.
ev en in the name of the popular will. The
Constitution and its amendments cover
many of those rights, but bv no means ex
haust the list. Main people would claim
that, even if the Constitution allows it, the
government ought not, for example, ban
homosexuality.
The debate over what are exclusively
private decisions and what are appropriate
areas tor government intervention is an
important and complicated one, perhaps
the most important in modern politics, and
Glaser was wrong to try to dismiss those
who disagree with her bv claiming that any
"limitation of government intervention is
detrimental to the human condition." No
one in either major political party suggests
today that people hold no rights free from
potential government interference, or that
the government has no place in improv ing

people's lives. Instead, the question is
when, where and how it is helpful tor the
government to intervene.
1 hope that Clascr and the Stanford
1 )eni(x i .its will he cautious w hen tliev push
for more government involvement, and
remember to balance the benefits it can
bring with the loss of freedom it can often
entail.

Student's attacks politically motivated
Cabriel l.a/arin managed to write one
of the most petty, whining, banal com
plaints I've ever seen on an editorial page
("ASSI members should be prepared to
hold themselves responsible,' " March (>).
I he poor thing didn't get enough pizza at
a basketball game — now he wants to in
dict .ill of the ASSL for allegedly falling
down on the job.
Few people criticize the ASSI as fre
quently as Ido —just ask my colleagues on
the Graduate Student Council — but
Lazarin's attack on Michael Osofsky was
nothing more than a cheap shot. I've had
my differences with Mike in the past —
publicly, even — but there's nobody on
this campus who works harder on student
issues than he does.
As one of the three Republicans on cam
pus, I'm tempted to comment on the wis
dom of the ASSU using any sort of Ro
manesque "bread and circuses" (or "pizza

.uul basketball games") approach to stu
dent self-governance. Instead, I'll just sug
gest that Li/arm step up to the plate and
gel involved rather than c arping from the
sidelines.
But then mavbe that's what this is all
about. It's getting close to election time, so
now we'll start seeing all the little Machi
avellian letters to the editor from ostensibly
independent students speaking for or
against various candidates. Don't insult
our intelligence — tell us which slate
you're from. And try to pick a better issue
to complain about next time.
