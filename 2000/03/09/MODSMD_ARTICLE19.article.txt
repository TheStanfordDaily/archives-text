# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## New language department will be larger, better funded 
### 
A single large department of litera
ture, culture and language lias
been proposed bv Malcolm
Beaslev, de an of Humanities and
Sciences, for approval In l*rovost |<>hn
Ltcheniendy. Hie new organization will
open up new majors and concentrations of
faculty and students in such disc iplines as
film studies, translation, languages and In -
erattires of the- Americas .incl trans-Atlantic
studies if the proposal is approved. I Itc tra
ditional majors will remain.
I he dean and provost have shown
their good faith In promising, in writing,
that the new department can bring in fi\câ– 
full professors in language and literature
over the next three vears. I he\ affirm

that the department can replace an\ of
the 14 junior professors who leave for am
reason, and it can be certain that its cur
rent number of filled facultv positions w ill
not diminish. New mone\ to develop
courses and seminars is in place. Some
univei sities nun have cut language facul
ties. but at Stanford the overwhelming
wish of the Dean lleasle\ and Provost
Ktc heinencU is to build them in strength
and c|ualit\ to benefit students. Alreadv.
new graduate fellowships have f)een in
creased to five vears and the stipend
raised b\ 12.S percent for next vear. Ex
citing new undergraduate courses have
been developed b\ groups of facultx
wot king together.

Right now, the six language depart
ments .it Stanford are in the Division of Lit
eratures, Languages and Cultures. l'he\
c ame together as .1 c luster in 1994 in order
to be more effective at managing money,
fellowships and curriculum. I his was a
purely administrative merger, except that
.in executive committee was created to re
view facultv appointments, give out certain
fellowships, foster innovation and make
the case for studving languages, literature
and cultures at Stanford. I he current lan
guage requirement became possible, along
with the Language ( .enter, because of the
work of this group.
A distinguished visiting committee
came to Stanford last vear to review these

departments and recommended reorga
nization. 1 Ins visiting committee w.ts part
of a vear-long process in which opinions
were solicited from students and facultv.
I Ins vear, the facult\ lias discussed reor
ganization for more than five months.
Quite .1 few faculty members have dis
cussed these ideas with students informal
ly during this time, and students have
been free to comment as thev wish. The\
often have commented in person and 111
writing about the candidates for senior
professorships who have come through
this year.
It goes without saying that the lan
guages with the largest enrollments in
vears one and two are the be st positioned

to offer com sis that w ill draw numbci s of
third-and fourth-veai students. Lliepro
posal now before the- provost will 1 reate a
strong department that can open evei
more and better courses in the needed
areas when students show thev want to
take tliein. Lver\ area of stuel\ will have
the opportunitx to show its need. Dean
Heaslex and Provost Ltc heinench arc
coming through right now with bold
plans and lots of nionev. We need to
move strongh to take them up 011 tlieii
invitation.
