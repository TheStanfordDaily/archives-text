Despite his 20 points, sophomore Casey Jacobsen was unable to lead the
Cardinal over Arizona in a thrilling contest at Maples Pavilion.
The second halt didn't get much
better; even with Jason Collins in
the game for most ot the halt. Ari
zona (22-7, 14-3) widened its ad
vantage on the boards to 36-27
overall and 11-6 on the offensive
glass, while scoring 15 second
chance points to the Cardinal's six.
"Thev just went after the ball a
little harder than we did," said
Collins, who grabbed nine re
bounds to go with his 20 points on
the night.
Compounding the team's re
bounding woes, the 3-point shots

weren't falling for the Cardinal
like they normally do. Stanford
went 0-for-7 in the second half on
the way to a 35 percent night from
behind the arc — not bad for most
teams, hut a number that just
won't cut it tor the (Cardinal.
Jacobsen missed all three of his
long-distance attempts in the sec
ond, including a wide-open look
with 16 seconds left that would
have put Stanford up by four. Of
course, anyone who has to chase
super-athletic guard Arenas
around the court all night just
might get a little worn down by
the end.
"He's one of the best in the con
ference at moving without the
ball," said Jacobsen, who was vic

timi/ed repeatedlv by Arenas's
quickness, as the Wildcat guard
went for 22 points. "He's very,
very good off the dribble. You
think you have him stopped, and
he just keeps dribbling and keeps
attacking until he gets to the rim."
Neither the Cardinal nor the
Wildcats were helped In officiat
ing that seemed more fit tot a high
school game than an important
Pac-10 contest, given the lack of
consistency in foul calls.
Players on both sides, their
coaches and the partisan Stanford
crowd groaned in frustration on
more than one occasion after a
light touch resulted in a 3-point
play, or a clean strip brought yet
another whistle.

Well-versed in the art of deal
ing with the- media, both Collins
and Jacohsen refused to bad
mouth the offii ials, even though it
was clear to .ill what thev were
thinking.
"On am given night, officials
will make calls, and, as a player,
you have to adjust," said Collins,
who couldn't resist adding that
picking up three fouls in four
minutes was very uncharacteristic
for him.
Stanford will take on Arizona
State tomorrow at Maples at 1
p.m. in the final game of the tegu

' ASHA SIDDHARTHA 'The Stanford Daily
Despite his 20 points, sophomore Casey Jacobsen was unable to lead the
Cardinal over Arizona in a thrilling contest at Maples Pavilion.
The second halt didn't get much
better; even with Jason Collins in
the game for most ot the halt. Ari
zona (22-7, 14-3) widened its ad
vantage on the boards to 36-27
overall and 11-6 on the offensive
glass, while scoring 15 second
chance points to the Cardinal's six.
"Thev just went after the ball a
little harder than we did," said
Collins, who grabbed nine re
bounds to go with his 20 points on
the night.
Compounding the team's re
bounding woes, the 3-point shots

weren't falling for the Cardinal
like they normally do. Stanford
went 0-for-7 in the second half on
the way to a 35 percent night from
behind the arc — not bad for most
teams, hut a number that just
won't cut it tor the (Cardinal.
Jacobsen missed all three of his
long-distance attempts in the sec
ond, including a wide-open look
with 16 seconds left that would
have put Stanford up by four. Of
course, anyone who has to chase
super-athletic guard Arenas
around the court all night just
might get a little worn down by
the end.
"He's one of the best in the con
ference at moving without the
ball," said Jacobsen, who was vic

timi/ed repeatedlv by Arenas's
quickness, as the Wildcat guard
went for 22 points. "He's very,
very good off the dribble. You
think you have him stopped, and
he just keeps dribbling and keeps
attacking until he gets to the rim."
Neither the Cardinal nor the
Wildcats were helped In officiat
ing that seemed more fit tot a high
school game than an important
Pac-10 contest, given the lack of
consistency in foul calls.
Players on both sides, their
coaches and the partisan Stanford
crowd groaned in frustration on
more than one occasion after a
light touch resulted in a 3-point
play, or a clean strip brought yet
another whistle.

Well-versed in the art of deal
ing with the- media, both Collins
and Jacohsen refused to bad
mouth the offii ials, even though it
was clear to .ill what thev were
thinking.
"On am given night, officials
will make calls, and, as a player,
you have to adjust," said Collins,
who couldn't resist adding that
picking up three fouls in four
minutes was very uncharacteristic
for him.
Stanford will take on Arizona
State tomorrow at Maples at 1
p.m. in the final game of the tegu
lar season. It is also the final game
for standout seniors Jarron
Collins, Ryan Mendez and
Michael McDonald.
