I Ik'\ call the pla\ "Ilonie run."
Sure, n isn't eas\. hut a long pass
down the toiirt, .1 hotnh from the
outside . . . and Stanford would go
home victorious, just like the\ have
-7 times alreach this season.
Except it didn't happen like
ili.it last 11 i<4lll.
Aftci Michael Wright hacked
his wa\ in lot what became the
winning lauip with three seconds
left. |arron Collins' length-of-the
i ourt pass was caught l)\ Arizona's
Cilbert Arenas as time expired,
and the No. S Wildcats ran olfthe
Maples l'av ilion court with a 70-75
win, their second in as mam \ears
ovei a No. 1-ranked Stanford
team at Maples.
Stanlord lans will argue that the
game didn't realh mean that much.
I he No. I seed 111 the West is prob
al)l\ still a given, and the Pacific 10
( onlerctue title was technicalh al
reach c line hed, but don't tr\ to tell
the plavers an\ ol that.
1 he look in both |ason Collins
and ( ase\ jacobsen's exes would
tell vou ih.it much, after lighting
through an up-and-down game
that saw eight lead changes in the
sec ond half alone.
" I his has to motivate us," said

the sophomore |acobscn, who fin
ished with 'JO points. "Ibis
shouldn't happen, but it's not
going to stoj) us from doing what
we want to do."
I he ( animal's loss could be di
rectl\ traced to 11 it- lack ol depth in
the post that has suddenh sur
faced in the last several games — a
cause lor some concern heading
into the NCAA fournament.
With redshirt freshman (iisiiu
Davis's ankle keeping him side
lined and sophomore Curtis 801-
cliardt out for the war. Mike
Montgomen's lone option on the
bench is undersi/ed freshman
1 e\<> |olmson, who is ven athletic
but can't be asked to defend 7-
loot-l centers like Arizona's Eorcn
Woods even night.
I nfortunately for Mont
gomery when Jason Collins
picked up bis third toul with 15:27
left 111 tlie first half, that scenario
became all too real — and it
showed in the box score.
With Collins held out fbi the
halt. Stanford (27-2, 15-2 Pac-10)
could 011b manage a single offen
sive rebound as the Wildcats
pulled in nine thanks to the inside
work of Wright, Woods and for
ward Richard Jefferson.

Despite his 20 points, sophomore Casey Jacobsen was unable to lead the
Cardinal over Arizona in a thrilling contest at Maples Pavilion.
