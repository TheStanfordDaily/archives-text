# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Student input needed in dept. consolidation decision 
### 
During f.ill quarter, the Sc 11«»«»1 ot
Humanities and Sciences pro
posed merging the Departments
of Spanish and Portuguese,
Asian I .anguages and 1 literatures, (icrman
Studies. French and Italian, Comparative
Literature and Slavic Languages and lit
eratures. These departments would be
considered "areas under the umbrella of
a single department dedicated to the stud\
of literature, cultures and languages.
1 hesc six "areas" would sat rifice theii cm -
rent autonomy and be lot t ed to pool all re
sources with no institutional mechanisms
outlined to assure the continued excel
lence of eat li area.
Notwithstanding the commitment ol
I niversitN President |olm Henness\ to the
humanities, this proposal reflects a de
creasing financial and philosophical com
mitment to the humanities. In its place, ad
ministrative and financial t oik cms appeal
to have trumped intellectual priorities in
the I niversitv's derision making. We urge
the I nivcrsity to reconsider this proposal
foi the following reasons: The proposed
merger would ret luce the
qualitv of graduate and undergraduate
education at Stanford, as well as the
value of degrees ret eived from these de
partments. No institutions of a similar
caliber have implemented this model of

orgatii/ation for the stutl\ ot languages
and literature. 1 he academic downsiz
ing proposed In this merger would re
sult in a loss ot prestige to all the depart
ments affected. I his. in turn, would be
lelt bv students majoring and minoring
in the departments who tlet itlc to pui
sne graduate studies, and l>\ graduate
students as they enter the academic job
mat ket.
I lie only intellectual rationale the I Di
versity oilers lor this mergei is the lat ilita
tion ol "t i < ►ss-cutting woi k" across depart -
ments. Such calls for coinpar.itive work
at ross national language areas tail to rcc
ogni/e tlu existing interdist iplinai \ woi k
tout hit ted In taiult\ .mil slut lei its in .ill ot
our departments. Departments like the
Spanish and Portuguese alreath otter
courses and advise students in the De
partments of Comparative Literature,
Latin Ameiican Studies, Fuglish, Antliro
polt>g\, Modern I bought and Literature
and Comparative Slut lies in Rate Ftlinit -
it\. I lie I ni\t'i sH\ should sirengthen ex
isting interdist iplinat \ relationships and
foment new ones between departments
that alreath share intellectual agendas,
rather than entourage new ones based on
administrative expedient e.
l he move fails to provide a frame
work that ensures the tunneling ot re

sources to at c;» studies that tall outside of
the rubric ol the mainstream Furopean
t<>c i that will dominate the new division,
l'he possible permutations tor "cross
cutting work" would be limited to the six
departments, tour of which are pritnai i
-1\ dedicated to Furopean Studies. 1 bus,
the niergei would re-inscribe existing in
tellectual hierarchies within academia
that privilege canonical, Furopean
based literary studies.
Specific allv, the Departments ot Span
ish and Portuguese and Asian Languages
and Literatures face phenomenal oppor
tunities tor growth because of 1) tliet hang
ing demographic s c >t the I nited States, es
pcciallv (alifornia, where Latinos and
Vsian Americans are among the fastest
glowing populations; 2) the need to pro
vide culturall) based understanding of
economic and s< >c ial c lunge in Asia and the
\mei icas; and 3) the need to pro\ icle stu
dents with the c ultur.il and linguistic tools
needed to think critically and interact with
these communities. Fhese conditions pre
sent c uitic iilar responsibilities not c urrent
h faced In other language and literature
departments, a ditferenc e that the propos
al does not address.
I lie marginali/ation ot particular fields
would further recluce the number of tac ult\
and students ot color who choose to come to

Stanford. Insofar as concentrations in Latin
American, Francophone and ( hie ano Lati
no studies are c rucial factors in attracting
these students, the collapsing ot these de
partments would further dec rease Stanford's
abilitv to recruit and retain faculty and stu
dents from targeted minority groups.
Administrative motives lie at the
heart of this proposal. I he attempt to
create leverage .is a single large depart
ment does not address the- responsibility
of the I niversitv to address the existing
resource deficit or the shortage of pro
lessors able to chair and provide leader
ship for small departments. I'hese de
partments have been underfunded fbi
years; the "correction" to this problem,
however, should not be- to merge, but to
commit the resources necessary to build
each department according to its own
intellectual and c ut ricular chartcr.
I he merger of these departments
guarantees fomenting a c ulture of com
petitiveness among departments that are
alrcadv unclerresourced. While the logic
behind the proposal appeals to the "good
faith" of fac 11It \ and students in protecting
others' interests so that theirs might also
be protec ted, theonlv incentives provided
for cooperation are negative and are
based on competition.
Since the proposal makes no commit

incut to assigning facult\ billets, graduate
student fellowships 01 ciiituulaidevelop
ment funds to anv particular at ca, there is
nothing to prevent am one group from lie
coining particularh weakened within the
new consolidated department. I 'renting .ill
areas as structurall\ equivalent ignores the
realit\ that certain departments arc al
rcad\ severeU under"resourced. I he pro
posal otters no institution.il mechanisms to
correct this imbalatue.
I-'inallv, although the proposal hears
directh on students, the plan has ad
vanced with no student input. Moie
over, graduate students have been in
tbrnied that 1) anv suggestions at this
point will onlv he considered if the\ re
main within the current boundaries ol
the proposal and 2) there is no possibili
t\ ol considering alternative tranie
woi ks. We agree that change and inno
vation is needed. I lowcvei. it is our i iglit
as students to have the opportunit\ to
come to the table with tacult\ and ad
ministrators before this proposal is pre
sented to the I niversitv Advisoi v Boanl
next Wednesdav.
