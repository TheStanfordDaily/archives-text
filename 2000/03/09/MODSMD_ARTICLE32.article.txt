Although the team struggled
in tin- final minutes, the (Cardinal
offense showed impressive
depth, .is seven different plavers
found the b.u k of the net. Senior

more creative ways, and taking
advantage of every opening thev

after Davidson's fourth goal to
break the Wildcats' momentum.
"The timeout gave the team
time to focus and talk to each

opportunity for us to make ad
justments and gain bat k our own
momentum."
I he quick break seemed to be
just the fix Stanford (.">-1) need
ed. After trading qui( k goals with
tlie 1 )avidson (2-2) team, the (Car
dinal went on an inspired scoring
spree, racking up seven unan
swered goals, including three in a
row from Britt. /
"It was our first weekda\ game
ot the season, and we were com

ing otf a big weekend, so we came
out a little slow, but we picked it
up and that was great," Britt said.
1 anese finished otf the second
hall with a goal from around the
crease, making the score 9-5 in
Stanford's favor at the break.
Stanford maintained this lead
comfortably throughout the ma

8:19 left in the game, freshman
Abbi I fills filed in an athletic
sidearin goal, putting the Cardi

largest lead ot the game.
Ii was the last goal Stanford
would store. The Wildcats rallied
in the final minutes, but Stanford
managed to keep the victory
from slipping away.
Senior tri-captain Dana katter
