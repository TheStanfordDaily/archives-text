KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS, LEARNING, KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING:
1965 - 2015
50 Years of Lessons Learned & Lessons to be Learned
William Gates Computer Science Building, Room 803
Saturday, March 18, 2000, 2:OOPM to S:3OPM
Theme:
In a burst of creative scientific & technical activity, from 1965 to 1980, the Heuristic Programming Project (later the
Knowledge Systems Laboratory) pioneered many of the ideas and techniques that are widely used today in rule based sys
tems, integrated object-inference tools, knowledge based planning, domain rule learning, expert level advisers, models of inno
vation, and other areas of applied Artificial Intelligence. It is useful to think about the lessons learned since 1980. The world
of computers, users and communications has changed drastically. What are the "children" of the HPP ideas that will grow to
maturity in the coming 15 years?
