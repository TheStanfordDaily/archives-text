The Stanford Center For Latin American Studies
Announces A Call for Proposals for
2000 Faculty Research Grants
William And Flora Hewlett Foundation Grants support faculty summer interdisciplinary research projects
on poverty-related issues. The grants fund travel and modest living costs for research in Latin America.
Latin American Studies Summer Faculty Research Grants will be awarded to Stanford faculty
members for travel to Latin America for research during the summer quarter. Because the grants
provide only modest support for travel and research (no salary offsets), applicants are encour
aged to seek supplementary funding from other sources.
U.S. Department Of Education Language Across The Curriculum Grants offer an incentive to
Stanford faculty to incorporate Spanish or Portuguese into non-language-specific courses. TWo
granLs of $4,500 each will be awarded to faculty members to enhance course development.
Funds may be used for summer research assistants, summer teaching assistants, materials and
supplies and other means to further the incorporation of these languages into a broader curricu
lum. Note: These funds must be expended by August 14, 2000.
To apply, please submit the following: A cover sheet (available from the Center), a 1-2 page proposal
(outlining research objectives and methodology), a budget including RT airfare and per diem allowance
(if applicable).
DEADLINE for all grant applications: April 24th, 2000.
Additional information is available at the Center for Latin American Studies, 582 Alvarado Row, (650) 723-2012.
