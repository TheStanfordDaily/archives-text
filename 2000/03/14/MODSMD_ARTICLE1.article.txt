## Cardinal flies south, grabs first top seed in Stanford history 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's little late-season
swoon, in which the Cardinal
lost two of its last three games,
hurt the team in its continuing
search for national respect. But
instead of being a life-threaten
ing gash, it now looks like noth
ing more than a tiny knick.
Despite losing to Arizona and
UCLA in consecutive games to
drop down to a tie with the Wild
cats for the Pacific 10 Confer
ence title, Stanford (26-3) still
earned the school's first-ever
No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tour
nament, the NCAA Selection
Committee announced Sunday.
Joining the Cardinal as No. 1

seeds are Duke (East Region),
Michigan State (Midwest) and
Arizona (West).
Stanford is the No. 1 seed in
the South Region and will begin
play Friday in Birmingham, Ala.
against South (larolina State, the
winner of the Mideastern Athlet
ic Conference.
"This is very gratify ing," said
Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "We got a No. I
seed, it can't get better than
this."
Well, probably not. II the
Cardinal had beat Arizona last
Thursday, Stanford almost cer
tainly would have been the No. I
seed in the West with games in
either Salt Lake (lit) or Tucson,
Ariz., followed by the Regional

Finals in Albuquerque, if the
team continued to win. That
might have been better.
But Stanford admitted it had
little to complain about. Even if
the team has to fly three time
zones away to a South Region
that looks more than a little for
midable.
C Cincinnati, which would have
entered the tournament as the
overall No. 1 team, was given the
No. 2 seed after probable Na
tional Player of the Year Kenyon
Martin went down for tlu* year
with a broken leg against Saint
Louis. Ohio State, lennessee,
CConnecticut, and North (Caroli
na will also be heading south.
"1 think all the guys are really
excited to be in the bracket," said
senior Mark Madsen. "Those
are great teams. We're ready to
start lighting for our wins. We
were on cruise control [before
LCL\| and now I think we're
pedal to the mettle."
Two other Pac-10 teams, be
sides Stanford and Arizona, also
made the field.
Oregon, which finished the
year in third place in the confer
ence with a 22-7 record, was
seeded seventh in the Eastern
region and faces a difficult sec
ond-round matchup with Tem
ple, if the Ducks get past first
round Seton 1 fall.
L (CI A was given a six seed in
the Midwest with a potentially
easier road through the bracket.
After all the hype of last sea
son when Stanford earned a No.
2 seed in the tournament, the
players admitted the step up to a
top seed, though a major accom
plishment, was easier to handle.
"Last year was a big adjust
ment going from underdog to
top dog," said senior David
Moseley. "Now, we're ready for
it."
"It" includes the added pres
sure, the added media attention
— and accompanying questions
about last year's upset loss to
10th-seeded Gonzaga in the sec
ond-round — and, of course, the
added expectations. But not all
of those expectations come from
outside. "()ne ofour goals was to
make the National (Champi
onship game," Moseley said.
"We don't have the feeling of ac
complishment we had last year.
Last year we won the Pac-10 for
the first time, we said, 'yeah, we

And if so, Stanford has

more places to go, 100. U tile

games in Birmingham, it will
travel to Austin, Texas, for the
Sweet Mi and Regional Finals.

in Indianapolis for the Final

ford first made its mark on the
national scene two years ago,
and maybe, just maybe, a re
match with Arizona lor an un
precedented All-Pac-10 final

game.
"We want that," Moseley
said while breaking into a big
smile. "It's hard to beat some
body three times in a year,
and for the championship
game. It's be great."
