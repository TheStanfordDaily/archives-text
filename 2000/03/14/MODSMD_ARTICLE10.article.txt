# Wildcats take matchup at McKale and steal share of conference title
## 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
A lot was on the line for Stanford last
Thursday in Tucson: its second consecu
tive outright Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionship, a No. 1 seed in the Western
bracket of the NCAA Tournament and,
for seniors Mark Madsen, David Moseley
and Alex Gelbard, a chance to win in the
McKale Center for the first time.
But Arizona, already undermanned
without All-conference center Loren
Woods, outplayed the second-ranked
Cardinal in every facet of the game, win
ning 86-81 to sweep Stanford for the sea
son and establish its own claim to the No.
1 seed.
"This was for an outright conference
championship and we got outscrapped,"
said Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "We need to play harder and
tougher and, again, we need to play
smarter."
Montgomery was not the only one to
question Stanford's effort on the court.
Following the game, the Cardinal held an
fiery players-only meeting in the locker
room, discussing the intensity and emo
tion the team displayed against Arizona
and in the previous game, a 94-93 over

time loss to UCLA.
"We've already regrouped," Madsen
said after the meeting. "We talked about a
lot of things. If a guy had something on his
chest, he said it."
After the meeting, though, many play
ers were still visibly upset from the team's
pt>or play and missed opportunities.
"Everybody's outplaying us," said ju
nior forward Ryan Mendez. "We need to
get tougher and more intense. If guy has
an open layup, let's lay him out, make him
shoot free throws. If there's a ball on the
fl(X)r, let's go get it. They just played hard
er than we did."
That's for sure. On defense, Arizona
was as aggressive as any team in the coun
try. Fhe Wildcats recorded 14 steals and
forced a total of 18 turnovers.
Arizona head coach Lute Olsen's strat
egy to double and even triple-team Stan
ford's post players paid off as well. With
out W(K)ds, Olsen was forced to start back
up center Justin Wessel alongside All-con
ference forward Michael Wright. Wessel
met the challenge, recording five steals
and playing solid defense before leaving
with an ankle injury midway through the
second half. He helped hold Jarron and
Jason Collins to only two points each.
"We thought we'd have an advantage

at the post," Montgomery said. But, "we
did the same thing we did against them
last time. We couldn't establish an inside
game."
The flow of die game was eerily remi
niscent of Arizona's 68-65 win on Jan. 8 in
other ways as well. The only difference
was that this time W<xxls was on the bench
in street clothes and Jefferson was tearing
into Stanford on the court.
Jefferson, a sophomore forward who
was considered All-conference material
before his injury, was only three games
into his comeback when he faced Stan
ford. And in the two previous games,
upset losses to Oregon State and Oregon,
he didn't score a point.
Thursday he not only scored, he
scored often, racking up 19 points. In the
second half, when the Wildcats extended
a 39-37 half time lead into a 15-point cush
ion, fie was extraordinary. He scored 13
points on an array of alley-oop dunks and
nearly unstoppable fadeaway jumpers.
"I just tried to get some easy shots and
then once I got comfortable, 1 didn't hesi
tate," he said.
But Jefferson wasn't the only Wildcat
whom Stanford had difficulty stopping.
Sophomore forward Michael Wright
scored 20 points on nine-for-17 shooting.
