# Cardinal gets back on track with victory over Sun Devils
## 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
Stanford needed a win against Arizona Suite badly.
On the heels of two straight losses, the Cardinal had to
right itself before the NCAA Tournament, not neces
sarily for its seeding but for the sake of the team's men
tal mindframe.
After talking extensively among themselves after
the Arizona loss about playing with greater emotion
and intensity, Stanford needed the win to stave off an
especially ill-timed case of serious self-doubt.
Luckily for its psyche, Stanford got the win, beating
the Sun Devils 65-57 at Wells Fargo Arena. But
though it gave Stanford a share of the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championship with Arizona, it didn't come
easy.
"Obviously we could play a whole lot better," said
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery after reflect
ing upon the Cardinal's dismal opening to the game.
But, he emphasized, "that was a much guttier perfor
mance for us."
An especially inspired performance came from
freshman Casey Jacobsen. While he scored a game
high 17 points on the offensive end, his defense was
even more impressive and important for Stanford.
Arizona State, which probably would have made
the NCAA Tournament with an upset of Stanford,
put most of its hopes in senior guard Eddie House,
who was playing the final game of his collegiate ca
reer. But after scoring the Sun Devils' first seven
points while guarded by senior David Moseley, he
had only four the rest of the way. House's 11 points
left him five short of the school's career scoring
record.
The difference was Jacobsen. The freshman took
over for Moseley after the first five minutes and guard
ed House tightly the rest of the way. Though he gave
away a lot of quickness, Jacobsen stayed with House
enough to hold him to a 5-23 shooting performance.
"It was a team effort," Jacobsen said. "1 got a lot of
help from my teammates. [That] gave me more free
dom to take chances on Eddie because if he drove, he
had to shoot over Jarron and Jason [Collins]."

While the twins again failed to put up impressive
numbers offensively — they combined for 10 points
after scoring a total of four against Arizona — their ef
fort was noticed.
"We saw some fire in Jarron today," said senior for
ward Mark Madsen, who had been especially critical of
his team's desire the game before. "He came out with
such a controlled intensity. He just set the tone."
Still, for the first 10 minutes of the game, it didn't
seem that Stanford's renewed spirit made much of a
difference. Displaying the same sloppiness which
characterized the team in its losses to Arizona and
UCIA, Stanford fell behind by 10 with just over 10
minutes left in the half. At the time, the Cardinal had
scored a meager six points but had already turned the
ball over an amazing 10 times.
"We were pressing a little bit too much," said start
ing junior point guard Mike McDonald. "We thought
we needed to get a big lead to start the game and we
forced some things."
However after sophomore backup Tony Giovac
chini replaced McDonald, things went much
smoother for Stanford. The team scored 15 straight
points to regain the lead before the Sun Devils used a
string of threes to take a 36-32 cushion into intermis
sion.
In the second half, the Cardinal jumped out a to a
lead early and never looked back, fueled once again by
its defense. After shooting just over 30 percent in the
first half, the Sun Devils were even worse in the sec
ond, shooting under 27 percent. Along with House's
horrid numbers, Tanner Shell was 3-for-ll and
Tommy Smith was l-for-5.
"That's the way we play," Montgomery said.
"That's the way we've gone through the league, that's
our game. Maybe we're back on track defensively."
Madsen, who scored eight points to go with nine re
bounds, said Sunday the loss to Arizona actually
helped the team refocus.
"The loss to Arizona was a huge positive for us," he
said. "We know what we have to do to win. We have to
scrap, we have to play tough, we have to be gritty."
Going into the NCAA Tournament isn't a bad time
to remember that.
