# Lute offers lesson in Beating Stanford 101
## 
### JIM TANKERSLEY EDITORIAL STAFF 
Fourteen thousand rich, old,
screaming Arizonans packed
McKale Center Thursday to see

Wildcat head
coach Lute
Olson deliver
his biannual lec
ture on how to
beat Stanford.
In the
school of stop
ping the Cardi
nal, Olson is a
tenured profes-

sor, boasting a lifetime 24-7 record
against Mike Montgomery teams
and a knack for knocking off Sum
ford when it counts most.
Thursday, Olson painstakingly
laid out a blueprint for besting the
Cardinal. Double Mark Madsen
immediately in the post. Stick to the
wings on the perimeter. Cet into
passing lanes, and make the Cardi
nal drive the lane to lx*at you.
His team executed the plan per
fectly. The result: Stanford shot
42.2 percent for the floor and
turned the ball over 18 times, large
ly due to 14 Wildcat steals. Hot
three-point shooting at the begin

ning and end of the game kept the
Cardinal close, but for most of the
game, the team looked lost offen
sively.
"We just felt with our quickness,"
Olson said after the game, "that if
we could make them put the ball on
the floor, we could create some
problems for them."
One glaring problem for Stan
ford: With Michael Wright battling
Mark Madsen, and Loren Woods
on the sideline, the Cardinal failed
all night to exploit a large size ad
vantage at the other post over 6-
foot-8 Justin Wessel.
Instead, the Cardinal settled for
outside shots and drives from the
wing, a fact that frustrated Mont
gomery.
"We could not get an inside
game established that we wanted to
get," he said. "I'm not sure that
shooting 26 threes is the way we
want to do it."
It was a clear case of an extreme
ly athletic team dictating the flow of
the game to the Cardinal. And
don't think that a pack of high-pow
ered NCAA Tournament squads —
such as Michigan State, Ohio State,
Duke, Tennessee, Kentucky —
weren't taking notes.
Stanford's trademark all year

has been an inside-outside game
that dares you to pick your poison.
Focus on our big men, the Cardinal
says, and our shooters will make
you pay. Concentrate on the guards
and we'll eat you up inside.
Usually, teams try to do one and
end up doing neither; Stanford
wins big when it controls the paint
and rains threes. Thanks to its supe
rior athletes, Arizona nearly did
both.
Montgomery does not put the
most athletic team in the NCAA on
the court. Olson might. On nights
when the Cardinal is physically out
matched, it typically wins by stick
ing to the fundamentals, out-hus
tling the opposition and playing a
suffocating position defense that
keeps games close.
T hat didn't work Thursday for
two reasons: Arizona made the
most of its offensive talent (Ryan
Mendez could have nightmares for
weeks of Richard Jefferson drain
ing fall-away jumpers in his face) to
shoot better than 50 percent from
the floor, and the Cardinal simply
did not want this one bad enough to
win all the little battles.
One other strike against Stan
ford: The team is so good, it draws
everybody's best shot. Don't think

for a second that the tournament
won't bring more of the same. If the
Cardinal wants to avoid another
athletic ambush, it must improve in
several areas:
•Offensive patience. Stanford
fell into a second-half lull Thursday
that always seemed to end with 15
seconds on the shot clock and a con
tested three-point shot or a runner
in traffic. It lacked crisp passing, es
pecially in the post, and the kind of
ball movement that would have
made an overextended Arizona de
fense pay.
•Mental toughness. Stanford
should have beaten UCLA but
missed several opportunities to seal
the game in the closing minutes of
both regulation and overtime. It
didn't deserve to beat 'Zona be
cause it never matched die Wild
cats' focus and intensity.
• Taking care of the basketball.
Eighteen turnovers is way too many
for any team, let alone a "smart"
one like Stanford. The Cardinal,
while leading the Pacific 10 Confer
ence in nearly every important of
fensive category, is near the bottom
in turnovers per game.
Stanford must learn from Lute's
lessons come tourney time. Class
dismissed,
