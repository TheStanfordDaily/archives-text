zona (24-6, 13-5) 79-72 on 1 hursday, and routing Arizona State (14-
14, 7-1 1) 91-67 on Saturday. 4 he split was good enough for a shared
second place spot in the conference standings with the Wildcats. Ore
gon (23-7, 14-4) won the Pac-10 title outright after a victory against
Oregon State this weekend.
Against the Wildcats, the rebounding differential made the critical
difference in the game. Arizona had nearly twice as many boards as
Stanford, out-rebounding the Cardinal 40-23, including an 18-8 of
fensive rebound advantage.
I thought Arizona played extremely well," said head coach Tara
VanDerveer. 1 hey were playing inspired. Their offensive rebound
ing was totally what broke our backs."
1 he Cardinal was ahead for the majority of the first half, led by the
three three-pointers of freshman guard Jamie Carey and the contri
butions ol sophomore Lindsey Yainasaki.
\\ ith just over seven minutes left in the first half, Yamasaki stole the
ball and pulled up for a seven foot jumper. Yamasaki hit another two
jump shots on the (Cardinal's next two runs down the floor. With 4:32
remaining in the half, Carey drained a three to give Stanford its
biggest lead of the game 27-18.
Arizona rallied back due in large part to the inside play of senior
Angela Lackey, who came off the bench to score 1 1 of her 14 points in
the first hall. After a 7-2 advantage iu last four minutes of the half, the
Wildcats went into the locker room down by only four, 29-25.
Stanford continued to hold a slight advantage throughout the
opening minutes. A three-pointer by Wildcat senior Monika Crank
gave Arizona its first lead since the opening minutes, with just under
15 minutes to play. Cardinal sophomore Lauren St. Clair hit a three
at the other side putting Stanford ahead by two.
But from that point on it was all Arizona. The Wildcats, led by ju
nior Res Ilea Bristol, scored 10 unanswered points to put them ahead
by eight.
I lie Cardinal continued to struggle, fouling Arizona throughout
the c losing moments in attempts to get the ball back, 112 lowever, the was
never able to bring the game closer than six.
(larey, junior (larolyn Moos, and senior Milena Mores led the (Car
dinal in scoring with 15 points a piece. St. Clair c hipped in 12. Flores
led the (-at dinal with a game high eight assists.
Bristol and (.rank led the victorious Wildcats, each scoring 15. Eliz
abeth I'ic kney had a game-high nine rebounds for Arizona.
After riiursclay's game VanDerveer was noticeably discontent with
her team's effort.
"I think we need people playing with a sense of urgency," Van-
Derveer said. ' 1 think we need people playing with passion and en
thusiasm and focusing on what our team needs."

The Cardinal seemed to answer VanDerveer's concerns as soon as
the squad stepped out on the door on Saturday.
Seniors Flores, Christina Batastini and Yvonne Cbalazeh were
honored before the game setting the tone for perhaps one of Stan
ford's best performances of the season.
"It is a good way to send our seniors out," VanDerveer said.
Stanford shot a season high 64.4 percent from the field, including
a 56.3 mark from behind the three-point line.
Although it was senior night on the Farm, the first half belonged to
the freshman Carey. She hit three three pointers, including a beauti
ful shot from the top of the key with 7:39 remaining in the first half,
giving her 7(i threes on the season. The mark puts her first on the all
time Stanford single season three-point list.
"1 didn't even realize 1 did it until there was thirty seconds left in
the game," Carey said. "It feels awesome, considering the great tradi
tion of three-point shooters.
In the second half, the Cardinal mounted a balanced attack that
played to each individual player's strength.
1 0 of 1 1 players on the (cardinal roster scored six points or more in
the game with St. Clair leading the way with 14 shooting a perfect six
for-six 112 rom t lie field. Yamasaki chipped in 12 on five-for-six shooting.
In her last home game, Flores displayed poise and confidence as
she dished out eleven assists, while running the Stanford offense.
"It is a special place to be here for four years," said Flores. "The
crowd here is amazing. It was a great feeling to walk off the court for
the last time seeing as we were playing so well."
