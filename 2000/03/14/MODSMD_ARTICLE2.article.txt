# As Mad as he wants to be
## Think Mark Madsen is just a tough guy on the court and a softy on the street? Think again. 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
Mark Madsen loves little kids.
He loves to go into schools after the season
is over to talk with them about basketball and
academics and staying away from drugs.
After his basketball career is over he wants
to coach, to teach the game to a new genera
tion, whether it's five-year-olds or high school
students.
But one kid in Oregon is not on the Mad
Dog's good side. And, if you've ever read or

heard anything about Madsen, you know it
takes a lot to do that.
After Stanford beat Oregon by 14 points in
Kugene, Ore., Madsen was walking back to the
locker room reflecting on his recent perfor
mances, none of which were very good.
In the Cardinal's first loss of the season, a
68-65 defeat to Arizona on Jan. 8 that dropped
Stanford from its spot atop the national rank
ings and Madsen's first start since he injured
his thigh against Duke Nov. 11, he was almost
a non-factor. On offense, he hit one of seven
shots and scored only two points. He pulled
down eight rebounds — even that's less than
average for Madsen — and was ineffective on
defense.
In the featured matchup with Arizona
power forward Michael Wright, Madsen came
out on the losing end. Wright scored 15 points

and kept him away from the basket all after
noon l<>l)g.
The next two games weren't much better
for Madsen, even if Stanford did win. Against
Oregon State, he had eight points and 10 re
bounds but looked sluggish. Against Oregon,
Madsen got off only three shots and scored just
four points.
So, with these games swirling around his
mind, coming down the tunnel from ()regon's
McArthur Court, Madsen was less than happy.
"After Oregon, I was questioning my ability
to play at this level," said Madsen, who was hav
ing difficulty adjusting to the speed and flow of
the game after spending seven weeks on the
sidelines. "I was thinking to myself, 'am I able
to recover from this injury and play well
again.-'
The answer to that has been an emphatic yes.
Since those games, Maclsen has averaged 14.1 points
and almost 10 rebounds per game. Twice he has
scored 20 points and once he brought down 20 re
bounds, a school record Madsen set against Wash
ington.
But, the answer is probably less important. The
fact that Madsen asked such a thing is profound in it
self.
Recently named a second-team All-American and
first-team All-Pacific-10-Conference, he has consis
tently established himself as one of the top power for
wards in the nation. From his freshman year playing
with Brevin Knight, to his impression of "King
Kong" on national television sophomore year, to his
ascent to national prominence and notoriety last sea
son, to his position this year as elder statesman and de
facto spokesman for Stanford and college basketball
in general, Madsen has always been ready.
But even for a man described by USA Today as
"St. Mark" for his extremely good-natured ways, a
man whose mere name sparks Dick Vitale to froth at
the mouth, a player who others hate to play against
but love to talk with after the game, the seeds of self
doubt are always ready to begin growing.
But a self-critical, ponderous, normal Mark Mad
sen is not what we have come to know. Instead, what
is normally presented of him is a caricature. A carica
ture that even Madsen himself can chuckle at.
"I have rough days. I have a lot to do. I get busy.
Sometimes I don't spend enough time with the peo
ple that 1 want to. I have bad times just like everybody
else," he said adding, "I've learned that you're never
nearly as good or as bad as people say. You're some

where in the middle."
Madsen might be "somewhere in the middle" of
his many glowing characterizations but in general, he
is not in the middle of most people. Mark Madsen is
anything but average.
On the court, he is Mad Dog Madsen. Given the
nickname by an elementary school gym teacher,
Madsen has never shied away from tough, hard
nosed play.
His opponents notice. After scoring 20 points on
Madsen in Stanford's 67-57 win over USC, forward
Brian Scalabrine called Madsen the best defender he's
ever faced. Scalabrine said his positioning was so good
that Madsen was the "Michael Jordan of footwork."
Even after Michael Wright lit up Madsen, Wright,
a hulking but usually quiet power forward, called the
game a "battle" and said any matchup with Madsen is
"like a dogfight."
1 lis teammates exhibit a similar amount of respect
for his on-court talent. When he was sidelined with
the injury, many players had memorialized him on
their shoes, either with a "45" for his number or with
a "Mad" on one side and "Dog" on the other. In the
preseason media guide when players were asked to
name the toughest player they have ever faced, both
Curtis Borchardt and Jar Ton Collins named Madsen.
"He plays so hard," said Jarron, "you just have to
follow his intensity and his lead."
()ff the court, he does things with just as much in
tensity. Except, instead of working hard at setting a
screen or boxing someone out, he works at being
nice. So while he's a Mad Dog in uniform, he's often
referred to as a puppy dog off the court.
Here's where the Madsen legend has grown to leg
endary status.
While Dick Vitale will usually talk about a player's
vertical leap or "dipsy doo dunkeroo" ability, when
the topic of Madsen comes up, it's a completely dif
ferent song-and-dance.

"Last fall, I'm in New York City for the Preseason
NI T and I'm walking through the hotel lobby and I
see Mark Madsen, the Mad Dog himself, sitting in the
hotel restaurant by himself on a Friday night. He's
not out on the town being a superstar, he's sitting
there working on a term paper. He's a fantastic stu
dent athlete, baby, a credit to the game of college bas
ketball! He's incredible baby, 1 love him!" goes the
story in pure Vitale fashion
Not that it's not true. It is, just like the one about
him sleeping outside all night with his dog because he
thought it would be lonely, or the one about Madsen
driving 60 miles out of his way every day this summer
just to pick up a teammate for weightlifting. They're
all true, but taken together without knowing him
very well, you get the impression that Mark Madsen
is a bit ridiculous, some kind of media creation ol
sporting perfection.
"Sports figures are exalted a lot by the media," said
Mark's good friend, Scott Kim. "It loses who they are.
It's not a reality. They become people's heroes. Know
ing Mark and reading the media, it loses how down to
earth he is, how normal and regular a guy he is."
And despite the lily-white reputation that has been
created for him, Madsen said he does not feel like he
must live up to the standard his actions created or the
image they spawned.
"I have my times when I go into a shell," he said.
"But I don't feel any pressure to act in a certain way.
If indeed I felt the pressure based on the media and
acted on it, that would be a sorry way to live."
Irately he has been more vocal and provocative. Al
ways up-front about his religious convictions but never
preachy or intrusive, Madsen has taken a more influ
ential role in the campus view of Mormons as head of
the Latter-Day Saints Student Association. When asked
as head of the group recently about his views on the

just-approved California Proposi
tion 22, which effectively banned
gay marriage, he didn't hesitate to
voice his religious support of the
measure.
On the court and in the locker
room, he has become just as vocal.
In the players-only meeting after
Stanford's 86-81 loss to Stanford
Thursday, the Cardinal's second
loss to the Wildcats this season,
Madsen was said to have thrown a
shoe among other invectives. But
of course, he didn't cuss.
"I was pretty intense in the meet
ing," he said. "But it was good, it
gave everyone a chance to say what
they felt. We got a lot out of it."
just as Stanford hopes to gain a
lot from the team's recent strug
gles, Madsen said his early-season
injury and resulting problems
have also strengthened him.
"Early in the season, coining
back from the injury, I went
through some extremely tough
times," he said. "I was putting
some extreme pressures on myself
to be the player people wanted me

to be. When 1 couldn't do the
things I base my game upon — re
bounding and putting the ball
back in — it hurt."
Probably not as much as that
kid he met in Oregon.
Walking down the tunnel tired
and sweating, Madsen saw a boy
about 10-years-old waiting to talk
to him. I lie kid put out his hand
and shouted, "good game, Mark."
So Madsen, tired and upset about
the game, decided to shake his
hand and express his usual Mad
Dog charm. But once Madsen
bent down and started shaking his
hand, the kid began gripping it vi
olently and changed his tune.
"You're awful," he said.
"You're going to lose next time
you come up to Oregon."
Madsen ripped his hand out of
the mini-vice-grip and walked to
the locker room shaking his head.
The man with a ready smile and
eternal good will was spent, both
physically and now mentally.
"That was just the cherry on top
of my day,"he said sarcastically.
It figures. Mad Dog, the gentle
giant whose lace brightens at the
sight of a kid, was vanquished . . .
by a runt.
