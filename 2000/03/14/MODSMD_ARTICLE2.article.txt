# As Mad as he wants to be
## Think Mark Madsen is just a tough guy on the court and a softy on the street? Think again.

Mark Madsen loves little kids.
He loves to go into schools after the season
is over to talk with them about basketball and
academics and staying away from drugs.
After his basketball career is over he wants
to coach, to teach the game to a new genera
tion, whether it's five-year-olds or high school
students.
But one kid in Oregon is not on the Mad
Dog's good side. And, if you've ever read or

heard anything about Madsen, you know it
takes a lot to do that.
After Stanford beat Oregon by 14 points in
Kugene, Ore., Madsen was walking back to the
locker room reflecting on his recent perfor

In the Cardinal's first loss of the season, a
68-65 defeat to Arizona on Jan. 8 that dropped
Stanford from its spot atop the national rank
ings and Madsen's first start since he injured
his thigh against Duke Nov. 11, he was almost
a non-factor. On offense, he hit one of seven
shots and scored only two points. He pulled
down eight rebounds — even that's less than
average for Madsen — and was ineffective on
defense.
In the featured matchup with Arizona
power forward Michael Wright, Madsen came
out on the losing end. Wright scored 15 points

and kept him away from the basket all after
noon l<>l)g.
The next two games weren't much better
for Madsen, even if Stanford did win. Against
Oregon State, he had eight points and 10 re
bounds but looked sluggish. Against Oregon,
Madsen got off only three shots and scored just
four points.
So, with these games swirling around his
mind, coming down the tunnel from ()regon's
McArthur Court, Madsen was less than happy.
"After Oregon, I was questioning my ability
to play at this level," said Madsen, who was hav
ing difficulty adjusting to the speed and flow of
the game after spending seven weeks on the
sidelines. "I was thinking to myself, 'am I able
to recover from this injury and play well
