# Women off to Georgia to face No. 8 Michigan
## Cardinal reaches tournament for 13th straight year; No. 1 seed Georgia looms in second round 
### MAUREEN MULLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Women's bas
ketball team (20-8) secured its
1 3th consecutive bid to the NCAA
tournament yesterday, earning a
ninth seed in the Western Re
gional. The Cardinal will meet
the No. 8 seed Michigan (22-7)
on Saturday during the first
round of play in Athens, Ca.
"We'd like a higher seed, but
its great for us to be in the West,"
said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "It's going to be an ex
cellent match-up with Michigan."
Stanford's No. 9 seed is the
lowest it has ever received in its
previous 13 years in the tourna
ment.
However, Pacific 10 Confer
ence champion Oregon received
only a sixth-place seed, causing
some speculation surrounding
the respect the conference re
ceived from this year's selection
committee.
The close Pac-10 race is proba
bly partially the cause. Despite
the disappointing seed, however,
VanDerveer believes that the
tough conference play will prove
beneficial in the playoffs.
"This year, personally I think
our games in the Pac-10 have
prepared our team better for the
NCAA tournament than any
other year we've ever played,"
VanDerveer said. "I think its to
our benefit."
Regardless ol its seed, the (Car
dinal is excited for its first round
match-up. The Wolverines are
coming off a second-place finish
to Purdue in the Rig 10 Confer
ence tournament.
Michigan is led by senior for
ward Stacey Thompson, who
topped the Big 10 in steals en
route to conference Defensive
Player of the Year honors.
Thompson also leads the team in
scoring and rebounding.
However, il the Cardinal gets
past the- Wolverines, it will have
to face the winner of No. 1 Geor
gia vs. No. 1 (j Montana.
Coming from one of the na
tion's toughest conferences, the
Southeastern Conference that
features perennial powerhouse
Tennessee, Georgia is one of the

favorites to win this year's tour
nament.
However, the hurdle doesn't
bother VanDerveer.
" I lie best tiling lot 11 s all veai
has been not to be in the top dog
position," she said. "I know that
from being a No. I seed. I've had
some ver\ tense moments against
an eight or a nine."
Stanford comes into the tour
nament after losing two < onset u
tive first round games in its past
two seasons.
I 'his year the team hopes to
get over the first round hurdle
and make it all the wav to the fi
nals.
"We have a dut\ to earn on
the great ness ol St a n ford
women's basketball," s.iid senioi
point guard Milena Mores.
"That's the reason win we came.
We came because it's a winning
program, bet a use ol the champi
onships and because ol the 112 ilial
Fours."

Mores, who received All-Pac
-10 honors Sundav, and guard
(amie Carev. the Pat-10 Iresh
man ol the \ ear, w ill be < i it it al to
the Cardinal's firepower, lint
Stanford has other weapons as
well.
"Show me a ba< kcourt that has
played am bettei than Milena
and Jamie, VanDerveer said.
"Or show me somebod\ that is
shooting the ball better than Lau
ren (St. (llait |. ()r the depth that
we have with l.indse\ (Yamasakij
coming oil the bench, or Sarah
| Dimson |. And we obviouslv
don t lat k si/e.
\'anl)erveei said intensitx will
determine the Cardinal's tourna
ment fate.
"lot oui team," she said, "its
going to come down to digging in
and plaving with passion and
plavitig liungrv. You look at it
and sa\ vou don't like that were a
ninth seed. We're going to do
something about it."
