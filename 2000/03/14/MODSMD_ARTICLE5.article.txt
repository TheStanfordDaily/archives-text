I hey say that a great coach c an make an athlete play beyond
his or her ability. Coaching is more than instruction — it is a si
multaneous responsibility and desire to extract from people tal
ents and dedication they did not know they existed within them.
I he mark of all great coaches is seen in their teams; not only
through win and loss ratios, but also through the characteristics
that winning teams inevitably possess.
l at a VanDerveer, the coach of Stanford's Women's Basket
ball team, is one such coach.
A woman with an impressive past as both a player and a coach,
VanDerveer has led many different basketball programs to vic
tory. I lei life experiences and successful past shows in her coach
ing. I he upper echelons of athletics are about more than raw
skill, and VanDerveer's past teams play with the knowledge, mo
tivation, and heart to prove it
Playing for VanDerveer, "is awesome," freshman Jamie Carey
s<iid. "She is a very challenging coach and is teaching me some
thing new every single day I am out on the floor."
Although she has the statistic s to match her coaching capabil
ities, as with any superior coach, VanDerveer's success stems not
only from her capacity for basketball but her character. In addi
tion to skills and fundamentals, her coaching includes the men
tal and psychological aspects of the game.
One of VanDerveer's strengths is her analytic ability that al
lows her get to the bottom of all of her players' skill levels and tal
ents, predict in what ways a player will best contribute to the team
and then dec ide how best to formulate a strategy.
"Playing for VanDerveer has been a great experience," said

senior point guard Milena Flores. "She hits high expectations,
which can be a challenge at times. She sees the greatness in her
athletes and helps to bring it out."
VanDerveer's life has been the practice of focusing on goals,
and she knows the value that dedication can have during crunch
time. After a recent loss, VanDerveer described the rebounding
effort by saying, "This is more about character and heart... Los
ing doesn't have to be a negative thing."
The coach's current success has developed as a result of her
past experiences both on and off the court. As a starting guard at
the University of Indiana, VanDerveer was a crucial part of the
school's basketball program. After graduating, the Dean's List

Northern California Women's Intercollegiate Coach of the year

Women's Sports Foundation Hall of Fame.
As one of the nat ion's best recruiters, VanDerveer has a keen
ability to judge skill level and potential. The list of athletes who
have played under VanDerveer is most impressive, and includes
current professionals Jennifer Azzi, Kate Starbird, ()lympia Scott
and Jamila Wideman.VanDerveer has coached students who
have gone on to be (Mympians, players in the American Basket

Twenty years after she graduated from University of Indiana,
was inducted inf<V'fhe Indians ,( !Jni\ l <^sity if H&tf M

VanDerveer had started to display as a player for their team. Tt is
a long road from being a college athlete to becoming the coach of
gold-medalist Olympic team, but VanDerveer lias masterfully
traversed it with talent, intellect, dedication, and heart.
This mentality has propelled each of her teams to greatness,
and with the continued efforts of both the coach and her players,
the future will hold memories and successes all its own.
