Freshman Jamie Carey got an extra
special present yesterday, when she was

man of Year on her 19th birthday.
'Fhe only freshman on this year's Car
dinal roster, Carey made 76 three point
ers this season to break the team's single
season three point record. Fhe previous
record of 75 was held by Vanessa Nygard.
In addition Carey was second in the Pac

shooting 4().(i percent. Carey averaged
1 1.0 points per game and was second on
.the team in assists with 3.0.

She is even a little better thali I
thought she was," said Cardinal Women's
Basketball coach Fara VanDerveer of her
freshman standout.
Carey continues to even impress her
self with the contributions she has made to
this year's squad.
"Of course it's every freshman's
dream," Carey said. "You come in with
the mindset that you are going to help
your team in any way you can, whether it
is starting or coming in and being the
vocal voice on the floor, whatever you can
do to make your team better."
Carey, one of the top prep recruits in
1999 hails from Horizon High School in
Thornton, Colo., where she lead the state
in scoring her senior year.

Fhe future Cardinal received many
honors throughout her high school ca
reer, including 1999 Catorade Regional
Player of the Year honors, First Team Pa
rade Magazine Ail-American and three
year All-state recognition.
Carey's high school basketball jersey
was inducted into the Women's Basketball
Hall of Fame in 1999.
Multiple factors drove Carey to the
farm. As her high school valedictorian the
academics at Stanford played a major
role.
"My parents have always drilled in my
head academics, academics and it has
been a strong value of me," Carey said.
.She is currently undecided in respect to a
major, but has'a stroiYg interest in Psy
chology and Computer Science.
However playing for the Cardinal
women is no small feat.
"ft has always been a dream of mine,
since seventh grade," Carey added.
"When 1 came here 1 really fell in love with
it, I love my coaches and my teammates, it
is just a good fit for me."
Carey is the only freshman on this
year's women's team.
It is a role that presented some adjust
ments.
"ft is difficult being the only freshman,
because you don't have anyone else going
through the same thing," commented


The Stanford Daily File
Freshman Jamie Carey, the top newcomer in the Pacific 10 Conference this year, shoots a
pass earlier this season.
Carey, "Thank god, my teammates have
been really awesome."
Clearly Carey has had little trouble bring
ing her game to the college level. Carey start
ed in every game she played for the Cardinal,
with only senior point guard Milena Flores
receiving more playing time.
The freshman has had several huge
games for the Cardinal this season. She
scored a career high 25 points, including six
three pointers in the Stanford loss against
Washington.
Carey also scored 16 points in Stanford's
amazing come from behind win against Ore
gon, and took a similar role in the Cardinal's
defeat of Oregon State.
This play is even more remarkable con
sidering she has competed for a majority of
the season on a re-aggravated high left ankle
sprain, that has caused her to miss several
weeks of practice.
VanDerveer has nothing but praise for

her freshman star.
"She is a really smart player, she sees the
floor really well and anticipates passes for
people," commented the Cardinal coach.
"She is everything you could ask for offen
sively."
VanDerveer went on to state, "She is in
credible, for us she is like the John Stockton,
she comes in she is small, but she can guard
people, she handles the ball, she sh<x)ts the
ball, she passes the ball. For a coach she is a
thrill to work with"
Mores, Carey's partner in the back-court
is also extremely impressed with Carey's
play.
"I love playing with Jamie" Flores said.
"She is extremely competitive and has so
much heart. She understands the tradi
tion of Stanford basketball and really
wants to add to it. She's a complete team
player."
Carey will play a critical role for Stanford
in the NCAA tournament. The Pac-10 fresh
man of the year, certainly wouldn't mind an
opportunity to show the nation what she is
made of come the first weekend of April in
Philadelphia.
