# Challenges abound in the South Region

! By now, two days after Selection
Sunday, a little of the No. 1 seed lus
ter has worn off for Stanford. Car
dinal fans, getting down to the busi
ness of filling out their tournament
picks, are slowly coming to the same
realization.
1 he South Region is tough. And
deep. And loaded with teams that
could upend Sum ford on the road
to Indianapolis.
| No less than a half-dozen teams
in Birmingham and Nashville
could pull a Gonzaga and send
Stanford home early. Particularly
troublesome are Tennessee, Con
necticut and Ohio State, quick
scjuads with great athletes who sus
piciously resemble Arizona and
UCIA (the two teams to beat the
Cardinal this year).
; Stanford won't play them all, of
course. All the Cardnal has to do is
win four games in two weeks to
ei(rn a ticket to the RCA Dome and
college basketball's greatest specta
cle.
In case you've been t(K) busy
wjtli finals to scrutinize the entire
bracket, from Cincinatti to South

Carolina State, here's a breakdown
of the 11 teams most likely to stand
between Stanford and the Final
Four (the other top 10 seeds in the
region, and Stanford's first-round
opponent South Carolina State),
complete with reasons why they will
or won't derail the Cardinal.
No. 2 Cincinnati
Record: 28-3
Why they'll beat Stanford: Even
without Kenyon Martin, this is one
of the most talented teams in the
nation. Fete Mickael and Dermarr
Johnson can shoot very well from
the outside, and the Bearcats play a
tenacious defense. They have the
athletes to out-quick the Cardinal.
Why they won't: Stanford will own
the paint. If Martin was still in ac
tion, the seeds would probably be
reversed, and this would be one of
the marquee games of the tourna
ment. Without him, Cincy will be
lucky to make the regional final.
No. 3 Ohio State
Record: 22-6
Why they'll beat Stanford: The
combination of Scoonie Penn and
Michael Redd gives the Buckeyes
