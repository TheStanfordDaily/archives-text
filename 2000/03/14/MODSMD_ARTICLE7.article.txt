# Challenges abound in the South Region
## 
### JONATHAN STULL JIM TANKERSLEY STAFF WRITERS 
! By now, two days after Selection
Sunday, a little of the No. 1 seed lus
ter has worn off for Stanford. Car
dinal fans, getting down to the busi
ness of filling out their tournament
picks, are slowly coming to the same
realization.
1 he South Region is tough. And
deep. And loaded with teams that
could upend Sum ford on the road
to Indianapolis.
| No less than a half-dozen teams
in Birmingham and Nashville
could pull a Gonzaga and send
Stanford home early. Particularly
troublesome are Tennessee, Con
necticut and Ohio State, quick
scjuads with great athletes who sus
piciously resemble Arizona and
UCIA (the two teams to beat the
Cardinal this year).
; Stanford won't play them all, of
course. All the Cardnal has to do is
win four games in two weeks to
ei(rn a ticket to the RCA Dome and
college basketball's greatest specta
cle.
In case you've been t(K) busy
wjtli finals to scrutinize the entire
bracket, from Cincinatti to South

Carolina State, here's a breakdown
of the 11 teams most likely to stand
between Stanford and the Final
Four (the other top 10 seeds in the
region, and Stanford's first-round
opponent South Carolina State),
complete with reasons why they will
or won't derail the Cardinal.
No. 2 Cincinnati
Record: 28-3
Why they'll beat Stanford: Even
without Kenyon Martin, this is one
of the most talented teams in the
nation. Fete Mickael and Dermarr
Johnson can shoot very well from
the outside, and the Bearcats play a
tenacious defense. They have the
athletes to out-quick the Cardinal.
Why they won't: Stanford will own
the paint. If Martin was still in ac
tion, the seeds would probably be
reversed, and this would be one of
the marquee games of the tourna
ment. Without him, Cincy will be
lucky to make the regional final.
No. 3 Ohio State
Record: 22-6
Why they'll beat Stanford: The
combination of Scoonie Penn and
Michael Redd gives the Buckeyes
perhaps the best backcourt in the
nation. Alter reaching the Final
Four last year, Ohio State could've
earned a top-seed this year except
for an upset loss to Penn State in
the Big 10 Tournament. II
Scoonie's on, he's almost impossi
ble to stop.
Why they won't: While Penn and
Redd are formidable, the Buckeyes
are weak inside. Shot-bloc king cen
ter Ken Johnson has the ability to
completely vanish from the game
at any time. And if Penn, who shot
2-for-14 on three-pointers and
turned the ball over seven times
against Penn State, continues play
ing so poorly, they'll be lucky to get
to Austin.
No. 4 Tennessee
Record: 24-6
Why they'll beat Stanford: Ten
nessee is exactly the type of team
that gives the Cardinal fits — quick
guards, pressure defense, guys
who can heat up from three-point
range. A lot of people thought the
Volunteers would have been a top
seed if they had won the SEC Tour
nament.
Why they won't: Disciplined teams
(see: Vaderbilt) have hurt Ten
nessee all year. The Volunteers fell
out of the tourney early last season,
and they've got a war on their
hands with Connecticut in the sec
ond round.
No. 5 Connecticut
Record: 24-9
Why they'll beat Stanford: This is
easy — a 76-56 blowout two years
ago in Storrs, Conn., and last year's
70-59 letdown at Maples Pavilion.
11 Khalid El-Amin plays like he did
when UConn won the National
(lhampionship a year ago and Jake
Voskuhl stops whining long
enough to grab a rebound, the
team could make a lot of noise,
even without Richard Hamilton,
the 1999 Final Four MVP. Re
member, when the Huskies beat
Stanford 79-50 last year, Hamilton
was injured, sitting on the bench
wearing a suit and a smile.
Why they won't: Though Con
necticut opened the season ranked
No. 1, it di'dn't stay there long, los
ing to lowa in its first game. Since
then, it's just been more of the
same. Without Hamilton and de
fensive master Ricky Moore, Jim
Calhoun's charges have been mad
deningly inconsistent. Stanford has
seen the Huskies before and, de
spite recent losses, is more athletic
than in the past two years.
No. 6 Miami
Record: 21-10
Why they'll beat Stanford: The
Hurricanes are big and physical,
boast one of the nation's top players
in Johnny Helmsey and ran
through the Big East season with
fury.
Why they won't: Miami blew a
chance to kiuxk St. John's out of
the Big East Tournament by miss
ing a critical free throw with sec
onds left. This team is dangerous,
but it won't win in the clutch.
No. 7 Tulsa
Record: 29-4
Why they'll beat Stanford: 1 his is a
darkhorse team that nearly
cracked the Top 10 earlier this sea
son. Bill Self, whose name keeps

popping up in high-profile coach
ing searches, will have his team
ready to go.
Why they won't: Tulsa lost three
times this year to Fresno State. The
Bulldogs were a bubble team that
barely earned a No. 9 seed in the
tournament.
No. 8 North Carolina
Record: 18-13
Why they'll beat Stanford: The
Tar Heels have one of the best
point guards in the nation in Ed
Cota and the country's best per
centage shooter in Brendan Hay
wood. They are an athletic team
that hung with Duke earlier this
year.
Why they won't: North Carolina
has underachieved all year and lost
to Wake Forest in the first round of
the ACC Tournament. There's no
reason to think head coach Bill
Guthridge can turn his ship
around in time. UNC will have its
hands lull just trying to beat Mis
souri and head coach Quin Snyder,
an old nemesis from his playing
days at Duke.
No. 9 Missouri
Record: 18-12
Why they'll beat Stanford: Quick
guards, a good coach and Kareem
Rush, brother of UCLA upset hero
Jaßon Rush.
Why they won't: Missouri started
hot but faded fast and didn't prove
it could compete with the elite
teams of the Big 12. A disciplined
Stanford attack should tear the
Tigers apart.
No. 10UNLV
Record: 23-7
Why they'll beat Stanford: The
Runnin' Rebels can score, score,
score. This is a team that loves to
run, and if it can control the tempo
against Stanford, UNLV could win
a 100-99 game.
Why they won't: Stanford can de
fend, defend, defend. UNLV
hasn't beaten a quality non-confer
ence opponent all season. (And,
let's be honest, UNLV was lucky to
get a berth in the tournament. Un
less they've got bookies fixing
games, they're not going far.)
No. 11 Arkansas
Record: 19-14
Why«they'll beat Stanford: N«tow*
Richardson's patented 40 minutes
of hell defense could cause major
problems for Stanford. An amazing
trip through the SEC Tournament
shows the Razorbacks can play and,
if they go so far as to reach the Car
dinal, you know they're on a seri
ous roll.
Why they won't: Arkansas is so live
years ago. Since the Razorbacks lost
to UCLA in the 1995 NCAA title
game, they have been little more
than novelties on the main stage.
And, there's some lessons to be
learned from that game. Against an
Arkansas team that played harder
and more frenzied than today's,
backup point guard Cameron Dol
lar calmly led the Bruins to the
championship. If he plays as smart
as Dollar did, Mike McDonald will
cruise through this year's version
with no problem.
No. 16 South Carolina State
Record: 20-13
Why they'll beat Stanford:
Why they won't: A No. 1 6 seed has
never beaten a No. 1 seed in the
men's tournament. Don't expect
history to be made anvtime soon.
