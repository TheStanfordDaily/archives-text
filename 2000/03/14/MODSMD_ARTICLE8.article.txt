# Final Four berths: its anyone's guess
## 
### JONATHAN STULL JIM TANKERSLEY EDITORIAL STAFF 
Ladies and gentlemen, start
your brackets.
In a year of parity for men's col
lege basketball, in a week when un
derdogs upset half of the nation's
top 10 teams and the No. 1 team
lost the country's No. 1 player, the
NCAA announced Sunday the
pairings for what figures to be one
of its wildest tournaments in a
decade.
II the last seven days taught
hoops fans anything, it is this: noth
ing is a given in this year's Big
Dance. Anyone could lose in the
first two rounds. More than half the
field has at least a small shot of
reaching the Final Four. And a
good dozen teams could fly home
from Indianapolis with the nation
al title.
Just like last year, Duke enters
the tournament as the to}) team in
both the final AP and ESPN/USA
Today polls, but the Blue Devils are
hardly a head-and-shoulders fa
vorite this time around. They sim
ply managed to put together a solid
season in a weak league (a strange
but true description of the ACC this
year) and avoided losing in their
conference tournament.
Not to knock Duke or the phe
nominal coaching job Mike

Krzyzewski has pulled ofi this year,
hut a Blue Devil title would shock
the basketball world. Duke has the
talent and poise to make the Final
Four, but Coach K's team owns a
dismal record against Rl'l Fop 25
competition.
Before losing Kenyon Martin
for the year to an ankle injury,
Cincinnati would have been a pop
ular pick to win it all. Now, most ob
servers peg the Bearcats to drop
out in , the second round, where
they have lost thrie years running.
Like a Monet painting, the rest
of the field of favorities grows blur
rier the closer you get toil. Arizona,
Stanford, Michigan State, LSU,
Kentucky, lowa State, Ohio State,
Tennessee, Florida, Temple, Con
necticut and Syracuse all have the
firepower to win a title. And each
has demonstrated in the past two
weeks that it might stumble before
the Sweet IF).
Hundreds of experts nation
wide have sorted through the rub
ble of this regular season and pro
claimed their favorites to ascend to
the throne. What makes the NCAA
Tournament great is that those
guys are right about as often as that
kid down the hall who spent the
quarter locked in his room with
Chem problem sets, emerging just
in time to (ill out a bracket and toss his $3 into the dorm
pool.
If you're tired of losing to that kid, and to the one
next door who picks based on uniform color, this could
be your year. And if you're looking tor a little help, here
are some tourney tips, in convenient groups of four.
Four Best Shots to Reach the Final Four —
Michigan State: Matten Cleaves is a great point
guard and with wing players like Morris Peterson and
Charlie Bell, life is good.
Stanford: With better ball-handling and increased
consistency, the Cardinal's depth and outside shooting
will go far.
Louisiana State: Stromile Swift and Jabari Smith are
so good LSU head coach John Brady has off-duty cops
trailing them to ward off any ill-timed contacts with
agents. For real.
Temple: With Pepe Sanchez back running the
team, head coach John Chaney has his best chance to
go to his first Final Four.
Four Most Dangerous Teams —
UCLA: Now that Jaßon Rush has returned from
NCAA purgatory, the Bruins have the talent to match
up with anyone. If they had any consistency, they could
be playing in Indianapolis.
Tulsa: The Golden Hurricane started the season
20-1, has been rated in the top 25 for weeks but still
got shafted with a No. 7 seed. A win against Cincin
nati in the second round would make a big impres
sion.
Fresno State: Senior shooting guard Courtney
Alexander will be an NBA star. If he's hot, watch out
Arizona, because Tark the Shark is coming through.
DePaul: Quentin Richardson and the rest of this
born-and-bred Chicago team have a ton of talent. They
almost beat Duke in Durham. This time they could do
it in Winston-Salem.
Four Most Vulnerable Teams —
lowa State: This year's Auburn. Though Marcus
Fizer is fantastic and the Cyclones have stormed
through the Big 12, a lack of tournament experi
ence portends bad things with such high expecta
tions.

Cincinnati: Without probable National Player of the
Year Kenyon Martin, Bob Huggins' team could go
down in the second round for the third straight season.
Arizona: The Wildcats could've also been in our
Four Best Shots category. But without any depth, they
are always vulnerable.
Duke: The Blue Devils are very good but a second
round matchup with either Kansas or DePaul makes
this a scary team to bet on.
Four Final Fours We'd Like to See —
•All-Perseverance: Auburn, Cincinnati, Arizona,
Oregon
If Auburn, Cincinnati and Arizona all make it to to
the Final Four, it will be a story of biblical proportions.
Arizona had three players transfer before the season
began and had two starters go down with injury for ex
tended lengths of time while starting two freshmen and
three sophomores. Making the Final Four without
Loren Woods would be monumental.
The same could be said for Cincinnati without
Kenyon Martin. Martin controlled the game on both
ends of the court like no other player. Though Bob
Huggins is not a favorite, rooting for the Bearcats with
out Martin is easy.
Auburn's Chris Porter is no Kenyon Martin, but his
season-ending NCAA suspension will hurt. The Tigers
made the SEC Tournament final, why not the NCA4
final?
Oregon has no amazing story to spread. But if the
seventh-seeded Ducks, who won the first NCAA Tour
nament in 1939, reach the Final Four, that would be a
story itself.
•All-Underachieving-Perennial-Powers: UCLA,
North Carolina, Indiana State, Kansas
Ok, Indiana State is no power, not even in the tiny
Missouri Valley Conference, rhey had two good years
with Larry Bird and dropped off the face of the map.
But there's no perennial powers seeded lowly in the
West, so suck it up.
UCLA, North Carolina and Kansas, however are,
along with Kentucky and Duke, the premier programs
in college basketball. Still, after dissapointing seasons
from all three, none earned a seed higher than six; If
these four make it to the Final Four, all will be forgiv
en.
•All-Mascot: St. Louis (Billikens) Louisiana-
Lafayette (Ragin' Cajuns), Purdue (Boilermakers),
Hofstra (Flying Dutchmen)
The names say it all

ends of the court like no other player. Though Bob
Huggins is not a favorite, rooting for the Bearcats with
out Martin is easy.
Auburn's Chris Porter is no Kenyon Martin, but his
season-ending NCAA suspension will hurt. The Tigers
made the SEC Tournament final, why not the NCA4
final?
Oregon has no amazing story to spread. But if the
seventh-seeded Ducks, who won the first NCAA Tour
nament in 1939, reach the Final Four, that would be a
story itself.
•All-Underachieving-Perennial-Powers: UCLA,
North Carolina, Indiana State, Kansas
Ok, Indiana State is no power, not even in the tiny
Missouri Valley Conference, rhey had two good years
with Larry Bird and dropped off the face of the map.
But there's no perennial powers seeded lowly in the
West, so suck it up.
UCLA, North Carolina and Kansas, however are,
along with Kentucky and Duke, the premier programs
in college basketball. Still, after dissapointing seasons
from all three, none earned a seed higher than six; If

Ladies and gentlemen, start
your brackets.
In a year of parity for men's col
lege basketball, in a week when un
derdogs upset half of the nation's
top 10 teams and the No. 1 team
lost the country's No. 1 player, the
NCAA announced Sunday the
pairings for what figures to be one
of its wildest tournaments in a
decade.
II the last seven days taught
hoops fans anything, it is this: noth
ing is a given in this year's Big
Dance. Anyone could lose in the
first two rounds. More than half the
field has at least a small shot of
reaching the Final Four. And a
good dozen teams could fly home
from Indianapolis with the nation
al title.
Just like last year, Duke enters
the tournament as the to}) team in
both the final AP and ESPN/USA
Today polls, but the Blue Devils are
hardly a head-and-shoulders fa
vorite this time around. They sim
ply managed to put together a solid
season in a weak league (a strange
but true description of the ACC this
year) and avoided losing in their
conference tournament.
Not to knock Duke or the phe
nominal coaching job Mike

Krzyzewski has pulled ofi this year,
hut a Blue Devil title would shock
the basketball world. Duke has the
talent and poise to make the Final
Four, but Coach K's team owns a
dismal record against Rl'l Fop 25
competition.
Before losing Kenyon Martin
for the year to an ankle injury,
Cincinnati would have been a pop
ular pick to win it all. Now, most ob
servers peg the Bearcats to drop
out in , the second round, where
they have lost thrie years running.
Like a Monet painting, the rest
of the field of favorities grows blur
rier the closer you get toil. Arizona,
Stanford, Michigan State, LSU,
Kentucky, lowa State, Ohio State,
Tennessee, Florida, Temple, Con
necticut and Syracuse all have the
firepower to win a title. And each
has demonstrated in the past two
weeks that it might stumble before
the Sweet IF).
Hundreds of experts nation
wide have sorted through the rub
ble of this regular season and pro
claimed their favorites to ascend to
the throne. What makes the NCAA
Tournament great is that those
guys are right about as often as that
kid down the hall who spent the
quarter locked in his room with
Chem problem sets, emerging just
in time to (ill out a bracket and toss his $3 into the dorm
pool.
If you're tired of losing to that kid, and to the one
next door who picks based on uniform color, this could
be your year. And if you're looking tor a little help, here
are some tourney tips, in convenient groups of four.
Four Best Shots to Reach the Final Four —
Michigan State: Matten Cleaves is a great point
guard and with wing players like Morris Peterson and
Charlie Bell, life is good.
Stanford: With better ball-handling and increased
consistency, the Cardinal's depth and outside shooting
will go far.
Louisiana State: Stromile Swift and Jabari Smith are
so good LSU head coach John Brady has off-duty cops
trailing them to ward off any ill-timed contacts with
agents. For real.
Temple: With Pepe Sanchez back running the
team, head coach John Chaney has his best chance to
go to his first Final Four.
Four Most Dangerous Teams —
UCLA: Now that Jaßon Rush has returned from
NCAA purgatory, the Bruins have the talent to match
up with anyone. If they had any consistency, they could
be playing in Indianapolis.
Tulsa: The Golden Hurricane started the season
20-1, has been rated in the top 25 for weeks but still
got shafted with a No. 7 seed. A win against Cincin
nati in the second round would make a big impres
sion.
Fresno State: Senior shooting guard Courtney
Alexander will be an NBA star. If he's hot, watch out
Arizona, because Tark the Shark is coming through.
DePaul: Quentin Richardson and the rest of this
born-and-bred Chicago team have a ton of talent. They
almost beat Duke in Durham. This time they could do
it in Winston-Salem.
Four Most Vulnerable Teams —
lowa State: This year's Auburn. Though Marcus
Fizer is fantastic and the Cyclones have stormed
through the Big 12, a lack of tournament experi
ence portends bad things with such high expecta
tions.

Cincinnati: Without probable National Player of the
Year Kenyon Martin, Bob Huggins' team could go
down in the second round for the third straight season.
Arizona: The Wildcats could've also been in our
Four Best Shots category. But without any depth, they
are always vulnerable.
Duke: The Blue Devils are very good but a second
round matchup with either Kansas or DePaul makes
this a scary team to bet on.
Four Final Fours We'd Like to See —
•All-Perseverance: Auburn, Cincinnati, Arizona,
Oregon
If Auburn, Cincinnati and Arizona all make it to to
the Final Four, it will be a story of biblical proportions.
Arizona had three players transfer before the season
began and had two starters go down with injury for ex
tended lengths of time while starting two freshmen and
three sophomores. Making the Final Four without
Loren Woods would be monumental.
The same could be said for Cincinnati without
Kenyon Martin. Martin controlled the game on both
ends of the court like no other player. Though Bob
Huggins is not a favorite, rooting for the Bearcats with
out Martin is easy.
Auburn's Chris Porter is no Kenyon Martin, but his
season-ending NCAA suspension will hurt. The Tigers
made the SEC Tournament final, why not the NCA4
final?
Oregon has no amazing story to spread. But if the
seventh-seeded Ducks, who won the first NCAA Tour
nament in 1939, reach the Final Four, that would be a
story itself.
