Ladies and gentlemen, start
your brackets.
In a year of parity for men's col
lege basketball, in a week when un
derdogs upset half of the nation's
top 10 teams and the No. 1 team
lost the country's No. 1 player, the
NCAA announced Sunday the
pairings for what figures to be one
of its wildest tournaments in a
decade.
II the last seven days taught
hoops fans anything, it is this: noth
ing is a given in this year's Big
Dance. Anyone could lose in the
first two rounds. More than half the
field has at least a small shot of
reaching the Final Four. And a
good dozen teams could fly home
from Indianapolis with the nation
al title.
Just like last year, Duke enters
the tournament as the to}) team in
both the final AP and ESPN/USA
Today polls, but the Blue Devils are
hardly a head-and-shoulders fa

out in , the second round, where
they have lost thrie years running.
Like a Monet painting, the rest
of the field of favorities grows blur
rier the closer you get toil. Arizona,
Stanford, Michigan State, LSU,
Kentucky, lowa State, Ohio State,
Tennessee, Florida, Temple, Con
necticut and Syracuse all have the
firepower to win a title. And each
has demonstrated in the past two
weeks that it might stumble before
the Sweet IF).
Hundreds of experts nation
wide have sorted through the rub
ble of this regular season and pro
claimed their favorites to ascend to
the throne. What makes the NCAA
Tournament great is that those
guys are right about as often as that
kid down the hall who spent the
quarter locked in his room with
Chem problem sets, emerging just
