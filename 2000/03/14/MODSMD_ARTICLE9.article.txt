# Stanford's lineage of leaders
## Mike Montgomery builds a tradition of point guards for the Cardinal men 
### JIM TANKERSLEY EDITORIAL STAFF 
The tale of Stanford's point
guard legacy begins, like many
good California stories, with an
easterner l(x>king to make a name
for himself out West.
It is not a long story, dating back
just seven years to the arrival of that
unknown easterner. But it has
some great characters, heroes of the
Stanford basketball program whose
rise to national prominence has
mirrored that of the school's men's
basketball program.
In order of appearance:
Brevin Knight, the man from
New Jersey who didn't get a second
look from all but a handful of Divi
sion I schools, the rewriter of Cardi
nal record books who led Stanford
to its first NCAA Tournament win
in more than 50 years.
Arthur Lee, King Arthur, whose
last-minute scoring barrage — and
the greatest steal in Stanford histo
ry — against Rhode Island carried
the Cardinal to the Final Four.
Junior Michael McDonald, the
current main man, who doesn't pile
up points or zip Sports Center-wo
rthy behind-the-back passes or do
anything else but quietly lead the
1999-2000 Stanford team to the
school's best-ever record and a No.
I seed in the tournament.
Sophomore Tony Giovacchini, a
solid backup who gains confidence
with each game, and athletic fan-fa
vorite freshman Julius Barnes, her
alded as the next great one.
The first two cast members dis
tinguished themselves with postsea
son heroics. The next pair in line,
McDonald and Giovacchini, will
have a chance to write their own
chapters to the story with strong
performances in this year's NCAA
Tournament, which Stanford be
gins Friday against South Carolina
State in Birmingham, Ala.
l op-flight point guards abound
in the 2000 tournament, particular
ly in the South Region, where Sum
ford is the top seed. Fifth-seeded
Connecticut's KhalidhLW\jiiiu k ..No,
4 Tennessee's Tony Harris and No.
3 Ohio State's Scoonie Penn are all
solid NBA prospects, and the Car
dinal could face another pro-bound
player, No. 8 North Carolina's Ed
Cota, in the second round.
The pressure will be on McDon
ald, probably the least-known Stan
find starter on the national scene,
and (iiovacc hini to neutralize those
players on defense while keeping
the Cardinal in its offensive rhythm.
But unlike in past tournaments,
Stanford's point guards won't have
to shoulder a big scoring load to
win. They can focus on what they
do best: directing the half-court of
fense to free up good shots for the
Cardinal's post players inside and
wings outside.
"In past years," McDonald said,
"we didn't have the offensive
weapons we have this year. But this
year, we have six guys, myself not

included, who could average 15
points a game. That's fine with me.
I'll do anything to win."
A 'point guard school'
Scoring point guards fueled Stan
ford's climb up the ladder of na
tional contention in the last seven
years. Long a women's hoops pow
erhouse, the school hired Mike
Montgomery 14 years ago and
watched him slowly mold the men's
program, over the course of a
decade, into one of the country's
best.
If Stanford wasn't a "basketball
school" on the men's side when
Montgomery took over, it certainly
wasn't a point guard school. Point
guards went to Michigan Suite or
Duke or Arizona — schools with a
point guard tradition that Stanford
just didn't have.
Brevin changed all that.
Montgomery's early stars were a
shooting guard (Todd Lichti) and a
power forward (Adam Keefe). His
first phenom, the guy who graced
the highlight reels and made
spoitscasters say "hey, you might
want to check out this Stanford
team," was Knight.
By the time he finished his last
game in a Cardinal uniform (a 29-
point overtime performance
against Utah in the Sweet Sixteen,
more than half of which he played
with four fouls), Knight was an Ail-
American and the school's leader in
assists and steals. Cardinal fans
spent the summer of 1997 debating
whether his graduation was the
death of the Stanford hcxips revival.
King Arthur answered them by
taking the team where Knight
couldn't — past the Sweet Sixteen
and into the Final Four. The next
year, he led the team to its first Pa
cific 10 Conference title.
How far did those two men
bring the Stanford program? In the
middle of Lee's senior season last
year, Rowland High School star
Julius Barnes, a 6-foot-1 guard who
dunks with ease and averaged 25
points a game as a prep, was shop
ping for ~ i,Mi.ni *«
Arizona bead coach Lute Olson
was looking for a point guard to re
place senior Jason Terry, and he
had narrowed his choices to Barnes
and Jason Gardner of Indianapolis.
Whoever commits to Arizona first,
Olson said, walks into a starting job
next year.
Barnes picked Stanford. And
though the school's educational op
portunities drew him to the Farm,
Barnes said he wouldn't have con
sidered the Cardinal if Mont
gomery hadn't proven he could
nurture good floor leaders.
"Coach has done a great job with
the point guards he's had," Barnes
said. "If there hadn't been the lin
eage that there is, I probably would
have committed to Arizona."
Waiting their turn
At times, that decision has
brought Barnes a pile of frustra

tion. He looks at Arizona and sees
what might have been.
Gardner accepted Olson's offer
and plays close to 40 minutes a
game for the Wildcats. He runs a
wide-open offense and made the
All-Pac-10 team as a freshman.
Barnes plays third fiddle at the
point to McDonald and Giovacchi
ni, and didn't log a minute when
the teams met last week in Tucson.
Fhe waiting puts Barnes in good
company, because Montgomery's
.offense * c<fuires so much of a point
guard.
"You have to know where every
one is," McDonald said. "1 think it's
definitely the hardest position" at
Stanford.
As a result, younger point
guards usually ride the bench for a
season or two before the coach
hands them the reins. Lee backed
up Knight for two years. Ditto for
McDonald (behind Lee) and Gio
vacchini (behind Lee and McDon
ald).
In practice and watching from
the bench, tfie young guards learn
the ins and outs of the (Cardinal ol
fense. But it takes game time for
them to gain the most important of
point guard attributes: confidence.
Giovacchini is a perfect example.
Tentative last year and early this
season, he has blossomed with in
creased floor time and played c ru
cial minutes last week against \i i

zona and Arizona State.
"I think that a big part of the
progress I've made all year," he
said, "is just to be confident out on
the floor."
Just as importantly, the point
guards have earned the faith of
their teammates.
"I think it all starts with Mike Mc-
Donald," senior forward Mark
Madsen said. "I think he's the team
MVP. I le tries to make other guys
better .... Some guys just scream
at you if you mess up. He maks a
point of getting you right back into
it."
Where it will end, this year, may
largely rest with McDonald as well.
Knight won in the tournament, Lee
went to the Final Four.
Now McDonald gets his first
crack at what they couldn't do: win
ning it all.
The story of the point guard
legacy doesn't figure to end any
time soon. Barnes, along with a
strong, fast supporting cast includ
ing Casey Jacobsen, Curtis Bor
chart and Justin Davis, could usher
in a new era of Stanford point
guards.
II nothing else, Barnes should
rock the Maples Pavilion faithful.
"1 was always told In my dad and
my mom." Barnes said, "to leave
the crowd with something to re
member."
Brevin Knight would be proud.
