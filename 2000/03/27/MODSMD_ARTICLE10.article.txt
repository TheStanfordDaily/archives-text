# Challenges abound for student publications
## Student-run journals and magazines address diverse audiences 
### ANNE CORTINA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For those with an interest in academic writing,
creative expression or the like, a host of Stanford
publications cater to such reader and authors.
Starting a publication requires a lot of capital
most students don't have lying around their
dorm room.
ASSU Vice President John Mills, a fourth year
doctoral student in genetics, is also the interim di
rector of the ASSU Publications Board. He
stresses that if students are interested enough, the
money is there for them.
"The most important element to starting a stu
dent publication is amassing a group of dedicat
ed students who are willing to devote the time, ef
fort and talent required to pi (xluce a quality pub
lication that students will want to read again,"
Mills said. "ASSU Publications can provide stu
dents with funding, facilities, and technical ex
pertise and advice to get their publication started
off"on the right f<x>t."
Funding is also available from other
sources. The Mind's Eye, a creative expression
magazine, receives money from The Stanford
Fund and the English and Art Departments as
well as a special fee, while the Journal of Inter

national Relations gets funding from the Insti
tute for International Studies, the Provost's Of
fice, and the Humanities and Social Sciences
Board in the IK program. Herodotus, the His
tory Department's student-run journal, is sup
ported by the Mark F. Brand fund in the de
partment.
Hie ASSU Publications Board also supports
magazines and journals through special fees, and
helps get new ones off the ground.
Beyond building a staff , money is the next im
portant issue considering that publishing even a
small magazine is expensive.
The cost varies based on the format and qual
ity of materials used. The Mind's Eye plans to
publish 2,800 copies of each of its two issues next
year for around $16,000, according to editor
Maggie Lange, a junior. I lerodotus.on the other
hand, spends about $1,500 to publish 1,000
copies a year.
Different publications have different success
with getting submissions. The Mind's Eye often
has plenty of stories, poetry and art to choose
from.
"We certainly get enough submissions for
each issue," said Lange.
Some of the smaller journals have trouble
finding submissions. Often, people may not
know about a particular journal or may not
know how to submit. The Journal of Interna
tional Relations and Herodotus are both look
ing for submissions for their next issue.
The Journal of International Relations has

developed ways of getting materials for publica
tion even if students don't submit.
"We solicit professors specifically," says Jus
tine Fisher, sophomore and managing editor
for the spring issue. "We also receive articles
written by outside sources, and we conduct in
terviews with Stanford professors and relevant
people off-campus."
The number of submissions reflects on the
leadership. While magazines such as The
Mind's Eye cater to a broad audience, distribut
ing copies in dorms, at the Coffee House and in
the English Department, the Journal of Inter
national Relations and Herodotus are distrib
uted more within the departments they are a
part of .
Senior Will Shearin, editor of Herodotus,
finds an overwhelmingly positive response from
readers.
"From those who know of the journal ... I
have received nothing but support," he said.
"Maybe this is because these people are all bi
ased towards the aims of an undergraduate his
tory journal anyway; nonetheless, the response
has always been positive."
While it may seem that the need to procure
funding and submissions makes publishing a
small journal difficult, Mills said that it is more
than possible, as long as the students are happy
and involved.
"In order to keep a publication running," he
said. "Recruitment and retention of student
members has to be the top priority."
