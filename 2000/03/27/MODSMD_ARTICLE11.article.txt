# Stanford researchers link brain region to reading problems in adults and children
## Fatty tissue important to information processing, reading comprehension 
### MEENA MALLIPEDDI 
A recent study by Stanford researchers
showed for the first time that reading diffi
culties in adults can be traced to physiolog
ical abnormalities in the brain.
In the study, published in the February
issue of the journal "Neuron," researchers
compared the brains of adults classified as
good readers with those who had difficul
ties reading as children and who still strug

gle with reading today.
Using a new technique called Diffusion
Tensor Imaging, researchers found differ
ences in the amount of white matter located
in the posterior region of the subjects'
brains.
This is the part of the brain where the
temporal lobe, which processes auditory in
formation, and the parietal lobe, which
processes visual information, meet. To
gether, these lobes control the key parts of
the brain a person uses to read.
The study's senior researcher, Psycholo
gy Assoc. Prof. John Gabrieli, said the
lower level of white matter in this area in
people with difficulties reading suggests
that "part of the reason people have differ
ent reading abilities is that the myelin

around axons, or possibly the axons them
selves, are not as efficiently organized in
some people as in others."
The white matter of a person's brain is
made up of myelin, a fatty substance that
coats each axon of each nerve cell in the
brain. This coating of myelin helps infor
mation in the brain travel long distances
faster and makes the brain a more efficient
information processor. When this myelin is
lacking, people apparently have a harder
time processing what they read.
The study also found that subjects with
higher myelin levels had higher standard
ized reading scores. This shows that the more
myelin a person has, the better reader he is.
However, (iabrieli said, "It's
still unclear whether the higher
myelin levels are the product or
the cause of the reading. We
don't know il the levels are
caused by genetics or by educa
tion." Further study is needed to
determine if people read more
because they have more myelin
or if thev have more myelin be

cause the) read more.
I he pin pose of this study was
to understand the difference in
the brains of people with differ
ent reading abilities, (iabrieli
said, "We wanted to understand
why certain people have difficul
ty reading and others don't."
I his is a problem that affects
many people today. According
to (iabrieli, "five to 10 percent of
all children in the United States
have difficulty reading."
Willi the knowledge gained in
this study, (iabrieli hopes that
preventive measures can be

taken to help these children. In
stead of learning about their
reading problems through pro
longed failure, he hopes that
children can soon be tested to see
it they are at risk for developing
reading difficulties before the
problem actually hits.
Next, researchers will try to
confirm their results with 10 year
olds to see if their previous find
ings on myelin are supported. If
they do, researchers can proceed
with developing some kind of di
agnostic test for kindergarten
age children.
