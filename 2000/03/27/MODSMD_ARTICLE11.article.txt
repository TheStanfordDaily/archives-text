# Stanford researchers link brain region to reading problems in adults and children
## Fatty tissue important to information processing, reading comprehension

A recent study by Stanford researchers
showed for the first time that reading diffi
culties in adults can be traced to physiolog
ical abnormalities in the brain.
In the study, published in the February
issue of the journal "Neuron," researchers
compared the brains of adults classified as
good readers with those who had difficul
ties reading as children and who still strug

gle with reading today.
Using a new technique called Diffusion
Tensor Imaging, researchers found differ
ences in the amount of white matter located
in the posterior region of the subjects'
brains.
This is the part of the brain where the
temporal lobe, which processes auditory in
formation, and the parietal lobe, which
processes visual information, meet. To
gether, these lobes control the key parts of
the brain a person uses to read.
The study's senior researcher, Psycholo
gy Assoc. Prof. John Gabrieli, said the
lower level of white matter in this area in
people with difficulties reading suggests
that "part of the reason people have differ
ent reading abilities is that the myelin

around axons, or possibly the axons them
selves, are not as efficiently organized in
some people as in others."
The white matter of a person's brain is
made up of myelin, a fatty substance that
coats each axon of each nerve cell in the
brain. This coating of myelin helps infor
mation in the brain travel long distances
faster and makes the brain a more efficient
information processor. When this myelin is
lacking, people apparently have a harder
time processing what they read.
The study also found that subjects with
higher myelin levels had higher standard
ized reading scores. This shows that the more
myelin a person has, the better reader he is.
