## 
### MARK BOUCHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Palo Alto Mayor Liz Kniss suggested that
the city consider opening Foothills Park to
Stanford students and faculty members in
her recent State of the City address. She also
proposed that Stanford consider increasing
Palo Alto residents' access to Stanford li
braries.
"We can get veiy caught up in current
policies," said Kniss. "We are thinking 'out
of the box' [with these suggestions]
These are [not yet] specific policies."

She called Stanford and Palo Alto "won
derful neighbors.
"We shouldn't be at odds with each
other. We should be sharing resources," she
said in the Feb. 28 speech.
Foothills Park is located on Page Mill
Road near Los Altos Hills, directly adjacent
to Stanford land. Although anyone can hike
on the park property, its interpretive center
and lake are open only to Palo Alto resi
dents. In addition, only residents have auto
mobile access to the park.
Acct>rding to Kniss, the park is "very frag
ile," and Palo Alto residents are concerned

about the "ecological trauma" that might re
sult from usage by Stanford students and
faculty.
The park costs the city $800,000 per year
to maintain. Kniss said that residents were
concerned that increased usage might raise
these costs or force the park to temporarily
close because of damage.
"Maybe there's some kind of monitoring
system [that could I*' installed] so that it's not
as overused," she said.
Morton, the University's director
of Covernment and Community Relations,
said that "perhaps Foothills Park should be

opened because Palo Alto residents can use
the Dish.
"Access to Foothills Park is something for
Palo Alto to consider. Some Stanford resi
dents would appreciate it."
Palo Alto has already discussed opening
Foothills Park to Stanford community
members. The city council voted against al
lowing access in 1991 in a debate that Kniss
called "polarizing" and included the "threat
of lawsuits.
" The idea is to get away from that [acri
mony]," she said. "Let's look at this [idea]
diflerendy.... Overall, it's not an easy

problem."
According to Kniss, the Palo Alto City
Council will have to debate this issue before
any specific proposals could be enacted; She
said that two or three council members
would have to advance the issue as an agen
da item before official discussion' could
begin.
"No one has called [yet] to express enor
mous interest [in the issue]," she said.-She
predicted that the council will begin to dis
cuss it sometime in the next two or three
months.
In her address, Kniss also raised
the issue of community access to
Stanford libraries. Currently, Palo
Alio residents and am otbei visitors
can use Stanford libraries free lor
seven clavs pei academic yeai but
may not borrow books.
Visitors can also pure base diffei -
cut levels • il ac cess privileges l< >i vai i
ous lengths of lime. I lie privilege ol
borrowing books from the libraries

costs Sr>()() |>er year, for example.
Kniss called this policy one of
"very limited acc ess.
"We're [hoping for] more access,
but not complete access," she said.
She emphasized that she thought
students from (.111111 High School
and I'alo Alto High School should
base more ac cess to the libraries, in
addition to the city's residents.
According to Karen Nagy, the
deputy I niversit) librarian, the vast
majoritv ol visitors to the library
who use ilieii privileges use them
only one or two times.
Nag\ said ili.it some I'alo Alto

residents may not realize they have
the privilege of using Stanford Li
braries.
"I'he Palo Alto public libraries
are very good for most [people's
needs]," she said.
"Stanford must give priority to
supporting educational research,"
said Morion. "T hat is the highest
priority." lie called the current pol
icy of seven days of free access to the
public "generous."
According to Nagy, "we ac
knowledge that we have resources
that are unique in the area and we
want to share these."
