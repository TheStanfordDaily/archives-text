## Outright victory doubtful for Russia's acting president 
### 
MOSCOW (AF) — Vladimir Putin may fall short
of outright victory in Russia's presidential election
and be forced into a runoff after a surprisingly
strong performance by the Communists, according
to early results.
While Putin would almost certainly win a second
round, it would be a humbling setback for the for
mer RGB officer who has become acting president
and the nation's most popular politician with his c alls
to restore Russia as a great power.
With about 47 percent of the vote counted, Putin
for the first time was running above the 50-percent
barrier needed for outright victory with 50.01 of the
vote, election officials said. Communist chief Gen
nady Zyuganov was second with 31 percent, they
said.
Political commentators on Russian television net
works suggested Putin could clear the 50-percent
hurdle, but the outcome would be very close.
The state-RTR television network, citing two exit
polls, projected that Putin would get 51 percent of
the vote, Zyuganov would get 28 percent and liberal
economist Grigory Yavlinsky would be third with 7
percent.
Overall turnout was at 65.8 percent, normal for a
Russian election, according to the Interfax news
agency. A new election would have been necessary
had the turnout of eligible voters not reached 50
percent.
Putin's campaign may have suffered from the
widespread assumption that he would win, convinc
ing many of his supporters that there was no need to
vote. But the fairly strong vote for Zyuganov was also

seen as a protest vote by Russians unhappy about
Putin's apparently inevitable victory.
Putin, looking relaxed, said he was confident of
victory as he voted at a Moscow polling station. He
told reporters he was going to relax at a sauna, say
ing he expected to face many new challenges starting
today.
"Today is Monday, a hard day, and I have to go
to work," he said.
The tough, man-of-action image that Putin culti
vates appeals to many Russians, tired of the uncer
tainty and mayhem of the final years of former Pres
ident Boris Yeltsin. Putin has promised to end mas
sive corruption, revive the economy after years of
recession and restore the political and military influ
ence that Moscow wielded before the Soviet collapse.
"I'm tired of all this disorder," said Vladimir
Prishchev, a pensioner casting his ballot for Putin in
Russia's Pacific port city of Vladivostok, where graft
is rampant and life miserable for most people.
"When Putin takes charge of something, he takes it
to the end."
Some Russians, particularly liberals, fear Putin
may trample Russia's fragile democracy and restore
the iron control the secret police enforced during
the Soviet era.
"He is dangerous. He seems too harsh," said
Anna Polevaya, a 27-year-old architect from
Moscow.
But some Russian reformers and Western officials
and businessmen have praised Putin as a pragmatic
reformer who will restore stability in Russia and
improve people's lives by making reforms work.
