# Pope departs from the Holy Land following a final dramatic gesture
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) â€” Pope John
Paul II crowned his Holy Land sojourn
yesterday with a stunning gesture to the
Jews at their holiest site, shuffling slow
ly up to the Western Wall and placing a
plea for forgiveness in a nook between
its yellowed stones.
The gesture by the 79-year-old ailing
pontiff'wks sure to become the most
indelible image in a week of unforget
table moments.
It came on a whirlwind final day that
saw the pope visit the sacred sites of all
three all within the confines of
Jerusalem's walled Old City, one of the
most disputed patches of land in the
world.
At the .Church of the Holy Sepul
cher, the pontiff knelt at the spot where
tradition says Jesus was resurrected. At
the Haram as-Sharif, the hilltop where
Muslims say the prophet Mohammed
ascended, to heaven, he met with
Jerusalem's top Islamic cleric.
At each stop, he couldn't help but
witness the passionate dispute over a
city, that both Israelis and Palestinians

claim as their capital. But many who
glimpsed him witnessed something
equally potent: the charisma and heal
ing power of this aging, ailing pontiff.
"Some wonderful things are going to
happen in this century," said Bishop
William Murphy of Boston, who fol
lowed the weeklong journey. "And I
tliiilk that this We saw the begin
ning of it."
1 lunched and leaning 011 a cane, the
pontiff showed doubters lie was more
than up to the rigors of an ambitious
and grueling itinerary.
Not only did he uphold his entire
packed schedule, he managed to
squeeze in an impromptu second look
at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher
before flying back to Rome yesterday
evening.
He even hoisted himself up on the
running board of his Chevy Suburban
and waved, drawing cheers from
delighted tourists.
But for Israelis, the highlight of the
day, and indeed the week, was when
the pope navigated the 8b steps it took

him to reach the Western Wall and
place a note in its stones, echoing a
long-standing tradition of generations
of Jewish worshippers.
He had earlier in the week reached
out to |ews at their Holocaust memori
al, Yad Vashem. But this was a gesture
at the holiest site of all Judaism.
The popes' "Words were from an
address lie made earlier this month in
Rome, expressing sorrow over the past
errors of his church.
"God of our fathers, you chose Abra
ham and his descendants to bring your
Name (o the Nations," read the type
written message.
"We are deeply saddened by the
behavior of those who in the course of
history have caused these children of
yours to suffer and, asking your for
giveness, we wish to commit ourselves
to genuine brotherhood with the peo
ple of the Covenant."
After a private prayer, the pope
made a sign of the cross, then momen
tarily placed a trembling hand on the
rocks.
