GENEVA (AP) — President Clinton
and Syrian President Hafez Assad failed
during three hours of face-to-face negoti
ations yesterday to nail down an agree
ment to restart negotiations between
Israel and Syria for a landmark peace
treaty.
'The differences are significant and
important and obviously more work
needs to be done to bridge them," White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
He characterized the meeting between
Clinton and Assad — their first face-to
face summit in six years — as "very use
ful." But at the same time, he said, "We
don't believe it would be productive" for
Syrian-Israeli talks to resume at this point.
"It is impossible to predict when those
talks might resume," he said.
Lockhart said Assad "articulated his
position clearly and forcefully" through
out two businesslike sessions. Clinton
spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak both before and after the Assad
meeting, Lockhart said.
Syrian presidential spokesman jubran
Kourieh said that during the talks Assad

stressed the importance of Syria's long
demand for an Israeli pullback to the
country's 1967 borders.
"Since yesterday nothing earth-shatter
ing happened in the peace process,"
Kourieh said afterward.
The summit discussed pending issues
and the peace process and the "obstacles
that Israel has put up and is still putting
up," Kourieh said. ' 1 "
In Jerusalem, Deputy Defense Minister
Ephraim Sneh said in a telephone inter
view that the main sticking point in Gene
va was Syria's demand for a prior com
mitment to cede the strategic Golan
Heights plateau.
"The fact that Syria insists upon dictat
ing an agreement and not obtaining an
agreed-upon agreement is what made the
resumption of the talks impossible," Sneh
said. "They are quite intransigent about
what they are supposed to give in terms of
security arrangements and they have dif
ferent ideas about normalization."
Clinton left Geneva shortly after the
meeting broke up, leaving Lockhart
behind to speak to reporters.
