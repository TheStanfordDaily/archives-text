## The
						Stanford Daily Stanford must take firm stance on Webb Ranch issue 
### 
Published Since 1891

SINCE THE LATE 1980s, faculty and
students have worked to bring to light
the allegedly unjust treatment of work
ers at Webb Ranch, a berry farm on
Stanford-owned land off of Alpine Road.
Workers at Webb Ranch mostly live in trailors
on the farm, receive no health benefits and are
paid anywhere from minimum wage to $7.33,
the wage received by one worker who has been
at Webb Ranch lot 30 years. Allegations ol
unsafe working and living conditions have also
surfaced in recent years.
Stanford has established that it has no legal
responsibility to take action in response to the
developments at Webb Ranch. Many argue,
however, that the University should show moral
leadership and take a stand. Stanford could
issue a statement encouraging lull disclosure ol
the management's financial documents. It

could put its name and institutional weight
behind the workers.
Stan lord officials contend that any Universi
ty involvement in worker-management rela
tions would be analogous to the University
interfering with worker-management relations
at other commercial entities which operate on
Stan ford-owned land, such as Macy's depart
ment store in the Stanford Shopping Center.
The problem with this claim is that it blurs all
distinctions between the two situations and
selects one commonality (operation on Stanford
land) to justify the position officials have already
decided to take. Perhaps the fear is that if Stan
ford takes a position on the developments at
Webb Ranch, it will suddenly find itself micro
managing practices at Macy's, 1 lewlett-Packard,
etc.
This is extremely unlikely, most of all because

the University likes to pretend it is apolitical,
neither seeing, hearing nor speaking evil. The
institution is too inertial and disinterested in its
non-Internet surroundings to suddenly
become overly-active or interfering. Hie Uni
versity would hardly be committing to a future
of activism by taking a stand on Webb Ranch.
Whether the University should get involved
when there are no legal mandates to do so is a
complicated issue and may strike some as a real
dilemma. The convenient and legal course of
action would l)e to do nothing. The question, is,
though: Can and should we rely on the law to
guide action? The law is primarily a t<x>l for pre
venting coercion or protecting various free
doms. It is rarely a source of inspiration or legit
imation for actions undertaken positively — i.e.
not simply in defense. In other words, we cannot
look to law for guidance on moral questions.

By hiding behind the lack of a legal obliga
tion to respond to the developments at Webb
Ranch, the University sets an incredibly poor
example for students and the wider communi
ty — that we need only concern ourselves with
issues over which we could be sued, that we
should view a very truncated list of lq£*Uy
defined actions as legitimate.
In the context of growing economic inequaV
ity everywhere in the country, most of all in the
Bay Area (arguably one of the more "progres
sive" areas of the country), it is unacceptable to
ignore the striking inequalities around us. The
least the University could do is issue a statement
of support of safe working and living conditions
and living wages for workers on University
owned land. Stanford is mistaken in assuming it
can maintain a "neutral" position, for no such
position exists.
