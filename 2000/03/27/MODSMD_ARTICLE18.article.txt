# FARM LIFE
## Doing nothing 
### 
Okay, so I didn't go to Rosarito,
Cancun, Daytona Beach or
even I*is Vegas. I went home.
One week of me, the television

and nothing. Oh yes,
good sittingnon the smJU
erffNyi n Tra vW 1
Channel and TRL
while occasionally Hip
ping between Comedy
Central and whatever
war feature was on the
History Channel. (That
way I felt I could justify

my mindless watching by learning all
about building the bridge across the
Rhine at Remagen at "the twilight of
World War II;" my polisci profs are so
proud).
I did other productive things 100,
some of which, like my brief watching of
the History Channel, were also quite edu
cational. The movie "Krin Brockovich"
was quite g<K)d; I am now very afraid of
the water-fountain in my dorm and
PG&K is yet another thing I'll chalk back
to my "California Myth" column. I must
say, though, in the words of one cynical
reviewer, Hinkley must be the only town
left in California that hasn't switched to
DaSani and Poland Spring. All the same,
Julia Roberts' outfits were quite good,
making the film in my opinion quite

diverting. Bra-vo!
Now, ilic plan was to really only go
back to my beloved New York (which, by
(he way, when I landed was 35 degrees
and gray) for half the break and then
return tor half a week's skiing in Lake
Tahoe (tough life, I know). However,
halfway through winter quarter, 1 real
ized 1 needed to get away for the full
week, and so changed my air-tickets. The
reason: Chris needed the rejuvenation of
doing absolutely nothing.
Doing nothing is actually a misnomer,
as I'm sure you'll all agree. 1 was doing
"something." That included sleeping a
lot, watching a lot of TV, driving all over
(even New Jersey one day) and chilling
with friends from Before Stanford (read:
high school). I even hiked in the woods
near my house at 10 p.m. â€” something
I'd never done before in my IS years of
lilt- in upstate New York. I visited my old
school, hung out in scenic larrytown
(that's where I'm from for .ill practical
purposes), and went into The (lily
(there's only one, and it ain't San Francis
co) a couple of times.
You're saving to yourself right now,
"Great Chris. Yon did whatever everyone
else does when they go home. So what?"
Well, let me explain. I'm trying to point
to the fact ih.it in our insanely busy Stan
