# FARM LIFE
## Doing nothing 
### 
Okay, so I didn't go to Rosarito,
Cancun, Daytona Beach or
even I*is Vegas. I went home.
One week of me, the television

and nothing. Oh yes,
good sittingnon the smJU
erffNyi n Tra vW 1
Channel and TRL
while occasionally Hip
ping between Comedy
Central and whatever
war feature was on the
History Channel. (That
way I felt I could justify

my mindless watching by learning all
about building the bridge across the
Rhine at Remagen at "the twilight of
World War II;" my polisci profs are so
proud).
I did other productive things 100,
some of which, like my brief watching of
the History Channel, were also quite edu
cational. The movie "Krin Brockovich"
was quite g<K)d; I am now very afraid of
the water-fountain in my dorm and
PG&K is yet another thing I'll chalk back
to my "California Myth" column. I must
say, though, in the words of one cynical
reviewer, Hinkley must be the only town
left in California that hasn't switched to
DaSani and Poland Spring. All the same,
Julia Roberts' outfits were quite good,
making the film in my opinion quite

diverting. Bra-vo!
Now, ilic plan was to really only go
back to my beloved New York (which, by
(he way, when I landed was 35 degrees
and gray) for half the break and then
return tor half a week's skiing in Lake
Tahoe (tough life, I know). However,
halfway through winter quarter, 1 real
ized 1 needed to get away for the full
week, and so changed my air-tickets. The
reason: Chris needed the rejuvenation of
doing absolutely nothing.
Doing nothing is actually a misnomer,
as I'm sure you'll all agree. 1 was doing
"something." That included sleeping a
lot, watching a lot of TV, driving all over
(even New Jersey one day) and chilling
with friends from Before Stanford (read:
high school). I even hiked in the woods
near my house at 10 p.m. — something
I'd never done before in my IS years of
lilt- in upstate New York. I visited my old
school, hung out in scenic larrytown
(that's where I'm from for .ill practical
purposes), and went into The (lily
(there's only one, and it ain't San Francis
co) a couple of times.
You're saving to yourself right now,
"Great Chris. Yon did whatever everyone
else does when they go home. So what?"
Well, let me explain. I'm trying to point
to the fact ih.it in our insanely busy Stan


Chris Moloney
forcllife (I made that word up — cool,
hull.'') a week of unproductivity, misla
befed-as "doing nothing" actually does a
lot for the soul. I'm coming hack rejuve
nated, but more importantly, I'm coming
back reach fin spring quarter.
lor starters, I'm not exhausted, and let
me tell you, In that Frida\ of finals week

two weeks ago, I was about ready to col
lapse. being home, as nice as it is for that
one week, unfortunately gets old after a
while, bv this past Sunday, 1 was ready to
get on that plane back to San Jose and
hack to Stanford life like nobody's busi
ness. That's the great part of sitting at
home for a week "doing nothing" because
psychologically, it reminds a person of all
that we do out here on the Farm and
helps give a much needed perspective
when we're lost in Dead Week or a drea
ry rainy clay in February.
I hat perspective of the accomplish

ments — big and small, noticed and
unnoticed — that we make each quarter
we conquer here at Stanford, is the key to
helping me at least sec- why I'm here and
help me better scratch the surface of my
end-g( >al.
We're all guiltv of logging into Axess
every day of break until the darn things
we love to hate appeal after c licking on
"course and grade history;" this is yet
another manifestation of the perspective
giving importance of a restful break,
where we can look at what we've done in
a setting where there's no pressure of

papers and finals, a setting that for all
practical purposes is a week-long
"breather" from the fun and scary tumult
that is being a student on the Farm.
So, I enjoyed my week of doing noth
ing. Sure, I didn't get to indulge in
binge-drinking, large quantities of lech
erous activity, and the other debaucher
ous trappings of spring break in some
equally debauc herons locale in Mexico or
Florida, but it's all good — 1 watched 24-
hour live coverage on MTV with my
hosts Carson and Ananda in between
spates of Clinton's spring break in India

and the Pope's in Israel on CNN. It was
all good. Besides, there's always next
March, and watch out for next time,
when, I, too come back with a wrist cov
ered in colorful plastic bracelets with sto
ries to regale everyone with at dinner
from when I went clubbing with a bunch
of people from U-Mich at some bar
called La Boom.

Chris run be em tiled at cmaloney@leland. He
is not Jason Yorkshire, does not have "so many
enemies," hut did find the CJuipjrie-Daily funny
all the same.

"course and grade history;" this is yet
another manifestation of the perspective
giving importance of a restful break,
where we can look at what we've done in
a setting where there's no pressure of

papers and finals, a setting that for all
practical purposes is a week-long
"breather" from the fun and scary tumult
that is being a student on the Farm.
So, I enjoyed my week of doing noth
ing. Sure, I didn't get to indulge in
binge-drinking, large quantities of lech
erous activity, and the other debaucher
ous trappings of spring break in some
equally debauc herons locale in Mexico or
Florida, but it's all good — 1 watched 24-
hour live coverage on MTV with my
hosts Carson and Ananda in between
spates of Clinton's spring break in India

and the Pope's in Israel on CNN. It was
all good. Besides, there's always next
March, and watch out for next time,
when, I, too come back with a wrist cov
ered in colorful plastic bracelets with sto
ries to regale everyone with at dinner
from when I went clubbing with a bunch
of people from U-Mich at some bar
called La Boom.

enemies," hut did find the CJuipjrie-Daily funny
all the same.
