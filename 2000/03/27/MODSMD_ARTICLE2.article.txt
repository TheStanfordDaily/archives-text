### MEGAN KNIZE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a student photographed workers
throwing away "boxes and boxes" of mail two
weeks ago. postal officials from San Francis
co have begun an external investigation of
the Stanford post ofiice.
On the morning of March 10. freshman
Michael Osofsky made a routine trip toe heck
his mail. But when he got there, he saw a post
office custodian throwing what he called
"boxes and boxes" of mail into a dumpster
behind the post office.
"She was on her second batch and when I
asked her what was going on, she responded,
'We do things like this to save time,' " Osof
sky said.
Osofsky then went to 1 ressider Fxpress,
purchased a disposable camera, and re
turned to the dumpster where he pho
tographed postal workers still throwing away

mail, lie said workers allowed him to take
the photos, and he estimated that the clump
ster was three-fourths full when they were
done.
Discarding first-class mail is a felony, al
though hulk mail, if undeliverable, may be
thrown away.
Horace Hinshaw, spokesperson for the
San Francisco regional postal service, con
firmed that deliverable mail was found in the
dumpster.
Osolsky said some of the mail was time
sensitive, such as Stanford Introductory
Seminal booklets describing course offer
ings.
1 le then called postal service investigators
from San Francisco. Hinshaw said the inves
tigation began the same day, with investiga
tors arriving at the post office in the after
noon and recovering the mail from the
dumpster. He declined to comment further
011 the investigation.
Osofsky also contacted second-year law
student I y Clevenger, who has been an out
spoken critic of the Stanford post ofiice. Os
ofsky said he is a member of a student-orga-

ni/ed "task force" created be
cause of student concerns
about poor postal service.
Clevenger said there have
been many personnel
changes since Osofskv's dis
covery.
(llevenger and ()sofsky held
a press conference on Mar.
1() to publicize the photos
and discuss their experiences
with the post ofiice.
"Out of nine months of
Reader's Digest, 1 got two,"
Clevenger said. He also
showed press members two
pieces of mail he said he re
ceived in his post office box
on Mar. l(i. Both were sent
from the Fast Coast over a
month earlier, on Jan. 7.
Clevenger also said he's had
bills arrive three and a half

months late, and has also re
ceived checks six weeks later than
expected.
"The day 1 was quoted in the
[San Francisco] Chronicle, they
were in my P.O. Box," he said. "If
this mail is toeing thrown under a
table or stuffed in a drawer, this
can be a potential criminal mat
ter."
Palo Alto postal officials began
an internal investigation of the
Stanford post office last month
after several students com
plained to postal officials during
an ASSU-organized forum held
Feb. 15 about poor service.
Chris Christoflerson, associate
vice president for facilities and
the provost's office liaison be
tween Stanford and the post of
fice, urged "anyone with specific
problems" to contact him direct
ly. He said he would make sure
complaints are forwarded to the
proper authorities.
Parents of students have also
voiced complaints about the post
office. Ellen Ulrich became in
volved when she sent her daugh
ter's tuition check via Overnight
Express mail in late December
and it didn't arrive until mid-Jan
uary.
Ulrich said she decided to see if
other people had experienced
the same problems with the post
office. Through a series of e-mails
she has sent, Ulrich said she dis
covered 50 undergraduate stu
dents weren't able to vote in the
Mar. 7 election because their vot
ing materials failed to arrive on
time.
She has begun her own cam
paign to put pressure on the Uni
versity to take a more active stand
in the affairs of the post office,
and to ensure that students will
receive the necessary materials to
vote in future elections.
"Voting is very important, and
this to me is outrageous," Ulrich
said. She hopes to get more par
ents involved in her efforts.
"I've received 30 to 40 re
sponses," Ulrich said. "One
woman said it's easier to deliver a
package to rural China that it is to

get a package to her daughunljit
Stanford."
She has notified California's
Attorney General and sent a let
ter to President Gerhard Casper
asking for increased pressure
from the administration to im
prove the post office, an alterpa-'
tive to the post office (sujclvaiac

more information for parents.

Clevenger said the goal of all of
these investigations is to get some

After a student photographed workers
throwing away "boxes and boxes" of mail two
weeks ago. postal officials from San Francis
co have begun an external investigation of
the Stanford post ofiice.
On the morning of March 10. freshman
Michael Osofsky made a routine trip toe heck
his mail. But when he got there, he saw a post
office custodian throwing what he called
"boxes and boxes" of mail into a dumpster
behind the post office.
"She was on her second batch and when I
asked her what was going on, she responded,
'We do things like this to save time,' " Osof
sky said.
Osofsky then went to 1 ressider Fxpress,
purchased a disposable camera, and re
turned to the dumpster where he pho
tographed postal workers still throwing away

mail, lie said workers allowed him to take
the photos, and he estimated that the clump
ster was three-fourths full when they were
done.
Discarding first-class mail is a felony, al
though hulk mail, if undeliverable, may be
thrown away.
Horace Hinshaw, spokesperson for the
San Francisco regional postal service, con
firmed that deliverable mail was found in the
dumpster.
Osolsky said some of the mail was time
sensitive, such as Stanford Introductory
Seminal booklets describing course offer
ings.
1 le then called postal service investigators
from San Francisco. Hinshaw said the inves
tigation began the same day, with investiga
tors arriving at the post office in the after
noon and recovering the mail from the
dumpster. He declined to comment further
011 the investigation.
Osofsky also contacted second-year law
student I y Clevenger, who has been an out
spoken critic of the Stanford post ofiice. Os
ofsky said he is a member of a student-orga-

ni/ed "task force" created be
cause of student concerns
about poor postal service.
Clevenger said there have
been many personnel
changes since Osofskv's dis
covery.
(llevenger and ()sofsky held
a press conference on Mar.
1() to publicize the photos
and discuss their experiences
with the post ofiice.
"Out of nine months of
Reader's Digest, 1 got two,"
Clevenger said. He also
showed press members two
pieces of mail he said he re
ceived in his post office box
on Mar. l(i. Both were sent
from the Fast Coast over a
month earlier, on Jan. 7.
Clevenger also said he's had
bills arrive three and a half

ceived checks six weeks later than
expected.
"The day 1 was quoted in the
[San Francisco] Chronicle, they
were in my P.O. Box," he said. "If
this mail is toeing thrown under a
table or stuffed in a drawer, this
can be a potential criminal mat
ter."
Palo Alto postal officials began
an internal investigation of the
Stanford post office last month
after several students com
plained to postal officials during
an ASSU-organized forum held
Feb. 15 about poor service.
Chris Christoflerson, associate
vice president for facilities and
the provost's office liaison be
tween Stanford and the post of
fice, urged "anyone with specific
problems" to contact him direct
ly. He said he would make sure
complaints are forwarded to the
proper authorities.
Parents of students have also
voiced complaints about the post
office. Ellen Ulrich became in
volved when she sent her daugh
ter's tuition check via Overnight
Express mail in late December
and it didn't arrive until mid-Jan
uary.
Ulrich said she decided to see if
other people had experienced
the same problems with the post
office. Through a series of e-mails
she has sent, Ulrich said she dis
covered 50 undergraduate stu
dents weren't able to vote in the
Mar. 7 election because their vot
ing materials failed to arrive on
time.
She has begun her own cam
