Clarifying the Webb Ranch debate
Your March 1 story, "Webb Ranch
workers get raise," misquoted my com
ments on Donald Kennedy. It was actual-
Is Gerhard Casper who told the Faculty
Senate in 1993, "Every minute I spend on
these matters ... is a minute I do not
spend on Stanford University business"
(The Daily, Oct. 15,1993, p. 12).
Kennedy's position on Webb Ranch
was in fact no better. Kennedy did not
think Stanford had any more responsibil
ity for a migrant farm on Stanford land
than lot Macy's employees who work at
the Stanford Shopping Center, an amoral
policy which, lamentably, was reaffirmed
in your story by acting general counsel
Debra Zumwalt.
I believe the evidence shows that the
workers at Webb Ranch will continue to
live and work in poverty as long as the
Webbs continue to lease Stanford land.
'Illis argues for terminating the lease,
inviting the Webbs to leave Stanford land
and accepting the University's responsi

bility for employing the workers who for
decades have been exploited there.

Defending Modern Thought and Literature
We are writing to set the record
straight regarding your March It article,
"MTL Program Questioned." This article
purported to he a summary of the recent
Faculty Senate debate on the future of
Modern Thought and Literature, one of
the nation's premier interdisciplinary
programs in the humanities.
The article cited Professor Efron's neg
ative comments about the program, fail
ing to note that he later withdrew his neg
ative recommendation in the face of
incontrovertible evidence of MTL's suc
cess.
At the meeting, David Palumbo-Liu,
MTL's director, presented the findings on
all areas in which programs are normally

evaluated: national reputation, recruit
ment, student awards, job placement, and
alumni satisfaction. He demonstrated that
MTL matched and indeed usually exceed
ed, all the normal expectations.
Furthermore, while referring to
ambiguous statements of concern that
Stanford "rethink" the MTL program,
you ignored the lion's share of the com
ments.
Philosophy Prof Deborah Sat/., along
with others, reminded the senate that
ORE scores have long Ix'cn recognized to
lx' poor indicators of academic success
and intellectual productivity. The out
standing success of MTL students in all
areas from job placement to publishing
bears this out. Prof. Hans Ulrich Gum
brecht later commented that MTL has
helped Comparative Literature define its
own disciplinary boundaries and that all
departments would benefit from this pro
cess of working alongside interdisciplinary
programs.
Other senators spoke to the provoca
tive and rigorous scholarship of the stu

dents in ihe program. The enthusiastic
support for MI L within Stanford, in
addition to the outpouring of support for
MTL by alumni and other scholars
nationwide, cannot justly be passed over.
The review of MTL is the opening salvo
in a broad-based reconsideration of inter
disciplinary programs at Stanford. Yet, as
most undergraduates can attest, ours is no
longer a world in which the domains of the
humanities, the scxial sciences and the
technosciences can be kept separate.
We strongly believe that Stanford
should be intensifying its commitment to
interdisciplinary work at this time.
We believe that universities are unique
ly positioned to intervene in the ethical
and scxial conundrums that precipitate as
questions of what it means to be human, to
produce literature, to engage so intimately
with technology, to communicate so readi
ly and to transform the world so material
ly and profoundly meet and interact in
ways that have yet to be, but desperately
need to be explicated. MTL is in the fore
front of this work, and we are privileged

and proud to l)e a part of this most respect
ed and vital aspect of the Stanford com
munity.
