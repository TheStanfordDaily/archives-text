## Cardinal comes up just short 
### JIM TANKERSLEY EDITORIAL STAFF 
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — The
NCAA and Mother Nature, two
fairly powerful players in the
world of college basketball,
didn't do Stanford any favors at
the South Regional in Birming
ham.
The NCAA granted the Car
dinal a No. 1 seed, then prompt
ly plucked the team from the
West and dropped it into an
opening bracket two time zones
away, stocked with tough teams.
Tough Suthen' teams, as they
say in Alabama, which brought a
full rack of fans to outnumber
the Stanford faithful about 12
ribs to 1. The Cardinal wore
white on March 19, but make no
mistake about it: North Carolina
was the home team.
It was like the Selection Com
mittee said, "OK, here's your
top seed. Now just try to get out
of this region."
After North Carolina — a
team that alternately this season
looked like it deserved a No. 2
seed or an N IT bid — made sure
that the Cardinal would not
head to Austin, Texas, for the re
gional final, Mother Nature did
her best to make sure the Cardi
nal wouldn't leave the South.
Pouring rain and gale-force
winds delayed the buses carry
