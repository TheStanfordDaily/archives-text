## Cardinal comes up just short 
### JIM TANKERSLEY EDITORIAL STAFF 
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — The
NCAA and Mother Nature, two
fairly powerful players in the
world of college basketball,
didn't do Stanford any favors at
the South Regional in Birming
ham.
The NCAA granted the Car
dinal a No. 1 seed, then prompt
ly plucked the team from the
West and dropped it into an
opening bracket two time zones
away, stocked with tough teams.
Tough Suthen' teams, as they
say in Alabama, which brought a
full rack of fans to outnumber
the Stanford faithful about 12
ribs to 1. The Cardinal wore
white on March 19, but make no
mistake about it: North Carolina
was the home team.
It was like the Selection Com
mittee said, "OK, here's your
top seed. Now just try to get out
of this region."
After North Carolina — a
team that alternately this season
looked like it deserved a No. 2
seed or an N IT bid — made sure
that the Cardinal would not
head to Austin, Texas, for the re
gional final, Mother Nature did
her best to make sure the Cardi
nal wouldn't leave the South.
Pouring rain and gale-force
winds delayed the buses carry
ing Stanford from the Birming
ham-Jefferson Civic Center to
the city airport. Thunderstorms
grounded the team's connector
flight to Atlanta on the runway
for four hours (the crew had
enough time to show "The
Bachelor," a full-length movie,
on a flight that totaled 30 min
utes in the air.)
It was (3:30 a.m. Eastern Stan
dard Time when the Cardinal fi
nally lifted off for San Francisco,
having spent seven hours
camped out on the short gray
carpeting of Atlanta's B Termi
nal. The team arrived in the Bay
Area late enough to miss morn
ing rush hour, and the final bus
managed to drop the team at
Maples Pavilion at 10 a.m. Pacif
ic Standard Time, 18 hours after
Stanford dried its postgame
tears and began the long jour
ney home.
Understatement of the year:
It was a bad day.
But neither nature nor the
NCAA was responsible for the
worst part of it. The Cardinal
had only itself to blame for that,
coming up short — as it has all
year — in the clutch.
Stanford shot poorly and
couldn't match North Carolina's
defensive intensity at key times
in its 60-53 second-round loss.
The Cardinal turned in its typi
cal big-game effort, grabbing an
early lead, losing it just before
halftiine and falling apart down
the stretch.
Sound familiar? That's be
cause you've seen Stanford put
on this play before, in such clas
sic losses as Jan. 8 vs. Arizona,
Feb. 28 vs. UCLA and the Wild
cat rematch March 6 in Tucson.
Not coincidentally, those were
the three biggest games the Car
dinal played in conference this
season, all Stanford defeats.
"l oss in the Tar Heel loss and
last year's second-round exit at
the hands of Conzaga, and the
record shows that Stanford
hasn't won a big one for more
Xh au a yea r, . >L- s iiu i
thumped 'Zona to win the Pacif
ic 10 Conference title at home
near the end of the 1998-99 sea
son.
Mike Montgomery's teams
clawed their way to college bas
ketball's top ranks by putting to
gether a string of quality wins.
Brevin Knight and an army of
big men knock Tim Duncan and
Wake Forest from the 1997
tournament. Art Lee and Mark

Madsen lead the miracle 1998
Final Four run. A Cardinal
squad that lost four starters to
graduation beats Duke to open
this season, loses Madsen in the
process and goes on to topple
Auburn anyway.
But the Cardinal has now
bowed out in two straight NCAA
second rounds because it
couldn't bring its A-game when
it mattered most.
Last year, Stanford could
blame its woes on injuries and a
lack of late-season focus. But
this year's team was healthy and
bent on advancing deep into the
tourney. It boasted a pair of
emotional leaders in seniors
Madsen and David Moseley.
Against North Carolina,
though, Stanford played iis
worst game of the year.
Seven-foot far Heel center
Brendan Haywood dominated
the paint and Cardinal twin low
ers Jarron and Jason Collins.
Leading scorer Casey Jacobsen
shot blanks under a tight cloak
of Carolina defenders, finishing
with five points on 2-of-12
shooting.
The daunting task facing
Montgomery and his assistants
this offseason is to figure out
what went wrong.
Sure, Stanford played weak
inside or shot poorly outside
several times throughout the
season.
Rarely, though, did both Car
dinal offensive engines stop fir
ing at the same time. Never for a
whole game, like they did
against Carolina.
The daunting task facing the
Cardinal players, minus Mose- <
ley and Madsen, is to learn how .
to carry on without their two !
fiery leaders, and to bear the |
added pressure next year to stay '
alive past the second round and >
avoid the "tournament bust" •
label usually reserved for teams !
like Cincinnati and Tennessee.
The only task either the play
ers or the coaches worried about
on that rainy Sunday night in
Birmingham was getting home.
A few hours into the delay, no
one talked about missed shots or
,
1 hey searched the airports
for food, played cards,' listened
to music. Montgomery napped
on the hard gray carpet of At
lanta Terminal B.
The coach will have the com
ing months to reflect on the loss;
players will have them to work
out and improve their skills.
Mother Nature? She could use
some time to learn not to kick
folks when they're down.
