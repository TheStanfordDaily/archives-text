# Tar Heels end Stanford's playoff run
## North Carolina shatters Cardinal Final Four hopes with 60-53 victory 
### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — The object of basketball
can be explained very easily — score more than the
other team.
Even succeeding in the NCAA Tournament, those
three weeks of sound and fury that have come to sig
nify everything in college basketball, can be summed
up into a few words — survive and advance.
But after doing a poor job at following either rule
— after shooting only 34.5 percent from the field last
Sunday against North Carolina and after losing 60-
53 to the Tar Heels to get ousted from the tourna
ment in the second round for the second consecutive
year — the feelings were a little more difficult to ex
plain.
"It's kind of a numbing feeling to think that the
season is over," said Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "To be sitting here and to have the season
over is difficult to comprehend."
As North Carolina ran onto the court in a frenzy
after beating the top-seeded Cardinal in Birming
ham, Ala. last Sunday, the loss left Stanford players
upset and in tears, their dream-season reduced to a
seemingly unending journey back home.
"We wanted this to be the culmination of our time
here," said senior guard David Moseley, sitting with
fellow seniors Mark Madseti and Alex Gelbard after

the game. "Bui hopefully, some
day we'll get i<» win a champi
onship. Fnfbrtunately that wasn't
today."
I nlike last season when 10th
seedecl Con/.aga upset Stanford
mostly on the strength of its three
point shooting, North Carolina
took it light at Stanford and flat
<>illl>l.i\<-(I the Cardinal, at least in
the last few minutes.
After Stanford took a 47-43
lead on freshman |ason Collins'
hook shot over Carolina's intimi
dating seven-fool tenter Brendan
1 lax wood, the l ar I leels made all
the clutch shots and gathered in
every important rebound. On the
other hand, everything Stanford
hoisted up seemed to sadly slip
around the rim before falling out.
After Haywood pulled Caroli
na within two on a jump-hook
with eight minutes remaining, the
real difference became the far
Heels' smooth-shooting fresh
man, Joseph Forte.
Forte, the first freshman to ever
lead I N( 1 in scoring for a season,
drove down the right baseline to
tie the game at 47 with 5:15 re
maining. I hen a minute later with
the shot clock winding down,
Forte curled around a pick to the
top of the key and sank a three
pointer to give the l ar 1 leels their
first lead in over seven minutes.
"In the second half, coach [Bill
(Juthi idge] said stop shooting like
I was scared," said Forte, who fin
ished with a game-high 17 points
despite storing only four before
halltime. "I started to do that and
the ball started to go in."
But he wasn't done yet. After

the field and onlv I -fbr-6on three
pointers iu the second half— the
Carolina freshman hit almost the
same shot it) complete a 10-0 UNC
run that gave the team a 53-47
lead.
I he shot was particularly hard
to watch for Cardinal fans as it
rolled around the rim and hit off
the backboard before sliding
through the net. I hough the
game lasted another three and a
half'minutes, that shot effectively
entletl the game.
But that shot alonetlitl not sink
Stanford. I he team's own shoot
ing woes hurt the (Cardinal in ways
it never had all season.
A team that prided itself on its
abilitv to hold opponents to an
NCAA-record low 35.2 shooting
percentage saw Carolina hit 44
percent of its shots and 57 percent
from three-point territory. Stan
ford was the team that struggled
shooting, hitting only 34.5 per
cent of its shots and only 27 per
cent from three-point territory. Its
53 points was a season low.
" 1 hey negated [our] inside
[presence] because they were so
big and they forced us outside,"
Montgomery said. "They ran at
our shooters with big players and
we had a stretch or two where we
shot the ball hoping it would go in,
not expecting it to."
Coming into the game, Stan
ford had a freshman phenoin of
its own to counter Forte. But on
the floor, Casey Jacobsen couldn't
match Forte's clutch play. On his
19th birthday, Jacobsen put up a
scant five points on 2-of-12 shoot
ing. And though he hit almost 45
percent of his three-pointers dur
ing the regular season, under the
spotlight he hit only l-of-8.
"They had hands in my face,
but I've shot with hands in my face
all my life, that's no excuse," Ja

cobsen said. "I've had bad nights
before, it just hurts more when it
means more."
The game didn't go any better
tor Stanford inside. Haywood, (>-
foot-10-inch forward Kris Lang
and Julius Peppers — a 6-7, 270-
pound forward who doubles as

Carolina's starting defensive end
— controlled the paint, rejecting
eight Stanford shots, pulling
down 15 rebounds and scoring 28
points combined.
Though he picked up eight
boards and three blocks of his
own, All-American forward Mark

Madsen scored only five points.
"It was a battle out there," Mad
sen said. "Haywood's a guy who
can wear people down. That's one
of the most intense games I've
played in."
And after a quick peer down at
the statistics, the game was also

one of the easiest to decipher.
Said Montgomery, "It's a sim
ple game about putting the hall in
the basket and we didn't shoot
very well. They performed better
than we did, so they won."
And for Stanford, that's about
as painfully simple as it can get.
