# Swim takes third at NCAAs
## 
### MAREN EWERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I lie Stanford swimming and diving dy
nasty turned in a respectable third place fin
ish at the NCAA championships in Indi
anapolis, Ind. last weekend.
Georgia dominated the meet from day
one, earning 490.5 points to defend its sec
ond national title in two years. Arizona was a
close second with 472.3 points, and the Car
dinal took third with 397 points.
The Stanford team, historically a major
swimming powerhouse, has placed in the
top three at the NCAA championships for
nine consecutive years and has won six na
tional titles in that time. The Cardinal's de
feat was due in part to the fact that it took
only eleven swimmers and three divers to the
meet, the smallest NCAA team in years.
"I'hird place is really the best we could do
considering the size of our team, so we were
pretty satisfied with the meet's outcome,"
said junior diver Erin Sones. "It is hard to be
ecstatic with third when Stanford has such a
strong past, but we had a great meet."
"We were a little disappointed that we
didn't place better as a team," said sopho
more Sylvia Bereknyei. "It was really hard to
compete with Georgia, who had nearly twice

as many qualifiers as we did. We just didn't
have the depth to defeat them."
This year's competition was held in short
course meters instead of short course yards
for the first time ever. The change to meters
increased the length of each race by 11 per
cent, which was a factor for all the teams at
the meet.
"It was difficult for some of the swimmers
to do the switch," Bereknyei said. "We
trained to be ready for the longer distances,
but a lot of people died towards the end of
each race."
Despite the change in pool length, this
year's competition was one of the fastest
NCAAs in history. Over the three day meet,
two world records (50 backstroke, 400 med
ley relay) and one world best (200 medley
relay) were broken, as well as 1 1 American
records. Though none of the record-break
ers were on the Stanford team, the team
turned in a number of strong individual
swims.
Senior co-captain Catherine Fox conclud
ed her Stanford career with a third-place 112 in
ish in the 50-meter freestyle (24.97). She also
placed fourth in both the 100 freestyle and

Sophomore Shelly Ripple

second in the 200 backstroke
(2:08.01), fifth in the 100 back
. stroke (59.56) and third in the 200
butterfly (2:10.21). Junior Misty
Hyman placed second in both but
terfly events (58.60 and 2:06.55).
Sophomore Jessica Foschi was
another big point winner for the
Cardinal. She dominated the dis
tance events, placing second in the
400 freestyle (4:06.17), fifth in the
; 1650 freestyle (16:18.17) and 12th

freestyle, while junior Siobhan

At the diving end of the pool,
Sones had a fabulous meet. After
placing 14th in the 1-meter event,
she took third in the 3-meter, and
10th in the platform diving event.
Junior Kim Powers placed seventh
in the platform (449.55) and 17th in
the 3-meter.
Sones said she felt very positive
about both her individual diving
and the team's overall finish.
"1 was thrilled with my diving,
but would have liked our team to
do better. Hopefully we'll have
some good freshmen coming in
next year that will help us win back
the national title."
For the rest of the year, the
team will forget its bittersweet
third-place NCAA finish, and will
set its sights on the Olympic trials,
which take place in July and Au
gust. Many Cardinal athletes hope
to make the U.S. Olympic team,
and the tiext three months will be
dedicated to preparation for the
trials.
