# Record-setting relay leads men to second-place finish
## 
### BEN ALLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — Not very
often does one get to witness the best per
formance ever produced in a track event.
That's probably why, when the Stan
ford distance medley relay squad posted
the fastest time ever run, even the arch
rival fans of the Arkansas Razorbacks near
ly blew the roof off the Randal Tyson In
door Track at the National Indoor Track
and Field Championships.
Led by the world-best performance of
the DMR squad and a 1-2 sweep in the
mile, Stanford gathered 52 points, nabbed
the runner-up trophy at the champi

onship meet and managed to both electri
fy and put a scare into the eventual cham
pion Razorbacks' home crowd.
Stanford's indoor romp began with the
medley relay — a test of middle distance
strength made up of a 1,200-, 400-, 800-,
and a 1,600-meter leg. The team, com
prised of sophomores Gabe Jennings,
Evan Kelty and Jonathon Riley and senior
Michael Stember, had set the American
record just weeks before on the same track
at 9 minutes, 30.19 seconds.
"I think they had it in the back of their
minds that they could set the world best,"
said head coach Vin Lananna. "When
James Karanu (of Arkansas) took it out so
fast, it was perfectly set up."

Jennings tucked in behind Karanu for
much of his six-lap tour, but he unleashed
a ferocious kick over the final 400 that left
Karanu in his wake as he split 2:52.0, the
best ever for a 1,200 DMR leg.
Kelty got the baton next. Nerves rat
tling from a crowd whose cheers seemed
to indicate a Razorback closing fast, Kelty
broke oil a 48.4-second two-lapper that
kept Stanford out front.
From that point on, it was Stanford ver
sus the clock. Stember's 1:48.3 leg set up
Riley's solo 4:00.8 effort that catapulted
Stanford to the top of the record books.
Streaking to a 58-second first lap, Riley
was comfortably in the lead. But watching
the stadium Jumbotron, Riley could see

that Alabama's Tim Broe was mounting a
charge. When Riley began to tire with 800
to go, his teammates gave him a boost.
"Michael (Stember) and Gabe (Jen
nings) were on the infield screaming their
lungs out at me," Riley said. "1 wanted to
complete what they had started."
Riley closed in style.
"Coming down the homestretch, I saw
the clock tic king 9:25,9:20,9:27 — I knew
we had the record.
"When I crossed the line, Michael hit
me so hard it knocked the wind out of me.
ft was awesome just to realize what we had
accomplished," Riley said.
The squad's final time set the world best
at 9:28.83.

"Ever since we first got here, Michael,
Gabe and 1 have wanted to do things that
nobody else has ever done," Riley said.
" This is just the start."
Jennings and Stember followed up
their DMR efforts with a spectacular mile.
Allowing the field to pass the halfway point
in a pedestrian 2:03, the duo only moved
up from the back of the pack with less than
800 meters to go.
"We left the first half alone, since we
were confident that our guys could win
from any distance,' Lananna said.
Jennings bolted first with Stember in
tow. With 400 meters remaining, it was
just a matter of which Cardinal jer
sey would cross first. Jennings took
the honors, posting a 3:59.40.
Stember was just behind at
4:00.75.
"I've been running out of my
mind," Jennings said. "My legs are
drums — I'm just playing music.
Instead of lonising on the prize,
I'm just enjoying the competition."
Points for Stanford also came in
the 5,000 meters, where senior
Brent Hauser was second
(13:54.27) and senior Jason Balk
man was sixth (14:06.04). Both
were named All Americans.
Senior Toby Stevenson was sec
ond in the pole vault with a Stan
ford record of 18 feet, 4 1/2 inches.
With just the 3,000-meter run

remaining, the crowd was stunned
to hear that Stanford appeared to
have a shot at taking the champi
onship trophy away from defend
ing champ Arkansas.
But the comeback was not to be.
I hough two Stanford runners
scored in the 3,000, Arkansas came
through with two scorers of its
own, building on a huge base of
jumps points, to seal the victory.
For the Cardinal, Brent Mauser
earned his second All-America
honor with a sixth-place showing
(8:04.42), and Jennings was sev
enth (8:04.96) for his third All-
American award.
"I don't think I could have
asked for more fioin our athletes,"
Lananna said. " They came and
performed.
"We got 52 points from seven
athletes. They dug down and gave
a great meet... it was exciting to be
in the hunt."
