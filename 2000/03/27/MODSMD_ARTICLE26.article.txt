FAYF I TFVI LIT, Ark.— For a group of
athletes who were supposed to be tuning up
for the outdoor season, the Cardinal women
did a line job of tearing down a few indoor
records at the National Indoor Track and
Field (Championships.
Led by the first-place finish of the distance
medley relay team, Stanford stored 15 points
en route to an 11th place showing at the meet
and chiseled three new marks into the school
record books.
"The women did a great job, considering
we were about 3()th last year," said head coach
Vin Lananna. "It's a great move up, especial
ly with only five women competing."
Four of those five women (senior Sally
Glynn, junior Jayna Smith and freshmen
Lindsay Hyatt and Lauren Fleshman) com
prised the distance medley squad, which came
into the meet ranked third with a time of 1 1
minutes, 20.0 seconds. The DMR is com
prised of a 1,200-, 400-, 800- and a 1,600-
meter leg.
At start time, however, the third-place seed
ing was the furthest thing from the squad's

mind.
"When we waiting for the start, [Glynn]
turned to me and said, 'You know what? I
want to win,'" Smith said. "I said, 'You know
what? So do I.'"
(ilynn backed up her talk with a strong first
leg, handing the baton to Smith in second
place. Smith and Hyatt combined for blazing
legs which kept the Cardinal in contention.
Fleshman executed the final step, passing
the BYU team and building a ten-second lead
over the final mile.
"1 just kept thinking about how great it
would be to bring home a national champi
onship for Stanford," said Fleshman, whose
leg was (unofficially) clocked at 4:36.
"I knew all three of my teammates had run
their butts off , and I just went out to do my job
— run as hard as I possibly could."
Fleshman crossed the finish stripe at
11:01.56, a new Stanford record by almost 17
seconds. The time was the third-best perfor
mance in NCAA history behind two Villanova
squads and was less than a second off Villano
va's American record of 11:00.71.
I he Stanford squad now holds the NCAA
championship meet record as well.
In addition to their DMR contributions,

Smith and Hyatt came away with individual
records of their own.
Smith, whose relay 400 was clocked at
under 53 seconds, snared a new school best
with a 53.59 in the 400 preliminaries.
"In the beginning of the season, I never ex
pected to run as last as 1 am now," Smith said.
"It took a lot of encouragement from Coach
Edrick (Floreal) and a lot of believing in mvself
... to actually come out here and do it."
Hyatt blitzed a 2:05.95 in the 800 prelimi
naries for a new school record and followed
up with a 2:06.87 for seventh in the finals.
Aside from Hyatt, Fleshman was the only
other Stanford runner to score individual
points for the Cardinal. Her 9:20.62 in the
3000 was good enough for sixth place and
garnered her All America honors.
Freshman Frin Sullivan, the only other
woman competing for the Cardinal, was 12th
at 9:31.31.
Sullivan and Fleshman had little time to
celebrate — they left for the World Junior
Cross Country (championships.in Portugal di
rectly from Arkansas. There, Fleshman
placed 26th (22:08) and Sullivan was 30th
(22:12) out of 132 over the four-kilometer
course.
