## The 						highs and lows of March Madness

Asany good Kansas or (lint innaii lan
will it'll you, it's tough watching a
team lose early that you know de
served better. It's worse when ii
starts getting to be a habit.
When ih.it second-round final buzzer
sounds and (ioliath is down lor the count, the

nation rejoices at another
NCAA "Cinderella Story,"
and a low-seed dandy lives
to fight another week. 1 hat
was the case in 1998, when
the Midwest No. 1 seed Jay
hawks fell to No. 8 Rhode
Island and opened the door
to the Final Four tor Stan
ford.
Now, for the second year

in a row, it is the Cardinal's turn to head home
early from the Big Dance.
"Sometimes you end up cutting down the
nets," said senior guard Alex Celbard after
Stanford's 60-53 loss to North Carolina
March 19, "and sometimes you end up c rying
in the locker room."
Last year, you probably saw it coming.
Sure, your heart took Stanford to the Final
Four in your bracket, but your hoops-crazed
mind knew that the injury-depleted Cardinal
men's team was ripe for an upset.

I bis year, ii hit you like a Brendan Hey
wood two-handed jam.
For 25 games this season, you thought —
you hmr — ii wouldn't happen again. Stan
lord blew through the preseason and (lie first
eight weeks of Pacific 10 Conference play
with just one small scratch. Two weeks before
March Madness, a trip to Indianapolis
seemed all but inevitable.
Then, UCLA pulled off a shocker at
Maples Pavilion, and Arizona ambushed the
(Cardinal in Tucson, and the NCAA sent Stan
lord to the South Region crowded with na
tional title contenders. Suddenly, the Final
Four didn't seem such a sure bet.
But you looked over the tournament
field, listened to the ESPN analysts croon
about the parity in college basketball and
thought, end-of-season-skid be damned,
Stanford really has a shot here. Not at the
Sweet Sixteen or even the Final Four. At the
whole tlung.
And you were right. You still might be right.
I lie Cardinal might still be the best team in the
country, might still play the best inside-outside
game in the country, might still have the best
coach and the hardest-working players and the
top team chemistry in the land.
But it also might have the nation's worst
timing, saving its poorest performances for

two late-season games (at Arizona and vs.
North Carolina) that meant everything.
Nevertheless this was probably the great
est team in Cardinal history. Better than the
1942 champs, better than the 1998 San Anto
nio Cinderellas, better than the Pac-10
champs of '99.
Comparisons of more than 50 years are
tough to make, so let's stick with the 90s for a
second. The 1998 team played its heart out
against Kentucky in the Final Four and came
up a point short. The '99 squad, even il it had
beaten Gonzaga, was not going to get past
Connecticut.
This year's team had a shot. On any given
night — hell, on most nights — it could have
beaten any other team in the country. Cincy
with Kenyon Martin. Michigan State. Even
Arizona, Loren Woods and all, on a neutral
court.
But that is what we love about the NCAA
Tournament, isn't it?
The best teams don't always make the
Final Four. The top team doesn't always win.
Sixty-four teams start with exactly the same
shot at the title.
For most of the 90s, Stanford worked that
fact to its advantage, beating more talented
teams, making a name for itself on the na
tional level. For two years, the Cardinal fell

victim to it.
It is painful, watching a team that
seemed destined for greatness fall short.
But after the shock wears off, appreciation
lingers. Appreciation for a fantastic season,
for a share of the Pac-10 title.
Appreciation, most of all, for the fact that
you, as a Stanford men's basketball fan, are
now spoiled.
Here is a lesson, then, that you can learn
from the perennial powerhouse women's
hoops team: Kvery year does not bring a Pac
-10 title, every season does not end in the
Final Four. I earns will overachieve and un
derachieve, but they will always entertain,
and they will always work hard.
Odds are, the Cardinal men's team won't
lose in (lie second round next year. Odds are,
it will contend for a conference crown. The
players, certainly, will expect that from them
selves. It's OK for you to expect that from
them, too.
But if Stanford blows a few tires on the
Road to the Final Four in 2001, don't lose
heart. This is the natural law of big time col
lege basketball fanhood.
Sometimes, you end up rushing the court
as they cut down the nets. And sometimes you
cry along with the young men in the locker
room.
