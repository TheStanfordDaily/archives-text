All I KNS, Ca. — Senior Milena Mores
<ind freshman Jamie Carey are a lull loot
shorter then some of their teammates.
Both listed at they are lour inches
smaller than any Ceorgia player that saw
action in the second round.
But Mores and (larey are anything hut
a small lone to reckon with on the basket
ball court. Between the two of them they
have acquired more honors than the rest
of the Stanford team combined.
I he two players each came into the sea
son with a different perspective. Mores,
the exiting senior, looked to leave her
mark on the strong Stanford program. In
her last year on the Farm, her sense of ur
gent \ gave Mores a tremendous desire to
put her team among the (lardinal greats.
Carey came to Stanford as the new

freshman looking to jump-start her ca
reer in college basketball. While she too
was absorbed in the strong tradition of
Cardinal basketball, she had to discover
her role on a new team.
However when you look at the pair,
you could swear they have played togeth
er for years.
"(loming from such different positions,
they both provide tremendous leadership
to our team," said head coach I ara Van-
Derveer. "1 hey compliment each other
very, very well."
VanDerveer isn't the onlv one noticing
her guards are making waves. Mores drib
bled her way to All Pacific 10 Conference
honors for the second straight year, be
coming the first l'ac -10 player to lead the
conference in assists for three straight sea
sons. In addition, she was second on the
team in scoring averaging 1 1.9 points per
game and led the Cardinal in minutes

played.
Carey chalked up a nice assortment of
honors lor herself as well. The freshman
guard received Pac-1() Freshman of the
Year honors after breaking the Stanford
single season three-point record. Carey
was second in the Pac-10 in three-point
percentage, and among the top ten in the
nation in the same category. She was sec
ond next to Flores in minutes played.
While Georgia cut Stanford's NCAA
championship dreams short, Flores and
Carey were major factors in both the first
and second round games. Flores led the
team iu scoring against Michigan with 20
and Carey had a team-high 15 points
against Georgia.
And that is just the statistics. Both Mo
res' and Carey's presence extends far be
yond what can be seen in the box score.
While Flores is primarily a point guard
and Carey can shoot the ball well, their

versatility allows them to switch it up and
adjust to other teams. Carey has led the
team from the point in several critical
games this year and stepped up in the
(leorgia game and ran the offense. Mean
while Flores can be quite the threat from
three-point range, shooting XYA on the
year including a 5-for-8 mark in the
NCAA tournament.
Nut besides the shots, the passes, the
rebounds and the drives, the factor that
seems to set both Flores and (larey apart is
the tremendous intensity that is evident
on both of their faces as they play the
game. I bey are continually encouraging
teammates, shouting out instructions, cel
ebrating their successes and looking to
overcome their mistakes.
"I hope it's evident that both of us have
this tremendous passion for the game,"
Flores said. "Of course I am biased to
wards the guards because I am one. We

are the little short ones that have to work
extra hard to get our shots off and to do all
those special guard things. Hopefully
what everyone sees, the fans and the crit
ics, is that we are trying 100 percent be
cause we love this game."
"Hard work and working hard, play
ing with your heart you can have that
every game," added Carey. "You may not
have your shot. You may be a step be
hind, but you always have your heart.
That's something you lake pride in."
While Carey will be back for three
more seasons on the Farm, the presence
of Flores will be greatly missed when the
Cardinal takes the floor next season.
"I think Milena's improved as much as
any player we've had at Stanford and
grown up as much as any player we have
had at Stanford," said VanDerveer. "We
will truly miss her next year. And as for
Jamie, our future's in good hands."
