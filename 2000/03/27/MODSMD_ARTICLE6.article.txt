Although University President
Gerhard Gasper's successor has
yet to I )c* named, Stanford recent
ly appointed a replacement for its
"other" president: the one in
c harge of Stanford's $7 billion
endowment.
The Stanford Management
Gompany recently named invest

ment banker and Stanford alum
nus Mike McGaffrey as its presi
dent and GEO.
McGaffrey replaces founding
GEO Laurance Hoagland, who
announced his retirement last
October to become treasurer of
tlie* Hewlett Foundation. McGaf
frey will begin management of
the University's endowment in
September.
"Mike McCaffrey brings to his
new task his prior outstanding
management and investment ex
perience as well as familiarity
with Stanford," Casper said.
McCaffrey, 46, is currently
chairman of the board of San
Francisco - based investment
bank Robertson Stephens.
After earning an undergradu
ate degree from Princeton Uni
versity, he attended Oxford Uni
versity as a Rhodes Scholar and
received an M.B.A. from Stan
lord.
An investment banker with
over 20 years of experience, Mc-
Caffrey was previously employed
by Morgan Stanley & Company
before he joined Robertson
Stephens in 1988.
"I hope to be able to continue
and improve upon the great or
ganization and track record that
[Hoagland has] built and in that
way contribute to the future suc
cess of Stanford," McCaffrey
said.
"I absolutely loved my time at
Stanford and feel that the educa
tion I got and the people I met
there were critical to my invest
ment banking career."
The Stanford Management
Company was founded nine
years ago, operating under
Hoagland's guidance to manage

Stanford's significant financial
assets. During that time, the
Merged Endowment Pool, con
trolling most of the University's
endowment, has grown from
$ 1.87 billion to approximately $7
billion.
Growth has been particularly
strong in the last year, up from a
weak 1997-98 performance due
to the Asian financial crisis. The
endowment grew by 36.3 percent
from 1998 to 1999.
"Stanford's return is a little
better than Harvard's, Yale's or
Princeton's," Hoagland said in
January. "Our position in the Sil
icon Valley has helped us to gel
access to the best growth compa
nies."
Stanford's endowment repre
sents the fifth-largest university
investment program in the U.S.
Money from the endowment
makes up a significant part of the
University's budget, and this
year is expected to provide $270

million, or Hi percent of the Uni
versity's $ 1.7 billion revenues, ac
cording to the San Jose Mercury
News.
"[McCaffrey] inherits an Orga
nization that has been producing
exceptional results for the uni
versity under the leadership 'of
Laurie Hoagland," said invest
ment manager John Scully, a
member of the Management
Company's board who chaired
the search committee. " We
contacted dozens of candidates
and potential candidates, and
from our earliest meetings
Mike's name was prominent on
our list. We're very excited Mike
has decided to accept this, posi
tion. He was clearly our first
choice."
Hoagland was the highest
paid Stanford administrator in
1997-98, according to theChmn
icle of Higher Educaiion?>stÂ£n
