# ASSU hopeful barred from spring ballot
## 
### MEGAN KNIZE STAFF WRITER 
In early March, four days after the two original
ASSU slates turned in petitions declaring their can
didacies, junior Mark Johnson also filed a petition to
run. But unlike the competing two-person slates,
Johnson wanted to run alone. ASSU officers and
Elections Commission members met with Johnson
and considered his plea, but denied him permission
to run without a co-candidate.
"I really wanted him to run, but [the Elections
Commission] went back and scoured the by-laws,"
said Elections Commissioner Jason Rang, a cotenni
nal student in economics. "He would run as his own
running mate and that's ridiculous."
But Johnson, who is majoring in philosophy, be
lieved he could change the ASSU — even it he had
to do it alone.
"I was talking with friends about the ASSU, and
right now the ASSU is totally beholden to the ad
ministration," Johnson said. "I would like to get rid
of the old blood that taints the ASSU."
Johnson decided to run for ASSU president on
March 4, the day after petitions were clue. On March
6, he went to the ASSU office to inquire about turn
ing in his forms late.
" I was told by the secretary that 1 would be able to
turn in my forms late without much of a problem, as
long as I got them in ASAP," Johnson said. "1 franti
cally ran through Lakeside Dining collecting signa
tures, and I went from door to door in both Roble
and Flo Mo."
I'he ASSU requires 200 signatures to declare
each slate.Johnson said he had his 200 signatures
that afternoon.
"1 didn't request an extension, because I felt that
it was more important to get the signatures and ask
for permission later," Johnson said.
However, the Elections Commission invalidated
his petition shortly after lie turned it in."The Elec
tions Commission was saying that they couldn't even
look at the petition because it didn't even have a
slate," ASSU President Mike Levin said.
According to the ASSU Constitution, petitions
must state the name of each member of the two-per
son slates."We have policies that make it verv ea,s\
for someone who's interested to run for the ASSU,"
I .evin said.
But Johnson said he thought he could add a vice
president later, and w hen lie found a running mate
(who asked to remain anonymous), the running
mate was denied permission to run as well.
" I here are clearly rules in the Constitution, but
the rules ar.cn.'tau,there tujaiock candidates out of
the race," he said.
So Johnson appealed, believing he could pursue
the matter in an appeals hearing. In an e-mail to
Levin, he admitted that lie broke the rules, but he
said "it was not such a heinous break that 1 should be
denied a space on the ballot for this year."
But according to the ASSU Constitution, "if a |>e :
tition is invalidated for reasons other than violations
of the rules governing petition circulation . . . no
hearing need be held."
Levin said that he and Mills carefully considered
Johnson's appeal, but Levin said he "takes the cam
paign practices code, as well as the Constitution and
by-laws, very seriously" and denied Johnson's re
quest for an appeals hearing.
Rang said that although he is sympathetic .'to
Johnson's case, the by-laws are very important and
that he could not "flagrantly go against them."
Johnson, who says he has no experience in the
ASSU, may run as a write-in candidate this year, ! • i
