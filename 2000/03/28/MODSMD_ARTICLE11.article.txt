## Vladimir Putin elected new president of Russia

MOSCOW (AP) — Russia should be more stable
and predictable under Vladimir Putin after years of
turmoil that left Russians and the rest of the world
wondering who was in charge of the world's largest
country.
Putin has already begun clearing up the uncer
tainty and chaos that characterized ex-president
Boris Yeltsin's final years in power. After winning
presidential elections Sunday, Putin's top goal will
likely be cementing his control of the government.
I he United States and other nations will know
who speaks for Russia and can expect clear dialogue
and straight answers. While clarity in Moscow will lie
a welcome change after Yeltsin, Putin's ambition of
restoring Russia's status as a great power will be less
appealing to the West.
Although Russians hope that Putin can rescue the
floundering economy and improve their lives, many
are happy for now that a strong, capable leader has
taken over.
Russia already seems calmer, far less prone to cri
sis, since Putin became acting president when Yeltsin
unexpectedly resigned on Dec. 31. The one excep
tion has been Russia's military offensive against
breakaway (Chechnya.
Yeltsin, who was frequently ill and out of sight,
showed little interest in running the government or
tackling Russia's enormous problems. Although he
retained a firm grip on power, Yeltsin often was
indifferent or confused.
He did little to stop government insiders from
fighting for wealth and power or to clean up ram
pant corruption.
Yeltsin's unpredictability alarmed the rest of the
world. Russia is still the world's No. 2 nuclear power
and the confusion in the Kremlin often meant sleep

less nights for governments worldwide. As ties dete
riorated. Yeltsin repeatedly waved Russia's nuclear
arsenal at the West.
While the West staked much on Yeltsin for push
ing through democratic reforms, it was also appalled
In his distinctly unpresidential antics and persistent
rumors of alcoholism. Russians were even less
pleased.
Putin has been deliberately vague about his plans.
He insists he will continue democratic and market
reforms, but also speaks of increasing the control of
the state over every aspect of life.
The new president is likely to proceed cautiously,
with no dramatic policy initiatives. Putin comes
ac ross as methodical and deliberate. His first words
after winning the presidency were to tell Russians
not to expect quick lixes.
"The level of expectations is very high. People are
tired and struggling and they're hoping for things to
get better, but miracles don't happen," he said yes
terday.
The former KC«B officer appears to be a national
ist with a strong pragmatic streak. He stresses his
desire for good ties with the West and stability as
long as Moscow is treated as an equal.
Putin is popular because he has restored many
Russians' sense of national pride after years of
decline and humiliation. His talk of putting Russia
back on the map is welcome in a nation that misses
its days as a superpower.
By not raising expectations and moving cautious
ly, Putin may boost his chances of economic and
social improvements. But while Russians are likely to
be patient, they will want to see that the new presi
dent is not tied to the corruption and incompetence
of the Yeltsin administration.
