# Tension mounts over Elian Gonzalez
## 
### 
MIAMI (AP) — The Justice
Department threatened to take
Elian Gonzalez from his Miami
relatives yesterday, as a crowd
gathered outside the boy's Little
Havana home, ready to form a
human chain if necessary.
The risk of a confrontation
over the 6-year-old appeared to
grow as the government and the
Miami relatives traded accusa
tions. The relatives were so wor
ried that Elian would be taken
away that they kept him home
from school.
Attorney General Janet Reno
has demanded that the Miami
relatives pursue any court
appeals rapidly and promise to
surrender Elian for return to his
father in Cuba if they lose.
Yesterday, the relatives filed
their latest appeal — and asked
that the case get expedited han
dling — hut they have not
addressed the other demand.
"That being so, the INS is
under no obligation to maintain
the current arrangement,'' the
government wrote in response,
referring to the deal giving
Elian's great-uncle custody in the
meantime.
Justice Department
spokeswoman Carole Flonnan
would not say what the govern
ment would do next. She said the
department would send the fami

ly a letter outlining its plans.
The agency has made it clear
that it would not want to do any
thing to traumatize the boy or
provoke Miami's large Cuban
community.
Meanwhile, about 100 people
gathered outside Elian's home,
though by evening the crowd had
dwindled to fewer than 50. Some
one put a 15-foot banner in front
of the house with a drawing of
Elian and a message: "1 just want
to live in freedom.''
Many of the protesters
responded to a call by the Democ
racy Movement, an anti-Castro
group, to be prepared to form a
human chain around the home if
the government tries to remove
the child and send him back to his
father in Cuba.
"There are a lot of people who
aren't willing to kill but are will
ing to die only for the child's
rights," said Raul Sanchez, head
of the Democracy Movement.
Elian remained home yester
day, and family spokesman
Armando Gutierrez said he won't
return to school out of lears that
Cuba might try to lorce him back
to the communist island.
As she left the boy's home at
the end of the school day, teacher
Obdulia Copa confirmed that she
will be teaching the child at home
for the rest of the week.
