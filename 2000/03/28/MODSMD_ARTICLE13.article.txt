# OPEC ministers fail to reach agreement

VIENNA, Austria (AP) — OPEC oil minis
ters failed to reach agreement yesterday on
how much crude oil to add to global supplies,
with Iran seen as the chief obstacle to a con
sensus that could provide some price relief to
consumers.
The ministers were to resume discussions
today.
Iran accepts the need for OPEC to boost
output, the Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Nam
dar Zangeneh said, but the amount of an
increase favored by his country might not be
enough to reduce petroleum prices from
nine-year highs.
Zangeneh spoke before the opening yes
terday of the semiannual meeting of oil min
isters from all 1 I members of the Organiza
tion of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
"I won't talk on numbers, but we don't
want a market shortage," he said.
Iran, OPEC's second-largest producer, is
known to favor boosting output by about 1.2

million barrels a day — an amount that prob
ably would do little to reduce world oil prices.
An OPEC delegate, speaking on condition
of anonymity, told reporters that Libya,
Indonesia and Nigeria back Iran's position.
Two other key producers in the group,
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, have proposed a
production increase of 1.5 million to 1.7 mil
lion barrels a day.
The upper limit of their proposed
increase would amount to about 7 percent
more than what OPEC members agreed to
pump after curtailing output last March.
For U.S. motorists and other consumers
of refined products such as gasoline, much
hinges on efforts by Saudi Arabia, OPEC's
No. 1 producer, to win Iran over to its point
of view.
American motorists now pay an average of
$1.59 per gallon for unleaded gasoline, an
increase of nearly 60 cents since prices bot
tomed out at 99.8 cents per gallon in Febru

ary 1999, according to a Lundberg Survey of
10,000 U.S. gas stations released Saturday.
Industry analysts warn of possible short
ages and $2-a-gallon gas during the peak
driving season this summer if OPEC fails to
increase production significantly.
Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan sought yesterday to mini
mize fears raised by some U.S. lawmakers
that a recent spike in fuel prices could have
a negative effect on economy.
"Currently, we do not as yet — and
emphasize as yet — see any significant indi
cation that crude oil price increases are in
the process of embedding themselves in
other areas of the economy and inflating the
general price structure," he said in testimo
ny before a Senate committee in Washing
ton.
Greenspan said it was unclear what level
of energy inflation would be needed to
spread to other areas of the economy.
