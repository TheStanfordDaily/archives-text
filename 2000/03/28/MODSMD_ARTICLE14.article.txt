### 
WASHING I ON (AP) —
Some government lawyers have
expressed sufficient interest in a
settlement Microsoft Corp. has
offered in its antitrust case that
they expect a trial judge at least
to delay plans to deliver his ver
dict today.
lhe 11 th-hour proposal
from Microsoft, faxed on Fri
day, was considered generally
inadequate in important areas
In some of the 19 states in the
lawsuit.
But it was provoking enough
discussion among others on
yesterday that a delay was
expec ted, according to sources
close to the case who spoke on
condition of anonymitv.
Other sources with knowl
edge of the negotiations said
nothing was expected for at
least 10 days. I .S. Assistant
Attorney General Joel Klein
flew to New York for an unre
lated meeting yesterda\ night

at Columbia University.
U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson earlier warned
lawyers in a private meeting
that he will announce his deci
sion today absent progress dur
ing settlement talks, which were
being coordinated in Chicago
by a federal appeals judge,
Richard Posner.
Some of the difficulties in
evaluating Microsoft's offer
stemmed from the large num
ber of plaintiffs. The Justice
Department was discussing
Microsoft's 10-page proposal
with states, and some states
were exchanging thoughts in a
series of telephone conference
calls yesterday.
Jackson has signaled that he
will rule strongly against
Microsoft. lie issued the first
phase of his verdict in Novem
ber with blistering findings that
accepted nearly all the allega
tions against Microsoft.
