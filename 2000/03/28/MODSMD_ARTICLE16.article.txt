## The
						Stanford Daily Daily to endorse student groups for special fees 
### 
Pubtitktd Since IX9I

THE ASSU'S SPRING General Elec
tion is rapidly approaching, and
one of the matters students will vote
on come April 19 and 20 is whether
to fund each of the 35 student groups seeking
special fees this year.
This year, The Daily will rate each group
on a live-point scale. This will be one compos
ite rating that incorporates an assessment of
the group's effectiveness and its value. By the
term "value," we refer to the benefit the lee
group oilers to the paying constituency, its fis
cal efficiency, and the extent to which it serves
a campus need that would otherwise go
unmet.
Among the factors that will be considered
in assessing effectiveness are whether the

group met last year's stated goals, whether it
budgeted appropriately to achieve those
goals, and whether it has a clear sense of the
constituency it serves.
We will also consider whether its programs
or publications are consistent with its under
standing of its constituency, whether this
year's budget and programming reflect
lessons learned during the past year, and
whether plans for the upcoming year appear
to be realistic.
Our endorsement process aims to serve as
a quality control mechanism. Students place
their faith and their dollars in the hands of
these groups each year, but most do not have
the time to follow up on whether or not
groups fulfill the goals outlined in the Elec

tions Handbook. The Daily endeavors to aid
the Stanford community in evaluating
whether or not the groups have fulfilled their
stated missions.
The Daily Editorial Board plans to meet
with the representatives from each group
before the election. The group representa
tives will prepare a seven-minute presenta
tion, followed by an eight-minute question
and-answer session. At least five of the Board's
members will meet with each group; the
entire Board will discuss each special lee
application and make a recommendation.
The Board will make recommendations on all
groups whether or not individual groups
choose to meet with it.
Sometimes these endorsements are contro-

versial, but making them is still an important
part of I he Daily's mission. The special fee
endorsement process is not a popularity con
test, nor is it a judgement about any group's
intrinsic worth. It is merely a judgement as to
whether the group should be funded through
the special-lee process.
Ideally, the recommendations will help stu
dents think more clearly and critically about
student groups before they vote. However,
these endorsements are not meant to take the
place ol students thinking lor themselves. We
encourage all students to read the Elections
Handbook when it is distributed. The Daily
welcomes responses to the endorsements and
will publish them on a space-available basis
the week prior to the elections.
