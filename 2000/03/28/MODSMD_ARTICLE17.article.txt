# MODERN LIFE IS RUBBISH
## Presidential follies 
### 
Sadly, the presidential campaign is
turning out to be not nearly as
much Inn ;is we had hoped. John
McCain came across as interesting
il unbalanced, periodically coming out of
nowhere with, somewhat daring

announcements like his
diatribe against conser
vative Christian evan
gelists, calling Pat
Robertson and Jerry
Kalwell the "forces ol
evil." I his promised
mail) fruitful weeks of
attack and backlash —
maybe even a return to
the long-standing

debate over the sexual preference of
I inky Winky, the embattled purple Tele
tubby.
Hut a week later McCain formally
issued an apology explaining that the
whole thing was only a joke and. now that
lie's out of the race, it seems we're back to
business .is usual.
< >11 the level ol national politics, where
au\ statement of opinion is bound to alien
ate somebody, the candidates have
become so cautious that they seem ham
strung. In living to avoid every possible
misstep, thev wind up not saying much of
anvthing; their political agendas are
coin lied in s.ilr, non-threatening language
about "values" and "vision," and the only
thing they can safely attack is one another.
McCain mitigated his "forces of evil"
remark by explaining that it was made in
the tone of his Luke Skywalker alter ego.
()ne of his staple analogies during his two
months of fame was to compare himself
to the voting Jedi speeding away from the
exploding Death Star.
I he metaphor was a little confused,
since it was unclear exactly what the
Death Star was supposed to represent —
is Americ a's core about to blow? — but it
does highlight how badly we seem to
need heroes.
Looking at the c andidates we have left,
the cynical side of conventional wisdom
holds that Al Core is robot and Ceorge
V\'. Bush is a buffoon. It's hard to get
excited about either; there haven't even
been any vaguely amusing incidents like
Jimmy Carter's anecdote about fending
off a vie ious aquatic rabbit during a boat
ing trip.
Civen the tepid state of national
affairs, where clo we turn for inspiration?
I he answer, of course, is the trusty
underground. 1 here's entertainment
and solace aplenty in exploring those
fringe candidates who will never win the
election — though it's kind of fun to think
about.
First off. there's Jello Hiafra, former

singer for the Dead Kennedys and owner
of the Alternative Tentacles record label.
Nominated as a Green Party candidate,
his platform highlights include enacting a
maximum wage, abolishing the military
and shilling thu U.S. government to par
liamentary rule.
I bis time around there's nothing as
attention-getting as Biafra's 1979 cam
paign for San Francisco mayor, where his
platform included requiring businessmen
to wear clown suits downtown, but he's
still doing anti-establishment punk
proud.
Then there's John Hagelin, Ph.D., a
renowned quantum physicist who is run
ning on the combined Reform Party and
Natural Law Party tickets.
I laving explored the mysteries of sub
atomic particles and dark matter, he's
now turning his efforts to the far murkier
world of election politics, running on a
platform that principally involves elimi
nating genetically engineered food. Odd?
Certainly, but he's been trouncing Pat
Buchanan in recent Reform Party polls,
and it's not so long ago that, for unclear
reasons, some people took Buchanan
seriously.
Filmmaker Jim Taylor is also running,
though his campaign seems mainly an
excuse to make a documentary; "Run
I Ims Idiot" is scheduled lot a fall 2000
release.
Taylor's stated goal is primarily to call
attention to the absurdities of the political
process, which is really what independent
campaigning is all about. The people who
have nominated their hamsters at
www.hamsterforpresident.com would
presumably give the same reason, though
privately we might say that they just don't
get out enough. (And yes, those hamsters
on their frontpage graphic are doing
exactly what you think.)
It never hurts to buck the system a little,
particularly in a political arena where the
squabbling has gotten so petty that Bill
(llinton has had to step in as a sort of father
figure, asking the candidates to "tone
down" their personal attacks. It remains to
be seen whether anyone will listen.
II there are any forces of evil out there,
they probably lie in the electorate's dis
taste at seeing yet another batch of mid
dle-aged men in suits raking each other
over the coals about things they may or
may not have said in the early 1980s.
Solutions are always difficult, but Biafra's
c lown suit proposal might not be a bad
place to start.
Run this idiot, indeed.
