Racism a real issue everywhere
Jon Kaplan's letter ("Racism at Stan
ford") in the March 3 Daily presented a
hard topic for Stanford students to talk

about in stark and candid terms. I wanted
to applaud Jon lor having the courage to
send in a letter about ilie incident he wit
nessed. I'm saddened In what he saw and
leading the lettei made me feel physical
ly ill.
I am <i senior at Stanford, I'm black,
and I'm female. I've had "hidden" securi
ty follow me for ten minutes in the Stan
lord Bookstore in the Micro Disc depart
ment. I look at the keyboards, he's five feet
from me looking at disks. I wander over to
wrist supports, he's looking at ethernet
cables, glancing at me every time I touch
inv pockets. I pset and wanting to throw
my stalker oil guard, I asked, "Does this
mouse have a PS/2 connector?" He
responded, "I'm actually security," —
really? — "Ask her."
In my three and half years here, I've
been the (ireek Judicial Board Chair and
a head sophomore assistant for Sopho
more College twice. I'm writing an honors
thesis and I am the current Inter Sorority
Council President. Yet, when I walk
around this campus, I wonder if the only
thing that matters is the color of my skin
rather than the type of person I am or
how much I love Stanford. I don't know
sometimes.
In response to the questions Jon raised,
I often think it is the affluent and capable
that assume that everything is fine. Racism
exists but not here. It is someone else's
problem. It is over there. It does happen
here and you don't need to be a minority
in order to see or feel it.
\\ hat saddens me is that students seem
stilled about questioning it. I wish that
young man had pressed the cop to give a
better response or gotten his badge num
ber. With that optimism conies a realistic
pessimism that reminds me that 1) the
officer could have used force or arrest this
young man il provoked or if he felt the
young man was giving him lip service and
2) reporting this cop means that the case
will have to be filed, reviewed, and inves
tigated by the same system that created a
bigot in the first place.
My aim with this letter is to encourage
I lie Daily to write more stories that pre
sent these "stick)" situations and encour
age the student body to use a free, open,
and widely distributed source like The
Daily to talk about "sticky" issues.
Racism is one of those topics that
makes people uncomfortable, but what
are we doing to make it go away? 1 argue
that combating racism means talking
about it as a constant presence in our soci
ety rather than an occasional visitor. That
cop was racist before he stopped the
young man that weekend. It was the act of
being discriminatory that suddenly made
his assumptions and fear about black men

racist. But curbing assumptions and fear
about black men can help us defeat
racism. I have lots of opinions on this sub
ject, however, I wonder why more stu
dents do not use The Daily as a forum to
state their opinions or help shape one?
Sticky issues are occasionally men
tioned in The Daily. What do 1 mean by
sticky? Queer, bigot, black, white, whore,
virgin, sex, God, womyn/woman,
"racial/gender/class/diversity," left-wing,
right-wing and the list continues. When
these words are said, I can see some peo
ple silently sighing, "Oh no ... one of
"those" discussions," while their level of
discomfort raises significantly.
Sex, politics, and religion: these issues
are controversial and they make people
uncomfortable. However, because these
types of discussions are uncomfortable or
can often end without one solution does
not mean we should not have them. I'm
not left or right... 1 don't care if you are
a libertarian or an environmentalist, but
discussing differences is critical to under
standing those differences.
Intellectual growth is not only about
being able to verbalize the function of the
market in industrialized societies or what
makes Kantian ethics unique. It is also
about discovering other people's positions
and defining your opinion, shaping some
thing amorphous into a voice with very
defined edges. 1 see this happening at
Stanford — 1 just wish it were to a much
larger degree.
The Daily has a responsibility to create
and foster a space in order for students to
do this. I worry when Pi Phi receiving
housing makes the cover of The Daily
four days in a row, yet not a single Black
Liberation Month or Asian-American His
tory Month article graced the cover of
The Daily once.
This is not to say that the Pi Phi hous
ing decision does not warrant front-page
coverage. On the contrary, as a leader in

the Greek community I encourage dia
logue and discussion about such a historic
event. I think it is an example of what 1
am talking about. The amount of
response from students and discussion
about campus has really made me think
about the assumptions I've made Howev
er, there are a million stories on this cam
pus. Let one of the others find their way
into the paper as well.
1 don't think it is anyone's best interest
for The Daily to ask me the same question
ever) day for four days and print my
identical response three times in week in
order to make copy. Go into the dorms,
reach into people's lives, explore the lives
of students and their "conflicts." Incidents
do not need to occur in order for discus
sion like these to be held.
I am optimistic though about the abili
ty of Stanford to at least talk about these
issues once they are introduced.

School choice not a "choice" for poor
I felt compelled to address Greg Page's
article ("School choice debate splits par
ties" March 3) discussing the school
voucher debate. I was upset to see that
Page, in a clearly biased article, repeated
ly called the voucher issue an issue of
"school choice." Unfortunately, the only
students and families that will have
"choice" if vouchers are implemented are
those who have always had choice — that
is, middle and upper class families.
Voucher initiatives generally propose
to offer stipends of several thousand dol
lars to families who wish for their child to
go to a private school if their local public
schools are not performing well. While it
is a nice idea to think that "school vouch
ers should be available to parents in order

that they may place their children in the
best learning environment for their par
ticular needs," as Sen. McCain believes,
vouchers do not do anything to help poor
students whose parents (for whatever rea
son) may not be involved or care about
their education, or even speak English
competently enough to understand their
rights.
In fact, vouchers, by sucking funds
AWAY from the education budget, actual
ly gyp these poorest kids even more of
their right to an education by taking
money from them and giving it to parents
who would probably move their kids to a
private, charter, or magnet school
whether or not they received a voucher.
It is disgusting that many of the people
quoted in Page's article think that it is
appropriate to band-aid the issue of edu
cation with vouchers rather than address
the real issues in our public schools: rais
ing teacher salaries, improving resource
staff, lowering class size, and funding the
purchase of better teaching materials.

Bikers not pedestrians
I'm writing to rebut Ama Ofosu
liarko's letter ("Drivers need to exercise
caution near Florence Moore Hall" March
8). Ama takes offense to Shane Sareli's ref
erence to "idiot bikers" being the source of
traffic accidents on Mayfield Avenue.
Well, Ama, I hate to break it to you, but
the problem IS idiot bikers, and not just
on Mayfield Avenue but all over campus.
It is ironic that Ama brings up the
"rules of the road" in her letter defending
bikers, for it is the disregard of these rules
that makes almost all of the bikers on this
campus idiots in the first place. I'm sure
that everyone who is reading this has seen
one or all of the following: bikers running

stop signs, bikers riding on the sidewalk,
bikers riding on the wrong side of the
street or in the middle of the street, bikers
zipping through congested pedestrian
areas like White Plaza and near the clock
tower, and bikers riding through cross
walks without slowing down or even look
ing to see if the way is clear.
Aina, you're not naive to believe that
pedestrians have the right of way in cross
walks. Hut you seem to be confused on
one major detail: bikers are not pedestri
ans, they are classified as vehicles (look it
up in those "rules of the road"). If you
want to be treated as a pedestrian then
you need to get off your bike and walk it
through the crosswalk. In your letter
describing your accident, you left out one
key detail: Who was at fault? Did you ride
through the crosswalk without looking to
see if a car was coming? If so, your injuries
were unfortunate, but maybe you got
what was coming to you.
Here is my prediction: the accidents at
Mayfield Avenue and other places on
campus will continue until all bikers begin
behaving responsibly. That is to say, the
accidents will never stop happening.
