# Debate continues over Dish parking
## 
### JESSICA TUCKER-MOHL EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Santa Clara Count\ Hoard of
Supervisors recently recommended al
tering, but not eliminating, parking
along Stanford Avenue, raising ques
tions about public access to the Stanford
Foothills.
Many local residents have pushed to
end parking along Stanford Avenue.
But after conducting a studv on the
parking problem, the Countv recom
mended that hikers simply limit their
parking to certain areas of the street.
These recommendations, issued iu
early March, would prohibit parking
from Raimundo Avenue to the Palo
Alto city line, and also along both sides
of Stanford Avenue within f>o yards of
Junipero Sen a Boulevard. The County
would enforce die parking ban with
signs. Santa Clara County Supervisor
Joe Simitian is currently considering
the proposal.
According to Andrew Coe, Stan
ford's Director of Community Rela
tions, these recommendations would

improve emergency access to homes
and create better sight lines for cars at
tempting to turn on Stanford Avenue.
While Coe calls these "good, sound
recommendations," he also said, "we
still wish that the\ would ban all park
ing on Stanford Avenue .... That's the
logical solution for ;ill the satiety issues
that homeowners and safety officials
have raised. We're disappointed they
didn't go | w itli | that.
Some residents and Stanford com
munity members share Coe's reserva
tions.
In a letter authored bv the Stanford
Avenue Action Committee, concerned
community members wrote, "1 1 ] he
County's proposal does not address the

important question of whether the ex
tensive use of the Stanford Avenue ac
cess is sustainable tor the hills." Ihe
committee includes several Stanford
faculty members.
Stanford owns all of the Foothills sur
rounding the Dish and currently per
mits public access. Coe said the Univer
sity is deciding whether it has an obliga
tion to provide parking for hikers.

"We're reviewing our practices with
regard to access [to the Foothills], and
looking at all options," Coe said. "We
are looking at the issues related to ac
cess, if there are steps we ought to take."
According to Coe, based on the most
recent statistics — from 1996-1997 —
1800 people use the Dish each week-

Coe suggests that people use available campus lots,
such as the I residder Union parking lot, for visitor
parking. "Our policy has been to not provide parking
for foothills access, but to provide visitor parking."
