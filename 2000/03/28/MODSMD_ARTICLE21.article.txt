# Men swim to 4th at NCAAs

### KELLIE WIGINTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Overcoming adversity and bat
tling back has Ix'en the name of the
game this season for the Stanford
men's swim team. The Cardinal
carried that theme with it through
out the NCAA Championship meet
this past weekend at the University
Aquatic Center in Minneapolis,
Minn.
After three days of giueling and
dramatic competition, Stanford fin
ished the meet in fourth place, edg
ing out Pacific 10 conference rival
California by half a point. The Car
dinal also came away with an NCAA
champion in Adam Messner, who
captured first in the 200-meter but
terfly.
Despite a slow start in the first
day of competition, the Cardinal
was able to come back and regain a
substantia] amount of momentum
to battle for the fourth-place posi
tion.
"We came out a little bit reac
tionary that first day," said senior
co-captain Kurt Spenser. "We
didn't come out as aggressive as we
wanted to."
And understandably so. Just
three weeks earlier, the Cardinal

men had claimed the Pac-10 Con
ference title in Washington for the
19th year in a row — a winning
streak unparalleled by any other
university or team in the confer
ence. However, the three-week
break in competition may have left
the Cardinal slightly unprepared
for what was to come in the NCAA
meet.
"At the beginning of the year we
have a goals meeting," said junior
Ail-American Messner. "We always
talk about the importance of win
ning NCAAs, but throughout the
year it became apparent that win
ning Pac-lOs was going to be a
chore in itself."
The goal to win the Pac-10
prompted the Cardinal to have
quite possibly its best meet of the
season at the Pac-10 championship.
The Pac-10 championship was
indeed a remarkable accomplish
ment for the Cardinal men, as well
as for the University, but they were
by no means satisfied. The goal of
the NCAA championship re
mained.
The first day of NCAA competi
tion saw strong performances and
fifth-place finishes by both Mess-

ner and junior All-American Steven Brown. Messner
placed fifth in the 400-meter freestyle, while Brown
t(K>k fifth in the 200-meter individual medley.
Also contributing to Stanford's point total was ju
nior All-American Rob Canales, who finished 10th in
t he 200-meter IM, and junior All-American Anthony
Robinson, who finished 16th in the 50-meter freestyle.
Both the 200-meter free relay team and the 400-meter
medley relay team also finished in sixth place, giving
the Cardinal additional points.
Despite these finishes, the Cardinal quickly found
itself trailing in fifth place after the first day of compe
tition. As it has been all year, however, the Cardinal was
more than ready to take on the challenge of making a
comeback.
"As far as our ability as a team goes, we usually get
stronger throughout the meet," Messner said. "We do
a good job outlasting the other teams, and we stay men
tally focused when other teams may get complacent."
"It became pretty clear that there were no teams at
the top making mistakes," Messner said.
The Stanford men came back strong in the second
day of competition, managing to work their way back
up to fourth place. Again, Messner was strong in the
200-meter freestyle, finishing in second place behind
Arizona's three-time consecutive NCAA champion
Ryk Neethling.
Freshman John Waters also contributed, finishing
fourth in the 200-meter fi ee. Brown took seventh in
the 400-meter IM, while freshman Randall Bal tied for
eighth in the 100-meter backstroke.
The Cardinal suffered a devastating blow on Fri
day. The 200-meter medley relay team seemed to
have captured sixth place in the event, which would
have lx?en an additional 26 points for the team total.
However, the Cardinal was disqualified from the event
with a controversial call saying that Spenser had left

early on his leg of the race, leaving the Cardinal point
less for the event.
"It was a very questionable call," Spenser said. "For
most teams that would have been a backbreaker, but it
really just showed the character of our team. When we
get down, we come right back."
After the second day, Texas had pulled away from
the rest of the field with 416 points. Auburn was a far
second place with 291 points, while Arizona held third
with 241/5 points. Four teams, including both Cal and
Stanford, would 1m? battling it out the final day of com
petition for fourth place.
" VVe knew we had to do some pretty amazing things
on Saturday if we were going to compete for the fourth
place spot," Spenser said.
Stanford got the spark it needed when Messner
won the 200-meter butterfly, beating South Carolina
sophomore Zsolt Caspar by .09 seconds. Messner be
came Stanford's first NCAA tidist this year.
The battle for the fourth place spot came down to
the final event — the 400-meter free relay. Stanford
had to finish in at least fourth place in the race to cap
ture the fourth place sport overall.
In the final leg of the relay, freshman John Waters
pulled away from a senior NCAA champion to clinch
the fourth place finish for the Cardinal.
"It was a hugely dramatic and emotional meet for
us," Spenser said. "At the banquet afterwards, our
coach kept saying how it was a fourth-place finish, but
it was a victory for our team."
"We were the only team besides Texas that did a
cheer at the end of the meet," Messner said. "We
usually only do it after we win a dual meet or Pac
10s. But that's how we felt about this meet. Coach
was slapping high fives and patting backs and every
thing."
Not too many teams can win not only a conference
title 19 years in a row, but also finish in the top four at
the NCAA championship four years in a row. But that
is just what this Cardinal team has done, and the mo
mentum will carry it into next season.
"This character will give us lots of strength and ex
perience for next year's team," said Robinson.
