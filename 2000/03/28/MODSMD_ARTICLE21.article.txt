# Men swim to 4th at NCAAs

Overcoming adversity and bat
tling back has Ix'en the name of the
game this season for the Stanford
men's swim team. The Cardinal
carried that theme with it through
out the NCAA Championship meet
this past weekend at the University
Aquatic Center in Minneapolis,
Minn.
After three days of giueling and
dramatic competition, Stanford fin
ished the meet in fourth place, edg
ing out Pacific 10 conference rival
California by half a point. The Car
dinal also came away with an NCAA
champion in Adam Messner, who
captured first in the 200-meter but
terfly.
Despite a slow start in the first
day of competition, the Cardinal
was able to come back and regain a
substantia] amount of momentum
to battle for the fourth-place posi
tion.
"We came out a little bit reac
tionary that first day," said senior
co-captain Kurt Spenser. "We
didn't come out as aggressive as we
wanted to."
And understandably so. Just
three weeks earlier, the Cardinal

men had claimed the Pac-10 Con
ference title in Washington for the
19th year in a row â€” a winning
streak unparalleled by any other
university or team in the confer
ence. However, the three-week
break in competition may have left
the Cardinal slightly unprepared
for what was to come in the NCAA
meet.
"At the beginning of the year we
have a goals meeting," said junior
Ail-American Messner. "We always
talk about the importance of win
ning NCAAs, but throughout the
year it became apparent that win
ning Pac-lOs was going to be a
chore in itself."
The goal to win the Pac-10
prompted the Cardinal to have
quite possibly its best meet of the
season at the Pac-10 championship.
The Pac-10 championship was
indeed a remarkable accomplish
ment for the Cardinal men, as well
as for the University, but they were
by no means satisfied. The goal of
the NCAA championship re
mained.

tion saw strong performances and
fifth-place finishes by both Mess-
