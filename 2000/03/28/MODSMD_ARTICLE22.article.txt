### JONATHAN STULL STAFF WRITER 
The world of college basketball is
a fickle place. As Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery likes to
say, "It builds you up to tear you
down."
Montgomery and Stanford
should know something about that
because, after an 11-0 start built a
team with little preseason hype into
the No. 1 team in the nation, a loss
to the previously underachieving
North Carolina Tar Heels in the
second round of the NCIAA Tour
nament gave the doubters and the
critics more than enough ammuni
tion.
"As soon as you become number
one, there's nothing but a free-fall
for you unless you win the National
Championship," Montgomery
said. "This is the third season [after
the preseason and conference sea
sons], but it's the one that makes or
breaks you."
Two years ago, as an unheralded
Stanford team made a magical trip
to the Final Four in San Antonio,
the tournament made Stanford.
Overnight, Palo Alto was on the col

lege basketball map. The past two
seasons, it has broken the Cardinal
— this year even more so than last.
"We were at the end of our rope
last year, we were tired and we'd
lost three kids [Jarron Collins,
Jason Collins and Ryan Mendez]
that were critical to us that we start
ed the year with," Montgomery
said. "And we were beingjudged on
the year before when we'd gotten a
real good run to the Final Four."
Even with four new starters and
eight freshman on the roster, the
2000 edition of Stanford basketball
had a better chance to mount the
podium in Indianapolis. After
rolling through the Pacific 10 Con
ference and accumulating a school
best 26-3 record, this team was per
haps the deepest and most talented
team in school history.
"This basketball team was more
capable," Montgomery said. "This
year's team was capable of winning
on Sunday and next Friday and
winning next Sunday [to get to the
Final Four]. We were not running
on empty, we were ready to go. But
there's still the issue of perfor
mance."
And Sunday against the Far

Heels, Stanford didn't perform, at
least not at the level it had all year.
During the regular season, the
Cardinal shot over 47 percent from
the field and 40 percent from be
yond the arc while holding oppo

nents to an NCAA-record-low 35.2
percent from the field and 29.7 per
cent on three-pointers.

Though Moseley said the team's
goal all along was to win a National

would have given Stanford a

wins over Duke and Auburn, after
Stanford began to roll up the
largest average victory margin in
the nation, after the Cardinal blast
ed California 101-50 and USC 111-
68, after Stanford had come so far,
a loss to Carolina and an early exit
from the Tournament hurt badly.
"Everything built up for the
NCAA Tournament," said Mose

seasons, it has broken the Cardinal
— this year even more so than last.
"We were at the end of our rope
last year, we were tired and we'd
lost three kids [Jarron Collins,
Jason Collins and Ryan Mendez]
that were critical to us that we start
ed the year with," Montgomery
said. "And we were beingjudged on
the year before when we'd gotten a
real good run to the Final Four."
Even with four new starters and
eight freshman on the roster, the
2000 edition of Stanford basketball
had a better chance to mount the
podium in Indianapolis. After
rolling through the Pacific 10 Con
ference and accumulating a school
best 26-3 record, this team was per
haps the deepest and most talented
team in school history.
"This basketball team was more
capable," Montgomery said. "This
year's team was capable of winning
on Sunday and next Friday and
winning next Sunday [to get to the
Final Four]. We were not running
on empty, we were ready to go. But
there's still the issue of perfor
mance."
And Sunday against the Far

Heels, Stanford didn't perform, at
least not at the level it had all year.
During the regular season, the
Cardinal shot over 47 percent from
the field and 40 percent from be
yond the arc while holding oppo

nents to an NCAA-record-low 35.2
percent from the field and 29.7 per
cent on three-pointers.
Sunday, it was the exact oppo-

foresight, on the other hand, is a
lot more blurry. And back in Octo
ber, few had the power to predict
Stanford's phenominal season.

Though Moseley said the team's
goal all along was to win a National
Championship this season, few
would have given Stanford a
chance six months ago. But after
wins over Duke and Auburn, after
Stanford began to roll up the
largest average victory margin in
the nation, after the Cardinal blast
ed California 101-50 and USC 111-
68, after Stanford had come so far,
a loss to Carolina and an early exit
from the Tournament hurt badly.
"Everything built up for the
NCAA Tournament," said Mose

hurts when you lose and you look in
the eyes of your teammates and
they have tears in their eyes. It sucks
going out like this. But what can
you do?"
