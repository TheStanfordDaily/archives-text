(Competing 011 its home turf, 11 1**
Stanford it-iu tc\iill fought hard
to secure a fourth-place finish —
and one individual title — in the
NCAA Fencing Championships
Fhursda\ through Sunday at
Maples Pavilion.
"We fought realh hard — it was
a lough tournament this yeai," said
senior Alex Wood, the team cap
tain. "1 thought we fenced realh
well — we were 011K eight points
behind second place."
The team brought a lull com
plement of fencers to the tourna
ment. Iwo people competed in
each of six categories: men sand
women's epee, foil and sabre. The
women's sabi ec < mi pet it i« >11 was the
first ever NCAA clritupion.ship in
that event.
David LiValle, a sopho
more who took I Oth in the sabre
competition, characterized the
sport as "similar to chess in that
you're constantlv planning what
vour next move is going to be. con
stantlv trving to pla\ off each other.
.. .It takes quick reflexes, hand-eye
coordination and a lot of mental
toughness."'
I he team's strong showing was
led by a few outstanding perfor
mances. In the men's foil finals,
sophomore Felix Reichling beat
fencers from powerhouses Penn
State and Not re Dame to defend
his NCAA title. "I was realh
glad I could repeat." Reichling
said, " flie field this vear was much
stronger — some of the best people
in fencingare in college right now."
Another leadei was senior
Monique De Bruin, who also came
into the tournament as a defending
champion. De Bruin, who fences
women's foil, emerged undefeated
from a grueling 23-bout round
robin tournament onh to lose in
the finals bv a mere two touches to
Princeton's Fva Petschnigg.
"1 was happv. 1 tried to win as
many bouts as 1 could for the
team," De Bruin said. "This was my
last one — I just wanted to see what
I could do and fence my best one
last time."
Though Reichling and De
Bruin were the only two to make it
to the finals round, the team placed
strongly in most events, including a
number of top-10 finishers. The
closest was Wood, who was tied

with fourth-place finisher Cang Lu
of Penn State in the men's foil com
petition. An agonizingly small mar
gin — 97 touches to Lu's 99 — kept
him at fifth. Senior Eric Tribbett
was in a similar situation, missing
the epee finals by three touches.
In the women's foil, senior Ute
Breden took eighth. Two Stanford
fencers competed in women's
sabre, which was an NCAA event
for the first time this year. Katie
Stephan and Diane Buodalis
placed 15th and 21 st, respectively.
The home advantage helped the
team overcome a handicap that has

long plagued the program: loca
tion. Stanford has the strongest
fencing program on the West
Coast, but the sport remains domi
nated by East Coast schools. Stan
ford was the only West Coast school
to compete in the tournament.
"The hardest part is being on the
West Coast and not being able to fly
back," said junior Tom Hunt, who
placed 21st in men's epee. "We de
stroy everybody in the Western re
gion, but there's a lot of tough
schools back east we only get to
compete against once, and they all
get to compete against each other."
