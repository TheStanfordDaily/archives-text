Welcome to (lie Pacific 10 ( in
ference. 2000 edition.
In college softball. the Pac-10 is
the creme-de-la-creme.
I lie best of the best.
As good as ii gets.
The conference is host totlie top
five teams in the country. I lie
other three teams round out at No.
8, 12 and 2.'}.
.And the Pac-10 opener did the
conference justice.
No one could have scripted a
iViore intense conference kick-off
series than that between No. IC al
ifbrnia ('J7-5, 1-1 Pac-10) and No. 8
Stanford (MO-4, I -1). The matchup
was the only Pac-10 action of the
weekend, as all oilier squads open
conference play next weekend.
Saturday saw the Cardinal suf
fer a ()-. r > heartbreaking 12 inning
loss to the Bears in Berkeley.
But the resilient Stanford squad
bounced back with one of its best
showings of the season to silence
the Bears 2-0 at the Stanford soli
ball complex.

Iii game one. Stanford cruised
through the first five and a halt in

However, the Bears earned all

of the season clc spiie onh allowing
only one earned run.
Stanford showed its character,
however, rebounding with a solid
2-0 victory Sunday.
With an identical lineup, the
Cardinal got on the board early and
never looked back. After the team
put up two runs in the first inning,
Stanford's pitching never looked
back.
Sorenson (15-3) again started
t he game, and gave up a mere three
hits in five innings to earn the win.

LeCocq pitched a perfect final two
innings to earn her fourth save of
the season.
After allowing the game winner
the day before, LeCocq's perfor
mance was particularly significant.
"Maureen [LeCocq] was fired
up today," said senior catcher Kel
lie Wiginton of her pitcher. "She is
a fighter and she took it to them —
she wasn't going to let it happen
again."
LeCocq credited her team
mates, and Stanford head coach
John Rittman agreed.
"()ur good defense and pitching

keeps us in the game," lie said. "We
must execute seven innings. We
can't lapse an inning in this confer
ence."
Yesterday, the Cardinal earned
a non-conference victory with its 6-
2 defeat of UC-Santa Barbara (14-
H).
The Cardinal will have little
down-time as it returns to action
against two of the top three teams in
the nation. Friday will bring No. 1
Washington to town, and Saturday
and Sunday the Cardinal will face
No. 3 UCLA.
Welcome to the Pac-10.
