Notching its 12th 20-win sea
son in the histon of the program
and its 1 111i second-round N( AA
tournament appearance, the (!ar
dinal women's basketball team
(21-9, 13-5 Pacific 10 Conference)
has nothing to be ashamed of.
Stanford's second-place tie with
Arizona in the tight Pac-10 rat e saw
the women fiill just one win short ol
theii goal to be confei eiu e ( hampi
ous. As the uiiifoi ms are put awa\

guards prepare to leave the Farm,
the marks which the 1999-2000
squad has left on the esteemed tra
dition of' Stanford Basketball can be
i cc < ignixed.
I'erhaps first and foremost, this
team will be remembered for iis
three-point shot. I he 213 three
pointers made this year wiped out
the team's old single-season
record of 205. established in 1990-
'97. I hat squad played a full six
games more than this yeai 's team.
I he (Cardinal shot 10.<S perc;ent

Sophomore Lauren St. Clair and

than one occasion. Moos led all
scorers on the Stanford squad, av
eraging 12.4 points pel game.

24 ()regon on Jan. 15.
Stanford was clown 26 points
against the Ducks and mounted
the biggest comeback in Cardinal
history as the women outscored
Oregon 68-26 in the closing 24
minutes to win 78-62.
As the I'ac -10 season rounded

out, (his year's (iardinal st|uad fell
into a frustrating routine. The
women dropped the first game on
each of lour conference road trips

and came back to win each second
game. While Stanford struggled
at times with some of teams at the
bottom of the Pac-10 standings
such as Arizona State and Wash
ington, it was able to win some
critical games to remain among
the top teams in the Pac-10.
As the team's only new player,
Carey earned Pac-10 Freshman of
the Year honors. Senior Milena
Flores was awarded her second
straight appointment to the All-
Pac-10 team, while Moos and St.
Clair received honorable mention
conference honors.
Though the Cardinal's stint in
the NCAA tournament was rather
brief, the team pulled off an in
tense overtime win against No. 8
seeded Michigan in the first
round in the West. The team then
fell to top-seeded Georgia.
Throughout Stanford's turbu
lent season, the one player who
experienced all the tips and
downs was the point guard Flores.
Fhe beautiful dish passes, her
stunning drives and impressive
shooting have been a dependable
force for the Cardinal all season,
and throughout Mores' four years
on the Farm.
Now she is gone, along with fel
low seniors Christina Batastini
and Yvonne Gbalazeh. But for the
returners, the quest begins now.
"This second our team needs to
dec ide where we want to go next
year," said Carey. "If we want to
step up the national level and make
the Final Four, we need to get on
the track and in the weight room
right now and do whatever it
takes."
