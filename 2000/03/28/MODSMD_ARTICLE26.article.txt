# Baseball takes two of three
## Justin Wayne snaps 17-game win streak in Pac-10 opening loss 
### BRETT KAUFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
tor 419 days, Stanford junior
Justin Wayne was as close as one
can get to perfection. But Friday
night the Arizona Wildcats, behind
the arm of sophomore ace Ben
Diggins, spoiled the No. 2 Cardi
nal s Pacific 10 Conference opener
and Wayne's bid for his 17th con
secutive victory on the mound.
The 8-5 loss at Sunken Dia
mond to open league play
dropped Wayne's season record to
6-1 and was only his second loss in
his three-year Stanford career. He
had not lost since his first start of
his sophomore season against
Fresno State on January 30, 1999.
Wayne also failed to break the
Pac-10 record for consecutive wins
he equaled last weekend with a win
over then-No. 12 USC. He didn't
help himself get off to a solid start
against the Wildcats, dropping a
throw from senior first baseman
Craig Thompson to put the first
batter of the ballganie on base.
1 he error led to two first-inning
runs for Arizona, which added
three more in the sixth and forced
Wayne out of the game with two
men on base in the seventh. Both
runners scored later in the inning
against sophomore reliever Jason
Luker.
Arizona "put guys in running
positions early in the
innings. . .and 1 wasn't taking that
away from them," Wayne said.
"Basically, it was just a really poor
job of pitching."
While Wayne said he aims to
help the team win every time he
stepson the hill, head coach Mark
Marquess believes that the streak
finally coining to an end will help
relieve his junior of some mount
ing pressure.
"I'd just as soon have him not
worrying about [the streak], so it

may be a blessing in disguise," lie
said.
Wayne's opponent, Diggins,
did not hold up his end of the
prospective pitching duel between
two potential top-10 selections in
the professional draft this sum
mer. He allowed five Stanford
runs, hut his offense gave him
enough support to keep his season
record perfect at 7-0.
Diggins "didn't have a stellar
night either, hut he came up big in
some situations that 1 couldn't,"
Wayne said.
The Cardinal bounced back
from their ace's misstep, winning
the next two games against Ari
zona at Sunken Diamond to take
the series. However, the lone loss
did drop the Cardinal from the
No. 1 ranking it enjoyed for just
one week following a series with
USC. Junior Jason Young record
ed his first complete game of the
season on Saturday, collecting a
season-high 1 1 strikeouts en route
to a (i-4 Stanford win.
"This was a huge victory com
ing off last night's loss," said
Young, who allowed four runs off
nine hits. "1 take pride in pitching
complete games. Having to fight
like I did today will help build me
back to where 1 was last year. It's
exciting to start to get back to that
point."
Young lost his spot atop the
Stanford rotation when lie injured
his right shoulder early in the sea
son. However, he has battled back
to regain the form that made him
an All-America selection as a
sophomore. Despite struggling at
times this season, Young holds a 3-
0 record and a 3.98 KRA.
Young "closes games out and
gets stronger as he goes. He gets
after it and that's why I might stay
with him a little longer than 1 do
with some other pitchers," Mar
quess said.
Young benefited from the
resurgent Cardinal bats, which
had slumped dining non-confer
ence play. Senior Kdmund Muth
and junior Joe Borchard each
homered to earn the offensive

load for Stanford oil Saturday.
It was Borchard's second
straight game with a home run, as
well as his third in four games. The
highly touted junior hit only two
home runs in his first 20 games,
but began to gel hot in the team's
final non-conference series of the
season against USC.
" I've been making more contact
over the lasi couple weeks. . .and
some balls are going through for
me, so it's been nice," Bore hard
said.
Borchard worked with Mar
quess and assistant coach Dean
Stotz over the last few weeks, tin
kering with his swing from both
sides to improve his sight of the
ball and his ability to make solid
contact every time at bat.
The work has paid off thus far,
as the junior's confidence at the
plate has returned to can y him to
the offensive potential expected of
him before the season.
"My approach is a lot different,"
he said. "When 1 go to the plate 1
feel like 1 can get a hit, whereas be
fore I wasn't very confident."
Marquess echoed the state
ment. "I'm really comfortable with
[Borchard] now," he said. "He's
really worked hard to get his
stroke back...He's really starting to
pick it up."
On Sunday, Marquess decided
to start sophomore Mike Gosling
in place of fellow sophomore Brian
Sager, who has struggled in his last
several outings. Gosling struck out
12 men in relief of Sager the week
before against the Trojans,
prompting the head coach to use
him as Sunday's starter against
Arizona.
Marquess said he had no issues
moving Gosling into the starting
role because he "pitched so super
last weekend, and he's started ear
lier in his career."
1 lie transition lot Stanford's
best relief hurler went smoothly, as
Gosling was two onts short of a
complete game in a one-run, two
hit effort on the mound that led to
a 7-1 win. He left the game one
strikeout shy of the personal best

he set the week before against
use.
"1 had a little bit of first-inning
jitters," Gosling said of his 112 irst start
of the year. "But in the second in
ning I realized it's just like any
other outing and I took the same
approach that 1 always do."
Gosling will be used as the third
Stanford starter, pushing Sager to
a bullpen role until he begins to
pitch like the dominating starter
that opened the season for the
Cardinal.
"I've worked all fall towards be
coming a starter," Gosling said.
"The way our pitching is right
now, it's tough to fight for a spot
around here but if I could do that,
it would be wonderful."
Sophomore Jason Van Mee
tren led the offensive attack, gath
ering two RBls and scoring twice
for Stanford. I lis kev two-out, two-
RBI single in the third inning gave
the Cardinal a (»-1 lead, and be

hind (iosling's arm Stanford never
looked back.
"We hit the ball as well as we
have in the last three or four weeks
today," Marquess said.
"Ever since the break [for final
exams] we've been playing with a
lot more confidence and swinging
the bat a lot better," Borchard said.
Stanford's two wins over the
weekend followed three out of
four wins over the last two weeks.
The Cardinal won the first and
third game of a non-conference se
ries with USC last weekend, 4-3
and 11-4, behind solid pitching
performances from Wayne and
Gosling.
Mntli homered twice in the
final game against the Trojans and
tallied one more against Arizona,
bringing his season total to seven
to lead the team.
I lie USC ollense last Saturday
proved to be too much for Young
and a host of other (Cardinal pile ti

ers. scoring 1 1 runs on nine hits in
the game. Freshman Anthony
Lunetta went 3-for-6 with three
doubles and four RBIs to lead the
Trojans to an I 1-7 victory.
I o conclude the preseason,
Stanford routed St. Mary's on the
road, 11-3, in a Tuesday matinee.
Sophomore Mike Wodnicki won
his first game of the year as he and
four other Cardinal pitchers com
bined to allow just eight hits for the
(lales.
Stanford continues to roll as
conference play begins, and each
weekend will bring a new test for
the Cardinal in one of the toughest
leagues in the nation. Tuesday
night, St. Mary's invades Sunken
Diamond for a night game to settle
the score with the Cardinal. Then
Stanford travels to Tempe, Ariz.,
to take on the seventh-ranked Sun
Devils of Arizona State in a battle
between the Pac-10's two best
teams.

through most of the preseason, came alive just in time to spark Stanford to a pair of wins in the first series of Pacific

plate has returned to can y him to
the offensive potential expected of
him before the season.
"My approach is a lot different,"
he said. "When 1 go to the plate 1
feel like 1 can get a hit, whereas be
fore I wasn't very confident."
Marquess echoed the state
ment. "I'm really comfortable with
[Borchard] now," he said. "He's
really worked hard to get his
stroke back...He's really starting to
pick it up."
On Sunday, Marquess decided
to start sophomore Mike Gosling
in place of fellow sophomore Brian
Sager, who has struggled in his last
several outings. Gosling struck out
12 men in relief of Sager the week
before against the Trojans,
prompting the head coach to use
him as Sunday's starter against
Arizona.
Marquess said he had no issues
moving Gosling into the starting
role because he "pitched so super
last weekend, and he's started ear
lier in his career."
1 lie transition lot Stanford's
best relief hurler went smoothly, as
Gosling was two onts short of a
complete game in a one-run, two
hit effort on the mound that led to
a 7-1 win. He left the game one
strikeout shy of the personal best

he set the week before against
use.
"1 had a little bit of first-inning
jitters," Gosling said of his 112 irst start
of the year. "But in the second in
ning I realized it's just like any
other outing and I took the same
approach that 1 always do."
Gosling will be used as the third
Stanford starter, pushing Sager to
a bullpen role until he begins to
pitch like the dominating starter
that opened the season for the
Cardinal.
"I've worked all fall towards be
coming a starter," Gosling said.
"The way our pitching is right
now, it's tough to fight for a spot
around here but if I could do that,
it would be wonderful."
Sophomore Jason Van Mee
tren led the offensive attack, gath
ering two RBls and scoring twice
for Stanford. I lis kev two-out, two-
RBI single in the third inning gave
the Cardinal a (»-1 lead, and be

hind (iosling's arm Stanford never
looked back.
"We hit the ball as well as we
have in the last three or four weeks
today," Marquess said.
"Ever since the break [for final
exams] we've been playing with a
lot more confidence and swinging
the bat a lot better," Borchard said.
Stanford's two wins over the
weekend followed three out of
four wins over the last two weeks.
The Cardinal won the first and
third game of a non-conference se
ries with USC last weekend, 4-3
and 11-4, behind solid pitching
performances from Wayne and
Gosling.
Mntli homered twice in the
final game against the Trojans and
tallied one more against Arizona,
bringing his season total to seven
to lead the team.
I lie USC ollense last Saturday
proved to be too much for Young
and a host of other (Cardinal pile ti

ers. scoring 1 1 runs on nine hits in
the game. Freshman Anthony
Lunetta went 3-for-6 with three
doubles and four RBIs to lead the
Trojans to an I 1-7 victory.
I o conclude the preseason,
Stanford routed St. Mary's on the
road, 11-3, in a Tuesday matinee.
Sophomore Mike Wodnicki won
his first game of the year as he and
four other Cardinal pitchers com
bined to allow just eight hits for the
(lales.
Stanford continues to roll as
conference play begins, and each
weekend will bring a new test for
the Cardinal in one of the toughest
leagues in the nation. Tuesday
night, St. Mary's invades Sunken
Diamond for a night game to settle
the score with the Cardinal. Then
Stanford travels to Tempe, Ariz.,
to take on the seventh-ranked Sun
Devils of Arizona State in a battle
between the Pac-10's two best
teams.


Junior Joe Borchard tags the bag after a headfirst dive against Arizona last weekend. Borchard's bat, dormant
through most of the preseason, came alive just in time to spark Stanford to a pair of wins in the first series of Pacific
10 Conference play.
tor 419 days, Stanford junior
Justin Wayne was as close as one
can get to perfection. But Friday
night the Arizona Wildcats, behind
the arm of sophomore ace Ben
Diggins, spoiled the No. 2 Cardi
nal s Pacific 10 Conference opener
and Wayne's bid for his 17th con
secutive victory on the mound.
The 8-5 loss at Sunken Dia
mond to open league play
dropped Wayne's season record to
6-1 and was only his second loss in
his three-year Stanford career. He
had not lost since his first start of
his sophomore season against
Fresno State on January 30, 1999.
Wayne also failed to break the
Pac-10 record for consecutive wins
he equaled last weekend with a win
over then-No. 12 USC. He didn't
help himself get off to a solid start
against the Wildcats, dropping a
throw from senior first baseman
Craig Thompson to put the first
batter of the ballganie on base.
1 he error led to two first-inning
runs for Arizona, which added
three more in the sixth and forced
Wayne out of the game with two
men on base in the seventh. Both
runners scored later in the inning
against sophomore reliever Jason
Luker.
Arizona "put guys in running
positions early in the
innings. . .and 1 wasn't taking that
away from them," Wayne said.
"Basically, it was just a really poor
job of pitching."
While Wayne said he aims to
help the team win every time he
stepson the hill, head coach Mark
Marquess believes that the streak
finally coining to an end will help
relieve his junior of some mount
ing pressure.
"I'd just as soon have him not
worrying about [the streak], so it

may be a blessing in disguise," lie
said.
Wayne's opponent, Diggins,
did not hold up his end of the
prospective pitching duel between
two potential top-10 selections in
the professional draft this sum
mer. He allowed five Stanford
runs, hut his offense gave him
enough support to keep his season
record perfect at 7-0.
Diggins "didn't have a stellar
night either, hut he came up big in
some situations that 1 couldn't,"
Wayne said.
The Cardinal bounced back
from their ace's misstep, winning
the next two games against Ari
zona at Sunken Diamond to take
the series. However, the lone loss
did drop the Cardinal from the
No. 1 ranking it enjoyed for just
one week following a series with
USC. Junior Jason Young record
ed his first complete game of the
season on Saturday, collecting a
season-high 1 1 strikeouts en route
to a (i-4 Stanford win.
"This was a huge victory com
ing off last night's loss," said
Young, who allowed four runs off
nine hits. "1 take pride in pitching
complete games. Having to fight
like I did today will help build me
back to where 1 was last year. It's
exciting to start to get back to that
point."
Young lost his spot atop the
Stanford rotation when lie injured
his right shoulder early in the sea
son. However, he has battled back
to regain the form that made him
an All-America selection as a
sophomore. Despite struggling at
times this season, Young holds a 3-
0 record and a 3.98 KRA.
Young "closes games out and
gets stronger as he goes. He gets
after it and that's why I might stay
with him a little longer than 1 do
with some other pitchers," Mar
quess said.
Young benefited from the
resurgent Cardinal bats, which
had slumped dining non-confer
ence play. Senior Kdmund Muth
and junior Joe Borchard each
homered to earn the offensive

load for Stanford oil Saturday.
It was Borchard's second
straight game with a home run, as
well as his third in four games. The
highly touted junior hit only two
home runs in his first 20 games,
but began to gel hot in the team's
final non-conference series of the
season against USC.
" I've been making more contact
over the lasi couple weeks. . .and
some balls are going through for
me, so it's been nice," Bore hard
said.
Borchard worked with Mar
quess and assistant coach Dean
Stotz over the last few weeks, tin
kering with his swing from both
sides to improve his sight of the
ball and his ability to make solid
contact every time at bat.
The work has paid off thus far,
as the junior's confidence at the
plate has returned to can y him to
the offensive potential expected of
him before the season.
"My approach is a lot different,"
he said. "When 1 go to the plate 1
