### SANDRA UPSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In light of the proceedings regarding Stan
ford's potential ownership of the streets of Reno,
one might wonder what other odd properties
and possessions Stanford owns.
Students often have no idea of some of the ec
centric gifts that Stanford lias received over the
years fiom alumni and other benefactors.
I hough the Legal Office refused to comment
on Stanford's disputed ow netship ol the streets of
Reno, there are still a number of other bizarre
items to whic li Stanford can lav claim. Some more
outlandish examples include working ranches,
worthless lanci in the Mojave Desert and gold

mines.
Other gilts to the University have included
bars, hook royalties, cars, gas leases, office build
ings, residences and boats.
According to Dave Glen, the division director
of the Stanford Development Office, "Most
everything that is given to the University is sold
or otherwise converted to cash to carry out the
purposes of the gift."
Some things, however, Stanford chooses to re
tain, such as Sierra (lamp and the Stanford Ski
Chalet.
"We try to be careful about accepting all assets
in an effort to avoid receiving assets that will not
benefit the University, for example, contaminat
ed real property," said Glen.
