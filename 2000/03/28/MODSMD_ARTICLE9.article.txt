"Increased lighting on campus will

rector of the Women's Center.
Both Mills and Popell were careful
to add that increased lighting alone
does not eliminate safety risks.
Just because a place is well lit, Mills
said, people shouldn't necessarily trav

"We don't want people to get an
artificial sense of security so that they
put themselves at risk," Popell said.
"We don't want to create an environ
ment in which people take unneces

Some students expressed concern
about misdirected lighting resulting
from increasing the numbers and loca
tions of safety lamps, but Mills said it
was not a main concern for the com
mission.
"It's hard to say that [bothersome
lighting] outweighs someone's safety,
but there are ways to make everyone
happy," Mills said.
Several survey respondents also
suggested installing reflective caps on
existing lighting fixtures to efficiently
focus light toward the ground.
