Did You Get a Transplant?
American
Red Cross
N
If you're the recipient of an
organ or tissue transplant, we
want to hear from you.
The American Red Cross
Transplant Awareness Program
is coming to Stanford. We need
students who've received
transplants and are willing to
share their stories. By stepping
forward, you can help save the
lives of the more than 100,000
people awaiting transplants.
Please call us today at
1-800-582-5033!
