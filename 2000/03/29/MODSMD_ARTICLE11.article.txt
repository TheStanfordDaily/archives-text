# Conley testifies in discrimination suit
## 
### FRANK POLLOCK 
The discrimination case brought forward by
Colleen Crangle against Stanford I niversity is
nearing a close.
Crangle, a former senior it-search scientist at
a Medical School laboratory, claims that the
Medical School laid her oil in 1997 in retaliation
for complaints she had made about gender dis
crimination.
Medical School Neurosurgery Prof. Frances
(onley testified on Monday that discrimination
against female scholars at the Medical School is
widespread.
Federal District Court Judge James Ware
ruled several months ago that no ac tual gender
discrimination occurred in (j angle's laborato
ry, but the issue of retaliation remained.
Those bringing < barges of gender disc rimi
nation are immune b\ law from retaliation from
that organization i! the basis of their allegations
is not specious.
"My case shows how extremely hard it is to
make c hanges because of what happens when a
woman speaks out," (jangle said.
Fven when a woman makes discrimination
complaints cautiously and carefully, "the re
sponse can be quite brutal," ( Tangle said.
(a angle is one of many who have reported

gender and minorit) discrimination by the I ni
versity to the Labor Department.
Ware allowed (onley to testify on (jangle's
behalf in order to provide the jury with back
ground information on the environment in
which (a angle worked.
I le wanted to see whether it was reasonable
for (jangle to have brought forth charges of
discrimination and to weigh "whether there
were complaints of treatment [of women] that
should have caused staff to respond" to (iran
gle's complaints. Ware said in court, according
to I lie San |ose Mercury News.
Whether Conley should be allowed to ap
pear in court was strongly debated. In 1991
( onley resigned from Stanford in protest of the
proinot ion of a colleague she accused of making
degrading sexual advances toward her and
otliei female colleagues. She lias since returned
to the Medical School but continues to speak
out against gender <list rimination.
( onley wrote a book in 199N called "Walking
Out on the Boys," in which she described dis
< rimination and harassment of female doc tors,
nurses and medical students at Stanford.
"Sulx oik ious discrimination in academic
medicine is an important issue," Conley said,
but while otliei schools recogni/.e the problem,
"Stanford is still in a stale of denial."

Referring to the recent admission of perva
sive gender bias at the Massachusetts Institute
of Tec hnology by its president, Crangle said,
"Ml I took a very courageous stand and we
have yet to see that at Stanford."
Conley emphasized that "progress is being
made, especially in the appointing of John
I lennessy as provost." I fennessy has long been
open about imbalance gender (list rimination at
Stanford, she said.
Stanford lawyers argued that Conley's testi
mony was too far removed 112 rom the focus of the
trial and would bias the jury, said Stanford Gen
eral (Counsel Debra Zumwalt.
A key piece of evidence in the suit is an e-mail
that was sent by the director of medical infor
mation laboratory to Crangle's boss the day
Crangle brought her charges of harassment.
I he e-mail said, "I'd like to see what options we
have right now simply to lay her off."
Stanford argues that Crangle did not have
grounds to make claims of gender discrimina
tion, and was about to be laid off anyway. The
funding for her research had run out and no
new bac king had been found.
(it angle counters that while funding for one
of her research projects had run out, several
other projects she was working on were funded
lor ;it least another year after she was laid off.
