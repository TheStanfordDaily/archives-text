Heading east for some Flori
da sunshine is not an uncom
mon spring break activity for
Stanford students. But this year,
graduate computet science stu
dent Fric Mao and seniors John
Bauer and Ken Takusagawa
went to Orlando with something
other than a tan on their minds.
I lie three placed 22nd at the
World Finals of the 24th Annual
Association lor Computing Ma
chinery International Collegiate
Programming (Contest.
Stanford's team and ten oth
ers, including Harvard and
Georgia Tech, solved two of six
programming problems in live
hours to tie for 22nd place. St.
Petersberg State University of
Russia solved all of the problems
to win the March 18 contest.
I'lie programming contest,
which provides college students
with an opportunity to demon
strate and sharpen their prob
lem-solving and computing
skills, is two-tiered. Teams first
compete in regional contests,
held during October and No
vember throughout the world.
Flie top two teams from each re
gional competition advance to
the world finals.
' I "his past fall, Stanford held a
programming contest to select
six students to represent the

University at the association's
Pacific Northwest Regional Con
test. Freshman Jon McAllister
placed first, but ( hose not to be
come a team member. He has
plans to compete next year.
l eam A consisted of Mao,
Bauer and l akusagavva while
Team B was made lip of Matt
Ginzton, Michael Sawka and
Matt Bell.
"Stanford sends two teams to
regionals," McAllister said. "The
top two teams at regionals ad
vance to the World Finals, unless
the two teams are from the same
school, which is what happened
this year." As a result, the top
Stanford team and one from an
other school moved on, he said.
Coach Claire Stager, a Com
puter Science Department stall
member stated that her role was
quite nominal in nature.
McAllister explained, "There
really isn't a coach for this thing .
. . it's all student ambition that
runs it."
The contest pits teams of
three and their computer
against a half-dozen problems,
and they are challenged to solve
as many as possible in five hours.
Teams were ranked accord
ing to the most problems solved
and least total time required to
solve them. I lie World Finals
programming language tools in
cluded Pascal, ((' + + and Java.
