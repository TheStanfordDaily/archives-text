## Saudis are accused of a cover-up 
### 
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) — Saudi
Arabia carries out secret trials,
torture and amputations and
hires public relations firms to
cover up the human rights abus
es, Amnesty International
claimed yesterday.
Ihe Saudi government
"spares no effort in keeping its
appalling human rights record a
secret by employing well-paid,
foreign-based public relations
firms and lobbyists," the London
based rights group said in the
report.
Activists protested near the
Saudi embassy in Washington on
Monday to bring attention to
alleged violations.
Yesterday's report said the
United States and other govern
ments were keeping silent in
order to advance business inter
ests and geopolitical concerns in
the Middle Eastern nation.
The oil-rich kingdom paid
public relations firms more than
$1 million in 1999 to improve its
image, Amnesty claimed.
Saudi Foreign Ministry offi
cials contacted yesterday by The
Associated Press refused to com
ment. The New York limes,
however, quoted Prince Tin ki
bin Mohammed, a deputy for
eign minister, criticizing the
report as inaccurate.
"We have nothing to hide in
human rights," he was quoted as
saying. "There is no harm in hav
ing their point of view, but they
have to be more accurate in their
information."
The report, part of a six
month worldwide campaign by
Amnesty to expose abuses in
Saudi Arabia, cited testimony
claiming brutality, torture and ill
treatment in many police sta
tions, prisons and detention cen
ters across the country.
So far this year, at least five
people have had their hands or
feet amputated in Saudi Arabia
for crimes including sodomy and
theft.
At least 13 people have been
beheaded this year, mainly for
murder and drug trafficking.
Christians, Sikhs and other
minorities in the Muslim monar
chy, it said, were subject to dis
crimination and were targeted by
security forces.
"Political and religious oppo
nents of the government,
migrant workers, women and
other powerless individuals
emerge as consistent victims of
discrimination," it added.
