# Netanyahu denies charges of corruption
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Deliver
ing an emotional television
appeal, former Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
angrily denied any wrongdoing
yesterday after police urged the
attorney general to indict him
and his wife on corruption
charges.
During a 50-minute interview,
Netanyahu occasionally used
props and paused dramatically to
emphasize his innocence and to
accuse police of trumping up the
charges against him.
Police said Netanyahu and his
wife, Sara, accepted favors from a
contractor, kept 700 presents
meant to be state property,
including a golden letter opener
from U.S. Vice President A 1
(lore, and tried to influence oth
ers to alter their testimony in the
case.
If tried and convicted of the
most serious charge, obstruction
of justice, Netanyahu could be
sentenced to up to seven years in
prison.
Netanyahu, 50, who was
tossed out by voters 10 months
ago, launched a counter-offen
sive against the police in an
apparent attempt to rescue his
political future.
During the TV appearance,
the former leader mentioned his
son and recently-deceased moth
er as he denied the allegations —
even, at one point, brandishing a
supposedly valuable brooch
which he said an appraiser had
valued at SI•
"Hie whole thing is ridicu
lous," Netanyahu scoffed during
the prime time interview.
Apparently relishing the
underdog role, the 50-year-old
politician accused police of mak
ing up the charges, saying he was
being persecuted by the political
establishment because of his
hardline views.
Shlomo Ben-Ami, the police

minister, denied police acted in
bad faith.
"The police did not, do not,
and as long as 1 am responsible
for police, will not have a political
agenda," he said.
Police said that a seven-month
investigation indicated that
Netanyahu should be charged
with fraud, attempted misuse of
state funds, breach of trust and
c )bstruction of justice.
His lawyer, Yaacov Weinroth,
called the police report "sloppy."
He said it "confirms what we
thought — the case is otie big
nothing."
The attorney general, Elyakim
Rubinstein, will make the final
decision on whether to indict. It
was unclear how long that pro
cess might take.
Arguing his case, Netanyahu
said police interrogated him as to
whether a small, valuable pen
dant was among the state gifts.
When he got home from that
particular interrogation session,
lie said he and his wife "turned
the house upside down" and
found the pendant.
They took it to an appraiser,
and were told that it is worth less
than a dollar, Netanyahu said,
waving the tiny pin before the
TV cameras.
Asked what the most difficult
moment was since the probe
began, Netanyahu stopped and
looked down.
After long seconds of silence,
he said his 8-year-old son Yair
was tormented at school because
of the probe and his mother,
Cila, died with the charges still
hanging over him.
Netanyahu's wife, Sara,
should be charged with theft and
misuse of state funds, police said.
Charges were also recom
mended against Moshe Leon, the
director of Netanyahu's office,
and Ezra Zeidoff, his office man
ager.
