PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) â€” George W. Bush reached
out to vanquished presidential rival John McCain yester
day, declaring "the past is the past" and it's time for them
to meet.
Another former rival, Steve Forbes, was endorsing Bush
as the Republicans moved toward reconciliation after a
bruising primary season.
Bush telephoned McCain from his car in Virginia,
where he traveled to lay out a $5 billion plan to address
illiteracy among young school students, declaring the
problem a "national emergency."

" 100 many of our children can't read," Bush told a
group of Asian-American business people in suburban
Washington.
"Our econoim is the env\ of the world; unfortunately,
our schools are not.'
Later, with Gov. Christie W hitman In his side, he told a
crowd 0f450 ai a New jersey fund-raiser: "I want to make
it clear to the good folks of New |erse\ and all across Amer
ica that I'm not i mining to become the federal superinten
dent of schools. . . . W'lial I believe is I believe in local con
trol of the schools."

Bush reached out to McCain after Bob Dole, the defeat
ed 1996 GOP nominee who has been acting as peacemak
er, had lunch with the Arizona senator and then called
Bush.
The Texas governor is hoping for an endorsement from
his former foe, but McCain aides said it is too soon to talk
about that.
Recent polls give both Bush and his Democratic rival,
Vice President A 1 Gore, roughly equal marks on who
would do the best job of improving the state of education
in the United States.
