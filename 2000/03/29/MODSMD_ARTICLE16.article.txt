# OPEC agrees to increase oil production despite opposition from Iran
## 
### 
VIENNA, Austria (AP) — OPEC
ignored objections of its second-biggest
member yesterday and agreed to
increase oil production, but perhaps not
enough to bring down gasoline prices in
the United States.
In a rare departure from its consen
sus approach, ministers of the 11-nation
cartel were expected to announce early
this morning that nine members would
raise production by a total of at least 1.45
million barrels a day. That appears to be
well short of what analysts have said
would be needed to stop oil and gasoline
prices from continuing a rise that has
seen crude triple over the past 12
months.
The Clinton administration had been
lobbying for a rise of 2 million to 2.5 mil
lion barrels a day to bring down gasoline
prices that in the United States have
risen from below $1 a gallon just over a
year ago to an average of almost $1.60.
An official statement was awaited to
explain the action after a six-hour meet
ing at OPEC's headquarters in Vienna,

broke last night without a unanimous
decision.
Iran, the No. 2 OPEC oil producer,
refused to endorse the action, saying the
Organization of IVtroleuin Exporting
Countries should not be a "rubber
stamp."
The agreement also excludes Iraq,
which never was part of the original pro
duction cuts last year that sent prices
surging.
Bijan Namdar /angeneh, Iran's oil
minister, told reporters he believed pro
duction should be increased by less than
I million barrels a day and objected to
attempts by others to push through an
agreement to boost output by some 1.7
million barrels. While/angeneh did not
mention other ()PE( 1 countries by name,
Saudi Arabia — ()PE(l's leading produc
er — had led the drive to raise output as
much as 7 percent front official quotas,
or by 1.7 million barrels.
"Our difference is on principle and
not on merely a few barrels," /.angeneh
told reporters after the meeting broke

up. "In my view, ()PE( 1 is not an organi
zation to rubber stamp a decision
already made."
/angeneh insisted that only a limited
increase in output was justified and that
there is no shortage of crude oil.
OPEC pumps more than 26 million
barrels of crude each flay, or about 35
percent of the woiid's supply. Ke\ non-
OPEC producers, such as Mexico and
Norway, have said ihe\ were watt liing to
see what OPEC will do before adjusting
their own output.
This was not the first time Iran
refused to join in a decision by its OPEC
colleagues. In 1992, Iran refused to
endorse an agreement that the rest of
OPEC made to cut production by
668,000 barrels a flay, arguing that the
cuts didn't go far enough.
Alarmed at the surge in oil prices,
which sent heating oil costs soaring in
the winter and gasoline prices skyrocket
ing, the United States hatl lobbied hard
in recent weeks for OPEC to relax its
constraints on production.
