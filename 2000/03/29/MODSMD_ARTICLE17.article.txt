## The
						Stanford Daily Racism at Stanford a real problem for community 
### 
IN LK.HI Of the recent rash of racist e
mails sent to Stanford accouts — three in
the last month and an additional two in
the last year — and letters to the editor
from Stanford students Jon Kaplan and
Stephanie Blossom outlining what they per
ceived as incidents of racism at Stanford,
racism has returned to the fore as one of the
major issues lacing the larger Stanford com
munity.
Although many would argue that overt
racism has not posed a systemic problem for
Stanford, others contend that, in looking at
instances of racism like the e-mails as isolated
incidents, the University is actually avoiding
the real issue — namely, one of serious racism.
This trend of racist e-mails began in febru-

ary of wilh an e-mail sent to visiting Law
School IYof. Kendell Thomas (an African-
American) and his constitutional law students.
I he e-mail used Thomas' race as a reason to
question his abilities, infuriating many stu
dents.
I hree months later, in May, a Stanford doc
toral student's Stanford account was hacked
into to send another lewd and racist e-mail to
several thousand Stanford e-mail accounts.
finally, in the last month alone, three e
mails have been sent to numerous Stanford
lists and individual accounts. These e-mails,
sent on March 7 and 27, contained similarly
vulgar content.
Ciiveil the deplorable nature of these
attacks, Stanford administration issued a nec

essarily prompt and condemnatory response
in all cases. However, beyond this, there have
been some questions as to how to handle these
situations.
In the matter of Prof. Thomas, former Law
School Dean Paul Brest responded to the inci
dent with an e-mail condemning the e-mail's
subject matter and content but defending the
author's First Amendment right to remain
anonymous. This angered many students,
who saw Brest's response as "quiet tolerance
for bigotry," as law student Dominique Day
said.
By contrast, in a much more forceful and
determined response to last May's e-mail,
University President Gerhard Casper stated
in an e-mail sent to all Leland accounts that

the administration would use "all the means
available [to take] appropriate action [against
the perpetrator]. Dean of Students Marc
Wais added that the e-mail was being consid
ered a violation of the Fundamental Standard
and Stanford's Computer and Network Usage
Policy.
Although the author or authors of these e
mails do indeed have a right to their opinions,
their flagrant infringement on the rights of
other individuals as well as their misuse of
Stanford computer networks falls far outside
the protection of the First Amendment and
should be prosecuted accordingly, as Casper
and Wais recognized.
