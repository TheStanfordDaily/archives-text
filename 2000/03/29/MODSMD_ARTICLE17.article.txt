## The 						Stanford Daily Racism at Stanford a real problem for community 
### 
IN LK.HI Of the recent rash of racist e
mails sent to Stanford accouts — three in
the last month and an additional two in
the last year — and letters to the editor
from Stanford students Jon Kaplan and
Stephanie Blossom outlining what they per
ceived as incidents of racism at Stanford,
racism has returned to the fore as one of the
major issues lacing the larger Stanford com
munity.
Although many would argue that overt
racism has not posed a systemic problem for
Stanford, others contend that, in looking at
instances of racism like the e-mails as isolated
incidents, the University is actually avoiding
the real issue — namely, one of serious racism.
This trend of racist e-mails began in febru-

Published Since J*9l

ary of wilh an e-mail sent to visiting Law
School IYof. Kendell Thomas (an African-
American) and his constitutional law students.
I he e-mail used Thomas' race as a reason to
question his abilities, infuriating many stu
dents.
I hree months later, in May, a Stanford doc
toral student's Stanford account was hacked
into to send another lewd and racist e-mail to
several thousand Stanford e-mail accounts.
finally, in the last month alone, three e
mails have been sent to numerous Stanford
lists and individual accounts. These e-mails,
sent on March 7 and 27, contained similarly
vulgar content.
Ciiveil the deplorable nature of these
attacks, Stanford administration issued a nec

essarily prompt and condemnatory response
in all cases. However, beyond this, there have
been some questions as to how to handle these
situations.
In the matter of Prof. Thomas, former Law
School Dean Paul Brest responded to the inci
dent with an e-mail condemning the e-mail's
subject matter and content but defending the
author's First Amendment right to remain
anonymous. This angered many students,
who saw Brest's response as "quiet tolerance
for bigotry," as law student Dominique Day
said.
By contrast, in a much more forceful and
determined response to last May's e-mail,
University President Gerhard Casper stated
in an e-mail sent to all Leland accounts that

I liis ('<liioii.il icpicM'iiis ilic views <>1 ilie members ol I lit- Dailv's editorial board. Ilie board consists ol lour Daily editors, two stall members at-large, and three University community
members at l.u «c Signed (olumiis and conn ibntions are the view ol ihe writer and do not necessarily represent the view of the editorial board.

the administration would use "all the means
available [to take] appropriate action [against
the perpetrator]. Dean of Students Marc
Wais added that the e-mail was being consid
ered a violation of the Fundamental Standard
and Stanford's Computer and Network Usage
Policy.
Although the author or authors of these e
mails do indeed have a right to their opinions,
their flagrant infringement on the rights of
other individuals as well as their misuse of
Stanford computer networks falls far outside
the protection of the First Amendment and
should be prosecuted accordingly, as Casper
and Wais recognized.
Obviously, few at Stanford would
openly contend that the content of
these e-mails is in any way valid.
I lowever, in handling these e-mails as
isolated incidents of hate speech,
Stanford ignores the larger problem
of racism as a w hole. Racism does
exist at Stanford, as evidenced, if not
by the racist e-mails, then certainly by
the letters from Kaplan and Blossom,
just to start.
Stanford's image as a relatively lib
eral university is often extrapolated
to include a sense of Stanford as a
place of "liberalism," where tough
issues are constantly arising and
being addressed in meaningful ways.
However, many would argue that this
is far from the case.
As Stanford becomes more afflu
ent and increasingly removed from
the poverty and other real problems
of the outside world, it also seems to
be moving farther and farther away
from facing true conflicts; the Stan
ford community has, in many ways,
become complacent when it comes
to controversies like these — namely
those that do not seem to exist overt
ly at the University.
As law student Day said, express
ing a sentiment held by many, "This is
an inhospitable academic environ
ment for nnnoi ities, and it is a culture
unique to Stanford," referencing, in
large part, Stanford's "culture" of
ignoring issues of race and ethnicity,
among other controversial matters.
The question of "community,"
however, remains central to any con
sideration of combatting racism and
addressing other matters of activism
at Stanford. It is the Stanford com
munity, as a whole, that must bear
(lie responsibility lot identifying and
defeating racism at Stanford.
Students, in arguing for increased
response from the University, must
also admit the need for a much
greater degree of student concern

and activism. Similarly, the Universi
ty must do its part by publicly
acknowledging racism as a problem
at Stanford and beginning to investi
gate ways to fight it.
Whether the problem is systemic
or not, the Stanford community
must recognize that race and racism,
as highlighted by the racist e-mails
and the instances of racism wit
nessed and experienced by students
like Kaplan and Blossom, does mat
ter at Stanford.
As Vice Provost of Student
Affairs James Montoya said in
response to the May, 1999, inci
dent, "We each have a personal
responsibility to maintain a com
munity that values and supports
diversity." Montoya continued
today by stressing the importance
of community, but that means more
than race dialogues and student
forums; it means a stated Universi
ty commitment to addressing the
issues of racism that have arisen at
Stanford in the past year in a tangi
ble way and a visible movement on
the part of students to express their
views on issues like racism and to
respect and congratulate others
who choose to do so.
The ultimate development of such
declarations remains to be seen, but
it would best be started with the Uni
versity's recognition that racism at
Stanford hardly occurs as a series of
isolated incidents. Rather, it occurs as
part of a larger problem — namely
one in which students and others at
Stanford feel discouraged from
expressing their concerns about con
troversial issues by the non-con
frontational atmosphere fostered by
the entire University community.
In short, avoiding the problem or
pretending it is not there only causes
it to fester, eventually resulting in the
travesties the University has seen in
the past year and, more importantly,
will continue to see until the larger
Stanford community takes some
action to bring these issues to light in
a more constructive way than the e
mails' authors have done.

forums; it means a stated Universi
ty commitment to addressing the
issues of racism that have arisen at
Stanford in the past year in a tangi
ble way and a visible movement on
the part of students to express their
views on issues like racism and to
respect and congratulate others
who choose to do so.
The ultimate development of such
declarations remains to be seen, but
it would best be started with the Uni
versity's recognition that racism at
Stanford hardly occurs as a series of
isolated incidents. Rather, it occurs as
part of a larger problem — namely
one in which students and others at
Stanford feel discouraged from
expressing their concerns about con
troversial issues by the non-con
frontational atmosphere fostered by
the entire University community.
In short, avoiding the problem or
pretending it is not there only causes
it to fester, eventually resulting in the
travesties the University has seen in
the past year and, more importantly,
will continue to see until the larger
Stanford community takes some
action to bring these issues to light in
a more constructive way than the e
mails' authors have done.
IN LK.HI Of the recent rash of racist e
mails sent to Stanford accouts — three in
the last month and an additional two in
the last year — and letters to the editor
from Stanford students Jon Kaplan and
Stephanie Blossom outlining what they per
ceived as incidents of racism at Stanford,
racism has returned to the fore as one of the
major issues lacing the larger Stanford com
munity.
Although many would argue that overt
racism has not posed a systemic problem for
Stanford, others contend that, in looking at
instances of racism like the e-mails as isolated
incidents, the University is actually avoiding
the real issue — namely, one of serious racism.
This trend of racist e-mails began in febru-

Published Since J*9l

ary of wilh an e-mail sent to visiting Law
School IYof. Kendell Thomas (an African-
American) and his constitutional law students.
I he e-mail used Thomas' race as a reason to
question his abilities, infuriating many stu
dents.
I hree months later, in May, a Stanford doc
toral student's Stanford account was hacked
into to send another lewd and racist e-mail to
several thousand Stanford e-mail accounts.
finally, in the last month alone, three e
mails have been sent to numerous Stanford
lists and individual accounts. These e-mails,
sent on March 7 and 27, contained similarly
vulgar content.
Ciiveil the deplorable nature of these
attacks, Stanford administration issued a nec

essarily prompt and condemnatory response
in all cases. However, beyond this, there have
been some questions as to how to handle these
situations.
In the matter of Prof. Thomas, former Law
School Dean Paul Brest responded to the inci
dent with an e-mail condemning the e-mail's
subject matter and content but defending the
author's First Amendment right to remain
anonymous. This angered many students,
who saw Brest's response as "quiet tolerance
for bigotry," as law student Dominique Day
said.
By contrast, in a much more forceful and
determined response to last May's e-mail,
University President Gerhard Casper stated
in an e-mail sent to all Leland accounts that

I liis ('<liioii.il icpicM'iiis ilic views <>1 ilie members ol I lit- Dailv's editorial board. Ilie board consists ol lour Daily editors, two stall members at-large, and three University community
members at l.u «c Signed (olumiis and conn ibntions are the view ol ihe writer and do not necessarily represent the view of the editorial board.

the administration would use "all the means
available [to take] appropriate action [against
the perpetrator]. Dean of Students Marc
Wais added that the e-mail was being consid
ered a violation of the Fundamental Standard
and Stanford's Computer and Network Usage
Policy.
Although the author or authors of these e
mails do indeed have a right to their opinions,
their flagrant infringement on the rights of
other individuals as well as their misuse of
Stanford computer networks falls far outside
the protection of the First Amendment and
should be prosecuted accordingly, as Casper
and Wais recognized.
Obviously, few at Stanford would
openly contend that the content of
these e-mails is in any way valid.
I lowever, in handling these e-mails as
isolated incidents of hate speech,
Stanford ignores the larger problem
of racism as a w hole. Racism does
exist at Stanford, as evidenced, if not
by the racist e-mails, then certainly by
the letters from Kaplan and Blossom,
just to start.
Stanford's image as a relatively lib
eral university is often extrapolated
to include a sense of Stanford as a
place of "liberalism," where tough
issues are constantly arising and
being addressed in meaningful ways.
However, many would argue that this
is far from the case.
As Stanford becomes more afflu
ent and increasingly removed from
the poverty and other real problems
of the outside world, it also seems to
be moving farther and farther away
from facing true conflicts; the Stan
ford community has, in many ways,
become complacent when it comes
to controversies like these — namely
those that do not seem to exist overt
ly at the University.
As law student Day said, express
ing a sentiment held by many, "This is
an inhospitable academic environ
ment for nnnoi ities, and it is a culture
unique to Stanford," referencing, in
large part, Stanford's "culture" of
ignoring issues of race and ethnicity,
among other controversial matters.
The question of "community,"
however, remains central to any con
sideration of combatting racism and
addressing other matters of activism
at Stanford. It is the Stanford com
munity, as a whole, that must bear
(lie responsibility lot identifying and
defeating racism at Stanford.
Students, in arguing for increased
response from the University, must
also admit the need for a much
greater degree of student concern

and activism. Similarly, the Universi
ty must do its part by publicly
acknowledging racism as a problem
at Stanford and beginning to investi
gate ways to fight it.
Whether the problem is systemic
or not, the Stanford community
must recognize that race and racism,
as highlighted by the racist e-mails
and the instances of racism wit
nessed and experienced by students
like Kaplan and Blossom, does mat
ter at Stanford.
As Vice Provost of Student
Affairs James Montoya said in
response to the May, 1999, inci
dent, "We each have a personal
responsibility to maintain a com
munity that values and supports
diversity." Montoya continued
today by stressing the importance
of community, but that means more
than race dialogues and student
forums; it means a stated Universi
ty commitment to addressing the
issues of racism that have arisen at
Stanford in the past year in a tangi
ble way and a visible movement on
the part of students to express their
views on issues like racism and to
respect and congratulate others
who choose to do so.
The ultimate development of such
declarations remains to be seen, but
it would best be started with the Uni
versity's recognition that racism at
Stanford hardly occurs as a series of
isolated incidents. Rather, it occurs as
part of a larger problem — namely
one in which students and others at
Stanford feel discouraged from
expressing their concerns about con
troversial issues by the non-con
frontational atmosphere fostered by
the entire University community.
In short, avoiding the problem or
pretending it is not there only causes
it to fester, eventually resulting in the
travesties the University has seen in
the past year and, more importantly,
will continue to see until the larger
Stanford community takes some
action to bring these issues to light in
a more constructive way than the e
mails' authors have done.
