# WHAT THE HECK I'M TALKING ABOUT
## Where did Esperanto go? 
### 
As ilic last spring breakers (i i< k
le in 111 is week from .ill cornel's
ol the world, ii seems an
opportune lime lo relied
upon a litlle thing tailed Esperanto.
"Ksperanlo?" yon may ask. You may
have forgotten there \v;is su< h ,i thing.
In hut. I think most of us forget about
Ksperanlo. Despite all the flyers plas
tered at I'igott 11 all, begging us to
expand out language horizons with
Ksperanlo classes. 1 personal!) had
never given it much thought.
But whether you're coming back

from Boston or Flori
da, France or Mexico,
Jamaica or even just
across the Bay, you've
probably encountered
at least a change in
dialect from one place
to another. For some,
fitting in with the
locals inav have been
as simple a* chopping

or adding a "hella," "wicked" or "y'all."
as applicable.
For others, such as invself, who trav
eled to a (lisi.mi (onntrv whose language
tliey knew nearly nothing ahont, the ( ul
tnral differences were, shall we sa\, a lit
tle more complex. Ksperanto might have
come in handv.
In case you haven't heard ol it before,
Esperanto is the "international lan
guage" (no, not that international lan
guage!) created in 1887 by Dr. L.E.
Zamenhof, known affectionately by
Esperantists as "Dr. Esperanto." Accord
ing to the oHicial Esperanto Web site,
there are an estimated two million
Esperanto speakers worldwide, but even
on the site they admit that their statistics
might be a little far-fetched.
I think we can pretty much assume
ihat if Esperanto was ever going to catch
on, il would have already done so in the
11.'J years it has been around. But the
idea is still nice — no irregular verbs!
Imagine the possibilities!
Bui while worldwide Esperanto usage
will probably always remain a dream
(the word "Esperanto" itself means "one
who hopes" — in Esperanto, that is),
there are always ways ol getting around
the language barrier. And it seems like
making an eflort to speak another per
son's language goes a long way. 1 he dif
ference in languages is sometimes half
the fun ol being immersed in another
culture.
I was lucky enough to have spent inv
spring break ibis year in Nice, France.
I'd never even been to Europe before. I
knew some choice phrases, such as, "Will
vou dance with me,' and, "1 am a

pineapple" (don't ask), bin I certainly
was not adequately prepared lor fluid
conversation. A few ol tis did master the
rcstaui ant-Ji iendl) uod. smile* and wave
ol ilic hand combo thai translated as,
"Yes, whatever you just said sounds
great. Bring me that, please."
In the event that I did try to speak
French, I couldn't help reverting now
and then lo a Spanish accent. And,
sometimes, to Spanish. Many a lime, a
store < Ink would approat h me to ask if
I wanted help or a dressing room. More
than once, niv answer was, "Si! Yes!
Oui!" Othei limes, I tried saying Span
ish words with a Krench accent, hoping
I hat Latin roots were on niv side. ()ne of
in\ friends consoled niv failed elforls
with a pat on the shoulder and s.tid,
"Maybe that's a word in Ksperanlo!"
but I worked <il niv Krench pronunci
ation with real tleiei initiation, repealing
die won Is /xiiiuige, hnhes and rouge out
loud as I walked along the street. I
found tnvself speaking Knglish with niv
friends in a terrible French accent at all
times, in a inannei quite similar to I'epe
I Ten: "Oh! I believe we have met
belore!" ()t t asionalb I convinced myself
that inv own little dialect was somehow
comprehensible lo the French them
selves. I his resulted in Ihe same puzzled
smiles and nods I mysell had learned
and practiced.
Bui, for the most part, our attempts
lo communicate were received gracious
ly, albeit comic alb , even w hen one of us
told a waiter, "I am a chefs salad."
One night, we entered a restaurant
after the kitchen had apparently been
closed, but after we attempted to
explain lo the niailre'd how confused
and hungry we were, he brought us
everything they had in back — a huge
platter of cheeses, salad, mushrooms,
artichokes, vegetables, dips — until the
entire table was covered in bowls and
platters lor us to choose from. We were
amazed. Afterward, over coffee, we
talked for an hour to the restaurant's
owner and his wile. Ii was one of the
most memorable moments of the trip.
And that's not just because I love food,
really.
So now that I think about it, I'll prob
ably still hold off on ihe Ksperanlo c lass
es, since I really get a kick out of learn
ing foreign languages. I think people
also get a kick out of watching me. And
hey, it's a great way lo get a free platter
of frontage.
