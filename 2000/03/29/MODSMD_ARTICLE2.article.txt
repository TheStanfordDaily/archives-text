### MARK BOUCHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Funding for the off-campus apartment subsidy
program will increase to $5 million for the 2000-2001
academic year, Housing Assignment Services an
nounced on Friday. They also expect the 508 new
studio apartments being built in Kscondido Village to
open in stages between September and January.
The $5 million in funding represents an increase
of $1 .8 million Iron, 'his year. This is the third year of
the program, which is underwritten by the Provost's
Office.
According to Todd Benson, manager of Housing
Assignment Services, the funds will be split between
subsidies of on- and off-campus housing.
The University subsidizes off-campus housing by
renting apartments ii local apartment complexes. It
then sublets these apartments to students at a cheap
er rate. The subsidies average about $285 per month.
The University will subsidize on-campus housing
by (barging students who live in
the new studio apartments less
than the cost of construction and
maintenance.
"The rate (will be] consistent
with the other rents on campus, '
said Benson.
Of the 508 new studio apart
ments in Kseondido Village, 272
will be open lor next fall <|uartcr,
and the other 2Mb will be open for
next winter quarter. According to
Benson, the apartments will open
in stages because of construction

delays.
"The third unit won't be fin
ished on time," Benson said. I leat
n ilMited the delays to rainy weath
er and difli( ulties in obtaining con
si i u< t ion permits I mm Santa C '.lata

I lie studio apartments that
open in the litll will be assigned
through the regular graduate
housing lottery, according to Ben
son. Students assigned to these
apartments will occupy them lot
the cm it ii e academic year.
I lie apartments that open in
the winter will follow a different
lottery procedure. Mousing As
signment Set vices is holding a spe
cial pre-lottery assignment round

for these apartments. It begins
today at the service's Web site and
will run through April 7. Students
who ,ue awarded spaces in this
round will be ineligible for the reg
ular lottery.
Students moving into apart
ments opening next winter have
several living options for fall quar
ter. I hose who currently live in
off-campus housing subsidised by
Stanford will continue to have
those apartments funded until
January. Those who currently live
on-campus will live in the Oak
Creek and Sharon Green apart
ment complexes next fall.
I lie University will provide fur
niture for these students to furnish

their temporary apartments, Ben
son said.
Students who decide to live in
the studio apartments that open in
the winter will also be offered a
special lottery exemption for the
2001-2002 academic year. They
will be allowed to continue living in
their same apartment for the
2001-2002 academic year.
This exemption was made "to
ensure that the studio apart
ments . . . are fully occupied," ac
cording to a press release from
Housing Assignment Services.
" They need to advertise [the
new apartments] well," said
physics doctoral student Kaleb
Midland, chairman of the CJradu

ate Student Council. "People don't
like moving. I hope they don't end
up causing too many people to
move back and forth."
Housing Assignment Services
also announced that the Universi
ty will discontinue subsidizing
apartments for single students at
the Oak Creek and Sharon Green
apartment complexes next year
but will continue to subsidize
apartments there for couples and
families.
This decision was made because
the subsidy for these apartments
was approximately twice as much
the subsidy for other apartments.
The 142 single students who
are currently living in these com

plexes will have first priority for
the studio apartments that open in
January.
"I understand the rea
sons, . . . but it's unfortunate that
[Oak Creek and Sharon Green]
will no longer be options" for sin
gle students, said Michaud. " They
are nice places because they are
nearby and within the reach of the
Marguerite."
Michaud added that adminis
trators should work on making the
lottery process more humanizing.
"It involves graduate students
who are really hoping they have a
place to live," he said. "It has an
impact on how much time they can
put into their research and work."
