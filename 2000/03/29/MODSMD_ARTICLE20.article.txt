Strengthening community
to combat racism
On Monday evening several hundred
members of the Stanford community
were sent a racist and deplorable message
via e-mail, (he same day The Daily report
ed on another racist e-mail sent last quar
ter. In both cases, an investigation was
launched immediately to identify the
sources of the e-mails. In both cases, the
e-mails appear to have been generated
fiom off campus, though the investiga
tions have not been completed.
Simply stated, I wish we could elimi
nate such e-mails from appearing on our
screens, but Internet access and anonymi
ty make that highly improbable.
Unfortunately, there are people in the
world who are intent on inflicting their
hatred and ignorance on others, but we
must not give power to their words.
Instead, we must direct our energy to
building an even stronger community
where all of our members feel valued,
respected and embraced, and where
diversity is celebrated.
As we discuss the power of the Internet, I

hope we will not loose sight of the power of
community, our community in particular.

More on road safety
This is in response to Ama Ofosu-
Barko's March 8 letter ("Drivers need to
exercise caution near Florence Moore
Hall"), in which she states that maybe
she's "naive in thinking that pedestrians
have the right of way when crossing at a
marked crosswalk." No, you're not naive
at all. Pedestrians DO have the right of
way when crossing at a marked crosswalk.
However, BICYCLES ARE NOT PEDES
TRIANS. That is a fact.
A bicycle is considered a vehicle and
must conform to all traffic laws. Look it
up in the state driver's booklet, and you'll
probably see it there. A person with a
bicycle is only a pedestrian if they are not
on the bicycle. And, in accordance with
traffic laws that 1 learned when learning
to drive, 1 seem to remember that a per

son on a bike is not even supposed to use
crosswalks at all unless they are walking
their bike across the street.
1 will heartily agree that the drivers
share the blame in this situation. They
definitely need to stop at the crosswalk,
where the posted stop sign is. And I don't
even mean one of those famous rolling
stop stops. The stop legally must involve
the tires completely ceasing from all
movement in relation to the pavement.
Drivers should stop completely and
check for pedestrians on both sides.
However, an equal part of the blame
should be given to those on the bikes. If
the bikers were following the law and
walking their bikes across the street, not
a single one of them would ever be hit
by a car. But, of course, no one on a bike
wants to stop and get off the bike to
cross a street on a crosswalk. Heck, I
wouldn't either. But at least I would
cross with the knowledge that I am
NOT considered a pedestrian and have
just as much responsibility as a car in
looking out for a collision.
