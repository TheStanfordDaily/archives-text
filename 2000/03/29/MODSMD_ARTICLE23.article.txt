# Former Roble dining to host performances
## 
### DURANT GIPSON 
Ever since Roble I (all residents began
eating in Lakeside Dining last year, the fu
ture use of Roble Dining Hall has been in
question.
That question has been half-answered:
the east side of Roble Dining Hall will be
come a multipurpose performance space.
But the fate of the west side is still up in the
air.
Construction should begin on the east
side stage this week, according to Roble Res
ident Fellow Sam Le√üaron. The 29-inch
high platform should be finished in time for
the Roble musical in May.
Several student groups as well as the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate have pro
posed transforming the west side into a
black box theater for use by performing
groups on campus.
A committee consisting of members of
theater groups, ASSU officers and residents
of Roble have agreed that such a theater is a
good idea.
But before a final decision is made, Stage
One Productions will produce the musical
"Merrily We Roll Along" from April 20 to 29
in the old west dining room. The produc
tion will test the effects of siting a theater in
the middle of a 300-person residence.
According to senior Jennifer Chou, a
member of the committee, "This campus
needs more theater space." Roble is ideal
because of its centralized location and ap
propriate size for modest productions, she
said.

(:hou, who is also executive producer for
Stage One Productions, said they are
putting on the play so that "everyone will
get a better idea of what it will be like."
The proposal is awaiting approval from
Residential Education and Student Hous
ing Services.
The west side dining hall also played
host to a winter quarter freshman semi
nar taught by Mechanical Engineering
Prof. Larry Leifer that focused on brain
storming proposals for the new use of the
space. The overall theme of the class's
proposals was flexibility for multiple uses,
said Chris Thompson, a resident assistant
in Roble.
Student Housing Services, Roble resi
dent assistants and Sam Lebaron decided
on the change, in keeping with the tradition
of residence performance spaces in Wilbur
11 all and Ricker Dining I lall.
The dining hall had been a performing
space in the past, and the space is "primari
ly to support Roble" residents, said Cheryl
Toeppen, manager of Housing Design Ser
vices.
According to Thompson, the space can
be used for study, theater, dance, lectures
and "anything that a very modular space
can be used for."
The room will be furnished as a dorm
lounge and extra chairs will have to be
brought in for major productions, Toeppen
said.
"I think it's a nice addition to the resi
dence hall program," said Rodger Whitney,
director of Student Housing Services.
