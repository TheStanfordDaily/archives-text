## Rainbows elude Card in Hawaii 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
Rainbows not only lit up the sky, but
also the volleyball court last weekend as
the No. 13 Stanford men's volleyball
team (8-9, 7-7 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) dropped two matches to
the No. 6 University of Hawaii Rain
bows (12-8, 7-ti).
I he losses slid Stanford down to
fourth in the Pacific division of the
MPSF, behind Long Beach State, Uni
versity of Southern California and
Hawaii, threatening the team's chances
at a MPSF tournament bid as playoff
time looms a month away.
I wo different nights with two differ
ent matches, and though the results
came out the same, it seemed as though
two different Stanford teams came out
to play, as 112 lawaii was able to bring out
the best and the worst in the Cardinal
squad.
The ball bounced back and forth be
tween Hawaii and Stanford in match
one as the two teams battled for nearly
three hours in just three games that
ended in favor of the Rainbows 10-14,
15-13, 15-13. Despite the loss, the Car
dinal squad came away with four indi
vidual career-highs and its third high
est hitting percentage this season with
.429.
"It was a good night for us offensive
ly," head coach Ruben Nieves said. "It
was one of our best nights attacking
and siding-out as a team. Most nights
when you hit over .400, you win."
In easily the Cardinal's longest
three-game match of the season, it was
the squad's 125 side-outs and strong
hitting percentages that kept Stanford
in the match.
Stanford's side-out prowess helped
the squad fend off 20 game points in

game one, carrying the squad from a
14-8 deficit to a 14-14 tie. In game two,
Stanford denied Hawaii nine game
points, while adding five points to its
own tally. In the final game I lawaii saw
live match points before closing out the
match.
"We played from behind all night
long," Nieves said. "We were lough
enough to come back, which is a nice
sign ol mental toughness, but on the
llipside we had many chances to score
and dose out the game."
In attacking Stanford posted four
players in double digits for kills, allow
ing the squad to creep within two
points of clinching each game.
Freshman Curt 1 oppel, who, prior
to this weekend, was the nation's kill
leader with a 8.39 kill-per-game aver
age, recorded his second night above
40 kills with 42. Sophomore Marcus
Skacel doubled his season high in kills
last season with a 34-kill performance,
his career best. Junior Brett Young
berg saw limited playing time because
of a lingering hack injury, but still
notched 13 kills for the Cardinal.
Freshman Bill) Strickland had his
strongest night both offensively andde
fensiveh as he posted a double-double
with career-highs in kills with 12 and
digs with 14. Just behind Strickland's
team-leading dig performance was ju
nior setter )osh 1 .likens w ho recorded a
season-high 12 digs, while setting a ca
reer-high 106 assists.
"We showed we were capable of
beating them," Nieves said. "Our team
looked comparable. I lie problem was
we didn't stop Hawaii, and we had a
hard time scoring points."'
Mavbe it was the fatigue from match
one or frustration from not clinching a
game. Mavbe it was the 5,000 Hawaii
fans exuberantly cheering for their

team. Whatever the reason, just 24
hours later in match two, the deter
mined and comparable Stanford squad
fell apart.
"In the second match we started out
well," red-shirt freshman Jon Palacios
said referring to Stanford's early 4-2
lead in game one. "Hut in the first
match we stayed focused more
throughout the match."
Momentum from Stanford's earl)
lead switched hands, and Hawaii not
only secured the game, but also took an
early command of game two with a 6-0
lead before Stanford pulled together
five points to bring it within a point of
I lawaii.
"Curtis [Craham] brought a little
spark that our team needed at that
point," Skacel said referring to Gra
ham's entrance into the match as the
squad laced a 0-0 deficit.
"Curtis Graham gave an immediate
lift off (he bench," Nieves said. "()ne of
the hardest things to do is to play with
spirit and enthusiasm when losing,
Graham conies iu and does that."
Hut a three-point run for the Rain
bows directly followed Stanford's
comeback and the Cardinal could not
recover.
In game three, Stanford again went
down early and trailed 0-0 before fresh
man William Curtis came off t he bench
and hit a string of three kills that se
cured the team's only point of the
game.
"We failed to execute the way we
know how," red-shirt freshman Seth
Ring said of match two. "We didn't
bring our A-game, we didn't play the
way we could have."
"Hoth teams were not as sharp at the
start, but as the game went on they got

it together much better than we
did," Nieves said. "A lot of guys
were off tonight, we never got it
going."
Neither of Stanford s top two
hitters, I oppel and Skacel, had a
strong night for the Cardinal, hurt
ing the squad's offensive power.
Toppel's 18 kills made it just his
third night under 20 kills all sea
son, while Skacel only notched

eight, his second night under 20
kills in Ins past six matches.
Defensively, though it outdug
Hawaii ">S-43 and posted 11
bloc ks I i iday night, Stanford was
out-dug 24-22 and didn't pro
duce any blocks on Saturday a
season-low for the squad â€”
which averages 2.7 blocks-per
ganie.
"I was disappointed that we
bad zero blocks," Nieves said.
"But 1 was more disappointed
that they had more digs than us,
because if we not blocking, we're
getting chances to dig."

Despite the losses, Nieves is
optimistic about Stanford's re
maining five matches and secur
ing a playoff bid.
"This group is good at looking
at the bright side," Nieves said.
"We're still in the playoff hunt,
we need to win a few more match
es, and there won't be any easy
ones. In the past six weeks we've
grown more confident about our
abilities to play with anybody,
and I still feel that way."
Stanford started off the break
with a 3-1 win over California in
an exhibition match at Cal.

berg saw limited playing time because
of a lingering hack injury, but still
notched 13 kills for the Cardinal.
Freshman Bill) Strickland had his
strongest night both offensively andde
fensiveh as he posted a double-double
with career-highs in kills with 12 and
digs with 14. Just behind Strickland's
team-leading dig performance was ju

season-high 12 digs, while setting a ca
reer-high 106 assists.
"We showed we were capable of
beating them," Nieves said. "Our team
looked comparable. I lie problem was
we didn't stop Hawaii, and we had a
hard time scoring points."'
Mavbe it was the fatigue from match
one or frustration from not clinching a
game. Mavbe it was the 5,000 Hawaii
fans exuberantly cheering for their

team. Whatever the reason, just 24
hours later in match two, the deter
mined and comparable Stanford squad
fell apart.
"In the second match we started out
well," red-shirt freshman Jon Palacios
said referring to Stanford's early 4-2
lead in game one. "Hut in the first
match we stayed focused more
throughout the match."
Momentum from Stanford's earl)
lead switched hands, and Hawaii not
only secured the game, but also took an
early command of game two with a 6-0
lead before Stanford pulled together
five points to bring it within a point of
I lawaii.
"Curtis [Craham] brought a little
spark that our team needed at that
point," Skacel said referring to Gra
ham's entrance into the match as the
squad laced a 0-0 deficit.
"Curtis Graham gave an immediate
lift off (he bench," Nieves said. "()ne of
the hardest things to do is to play with
spirit and enthusiasm when losing,
Graham conies iu and does that."
Hut a three-point run for the Rain
bows directly followed Stanford's
comeback and the Cardinal could not
recover.
In game three, Stanford again went
down early and trailed 0-0 before fresh
man William Curtis came off t he bench
and hit a string of three kills that se
cured the team's only point of the
game.
"We failed to execute the way we
know how," red-shirt freshman Seth
Ring said of match two. "We didn't
bring our A-game, we didn't play the
way we could have."
"Hoth teams were not as sharp at the
start, but as the game went on they got

it together much better than we
did," Nieves said. "A lot of guys
were off tonight, we never got it
going."
Neither of Stanford s top two
hitters, I oppel and Skacel, had a
strong night for the Cardinal, hurt
ing the squad's offensive power.
Toppel's 18 kills made it just his
third night under 20 kills all sea
son, while Skacel only notched

eight, his second night under 20
kills in Ins past six matches.
Defensively, though it outdug
Hawaii ">S-43 and posted 11
bloc ks I i iday night, Stanford was
out-dug 24-22 and didn't pro
duce any blocks on Saturday a
season-low for the squad â€”
which averages 2.7 blocks-per
ganie.
"I was disappointed that we
bad zero blocks," Nieves said.
"But 1 was more disappointed
that they had more digs than us,
because if we not blocking, we're
getting chances to dig."

Despite the losses, Nieves is
optimistic about Stanford's re
maining five matches and secur
ing a playoff bid.
"This group is good at looking
at the bright side," Nieves said.
"We're still in the playoff hunt,
we need to win a few more match
es, and there won't be any easy
ones. In the past six weeks we've
grown more confident about our
abilities to play with anybody,
and I still feel that way."
Stanford started off the break
with a 3-1 win over California in
an exhibition match at Cal.
Rainbows not only lit up the sky, but
also the volleyball court last weekend as
the No. 13 Stanford men's volleyball
team (8-9, 7-7 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) dropped two matches to
the No. 6 University of Hawaii Rain
bows (12-8, 7-ti).
I he losses slid Stanford down to
fourth in the Pacific division of the
MPSF, behind Long Beach State, Uni
versity of Southern California and
Hawaii, threatening the team's chances
at a MPSF tournament bid as playoff
time looms a month away.
I wo different nights with two differ
ent matches, and though the results
came out the same, it seemed as though
two different Stanford teams came out
to play, as 112 lawaii was able to bring out
the best and the worst in the Cardinal
squad.
The ball bounced back and forth be
tween Hawaii and Stanford in match
one as the two teams battled for nearly
three hours in just three games that
ended in favor of the Rainbows 10-14,
15-13, 15-13. Despite the loss, the Car
dinal squad came away with four indi
vidual career-highs and its third high
est hitting percentage this season with
.429.
"It was a good night for us offensive
ly," head coach Ruben Nieves said. "It
was one of our best nights attacking
and siding-out as a team. Most nights
when you hit over .400, you win."
In easily the Cardinal's longest
three-game match of the season, it was
the squad's 125 side-outs and strong
hitting percentages that kept Stanford
in the match.
Stanford's side-out prowess helped
the squad fend off 20 game points in

game one, carrying the squad from a
14-8 deficit to a 14-14 tie. In game two,
Stanford denied Hawaii nine game
points, while adding five points to its
own tally. In the final game I lawaii saw
live match points before closing out the
match.
"We played from behind all night
long," Nieves said. "We were lough
enough to come back, which is a nice
sign ol mental toughness, but on the
llipside we had many chances to score
and dose out the game."
In attacking Stanford posted four
players in double digits for kills, allow
ing the squad to creep within two
points of clinching each game.
Freshman Curt 1 oppel, who, prior
to this weekend, was the nation's kill
leader with a 8.39 kill-per-game aver
age, recorded his second night above
40 kills with 42. Sophomore Marcus
Skacel doubled his season high in kills
last season with a 34-kill performance,
his career best. Junior Brett Young
berg saw limited playing time because
of a lingering hack injury, but still
notched 13 kills for the Cardinal.
