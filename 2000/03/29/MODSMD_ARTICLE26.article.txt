()n Tuesda) night. Sunken Diamond was more like
Frozen Diamond. Fxcept foi the hats of Stanford's
baseball team, that is.
Matehing its season high with I -1 hits, the No. 2 ('at -
dinal (20-7) defeated St. Mary's (I 1-1N) 5-2 in a non
conference game on the Farm in front of a tin\ but de
voted crowd which endured unusually cold weather
for a March night. Sophomore Mike Wodnicki (2-0)
got the win for the C !aretinal, while J.G. I .aßoc hette (0-
1) was tagged with the loss lor the (laels.
Senior centerfielder Fclinund Muth accounted loi
most of the run production with three hits, including
a pair of triples which accounted for three Stanford
runs. Muth leads the (Cardinal with SO runs batted in
on the year.
"I've been seeing the ball good the last couple of
weeks . . . extra-base hit-wise, I've been swinging the
bat real well," said Muth.
Senior third baseman John Gall also edged closer
toward the Stanford career record for hits, blasting a
two-run homer in the third inning to pass former Car
dinal and c ut rent Oakland A's c atcher A.J. 11 inch on
the all-time list with .'?()() in his career. Gall now only
trails Paul Carey, who left the Farm with SHI hits from

1987-90.
"When I get past the guy on top, 1 might get a little
excited," said a grinning (>all aliei the game.
F.ven with the season-high in hits, however, the
Card never managed to break the game open —leav-

while twice loading the bases and getting nothing to
show for it.
"We just missed a lot of opportunities, and we need
to get better with that," said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "Font teen hits and onh five i iins. that's not real
gt«>d."

After Wodnicki, a succession of
Cardinal pitchers including
sophomore Jason Luker, sopho
more J. D. Willcox,freshman Ryan
McCally and sophomore Jeff
Bruksch all came in for at least one
inning but no longer than two, as
Marquess spread the work around
in hopes of getting the bullpen
ready for Arizona State. The
right-handed Bruksch, who is
looking more and more like the
closer the team was seeking at the
beginning of the year, ran into a
little trouble in the ninth by allow
ing a double and a single to put the
tying run at the plate, but struck
out the final two batters to get his
team-leading fifth save of the year.
"I was very pleased with all of
[the pitchers]," said Marquess. "As
far as the pitching goes, it was just
exactly what we wanted to have
happen, getting everyone a little
work."
That work should come in
handy when the Card travels to
Tempe, Ariz., this weekend to take
on the Sun Devils, who have a
whopping 26 wins on the year and
are ranked seventh in the two
major baseball polls. The series
gets underway Friday at 12:00 Pa
cific time, and continues with two
games on Saturday and Sunday.
