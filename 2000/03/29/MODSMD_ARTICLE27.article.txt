# Stanford netters brave the Waves
## 
### BILL HANSON STAFF WRITER 
Spring break is supposed to be
relaxing — unless, of course,
you're on the women's tennis
team.
I he week began predictably as
the top-ranked Cardinal (18-0)
rolled over both the University of
Pennsylvania and Loyola Mary
mount University without con
ceding a point.
On Friday, however, the Car
dinal squared off against No. 4
Pepperdine in what turned out to
be one of the most holly contested
collegiate dual matches of the sea
son.
Although the Cardinal eventu
ally swept the Waves by the lop
sided score of 6-0, the outcome of
the match remained uncertain
until its conclusion.
"All of Pepperdine's players
are foreigners," said head coach
Frank Brennan. "They have a dif
ferent style of play; the) have one
handed backhands, and they use
more strategymore lobs, more
dropshots. They don't know us,
and we don't know them, so it's a
war until you get a little respect."
I he only player to defeat her
opponent in straight sets was
sophomore Lauren kalvaria,
who ousted Paola Palencia, 6-3, 7-
in the No. -4 singles match.
Kalvaria is currently ranked sixth
in the nation after posting several
impressive i esults during the pre
season.
While Kalvaria blew past Pa
lencia. sophomore Marissa Irvin
.tnd freshman Laura Granville,
who normally rout their oppo
nents in under an hour, struggled
in their respective singles match
es.
Irvin, who plays No. 1 singles
for the Cardinal and ranks third

in the national collegiate rank
ings, had skipped the matches
against Penn and LMU in order
to play professional tournaments
in Miami, Fla. and Indian Wells,
(ialif.
Although she failed to qualify
for the main draw of Miami's
prestigious Ericsson Open, she
reached the second round at Indi
an Wells, upsetting seasoned vet
eran I amarine I anasugarn be
fore succumbing to top-20 star
Patty Schnyder, 6-2,6-1.
Ranked 85th in the world,
Irvin is rapidly making a name for
herself among the professional
ranks. Nonetheless, she seemed
out of sorts in the first set of her
match with Pepperdine's Ipek
Senoglu.
"No one gives you any free
points because of your reputa
tion," Brennan said. "Irvin lost
her poise in the first set but she got
it back and was playing very well
by the third."
Irvin eventually finished off
Senoglu, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. The win
improved her season record to an
unblemished 13-0.
Granville, who won the Rolex
National Intercollegiate Indoor
Championships, the third leg of
the collegiate Grand Slam, in
early February, is currently
ranked fourth in the nation and
boasts a 30-2 singles record.
()n Friday, she played the most
dramatic match of the afternoon,
overcoming Monika Horvath, 7-
6, 6-7, 6-1, at No. 2 singles.
"Granville ran into a girl who
was playing really well," Brennan
said. "It was a great match."
Senior Teryn Ashley, who has
struggled this season while recov
ering from tendinitis in her wrist,
faced an equally tough test in Pep
perdine's Cintia Tortorella at No.
3 singles. After two hours of play,
Ashley prevailed, 6-4, 1-6, 6-4.
"Ashley was playing up, down,
and sideways," Brennan said.
"But she played great coming
back from 1-4 down in the third
set. 1 think it gave her some confi

dence."
Senior Jennifer Heiser and
sophomore Gabriela lustra were
also taken to three sets in their re
spective singles matches.
Heiser rallied past Nadine
Rastetter, 4-6, 6-3, 6-0, while Las
tra squeaked by Dorthee Ruiz, 6-
1, 1-6,7-6.
Although Lastra now enjoys an
18-match winning streak, her last
lew matches have been startlingly
close.

"I think spring break is lough
for her," Brennan said. "She loses
focus a bit more than the others."
Despite her occasional lack of
focus, lustra displayed a mental
fortitude in the third-set tie-break
er that exemplified the tenacity
demonstrated by all of the Stan
ford women during their exhaust
ing trip to Malibu.
"Whew! That was a bruiser,"
Brennan said. "But we got
through it."
