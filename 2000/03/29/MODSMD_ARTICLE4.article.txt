# Bookstore to be remodeled
## 
### TOMOKO SAKAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Bookstore plans a re
modeling this summer, the first major
change since the for-profit Follett Corpo
ration took over the store's management
in July.
"-"""We're planning to upgrade the 80's
look into a more 2000 style. Specifically,
the computer section is going to move up
stairs, and the school supplies section is
moving downstairs," said Jeff Friedel,
marketing manager of the Bookstore.
"The renovation begins a week after
commencement, and we hope to be done
before the September rush of student buy

ers," Friedel continued.
I he new management had promised
reduced prices for textbooks, greater effi
ciency in textbook orders, and more used
textbooks on the shelves, but few students
have noticed any differences.
"There have been no noticeable
changes in the* Bookstore," said Carolyn
Kousky, a sophomore. " The textbooks
have always been expensive, and they still
are."
Faculty and staff , however, now do get
lower prices on some Bookstore items.
They receive a 10 percent discount on
products excluding all software, hardware

and textbooks.
The Bookstore is also revamp
ing its Web site to make it more
user-friendly.
Some students are wary of cor
porate control ot the Bookstore,
which was traditionally managed
by a non-profit board of directors.
"I don't like the idea of big cor
porations moving into education,"
said kousky.
Rachel Johnson, a doctoral stu
dent in Psychology agreed, saying
"profit is necessarily misplaced in a
university bookstore by the man
agement of a company."
Freshman Stephane Adam dis
agreed. "1 think the University
Bookstore's affiliation with a cor
porations is okay as long as that re
sults in more competitive prices of
books, which I haven't really seen
yet," he saicl.
However, the non-profit board
that used to manage the Bookstore
has been under fire belore. In

1991, the Bookstore's board was
charged with using corporate
funds to purchase a summer
house, a yacht and other gifts tor
employees.
Friedel emphasized that
changes will take time.
"It hasn't even been a year since
the takeover, and although the
changes are subtle at the moment,
the le\tbo»rk"(prdering system'has
improved," Friedel said.
"Follett Corporation largely lo
dises on the academic aspects of
book selling, and not only the com
mercial side. In fact, a lease system
is better for the greater good than a
non-profit system, because a signif
icant amount of the revenues goes
to the University," he added. "So in
that sense, students are benefiting
from the management change."
I here have been few internal
management or operations
changes, according to an employ
ee.
"Filings are pretty much the
same as before the management
takeover, except for the fact that we
are going to start wearing aprons,"
said one employee.
