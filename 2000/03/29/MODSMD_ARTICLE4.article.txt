# Bookstore to be remodeled

### TOMOKO SAKAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Bookstore plans a re
modeling this summer, the first major
change since the for-profit Follett Corpo
ration took over the store's management
in July.
"-"""We're planning to upgrade the 80's
look into a more 2000 style. Specifically,
the computer section is going to move up
stairs, and the school supplies section is
moving downstairs," said Jeff Friedel,
marketing manager of the Bookstore.
"The renovation begins a week after
commencement, and we hope to be done
before the September rush of student buy

ers," Friedel continued.
I he new management had promised
reduced prices for textbooks, greater effi
ciency in textbook orders, and more used
textbooks on the shelves, but few students
have noticed any differences.
"There have been no noticeable
changes in the* Bookstore," said Carolyn
Kousky, a sophomore. " The textbooks
have always been expensive, and they still
are."
Faculty and staff , however, now do get
lower prices on some Bookstore items.
They receive a 10 percent discount on
products excluding all software, hardware
