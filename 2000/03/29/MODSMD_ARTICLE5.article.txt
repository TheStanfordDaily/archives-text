Julia Butterfly Hill urged the audience members
who packed Kresge Auditorium last night to find
spiritual strength, take responsibility and act tireless
ly towards change.

Hill gained national and international attention
for refusing to leave her perch in the canopy of an
ancient redwood tree in Humboldt County, Calif.,
unless the Maxaam Corporation agreed not to cut
down the tree. Hill came down in December 1999,
two years later, after Maxaam promised to leave
standing the tree and a buffer zone surrounding it.
Hill urged students of all viewpoints to work for
their passion.
"We don't always have to agree on everything, but
if you feel passionate do something each and every
day," she said.
She urged activists not to be discouraged, al
though the journey may be difficult.
Last night's speech and reading was Hill's third
stop on her book tour for"The Legacy of Luna," in
which she chronicles her experience. Profits from
the book's sales benefit 11 ill's (lircle of Life 112 ounda
tion, which seeks to support and network individu
als, organizations and communities to create envi
ronmental and social solutions.
The presentation, which included a reading of a
short excerpt from her b<x>k, a short speech and
question and answer period, lasted approximately
40 minutes. Hill received standing ovations before
and after her presentation.
Hill questioned her decision to stay in the tree,
which she called "Luna," until she experienced a
"metamorphosis" when the tree spoke to her.
"Now is the time for you to be strong Julia or you
t(X) will break," Hill said that Luna told her.
Hill explained that "Luna" urged her to follow
the example of the trees and accept the bad weather.
