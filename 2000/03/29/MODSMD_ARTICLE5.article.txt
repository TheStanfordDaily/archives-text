# Redwood activist urges action
## 
### CAITRIN McKIERNAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Julia Butterfly Hill urged the audience members
who packed Kresge Auditorium last night to find
spiritual strength, take responsibility and act tireless
ly towards change.

Hill gained national and international attention
for refusing to leave her perch in the canopy of an
ancient redwood tree in Humboldt County, Calif.,
unless the Maxaam Corporation agreed not to cut
down the tree. Hill came down in December 1999,
two years later, after Maxaam promised to leave
standing the tree and a buffer zone surrounding it.
Hill urged students of all viewpoints to work for
their passion.
"We don't always have to agree on everything, but
if you feel passionate do something each and every
day," she said.
She urged activists not to be discouraged, al
though the journey may be difficult.
Last night's speech and reading was Hill's third
stop on her book tour for"The Legacy of Luna," in
which she chronicles her experience. Profits from
the book's sales benefit 11 ill's (lircle of Life 112 ounda
tion, which seeks to support and network individu
als, organizations and communities to create envi
ronmental and social solutions.
The presentation, which included a reading of a
short excerpt from her b<x>k, a short speech and
question and answer period, lasted approximately
40 minutes. Hill received standing ovations before
and after her presentation.
Hill questioned her decision to stay in the tree,
which she called "Luna," until she experienced a
"metamorphosis" when the tree spoke to her.
"Now is the time for you to be strong Julia or you
t(X) will break," Hill said that Luna told her.
Hill explained that "Luna" urged her to follow
the example of the trees and accept the bad weather.

Activist Julia Butterfly Hill, who lived in a redwood tree
for 2 years, received a standing ovation before and
after her speech last night in Kresge Auditorium.
After reading I lit* excerpt, Mill ex
plained, noting that slu- did not want to
sound "100-loo" or "pianola, that her
time in the tree taught her ahont three
things: power, responsibility and love.
"II I point out what is wrong," she ex
plained " I have the power to make it
right," I lill said. "We have the responsibil
ity to use that power to make the world a
better plaee. It is that love which will allow
us to live in our power and at < ept that re

sponsibility."
Many members of the audience ap
peared to be well-acc|uainted with Hill's
background, lor example, when the Max
aam Corporation was mentioned, many
audience members hissed.
"I thought it was very interesting how
she changed through the experience of
being in the tree," said Steve Allison, a doc
toral student in ecology .
Sophomore Forrest Fleisclunan, a
Redwood Action 1 cam at Stanford mem
ber, said, "I think her emphasis on spiritu
al strength and love as a source for action
is very important," "I think a lot of activists
tend to lose sight of that."

Others wished that Hill had spoken for
longer and spoke fmused more about
ways to work for change.
"I wished she'd talked more about the
repercussions of her actions and less
about, though it is interesting, the life in
the tree," explained sophomore Lyle Mor
ton. "1 think the most important things are
the examples that she set."
At the end of the speech, Hill urged
the audience to sign a petition to protect
California forests and to check out dif
ferent environmental groups like Red
wood Action Team, Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford and Bay
Area Action.
