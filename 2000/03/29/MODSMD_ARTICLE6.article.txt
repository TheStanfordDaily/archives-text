### ALICE BROWN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford Bookstore has
reached a negotiated settlement
vviili the District Attorney for
Santa Clara County over the
double-charging of more than
400 customers who paid for
purchases with credit cards last
year.
Although the Bookstore was
aware that it had double
charged patrons, it did not noti
fy customers about the mistake.
Patrons who did notice the dou
ble-charge on their bill were re
funded their money.
The settlement agreement,
in addition to reversing all in
correct credit card charges, calls
for the Bookstore to pay
$10,000 to the University. It will
be added to an existing fund ad
ministered by Dean of Students
Mark Wais.
l his fund, according to a
press release, "provides need
based assistance for students
facing emergency situations."
Some examples of such situa
tions include providing funding
to help students pay airfare to
attend funerals, and paying the

accommodation costs of parents
who are on campus to support a
son or daughter in crisis.
The Bookstore will also pay
$15,000 for the District Attor
ney's investigative costs and a
$75 penalty.
"Stanford Bookstore has co
operated fully with the District
Attorney's investigation," said
History Prof. David Kennedy,
the chair of the Bookstores
Board of Directors.
The over-billing was the result
of a newly installed software sys
tem that sometimes failed to alert
Bookstore cashiers that a credit
card transaction had been com
pleted successfully. 11l ere fore
the cashiers manually re-entered
credit card information, leading
to customers being charged twice
for their purchases.
Students who were over
charged did not think the Book
store's penalty was excessive.
"I don't have much sympathy
for the Bookstore," said sopho
more Nick Rapur. "The Book
store has a monopoly. They
could be held to a higher stan
dard."
Senior |ulia Beeson said the
situation was "u i< kv because the
Bookstore didn't intend to over
charge customei s, but she still lelt
the Bookstore did not receive an

overly harsh punishment.
"I distinctly remember my i tetl
it card being used twice." Becson .
said. "I remember thinking, '1
hope that it didn't go through
twice.' "
Since the clerks had to reenter
credit card information so many
times, Beeson said that emplovees

should have realized that there
was a larger software problem.
.VJJ affected customers â€žhave
been reimbursed, according to
Kennedy.
Bank of America, which pro
vides the Bookstore's credit card
authorization, helped by provid
ing the information of all individ

uals who had been overcharged.
Since the double-charging oc
curred, the Bookstore has
i l
( hanged management to an out
side company, the Follett Higher
F.ducation (.roup. I lie Bookstore
is ,m independent non-profit or
ganization that is separate from
Stanford.
