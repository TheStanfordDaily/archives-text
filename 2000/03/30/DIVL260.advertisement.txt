There are toxic chemicals in our water. Such as oil.
And pesticides.
You might think industry is to blame. But they're only
part of the problem. You and 1, in our everyday lives, are also
responsible for a tremendous amount of water pollution.
However, we can all help protect our water. For example,
use less toxic household cleaners and practice natural lawn
care by composting and using fewer chemicals. And instead
of pouring used motor oil onto the ground or into storm drains,
simply take it to a gasoline station where it can be recycled.
To find out more, call 1-800-504-8484, and we'll send
you additional information on how you can help protect our
rivers, lakes and oceans.
That way we can turn this terrible tide around. And
restore the beauty to our water.
CLEAN WATER.
IF WE ALL DO A LITTLE,
WE CAN DO A LOT.
