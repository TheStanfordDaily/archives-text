The IRS wants you to know all
the tax savings to look for this
season.
You could save up to $500 off
your taxes for each dependent
child under 17, with the 1999
Child Tax Credit.
You could save up to $ 1 500 in
taxes for each college student,
with a HOPE Credit. Or save
up to S 1000 for each qualifying
student with the Lifetime
Learning Credit. These are just
two of the ways to help meet
the costs of higher education.
You could save paying taxes
on future gains with a new
Roth IRA.
Or take advantage of various
options to make traditional IRAs
more accessible to the needs of
education or a first home.
For all available tax relief,
|check your 1999 tax booklet.
