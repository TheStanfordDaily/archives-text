If You Have
Diabetes,
ASK your
Doctor.
If you live with diabetes, you're more likely to die
with the flu. Just ask the families of the
people with diabetes who died of flu or pneumonia
complications. Then ask your doctor for a life-saving
flu shot for you and those closest to you, and about
the other risks you face when you face diabetes.
Because with diabetes, prevention is control, and
control is your life line.
