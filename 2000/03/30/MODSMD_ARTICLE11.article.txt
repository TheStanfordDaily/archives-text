## Justices restrict nude dancing clubs 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Supreme Court made it easier for
local governments to ban nude
dancing, the entertainment in
about 3,000 adult clubs nation
wide, ruling yesterday that a per
former's freedom of expression
can be restricted by forcing her to
wear pasties and a G-string.
Nude dancing can be banned
in an effort to combat crime and
other harms that adult entertain
ment clubs often attract, the jus
tices said in a splintered decision
reinstating a public-nudity ordi
nance in Erie, Fa.
Such dancing is "expressive
conduct" but it falls "only within
the outer ambit" of the Constitu
tion's First Amendment free
speech protection, justice Sandra
Day O'Connor wrote in the
court's main opinion.
The ban promotes Erie's
"interest in combating the nega
tive secondary effects associated
with adult entertainment estab
lishments," such as crime, and
was not aimed at a dancer's erotic
message, O'Connor said.
Although the court's rationale
was divided, the decision is sure to
have broad impact. Nude enter
tainment is featured in about
3,000 adult clubs nationwide, the
justices were told when the case
was argued in November.
"We're delighted," said Valerie
Sprenkle, Erie's assistant city solic
itor. "We didn't ban any expres
sion . . .What's being regulated is
the means of expression."
Sprenkle went on to say that
dancers at a nude dancing club
in the city "will be required to
cover up to the extent required
by the ordinance."
John H. Weston, attorney for
the former Erie nude-dancing clijb"
owner who challenged the ordi
nance, said the ruling may lead to
a flurry of attempts to ban nude
dancing, but that "sexually orient
ed businesses will always thrive"
because of their popularity.
Weston said the ruling
appeared to leave room for club
owners to force governments to
"defend their assumptions" that
such establishments lead to
crime.
"Everybody wants to put these
businesses out of business,"
added Jim Waple, general man
ager of Archibald's, a Washington
D.C. nightclub that offers nude
dancing two blocks from the
White House.
"What crime does it cause? We
don't have any drug dealers out
front. We don't have any prosti
tutes out front."
However, j. Robert Flores of
the National Law Center for (Chil
dren and Families said, "The

Supreme Court has sent an
unmistakably clear message to
those who exploit women and
feed on the lusts of men that the
First Amendment does not pro
vide a license for immorality or
illegality."
The ruling bolsters the effect
of a 1991 Supreme Court ruling
that let Indiana ban all barroom
style nude dancing under a stale
law generally prohibiting public
nudity.
That decision was badly splin
tered, however, and when the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court
struck down Erie's ordinance, it
said the 1991 ruling offered little
guidance.
Yesterday's ruling was divided
as well. The court voted 7-2 to
allow bans on nude dancing but
voted 6-3 to reinstate the Erie
ordinance.
O'Connor said that even if the
ordinance "has some minimal
effect on the erotic message by
muting that portion of the
expression that occurs when the
last stitch is dropped, the dancers
. . .are free to perform wearing
pasties and (1-strings."
She compared the nude-danc
ing ban to a prohibition on burn
ing draft cards, which the
Supreme Court upheld in 1968.
In that case, the government
"sought to prevent the means of
the expression and not the
expression of antiwar sentiment
itself," she said.
Most of O'Connor's opinion
was joined by Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Jus
tices Anthony M. Kennedy and
Stephen G. Breyer.
Justices Antonin Scalia and
Clarence Thomas, in a separate
"ttbin i<W bv"S v <\M1 4 a:' Wrtet ¥'t <r fe» a

They cited Vtne traditional
power of government to foster
good morals."
justice David 11. Souter wrote
separately that he agreed with
O'Connor's rationale, but that
the city needed to provide more
evidence that its ordinance was
designed to deal with "real
harms."
Justices John Paul Stevens and
Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented.
Stevens wrote for the two that
the court had decided for the first
time that an effort to combat sec
ondary effects such as crime "may
justify the total suppression of
protected speech."
While Souter was among the 7-
2 majority in supporting a ban on
nude dancing, lie voted with the
minority, along with Stevens and
Ginsburg, against the 0-3 dec ision
to reinstate Erie's specific ordi
nance.
