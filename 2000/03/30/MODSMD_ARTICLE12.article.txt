### 
WASHING FON (AP) — Res
urrecting an impeachment con
troversy, a federal judge ruled
yesterday that President Clinton
"committed a criminal violation
of the Privacy Act" by releasing
personal letters to undermine
the credibility of one of his
accusers.
Clinton immediately disputed
the decision, saying he reluctant
ly released the letters two years
ago because "it was the only way
I knew to refute allegations" by
Kathleen Willey of an unwanted
sexual advance.
U.S. District Judge Royce
Lamberth, a Republican
appointee, concluded the presi
dent and three top White House
lawyers disregarded an earlier
court ruling in making Willey's
letters public in the midst of the
Monica Lewinsky scandal in
1998.
"This court cannot accept or
condone this unlawful action,"
Lamberth wrote in a decision
that clears the way for a lawsuit
filed by the conservative group
Judicial Watch to delve further
into the issue.
Clinton disputed Lainberth's
ruling and said at a news confer
ence that his lawyers would pro
ceed accordingly. He said he
never even considered the Priva
cy Act when he made the deci
sion to release the letters.
I he president said he "decid-

Ed to do it reluctantly only
because it was the only way I
knew to refute allegations th.it
were made against me that were
untrue."
He also took a swipe at Lam
berth, noting the Republican
appointee "somehow acquired a
significant percentage of the
cases involving the White 1 louse.
That's an interesting story."
The judge, who has presided
over several lawsuits filed against
the Clinton administration by
Judicial Watch, minced no words
in his ruling, writing: "The pres
ident committed a criminal viola
tion of the Privacy Act."
The judge said former White
House Counsel Charles F.C.
Ruff, Deputy Counsel Bruce
Lindsey and former Deputy
Counsel Cheryl Mills engaged in
discussions that led to the release
of the letters.
And lie rejected White House
arguments that the lawyers' con
versations were protected b\
attorney-client confidentialitv.
"The discussions regarding
the release of the Willey letters,
even if initially protected In the
attorney-client privilege, fall
squarely within the crime-fraud
exception," Lamberth wrote.
"The White House and presi
dent were aware that they were
subject to the Privacy Act, and
yet chose to violate its provi
sions," Lamberth wrote.
