### 
THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Eight
years after she was tortured repeatedly at a
Bosnian Serb catli|3 ' Afid"TApt 4 d night $Utir
night — so many times she lost count — a
young Muslim woman sobbed yesterday as she
relived it all before a U.N. court.
In wrenching, horrific testimony at the
Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, the woman told
how she and other girls were passed from sol
dier to soldier, each of whom raped them for
weeks in the summer of 1992. She recounted
a litany of torture — gang rapes, threats to cut
the shape of a cross into her flesh — that con
jured up scenes of medieval barbarity.
She was 15 years old at the time.
"There are no words in this world that can
describe my feeling," she told the U.N. judges.
"It was the worst that could happen to me."
I he woman, identified only as witness No.
50, testified from behind a screen at the land
mark rape trial — the first sexual enslavement
prosecution in an international court — that
began last week.
Former Bosnian Serb fighters Dragoljub
kunarac, Radomir Kovac and Zoran Vukovic
are the defendants. They are accused of run
ning a network of so-called "rape camps" in
Foca, southeast of Sarajevo in Bosnia-Herze
govina. All three have pleaded innocent.

Serb paramilitaries backed by Yugoslav
leader Slobodan Milosevic are accused of war
crimes violations during the 3 1/2-year war in
Bosnia, the worst carnage in Europe since
World War 11.
Some 200,000 Bosnians died or are missing
and an estimated 20,000 women were raped
during the conflict, which formally ended with
the 1995 Dayton peace accords.
Prosecutors sav the widespread and orga
nized rapes were intended to humiliate the
women and their families and to terrorize
Muslims into flight as part of a Serb "ethnic
cleansing" campaign.
In Foca, scores of women were herded into
a high school, gvmnasium and motel at the
outset of the Bosnian war.
The defendants, flanked by blue-uni
lormed guards, sat unflinc hingK yesterda\ as
the witness testified in full view of them, alter
nating between sobs and outrage.
But when she identified Yukovic .is one of
her attackers and pointed out he was old
enough to be her father, he looked askance
and shifted his posture.
W hen she described the violence Kunarac
allegedh used in raping her. he turned his
gaze downward and scribbled on a notepad.
"I remember he was very forceful. He

wanted to hurt me," she said. "But he could
never hurt me as much as m\ soul was hurting
me."
At the gymnasium, where some 50 women
were detained, Serb soldiers would "pick and
choose" their victims, she said.
"Every night, some girl would end up in
some place with some soldier, many times with
the same soldier. They would always do this by
pointing their finger: 'You! You! You!"'
An anguished silence pervaded the court
room as the woman was gently questioned by
I'.S. prosecutor Peggy kuo, who repeatedly
apologized for requesting more detail.
'Tm sorry I have to ask for the specifics, but
the court has to know,' Kuo said.
I he witness said she was raped so many
times, she did not know the number. She also
described how she was tortured while being
raped.

"He was so terrible." she cried. "He did
such horrible things that I cannot explain
them. I had no place to take a bath."
