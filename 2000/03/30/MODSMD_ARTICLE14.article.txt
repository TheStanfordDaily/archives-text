# New album of teenage band 'N Sync shatters sales
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — It's been noth
ing but "buy buy buy" for 'N Sync fans.
In a remarkable display of teenage
buying power, the pop heartthrobs sold
2.4 million copies of their new (list in
seven days — more than double the pre
vious record. Ihe disc features their lat
est hit "Bve, Bye, Bye."
Sales I their "No Strings Attached"
album swamped the 1.1.'} million sold by
'N Sync's fellow boy band, the Backstreet
Boys, last year.
In fact, executives at 'N Sync's label,
Jive Records, suspect the sales record
was broken in just one day, when "No
Strings Attached" first appeared in
stores March 21. But they have no fig
ures to confirm this.
"It's pretty staggering," Barry Weiss,
Jive Records president, said yesterday.
"It's pretty amazing, it's pretty numbing,
it's pretty great. This is really what the
music business needs — it's getting
young people interested in music again."

Since 'N Sync came from the same
Oliando-based hit factor) as fellow |ive
artists Backstreet Boys, they have long
been considered junior partners at best,
knockoffs at worst. Not anymore.
"It's like going into the Super Bowl."
said 'N Sync 's manager, |ohnn\ Wright.
"You alw;fys want to come out on top. If
you have defending champions, von
want to knock them off."
A burgeoning teen population — the
children of the original rock n' roll gen
eration — and a booming economy
combined to trigger the explosion of
sales, said Alan Light, editoi of Spin
maga/inc.
I he success of the Backstreet Bovs,
Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera,
Matuly Moore and others have paved
the way for mainstream media accep
tance of "N Sync, Light said. Ihe band
has appeared on magazine covers, was
on "Saturday Night Live ' three weeks
ago and is a regular on MIX.

'N Sync touched off a mini-riot out
side MTV's Times Square studio when it
performed there the weekend before the
album was released.
li.md members are personable and
accessible to all of their finis, particularly
girls aged eight to IS who worship them,
Weiss said.
Besides the Backstreet Boys' "Millen
nium," only two other albums are
known to have sold more than one mil
lion copies in ,1 week: Garth Brooks'
"Double Live" album and the sound
track to "The Bodyguard," according to
Soiindscan. Ihecompam has been mea
suring album sales in the I nited States
since 1091; precise sales figures before
then are considered to be somewhat
unreliable.
Jive, wliic li pressed more than six mil
lion copies of the GI) to be ready for the
consumer i ush, will attempt to shatter its
own record when the Backstreet Boys
release their new album in October.
