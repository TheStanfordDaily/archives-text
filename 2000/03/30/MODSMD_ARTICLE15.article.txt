## A 						senior's reflections: it's the people that make the difference THERE IS NO SPOON 
### 
S I UMBFINC; OU 1 OF the Quad
after my Fnglish 21 1 final two
weeks ago, I came to two abrupt
realizations.
One: That I will probably never use
Middle Fnglish again as long as I live.
(It's not like you walk down the street
and need to give directions to passing

knights. And I have yet
to discover a Middle
Fnglish restaurant
where I can prove my
Middle English skills
by ordering like a
native.)
And I wo: \n empty
campus is a spooky
campus.
Flashback: Spring

quarter, freshman year. I had a (neat
Works linal on the last possible day ol
finals. My roommate had left. All ol 111 \
friends were partying loudly in the
dorm. And I was huddled in a corner,
Irving to digest Saint Augustine. ()i
was it Aquinas? (You can see how mem
orable those (.real Works hooks realh
are.)
After the final, the whole lot ol us
frosh blinked in the mm ning sunshine as
we left Kresge Auditorium. And we
noticed the campus was emptv. Without
the hustle and bustle of bike-hehneled
grad students and crowds of jostling
undergrads, Staulbrd felt just like a big,
green park with lots ol red-roofed archi
tecture.
I'retty damn spooky. Not in a Haley
Joel Osment kind of wav, but in a "why
am I here?" kind of way.
(•rowing up in the tundra ol the Mid
western (ireat Plains. I had thought col
lege lile was all about old I S \ network
movie renins: "Animal Mouse," "St
Klmo's l ire," "With Honors," "Revenge
of the Nerds' and "Real (.cuius.'
Hut there 1 was. I was done with fresh
man Near, I was officially a sophomore
and Stanford was still a invsicry to me.
I'heie were no wai ring cli«|ues ol (.reeks
and Nerds. I here were no cra/.\ toga
parties .it Wilbur. (Well, at least outside
of Rinconada.) hven I he buildings looked
dillereni from the typical "n>llege ino\ie"
dorms
And with practically the entire campus
to myself, I knew that Stanford would
survive long alter 1 and all ol in\ friends
had left out collective mark. (Not the wa\
things work in the movies.)
Staulbrd is pre tty unique. I've visited
friends in I'rineeton. quaintly nestled
among the toxic waste plants of New Jer
sey. And I've been detained in bullet
proof glass corridors in ( olumhia while

tlicy check my two forms of II).
It makes the blue skies of spring quai -
ter feel almost like summer (amp rather
than university lile. And tin friends at
other schools wonder why I even hot her

gets no snow.
Let's face it. Stanford is the suburban
ideal. We don't have a vibrant < it) within
