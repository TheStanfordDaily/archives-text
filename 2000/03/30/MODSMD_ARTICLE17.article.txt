## Gym prepares for Regionals 
### KATIE FITZPATRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
l he Stanford women's gym
nastics team was looking for a
good Pacific 10 Conference
Championships showing on April
18 to propel it into NCAA Re
gionals this weekend. They didn't
get it.
The No. 15 Cardinal (9-8, 5-7
Pac-10) did not take advantage of
an opportunity to improve its re
gional qualifying score — which
would have allowed it to compete
in an easier region to qualify for
Nationals — and finished in sixth
place at Pac-lOs.
Fhe Cardinal's 193.85 team
total was its second-lowest team
score all season, mostly due to a
lackluster showing on its last
event, beam. Only two gymansts,
freshman Abby Cair and sopho
more Becky Meldrum, did not fall
from the beam during their per
formances.
Meldrum, the most consistent
performer on the beam all season,
was the high scorer on the event
for the Cardinal, hitting a 9.775
set to lead off the beam rotation.
However, it was not enough.
"We fell apart. We were doing
fine and then we gave it away,"
said senior All-American Sarah
Harding.
fhe disappointing Pac-10 per
formance has ignited the team's
focus to prepare for Regionals.
"Pat-10s made us mad. We

know we can do better," Meldrum
said.
Teammates agreed.
"We're learning and becoming
stronger through our experience
at Paclrts," Harding said.
Stanford began the competi
tion with a < haracteristicly strong
floor rotation. However, it was
hampered by tight scoring on the
first event of the competition —
typical of competitions where
there are many teams and per
formers to judge. Senior All-
Americans Larissa Fontaine and
Harding tied for ninth place on
the event with solid 9.875 rou
tines.
Junior Jennifer Kxaltacion
added a 9.825 set to the Cardinal
floor total. Fellow junior Jenny
Wilson returned to the floor line
up for the first time since early this
season with a solid 9.65 perfor
mance.
I'he Cardinal continued on to
the vault rotation and were led by
Fontaine's 9.9 performance,
which was good enough for fifth
place. Kxaltacion added a 9.8
vault and freshman Alissa Cooper
contributed a 9.725.
On bars, the Cardinal were
again led by Fontaine with a 9.9,
good for sixth-place. Harding
and freshman Cair were reward
ed with 9.825s for their efforts and
tied for 13th place on the event.
Sophomore All-American kristen
Jensen contributed a 9.75.
fhe showing knocked the

teams national ranking from a
No. 8 ranking earlier in the season
— the highest a Stanford team has
been ranked in school history —
to 15th, dashing its chances of an
easy Regionals competition. The

Cardinal now must remain in the
West region, with formidable op
ponents: No. 2 UCLA and No. 10
University of Oklahoma, along
