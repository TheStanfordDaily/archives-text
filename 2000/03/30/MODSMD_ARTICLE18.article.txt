### LORI MAUND EDITORIALS STAFF 
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team has shown the nation that it
can hang with the big guns. After
a successful week of play on the
East Coast, Stanford is more than
ready to face this weekend's com
petition.
Stanford faces St. Mary's this af
ternoon away from home and the
University of Denver on Saturday
at home.
Although the Cardinal's game
against St. Mary's will bean impor
tant factor in determining the Car
dinal's postseason ranking, the
most important game for the Card
is against UC Davis on Sunday at
New Maloney Field.
The game is important for the
Cardinal because it lost 9-8 in over
time to the Aggies in the first game
of the season. In order to ensure a
No. 1 seed in the Western
Women's Lac rosse League's post
season play, the Cardinal will need
a win.
Four teams from California are
invited to compete in postseason
play, two from northern (California
and two from southern (California.
The first seed from the north
will have the advantage of playing
the second seed from the south in
the first round of play, making its
path to the finals somewhat

smoother.
"It was the first game of the sea
son and we came off to a slow
start," said senior Ifedy Born. "It is
not, by any means, an indication of

the level of play of either team. We
tan still beat Davis and gel the No.
1 seed."
A win against the Aggies this
weekend would show the team's

progress over the season and
the strength of the program in
general.
Next season, the Cardinal in
tends to sever its ties with the
WWLL and play an independent
schedule. This move will increase
Stanford's chances at an eventual
NCAA- hid. By achieving a No. 1
bid and winning the league, the
Cardinal would send a signal to the
nation that it represents the best in
tin- league and is ready for a high
er level of play.
"It would be really nice to beat
Davis and garner a No. 1 seed for
the WWLL playoffs," said senior
co-captain Rachel Gallagher. "We
would leave the league on a good
note, as champions."
In order to win this weekend,
the Cardinal intends to focus on
the details of its game.
"On defense, we are going to
focus on double teaming and mov -
ing our feet in the right direction.
On offense, we are going to try to
make every player a threat, to
make every player a dynamic force
on the field," Born said.
The Cardinal proved last week
end that it can play with the best
teams in the nation.
"It is up to us to step onto the
field and prove that, not only can
we play with the best teams, but
that we are one of them," Gal
lagher said.
