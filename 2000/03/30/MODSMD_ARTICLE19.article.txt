# Golf aims for NCAA tourney bid
## 
### MATT LONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a blossoming crop of
freshman du tiers and a week of
training at an array of the toughest
collegiate courses, the No. 14 Stan
ford men's golf squad is gunning
for its first NCAA Tournament
berth in four years.
Monday and Tuesday the team
traveled toCoto deCaza, Calif'., for
the Anteater Invitational and
strutted away with a second-place
finish. Remarkably the Cardinal,
the Anteater's defending champi
on, competed without its two top
ranked golfers, senior Dusty Brett
and junior James Lee. Stanford
finished six strokes behind cham
pion Washington, ranked No. 17
nationally, and two strokes ahead
of N0.22 UCLA
Head coach Wall) Goodwin
chose to field a group including
three freshmen and a sophomore.
The youngsters rose to the occa
sion, led by Ron Won, who fin
ished 12th with a five-over-par
221, and the lone upperclassman
to compete, junior Alex Aragon,
playing his best golfofthe year and
finishing tied for 17th at 222.
"The only way to get experi
ence for the younger guys is to take
them to big tournaments." Good
win said. "We don't play any easy
matches so this was the best time to
play with the younger guys."
While Won was extremely con
sistent and finished with rounds of
72, 7and 7(> at the par-72 course,
Aragon struggled with a first-round
81 but returned later in the after
noon with a flourish of birdies, hit
ting a 70. The next day he proved
to be just as accurate, finishing with
a 71. Aragon has been searching for
I his consistency all season, evi

denced in his first round.
Monday morning he hit 15 of
18 greens in regulation, indicating
incredible precision with his irons
and woods, yet his putter blem
ished t he score, leaving him at nine
over. The next two rounds
demonstrated just how potent he
can be when his long and short
games meet to produce the low
scores Stanford will need 112 rom him
to challenge in the NCAAs.
Goodwin took the team on a
spring break trip, which shows just
how hungry the coach is. in his last
year at the Farm before his retire
ment. First, they played two days
at Riverbend Golf Course near
Fresno, site of this year's NCAA
West Regional, the qualifier for the
NCAA tournament. Next the
squad visited Karsten Golf Course
in Tempe, Ariz., for another two
day stop at the course that will
serve as home of the 2000 Pacific
10 (lonference championships.
The team will have its hands full
leading up to these tournaments,
with key head-to-head matches
with No. 4 BYU in Provo, Utah,
before retiu ning to Riverbend to
face the University of Pacific.
"We will have played [River
bend] a lot of times when the West
Regional comes around," Good
win said.
I lie Cardinal returns to action
at Pasatiempo Golf Course in
Santa Cruz for the Western Inter
collegiate on Monday and Tues
day. With the emergence of
Aragon and the great play of fresh
man Jim Seki this weekend, the
lineups for future matches will be
difficult to determine.
"I don't know who to play at
Pasatiempo," Goodwin said. "But
I'm looking forward to playing
there and seeing who performs."
