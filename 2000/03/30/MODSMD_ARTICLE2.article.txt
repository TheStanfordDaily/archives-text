acceptable under the amend

more strongly that the Second

LCAV letter targets Heston
l he letter, and the advertise
ment placed Monday in The New
York limes, was organized by
IXIAV, a San Francisco non-prof
it group whose mission is stated
on ils Web site: "LCAV is dedicat
ed to reducing gun violence
through legislation, litigation
and education."
The letter acknowledged that
the Second Amendment remains
a topic of controversy among
scholars, but it clearly stated that
all who signed the letter "are
united on the vital importance of
putting to rest any misperception
that the Second Amendment pro
hibits a wide range of effective
and reasonable firearms regula
tions."
I lie professors argued that
the NRA's "repeated suggestions
that the Second Amendment
somehow stands in the way of ef
fective and reasonable regulation
of guns and gun ownership is a
distortion of legal precedent and

a disservice to all Americans, the
great majority of whom support
thoughtful firearms policies."
NRA official responds
According to NRA Director of
Public Affairs Bill Powers, Heston
has not seen the letter yet.
"When 1 spoke to Mr. Heston
last night, he said that he had not
seen it yet. He has been busy trav
eling, but when he reads it, he
will send a response once he has a
chance to do so," Powers said.
Powers had not seen the letter
himself, but based on his under
standing of it, he said that the
professors, "have overlooked the
academic and legal scholarly
work that has been published in
the last decade, all of which point
to what is now the standard
model, that the Second Amend
ment, just as the First, infers an
individual right."
"They make claims that aren't
true. There are certainly limits to
[the Second Amendment], but
the notion that the NRA has been
opposed to any limitations is sim
ply absurd," Powers added.
Barrie Becker, the executive
director of LCAV, said, "For
many months we've been dis
turbed by the extreme rhetoric of
the NRA. We took it npon our
selves to set the record straight."
Becker stressed that the
Supreme Court and the federal
appellate courts that have looked
at this issue have "ruled out that
the Second Amendment is a bar
rier to regulation," she said.

"If you look at the scholarship,
the vast majority of scholars in
this field who are respected dis
agree with the NRA," Becker
said.
Scholars debate amendment
Rakove, a Pulitzer Prize-win
ning author who is currently
writing a piece tor a symposium
on the Second Amendment at the
Chicago-Kent College of Law,
said, "[The letter] seemed to be
pretty straightforward."
Rakove's understanding of
the amendment is that "it is an
injunction to the national gov
ernment to use its legislative au
thority to support the militia," he
said. "If you look at what was de
bated in 1787 and 1788, the
main issue was the status of the
militia, not individual rights."
"Our current debate is driven
by public health and safety is
sues," Rakove said. "In the eigh
teenth and nineteenth centuries,
there was no question that police
powers of the state would extend
to public health and safety."
"The last time that the
Supreme Court dealt with this
issue was in the 1930s and the
Court has not revisited it since
then," he said. "But, the law
comes down 011 the side of regu
latory power in the interests of
public health and safety."
The NRA disagrees, saying on
its Web site that "[such] a claim is
. . . inconsistent with the state
ments of America's early states
men and the concept of individ

ual rights as understood by gen
erations of Americans."
Yale University Law Prof.
Akhil Amar also signed the letter
and was one of four professors
who were consulted about its con
tent. Amar also signed a letter
published in 1993 entitled "An
open letter 011 the Second
Amendment" which stressed that
it guaranteed a right of the peo
ple, not only a right of the states.
"[The LCAV] asked me to par
ticipate and it's an important
issue where people's lives are at
stake," Amar said. "I am mainly
interested that citizens get accu
rate information about the con
stitution."
UCLA Law Prof. Eugene
Volokh did not sign the LCAV
letter but did endorse the 1993
letter.
Volokh stressed that he dis
agreed with the LCAV on the
grounds that "the message that
most people will come away with
is that the Second Amendment
has nothing to do with individual
people and I disagree."
According to Volokh, there
are three different approaches to
the Second Amendment. He said
that he believes that the NRA falls
into the category of people who
believe that the Second Amend
ment secures an individual right,
with a fairly wide range of regula
tions that the government can
impose on that right.
Civen that this option covers a
lot of ground, Volokh said a main
aspect of the controversy to ex
plore is "where to draw the line."

I lie Constitution's Second

The NRA believes that this
amendment reserves the right


MAUREEN FAN/The Stanford Daily
Stanford History Profs. David Kennedy and Jack Rakove signed their names
to a letter to NRA President Charlton Heston sponsored by the same group
which placed the above ad in The New York Times. t
lor individuals to bear arms, al
though they maintain that cer
tain categories of restrictions are
acceptable under the amend
ment. The letter's writers feel
more strongly that the Second
Amendment does not prohibit
government regulation in the in
terest of public safety.
LCAV letter targets Heston
l he letter, and the advertise
ment placed Monday in The New
York limes, was organized by
IXIAV, a San Francisco non-prof
it group whose mission is stated
on ils Web site: "LCAV is dedicat
ed to reducing gun violence
through legislation, litigation
and education."
The letter acknowledged that
the Second Amendment remains
a topic of controversy among
scholars, but it clearly stated that
all who signed the letter "are
united on the vital importance of
putting to rest any misperception
that the Second Amendment pro
hibits a wide range of effective
and reasonable firearms regula
tions."
I lie professors argued that
the NRA's "repeated suggestions
that the Second Amendment
somehow stands in the way of ef
fective and reasonable regulation
of guns and gun ownership is a
distortion of legal precedent and

a disservice to all Americans, the
great majority of whom support
thoughtful firearms policies."
NRA official responds
According to NRA Director of
Public Affairs Bill Powers, Heston
has not seen the letter yet.
"When 1 spoke to Mr. Heston
last night, he said that he had not
seen it yet. He has been busy trav
eling, but when he reads it, he
will send a response once he has a
chance to do so," Powers said.
Powers had not seen the letter
himself, but based on his under
standing of it, he said that the
professors, "have overlooked the
academic and legal scholarly
work that has been published in
the last decade, all of which point
to what is now the standard
model, that the Second Amend
ment, just as the First, infers an
individual right."
"They make claims that aren't
true. There are certainly limits to
[the Second Amendment], but
the notion that the NRA has been
opposed to any limitations is sim
ply absurd," Powers added.
Barrie Becker, the executive
director of LCAV, said, "For
many months we've been dis
turbed by the extreme rhetoric of
the NRA. We took it npon our
selves to set the record straight."
Becker stressed that the
Supreme Court and the federal
appellate courts that have looked
at this issue have "ruled out that
the Second Amendment is a bar
rier to regulation," she said.

"If you look at the scholarship,
the vast majority of scholars in
this field who are respected dis
agree with the NRA," Becker
said.
Scholars debate amendment
Rakove, a Pulitzer Prize-win
ning author who is currently
writing a piece tor a symposium
on the Second Amendment at the
Chicago-Kent College of Law,
said, "[The letter] seemed to be
pretty straightforward."
Rakove's understanding of
the amendment is that "it is an
injunction to the national gov
ernment to use its legislative au
thority to support the militia," he
said. "If you look at what was de
bated in 1787 and 1788, the
main issue was the status of the
militia, not individual rights."
"Our current debate is driven
by public health and safety is
sues," Rakove said. "In the eigh
teenth and nineteenth centuries,
there was no question that police
powers of the state would extend
to public health and safety."
"The last time that the
Supreme Court dealt with this
issue was in the 1930s and the
Court has not revisited it since
then," he said. "But, the law
comes down 011 the side of regu
latory power in the interests of
public health and safety."
The NRA disagrees, saying on
its Web site that "[such] a claim is
. . . inconsistent with the state
ments of America's early states
men and the concept of individ

ual rights as understood by gen
erations of Americans."
Yale University Law Prof.
Akhil Amar also signed the letter
and was one of four professors
who were consulted about its con
tent. Amar also signed a letter
published in 1993 entitled "An
open letter 011 the Second
Amendment" which stressed that
it guaranteed a right of the peo
ple, not only a right of the states.
"[The LCAV] asked me to par
ticipate and it's an important
issue where people's lives are at
stake," Amar said. "I am mainly
interested that citizens get accu
rate information about the con
stitution."
UCLA Law Prof. Eugene
Volokh did not sign the LCAV
letter but did endorse the 1993
letter.
Volokh stressed that he dis
agreed with the LCAV on the
grounds that "the message that
most people will come away with
is that the Second Amendment
has nothing to do with individual
people and I disagree."
According to Volokh, there
are three different approaches to
the Second Amendment. He said
that he believes that the NRA falls
into the category of people who
believe that the Second Amend
ment secures an individual right,
with a fairly wide range of regula
tions that the government can
impose on that right.
Civen that this option covers a
lot of ground, Volokh said a main
aspect of the controversy to ex
plore is "where to draw the line."
