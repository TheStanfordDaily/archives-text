# Women's lacrosse challenges tough East Coast competition
## 
### LORI MAUND EDITORIAL STAFF 
Over spring break, as the rest
of the campus jetted oil to tropi
cal vacations for a week of recre
ation and basking in the sun, the
Stanford women's lacrosse team
headed to the stormy weather of
the East Coast to compete against
the top lacrosse teams in the na

lion.
1 lie Cardinal faced four teams
during its week long trip. Among
the Cardinal's opponents were
Bui knell, Johns Hopkins, Ohio
University and Brown.
"The teams we played were
among the most talented in the
nation," said senior co-captain
Rachel Gallagher. "You don't re
ally see much better lacrosse than

we saw this past week."
In women's lacrosse there is a
marked distinction between the
levels of play in East and West
Coast competition. I lie sport of
women's lacrosse is just emerging
in high schools and communities
in the West Coast, and because of
that, the level of play on the West
Coast is less competitive when
compared with its east coast

counterpart.
Recently, however, the gap be
tween East Coast and West Coast
play has narrowed as more
women's lac rosse programs have
taken root in high schools and
colleges out west. As more pro
grams are established, universi
ties like Stanford have been able
to benefit from a more talented
recruiting pool and a more dis

tinguished reputation that pro
vides added leverage to draw
more talented recruits from the
hotbed of East Coast lacrosse.
The weekend was significant
for the (Cardinal because the team
faced the most intense competi
tion of its season before the start
of its conference competition.
"Last week's competition was
important for us because it al

lowed us to realize our potential.
We |>lavecl against the best teams
in ilu- nation and we need to
maintain that level of plav when
we line the teams out here," (Gal
lagher said.
Stanford demonstrated the
strides that West ( .oast lacrosse
has made in recent years during
its play against Bucknell. The
Cardinal lost to the Bison by a
margin of one goal. The final
score of the game was 10-9.
Two days later, the Cardinal
faced the competitive play of
Johns Hopkins, a team recog
nized as one of the best in the na
tion.
" I lies have really strong skill
and are just a really good pro
gram. 1 lie second hall [of the
game] is some of the best lac rosse

I think we've played all season,"
Gallagher said.
Although tlu* Cardinal lost to
Johns Hopkins 15-6, they
outscored the Blue Jays in the
second half. Senior Hedy Born,
junior katherine Barnes, sopho
mores Liz Britt (2) and Caroline
Osterwise, and freshman kiin
Cahill all notched goals for the
Cardinal in this match.
I lie game against Hopkins
propelled the Cardinal into its
game against Ohio I niveisitv the
very next day. In this game, the
Cardinal easily defeatec( the Bob
cats 1 7-8.
" The win was important to us
for a lot of reasons. It made us re

alize that, when we play against
better teams, we also elevate our
level of play. We can play with
these teams, and we (an also beat
them," Gallagher said.
Along with providing confi
dence to a relatively young team,
this weekend's pla\ inspired the
players and re-ignited their pas
sion for the game.
"Most of us are from the Kast
(Coast, where the sports is much
more popular. Being there, play
ing in their stadiums in front of
their crowds brought a lot of that
back to us. li was exciting to ex
perience, and we have a lot more
momentum going in to this
week's games," Gallagher said.
