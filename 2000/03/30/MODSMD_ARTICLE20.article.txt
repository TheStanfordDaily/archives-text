### LORI MAUND EDITORIAL STAFF 
Over spring break, as the rest
of the campus jetted oil to tropi
cal vacations for a week of recre
ation and basking in the sun, the
Stanford women's lacrosse team
headed to the stormy weather of
the East Coast to compete against
the top lacrosse teams in the na

1 lie Cardinal faced four teams
during its week long trip. Among
the Cardinal's opponents were

tween East Coast and West Coast

to benefit from a more talented
recruiting pool and a more dis

more talented recruits from the
hotbed of East Coast lacrosse.
The weekend was significant
for the (Cardinal because the team
faced the most intense competi

of its conference competition.
"Last week's competition was
important for us because it al

lowed us to realize our potential.
We |>lavecl against the best teams

maintain that level of plav when
