# Admit rate dips to 13 percent

### SCOTT DORFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A ritual well known to Stan
lord students is being repeated
this week, as thousands of
prospective students open their
mailboxes in hopes of finding a
thick envelope signaling admit
tance to the Stanford Class of
2004.
Beginning late last week, let
ters of admission were mailed out
to 1,921 students, roughly 12 per
cent of the overall regular deci
sion applicant pool of 16,273.
Combined with early decision ad

mits, which numbered 470, Stan
ford let in a total of 2,391 students
out of 18,360.
These figures result in an over
all admit rate of 13 percent, a
drop from 15 percent last year,
making this year of undergradu
ate admissions one of the most
competitive in school history.
"This class was extremely com
petitive, because last year's yield
was so high," said outgoing Dean
of Admissions Robert Kinnally.
"We actually admitted 300 fewer

students than last year, because
we anticipate another very high
yield. We wanted to make sure
there will be room for around 100
transfer students next year."
Last year, Stanford was forced
into accepting only 31 transfer
students due to the unexpectedly
high yield of admits c hoosing to
attend the University.
Applications increased by more
than 400 from last year, which
Kinnally attributed to Stanford's
high visibility in recent years.
"It seems like Stanford is al
ways in the news these clays," he
said. "We really are an amazing
place. With both faculty and stu
dents making discoveries on an
almost daily basis and the success
of our athletic teams, Stanford is a

very attractive place for prospec
tive students."
Kinnally raved about the qual
ity of the incoming class, calling
the students "simply amazing.
"We were struck by the
tremendous amount of energy
put forth by these students in the
classroom as well as in research,
and the students also showed very
strong leadership characteris
tics," he said. "I noticed this year
that students just seem busier and
busier, yet they don't seem to be
cutting corners anywhere.
They're just, excelling."
The geographic and racial
breakdowns of this year's admits
are very similar to those of recent
classes. As usual, far more admit
ted students hail from California
— 36 percent — than any other
state. Texas is second with 6 per
cent, followed by New York (5
percent), Illinois (4 percent) and

Washington (3 percent). No state
deviated by more than one per
cent from last year.
Racial statistics also varied little
from last year. 46 percent of ad
mits are Caucasian, followed by
Asian Americans (26 percent),
African Americans (10 percent),
Mexican Americans (9 percent),
international students (6 per
cent), Native Americans (1.5 per
cent), and other Hispanic-Ameri
can students (1.2 percent). Fifty
two percent of admits are female
and 48 percent are male.
li is kppwr* how ,S^n ;
ford's admits stack up against
those of peer institutions because
Stanford, in Kinnally's words,
"beat all of the other schools to the
mailbox." Most schools will be re :
leasing data on their admitted
classes either later this week or
next week.
The Class of 2004 is the final

one to be admitted by Kinnally,
who will leave Stanford after this
year to attend the St. John Fisher
Seminary in Stamford, Conn, in
hopes of eventually becoming a
Catholic Priest.
"Sending out admissions let
ters was very bittersweet," he said.
"My excitement for these stu
dents is very real, but I realize 1
will not be able to meet them
come September. Signing those
last few letters was very tough."
One aspect of the job Kinnally
said he won't miss is the pain of
having to reject more than 80 per
cent of Stanford applicants.
"The toughest part of our job is
to turn so many talented students
down. We are faced with incredi
bly hard choices. The numbers
are unfathomable . . . and espe
cially this year, with spaces so
tight, we had to turn down a lot of
extremely gifted individuals."
