# Gould to study trade, international labor
## 
### NINA HOLLY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Law School Prof. William Gould
has launched ;i study to examine the impact of
global trade on international labor. A panel of
advisers comprised of major figures in the
labor and business-management communities
has been selected to work closely with Gould
and the researchers.
" The goal of the study is to reconcile free
trade, which has fueled post-World War 11
prosperity, with protection of workers' rights
throughout the world," said Gould, the former
chairman of the National Labor Relations
Board.
Gould said that the contentious World Trade
Organization conference in Seattle was an im
portant impetus in conducting the study. The
WTO conference "brought to light the many is
sues facing labor organizations," he said.
Gould also mentioned the importance of

developing countries' adoption of interna
tional labor standards.
In a press release, Gould said, "One impor
tant question is whether international labor
standards are appropriate, and if so, how they
could be enforced and what would be their
content."
Gould also said he hopes to broaden the
committee to include members from develop
ing countries, and not to solely focus on the
impact of global trade on the United States.
According to Gould, his four years of expe
rience as head of the NLRB, which adminis
ters and interprets the Labor Act, will
strengthen his ability to lead the study.
"This [study] is a mirror image of my work
with the NLRB,'' he said. "In Washington
[D.G.], I had to find common ground to pro
mote the free flow of goods as well as workers'
interests. Now I hope to translate this experi
ence into the international frontier.
"What kind of machinery [and] safeguards

should be built into international industry is
the main question the panel will address,"
Could said. He said he will put forth ques
tions to the panel in June "designed to stir
discussion."
The panel consists of James Hoffa Jr.,
president of the International Brotherhood
of Teamsters; John Kennedy, corporate vice
president and general counsel of Johnson
Controls; Peter Pestillo, CEO of Visteon;
Joseph Miniate, president of the Pacific
Maritime Association; Jerry Calhoun, vice
president of employee relations at Boeing;
Stephen Yokich, president of the United
Auto Workers; Bruce Raynor, secretary
treasurer of the Union of Needletrades, In
dustry and Textile Employees; William
Lucy, secretary-treasurer of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees; and Brian McWilliams, presi
dent of the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union.
