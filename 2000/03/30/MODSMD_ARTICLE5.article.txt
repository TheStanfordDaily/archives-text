viewing all such programs for under

According to Zoback, the CUS review
of Kthics in Society was very positive, and
the committee is "recommending it for
renewal without anv hesitation."

The program will require majority ap
proval by the Senate in order to be re
newed for another live years.

Students currently live in six

academic theme houses: EAST

Slavianskii Dom and the American
Studies house.
According to Zoback, the Amer
ican Studies house, which is

unique among the academic
theme houses in that it does not
have any foreign language affilia
tion, will likely discontinue its
theme at the end of the year. The
other houses would be subject to
the new guidelines if approved by

the Senate.
"Some of the guidelines are far
reaching and strike to the very
philosophy of academic theme
houses and their relation to acad
emic programs within the Univer
sity. They could be very contro

versial, and what is being sought is
feedback to these guidelines,"
Zoback said.
Zoback also revealed that he will
make a major announcement at
today's meeting about a special fu
ture Faculty Senate meeting.
