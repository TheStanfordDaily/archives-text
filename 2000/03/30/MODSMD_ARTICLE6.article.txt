# Help wanted at the Farm on the Farm
## White Plaza seed-planting event held to spur interest in student group 
### BEN ALEXANDER-BLOCH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Most students have never been to
Stanford's student-run farm, but yes
terday some of them had the chance to
help with thf gardening as they passed
through White Plaza.
J he Stanford Community Farm
sponsored a "Plant-a-Seed" event dm -

ing lunch to raise awareness about the
farm.
Senior Amanda Garcia and junior
Cynthia king, the farm managers,
hosted the event, in which students
could plant vegetable and flower seeds
in a patch of soil provided by the
group.
"1 think there is something great
about knowing where your food comes
from," said senior Tim Fisher, who
planted a seed at the event.
"If you observe the whole process
you tan take some of the mystery out of
ii. Also, anyone can do it, which is defi
nitely cool," Fisher added.

Garcia and King said they hoped
that the event would inform the Stan
ford community about the farm's exis
tence and its benefits
Karth Systems has stopped offering
the course "Sustainable Food Produc
tion," which brought 20 to 30 students
per quarter to the farm, so farm orga
nizers are using event's like yesterday's
to maintain a high level of interest in
the farm's activities.
Since its inception three years ago,
the one-acre farm, which is located on
Searsville Road between Campus
Drive and Sand Hill Road, lias
been student-managed.
While most of the land is
farmed by students, some faculty
and staff members also have
plots.
"The farm is a community.
There are no real teachers or stu
dents; everyone teaches every
one," Garcia said.
I he organization offers a one
hour student-led workshop on
the farm on Thursday afternoons
between 3:15 p.m.and 6 p.m.
"The chance to learn about
growing food in a hands-on way
supplements the education we

get in classrooms," said King,
who has been involved with the
farm since its creation.
1 he first objective of the farm
is to continue to improve the
quality of its soil. Other current
projects include a spiral-shaped
herb garden, a native plant bed
and a bed of 70 fruit trees.
Stanford currently pays for
the farm's irrigation and the
ASSU provides funds for the
farm's supplies, but eventually
the farm's participants hope the
it will become-financially self-suf
ficient.
In the past, the group has sold
strawberries and tomatoes to co
operatives such as Columbae and
Synergy. ()i gani/ers also hope to
have a farmers' market on cam
pus this spring.
