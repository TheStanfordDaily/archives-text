# Three students receive Soros fellowships
## Immigrants and their children are awarded for excellence 
### EILEEN CHAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
His parents came to America
from Fgypt to escape religious
and political persecution. They
settled in Salinas, California with
little money and even less expec
tation of gaining financial securi
ty. Now, physics coterminal stu
dent Joseph F. Hennawi will have
half his graduate school tuition
paid for him plus a $20,000 year
ly grant for up to two years.
Hennawi is one the three Stan
ford students who received the
Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships
for New Americans on March 1.
Stanford medical students
Saunas Hariri and Christopher
Shen, along with Hennawi, were
among the 30 winners chosen
from a nationwide applicant pool
of 740 to receive this fellowship.
Stanford currently ranks sec
ond after Harvard in he number

of fellowships received by its stu
dents.
The Paul and Daisy Soros Fel
lowships for New Americans is a
program founded in 1997 that
pays for half the recipient's grad
uate school tuition and gives them
additional maintenance grants of
$20,000 a year as a way to award
immigrants or children of immi
grants who have demonstrated
exceptional academic qualities
and encourage them to become
national leaders in their fields.
"They have accomplished
something unusual and have
been able to sustain it," said pro
gram director Warren Ilchman.
"Equally important, we look for
candidates to have demonstrated
that they had accepted the role of
a responsible citizen — [for ex
ample,] helped immigrant rights
groups, participated in voter reg
istration [or] tutored underprivi
leged children."
The winners from Stanford
demonstrated strong academic
and professional qualifications.
Hariri, originally from Iran, is an
accomplished ballerina and in
terned for Massachusetts Gov.

Paul Cellucci and California Sen.
Diane Feinstein, focusing on
healthcare economics issues.
"I was extremely honored [to
receive the fellowship]," Hariri
said. "Also, I had an opportunity
to speak with many of the other
candidates during the interview
trip and found them to be very
impressive, so I also felt extreme
ly fortunate to be chosen."
Hennawi took a "Traveling
Physics Show" to elementary
schools to teach children to ap
preciate science. He also helped
teach in oversized classrooms in
low-income neighborhoods. He
began his college career at Hart
nell Community College and now
studies the measurement of grav
itational waves emitted by neu
tron stars at Stanford.
Shen, whose parents are from
Taiwan, worked in Japan as a de
sign engineer after his first year
of medical school. After medical
school, he plans to earn an MBA.
Shen has an M.S.E. in biome
chanical engineering, and de
signed "devices to promote mini
mally invasive alternatives to
heart bypass surgery and to cur

rent stroke therapies."
Hariri said the program dis
pels many misconceptions about
immigrants.
"While some stereotype immi
grants as people who come here
to take advantage of the welfare
benefits offered in the U.S., the
Soros fellowship highlights the
fact that immigrants are actually
in many cases achievers who want
to better themselves and the na
tion as a whole," Hariri said.
Several prominent immigrants
are on the program's National
Advisory Council, including cel
list Yo-Yo Ma and former Secre
tary of State Henry Kissinger.
According to 1997 recipient
Rajiv Doshi, a medical student,
the more valuable aspect of the
fellowship is the freedom to pur
sue interests outside of his in
tended field.
"It has really allowed me to ex
plore things outside the realm of
medicine," Doshi said. "[I can] take
classes at the business school, engi
neering courses, and read up on
patent law, since I am interested in
medical devices. It's a remarkable
privilege to be a fellow."
