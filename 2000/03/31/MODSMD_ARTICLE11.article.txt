## Father of Gonzalez now seeks U.S. visa 
### 
MIAMI (AP) — Elian Gonza
lez's father asked for a visa yester
day to come to the United States
and take the boy back to Cuba, as
dozens of anti-Castro activists
linked arms outside the 6-year
old's Miami home, practicing
resistance techniques.
Discussions between immigra
tion officials and the boy's Miami
relatives, meanwhile, ended yes
terday evening without a resolu
tion. The talks were set to resume
Monday, Immigration and Natu
ralization Service officials said.
U.S. immigration officials have
demanded that the boy's Miami
relatives promise in writing to
turn over the boy if they lose in
court. I he INS had warned that
it would revoke Elian's right to
stay in the United States unless
the relatives signed. But after the
meeting, the INS pushed back
the deadline for a second time to
at least Tuesday.
The Justice Department and
the INS hoped "to continue to
move forward on Monday," said
Robert Wallis, INS director for
the Miami district. "Like the fam
ily, we are monitoring develop
ments concerning the possible
arrival of (Elian's father) Juan
Miguel Gonzalez in the United
States," he said.
In Washington, a Justice
Department official, requesting
anonymity, said that the agree
ment contained a third clause
that would allow INS to end
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez's
temporary custody of the boy if a
major development occurs in the
case, "including his father's com
ing to the United States."
I he attempt to get a visa for
Elian's father hit a procedural
snag, however. The father's
lawyer asked the State Depart
ment for a visa, only to be told
that applications must be submit
ted to the U.S. diplomatic mission
in Havana.
"The only person that has the
legal and moral authority to
speak for Elian Gonzalez is his
father," Gregory Craig, an Amer
ican lawyer for Juan Miguel Gon
zalez, said in Washington. "Juan
Miguel Gonzalez is ready at a
moment's notice to come to the
United States."
Craig said he asked the Immi
gration and Naturalization Ser
vice to allow the boy's father and
other Cuban relatives to stay as
long as it takes to complete the
appeals process. A federal appeals
court in Atlanta has scheduled the
case for May 11.
On the street in front of the
house in Miami's Little Havana
neighborhood where Elian has
been staying with his great-uncle,
dozens of demonstrators linked
arms and formed two rows.
"We will not let Elian's civil
rights be violated," said Ramon
Saul Sanchez, head of the Democ
racy Movement, an anti-Castro
group.
Sanchez instructed the demon
strators on nonviolent protest,
telling them that if the police
arrive, they should remain seated
and hold out their fists if they
were to be handcuffed.
Over the past few days,
demonstrators have promised to
lay down their lives to prevent
Elian from being taken away.
In another development, Vice
President AI Gore broke with the
Clinton administration and
backed legislation in Congress
that would grant permanent resi
dent status to Elian and to his
father.
