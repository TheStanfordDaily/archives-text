â€” Yesterday, Russian soldiers
searched a mountainous district
of Chechnya for 27 comrades
who were missing after an
ambush.
A 49-man unit was attacked
Wednesday near the southern
village of Zhani-Vedeno, said a
top Russian commander, Col.
Cen. Alexander Baranov. Four
men were killed and 18 wound
ed in the ambush, he said.
"The rebels were waiting for
them," said Sergei Yastrzhemb
sky, the Kremlin's spokesman for
Chechnya. Of the 107 iroops in a
second convoy that tried to help
the first unit, 20 were hospital
ized, and the others escaped
unharmed, the Interfax news
agency reported.
Despite the latest losses, Inte
rior Minister Vladimir Rushailo
insisted yesterday that Russia was
not losing control of the situation
in Chechnya.
"The situation in the republic
is not simple and requires con
stant attention and corrections in
the federal forces' efforts," he
told Interfax. "But it is being
fully controlled, including in the
southern districts, despite con
tinuing sorties of the surviving
rebel formations."
Other Russian commanders

have been less pessimistic, saying
the rebels could maintain a guer
rilla war for some time to come.
I he seven-month-old war has
subjected Russia to foreign criti

cism for alleged human rights
violations.
Russia has rejected the allega
tions, but in an apparent bow to
international pressure, President

Vladimir Putin yesterday agreed
in principle to allow the Interna
tional Committee of the Red
Cross access to detention facilities
in Chechnya.
