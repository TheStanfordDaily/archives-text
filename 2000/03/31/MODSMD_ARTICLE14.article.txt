# Clinton discusses his trip to South Asia
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” Presi
dent Clinton accused Republican
congressional leaders yesterday
of sabotaging his hopes of secur
ing a nuclear weapons pact with
India and Pakistan.
During a trip to South Asia last
week, Clinton failed to make any
arms control deals. India and
Pakistan both refused to reverse
their nuclear weapons programs,
and Pakistan's military leaders
refused even to promise a quick
return to democracy.
Clinton told a Democratic
audience in Manhattan that upon
his return last week, he was
angered by Republican criticism
that he" did not "get anything" for
his trip.
Such criticism ignores a critical
fact, he said: "1 lost all leverage I
had when the Republican Senate
defeated the ratification of the
Comprehensive lest Ban
Treaty," Clinton said.
" That is real gall, man," Clin
ton said to applause. "That
requires a lot of moxie, you
know?" Laughing, he said: "One
of their great strengths, by the
way, is they have no guilt and no
shame. I mean, they'll say any
thing."
Sen. Sam Brownback. R-kan.,
chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee on Near
Eastern and South Asian affairs,
has called Clinton's trip "a bust."
House Republican Whip Tom
DeLay has also said Clinton has
little to show for his week of
diplomacy in South Asia.
Nuclear testing in 1998 , first
by India and then by Pakistan,
shook the Indian subcontinent
and the world. Since then, both
countries have tested both medi
um and short range missiles,
