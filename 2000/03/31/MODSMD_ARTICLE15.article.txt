FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) â€”
FBI agents picked through paper
strewn across the pavement yes
terday, looking for any sensitive
files that may have been blown
out of the bureau's sixth-floor
office by the tornadoes that struck
Fort Worth this week.
"At this point we don't know if
we lost sensitive files. It's hard to
say if this will jeopardize cases,"
FBI spokeswoman Lori Bailey
said.
The storms Tuesday killed
four people and caused an esti
mated $450 million in damage.
The building that housed the
FBl's office near downtown will
have to be razed, city officials said.
Wearing disposable gloves,
some 20 agents searched through
even the smallest scraps of paper
scattered outdoors.
"We did lose some informa
tion, some documentation from
cases, possibly some evidence,"
Bailey said. "Work papers may
have been on desk tops when the
storm hit."

The sensitive files are believed
to be safe because cabinets and
other security mechanisms were
intact, l)iit the FBI will inventory
its documents to determine for
certain whether any confidential
papers are missing, Bailey said.
Two of the three FBI squads in
the Fort Worth office will be
moved to a federal law-enforce
ment office near the airport.
Those two squads handle general
investigations. The third squad,
which handles violent crimes, will
be relocated to the Fort Worth
police headquarters.
No FBI employees were seri
ously hurt.
Two tornadoes struck the city
of 480,000 on Tuesday. One
ripped through downtown just
after the evening rush hour.
I he second tornado destroyed
more than 100 homes in neigh
boring Arlington and Grand
Prairie and damaged more than
1,000 others.
Twelve blocks remained closed
yesterday for a second day .
