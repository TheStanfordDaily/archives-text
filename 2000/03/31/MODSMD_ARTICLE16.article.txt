BERN, Switzerland (AP) — The Swiss
bank regulator yesterday approved the
publication of names on 26,000 Holocaust
era accounts in a final push to find the heirs
of victims.
The Swiss Federal Banking Commission
said that it was following the recommenda
tion of the international panel headed by

former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Paul Volcker.
"By publishing the accounts, justice w ill
be done to victims of the Holocaust who
during the war held their assets in Swiss
banks," said Kurt Hauri, president of the
commission.
Hauri said the decision clears the way for

rapid implementation of the $1.25 billion
settlement reached two years ago between
banks and Jewish organizations and Holo
caust claimants in New York under U.S.
District Judge Edward Korman.
The New York-based World Jewish
Congress reacted cautiously, saying the
judge must still decide if the action complies

with Volcker's panel.
The panel recommendations came last
December after more than two years of
combing through all the records it could
find on 4.1 million accounts in 254 Swiss
banks in operation during World War II
while the Nazis controlled neighboring Ger
many.
