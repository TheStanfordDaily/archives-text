## Yale should learn from Stanford policy 
### CAROLINE PERRY EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER 
Karlier this year at Stanford, the familiar
SSK Ix'cture Notes were replaced with an
online version created in a partnership with
Versity.com. Students can now, for a $15
fee, access class notes from any computer on
campus and print them out at their leisure.
Lecture notes are, for many students, a
crucial studying tool. Even for students
who go to every lecture and take notes

diligently, access to a different perspective
on the lecture, or even just tidbits of infor
mation that were previously missed, can
greatly increase a student's performance
in the class.
Despite this, Yale University recently
asked Versity.com to remove all the lec
ture notes pertaining to Yale classes from
the Web site, citing concerns about aca
demic integrity. Yale, in fact, does not
allow any sort of note-taking services, even
from student groups on campus. As one

Yale professor, Dr. John Merrima, put it,
"It's a violation of my intellectual proper
ty rights. Students are paying tuition at
Yale. You can't claim it's a public forum."
This argument, on closer inspection,
seems ridiculous. It would be simple
enough to monitor who was accessing Ver
sity's online notes. If professors were really
worried that Stanford students, for exam
ple, wanted to get a Yale education instead,
a Yale student ID number (or the equiva
lent) could Ix.* required to access the notes.

Perhaps, to even take it one step further,
notes could be made available only to stu
dents enrolled in that particular class.
Then it is hardly a public forum; it is sim
ply another resource available to students
already in the class.
Yale's refusal to allow note-taking ser
vices of any kind seems almost to signify a
lack of trust in the general student body. A
responsible student would still attend
class, even with notes available from
another source. 1 doubt that Versity's

online notes were really causing a rash of
empty lecture halls across \ ale s campus.
Students come to college to learn, and
the purpose of a university is to make
learning resources available to students,
whether these resources come in the form
of professors, textbooks or yes, even note
taking services.
Yale should take a page from Stan
ford's notes and realize that Versity is sim
ply offering students another way to exce
in what they do.
