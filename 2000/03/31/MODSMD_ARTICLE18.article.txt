# THE 						FLIP SIDE
## The 						power of a story 
### 
It s my senior year spring quarter.
And despite all the* doubts, pitfalls, 1'
/NC classes, strew your roommate
disasters and Jack-In-'The-Box spicy
crispy chicken sandwiches, I am set to
graduate in June. That's right, I am one
of those extra-special seniors who hap
pened to finish a quarter early. As a
result, this spring quarter I get to take all
those other classes that I have always
wanted to take at Stanford.
So, after countless hours of careful aca
demic planning and frequent meetings
with my advisor, I have decided on two
classes: Sailing and Fiction Writing (It's

going to he a rough six
unit quarter). Sailing is
an obvious choice, see
ing as how it is spring
quarter, we live in C lal
ifornia, and it fulfills
the WIM (Water In
the Major) require
ment. But Fiction
Writing? Why a
mechanical engineer

would ever voluntarily choose to take a
seemingly tragic jump from machine
shop to metaphor is an event that
requires a more extensive explanation.
The basic explanation is simple: I love
stories. Whether ii be a book, a short
story, theater or a poorly sung country
ballad about a guy, his truck and the girl
he lost, I am a sucker for a good story. We
all are. The infectious nature of stories
has resulted in the modern American
phenomenons known as Broadway, Hol
lywood and Danielle Steele. Think about
those people you know who are always
the center of attention. I guarantee that
they are simply the best storytellers. Yes,
that's right. Stories can make you more
popular. Bui why? How does this simple
aspect of life hold so much power? Well,
you could say that stories are simply "fun"
and "entertaining," an answer that would
suffice in most parts of America. But since
we're at Stanford, I'd like to take a differ
ent approach.
Stories teach. Fliink back to when you
were six. I he Berenstein Bears: au epic
literary series which repeatedly explored
issues of morality, self-esteem and family.
You c ried when Brother Bear got in trou
ble ai school. You went to bed smiling
when Sister Bear finally stopped biting
her nails. You bit your own fingernails
when Brother and Sister Bear broke the
lamp and learned the value of telling (lie
truth. As much as you've tried to hide it,
deep down inside you have a special place
in your heart for the Berenstein Bears.
Or if not for them, for Rainona Quimby,
Encyclopedia Brown or The Babysitters'
(Hub. And, as you went to middle school
and your vocabulary grew, you moved
onto more mature literary titles such as
The Hardy Boys and the most notable lit
erary achievement of the 1980s, Sweet
Valley High. Through these early reads,
we learned the rules of the world, the dif
ference between good and bad, the prop
er forms of social etiquette and most
importantly, how to deal with issues of
love and attraction.
Stories transport. Books, theater,
movies; they're all alive. Ever read
Stephen King or seen the movie "Seven"?
I hey make your heart beat faster. I hey
make you tense up. Others make you go
"awww" at those particularly cute
moments usually involving little children.
And each story is different. Each one
takes you on a different trip. Every per
son enjoys going to a different place.

Everyone is scared of the places that
Woody Allen's stories seem to go. But
each story has the possibility of going to a
place where the impossible becomes pos
sible. It's why we all want our lives to turn
out like the movies. Stories help you
escape fiom the here and now by taking
you to a time long ago or a time yet to
come or a time just passed in a place
where the rules are changed and the
drama becomes part of you.
Stories challenge. There's a senior pro
ject that has gone up this week in the
Drama Department called "This Little
Filing". It is a student-written, student
produced one woman show about the
experience of eating disorders. The show
takes the stories of a number of women
recovering from eating disorders and
put sit into a collage of experiences. It's a
story that too many women have had to
tell and a story that is incredibly silent on
the Stanford campus. Stories can help
break taboo and the rigid tracks of think
ing which we fall into and forget to ever
question and this is just one example of
how.
Stories connect. My love for stories
grows especially hot for fantasy novels.
This past summer, I'd sit in these coffee
shops in Albuquerque for hours (since
there really isn't much else to do in Albu
querque) reading fantasy novels by
Robert Jordan. They're stories about
country farmboys saving the world, about
magic, and royalty, and love, and betray
al, and unbeknownst to me were that
these books are really well-known. So, I
would sit in my little coffee shops in Albu
querque, sipping my iced tea, with my
self-esteem slightly higher because five
girls came up to me in one afternoon to
comment on how much they loved my
book. I felt like a king (unfortunately, try
ing the same thing at the Stanford Coffee
House yielded 110 results, proving once
and for all that the Albuquerque social
scene leaves much to be desired.) Stories
are like GER 4, they are an unspoken
bond we all share.
Iu i n 011 the T V between 1 and 4
every afternoon. Soap Operas are stories.
It's bad television, but it's still a story. Go
to the movies. "American Beauty" has
come to be either the most inspiring or
(lie most distressing story of the past year
for many people. Stories are everywhere,
and I wanted to become part of them. So,
I'm taking Fiction Writing, the class we all
talk about taking but never get around to.
I'm going to try to take people to a place
and time that I create. I just have to fig
ure out exactly where it is 1 want to go.
So as time goes by, when you need to be
anywhere but here and anytime but now,
remember the power of stories. Pick up a
"fun" book. Read Harry Potter. You
won't regret a second of it. Or go see
Rani's Head's production of "Pippin"
next week, and experience the magic and
music of one of then ippiest stories ever
to be put 011 stage. Or just for kicks, pull
out one of those favorites from long ago,
the one that you're embarrassed to let
other people know you like, and plop
down somewhere and read it from start
to finish. If nothing else, it'll be "fun" and
"entertaining", and maybe even a little bit
more.
