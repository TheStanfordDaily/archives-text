## Postal Service external audit underway alongside internal investigation 
### ALICE BROWN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Postal workers who were caught throwing
away mail will face disciplinary action, a U.S.
Postal Service spokesperson has announced.

Horace Hinshaw, the post office spokesper
son, confirmed that several of the pieces of dis
carded mail were in fact deliverable, and that the
people to whom the mail was addressed are cur
rent students.
After freshman Michael Osofsky watched
workers throwing large quantities of first class
mail into a dumpster, an external investigation of
the post office was launched.
Jeffrey Lelevich, the manager of Post Office
Operations for the San Francisco region, turned
the case over to the U.S. Postal Inspection Ser
vice, which will handle the investigation.

One of the areas on which the investigation
will focus is labor relations, and the investigators
will report to Lelevich, not Palo Alto Postmaster
General Masa Sato.
The external investigation will be conducted
in addition the internal one, which began in Feb
ruary after the ASSU forum about poor service.
Sixteen students w ill have an opportunity to
look into post office affairs on their own this
spring as members of a class doing an operations
management research project on the post office.
They will have free range to talk to employees
and observe daily operations.
