Rethinking land use around the Dish
1 was amused by the caption in Lues
day's Daily describing Stanford Avenue as
a "popular parking spot for students hik
ing in the Foothills." if many of the hikers
are really students, the University should
launch a campaign to teach them to walk.
The hills are close enough from any cam
pus location.
According to my observations, most
hikers are not students, but obese middle
aged men and women from various mid
peninsula cities. They arrive usually in
their big vans and trucks with their fami
lies and frequently with as many as six
dogs (not 011 leash, of course, as Stanford
requires at the gate). These so-called hik
ers feel entitled to trample over private
property wherever they please, create ille
gal trails and destroy the habitat of wild
animals that were once common to the
area.
When 1 first arrived at Stanford 42
years ago and as recently as 10 years ago,
deer and other animals grazed the hills
among the cows from Piers Dairy, and
they could be seen from Stanford Avenue.
They are now all gone. It is a puzzle that
a world-class University which tries to
teach everybody else to conserve and pro
tect the environment would allow mis
management and destruction of its lands
to take place.
To restore the area, Stanford must
consider one of the following: close the
hills to the general public or limit the
number of visitors to faculty, staff, stu
dents and alumni. If necessary a fee of
$200 per year may be required for any
others desiring access. The fees would
pay for law enforcement, construction
and maintenance of proper trails, toilets
and other amenities normally found in
parks. Because the Stanford Avenue
parking problem presents serious dan
gers to campus residents and their chil
dren as well as others, a temporary mora
torium with enforcement on hikers is also

in order. It would solve the Stanford
Avenue parking problem immediately
until the University authorities decide
what should be done.

Stanford has worked to combat racism
I share whole-heartedly the Daily's
concern for racial and ethnic divisions on
campus.
Contrary to what the editorial said,
however, the student body and the
administration have been vigilant in try
ing to build bridges between students
from different backgrounds. The editori
al claims that as Stanford has become
more affluent, "it also seems to be moving
father and farther away from facing true
conflicts... it has become complacent
when it comes to controversies like these."
I bis rhetoric exaggerates the attitudes
and activities of members of the Stanford
community. Student groups and the fac
ulty and staff at Stanford devote much
time and resources to questions of race
and ethnicity. Martin Luther King
week,Walter Mosley, Jewish culture
week, a day-long multicultural festival
and march last month, numerous classes
devoted to studying race and ethnicity, a
black-Jewish Seder, a Native American
Pow Wow, a strong and active black stu
dent union, and, most importantly, the
numerous friendships and cooperation
between students and faculty of all back
grounds point to a campus that does not
"ignore issues of race and ethnicity."
The tremendous concern shown over
the recent e-mails, in fact, points to a cul
ture where issues of racism are taken
seriously and addressed vigilantly. Per
haps many students do not know about
or choose to ignore the many forums
and events addressing race and ethnici
ty, but that is not for lack of effort and
concern on the part of the leaders of the

Stanford community. The publicity
given to three e-mails with vulgar con
tent draws attention away from the
numerous ways in which the Stanford
community has promoted and embraced
a rich and diverse academic and social
environment.

Whether from experience or from
empathy, we all have an understanding of
how heavily graduation anxiety weighs
upon our students. In these last weeks of
the academic year, they have to work
harder than ever to close gaps in their
academic record and ensure a smooth
exit from college.
How do we help them cope with this
most intense period of student life? Cer
tainly not by allowing outsiders to exploit
their distress:"Exactly 81 days until you're
officially UNEMPLOYED" (The Daily,
March 29, p. 5). Is there more offensive a
message to a college student? In just one
sentence the empty genius of the adver
tiser annihilates four years of intense
learning to a prelude to unemployment.
Imagine you have terminal cancer and
next morning you get a nice card from an
insurance company :"Exacdy 81 days until
you'll be dead."
We know life outside this University is
not a paradise, but will we accept our stu
dents to be bombarded with these dread
ful psychological messages from the cor
porate vampires? American higher edu
cation has been a pioneer in bringing
society into the university. But do we also
have to import society's evils? And psy
chological exploitation is the worst of its
kind. I believe we do have a responsibility
to our students.
We have to protect their right to learn
ing by protecting the value of that learn
ing from the attacks of commercialism.
We must resist the Ibices of moral la/iness
and the primitive psychology ol "cost
am!-benefit' approaches (so ellectivcl)
tested years ago in Na/i concentration
camps, as Benigni's movie reminded us
last year). Whether leading to a job 01
not, learning will retain its social value
and will help ns realize our luunanih
long after the dispelling ol the corporate
mirage and its sinister hand-maid adver
tisement. Let ns be more vigilant to these
attacks against the most vulnerable group
of onr student hotly.

Post office woes should be remedied
Monday's front page article ("Postal
workers caught trashing mail") on the
disposal ol deliverable mail at the Stan
lord post ollice mentioned that "there
have been main personnel changes since
()solsk\ s disc <>verv."
Acting Director of Operations for the
San Francisco District Robert Reed and
Palo \lto Postmaster Masa Sato should
not only be replaced but lirecl and crimi
nally investigated as well. On Feb. 15,
they lied to the Stanford community and
representatives ofC.ongresswoinan Anna
l.shoo and Senator Diane Feinstein
regarding an external investigation. It
seems likelv that this discovery highlights
one of the reasons why they wanted to
keep the investigation internal and sweep
this under the rug. If they had knowl
edge ol this problem and did nothing

about it, tliev should be held profession
ally and criminally liable. If they didn't
have knowledge of it they are just incom
petent.
However, replacing these individuals
with another post office management team
is unlikely to resolve the problem. Serious
service issues have existed at the Stanford
post office for more than 15 years.
A new management team from the
same incompetent organization isn't
going to lix the problem. A new provider
will. The Stanford administration should
look into contracting with a private com
pany such as Mailboxes Etc. to handle
mail services for the Stanford community,
it seems clear that the U.S. Postal Service
has not been, is not and will not be capa
ble of meeting the basic postal service
needs of the Stanford community.

from different backgrounds. The editori

when it comes to controversies like these."
I bis rhetoric exaggerates the attitudes
and activities of members of the Stanford
community. Student groups and the fac
ulty and staff at Stanford devote much
time and resources to questions of race
and ethnicity. Martin Luther King

week, a day-long multicultural festival
and march last month, numerous classes
devoted to studying race and ethnicity, a
black-Jewish Seder, a Native American
Pow Wow, a strong and active black stu
dent union, and, most importantly, the
numerous friendships and cooperation
between students and faculty of all back
grounds point to a campus that does not
"ignore issues of race and ethnicity."
The tremendous concern shown over
the recent e-mails, in fact, points to a cul
ture where issues of racism are taken
seriously and addressed vigilantly. Per
haps many students do not know about
or choose to ignore the many forums
and events addressing race and ethnici
ty, but that is not for lack of effort and
concern on the part of the leaders of the

Stanford community. The publicity
given to three e-mails with vulgar con
tent draws attention away from the
numerous ways in which the Stanford
community has promoted and embraced
a rich and diverse academic and social
environment.

Whether from experience or from
empathy, we all have an understanding of
how heavily graduation anxiety weighs
upon our students. In these last weeks of
the academic year, they have to work
harder than ever to close gaps in their
academic record and ensure a smooth
exit from college.
How do we help them cope with this
most intense period of student life? Cer
tainly not by allowing outsiders to exploit
their distress:"Exactly 81 days until you're
officially UNEMPLOYED" (The Daily,
March 29, p. 5). Is there more offensive a
message to a college student? In just one
sentence the empty genius of the adver
tiser annihilates four years of intense
learning to a prelude to unemployment.
Imagine you have terminal cancer and
next morning you get a nice card from an
insurance company :"Exacdy 81 days until
you'll be dead."
We know life outside this University is
not a paradise, but will we accept our stu
dents to be bombarded with these dread
ful psychological messages from the cor
porate vampires? American higher edu
cation has been a pioneer in bringing
society into the university. But do we also
have to import society's evils? And psy
chological exploitation is the worst of its
kind. I believe we do have a responsibility
to our students.
We have to protect their right to learn
ing by protecting the value of that learn
ing from the attacks of commercialism.
We must resist the Ibices of moral la/iness
and the primitive psychology ol "cost
am!-benefit' approaches (so ellectivcl)
tested years ago in Na/i concentration
camps, as Benigni's movie reminded us
last year). Whether leading to a job 01
not, learning will retain its social value
and will help ns realize our luunanih
long after the dispelling ol the corporate
mirage and its sinister hand-maid adver
tisement. Let ns be more vigilant to these
attacks against the most vulnerable group
of onr student hotly.

Post office woes should be remedied
Monday's front page article ("Postal
workers caught trashing mail") on the
disposal ol deliverable mail at the Stan
lord post ollice mentioned that "there
have been main personnel changes since
()solsk\ s disc <>verv."
Acting Director of Operations for the
San Francisco District Robert Reed and
Palo \lto Postmaster Masa Sato should
not only be replaced but lirecl and crimi
nally investigated as well. On Feb. 15,
they lied to the Stanford community and
representatives ofC.ongresswoinan Anna
l.shoo and Senator Diane Feinstein
regarding an external investigation. It
seems likelv that this discovery highlights
one of the reasons why they wanted to
keep the investigation internal and sweep
this under the rug. If they had knowl
edge ol this problem and did nothing

about it, tliev should be held profession
ally and criminally liable. If they didn't
have knowledge of it they are just incom
petent.
However, replacing these individuals
with another post office management team
is unlikely to resolve the problem. Serious
service issues have existed at the Stanford
post office for more than 15 years.
A new management team from the
same incompetent organization isn't
going to lix the problem. A new provider
will. The Stanford administration should
look into contracting with a private com
pany such as Mailboxes Etc. to handle
mail services for the Stanford community,
it seems clear that the U.S. Postal Service
has not been, is not and will not be capa
ble of meeting the basic postal service
needs of the Stanford community.

Rethinking land use around the Dish
1 was amused by the caption in Lues
day's Daily describing Stanford Avenue as
a "popular parking spot for students hik
ing in the Foothills." if many of the hikers
are really students, the University should
launch a campaign to teach them to walk.
The hills are close enough from any cam
pus location.
According to my observations, most
hikers are not students, but obese middle
aged men and women from various mid
peninsula cities. They arrive usually in
their big vans and trucks with their fami
lies and frequently with as many as six
dogs (not 011 leash, of course, as Stanford
requires at the gate). These so-called hik
ers feel entitled to trample over private
property wherever they please, create ille
gal trails and destroy the habitat of wild
animals that were once common to the
area.
When 1 first arrived at Stanford 42
years ago and as recently as 10 years ago,
deer and other animals grazed the hills
among the cows from Piers Dairy, and
they could be seen from Stanford Avenue.
They are now all gone. It is a puzzle that
a world-class University which tries to
teach everybody else to conserve and pro
tect the environment would allow mis
management and destruction of its lands
to take place.
To restore the area, Stanford must
consider one of the following: close the
hills to the general public or limit the
number of visitors to faculty, staff, stu
dents and alumni. If necessary a fee of
$200 per year may be required for any
others desiring access. The fees would
pay for law enforcement, construction
and maintenance of proper trails, toilets
and other amenities normally found in
parks. Because the Stanford Avenue
parking problem presents serious dan
gers to campus residents and their chil
dren as well as others, a temporary mora
torium with enforcement on hikers is also

in order. It would solve the Stanford
Avenue parking problem immediately
until the University authorities decide
what should be done.
