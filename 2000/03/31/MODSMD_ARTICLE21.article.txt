## Gym tested in West Women look for 'Super Six' berth at meet in Corvallis 
### KATIE FITZPATRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
for the No. 15 Stanford women's gym
nastics team, it's do or die as it heads to its
most important meet of the season this week
end — the NCAA West Regionals at ()regon
State.
I he Cardinal must place in the top two of
a difficult field of opponents to qualify for the
National Championships and continue its
quest for a berth in the "Super Six" team fi
nals of Nationals.
Stanford made its job of qualifying for
Nationals more difficult over spring break
when, after a lackluster Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships showing, the Cardi
nal dropped out of the top 12 teams in the
country.
Stanford now stays in the West region —
one of the most difficult regions in the coun
try — to compete against the likes of No. 2
UCLA, No. 10 Oklahoma, No. 19 Washing
ton and Oregon State as it vies for an invita
tion to be one of the 12 teams at Nationals.
One advantage of staying in the West re
gion is that every team that Stanford faces,
with the exception of Oklahoma, will be a
team that Stanford has already faced this
year. Additionally, Stanford will not be
forced to adjust to a time change or an unfa
miliar atmosphere.

"It will be a very competitive meet, bring
ing out the best in us. YVe have beat three of
the teams that will be competing at Region
al in dual competition this year, only losing
to UCI A," said head coach Mark Cook.
Teammates and coaches insist they are
ready for a good showing at Regionals and a
spot at Nationals. And history is also on the
Cardinal's side: Stanford teams that have
done poorly at Pac-lOs tend to do well at Re
gionals.
"We had a great meet up in Oregon early
this year, and we'll focus on that positive ex
perience," said assistant coach Rene Lyst
Cook.
"We need consistency and performance
just to stay in our game," said Lyst Cook.
"We don't have to be perfect. We have to
be aggressive and be confident in our ability,
desire and commitment," said senior co-cap
tain Sarah Harding.
"We're good enough to be at Nationals. I
really think we'll get there," said sophomore
Katy Herbert.
Herbert is a defending balance beam re
gional champion and w ill be a cornerstone of
the lineup on every event.
The team will be led by senior All-Ameri
can Larissa Fontaine, who is ranked third
nationally in the all-around and on vault.
She is also ranked 18th on bars and 10th on
floor.
Fontaine injured her foot slightly in train
ing last week. The seasoned competitor is ex
pected to compete despite the injury.

Sophomore Becky Meldrum has revitalized the Stanford
gymnastics team. Her hits on beam are one of the key
stones of the Cardinal's success.
