### KATIE FITZPATRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last season, the gymnastics
coaches gave the team a day off
practice before a meet to rest.
Then-freshman Becky Meldrum
decided to relax by heading out
and running the Dish.
Coaches and teammates
shouldn't have been surprised:
that's sophomore Becky Meldrum
in a nutshell — a hard-working,
free-spirited overachiever who
never seems to sit still.
"She's a little ball of sunshine,"
says former teammate Amy Mu
rakami.
"Becky's determination com
bined with her spunkiness just
adds that special spark to the
team," says beam coach Rene Lyst
Cook.
The sophomore from Mertz
town, Pa., is putting the bulk of her
energy toward the Stanford
women's gymnastics team. Mel
drum has always given the team an
extra boost when the Cardinal
needs her the most, stepping in on
every event and leading the beam
team.
In fact, she has been the most
consistent performer on the beam
this year — the only member of
the Cardinal squad to have hit

every beam routine she's compet

Meldrum hails from the presti

where she trained for more than
14 years. At Parkettes, she quali

Team and trained with current
teammate, sophomore Ail-Ameri
can Kristen Jensen.
"Jensen and I shared so many
experiences before, its great to
share experiences here," says Mel
drum.
Meldrum has a special bond
with all her teammates, who look
to her to add fun and amusement
to the workout with her bright yel
low smiley-face workout apparel
and ever-present smile. She is no
torious for her role as the hardest
worker on the team.
"My teammates are my best
friends," says Meldrum.
Her teammates return the sen
timent.
"Becky is everything 1 could
want in a teammate: always moti
vated, always energetic. She keeps
the team energy up every day,"
says senior co-captain Larissa
Fontaine.
"I don't think she gets enough
