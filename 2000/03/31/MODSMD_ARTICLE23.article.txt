# Meldrum shines
## 
### KATIE FITZPATRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last season, the gymnastics
coaches gave the team a day off
practice before a meet to rest.
Then-freshman Becky Meldrum
decided to relax by heading out
and running the Dish.
Coaches and teammates
shouldn't have been surprised:
that's sophomore Becky Meldrum
in a nutshell — a hard-working,
free-spirited overachiever who
never seems to sit still.
"She's a little ball of sunshine,"
says former teammate Amy Mu
rakami.
"Becky's determination com
bined with her spunkiness just
adds that special spark to the
team," says beam coach Rene Lyst
Cook.
The sophomore from Mertz
town, Pa., is putting the bulk of her
energy toward the Stanford
women's gymnastics team. Mel
drum has always given the team an
extra boost when the Cardinal
needs her the most, stepping in on
every event and leading the beam
team.
In fact, she has been the most
consistent performer on the beam
this year — the only member of
the Cardinal squad to have hit

every beam routine she's compet
ed — all while serving in the diffi
cult leadoff position.
Meldrum hails from the presti
gious gymnastics club, Parkettes,
where she trained for more than
14 years. At Parkettes, she quali
fied to the U.S. Senior National
Team and trained with current
teammate, sophomore Ail-Ameri
can Kristen Jensen.
"Jensen and I shared so many
experiences before, its great to
share experiences here," says Mel
drum.
Meldrum has a special bond
with all her teammates, who look
to her to add fun and amusement
to the workout with her bright yel
low smiley-face workout apparel
and ever-present smile. She is no
torious for her role as the hardest
worker on the team.
"My teammates are my best
friends," says Meldrum.
Her teammates return the sen
timent.
"Becky is everything 1 could
want in a teammate: always moti
vated, always energetic. She keeps
the team energy up every day,"
says senior co-captain Larissa
Fontaine.
"I don't think she gets enough
credit for the pure untainted amount of
energy she puts into every little thing
she does," says sophomore teammate
Katy Herbert.
Meldrum carries her energy into and
out of the gym. Despite her busy sched
ule and her own athletic career, she is an
avid basketball fan who tries to attend
every home game. Last year, she was
voted Cedro's dorm mascot for her en
thusiasm and excitement.
"She was always running everywhere
— having magic marker wars, going into

fountains, into the ocean .... She was a
fearless, giggling superstar dressed in
bright red flannel plaid pajama pants," re
calls Cedro Resident Assistant (lathi Ho.
Meldrum's explanation for her en
thusiasm is simple.
"I feel so lucky to be here, 1 want to
get the most out of it,"says Meldrum.
Inspired by her active grandparents,
the Human Biology major is interested
in working with the elderly to help
them live longer, happier and healthier
lives. She also has plans to run a
marathon with her father, an avid run
ner, sometime after graduation.
But for now, Meldrum's focus is to
help the team to success this year and in
the future. Rarely complaining, she does
everything in her power to help her

team succeed.
"Becky will do whatever is asked to
help this team to a national champi
onship," says head coach Mark Cook.
"She's really the heart of our team.
Every member of the team is, of course,
important, but nothing would be the
same without her. She has some kind of
special 'spirit spell' over all of us — if
site's up, we're up, and unfortunately if
she's feeling a little down, it's like we all
feel her pain," Herbert says.
"Becky is going to be a core part of
this team in the future. Her own person
al drive and work ethic sets an example
lot everyone. She works as hard as she
can every day, every turn she takes,"
Fontaine says.
"She's our heart," says Lyst Cook.
