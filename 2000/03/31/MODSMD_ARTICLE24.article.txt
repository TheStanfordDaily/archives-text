# Tennis takes four over break
## 
### SAMEER AHMED STAFF WRITER 
I here must be a glitch in the comput
er that ranks the top teams in men's colle
giate tennis. Somehow, the undefeated
Stanford men's tennis team (13-0, 3-0 Pa
cific 10 Conference) dropped from first to
third in the nation after defeating four
quality opponents over the past two
weeks.
From March 22-28, the Cardinal had
little trouble beating Brigham Young,
Clemson, California and Harvard.
Throughout the four dual matches, the
Stanford players combined to win a total
of 30 singles and doubles matches while
losing only six.
Even more remarkable, Stanford won
the matches using nine different players.
While most collegiate tennis teams only
use their top six players to compete in
most matches, the Cardinal demonstrated
its extraordinary depth over spring break.
Because the team had been suffering
from many injuries, most notably sopho
more K.J. Hippensteel's severe case of
mononucleosis, head coach Dick Gould
had to use the rest of his team to fill the
void, especially freshmen Carter Morris
and Ryan Haviland.
" 1 felt really bad when some of the guys
got injured," Morris said. "At the same
time, it gave me an opportunity to play. I
have just tried my best with the chances
that I have been given."
The strength of Stanford's depth was
exemplified in its impressive 7-0 win over
Harvard last Tuesday. I he Cardinal used
all nine players, including Hippensteel,
who competed in his first match since Jan.
14.
Stanford began the match by winning

two of three doubles matches.
Senior Geoff Abrams and junior Alex
Kim, the No. 1 doubles team in the na
tion, teamed up to defeat No. 27 Joe
Green and Dave Lingman, 8-4. Abrams
and Kim are now 11-1 in dual match play
and have defeated four of the top 30 dou
bles teams in the last two weeks.
At the No. 2 spot, Hippensteel marked
his return by joining freshman David
Martin to squeeze by John Doran and Gil
lie Swart, 9-8. At the time of his illness,
Hippensteel was ranked No. 1 in the na
tion in singles and No. 5 in doubles with
Martin. However, he was dropped from
the rankings on March 15 because of in
activity.
Hippensteel is making a gradual re
turn into the starting lineup. This week,
he has been allowed to play doubles and
may begin competing in singles next
week.
Freshmen Scott Lipsky and Haviland,
however, could not finish the doubles
sweep for the Cardinal. They lost to
William Lee and Andrew Styperek, 8-5.
In singles play, Stanford used three
more players to finish off the Crimson.
Morris and juniors Scotty Scott and Ali
Ansari joined Kim, Abrams and Martin in
singles. All six men disposed of their op
ponents in straight sets.
At No. 1 singles, Kim, ranked third in
the nation, extended his winning streak
to eight matches with a 6-2, 6-2 win over
Green. Kim improved his dual match
record to 12-1 and overall record to 28-3.
Abrams, ranked ninth in the nation, also
extended his eight-match winning streak
by defeating Lingham, 6-1, 6-4.
Morris continued his impressive play in
singles with a 6-3,6-3 victory over
junior Anthony Barker at the No.
6 spot. Posting a 5-0 record, Mor
ris has yet to be defeated in dual
matches this year.
Because of Stanford's out
standing performance over the
past two weeks, it seems reason
able that the Cardinal would
have continued its reign as the
No. 1 team in the country.
However, the computer rank
ings, based on a system too
complicated for most Stanford
math majors to understand,
ranks the team at No. 3. The
Cardinal is somehow ranked be
hind No. 1 UCLA, a team the
Cardinal lias already beaten this
season.
However, Could is not con
cerned with his team's ranking.
"You should really take the
rankings with a grain of salt,"
Could said. "The most impor

tant thing is that we're healthy
and playing great tennis."
Now at full strength, the Car
dinal is well prepared to regain
the No. 1 ranking and to host an
NCAA tournament regional

match on May 13. The team con
tinues its demanding nine-match
homestand this weekend. Stan
ford hosts Pac-10 rivals Arizona

State tomorrow at 12 p.m.
