# Volleyball scrambles for weekend wins against Long Beach, USC
## 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball team (8-
9, 7-7 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
returns to Maples Pavilion this weekend
for its last two home matches of ihe season.
With MPSF playoffs lingering a month
away, the Cardinal squad will be scram
bling to secure one of the four remaining
tournament bids, and wins this weekend
would put it in solid positioning.
Success this weekend will mean upset
ting two of the country's best teams as No.
13 Stanford will battle No. 3 USC (16-4,
11-3) tonight and No. 1 Long Beach State
(19-2, 12-1) tomorrow night. Though the
Cardinal fell to both squads in late January

without clinching a game, it will look to
ward its home-court advantage and
growth as a team this season to give it the
edge this weekend.
"We're at a point in the season where
we're going to stick with what we are
doing," said head coach Ruben Nieves.
"Our plays and the places of players in the
lineup is where we think we do best. It's a
matter of going out executing, playing
hard and playing well."
The strength of USC's attack lies in its
senior Ail-American setter, Donald Suxho,
and the hitting pair of sophomore Brook
Billings and junior Eli Fairfield. Billings,
last year's National Co-Freshman of the
Year, is seventh in the conference with his
kill average of 6.27 kills per game, behind

Stanford freshman Curt loppel, who
leads the conference and the country with
his 8.53 kill average.
But with Fairfield averaging 5.15 kills
per game, Stanford will have to do more
than neutralize Billings to stop the Tro
jans.
"Last time we did a nice job of slowing
down Brook Billings [who hit .233], but
nobody else," Nieves said, referring to
Fairfield's .478 hitting percentage and
sophomore Beau Rawl's .714 perfor
mance. "This time we have to handle their
jump serve better and sideout better."
To do so, the Cardinal will have to face
the strong service game of both junior
Trevor Julian, third in the conference
with a .519 service ace average, and

Suxlio, who is 10th in the conference with
.352 aces per game.
"We have a better passing lineup than
the first time we played them," Nievessaid
pointing to the addition of freshman Billy
Strickland to the lineup. "Our sideout
game, we think, is where we show mental
toughness, our ability to handle serves and
execute our offense. We've improved a lot
in mental toughness and siding out since
the first match."
Tomorrow, Stanford faces Long Beach
State, a team with depth that is hard to
match. The 49ers return all six starters
from last year's NCAA finalist squad, in
( hiding three All-Americans: senior setter
Chris Seiffert, junior outside hitter David
McKienzie and junior middle blocker

Matt Prosser.
McKienzie, this week's MPSF player of
the week, ranks ninth in the conference
with his 5.89 kills-per-game average. His
2.57 dig-per-game average is good
enough for sixth in the conference, just
ahead of Stanford's sophomore Marcus
Skacel, ranked eighth with 2.50 and junior
Josh Lukens, ninth with a 2.30 average.
Prosser boasts the second-highest hit
ting percentage in the conference with
.489 and seventh-highest block average
with 1.65 per game.
And behind the 49ers' star hitters is a
solid, complete team that gives opponents
little room for error.
"Long Beach is a deeper team
than USC; beyond its first six or
seven, they don't drop off much,"
Nieves said. "We've got to play
them straight up and honor all
their attackers. They don't have
holes in their offense."
To go with a powerful offensive
attack is an equally strong defen

sive game for the 49ers.
"Long Beach is known as one of
the better defensive teams in the
country," Nieves said. "Sometimes
the deciding factor is a team's abil
ity to dig, cover hitters and control
the ball."
One of Stanford's strengths this
season has been its sideout ability.
Most recently, the squad posted
125 sideouts in its first three-game
match against Hawaii. To win this
weekend, the team will not only

have to continue to sideout well
but also capitalize on more of its
chances.
""I think it will be necessary to
get a win or two this weekend,"
Nieves said. "We've got to step up
our intensity. It's going to take a
very good sustained effort on our
part. They're not going to give
away too many points; we'll have
to earn them. When opportunities
are created we have to convert a
high percentage of them."
