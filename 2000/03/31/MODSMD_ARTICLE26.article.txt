# Softball faces one-three punch
## No. 1 Washington visits Stanford today, No. 3 UCLA on deck for tomorrow 
### EMILY DRESSEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ihe rain has stopped, the sun is
shining, chants and cheers resound
from the bleachers as bats clank, cleats
pound and mitts smack.
The chorus of sounds from the Stan
ford diamond indicate softball season is
in full swing.
And just like the weather, the Cardi
nal's young team, padded with seven
freshmen, just keeps getting hotter.
In fact, these days, the No. 8 Stan
ford softball team is breaking records
faster than it can play games.
The Cardinal's current 30-4 record
marks the most successful start in the
program's history, passing up last
year's 27-7 beginning.
Yet a tremendous challenge looms
ahead. Two extremely talented Pacific
10 Conference teams will be traveling to
the Farm this weekend to test Stan
ford's success.
The Cardinal will battle No. 1 Wash
ington today and No. 3 UCLA tomor
row and Sunday at the Stanford Soft
ball Complex.
The Huskies currently boast a 36-3
record and the top ranking in the

country, according to the latest Nation
al Fastpitch Coaches' Association poll.
Likewise, defending NCAA champi
on UCLA (25-5) will pose as a consider
able threat to Stanford despite the Car
dinal's home-field advantage.
This weekend will be a good mea
sure of how well the Cardinal can per
form against other very competitive
Pac-10 teams. The team's conference
games will most likely be the hardest
matchups it will face all season.
This week in the polls, the top five
spots and seven of the top 11 are
claimed by Pac-10 programs. In the
world of collegiate Softball, the West
Coast typically dominates.
The Cardinal opened Pac-10 play
with a doubleheader against rival No. 4
California last week in Berkeley. The
team was charged with emotion, know
ing it would have to play its best to de
feat the Golden Bears.
Stanford dropped the first game in a
nail-biting 12-inning overtime duel, 6-
5, but then avenged during the second
game, posting a 2-0 victory.
"Cal was our last Pac-10 game of the
season last year and we were ahead the
entire way, until the bottom of the sev
enth when they came back and left us
standing there on the field, stunned,"
said sophomore center-fielder Jessica
Mendoza.
"This year we wanted to beat them
so badly. We finally got our revenge in
the second game."

Although this weekend brings two of
the most challenging teams it will face,
the Cardinal appears up to the task.
The team is playing stellar Softball, led
by four freshman pitchers who have
commanded the circle like old pros.
This year's combined ERA, a low 1.09,
is on pace to shatter the school record of
1.30 and demonstrates just how impres
sive these freshman players are.
The offense has made some gigantic
strides from last season as well, headed
by senior catcher Kellie Wiginton, who
is only three hits shy of becoming Stan
ford's all-time hit leader.
Sophomore shortstop Robin Walk
er, batting .407, and Mendoza (.459)
have also contributed enormously to
Stanford's offensive machine.
Mendoza has already tied the single
season stolen base record with nine this
year and seems destined to break the
record for the young team.
Today against Washington, the Car
dinal is anxious to put all these ele
ments together to defeat the top team
in the nation. Fear is not an option.
"As coach told us, 'How many other
teams get the No.l and N0.3 seed to
come and play on their home fields?' "
said Mendoza.
"We aren't looking at them with awe
though. We want to go out and show
we can compete among the best, and
even beat the best.
"That's our motivation this week
end."
