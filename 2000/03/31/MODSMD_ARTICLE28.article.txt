# Women score four, drop one in pool to stay No. 2
## Water polo beats UCLA but loses Pettit until mid-April 
### ELISSA KESZLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford women's water
polo team had a busy spring break, notch
ing three wins and just one loss. Stanford
defeated No. 3 UCLA 9-7, UC-Santa Bar
bara 13-5 and Pacific 9-3, but fell short to
No. I California, 6-3.
The Cardinal is now 15-4 overall and
6-1 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation.
On March 19 Stanford traveled to
southern California to face the Bruins.
After the first half, the Cardinal's outlook
was dim as UCLA held a three-goal lead at
4-1. Stanford pulled together and rallied
to score eight goals in the second half, giv
ing it the 9-7 victory and enabling it to hold
on to its No. 2 ranking.
Juniors Allison kiddell and Kris koblik
and freshman Julie Cardner put away two
goals each. Junior Kelly Shouey, sopho
more Margie Dingeldein and freshman
Amy Lightner each had one score. Red
shirt freshman Jackie Frank totaled 10
saves as goalkeeper.
"We had a good game against UCLA,
especially coming off of an intense week of
finals," said junior co-captain Hilary Callo
gly. "We also were not at our lull capacity
because many people were suffering from
illness or injury."
Among the ill and injured was sopho
more Kate Pettit. Pettit broke her left hand
during practice on March 18 and will not
return to play for the Cardinal until mid-
April. She is currently one of Stanford's
leading scorers as a hole-set and 6-on-5
specialist.
PetUt's loss will put an added strain on
the team's two other hole-sets, Shouey and
Cardner, as Stanford finishes its confer
ence play and participates in the MPSF
championship tournament. The Cardinal
remains hopeful that she will be back in
full force by the national qualifying tour
nament April 22-23.
This past Sunday, Stanford ended its
spring break by going up against cross-
Bay rival California. The Cardinal had
hoped to drown the Bears and secure its
spot as the top team in the nation.

The two teams went back and forth in
scoring throughout the game until the
fourth quarter, when Cal was able to pull
ahead by two. As the end of the quarter
approached, Stanford tailed in a risky at
tempt to score, leaving a California play
er open across the pool. A Cardinal
turnover allowed the Hears to feed the
ball to their open player and score the
final goal of the game as the clock ran
out.
1 his was the third time the Cardinal has
faced California this season, and it was also
its third loss. Despite this record, Stanford
remains confident it can beat the Bears in
future games.
Stanford players feel that the losses to
Cal were due to Stanford errors rather
than the skill and playing ability of the Cal
players.
" The loss to Cal was disappointing,"
said junior goalie Alii Henry. "They did
not outplay us. Rather, we were intimidat
ed in our shooting and could not convert
our offensive opportunities."
Over spring break, two Cardinal play
ers, Dingeldein and Gardner, were named
MPSF players of the week. Dingeldein,
who is known for her unrelenting speed
and agility, is currently the team's leading
scorer. She received honors the week of
March 19 for her performance at the
Aloha Classic, where she was named the
tournament MVF.
Gardner, who is the Cardinal's second
leading scorer, received honors this week
for her outstanding offensive and defen
sive play against the Bruins. Even though
Gardner is only a freshman, she is a huge
asset to the team with her scoring abilities
from both the perimeter and die two
meter position and for her graceful ball
handling skills.
As Stanford moves through its season
and national championships approach, it
will be turning its attention on making
subtle improvements.
"We will be focusing more on fine tun
ing details," Gallogly said. "We have a
solid defense and we set ourselves up well
011 offense, so we will be turning our atten
tion to finishing what we set up."
Stanford has two home games in its
near future. Today, the Cardinal will take
011 Long Beach State, and Saturday it will
face San Diego State. Both games will be
played at 4 p.m. at deGuerre Pool.
