# Senior becomes SF Examiner cartoonist
## Strip focuses on computer industry and the job search for the everyman HIRE & HIRE 
### KATIE HILL RYAN PARKS 
The transition to the New Year
began with a new line of work for senior
Ryan Parks: cartoonist.
In Janurary Parks became the newest
cartoonist in The San Francisco Exam
iner. His strip, "Hire and Hire," runs
every Sunday in the Career Search sec
tion, which is produced jointly by the
Examiner and The San Francisco
Chronicle.
The strip focuses on life at the
Taskmaster Staffing temp agency and
the quirky cast of characters that come
to its manager, Priscilla Perkins, in
search of employment.
Asked what inspired him to write
about the job market, Parks said, "I had
done some comics for The Daily and
The [Stanford] Review freshman and
sophomore year and had wanted to do a
strip. As I started to do more and more

interviews, I starting thinking about lo
dising on jobs. Then I got an e-mail list
of all the funny stuff that people have
clone in job interviews. That really crys
tallized it for me."
Parks explained that targeting the
job section of the paper he got his "foot
in the door. To get on the comics page,
they have to kick something else oil.
This is probably the only way 1 could
have launched the strip."
Dave Murphy, the Career Search ed
itor who decided to run "Hire and
Hire," was enthusiastic about Parks's
work. "It helps to brighten the section a
little bit. We try to have a variety of
things for a variety of people, and this is
a nice little bright spot."
Parks commented that the strip is an
"outlet for corny jokes. Things work in a
strip that would not work as a joke in
conversation." He noted that "for some
reason, I have to go jogging to come up

with jokes — something about that com
bination of pain and creativity that
seems to work."
While most of his strips are not based
on real life experiences, Parks is inter
ested in soliciting more reader input. "I
am thinking of putting something
under the strip that asks people to share
their funny job interview stories," lie
saicl.
Silicon Valley, with its high job
turnover rates, has provided some in
spiration. Still. Parks contends, the strip
is not only applicable to Silicon Valley
readers. "I think it's pretty universal.
When 1 make a computer joke, I try to
make it something that everyone can
understand."
Parks is currently working on trying
to sell the strip to other papers looking
to add something new to their career

sections.
He expects to graduate in June
and to go to work on a launch of
his own startup marketing a new
way to navigate the Web, and says
he hopes that the strip can remain
"a profitable side job."
