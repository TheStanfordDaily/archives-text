# Sexual harassment case in jury's hands
## 
### FRANK POLLOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Now that the lawyers have
made their closing remarks, the
lawsuit brought by Colleen (jan
gle against Stanford University is
in the hands of a four-man, four
woman jury for final deliberations.
The issue being decided is
whether or not Crangle was laid
off from her post in Stanford's
medical information lab in retalia
tion for accusations she made of
being harassed by male co-work
ers.
According to The San Jose
Mercury News, Crangle's head at
torney Dan Spiegel told jurors to

"[t]ell Stanford University this is
not the way to treat. . . women.
Women have to be treated equally
and because you haven't, you have
to pay some money."
In their closing arguments,
Stanford's lawyers, led by Michael
Lucey, tried to create doubt as to
whether Crangle had reasonable
cause to claim gender discrimina
tion.
Lucey emphasized that not one
of Crangle's 70 colleagues from
the information lab would testify
to the "oppressive atmosphere"
that she claimed to work in.
Spiegel argued that Stanford
administrators are trying to cover
up a retaliation motive in Cran
gle's firing. Though Stanford
claims that Crangle was about to be

laid off due to lack of funding,
Spiegel argued on Wednesday
that if she had been given a fair
share of a grant she had helped
earn, her salary could have been
paid for at least another two
months.
The jury began its deliberation
late Wednesday and is expected to
reach a verdict by the end of the
week. The case is being closely

watched because its outcome
could have a strong effect on the
U.S. Department of' Labor's ongo
ing investigation into Stanford's
employment history.
Crangle is one of 32 current
or former Stanford employees
who have filed formal Labor De
partment complaints of gender
disctimination against the Uni
versity.
