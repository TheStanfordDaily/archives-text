# Tenure group created
## Ethics in Society, Res Ed, Academic Theme Houses undergo minor changes 
### SCOTT DORFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As part of yesterday's Faculty
Senate meeting, Provost John
Hennessy announced the forma
tion of a fact-finding committee
that will look into decisions re
garding tenure and promotions at
the University.
The members announced in
yesterday's Faculty Senate meet
ing are Economics Prof. Gavin
Wright, Molecular and Cellular
Physiology Prof. Richard Aldrich,
Linguistics Prof. Eve Clark, Eng
lish Prof. Barbara Celpi, Surgery
Prof. Oscar Salvatierra and Me
chanical Engineering Prof. Bill
Reynolds. They will be joined by

six as-yet unannounced faculty
members on the fact-finding com
mittee.
Later in the meeting, debate
erupted over a proposal by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies recommended that the
six Academic Theme Houses be
renamed "Language and Culture
Residences," that these resi
dences focus only on foreign lan
guage and culture and that each
residence make room for acade
mic staff from a relevant depart
ment.
The current academic theme
houses are LAST House, Casa
Italiana, Haus Mitteleuropa, La
Maison Slavianskii
Dom and the American Studies
house.
The committee also recom
mended that each house be con
sidered for renewal every four
years and that underiilled theme
houses be re-assigned to alternate
residential locations.
The recommendation, pro
posed by Director of the Human
Biology program Russell Fernald,
chair of the committee, ran into
opposition from various faculty
members. A group of professors,
particularly Philosophy Prof.
Debra Satz, Linguistics Prof. John
Rickford and Psychology Prof.
Ewart Thomas, argued it would
be a mistake to completely shift
the focus of Academic Theme
Houses to only language and cul

ture, and that houses centered
around subjects such as engineer
ing and politics could be beneficial
to students.
The subject concluded with a
straw vote on whether or not to
change the name of Academic
Theme Houses to Language and
Culture Residences, a vote that
would be reported back to CUS as
a recommendation. The Senate
split roughly 50 / 50 on the issue,
leaving Fernald to remark that he
would have to report "a house di
vided" regarding the issue of re
naming theme houses at the next
CUS meeting.
Senate members also heard a
review of the Residential Educa
tion Program from Vice Provost
for Student Affairs James Mon

toya, head of a task force on resi
dential education. Montoya
specifically focused on the all
sophomore I'oyon house and
Freshman / Sophomore College
in Sterling Quadrangle, saying
that the residences seem to be
having success at integrating aca
demics into residential life.
"I believe that the quality of
experience in residence educa
tion is a strong factor students
consider when choosing whether
or not to attend Stanford," said
Montoya. "I am convinced as well
that we have incredible potential
to use residences to achieve the
academic mission of the Univer
sity."
The senators also voted unani
mously to accept the Committee

on Undergraduate Studies' rec
ommendation to renew the Ethics
in Society Program, an interdisci
plinary program comprised of
philosophy, political science and
history, for another five years. Re
view of interdisciplinary pro
grams is mandatory every five
years, and the Senate must decide
whether to discontinue or renew
the program after each five-year
period.
"1 accept the recommendation
from the Committee on Under
graduate Studies," said Sat/., chair
of the Ethics in Society program.
"We are a great program with
great students, and I hope we can
make the program a larger part of
the lives of Stanford students in
the future."
