Americans are setting a bad example
for the world through overconsump
tion and lac k of environmental aware
ness, former Republican Rep. Claudine
Schneider told .1 group ol undergradu
ates and law students yesterday at the
Law School.
Schneider, a contributing author to
the book "The Planetary Interest,"
stressed the need for more individual
responsibility in protecting the environ
ment and said ibis would improve
America's image 011 the international
scene.
"I've always been very conscious of
how the rest of the world sees Ameri
ca . . . right now I'm not happy with
their view," Schneider said.
"Our ecological footprint is enor
mous," said Sc hneider, who cited the
statistic that "although the United States
makes up only five percent of the
world's population, its citizens consume
between 25 and 30 percent of world re

sources . . . and are responsible for 27
percent of world carbon dioxide emis
sions."
She said that Americans, who "use
cell phones, shop at the Cap, and drive
fancy cars," are not setting the right ex
ample for other nations.
With ten years of experience in
Washington, Schneider said that she
had "a strong feeling of w hat could
and should be done," but expressed
dismay over the current state of
American politics.
Calling Congress "deaf" to Ameri
cans' wish to reform the political system
and to protect the environment, she
suggested that business or the media
could step in to fill that role.
Schneider said the media were "total
ly unaware of its role and responsibility,"
and said, "We need to put more pressure
on the media.
"Corporations could be much more
political, much more vocal," she said.
While she expressed distaste for car
companies, namely General Mo
tors, she cited Patagonia, 3M and
DuPont as positive examples of
socially responsible corporations.
Schneider told students to be
lieve that they could effect posi
tive change in the world.
"Clearly there is an opportuni
ty for you to provide leadership . .
. we have to start by looking in the
mirror," Schneider said.

From 1980 to 1990, Schneider
served as a Republican represen
tative from Rhode Island. While
in Congress, she co-sponsored
the first ever Republican-drafted
climate-change bill. Currently,
she lives in Boulder, Colorado.
Yesterday's speech was co
sponsored by the Institute for In
telnational Studies, the Stanford
Knvironmental Law Society, the
Stanford in Government Public
Policy forum and Students for
Environmental Action at Stan
ford.
