Allergies are common both
year round and season
ally. Although there is no cure,
there is symptomatic relief.
Symptoms
■ Red, swollen, itchy or watery
eyes
■ Runny, itchy, or stuffy nose
■ Scratchy throat
■ Sneezing, wheezing, or
cough
What's happening: Your
immune system is reacting to
harmless substances as if they
were harmful. Learn about your
allergies: record symptoms,
when they occur, and what sets
them off.
Causes
Pollen: Allergy to pollen from
grasses, weeds, or trees occurs
seasonally: usually spring, early
summer, or early fall. So:
■ Avoid activities that stir up
pollen
■ Keep the windows in your
car and rooms closed, espe
cially at night
■ Use air conditioning when
possible
■ Stay inside when pollen
counts are high if you can;
keep animals out (animal
dander makes allergies worse)
■ Go out in the early morning
and late afternoon (pollen
count is lowest)
Dust: Dust contains allergens
(pollen, mold spores, dust
mites, animal dander).
■ Keep your bedroom dust-free
■ Avoid the things that collect
dust (carpets, upholstery,
blinds)
Pollen from grasses, weeds, ami
trees hits just when you want to
be out riding your bike in the
countryside. Let's hope this
Stanford student in the early
1940s wasn't allergic to them.
■ Enclose your mattress in a
washable cover, and keep it
clean
■ Keep windows closed and
use air- conditioning when
possible
Animal Dander: Keep the furry
and feathered pets outside, or
at least out of your bedroom
Mold or Mildew: Often
appear during damp weather.
To reduce mold:
■ Keep rooms well vented
and dry
■ Clean surfaces with bleach
Antihistamines
These block the action of hista
mine, cut down the allergic
reaction, dry up a runny nose,
and stop itching. Some tips:
■ If you can predict your expo
sure, take them ahead of time
■ May have side effects (e.g., dry
mouth, drowsiness, reduced
cognitive performance)
■ Read ingredients on labels
(single ingredient ones are
usually best), or ask your
pharmacist for a recom
mendation
■ Try many to find what works
for you
■ Nasalcrom nasal spray may
be a good alternative
Decongestants
These constrict the blood ves
sels and cut down on secretions.
Here's some tips:
■ Avoid nasal spray decon
gestants
■ Oral decongestants (e.g.,
Sudafed) may keep you
awake or make you drowsy
■ If you have problems with
high blood pressure or
rapid heart rate, consult an
M.D. before taking
Talk to a Doctor
■ If your allergies do not
respond to antihistamines
■ If the over-the-counter anti
histamines work, but they
cause drowsiness
Note: Prescription drugs may
not cause drowsiness, but they
are much more expensive
Medical Emergencies
If you have a severe allergic
reaction - wheezing, difficulty
breathing, tightening throat,
swelling in lips, tongue, or face
(e.g., after an insect sting, a
certain drug, or food) go to
Cowell IMMEDIATELY. When
Cowell is closed, go to the ER.
