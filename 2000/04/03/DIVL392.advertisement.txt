News from in and around
Stanford Federal Credit Union.
Woman Changes Her
Name to "Stanford Fed
CU" to Honor
Credit Union
"It's hard to get used to
so my close friends still
call me Ivonne"
The member formerly known as
Ivonne Ortega has had such positive
experiences with Stanford Federal
Credit Union that she is considering
changing her name. At the age of 18
she got her first loan from the Credit
Union—co-signed by her mother.
After a year of establishing a good
credit pattern, she refinanced the loan
in her own name.
"Credit Unions are so much
better [than banks]! They're non
profit, unlike banks that try to take
your money for fees and extra
charges.The Credit Union is simple
and easy—and they're a great deal! I
got a really good rate on my new car."
says (the former) Ms. Ortega.
She is concerned about the
reaction of others to her new name,

Advice from IRA
Dear IRA,
I am paying through the
nose on my taxes this year. Any
advice?
Signed,
Tired of Taxes
Dear Tired,
Yow! That must be hard on the
nasal passages, as well as being
messy.You want to save on taxes?
You need an IRA. (Not a handsome
chap like me, an Individual Retire
ment Account.)
There are different kinds of IRAs
and they have various advantages.
Read on you sweaty masses...
Traditional IRAs: Income
invested in a traditional IRA ($2OOO
max for individual, $4,000 per
couple) is tax deductible. More
liberal rules for withdrawing funds
make this a good choice for those
who want to save on taxes now.
Withdrawn funds will be taxed
according to the tax bracket you
are in at the time of withdrawal.
Roth IRA: Invest after-tax dollars
in a Roth IRA and earnings are tax
free. Penalty-free too when with
drawn according to any of the
following scenarios: Funds are held
for at least five years, AND (1) you
are at least age 59 1/2, or (2) you
become disabled, or (3) the funds
will be used fora first-time home
purchase. Funds can also be with-

drawn after five years for education,
however the funds will not be tax
free if used for this purpose.
Education IRA: Ai'ter-tax dollars
are invested and earnings will be
tax-free if used to pay for qualified
higher education expenses.The
maximum contribution is $500 per
dependent child per year. Both
parents and grandparents can take
ad\#mtage of education IRAs if the
combined income is less than
$ 150,000 or filing singly, the income
is less than $95,000.
Got all that? Be sure to consult
your tax advisor (since I'm just
some schmo who likes to tell
people what to do) to see which
IRA is best for you.
Most importantly, check the IRA
options at SFCU.
You can thank me later.

Lottery Addict Changes
His Strategy Loan Rate Comparison
Institution APR* Max. Term Fees
Ezra T." Lucky" Booaacrisp had a
formula for picking lottery numbers
that he was sure would net him
millions. Numbers, numbers, every
where he'd see numbers calling to
him. Last week his dreams were full of
loan rate comparison charts showing
him the low-rates of Stanford Federal
Credit Union and the higher rates of
other financial institutions.
"I thought I was supposed to play
those numbers, but after I started
rounding them off to whole numbers
it came to me: Stanford Federal Credit
Union rates are so reasonable, I don't
need to wait to win the lottery to get
a new car. My Gremlin is riding 011
thin rubber right now, if ya know
what I mean."
