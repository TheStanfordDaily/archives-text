Honor Code
A. The Honor Code is an undertaking of the students,
individually and collectively
Fundamental Standard
"Students at Stanford are expected to show both within and without the
University such respect for order, morality, personal honor and the rights of
others as is demanded of good citizens. Failure to do this will be sufficient
cause for removal from the University."

C. While the faculty alone has the right and obligation to
set academic requirements, the students and faculty will
work together to establish optimal conditions for honorable
academic work.
1. that they will not give or receive aid in examinations;
that they will not give or receive unpermitted aid in class
work, in the preparation of reports, or in any other work
that is to be used by the instructor as the basis of
grading;
2. that they will do their share and take an active part in
seeing to it that others as well as themselves uphold the
spirit and letter of the Honor Code.
B. The faculty on its part manifests its confidence in the
honor of its students by refraining from proctoring
examinations and from taking unusual and unreasonable
precautions to prevent the forms of dishonesty mentioned
above. The faculty will also avoid, as far as practicable,
academic procedures that create temptations to violate the
Honor Code.
