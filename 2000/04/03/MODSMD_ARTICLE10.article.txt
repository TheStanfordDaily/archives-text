### CHRISTINA R. STANSELL 
I he Presidential Lecture Series
wraps up the first two years of lec
tures by eminent scholars in the hu
manities tonight with a presenta
tion by Wollgang I ser, professor of
English and comparative literature
at the University of Constance in
(ierniany, at 7 p.m. at room 290 in
the I .aw School.
Iser is known for studying lead
ing as an activity and stressing that
the meaning of literary texts conies
as much from the reader as from
the author. Well known asa literary
critic, Iser has written several
books, including "The Act of Read
ing: A Theory of Aesthetic Re
sponse."
The series will continue next
year with a new director. (compar
ative Literature Prof. Hans Cium
brecht, who oversaw the program
since its inception in 1998, is step
ping down.
"I'm not stepping down because
1 am frustrated," Cunibrecht said,
but rather because bringing in
"new intellectual taste is important
fin such events to function." He
also s;iid the transition is going as
planned and he is "happy that the
program would be extended." A
successor has not vet been named.
Several prominent scholars, iii
chiding I larold Bloom and I lenry
Louis Cates, Jr.. have lectured at
Stanford as part of the series.
As for next year's program, "the
format and rhvthni will basically
stav the same, although it might
have a different intellectual style,"
Cunibrecht said. I lie series al
read\ has a pool of potential pre

senters to work with for next year.
The total financial compensation
will also stay the same.
Cunibrecht said the continua
tion of the lectures indicates the
sue cess of the first two years. "It has
done something unique lor the
University. It makes the humani
ties more visible here," he said.
I lelen Brooks, professor of Eng
lish and interdisciplinary studies in
humanities, also expressed satisfac
tion with the series.
"The Presidential Lectures have
made, overall, a positive contribu
tion to the humanities at Stanford,
primarily in generating dialogue
— even debate — on campus
about humanistic issues addressed
in the lectures," Brooks said.
"I hope that future planning will
give more thought to how the
speakers can connect with an even
broader spectrum of students, es
pecially undergraduates, to height
en student awareness of the cen
t rality of the humanities to their ed
ucation and beyond," Brooks said,
adding that "these students are the
future of the humanities in its
broadest sense."
The put pose of the Presidential
Lectures and Symposia is to "ex
plore new roles and relationships
for the I lumanities and Arts in the
academic community as we enter
the 21st Century," according to the
series Web site at

(iumbrecht reports the Web site
lias received 2.5 million hits during
the first two years of the program.
