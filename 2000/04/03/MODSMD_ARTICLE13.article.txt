### 
WASHINGTON (AP)—Talks between Microsoft
Corp. and government lawyers failed after the com
pany insisted on its own proposal to settle the
antitrust lawsuit and not because of disputes between
state and federal officials, persons familiar with the
negotiations said yesterday.
I lie talks broke down Saturday, sending the case
back to U.S. District Judge Thomas Pen field Jackson
in W ashington, who last fill issued a finding of fact
that Microsoft used its monopoly powers to thwart
competition.
A decision on the lawsuit is expected any day, and
if Jackson sides with the government, he will begin
the lengthy process of determining a penalty that
could include a breakup or a restructuring of the
company.

Sources said government lawyers no longer were
insisting on a breakup, but that Microsoft refused to
accept proposals submitted by the Justice Depart
ment and 19 states who sued the company.
Even before the states made new proposals Fri
day, "It was clear Microsoft was rejecting the gov
ernment's proposal and insisting on their own
approach," said an individual familiar with the gov
ernment's position, who would not be quoted by
name.
"That approach had a lot of loopholes and would
not have been effective."
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates contended Satur
day that "it became impossible to settle because the
Department of Justice and the states were not work
ing together."
