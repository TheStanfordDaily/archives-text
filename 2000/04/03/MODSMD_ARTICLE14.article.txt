# Battle for Elian continues
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — With a deadline
looming and legal options narrowing, relatives of
Elian Gonzalez pressed arguments yesterday that
the boy's father is unfit as they battled to retain
custody of the 6-year-old.
The White House responded that there is no
evidence of the sort, and the father's lawyer said
the "outrageous" allegations were a sign the
Miami relatives are getting desperate. "There is
no doubt this father loves his boy very, very
much," said Gregory Craig, who represents Juan
Miguel (ionzalez.
l hree of the relatives' attorneys, appearing
separately on three talk shows yesterday, suggest
ed that the father is not lit to raise Elian. Attorney
Manny Diaz said the legal team has submitted evi
dence to federal court and to the government,
although he declined to detail it yesterday.
"One of the lawyers on our team met with the
attorney general at the beginning of this process
and raised those types of concern," Diaz said on
ABC's "This Week."
But Craig said the family is just now raising the
issue after months of allowing that (ionzalez was a
loving man. "It's outrageous that at this point in
this discussion. . . they're raising these kinds of
questions," he said on CNN's "Late Edition."
The family's arguments, backed up by mem
bers of Congress who want Elian to remain in the
United States, come as the Justice Department
insists that the relatives agree to surrender Klian if
they lose their pending court case.
Justice has given the relatives until tomorrow to
sign such a promise and has threatened to revoke
the boy's permission to be in this country if they
do not agree. That deadline has been extended
twice already.
Family members want to preserve their option
to keep up the legal fight even if they lose their
case in federal court, which enforces immigration

law. I he) also want a family court, which consid
ers a child's best interests, to hear the case.
The Miami relatives have said they will surren
der the boy if Immigration and Naturalization
Service officers show up at their door and demand
him. Federal officials hope to avoid that.
All sides professed that the boy's welfare is their
primal) interest.
Diaz said turning Klian over to his father would
cause "further irreversible trauma."
But John Podesta, the White House chief of
staff, stressed that the Clinton administration
believes Klian should be with bis father, who wants
him back in C '.üba.
"A child belongs with his natural parent unless
that parent's unfit," he said on CBS's "Face the
Nation." "We have no indication that Elian's
father is an unfit parent."
Si ill, attorney Linda Osberg-Braun continued
to push that theory.
She said that the father told Elian on the phone
that his mother was alive and waiting for him in
Cuba when, in fact, his mother died in the effort
to reach the F nited States.
Elian was left dinging to an inner tube until
being rescued in November.
Osberg-Braun speculated that Elian's father
was under the influence of the Cuban government
when he misled his son.
"That's cruel, and we understand that that's
because of the forces in Cuba coaching him and
coercing him to sav these horrible things to his
son," she said on CBS. "That needs to be dis
cussed. It needs to be explored."
Supportive members of Congress backed up
the attorneys' theories.
"1 hey do take kids away from fathers and keep
them away from them where there's child abuse
or problems. We don't know what the situation
is," Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said on CNN.
