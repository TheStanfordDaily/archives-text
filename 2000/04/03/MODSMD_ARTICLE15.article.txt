senior Suzannali lipcrmas about the experience of
eaiing disorders, drew .1 si, Hiding ovation follow ing its
performance on Satnrda\. April I.
"I'art ol my motivation in starting 111 is vvliole re
sea rc 11 ,iikl |>la\ was that all hough there arc abundant
media attention and coverage given 10 this issue nowa
days, there isn't as much artist i( voice. And 1 believeart
is a very powerful wa\ of expressing 01 communicat
ing a covert social issue such .is eaiing disorders,"
I ipernias said.
1 ipermas embarked on this project last spring
w hen she received an I ndcrgradiiatc Research ()p

" I his one-woman show was inspired l>\ the woi ks
(»112 Drama I'rof. Anna DeVcare. lint while liei works
are pi imarilv imitations of liei subjects, mine is more
of a n interpretation. I moulded the raw expel iencesol
diflerenl voices, included movement ,11 id pasted lhem
logethci like a collage. I ipermas said.
I he show w as organized in a coherent manner, tak
ing the audience through a join 1 lev with 11.111 ,niveex
cerpts from the finned siorv ".Mice in Wonderland."
I 1 pel mas called .Mice "the original girl with an eating
c I isc >rder."
"I wanted to send the message that while it's prcttv
nine 11 invisible, espec iallv in Stanford, eaiing disorclei s
are not uncommon at all. lis not something people arc
experieue ing in a vac mini, and it's not something that
should he taboo to speak out about," I ipei mas said.
"This Little filing" opened last Wednesday and
(l<>scd on Saturday. I ipermas held voluutarv disc us

sion sessions with the audiences after her perfor
mances 011 I 11111 sclav and Friday night.
"We all expected for the majority ol the audience to
be females, and we were surprised to find many males
participating in the discussions afterward. The audi
ences' reactions have been great. Many of them have
personally related to a lot of the themes, and they were
frank and open about sharing ilieni with others,"
I ipermas said.
I ipermas was also surprised lo encounter ques
tions that raised issues about eating disorders in
males.
"While that's definitely an issue that deserves atten
tion, mv woi k foe used 011 just eating disorders within
women. Honestly speaking, it was a scary project to
embark upon; ii brought back old memories, and
sometimes it seemed to be simply overwhelming,"
I ipei mas said.
I ipermas, who has personal experience with eat
ing disorders, emphasized that " I his Little 112 iling"
was not |iisi about women with eating disorders, but
encompassed universal themes of identity.
"li s about one's own identity in ibis community,
about womanhood, family, gender, human relation
ships and emotion," she said.
"11 \v< >uld be great if inv show could provicle s<>mc
thing lo start a conversation surrounding this issue,
li s an unpleasant issue lo talk about, but you can't
start lo heal something it vou don 1 ac knowledge 11
first.
I feel Stanford students beai some liability to ibis
issue bee .nise we're going lo be verv influential people
111 the future soc ieiv. I .ike inv last phrase in the show,
every person's struggle and achievement has social
significance, and is influential in redirecting the soc i
etv to a better direction," said I'ipermas.
Sophomore Christine Letizia called I ipermas'
she>w "incredible."
"1 thought ii said <1 lot ol stuff I had in my own head.
Ii represented women, not just one particular
woman," Letizia said.
