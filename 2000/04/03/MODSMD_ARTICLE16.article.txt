# Wisconsin decision unlikely to affect Stanford fee system
## 
### AMIT GARG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
ASSI officials have no plans to change the I niversi
tv's current fee refund system, despite a recent Supreme
(lourt decision allowing universities to force students to
pay mandatory fees.
1 he legal debate over student fees began in 1996,
when law students at the University of Wisconsin chal
lenged the school's mandatory fee policy. A federal
judge and a federal appeals court ruled against the uni
versity, but the nation's highest court reversed the deci
sion last week.
Citing the l irst Amendment, the students argued
they should not have to fund groups with views differ
ent from their own. Kacli of the MH.OOO students pays
about SI "> to be distributed to different groups.
But the justices unanimously decided that Wiscon
sin's fee system does not violate a student's right to free
speech.
Stanford's own polity is to allow for refunds of the
$171 fee for the 1999-2000 academic year.
"In the annual ASSI Spring (ieneral Klection, stu
dents vote on eac li student organization fee separately,
allowing students to choose which student groups they
would like to lund," explained ASSL' vice president
John Mills.
"II individual students subsequently decide to with
hold financial support from specific student organiza
tions, a fee refund can be requested through ASSI On
line," said Mills, a genetics doctoral student. The request
must be made wit hit l the first three weeks of the quar

tt*r.
In :U)4 percent of undergraduates and 8.82
percent of graduate students requested a complete or
partial refund of their special fees.
Sean Lucy, ASSL financial manager, also pointed
out that ASSI only redistributes resources. "ASSL fees
actually don't go to run the ASSL' itself. Student fees ai e
decided in the spring general election, and collec ted l>y
the ASSL to be redistributed to student groups at Stan
ford."
Controversy at Stanford was spurred this year when
Inter Varsity Craduate Christian Fellowship, a graduate
student religious group, requested funding from the
ASSL. ()ld Senate rules did not allow student fees to be
distributed to religious groups, but after much debate
the new Senate approved the funding request this
March.
Some students said they agreed with Stanford's cur
rent lee policy.
Freshman Ben Patton said, "I am fine with the
process. It seems to be democratic."
"Stanford's policy of allocating fees is certainly de
mocratic. It is careful and well thought," said senior
Martin Fichtner.
"Hut about funding religious groups, 1 don't know.
It all depends on how they use the resources and what
is a right and a wrong use of funding."
ASSU president Mike Levin, a junior, said "In m\
opinion we have one of the best fee systems of any stu
dent association."
"If students don't want to support a particular group
for any reason, they don't have to."
