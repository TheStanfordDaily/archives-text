THE PRESIDENTIAL SEARCH Com
mittee's decision to nominate I Diversity
Provost Joliii Hennessy as Stanford's
next president is an outcome The Daily
supports, along with a few suggestions for the new
president.
As dean of the School of Engineering, and then
as provost, Hennessy lias demonstrated, in no
uncertain terms, that he possesses both the know
how and the charisma to successfully carry out the
responsibilities of top administrative positions.
Hennessy played an integral role in securing the
$150 million donation of Silicon Valley business
man and former Stanford (Computer Science I'rof.
Jim Clark in Nov. 1999, the largest donation given
to Stanford since its founding.
This donation is being used to develop the new
interdisciplinary Program in Biomedical Engi

neering and Sciences — also known by Stanford
faculty as Bio-X— representing a major contribu
tion to University 112 undraising, arguably one of the
most important functions of any university presi
dent.
Praised by colleagues and students alike, Hen
nessy \\;ts ;i deal choice for provost according to
former ASSU President Maren Norton and Devel
opmental Biology Prof . Lucy Shapiro, a co-chair of
the search committee that recommended Hen
nessy to Casper, as stated in a Daily story on May
2(>, 1999.
loday, as the University (Hepaies to pon
tentially welcome Hennessy into its presidential
position, it would seem as though the choice was
equally clear this time around. However, despite
Hennessy's extensive qualifications, the source of
those qualifications — namely, the sciences — as

well as the increasingly contentious development
of Stanford's image as a "techie" school necessitate
that the new president pay special attention the
humanities and social sciences.
At the time of Hentiessy's appointment to
provost, University students and faculty had
already begun to perceive a trend at Stanford of
moving away from the humanities and social st i
ences, causing many to cite this very issue as a top
priority for incoming provost Hennessy. Now, as
Hennessy will likely become president, this issue
remains at the fore.
As president, Hennessy must make every
effort to ensure that the humanities and social sci
ences receive the much-needed consideration
students and faculty have been calling for, rein
forcing the University's commitment to offering
students a balanced education and supporting all

fields of study.
In beginning lo address this problem, Hen
nessy should make evident his endorsement of
humanities and social science programs, like
Stanford Introductory Studies, which has its
loots in the humanities, as well as actively sup
port the initiatives of humanities and social sci
ence departments, faculty, and students, who
have expressed feelings of neglect.
Stanford's growing problem with housing facul
ty members clue to high local housing costs and
the challenge of attracting high-quality faculty also
rank high on the list of major issues facing Hen
nessy when he assumes the post of president. Dur
ing his short term as provost, Hennessy pledged to
locus on all of these issues and The Daily hopes he
will continue to act upon that pledge as he moves
into his new position.
