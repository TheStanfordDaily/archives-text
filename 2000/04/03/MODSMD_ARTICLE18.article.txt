# WHAT THE HECK I'M TALKING ABOUT
## Run, Stanford, run! 
### 
Ah, the second week of the quar
ter. Hello, sunshine. Welcome
back, warm weather. Whip
your Daisy Dukes out of stor
age, 'cause it's springtime at Stanford.
1 thought that perhaps this week it
might be interesting to take a closer
look at one of the many ways Stanford
students like to ring in the new season.
For instance, the lawn-chair hikini-and
trunks-clad sunbathers and frisbee
throwers who speckle Wilbur field. The
sparkle of 15 units on your Axess

screen.
But today I'd like to
focus on one spring
quarter phenomenon.
Runners. Flocks and
Hi»( ks ol them.
I know, Campus
Drive loop is always
crowded with i tinners.
Fven during LI Nino
fall quarter m\ Iresh-

man year, I'd see kids charging (<>t
maybe just walking) througli the doors
of Wilbur (lining, tossing back the hoods
of their rain-soaked windhreakers, and
making John \\'ayne-es(|iie entrances as
if to say, "I am wet. And I am hungry."
But those were the lew and the brave.
People like myself, who wait until the
official Stanford running season (spring
quarter — pay attention), secretly
thought that the rain runners were
either the self-inflicted-suffering types
or that they didn't run at all. but
dressed in running clothes all day long
and got wet just to have the appearance
of being super-athletes.
But, despite the fact that you can find
someone running somewhere on cam
pus at practically any given moment
during the day or night, spring quarter
does up the ante significantly. This time
of year, you can literally find packs of
runners, joggers, and the occasional
brave speed-walker swarming along
Campus Drive and trekking up to the
Dish or the Foothills.
Mind you, the packs are not neces
sarily formed bv choice. They are traffic
jams. II you actually want to be alone
while you run, you might have to drive
out of a 10-mile radius. Need a running
partner? Run half a mile and I guaran
tee that you'll "run into" one.
And of course there's always that one
especially warm and sunny clay, early in
the quarter, that marks the unofficial
beginning of the season. This day is
commemorated by the first appearance
of sports bras without shirts. I his clav is
equivalent to something like the vernal
equinox or Groundhog Day, although

the Stanford version has little to do with
casting shadows or furry animals (let's
hope!).
It's been known to happen, of course,
that one or two sports-bra clad women
will appear sporadically on a sunny day
in late winter quarter. But don't be
fooled. These are false alarms.
I'd like to lake a moment to say that
you don't have to run during spring
quarter if you don't want to. 1 feel this
needs to be said because of the great
amount of running peer pressure out
there. You probably can't count how
many times you've thought to yourself,
"Running hurts tnv knees. 1 never ran
.it all before I came to Stanford. In fact,
I hate running. But it's spring quarter!
Run, I must!"
It doesn't have to be like thai. 1 say,
feel free to find \our own athletic medi
um.
And, on the other hand, if you
haven't run ninth before, and you're a
little self-conscious ol your perfor
mance, not to worry. I'he running spec
trum at Stanford, I have discovered, is
broad.
I ot example — I ran c ross country in
high school. I sucked. I joined in ninth
grade because I didn't know anyone at
my new high school and I thought it
would be a fun way to make friends.
Running was peripheral.
II you're an athlete, you might want
to skip the next few lines of this article
because you hated kids like me. I was
the one who came into the finish line
with breath to spare. I he one who went
straight to the bagels and orange slices
instead of the race scores. I he one who
said, "What's up?" to friends on the rival
team (while running alongside them).
Just so you don't completely despise
me, I cared more about other sports.
But (toss country was always more of an
after school club than a competitive
sport. I'm sure niv old coach would love
to hear that.
But, here at Stanford, people call me
a runner. I ley, I can make it around
(lainpus Loop. Who's a superstar?
That's right, lwen when 1 tell people
that I was on JV for lour years of cross
country, they still consider me a "run
ner." So, go for it. I ley, do it with just a
sports bra (and shorts). You gotta love
spring quarter.
