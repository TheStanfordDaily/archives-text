"An Art Affair" provides much-needed
outlet for the arts
I am writing to recognize the efforts ol
some visionary and hard-working stu
dents who produced an event for the
benefit of the entire Stanford community.
Last Friday, March 31, a newly formed
student group called the Student Orga
nizing Committee for the Arts (SOCA)
produced "An Art Affair." Envisioned
and organized by sophomore Seth Cohen
and a committee of students, the art lair
was completely the creation of students.
Providing an outlet for the arts, some
thing that many students feel is under
recognized and supported at the Univer
sity, is important for a world-class institu
tion such as Stanford. It was wonderful to
finally see such an outlet: one that was
well organized and coordinated, featur
ing some terrific and very creative art and
performances.
Acknowledging the widespread con
cern among students about the lack of
some artistic outlets at Stanford, SOCA
strives to create more of these outlets by
creating new programs and bolstering

those already in place. "An Art Allah " was
a big step in that direction. As not only a
friend ol some of the people organizing
the event, but also as a member of the
Stanford student body, it'made me very
excited to see such an idea come to
fruition in such a successful way.
Friday's "An Ait Affair" is an example
of what's right with Stanford students,
100 often students, plagued by apathy,
complain, but don't do anything about it.
I his group of students serves as a strong
and vivid example to the contrary.
It made me proud to be a Stanford stu
dent on Friday, not only because I again
realized that I am surrounded b\ some
very talented artists, dancers and musi
cians every day, but also because I am
surrounded by some very visionary stu
dents who created something very impor
tant. The students who organized the
daylong fair deserve much recognition
and appreciation for the hard work that
went into produc ing "An Art Affair."
Congratulations to the entire SOCA
organization on a job very well done. I
hope the Stanford community continues
to support the arts and this organization,

1
as well as oilier visionary students who J
come up with an innovative idea and*
make ii a positive success. I know that*
many of my peers and I look forward to«
"An Art Affair" again next year. •

Clarification of graduate housing subsidy
lhe article on the graduate housing!
subsidy in Wednesday's Daily ("$l.B mil-J
lion added to grad housing fund") pro- J
vided a great deal of useful information'
about both the increase in funding for the!
subsidy program next year and the 508!
new studio apartments opening next year J
for graduate students.
1 wanted to clarify two points. The arti- •
cle stated thai furniture would be provid-!
Ed to students who move into the Oak!
Creek and Sharon Green apartments for'
fall quarter. I bis is partially true — we J
will have a small amount of used furni
ture that will be made available (on a first-'
come, first-served basis) to students enter
ing those apartments. We will not, how
ever, he furnishing the apartments direct
ly — this used furniture will simply be
made available to students who may need
it.
1 he article also s;iid that the third site
of the new studio apartments had been
delayed due to problems in the permit
office and with the weather. In lad this
portion of the new construction has
always been scheduled to open in winter
quarter. While there have been some
delays caused In the permit process and
by the winter rains, we still fully expect
that it will open at the beginning of Jan
uary next year, as ii was originallv
planned and scheduled.

University should follow Yale's
lead on commercial notes
Following up on your article on Yale
I niversity s policy against commercial
notes companies ("Yale forces
Versity.com to drop its lecture notes"
March 29), I would like to add a few
observations.
I he recent merger of Stanford's SSL
Lecture Notes service with Versity.com
ensures approved lecture notes at Stan
lord only at the expense of a partnership
with a commercial business that
unashamedly posts unauthorized notes at
many other campuses.
Indeed, with the help of more than
SI 1 million in financing and the college
directed advertising strategies of

l uturel'ages, Yersity.com has for months
now been continuing to interfere in the
educational mission of universities and
colleges across the country.
1 find it hard to believe that Stanlbrd
students and lacult) would want to pre
serve their educational interests at the
expense of those everywhere else where
commercial notes businesses continue
their invasions. However unfortunate it
max be, that is exactly what the SSK-Ver
sitv merger represents.
But, while SSK may continue its
alliance with Versity.com, not onlv Yale,
but Princeton, llarvarad, LCI A, LCI-
Berkeley and other universities have
developed policies to halt the menace of
notes companies. As other universities
and colleges will follow, where will that
leave Stanlbrd?

Consider corporate citizenship
at next Startup Job Fair
Stanford Computer Science students
have a unique opportunit\ that allbrds
us an enormous amount of power: we
can choose where we want to work. I low
ever, the possible uses of this power are
often overlooked. As il stands, the prima
ry use seems to be to get lots and lots of
money.
We are sought after everywhere we
go. Companies hire us away from other
companies. Companies hire us away
from graduate school. Companies occa
sionally hire us away from college! Why
do we go? We sometimes hate to admit it,
but as Dr. Angel Puerta from Red Whale
Software pointed out in a recent Daih
article, often we go because we are
offered a pair of golden handcuffs called
stock options.
We re afraid that the Internet bubble

might burst at any moment, so we want
to t ash in quick. Why do they want us so
badly? Because we possess an extremely
valuable set of skills in an age where com
puters and (Ik- Internet are changing
everything.
M\ question is: why do we let them get
away with it? Isn't there more to life than
just money? Why don't we use our bar
gaining power to get even more? There
are actually a number of things that CIS
gi ads are asking for these days, including
flexible hours, free soda and maybe free
membership to one of those Silicon Val
ley dating services ...
(•ranted, many of these tilings are
valuable as well, but there's something
that's often overlooked: we can ask that
our employer be socially responsible. A
socially responsible company does not
have to be a non-profit. It does not have
to have liberal leanings.
In lact, ii can be a small, exciting, fast
growing startup with an excellent team,
solid venture backing, huge market
potential and that works with tec hnolo
gies that are not onlv the latest but also
some of the most important and just plain
cool. My point is that there are so many
opportunities out there, and we have
such strong bargaining power, that hey,
why not choose a companv for which you
would feel good about working?
So when you interview with those com
panies you talked with at the Startup Job
Fair; when you make internship or job
decisions, try asking questions like: How
is your company socially responsible?
How do you exhibit good corporate citi
zenship? Do you treat your employees
well? Do you recycle? Do you contribute
to schools or charities? Can 1 take time off
once a month to do community service
for a clay? How do your products or ser
vices make the world a better place?
As a senior in the middle of the job
search process, 112 have made it a point to
ask these questions to all potential

employers, and I have often been sur
prised at the results. Some important
companies seem to have overlooked
social responsibility — at times even just
the image of social responsibility — while
others build such values into their basic
corporate mission.
The point is to be aware. I encourage
you to take corporate citizenship into
account when looking for your next job.
It just might help you find that company
that makes you want to jump out of bed
every morning to go to work.

Pro-Choice Public Education Project
ad raised issues
In response to the March 31 full page
ad by The Pro-Choice Public Kducation
Project, some issues need to be
addressed. Yes, it would "suck" if one was
limited to a single person in choosing a
boyfriend or girlfriend. It would be worse
if one had no choice in deciding where to
attend college, who to vote for in an elec
tion or which job otter to accept. But it
would be a far greater travesh if death,
and no other alternative, was forced upon
someone.
This, in fact, did occur to millions of
Jews (and non-Jews) during World War
11, many of whom were condemned by a
simple flic k of the wrist (those deemed
unfit for slave labor were "selected' for
"special treatment" by the motion of a
guard's thumb to the right or left). This
also occurs with every abortion. Death is
forced upon an unborn child, and this
child has absolutely no choice whatsoever
in the matter.
In addition, this ad encourages people
to join PKP "to celebrate." What is there
to celebrate about abortion? The brutal
termination of a pregnancy? The fact that
abortion is so common, with about 1.5

million occuring each year in the U.S.
alone? Kven those who are pro-choice
point out that the processes of c hoosing
an abortion and having an abortion are
extremely traumatic psychologically and
emotionally.
l liis hardly seems to be an event
worth celebrating. Pro-lifers, who stage
vigils on the Roe v. Wade anniversary
and who hold memorial services outside
abortion clinics, seem to have a lot better
understanding of the true nature of abor
tion.
Finally, I find it odd that nowhere in
this ad is the word "abortion" used. In
fact, il the line "if you were pregnant"
were excluded, it would be difficult to tell
what choice this ad would be supporting.
It would almost appear as if the issue of
choice were being separated from the
issue of abortion.
Yet this simply cannot be. The choice
of abortion leads to abortion and
nowhere else. And as long as the term
"pro-choice" refers to the support of a
person's light to choose an abortion, the
two issues will, in fact, be the same issue.

to join PKP "to celebrate." What is there
to celebrate about abortion? The brutal
termination of a pregnancy? The fact that
abortion is so common, with about 1.5

million occuring each year in the U.S.
alone? Kven those who are pro-choice
point out that the processes of c hoosing
an abortion and having an abortion are
extremely traumatic psychologically and
emotionally.
l liis hardly seems to be an event
worth celebrating. Pro-lifers, who stage
vigils on the Roe v. Wade anniversary
and who hold memorial services outside
abortion clinics, seem to have a lot better
understanding of the true nature of abor
tion.
Finally, I find it odd that nowhere in
this ad is the word "abortion" used. In
fact, il the line "if you were pregnant"
were excluded, it would be difficult to tell
what choice this ad would be supporting.
It would almost appear as if the issue of
choice were being separated from the
issue of abortion.
Yet this simply cannot be. The choice
of abortion leads to abortion and
nowhere else. And as long as the term
"pro-choice" refers to the support of a
person's light to choose an abortion, the
two issues will, in fact, be the same issue.

"An Art Affair" provides much-needed
outlet for the arts
I am writing to recognize the efforts ol
some visionary and hard-working stu
dents who produced an event for the
benefit of the entire Stanford community.
Last Friday, March 31, a newly formed
student group called the Student Orga
nizing Committee for the Arts (SOCA)
produced "An Art Affair." Envisioned
and organized by sophomore Seth Cohen
and a committee of students, the art lair
was completely the creation of students.
Providing an outlet for the arts, some
thing that many students feel is under
recognized and supported at the Univer
sity, is important for a world-class institu
tion such as Stanford. It was wonderful to
finally see such an outlet: one that was
well organized and coordinated, featur
ing some terrific and very creative art and
performances.
Acknowledging the widespread con
cern among students about the lack of
some artistic outlets at Stanford, SOCA
strives to create more of these outlets by
creating new programs and bolstering

those already in place. "An Art Allah " was
a big step in that direction. As not only a
friend ol some of the people organizing
the event, but also as a member of the
Stanford student body, it'made me very
excited to see such an idea come to
fruition in such a successful way.
Friday's "An Ait Affair" is an example
of what's right with Stanford students,
100 often students, plagued by apathy,
complain, but don't do anything about it.
I his group of students serves as a strong
and vivid example to the contrary.
It made me proud to be a Stanford stu
dent on Friday, not only because I again
realized that I am surrounded b\ some
very talented artists, dancers and musi
cians every day, but also because I am
surrounded by some very visionary stu
dents who created something very impor
tant. The students who organized the
daylong fair deserve much recognition
and appreciation for the hard work that
went into produc ing "An Art Affair."
Congratulations to the entire SOCA
organization on a job very well done. I
hope the Stanford community continues
to support the arts and this organization,

1
as well as oilier visionary students who J
come up with an innovative idea and*
make ii a positive success. I know that*
many of my peers and I look forward to«
"An Art Affair" again next year. •

Clarification of graduate housing subsidy
lhe article on the graduate housing!

about both the increase in funding for the!
subsidy program next year and the 508!

for graduate students.
1 wanted to clarify two points. The arti- •
cle stated thai furniture would be provid-!

Creek and Sharon Green apartments for'

will have a small amount of used furni

ever, he furnishing the apartments direct
ly — this used furniture will simply be
made available to students who may need
it.
1 he article also s;iid that the third site
of the new studio apartments had been
delayed due to problems in the permit

portion of the new construction has
always been scheduled to open in winter

by the winter rains, we still fully expect
that it will open at the beginning of Jan

University should follow Yale's
lead on commercial notes
Following up on your article on Yale
I niversity s policy against commercial
notes companies ("Yale forces
Versity.com to drop its lecture notes"
March 29), I would like to add a few
observations.
I he recent merger of Stanford's SSL
Lecture Notes service with Versity.com
ensures approved lecture notes at Stan
lord only at the expense of a partnership
with a commercial business that
unashamedly posts unauthorized notes at
many other campuses.
Indeed, with the help of more than
SI 1 million in financing and the college
directed advertising strategies of

l uturel'ages, Yersity.com has for months
now been continuing to interfere in the
educational mission of universities and
colleges across the country.
1 find it hard to believe that Stanlbrd
students and lacult) would want to pre
serve their educational interests at the
expense of those everywhere else where
commercial notes businesses continue
their invasions. However unfortunate it
max be, that is exactly what the SSK-Ver
sitv merger represents.
But, while SSK may continue its
alliance with Versity.com, not onlv Yale,
but Princeton, llarvarad, LCI A, LCI-
Berkeley and other universities have
developed policies to halt the menace of
notes companies. As other universities
and colleges will follow, where will that
leave Stanlbrd?

Consider corporate citizenship
at next Startup Job Fair
Stanford Computer Science students
have a unique opportunit\ that allbrds
us an enormous amount of power: we
can choose where we want to work. I low
ever, the possible uses of this power are
often overlooked. As il stands, the prima
ry use seems to be to get lots and lots of
money.
We are sought after everywhere we
go. Companies hire us away from other
companies. Companies hire us away
from graduate school. Companies occa
sionally hire us away from college! Why
do we go? We sometimes hate to admit it,
but as Dr. Angel Puerta from Red Whale
Software pointed out in a recent Daih
article, often we go because we are
offered a pair of golden handcuffs called
stock options.
We re afraid that the Internet bubble

might burst at any moment, so we want
to t ash in quick. Why do they want us so
badly? Because we possess an extremely
valuable set of skills in an age where com
puters and (Ik- Internet are changing
everything.
M\ question is: why do we let them get
away with it? Isn't there more to life than
just money? Why don't we use our bar
gaining power to get even more? There
are actually a number of things that CIS
gi ads are asking for these days, including
flexible hours, free soda and maybe free
membership to one of those Silicon Val
ley dating services ...
(•ranted, many of these tilings are
valuable as well, but there's something
that's often overlooked: we can ask that
our employer be socially responsible. A
socially responsible company does not
have to be a non-profit. It does not have
to have liberal leanings.
In lact, ii can be a small, exciting, fast
growing startup with an excellent team,
solid venture backing, huge market
potential and that works with tec hnolo
gies that are not onlv the latest but also
some of the most important and just plain
cool. My point is that there are so many
opportunities out there, and we have
such strong bargaining power, that hey,
why not choose a companv for which you
would feel good about working?
So when you interview with those com
panies you talked with at the Startup Job
Fair; when you make internship or job
decisions, try asking questions like: How
is your company socially responsible?
How do you exhibit good corporate citi
zenship? Do you treat your employees
well? Do you recycle? Do you contribute
to schools or charities? Can 1 take time off
once a month to do community service
for a clay? How do your products or ser
vices make the world a better place?
As a senior in the middle of the job
search process, 112 have made it a point to
ask these questions to all potential

employers, and I have often been sur
prised at the results. Some important
companies seem to have overlooked
social responsibility — at times even just
the image of social responsibility — while
others build such values into their basic
corporate mission.
The point is to be aware. I encourage
you to take corporate citizenship into
account when looking for your next job.
It just might help you find that company
that makes you want to jump out of bed
every morning to go to work.

Pro-Choice Public Education Project
ad raised issues
In response to the March 31 full page
ad by The Pro-Choice Public Kducation
Project, some issues need to be
addressed. Yes, it would "suck" if one was
limited to a single person in choosing a
boyfriend or girlfriend. It would be worse
if one had no choice in deciding where to
attend college, who to vote for in an elec
tion or which job otter to accept. But it
would be a far greater travesh if death,
and no other alternative, was forced upon
someone.
This, in fact, did occur to millions of
Jews (and non-Jews) during World War
11, many of whom were condemned by a
simple flic k of the wrist (those deemed
unfit for slave labor were "selected' for
"special treatment" by the motion of a
guard's thumb to the right or left). This
also occurs with every abortion. Death is
forced upon an unborn child, and this
child has absolutely no choice whatsoever
in the matter.
In addition, this ad encourages people
to join PKP "to celebrate." What is there
to celebrate about abortion? The brutal
termination of a pregnancy? The fact that
abortion is so common, with about 1.5

million occuring each year in the U.S.

account when looking for your next job.
It just might help you find that company
that makes you want to jump out of bed
every morning to go to work.

Pro-Choice Public Education Project
ad raised issues
In response to the March 31 full page
ad by The Pro-Choice Public Kducation
Project, some issues need to be
addressed. Yes, it would "suck" if one was
limited to a single person in choosing a
boyfriend or girlfriend. It would be worse
if one had no choice in deciding where to
attend college, who to vote for in an elec
tion or which job otter to accept. But it
would be a far greater travesh if death,
and no other alternative, was forced upon
someone.
This, in fact, did occur to millions of
Jews (and non-Jews) during World War
11, many of whom were condemned by a
simple flic k of the wrist (those deemed
unfit for slave labor were "selected' for
"special treatment" by the motion of a
guard's thumb to the right or left). This
also occurs with every abortion. Death is
forced upon an unborn child, and this
child has absolutely no choice whatsoever
in the matter.
In addition, this ad encourages people
to join PKP "to celebrate." What is there
to celebrate about abortion? The brutal
termination of a pregnancy? The fact that
abortion is so common, with about 1.5

million occuring each year in the U.S.
alone? Kven those who are pro-choice
point out that the processes of c hoosing
an abortion and having an abortion are
extremely traumatic psychologically and
emotionally.
l liis hardly seems to be an event
worth celebrating. Pro-lifers, who stage
vigils on the Roe v. Wade anniversary
and who hold memorial services outside
abortion clinics, seem to have a lot better
understanding of the true nature of abor
tion.
Finally, I find it odd that nowhere in
this ad is the word "abortion" used. In
fact, il the line "if you were pregnant"
were excluded, it would be difficult to tell
what choice this ad would be supporting.
It would almost appear as if the issue of
choice were being separated from the
issue of abortion.
Yet this simply cannot be. The choice
of abortion leads to abortion and
nowhere else. And as long as the term
"pro-choice" refers to the support of a
person's light to choose an abortion, the
two issues will, in fact, be the same issue.
