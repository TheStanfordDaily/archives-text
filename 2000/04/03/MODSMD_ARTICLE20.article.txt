"An Art Affair" provides much-needed
outlet for the arts
I am writing to recognize the efforts ol
some visionary and hard-working stu
dents who produced an event for the
benefit of the entire Stanford community.
Last Friday, March 31, a newly formed
student group called the Student Orga
nizing Committee for the Arts (SOCA)
produced "An Art Affair." Envisioned
and organized by sophomore Seth Cohen
and a committee of students, the art lair
was completely the creation of students.
Providing an outlet for the arts, some
thing that many students feel is under
recognized and supported at the Univer
sity, is important for a world-class institu
tion such as Stanford. It was wonderful to
finally see such an outlet: one that was
well organized and coordinated, featur
ing some terrific and very creative art and
performances.
Acknowledging the widespread con
cern among students about the lack of
some artistic outlets at Stanford, SOCA
strives to create more of these outlets by
creating new programs and bolstering

those already in place. "An Art Allah " was
a big step in that direction. As not only a
friend ol some of the people organizing
the event, but also as a member of the
Stanford student body, it'made me very
excited to see such an idea come to
fruition in such a successful way.
Friday's "An Ait Affair" is an example
of what's right with Stanford students,
100 often students, plagued by apathy,
complain, but don't do anything about it.
I his group of students serves as a strong
and vivid example to the contrary.
It made me proud to be a Stanford stu
dent on Friday, not only because I again
realized that I am surrounded b\ some
very talented artists, dancers and musi
cians every day, but also because I am
surrounded by some very visionary stu
dents who created something very impor
tant. The students who organized the
daylong fair deserve much recognition
and appreciation for the hard work that
went into produc ing "An Art Affair."
Congratulations to the entire SOCA
organization on a job very well done. I
hope the Stanford community continues
to support the arts and this organization,
