from last year's NCAA finalist team, in
cluding three All-Americans. Long
Beach has not had much to stand in its
way all season — until now.
It took a five-game match with the
No. 13 Stanford Cardinal (9-10, 8-8
MPSF) to derail the 49ers (19-3, 13-2),
who seemed to be on an express train to
another NCAA final appearance.
On paper. Long Beach shoulcl've
walked away with the win. 1 he experi
enced 49ers gave up just 20 points to
the young Cardinal squad in its three
game sweep of Stanford in late |anuai \.
And while Stanford was coining oil a
three-match losing streak. Long Beach
came to Maples Pavilion looking lor iis

boasted .55f> and..395 percentages. And
alter game two it looked like Stanford
would be just another victim left in
Long Beac li s clest rue t ive wake.
But in game three Stanford jumped
to a 5-4 lead and never looked back. A
