For true baseball fans, it

And if you happened to be luc k\
enough to follow the Stanford
baseball team down to I'einpe,
Ariz., tor a tlnee-gaine with Ari
zona State, this is what you

pitching in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, and ASI .first in hitting
in the Pat-10. facing off.
And in the end, hitting won
out, as Stanford came up short.
The (Cardinal lost two of the

three games to the Sun Devils,

went the distance for the win as

Junior Jason Young had a rough outing Saturday at Arizona State,
surrendering six runs (five of them earned) on eight hits over six in
nings. Young left the game with a no-decision.
easy to beat the conference's top hitting team, a fact head
coach Mark Marquess knows all too well.
"You can't give them a lot of walks, because they're
going to burn you. They're a good team, and they took
advantage of it, getting a couple of big knocks behind the
wild pitches and hit batsmen," said the Stanford head
coach.
"1 was very impressed with [ASU]. Obviously, they
swing the bats well, but they shut us down, and they got
a little cushion at the end. They played pretty good de
fense and pitched real well against us."
Friday night, however, was Justin Wayne's show. Ari
zona State was only able to bang out two hits, its lowest
hit production since 1989, while Wayne got seven strike
outs.
Meanwhile, on the offensive side, senior third base
man John Gall provided all the offense Stanford would
need with a two-run homer in the first inning over the
second fence at Packard Stadium in left field. The shot
came off of ASU pitcher Jon Switzer, who entered the
game as the top starter on the Sun Devil staff with a 6-0
record and a 2.63 ERA.
"[Switzer] has great control of his fastball... probably
the best control of anyone we've seen all year. 1 was sit
ting on a fastball, he gave it to me, and it went a long
way," Gall said. Gall was easily the Cardinal's best hitter
during the series, going 5 for 1 1 with two home runs and
eight RBIs over the three games.
Senior centerfielder Fdmund Muth added a two-run
homer of his own to right in the sixth inning, also off of
Switzer.
Junior Jason Young, Stanford's "other" ace, made the
start on Saturday in hopes of keeping his teammate's
dominance of ASU going. But Young looked nowhere
near as dominating as Wayne had the night before.
An I 1-minute rain delay interrupted play in the
fourth, after which the sky cleared up and play resumed
without incident for the rest of the game.
In the top of the seventh, Gall smashed a 2-0 offering
from ASU pitcher Franco Pezely over the leh field fence
to put Stanford up 6-4. Gall's home run broke Paul
('.arey's all-time record 0f220 RBIs on the Farm, but the
senior would prefer not to reflect too much on his
achievement.
"[The record] is a great accomplishment, but I don't
think I'll take that much from it until I'm away from
here," Gall said.
After Gall's homer, it was all ASU. Sophomore Jeff
Bruksch, who had pitched well in relief all year, gave up
a pair of two-run homers in 1.1 innings of work to put
the Sun Devils up for good at 9-6. ASU tacked on anoth
er run in the eighth for the final margin of 10-6, as
Bruksch took the loss to put his record at 2-2 and ASU's
Eric Doble got ilie win to improve
his record to 3-1.
. "It was a terrible pitch, and he
did w hat he was supposed to do
with it. I just didn't make good
pitches today, and we got
burned," Bruksch said of the first
homer he gave up, to Jeff Phelps.
Sunday's game began right
where Saturday's left off. Sopho
more Mike Gosling, who earned
the start, walked two hitters in a
row before giving up yet another
gopher ball to give ASU the early
3-0 lead.
Gosling never looked comfort
able on the mound and proved it
by throwing consecutive wild
pitches and eventually loading the
bases. Freshman Tim Gunning
ham came in to pitch and let all
three runners on base score to give
ASU a 6-0 lead. Gounting the last

two innings from Saturday, the
Sun Devils scored three runs in
four consecutive innings against
Gardinal pitching.
Stanford would strike back with
four in the third inning on a two-
RBI single by Gall and a mam
moth two-run homer by junior Joe
Borchard to cut the margin to 6-4.
Stanford's hitters just weren t able
to do much with the Sun Devils
pitching, and another three runs
scored off of sophomore Mike
Wodnicki in the sixth didn't help
matters. ASU eventually won 11-6,
with Gosling taking the loss to
move him to 2-2. Franco Pezely
got the win for ASU.
In the end, this battle turned
out to be no contest — give it easi
ly to .ASU. After playing Sacra
mento State in a nonconference
game Tuesday, the Gardinal
heads up to Pullman, Wash., for
the first time in Marquess' tenure
to face Washington State in what
suddenly is a very crucial series for
Stanford's Pac-10 title hopes.

Junior Jason Young had a rough outing Saturday at Arizona State,
surrendering six runs (five of them earned) on eight hits over six in
nings. Young left the game with a no-decision.
easy to beat the conference's top hitting team, a fact head
coach Mark Marquess knows all too well.
"You can't give them a lot of walks, because they're
going to burn you. They're a good team, and they took
advantage of it, getting a couple of big knocks behind the
wild pitches and hit batsmen," said the Stanford head
coach.
"1 was very impressed with [ASU]. Obviously, they
swing the bats well, but they shut us down, and they got
a little cushion at the end. They played pretty good de
fense and pitched real well against us."
Friday night, however, was Justin Wayne's show. Ari
zona State was only able to bang out two hits, its lowest
hit production since 1989, while Wayne got seven strike
outs.
Meanwhile, on the offensive side, senior third base
man John Gall provided all the offense Stanford would
need with a two-run homer in the first inning over the
second fence at Packard Stadium in left field. The shot
came off of ASU pitcher Jon Switzer, who entered the
game as the top starter on the Sun Devil staff with a 6-0
record and a 2.63 ERA.
"[Switzer] has great control of his fastball... probably
the best control of anyone we've seen all year. 1 was sit
ting on a fastball, he gave it to me, and it went a long
way," Gall said. Gall was easily the Cardinal's best hitter
during the series, going 5 for 1 1 with two home runs and
eight RBIs over the three games.
Senior centerfielder Fdmund Muth added a two-run
homer of his own to right in the sixth inning, also off of
Switzer.
Junior Jason Young, Stanford's "other" ace, made the
start on Saturday in hopes of keeping his teammate's
dominance of ASU going. But Young looked nowhere
near as dominating as Wayne had the night before.
An I 1-minute rain delay interrupted play in the
fourth, after which the sky cleared up and play resumed
without incident for the rest of the game.
In the top of the seventh, Gall smashed a 2-0 offering
from ASU pitcher Franco Pezely over the leh field fence
to put Stanford up 6-4. Gall's home run broke Paul
('.arey's all-time record 0f220 RBIs on the Farm, but the
senior would prefer not to reflect too much on his
achievement.
"[The record] is a great accomplishment, but I don't
think I'll take that much from it until I'm away from
here," Gall said.
After Gall's homer, it was all ASU. Sophomore Jeff
Bruksch, who had pitched well in relief all year, gave up
a pair of two-run homers in 1.1 innings of work to put
the Sun Devils up for good at 9-6. ASU tacked on anoth
er run in the eighth for the final margin of 10-6, as
Bruksch took the loss to put his record at 2-2 and ASU's
Eric Doble got ilie win to improve
his record to 3-1.
. "It was a terrible pitch, and he
did w hat he was supposed to do
with it. I just didn't make good
pitches today, and we got
burned," Bruksch said of the first
homer he gave up, to Jeff Phelps.
Sunday's game began right
where Saturday's left off. Sopho
more Mike Gosling, who earned
the start, walked two hitters in a
row before giving up yet another
gopher ball to give ASU the early
3-0 lead.
Gosling never looked comfort
able on the mound and proved it
by throwing consecutive wild
pitches and eventually loading the
bases. Freshman Tim Gunning
ham came in to pitch and let all
three runners on base score to give
ASU a 6-0 lead. Gounting the last

two innings from Saturday, the
Sun Devils scored three runs in
four consecutive innings against
Gardinal pitching.
Stanford would strike back with
four in the third inning on a two-
RBI single by Gall and a mam
moth two-run homer by junior Joe
Borchard to cut the margin to 6-4.
Stanford's hitters just weren t able
to do much with the Sun Devils
pitching, and another three runs
scored off of sophomore Mike
Wodnicki in the sixth didn't help
matters. ASU eventually won 11-6,
with Gosling taking the loss to
move him to 2-2. Franco Pezely
got the win for ASU.
In the end, this battle turned
out to be no contest — give it easi
ly to .ASU. After playing Sacra
mento State in a nonconference
game Tuesday, the Gardinal
heads up to Pullman, Wash., for
the first time in Marquess' tenure
to face Washington State in what
suddenly is a very crucial series for
Stanford's Pac-10 title hopes.
