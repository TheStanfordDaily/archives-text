Someone please stand up and
veil, "April Fools!"
I lie events that played out this
weekend at the Stanford Soltball
Complex just didn't seem real —
three losses, 1 ( .) scoreless innings,
one slaughter rule.
11l is is not the work that Stan
ford fans have come to expect o!
their No. S solthall team — the
team that brought home the
Campbell / Cartier ( lassie title,
went undefeated at the iMioenix
fiesta Howl and the Red Desert
('.lassie in I tali and won the Sil
ver Division title at the \l( A
Leadolf ("lassie in I'ebruan and
March.
(•ranted, the competition this
weekend was top-notch, unsur
passed in women's collegiate
softball in No. I Washington and

No. I CI. A. But Stanford
lacked the flare, the pride, the
furv that lias carried this team so
far.
One thing was evident as the
Cardinal, now !M)-7 (1-4 Pacific
10 (-on Terence), It'll (>-() to Wash
ington Friday and 1-0 and 8-0 to
I'CLA Satnrda\ and Sunday —
tlu- players rarely appeared to be
having any fun.
Playing under the scorching
weekend heat, the Cardinal had
a difficult time even energizing
it self for the games, let alone ex
ploding w itli the vigor needed to
heat the top national squads.
Friday's game got off on the
wrong foot with a first-inning
three-run homer from Washing
ton's JemiN lopping, her 18th of
the season, off freshman pitcher
Maureen LeC.ocq.


Senior catcher Kellie Wiginton tied for the all-time Stanford hits lead this
weekend at 196.
