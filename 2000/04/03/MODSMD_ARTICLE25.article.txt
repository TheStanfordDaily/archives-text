### EMILY DRESSEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Someone please stand up and
veil, "April Fools!"
I lie events that played out this
weekend at the Stanford Soltball
Complex just didn't seem real —
three losses, 1 ( .) scoreless innings,
one slaughter rule.
11l is is not the work that Stan
ford fans have come to expect o!
their No. S solthall team — the
team that brought home the
Campbell / Cartier ( lassie title,
went undefeated at the iMioenix
fiesta Howl and the Red Desert
('.lassie in I tali and won the Sil
ver Division title at the \l( A
Leadolf ("lassie in I'ebruan and
March.
(•ranted, the competition this
weekend was top-notch, unsur
passed in women's collegiate
softball in No. I Washington and

No. I CI. A. But Stanford
lacked the flare, the pride, the
furv that lias carried this team so
far.
One thing was evident as the
Cardinal, now !M)-7 (1-4 Pacific
10 (-on Terence), It'll (>-() to Wash
ington Friday and 1-0 and 8-0 to
I'CLA Satnrda\ and Sunday —
tlu- players rarely appeared to be
having any fun.
Playing under the scorching
weekend heat, the Cardinal had
a difficult time even energizing
it self for the games, let alone ex
ploding w itli the vigor needed to
heat the top national squads.
Friday's game got off on the
wrong foot with a first-inning
three-run homer from Washing
ton's JemiN lopping, her 18th of
the season, off freshman pitcher
Maureen LeC.ocq.


Senior catcher Kellie Wiginton tied for the all-time Stanford hits lead this
weekend at 196.
After that initial seib.it k, Stan
ford couldn't seem to get into
j4e.11 and capitalize on the five
hits it did scatter to produce even
a single run.
Freshman fori Nyberg took
over mound duties in the second
and picked up the loss.
But the smell of victory
seemed to float through the
bleachers and Stanford dugout
against the Bruins.
On paper, the Cardinal ap
peared to have the upper hand,
out-hitting UCLA 7-5. Unfortu
nately, in the game of Softball,
hits do not equate to runs.
"We outplayed them on Sat
in day," said head coach John
Kittman. "We had loads of op
portunities to score. Some of our
base-running blunders cost us,
but it came down to not being
able to get that clutch hit at the
right time."
I he game was a defensive hat
tic as both teams were held score
less through five innings of play.
Freshman Dana Sorensen
dominated on the mound with
help from her fielders, especial!)
junior |enni Shideler, who had
several phenomenal plays at
t hit (I.
Nyberg replaced Sorensen,
who lias been suffering from a
stiff shoulder, in the sixth. In
that inning, tlie Bruins scored on
a sac rifice fly.
Despite Stanford's seven solid
hits, including a double l>\
sophomore short-stop Robin
Walker, it just could not seem to
ci oss that elusive white plate
know n as home-base.
Ycsterdav's game was not the
prettiest soft ball evei played on
1 Ik- Farm as 1 lie ( .11 clinal l<>st to
the 8111 ins in live innings, falling
\ k tmi to the eight-run slaughter
1 nlc.
"We didn't phi\ 0111 t\ pe of
ball, said Kidman. "It seemed

like things snowballed after the
second inning. We need to do a
better job of fighting back and
not defeating ourselves.
"We just couldn't recover
from Saturday's loss and came
out ver\ flat."
I he third inning was clearly
the low point of the game as
Stanford committed four errors
and allowed four runs on only
one Bruin hit, all with two outs.
Several overthrows and fielding
bobbles sent the opposition
whi/zing around the bases.
In the top of the fourth, the
Bruins tacked two more runs
onto the scoreboard for a total of
eight as Stanford buried itself
deeper and deeper in a hole.
Any glimmers of hope were
quickly squelched as Stanford
managed only one hit against
UCLA's impeccable defense.
Late in the fourth, sophomore
c enterfielder Jessica Mendoza
hit a long fly ball up the center
that screamed "home run", but
UCLA's outfielder snatched it
out of the air on a running catch
right against the fence.
Nyberg pitched the entire
game Sunday with an air of calm
and coolness, despite the score.
"111 the Pac-10 anything can
happen," said Nyberg. "I know
my team is capable of scoring six,
even eight runs in an inning. It's
just a matter of having the ener
gy to do it.
"Fveryone is very disappoint
ed in our pla\, but we play St.
Marx's this week and we need to
foe us 0111 attention on that.
Stanford hopes to be able to
put the events ol the weekend
aside and jump back 011 its win
ning wagon as the team travels to
St. Marv's on I iicsday.
"At this point of the season
you have to dig deep, kittman
said. " I liete is no lime to make
<01 rec 1 ions. 1 1 you're not on
vour \ game even game, the
good teams are going to c apital

Kittman. "We had loads of op
portunities to score. Some of our
base-running blunders cost us,
but it came down to not being
able to get that clutch hit at the
right time."
I he game was a defensive hat
tic as both teams were held score
less through five innings of play.
Freshman Dana Sorensen
dominated on the mound with
help from her fielders, especial!)
junior |enni Shideler, who had
several phenomenal plays at
t hit (I.
Nyberg replaced Sorensen,
who lias been suffering from a
stiff shoulder, in the sixth. In
that inning, tlie Bruins scored on
a sac rifice fly.
Despite Stanford's seven solid
hits, including a double l>\
sophomore short-stop Robin
Walker, it just could not seem to
ci oss that elusive white plate
know n as home-base.
Ycsterdav's game was not the
prettiest soft ball evei played on
1 Ik- Farm as 1 lie ( .11 clinal l<>st to
the 8111 ins in live innings, falling
\ k tmi to the eight-run slaughter
1 nlc.
"We didn't phi\ 0111 t\ pe of
ball, said Kidman. "It seemed

like things snowballed after the
second inning. We need to do a
better job of fighting back and
not defeating ourselves.
"We just couldn't recover
from Saturday's loss and came
out ver\ flat."
I he third inning was clearly
the low point of the game as
Stanford committed four errors
and allowed four runs on only
one Bruin hit, all with two outs.
Several overthrows and fielding
bobbles sent the opposition
whi/zing around the bases.
In the top of the fourth, the
Bruins tacked two more runs
onto the scoreboard for a total of
eight as Stanford buried itself
deeper and deeper in a hole.
Any glimmers of hope were
quickly squelched as Stanford
managed only one hit against
UCLA's impeccable defense.
Late in the fourth, sophomore
c enterfielder Jessica Mendoza
hit a long fly ball up the center
that screamed "home run", but
UCLA's outfielder snatched it
out of the air on a running catch
right against the fence.
Nyberg pitched the entire
game Sunday with an air of calm
and coolness, despite the score.
"111 the Pac-10 anything can
happen," said Nyberg. "I know
my team is capable of scoring six,
even eight runs in an inning. It's
just a matter of having the ener
gy to do it.
"Fveryone is very disappoint
ed in our pla\, but we play St.
Marx's this week and we need to
foe us 0111 attention on that.
Stanford hopes to be able to
put the events ol the weekend
aside and jump back 011 its win
ning wagon as the team travels to
St. Marv's on I iicsday.
"At this point of the season
you have to dig deep, kittman
said. " I liete is no lime to make
<01 rec 1 ions. 1 1 you're not on
vour \ game even game, the
good teams are going to c apital
ize out hat and beat you.
I hat s w hat happened this
