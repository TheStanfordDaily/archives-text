# Arizona schools continue to lose at Stanford
## Cardinal men go perfect on the weekend to continue 44-0 streak 
### SAMEER AHMED STAFF WRITER 
\\ henever a school from Arizona plays Stanford
in men's tennis on the Farm, maybe it should just
forfeit ahead of time instead of facing another well
anticipated embarrassing defeat.
Since the beginning of men's collegiate tennis,
the Cardinal holds an unbelievable 44-0 record at
home against Arizona and Arizona State combined.
1 his weekend, the No. 3 Stanford men's tennis
team (15-0) extended its historical dominance of
the Wildcats and Sun Devils with back-to-back 7-0
wins. I he Cardinal did not lose a match in singles
or doubles all weekend.
However, when Stanford and Arizona began
play on Friday afternoon, things were not looking
so bright for the Cardinal. Ihe team was losing
early in two of the three doubles matches.
Alter trailing 6-4, senior Geoff Abratns and ju
nior Alex Kim, the No. 1 doubles team in the coun
try, battled back to defeat Frenchman Michel Stopa
and Swedish Jean-Noel LaCoste, 8-6. Completeh
dominating the final four games of the match,
Abratns and Kim caused their opponents to scream
obscenities in various foreign languages.
Similarly, sophomore K.j. Hippensteel and
freshman David Martin were down 4-2 to Alex
Brown and Tom Lloyd before winning six of the
last seven games to win the match, 8-5.
After the minor setbacks early in doubles, Stan
ford came back and dominated singles play, win
ning all six matches, four in straight sets.
Kim, ranked third in the nation, outlasted No.
89 Alex Aybar, 6-2, 3-6, 7-5 at No. 1 singles.
Kim played primarily at the No. 4 spot last
year and has made a pretty big jump to become
the top singles player for the (lardinal. I lowever,
with a phenomenal overall record of 30-3, he has
not felt that much pressure playing in such a cru
cial position.
"I try to go out and play every match the same
way," Kim said. "It's definitely an honor to play at
No. 1, but I don't worry about that too much. I've
just worked really hard, and so far it has paid off."
Junior Scotty Scott, who came back to defeat
Stopa, 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, said that the Stanford players
added a little extra effort to rout the Wildcats on
Friday.
"We wanted to beat Arizona badly to make up
for the losses by the basketball team this year," Scott
said.

Perhaps that extra motivation the Cardinal had
on Friday carried over to Saturday when it fined
Arizona Slate. Stanford only dropped one set all
day on its way to another 7-0 victory.
Hippensteel, playing in his third match since
coming back 112 rom a severe case of mononucleosis,
teamed up with Martin to defeat Mitchell liowen
and Matt Klinger, 8-5.
While Hippensteel, the No. I player in the
country at the time of his injury, is still not at lull
strength physically, he continues to improve with
each match he pla\ s.
"1 fell pretty light in the first two matches
(against 1 larvard and Arizona),' I lippensteel said.
"Today (against Arizona State) I finally felt loose. I
really went for mv shots and did what 1 needed lo
win."
Hippensteel wasn't the onh Stanford plaver
who played winning tennis on Saturday. The ( or
dinal swept the singles matches, winning live in
straight sets.
In singles, Scott breezed by Klinger, 6-1, 6-4.
With a 9-3 record in dual matches, Scott's consis
tency and determination .it the No. 3 spot this year

has earned him his first career singles ranking, as
lie jumped into the I I A I op 100 at No. 07.
"1 played a lot over the summer on the profes
sional circuit and realized what I needed to play at
this level," Scott said. "I've tried to have a good at
titude and work hard, and the improvement will
comeb) itself."
