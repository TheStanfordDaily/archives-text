make history this weekend.
Unfortunately, the Cardinal will have to
do so without sophomore two-meter player
Kate Pettit. Pettit broke her hand during

Despite L'SC's 6-3 conference
record, the Trojans are just as

UCLA and Cal.
"All three USC losses were ex
tremely close," Riddell said.
"They are also the returning na

"Next weekend we need to play
five really good games," Gallogly
said. "We cannot let up at any
point, and we also cannot let the
small mistakes that we've been
making come out."
