### ANUJ GUPTA DANA MULHAUSER EDITORIAL STAFF 
ll the Board ol Trustees votes to
approve Provost John i lennessx as
Stanford's 10th president, il will
continue a Stanford tradition of
promoting an internal candidate
to the University's highest posi
tion.
Moreover, Hennessy would be
coining to the position from a fa
miliar stepping stone, I niversitx
Provost.
To get a sense of what the tran
sition from provost to president is
like, The Daily spoke this weekend
with two former University presi
dents, Emeritus History Prof.

Richard I .vman and Biological St i
ences Prof. Donald Kennech. both
of whom occupied the I niversitv's
number-two position at the time
they were named president.
A transition under crisis
Ly man recalled his ascension to
the Stanford presidency in 1970 as
"a period of great c risis in the I ni
versity's histon because ol the vi
olent anti-Vietnam War protests
that were roc king the campus.
Hie job had opened up when
Kenneth Pitzer submitted his res
ignation in June 1970 after less
than two years at the helm. The
war-related turmoil at tire I Diver
sity was respoDsible lor the depar
ture of Pitzer, who had been the
head ol Rice U Diversity before tak
ing the top post at Stanford.
In his resignation letter, l'iizer

wrote, "Trends have made it in
creasingly difficult to obtain t he
very broad and active support
from .ill those groups who togeth
er are responsible lor the well
being of the university."
Four separate committees,
composed of trustees, faculty, stu
<lfiits and alumni, worked to select
I'it/ei s successc >r.
According to Lyman, the com
mittees were under great pressure
to make a decision quickly in ordci
to restore si ;il »i I it \ to the I nivcrsi
ty.
" I he place had been subjec ted
to violence and turmoil ovei and
over again, and there was a great
leeling of urgency and crisis. No
body becoming president could
have been at all sure what he was
up against," he said.
Ly man s.iid he knew that his po
sition .is provost made him the
froni-runnci for the presidency.
"Larlv in the process one ol the
more senior trustees \v;is quoted .is
saying it was Lyman against the
field. I had a fail expectation that
that's what was going to happen."
he said.
Lyman said his "insider" status
at the I Diversity proved invalu
able to his selection.
"It was tough enc>ugh no matter
I iow much you kncv\ to have come
into |(hat situation] cold. Not
knowing any of the plavei s would
have been even more difficult: one
reason why it seemed likely they
would appoint me was simply be
cause I had been there," he said.
"My predecessor who'd had

sue li a hard time caine from out
side. lie never reall) got his feet
under him."
Indeed, Lyman was officially
named Stanford's seventh presi
dent in Sept. I ( .)7(), just in time for
him to speak at freshman convoca
tion to the campus' newest stu
dents.
Lvinan called the selection of a
provost for a university president's
job "a very frequent occurrence,"
saying that such transitions are
even more common today.
" I here is more consciousness
today that you need experience in
management and leadership [to
become a president |," he said.
I .y man also pointed out the im
portant e of selec ting a provost
with presidential potential, saying
this was a key fiic toi in his appoint
ment of Donald Kennedy as
provost.
"It was obvious I had a lot ol
confidence in (Kennedy] 01 else I
wouldn't have appointed him," lie
said.
As a result, Lyman said that
u lien he dec ided to leave Stanford
in 1980 to bee oine president of the
Rorkelcllei Foundation, the tr.ui
sil iou to Kennedy's presidency' was
smooth.
"I lis appointment took plac c in
a more orderly and normal se
quent e," he said.
k A short training runway'
When Lyman retired,
Kennedy , a Stanford biology pro
lessor. had been provost foi only
one yeai. He had returned to Stan
ford in 1 ( .)7 ( .) aftei two and a half
years as coinissioner of the Food

ministrative position at Stanford,
Kennedy said.
"In the government, when yon
say, 'jump,' people say, 'how high?'
I hat doesn't happen here."
I fe acknowledged th.it he "had
a fairly short training runway" as
provost. II he could have treated
.in absolutely ideal situation, he
said, he would have liked a second
year as provost.
Hut I lennessy's situation,
KennecK stressed, is far different
from Kenned) sown.
"John's been a dean [of the
S( liool of Kngineeringl, and that's
a big difference," he said.
When I.Milan announced his
intention to step down in January
1980, it was "widely speculated
that I was under consideration" for
the presidency, Kennedy said.
"The search committee talked
to me fairly early as they would
have talked to any provost," he
added.
Although Kennedy said "I did
my best to put [the speculation] out
ol my head," he admitted that lu
ll.id one major concern about the
(onsequciu es il he were not select

"There was always that uncer

Kennedy s anxiety was short
lived, however; in June, during
Commencement weekend, the
Hoard ol trustees announced him
to be its choice as the I Diversity's

When asked if he ever consid

continue a Stanford tradition of
promoting an internal candidate
to the University's highest posi
tion.
Moreover, Hennessy would be
coining to the position from a fa
miliar stepping stone, I niversitx
Provost.
To get a sense of what the tran
sition from provost to president is
like, The Daily spoke this weekend
with two former University presi
dents, Emeritus History Prof.

Richard I .vman and Biological St i
ences Prof. Donald Kennech. both
of whom occupied the I niversitv's
number-two position at the time
they were named president.
A transition under crisis
Ly man recalled his ascension to
the Stanford presidency in 1970 as
"a period of great c risis in the I ni
versity's histon because ol the vi
olent anti-Vietnam War protests
that were roc king the campus.
Hie job had opened up when
Kenneth Pitzer submitted his res
ignation in June 1970 after less
than two years at the helm. The
war-related turmoil at tire I Diver
sity was respoDsible lor the depar
ture of Pitzer, who had been the
head ol Rice U Diversity before tak
ing the top post at Stanford.
In his resignation letter, l'iizer

wrote, "Trends have made it in
creasingly difficult to obtain t he
very broad and active support
from .ill those groups who togeth
er are responsible lor the well
being of the university."
Four separate committees,
composed of trustees, faculty, stu
<lfiits and alumni, worked to select
I'it/ei s successc >r.
According to Lyman, the com
mittees were under great pressure
to make a decision quickly in ordci
to restore si ;il »i I it \ to the I nivcrsi
ty.
" I he place had been subjec ted
to violence and turmoil ovei and
over again, and there was a great
leeling of urgency and crisis. No
body becoming president could
have been at all sure what he was
up against," he said.
Ly man s.iid he knew that his po
sition .is provost made him the
froni-runnci for the presidency.
"Larlv in the process one ol the
more senior trustees \v;is quoted .is
saying it was Lyman against the
field. I had a fail expectation that
that's what was going to happen."
he said.
Lyman said his "insider" status
at the I Diversity proved invalu
able to his selection.
"It was tough enc>ugh no matter
I iow much you kncv\ to have come
into |(hat situation] cold. Not
knowing any of the plavei s would
have been even more difficult: one
reason why it seemed likely they
would appoint me was simply be
cause I had been there," he said.
"My predecessor who'd had

sue li a hard time caine from out
side. lie never reall) got his feet
under him."
Indeed, Lyman was officially
named Stanford's seventh presi
dent in Sept. I ( .)7(), just in time for
him to speak at freshman convoca
tion to the campus' newest stu
dents.
Lvinan called the selection of a
provost for a university president's
job "a very frequent occurrence,"
saying that such transitions are
even more common today.
" I here is more consciousness
today that you need experience in
management and leadership [to
become a president |," he said.
I .y man also pointed out the im
portant e of selec ting a provost
with presidential potential, saying
this was a key fiic toi in his appoint
ment of Donald Kennedy as
provost.
"It was obvious I had a lot ol
confidence in (Kennedy] 01 else I
wouldn't have appointed him," lie
said.
As a result, Lyman said that
u lien he dec ided to leave Stanford
in 1980 to bee oine president of the
Rorkelcllei Foundation, the tr.ui
sil iou to Kennedy's presidency' was
smooth.
"I lis appointment took plac c in
a more orderly and normal se
quent e," he said.
k A short training runway'
When Lyman retired,
Kennedy , a Stanford biology pro
lessor. had been provost foi only
one yeai. He had returned to Stan
ford in 1 ( .)7 ( .) aftei two and a half
years as coinissioner of the Food
and I)rug Administration.
Working in Washington, I).CI.

was poor preparation for an ad
ministrative position at Stanford,
Kennedy said.
"In the government, when yon
say, 'jump,' people say, 'how high?'
I hat doesn't happen here."
I fe acknowledged th.it he "had
a fairly short training runway" as
provost. II he could have treated
.in absolutely ideal situation, he
said, he would have liked a second
year as provost.
Hut I lennessy's situation,
KennecK stressed, is far different
from Kenned) sown.
"John's been a dean [of the
S( liool of Kngineeringl, and that's
a big difference," he said.
When I.Milan announced his
intention to step down in January
1980, it was "widely speculated
that I was under consideration" for
the presidency, Kennedy said.
"The search committee talked
to me fairly early as they would
have talked to any provost," he
added.
Although Kennedy said "I did
my best to put [the speculation] out
ol my head," he admitted that lu
ll.id one major concern about the
(onsequciu es il he were not select
ed.
"There was always that uncer
tainty of' Would I be as effective [as
provost] with someone else [as
president |Y "he said.
Kennedy s anxiety was short
lived, however; in June, during
Commencement weekend, the
Hoard ol trustees announced him
to be its choice as the I Diversity's
eighth piesident.
When asked if he ever consid
ered turning down the Hoard's
oiler, Kennedy chuckled.
"Not for a New York second,"
he said.
