first ran on May 2b, 1999, when
John Ileniiess\ wis tunned /novost.

Last spring, Provost John
llenness\ was promoted from
dean ol the School ol F.nginccr
ing to provosl. And now it ap
pears that lie will once again
change positions - this time to
the prcsidencx.
From the office he held .is
dean ol engineering he said. "M\
view from 1 (),()()() feet is that Stan
ford has a nniqite marriage of so
cial sciences, humanities, engi
neering, natural sciences and
professional schools and can
grow that inawax toenhanccthat
across the In>ard."
Paced with the transition to
the provost's position last spi ing.
Ilennessx planned to tackle the
increased role of tcchnologv and
the enhancement of education in
last two undergraduate vears.
I he search c<Miunittee that
recommended him for provost
nnanimonsh supported his pro
motion. "I le reached ont to un
dergraduates and people in the
School ol P.ngineei ing, lie's
deeplv committed to teaching, lie

has an interest in Stanford's pro
fessional schools .. . and lie has a
sense ol humor," said Develop

Hennessy as dean
When Mcnnessy lirst arrived on
the I'.u 111, the campus contained
neithei the building in whi( h Ins
dean s office sal not the president
under whom he curiciitlv serves. Ii
was 1 ( .)77, .nid I lenness\ was an as
sistant professor of electrical engi
neering.
Over the next 20 years, he
moved Inn 11 Stanford to the private
sector — founding MIPS — and
back again, becoming! hairol Stan
ford's computer science depart
ment in 1994. In 199(> he was
named dean of the S< 11001 ol Kngi
-1 leering.
"I have had three years to ob
serve John as dean, and I have
found him to be an outstanding
contributoi to I nivcrsit\ endeav
ors," (lasper said last spring.
Colleagues repeatedh compli
inent his problem-solving abilities
and ability to cna< 1 largc-se ale solu
tions.
"lie's got great vision and a
strong creative influence," said
James Plummet , then-chair of'the
Klectrical Kngineet ing Dcpart
ment, who has worked with I len
nessv lor the past 15 years.
I lennessv s legacy as dean fea
tured increased use of tec hnolog) in
the learning environment. I ndci
his auspices, the school ollered its
lirst online degree program, a mas
ter's in electrical engineering, and
increasingly ottered online (lasses.
"lie has helped us transition
from a distance education operation
that centered around television
broadcasts to one that inc reasinglv
uses the Internet as its delivers
medium," said |eff Kosefi, cliaii ol
the Civil Kngineering Department.
"He may not have pioneered the

conc ept ol distance education, but
lie is taking it to another level."
I lennessv views tec hnologv as a
leai ning tool. " lee hnologv is a wav
we can reach out to students," I len
nessv said. "1 teach tnv classes on

Issues he faced
I lennessv inherited several hot
huiion issues upon becoming
pr< »v<>st. siic 11 as the vv idespi ea<l dis
content with the hiring and tenure
1 ales < >1 minoi iiies and \\(mien.
before assuming the Provost's
(>f 1 ice. I lennessv ac kll< >wlcelged the
hiring prohlein, saving, "we solve 11
bv out reach, bv being extrenielv ag
gressive in rec 1 lining."
As a model he pointed to the
S( 11001 ol Kngineering, v\ hie Ii hired
loin tenure-track women in 199 N.
In one instance, "we had two c andi
dates ill.ll were ( lose, a man and a
woman, and the scan h committee'
was split. I said. I his isn't a prob
lem; ii s an oppoi(unity,' and the
woman was hired.
Vice Provost for Paeultv Rela
tions Robert Weisbcrg called I len
nessv s hiiiug record "a model for
the I niversiiv What lie's clone in
engineering is what 11 hinianities
and Sciences] has luen trying to
do."
I lennessv believes that the I Di
versity's tenure issues should be
solved by methods other than allir
inative ae lion.
"We haven't clone .1 good job
eoinniunii ating with junior family,
counseling them to do the best pos
sible job to get tenure," he said.
" I hat means saving the bad things
to them, not jtisi the good things. II
someone's teaching is not so good,
tell tlietn lo improve it.
"Sometimes students feel pas
sionately about .1 good teacher, but
the tough realization that lacult)
members need lo make is that
llcnure is| a lifetime dec ision. It's a
difference 111 pel spec live."
Building crunch
Anothci problem that I lennessv
laced was the lac k of housing for fae -

nil) and graduate students. Hous
ing prites in Santa ('.lat a county are
among the highest in the nation,
and a number oi departments have
complained that lack <>l housing has
hampered their abilitv to recruit fac
ulty.
"There's not enough housing,
pel iod," Weisberg said. "It's one of
the two pritnarv ol'istacles to easy
1 taciill\ ] recruitment," tlie other ob
stacle being finding employment for
the fat iill \ nieniber's spouse.
I lennesss t ailed housing "possi
!)l\ Stanford's biggest problem."
"1! we don't solve the faculty
housing problem, it will be a major
problem for Stanford going for
ward. We need to view on-catnpus
housing as.in asset. We need that as
a sci of resources to bring in faculty."
I le fin ed a second housing prob
lem in the lac knf available spaces for
graduate students.
" 1 "hat's aci isis that snuck up on
us." he said. "I've seen students hav
ing to gel part-time jobs, which ad
ditional hurls us, because it slows
d<>\\ n graduation rates."
I lenncssv commended Casper
.ind former Provost Condoleezza
Rice's "(|iiick action" in pledging to
build more graduate housing and
doesn't rule out plans lor more con
strue lion.
"II we need more, we'll build
more," he said.
Norton said housing is part of a
larger problem of a lack of student
spate thai I lennessy must confront.
" 112 ilings like housing space, ac
tivity spate, recreational space,
parking, are all interconnected, and
lhe\'re all ever-present issues," she
said.
()nc of 1 lennessy's greatest puz
zles in \ iewing the building issue has
been the surrounding community's
hostile attitude toward Stanford
and its building practices.
Stanford's land-use proposal in
troduced last tall will govern the use
of Stanford lands for the next 10
vears; tile proposal has resulted in a
number of public forums, allowing
residents of Palo Alto and Menlo
Park to N'oice their concert is.
I lennessy said last year that he
was surprised by the level of com
munity anger. "Boy, it really sur
prises me," he said. "If Stanford
hadn't been here, we'd be driving
down Kl (iamino through the plum
trees. I he price of being the most
high-tech region in the world is ur

banization."
New projects
I lennessy's plans for the Univer
sity when he assumed the role of
Provost included increased empha
sis on the last two undergraduate
years and a new biotechnology insti
tute.
"We've done more in a short pe
riod to change the first two years of
college than an\' comparable institu
tion," he said. Changes in tell lasta
several years have included launch
ing Stanford Introductory Studies,
which offers seminars to freshmen
and sophomores, and the creation
of Sophoinctie ( ollege.
"I'd like it) do more to enhance
the in-depth experience of the next
two years, encouraging more stu
dents to tit) honors research," he
said.
As a model I lennessy pointed to
a new environmental engineering
program for 'i0 undergraduates to
conduct summer research.
Bio-X
I lennessy's biggest new plan, tine
on which he worked as the clean of
the engineering, is the biotechnolo
gy institute referred to as Bio-X.
"It involves 11 lumanitiesand Sci
ences], the Medical School and the
School of Engineering," he said.
"It's an interdisciplinary program
that will conduct research and build
curricula."
In February 2000, Hennessy
helped secure Netscape founder
Jim Clark's $150-niillion donation
it) Stanford, the largest in the Uni
versity's history.
The gilt funds the Bio-X pro
gram, providing a huge financial
boost loan institution which is still in
its infancy.
"Bio-X was a grass-roots eflbrt
that came from the faculty. This ef
fort started literally only a little more
than a year ago," saitl Biochemistry
Prof. |im Spudich, who heads the
Hit »-X steering committee.
Bio-X seeks to incorporate re
search on biology and medicine
with other efforts in the fields ol en
gineering, chemistry and physics.
Hennessy says the program builds
on the "notion of biology becoming
this foundational science for lots of
different disciplines" in the near fu
ture.

The $150 million will fund the
creation of new, endowed profes
sorships in die departments in
volved in Bio-X and the construc
tion of a large new center to house
the program, to he named the
James 11. (Mark ('.enter lor Biomed
ical Engineering and Sciences.
1 he Bio-X project has the enthu
siastic support of Hennessv's col
leagues. "Bio-X will he a project that
will hear fruition lor the next sever
al dec ades," I'lummer said.
An engineer takes the reins
When faced with assuming the
role of provost, Hennessy empha
sized how important it would he for
him to communicate well with col
leagues in the School of 1 lu inanities
and Sciences, many of whom are
dissatisfied by the I niversity's per
ceived lack of attention to their
fields.
'Tin going to spend the next
year understanding why my hit
nianitiescolleagues feel the way they
do." he said. I his will likely be an
ongoing concern as he assumes the
University's highest position.
112 inding out c< >1 leagues' concerns
is not a new process for I lennessv.
"When 1 first became dean, 1 vis
ited all 200 faculty," he said. I le ac
knowledged that the proc ess would
be impossible to repeat as provost
but promised to keep in close con
tact with all areas of the University.
I ie also tried to quell fears that an
engineer provost would overem
phasize tec hnology at the expense
of traditional learning. While tech
nology can be an asset, he said, "it's
not something you force fit."
Before Hennessey became
provost, Weisberg said lie believed
that having an engineer at the helm
would be useful in fin ing tough is
sues.
"Engineers are good at looking
at factual data and drawing logical
conclusions," he said.
According to koseff, that de
scription fits Hennessy perfectly.
"John believes strongly in the engi
neering approach to solving prob
lems," Koseff said.
"He will bring this approach to
bear in dealing with issues such as
housing and I he tenure prcx ess."
