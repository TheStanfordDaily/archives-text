Statifoi'd must pay $54"),000 in puniiive
and compensatory damages to former med
ical school researcher Colleen (rangle, a
jury ruled on Thursday.
Alter an eight-day trial in San Jose, the
jury upheld (Tangle's claim that she was

fired in retaliation loi her complaints of gen
der discrimination.
(Wangle is also among a group of '.V2
women and minoritx men who brought a
complaint to the I S. Department of Libor
against Stanford in February claiming dis
crimination. l he complaints are current!)
being investigated In the Fabor Depart
ment. Stanford could lose $500 million in

federal grants and contracts if the Depart
ment of I.abor finds evidence of ongoing
discrimination.
(bangle's case is the first relating to gen
der discrimination at Stanford that has ever
gone to trial.
But Judge James Ware eliminated the
issue of gender bias from the trial on the
grounds that there was no evidence of gen

der dis( rimination. I bis trial was to decide
onl\ il (rangle had been lired in retaliation
lor her complaints.
lhe four-man, four-woman jur\ decid
ed unanimously in lavorof (rangle. I bex
awarded ( rangle $300,000, the maximum
amount for punitive and coinpensatoi \
damages in a retaliation cast.', and an addi
tional $245,000 in compensation for lost

salan and benefits.
C.rangle wits lircd from 11ic* Medical
School in l ( .) ( .)7. While she was al the L ni
versiiy, ( t angle complained ol gender dis
crimination to her boss. Assoc. Medical
School Dean Kdward Shortlilfe. She
( I.timed that shi' was lorced to he suhordi-
nate to a fellow male researcher.
Stanford countered her claim by
pointing out that four other male
researchers were fired at the same
time and for the same reason the
University claimed Grangle was
fired: lack of funding. Before firing
her, Stanford offered Crangle an al
ternate position, which she de
dined.
However, Crangle claimed that
she had several other projects
which were to be funded for at least
another year, even if the University
could not afford to fund that one
particular project.
According to Stanford acting
general counsel Debra Zumwalt,
"She understood her appointment
was only good as long as there was
funding... just because someone
was laid off doesn't mean there was
disc rimination involved."
Stanford plans to appeal the case
on the grounds that, "the court
made mistakes, both in letting in
certain evidence and in not letting
in other evidence," said Zumwalt.
She argued that the trial concen
trated on the sexual discrimination
issues rather than on retaliation.
Zumwalt claimed that the judge
unfairly allowed evidence about
sexual bias at Stanford Medical
('-enter, such as testimony by Neu
rosurgery Piof. Frances Conley.
According to Zumwalt, the judge
prevented the defense from coun
tering this testimony or informing
the jury that the discrimination
issue had no bearing on this case.
"We believe that it was an error
to admit certain prejudicial and
fundamentally irrelevant evi
dence," Zumwalt said.
Stanford attorney Mike Lucey
told the San Jose Mercury News,
"We think Dr. Conley's [testimony]
was highly inflammatory and prej
udicial."
Crangle told the San Francisco
Chronicle she was "elated" by the
verdict.
"But this case is not just about
me, but about a lot of women and
people of color who have been dis
criminated against by Stanford,"
she added.
(Irangle is currently working on
artificial intelligence projects.
