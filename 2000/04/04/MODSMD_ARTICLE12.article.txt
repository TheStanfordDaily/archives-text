## 
### UDARA FERNANDO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
()\t r two dozen student loaders from Hong
Kong, Japan, Korea, Singapore and Stanford I ni
versitv will participate in live first-ever Asia / Pacific
Student Kiltrepreneurship Summit at Stanford
April 4 to 9.
1 lie Stanford Society of Asian American Kngi
neers organized the summit to initiate trans-Pacific
student cooperation on entrepreneurship.
I lie 21 Asian delegates were selected as repre
sentatives of student business and entrepreneur
ship organizations at their universities. I he orga
nizers invited no more than live delegates per coun
try.
Ihe international delegates include students
from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and
l echnologv, the National I 'Diversity of Singapore,
the I niversiiv of I long Kong and the I Diversity of
I <>kv<>.
I lie summit aims to take the technological and

entrepreneurial spirit of Stanford and Silicon Val
ley into Asia, as well as to introduce Silicon Valle\ to
the Asian entrepreneurial climate. "ASKS re
all\ is au opportunity for entrepreneurs in Asia and
the Valley to share the best practices in entrepre
neurship with each other," said sophomore Jon
Wu, director of marketing and communications for
the summit.
I'he summit fosters the belief that knowledge ol
the Asian business environment is invaluable to cur
rent and lulure Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.
"Virtually every Fortune 500 company has an
.Asia/ I'ac ilie strategy." Wu notes. "There are 3.3 bil
lion individuals in Asia, and as the purchasing
power of these individuals grows with the develop
ment ol t lie Asian economy, companies will increas
ingly see most of their growth coming from this re
gion."
Hut the Asian entrepreneurial model has been
largely conservative so far. "In Asia, there tends to
be a stigma against failure, against risk
taking," said Kaiherine Barr, a graduate
student in East Asian Studies and pro
gram coordinator for the summit. "In
japan and Korea, for example, there's
the tradition of lifetime employment,
where new graduates enter a linn and
work there for the rest oltheir lives."
"Many of the incoming Asian dele
gates are already pioneers in breaking
out of this traditional model," continued
Barr. Almost all are interested in becom
ing entrepreneurs, and some are slatt
ing their own companies.
During the summit, delegates will
learn about the history of Silicon Valley
and the role that Stanford has played in
its development. Asian delegates will also
visit leading Valley companies and firms,
including Yahoo!, garage.com, i-K.scrow,
Wilson Sonsini (Goodrich X; Rosati and
International Business Inc übator.
Throughout the course of the sum
mit, delegates will become familial with

the business practices of Silicon Valley,
with a locus on how to go from having a
business plan to actually creating a start
ll P-
"We're particularly pleased to have
Guy Kawasaki, ( TO of garage.com and
author of Rules for Revolutionaries,
speaking to the delegates on innovation
and entreprcneurship," said junior
David Bninner, .1 director of the sum
mit.
One highlight is the "Entrepreneur
sliip in Asia" Seminar, on April 7, to be
held front 2 to I p.m. in the Asia-Pacific
Scholars seminar room of Kncina Hall.
I he Asian delegates will each present an
overview of entrepreneurship and busi
ness development in their respective na
tions, focusing on differences they have
noted with the Silicon Valley model.
A panel of Silicon Valley experts will
respond to those presentations. Kxperts
