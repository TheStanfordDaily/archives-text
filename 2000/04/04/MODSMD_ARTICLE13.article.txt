## Judge rules against Microsoft Corp. in antitrust suit 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge vester
day dealt a momentous legal setback to software
giant Microsoft Corp., ruling the company violated
federal antitrust laws In building a monopoh and
trying to take over the Web browser market.
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penlield Jackson
ruled that Microsoft violated the Sherman Antitrust
Act by "unlawfully tving its Web browser to its oper
ating system" and also could be sued under state anti
competition laws.
The company immediately said it would appeal.
"Microsoft has been held accountable for its illegal
conduct by a court of law," said Attorney General
Janet Reno. I lie dec ision will benefit consumers and
stimulate innovation, added Assistant Attorney Gen
eral Joel I. Klein.
Tiie judgment sets up a new round of hearings to
determine what punishment to impose 011 Microsoft,
including the question of whether the huge compam
founded by Bill Gates should be broken up.
"Innovation will continue to be the No. 1 priority
at Microsoft," Gates said in a statement released by
the company. "While we did everything we could to
settle this case, and will continue to look for new
opportunities to resolve it without further litigation,
we believe we have a strong c ase on appeal."
Rather than hurting competition, he said, "the
high-technology industry that Microsoft has helped
create has unleashed a wave ol competition and inno
vation that has led to new, more powerful products
for consumers, at lower prices than ever before.
I he judge accepted 2.S of 26 arguments brought

forth In the slates thai joined the federal government
in the case.
Ihroiigliont the trial, the judge had strong!)
urged both sides in the case to reach an out-of-court
settlement. I hose talks collapsed over the weekend,
however, prompting Jackson to issue his ruling
todav. Both sides had reasons to settle the case.
Among them: to avoid an appeals process that would
likeh keep the case in court for several years.
I lie judge's ruling had been expected to go
against Microsoft based on harsh assessments he out
lined last November in his "findings of fact." In that
document, Jackson found that Microsoft repeatedly
engaged in anticompetitive behavior by taking
advantage of its monopoly power.
Microsoft stock was battered during trading yes
terday, losing about 15 percent of its value.
Sources familiar with the failed talks, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said on Sunday that negoti
ations in Chicago collapsed after the company insist
ed on its own proposal to settle the lawsuit and not
because of disputes between the state and federal
plaintiffs.
Kven before the states made new proposals Fri
day, "It was clear Microsoft was rejecting the govern
ment's proposal and insisting on their own
approach," one source said. " That approach had a
lot of loopholes and would not have been effective."
Microsoft Chairman Cates contended Saturday
that "it became impossible to settle because the
Department of Justice and the states were not work
ing together."
