port yesterday after a stroke, leav -
ing the Japanese government to
grapple with a leadership crisis

sor to Obuc hi.

speculation was rife that his illness
could plunge Japanese politics
into turmoil while the country is

network quoted unidentified doc

rapidly, and Aoki announced on
yesterday that Obuchi had suf
fered a stroke and was in a coma.
He was put on a respirator. Mis
wife, Chi/uko, was reportedh at
his side.
Aoki is seen as well-connected
in the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party. However, parts leaders

were expec ted to look elsewhere
for a nominee to replace ()buc hi.
Whoever is selected would like
l\ win the approval of parliame nt,

Elections must be held by ()cto
ber at the latest, and ()buchi's hos
pitalization was likeh to fuel an
opposition drive to dissolve parlia

appointment of a stopgap prime
minister from the ruling coalition
ranks, said Shigenori Oka/.aki, a

early election." lie said. " I his rais
es the possibilitv of a lower-house
election even before the G-N."

in Japanese media reports as pos
sible 1 successors were 112 oreign Min
