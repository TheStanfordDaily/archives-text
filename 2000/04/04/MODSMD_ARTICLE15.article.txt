# Uganda murders unnoticed due to cult secrecy

### 
RUGAZI, Uganda (AP) — Sound carries
easily from the village to the lop of the hill, to
the place where an excommunicated priest
exhorted followers to await the apocalypse,
and where later two hidden graves disgorged
over 150 rotting corpses.
I he hilltop compound can be seen from
homes, Irom schools, from the village clink . A
week alter the bodies were discovered, the
choking stench of decaying flesh still tills the
air.
Today, everyone in Rugazi knows what
happened where the people tlie\ tailed "the
visionaries" gathered.
But after hundreds of bodies were found
here and at similar spots across the lush hills ol
southwestern Uganda, the question remains:
How could so many people not see what was
happening in their midst?
It's a question they ask with special urgency
in Rugazi.
"How this could happen without anyone
else's knowledge?" demanded Deos Bagomba,
head catechism teacher at the Roman Catholic
church just in front of the compound built by
excommunicated parish priest Dominic
Kataribabo. "I'm still asking people."

I here are a few explanations: (lull mem
bers and villagers lived side-by-side but were
still divided: hundreds of cult followers came
and went at odd hours; cult leaders knew how
to stop officials from probing too c losely.
And there was a silent fear: Maybe, just
maybe, the cult leaders had powers that would
make it better to steer clear of them.
Kvervone here, however, insists they had no
idea there were corpses buried at kalaribabo's
compound, where followers of the Movement
for tlu- Restoration of the len Command
ments of God often gathered for prayers, and
where 155 of their bodies were discovered.
"We didn't know anything about the
killing," said Amos Agaba, a 21-year-old
mechanic who lives nearby, and who walked
up one clay recently to look at the now-aban
doned site. "We heard no sounds."
The same words are repeated in Buhonga
and Rushojwa, two other southwestern villages
where mass graves were found. Including a
fire at another cult compound, in Kanungu —
a lire that police say killed about 530 people
and set off the investigation that led to the dis
covery of the mass graves — at least 924 peo
ple are believed to have perished in all.

kataribabo is believed anions I lie dead in

Others, including the two lop leaders, are

More than anvihing.' 11 u.is the cult s isola
