Al) VOC AT IN G G U N C() NT R() I.i n
I lie interest of public health and
safety, Stanford History professors
David Kennedy and Jack Rakove
signed a letter run as an ad in I lie New York
limes last week and directed toward Nation
al Rifle Association President Charlton lies
ton and N RA policies.
The letter endorses allegations that I lesion
and the NRA have misled the public by claim
ing that the Second Amendment upholds the
light of individuals to own guns. Those who
signed the letter argue in part that the Sec
ond Amendment refers to the rights of mili
tias and"the people" as a whole and not to
the rights of individual citizens.
The letter w;is written in response to the

ad placed by the San Francisco-based Legal
Community Against Violence which initially
attacked I leston.
More than merely publicizing a particular
interpretation of the Second Amendment,
however, the letter and the LVAC ad have
infused some common sense into the ongo
ing debate over what the Second Amend
ment actually "allows."
By suggesting that the Second Amend
ment is not an impediment to sensible gun
regulation based on concerns for public safe
ty, the scholars who signed the ad re-alfirmed
that the kind of gun violence that has
plagued the U.S. is too high a price for the
public to pay for a libertarian reading of this
part of the (constitution.

Interpretations produce particular conse
quences, and it is those consequences that
should weigh heavily in choosing among rival
interpretations.
Moreover, these kinds of controversies
over "the correct" interpretation of the Con
stitution will continue indefinitely, so we must
move beyond the semantics of the Second
Amendment into an assessment of the issues
that have brought us to this point in our his
tory â€” namely, gun violence.
It is nothing short of a national shame that
the debate over the wording of the Second
Amendment has given the NRA the thin veil
of legitimacy to hijack legislative efforts at
securing the common good.
The blame, however, is misplaced. It is not

the scholarly debates over the meanings of
various clauses that have ensured that the
NRA gets what it pays for. By and large,
respectable scholars reject the purely libertar
ian reading of the Second Amendment as
simplistic anyway.
Fhe larger problem is the indisputable
connection between money and politics. The
ad and letter endorsed by scholars are com
mendable steps toward restoring common
sense to the gun control debate.
Yet, that it takes an expensive ad signed by
top scholars to counteract big-money
parochialism is just further evidence that the
current political system needs a good deal of
fixing, particularly in the area of major issues,
like this, that concern the common good.
