# FARM LIFE
## Ah, Stanford students! 
### 
Lile is tough when I'm late for
(lass and have to drive my BMW
soli-top (red, of course) at sixty
miles per hour down Santa
Teresa, only to find that there is no park
ing among the other sports cars and
SI Vs. It means I have to make my own
spot in the middle ol Iressider some
where blocking an intersection.
I hose whiny commuters who come
from San Francisco or the Kast Bay; why
do they always complain — they don't
have to get to ( lass in three minutes, do

they? What do they
expect me to do —
bike? That's foi the lil
tle people.
I tell you, I suflei
enough with the food I
have to eat here. A full
salad bar, sandwiches,
hot and cold daily pre
pared food, but, man,
it is so fattening and

bland. 1 heard people are actually really
hungry just a lew miles away, but, seri
ously, beet stroganofl again? What gives?
Where's my fbie gras and herb-erusted
salmon? At the very least, a line grilled
steak with caper sauce. Surely, University
dining lor <>nl\ $l!l,()()() ran handle that.
I really don't like anyone who's not a
student here either. I hey're always so
w'hiny, throwing ine smug looks all the
time From stall to faculty, from book
store worker to janitor, they always are
just so mean to me.
I mean, I pay all this money — I
deserve some respect. They are here for
me. I deserve to get A s no matter what,
and m\ bathroom cleaned without delay.
Seriously, I am just so special and
amazing — blessed with such a brilliant
mind and humbling modesty. Should I
be treated any other way? After all, now
that I've left home and am part of the
Real World, why should the constant ser
vicing and indulgences stop?
1 mean, all they do is make sure the
entire I Diversity is in working order so
that I can get my partying and some
learning done as smoothly as possible.
That can't be very difficult.
For example, the few times I actually
do lowei myself to ride a bike anywhere
— how any Stanford student can bear it
I'll never know — all these non-students
do is complain, complain, complain. I
bike too last. 1 cut them off, I don't look,
I'm on the sidewalk. Waa, waa, waa.
I simply wave my hand nonchalantly
through the air and return their smug
looks. Such cheekiness really should not
be tolerated from them; where are their
superiors — they should be informed of

111 is. Students need to come together and
hold .1 rally in White I 'la/a to get some
thing done about this. Wine and cheese
(only the best from the 1993 series
Chateau Beaumont Beaujolais and triple
ci eme brie) will be served of course.
Knough of this "activism" on campus. 1
mean, win save the redwoods or tree
some guy somewhere on the other side ol
the world when the super unleaded gas
lor m\ friend's Alia Romeo is costing him
$2.70 per gallon (lull service) and I don't
have anywhere to park?
Seriously, pave over the whole gad
dang foothills — it'd be better for every
one involved. I always thought Palo Alto
needed more parking, restaurants, and
expensive shops. I hings need to change
here lirst before we won v about anything
anywhere else. Besides, if it's not aliening
me, ii can't be very worthwhile. Why on
earth would I ever think beyond in\seH?
We Stanford students are just so mis
understood l>\ everyone else. We work so
hard at getting our perfect tans and bti//,
and making sure evervthing is all good
with ourselves and close circle of friends.
Kveryone paints ns as unthinking idiots
who are out-of-louch and don't care
about anything unrelated to ourselves.
Do they have to eat the food we have
to eat, be subject to the incessant social
and academic pressures, and experience
life away from home for the first time?
I lie adjustment is traumatic; thank good
ness for therapy at only $90 an hour.
To all who simply accuse (accuse,
accuse) my fellow students and me of
being spoiled rotten countrv-c tub-bound
idiots, without thinking, imagine having
problems like mine. Though, who's to say
— trying to think about things from the
other person's perspective is so passe.
Now, before this gets out of hand,
here's a complex term we learned in
Writing and Critical Thinking (thinking!
— see, we even have a freshman c lass in
it!) — the word "satire," from Webster's.
"Satire: the use of irony, sarcasm, or
ridicule in exposing, denouncing, or
deriding vice or other human folly."
I say! As if our behavior is anything as
such. Maybe there's a little truth to every
thing — but on both sides. Where is the
common ground? I'm not sure anyone is
really looking for it yet, but it's something
for us all to think about before we try to
put each other down. Pettiness really gets
us nowhere.

cyberspace at cmaloney@leland. I'lease be
careful and remember the old truism that eveiy
thing you read needn't be taken at face value;
imagine how boring reading would be.
