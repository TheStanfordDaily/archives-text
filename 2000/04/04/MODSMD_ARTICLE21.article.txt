Daily misrepresents student, fraternity
Last week, the African / African-Amer
ican community experienced blatant
racism via an electronic mail message
crafted by an ignorant individual who
took the time to make sure he could not
be traced. In response,The Daily decided
to cover this issue with a story ("Another
racist e-mail hits campus") published
Wednesday, March 29. I he editor who
wrote the story partially used my com
ments obtained from our interview. I
have never been so disappointed as with
the quality of journalism that The Daily
demonstrated in that article.
Although I understand that The Daily
could not use every bit of my verbiage, it
would have been appreciated if The Daily
were more meticulous with its selection.
I he Daily embarrassed me by taking my
comments completely out of context and
making me look like a militant African-
American with nothing of substance to
offer to combat a highly controversial and
sensitive issue within my community.
Furthermore, The Daily inaccurately
portrayed my organization, Alpha Phi

Alpha Fraternity, Incorporated, Nu
Sigma Chapter, in the same article, as
well as in a photograph published Friday,
March 31. Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity,
Incorporated, was not announcing
"upcoming rush events." No information
about "rush" events was publicized in any
of those e-mails regarding our week. In
fact, Alpha Phi Alpha is not a part of the
IFC; we are a part of the African-Ameri
can Fraternal & Sororal Association
(AAFSA), the equivalent of the National
Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) at most
schools.
AAFSA does not choose to publicize
"rush" events. The photograph of the
Alphas, barely noticeable, had an inaccu
rate caption. First, one member's name
was spelled incorrectly. Second, Golden
Vision Awards were given to BIACK
MALES who have made positive contri
butions to the Stanford community, not
to members of the fraternity; otherwise,
we would have awarded ourselves.
I strongly urge The Daily to be more
careful and accurate when publishing
articles, especially when dealing with
issues that have the potential to cause a

sensitive reaction within a particular com
munity.

Post Office hinders Census 2000?
Be counted. That's the motto for the
2000 Census. And who wouldn't want to
be? I found it fascinating that the Census
recruiters in White Plaza last Tuesday
reported that Stanford was very under
represented in the Census 10 years ago.
As I wandered back to my residence, I
couldn't help but wonder why Stanford
students and faculty — some of the finest
minds in our great nation and probably at
least as responsible as the average Tom,
Dick, or Harry — would choose not to send
in their Census forms and be counted.
And then it hit me. Perhaps it is not
that people are choosing not to mail in
their forms, but rather that they never
received their forms in the first place.
W itli the recent discarding of so-called
"bulk mail at the Stanford post office, it
wouldn't surprise me in the least if many
students and faculty members never see a
2000 Census form. I certainly haven't yet
and, frankly, 1 don't really expect to.
If you think 1 am being unfair in my
criticism of the post office, think again,
l he delivery of mail during the political
primary season was abominable! Many
people did not receive their absentee bal
lots in time to vote in their home states,
and others failed to get crucial voting
information booklets in their mailboxes
prior to the California primary.
Participating in the Census, like voting

in a primary election, is a right and not a
privilege. The post office took the right to
vote away from many through its painful
ly slow delivery, loss, and illegal discard
ing of mail. Let's make sure that doesn't
happen again with the Census. I, for one,
would like to be counted.

School vouchers wrongfully criticized
lo say that school vouchers are not
about school choice is to hide behind unin
formed rhetoric ("School choice not
'choice' for poor," March 28). The whole
point of school vouchers is to break the
public school system's monopolistic stran
glehold on our education tax dollars. If
parents do not like the education that their
children are receiving, they deserve the

choice to spend their nionc) elsewhere.
The objections that kattina Pert tula
raises to the voucher svstem include the
possibility that parents of poor students
"may not be involved or tare about [the
students'] education, or even speak
English competently enough to under
stand their rights."
Tragically, the school system will never
be able to fully reined) the problems of
neglected children. However, by intro
ducing competition into the svstein (and
thus compelling the worst public schools
to improve), we strive to at least improve
the quality of education at these schools.
Secondly, it is incredibly insulting to
suggest that parents who do not speak
English will not understand theii educa
tional rights. Non-English speaking par
ents want the best for their children as
much as you and I, and, in spile ol teach
ers unions' rhetoric to the- contrary, thou
sands of minority families in poor neigh

borhoods have ALREADY benefited
from voucher programs.
In fact, almost without exception,
these programs have long waiting lisis of
poor families looking for a better school.
I he assertion th.it only the upper or mid
dle-classes benefit from vert tellers is just
plain untrue.
School vouchers are not a "band-aid"'
solution. It is commonh acknowledged
that most private schools currenth offer a
better education for less money. All of
Perl tula's ideas for improvement ("raising
teacher salaries, improving resource staff,
lowering c lass size, and funding the pur
chase of belter teaching materials") are
exactly the kinds of changes that the
vouc her system will enable.
Schools 11 Kit receive voucher money
can make: then own decision as to who is
a qualified teacher, what is the best cur
riculum, etc., without wailing for a
statewide mandate. School vouchers are

the be st shot we have at educational egal
iiarianism.

wrote the story partially used my com
ments obtained from our interview. I
have never been so disappointed as with
the quality of journalism that The Daily
demonstrated in that article.
Although I understand that The Daily
could not use every bit of my verbiage, it
would have been appreciated if The Daily
were more meticulous with its selection.
I he Daily embarrassed me by taking my
comments completely out of context and
making me look like a militant African-
American with nothing of substance to
offer to combat a highly controversial and
sensitive issue within my community.
Furthermore, The Daily inaccurately
portrayed my organization, Alpha Phi

Alpha Fraternity, Incorporated, Nu
Sigma Chapter, in the same article, as
well as in a photograph published Friday,
March 31. Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity,
Incorporated, was not announcing
"upcoming rush events." No information
about "rush" events was publicized in any
of those e-mails regarding our week. In
fact, Alpha Phi Alpha is not a part of the
IFC; we are a part of the African-Ameri
can Fraternal & Sororal Association
(AAFSA), the equivalent of the National
Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) at most
schools.
AAFSA does not choose to publicize
"rush" events. The photograph of the
Alphas, barely noticeable, had an inaccu
rate caption. First, one member's name
was spelled incorrectly. Second, Golden
Vision Awards were given to BIACK
MALES who have made positive contri
butions to the Stanford community, not
to members of the fraternity; otherwise,
we would have awarded ourselves.
I strongly urge The Daily to be more
careful and accurate when publishing
articles, especially when dealing with
issues that have the potential to cause a

sensitive reaction within a particular com
munity.

Post Office hinders Census 2000?
Be counted. That's the motto for the
2000 Census. And who wouldn't want to
be? I found it fascinating that the Census
recruiters in White Plaza last Tuesday
reported that Stanford was very under
represented in the Census 10 years ago.
As I wandered back to my residence, I
couldn't help but wonder why Stanford
students and faculty — some of the finest
minds in our great nation and probably at
least as responsible as the average Tom,
Dick, or Harry — would choose not to send
in their Census forms and be counted.
And then it hit me. Perhaps it is not
that people are choosing not to mail in
their forms, but rather that they never
received their forms in the first place.
W itli the recent discarding of so-called
"bulk mail at the Stanford post office, it
wouldn't surprise me in the least if many
students and faculty members never see a
2000 Census form. I certainly haven't yet
and, frankly, 1 don't really expect to.
If you think 1 am being unfair in my
criticism of the post office, think again,
l he delivery of mail during the political
primary season was abominable! Many
people did not receive their absentee bal
lots in time to vote in their home states,
and others failed to get crucial voting
information booklets in their mailboxes
prior to the California primary.
Participating in the Census, like voting

in a primary election, is a right and not a
privilege. The post office took the right to
vote away from many through its painful
ly slow delivery, loss, and illegal discard
ing of mail. Let's make sure that doesn't
happen again with the Census. I, for one,
would like to be counted.

School vouchers wrongfully criticized
lo say that school vouchers are not
about school choice is to hide behind unin
formed rhetoric ("School choice not
'choice' for poor," March 28). The whole
point of school vouchers is to break the
public school system's monopolistic stran
glehold on our education tax dollars. If
parents do not like the education that their
children are receiving, they deserve the

choice to spend their nionc) elsewhere.
The objections that kattina Pert tula
raises to the voucher svstem include the
possibility that parents of poor students
"may not be involved or tare about [the
students'] education, or even speak
English competently enough to under
stand their rights."
Tragically, the school system will never
be able to fully reined) the problems of
neglected children. However, by intro
ducing competition into the svstein (and
thus compelling the worst public schools
to improve), we strive to at least improve
the quality of education at these schools.
Secondly, it is incredibly insulting to
suggest that parents who do not speak
English will not understand theii educa
tional rights. Non-English speaking par
ents want the best for their children as
much as you and I, and, in spile ol teach
ers unions' rhetoric to the- contrary, thou
sands of minority families in poor neigh

borhoods have ALREADY benefited
from voucher programs.
In fact, almost without exception,
these programs have long waiting lisis of
poor families looking for a better school.
I he assertion th.it only the upper or mid
dle-classes benefit from vert tellers is just
plain untrue.
School vouchers are not a "band-aid"'
solution. It is commonh acknowledged
that most private schools currenth offer a
better education for less money. All of
Perl tula's ideas for improvement ("raising
teacher salaries, improving resource staff,
lowering c lass size, and funding the pur
chase of belter teaching materials") are
exactly the kinds of changes that the
vouc her system will enable.
Schools 11 Kit receive voucher money
can make: then own decision as to who is
a qualified teacher, what is the best cur
riculum, etc., without wailing for a
statewide mandate. School vouchers are

the be st shot we have at educational egal
iiarianism.
