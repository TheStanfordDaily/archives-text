Daily misrepresents student, fraternity
Last week, the African / African-Amer
ican community experienced blatant
racism via an electronic mail message
crafted by an ignorant individual who
took the time to make sure he could not
be traced. In response,The Daily decided
to cover this issue with a story ("Another
racist e-mail hits campus") published
Wednesday, March 29. I he editor who
wrote the story partially used my com
ments obtained from our interview. I
have never been so disappointed as with
the quality of journalism that The Daily
demonstrated in that article.
Although I understand that The Daily
could not use every bit of my verbiage, it
would have been appreciated if The Daily
were more meticulous with its selection.
I he Daily embarrassed me by taking my
comments completely out of context and
making me look like a militant African-
American with nothing of substance to
offer to combat a highly controversial and
sensitive issue within my community.
Furthermore, The Daily inaccurately
portrayed my organization, Alpha Phi

Alpha Fraternity, Incorporated, Nu
Sigma Chapter, in the same article, as
well as in a photograph published Friday,
March 31. Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity,
Incorporated, was not announcing
"upcoming rush events." No information
about "rush" events was publicized in any
of those e-mails regarding our week. In
fact, Alpha Phi Alpha is not a part of the
IFC; we are a part of the African-Ameri
can Fraternal & Sororal Association
(AAFSA), the equivalent of the National
Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) at most
schools.
AAFSA does not choose to publicize
"rush" events. The photograph of the
Alphas, barely noticeable, had an inaccu
rate caption. First, one member's name
was spelled incorrectly. Second, Golden
Vision Awards were given to BIACK
MALES who have made positive contri
butions to the Stanford community, not
to members of the fraternity; otherwise,
we would have awarded ourselves.
I strongly urge The Daily to be more
careful and accurate when publishing
articles, especially when dealing with
issues that have the potential to cause a

sensitive reaction within a particular com
munity.

Post Office hinders Census 2000?
Be counted. That's the motto for the
2000 Census. And who wouldn't want to
be? I found it fascinating that the Census
recruiters in White Plaza last Tuesday
reported that Stanford was very under
represented in the Census 10 years ago.
As I wandered back to my residence, I
couldn't help but wonder why Stanford
students and faculty — some of the finest
minds in our great nation and probably at
least as responsible as the average Tom,
Dick, or Harry — would choose not to send
in their Census forms and be counted.
And then it hit me. Perhaps it is not
that people are choosing not to mail in
their forms, but rather that they never
received their forms in the first place.
