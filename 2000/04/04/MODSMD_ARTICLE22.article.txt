## LGBCC plans week to educate campus 
### SHANNON M. ASHFORD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's Queer Awareness Days kicked off yesterday with
a panel in Elliot Programming Center called "Out on the In
ternet." The panel was the 112 irst in a series of activities taking
place over the next two weeks that aim both to educate and ex
pose Stanford to issues with which the queer community deals.
In keeping with the theme "Y2Gay: Frontiers for the Next
Millennium," this year's programs range in topic from gay
marriage to religion and sexuality to the roles of the gay, les
bian, bisexual and transgender community in the s<xial and
political scenes of America.
Applied Physics doctoral candidate Matthew Lawrence,
president of BGIAD — Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Awareness
Days — helped to organize this year's events, along with
BGIAD treasurer Rich Chin, a doctoral candidate in Materi
als Science and Engineering.
For nearly 20 years, BGLAD has been the volunteer student
group on campus that has organized the annual awareness
programming.
"For the first time next year [it] will be taken over by the
[LGBCC]," said Lawrence. Along with the new leadership of

the program, the annual events will also be permanently given
the new name of "Queer Awareness Days," a change from the
name BGIAD.
" This year we're running under both names to facilitate the
transition," Lawrence said.
Other Queer Awareness Days activities include a comedy
show on Thursday featuring comedienne Kate Clinton; a
panel on gay marriage from queer feminist perspectives; a
showing of the movie "(lall to Witness," the story of three gay
religious leaders; and a keynote address by Elizabeth Birch,
the executive diret tor of the I luman Rights Campaign.
"We started an advisory board, and the director [of the
LGBCC] sits on that board with the staff and faculty mem
bers," Lawrence said. "That has helped us a lot in terms of
events and ideas."
In explaining the theme of this year's BGIAD event,
Lawrence said, "In the year to come, there are going to be key
social or economic spheres where the most important battles
are going to take place for acceptance and equality."
" Those spheres — the Internet, religion, law, light for so
cial change and entertainment ... [will be] a very powerful
means of letting people realize that gay people aren't that dif
ferent from everybody else," Lawrence said.
