## 
### MARK BOUCHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
February, a hacker seeking
anonymity in an Internet Relay ('.hat
room broke into a Stanford Ticket ()f
-fice server that stores roughly 32,000
credit card numbers, fhe break-in
prompted Stanford to warn credit
card companies of potential fraud.
However, the hacker apparently has
not accessed or used any of the ac
counts.
fhe intruder gained access to the
server in hopes of connecting anony
mously to several Internet Relay ('.hat
rooms.
Eileen Walsh, director of the Stan
ford News Service, said that evidence
indicates that the hacker was using the
computer only for anonymity in chat
ting and was not even aware of the
credit card numbers.
The Compyter Security Office dis
covered the intrusion 011 Feb. 14 and
immediately took the server off line.
The University notified both the Stan
ford Police and the banks that issued
the at-risk credit c ard numbers.
I he University notified the banks
because banks c an more easily moni
tor unauthorized account use and are
also more likely to have cardholders'
correct names, addresses and phone
numbers.
fhe banks then notified their cus
tomers. One Stanford staff member
who had recently bought tickets

through the Ticket Office said that her
bank canceled the compromised
number and issued a new number.
"I was surprised when the [bank]
called me," she said, "it was kind of
weird because I didn't know what was
going on."
Li/ I'ung, a spokeswoman for Visa,
said in The Palo Alto Daily News that
each bank handles this type of situa
tion differently. Some banks give
their customers new numbers, but
others just absorb any fraudulent ex
pense.
The Computer Security Office, a
division of Information Technology
Systems and Services, continues to in
vestigate the incident.
Because the investigation is ongo
ing, the Security ()flice refused to dis
close any leads on the hacker's identi
ty. It also refused to discuss the techni
cal details of the breach in security and
how it was discovered.
fhe server, which also stores event
and ticketing information for Lively
Arts at Stanford, has gone back online
with significantly enhanced security.
Stanford is currently reviewing its
procedures for credit card security
and management on all c ampus com
puters. 'I"his is the first known case at
Stanford in which credit card infor
mation has been compromised.
The Athletic Ticket Office uses a
separate computer system for its tick
eting and was not affected by this
break-in.
