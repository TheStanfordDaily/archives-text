# Week focuses on Islam
## Islam Awareness Week highlights Muslim culture 
### KATIE HILL 
Islam Awareness Week 2000 kicked of!
in White Plaza on Monday with an inter
national food fair featuring Persian, In
donesian and Middle Kastern foods. The
lunch time festival served to draw atten
tion to the week-long event series focusing
on Islamic (Culture.
Sponsored by the Muslim Student
Awareness Network and the Stanford Is
lamic Society, Islam Awareness Week
(lAW) provides a series of cultural events,
lectures and panels on various aspects of
Muslim culture.
I he goal of lAW, according to publici
ty materials, is to "to dispel negative
stereotypes that exist about Muslims and
to promote better cross-cultural under
standings on the Stanford campus. MSAN
wants the audiences of the lAW events to
leave with a better understanding of
Islam, Muslim culture and the role that
Muslims play in American society and the
world."
Narjes Misherghi, an officer of MSAN
and President of the Islamic Society, ex
plained that "What we try to do is educate
Stanford and local Bay Area communities
about what Muslims are really like. I think
people are a little hesitant toask questions,
and we want to bring it out there and talk
about it openly."
She feels Islamic culture is often mis
represented by negative stereotypes; par
ticularly in recent years, she said, the por
trayal of Muslims as terrorists has become
widespread. "You know, we see it on T.V.

and in the movies all the time — the Mus
lim terrorist stereotype," said Misherghi.
One of the week's featured events will
deal specifically with the sources of this
negative generalization. A panel discus
sion / teach-in entitled "Investigating Ter
rorism or Demonizing Muslims?" will ex
plore issues of terrorism in Chechnya,
Afghanistan and Indonesia, as well as tak
ing a more general look at the effects of
policies on terrorism within the interna
tional community.
Panel members will discuss both real
terrorism and the perception of "Muslim
terrorists" that has emerged in the popu
lar media. This panel is scheduled for
Wednesday at 8 p.m. in kresge Auditori
um.
Other scheduled events include a
speech entitled "Muslim Women: Beyond
the Stereotypes" by Amina Jandali, activist
and co-founder of the Islamic Networks
Group, an outreach organization. The
speech will take place Thursday at 8 p.m.
in Building 260 Room 113.
A film presentation of "Uajj: one Amer
ican's Pilgrimage to Mecca," will be held
