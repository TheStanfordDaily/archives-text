with my family."
Amar, who went to college and law school at Yale,
has been teaching at his altna mater since 1985. His

According to Law Prof. Tom Grey, head of the

Amar is generally recognized as one of the top Con
stitutional Law scholars in the country."
"It was with great delight that we learned that he
was interested in visiting with us next spring," Grey
said. "He should make a terrific contribution both
as a teacher and a faculty colleague, and we are all
very much looking forward to his visit."
According to History Prof. Jack Rakove, Amar is
"extremely smart and articulate. He has a fair
amount of visibility, and he's a very lively guy.
"He would be a terrific appointment to the law
school," Rakove added.
When asked whether this may turn into a per
manent position, Amar said, "We just don't know."
In June, Amar will join Rakove to teach a course

In addition to writing about the Constitution,
Amar has been outspoken in his views on the Sec
