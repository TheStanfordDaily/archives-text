## Baseball looks to find form against Hornets 
### BRETT KAUFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
No rest tor the weary.
That might as well he the mantra
for the No. 7 Stanford baseball team,
which has little time to recover after
dropping two of three games on the
road to conference opponent Ari
zona State last weekend.
Tonight Stanford hosts the sec
ond half of a home-and-home non
conference series with Sacramento
State and will attempt to regain the
form that had seemed almost un
beatable for the past several weeks.
The pair of losses in the Valley of
the Sun dropped Stanford (21-9, 3-
3 Pacific 10 Conference) from its
perch as the second-ranked team in
Baseball America's national poll and
leaves the Cardinal with its lowest
showing in the polls all season.
Though coaches and players
continually downplay the impor
tance of the weekly evaluations, this
week's slide indicates a slight change
to the team that cruised into confer
ence play.
"VVe try not to pay attention to
[the rankings] at all," said junior
right fielder Joe Borchard.
Stanford defeated Sacramento
State (12-17, 6-3 Big West Confer
ence) on the road in late February,
4-2, behind the arms of sophomores
Jason Luker and Mike Cosling.
However, the pair of underclass
men pitched Sunday against the No.

4 Sun Devils and may not lie avail
able for tonight's contest.
But they aren't the only tired
arms in (he Stanford bullpen. The
series in Tempe, Ariz., saw eight
Cardinal pitchers take the mound.
Head coach Mark Marquess may
have to employ a committee of
hurlers against the Hornets in re
sponse to the work his staff received
last weekend.
The status of sophomore Brian
Sager, Stanford's third starter for
much of the season, remains unclear
entering tonight's game at Sunken
Diamond. Sager lost his starting job
to Gosling after a poor outing
against USC on March 19 and has
not returned to the mound since.
List week, Marquess said that
nothing physical was truly wrong
with Sager but that the coaches had
decided to rest him anyway. The
right-handed sophomore did not
relieve Gosling in a sub-par start on
Sunday and did not even dress for a
series against Arizona the preceding
week.
The promotion of Gosling and
the removal of Sager leave Mar
quess and the Cardinal without a le
gitimate fourth starter to take the
ball tonight. Sophomore Mike Wod
nicki seems to be the most obvious
candidate for the job. However, he
did look sluggish in an inning-plus
performance on Sunday, walking
three of the seven batters he faced.
Stanford will likelv face Hornets

left-handed junior Joey Robinson
for the second time this year. Robin
son went an impressive 7 2/3 innings
while allowing just two earned runs
in his Feb. 21 start against the Cardi
nal. However, Robinson's 8.89 ERA
as Sacramento State's fourth starter
and most trusted reliever make him
a vulnerable target for an explosive
Stanford offense.
Borchard and senior John Gall
did most of the damage last time
against the lefty and figure to do the
same tonight. Both come into the
contest on hot streaks at the plate
since conference play began.
(iall collected two home runs and
drove in eight Cardinal runs against
Arizona State to become Stanford's
all-time leader in RBls. His 31 RBIs
this season leave him just two shy of
senior Edmund Muth's team lead.
The sixth home run of the year
for Borchard came Sunday to con
tinue the power surge for the junior
that began last month. Borchard has
responded well to a switch in the bat
ting order in which he moved from
fourth to fifth in late February.
Early in the season, pitching car
ried the Cardinal despiie a lacklus
ter performance at the plate. How
ever, the rust has worn off the Stan
ford bats and the hitters lauded in
the season previews have come into
their own in the last several weeks.
Fhe team has scored five or more
runs in its last 13 games and kx>ks to
build on that streak tonight.
