# Hoops fans snooze after Madness ends
## 
### 
The best three weeks of the sporting
year ended last night with a barrage of
three-pointers and a wide Mateen
Cleaves grin. Michigan State's 89-76
win over Florida in the NCAA men's title game

capped one of the most
thrilling tournaments ever. I
fhe bad news is it's all
downhill from here. The Big
Dance ended just in time for
three more months of the NBA.
In case you've been too
busy stuffing your head with
tournament tidbits from Dick
Vitale and the gang, pro bas
ketball is suffering through a

terrible television slump. NBC, which shelled
out $ 1.75 billion last season for four years of net
work NBA rights, has seen its game ratings drop
to the tune of 700,000 households a game.
NBA and N BC executives want you to believe
Michael Jordan and the NCAA are to blame for
your rapidly declining interest in pro hoops. Jor
dan for having the nerve to retire, and the NCAA
for bleeding star underclassmen to the NBA.
Never mind that the league, having already
losi I lis Airness to retirement in the mid-'9os,
had begun marketing efforts to tout young "ris
ing stars" long before Jordan hung up his Nikes.
Never mind that a large chunk of the NBA's
young talent left school early, or that two of the
young stars pegged as heirs to the Jordan em
pire, Kobe Bryant and Kevin Garnett, declared

tor the draft straight out of high school.
And never mind that the real reason nobody
turns on the leakers-Knicks Game of the Week is
that Americans have tired of the eight-month or
deal that is the NBA season.
David Stern and the boys had us fooled for a
long time. We believed their commentators
when they talked about "playoff'"atmosphere" in
a December showdown or a "Finals preview" in
February. But then a lockout shortened the
league season to 50 games over five months last
year, and we realized we'd been duped.
At 82 games, the NBAdoesn't play the I<mgest
regular season in American sports â€” that honor
belongs to Major League Baseball with 1()2. But
in baseball, where only four teams from each
league make the postseason, those games actual
ly mean something.
Twice that many clubs quality tor the NBA
playoffs, Hi in all, and the start of the first round
in mid-April often seems eons removed from the
end of the Finals in late June.
In short, the season is too long, the playoffs
are too long, and without a main character like
Jordan to advance the plot, the nation just gets
bored of the whole thing.
Which brings us back to college basketball
and the most exciting month in all of sports.
l he NCAA Tournament takes all the intensi
ty of the NBA playoffs and packs it into three
long weekends. Every tournament match-up
isn't just a playoff, it's an elimination game.
And here's the kicker: Unlike the NBA play

of Is, you don't know who's going to win.
Take a second to count the number of teams
with a real shot to win the NBA title this year.
You can do it on one hand (or no hands, if you're
only counting Eastern Conference teams).
Now think about the number of teams that
started March Madness with a chance at the
NCAA crown. At least a dozen, not including
Final Four participants Wisconsin and North
Carolina. Last year, of course, everybody picked
Duke, but the Blue Devils didn't win the crown.
Kven when one team dominates the country
(the last to do it was UNLV, nearly a decade ago),
the tournament always guarantees enough up
sets to provide more than its share of drama.
To be sure, the recent wave of early exits to
the NBA has taken its toll on college basketball.
Parity ruled this year at the tournament, and
with the impending departures of more big
name underclassmen such as lowa State's Mar
cus Fizerand Erick Barkley of St. John's, the field
looks to be wide-open next year, too.
But give me a balanced, loser-out tournament
versus a tedious playoff with a nearly foregone
champion, and I'll take parity every day.
Fhe 2000 NCAA I ournament is over, in a
flash of Spartan green and white. NBC has a
Philadelphia-Orlando, Utah-Houston,
Phoenix-Sacramento triple header on Sunday.
Wake me for the Preseason Nil .
