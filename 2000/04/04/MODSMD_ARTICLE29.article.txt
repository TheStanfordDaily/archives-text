## Green and Meyer to relocate materials to accomodate space in newly opened Bing Wing 
### EILEEN CHAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I lie relocation and re-organization of
materials in (ireen Library are scheduled
to be completed l)\ the end of April. Due to
the new free space available in the Bing
Wing, which re-openeel in October 1999,
officials have been moving circulation and
media materials from Meyer Library to
(ireen since November.
"We hadn't had access to a shelving ca
pacity ol about 800,000 volumes lor at least
ten years," said Deputy Lniversity Librar
ian Karen Nagy. "All moves relate to us
having access to these new stacks."
In the fall, media equipment from
Meyer was moved the low er level of( ireen
Last. This created the Media and Micro
forms ('.enter, where students can use dif

ferent microforms as well as check out and
view media materials.
"[This movement | was in conjunction
with the opening of the new information
center on the first floor ol (ireen East,"
Nagy said. "|We also] moved the reserves
operation from Meyer."
Larlier in the year, students com
plained that the media materials available
in (ireen were separate from the media
viewing equipment in Meyer. Since then,
the viewing equipment has also been
moved from Meyer into the Media and Mi
croforms (lenter in (ireen.
Main books were also moved from
Meyer into (ireen, but not all the books
have been placed in their linal destination
at (ireen. According to librarians, the
South Mezzanine is being integrated with
the rest of the (ireen collection.
"Since January, we've been moving
books into [Bing Wing] stacks and redis
tributing other parts of the collection
around (ireen Library," Nagy said.
Ac cording to her, the librarians not only
have to move books into the new Bing

Wing area, but have to re-organize shelf
space throughout Green.
"[Before Bing Wing was open], we had
to fill the rest of the shelving to almost 100
percent capacity," she said. "With this new
space, we need to spread the books out so
we can add books each year."
Moving materials out of Meyer has
freed up space on the first and third floors
of the library. Currently, iMac computers
and couches lill the first floor, which will
become part of an academic computing
program. Flans for the third floor are still
under determination, according to Nagy.
While students in the fill complained of
wasted space and scattered distribution of
library materials, freshman Grace Lin said
she believes the relocation of all books and
media materials into Green makes re
searching and easier task.
"It's a good idea to have all the materi
als in Green because at least that way
everything is concentrated in one library,"
Lin said. "It's more convenient when I
want to use different types of research ma
terials."
