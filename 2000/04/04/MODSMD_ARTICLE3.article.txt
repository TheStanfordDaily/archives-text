## Hua Di's conviction for spying overturned 
### PETER STAIR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ruling that evidence of Hua
Di's spying was unclear, a (ihinese
court Monday overturned the
Stanford researcher's 10-year
prison sentence and called for a
new trial, according to a Hong
Kong human rights group.
It is unclear, however, whether
the move means an end to more
than two years of international
lobbying for I lua's release. Hua.
an associate at the Stanford-based
Center for International Security
and Cooperation, has been im
prisoned in China since Jan. (i,
1998, when Chinese forces de
tained him after he attended fu
neral services for a member of his
family.
Though the Hong Kong
human rights organization, the
Information Center for Human
Rights and Democratic Move

Hua, once a highly respected
member of the Chinese elite, was
educated at Moscow's prestigious
Institute of Aeronautics and
played an important role in build
ing China's first space rocket and
satellite. In 1987 he received the
State Prize, China's greatest
honor, for his patriotic service.
But in 1989, disturbed by the

government's harsh curfew and
the crackdown at Tiananmen
Square, Ifua fled a Chinese dele
gation traveling in Europe and
found refuge in the United States.
At Stanford, he maintained his

the journal International Securi
ty. revealed the existence of
China's 1)1-21, an intermediate
range missile. Though Lewis later
showed that he and 11 ua based the
report on public information, the
report is considered one reason
I lua was arrested.
Another reason for his impris

Chinese missile capable of target

buildings. In a classified paper
identified in a September article
from the Tar Eastern Economic
Review, Hua claimed that China
would most likely respond to a
move for Taiwanese indepen
dence with a strike against the'l ai

Hua knew a return to China
would be dangerous, but, accord

SecuritN assured him of his safety.
