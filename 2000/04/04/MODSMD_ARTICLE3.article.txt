# Chinese scholar to get new trial
## Hua Di's conviction for spying overturned 
### PETER STAIR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ruling that evidence of Hua
Di's spying was unclear, a (ihinese
court Monday overturned the
Stanford researcher's 10-year
prison sentence and called for a
new trial, according to a Hong
Kong human rights group.
It is unclear, however, whether
the move means an end to more
than two years of international
lobbying for I lua's release. Hua.
an associate at the Stanford-based
Center for International Security
and Cooperation, has been im
prisoned in China since Jan. (i,
1998, when Chinese forces de
tained him after he attended fu
neral services for a member of his
family.
Though the Hong Kong
human rights organization, the
Information Center for Human
Rights and Democratic Move

Stanford sources reserved com

Hua, once a highly respected
member of the Chinese elite, was
educated at Moscow's prestigious
Institute of Aeronautics and
played an important role in build
ing China's first space rocket and
satellite. In 1987 he received the
State Prize, China's greatest
honor, for his patriotic service.
But in 1989, disturbed by the

weapons programs. ()ne report, a
1992 article written with Stanford
IVof . )ohu Lewis and published in
the journal International Securi
ty. revealed the existence of
China's 1)1-21, an intermediate
range missile. Though Lewis later
showed that he and 11 ua based the
report on public information, the
report is considered one reason
I lua was arrested.
Another reason for his impris
onment is I lua's description of a
Chinese missile capable of target
ing ke\ Taiwanese government
buildings. In a classified paper
identified in a September article
from the Tar Eastern Economic
Review, Hua claimed that China
would most likely respond to a
move for Taiwanese indepen
dence with a strike against the'l ai
wanese presidential palace.
Hua knew a return to China
would be dangerous, but, accord
ing to Lewis, the Ministry of State
SecuritN assured him of his safety.
After Una's arrest in January,
Stanford officials, hoping to help
negotiate his release quietly, kept
the arrest secret.
