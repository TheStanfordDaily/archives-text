Late at night, the elegant old mansion behind Florence Moore 1 lall
is the picture ot tranquillity. But inside the building, which houses Stan
ford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics, coin
posers, engineers, and computer scientists are hard at work pursuing
innovations in music.
CCRMA, pronounced "karma," is a multi-disciplinary facility where
computer-based technology is used both as an artistic medium and as
a research tool.
Research topics at CCRMA are varied and far-ranging. They in
clude composition, synthesis techniques and algorithms, physical mod
eling, signal processing, digital recording and editing, psychoacoustics
and musical acoustics, real-time applications and controllers, collabo
rative works with other art disciplines and music manuscripting.
The program draws undergraduate and graduate students with
backgrounds in music, electrical engineering, computer science, me
chanical engineering, psychology and more. Students can obtain a
bachelor's or master's degree in Music, Science and Technology or a
doctorate. The MST program was spec ifically created to appeal to stu
dents with science or engineering backgrounds.
CCRMA composers create works for computers and instruments
such as electronic violins to play. For example, in the center's intro
ductory computer music c lass, students learn a programming lan
guage called "Common Lisp Music" that interprets numbers as fre
quencies and modifications of those frequencies.
By changing the amplitude, repetition, vibrato and start and stop
times for given frequencies, a student can build a song or piece from
the bottom up. Coding permanent frameworks for the way a certain
frequency is interpreted leads to the creation of "instruments." A flute
instrument, for instance, will produce a sound similar to a "C" note on
a flute when the user inputs a frequency 0f440 11/
