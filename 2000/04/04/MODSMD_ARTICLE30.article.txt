# a 						weekly look at science and techology at Stanford INNOVATION
## Computer research in music has created a ‘techie’/ ‘fuzzie’ mix that has nothing to do with your MP3s Computers and music synthesized 
### MONYA DE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Late at night, the elegant old mansion behind Florence Moore 1 lall
is the picture ot tranquillity. But inside the building, which houses Stan
ford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics, coin
posers, engineers, and computer scientists are hard at work pursuing
innovations in music.
CCRMA, pronounced "karma," is a multi-disciplinary facility where
computer-based technology is used both as an artistic medium and as
a research tool.
Research topics at CCRMA are varied and far-ranging. They in
clude composition, synthesis techniques and algorithms, physical mod
eling, signal processing, digital recording and editing, psychoacoustics
and musical acoustics, real-time applications and controllers, collabo
rative works with other art disciplines and music manuscripting.
The program draws undergraduate and graduate students with
backgrounds in music, electrical engineering, computer science, me
chanical engineering, psychology and more. Students can obtain a
bachelor's or master's degree in Music, Science and Technology or a
doctorate. The MST program was spec ifically created to appeal to stu
dents with science or engineering backgrounds.
CCRMA composers create works for computers and instruments
such as electronic violins to play. For example, in the center's intro
ductory computer music c lass, students learn a programming lan
guage called "Common Lisp Music" that interprets numbers as fre
quencies and modifications of those frequencies.
By changing the amplitude, repetition, vibrato and start and stop
times for given frequencies, a student can build a song or piece from
the bottom up. Coding permanent frameworks for the way a certain
frequency is interpreted leads to the creation of "instruments." A flute
instrument, for instance, will produce a sound similar to a "C" note on
a flute when the user inputs a frequency 0f440 11/

Other work at the center involves c re
ating 3-D images and other innovative
ways to model sounds that help re
searchers understand how sound travels
and is perceived.
Undergraduate students in "Cogni
tive Psychology for Musicians" conduct
their own experiments in musical per
ception, such as tests to determine il
music heard once is perceived as faster
than music heard twice.
Meanwhile, professors and graduate
students meticulously analyze waves
using differential equations to model
sound. Simulating the unique qualities of
acoustic instruments allows for an accu
rate approximation of "real" instru

ments.
One of the most exciting projects at
CCRMA that involves diflerent disci
plines is the MusiClloth project. Musi-
Cloth is a hypothetical performance
space for computer music. It would con
sist of a graphical display, a sort of "tapes
try" behind a performer.
The performer's hand and arm move
ments would produce visual image and
sound responses from the display. More
delic ate movements would result in more
subtle-changes in the images and sounds.
Lonny Chu, who is developing Miisi-
C Cloth on a Macintosh C 3, expects that the
finished product could eventually be part
of the Information Mural in theCComput
er Science department.
(Graduates of (.(IRMA's doctoral pro
gram have made considerable advances
in the field andareenjovingsuccessfiil ca

for his graduate thesis.
