# There's no great drive to use I-drive

We still haven't found a way to
save the earth, but now at least we
can save the Web. No, I'm not
talking about Web pollution; I'm
talking about iclrive.com.
Let's say that you just got a
hold of a bootleg MP3 that all of
your friends across the country
are dying to have. Assuming that
you're actually going to share it
with them, sending the file multi
ple limes is going to get annoying
fast. Instead, you should store it
on your 1 nternet hard drive, or at
least that's what idrive.com
thinks you should do.
ldtive.com is what (INK 1 calls
"the most useful, best thought
out free storage site." It prides it
self in offering infinite Internet
space for storing whatever you
find on the Web along with 50
MB for your own desktop files.
So, you can save your much de
sired MI\S to your personal I
drive, mark it as public and tell
your friends to leave you alone
and go pic kit up themselves.
Besides making the file trans
fer process much easier,
idrive.com, through the use of a
program called Filo (which, iron
ically, must be downloaded), lets
users save entire Web pages to
their virtual space. Why not just
bookmark them? Well, this way
the saved pages are permanent,
so if the page changes, the copy
doesn't. This might be useful on

occasion, but it doesn't live up to
the hype. Iclrive.com suggests
clipping receipts and reserva
tions, but I doubt that the aver
age user would consider Filo
spectacular. One could easily
save the files to one's computer
hard drives without dealing with
Filo at all.
As usual, Stanford is up on the
technology as a part of "The I-

drive University Consortium"
which includes such universities
as MIT, Northwestern and our
friends across the Bay. The
group is made up of what I-drive
c alls "technologically progressive
schools who are partnering with
i-drive.com to help bring the
power of Internet file space to
their campuses."
Since autumn quarter and at
least through next year, everyone
with a SUNet ID can not only
store 50 MB worth of files
through the Leland systems, but
also through idrive.stanford.edu.
That's a total of 100 MB per per
son — some serious space. Why
use idrive.stanfbrd.edu instead of
iclrive.com? Besides the fact that

everyone with a SUNet ID is al
ready set up with an account, this
is unclear. At this point,
idrive.stanford.edu doesn't even
offer Filo.
Unlike the Leland system, I- *
drive doesn't require an FTP #
client, so you can upload or *
download files to your Internet ;
hard drive from any place that •
has a browser and Web access. *
Unfortunately, in order to «
modify files from I-drive, you
need to download them to what- '
ever computer you are using, •
make the changes and upload «
them back. With the Leland sys- !
terns, a basic understanding of a '
few Unix commands will let you •
directly modify and even run the •
files.
Finally, if you lose files from I
drive, sorry, they're gone. I-drive \
and the Leland system both warn •
against saving files only to their ,
spaces, but Leland offers a file re- '
covery back-up system — I-drive J
presently does not.
If by chance your 100-MB is •
filling up, other companies are
springing up with free Internet '
hard drives. I-drive's main com- '
petitors are xdrive.com and dri- ;
veway.com. X:drive offers 25 MB ■
(about the size of 17 floppy disks)
to its users, plus the chance to ,
earn up to 100 MB through a re- ;
ferral system. For Windows *
95/98/ NT users, X:drive can be
searched through Windows Ex-

plorer like the other drives
on the computer. It shows
up as "X:/" where the other
drives ("CI:/," "A:/," etc.) are
listed, and unlike with
idrive.stanford.edu, you
can run or edit files direct
ly-
Driveway also offers 25
MB of free space with
"plenty of chances to get
more space as you go
along." They partnered
with Microsoft to offer the
Web Folders system that al
lows some users to save files

directly to their Driveway
account from "Web Folders
enabled applications" like
Office 2000.
Driveway also has a
transfer limit — you can
only upload or download
11p to five times the size of
youi storage space per clay.
So, a user with 25 MB of
space can only transfer 125
Mb within 24 hours. For
most users, this probably
wouldn't be an issue.
How does l-drive match
up to its competitors? Ac
cording to Upside Media
Inc.'s Showcase Showdown
in January, l-drive came
out on top of both X:drive
and Driveway.
It shot ahead because of

the Web-clipping-Filo and
InfmiteSpace, the ability to
save a limitless amount of
"stuff' from the Web.
With computer hard dri
ves and the Leland system,
most students have plenty
of space. I-drive might be
useful for sharing files out
side of Stanford, but from
within, the network will
probably do just fine.
You might want to try I
drive if you need to ex
change files with your com
puter at home or at work,
but it seems that at this
point, most idrive.Stan
ford.edu accounts remain
empty. Maybe saving the
Web isn't so important after
all.

occasion, but it doesn't live up to
the hype. Iclrive.com suggests
clipping receipts and reserva
tions, but I doubt that the aver
age user would consider Filo
spectacular. One could easily
save the files to one's computer
hard drives without dealing with
Filo at all.
As usual, Stanford is up on the
technology as a part of "The I-

drive University Consortium"
which includes such universities
as MIT, Northwestern and our
friends across the Bay. The
group is made up of what I-drive
c alls "technologically progressive
schools who are partnering with
i-drive.com to help bring the
power of Internet file space to
their campuses."
Since autumn quarter and at
least through next year, everyone
with a SUNet ID can not only
store 50 MB worth of files
through the Leland systems, but
also through idrive.stanford.edu.
That's a total of 100 MB per per
son — some serious space. Why
use idrive.stanfbrd.edu instead of
iclrive.com? Besides the fact that

everyone with a SUNet ID is al
ready set up with an account, this
is unclear. At this point,
idrive.stanford.edu doesn't even
offer Filo.
Unlike the Leland system, I- *
drive doesn't require an FTP #
client, so you can upload or *
download files to your Internet ;
hard drive from any place that •
has a browser and Web access. *
Unfortunately, in order to «
modify files from I-drive, you
need to download them to what- '
ever computer you are using, •
make the changes and upload «
them back. With the Leland sys- !
terns, a basic understanding of a '
few Unix commands will let you •
directly modify and even run the •
files.
Finally, if you lose files from I
drive, sorry, they're gone. I-drive \
and the Leland system both warn •
against saving files only to their ,
spaces, but Leland offers a file re- '
covery back-up system — I-drive J
presently does not.
If by chance your 100-MB is •
filling up, other companies are
springing up with free Internet '
hard drives. I-drive's main com- '
petitors are xdrive.com and dri- ;
veway.com. X:drive offers 25 MB ■
(about the size of 17 floppy disks)
to its users, plus the chance to ,
earn up to 100 MB through a re- ;
ferral system. For Windows *
95/98/ NT users, X:drive can be
searched through Windows Ex-

plorer like the other drives
on the computer. It shows
up as "X:/" where the other
drives ("CI:/," "A:/," etc.) are
listed, and unlike with
idrive.stanford.edu, you
can run or edit files direct
ly-
Driveway also offers 25
MB of free space with
"plenty of chances to get
more space as you go
along." They partnered
with Microsoft to offer the
Web Folders system that al
lows some users to save files

directly to their Driveway
account from "Web Folders
enabled applications" like
Office 2000.
Driveway also has a
transfer limit — you can
only upload or download
11p to five times the size of
youi storage space per clay.
So, a user with 25 MB of
space can only transfer 125
Mb within 24 hours. For
most users, this probably
wouldn't be an issue.
How does l-drive match
up to its competitors? Ac
cording to Upside Media
Inc.'s Showcase Showdown
in January, l-drive came
out on top of both X:drive
and Driveway.
It shot ahead because of

the Web-clipping-Filo and
InfmiteSpace, the ability to
save a limitless amount of
"stuff' from the Web.
With computer hard dri
ves and the Leland system,
most students have plenty
of space. I-drive might be
useful for sharing files out
side of Stanford, but from
within, the network will
probably do just fine.
You might want to try I
drive if you need to ex
change files with your com
puter at home or at work,
but it seems that at this
point, most idrive.Stan
ford.edu accounts remain
empty. Maybe saving the
Web isn't so important after
all.
