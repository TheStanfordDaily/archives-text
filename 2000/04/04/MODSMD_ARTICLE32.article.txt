# Woo reveals the key element of explosives
## 
### YAR WOO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Most Hollywood movies have elements
that conveniently categorize them into dif
ferent genres. Buddy movies, in a process
eerily similar to Stanford roommate selec
tion, throw two hilariously opposite per
sonalities into a dangerous situation where
they must either put aside their differences
to survive, or end up murdering each other
in frustration.
Westerns bring with them their own set
of cliches — the swinging saloon door, the
singing prostitutes, the brutal shootout in
the dusty street. Even a genre as diverse as
romantic comedy follows some pretty nar
row conventions — boy meets girl, boy loses
girl, boy and girl end up killing each other.
No, ofcourse I'm kidding .... romantic
comedy isn't a diverse genre at all
For action movies, however, the only
real necessary element is the explosion. It is
generally accepted by film studies majors
that explosions add a certain je nc sais quoi
(literally, "ass-kicking factor") to any movie.
If you're still skeptical, consider how much
a crappy movie like "Sleepless In Seattle"
improves if the Space Needle explodes in
the first five seconds of the movie, skewer
ing Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan before the
opening credits are over. That might be
worth paying eight bucks for, especially if
Tom and Meg do their own stunts.
But what about the science of explo
sions? How do they work? What are the ex
plosives shown in movies made of? And,
most importantly, is it really possible foi ac
tion heroes to run down a corridor with an
explosive fireball bearing down on them,
then jump to safety?
A substance like dynamite, or nitroglyc
erin, is an example of an explosive. Explo
sives are simply materials that are capable

of producing rapidly expanding gas that
pressurizes the air around it.
For example, nitroglycerin is capable'of
producing a volume of gas over 1,200 times
its original volume under normal, room
temperature conditions. The incredibly
high pressure caused by the rapidly ex
panding gas makes the temperature of the
gas very high (think of pressure cookers
and high school chemistry), and iliis causes
(he gas to ignite, giving rise to the fireball
like explosions you see in the movies.
I he most commonly seen explosive in
the movies is probably that mysterious sub
stance (4, which stands for composite 4.
The main ingredient in C 4 is the chemical
compound cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine,
or RDX (Research Department Explosive).
RDX was discovered in 1899, but only
became popular after countries realized
how cheaply and safely they could manu
facture it. RDX is stable at room tempera
ture (much more so than nitroglycerin), but
it can still be set off with a high enough me
chanical shock.
(14 is composed of RDX and a plasticiser
that turns the crystal-like RDX into a putty
like substance that can be played with,
shaped and even thrown into direct flame
without detonating. C A is usually detonated
with a more sensitive explosive such as
RDX.
And can Mel Ciibson really outrun that
tailing explosion? Well, C 4's detonation ve
locity (the velocity at which the gas ex
pands) is about 9,000 meters/second. If Mel
is standing in a hallway, and the explosion
is 100 meters behind him, that means that
the explosion will catch up to him in 0.01
seconds, or less than a blink of an eye.
Not really enough time it) make that last
leap to freedom.
This week's brainteaser:
You have an ordinary wine bottle, filled
halfway with water. Without taking out any
water or adding atn, can you find the bot
tle's volume (to within a reasonable degree
of accuracy) with only a ruler?
