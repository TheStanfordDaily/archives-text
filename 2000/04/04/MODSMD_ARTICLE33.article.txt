take hold and stay in place, and they
have powerful antiviral and antibacteri

al qualities."

lioiate upper respiratory congestion is
eeliinacea. According to 1 .ukaczer, echi
nacea is most effective when used at the
112 irst si«.»lls of a cold, in large doses.
Research efforts have proven that
echinacea is not a placebo. In fact, ac
cording to article in Nutrition Science
News, studies have shown that when
given in doses of 900 nig at the onset of
the common cold, echinacea has proven

Acholonu said, "I think that the effect
on the body has more to do with what
you believe in then the herb. If someone
believes that [the herb] will help them,
then it's true for them."
All Jamba Juice smoothies and soups
include one free boost, so try and test
