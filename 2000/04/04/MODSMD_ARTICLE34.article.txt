# Entrepreneurship is not just business thinking
## 
### 
S tart-ups. Technology. En
trepreneurship. Having
studied at Stanford, I find it
difficult not to be affected
by the contagious excitement of
the surrounding Silicon Valley cul
ture.
As an entering freshman, I was
intrigued by this catch phrase, "en
trepreneurship," even though I
did not quite

Un ders tan d
what it meant,
associating it
only with high
tech start-ups
and enormous
profits. Since
then, my per
ception of this
key term has
been molded
and shaped by

my experiences here at Stanford,
and I have come to recognize the
rich dimensions of what this word
denotes.
Entreprenenrship, I have
found, has very little to do with
making money hut is instead an at
titude, a way of thinking. It goes
beyond simply starting a company.
In other words, not all people who
start their own organizations can
necessarily be categorized as entre
preneurs. Entrepreneurs chal
lenge assumptions, recognize op
portunities in periods of change,
reveal patterns where others sec
chaos, and mobilize limited re
sources to achieve an objective.
If entreprenenrship is a type of
mindset, then, can it not also be ap
plied to other sectors beyond tech
nology, beyond the business
world? Many argue, as I do, that

not only can entrepreneurship be
applied to other areas, but it has
the power to revolutionize these
sectors. I he idea of "social entre
preneurship" is one thai has gen
erated a great deal of interest and
has gained more momentum in re
cent years. It is still in its early aca
demic phase; consequently, many
people perceive it in different
ways.
It is a concept that is difficult to
define, and this maybe attributable
to the difficulty of solely defining
the second word. 1 strongly en
courage anyone who is interested
in any area of entrepreneurship to
study specifically social entrepre
neurship. Why? Because it would
force them to probe and dissect
what it means to be entrepreneur
ial and whether they can in fact be
entrepreneurial in a seemingly un
related field serving the social sec
tor. Are the two concepts mutually
exclusive? Clan they be mutually
beneficial?
The main difference between
business entrepreneurs and social
entrepreneurs lies in their respec
tive missions. 'The latter pursue a
social mission that is central in mo
tivating their actions. Whereas the
value generated by a business en
trepreneur is most often measured
through profit, the value generat
ed by a social entrepreneur is more
difficult to measure because it en
compasses social improvements
and public goods. So what are spe
cific examples of social entrepre
neurship? How are the tools of
business and the passion and cre
ativity of entrepreneurs being uti
lized to address social causes?
1 here exists a wide spectrum of
organizations that blur these lines
between traditional nonprofits and
commercial businesses. Some of
these organizations, as described
by the Public Management Pro

gram in the Stanford Graduate
School of Business, might include
"a for-profit and nonprofit part
nership, a for-profit generating
funds specifically for nonprofit
purposes, a start-up organization
addressing a social cause as a for
profit, a nonprofit spinning off a
for-profit subsidiary, or a partner
ship between nonprofits." All of
these examples serve to blur the
boundaries between the private
and public sector.
But above all else, a social entre
preneur is one that expresses
many of the entrepreneurial ideals
mentioned previously. Entrepre
neurship is simply finding new op
portunities to do things better, and
then seizing the opportunity. I am
currently directing an organiza
tion called Kids With Dreams that

was started two and a half years
ago. Our purpose is to empower
disabled children with the belief
that they can make significant con
tributions to the world.
The group was founded upon
the principles of social entrepre
neurship and have continually
striven to express these principles
in pursuing our social mission. We
have especially recognized the
power of leveraging the resources
that Silicon Valley has to offer:
namely the skills, money and tech
nology that propel the Valley. ()ne
of our projects, CAES (Computer-
Assisted Training Program), inte
grates technology into the curricu
lum of specialty classrooms 112( >r chil
dren with learning and develop
mental disabilities. In diversifying
our funding base, we have also gar

tiered generous support from
Hewlett-Packard and BASES, the
Business Association of Stanford
Engineering Students.
I do not claim in know to am
high degree the exact definition ol
"social entrepreneurship." and I
.tin always in the continual process
of redefining this term lor myself
and exploring the concept
through readings and experi
ences. It is a dynamic and intrigu
ing field.
I invite you to explore it fur
ther this coming Saturday, April <S
at the Kids With Dreams and
BASES Conference on Social En
trepreneurship. Attendance will
consist of roughly L\ r >o undergrad
uate, graduate, business and law
students from the Bay Area. We
have invited the founders and ex

ecutivi directors ol ;i number <>1

ideas and to impress upon future
