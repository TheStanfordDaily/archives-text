Social Entrepreneurship Conference
Kids with Dreams and BASES
April 8,2000
Kids With Dreams and BASES will be holding a regional confer
ence to educate Stanford students and other attendees on the
subject of social entrepreneurship. We want to prove that service
and entrepreneurship are not concepts that preclude one anoth
er, but rather ones that strengthen one another. We want Stan
lord and other students to benefit from a new perspective on how
to approach challenges in the s<x ial sector. Social entrepreneurs
may be described as those who implement changes in the social
sector. In being exposed to the concept of social entrepreneur
ship, our audience will be able to apply these principles and ideals
to the work they are currently involved with in the community.
