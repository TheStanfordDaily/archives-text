# Dunbar's worldwide travels spark interests

Geological and Environmental Sci
ences Prof. Robert Dunbai is providing
Stanford with a laudable example of an
accomplished researcher who is full)
committed to undergraduate education.
Dunbar's research interests and back
ground combine oceanography with
geochemistry and studies of climate
change. Specifically, he locuses his work
on Ocean-atmosphere interaction, the
polar waters and the El Nino phenome
non. Mis research also involves generat
ing models in an eflbrt to predict global
environmental change.
Dunbar's research efforts encompass
two venues. 1 Ie embarks on three or lour
field expeditions a year which span from
a couple of weeks to several months in
duration. Field samples collected In
Dunbar's team are chemically analv/ed
at Stanford.
In order to study historical climatic
variability, Dunbar's team drills sediment
cores from reef corals and lake sedi
ments. I hen, these samples are assessed
using chemical, isotopic and morpholog
ical assays.
Like tree rings, these sediment cores
exhibit annual growth patterns, which
reflect different proportions o! oxygen
isotopes. The differences in annual
bands on the sediment cores correlate
with changes in oceanic temperature.
Specific projects that Dunbar has
spearheaded include fieldwork in
Antarctica, East Africa and various tropi
cal islands.
Within Antarctica, Dunbar works in
two locales: the Pacific sector and the
Antarctic peninsula. Much of his current
work on the South Pole involves a project
focusing 011 the Ross Sea and itsuptakeol
carbon dioxide. I hrough a collaboration
that included Oeophvsics Asst. Prof.
Kevin Arrigo, this work has doc umented
climate change eflects on the Southern
ocean.
The Southern ocean is an important

place ot oceanographic study, as it is one
ol the lew global sites of deep water out
cropping, where the deep ocean ex
changes with the atmosphere. Dunbar
describes this process as being akin to the
ocean breathing.
Based on his work in the Southern
ocean he explains, " The results indicate
that it is a fairly delicate system that is un
dergoing rapid change."
Dunbar's research also focuses on the
1.1 Nino-Southern Oscillation process,
which he describes as "a wave-like phe
nomenon." by studying coral samples
which were drilled oil of the East African
coast, Dunbar and Ins colleagues demon
strated that the impact of El Nino may
reach as far as the Indian ocean.
I hese results, which show that the
surface temperature of the Indian ocean
has fluctuated in a pattern that corre
sponds to the oscillation that drives El
Nino in the Pacific. Dunbar comments,
"This is strong evidence of the Indian
Ocean responding to the Pacific on a
decadal time scale." I hese findings were
published in the jan. 2S issue of "Sci
ence."
Dunbar and his collaborators hope to
use this link between the oceans as a way
to predict the fluctuations of the Indian
Ocean. It is possible that the El Nino ef
fect relates to the severity of monsoon
rainfall along the Indian coast. If scien
tists could predict the severity of the rains
in advance, they could mitigate the se
vere Hooding of millions of coastal resi
dents
Dunbar relates his research to the un
dergraduate community through classes
such as his freshman seminar on El Nino,
CI S 111.. Dunbar has also taken under
graduates on his field expeditions. Un
dergraduate Lauren Rogers will accoin
pan\ him to Antartica this month.
Additionally, Dunbar has been in
volved in the development of the new
Oceans tract within Earth Systems. This
tract included the recruitment of new
faculty and the addition of five to six new
classes w hie h will relate to oceanography.
