# Homestead finds roots in community service work
## 
### CHRISTOPHER LYLE RAVI SARIN CONTRIBUTING WRITERS 
There is dearly something different
about a guy who holds the Guinness
Book world record in leap-frogging.
Justin Kitch, (TO and Co-Founder
of Homestead and Stanford alumnus
(Class of 1994), helped raise $15,000
for charity in setting the world record.
1 his was his unique way of giving back
to the community, a trend that he has
carried over to a successful Internet
company and corporate environment.
Homestead is a Web-based resource
for building free Web sites.
With the Homestead soft-

ware, people can create
home pages very easily
without an\ knowledge of
the technical details and
then post the Web page to
show to their friends.
Homestead is very simi
lar to a Web version of Web
develop men I soft ware
such as Microsoft Front
page.

With around 120 employees, nearly
00 percent of which are Stanford alum
ni, Homestead has strong Stanford
roots.
Homestead's origins extend back to
Kitch's Science, Technology and Soci
ety honors thesis, for which he created
FUNdaMENTAL, a children's pro
gramming language.
Kite h co-founded KartoffelSoft with
Stanford alumnus Thai Bui in 1994 to
further develop this educational soft
ware tool.
The goal of KartoffelSoft was to
make the growing world of computers
accessible and understandable to c hil
dren, according to Kite b.
This goal was brought to the mass

market and the Web with Homestead
in late 1997. By simplifying the process
of building Web pages, Homestead
continued the goal of KartoffelSoft.
Since then, Homestead has been
growing rapidly. Given its fairly large
size however, Homestead has yet to
make an initial public offering. That is,
it has not released its stock in the public
market. I his is an atypical situation for
a company in this stage of develop
ment, according to Kitch.
Kitch was adamant that Homestead
is looking for long-term growth.
Homestead is not looking for an "exit
strategy" (a way to cash out, such as an
IPC) or merger) like many other tech
nology startups, he said.
1 lomestead has therefore been faced
with the challenge of competing with
companies who offer employees the
potential opportunity to become rich
quickly.

"If people come because of the
money, then they will leave because of
the money," Kite h said. "The kinds of
people we want aren't focused on shal
low rewards."
Therefore, Homestead recruits peo
ple with more than just a promise of fu
ture riches. Homestead believes that it
provides a fun and relaxed work envi
ronment with a genuine dedication to
improving the community, Kitch said.
One way Homestead achieves this
goal is through community service pro
grams. Homestead offers employees a
unique way to give back to the commu
nity.
Kmployees are given two hours a
week, or one day out of the month of
paid time to perforin community ser
vice with an organization of their

choice.
Some of these organizations include
Habitat for Humanity, Friends for
Youth, Bay Area Action and Breaking
Bread for Urban Youth.
Homestead also manages the
KartoffelSoft Foundation, which do
nates money to organizations for which
a number of employees volunteer their
time.
"We only give out money alter we
give our time," Kitch said.
To orchestrate the community ser
vice efforts, Homestead has created a
unique position for "Cultural Czar,"
who spends his or her time organizing
efforts to give back to the community.
Another unique aspect of Home
stead is its physical space. Walking into
Homestead is like walking into a toy
store. A toy train greets visitors at the
entrance, and colorful walls extend the
atmosphere.

The physical layout is
in line with the corporate
structure, Kitch said, as
everyone works as a team,
and there is little noticeable
hierarchy. As part of its com
munity service efforts,
I lomestead invites childrens'
groups to tour the offices.
Kitch said that a large

part of his success is due to
his experience at Stanford. He said that
Stanford provided him with a sense of
both empowerment and humility.
"1 left with a feeling that I could do
whatever 1 wanted to and go with it,"
he said. "At the same time, I gained hu
mility because everyone around me
was so impressive."
Kitch has some advice for Stanford
students that reflects his own outlook
and guided the way he built Home
stead.
"My advice is to be very grateful for
what you have and to know that you
have responsibility to do something
positive with that," Kitch said. "Be pas
sionate and true to yourself, and don't
seek external validation for what you
do. Remember at the end of the day
that life is about other people."
