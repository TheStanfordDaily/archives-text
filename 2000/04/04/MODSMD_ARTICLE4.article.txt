Palm pilots have replaced
pocket protectors, but that's not
the only change on the 112 arm over
the past eight years.
John Hennessy has agreed to
lead a university that could not be
more different from the one Ger
hard Casper guided through the
scandals and political turmoil ol
the early 19905.
I lennessv will oversee the con
tinuing development of an institu
tion that now boasts a $6.2 billion
endowment, a newly competitive
men's basketball team and an
even lower admission rate than it
did a decade ago.

ed in the technological center of
the world, Silicon Valley, doesn't

about whether the University on
the whole is optimistic and in good
spirits, and 1 think Stanford is,"

Casper told 1 lie Daily last fall after
announcing his resignation.
"'l'hat clearly was not my accom
plishment — that was something
where we all worked together —
the faculty, the students and the
staff."
Casper began his tenure bat

inflated indirect costs associated
with government research by
$230 million. Stanford's reputa
tion was battered in the press In
revelations of the misuse of gov
ernment funds, some used to pa\

ident Donald Kennedy's home.
At the same time, the Universi
ty was struggling with a $43 mil
lion deficit. The shortfall was cre
ated w hen the number of defense
research contracts fell and new
federal regulations cut back the
amount of I niversitv research ex

ment. I he School of I lumanuies
and Sciences, the School of Engi
neering and the Athletic Depart
ment were hit the hardest b\ de
