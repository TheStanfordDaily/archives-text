## Hennessy takes over a calmer university than Casper inherited 
### ANITHA REDDY EDITORIAL STAFF 
Palm pilots have replaced
pocket protectors, but that's not
the only change on the 112 arm over
the past eight years.
John Hennessy has agreed to
lead a university that could not be
more different from the one Ger
hard Casper guided through the
scandals and political turmoil ol
the early 19905.
I lennessv will oversee the con
tinuing development of an institu
tion that now boasts a $6.2 billion
endowment, a newly competitive
men's basketball team and an
even lower admission rate than it
did a decade ago.
file fact that Stanford is locat
ed in the technological center of
the world, Silicon Valley, doesn't
hurt either.
"I think it's important to think
about whether the University on
the whole is optimistic and in good
spirits, and 1 think Stanford is,"

Casper told 1 lie Daily last fall after
announcing his resignation.
"'l'hat clearly was not my accom
plishment — that was something
where we all worked together —
the faculty, the students and the
staff."
Casper began his tenure bat
tling allegations that Stanford had
inflated indirect costs associated
with government research by
$230 million. Stanford's reputa
tion was battered in the press In
revelations of the misuse of gov
ernment funds, some used to pa\
for depreciation of the Universi
ty's yacht ,md parties at then-Pres
ident Donald Kennedy's home.
At the same time, the Universi
ty was struggling with a $43 mil
lion deficit. The shortfall was cre
ated w hen the number of defense
research contracts fell and new
federal regulations cut back the
amount of I niversitv research ex

ment. I he School of I lumanuies
and Sciences, the School of Engi
neering and the Athletic Depart
ment were hit the hardest b\ de

age of the indirect cost scandal, Stanford
received further negative national at
tention when former Secretary of Edu
cation William Bennett criticized the
University's attempt to broaden the
Western-oriented freshmen CIV pro
gram to include more non-European
authors.
Hennessy will begin his tenure in the
calm after these storms. Stanford's rep
utation emerged relatively unscathed
from the indirect cost scandal when the
government announced in 1994 that
the University had not engaged in fraud
or wrongdoing.
In addition, Stanford's efforts to
make its curriculum more multicultur
al, once a lightning-rod for criticism, are
now commonplace among its peer insti

tutions.
Hennessy's presidency will remain
untouched by disappointment in the
UCSI--Stanford merger, which Casper
scrapped late last year partly due to op
erating costs $73 million over budget.
He will, however, have to deal with
an issue that was not considered a high
priority in the early 19905: the shortage
of faculty and graduate housing.
The shortage is "possibly Stanford's
biggest problem," Hennessy said lasi
spring.
Casper has left I lennessy a legacy <>l
innovation in undergraduate educa
tion, one that includes freshman and
sophomore seminars and new residen
tial education initiatives.
In an interview with The Daily last
year, Casper said that he considered
Stanford Introductory Seminars to be
the greatest accomplishment of his pres
idency.
"We've done more in a short period

to change the first two years of college
than any comparable institution," I fen
uessy said last spring.
In contrast to the negative publicity
plaguing Stanford at the beginning of
(Jasper's tenure, media reports on Stan
ford now focus on its location in a
hotbed of technological innovation and
the unparalleled reputation of its stu
dents as risk-taking entrepreneurs.
Some faculty and students, however,
have expressed concerns about the in
creasingly "techie" orientation and rep
utation of the University.
"I'm going to spend the next year un
derstanding why my humanities col
leagues feel the way they do," I lennessy
said last spring.
I lennessy said yesterday lie will
probably appoint a provost with a hu
manities background because the presi
dent and provost "need to bring differ
ent perspectives" to their administrative
roles.
