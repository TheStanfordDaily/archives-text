### SHANNON M. ASHFORD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In response t<> the two most recent racist e
mailsthat havecirc ulated 011 e-mail lists within the
Stanford black coinmimitv, a group of students
submitted a list of live "corrective policy recom
mendations" to Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Mont ova last Iridav.

Black Student Union Co-chairs, senior Brian
Kikuda and senior Jainal VVatkins, along with
Black Student I 11 ion members RoscoeJones, Jr.,
a senior, and Ajamu Kitwana,a junior, drafted the
letter with the help of other concerned students
during .111 emergency meeting held late last
Thursday night in Ujamaa Drake Lounge.
The letter states, "... it is evident to the black
community that the University needs to deal with

the primary c auses of the deteriorating racial cli
mate oil campus, rather than f<Kusing strictly on
interpretations of the 112 undamental Standard.
Enclosed with this letter is.i list oft he specific ways
the administration can combat the negative exter
nalities of institutional racism and prevent 'diver
sity regression' from hemming entrenched here
on campus.
Aside from being a student concern, the
e-mails prompted increased concern
among administrators about campus Inter
net security and the repeated victimization
of the Stanford black community, which has
been targeted in four racist e-mails since
Sept. 1999.
After each e-mail was sent, administra
tors met to discuss procedures for conduct
ing an investigation of the origin of the e
rnail. Montoya has also written responses in
I he Daily, explaining to the community the
steps that are toeing taken by the adminis
tration.
I he latest e-mail sent has also alarmed
African-American staff who, for the first
time, received the racist e-mail through the
African American Stall Group's e-mail list.
"My letter to 1 lie Daily last week regard
ing the racist e-mails focused on building a
strong, inclusive community," said Mon
toya. " I he letter I received from the Black
Student Union on Friday afternoon offers
recommendations on how to build a
stronger community," he continued.
I he five major areas of improvement
suggested in the BSU's letter were: greater
support for black initiatives through in
creased funding of the Black Community
Services Center and other campus ethnic
centers; increased support for the African
and African American Studies program; ad
ministrative support for a re-evaluation of
the Special Fee funding process; Black re
cruitment and retention; and administra
tive support of minority initiatives.
l.ast night in the general meeting of the
Black Student I nion, members discussed

the influx of electronic hate mail, as well as
its effects on the Stanford community at
large.
1 think that the black community
should take advantage of the opportunity ii
now has to voice its concerns alx>ut the racial
climate at Stanford to an audience that has
the power to effect c hange," said freshman
Damon Jones, a memlxrof BSU.
"The intent of the letter is to voice our
concerns to the administration as well as
offer policy recommendations tor campus
improvements," said Rikuda. "We are con
fident that the administration will take the
policy recommendations seriously," contin
ued Rikuda. "We expect to see a timely re
sponse to our policy."
lite administration also recognizes the
importance of a timely response to the rec
ommendations that have been submitted.
"I will discuss the letter with Provost
Hennessy when we meet later this week,"
said Montoya. "My hope is to have a meet
ing by early next week with the BSU leader
ship to discuss their recommendations and
other issues on their minds."
kitwana agrees that the administration
should encourage the campus community to
lx* engaged in a dialogue alxnit issues of
racism and diversity. "Stanford is an incuba
tor for future leaders of Our country, and as
such, it has the responsibility to take a strong
stance against racism and serve as an example
to all other educational institutions," he said.
The letter that accompanied the policy
recommendations challenged Stanford's
administration to create a climate where
race and diversity are more commonly dis
cussed.
As the letter emphasized, "We are asking
the administration to make the leap from
rhetoric to actions in order to make Stan
ford a home for all students regardless of
their ethnic or c ultural heritage."
