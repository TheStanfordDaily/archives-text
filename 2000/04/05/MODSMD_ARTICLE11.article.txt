## Race for presidency heats up 
### 
PHILADELPHIA (AP) â€” A 1 Gore
and George W. Bush converged
on the presidential battleground
of Pennsylvania yesterday, with
the vice president announcing a
plan to increase Social Security for
millions of women while Bush
focused anew on education.
Gore also took aim at the Texas
governor's proposal to allow pri
vate retirement accounts in the
Social Security system, telling
senior citizens, "If he gets his
hands 011 America's retirement
system, it will quickly become a sys
tem of social insecurity."
Bush responded to both Gore's
Social Security criticism and pro
posal by telling reporters: "I can't
think of a better reform than
allowing women to manage their
own personal savings accounts."
Seven months before the elec
tion, with the Democratic and
Republican nominations essential
ly assured, Gore and Bush are
beginning to focus on five or six
swing states that could determine
the final outcome.
While most are in the Midwest,
one is Pennsylvania, which has 23
electoral votes. Yesterday was pri
mary day in the state.
The race remains very close
nationally. According to a new
Gallup Poll, Bush had 46 percent
and Gore 45 percent among likely
voters, a dead heat given the poll's
error margin of plus or minus 5
percentage points for 498 likely
voters interviewed last Thursday
through Sunday.
Bush had a 49 percent to 43
percent edge among likely voters
in the poll in early March.
Pennsylvania voted Republican
in the 1988 presidential election,
but Democratic in the last two.
To capture such states, Bush
and Gore are anxiously courting
independents and women.
Polls show women in particu
lar are concerned about issues
such as education while many
voters worry about the solvency
of Social Security.
Gore proposed Social Security
revisions that would benefit wid
ows and an estimated 8 million
working parents - most of them
women.
In particular, he said parents
should receive credit for up to
live years of work if they take that
time to raise their children.
Currently, Social Security pay
ments are based on average earn
ings over 35 years of work.
Because many women leave the
work force for several years to
raise children, the typical woman
works 27 years - penalizing her
when it comes to Social Security
payments.
Giving her credit for some of
that lost time would increase
Social Security benefits by about
$600 per year, Gore's campaign
estimated.
Gore also said widows should
receive larger Social Security
payments when their husbands
die.
Under current law, a widow's
payment can be as much as
halved when her spouse dies.
