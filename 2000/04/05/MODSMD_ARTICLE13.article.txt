# Microsoft ruling stirs Wall Street
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Fueled by
an exodus from all things techno
logical, the stock market went into
a stomach-churning rout yester
day, with the Nasdaq composite
index and Dow Jones industrials
each dropping more than 500
points. But the stampede reversed
as buyers returned in search of bar
gains, and most stocks ended Wall
Street's most volatile day ever with
only moderate losses.
The selloff came amid a collapse
of the euphoria over high-tech
issues that had driven the Nasdaq
to unprecedented gains in recent
months. Analysts said they couldn't
point to any one factor in yester
day's massive selling, but most said
the purge was long overdue.
"As hard as it is to believe, this is
a good thing," said Fete Anderson,
chief investment officer at Ameri
can Express Financial Advisors in
Minneapolis. "One sector of the
market was insanely overvalued.
The rest was deeply undervalued.
Now we are reversing that."
I'he Nasdaq and the Dow each
recorded their widest point swings
in history on record volume.
The Nasdaq, dominated by the
technology stocks that have
plunged the past three weeks, was
down 574.57 points at midday,
then clawed back to finish down
74.79 at 4,148.89. From its high to
its low, the Nasdaq moved more
than 634 points.
The Dow rose 196.23 points
yesterday morning before careen
ing to a loss 0f503.53 in early after
noon. It finished down 57.09 at
11,164.84, having made its way
back to positive territory briefly
before turning lower once again. It
swung more than 700 points dur
ing the day.
The Standard & Poor's 500 fell
11.24 to 1,494.73 and the Russell
2000 index of smaller companies
plunged 9.90 to 506.12.
Among the tech stocks that got
hit and then recovered was JDS
Uniphase, a maker of parts for
fiber-optic networks. It fell as much
as 19 5/8, and ended down 4 5/8 at
107.
I Village, which runs a Web site
targeted at women, wasn't as lucky.
It fell 1 9/16 to 11 11/16. Last
spring, its share price was 130.
Microsoft, a catalyst for the
record 349-point drop in the Nas
daq on Monday, fell another 2 5/16
to 88 9/16 in the wake of a federal
judge's antitrust ruling against it.
" The simple, rational thing to
say is that that the technology sec
tor is coming back to Earth," said
Hugh Johnson, chief investment
officer at First Albany Corp.
"We've gone through a period of
dramatic speculation, and histori
cally, every period of speculation
has been followed by a period of
distress."
Among the factors in yesterday's
selling were what's known in the
market as margin calls.
When investors buy stcxk using
borrowed money, known as mar
gin, they are forced to sell if prices
drop sharply.
"That substantially exaggerated
the downturn," said Tom Galvin,

chief equity strategist at Donald
son, Lufkin & Jenrette in New
York.
On the floor of the New York
Stock Exchange, sell orders
stacked up at trading posts and
drove traders outside the building
in search of a brief respite.
"I was so busy, honest to God, I
didn't know how bad we were
down," said Terrence O'Donnell,
trading clerk with Salomon Smith
Barney. "I was literally buried in
paper."
Analysts said the swiftness of the
selloff evoked memories of Octo
ber 1997, when the Dow fell 554
points in a single session as finan
cial crises in Asia and Russia
gripped world markets. But mar
ket watchers noted one crucial,
though perplexing, difference.
"We haven't seen a bout of
panic selling like today's since then,
but there was a clear catalyst then,
and there isn't one now," Galvin
said.
In Austin, Texas, investor
Michael Mighni made no secret of
his distress.
"1 lost more money in this week
than I made in the previous two
years," said Miglini, 31, who
recently sold his construction com
pany and invested in the stcxk
market. Most of his holdings are in
technology stcxks.
"It was the absolute worst tim
ing possible," he said. "It's a painful
lesson."
For some, however, the pain
was short-lived. Computer pro
grams that triggered selling on the
way down eventually sparked buy
ing.
Investors resumed their recent
shift to blue-chip stcxks, which are
seen as more stable and less specu
lative than their high-tech counter
parts.
Procter & Gamble, the big con
sumer products company that has
been beaten down lately on profit
woes, rose 4 to 63 1/2. Drugmaker
Merck rose 15/16 to 67 11/16. Both
are components of the Dow indus
trials.
The largest of the technology
stocks recovered, tcx). Computer
network maker Cisco Systems
ended up 3/16 at 73 1/8.
Analysts pointed out that even
with the wide swings of many
st(xks, investors in most technolo
gy names are still posting dramatic
gains for the year.
Investors also found refuge in
the bond market.
Prices soared, bringing the yield
on the 30-year Treasury bond
down to 5.77 percent from 5.81
percent late Monday.
By the end of the session, Wall
Street analysts were lcx>king cau
tiously to a handful of factors that
could halt the decline of technolo
gy stcxks and lift the market anew.
Corporate earnings reports,
which will flcxxl the market in the
next few weeks, are expec ted to lx
strong.
Also, some market watchers said
the market's implosion may con
vince the Federal Reserve that it
won't need to intervene further to
slow the economy .

NEW YORK (AP) — Fueled by
an exodus from all things techno
logical, the stock market went into
a stomach-churning rout yester
day, with the Nasdaq composite
index and Dow Jones industrials
each dropping more than 500
points. But the stampede reversed
as buyers returned in search of bar
gains, and most stocks ended Wall
Street's most volatile day ever with
only moderate losses.
The selloff came amid a collapse
of the euphoria over high-tech
issues that had driven the Nasdaq
to unprecedented gains in recent
months. Analysts said they couldn't
point to any one factor in yester
day's massive selling, but most said
the purge was long overdue.
"As hard as it is to believe, this is
a good thing," said Fete Anderson,
chief investment officer at Ameri
can Express Financial Advisors in
Minneapolis. "One sector of the
market was insanely overvalued.
The rest was deeply undervalued.
Now we are reversing that."
I'he Nasdaq and the Dow each
recorded their widest point swings
in history on record volume.
The Nasdaq, dominated by the
technology stocks that have
plunged the past three weeks, was
down 574.57 points at midday,
then clawed back to finish down
74.79 at 4,148.89. From its high to
its low, the Nasdaq moved more
than 634 points.
The Dow rose 196.23 points
yesterday morning before careen
ing to a loss 0f503.53 in early after
noon. It finished down 57.09 at
11,164.84, having made its way
back to positive territory briefly
before turning lower once again. It
swung more than 700 points dur
ing the day.
The Standard & Poor's 500 fell
11.24 to 1,494.73 and the Russell
2000 index of smaller companies
plunged 9.90 to 506.12.
Among the tech stocks that got
hit and then recovered was JDS
Uniphase, a maker of parts for
fiber-optic networks. It fell as much
as 19 5/8, and ended down 4 5/8 at
107.
I Village, which runs a Web site
targeted at women, wasn't as lucky.
It fell 1 9/16 to 11 11/16. Last
spring, its share price was 130.
Microsoft, a catalyst for the
record 349-point drop in the Nas
daq on Monday, fell another 2 5/16
to 88 9/16 in the wake of a federal
judge's antitrust ruling against it.
" The simple, rational thing to
say is that that the technology sec
tor is coming back to Earth," said
Hugh Johnson, chief investment
officer at First Albany Corp.
"We've gone through a period of
dramatic speculation, and histori
cally, every period of speculation
has been followed by a period of
distress."
Among the factors in yesterday's
selling were what's known in the
market as margin calls.
When investors buy stcxk using
borrowed money, known as mar
gin, they are forced to sell if prices
drop sharply.
"That substantially exaggerated
the downturn," said Tom Galvin,

chief equity strategist at Donald
son, Lufkin & Jenrette in New
York.
On the floor of the New York
Stock Exchange, sell orders
stacked up at trading posts and
drove traders outside the building
in search of a brief respite.
"I was so busy, honest to God, I
didn't know how bad we were
down," said Terrence O'Donnell,
trading clerk with Salomon Smith
Barney. "I was literally buried in
paper."
Analysts said the swiftness of the
selloff evoked memories of Octo
ber 1997, when the Dow fell 554
points in a single session as finan
cial crises in Asia and Russia
gripped world markets. But mar
ket watchers noted one crucial,
though perplexing, difference.
"We haven't seen a bout of
panic selling like today's since then,
but there was a clear catalyst then,
and there isn't one now," Galvin
said.
In Austin, Texas, investor
Michael Mighni made no secret of
his distress.
"1 lost more money in this week
than I made in the previous two
years," said Miglini, 31, who
recently sold his construction com
pany and invested in the stcxk
market. Most of his holdings are in
technology stcxks.
"It was the absolute worst tim
ing possible," he said. "It's a painful
lesson."
For some, however, the pain
was short-lived. Computer pro
grams that triggered selling on the
way down eventually sparked buy
ing.
Investors resumed their recent
shift to blue-chip stcxks, which are
seen as more stable and less specu
lative than their high-tech counter
parts.
Procter & Gamble, the big con
sumer products company that has
been beaten down lately on profit
woes, rose 4 to 63 1/2. Drugmaker
Merck rose 15/16 to 67 11/16. Both
are components of the Dow indus
trials.
The largest of the technology
stocks recovered, tcx). Computer
network maker Cisco Systems
ended up 3/16 at 73 1/8.
Analysts pointed out that even
with the wide swings of many
st(xks, investors in most technolo
gy names are still posting dramatic
gains for the year.
Investors also found refuge in
the bond market.
Prices soared, bringing the yield
on the 30-year Treasury bond
down to 5.77 percent from 5.81
percent late Monday.
By the end of the session, Wall
Street analysts were lcx>king cau
tiously to a handful of factors that
could halt the decline of technolo
gy stcxks and lift the market anew.
Corporate earnings reports,
which will flcxxl the market in the
next few weeks, are expec ted to lx
strong.
Also, some market watchers said
the market's implosion may con
vince the Federal Reserve that it
won't need to intervene further to
slow the economy .
