# United Nations calls for an investigation into Chechnya abuses
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) â€” Russia
warned the international com
munity not to meddle in its
domestic affairs yesterday after
the top U.N. human rights offi
cial said she was shocked by
accounts of killings and cruelty
in Chechnya and urged Russia
to set up an independent body
to investigate.
Mary Robinson, the U.N.
High Commissioner for Human
Rights, said Foreign Minister

Igor Ivanov asked her to show ;i
model for such a body.
But Ivanov reminded her
that Russia considers Chechnya
an internal problem.
"We will never allow this
problem to be used as a pretext
for interference into Russia's
domestic affairs," he said.
Russia is under increasing
international pressure to inves
tigate allegations that its troops
in Chechnya have executed

civilians, tortured detainees
and gone on rampages of rape
I lie Council of Europe, the
continent's top human rights
body, is expected to vote this
week on whether or not to sus
pend Russia over its Chechnya
campaign.
Suspension would be a blow
to Russia's image and its rela
tions with the West.
Robinson said a three-dav

weekend trip to Chechnya and
the neighboring republic of
Ingushetia overwhelmed her
with convincing accounts of
abuses.
"I w;is shocked and appalled
by the harrowing accounts of
the Chechen civilians," Robin
son said in a statement.
"I listened to testimony of
suinmar\ executions, intimida
tion. looting by military person
nel. disproportionate use of

force, attacks on civilian con
voys, rape and other viola
tions," she said.
She said Russian officials
barred her from visiting some
areas in Chechnya. These areas
includ Grozny's neighborhood
of Aldy.
Russian troops allegedly
killed scores of civilians in the
neighborhood in February.
Russian officials previously
said that Robinson was unable

to go to Aldy because of securi
ty concerns.
Ivanov said that Russia was
attempting to be as accommo
dating as possible.
"I cannot remember even
one case in international prac
tice in which a government of a
country solving its internal
problem would have been so
open for cooperation with
international organizations," he
said.
