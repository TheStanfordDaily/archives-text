## The
						Stanford Daily Crangle verdict encourages future dialogue 
### 
Amidst the allegations of discrimination
currently under investigation by the
U.S. Department of Labor, it looks as it
the University will experience another
setback. Just last Thursday, a unanimous San Jose
jury awarded former Medical School researcher
Colleen (Irangle $545,000 in punitive and com
pensatory damages on the basis that she had been
fired in retaliation for her allegations of gender
discrimination.
Pending appeal, this verdict was one of the
largest for a case of this kind. Judge James Ware
dismissed (Irangle's allegations of gender discrim

grounds for such a claim. The decision does bring
attention to a very serious and unacceptable prob

and effectively. I lowever, we should take care not
to extrapolate too much from this verdict alone —
about the issue of retaliation as well as discrimina
tion — until we hear all the facts.
Admittedly, this verdict should make it easier
lor those facing similar problems of discrimina
tion to come into the open and voice their con
cerns. Furthermore, this verdict, if understood in
the context of the Labor Department investiga
tion, hints at a disturbing condition of a potential
ly institutionalized bias on this campus.
Regardless of whether all those claims are fully
substantiated, the University should take immedi
ate steps to root out the problem, if one does exist,
and to prevent one from coining up in the future.
The University should also strengthen internal
procedures with the purpose of providing a safe
mechanism for employees to voice complaints and

clear up any misunderstandings that may arise.
In this regard, the statement of incoming Uni
versity President John Hennessy at the press con
ference announcing his appointment, that, "[The
University has] zero toleration for discrimination
and zero tolerance for retaliation," is an important
first step.
It is important to recognize, however, that this
is only a first step. The University must make
every effort to continue this process to ensure that
those who consider themselves affected by dis
crimination at Stanford may be re-assured of the
University's continuing commitment to its com
munity's well-being.
Nevertheless, at this point it would not be fair
to make an assumption that there is indeed a
widespread and severe problem of discrimination
at this University. To begin with, it is only fair to

point out that the Judge did dismiss Crangle's
allegations of gender discrimination and that the
jury ruled only on the issue of retaliation —
which, of course, is still a serious issue.
In addition, there is also the possibility of an
appeal on the grounds that "prejudicial and fun
damentally irrelevant" testimony was allowed,
according to acting general counsel Debra
Zumwait. At the least, it would only be fair to wait
for the results of the investigation itself before
placing our own judgment on the University.
Still, no matter what the court's ultimate find
ing, eliminating discrimination must remain a top
priority at the University; the fact that students,
faculty, and others associated with the University
perceive discrimination, whether it exists in the
eyes of the court or not, makes it an issue that
Stanford must continue to address.
