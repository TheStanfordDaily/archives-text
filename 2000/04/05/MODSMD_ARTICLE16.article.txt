# THERE IS NO SPOON
## Dear Mr. President 
### 
As the first Daily columnist to
congratulate Provost Hennessy
on his appointment to the pres
idency of Stanford University,
let me also be the first to apprise him of
some of his lesser-known duties.
Yes, the president of Stanford lias to
have meetings with James Montoya and
stuff. Probably has to deal with budget
thingees, too.
But the president also has a wide
range of other responsibilities to the
undergraduate population of this fine

institution.
For example, Presi
dent Hennessy must
appear in Gaieties. A
strong Stanford tradi
tion dating back to for
mer President Ray
Lyman Wilbur's infa
mous "Brainier Sucks"
line in 1917, Gaieties
has always featured the
University's president.

And while President Hennessy doesn't
need to have the...w...improvised melo
dramatics of Gerhard Gasper, I would
strongly suggest he really buckle down
over the summer and take an acting ( lass
or two. Since this upcoming Gaieties will
be President llennessy's debut, I'd sug
gest a nice ballad or maybe an up-tempo
tap number.
II President Hennessy wanted, I'm
sure we could even work him into this
year's Ram's Head Spring Musical, "Pip
pin." \V'e would definitely be able to make
room for him, especially if he wanted to
wear some serious pimp-daddy clothes
with some freaky (and nearly nekkid)
undergrads.
And speaking of the arts, how about
some support? At first, 1 was worried
about Hennessy's solid background in
engineering. But if he can come up with
Bio-X, why not Music-X or Drama-X?
just think of it as intet-inter-interdisci
plinary engineering. As last Friday's "An
Art Affair" showed, the Stanford campus
is brimming with artistic talent that
doesn't want Stanford to become the
MIT of the West.
President Hennessy is on the board of
some pretty big engineering companies,
including Microsoft. Just wheedle some
more dough out of old Bill "Moneybags"
Gates. Tell him you'll name another
building after him. The Gates Theater
has a nice ring to it.
And speaking of building, another big
issue President Hennessy needs to tackle
is housing. Right now, annual rent on a
two bedroom apartment in Palo Alto,
Menlo Park or Mountain View is more

than the Gross National Product of
Bolivia. Honest. Look ii up if you don't
believe me.
But instead of whining about the lack
of housing, I've come up with a perfectly
implementable plan.
Instead of the headaches and worries
of constructing on campus (what with all
the people complaining about the
Foothills and such), why not just buy out
University Avenue? I mean, it's already
called UNIVERSITY Avenue. You could
leave Jing-Jing's, Miyake, Pluto's, and
that gelato place and turn the rest of the
street into low-income (read: graduate)
housing.
Think of it. All the grad students could
be snobby and live in their own little
shanty town. They already have their
own transportation with safety gear (bikes
and bike helmets).
And you know they'll be quiet enough
for the nearby Palo Alto residents. Just
have the Marguerite run 24 hours a day.
It's a small price to pay.
And just think of how this housing
boom will benefit the rest of campus
(read: undergrads). VVe could turn
Schwab, Rains, and Escondido Village
into more undergrad housing — actually,
we probably wouldn't want EV.
All of Wilbur could then become large
ass singles. And Roble? Lhree-room dou
bles. Schwab would become the new Mir
i ielies. Sigh. We could probably even give
a dorm or two to some deserving frater
nity or sorority.
Of course, what President Hennessy
really needs to do is pay some regular,
average Joe, just your run of the mill
undergrad who'll graduate in June,
obscene amounts of money to join his
cabinet. And, yes, I'll accept his offer.
( The selfless things I'll do for my school.)
I'd be happy to work with our new
president to solve some of those unan
swerable student problems, like why does
our student union suck? Or why aren't
Business School students handicapped
more at IM games? And I'd be happy to
work for a low six-figure salary. Really.
So, yeah. We've got a new president.
I'm sure he's qualified. (Let's face it; it's
not that big of a stretch from provost.) I
just hope that in next year's Gaieties he
can do the Macarena as well as Casper.

Adrian is a senior majoring in English with an
emphasis in (Creative Writing, lie really wasn't
kidding about putting Hennessy into Pippin
(which will he playing April 7, 8, 13, 14, and
15 in Memorial Auditorium). Shoot, Adrian
will even put Casper in if he really wants. Just
let him know at adriank@stanford.edu.
