Daily columnist abuses satire
Ordinarily, I would try to write a sub
tle and ironic critique of Chris Maloney's
column on the lolly of Stanford students,
but satire died the moment The Daily
published his latest piece. Chris's inept
and clumsy attempt to employ satiric
techniques has offended not only my own
sensibilities as an English major, but also
countless generations of venerable
authors and scholars who have looked
beyond Webster's for an understanding
of this literary form. We are all dumber
for having read his column, and may God
have mercy on his soul.

Post office making progress
I'm probably the most outspoken crit
ic of the Stanford post office, so I think it's
only fair that I compliment the U.S.
Postal Service for all the progress made
since February. Waiting times have
dropped from an hour 01 more to less
than five minutes, packages are delivered
much more efficiendy, and most of the
employees are downright friendly.
Jeffrey Lelevich, post office operations
manager for the San Francisco district,
has worked overtime to reform the cam
pus post office and his efforts are paying

oil. Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, Sena
tor Dianne Feinstein, and their respective
stalls also deserve our thanks for helping
reform the post office, as does Associate
Provost Chris Christofferson.
The effort is far from completed, but I
iliink the U.S. Postal Service now realizes
the severity of the problem and is moving
in the right direction.
Last week, I presented evidence to Mr.
Lelevich that management in (lie Stan
ford substation intercepted complaint
forms and did not forward them along to
the district office. 1 identified one manag
er in particular, and Mr. Lelevich is inves
tigating further. That may explain (at
least partially) why the Stanford substa
tion had never been identified as a prob
lem by upper management.
Moreover, the Postal Inspection Ser
vice is now aware of the problems in the
Stanford substation. The inspectors were
asked to investigate illegally discarded
mail and have since received reports of
mail theft, mail tampering, and credit
card fraud.
Some employees have been re
assigned and, depending on the outcome
of the investigation, some may ultimately
be fired or charged with federal crimes.
One employee with a particularly long
history of mistreating customers has been
transferred from the Stanford substation.
Finally, my earlier concerns about a
conflict of interest between Robert Reed

and Julie Reed were misplaced, and I
apologize to both of them. Mr. Reed was
acting manager of post office operations
for two weeks in February during Mr.
Lelevich's absence, and Mrs. Reed's
assignment in customer service was tem
porary. Neither of them had any reason
to know about the long-standing prob
lems in the Stanford post office and their
positions in the same chain of command
were short-term and coincidental.
There are good employees within the
U.S. Postal Service, and the last thing I
want to do is blame the good guys.
