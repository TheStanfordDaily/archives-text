# FROM APATHY TO ACTIVISM
## What you didn't know about student voice

Daily use in a long time. Yet Universit\ president, while
il may be high-profile, is onlv one <>l a plethora of liigh
level administrative positions Stanford has had to iill
over the past two years. Provost, C T() ol Stanford Man
agement Company, vice provost for Undergraduate
Education, dean of Admissions X: 112 inancial Aid, the
deans of Engineering, Law, Medicine, the Craduatc
School of Business, I lumanitics & Sciences and more
— all have been replaced while I've been at Stanford.
I his changing ol the guard is already having a
tremendous impact on students, even il we aren't
always aware <>l it. But, even though students are the
primary constituent \ for some of these positions, stu
dent voice in the search process has consistenth been
minimal or absent. At a I niversit\ that professes to
value openness and democracy, students should have
much greater influence in choosing and holding
accountable the people w ho make decisions about our
lives.
One avenue thai is supposed to help ensure that
students have a voice is \<>in( loin, the .\SSI Nomina
tions Commission. N'omCom members, all students,
are chosen by our elected representative body, the
ASSI . I lie commission is responsible for interviewing
and nominating student members to sit on the Uni
versity's permanent and ad hot committees. The pur
pose of this svsteni is to nominate members who will
represent (as much as possible) the concerns ol the
entire student body, not just their personal views.
I nfbrtunatelv, the I niversit\ administration feels
itscll under no obligation to go through NomCom
when choosing students for ad hoc committees; they
are just as likely to siniph appoint a student "repre
sentative'' based on whatever criteria the\ like. All the
search committees for the positions I mentioned above
were ad hot committees.
for a few of them — the deans of Engineering and
ol Admissions, for example — NoniC oni was allowed
lo < I loose the student members. But Ibr others, includ
ing some of the most high-profile and arguabh most
important to students — such as president, provost
and, most recently. Haas Center director—adminis
trators by-passed NoinCoin and selected student
members themselves.
Even when students on seaitli committees are
there as representatives, the strict t <>nficleutialitv that is
often required isolates them from their constituents,
which hampers their efforts at advocating fbi all stu
dents' concerns. In addition, some \it;il I ni\ersit\
institutions — notahh the Board of trustees, which
administers our 54.7 billion endowment — have no
student representation whatsoever

And student input into the choice of Stanford's new
CEO, w hose salary is more than twice that of the pres
ident? Don't even ask. Why should you have any say
in how the University spends its money? After all,
you're only giving Stanford SI ,000 a week . ..
These issues of student voice typically don't get
much attention, but every s<> often something hap
pens to make them flare up. Last spring, it was the
selection of a new provost. Condoleezza Kite, an
avowed opponent of affirmative action policies in
tenure decisions (a policy which helped lead to the
current federal investigation of Stanford for possible
violations of U.S. Department of Labor laws), had
stepped down, and students across campus saw an
opportunity to hire a provost with a strong commit
ment to diversity at Stanford.
But the University did not go through NomCom to
select students for the provost search committee.
1 hough we could not have asked for a more dedicat
ed advocate than former ASSU President Maren Nor
ton, one of the selected members, the selection
method was still a slap in the face to students.
So students organized. We formed a coalition and
collected — in about two davs — several thousand stu
dent signatures calling for a new provost, one who was
c < >minitted to a diverse faculty and research and schol
arship in cultural studies, and compliance with federal
affirmative action laws. We were not allowed to meet
with the search committee or to find out anything
about the candidates thev were considering, but we
made sure they knew how main students saw these
issues as top priorities.
But did all our efforts matter? Did they have any
influence on the decision? I don't know, primarily
because search committees possess a second obstacle to
student voice and accountability: the proceedings and
selection process are often secret. What this lack of
transparency means is that we don't know if the thou
sands of student voices calling for a commitment to
diversity were even heard. Maybe they were a crucial
file tor in the dec ision. Maybe the committee chucked
them in the garbage. Certainly, when we presented
copies of the petition to the newly chosen provost, lie
had never seen nor heard of them before.
So did we have anv effect? Well, I hope so. because
the candidate who was chosen for provost last year —
|ohn 1 lei messy — will soon be our next president.
And, il anything, students have had even less input
into the presidential search process than we did with
the provost. Administrators again by passed Nom( loin,
and again the candidates' identities and the method by
which the committee arrived at its recommendation
were kept secret.
And though Presidential Search Committee mem
bers had said that student input was very important to
them, only a single forum was held at
which students were asked to name gener
al qualities they thought candidates should
have hardly qualifies. Why even bother to
give our "input" when we don't know how
— or whether — it's going to be used?
And now that Hennessy has been

tagged for president, how will the next
provost be chosen? I'll make yon a bet:
unless students raise a real ruckus, pretty
much the same way as the last one, with no
transparency and no real student repre
sentation.
The current installment of this saga is
the search for the next director of the
Haas Center for Public Service. Once
again, the selection process has not ade
quately involved student input. NomClom
— of course — was bypassed. Students
had no say in the job description, even

though a large part of the job involves
interacting with and providing support
for student groups.
Now we are faced with a situation in
which four finalists have already been
selected without substantial student par
ticipation. Dedicated students argued for
and won the right to interview these four
candidates face to face, but this is only a
first step toward adequate student partic -
ipation; the rest remains to be seen.
If you think you should have a say in
choosing these administrators — people

who will decide how much your tuition is,
what professors you can take classes from,
whether you'll have housing — then these
issues are something to take seriously. The
University needs to become more account
able to students in its administrative
appointments.
Consistently going through NomCom
for all student committee appointments
would be a good start. Ensuring that stu
dents on search committees have a
chance to affect the outcome, and allow
ing students to hold committees account

able to this standard, is another step. Stu
dent representatives on the Board of
Trustees might be another — you get the
picture. But, if you want any of this, you
— and everyone else who wants it — will
have to work for it, shout for it, struggle
for it.
Democracy never comes easy.
