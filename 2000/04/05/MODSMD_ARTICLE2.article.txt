# Praising Casper
## Students and faculty remember Casper's accomplishments 
### DEENA SKOLNICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Following John I lennessy's appointment
as the 10th president of Stanford Universi
ty, some Stanford faculty and administra
tors took time to reflect on President (ler
hard Casper's seven years at the University.
"I think the President faced an amazing
challenge in being an 'outsider' coining
into the Stanford community, and he han
dled it beautifully," said Vice Provost for
Student Affairs James Montoya.
Malcolm Beasley, dean of the School of
1 lumanities and Sciences, agreed.
"It was quite a presidency to go from
dealing with earlier problems to charting
new directions," he said
Beasley referred to the indirect cost scan

dal during Donald Kennedy's presidency,
in which the federal government investigat
ed Stanford's misappropriation of govern
ment research money. Many members of

the faculty saw the scandal
and the subsequent nega
tive public attitude to
wards Stanford as major
hurdles at the beginning
of Casper's tenure.
A 1993 Daily news
analysis speculated that
Casper would have diffi
culty with his first tasks as
president, which were "to

improve the University's tarnished public
image, restore a fair relationship with the
government and boost confidence in a
community jarred by scandal."
By the end of his first year, Casper had
shown his ability to meet these challenges. A
Daily poll conducted in June of 1993 re
vealed that Stanford students felt Casper's


Casper
most significant accomplishment
was "keeping Stanford out of the
public eye."
Vice Provost for Undergradu
ate Kducation john Bravman cites
Casper's repair of the University's
relationship with the federal gov
ernment as one of the three major
highlights of Casper's tenure.
The other two achievements
with which Bravman credits
(lasper are a complete overhaul of
the freshman and sophomore
years at Stanford and a reorgani
zation of Stanford's graduate fel
lowships.
He calls this List effort "the
most crucial and long-reaching"
aspect of Casper's presidency.
()ther members of the adminis
tration place emphasis on
Casper's attention to Stanford's
undergraduates, and particularly
to freshman and sophomore edu
cation, as a characteristic that will
define his time at the university.
"I diversities have to ask what

they want in their presidents,"
Casper told The Daily after Ik* was
selected in 1993.
"If they want a person who
shows up in every corner and
gives speeches in every corner,
that is one model," he said. "But if
they want a president who worries
about the substance of the acade
mic enterprise then they have to
reduce their demands."
"The two cannot be recon
ciled," Casper added.
Casper's adherence to the lat
ter model has won him praise
from his colleagues and optimism
about the impact he has had on
Stanford.
"Certainly his commitment to
enhancing undergraduate educa
tion has been a highlight of his
presidency," Montova said. He
cited freshman and sophomore
seminars, sophomore college, the
President's Scholars program,
changes in residential education
and Casper's bedtime stories as
examples of his influence on Stan
ford's undergraduates.
According to Montoya, "what we
will most remember will be . . . his

ability to build an undergraduate
program in a research university
setting that provides undergradu
ates in the earliest stages oft heir ed
ucation the opportunity to work
closely with the University's most
well-known faculty members."
Beasley agreed. "1 think the
emphasis on undergraduate edu
cation really changed the land
scape of the lower division, espe
cially the freshman and sopho
more years," he said.
"Clearly, his contributions to
undergraduate education and to
the humanities at Stanford have
been substantial and will change
this place."
Beasley attributes a current re
examination of the structure of
the Stanford undergraduate
major to Casper's focus on fresh
man and sophomore education.
"We're seeing what we can do
to carry forward that momentum
through the rest of the under
graduate years," he said.
When asked what Casper
might have done differently din
ing his time as president, Brav
man replied, "Nothing."
