# FROM THE PRISON OF HOPE
## A 						letter to our president 
### OM KUNDU GUEST COLUMNIST 
Dear Provost Hennessy,
Please accept my hearty congratulations on being
selected as Stanford's 10th president. As I hope you
already know, hate mail has deluged our in-boxes
again. Certainly, not lor the first time. Probably not
tor the last time either.
But why does the majority of this campus and the
administration have to sii up and take notice as if the
racism that these e-mails exhibit is a bolt from the
blue? Why have we suddenly started to wonder how
the authors of the hate mail that lias been circulated
several times on this campus can aflbrd to be so mis
informed and ignorant?
To me, and several others like myself who have to
constantly suffer under the minority label, there is
nothing new about this manifestation of ignorance
and misinformation.
We have confronted the rampant ignorance about
our cultural and intellectual backgrounds time and
again, all too often, such that the novelty is gone. We
only wish that there were more than just temporal)
attempts to make up for the hate mail, that its treat
ment as an undesirable accident displayed a little less
naivete, that there was actually a committed and sus
tained effort to address the larger issues.
"Human kind," as F.S. Kliot put it, "cannot bear
too much reality." I hope we have the courage to bear
this one. Racism is something that students assigned
the "minority" label at Stanford have to deal with on
a day-in and day-out basis, in its explicit and implicit
forms, over and on top of the academic, social and
extra-curricular challenges they already face here.
And, in most cases, there are no tangible ways to
deal with the "burden of proof." More often than not,
there is no smoking gun. And even when there is,
most of us are terrorized into silence lest we be per
ceived as politically provocative — anarchist voices
trying to subvert the absolutely fine status quo.
Even today, we have to struggle relentlessly to
make the point to our peers that the issue can neither
be addressed by the apathy or indifference of silence
nor the political correctness of condescending toler
ance or even pity. It is, simply put, an issue of basic
intellectual and social respect to be treated 011 equal
footing by fellow students, faculty, scholars and work
ers — who are all part of the Stanford community.
I must add that, among other things, 1 speak from
my personal experience. 1 also speak from the emo
tionally traumatic experience that I have seen some of
my best friends have to grapple with at Stanford.
Experiences where they have been personally
attacked and victimized while the perpetrators have
been defended by the rhetoric of freedom of expres
sion and the First Amendment. Experiences that have
assumed such overwhelming proportions in their
lives that their academic pursuits have been held
hostage, and they have had to pay the price by drop
ping out of Stanford.
Speaking of personal experience, a former editor

in chief of The Stanford Review once literally caused
me to throw up over dinner by commenting that
there is not much that could l)e done about people
starving to death in sub-Saharan Africa because, after
all, there are just too many people doomed to starve
there anyway. Even The Daily, in its turn, has never
failed to flaunt full-page ads on a frighteningly regu
lar basis for sperm and egg-donors who conform to
certain racially exclusive physical attributes.
And, even as 1 realize that the editorial decisions of
The Daily and The Review are not something a Uni
versity president can have much of a say in, I wonder
how much has actually been done at an institutional
and social level to address this misinformation and
prejudice beyond the lip-service of culture-nights that
often serve to re-inforce ethnic stereotypes, further
exotic izing and mythologizing minority cultures.
Sometimes, as members of a minority community,
it seems that the sole purpose of our presence here is
to be conveniently picked and prodded as curio items
in a museum or near-extinct specimens in a zoologi
cal collection that need to be cordoned off from the
rest of the University population. Attempts to engage
in meaningful intellectual conversation, more often
than not, raise eyebrows — a gesture that seeks to
remind us of our special minority status. Such
responses end up silencing our voices.
And these attempts to silence have been systemat
ic. For that matter, it has been a historical legacy at
Stanford. In a struggle lasting for more than two
decades, minority students have passionately and tire
lessly argued for further ethnic studies resources to
establish discourses of African, Asian, Native Ameri
can and Latin American cultures. But all their intel
lectual passion was contained by a never-ending
bureaucratic tirade of letters, proposals, pet it ions and
committee deliberations. Finally, when all of that
came to nothing, students launched a hunger strike to
herald what is now the Program for Comparative
Studies of Race and Ethnicity.
Even today I am confronted by students, faculty
and scholars alike who think ethnic studies is some
form of political concession for minority interests that
dilutes Stanford's intellectual rigor. I have to struggle
to explain that the reason I feel Stanford has histori
cally had departments dealing with English, French,
German and Italian scholarship is exactly the same
reason why we need to have departments for cultures
that owe their roots to diverse regions of Africa, East
Asia, Latin America, Native America, the Middle East
and South Asia.
The only difference is that, while the former have
had automatic intellectual validity, the latter have
needed demonstrations, sit-ins, candle-light vigils
and, finally, hunger strikes to gain attention and
become established. And, even today, we struggle to
justify their presence in academia.
Our pursuit of truth about the human condition is
incomplete, and therefore inaccurate, without incor
porating the intellectual, social, cultural and political
thought that has arisen across the oceans
and the continents. That thought, and the
study of that thought, is neither intellectu
ally diluted nor a political concession for
minorities on this campus.
At a personal level, a friend of mine
asked what it would take to have studies on
South Asia, home to a sixth of humanity,
established as a formal discourse of study
at Stanford. I candidly admitted that,
given Stanford's past history, I didn't have
very high expectations of that happening
before we made the headlines for yet
another student-led hunger strike.
While I still hope that does not turn out
to be true, even today when I look at the
Overseas Studies Program that Stanford
offers so that undergraduates can gain a
better understanding of the rest of the
world by a first-hand experience, I set- five
programs in Europe, one on the entire
continent of Asia and none whatsoever in
Africa. None?
(To be fair, there are also three pro
grams in Latin America. But from the
experience that some of my close 112 riends in
the centers have related to me, these pro
grams are often too sheltered and com
fortable for a student to actually see the
real face of Latin America.)
But there is more to the outrage than
just this.
After four years of enduring Stanford, I
have to struggle to confront the greatest
myth in educational conditioning —
namely, that the extent to which 1 can be a
productive member of civilized society is
contingent on the extent to which I can
conform to the self-purportedly liberal, sci

entific and democratic ideals and norms of
Western civilization. While Western civi
lization may, indeed, be "a good idea," are
the rest not even worth considering? Are
they really that illiberal, unscientific and
undemocratic?
Why do 1 even bring this up? "West
ern cultures" tnav have been theoretical
ly dismantled at Stanford, but, even
today, we are hard-pressed to find cours
es that reflect the intellectual diversity of
our student body. Be it scholarship
through courses in classics that go
beyond lireek and Latin and are willing
to consider Arabic, Sanskrit, or Yoruban,
courses in philosophy that go beyond
Western analytical discourse, courses in
science and engineering that deal with
appropriate technologies for the devel
oping world, or, for that matter, even
courses in dance-forms that derive from
Eastern traditions — all of these are
largely absent at Stanford.
In our intellectual endeavors, we are
similarlv hard pressed to find mentors
with comparable intellectual backgrounds,
who have endured the struggle and share
our intellectual and cultural experiences
and have expanded the canon with inno
vative and non-traditional scholarship.
More fundamentally, is there really a point
in having a diverse student body if we, stu
dents from minority backgrounds, cannot
find tenured professors as intellectual
mentors and scholars — role models we
can hope to emulate?
Instead of taking swift action to remedy
the pressing issue of lack <>l women and
minority faculty, Stanford has denied
tenure to women and minority faculty who
have been some of the foremost scholars in
their fields. The University has resorted to
the all-too-familiar bureaucratic strategy of
endless committee deliberations — even if
the cost has meant putting its own reputa
tion at stake by subjecting itself to federal

investigations for discrimination and
expensive protracted legal battles with the
U.S. Department of Labor.
()n the other end of the labor spectrum,
the situation does not seem any brighter.
Let us be honest with ourselves. Let us, for
a change, openly acknowledge that the
dining staff in our cafeterias and the jani
tors who clean our toilets, in no insignifi
cant sense, keep this University up and
running; that they are mostly Latino and
Black; and, yet, that they are the ones who
have to work under the distressing condi
tions of minimal wages, constant job inse
curities and lay-off threats.
Even as we have held elaborate pro
grams that seek to "inform" members of
the Stanford community about the 50th
anniversary of Universal Declaration of
Human Rights of the United Nations and
invited Kofi Annan for Convocation, our
Athletics Department continues to thrive
with sponsorships from multi-national cor
porations that engage in egregious human
rights violations in the work force in devel
oping countries. If that is not a travesty in
and of itself, I must then also add that
these are the very countries in which sev
eral minority communities trace their cul
tural background.
For years we have been told that the
decision to divest is a political one that
Stanford, as an institution of higher learn
ing, cannot aflbrd to make. But if the deci
sion to divest is political, surely the decision
not to make a decision is also equally, if not
more, political. Today, when I even bring
up the possibility that a brief video clip of
labor conditions in sweatshop factories
around the world be shown before Sunday
night Flicks to add some perspective to this
"information," I am branded by certain
students as the spoil-sport "Brownie Indi
an guy" with subversive ideas.
I wonder whether anything has
changed at all from what happened more

than half a decade ago when MeCliA
asked that "No Grapes" be shown in Flicks
to inform Stanford students about use of
pesticides on table grapes — only to be
responded to with, "Beaners go back
home!" and other, worse racial epithets.
With forums that seek to address issues
of the developing world — be it the Food
Research Institute or the SWOPSI work
shops— being effectively killed on the pre
text of budget constraint and student-initi
ated multicultural groups like "Cross-Cul
tures" having failed due to lack of ade
quate support, can there be any surprise at
all in the ignorance and misinformation? 1
think not.
Stanford has been, consciously and oth
erwise, institutionally preparing members
of the student body for this — a segregat
ed campus upon which students choose to
live and have relationships with peers who
acquiesce to the dominant ideologies, cul
tural beliefs, and inherent prejudices.
Stanford's student community is one in
which the majority of students choose to
affiliate with only those members of the
minority community who choose to con
form and be assimilated. This community
is one in which we exacerbate the segrega
tion by self-selecting our draw groups lor
living in dorms and dining in cafeterias.
And, by carrying on in this manner, we
conveniently skirt the real issues of intel
lectual difference and alternative world
view — those that represent our cultural
roots and life-experiences — with our
deafening silences. There is, I feel, no
room within such a student community for
difference and diversity in the true philo
sophical sense.
Don't get me wrong. Stanford is still an
institution that 1 would have really liked to
take pride in as my alma mater, one that I
would have liked to have had a sense of
belonging to, and one where I would have
liked to have seen the "winds of freedom"

blow.
But, if that freedom is going to be more
than just rhetorical, it has to be the intel
lectual freedom and respect for all and not
just a select few.
Freedom to acknowledge that our pur
suit of truth is not truly multicultural if our
ideologies cannot draw equally from civi
lizational paradigms of all cultures, East
and West.
Freedom to admit that our quest to dis
cover the reality of the human condition is
self-defeating if it is primarily based on the
concerns of the affluent, privileged, and
"developed" communities in this country
and across the world.
Freedom to open our eyes to the reality
of institutional forces of oppression that
exist within our status quo. Freedom to lis
ten to the voices and concerns of the hith
erto marginalized and silenced, among
others.
Freedom to act and remedy the fla
grant inequities of race and gender, of
economy and privilege.
As the incoming president, Provost
I lennessy, please let us know that our voic
es are not fading into oblivion but rather
that they are actually being heard,
acknowledged and acted upon to engen
der the conditions that can, indeed, make
those winds of freedom blow.
