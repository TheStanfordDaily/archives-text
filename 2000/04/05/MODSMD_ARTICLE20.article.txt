# FROM THE PRISON OF HOPE
## A
						letter to our president 
### OM KUNDU GUEST COLUMNIST 
Dear Provost Hennessy,
Please accept my hearty congratulations on being
selected as Stanford's 10th president. As I hope you
already know, hate mail has deluged our in-boxes
again. Certainly, not lor the first time. Probably not
tor the last time either.
But why does the majority of this campus and the
administration have to sii up and take notice as if the
racism that these e-mails exhibit is a bolt from the
blue? Why have we suddenly started to wonder how
the authors of the hate mail that lias been circulated
several times on this campus can aflbrd to be so mis
informed and ignorant?
To me, and several others like myself who have to
constantly suffer under the minority label, there is
nothing new about this manifestation of ignorance
and misinformation.
We have confronted the rampant ignorance about
our cultural and intellectual backgrounds time and
again, all too often, such that the novelty is gone. We
only wish that there were more than just temporal)
attempts to make up for the hate mail, that its treat
ment as an undesirable accident displayed a little less
naivete, that there was actually a committed and sus
tained effort to address the larger issues.
"Human kind," as F.S. Kliot put it, "cannot bear
too much reality." I hope we have the courage to bear
this one. Racism is something that students assigned
the "minority" label at Stanford have to deal with on
a day-in and day-out basis, in its explicit and implicit
forms, over and on top of the academic, social and
extra-curricular challenges they already face here.
And, in most cases, there are no tangible ways to
deal with the "burden of proof." More often than not,
there is no smoking gun. And even when there is,
most of us are terrorized into silence lest we be per
ceived as politically provocative — anarchist voices
trying to subvert the absolutely fine status quo.
Even today, we have to struggle relentlessly to
make the point to our peers that the issue can neither
be addressed by the apathy or indifference of silence
nor the political correctness of condescending toler
ance or even pity. It is, simply put, an issue of basic
intellectual and social respect to be treated 011 equal
footing by fellow students, faculty, scholars and work
ers — who are all part of the Stanford community.
I must add that, among other things, 1 speak from
my personal experience. 1 also speak from the emo
tionally traumatic experience that I have seen some of
my best friends have to grapple with at Stanford.
Experiences where they have been personally
attacked and victimized while the perpetrators have
been defended by the rhetoric of freedom of expres
sion and the First Amendment. Experiences that have
assumed such overwhelming proportions in their
lives that their academic pursuits have been held
hostage, and they have had to pay the price by drop
ping out of Stanford.
Speaking of personal experience, a former editor

in chief of The Stanford Review once literally caused
me to throw up over dinner by commenting that
there is not much that could l)e done about people
starving to death in sub-Saharan Africa because, after
all, there are just too many people doomed to starve
there anyway. Even The Daily, in its turn, has never
failed to flaunt full-page ads on a frighteningly regu
lar basis for sperm and egg-donors who conform to
certain racially exclusive physical attributes.
And, even as 1 realize that the editorial decisions of
The Daily and The Review are not something a Uni
versity president can have much of a say in, I wonder
how much has actually been done at an institutional
and social level to address this misinformation and
prejudice beyond the lip-service of culture-nights that
often serve to re-inforce ethnic stereotypes, further
exotic izing and mythologizing minority cultures.
Sometimes, as members of a minority community,
it seems that the sole purpose of our presence here is
to be conveniently picked and prodded as curio items
in a museum or near-extinct specimens in a zoologi
cal collection that need to be cordoned off from the
rest of the University population. Attempts to engage
in meaningful intellectual conversation, more often
than not, raise eyebrows — a gesture that seeks to
remind us of our special minority status. Such
responses end up silencing our voices.
And these attempts to silence have been systemat
ic. For that matter, it has been a historical legacy at
Stanford. In a struggle lasting for more than two
decades, minority students have passionately and tire
lessly argued for further ethnic studies resources to
establish discourses of African, Asian, Native Ameri
can and Latin American cultures. But all their intel
lectual passion was contained by a never-ending
bureaucratic tirade of letters, proposals, pet it ions and
committee deliberations. Finally, when all of that
came to nothing, students launched a hunger strike to
herald what is now the Program for Comparative
Studies of Race and Ethnicity.
Even today I am confronted by students, faculty
and scholars alike who think ethnic studies is some
form of political concession for minority interests that
dilutes Stanford's intellectual rigor. I have to struggle
to explain that the reason I feel Stanford has histori
cally had departments dealing with English, French,
German and Italian scholarship is exactly the same
reason why we need to have departments for cultures
that owe their roots to diverse regions of Africa, East
Asia, Latin America, Native America, the Middle East
and South Asia.
The only difference is that, while the former have
had automatic intellectual validity, the latter have
needed demonstrations, sit-ins, candle-light vigils
and, finally, hunger strikes to gain attention and
become established. And, even today, we struggle to
justify their presence in academia.
Our pursuit of truth about the human condition is
incomplete, and therefore inaccurate, without incor
porating the intellectual, social, cultural and political
