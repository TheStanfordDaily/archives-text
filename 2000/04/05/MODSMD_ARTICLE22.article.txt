## Marco Takes Her Aim at Stanford 
### ALEX BENJAMIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After falling from a loft at age
five and sustaining injuries to her
neck and back, doctors told fresh
man Michelle Marco that she
would never be able to play any
contact sports again. Yet, despite
such limitations, she has found
another sport in which she can
excel: archery
For four consecutive years,
from 1995-to 1999, she has been
both the California State Cham
pion and Pacific Coast Champion
for girls ages 15-18, and in 1997,
she won the Indoor National
Championships.
However, since coming to
Stanford, Marco has graduated
from the Junior Division and is
currently competing in the Colle
giate Division. But, the change
has had little effect on her domi
nance over the sport.
In January she became the
California State Champion and
Western Regional Champion at
the collegiate level. Although na
tional rankings have not yet come
out, it is likely that she will be
somewhere among the top 10
collegiate women archers in the
nation.
"For me, it is a passion," Marco
said. "Archery has been the most
wonderful and miraculous expe
rience that has ever happened to
me. It has allowed me to realize
my dream of being an athlete
when I was told as a little girl that
that would be impossible because
of my injuries."
It all began for Marco one
summer at camp when, expect
ing to be in the arts and crafts
class, she accidentally ended up
in the archery class, something
that she was not too pleased
about at the time. However, she
quickly realized her love for the
sport, and, after returning home
from camp, Marco joined the San
Diego Junior Olympic Archery
Team which she was a part of for
the last 11 years.
Yet, out of the 21 people on
the team, Marco was the only girl,
a circumstance that made her
even more determined to suc
ceed.
"It was a really good motiva

tion having all guys on the team.
Many times they didn't want the
'girl' to play with them," Marco
said. "As a result I had to shoot
better than them to gain accep
tance."
And all her work and determi
nations paid off. In the ninth
grade shejoined the National Ju
nior Team, which allowed lot her
to practice at the Olympic Train
ing Center in San Diego. This was
one of her most memorable and
rewarding experiences that she
remembered.
"It was amazing to me to be
able to train there. I can walk and
function better than most people
with physical handicaps," Marco
said. "And for me to walk in there
where it says 'athlete entrance,'
was a very emotional moment."
Despite her passion for
archery, her main focus right
now is school, with her ultimate
goal being to qualify for the
Olympics.
"The great thing about
archery is that age is not a factor,"
Marcos said. "It is a sport that can
be done for an entire lifetime."
Because of this, Marcos is in no
hurry to drop everything and
begin training. Yet, she does have
plans to try and qualify for either
the 2004 or 2008 Olympics. Right
now she figures that she will try to
finish her education first, and, be
fore heading out into the "real
world," she will take the time to
train. The idea of taking two
years out of her life— with the
possibility of not qualifying—
makes her a little nervous, but
that is not something she has con
cerned herself with yet.
In the meantime, Marco has
been working hard to implement
an archery team here on campus.
In January she contacted the Na
tional Archery Association (NAA)
and began the process of starting
a team. After establishing a team
with them, Marcos decided to
create a club through the Office
of Student Activities and the
ASSU. This is the beginning of a
program here at Stanford that
Marcos hopes will some day be
come a full time varsity sport.
However, in the meantime, they
have two years as a club before
the Athletic Department will con

sider sponsoring them as a dub
sport. Only after I his, can the
team be considered lor varsity
status.
As of now, the Archery (Hub
must travel 20 minutes awa\ to
Foothill Community College to
practice at the two available
times, Saturday nights or Mon
day, Wednesday and l rida\ from
(S to 10am. Neither of these times
are convenient to the team s
schedule. Marco, who has a class
at nine during the week, finds
herself having to get up at five in
the morning to be able to practice

Inr twenty minutes. Not exactly
an ideal situation.
However, the team is contin
ually looking for any new peo
ple that would like to join and
participate in the sport. Cur
rently, the team consist of six
people, three of which have had
years of experience and with
others that are just beginning.
With increased interest in the
club, Marco feels that someday it
could help reach her goal of
having Stanford Archery be
come a varsity sport with a place
to practice.
