The Stanford varsity sailing team
won every single race this weekend
to sweep the North Regional Elim
ination Tournament with a final
record of 4-0.
The sailing team defeated the
best teams in its region, including
California, UC-Santa Cruz and
San Jose State. The second placed
team at the regatta was Stanford's
B-team. Although the top-three
finishers qualify to compete at the
Pacific Coast Team Racing Cham
pionship, each school is only al
lowed to send one team to the
competition.
Three teams of two sailors com
peted for Stanford's A-team. Se
niors Katie Creggand Steve Kleha,
seniors Anika Leerson and Alexis
Krivkovich, and senior Tyler Doyle
and freshman Lindsey Andrews
contributed to Stanford's win.
With this weekend's perfor
mance, the Cardinal officially qual
ified for a spot in the Pacific Coast
Team Racing Championship, the

national qualifiying tournament,
on April 22 and 23 at Treasure Is
land. A top-two finish at the district
regatta would guarantee the team
a chance to compete at Nationals.
Women's Lacrosse
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team won the first of its three
games this weekend. The Cardinal
easily defeated St. Mary's 10-4 but
failed to come away with wins
against Denver and UC-Davis on
Saturday and Sunday.
The game on Saturday ran into
overtime as Stanford and Denver
fought to win a closely contested
game. Junior Katharine Barnes
and sophomore Caroline ()sterwise
each contributed four goals to lead
the Cardinal offense. Despite their
efforts, the Cardinal fell to the Pio
neers by a narrow margin of two
goals, with a final score of 14-1 (>.
On Sunday, the Cardinal suf
fered a disappointing conference
loss to the Aggies. Barnes and Os
terwise also led the scoring in this
game, with a tally of three goals
each. The outcome of this game
will likely adversely affect the Car
dinal in postseason rankings.
The Cardinal is now 6-7 on the
season. This weekend, it will host
the Western States Tournament at
home, with competition all day on
New Maloney Field.
