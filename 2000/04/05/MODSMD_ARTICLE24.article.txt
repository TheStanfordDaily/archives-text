# Bits of the Best
## 
### 
It's time for spring cleaning,
and I've been cleaning out
my 'bits of sports' drawer:
items too short to make a col
umn but too interesting to ignore.
The best and the brightest of
those:
• Given the rampant popularity of
auto racing in Europe and its
crowning as the new growth

sport in Ameri
ca by ESPN and
other networks,
and given that
ballroom danc
ing is an
Olympic exhib
ition sport, with
bridge soon to
follow, 1 think
it's only a mat-

ter of time before someone tries to
get NASCAR into the Olympic
ring. When that day comes, it's
possible the Greek gods may de
scend from Olympus itself to smite
the 1 ()(1 for sullying their name.
•We've seen the Pacific Ten Con
ference get disrespected in the
"money sports"—football and
men's basketball—at every turn
this year. You will not here those
complaints in Softball this year:
the top five spots in the national
coaches' poll are all held by Pacif
ic 10 Conference teams (Wash
ington, Arizona, UCLA, Califor
nia and Arizona State). Seven of
the top eleven spots are Pac-10-
held.
•Seeing how few of today's top
major league baseball players ac
tually go to college in the United
States and how many now spring
from baseball hotbeds like Cuba or
the Dominican Republic, I'm
pushing for a new overseas cam
pus - Stanford-in-Santo-Domingo.
From there, we can recruit a new
wave of Stanford prodigies, this
time on the baseball diamond. All
the big league teams have Domini
can baseball academies; we can
just be one step ahead of the col
lege world. And after that, Cuba.
•I submit that the varsity sport
that gets the least recognition on
this campus —and possibly on any
campus —is fencing. The NCAA
Championships for fencing were

hosted here over spring break,
and I'm not sure anyone knew
anything was happening at the
time. Our team finished fourth,
with Felix Reichling successfully
defending his foil title. Can you
imagine if we hosted, say, the foot
ball national championships? You
wouldn't have been able to throw a
brick without hitting some red
neck from Florida State.
•Compare the campus reaction to
Stanford's second-round exit
from the men's basketball tourna
ment to that on Purdue's campus,
where the team's Elite Eight loss to
Wisconsin sent rioting crowds into
the street, overturning cars and
setting things on fire, and you re
ally understand the luxury of hav
ing other teams besides men's bas
ketball to root for. There's just not
much else to do in Indiana. You
win? Riot. You lose? Riot. Techni
cal foul you don't like? Riot. Gene
Ready's hair mussed? Riot.
•Not enough outrage has been
generated over NBC's latest pur
chase of half of the XFL, a new
professional football league run by
Vince McMahon, owner of the
World Wrestling Federation.
What this means is that the man
who brought us The Rock and
Triple H is now going to be run
ning a major television network
during prime time on Saturday
nights. It is clearly only a matter of
time before trends converge, and
players in the XFT are actually re
quired to drive NASCAR cars onto
the field for substitutions.
•And let us pray that someday, the
Olympic committee decides to let
professionals into Olympic
wrestling, as they've done for
hockey and basketball and so
forth, and that some steroid-juiced
fool like The Rock tries to chal
lenge an Olympic wrestler as a
publicity stunt. I'd pay to see that
guy's legs tied behind his head in a
square knot. Then the Olympian
can eat those trademark sunglass
es.
•It has been remarked upon be
fore, but it should be said again:
what the tennis teams at t his school
