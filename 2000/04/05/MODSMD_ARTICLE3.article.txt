# Fac Sen simplifies grievance process on tenure decisions
## 
### JULIANA LIU STAFF WRITER 
Junior faculty members filing grievances on
tenure decisions may find the appeals process to be
clearer and more consistent this year.
During last week's Faculty Senate meeting,
Provost John Hennessy named six senior faculty
members to assist the future provost in answering
specific questions that arise from appeals.
The faculty members named during last Thurs
day's senate meeting are Molecular and Cellular
Physiology Prof. Richard Aldrich, Linguistics Prof.
Kve Clark, English Prof. Barbara Celpi, Mechanical
Engineering Prof. William Reynolds, Surgery Prof.
Oscar Salvatierra and Economics Prof. Gavin Wright.
These professors will be joined by six currently
unnnamed faculty members.

According to the Statement on Faculty Appeal
Procedures approved last June by the Board of
frustees, the provost may appoint a fact-finder to in
vestigate the matter before making a ruling on the
case. Once the fact-finder reports back, the provost
may then grant the appeal, remand the matter to a
lower level or refer it to the Advisory Board.
Fact-finders will replace the grievance officers,
who advised the provost under the old process. Like
the grievance officers, the fact-finders are a group of
consultants, but unlike the officers, the new members
have already agreed to serve.
"It's a revision of the previous system," Senior As
sociate Provost Kathy Cillani said. "The old appeals
process... was very ad-hoc in the sense that if a
grievance would come in, we would have to call up

someone and ask him to be a griev
ance officer."
Gillam said not having a group
of faculty already willing to help
added to the time needed to deal
with grievances.
Aldrich agrees that a more insti
tutionalized system of evaluating
appeals is better.
"My experience has been that
having a system in place to deal
with issues of fairness in different
situations ... is usually superior to
having an ad hoc system," he said.
In addition to serving as a
standing panel of faculty ready to
assist the provost, the fact-finders'
role will be slightly different from
their earlier counterparts, accord
ing to Gillam.
Some say the role of the griev
ance officers with respect to the ap
peals process was more broad.
"[Before] they were basically
asking a wise man or woman, 'what
do von think about the whole

[grievance] thing?' Now the job is
more specific," Wright said.
Instead of an advisory role, the
fact-finders will now answer clear
ly-defined questions posed by the
provost, Gillam explained.
" I his change can streamline the
process," she said
Still, appointed members may
also, according to the new state
ment, "report on unexpected as
pects of the case."
Gillam said this clause should
give the investigators more leeway
in their report to the provost.
Assoc. Prof. Akhil Gupta, who
was involved in one of the Univer
sity's most famously contentious
tenure cases, said this adjustment
may not make the process shorter
but may make it more consistent
because the same people will be
working on several cases.
"I'm not sure how much short
er [the replacement of the griev
ance officers] would make the
grievance process," Gupta said. "It
is still the same kind of investiga
tion, the same kinds of questions
must be asked, and it's a fairly com
plicated process.

" The main reason why my case
took a long time was that it took a
long time to get to the provost,"
Gupta said. "The main bottleneck
in that process has already been re
moved."
Gupta said that shortening the
appeals process is good for the ap
pelant.
"A delayed decision is also a de
cision to terminate somebody," lie
said. "The job market operates
once a year; appointments are
made once a year."
Both Aldrich and Wright be
lieve that their new roles are signif
icant but they have their disadvan
tages.
"It sounded like an important
thing to do even though it won't be
most pleasant job in the world,"
Aldrich said.
Wright agreed, saying that he
initially did not want to serve but
eventually he was moved by the di
rect request for a challenging and
important job that "people should
do."
"It's an effort to make the
tenure process more transparent
and clear," Wright said.
