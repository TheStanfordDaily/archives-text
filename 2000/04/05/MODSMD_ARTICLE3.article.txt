# Fac Sen simplifies grievance process on tenure decisions
## 
### JULIANA LIU STAFF WRITER 
Junior faculty members filing grievances on
tenure decisions may find the appeals process to be
clearer and more consistent this year.
During last week's Faculty Senate meeting,
Provost John Hennessy named six senior faculty
members to assist the future provost in answering
specific questions that arise from appeals.
The faculty members named during last Thurs
day's senate meeting are Molecular and Cellular
Physiology Prof. Richard Aldrich, Linguistics Prof.
Kve Clark, English Prof. Barbara Celpi, Mechanical
Engineering Prof. William Reynolds, Surgery Prof.
Oscar Salvatierra and Economics Prof. Gavin Wright.
These professors will be joined by six currently
unnnamed faculty members.

According to the Statement on Faculty Appeal
Procedures approved last June by the Board of
frustees, the provost may appoint a fact-finder to in
vestigate the matter before making a ruling on the
case. Once the fact-finder reports back, the provost
may then grant the appeal, remand the matter to a
lower level or refer it to the Advisory Board.
Fact-finders will replace the grievance officers,
who advised the provost under the old process. Like
the grievance officers, the fact-finders are a group of
consultants, but unlike the officers, the new members
have already agreed to serve.
"It's a revision of the previous system," Senior As
sociate Provost Kathy Cillani said. "The old appeals
process... was very ad-hoc in the sense that if a
grievance would come in, we would have to call up
