### MEGAN KNIZE STAFF WRITER 
Stanford faculty, student and staff ex
pressed positive reactions to Monday's
Board of Trustees announcement that
Provost John will become Stan
ford's 10th president.
"I'm pleased," said Robert Gray, Vice
Chair of'the Electrical Engineering De
partment. "1 le's had a meteoric rise, and
lie's got what it takes to be an excellent
president."
Gray added that he believes I lennessy
will have the University's best interests at
heart and that he is open to suggestions.
"1 le's very young, so if he does well,
he'll be around for awhile," Gray said.
"And 1 expect him to do well."
ASSU President Mike Levin said that
when I lennessy was provost, I lennessy
was receptive to and interested in student
input before he made important deci
sions.

" The selection of
John Hennessy is a
huge victory for stu
dents," Levin, a ju
nior, said. "Using stu
dent input, he will
continue to serve the
student body and
Stanford University
well for many years to
come," lie said.

Senior history major Alan Chen said
the Presidential Search Committee was
wise to chose the provost for the presi
dency, noting that "familiarity [with the
University] is important."
Kale!) Midland, a third-year physics
master's student and member of the Pres
idential Search committee that recom
mended I lennessy to the board, believes
Hennessy has an excellent understand
ing of "the big picture" in regard to the fu
ture of the University.
Even though Hennessy's background

is in engineering, many people think the
president-elect won't neglect the human
ities.
"I don't think an engineering back
ground precludes anyone from being the
president, as long as he doesn't ignore the
humanities," ('.lien said.
Midland said that the Search Com
mittee paid close attention to how Hen
nessy's background would influence his
decisions as President.
"1 le knows engineering very well, but,
in his one year as Provost, [Hennessy]
made an effort to get to know depart
ments throughout the University."
()n a personal level, Midland said that
Hennessy is someone who "truly cares
about Stanford, who makes smart deci
sions and who wants Stanford to grow to
become a greater University."
Hennessy will take office on Sept. 1.
"1 think it's wonderful," said Dagmar
Logie, an English Department adminis
trator. "But we're losing a good provost."
