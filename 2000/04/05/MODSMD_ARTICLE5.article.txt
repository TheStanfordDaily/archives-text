### VIVEK SRINIVASAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students convened yesterday at noon in White
Plaza to rally for "Justice tor Janitors," a labor union's
campaign tor decent wages, benefits and working
conditions tor janitors in California.
l he event, falling on the 32nd anniversary of the
assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., related " Jus
tice for Janitors" to King's larger vision of social and
economic equality.
Speakers included members of the Stanford Labor
Action Coalition, the oil-campus group that orga
nized the event, Angeles Figueroa, a janitor and local
union leader and Prof. Clayborne ('.arson, director of
the Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project.
"Speaking at this rally was not a hard decision to
make," Prof. Carson said. "Martin Luther King, were
he alive today, would have been at this rally." I le
noted (hat, less than 24 hours before his death, Dr.
King delivered his famous "mountaintop" speech to
striking sanitation workers in Memphis, 1 enn. in
support of their struggle.
Figueroa, speaking in Spanish with an Fnglish in
terpreter, gave an impassioned plea tin students to
support her union, SFIU Local 1877, in a Los Ange

les wage dispute with American Building Mainte
nance, a statewide janitorial services company that
contracts to Stanford.
"The life we [janitors] live is almost like an animal.
I hat's how we are treated and that's how we live," she
said."()ur children are vegetarians not by choice, but
because we don't have the means to buy meat. We im
migrated to this country to find a better life for us and
our children, but found the same poverty as at
home."
Later in the day, students and janitors, chanting in
Spanish and English, marched from Old Union to the
ABM offices near Maples Pavilion to present man
agement with a petition signed by over 500 students.
The petition called for ABM to provide "living wages
and comprehensive benefits" to all janitors in Califor
nia.
A survey of Stanford janitors found that unionized
janitors make an average of $8.04 an hour, while non
unionized janitors make only $0.75 an hour, well
under Stanford's minimum student wage of $8.25,
according to An gad Bhalla, a student speaker at the
rally.
I le encouraged audience members to consider the
statistics but do their own research as well. "Intn>duce
yourself to the janitor at your house. Find out what
their lives are really like," he said.
I he rally and march were part of a Student-Labor
Solidarity Day of Action, in which over 50 schools
across the nation participated.

At a Justice for Janitors rally in White Plaza, senior Brooke Atherton and junior Jen Wekselbaum urged community
members to consider the status of janitors because many do not make a living wage.
