### KIRK SHIMANO 
The newly introduced rural issues Alter
native Spring Break trip had its focus on is
sues outside the urban environment.
ASB provides Stanford students with an
opportunity to spend spring break invesu-

gating social issues first
hand. The 10 partici
pants in the rural issues
trip traveled to the re
mote town of Wallowa,
()re„ to address such top
ic s as sustainable develop
ment and community
welfare.
"It exposed ns to a lot
of the problems that peo
ple late in rural commu
nities and how govern-

inent legislation is often meant for the
cities," said sophomore Macy a trip
participant.
I lie students' experience began with a
series of speakers from the community of
Wallowa. Ranging from a worker at the
local domestic violence clinic to a nurse in
the town's only hospital, these representa
tives discussed the social and economic
challenges of rural life.
"I never really experienced rural life be
fore. I wanted to see how the people lived
and found it's really different from my life,"
said sophomore Kathy Huang.
Participants then spent a day and a half
pursuing individual areas of interest. Stu
dents worked with a forest service agent, a
local veterinarian, a town doctor and a vari
ety of other professionals.

"J wanted to find out
more about rural
health than 'Northern
Exposure' and 'Doc
Hollywood— senior
Anna Saporito

"I wanted to find out more about rural
health than 'Northern Exposure' and 'Dot
Hollywood.' It opened my eyes to a whole
different part of America that most urban
kids aren't aware of," said senior Anna
Saporito.
The trip also included two days in I fell's

Canyon, an isolated area
usually accessed only by
ranchers. They assisted in
the cattle branding
process and talked to
ranching families.
"We're all very
surprised at just how
aware of national and po
litical issues these people
are because it's what af
fects them directly on a
day-to-day basis," said stu-

dent trip leader Heidi Koh, a junior.
The trip concluded with a service project
aiding the local Native American popula
tion. Students helped to pull toxic weeds
from a hill purchased by the Nez Perce in
their efforts to reclaim their homeland.
Prior to the break, funding issues threat
ened the trip. The Office of Student Activi
ties' decision to prohibit the solicitation of
outside organizations limited potential
fundraisers. "We didn't know if we had
enough money until two weeks before we
left," explains student trip leader (lory (iar
man, a junior.
To complete the program, the partici
pants will meet for a final reflective meeting.
Later this quarter, coordinators will decide
whether the rural issues ASB will be offered
again next year.
