you don't
pay tax
_ _ on a
Roth
I R A
This is the big attraction of
a Roth IRA—you don't pay tax
when you make a qualified
withdrawal, not even on the
earnings and gains that build up.
You must follow certain rules,
such as holding the Roth IRA
for 5 years and reaching age 59'/j.
What's more, you can convert
many traditional IRA accounts
to a Roth IRA. And you can
contribute to a Roth IRA after
the age of 70'/ 2 .
You need to meet the guide
lines, compare, and examine
which choice is best for you.
Other IRA options also offer
tax advantages. For example,
you can withdraw up to
$10,000 from most IRA
accounts without paying early
withdrawal tax, if you use the
funds to buy a first home or pay
for higher education.
For all the facts on Roth and
other IRA benefits, see your
1999 tax booklet. Or check our
