Yesterday evening, best-selling author
Scott Turow captivated an audience at
(lubberly Auditorium, intermingling seg
ments from his novels with anecdotes de
scribing his development as an author.
Turow, a former Stegner Fellow for cre
ative writing, began by describing what fie
"inherited from his years at Stanford."
Though he was eager to leave at the
time, Stanford remains a special place to
come back to, he said, and he considers his
five years at the University as a gift.
Turow, who arrived in 1970, comment
ed that it was a tumultuous time to be a stu
dent. Reading from "Law of our Fathers,"
he described the "culture of the young" â€”
the flamboyant) and excitement that kept
the campus pulsing.
But at the end of five years, Turow said
he found himself strangely frustrated. He
recalled that his writing career was moving
too slowly; he was too young and ambitious
lo deal with failure, he said. Going to law
school at Harvard was a "bit of raw confu
sion," a way for Turow to "meet my
enemy."
Though it came as a shock lo professors
and friends at the time. Turow said he
found himself intrigued by the law. Look
ing around, he saw that legal matters de
fined daily life. Later, the emotional grip of

criminal law gave him the "inward com
pulsion" that truly inspired his writing ca
rter.
As a student, Turow was confused by
what he now calls, "the ideal novel." At the
time, James Joyce's novel "Ulysses" topped
college reading lists, so Turow spent a
summer reading it. When he had finished,
he recalled that not only had the novel
been hard to read, but he seemed to be the
only one reading it.
In his mind the question arose, "What
do writers owe their audience?" Turow
concluded that it was the writer's responsi
bility to try to "strike a deep chord with
everybody, The ideal novel was one that
could be read by an English professor and
a bus driver."
This same need to capture the audience
was also apparent in his work as a lawyer,
he said. A lawyer can't win a case without
engaging the jury, and the best way to en
gage a jury is to "tell them a good story."
By writing mysteries, such as the best
sellers "Presumed Innocent" and "Burden
of Proof," Turow said he felt he could "de
liver good writing." He enjoys the primal
side of mysteries and creating plots, he said.
Turow continues to be inspired by his
chosen professions, he said. The first chap
ter of his latest work, "Personal Injuries"
can be read online at http://w w w.scotiiur
