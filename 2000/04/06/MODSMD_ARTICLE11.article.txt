# Stanford joins local creek organization
## 
### CHRIS DRAKE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford has joined the San Francisquito
i Ireek Joint Powers Authority, an organization
established to address common problems and
issues both caused by and affecting the creek.
San Francisquito Creek has its headwaters in
San Mateo County and flows through several
local towns and Stanford lands before emptying
into San Francisco Bay. The creek forms a sig
nificant part of the boundary between San
Mateo County and Santa Clara County, includ
ing the boundaries between Palo Alto and
Menlo Park and between Palo Alto and East
Palo Alto.
Stanford joins the five local governments of

the authority as an advisory member to "con
tribute ideas and solutions," said Larry Horton,
director of Government and Community Rela
tions. Stanford is an associate member of the
authority because it is a "private, non-profit en
tity,"Hoi ton said, as is the other advisory mem
ber, a planning organization.
" The purpose of the Joint Powers Authority
was to enhance ihxxl protection through pro
jects to stabilize and promote environmental
concerns within the creek and the area of the
creek," said Vice Provost for Facilities Chris
Christoflerson, who represents Stanford in the
authority.
The governments that now comprise the
Joint Powers Authority began meeting in Feb
ruary 1998, shortlv after El Nino-induced rains

caused portions of the creek to flood. The same
storm closed classes at Stanford for a day and
damaged libraries and other buildings.
The governments eventually "felt that the
only way [they] could really deal effectively
[with the various issues raised]... was to form
a joint powers authority," in order to look at the
creek's flooding and environmental issues,
Horton said.
The Joint Powers Authority is currently
working on several projects in which Stanford
will play a significant part. Christofferson said
that a master plan has just been revealed for a
"bank stabilization" effort. The project will tar
get lower sections of the creek prone to flooding
after heavy rainfall.
The authority will also address
the health of the creek itself. A sed
iment study on excess accretion in
the upper stages of the creek is
currently underway. Another
study is examining the various
wildlife that calls the creek home.
Cristofferson said that San
Francisquito Creek contains "sev
eral rare and endangered species,
such as red-legged frogs." The au
thority is studying ways in which

ecological changes in the cretk
might affect various species, he
said.
In the event of future Hooding,
members of the authority will re
ceive "short term assignments fbr
addressing problems," Christdf
ferson said. This will help all the
communities affected by the creek
to avoid the problems that sur
faced during the February 1998
floods.
The Joint Powers Authority will
not only deal with problems as
they arise, Horton said, but will
seek to prevent crises from occur
ring. Meetings of the Joint Powers
Authority are open to the public.
