# Cesar Chavez Day celebrated
## 
### PATRICK C. CROSETTO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For some, today may just be
another day of classes, fraterni
ty rush or a chance to bask in
the sun. But for many students
at Stanford, April 6 is the day
on which to celebrate the life
and career of farm-worker ac
tivist Cesar Chavez.
Chris Gonzales Clarke, the
associate director of El Centro
Chicano, is one of the staff
members involved in planning
Stanford's commemoration of
Cesar Chavez Day.
"We have done celebrations
for seven years in a row now.
This year we are lucky to have
the group Culture Clash per
forming for only the second
time." he said.
.According to freshman Terri
Moequeda, who is in charge of
publicity for the celebration,
Culture Clash is "a comedy
troupe that does political the
atre. One of the ways in which a
lot of the political sentiments
within the Chicano culture
have been expressed has been
via political huinor theatre."
Culture Clash, together for
nearly 15 years, recently sold
out a tive-niglu performance in
San Francisco. The group had
a television series that aired on
West Coast Fox affiliates in the
early 19905.
"it's pretty special to have
Culture Clash here. This is a
unique opportunity to see
these guys (for a] pretty cheap
[price]," Clarke said.
Moqueda added, "This is an
event for everyone to come to if
you know about Cesar Chavez
or not. "
The performance will be
held tonight at 7 p.m. in Kresge
Auditorium. Tickets will cost $3
for anyone with a student ID
and $5 for everyone else. Ail
proceeds will go to the Cesar
Chavez Foundation, which
conducts research and educa
tion on farm worker issues.
The program will also in

dude the announcement of the
winners of a Cesar Chavez art .
and essay contest for local high •
school and elementary stu
dents.
Teresa Delgado, one of !
Chavez's grandchildren, will be
in attendance to talk about her
grandfather's legacy.
Students from Spanish and
Drama Prof. Cherrie Moraga's
drama class will also be present
ing an original "acto" about,
farm workers, based on "tealro
aimfxsino ... a style of agitprop
political funny satirical the
atre," according to Clarke.
Recognition of Chavez's
work has picked up in recent
years in California. Gov. Gray
Davis and members of the state
legislature have been trying to
pass a bill making the day a hol
iday for state and court employ
ees and public schools, accord
ing to the San Francisco Chron
icle.
because the assembly is on
break, the bill will probably not
be signed until a ceremony on
the seventh anniversary of The •
labor leader's death April 23.
Stanford has not decided if it ....
would follow suit and give all of
its employees and students a
holiday if Cesar Chavez Day is
made a state holiday.
Keith Smith, the University
manager of human resources
policy and staff and labor rela
tions, who just returned to cam
pus after a month-and-a-half
sabbatical, slated that he was
not up to speed on the develop
ments regarding Cesar Chavez
Day as a state holiday.
"My office would do whatev
er legwork required," Smith
said. "However, the decision
would ultimately be made by
the University Cabinet."
The committee responsible
for deciding which days classes
are canceled is the Faculty Sen
ate's Committee on Academic-
Appraisal and Achievement.
Committee Chairman Rex
Jamison said that this issue "has
not yet come up before th? com
mittee . . . [but] I'm disposed to
mention it to the committee the
next time we meet."
Jamison said that his commit

tee does not often deal with such
actions, because of the infrequen
cy of this type ofsituation. " 1 don't
know what's involved in the
process," he said.
Clarke said that the holiday
"would really be a wonderful
recognition for somebody who is
a wonderful leader and some
body who inspired not only our
community but also others."
