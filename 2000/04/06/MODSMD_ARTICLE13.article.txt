## Few Americans hurt in clash with Serbs 
### 
S£VCE, Yugoslavia (AP) — In
a weapons search gone wrong, 11
U.S.| soldiers were injured, the
suspect got away, and the troops
seized all of two hand grenades.
Still,mi could have been worse.
"We were very fortunate" that
more soldiers were not injured,
Maj.'Debbie Allen, a spokeswom
an at Camp Bondsteei, the main
U.S.«base, said yesterday. Ten of
the injured were brought to the
camp, while an 11th injured sol
dier \vas flown to a U.S. hospital in
Genpany with a broken hand.
The eight-hour confrontation
Tuesday with hundreds of Serb
civilians wielding sticks and
throwing stones in a narrow gorge
near the Macedonian border
endqd with the largest number of
American injuries in a single oper
ation since the Kosovo peacekeep
ing ipission began in June. •
A "Polish soldier and a translator
werq also slightly hurt.
Yugoslavia's private Beta news
agency said 14 Serbs were injured,
including 10 who were struck by
rubber bullets fired in an attempt
to break up a crowd at a barricade.
The operation began as a rou
tine Weapons search in this village
of 1,800 Serbs hidden away in the
rugged mountains 6,000 feet

above sea level, reachable by a
narrow road where goats and
cows roam.
About 25 U.S. military police
swooped down on the house of
Zoran janicevic, where they
found two grenades.
A crowd of angry Serbs
swarmed around the house, refus
ing to allow the soldiers to leave
with the suspect, U.S. officials
said. Realizing the situation was
getting out of hand, the Ameri
cans flew in another platoon by
helicopter as backup.
The arrival of helicopters
angered the Serbs even more. "It
was like NATO had come to bomb
us again," said Slobodan Savic,
principal of the village school.
"The children were frightened.
We stopped the classes and let
them go home."
From the house, U.S. military
police with riot shields led the
troops with the suspect through
the stone-throwing crowd down
the narrow gorge toward a nearby
village, Jazince, where the suspect
was to be helicoptered to Camp
Bondsteei.
" There were 150 Serbs along
side the road and blocking the
route out. They built obstacles
along the road, so that no vehicles

could come in and no vehicles
could go out, so soldiers moved
out on foot," Allen said.
As the Americans hiked
through the gorge, firing rubber
bullets to disperse the crowd,
Serbs hurled stones down on the
troops from the hills and whacked

them on the legs with large sticks.
"That's where most of our
injuries came from," Allen said.
After about a mile through the
gauntlet, the soldiers arrived at
Jazince, where reinforcements
were waiting. By that time, how
ever, the suspect had escaped in

the ongoing melee.
"There was a great deal of
pushing and shoving and the sol
diers were trving to protect them
selves from injury and the man
escaped." \ATO spokesman Lt.
Commander Philip Anido said
yesterday.

"They realized it was better for
them to let him go than to perpet
uate the confrontation."
In Washington, State Depart
ment spokesman James Rubin
condemned the "violence against
peacekeepers carrying out their
legitimate duties."
