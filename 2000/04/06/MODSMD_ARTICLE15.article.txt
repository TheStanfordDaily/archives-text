ATLAN TA (AP) â€” That cock
roach crawling across the screen
isn't ON your television. It's IN it.
Majay viewers have felt like
suckers after being frightened by
the roach in a commercial for
Orkin Pest Control.
Two viewers even asked the
company to repair sets that they
damaged when they hurled
objects at the bug.
"Apparently, when you're sit
ting in your darkened den it
seems pretty real," said Michael
Lollis, executive creative director
at the Atlanta office of J. Walter
Thotnpson, which created the
ads, titled "Fake Out." They
began airing, mostly at night, on
March 1 in 90 percent of the
country.
Orkin and the ad agency say

they have received dozens of calls
from people who reported being
frightened, amused or both by
the commercial, which starts as
an ad for a fictional fabric soften
er.
A woman from Greensboro,
Md., said she woke up two neigh
bors late at night to come to her
house to hunt and kill the roach.
One of the neighbors quickly fig
ured out the bug was from the
commercial.
"I felt really stupid for getting
my neighbors out of bed iti the
middle of the night," Darlyn
wrote. "You really got me!"
An irate woman who tried to
kill the roach by tossing a motor
cycle helmet at it and instead
broke her TV set demanded that
Orkin buy her a new one.
