# Market prompts startups to cancel offerings
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — I'he days when just
about any company with a dot-com in its name
could hit the jackpot on Wall Street by going
public may be ov^r.
Four Internet startups have canceled or
postponed their initial-public offerings of stock
this week because of the market's unprece
dented volatility and sudden disdain for tech
nology companies with uncertain futures.
Many more of the 260 companies waiting to
complete IPOs are expected to follow suit
As tech stocks fall out of favor, analysts say
only the most solid companies will be able to
go public. And the money raised by these
lucky few companies will probably be far less
than they originally anticipated.
Still, many analysts welcome the cooling-off
period.

" This is a healthy thing. We've been in a
very, very strong IPO market that's been will
ing to accept all kinds of companies and put
high valuations on those companies — eve»
the risky ones." said Kathleen' Smith, manager
the ••RenaMfsairtV 41 Plus <
Fund.
Smith said the downturn in slot ks will rein
still a "sense of discipline" to the IPO market,
something that was lost as investors chased
anything connected to the Internet, pushing
the stocks of unproven companies with dim
prospects for a profit into the stratosphere.
'I he Internet frenzy helped make IPO his
tory last year, when 543 companies raised a
record $69 billion. Ip until recent I\. the trend
appeared to be continuing.
Shares of the 146 companies that have gone

public this year rose an average of 98 percent
on t heir first clay of trading, according to
Thompson Securities Data Co., a market data
business*n Ne\\*u •■y 112
Lately, however, the marker has !>een harsh
hi d Nearl\%iio pi
fallen below their first-day closing price, and
29 percent have fallen below their original
offering price.
I he lack of staying power has been particu
larlv painful for individual investors, who usu
ally cannot get access to IPOs until they begin
trading on public markets. Since they can buy
only after the price has soared, these investors
have frequently been disappointed.
But big institutions and insiders who got
the shares at cheap pre-market prices are also
losing money.
