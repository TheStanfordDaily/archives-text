# Yoshiro Mori replaces Japan's ailing premier

### 
TOKYO (AF) — Ruling party
insider Yoshiro Mori took control
as Japan's new prime minister
yesterday, squelching speculation
he would call early elections and
promising to plow ahead with his
predecessor s economic recovery
plan.
The election of Mori by Parlia
ment resolved a leadership crisis
in the Japanese government trig
gered Sunday when Prime Minis
ter Keizo Obuchi suffered a
stroke and went into a coma.
Obuchi remained hospitalized on
life support.
At his first news conference as
prime minister, Mori brushed off
suggestions that opposition pres
sure would force him to call a
general election before July, when
leaders from the Group of Eight
nations will hold a summit in
Japan.
Mori, the former second-in
command in the Liberal Demo
cratic Party, said bolstering the
economy and preparing for the
summit were his priorities, not
elections. The government must
call elections by October.
"I have other major tasks to
carry out and I have to make sure
that 1 execute those tasks in a
proper manner," he said.
Mori, 62, took office with a
promise to keep up the policies of
Obuchi, who mounted a huge
public spending campaign to jar
Japan out of recession. He kept
Obuchi .s Cabinet intact, with all
the ministers the same except for
the top spot.
Mori said his first job would be

to end Japan's decade-long
stretch of malaise, and especiallv
to boost private consumption,
long considered the central weak
spot in the economy.
"I will be following the path of
Prime Minister Obuchi," Mori
declared. "1 will finish what he has
started and left unfinished."
A former trade minister, Mori
won solid majorities in votes ves
terday in both houses of Parlia
ment following his installment
earlier in the day as president of
the LDP. He and his Cabinet were
sworn in by Emperor Akihito.
Mori emerged as the most
viable replacement as prime min
ister shortly after Obuchi's stroke.
LDP secretary-general, Mori had
a solid power base.
Reviving Japan's economy will
be Mori's major challenge.
Thanks to a tremendous public
spending spree, the economy has
shown signs of improvement, but
unemployment is stubbornly high
and growth has been weak.
There is also mounting con
cern about the burgeoning fiscal
deficit.
In Japan's financial markets,
the dollar rose slightly against the
yen yesterday and stock prices
slipped.
Traders said the political situa
tion was tiot much of a factor
because most analysts believed
economic policy would not
change.
Economists expected Mori, like
Obuchi, to try to get the econoim
rolling again before trying to tack
le the deficit.
