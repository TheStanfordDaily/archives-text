## The
						Stanford Daily Debating the outcome of the hospital split 
### 
After a month of financial indepen
dence, the Stanford and UCSF
Medical Centers officially split last
Saturday. This split seems to be
the best possible outcome of a merger ill
fated from the beginning. Their last year
together has been rife with union tensions,
patient dissatisfaction and huge financial
losses.
University President Gerhard Casper
said to the Faculty Senate when he
announced die merger dissolution that the
main reasons he perceived for the merger's
failure was under-reimbursement by the
state, Medicare cuts and the managed care
market. He also said that other causes
included external financial pressures and a

failure to establish a new culture within the
re-structured organization.
It also seems, however, that there was a
fundamental problem underlying the phi
losophy of the merger: the attempt to blend
a private institution with a public one.
In efforts to improve financial results,
research and health care, the two facilities
merged over two years ago. But the
attempt to make a cohesive whole out of
two very different institutions turned out
to be a massive money-drainer for all par
ties involved.
With legislation passed in 1997 that pro
posed the phasing out of government sup
port of uninsured patients and academic
hospitals, fifty percent of patients covered

by public progams lost out â€” a major issue
that the public and private institutions
needed to tackle together. When USHC's
losses were first projected, $80 million was
estimated as the annual shortfall for treating
Medi-Cal patients and $170 million over
five years as a result of decreases in Medi
care spending.
Probably the greatest downside to those
involved in the merger will be the loss of
shared facilities and combined research
interests. The merger, after its first year,
was responsible for the hospitals'
improved cancer care. A coordinated
UCSF-Stanford Clinical Cancer Program
enabled collaboration between the 150
physicians that specialize in cancer care at

UCSF and Stanford.
Perhaps the end of this merger will begin
some changes at the Stanford Medical
School. On the whole, it seems that both
sides can now breathe a bit easier with the
merger officially ended.
Without being forced to work together
on a day-to-day basis, it seems certain that
Stanford and UCSF will return to their for
mer good relationship. While new CEOs
and board members will be named for both
institutions, they will still have about 10
members in common and plan to collabo
rate frequently. And perhaps that is the best
result that could be expected of such a
merger: friendly collaboration between two
strong medical institutions.
