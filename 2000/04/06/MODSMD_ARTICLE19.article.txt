# MODERN LIFE IS RUBBISH
## Trekking with the Pope 
### 
A little-remarked footnote to
Pope John Paul Il's recent
visit to the Holy Land was the
arrest of Meir Baranes, an
Orthodox Jew who placed a "death
curse" on the Pope shortly before his
arrival.
The ceremony was apparently per
formed in true death curse fashion, at
midnight in a northern Israel cemetery.
To the relatively secular American
audience, this is likely to seem just
anachronistic. These days our knowl
edge of death curses

comes from movies
like "The Craft," from
which we know that
black magic always
turns on its maker and
is accompanied by a
Portisbead sound
track. But it clearly
runs much deeper for
Baranes, and for the

Israeli police who found it serious
enough to place him under arrest.
This sort of anachronism is what
John Paul has had to deal with through
out his papacy. Gone are the days when
the Catholic Church had enough power
to do things like arbitrarily pick, a line of
longitude and split South America
down the middle, giving half to Spain
and half to Portugal.
In the U.S. the Pope still functions as
a spiritual leader to millions, but then a
similar argument could be made about
Oprah Winfrey. What's a 21st-century
Pope to do?
John Paul has done the only sensible
thing, which is to try and bring the
church in sync with the modern world
without sacrificing its core tenets.
This mostly involves visiting far-flung
parts of the world, making speeches and
holding conferences.
To a large extent it's public relations,
but it's important and necessary public
relations. And all things considered,
he's done an impressive job of it.
The Pope spent a week in Israel
meeting with the standard list of Jewish
and Muslim leaders and visiting basical
ly every landmark mentioned in the
New Testament.
He held services at many of these,
including his own Sermon on the
Mount, which might have seemed like
hubris if his message to this conflicted
area weren't so simple and humble:
essentially, can't we all just get along?
It's a noble sentiment. But of
course, it gets much more sticky in
practice. For instance, there's the mat
ter of John Paul's speech at the Holo

caust memorial, where he offered an
apology for historical Christian mis
treatment of Jews.
Some applauded; some said that's all
well and good, but not good enough.
Many Jewish leaders, for instance, want
ed to hear an apology for the Catholic
Church's silence during the Holocaust.
They have a point. And for all his
intentions of tolerance, there's still the
knotty matter of the Pope's position on
issues like birth control and gay rights.
He still has to operate within the
church's framework, after all, and
unfortunately there are just some tilings
you can't expect a pope to say.
John Paul's been doing a careful bal
ancing act for a long time, and everyone
seems to expect something different of
him.
lake last Wednesday, when he called
for an end to religious violence on the
Philippine island of Mindanao and
offered a prayer for everyone involved.
Philippine President Joseph Estra
da's reaction was to get huffy and com
plain that "he should not be praying for
peace in Mindanao but praying for
peace in the world. It is not only in Min
danao where there is trouble."
It's a tough life when people start
telling you what to pray for.
And death curses aside, every
appearance the Pope made in Israel was
picketed by Israeli and Palestinian
extremists who shouted and threw
stones.
John Paul ended his visit by placing a
prayer for forgiveness in Jerusalem's
Wailing Wall; photos were duly taken
and plastered all over the world's major
newspapers in the usual cynic ism-induc
ing media barrage.
Stagy though the gesture was, it was
still genuinely affecting to see this 79-
year-old man shuffling up to the holiest
site in Judaism with his scrap of paper.
He has since described his visit as "joy
ful" and "unforgettable," of course it's
what you'd expect him to say, but
there's little doubt that he means it.
The heart of his message is the same
as that of the multiculturalism currently
in vogue with American academia;
mutual respect and understanding and
everything else that can seem banal pre
cisely because it's so obviously true.
People, he's saying, just need to stop
killing each other. Naturally, putting
this into practice is a tall order for any
one, even a 21st-century Pope, to han
dle. But it's still worthwhile to listen.
