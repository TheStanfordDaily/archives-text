Seniors disappointed with Senior Gift
campaign
The recent barrage of telephone calls
to our residence over the last month has
prompted us to write a letter addressing
the shallow and underhanded tactics of
the Senior Gift campaign.
First, we were extremely surprised and
exceedingly disappointed to discover that
a donation to the Senior Gift is merely a
cleverly disguised contribution to the
Stanford Fund. We understand that the
money donated to the Stanford Fund is
essential in maintaining many University
programs; we are also aware that seniors'
donations are matched by various donors.
However, we are offended that a senior's
contribution through the "Senior Gilt" is
funneled into the general Stanford Fund
and not set aside for special use.
Upon first hearing about the Senior
Gift, we assumed that the senior class
used at least some of the donation money
to give a memorial "gift" to the Universi
ty (i.e. a bench in the Oval, a small statue
in one of the many gardens or maybe
simply a plaque somewhere on campus.)
When we realized that the gift was purely
symbolic, we were shocked, disappointed
and very suspicious. Certainly, if the

Stanford Fund called us and asked for
money, we would be irritated and most
likely refuse to give. Why, then, when the
Senior Gift calls, should we be any less
irked and any more willing?
Secondly, we are appalled at the tech
niques employed by the Senior Gift com
mittee, which is trained by the Stanford
Fund and operates from the Stanford
Fund offices. Receiving a call from some
one in our freshman dorm whom we
have not seen in four years is not going to
make us any more likely to give; in fact,
engaging in small talk with this person
actually makes us feel more uncomfort
able about giving and, frankly, generally
leaves us in a foul mood and less likely to
give in the future.
When a person from our freshman
dorm calls us up out of the blue and asks
us "What's up?" we are not fooled into
thinking that a long-lost pal wants to
reconnect — we are insulted that the
Stanford Fund would assume that we
would be more likely to give at the
request of a former dorm mate and were
angry that the Stanford Fund preys 011
dorm ties to garner money.
We enjoyed living in our respective
freshman dorms and had great and
memorable freshman experiences. We

are disappointed that those fond memo
ries of freshman year are now tainted by
solicitation.
I hird, the aggressive tactics employed
by the Senior Gift committee make us
extremely uncomfortable, and their
incessant bullying only makes us less like
ly to give. We can't count the number of
phone calls received by us and our room
mates and the excuses that we keep com
ing up with to keep the callers at bay. We
and our roommates have explicitly
expressed our wishes that the Senior^Gift
not call us again — that we will give when
we are ready: Despite these pleas, the
Senior Gift keeps calling, which we find
disrespectful, rude and a waste of every
one's time.
finally, we find it surprising that the
Senior Gift is promoted by the Stanford
fund as a means of bringing a class
together. Callers are advised to use peer
pressure in soliciting donations and
urged to make statements such as "Every
one else in the class is giving" or "X|per
cent of people have given already." If the
I niversity honestly thinks that a mass
donation to the Stanford Fund is the best
way of promoting class unity, the admin
