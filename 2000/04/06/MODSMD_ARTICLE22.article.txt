## Softball regains confidence for big weekend match-ups 
### EMILY DRESSEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Back on track and rarin' to go.
I he No. 8 Stanford Softball team
defeated St. Mary's College 3-0 and
2-1 in a doubleheader in Moraga,
Calif., on Tuesday, improving their
overall record to 32-7, 1-4 Pacific 10
Conference.
Cranted, St. Mary's (15-23) is not
No. 1 Washington or No. 3 UCLA,
but it is a scrappy non-conference
team that put up a viscous fight
against the recently struggling Car
dinal.
After taking three crushing losses
last weekend at home against top
conference teams, Stanford wel
comed the victories.
As senior catcher Kellie Wiginton
put it, "At this point in our season,

we were very happy to get the two
wins. These non-conference games
are crucial to our play as fin as al
lowing us to relax a little, make ad
justments, and build momentum
for the Pac-10."
And those adjustments need to
be made.
Before Tuesday's mate h-ups, the
Cardinal had gone 21 straight
innings without generating a single
run. At home last weekend, Stan
ford's offense, which had been a
monstrous force earlier in the sea
son, reached an all-time low.
Tuesday's first game started out
much the same with five scoreless in
nings of play before sophomore
centerfielder Jessica Mendoza's
one-out single finally awakened an
array of Stanford bats.
After stealing second, Mendoza

stored off of freshman Maureen
LeCocq's single, shattering Stan
ford's 26-inning curse.
With two of the team's four fresh
man pitchers recovering from in
juries, freshman Fori N'yberg
stepped up and pitched the entire
game, allowing four bits and im
proving her overall rec< >rd to 6-1.
St. Mary's decided to turn the ta
bles a bit in the second game of the
afternoon by posting a run early in
the first.
Answering in the fourth. Men
doza smashed a double to right field
and later scored on a Gael error.
I he game remained dead
locked at 1-1 until Mendo/a, who
went 4-fbr-7 on the day, stepped up
to the plate in extra innings.
Proving her heroic capabilities
once more, Mendo/a belted one
over the fence, deep into right cen
ter and paraded around the bases,
giving Stanford the 2-1 victory.
Freshman Maureen LeCocq (5-
2) pitched all eight innings of the
second game, allowing only three
hits and the sole first-inning run.*
Tuesday's victories added to
Stanford's 15 non-conference game
winning streak. But, more impor
tantly, the victories give the Cardi
nal the confidence boost it desper
ately needed following lost week
end's disappc tintnients.
"Especially since we are in the
middle of Pac-10 play, it's harder to
maintain that high intensity level
every game deserves against the
non-conference teams," said Wigin
ton.
"But it's good practice for us. We
have to learn to play every game
with that intensity because when re
gional come along you can't just
flip a switch. You have to have al
ready established your momentum
by that point."
1 his weekend promises another
challenge for the Carclianl, with
N0.2 Arizona and N0.5 Arizona
State on the schedule
