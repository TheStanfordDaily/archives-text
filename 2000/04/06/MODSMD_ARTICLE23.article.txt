## 
### CHRISTOPHER LYLE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The men's and women's track teams are gearing up for
a series of key meets throughout April, but they will take a
more relaxed approach to this weekend's Hayward Relays
in Eugene, Ore.
"We just want to go have some fun with this one," head
coach Vin Lananna said. "We want to use this meet to get
all the kinks out for the outdoor season. After this, we will
get more serious starting with Mt. SAC [Relays]."
The Hayward Relays will be primarily relay and field
events. According to Lananna, the team's focus will be on
the performances of its field athletes. While other areas
might not get the spotlight this week, they will each have
their time to shine. The Stanford Invitational oti March 25
and 26 centered on the distance squads; the Drake Relays
on April 28 and 29 will showcase middle distance; and the
California State Meet, April 29 and 30, will focus on the
sprinters and hurdlers.
The Hayward Relays take place at Hayward Field, the
same track where the Pacific Ten Championship Meet will
be held. Athletes will use this meet to familiarize them
selves with the facilities before the more important Pac 10
meet.
The men will be sending a talented list of athletes to
compete this weekend. Juniors Michael Stember and Ryan
Carroll and sophomore Gabe Jennings will lead the mid
dle-distance effort in the 4x8()0-meter relay and distance
medley relay. Junior Leroy Sims and sophomore Evan
Kelty will headline the sprints.
Sophomore Chris Sprague and freshman Omar I nan
will lead the throws, and senior Toby Stevenson will make
a contribution in the pole vault.
A powerful team of middle-distance runners, junior
Sally Glynn and freshmen Lauren Fleshman and Lindsay
Hyatt, look to make an impact in Eugene. Junior Wilsa
Charles and sophomore Danielle Spurlock will lead the
sprint relays for the women.
On the field, junior Melissa Feinstein will contribute in
the pole vault, and senior Chi-Chi Onyeagbako will lead

the throws.
" I his is a great opportunity to go up to Eugene and
check ii out before the Pat l()s," Stember said. "We just
want to compete well as a team and not worry about per
formances as far as time and NCAA qualifying times. We
will just go up and have a good time. Relays are always fun
and the crowd always really gets into it."
The Cardinal will face good competition in Eugene.
Nine teams, including Minnesota, Oregon, Colorado and
Colorado State, will be at the meet. I lowever, the meet will
not be scored.
