Invincibility is a difficult trait to possess on the
golf course, but Monday and Tuesday, the tenth
ranked Fresno State Bulldogs were utterly unbeat
able. Stanford found itself caught in the Bulldogs'
jaws at Pasatiempo Golf Course in Santa Cruz, Calif.
The Far West Intercollegiate is the longest-run
ning collegiate golf tournament west of the Missis
sippi, but in none of its previous 53 years had a team
conquered its IS holes with such consistency and
prowess as the Bulldogs did this week.
The Cardinal finished tied for 12th, with a cu
mulative 34-over-par over 36 holes. Fresno State's
2-under-par performance demolished the previous
course record by 29 strokes.
On the par-70 course, No. 15 Stanford came out
misfiring the first day at 15-over-par. Stanford was
led by junior Eric Dahlberg's 72. The Cardinal im
proved by ten strokes later in the day, paced by
freshman Ron Won's 67. Won posted the best
round by any Stanford goiter in the tournament.
Fresno State and runner-up Peppercline liad al
ready pulled away from the pack before Tuesday's
final round, and Stanford failed to carry its second
round momentum into the final. The Cardinal fin

ished with a 14-over-par performance, despite se
nior Dusty Brett's even par 70.
"We got so far behind in the first round that, no
matter what we did, we couldn't catch up," head
coach VVally Goodwin said. "Fresno is a great team
of all seniors, and we did not do well."
Individually, Pepperdine's Jason Alli ed, ranked
just No. 165 nationally by Golfweek, won the tour
nament, shooting 11-under. Allred finished eight
strokes ahead of Fresno's Ryan King.
Senior Dusty Brett led the Cardinal at eight-over
par and tied for 28th, followed by junior Jimmy Lee.
Brett thinks the tournament may be an impetus
for future success.
"It was a wake up call," Brett said. "As we ap
proach the end of the season, we need to step it up
both in practice and in our efforts competing out on
the golf course."
Both Goodwin and the squad acknowledged the
role the team's short game played in upping the
scores, not just for Stanford but for several accom
plished groups.
I he Cardinal finished four shots behind No. 5
BYU, which fell on the second day of play to finish
the tournament tied for ninth.
