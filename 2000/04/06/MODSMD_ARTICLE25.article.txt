# Golfers work to strengthen team
## Women find team cohesiveness to be the latest weapon in their arsenal — and it should bring success in the postseason 
### MATTHEW MCQUINN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Statistically, the Stanford women's golf
team is quite impressive. In addition to being
ranked sixth in the nation, the Cardinal is led
by the No. 11 and No. 17 Division 1 players,
juniors Stephanie keever and Hilary I lome
yer.
Furthermore, the team's short game is
second in the country, an essential ingredi
ent in consistently firing good scores.
However, as impressive as they may be,
statistics cannot convey one way in which the
Cardinal's game has been growing— in the
last few tournaments, the team has come to
gether as a more cohesive unit.
"We've been steadily improving," head
coach Carolyn O'Connor said. "[Freshman]
Kim Row ton and [senior] JaeJean Ro have
shown tremendous progress."'
Rowton stepped into the forefront for the
Cardinal in the Arizona Wildcat Invitational
in February, placing second individually
with a three-day, 4-under-par total at Ran
dolph North Golf Course in Tucson, Ariz.
Last week, Ro finished second in the Stan
ford-SJSI Desert Dual at the PGA West Golf
Course in La Quinta, (lalif.
For the Cardinal to succeed in the post
season, team members must continue to step
up and aid perennial stars Keever and
1 lomeyer.
The rest of the team has done just this in
the Cardinal's last two major tournaments:
the Arizona Invitational and the SMU/OSU
Invitational.
At Arizona, the team fired its lowest score

this year, 284, on the first day of competition.
This gave it a lead of six strokes with two days
of play remaining. The Cardinal finished
third — one stroke shy of second — a finish
aided by every player on the team.
This success came directly after another
third-place finish at the SMU/OSU Invita
tional at Palos Verdes Golf Course in Redon
do Beach, Calif.
Once again, the Cardinal competed with
the top teams in the country. Individuals on
the Stanford team placed 4th, 10th, 18th,
37th and 76th. .Although led by Keever and
Homeyer, the small number of strokes sepa
rating the Stanford golfers reveals the entire
team's contribution to the Cardinal's success.
Stanford is looking to channel its recent
momentum into succeeding in the first of its
final two regular-season tournaments, the
Ping/ASU Invitational starting on Friday.
This three-day competition boasts all the Pa
cific 10 Conference schools except Washing
ton State, in addition to some of the better
schools from across the country. Competi
tion will be held at the Karsten Golf Course
in Tempe, Arizona.
"It's been five weeks since we played a se
rious tournament," O'Connor said. "We've
had a lot of time to practice."
The team also considers itself to have the
advantage of experience going into this tour
nament. Every Cardinal player has played
this course at least once.
Last season the team placed second at this
competition — perhaps giving it the confi
dence that carried the Cardinal to a victory at
the Pac 10 Championships last April.
The team is in a similar position this year.
Success in Arizona ma\ influence the Cardi
nal's postseason.
"1 think the ASU tournament this week is
going to get us back in the playing mode and
ready for the post season," said Keever. "If
our play represents our hard practice, we will
be just fine in the upcoming tournaments."
