Elections are approaching, campaigns

The current Senate is making sure that
the transition from the old to the new is as
smooth as possible.
"We are working very hard so that the
student government will be well organized
and structured for next year's Senate," said
junior Mike Dudas, chair of the Student Af
fairs Committee.
" There have been start-up problems in
the past because of lack of communication
between the Senate [and the community],
so we feel it is important for a change," lie
said at Tuesday night's Senate meeting.

day, Senate also discussed its proposal to
use space in the old Roble dining hall for a

eight different student organizations. The
