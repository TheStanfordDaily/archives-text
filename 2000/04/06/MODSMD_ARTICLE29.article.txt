# A 						'New Standard' for
## jazz Intermission interviews Steve Tyrell, the legendary jazz producer-turned-performer. 
### MEGAN TOMPKINS 
You will love Steve Tyre 11 \s debut
album, "A New Standard." Your grand
mother will also love it, your eight-vear-old
sister will love it, and the fiat house will
love it. Steve Tyrell just can't give you
"Anything but love, baby," in the words
of one of the classic tracks that he reinter
prets in his unique style. How could lit'
not, when the album has met with incredi
ble success, described as the "melodic coup
of the millenitun" and a rival to the origi
nal recordings?
You'd think success like this would lead
a singer to believe he's got the world on a
string.
But Tyrell has a distinctive, down-to
earth, nice-guy personality and seems sur
prised by the success himself.
Tyrell has spent much of his career on
the other side of the recording studio as a
giant in the producing field.
He is responsible for many successes in
today's popular music and is a music
industry favorite, "one of the best," accord
ing to friend and classic jazz singer Burt
Bacharach.
However, this jewel of an album debut
has no doubt propelled Ivrell into a new
focus on singing, which he "got into by
accident" as soundtrack producer for
movies "Father of the Bride." Parts I and
11.
Tyrell was singing a demonstration in
the parking lot when the movie's stars
Steve Martin, Diane Keaton and Martin
Short overheard him and insisted lie sing
the songs for the movie.
The first time he sang the feature song
"Give Me The Simple Life" on the set.
"people flipped out, people of all ages, the
actors, 500 extras, the Disney executives.
Young girls were coming up to the stage
and saying 'God, I love that song!' " I vrell
laughs.
He still can't quite believe that song's
success, since that was the first old stan
dard he had ever sung. Growing up in
Texas, he listened to rhythm and blues
and was heavily influenced by such greats
as Ray Charles, Otis Redding, Bobby Blue
blan and Stevie Ray Vaughan, not old jazz..

"The standards were niv parents' music
that plaved in the house, not something I
listened to. When I recorded this album, I
had to rediscover it for mvself," he said.
That lac k of familiaritv with the music was
the best thing he could have done for his
Instead of singing in a cliche, Las-Yegas
lounge singer stvle, he lends a fresh, mod
ern take to the classics, singing them the
way tliev were meant to be sung but with a
t wisi of R&B.
Mis fresh vocal take on the old songs
'somehow came out in a contemporarv
wav." he says.
"Ii captured a spirit. I think the music
lines up well with in\ voice. Do \ou think
so?'
His voice is part Louis Armstrong, part
Otis Redding, with a twist of vintage,
unmistakable Tyrell — a rich, husky
southern tone with a hint of jazzv growl.
"I didn't grow up singing the standards,
so I don't have the kind of influences that
most singers have. Most people try to imi
tate Frank Sinatra, who's the best there
ever was, but vou just can't try to sound
like him."
I vrell seems to excel at making others
happy with a megawatt smile and kind
warmth that appears to be his trademark
in I lollywood.
Over and over again, I heard of I yrell's
generosit\, his courtesv, his easvgoing
manner, his approac habilitv. He's also a
warm, generous and friendh father of
three.
W hen 1 talked with I'vrell, he was in
Sherman Oaks Park coaching a Little
League game for his son. who happens to
be on the same team as the children of
Kcldie Yan Halen and Bi 11 \ Idol (who sings
the National Anthem at the games).
How does he find the time in his few
hours off from the studio? "It's important
to me, and 1 make the time."
I n ell's presence at Sherman Oaks Park
led him to a chance encounter that made
the album, which I vrell calls "divine inter
vention." While jogging one day, I vrell
was introduced In a mutual friend to "a
fellow musician," the famous drummer
Louis Bellson, who played with Duke

Ellington and Benny Goodman.
At the time, 1 yrell had just experi
enced the success of the "Father of the
Bride" soundtrack and had, on the
basis of his one song, been recruited by
Rosemarv Cloonev to sing at Dorothy
('.handler Pavilion.
"1 was blown away," Tyrell mar
velled. He also received hundreds and
hundreds of letters from people after
the second "Father of the Bride" movie,
featuring "The Sunny Side of the
Street."
Friends and family had also been
constanth asking him to make an
album as well.
But l'vrell, with classic modestv. still
wondered "Clod, who would ever put
out an album, by me, singing stan
dards?"
Famous last words. As soon as Bellson
and Tyrell had discussed I vrell's possi
ble album, Bellson got on the phone and
recruited a few of his contemporaries,
some of the greatest musicians ever to pla\
in jazz, for the backup instrumentals,
including (llark l erry, Fools Fhielemans
and Sweets Kdison, who started his career
with Billie 1 folliday.
That, to Fyrell, was a sign: "Bov, now
that would be a cool album," he thought.
"Evervone wanted to do it, and it fell into
place perfectly. It opened the door to
something I'd never considered doing
before."
l'vrell appreciates this fortuitv, saving
that "most good things happen that wa\
you always hear about the extra sitting on
the set, talking to the director, and it turns
out to be Marilyn Monroe!"
lie's taken full advantage of the oppor
tunity, giving tribute to the old standards
and "to tiie great people who played them
in the first place."
He considers the album to honor the
musicians as "incredible national trea
sures" and honoring the "incredible ele
gance and soul" of their music. "These
guys invented cool," he said.
"There's nothing more cutting edge
than this music and these people, and I
want to tip my hat and honor that." More
poignantly, "A New Standard" represents

Sweets Kdison's last recording, which "just
makes the album so spec ial to me," he said.
"I'm so grateful tor the experience, and
have really been privileged to have been
given this music."
I \ roll w ill no doubt be stepping further
into the jaz/. limelight in the near future,
an exciting prospect lor his career.
"I'd forgotten what a privilege it is to
have my own means of expression," he
told me.
"Lsualh as a producer, which is all
about helping others do their thing, I
don't have the opportunitv to express
m\ self c reatively.'
I hat's bound to change, however, as lie
steps into a new frontier.
He's especially excited about introduc
ing the great old standards to college stu
dents. and is even considering coining to
Stanford next fall for a concert and to
speak about his experience.
Helping voting people discover music,
as he did, for the first time, has been one
of the most rewarding parts of "A New
Standard."
"It's been a labor of love and the most
exciting project I've ever been involved
with," he slid. "Isn't it awesome?"

of the millenitun" and a rival to the origi
nal recordings?
You'd think success like this would lead
a singer to believe he's got the world on a
string.
But Tyrell has a distinctive, down-to
earth, nice-guy personality and seems sur
prised by the success himself.
Tyrell has spent much of his career on
the other side of the recording studio as a
giant in the producing field.
He is responsible for many successes in
today's popular music and is a music
industry favorite, "one of the best," accord
ing to friend and classic jazz singer Burt
Bacharach.
However, this jewel of an album debut
has no doubt propelled Ivrell into a new
focus on singing, which he "got into by
accident" as soundtrack producer for
movies "Father of the Bride." Parts I and
11.
Tyrell was singing a demonstration in
the parking lot when the movie's stars
Steve Martin, Diane Keaton and Martin
Short overheard him and insisted lie sing
the songs for the movie.
The first time he sang the feature song
"Give Me The Simple Life" on the set.
"people flipped out, people of all ages, the
actors, 500 extras, the Disney executives.
Young girls were coming up to the stage
and saying 'God, I love that song!' " I vrell
laughs.
He still can't quite believe that song's
success, since that was the first old stan
dard he had ever sung. Growing up in
Texas, he listened to rhythm and blues
and was heavily influenced by such greats
as Ray Charles, Otis Redding, Bobby Blue
blan and Stevie Ray Vaughan, not old jazz..

"The standards were niv parents' music
that plaved in the house, not something I
listened to. When I recorded this album, I
had to rediscover it for mvself," he said.
That lac k of familiaritv with the music was
the best thing he could have done for his
Instead of singing in a cliche, Las-Yegas
lounge singer stvle, he lends a fresh, mod
ern take to the classics, singing them the
way tliev were meant to be sung but with a
t wisi of R&B.
Mis fresh vocal take on the old songs
'somehow came out in a contemporarv
wav." he says.
"Ii captured a spirit. I think the music
lines up well with in\ voice. Do \ou think
so?'
His voice is part Louis Armstrong, part
Otis Redding, with a twist of vintage,
unmistakable Tyrell — a rich, husky
southern tone with a hint of jazzv growl.
"I didn't grow up singing the standards,
so I don't have the kind of influences that
most singers have. Most people try to imi
tate Frank Sinatra, who's the best there
ever was, but vou just can't try to sound
like him."
I vrell seems to excel at making others
happy with a megawatt smile and kind
warmth that appears to be his trademark
in I lollywood.
Over and over again, I heard of I yrell's
generosit\, his courtesv, his easvgoing
manner, his approac habilitv. He's also a
warm, generous and friendh father of
three.
W hen 1 talked with I'vrell, he was in
Sherman Oaks Park coaching a Little
League game for his son. who happens to
be on the same team as the children of
Kcldie Yan Halen and Bi 11 \ Idol (who sings
the National Anthem at the games).
How does he find the time in his few
hours off from the studio? "It's important
to me, and 1 make the time."
I n ell's presence at Sherman Oaks Park
led him to a chance encounter that made
the album, which I vrell calls "divine inter
vention." While jogging one day, I vrell
was introduced In a mutual friend to "a
fellow musician," the famous drummer
Louis Bellson, who played with Duke

Ellington and Benny Goodman.
At the time, 1 yrell had just experi
enced the success of the "Father of the
Bride" soundtrack and had, on the
basis of his one song, been recruited by
Rosemarv Cloonev to sing at Dorothy
('.handler Pavilion.
"1 was blown away," Tyrell mar
velled. He also received hundreds and
hundreds of letters from people after
the second "Father of the Bride" movie,
featuring "The Sunny Side of the
Street."
Friends and family had also been
constanth asking him to make an
album as well.
But l'vrell, with classic modestv. still
wondered "Clod, who would ever put
out an album, by me, singing stan
dards?"
Famous last words. As soon as Bellson
and Tyrell had discussed I vrell's possi
ble album, Bellson got on the phone and
recruited a few of his contemporaries,
some of the greatest musicians ever to pla\
in jazz, for the backup instrumentals,
including (llark l erry, Fools Fhielemans
and Sweets Kdison, who started his career
with Billie 1 folliday.
That, to Fyrell, was a sign: "Bov, now
that would be a cool album," he thought.
"Evervone wanted to do it, and it fell into
place perfectly. It opened the door to
something I'd never considered doing
before."
l'vrell appreciates this fortuitv, saving
that "most good things happen that wa\
you always hear about the extra sitting on
the set, talking to the director, and it turns
out to be Marilyn Monroe!"
lie's taken full advantage of the oppor
tunity, giving tribute to the old standards
and "to tiie great people who played them
in the first place."
He considers the album to honor the
musicians as "incredible national trea
sures" and honoring the "incredible ele
gance and soul" of their music. "These
guys invented cool," he said.
"There's nothing more cutting edge
than this music and these people, and I
want to tip my hat and honor that." More
poignantly, "A New Standard" represents

Sweets Kdison's last recording, which "just
makes the album so spec ial to me," he said.
"I'm so grateful tor the experience, and
have really been privileged to have been
given this music."
I \ roll w ill no doubt be stepping further
into the jaz/. limelight in the near future,
an exciting prospect lor his career.
"I'd forgotten what a privilege it is to
have my own means of expression," he
told me.
"Lsualh as a producer, which is all
about helping others do their thing, I
don't have the opportunitv to express
m\ self c reatively.'
I hat's bound to change, however, as lie
steps into a new frontier.
He's especially excited about introduc
ing the great old standards to college stu
dents. and is even considering coining to
Stanford next fall for a concert and to
speak about his experience.
Helping voting people discover music,
as he did, for the first time, has been one
of the most rewarding parts of "A New
Standard."
"It's been a labor of love and the most
exciting project I've ever been involved
with," he slid. "Isn't it awesome?"
