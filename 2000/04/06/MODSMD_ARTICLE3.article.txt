### MELISSA LAMBERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Since former Stanford Provost
Condolee/./.a Rice does not like to
fish, when she went fishing two
summers ago with Texas Co v.
Ceorge VV. Bush, the likely Re
publican nominee for president,

she would sit as far away as slit'
possibly could from the fishing
pole.
Then, she said in a talk last
night in a Palo Alto home to about
M) members of the Stanford Re
publicans, (he two would talk
about "the Balkans or problems
in Russia or problems with China
or Taiwan."
From this unlikely beginning,
Rice and Bush became friends,
and she agreed to help him orga
nize his foreign policy strategy for
t he campaign.

A threefold role
Rice said she sees her responsi
bility now in the Bush campaign
as threefold. First, she is helping
Bush to develop a foreign policy
agenda; second, she is develop
ing policy positions associated
with that agenda; and third, she is
organizing the "people on whom
he can depend to carry those is
sues forward in the campaign."
"It is really a kick as an acade
mic to get to help someone design
a foreign policy from scratch,"
she said. "A governor of Texas
doesn't have a foreign polity, ex
cept towards Mexico. You get to
really put into play all of these
things that you talked about |in
acadetnia] — what should he the
role of American forces, what role
do values have in American for
eign policy — and you have to
measure it up against the real
world."
Rice visits Austin, Texas about
once a week to work on the cam
paign and talk to Bush about for
eign policy.
Rice said what she likes most
about Bush is that "he is ven
straightforward. That's impor
tant with adversaries and it is
even more important with
friends."
