## Former provost details involvement in Bush's foreign policy agenda 
### MELISSA LAMBERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Since former Stanford Provost
Condolee/./.a Rice does not like to
fish, when she went fishing two
summers ago with Texas Co v.
Ceorge VV. Bush, the likely Re
publican nominee for president,

she would sit as far away as slit'
possibly could from the fishing
pole.
Then, she said in a talk last
night in a Palo Alto home to about
M) members of the Stanford Re
publicans, (he two would talk
about "the Balkans or problems
in Russia or problems with China
or Taiwan."
From this unlikely beginning,
Rice and Bush became friends,
and she agreed to help him orga
nize his foreign policy strategy for
t he campaign.

A threefold role
Rice said she sees her responsi
bility now in the Bush campaign
as threefold. First, she is helping
Bush to develop a foreign policy
agenda; second, she is develop
ing policy positions associated
with that agenda; and third, she is
organizing the "people on whom
he can depend to carry those is
sues forward in the campaign."
"It is really a kick as an acade
mic to get to help someone design
a foreign policy from scratch,"
she said. "A governor of Texas
doesn't have a foreign polity, ex
cept towards Mexico. You get to
really put into play all of these
things that you talked about |in
acadetnia] — what should he the
role of American forces, what role
do values have in American for
eign policy — and you have to
measure it up against the real
world."
Rice visits Austin, Texas about
once a week to work on the cam
paign and talk to Bush about for
eign policy.
Rice said what she likes most
about Bush is that "he is ven
straightforward. That's impor
tant with adversaries and it is
even more important with
friends."


KEVIN SCHEIRER/The Stanford
Former University Provost Condoleezza Rice speaks to the Stanford Repub
licans at a Palo Alto home. Rice described her involvement with Texas Gov
George W. Bush's campaign for president.
Also, she said, "1 think he lias
wonderful judgement and a good
decision-making style," she said.
" There has been a lot written
abofit whether he can name the
president of Chechnya."
"And by the way," she added,
"Chechnya doesn't really have a
president so that reporter was
wrong. But these questions, 'Can
you name this leader?' and Do
you know this capital?' are just
unimportant to the President of
the United States."
"The President of the United
States is the chief executive in
American foreign policy. What
the president has to be able to do
is to set an agenda, get people to
bring him options, know how to
make good judgments about
whether or not this fits the agen
da and whether or not it accords
with principles and values."
Rice said she is often asked to
compare the Governor with his
father. "[President Bush] had re
ally never been out of the Wash

ington environment. George W.
Bush is a Texan and he is a gov
ernor. And being a Texan and a
governor gives you a different
perspective on the world than
having been U.N. ambassador
and congressperson."
Prospects for the future
Asked if she will ever return to
teaching, Rice said, "I've always
liked a career where I've prac
ticed for some time and then
come back to academia. I think
it's made me both a better practi
tioner and a belter academic."
"Eventually I'll come back to
Stanford, absolutely," Rice con
firmed after her talk. "I look for
ward to teaching again."
Rice also addressed rumors
that she would accept a post as
Secretary of State or Secretary of
Defense in a Bush administra
tion.
"I think it is early yet to even
think about what I would do if
Gov. Bush wins," she said. "I
have not really thought, 'Will I go
into government?' I had a great
run last time, and doing this
again would have great costs for
me, so I'll have to cross that

bridge when I come to it."
Befriending the Bushes
In 1989, the national security
advisor under President Bush
asked Rice to come to Washing
ton, telling her, "This fellow Gor
bachev is doing some interesting
things."
Rice laughs about it now. U I
thought, 'Idiot me, well I just got
back to Stanford, 1 just redecorat
ed my condo, I just got tenure,
maybe I ought to go in the second
two years of the Bush administra
tion.' "
It was her best friend who told
her, "What might you miss in the
first two years?"
"Well." she said, "1 would have
missed the reunification of Ger
many, the liberation of Eastern
Europe, the collapse of the Soviet
Union, [and] the Gulf War, so
needless to say I'm really glad I
went when I did."
As special assistant to the pres
ident for foreign affairs, the high
end of her job consisted of writ
ing much of what Bush said to
Gorbachev in their meetings, she
said. The "low end of the job was
making sure the stone ducks
Mrs. Bush sent Mrs. Gorbachev
didn't get broken."
She spent six years beginning
in 1992 at Stanford serving as
provost. "I was not really doinfg
foreign affairs. I was worrying
about tiger salamanders on Stan
ford land or if we were going to
be able to afford a swimming
pool for athletics," she said.
In August 1998, she was in
Kennebunkport, Maine visiting
the Bushes, when George W.
Bush approached her and asked
her if "I would help him with for
eign policy."
That, she said, is where the
fishing came in.
