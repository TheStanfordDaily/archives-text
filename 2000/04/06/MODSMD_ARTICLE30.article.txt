# Trashy 'Wedding' more boring than the real thing
## 
### LAUREN RUSSELL EDITORIAL STAFF 
"Tony and Tina's Wedding" lias been
playing successfully for over a year in San
Francisco, which is just as surprising as the
disappointing performance itself.
The dinner show, which is advertised as
an exciting traditional Italian wedding fol
lowed by a reception and a feast of Italian
food, is a spoof on lower (lass Italian fami
lies. The show generates insulting stereo
types that the show generated (the female
cast was shitty and loud, the men were all
various Ciuido embodiments, and I would
have easily chosen Stern 11 all tuna surprise
over the "least"). Had the food not given
me a stomach ache, it would have been
easy to fall asleep before the show was over.
Many people would pa\ not to sit through
a two-hoiu wedding. While the "Tony and
Tina" cast tries to be entertaining with its
pre-ceremony antics, there is no reason
whv this wedding is an exception. There is

no program with credits for the actors, which they
are probably grateful for. The attempts at humor
were cliche and tasteless. A tattooed, gum-chewing
maid-of-honor wobbles down the aisle, at least 9-
months pregnant. The bridesmaids gossip and flash

their underwear throughout the ceremony. I lie
father of the groom and his 18-year-old stripper
girlfriend are either bickering or exhibiting all types
of PDA. While the portrayal of stereotypical lower
class Italians is funny .it first, it gets old about four
minutes into the show. The audience spends the

next four hours wondering
where the punt li line is and
when this terrible ordeal is
going to end.
After the wedding itsell
comes the reception, which is
held in a tac kil\ decorated
room full of scantilwlad wait
resses who epitomize
"hoochie mama." An unappe
tizing arra\ of appeti/.ei s is
passed around, including
jalapeno poppers, chicken
wings, and other microwave
able supermarket items. I am
not joking. It is difficult to
imagine how the food could
get worse, hut it does. And so
does the perfbrinanc e.
Dinner consists of ven over
cooked spaghetti, a wilted
salad and a dinner roll. Not
one person at mv table ol 12
finished even half of their

food, and it was not because the servings were too
generous. While dinner show food generalh holds
to lower standards than food at a nice restaurant,
Tony and Tina's wedding reception sunk below the
standards of fast food. Most people in the room
would probably have preferred a 99-cent cheese

burger.
Aftet iho "least," the priest gets drunk and begins
to shout obscenities. 1 lie stripper girlfriend decides
to lake oil all but her underwear and dance on the
bar. A light ensues between 1 ina's jealous ex
box friend and lOnv, and eventualh between the
entire (ast.
But in the end. everyone ends up doing the funky
chicken and eating stale wedding cake. As an Italian
mysell, 1 could definite!} relate to the excessive arra)
ol tarnilv drama, atid the events at limy and Tina's
wedding were at least accurate in that sense. We Ital
ians like- to live loudly and with passion. But while
the dramas that the show produces sound entertain
ing. the\ get old taster than xou'd think.
"Tom and Tina's Wedding" max have been less of
a disappointment had it been publicized correctly,
but dumb jokes and sickening (bod are not appeal
ing no inattei how well the\ are advertised. II you
actually want to pax to sit through this four- hour
Hop of a fiasco, make sure to eat dinner beforehand.
