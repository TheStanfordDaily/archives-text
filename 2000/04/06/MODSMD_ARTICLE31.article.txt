# This 'House' needs a foundation
## 
### MONYA DE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As in the novels of Jane Austen,
the plot of Ldith Wharton's " The
House of Mirth" can be summed
up in a few words: getting a girl
married. A new theatrical adapta
tion of the novel, now in produc
tion at by the American Conser
vatory Theater at San Francisco's
Geary Theater, serves as a sort of
"Cliffs' Notes" to the famous
book.
Ciiles Havergal's script takes on
the story of year-old Lily Hart,
an intelligent, independent, and
desperately unmarried woman
living in turn-of-the-century New
York. I ily's money, necessary for
living in the style she desires, is
running out, and her continual
mockery of would-be suitors is
keeping her far away from any
altar.
As she becomes caught in a tan
gle ol men, all older than she and
referred to by their incomes, she
confides her frustrations to a pla
tonic male friend. This friend is
'"starving lawyer" Lawrence
Selden, who is in love with Lilv

but dares not speak, knowing her
expensive tastes and his inability
to provide for them.
Meanwhile, the amorous hus
band of Lily's friend Judy offers
to bail her out of her financial
troubles, leading her to believe
that the huge checks he hands her
are dividends of her own funds.
From the very beginning, the
script is unabashedly overt in
delivering its term-paper themes
with a one-two punch.
The dialogue is full of exposi
tion and is even delivered with
unmistakable emphasis on key
words, leaving nothing to the
imagination. Lily, for instance,
repeatedly informs us that she has
"expensive tastes," instead of
demonstrating the fact indirectly
through action,
Roxanne Raja, a recent conser
vatory graduate, has been cast in
the role of the heroine. While she
sometimes wants for subtlety,
delivering her one-liners with a
plate lull of exaggeration, her
body language is exquisite and
conveys Lily's vulnerabilities in
the face of society's expectations,
as well as her disgust at the out

side world's plans for her future.
The other women in the cast
play mainly comedic roles, and
for the most part their effective
ness is hampered by the same
substitution of overdone farce for
dry wit. Julie Eccles, however, is
an absolute riot as the adulterous
society woman Bertha Dorset
and a second role as the squeaky
voiced Grace Stepney. Her outra
geous hat and jewelry are a per
fect fit for her completely inap
propriate behavior and com
ments.
J. Paul Boehmer is effective as
Lawrence Selden, the poor
lawyer whose day is complete
when he has seen Lily, and to
whom circumstance leads into a
terrible misunderstanding about
Lily's relationship with Judy's
husband. Their banter is engaging
and real, even when they argue
the same topic over and over (like
Lily's marriage potential and
expensive tastes). Some of
Havergal's most believable writ
ing makes the stage dissolve
away, leaving just a familiar scene
— two friends who disagree on
one contentious point.

Selden's thought patterns match
Lily's so well that it is clear they
were meant to be.
Havergal's direction beautifully
depicts important elements of life
at the turn of the century, such as
letter-writing. Letters are read
throughout, but in one standout
scene, maids dart between a
group of writers and recipients,
delivering new letters as the writ
ers read their words aloud. It is a
fitting metaphor for the web of
social intrigue that formed the
entertainment of the time.
Not surprisingly, the local gos
sip weekly was another favorite
pastime, and Havergal's actors
deliver effective transitions by
announcing the "Society Notes,"
the latest bulletins of
weddings, parties, or teas.
Anna Oliver's costumes and
Kate Edmunds' sets are veritable
eye candy. The materials swathe
the production in elegant pastels.
The transitions between settings
(as varied as a wedding, the
opera, and a horse carriage) are
seamless often using just lighting
and a turned chair or two to con
siderable effect.

There is much to be appreciated
in this production, despite the
feeling that one is being spoon
fed themes and characters.
It may not have the nuances of
a novel, but "The House of
Mirth" certainly captures the
spirit of the work.
