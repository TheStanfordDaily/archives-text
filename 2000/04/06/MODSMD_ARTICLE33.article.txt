## 'High Fidelity' saved by the music 
### DANIEL MOREAU 
"High Fidelity," an ironic pun on main charactei Rob's
(John Cusack) love life which has been based on anything
lan trust and faithfulness, opens with a scene all too famil
iar to the lead protagonist; bis most recent girlfriend Laura
(Iben lljejle) is moving out of bis apartment, a slnine to
vinyl records, and dumping bitu.
Ii seems as though the only thing Rob can count on in
life is music, which is embodied in his cynically unliip and
almost pcrpetuall) nostalgic allinity lor the eighties.
"What tame first, the music or the miser)?" are the fiisi
words Rob speaks to the camera, in front of which he is
constantly buzzing with detail-filling plot summaries and
reminiscences of past, unfaithful love.
When Rob is not getting dumped, he is re-organizing bis
retold toilet lion, making compilations (something equal
It) the art ol poetry, he says), and making up various lop
five lists in the record shop be owns and runs with an assis
tani who torments and snubs the customers because ol
tlicit lame musical predilections. I lie scenes of sardonic
bantei in the record shop are some of the film's high
points.
I be screenplay, a collaboration of D.Y. DeVint'cutis,
Cusack, Sieve fink and Scott Michael Rosenberg, adapted
from Nic k llornbv's novel, creeps forward sluggishly with
too mitt h reliance on Rob narrating lo I lie camera.
Largely, the plot involves Rob getting bis girl back
whom, he fears, lias fallen in love with a middle-aged, long
haired hippie played by I in 1 Robbins, whose putative sex

ual prowess brings out the worst of Rob's insecurities.
Kventually, Rob overcomes these insecurities by dig
ging up his past girlfriends to find out why they had
clumped him, reasons which both validate and vindi
cate him.
In a top five list of most excruciating breakups, we
catch glimpses ol his ex-girlfriends (one of whom this
male readership will pleased to know is Catherine Zeta-
Joncs) through flashbacks which depict a gruff John
Cusack in lull eighties grab—black leather jacket with
chains and all.
In "High Fidelity," John Cusack further cultivates a
character thai made his career in the 1980s: the pen
sive, brooding, jaded, socially marginalized slacker fig
ure who talks about music with scholarly eloquence.
Like the character Rob, the actor Cusack seems forev
er stuck in the 80s, reminiscent of "Crosse l'ointe
Blank" which officially heralded the resurgence of 80s
chic. Cusack, already an 80s icon from such films as
"Better off Dead" and "Say Anything," continues to this
da) to play the same role — only a decade later now,
no longer living at bis parents' house but in a New
York hovel.

I'lie tireless conversation of music trivia in the record
store among Rob and his co-workers is the main quality that
i edceins the movie from treacly sentimentality. Indeed, you
become dewy-eyed less from the "boy meets girl / boy loses
girl" narrative than from the nostalgic pang of songs that
punctuated your own early youth.
