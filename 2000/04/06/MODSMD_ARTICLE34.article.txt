# 'Black and White' unsuccessfully examines race
## 
### FREDERICK VALLAEYS STAFF WRITER 
It's lit >l oltcu \ (>i i 11 set- a raw and ai isy film that's stalling a
well-known cast with the likes ol Brooke Shields, Robert
Downey Jr. and lien Stiller. In James I obac k's "Black and
White." this c ast is joined by Mike I yson, who gets a chance to
plav himself in ibis film about the racial dividing lines of life.
Despite iis <|iiality cast, this film does not work ver\ well. It
ii us i<» tackle too many issues all at once, and the result is a
hodge-pc>dge ol strange, under-devek>ped plot lines. I he film,
set in New (»rk, starts with an inter-racial threesome in the
park and from there it <|iii( klv gets into the racial issues sur
rounding music, sports, gambling and crime.
I he ici it 1 a I character ol the film is Rich (l\ nver of Wu-Tang
( lan), a gang leader and hip-hop artist. When he is trying to
record .1 new album, the recording studio owner sends him
aw.iv because he does not want to deal with dead bodies "niys
teriousK showing up in |liis] lobby." When Rich returns the
next da\ with bis white manager, the race issue disappears and
ilu- deal to use the studio is sealed in a matter ol minutes.
While the older generation ol white people, like the studio
owner, tend to fear and avoid black hip-hop aitists, the
voungei generation seems to be draw n to them. (iliai lie (Bijou
Phillips), an upper-middle class teenager, and herothei white
Ii lends (including f.lijah Wood) have re-invented themselves
to walk and talk like Rich in order to impress him.
I lie main point of "Black and White" is to understand this
partic ulai case of the blui ring of the racial divide, but it is not
particularly su< cess In I. finding the answei to this central c|iics
-11011 is the job of documentary filmmaker Sam (Shields) and
her ver\ ga\ husband I'crrv (Downey Jr., who gets himsell in
constant trouble by making passes at straight men).
I he most interesting sub-plot in the sior\ is that ol Dean
(Allan Houston), Rich's best friend and a college basketball
stai. Ile is approac heel l>\ Mark, <1 sports-gambler who offers
him $">O,OOO to fix a game. Dean consults his brainy girlfriend
(ireta ((llaudia Schiller) about taking the money or not. In her
academic way, she tells him that he must do what he believes
is right. I he consequences of Dean taking the money are the
best reason to go see this film.
Anotlici interesting sequence lakes place w hen l erry makes
a pass at I yson (playing himself). After getting into a scuffle,
both ex-cons start disc ussing the (lownsides ol going to jail.
In the (lilting room, ibis film was put together as a docu
mcntan look at the lives of the characters. As a result, some of
the transitions are pretty abrupt and there are even visible
editing c uts inidwax through actors' sentences, giving this film
a very raw feel.
Despite having some amusing scent sand very competent
acting throughout, "Black and White" suiters from a lack of

direction. I his film is
probably not intended for
the least-common
denominator audience,
l)iii it tan be an interest
ing picture if you know
what you're in for.
