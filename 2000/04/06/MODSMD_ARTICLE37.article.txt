## Ghostface Killah shows off 'Supreme' talent 
### LUKE MINER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Overshadowed in the past by Method Man, Redman, GZA
and RZA, Ghostface Killah has always been one of the less
well-known members of the Wu-Tang Clan. But with the
release of his latest album "Supreme Clientele," all that is
about to change. Complete with highly evolved beats, precise
sampling, and lucid rhyming, "Supreme Clientele" is arguably
the best Wu-release since Wu-Tang Forever.
True to Wu form, RZA kicks the album off with a sample
from the 60s Ironman cartoon. The first track "Nutmeg" is a
superb production featuring a flute solo by Black Moes-Art
that constantly deteriorates only to be rebuilt to its original
state on the next beat.
The disc's first single "Apollo Kids" is another excellent
track featuring verse by Raekwon and competent beats laid
down by the relatively new producer Hassan. In "Child's
Play" Ghostface reminisces back to the days when everything
was much simpler and apparently much more sexually explic
it.
The sampling on this track is particularly intricate offering
the listener pleasant surprise after pleasant surprise. The
strongest track on the album, however, is "Buck 50." Unsur
prisingly it is also the most reminiscent of earlier Wu projects.
While RZA lays down solid and characteristically original
beats, Cappadonna, Mastah Killah, Redman and Method
Man each take turns on the mike. Method Man's ingeniously
subtle performance stands out as the high point of this track.
For all its strengths, "Supreme Clientele" also possesses sev-

eral weak songs. "Ghost Deini" is especially dull, beg
ging to be skipped the moment it is heard. With horri
ble rhymes from Subherb and off key shout-outs to
Biggie and Tupac "Ghost Deini" is easily the worst

track on the album.
The song "We Made It," however, comes in a very
close second. Ghostface's self-indulgent lyrics about
the size of his diamond rings and the age of his

cognac ruin a perfectly good beat laid out by RZA.
In general Ghostface's lyrics are so claus
trophobic and complex that they are almost impos
sible to decipher. Lines like "Ghost is back, stretch
Cadillacs, fruit cocktails/Hit the shelves at cuz's
pastry rack/Walk with me, like Dorothy/Try to
judge these plush degrees," make one wonder
whether his verses are supposed to have any

meaning at all.
Fortunately comprehension of Ghostface's
lyrics is not necessary to enjoy the album. His
wonderfully urgent and melodic flow in combi
nation with RZA's superb production will keep
you bumping late into the night.
