# Graceful Larrieux fails to fulfill all of her 'Possibilities'
## 
### RENEE CANADA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a mystical blue background and the peaceful-look
ing face of Amel Larrieux on the cover of her debut solo
album, 1 felt as if, by listening to "Infinite Possibilities," 1
would be entering the inner depths of Larrieux's soul.
Unfortunately, despite the exotic package, this album,
with a couple exceptions, was a shallow dive into the
cliche of female-led R&B/hip-hop music.
"Infinite Possibilities" is Larrieux's first solo album, but
fans may remember her from the short-lived hip hop duo.
Groove Theory. Feeling the frustrations of having to
mimic the vocal gymnastics of Whitney Houston and
Mariah Carey, Larrieux joined up with former rapper
Bryce Wilson to explore sensual and romantic themes
through hip-hop music with Groove Theory.
In this album, Larrieux explores deeper themes of
racism, religious intolerance, and coming of age, which
sets her a bit above her fellow R&B songwriters.
She also plays several of the instruments on her album,
including keyboards and Rhodes organ.
Unfortunately, her voice does not ever break away from
phrasings and ornamentations used by fellow women
vocalists like Monica and Brandy. In addition, she never
quite escapes the pressures of trying to be like Whitney
1 iouston.
A Rhodes organ creates a gospel mood for Larrieux's
"Even If." If I lost my eyes, I could swear this was a Whit
ney Houston tune, except that it lacks the growling orna
mentations that are Houston's trademark. Towards the
end of the song, Larrieux seems to find her own voice, as
she is backed by a studio-produced gospel chorus, but it's
almost too late for a listener to really appreciate this song.
It's not until track 8, "down," that we truly get a sense
that Larrieux is anyone unique in the R&B genre. The
song opens with a lone upright bass that walks into a
catchy, jazz piece. Larrieux's deep and foggy voice, remi
niscent of Ella Fitzgerald in the lower ranges, and simple
piano accompaniment are juxtaposed with Prodigy-like
programmed drum beats. Cliche lyrics expand after the
bridge into a tongue-twisting word play worthy of the best
vocal acrobats. Larrieux shines brightest here.
The last track "Make Me Whole" is a touching ode to
love in which Larrieux's soft, smooth vocals are accompa
nied by a lone piano. Unfortunately, Larrieux doesn't take
advantage of the sparseness of the piece to expand into
the vocal richness that previous tracks hint she is capable
of.
Larrieux has a pretty voice which works best with natu
ral, lush instrumentation like piano and strings. It's a pity
that she traps herself in the limiting R&B / hip-hop genre
on this album

UII HUM uII'UIU.
One hopes that in
future albums she
will break free from
the generic and really
explore the infinite
possibilities that the
musical world has to
offer her.
