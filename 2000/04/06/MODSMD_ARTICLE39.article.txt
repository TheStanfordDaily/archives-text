# Sakamoto provides a different kind of classical

Like most tans of classical piano, when I got a
chance to hear a new classical album, "BTTB," I
jumped at it. And, it didn't matter that the pianist
— Ryuichi Sakamato — was someone I hadn't heard
of. I've always subscribed to the notion that at the
professional level, what the artist is playing matters
more to me than who the artist is.
That is of course, an arguable point and probably
reveals that I'm not yet fully capable of appreciating
the varying styles of different musicians. Neverthe
less, when I first took a look at the CD case and
played some of the tracks, I realized that this wasn't
exactly what I had expected or perhaps was even
looking for.
Instead of hearing nieces from familiar rnrrmrmers

like Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, or
Deßussy, I was listening to
unknown works from a compos
er that I had never heard of. It
turns out that Sakamoto is actu
ally a really well known musician
and composer from Japan and
has written works for films like
"The Last Emperor" and "Little

P"
"BTTB"

Buddha." On top of that, he has released a number
of CD's of which, "BTTB," is the latest.
Though I was treading on unfamiliar territory
here — I haven't really listened or taken much of an
interest in modern composers — but it turned out to
be a fairly enjoyable experience. At first the pieces
on the album sounded the same, but as I listened to
more tracks I started to notice the differences and
appreciate the music for its artistic quality. Some of
the ones I liked were "Energy Flow," "Opus,"
"Lorenz and Watson," and "Chanson."
Granted, it isn't as distinctive and immediately
catchy as some of the well-known pieces from the
more famous classical composers but it has its mer
its. Of course at the same time, in his work you can
still detect many stylistic elements that have been
borrowed 112 rom other composers. Most of the music
on the album has a very subdued tone — the kind

you expect to hear on a quiet
rainy winter day. So if you're
hoping to listen to something
with more flair, this is not.
Regardless, if you're fond of clas
sical piano this might be some
thing to take a look at. This
modern stuff may not be such an
acquired taste after all.
