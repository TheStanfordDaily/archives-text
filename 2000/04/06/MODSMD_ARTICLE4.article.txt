## 
### BARNALI DASVERMA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ending weeks of student speculation, Directoi of
Residential Education Jane Camarillo announced
yesterday that Whitman House iu Cowell Cluster
has been assigned to the I'i Beta Phi sororitv lor next
year.
Whitman was chosen from a group ol lour hous
es under consideration. I he other three, Hob, ()80
Lomita and Narnia had "strong arguments lor re
maining available to the general draw of under
graduates," Camarillo's press release stated.
Narnia will remain in the Draw because it con
tains the largest number of two-room doubles in the
group. Hob will sta\ because it has been the "most
consistently desirable (tor men) in the Draw" among
the four, according to the press release. fuSO Lomita
was not chosen due to concerns that its \icinit\
would become solidly Creek, and the location would
thus be lost to non-Creek students.
Nolan (Cabrera, a sophomore who had planned to
be a social manager at Whitman next year, was criti
cal ol the process. "It's a ver\ elitist wa\ of deal-

ing ... to use prime housing to
support an exclusive organiza
tion." Cabrera added, "A lot of
people can't afford the Creek sys
tem. . . . We were the cream of the
crop in high school . . . why does
the social hierarchy have to be in
stilled on campus?"
Cabrera added, "I have ab
solutely nothing against sororities
existing on campus. 1 have a prob
lem when exclusive organizations
get preferential treatment."
Junior Travis Maak, a Whit
man social manager, raised an
other point of controversy, stat
ing, "My major sadness ... is that
there will be fewer opportunities
for social life with respect to the
rest of campus. . . . For example,
Heaven and Hell' [a traditional
Whitman party] will be gone."
Maak said that while sororities
may give back to the community
through service, this "doesn't af
fect campus life."
Pi Phi President Jessica Sisco, a
junior, responded by emphasiz
ing her sorority's plans to include
"programming for women and
community events."
, Sisco gave examples of pro
gramming which would be open
,tjO the entire Stanford communi
ty, including self-defense work
shops and speakers on interview
ing skills for upperclassmen.
~ She mentioned salsa lessons as
jtnother possibility.
"We have a member who is an
avid salsa dancer," she said.
Pi Phi Rush Chair Elsa
.\Valther-Meade, a sophomore,
said, "I feel that in our housing
proposal we really tried to come
up with programming that is ac
cessible to the community in gen
eral. . . . Even from before, we
knew we wanted to give back."
Karr Narula, Whitman's other
social manager, said, "We felt
there was no say given [to Whit
man residents]. When we met

with [Camarilla], the feeling I got
was . . . she felt that because Whit
man wasn't a co-op or theme
house, there was no culture. . . .
That is totally ridiculous."
Narula mentioned that some
residents have lived in Whitman
for two or three years. "A good
portion of next year's [prospec
tive] staff got screwed .... Had
they known [earlier], they would
have applied elsewhere," he
added.
Jay Saldivar, a Whitman resi
dent who planned on being a so
cial manager at the house next
year, was especially disappointed.
"1 was guaranteed staff here. . . .
Residents vote for staff. 1 wish Res
Ed would have gone about this in
a different way."
Maak said lie believes .that it is
"kind of weird" that Residential
Education would place the Pi Phis
in Cowell (Muster, where the I)elta
Delta Delta and Kappa Alpha
I beta sororities already reside.
Offering a different perspec
tive on the issue, Siscosaid, "Pi Phi
is very excited to have the support
of the of the sororities currently
housed in the (lowell Cluster."
I he Residential Education
statement explained, "Whitman
House, adding to a cluster
of two sorority houses, will be the
last house in the Cowell Cluster
assigned to Creek organizations. .
. . The selection of Whitman puts
all housed sorority organizations
on par with one another in terms
of the challenges of maintaining
the occupancy of the house."
Camarillo said that all housed
Creek organizations are evaluat
ed on an annual basis on criteria
that includes financial viability,
membership and "demonstrated
support for Res Ed program
ming."
ASSU President Mike Levin, a
junior, expressed disappoint
ment over Camarillo's decision,
issuing a statement that said,
"While we feel that the Pi Beta Phi
Sorority is deserving of a house

. . . [w]e believe that awarding a
house with such a high draw
number is not in the best interests
of the entire undergraduate pop
ulation.''
Levin said that the student
voice was not properly included
in the decision-making process.
His main suggestion was that "the
ASSU Nominations Commission
must be allowed to nominate the
student members of all future
(ireek 1 lousing Committees."
Camarillo responded by say
ing, "I'm going for overall student
representation. I think students
will be faithful to the process."
She added that the Greek
I lousing Review Board consists ol
a variety of students, including
representatives from the Inter
sorority and 1 nterfraternity
Councils, as well as two ASSI'-af
filiated students: one ASSI sena
tor and one representative ap
pointed l)y the nominations coin
mission.
1 lie decision of Whitman was
reached following an elaborate
process during which Camarillo
visited each house under consid
eration, most during the first
week of spi ing quarter.
Camarillo then "heard from
the communities . . . [about] what
each community offered to the
general population" at Stanford.
Student input was also ob
tained through a question in the
residential education surveys. In
addition, a Creek housing forum
was held last week at I residder
during which all Stanford stu
dents were given an opportunity
to provide feedback, Camarillo
said.
Camarillo also acknowledged
the limitations on upper-class
housing, stating, "We are serious
ly constrained."
Speaking of the future, (lainar
illo said, "In the event were are
able to acquire [new housing] or
there is new construction, my goal
is to ensure that it is used to create
prime upper-class housing."

ASSU President Mike Levin, a
junior, expressed disappoint
ment over Camarillo's decision,
issuing a statement that said,
"While we feel that the Pi Beta Phi
Sorority is deserving of a house

. . . [w]e believe that awarding a
house with such a high draw
number is not in the best interests
of the entire undergraduate pop
ulation.''
Levin said that the student
voice was not properly included
in the decision-making process.
His main suggestion was that "the
ASSU Nominations Commission
must be allowed to nominate the
student members of all future
(ireek 1 lousing Committees."
Camarillo responded by say
ing, "I'm going for overall student
representation. I think students
will be faithful to the process."
She added that the Greek
I lousing Review Board consists ol
a variety of students, including
representatives from the Inter
sorority and 1 nterfraternity
Councils, as well as two ASSI'-af
filiated students: one ASSI sena
tor and one representative ap

1 lie decision of Whitman was
reached following an elaborate
process during which Camarillo
visited each house under consid
eration, most during the first
week of spi ing quarter.
Camarillo then "heard from
the communities . . . [about] what
each community offered to the
general population" at Stanford.
Student input was also ob
tained through a question in the
residential education surveys. In
addition, a Creek housing forum
was held last week at I residder
during which all Stanford stu
dents were given an opportunity
to provide feedback, Camarillo
said.
Camarillo also acknowledged
the limitations on upper-class
housing, stating, "We are serious
ly constrained."
Speaking of the future, (lainar
illo said, "In the event were are
able to acquire [new housing] or
there is new construction, my goal
is to ensure that it is used to create
prime upper-class housing."
Ending weeks of student speculation, Directoi of
Residential Education Jane Camarillo announced
yesterday that Whitman House iu Cowell Cluster
has been assigned to the I'i Beta Phi sororitv lor next
year.
Whitman was chosen from a group ol lour hous
es under consideration. I he other three, Hob, ()80
Lomita and Narnia had "strong arguments lor re
maining available to the general draw of under
graduates," Camarillo's press release stated.
Narnia will remain in the Draw because it con
tains the largest number of two-room doubles in the
group. Hob will sta\ because it has been the "most
consistently desirable (tor men) in the Draw" among
the four, according to the press release. fuSO Lomita
was not chosen due to concerns that its \icinit\
would become solidly Creek, and the location would
thus be lost to non-Creek students.
Nolan (Cabrera, a sophomore who had planned to
be a social manager at Whitman next year, was criti
cal ol the process. "It's a ver\ elitist wa\ of deal-

Phi move in, joining the women of Delta Delta Delta and Kappa Alpha Theta.
ing ... to use prime housing to
support an exclusive organiza
tion." Cabrera added, "A lot of
people can't afford the Creek sys
tem. . . . We were the cream of the
crop in high school . . . why does
the social hierarchy have to be in
stilled on campus?"
Cabrera added, "I have ab
solutely nothing against sororities
existing on campus. 1 have a prob
lem when exclusive organizations
get preferential treatment."
Junior Travis Maak, a Whit
man social manager, raised an
other point of controversy, stat
ing, "My major sadness ... is that
there will be fewer opportunities
for social life with respect to the
rest of campus. . . . For example,
Heaven and Hell' [a traditional
Whitman party] will be gone."
Maak said that while sororities
may give back to the community
through service, this "doesn't af
fect campus life."
Pi Phi President Jessica Sisco, a
junior, responded by emphasiz
ing her sorority's plans to include
"programming for women and
community events."
, Sisco gave examples of pro
gramming which would be open
,tjO the entire Stanford communi
ty, including self-defense work
shops and speakers on interview
ing skills for upperclassmen.
~ She mentioned salsa lessons as
jtnother possibility.
"We have a member who is an
avid salsa dancer," she said.
Pi Phi Rush Chair Elsa
.\Valther-Meade, a sophomore,
said, "I feel that in our housing
proposal we really tried to come
up with programming that is ac
cessible to the community in gen
eral. . . . Even from before, we
knew we wanted to give back."
Karr Narula, Whitman's other
social manager, said, "We felt
there was no say given [to Whit
man residents]. When we met

with [Camarilla], the feeling I got
was . . . she felt that because Whit
man wasn't a co-op or theme
house, there was no culture. . . .
That is totally ridiculous."
Narula mentioned that some
residents have lived in Whitman
for two or three years. "A good
portion of next year's [prospec
tive] staff got screwed .... Had
they known [earlier], they would
have applied elsewhere," he
added.
Jay Saldivar, a Whitman resi
dent who planned on being a so
cial manager at the house next
year, was especially disappointed.
"1 was guaranteed staff here. . . .
Residents vote for staff. 1 wish Res
Ed would have gone about this in
a different way."
Maak said lie believes .that it is
"kind of weird" that Residential
Education would place the Pi Phis
in Cowell (Muster, where the I)elta
Delta Delta and Kappa Alpha
I beta sororities already reside.
Offering a different perspec
tive on the issue, Siscosaid, "Pi Phi
is very excited to have the support
of the of the sororities currently
housed in the (lowell Cluster."
I he Residential Education
statement explained, "Whitman
House, adding to a cluster
of two sorority houses, will be the
last house in the Cowell Cluster
assigned to Creek organizations. .
. . The selection of Whitman puts
all housed sorority organizations
on par with one another in terms
of the challenges of maintaining
the occupancy of the house."
Camarillo said that all housed
Creek organizations are evaluat
ed on an annual basis on criteria
that includes financial viability,
membership and "demonstrated
support for Res Ed program
ming."
