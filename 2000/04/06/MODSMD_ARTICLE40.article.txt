# Rockfords better off apart
## 
### ALEXIS TYGENHOF 
Five of the hottest Seattle musicians have recently
combined their talents and their love of rock to pro
duce twelve songs, thus creating the Rockfords' first
self-titled album.
The group is composed of Mike McCready, the gui
tarist from Pearl Jam; Chris Friel, the drummer from
Goodness; Danny Newcomb, the guitarist from Good
ness; Rick Friel, the bassist from Jodie Watts; and Car
rie Akre, the vocalist from Goodness. Heart vocalist
Nancy Wilson makes a guest appearance in "River
wide."
The musicians' passion and fame carries their album
more than the music itself. Unfortunately, the creators
are infinitely superior to their creation. The songs are

infused their otherwise uninspired songs with a fero
cious honesty and emotion, and McCready has given
the group a gripping grittiness that makes their music
worth listening to. Carrie Akre's voice complements
his edge with an alluring lyricism.
The album suffers mostly from poor sequencing. All
of the songs are good, but "Riverwide," "Island," and
"Sureshot," which are the most memorable of the lot,
are last on the album. Consequently, by the time you
reach them, you have already been entranced by the
monotony of the first half of the album. They come too
late to make the album work as a whole.
The Rockfords are special because of the talent they
combine. They have a good sound and intense energy.
Their songs are great to listen to, but they don't stick
with you pass the duration of their playing time.
