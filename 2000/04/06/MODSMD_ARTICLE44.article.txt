# Sass has fun with grass
## 
### 
(Lan you smell the need for sex
in the air? (The scent is some
thing like fresh honeysuckle on
a breeze.) It's currently wafting
ac ross campus. Any minute now
it's going to stalk up to you and
look you in the eye. Everyone
you know who normally looks
"average" will suddenly look
like something you'd like to rub
up against. You're reminded of
Robert Merrick's poem "To the
Virgins, to Make Much of
lime," and you're wondering if
this applies to you. Right?
If you're anything like Miss
Sass, all this hare skin, this
resemblance to a sex flush on
everyone you meet, and the
phenomenon of spring level
makes you 111 N(«RY. Hungry
for pleasure, hungn for a juic \
treat.

Miss Sass suggests a picnic lo heal up a
spiing evening, li s ilic perfec I chance to try
out new edible sex lovs and potential aphro
disiacs.
First, Miss Sass suggests you find a partner
who won't mind if you slap mosquitoes off his
back during an intimate moment. I ruly. this
is a iiccessitv f< >r lovers preparing lo enjoy the
great outdoors. Next, you need a private
spot with a nice view — sunsets or oceans arc
ideal. You'll want to spread out .1 blanket lor
sitting, lying and lic king on, and set up c an
dles il vou want the mood lo be panic ularlv
inviting.
l inallv, you'll need your trust) pic nic bas
ket. sloe k lull ol viiinniies like reel wine, straw
berries, (h<>< olate sv nip, bite-si/ed sandwich
es, ice. raw vegetables with dip and crepes.
Am of these treats c < mid serve as <111 aphro
disiac 10 enhance libido and pleasure. Con
siclering that ovei .">()() substances have been
reported as love-lbod, vei none were effective
in controlled experiments, it seems likelv that
any food could enhance vom sexual pleasure
if you want il to. Krolic options allegedlv
include potions ol pine nuts, blood of bats
mixed with clonkev's milk, dried salamandei,
wings of bees, turtle's eggs, ants, vineyard
snails, swallow's hearts and more.
Miss Sass expects strawberries sound even
more appeti/ing than usual after such a list.
Keeping that in niincl, these suggested loods
are only special because of the wa\ Miss Sass
recommends you "eat" them.
Red Wine: II a whole song can be written
about it. maybe il c an do s<anething to rev up
your love* life. Certainly a glass of ibis will
relax both of you, readying vou to enjoy each
other. Red wine is also ideal for pouring onto
the body and licking off. I lie sight and feel
ing of a translucent red river between the
breasts can be particularly pleasing for both

Strawberries: I lie sweetest kiss you can give
is ;i strawberry kiss. Ilold (he strawberry
between your teeth and present ii to your
lover, who then leans over to take an enthusi
ast it bite out ol it while kissing you. let the
jui(e run down your chins and then li< kit oil
each other. Strawberries are also ol an ideal
size lor nudging slight 1\ into a woman's vagi
na, il von prefer something sweet to munch
011. I lie strawberr) can be plated just at the
opening, and the woman can bold ii using
the pubo<(X( ygeus muscle, the muscle thai
surrounds the vaginal opening, lie careful
not lo press ii in too lai.
Chocolate syrup: Dip vour strawberries
into a bowl of this and leed them to each
other, or take the strawberr) kiss one step lur
ther. (chocolate svrup is also ideal lor artwork.
You can finger paint designs on each other
and then kiss them oil Or if vou preferred
not to color between the lines in kinder
garten, perhaps vou'd ratfiei just use the
whole bottle lor an exercise in splatter paint
ing. Imagine pouring < hocolale all over vour
lover's nude bod\ in long lines and streaks
Bite-si/ed Sandwiches: A classic lingei
lood. Clearly, you should leed your lover
ratbei than yourself in ibis case. I'ingei sand
mouths are siu 11 an integral part of sexual
activities that it makes sense that using your
lingei s to place I bod in someone else's mouth
or lic king lood of someone's lingers would be
an erotic activity. Miss Sass recommends
asparagus and c ream cheese sandwiches, as
asparagus is another alleged aphrodisiac, and
the c ream < >11 the sandwich will make chew ing
a sensual experience. Be circumspect with the
asparagus, however, as its consumption has a
tendency to affect the smell ol urine, so it may
also affect the smell or taste of other excre-

lions from the nether regions.
Ice: If yon happen to be
using a cooler for storage, you
probably have some of this
anyway. On a warm evening,
especially after some exertion
on your blanket, a piece of ice
caressed over the body is a
great way to cool down. Put
the ice in your mouth and give
it to youi partner during an
erotic kiss. Or you can push
the ice between your lady's
legs — you won't have to
worry about getting it back
out, as it will simply melt and
create an incredible juxtaposi
tion between her body heat
and the melting ice cube.
She'll feel it getting smaller
and smaller as you lick her
towards an orgasm.

Ice and oral sex go well together both ways.
I ,aclies, put two small ice t übes in your mouth
and try giving him a blowjob. He, too, will
enjoy the feeling of youi warm mouth (ou
tlasted with the cold ice, and he can try to
concentrate on the feeling of the ice cubes
melting and then disappearing.
Raw Vegetables with Dip: Miss Sass recom
mends finding a vegetable clip that's creatm
but not runnv. Pout it or spread it between
the wc hnan's breasts, put a cai rot or a piece of
broccoli in your lnotith, and clip it into lite
"Ranch Valley."' You can then either eat it
yourself or give it to your lover, still using
youi mouth. ()nce the dip has been poured,
you shouldn't use your hands at all.
Crepes: I hese are a lovely dessert to eat
alone, but they can also be used very sexual
ly. \ ou can make a cream and c hocolate
c repe on the spot, wrap it around bis penis,
and very gentl\ eat it off, being careful not to
let vour teeth press too hard against his sensi
tive skin. He'll enjoy the novelty, and you'll
enjoy the taste.
Kac h of these explorations with food should
be considered a wa\ to build intimac)
between you and your loved one. \'ou should
both be comfortable with eveiything you're
doing, be having fun, and enjoying your
sharing of this new erotic experience.
Miss Sass recognizes that you don't have the
time 01 the energy to stage a five-course din
ner every night, just like you don't create a
comparable production every lime you have
sex.
But certainly, you should take the opportu
nity when you have it.
Use this picnic as an excuse to stop settling
for the sexual —and digestible — equivalent
of fast lood!

if you want il to. Krolic options allegedlv
include potions ol pine nuts, blood of bats
mixed with clonkev's milk, dried salamandei,
wings of bees, turtle's eggs, ants, vineyard
snails, swallow's hearts and more.
Miss Sass expects strawberries sound even
more appeti/ing than usual after such a list.
Keeping that in niincl, these suggested loods
are only special because of the wa\ Miss Sass
recommends you "eat" them.
Red Wine: II a whole song can be written
about it. maybe il c an do s<anething to rev up
your love* life. Certainly a glass of ibis will
relax both of you, readying vou to enjoy each
other. Red wine is also ideal for pouring onto
the body and licking off. I lie sight and feel
ing of a translucent red river between the
breasts can be particularly pleasing for both

Strawberries: I lie sweetest kiss you can give
is ;i strawberry kiss. Ilold (he strawberry
between your teeth and present ii to your
lover, who then leans over to take an enthusi
ast it bite out ol it while kissing you. let the
jui(e run down your chins and then li< kit oil

opening, and the woman can bold ii using
the pubo<(X( ygeus muscle, the muscle thai
surrounds the vaginal opening, lie careful
not lo press ii in too lai.
Chocolate syrup: Dip vour strawberries
into a bowl of this and leed them to each
other, or take the strawberr) kiss one step lur
ther. (chocolate svrup is also ideal lor artwork.
You can finger paint designs on each other
and then kiss them oil Or if vou preferred
not to color between the lines in kinder
garten, perhaps vou'd ratfiei just use the
whole bottle lor an exercise in splatter paint
ing. Imagine pouring < hocolale all over vour
lover's nude bod\ in long lines and streaks
Bite-si/ed Sandwiches: A classic lingei
lood. Clearly, you should leed your lover
ratbei than yourself in ibis case. I'ingei sand
mouths are siu 11 an integral part of sexual
activities that it makes sense that using your
lingei s to place I bod in someone else's mouth
or lic king lood of someone's lingers would be
an erotic activity. Miss Sass recommends
asparagus and c ream cheese sandwiches, as
asparagus is another alleged aphrodisiac, and
the c ream < >11 the sandwich will make chew ing
a sensual experience. Be circumspect with the
asparagus, however, as its consumption has a
tendency to affect the smell ol urine, so it may
also affect the smell or taste of other excre-

lions from the nether regions.
Ice: If yon happen to be
using a cooler for storage, you
probably have some of this
anyway. On a warm evening,
especially after some exertion
on your blanket, a piece of ice
caressed over the body is a
great way to cool down. Put
the ice in your mouth and give
it to youi partner during an
erotic kiss. Or you can push
the ice between your lady's
legs — you won't have to
worry about getting it back
out, as it will simply melt and
create an incredible juxtaposi
tion between her body heat
and the melting ice cube.
She'll feel it getting smaller
and smaller as you lick her
towards an orgasm.

Ice and oral sex go well together both ways.
I ,aclies, put two small ice t übes in your mouth
and try giving him a blowjob. He, too, will
enjoy the feeling of youi warm mouth (ou
tlasted with the cold ice, and he can try to
concentrate on the feeling of the ice cubes
melting and then disappearing.
Raw Vegetables with Dip: Miss Sass recom
mends finding a vegetable clip that's creatm
but not runnv. Pout it or spread it between
the wc hnan's breasts, put a cai rot or a piece of
broccoli in your lnotith, and clip it into lite
"Ranch Valley."' You can then either eat it
yourself or give it to your lover, still using
youi mouth. ()nce the dip has been poured,
you shouldn't use your hands at all.
Crepes: I hese are a lovely dessert to eat
alone, but they can also be used very sexual
ly. \ ou can make a cream and c hocolate
c repe on the spot, wrap it around bis penis,
and very gentl\ eat it off, being careful not to
let vour teeth press too hard against his sensi
tive skin. He'll enjoy the novelty, and you'll
enjoy the taste.
Kac h of these explorations with food should
be considered a wa\ to build intimac)
between you and your loved one. \'ou should
both be comfortable with eveiything you're
doing, be having fun, and enjoying your
sharing of this new erotic experience.
Miss Sass recognizes that you don't have the
time 01 the energy to stage a five-course din
ner every night, just like you don't create a
comparable production every lime you have
sex.
But certainly, you should take the opportu
nity when you have it.
Use this picnic as an excuse to stop settling
for the sexual —and digestible — equivalent
of fast lood!

(Lan you smell the need for sex
in the air? (The scent is some
thing like fresh honeysuckle on
a breeze.) It's currently wafting
ac ross campus. Any minute now
it's going to stalk up to you and
look you in the eye. Everyone
you know who normally looks
"average" will suddenly look
like something you'd like to rub
up against. You're reminded of
Robert Merrick's poem "To the
Virgins, to Make Much of
lime," and you're wondering if
this applies to you. Right?
If you're anything like Miss
Sass, all this hare skin, this
resemblance to a sex flush on
everyone you meet, and the
phenomenon of spring level
makes you 111 N(«RY. Hungry
for pleasure, hungn for a juic \
treat.

Miss Sass suggests a picnic lo heal up a
spiing evening, li s ilic perfec I chance to try
out new edible sex lovs and potential aphro
disiacs.
First, Miss Sass suggests you find a partner
who won't mind if you slap mosquitoes off his
back during an intimate moment. I ruly. this
is a iiccessitv f< >r lovers preparing lo enjoy the
great outdoors. Next, you need a private
spot with a nice view — sunsets or oceans arc
ideal. You'll want to spread out .1 blanket lor

in controlled experiments, it seems likelv that

if you want il to. Krolic options allegedlv
