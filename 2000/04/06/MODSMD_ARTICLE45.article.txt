# 'Writers Harvest' bountiful

### DANIEL MOREAU 
No single theme ties this collection of short stories together,
except the unifying cause to curb hunger and malnutrition in
the United States, reminding us that such ailments do exist in
the land of the plenty.
The proceeds of "Writers Harvest 3," edited and introduced
by Stanford English Prof. Tobias Wolff, will go to the efforts of
combating hunger and malnutrition.
Wolff has chosen worthy authors, many who appear in his
"Vintage Book of Contemporary American Short Stories
(Andre Dubus, Ralph Lombreglia, Chris Offut, and the
omnipresent Joyce Carol Oates, to name a lew), as well as cur
rent writing fellows at Stanford such as Jason Brown, Jacob
Molyneux and Bridget Rohan Can ity.
One of the exciting things about this collection is the diversi
ty of forms with which these authors experiment. Andre
Dubus's story about our loss of faith "Corporal Lewis" is made
up almost entirely of dialogue between two officers discussing
the case of the title character who claims to hear the voice of
(iod. John Barth's " I he Extension," an extended metaphor for
the lives of the Baby-Boomers generation, reads like a dramat
ic monologue.
"20 Burgers" by Stewart O'Nan, dedicated to the recently
passed away Andre Dubus as well as a nod of recognition to his
story "The Fat Cirl," is divided into sections for each one of the
number of burgers the protagonist Kerry eats in a contest, so
that the basketball team she is travelling with can eat for free at
the Fat Man's diner.
Another note of originality is how close — and how faithful
— these stories are to the American experience as we know it
today. "Desire Lines" by Jacob Molyneux explores the new con
tinental shelf, as it were, of the American landscape — the
highway rest stop and its emergence as a meeting place for the
satiation of sexual desire.
One cannot fail to recognize one's parents in"The Extension"
by Barth, in which a middle-aged couple's question of whether
or not to add on to their country house becomes a metaphor
lor their changing life from parents to empty-nesters, from city
dwellers to country residents, from employment to retirement.
In Thomas Beller's "Caller 1.D." this gizmo irrevocably alters a
couple's relationship, after a mysterious gentleman calls the
girlfriend.
"Writers Harvest" showcases extremely talented writers —
some already distinguished late in their careers, others just
emerging but will hopefully become mainstays of American
Letters. Writers here feel as comfortable assuming the voice of
the opposite sex as their own, as demonstrated so expertly by
Beller, Can ity, Mary Gordon, Lombreglia and O'Nan, who all
write from"The Other's" perspective. In fact, a fearlessness to

experiment with a diver
sity of forms, voices and
milieus guarantees that
the reader will reap as
much in pleasure and
thoughtfulness as its
noble cause does in sup
port and awareness.
