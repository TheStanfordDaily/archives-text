# Surfing to fill your backpacks for less

Alili, it miisi be spring. I lit' scent <>l
Ireshly (til glass hovers in the bree/c,

legs are creeping out from under short
skirls, and ( lasses are even harder to
go to.
In lot timaielv, no matter what the
thei inoinetei s.ivs, we have things to
do and books to buy. I nsuallv just
drag my la/\ butt over to the book
store and brave the massive lines, bin
this spring, I decided to change up
the old routine and go online with
mv search lor text books.
As it often goes with online loravs,
though, I lound that online text
book siles are annoying, and their
overly-boasted (heap prices are
often not much fewer than the
pricey bookstore on campus.
Speaking of that bookstore, you
can actually visit it online at
www.stanford.bkstr.com. But whv
would I pay shipping costs on
books that I could get on my own
two feet? (>oud question, especialh
when the prices are the same.
1 lie bookstore has an interesting
little feature that makes the site
worthwhile, however. You can select
.ind pay for vour books from the com-

lon ol your own computer, and for no
extra cost they will find tliein and keep
them at the customer service window for
\ou to pick up. We all know how much shorter that line is
than the mammoth snake that winds its way through the
middle of the bookstore.
I his service seems to he nicely designed to distract atten
tion from the prices, though. So I continued my trek,
looking for the cheapest, easiest site for my hooks. I

whirled around www.efollet.com next, where I
searched lor my books by my school, and eventually ended
up on the bookstore site again. Even if you search their
database for books, all the prices are exactly the same as
those at our bookstore because they just reroute your
request to the campus bookstore. Useless, just useless.
At www.varsitybooks.com. the search-by-school option

does not automatically bounce you to the Stan
ford Bookstore. It just narrows the field for
searching, meaning less crap to wade through.
Yarsitybooks is a very professionally done
site. Their new textbooks are consistently five
dollars cheaper than those in White Plaza, but
with a $4.95 shipping charge, the savings are
quickly lost. Add in the hassle of creating a
user account and choosing your millionth pass
word and username, and suddenly it ain't
worth it.
www.textbooks.com has both new and used
books (which varsitybooks.com don't carry).
The amazing thing about their used books is
that they are more expensive, across the
board, than ours at the bookstore. New books
are cheaper (by a little more than five bucks),
but used books come without a significant
markdown. And then, of course, there is the
whole user account and shipping issue all over
again.
The best solution may be right here 011 cam
pus. su.market, a Stanford newsgroup on
pine, has a textbook section. On su.market,
once you brave the quantity and sort through
all the e-mails, you can buy your books cheap
ly and circumvent the Bookstore. Selection, of
course, is determined by who is selling what and
when, but check it out first. You may find a deal.
In order to get into su.market, access pine
through Telnet or Mac Samson. Then type "L"
for the folder list, and select "News." Once there,

type "A" for add, and type in "su.market." Sounds
too simple, right? But believe me, it can hook you up with
a good deal from another Stanford student.
hi any case, 1 wouldn't go with the online textbook
option. The advertised deals are usually not worth the
trouble. But check out su.market and you may be able
to save some lunch money from your textbook budget.
