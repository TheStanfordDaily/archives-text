# Engineers head overseas
## 
### AMY L. KOVAC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
(iiven that main of Stanibrd's overseas studies
programs have a liberal ,nis focus, engineering
students have often asked whether it is feasible fot
"techies" to lit overseas studies into then tight I\-
packed schedules.
junior Michael Mori, a materials science and
engineering student, said. "I didn't want to go
overseas because evervlhing I wanted in engineer
ing is here."

But advisers at the Overseas Resource ( enter,
the (herseas St tidies Program and the experiences
of a number of engineers suggest that not onh arc
engineers asking about stuclx ing overseas in largei
numbers, but that they find it possible as well.
Ie Ann Adam, coordinatoi of the ()\ei seas Re
source ('.enter, said, "I have bad .111 increasing
number of students ask about engineering pro
grams overseas. Main institutions are activelv ac -
< omodating these students."
The ORC provides informa
tion and advising to the Stanford
community regarding studying
abroad, working abroad and fel
lowship and travel opportunities
beyond the Stanford overseas
studies centers.
"The main problem for engi
neering students is time," Adam
said. "But, students who want to
go abroad can always find a way to

go abroad, and there are also good
short-term and summer pro
grams."
Trudi Keinhardt, academic
services coordinator for OSF, said,
"We definitely have tried to hold
outreach sessions to inform engi
neering students of the various
overseas studies options."
Yesterday, OSF looked directly
at this issue in a presentation
called "Overseas Opportunities
for Engineers," where speakers
presented with a variety of ways
that engineers might think oi try
ing to fit overseas studies into their
curricula.

This presentation included ad
vice from engineers who had gone
overseas about how to plan ahead
for courses and what opportuni
ties they found in their fields at the
centers they attended.
Participants also received infor
mation about how other require
ments, including GERs, can be
filled by courses at overseas cen
ters. For those engineers who find
language requirements to be a
barrier to studying overseas, there
are three programs that do not re
quire prior language instruction
— Berlin, Oxford and Moscow.
"Berlin and Kyoto have been

more engineer-friendly," Rein
liardt said, bui oilier programs
also include opportunities for in
ternships and tutorials that may
be of interest to engineering stu
dents.
"The majority of the courses
that we offer fall in the 'fuzzy' cat
egory, but 1 don't have the feeling
that tech-oriented students feel
tfiat we don't welcome them," she
added.
Senior Dan Francis, a mechani
cal engineering major, studied
overseas at the Stanford-in-Paris
center during Winter Quarter
1999.
"It was my favorite quarter at
.Stanford," Francis said.
Francis first began to think
about studying overseas in his
freshman year. During his sopho
more year, he started to look more
carefully at his schedule to see how
he could fit it into his study list. In
•order to get more information
about his options, Francis visited
his adviser.

"My adviser told me it was vir
tually impossible," Francis said.
But that did not prevent him
from exploring his options on his
own. He decided to take some
courses out of sequence in order
to make studying overseas work
into his schedule.
While overseas, Francis took
Engineering 50: "Introductory
Science of Materials," one of the
engineering courses on video that
is offered by the Paris program.
This course fulfilled one of his
elective requirements for mechan
ical engineering.
"We had a French teacher
working with us on the material in

French, which was cool," Francis
said.
Senior James Silva, a computer
science major, attended both the
Berlin and Kyoto programs. After
spending spring quarter of 1997
in Berlin, Silva stayed 011 to work
for IBM Germany in Stuttgart.
Silva spent the spring of 1999 in
Kyoto and then worked for asoft
ware company during the sum
mer of 1999.
"As an engineer 1 wanted to do
programs with internship compo
nents to gain some work experi
ence and a different perspective,"
Silva said.
"Most engineering students

think that studying overseas is for
'fuzzies' or that it is not relevant to
what they themselves are doing,"
Silva said. "A lot of them also do
not think that they have room to
incorporate it into their sched
ules."
Silva had plans both to do over
seas programs and graduate in
four years, but won a scholarship
allowing him an extra year as an
undergraduate. "I decided to give
myself a breather," he said.
" The Computer Science de
partment, at least, is encouraging
people to do it a little more than
they did in the past, which is a
good thing," he added.
