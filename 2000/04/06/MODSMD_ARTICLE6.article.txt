### PATRICK C. CROSETTO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The announcement last week that
American Studies house would be losing
its status as an academic theme dormito
ry took many students by surprise, espe

cially those currently residing there.
" 1 don't understand what's going on,"
commented sophomore house resident
Michele Clio. "They haven't told us any
thing."
Though students were unaware, all
academic theme houses were reviewed

over the past year, according i<> ( ommit
tee on Undergraduate Kducation (lhaii
Russell Fernald, a professor of psycholo
gy*
"The committee examined this tin a
year and made a report," Fernald said.
"We then talked about it a bit, and there

were students on it who were vigorous
partit ipatits in these dis< ussions.
" There had been a number of con
cerns that the theme houses weren't op
erating the way that they were intend
ed. Fernald added. "We never ever set
out to get rid of any thing. Academic

theme houses operate under guidelines
that are uudei our [committee's]
purview because the\ have an ac ademic
tone."
