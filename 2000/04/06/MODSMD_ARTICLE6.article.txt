# Am Stud house theme to end, students question decision
## 
### PATRICK C. CROSETTO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The announcement last week that
American Studies house would be losing
its status as an academic theme dormito
ry took many students by surprise, espe

cially those currently residing there.
" 1 don't understand what's going on,"
commented sophomore house resident
Michele Clio. "They haven't told us any
thing."
Though students were unaware, all
academic theme houses were reviewed

over the past year, according i<> ( ommit
tee on Undergraduate Kducation (lhaii
Russell Fernald, a professor of psycholo
gy*
"The committee examined this tin a
year and made a report," Fernald said.
"We then talked about it a bit, and there

were students on it who were vigorous
partit ipatits in these dis< ussions.
" There had been a number of con
cerns that the theme houses weren't op
erating the way that they were intend
ed. Fernald added. "We never ever set
out to get rid of any thing. Academic

theme houses operate under guidelines
that are uudei our [committee's]
purview because the\ have an ac ademic
tone."
The theme house guidelines
were set up in 1986 and outline
the academic objectives and pur
poses for each theme dormitory.
Fernald and his committee set up
a sub-committee on residential
education to examine the per
ceived lac k of academic rigor.
"All the departments except
American Studies wrote back to
us and said [the theme houses]
should have an academic compo
nent or they should not exist,"
Fernald said. "We put together
rules that will guide the theme
houses."
Fernald noted that the Ameri
can Studies house, which will re
vert to its original name of Mur
ray I louse next year, did not lit in
with the new guidelines set up by
the sub-committee.
"The American Studies house
had changed over the years;
there weren't many AmStud ma
jors living there," Fernald said.

"It looked more like a focus
house than a theme house."
Sophomore committee mem
ber Marisa Rolland agreed, say
ing, " The objection the commit
tee had to the AmStud house was
that it wasn't fulfilling the goals
that had been established for the
theme house program."
Theme houses have an acade
mic element; to live in Haus Mit
teleuropa this quarter, for exam
ple, students must attend house
seminars 011 elements of German
culture.
Focus houses seek to concen
trate people who are interested in
a particular subject, but do not
have mandatory events. Exam
ples include the public policy
focus of Castano and the environ
mental issues focus of Robinson.
Fernald was quick to note that
American Studies Resident Fel
low "Ray McDermott has done a
terrific job providing programs
supporting the students."
McDermott, who along with
co-Resident Fellow Shelley Gold
man, is in his last year as a resi
dent fellow, was unavailable for

comment.
Senior Aaron Nayfack, the res
ident assistant in American Stud
ies, said he believed that "it was
probably the right decision [be
cause] we haven't had very close
working relationship with the de
partment."
In fact, Nayfack noted, "We
only have one American Studies
major in the house currently."
As for concerns that current
residents were uninformed of the
decision, Nayfack admitted that
while the staff "knew there was a
review being done, and there
were several informal discus
sions, not a lot of the residents
know the decision has been
made."
Several students were taken
aback by the swiftness of the deci
sion and the rationale behind the
decision stating that all academic
theme houses should be focused
on languages and cultures.
"What kind of rationale is
that? That makes 110 sense," Cho
said. "1 don't understand why

The American Studies House is losing its theme affiliation and reverting to its old name of Murray House next year.
American Studies isn't a valid
theme within itself. .. . Why
isn't American Studies a part of
cultural studies?"
However, Fernald insisted, "It
seemed important to us that
under these rules American Stud
ies should be a focus house, not an
academic house . . . [but] every
one hopes that it becomes an
American Studies focus house."
Sophomore American Studies
resident lan Baker seemed indif
ferent to the change, saying, "I re
ally don't care about whether it
remains an academic theme
house or not. The thing is, how
many people are really American
Studies majors? It probably won't
make much of a difference."
