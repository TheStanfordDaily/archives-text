"There are movies that define every decade". "Body Shots" is one of these movies. It explores a few days in the lives of 8
young men and women living in Los Angeles. After a night of alcohol, sex and moral choices, things begin to go awry, and
their lives will never he the same. The aftermath of one night begins to take a toll on each and everyone in the group.
Values and self worth are challenged, friendships are threatened and these four young men and four young women look back
on what happened and struggle for the answers to very difficult questions.
The characters are based on stereotypical young adults who talk openly about how they feel regarding various issues which
affect their lives However, when one of them accuses another of rape, it forces many more difficult discussions about what
exactly happened that night These four women and four men are forced to remember what they did or what they ignored
and face the consequences of their actions.
While Body Shots deals with many of the important issues faced by today's young
adults, alcohol abuse and its consequences seem to be the most significant. It is
apparent that some of the characters have no recollection of their choices or actions
and some are dared to take sides and finally come clean with honest impressions of
their friends They are quick to judge others while trying to avoid being judged them
selves. They all search for the willingness to find the truth, face their deepest fears
and forgive one another
As Spring Break approaches, plans are being made to party non-stop for days.
Many students will cut loose, and many more will witness first-hand the wild behavior
of their peers. The yearly college ritual of drinking too much, partying too much and
wearing too little can produce a similar scenario as seen in "Body Shots".
While it is a rite of passage for many students to experience Spring Break, think
before you act and eat before you drink.
"Everything in moderation!"
