Frog Books, a venture sup
ported by the ASSU to chal
lenge the "monopoly ol the
Stanford Bookstore, may he
coming back next year.
The initiative offered text
hooks for major classes, su< h as
Kconomics I, at reduced prices
and guaranteed a buyhack <>l
50 percent of the hook's origi
nal price.
"Personally, I was surprised
at the amount of student sup

But the appearance of dot
torn book sellers was not the

their new venture.
I he Bookstore offers books
with 75 pen cni of the price of
new books, and Frog Books
used to offer them at a rate ol

subjects, all of which were big
classes," said Ku.
