## Project hopes to force Bookstore to improve 
### TOMOKO SAKAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Frog Books, a venture sup
ported by the ASSU to chal
lenge the "monopoly ol the
Stanford Bookstore, may he
coming back next year.
The initiative offered text
hooks for major classes, su< h as
Kconomics I, at reduced prices
and guaranteed a buyhack <>l
50 percent of the hook's origi
nal price.
"Personally, I was surprised
at the amount of student sup
port and requests for our con
tinued services through Frog
Books. We were a small group,
hut student voices arc strong in
expressing their need for a
market with more <oinpetitive
textbook prices," said Andy
Ku, one of the co-founders of
Frog Books.
"I think 112 rog Books was a
very good idea, and I'd like to
see it come back on service,"
said Mike Levin, president of
ASSU.
"Webrought it in on the first
week of fall quarter last year,
and it was a success. We gener
ated about $2,000 through th •

sales of books. Basically, it was a
response lo the total monopoly
of the Bookstore, which of
fered less competitive prices
with a bin bat k ol a meager
percent," Andy kn said.
With the sudden surge ol
online booksellers which ar
rived on campus last fall, Ku
and his partner, Fri< I Isu, saw
less need for providing less ex
pensive textbooks through
Frog Books.
"By winter quai tcr, we felt
iliat the vision of out venture
— to challenge the Bookstore's
monopoK — w as being ( all ied
on In the m\ i iad ol other on
line book sellers." said Ku.
" I "hat 's wh\ we temporarily
slopped our services through
Frog Books."
But the appearance of dot
torn book sellers was not the
onlv reason to pin a halt to
their new venture.
I he Bookstore offers books
with 75 pen cni of the price of
new books, and Frog Books
used to offer them at a rate ol
(>() to f>s pert cut. But our weak
point was that we could only
ollei textbooks for .'5O different
subjects, all of which were big
classes," said Ku.
Actoiding to 1 .evin, " I here
was certainly the fact of the Book
store's complete monopoly in
book buyback, although Frog
Books offered a much better
deal."
While ASSU did not give Frog
Books any financial support, they
did provide support and advice
in implementing the venture.
"Over the years, ASSU has
done a significant number of
things to end the monopoly of
the Bookstore. We have met
these challenges with mixed de
grees of success, although we're
currently working on a new at
tempt to create a Web site in
which students can sell and buy
textbooks off each other at more
desirable prices," added Levin.
Ross Davisson, technology
group director of ASSU / SSF
emphasized its appeal.
"We feel that the current cam
pus Web is weak, and students
can't get and exchange informa

lion as effectively. The new portal
we are developing will include
everything from a more accessi
ble school calendar [to] an updat
ed course guide to the latest party
on campus. We're using major
search engines so people can eas
ily put up books for sales and also
buy off others with their own
rates. This will definitely work to
challenge the Bookstore's mo
nopoly," he said.
Both Levin and Davisson ex
pressed an urgent need for com
petition with the current sales
and services of the Bookstore.
"I do hope that Frog Books
will come back," said Levin.
Ku agreed.
"Kven now, students are ask
ing us whether or not Frog Books
is coining back, because they
want inexpensive books,
"Therefore, we are currently
looking at the market and are
open to the possibility of starting
up Frog Books again if we feel
that the online book sellers are
not offering an adequate service
to students," he said.
