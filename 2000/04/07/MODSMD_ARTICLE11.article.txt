## Elian's father arrives in Washington D.C. 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” On
U.S. soil, Juan Miguel Gonzalez
said yesterday that he was "truly
impatient" to reclaim his son
Elian, but his hopes for an order
ly transfer of custody were
dimmed when government nego
tiations with the 6-year-old Cuban
boy's Miami relatives broke down.
1 he father declared his love
for son Elian and chastised those
who are trying "to obtain political
advantage" from the custody bat
tle over the shipwreck survivor.
He received immediate assur
ances that the U.S. government is
eager to reunite him with his son.
"It is simply the right thing to do,"
said Deputy Attorney General
Eric Holder. " The father and his
son need to be together."
But Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, the
attorney for the relatives with
whom Elian has been staying
since November, said the negotia
tions with the government were
over, primarily because the gov
ernment refused to promise that
they wouldn't "take Elian away in
the middle of the night." He also
said immigration officials refused
to agree to a psychological evalua
tion determining whether Elian
should be handed over to his
father.
A Justice Department official
stopped short of saying the talks
were over.
"We are disappointed that the
attorneys for the Miami relatives
insisted on relitigating the issue of
whether Elian should be returned
to his father as opposed to how to
carry that transfer out in the most
appropriate manner," said one
official, who spoke on condition of
anbrtyinitty."' -"i""-
The official said Justice lawyers
Were dvaftMg a letter to lawyers
for the Miami relatives "providing
additional guidance explaining
what future steps could be taken."
Gonzalez planned to meet
today at the Justice Department
with Attorney General Janet
Reno, Immigration and Natural

ization Service Commissioner
Doris Meissner and other officials.
In Miami, Elian seemed
unaware of the new phase in the
struggle over his future. He
played on a slide outside his
great-uncle's home and fired a toy
gun as the usual horde of
reporters and photographers
took note.
Relatives said he learned of his
father's trip only hours before it
took place.
It was an unsmiling Juan
Miguel Gonzalez who disem
barked from a small chartered
plane at Dulles International Air
port at dawn yesterday, accompa
nied by his wife, Nercy Carme
nate Castillo, and their infant son,
1 lianny. "This is Elian's true fam
ily and we love him very much,"
he said.
"It's been an agonizing experi
ence to see my son submitted to
cruel psychological pressures
aimed at influencing his personal
ity," Gonzalez said, speaking
through an interpreter. "Worse
still, Elian's been paraded and
exhibited in public rallies and by
the media with a clear intent to
obtain political advantage" from
the tragedy that befell him last
November, when his mother died
while en route with Elian to South
Florida from Cuba. Elian survived
the shipwreck.
"As if his mother's disappear
ance before bis eyes and the mira
cle of his arrival have not inflicted
enough damage on a 5-year-old
boy, he has had to spend time
under the temporary custody of
some distant relatives who had
never seen him before,"'lie said.
President Clinton, interviewed
on CBS, said, "The fact that the
father has come here, and will be
in a position to show his concern
for, and desire to be reunited with,
his son, should be a big help."
But the Miami relatives were
not swayed by Gonzalez's arrival
in the United States.
Eazaro Gonzalez, the great

mule who has cared lor Klian for
tlic past four months, "was almost
in tears" when he heard the
father's statement, said Armando
Gutierrez, a spokesman lor the
Miami relatives. "Hi* felt that that
is not his nephew. I le lclt that was
not the person he knows."
Juan Miguel (ion/ale/ spent
the day resting at the suburban
Washington home of Cuba's chief
diplomat in Washington, lie had
a late afternoon appointment with
his American lawyer, Gregorv
Craig, who flew to Cuba on Tues
day to help arrange the lather's
visit.
Several anti-Castro demonstra
tors spoke with reporters outside
tlie home after greeting the father

at the airport with placards saying
"Welcome to Freedom." Several
shouted the same slogan but Gon
zalez paid them no heed.
11 was quite a different scene in
Miami, where the number of
demonstrators around f.azaro
Gonzalez's house swelled to more
than 200 In midafternoon. "Let
the boy stay" was a frequent chant,
from a small radio, the Cuban
national anthem plaved.
Cuban-President Fidel Castro
was at the airport in I lavana to bid
farewell to the Gonzalez, family
when thev departed before dawn.
Gon/;ilt'z said Castro "has been
like a brother giving me advice
and support through our long
days of pain and uncertainty."
