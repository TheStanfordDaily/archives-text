# Firm advances study of genetics

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” A
private company mapping the
human genetic blueprint said
yesterday that it has completed
a major step: Decoding all of
the DNA pieces that make up
the genetic pattern of a single
human being.
The milestone puts the com
pany, Celera Genomics of
Rockville, Md., far ahead of an
international government
effort to map the human
genome using a different
method.
"We've now completed the
gene sequence plan of one
human being," said Craig Ven
ter, chief scientist for the com
pany. He said that human
being was an unidentified male,
adding, "By the end of next
week, we will have finished the
gene sequence for a female."
There are about 3 billion
DNA subunits in virtually every
human cell.
This DNA contains about
1 ()(),()()() genes. The gene
sequencing done thus far lines
up small segments of the DNA.
Assembly of the entire genome
will involve putting these seg
ments in proper order.
This process, said Venter,
will take several weeks. But he
said the Celera work is far
ahead of a similar effort by the
government-funded Human
Genome Project.
"We don't want to declare
absolute victory yet, but call me
in three or four weeks when it is
all assembled," said Venter.
Dr. Francis Collins, the
Human Genome Project's chief,
said, "I'm happy to hear that
Celera has completed this part of
their business plan.
We look forward to hearing
how the assembly process goes
and ultimately seeing the
sequence made available" to the
public.

Venter said the ordered
sequence of the human genes
will not be released to the pub
lic until it has been completely
assembled.
"I don't believe a genome is
done until there is an attempt
to identify the genes and the
linear sequence along all of the
chromosomes," he said. "We
will not have that completed
until later this year."
The announcement by Cel
era drew a quick response from
Wall Street investors. Shares of
PE Corp., Celera's parent com
pany, rose 26 7/8 points to 139
7/8 by midafternoon.
President Clinton's press
secretary, Joe Lockhart, said
the Celera announcement
"marks a . . . significant point
in what the president has
talked about extensively as
. . . one of the most important
scientific developments of our
time."
The Human Genome Pro
ject is expected to complete a
"rough draft" of the human
gene sequence this spring, but
this will not be assembled into a
finished order for several more
years.
The federal project is using a
different method than that
used by Celera, which is using a
technique developed by Ven
ter.
But, in contrast to Celera,
the federal project is releasing
to the public the genetic
sequences as they are identi
fied.
The federal project thus far
as put on the Internet the codes
for about 2.3 billion subunits of
the DNA.
Clinton recently announced
that the United States and
Britain have agreed to share
data from their efforts to
decode the human genetic
pattern.
