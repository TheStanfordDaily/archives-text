# Government predicts gas prices will be as low as $1.46 a gallon

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Gasoline prices
should peak this month and decline to an average
of $1.46 a gallon for the summer, the government
said yesterday, revising dramatically its previous
expectations of soaring fuel prices going into the
vacation season.
While the forecast dampened the prospect of
$2 per gallon of regular grade gasoline even in
high-price areas, as once feared, motorists still will
be paying about 25 percent more for gasoline this
summer than last year, the forecast said.
It said the average family, traveling 12,000
miles from April through September, is likely to
pay $170 more for fuel this year than last vacation
season.
The Energy Department said yesterday its
revised forecast, taking into account the addition
al oil production announced by world producers
last month, shows the average price nationwide
peaking at $1.52 a gallon this month and then
declining.
Gasoline prices already have dropped a bit in
some places. The forecast estimates prices averag
ing $1.39 a gallon after Labor Day. Still, officials
warned that the estimates are national averages
and in some areas prices are likely to be higher.
Average gasoline prices in California in March,
for example, have been 2b cents a gallon higher
than the national average, with the disparity
expected to continue into the summer, the report
said.
The latest analysis by the Energy Information
Administration was in sharp contrast to its forecast
a month ago when the agency said that even with
increased oil production, gasoline prices were
expected to soar to a national average of $1.80 a
gallon. That prompted widespread fear of $2 per
gallon gas just when millions of Americans hit the
road for summer vacations.
The turn of events was welcomed by motorists.
"Isn't that thrilling," said Sandy Cohen, 51, of

Virginia, when told of the latest price predictions
as he browsed through maps ;it the American
Automobile Association office near the White
House. Cohen said he planned a 500-mile sum
mer trip iu the family ininivan that "gets horrible
mileage" and every penny saved at the pumps
helps.
But Joe McNearney, 21, a congressional intern
from Minnesota, said he viewed the forecast with
skepticism. "I'm going to wait and see if the prices
really go down," he said.
()n Capitol 1 lill, meanwhile, the enthusiasm for
giving motorists relief from high gasoline prices
seemed to lose momentum. I he Senate approved
by a 66-34 vote a nonbinding resolution opposing
a federal gas tax rollback of 4.3 rents per gallon.
Rollback critics said it would give little help to con
sumers while depriving the government of billions
of dollars needed for road projects.
I'he EIA forecast assumed that additional oil
would begin hitting the I'.S. market I>\ Ma\ and
June as a result of a decision March 28 In the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
to boost production by 1.7 million barrels ;i day.
Other non-OPEC producers also would pump
more oil.
Venezuela's oil minister, Ali Rodriquez, indicat
ed this week that another production increase may
be planned when the OPEC oil minister meet
again in late June.
The EIA report predic ted that crude oil prices
will continue to drop for the remainder of the year
and into 2001. The spot price for light sweet crude
was $25.68 per barrel yesterday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Earlier this year, oil reached
a high of $34 per barrel.
Government and private economists said the
revised gasoline outlook stems 112 rom crude oil and
gasoline stocks not declining as rapidly as had
been anticipated and additional oil moving into
the U.S. market quicker than expected.
