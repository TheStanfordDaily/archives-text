COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) —
With the (Confederate flag flutter
ing fiotn the dome, hundreds of
demonstrators demanding its
removal converged on the State
house yesterday after a five-day,
120-mile march from Charleston.
"We must, as South Carolini
ans, move forward and get this
issue resolved, and we must move
the flag from the dome," Co v.
Jim I lodges told a crowd of 2,000
people.
On the Capitol's opposite side,
flag supporters, who see the ban
ner as a symbol of Southern her
itage that honors Confederate
war dead, sang "Dixie" and
demanded that it stay.
Led by Charleston Mayor
Joseph P. Riley Jr. and under
heavy security. Hag opponents —
who see the banner as a vestige of
hatred and slavery — began their
march Sunday with about (500
people. The group fell to just a
few during the week, but swelled
to more than 400 yesterday
morning.
Hundreds more met the
marchers at the Statehouse.
Riley told the crowd that an
anonymous letter writer threat
ened that if he marched with
blacks through Calhoun County
south of Columbia, "1 will put
you in my gun sights."
That was not about heritage,
Riley said: "That is his hate."
Hodges, a Democrat who pro
poses moving the flag to a monu
ment on Statehouse grounds,
said he is tired of hearing legisla
tors argue.
The Senate has now set debate
on a bill for Wednesday.
