## The 						Stanford Daily Outlining special fee endorsement policy 
### 
Published Since J891

Voters in ASSU elections are not over
whelmed with information to aid
them in their polling-place decisions.
Aside from the Elections Handbook
and the occasional presidential debate, few
forums exist for campaign discourse, and the
entire electoral process is thus dangerously
dose to falling into a popularity contest based
on catchy slogans and well-placed posters.
The Daily tries to help tlie process by print
ing, in its news pages, profiles of presidential
candidates and a pre-election round-up of sen
ate candidates, special fee seekers, proposed
constitutional amendments and ( lass presiden
tial slates. That coverage aims to present major
election issues in a concise format.
There is another side to The Daily's election
service to the Stanford community, one that is

entirely separate from the news pages and that
annually creates as much controversy as any
thing we print.
This weekend, the paper's editorial board —
consisting of the editor in chief, the managing
editor for special sections, the opinions editors,
two stall 'members at large and two community
members — will meet with candidates for
ASSU president and the majority of the groups
seeking special fees (those who choose to meet
with us).
The board will listen to a presentation from
each slate or group and ask questions. After
over eight hours of meetings over three days —
and countless more scrutinizing several hun
dred pages of candidate statements and group
budget proposals — the board will vote to
endorse a presidential slate and rank each spe

cial fee group on a five-point scale.
Endorsements, which will run the Tuesday
and Wednesday before the elections, which are
on April 19 and 20, will not represent snap
decisions based on candidates' smiles or fee
groups' posters. They will be well-researched,
thoughtfully considered and thoroughly debat
ed.
They will also be extremely important. An
ASSU election, by nature, comes at a time
when course work begins to pick up and activ
ities kick into full swing. Stanford students are,
for the most part, too busy to personally scruti
nize every fee request or candidate resume.
By printing its endorsements — and more
importantly, the rationale behind them — the
editorial board is able to share the fruits of its
long research process with a community that

often does not have the time to undertake a
similar task.
We choose to endorse not because we believe
we make better decisions than anyone else on
the Stanford campus, but because we believe it
is necessary for a newspaper in a democracy to
educate itself and its readers as fully as possible
on electoral issues.
By publishing our endorsement criteria and
the reasoning behind our decisions, we offer a
guideline for voting, a reference frame in
which students can root their decisions.
Voting is ultimately a personal choice, and
we do not pretend to be dictating what the
best choice is for every voter. But by offering
our well-researched opinions and showing
how we arrived at them, we believe that we
help the system.
