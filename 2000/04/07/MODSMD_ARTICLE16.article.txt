# THE
						FLIP SIDE
## Rushing to judgment 
### 
There is ;i legend on this cam
pus. Years ago, before we even
dreamed of Stanford (and
before our parents even
dreamed <>1 us), iv\ (limbed the walls of
Hoover lower and the bars on the
observation platform openings did not
extend to the ceiling like they do now.
And in our lolty symbol ol both conser
vatism and arousal, <i tragedy supposed
ly took place. Legend has it that a girl
climbed over the poorly-designed safety

guard and jumped
280 feet to her death.
I lie story of the girl
who |umped oil
Hoover lower has
become Stanford's
own urban legend.
Lnfbrtunately, I can't
tell you i! the story is
true. What interests

me more is I lit* social
context. What could possibly liavt* caused
111 is i ragedv? W ell, the storied answer is
Rush. I'he girl, a Stanford student, sup
posedly didn't gel into a sorority and
therelbre decided to jump, an accent to
an already tragic tale.
I his legend has painted a very nega
tive pit lure ol Rush and sororities in gen
eral. Sorority Rush is by lar one of the
most positive, affirming and non-judg
mental events on the Stanford campus.
Km in light of I lie legend and the recent -
l\ concluded Sorority Rush, I've talked
to a number of women about both in and
out of sororitcs in regards to what Rush
is RKAI.LY like 011 this campus.
I'o start it .ill off , all the "rushees" get
dressed up and go 112 rom sorority to soror
it\ meeting as many people as possible.
I he\ are happy. I hey are perky. I hey
have permanent smiles. I hey have per
fect clothes. In fact, they have forgotten
who thev are completely. I hey are rush
ing.
I pon reaching each sorority event,
the sororit\ sisters go around and "gel to
know" each of die rushees through 5
minute "getting lo know you" conversa
tions. I lere's how the "getting to know" a
rushee might work.
Franny Frosh: "Mi. I'm Franny!" 1
can't believe my parents named me
Franny. It's okay. I'm going to get past
I Ins. I feel pretty and confident, pretty
and confident ....
Sally Sorority: "Ili Franny. I'm Sally."
Her name's Franny? She is definitely a
virgin. "So where are you from Franny?"
Wow, her nose is big.
Franny Frosh: "Well, I'm from Wis
consin." Oh god, did 1 just say Wiscon
sin. California, stupid. The answer's Cal

ifbrnia
Sally Sorority: "That's awesome."
Another winner. Let's see. She's from
Wisconsin. That means she probably has
.1 boyfriend bark at home who she hasn't
talked to in six months but who she loves
very much. She probably talks to her
parents and goes running twice a day.
She probably wants to be a Poli Sci
major. And she's probably really into
community service. "So what do you do
on campus?"
Franny Frosh: "Oh you know, I spend
a lot ol time thinking about my boyfriend
who goes to Wisconsin. 1 go running and
talk to my parents every day. I'm think
ing of declaring I'oli Sci. And besides
that, 1 do a lot of stuff with the I laas Cen
ter, and I love hanging out with my
friends." Is that it? Let's see, academics,
athletics, boyfriend, benevolence. Wait,
who am I ?
Sally Sorority: "That's just great."
Bingo. Wow. Her nose is distracting.
Franny Frosh: "Oh yeah, and I love
going to fiat parties." Almost forgot.
Sally Sorority: "Really, which one is
your favorite?" This'll be good.
Franny Frosh: "Well, 1 really love SAF
parties." Perfect.
Sally Sorority: "Yeah, they're way
cool." Slut. "Well Franny, it was really
nice to meet you." You'd probably make
a great DC, if they still existed.
Franny Frosh: "It was really nice to
meet you too. 1 feel like 1 already know
you so well. You're so sweet and nice and
pretty." Did 1 really just say all that? Ob
my god, she probably thinks I'm a les
bian!
Sally Sorority:
"Yeah ... uinmm ... you too." Oh my
gocl, she's a lesbian. "Have fun at Rush.
I oodles." You have managed to make
me proud of my nose.
l he opening conversation is one way
in which the girls really connect and get
to know each other on a deeper level.
I'poll passing the initial conversation, the
rushees can move onto the next stage of
Rush, usually the weighing and the mea
suring. Sorority Rush raises the standard
by getting women to look their best. Any
good rushee knows not to eat anything
the week before Rush in preparation for
the Rush "scales." First impressions are
critical at Rush, and you're kidding your
self if you think looks don't play a role.
Feeling the effects of the freshman fif
teen? It better be negative fifteen by the
time Rush rolls around. Only running
once a day? It's time to hit Fressider Fit
ness in your spare time at 1 a.m. That's
