Racism at Stanford
I am writing in response to Om
Ruudifs column "A Letter to Our Presi
dent — From the Prison of Hope." 1. too,
am incredibly upset that racist slurs make
their way onto our campus and into the
mailboxes of my fellow students. I, too,
think that more should be done in order to
increase awareness about race and ethnici
ty issues.
However, I must disagree with Om's
outright condemnation of what he finds to
be a lac k of diversity in the Stanford c ur
riculum and the student body. As an inter
national student who has attended univer
sities in three countries, 1 must say that
Stanford is by far the institution where 1
have learned the most about other cul
tures.
While here, I have been able to take
classes on Japanese Society and Culture,
on East-West approaches to human moti
vation, and yes, a c lass called "Multicultur
alism." Stanford is the only place where I
have been able to simultaneously meet and
befriend people from Pakistan and India,
Russia and Latvia, Romania and 1 hingary,
Ghana and South Africa, as well as Ameri
cans corning from many different environ
ments.
As for professors, my academic advisor's

ethnic heritage is, indeed, very different
from my own. However, I have found to
have more in common with her than with
many professors from my own back
ground.
This, however, con Id not have been pos
sible without an open mind, both on my
part and on the part of others. Om must
surely know what 1 am talking about, since
he is "the first" international student I met
when we both arrived at Stanford as fresh
men. We have been friends since, and it
was his amicable demeanour and unpreju
diced attitude that made this possible.
I must admit, though, that all too often
1 have seen students on campus being dis
missive or defiant of others because they
did not seem to be "like them." I want to
challenge that attitude by saying that
before more ethnic studies programs are
conceived, before more race conferences
are organized and before more minority
professors are hired (though all these
things need to happen as well) each one of
us needs to take responsibility for reaching
out to others.
Eastern Europe, where 1 come from,
has seen much ethnic conflict. One of the
reasons for the infliction of harm upon fel
low humans has been too much emphasis
on the wrongs done by one ethnic group
to another. Had the Serbs been able to

treat Albanians as individuals, instead of as
members of a monolithic, homogenous
group, where the many were blamed for
the actions of a few, Kosovo might not look
the way it does today. In our approach to
race and ethnicity at Stanford, let us try to
think in terms of I and you, not us and
them.

While I share Mr. kundu's concerns
about racism and admire his eloquent and
well-written plea for racial justice, I find
myself alarmed at some of the institutions
which he singles out for criticism.
1 could not agree more that the it is "an
issue of basic intellectual and social respect
to be treated on equal footing by fellow stu
dents, faculty, scholars and workers," —
after all, the basic equality of human digni
ty is a hallowed idea for liberal civilization
with roots stretching back over thousands
of years to the Greeks and the Hebrews.
However, several of Mr. Kundu's com
plaints reflect seemingly problematic atti
tudes about those institutions which foster
and protect that liberal equality: namely,
freedom of speech and academic freedom
from institutional and political pressures.
Mr. Kundu speaks of those who have
been verbally attacked while "the perpe
trators have been defended by the rhetoric
of freedom of expression and the First
Amendment." 1 would hope that the per
petrators were defended also by the sub
stance of the First Amendment, as its pro
tections for freedom of speech undergird
ihe legal recognition of the equal human
dignity he espouses.
While such verbal attacks may be
extremely painful and even emotionally
damaging to those involved, so long as
they fall within the canon of protected
speech they are the price of living within a
free society.
Furthermore, one of the well-recog
nized goals of an academic institution such
as Stanford is to pursue the truth in a man
ner unbiased by political or ideological
opinions. Ideas and disciplines should
stand or fall on their merits, not 011 their
level of political support. 1 hope that ethnic
studies exist because they are recognized
by the academic community as innovative
and rigorous work, not because there have
been "demonstrations, sit-ins, candle-light
vigils and finally, hunger strikes to gain
attention" for them.
And if they are not, then I hope no
amount of ideologically motivated struggle
will save them.
In short, Mr. Kundu should not forget
that many of the obstacles he wishes to
destroy, including bureaucratic delay,

budget constraints, egg-clonor adds and
even prejudice, are the price of a liberal
society and that abolishing them would
require weakening those very institutions
on which his goals rest.

Appreciating Stanford's employees
In the article by Vivek Srinivasan 011 the
Justice foi janitor's rally (April 5 "Students
rally for janitors"), I am quoted as encour
aging students to "Introduce yourself to
the janitor at your house. Find out what
their lives are really like."
I did use these words in my speech dur
ing this rally, however, I feel it is necessary
to clarify for those readers who did not
hear me in person what the main message
of the speech was , which was somewhat
lost in this quotation.
I actually urged students to "Introduce
yourself to janitors you pass by, thank
them for the work the) do for you and find
out what their lives are really like." I am
not accusing Mr. Srinivasan of intentional
ly omitting my request to thank the jani
tors for the work that they do, and it may
seem like an insignificant mistake.
1 feel it is important to point out this
omission, though, for the message of my
speech is that we as students owe some
thing to the janitors for the work they do
and thanking them personally is the least
that one can do.
It is essential for students to realize the
interdependence between all members of
the Stanford community who are not, as
Professor Carson pointed out, simply the
students and faculty.
I bis theme of the rally and my speech

is overlooked in the factual article written
by Mr. Srinivasan and in my eyes, it is one
of the most important to be taken away
from the event. We need to realize that we
live, work and study in a community that
includes many people who are struggling
to survive. It is time we begin acting like a
community.

Stanford needs more communities, not
houses
When we return to school next fall, yet
another house on campus will have closed
its door to, well, just about everybody at
Stanford University. Yes, its true, Whit
man has gone to the Pi Phis.
The closing of the doors is not the Pi
Phis fault; it is the Office of Residential
Education's fault for awarding the house
to the Pi Phis. What I find truly alarming
about the surrender of general campus
housing to special organizations, is not the
overwhelming power of Res Ed to subvert
the student voice in said issues, but the lack
of student voice.
In trying to save Whitman, what were
we trying to save? The article in Thurs
day's Daily ("Pi Phi gets Whitman"), while
commendable for presenting views that
criticize Res Ed and employing quotes that
call attention to Res Ed's lac k of serious
thought on the issue such as, "I am going
for overall student representation," fails in
explaining to general members of our
community what, if anything, was worth
saving about Whitman.
As a student who lives off campus, 1
have adopted several houses on campus as
surrogate homes. One overwhelming

observation 1 have made is that very few
houses on campus have any truly pro
found sense of identity.
I eat lunch in l-ambda Nu, one of the
most desirable houses on campus, yet well
into winter quarter, some students living
there didn't even know that 1 wasn't a
member of the house. While this confusion
could be attributed to my spending lots of
time at this house, it also reflects a more
general, upsetting trend about why people
draw into houses, as well as how they
spend their time there.
Location has replaced personality as the
most important criteria in housing deci
sion. With a lot of students, and, frankly,
not a lot of desirable housing, the nice
houses go first. At the risk of making an
oversimplification of the subject, the hous
es that go first, compromise personality
and become merely a random juxtaposi
tion of lucky students. The Draw inherent
ly perpetuates this type of decision making
for students choosing where to live. Hav
ing said this about the Draw, what hap
pens after housing has been assigned?
Whether or not we get a good Draw
number is something totally out of our
control. What we do with the housing we
are assigned is completely within our
realm. I cannot help but be critical of stu
dents who choose to turn their residence
into nothing more than a place to eat,
sleep and study.
But this is only part of the problem.
There is a general apathy towards cultivat
ing any type of philosophical justification
for what a house on campus represents,
values and strives for, both for its residents
and the campus as a whole.
When Res Ed tries to take away anoth
er beautiful campus house, the only way, if
any, to stop them from doing it is to show

that the house has merits that go beyond
its location and its two-room doubles. The
time for action is not after Res Ed has
made an upsetting decision in the name of
"overall student representation" but ever)'
day, in every house and with every pro
gram. Raising our voices in response to
such a decision comes across as unjustified
outrage when all along the power has been
in our hands.
In " Ihe Big Lebowski," John Good
man's character remarks, "Say what you
will about the tenets of national socialism,
at least its an ethos!" Say what you will
about the Pi Phis, at least they have a
group identity. I challenge them to view
Whitman as more than just a house, to
make it, at the risk of sounding like a sen
timental fool, a home. I challenge the rest
of us to create something intangible in all
of our residences so that Res Ed cannot
justify taking them away.
