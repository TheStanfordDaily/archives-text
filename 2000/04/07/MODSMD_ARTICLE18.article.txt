Racism at Stanford
I am writing in response to Om
Ruudifs column "A Letter to Our Presi
dent — From the Prison of Hope." 1. too,
am incredibly upset that racist slurs make
their way onto our campus and into the
mailboxes of my fellow students. I, too,
think that more should be done in order to
increase awareness about race and ethnici
ty issues.
However, I must disagree with Om's
outright condemnation of what he finds to
be a lac k of diversity in the Stanford c ur
riculum and the student body. As an inter
national student who has attended univer
sities in three countries, 1 must say that
Stanford is by far the institution where 1
have learned the most about other cul
tures.
While here, I have been able to take
classes on Japanese Society and Culture,
on East-West approaches to human moti
vation, and yes, a c lass called "Multicultur
alism." Stanford is the only place where I
have been able to simultaneously meet and
befriend people from Pakistan and India,
Russia and Latvia, Romania and 1 hingary,
Ghana and South Africa, as well as Ameri
cans corning from many different environ
ments.
As for professors, my academic advisor's

ethnic heritage is, indeed, very different
from my own. However, I have found to
have more in common with her than with
many professors from my own back
ground.
This, however, con Id not have been pos
sible without an open mind, both on my
part and on the part of others. Om must
surely know what 1 am talking about, since
he is "the first" international student I met
when we both arrived at Stanford as fresh
men. We have been friends since, and it
was his amicable demeanour and unpreju
diced attitude that made this possible.
I must admit, though, that all too often
1 have seen students on campus being dis
missive or defiant of others because they
did not seem to be "like them." I want to
challenge that attitude by saying that
before more ethnic studies programs are
conceived, before more race conferences
are organized and before more minority
professors are hired (though all these
things need to happen as well) each one of
us needs to take responsibility for reaching
out to others.
Eastern Europe, where 1 come from,
has seen much ethnic conflict. One of the
reasons for the infliction of harm upon fel
low humans has been too much emphasis
on the wrongs done by one ethnic group
to another. Had the Serbs been able to

treat Albanians as individuals, instead of as
members of a monolithic, homogenous
group, where the many were blamed for
the actions of a few, Kosovo might not look
the way it does today. In our approach to
race and ethnicity at Stanford, let us try to
think in terms of I and you, not us and
them.

Senior, International Relations

While I share Mr. kundu's concerns
about racism and admire his eloquent and
well-written plea for racial justice, I find
myself alarmed at some of the institutions
which he singles out for criticism.
1 could not agree more that the it is "an
issue of basic intellectual and social respect
to be treated on equal footing by fellow stu
dents, faculty, scholars and workers," —
after all, the basic equality of human digni
ty is a hallowed idea for liberal civilization
with roots stretching back over thousands
of years to the Greeks and the Hebrews.
However, several of Mr. Kundu's com
plaints reflect seemingly problematic atti
tudes about those institutions which foster
