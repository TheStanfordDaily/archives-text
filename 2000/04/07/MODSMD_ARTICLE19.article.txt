# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Founders' Day celebration to kick off this weekend 
### MARC WAIS DEAN OF STUDENTS 
I his Sunday is a special day on the
Stanford Campus, continuing a tradition
that was started in 1891. It's the singular
day of the year in which the entire Stan
lord community has the opportunity to
come together as one to commemorate
the founding ol Stanford University and
to honor Jane and Leland Stanford.
In 1891, Senator Stanford established
Founders' Day (then referred to as
"Memorial Day") in honor of Leland, Jr.'s
birthday. After Senator Stanford's death,
the focus of the celebration shifted to
honor Senator and Mrs. Stanford. While
the content and date of Founders' Day cel
ebrations have changed over the years,
some things remain constant: notably the

spirit, time to reflect,
and sense of communi
ty generated on this
day for participants and
spectators.
This year's
Founders' Day Celebra
tion has something for
everyone. From 10 a.m.
to 12 p.m., the Mau-

soleum will be open to the public. This is
the only day of the year that you can see
the interior of the Mausoleum, which
serves as the final resting place of the Stan
ford family. At 11 a.m., the formal
Founders' Day program begins with a
brief ceremony in front of the Mau
soleum, including the laying of a wreath
and a performance by Talisman, the 1997
National College A Cappella Champions.

After the Mausoleum ceremony, a
procession of students, faculty, adminis
trators, members of the Board of
Trustees, Historical Society members
and the Stanford family's original horse
drawn carriage will process to Memorial
Church on Palm Drive. The Memorial
Church Ceremony w ill begin promptly at
11:45 a.m., featuring speeches by Presi
dent Casper, junior Nick Beckman and
first year Medical School student Shan
non Moffett.
Nick and Shannon were selected by a
student committee from a very competitive
field of students who participated in a
Founders' Day student speech competi
tion.
Founders' Day will conclude with a
Quad Celebration beginning at 12:45
p.m., featuring an old-fashion family pic

nic. All of these events are free and open
to the public.Students especially should
take advantage of this day to learn more
about the founding of the University from
which they will graduate and the people
whose name the University bears.
1 know I have learned a great deal
about Stanford because of my involve
ment with Founders' Day. For instance, I
was interested to find out in reviewing the
student speeches the reason why the Uni
versity's roof tiles are red: Jane Stanford
knew that Leland Jr. was up in heaven
looking down and, therefore, would be
able to locate his University easily because
of its distinctive red roofs.
Founders' Day will also provide stu
dents the opportunity to meet and min
gle with faculty, staff, trustees and alum
ni throughout the day. The University

feels so strongly about the importance of
Founders' Day that it now schedules its
Board of Trustees meeting the day after
Founders' Day to facilitate Trustee
involvement.
It's the type of day that should almost
be a rite of passage for all Stanford stu
dents at least once during their time on
the Farm. Stanford University is a special
place made up of blight, wonderful,
diverse and engaging people. Its history is
rich, interesting, funny and inspiring. All
of us associated with Stanford know how
fortunate we are to be a part of this special
place and its history. Founders' Day allows
us to unabashedly show our affinity for
Stanford, learn more about Stanford and
celebrate being part of Stanford.
I will see you at the Mausoleum this
Sunday!
