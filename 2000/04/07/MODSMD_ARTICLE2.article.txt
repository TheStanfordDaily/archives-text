# Frosh car plan unveiled
## Stanford's growth makes restrictions necessary; new services may soften blow CARS 
### FRANK POLLOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As of next fall, freshmen will no
longer be allowed to purchase the
parking permits necessary to keep a
car on campus.
The Offices of Parking and Trans
portation Services and Student Affairs
made this policy change official yester
day at a press conference in Tresidder
Union. The policy has been under
constant revision and renegotiation
for the past 18 months.
As stated in the official press re
lease, "In order to be able to build the
housing and new academic facilities
needed to allow Stanford to continue
to thrive as a world class institution,
for the first time the University must
impose parking restrictions."
Stanford's growth is limited by re

strictions posed in the General Use
Permit it holds with Santa Clara
County. It regulates rates at which
building square footage, parking
space and traffic can increase.
The General Use Permit stipulates
that the construction of new resi
dences, necessary to ease the current
housing crunch, cannot be accompa
nied by an increase in traffic in and
out of campus.
Banning freshman cars was one
way to mitigate the increased traffic
inevitabily associated with a large in
crease in on-campus housing..
"The hope is that freshmen will be
so wrapped up in the on-campus Stan
ford experience that they won't notice
the difference as much," said Univer
sity Manager of Facilities Operations
Chris Christofferson.
In a typical year, 35 percent of
freshmen filing cars to Stanford in
September. By June, that figure is
usually up to 50 percent.
"This says that freshmen are realiz
ing that they need cars," commented
Christofferson.

"I'm not sure what I would have
done this year without my car or my
friends' cars," 112 reshman Tyler Beset k
er said. "I think I would have been
pretty bored on the weekends. 1 guess
I might be in better shape though."
"New programs are being put in
place, many of which will be seen in
pilot form this spring," said Troy
Gilbert, assistant to the Vice Provost
for Student Affairs. "About half of
these programs will increase the qual
ity of life for the entire campus, not
just freshmen," he said.
Five such programs were outlined
in the press release. An on-campuscar
rental service will be instituted and
run out of the Stanford Bookstore.
Any student over 18 with a driver's li
cense will be eligible to rent a car. Con
tract negotiations are currently un
derway with several rental agencies,
and the program can be expected to
begin operation on a trial basis this
spring.
