# Palo Alto mulls over proposed cancer center
## 
### VALENTINE DING CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A proposal for a new Stanford cancer cen
ter is entering Palo Alto's approval process.
The proposal is one of the many land-use
issues being hotly debated between the Uni
versity and surrounding counties.
The proposed Outer for Cancer Treat
ment and Prevention and Ambulatory Care
Pavilion would be located adjacent to the
Stanford Hospital on Pasteur Drive and con
nected to the Lucile Packard Children's Hos
pital via an underground passageway.
The center, first conceived in 1998, is sup
posed to facilitate the treatment of cancer with
"combined modality teams," made up of spe
cialists working closely together 011 a patient's
case. The new center would free up a sub
stantial amount of space at the hospital.
Palo Alto, fearful of the potential distur
bance the new center might bring to the sur
rounding community, refused to start evaluat
ing the case until an environmental impact
report was made and attached to the proposal.

The report was finally prepared last
month. The cancer center project will be dis
cussed by the (itv's Architectural Review
Board on April 20.
The Palo Alto Planning Commission is
then expected to meet on May 3. In June, the
City Council will consider the issue and pos
sibly craft a resolution.
"The cancer center is desperately needed,"
said Larry Morton, Stanford's director of gov
ernment and community relations. "I fully
expect Palo Alto to approve the proposal
because it will serve the citizens of Palo Alto as
well as others in the area."
The environmental impact report,
authored by the consulting firm KIP Associ
ates of San Francisco, found that the pro
posed cancer center would create more than
500 jobs and a need for 311 homes. The
218,000 square foot building would be four
stories high and have a four-level under
ground parking garage.
According to The Palo Alto Daily News, the
report also indicated that the project would
"create significant delays at K1 Camino Real

and Embarcadero Road, Arboretum Road and
Palm Drive, El Camino Real and Ravenswood
Avenue and many other intersections."
Morton said that Stanford is attempting to
mitigate traffic problems with the Sand Hill
Road Extension and Widening Project. Pro
posed in 1997, it involves extending Sand Hill
Road to El Camino Real and widening the
road from two to four lanes from Santa Cruz
Avenue to the San Francisquito Creek Bridge.
The portion of the road between Santa
Cruz Avenue and the bridge is under the
jurisdiction of Menlo Park. Stanford has
ottered to fund the road-widening project,
but Menlo Park opposes it entirely.
Presently "nothing's happening in terms of
negotiations between the University and city,"
reported the Palo Alto Weekly.
In the meantime, Stanford's otter to pay
the cost of road construction will expire in
seven years.
"Provision is already made to widen Sand
Hill Road in Menlo Park and the citizens [of
Menlo Park] all support it," said Horton. "We
believe widening should take place."
