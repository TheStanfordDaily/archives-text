# Greed, the game show, hits Stanford
## Students compete to be contestant in Palo Alto today 
### AMY CHRISTESON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford students will begin
vying for a chance to be on the
hit Fox game show "Greed" at
the Blue Chalk Cafe today.
To win the trip to 1 lolly wood,
students must pass a trivia qui/
and then beat a member of the
show's staff in a one-on-one com
petition. There, they will repre
sent Stanford as they compete as
members of the PAC-10 team on
the show's special episode, "Col
lege Greed."
Up to four Stanford students
may be selected, and a number
of potential contestants are eager
to try their luck at the $2 million
jackp< >t.
Freshman Brandon Reavis
said he is thinking about audi
tioning for the show. Residents
of his dorm are pushing him to
do so because they say he is "the
trivia king."
Not all students, however, are
keen for the opportunity.
"I would never want to be in a
game show," said Caroline Oko
rie, a freshman. "1 would pee in
my pants."

Chuck Woolery, the host of
"Greed," describes the show as
"the most dangerous game show
is America." Contestants com
pete in teams of five, but ulti
mately have a chance to turn on
each other and eliminate team
mates and other contestants.
The show begins with six peo
ple who are asked an initial qual
ifying question, the answer to
which is a whole number. The
person whose answer is furthest
from the correct number is elim
inated.
The remaining contestants
are asked a series of multiple
choice questions. Successive
correct answers are worth an
increasing amount of money.
At any point during the game,
the team can decide to continue
playing or stop and collect the
jackpot they have already won.
The $2 million sound tempt
ing to many students, especially
given the extra books and sup
plies most students need to buy
at the beginning of the quarter.
"I would save it," freshman
Nanna Jaycox said, regarding
the money.
Jessie Can, another fresh
man, disagreed.
"No, 1 would invest it."
Bill Ridgeway says that if he
won the $2 million, he'd invest it,
"but probably end up losing it all
on F-trade."
