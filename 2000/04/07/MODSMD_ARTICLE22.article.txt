# Startup to aid collaboration

### SANDRA UPSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Senior Stephen Kane remem
bers going to Big Came and
thinking how students could
have more fun at one big tailgate
party. But instead, different
groups throw dozens of isolated
parties.
"Student groups don't know
what other groups on campus
are doing," Kane said, explain
ing the idea behind his startup,
Ciroupengines.com.
He and junior Danny Jacobs
have drawn on their own experi
ence working with different cam
pus groups to launch the compa
ny. They hope the site makes it
easier for student groups to col
laborate with each other and
community organizations on dif
ferent projects.
The group is launching a pre
view site today, at
www.Ciroupengines.net, with a
database covering over 100 cam
puses and 10,000 student
groups. Ihe permanent site,
www.Ciroupengines.com, will go
live on Sunday.
"We wanted to give Stanford a
chance to check it out first," Kane
said.
" There is also a need to know
what students on other campuses
are doing, so that students can
share resources, see what other
students are doing and have
done, and perhaps help out some
other school groups that could
benefit from Stanford's resources
but might be rich in ideas and in
volvement."
Both Kane and Jacobs have
been active in student organiza
tions. Jacobs c urrently serves as

junior class presi
dent and has been
involved with Stan
ford in Government.
Kane founded Big
Siblings, an umbrella
group that encom
passes several men-

toring programs. He also was
sophomore class president and
served as an ASSU senator.
The pair met two years ago
when both interned at the White
House. Jacobs, inspired by his
mother, went to Kane with an
idea to help people connect to
their community.
Last year Kane and Jacobs
perfected their business plan and
met with John Witchel, a veteran
of the startup business. Witchel,
CEO of Red Gorilla.com and a
Stanford graduate, started a suc
cessful consulting company for
startups while at Stanford.
"Even though from the very
first meeting he tore us down,
he's helped us out immeasurably.
Every time we were told 'no,' in
stead of being discouraged, we
found a way around it. That's
what being an entrepreneur is all
about," Jacobs said.
Kane and Jacobs then both left
campus to study at Oxford for a
quarter. "We isolated ourselves,
brainstormed, and it was then
that we realized we'd stumbled
across a big market and revenue
streams," Jacobs said.
"Even six months into it, we
were nonprofit. We came from a
background of feeling guilty for
making money. But we were told
that when we're for profit, it's eas
ier to attract support," Kane said
After returning from Oxford
earlier this year and conferring

with Witchel, Kane and Jacobs
decided to build their Web site
before asking venture capitalists
for money.
"We had two programmers
and nothing else, so we had to
build a team, fast. We had noth
ing to offer people â€” we can't
offer stock because we're not in
corporated. We have nothing ex
cept an idea, an offer of future in
volvement, and the belief that we
are doing it the smart way," Kane
said.
"Being in the heart of the Sili
con Valley, you hear all these
rags-to-riches stories .... in this
story, the 40 people we're work
ing with are the heroes. 1 want
everyone to know about the 40
people who took a considerable
risk by getting involved," Kane
said.
Their goal is to launch the
final site this September. They
are currently trying to get feed
back from other colleges on the
work they have done so far. They
aim to get funding and to begin
selling stock by the summer.
"We've put $10,000 of our
own money in and it hasn't
been easy," said Jacobs. "If we
don't get funding from a few
angel investors and VCs, we're
willing to max out our credit
cards and do whatever it takes
to make this happen. That's
what John [Witchel] did and it
worked."
