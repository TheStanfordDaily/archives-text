### SAMEER AHMED STAFF WRITER 
It doesn't get any bigger than this.
Stanford, UCLA and Southern California, ar
guably the three best collegiate men's tennis pro
grams ever, will battle this weekend at the l aube
Family Tennis ('.enter.
The numbers speak for themselves. Stanford,
I'CIA and ISC have combined to win 40 of the
possible 54 NCAA championships since the NCAA
Team Championship was created in 1940. Besides
(Georgia, no other team outside of this (lalifornian
trio has won an NCAA championship since 1972.
"1 think the tradition of this rivalry is phenom
enal," said head coach Dick Could. "We've won 16
championships. ILIA and USC. have each won
15, and no one else has won more than three."
Play begins today at 1 :30 p.m. as the No. 4 Car
din.il (15-0,3-0 Pacific 10 (lonlerence) and the No.
1 Bruins (10-2, 3-0) will face off to determine who
is not only the best team in the Tac-10, but possibly
the nation.
The match will be the second time the two
teams have met this year. The Bruins will attempt
to avenge their loss to the Cardinal on Feb. 27 in
the finals of the LSI.VI I A National Men's Team
Indoor Championships in I .ouisville, I\v. Stanford

captured its 11th National Team Indoor title by
defeating UCI A, 4-3, in one of the closest matches
all year.
In the deciding match, junior Alex Kim
squeezed by UCLA's Jong-Min Lee, 0-4, 4-6, 1-0
(10-4) at No. 1 singles to break a 3-3 tie and clinch
the Cardinal victory.
Because of Stanford's win at the National Team
Indoors, the premier collegiate team indoor event
of the season, the Cardinal gained the No. 1 rank
ing in the country. However, because of UCIA's
demanding schedule with wins over then-No. 3
Duke and then-No. 4 Florida in the last tew weeks,
the Bruins have ousted the Cardinal from the top
spot.
Although Stanford is the only undefeated team
remaining in men's collegiate tennis, it has slipped
to No. 4. Today's match should decide who right
fully deserves to be at the top of the rankings.
The Stanford-UCLA match will mark the return
of sophomore K.J. Hippensteel in singles play.
Because of a severe case of mononucleosis, H ip
pensteel, the No. 1 player in the country at the
time of his illness, did not play against UCLA at the
National Team Indoors and has not competed in
singles in dual match play this season.
UCLA's top player the past two years, All-Amer
ican Jean-Noel Crinda, also did not play singles
the last time the two teams met. Crinda has sat out
the majority of the season because ofa back injury.
However, today, Hippensteel and Crinda will
play key roles in helping their respective teams to
victory.

"I expect the match to be very close and com
petitive," Gould said. "With Grinda, they are
going to be a stronger team than they were in the
Indoors. We'll get K.J. back, but he won't be at full
strength."
UCLA is one of the few teams in the country
that has the manpower and talent to match the
Cardinal. Led by No. 26 Jong-Min Lee, the Bruins
have four players ranked in the ITATop 100 sin
gles rankings. Also, Lee and Brandon Kramer are
fourth in the doubles rankings.
To compete with the Bruins, Stanford has three
players ranked in the ITATop 100, including two
in the top ten-Kim at No. 3 and senior Geoff
Abrams at No. 9. In doubles, Kim and Abrams are
the No. 1 duo in the nation.
If the Cardinal can get past the Bruins, its un
defeated season will be tested by No. 18 USC (12-
6, 2-1) on Saturday at noon.
USC, has played a very tough schedule this year.
Five of its six losses are to teams ranked in the top
25. The Trojans are coming off two very close 4-3
losses to UCLA and No. 3 Fepperdine.
"The [UCLA and USC] matches will be a great
challenge for us," Gould said. "These are pivotal
matches because whoever wins will have a heads
up in the seeding for the NCAA tournament. If we
don't beat them up here, it'll be twice as hard to
beat them down south."
The Cardinal will play both UCLA and USC at
least one more time this year. Stanford will travel
to Los Angeles to play the Trojans on April 21 and
the Bruins the day after.
