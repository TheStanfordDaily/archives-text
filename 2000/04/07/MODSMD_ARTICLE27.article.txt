## 
### TIM KANE STAFF WRITER 
Relax, Stanford baseball lanv All is apparetith well
in the world again.
After dropping two of three games to Arizona State
last weekend and slipping to fourth plaee in I lie Pacific
10 Conference, the No. 7 Cardinal (22-9, 3-3 Pac-10)
bounced hack Tuesday with an 18-2 dismantling of
Sacramento State, giving the team a much-needed con
fidence boost before heading up to Washington State
(14-18, 2-4) for a three-game series this weekend.
I'lie C laflfttffttf can't allbrcl to come out of Pullman
with only one win/given the group of'quality teams pre
sent in the such as L'SC, I'CIA and also AS I .
Head coach Mark Marquess thinks it won't be as cut
and dry as it has tended to be in the past.

"I think it's going to be a wild race ... I mean, I
haven't seen all the teams yet, but i think there's four or
five that can win it," said Marquess.
I ridav night, WSI "s Cougars get the unenviable task
of lacing the Cardinal's ace junior Justin Wayne (7-1,
I . ( .)f> K.RA, 77k) in the series opener between the two
teams. 1 his is he first time Stanford has made the long
trek up to Pullman in Marquess" tenure as head coach.
Back in the clays of the Pac-10 Southern Division,
Stanford rarely played WSI — perhaps leaving the
coach a little nostalgic for the old days.
"I miss the old Six-Pac — maybe I'm too old," said
Marquess. "It's diflercfiJtU>ut MatHvhai \tfe' J re doing
and we'll go with it." , , > >
