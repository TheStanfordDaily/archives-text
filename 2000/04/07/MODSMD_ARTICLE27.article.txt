Relax, Stanford baseball lanv All is apparetith well
in the world again.
After dropping two of three games to Arizona State
last weekend and slipping to fourth plaee in I lie Pacific
10 Conference, the No. 7 Cardinal (22-9, 3-3 Pac-10)
bounced hack Tuesday with an 18-2 dismantling of
Sacramento State, giving the team a much-needed con
fidence boost before heading up to Washington State
(14-18, 2-4) for a three-game series this weekend.
I'lie C laflfttffttf can't allbrcl to come out of Pullman
with only one win/given the group of'quality teams pre
sent in the such as L'SC, I'CIA and also AS I .
Head coach Mark Marquess thinks it won't be as cut
and dry as it has tended to be in the past.

"I think it's going to be a wild race ... I mean, I
haven't seen all the teams yet, but i think there's four or
five that can win it," said Marquess.
I ridav night, WSI "s Cougars get the unenviable task
of lacing the Cardinal's ace junior Justin Wayne (7-1,
I . ( .)f> K.RA, 77k) in the series opener between the two
teams. 1 his is he first time Stanford has made the long
trek up to Pullman in Marquess" tenure as head coach.
Back in the clays of the Pac-10 Southern Division,
Stanford rarely played WSI — perhaps leaving the
coach a little nostalgic for the old days.
"I miss the old Six-Pac — maybe I'm too old," said
Marquess. "It's diflercfiJtU>ut MatHvhai \tfe' J re doing
and we'll go with it." , , > >

Sophomore Brian Soger fires a pitch earlier this season. This weekend, the Cardinal will head up north to take on
Washington State without the injured Sager, who shut out the Cougars last year.
