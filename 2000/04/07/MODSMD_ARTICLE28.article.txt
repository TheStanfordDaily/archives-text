### ELISSA KESZLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I his weekend, Stanford women's water polo will
be competing for the title of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation at the conference c hampionship
tournament hosted by San Jose State. Currently,
the Cardinal is in a three-way tie for first place with
(California and I CIA.
These three teams have one conference loss
each, holding a S-1 record. Stanford's sole loss
came from (California who defeated the (Cardinal (>-
on March 2f>. That was the (Cardinal's third loss to
the Beats this year.
Due to the three-way tie, seeding for this week
end's tournament was based on goal differential,
which uses mosi goals scored and fewest goals al
lowed as the deciding factor. Based on this system,
(California goes in the topped ranked team, fol
lowed by UCCIAand then Stanford. In the national
poll, Stanford remains as the No. 2 team, second to
Cal.
"()ur losses to ( al have to do with communica
tion problems and a lack of connectiveness within
our team rather than due to California's skill." said
junior Kris Koblik. "If we get a c hance to play Cal,
we need to come together as a team and use our
speed to wear them down."
Stanford is known for its speed, swimming abili
ty and endurance.
Because of this, the (Cardinal places a large focus
on using its counter attacks to score and to physi
cally drain its opponents allowing Stanford to gain
control over the game.
The MPSF tournament begins today, and the
(Cardinal will play the University of Hawaii at 10:45
a.m. followed by a 3:05 p.m. game against Pacific.

()n Saturday Stanford will fust fare San Diego State
at 10:45 a.m. and then pla\ I (LA at 5:15 p.m.
Stanford lias a 3-0 record against I CLA thus far
ill is year.
Should the Cardinal win all four of these games,
it is likely to fare (California or I SC in the (champi
onship game.
"I'm excited about the tournament this week
end. and I am hoping we will get a chance to play
Cal," said freshman Julie Gardner. "It's frustrating
that we have not beaten them yet. I his weekend
may give us a c hance to do so."
"UCLA, California, L'SC and Stanford are all
fairly equal in skill," Koblik said. "Any one of
these teams has a chance at winning the tourna
ment. The team that can put together the best
string of victories will be the team who will come
out on top."
Stanford has yet to win a conference title. While
this weekend it has high hopes of winning its con
ference, the Cardinal still remains focused on
learning and improving for national champi
onships in May.
"Kadi game we play we learn something new
about ourselves and what we need to improve
on," (iardner said. "While winning MI'SI s would
be fun, we need to remember that our ultimate
goal is a national title. Everything we do now is a
means for setting ourselves up for that tourna
ment."
National championships is approaching quickk.
After this weekend's tournament, Stanford has a
dual match against I (l-Davis April 14. and then the
national qualifying tournament .April 22-23. I lie
Cardinal performance and finishing in that tour
nament will decide its seeding for national champi
onships.
