# Wayne's time to shine
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's what ragging teammates call a "vulture win"
— a reliever enters late in a ballgame and cleans up
after a starter, benefiting from an offensive play or
two and receiving credit for the victory.
Hard to believe, but Stanford junior Justin
Wayne used just that sort of tactic to set into morion
one of the most illustrious careers in Stanford base
ball history.
Early in his 1998 freshman campaign, Wayne
picked up his first collegiate win with 2 2/3 innings
of scoreless relief against Cal State-Fullerton.
Since then, Wayne consistently has preyed — like
a vulture — upon opponents to amass a sparkling
23-2 all-time record and a place atop the record
books with Stanford's best-ever winning percent
age.
The son and brother of former collegiate players,
raised in a baseball-intensive home, Wayne's long
path from Honolulu to Stanford was more like a
smoothly moving walkway.
"1 was given a ball even before I could walk," said
Wayne. "And all the g<xxl fortune brought me
here."
Wayne grew up saluting pictures of his Brooklyn
native father's favorite players, and from then on he
set on a course during which the national pastime
would never leave his side.
A virtual unknown at the Punahou School in
Honolulu, Wayne went unnoticed by collegiate
scouts for much of his high school career. But at a
baseball camp in the summer of 1996, the pinpoint
control of the right bander over his pitches — he
now has an impressive repertoire including a fast
ball, changeup, curveball, and slider — jumped out
at head coach Mark Marquess.
"After we saw [Wayne] pitch, we felt without
question he would turn out to be an outstanding col
lege pitcher, and he's been absolutely fantastic,"
Marquess said.
Wayne became a starter his sophomore year and
lost only once all season — in his first outing of the
year in late January. What he didn't know then, and
what he marvels at now, is that he would not tally an
other mark in the loss column for 27 straight starts
on the hill.
As the wins have piled up for the 6-3, 200-pound

ace, he cannot help but remember the only two
blemishes on his record more clearly than his 23 vic
tories.
"I'd have to say the two losses stick out more," he
said. Then, cautiously tapping the maple desk and
grinning widely, he continued: "1 mean, there are
only two of them . .. let's keep it that way.
Though cast in the media shadow of fellow junior
starter Jason Young for much of last season, Wayne
moved into the leading starter's role when Young
felt shoulder soreness early this year.
Pitching coach Tom Kunis understands that the
sensation of Young last season may have shaded
Wayne from some deserved national attention, but
argues that by no means is the well-rounded junior
underrated by opponents when they face him on
the mound.
"You ask anybody that's had to face J ustin Wayne
and I guarantee you they didn't underrate him,"
Kunis said. "Jason Young is such a visible entity that
he could overshadow a lot of people, but [Wayne] is
his own man . .. and could easily be anyone's I 4 riday
night guy."
Wayne has nothing but praise for his talented
teammate in Young, from whom he said he has
learned an invaluable amount about being a solid
starting pitcher.
He credits Young with setting an example of a
fearless, battling No. 1 starter, a quality Wayne has
begun to develop as he seeks to close out games with
more regularity. This season, Wayne has pitched
four complete games in only nine starts, a remark
able improvement over last season's total of only one
in 21.
Part of Wayne's success as a pitcher is his com
pleteness as a young man, displaying remarkable
maturity and poise both on and off the field. In
order to prepare for his starts, he ritualistically cre
ates a "central focus" by sitting down moments be
fore game time to come to a "good sense of how to
get things done."
But perhaps the key to Wayne's spiritual balance
comes hours before the first pitch.
"I do like taking naps, I'll tell you that," lie says,
comically alluding to the nonexistent laziness of a
player characterized by coaches as one of the most
dedicated workers on the team.

After two years in the shadow of his teammates, junior Justin Wayne has emerged as one of the Cardinal aces,
with a lifetime 23-2 record.
In addition to playing baseball
lor the (Cardinal, Wayne pitched two
summers for learn USA, travelling
to Nicaragua in 1998 and Japan the
year after. He said the "tnind-open
ing" experience allowed him to gain
a greater understanding of the
world outside of baseball and add
more completely to his personal
growth.
Wayne's upbringing far from
the limelight and invaluable expe

rience in international competition
influenced his personality a great
deal.
I his past contributed to the level
headedness of the Stanford ace,
which allows him to contemplate his
place in school history with a
uniquely humble perspective.
"I haven't thought enough
about it to appreciate it for all its
worth," he said. "It's just an unbe
lievable sense to see your name
next to those [of the great Stanford
pitchers of the past]. I'll get a better
sense of what it means a couple
years from now."
Wayne's coaches echo his desire
to hold off On any comparison with

Stanford greats until his career is
complete, though they cannot hold
off their praise completely.
"His competitiveness, his work
ethic, and his control make him
one of the best I've ever coached,"
Kunis said.
As Wayne sets his sights on a Pa
cific 10 (Conference title for the Car
dinal, he will build on an outstand
ing career that places him among
the Stanford elite.
And for the draft-bound junior,
nothing would make a nicer closing
chapter than feasting, vulture
style, on the remains of seven other
teams in Omaha in celebration of a
College World Series title.

baseball camp in the summer of 1996, the pinpoint
control of the right bander over his pitches — he
now has an impressive repertoire including a fast
ball, changeup, curveball, and slider — jumped out
at head coach Mark Marquess.
"After we saw [Wayne] pitch, we felt without
question he would turn out to be an outstanding col
lege pitcher, and he's been absolutely fantastic,"
Marquess said.
Wayne became a starter his sophomore year and
lost only once all season — in his first outing of the
year in late January. What he didn't know then, and
what he marvels at now, is that he would not tally an
other mark in the loss column for 27 straight starts
on the hill.
As the wins have piled up for the 6-3, 200-pound

ace, he cannot help but remember the only two
blemishes on his record more clearly than his 23 vic
tories.
"I'd have to say the two losses stick out more," he
said. Then, cautiously tapping the maple desk and
grinning widely, he continued: "1 mean, there are
only two of them . .. let's keep it that way.
Though cast in the media shadow of fellow junior
starter Jason Young for much of last season, Wayne
moved into the leading starter's role when Young
felt shoulder soreness early this year.
Pitching coach Tom Kunis understands that the
sensation of Young last season may have shaded
Wayne from some deserved national attention, but
argues that by no means is the well-rounded junior
underrated by opponents when they face him on
the mound.
"You ask anybody that's had to face J ustin Wayne
and I guarantee you they didn't underrate him,"
Kunis said. "Jason Young is such a visible entity that
he could overshadow a lot of people, but [Wayne] is
his own man . .. and could easily be anyone's I 4 riday
night guy."
Wayne has nothing but praise for his talented
teammate in Young, from whom he said he has
learned an invaluable amount about being a solid
starting pitcher.
He credits Young with setting an example of a
fearless, battling No. 1 starter, a quality Wayne has
begun to develop as he seeks to close out games with
more regularity. This season, Wayne has pitched
four complete games in only nine starts, a remark
able improvement over last season's total of only one
in 21.
Part of Wayne's success as a pitcher is his com
pleteness as a young man, displaying remarkable
maturity and poise both on and off the field. In
order to prepare for his starts, he ritualistically cre
ates a "central focus" by sitting down moments be
fore game time to come to a "good sense of how to
get things done."
But perhaps the key to Wayne's spiritual balance
comes hours before the first pitch.
"I do like taking naps, I'll tell you that," lie says,
comically alluding to the nonexistent laziness of a
player characterized by coaches as one of the most
dedicated workers on the team.

After two years in the shadow of his teammates, junior Justin Wayne has emerged as one of the Cardinal aces,
with a lifetime 23-2 record.
In addition to playing baseball
lor the (Cardinal, Wayne pitched two
summers for learn USA, travelling
to Nicaragua in 1998 and Japan the
year after. He said the "tnind-open
ing" experience allowed him to gain
a greater understanding of the
world outside of baseball and add
more completely to his personal
growth.
Wayne's upbringing far from
the limelight and invaluable expe

rience in international competition
influenced his personality a great
deal.
I his past contributed to the level
headedness of the Stanford ace,
which allows him to contemplate his
place in school history with a
uniquely humble perspective.
"I haven't thought enough
about it to appreciate it for all its
worth," he said. "It's just an unbe
lievable sense to see your name
next to those [of the great Stanford
pitchers of the past]. I'll get a better
sense of what it means a couple
years from now."
Wayne's coaches echo his desire
to hold off On any comparison with

Stanford greats until his career is
complete, though they cannot hold
off their praise completely.
"His competitiveness, his work
ethic, and his control make him
one of the best I've ever coached,"
Kunis said.
As Wayne sets his sights on a Pa
cific 10 (Conference title for the Car
dinal, he will build on an outstand
ing career that places him among
the Stanford elite.
And for the draft-bound junior,
nothing would make a nicer closing
chapter than feasting, vulture
style, on the remains of seven other
teams in Omaha in celebration of a
College World Series title.
