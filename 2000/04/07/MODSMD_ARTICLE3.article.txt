# New startup hopes to cater to disabled
## Web site will provide advice on accessibility 
### PETER STAIR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Four months ago, Empower!)
was only an idea in former yell
leader Joe Cavanaugh's head.
Now, ihe dot-com company aimed
at serving the disabled community
employs almost thirty people, op
erates from an office in San Fran
cisco, and has nearly secured sev
eral million dollars in venture c ap
ital.
In some ways a typical Silicon
Valley story — at least four Stan
ford students have stopped out to
work full-time — Empowerl) has
attracted special interest because

of its mission. Cavanaugh, who is
in a wheelchair, wants to create a
site "which could cater to all the ac
cessibility, news, information and
products for the disabled commu
nity."
Empowerl) currently makes
money by selling advertisement
space and helping other Web sites
become "Bobby-compliant," or
easy to translate into a format un
derstandable to blind people.
Currently, Empower!) is close
to finalizing a venture capital in
vestment worth between $2 and
$6 million. Then, the focus will be
a successful launch of the site be
fore April. A beta site is currently
up.
Eventually, it will add a com
merce area to the site, where cus
tomers can buy products designed

empower

for the disabled, but also where
general books and music: can be
sold. Successfully adding this com
ponent to the site would bring Em
power!) a larger stream of rev
enue, according to Cavanaugh, a
junior.
More money means more secu
rity and freedom. "We are a com
pany [rather than an organization,
or "dot-org"] because we wanted
to keep this going and make this a
power," said Cavanaugh, a junior.
"We want to keep our employees,
making [Empower!)) a strong en
tity rather than rely on outside
funding."
So far, investors agree that the
company has a strong future.
Going public is, according to So
rani, uncertain and distant, but
possible. Meanwhile, as competing

sites for the disabled have shut
down, Empower!) has had the de
lightful task of turning investors
down.
But Cavanaugh said the finan
cial bottom line is not the compa
ny's focus.
"We're a bunch of people who
are really dedicated to this idea,"
he said. "Money has never really
been an issue."
All EmpowerD's employees are
either disabled or close to some
one who is disabled.
Since a spinal infection perma
nently paralyzed his legs, Ca
vanaugh has lived in a world built
for the able-bodied, one where a
staircase is a blockade.
"I got tired spending hours try-
ing to find a good restaurant or
good piece of news relating to dis
ability because the information
was so fragmented."
Cavanaugh did not decide to
do something about his frustra
tions until he studied in Oxford
last fall quarter. In England, suit
able hotels were difficult to find,
and great but inaccessible muse
ums were closed to him.
Europe's inaccessibility for the
disabled brought Cavanaugh's
problem into focus. After talking
the idea over with another Stan
ford junior, Doug Aley, the two de
cided to build a Web site to inform
other disabled travelers where
they were welcome and also to
consolidate useful health re
sources, recreational information
and news relevant to people with
all types of disabilities.
The success of Cavanaugh and
Aley's idea has depended on
friends. In order to collect infor
mation about accessible eateries in
cities around the country, Ca
vanaugh and Aley have asked
friends and relatives to evaluate
the restaurants in their home
towns.
New employees at Empower!)
were "friends or friends of
friends." Cavanaugh said the com
pany has received a lot of financial
support from "a friends and fami
ly run."
When Cavanaugh and Aley de
cided to bring in an outside CEO,
they talked to Marco Sorani, "a
friend of a friend" and a financial
software project manager at Ora
cle.
"Silicon Valley is about the face
to-face. We feed off each other's
energy," Sorani said. "When I met
Cavanaugh and Aley, I knew they
believed in what they're doing."
Sorani said it was a risk to leave his
"stable and pretty fulfilling career"
with Oracle, but after seeing their
intelligence and energy, lie decid
ed it was worth taking.
Cavanaugh said Sorani has
brought some experience and
credibility to the operation with
out sacrificing the company's flex
ibility. According to Cavanaugh,

so fin the attitude has been "if you
have an idea, throw it out and
work wherever you do best."
A typical sixteen-hour clay can
include writing press releases,
making contacts, adding informa
tion to the Web site and coping
with whatever else may come up.

Kevin Gough, another junior
who joined the company early on,
said the work atmosphere is "the
same as Stanford's: a lot of young,
creative people."
Even though Cavanaugh often
works from 7 a.m. to 2 or 3 a.m. ar
ranging partnerships with e-com

merce Web sites, lie calls t he work
rewarding.
"It's hard work, but I care so
much about it, it's easy,"
vanaugh said.
"We're a success pretty much
because we're not going to accept
any kind of failure."
