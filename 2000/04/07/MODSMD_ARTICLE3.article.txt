# New startup hopes to cater to disabled
## Web site will provide advice on accessibility 
### PETER STAIR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Four months ago, Empower!)
was only an idea in former yell
leader Joe Cavanaugh's head.
Now, ihe dot-com company aimed
at serving the disabled community
employs almost thirty people, op
erates from an office in San Fran
cisco, and has nearly secured sev
eral million dollars in venture c ap
ital.
In some ways a typical Silicon
Valley story — at least four Stan
ford students have stopped out to
work full-time — Empowerl) has
attracted special interest because

of its mission. Cavanaugh, who is
in a wheelchair, wants to create a
site "which could cater to all the ac
cessibility, news, information and
products for the disabled commu
nity."
Empowerl) currently makes
money by selling advertisement
space and helping other Web sites
become "Bobby-compliant," or
easy to translate into a format un
derstandable to blind people.
Currently, Empower!) is close
to finalizing a venture capital in
vestment worth between $2 and
$6 million. Then, the focus will be
a successful launch of the site be
fore April. A beta site is currently
up.
Eventually, it will add a com
merce area to the site, where cus
tomers can buy products designed

empower

for the disabled, but also where
general books and music: can be
sold. Successfully adding this com
ponent to the site would bring Em
power!) a larger stream of rev
enue, according to Cavanaugh, a
junior.
More money means more secu
rity and freedom. "We are a com
pany [rather than an organization,
or "dot-org"] because we wanted
to keep this going and make this a
power," said Cavanaugh, a junior.
"We want to keep our employees,
making [Empower!)) a strong en
tity rather than rely on outside
funding."
So far, investors agree that the
company has a strong future.
Going public is, according to So
rani, uncertain and distant, but
possible. Meanwhile, as competing

sites for the disabled have shut
down, Empower!) has had the de
lightful task of turning investors
down.
But Cavanaugh said the finan
cial bottom line is not the compa
ny's focus.
"We're a bunch of people who
are really dedicated to this idea,"
he said. "Money has never really
been an issue."
All EmpowerD's employees are
either disabled or close to some
one who is disabled.
Since a spinal infection perma
nently paralyzed his legs, Ca
vanaugh has lived in a world built
for the able-bodied, one where a
staircase is a blockade.
