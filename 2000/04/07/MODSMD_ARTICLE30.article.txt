# Softball looks for conference wins
## 
### EMILY DRESSEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
To be the best, yon have to play the best.
Last weekend it was the relentless wrath of No. I
Washington and No. 3 UCI A. This weekend, No. 2
Arizona and No. 4 Arizona State will bear their ca
nines to the No. 9 Stanford softball team.
The fun never stops.
Over the course of the weekend, Stanford will bat
tle it out with two extremely talented Pacific 10 Con
ference teams.
I he Cardinal will compete against Arizona State
(34-6,2-2) today in Tempeand then caravan to Tus
con to meet forces with Arizona (39-3, 3-0) who is
currently leading the Pat -1 0 along with Washington,
both Saturday and Sunday.
Although 32-7 overall, the Cardinal's conference
record currently stands at 1-4 and could use a little
bit of a boost.
Easier said than done, however, considering the
magnitude, depth, and undeniable superiority oft he
Pat -10 conference.
Currently, font of the five spots in the National
Fastpitch Coaches' Association poll are claimed by
Pac-10 teams.
Still, the young Stanford team does possess the tal
ent to blaze past these historic powerhouses and
leave them coughing in the dust.
"We are capable of beating every team," said se
nior catcher Kellie Wiginton. "We knew going into

the Pac-10 every game was going to be a battle. I
tllJUjk \vc are ready lo turn things aronnd. It's
going to take one good game to get our momentum
flowing again." I
After three tough losses to Washington and
I (]LA last weekend at home, (6-0,1-0,8-0) the Car
dinal redoubled its efforts and came out with two
wins against St. Mary's on Tuesday.
1 lowever, after a scoreless weekend and two low
scoring games against the Gaels, (3-0 and 2-1), it is
questionable whether or not the Stanford offense is
still capable of producing the plethora of runs the
team generated earlier in the season.
The Cardinal will most likely face Sun Devil pitch
er, Kirsten Voak, who leads the conference in wins
(23) and total innings pitched (163.2).
Over the following two days, the squad will test its
bats against another one of the top pitchers in the
country, Jenni Finch, the conference's top pitcher
overall with a record of 19-0 and an ERA of .43.
Yet the Cardinal has some key aces in the circle it
self, four outstanding freshman players. Unfortu
nately, two of the four continue to recover from per
sistent injuries and are questionable for this week
end.
Dana Sorensen is nursing a stiff shoulder while
Jaime Forman-Lau continues to throw in practice
and in the bullpen during games, but remains side
lined due to a finger injury.
Tori Nyberg ((5-1) and Maureen LeCocq (5-2) will
again have to step up for the Cardinal and fill in the

pitching void as they did last weekend in PaolO play.
Pifrhing alone, however, won't win Softball
games. This would be a good time for the offense to
get back on track as well.
"At the beginning of the season it always seemed
like two or three people were really hot at the plate,"
said Wiginton. "Right now we are kind of in a slump
as a team."
"ft happens to every player. If hits aren't falling
for you, you start to over-analyze your swing, until
you drag yourself into an even bigger slump."
Sophomore center fielder Jessica Mendoza
agrees.
"We have had so many talks lately about how we
are playing, how we aren't hitting, how we are strug
gling, that everyone is doing too much thinking and
not enough playing.
"I think it's the type of people we are, perfection
ists who over-analyze everything. We keep thinking
of everything that could go wrong or what went
wrong last time, that we forget to just do what we
know. In Softball you can't do that. At some point you
just have to stop thinking and play."
Stanford will get that chance this weekend against
two of the top teams in the country.
The pressure is not on the Cardinal, however. As
the lower seeded team, most people don't expect
Stanford to come out victorious. But, stranger things
have happened.
As Mendoza put it, "We have nothing to lose. And
after all, things can only go up from last weekend."
