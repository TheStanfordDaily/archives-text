\ win loi Stan ft »rtl would strengthen its
s|»Di ,is seventh in the conference and
IIi 111 'mate I'at i tit as a team who could beat
diii ilit- Cardinal Ibi a spot. It would also
mean revenge for Stanford who was kept
out of the tournament last year after los
ing two live-game matt lies to the I igers.

Pacific faces the Cardinal in its last
home match of the season. A win will be
necessary to keep playoff hopes alive be
fore heading to Hawaii to face the No. 6
Rainbows in its last two regular season
matches.
"We cannot take the approach that
we've played Hawaii, USC and Long
Beach and now we have an easy team,"
head coach Ruben Nieves. "1 think we're
going to come up against a team that's
playing like they're fighting for their
lives."
Pacific is certainly not a team that
should be underestimated. 1 he Tigers
claimed victories against No. 7 BYU, last
year's NCAA champions, and No. 13 Ball
State, both teams that breezed by Stanford
in three games this season. Meanwhile
Stanford boasts wins over No. I Long
Beach State, No. 9 Loyola Marymount
and Sail Diego State, all teams that lamed

the 1 igers this season.
"1 think the two teams are fairly evenly
matched," Nieves said. "They have been
unpredictable this season. I think they're
a dangerous team that puts six good play
ers on the court."
A strong team effort gave Stanford the
edge during its first matt hup with Pacific
in late February and the Cardinal sent the
Tigers borne with a 3-1 loss. Tomorrow
Stanford will have to bring a similar game
if it's going to beat the Tigers on their own
home turf.
lo lead the way, Stanford looks to
freshman Cant I oppel, the national
leader in kills-per-ganie average 8.70.
After becoming the first player this season
to break 50 kills last weekend with his 50
kill performance against Long Beach
State, loppel snagged his third MPSF
player of the week honors and also bt last
ed America Volleyball Coaches Associa

tion National player of the week.
Stan lord also has a nation leader in ju
nior setter Josh Lukens, who leads the
country in assists, averaging 20.70 assists
per-game. With 100 assists in lasi week
end's victory, Lukens surpassed the 3,000
mark in career assists and slid into third in
the Stanford record books with 3137.
Pacific's main weapon rests in junior
Vladimir Andric who led the Tigers last
season in kills-per-game (5.58), aces-per
game (.400) and digs-per-ganie (1.76).
While Andric h;is been relatively silent this
season, Stanford veterans are wary of his
50 kill dominating performance against
the (Cardinal last year.
"Even though [Andric] hasn't mat< lied
his hitting output of last year, he has it in
him," Nieves said. "11 he gets hot, he's
makes it really tough."
Andric leads the Tigers with 4.95 kills
per-game and in digs with 142 and 1.67 per

game. match, Stanford was successful
at containing the Tiger standout and held
Andric to a . 108 hitting percentage.
"We have to he careful about not getting
so worried about him that the other guys
beat us," Nieves said referring to Pacific's
other strong outside hitters, senior Dylan
112 ierrick and sophomore Dan Hoefer.
Both 1 loefer and senior middle block
er Darrell Dilmore hit over .500 against
Stanford earlier this season and are both
over .300 for the season. Dilmore leads the
conference in hitting percentage with .492
and is ninth with in the conference with
his 1.46 blocking average.
"We absolutely have to play with a lot of
desire," Nieves said. "We have to want to
win as much as them and hopefully more
than them, 112 hope that we're more confi
dent in our abilities after the Long Beach
match and I hope that the success we got
makes us want more success."
