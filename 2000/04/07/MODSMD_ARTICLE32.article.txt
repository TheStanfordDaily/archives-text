where the best in the west will convene to compete for
a spot among at the top.
48 high school, collegiate, and post collegiate teams
will descend on the Stanford campus to compete in the
two day tournament that is held at New Maloneyand
surrounding fields. Fhe tournament is structured in

school teams and four divisions of combined collegiate
and post-collegiate clubs teams.
Stanford (0-7) will compete in a division with two
San Francisco and two Seattle post-collegiate club
teams, Arizona, and the Davis almuni team.
Although this tournament draws 112 rom a pool of the
most talented lacrosse teams in the region, the out
tome of the games played this weekend will hold no
bearing on Stanford's ranking in the Western
Women's lacrosse League or on its national ranking.
Instead of linusing entirely on the outcome of its
games, the (lardinal will use the games to regroup and
prepare for its upcoming competition.
"We are going to be out there this weekend for our
love of the game and to continue honing our skills as
we head to the remainder of the season which is in
credibly tough," said head coach I ieidi Connor.
I bis weekend, Stanford will focus on improving its
double teaming and its cohesion and teamwork on of
fense. I he Cardinal's work on offense will be particu
larly important this weekend as it struggles to adjust to
the loss of senior Hedy Born who suffered a serious
knee injury on Sunday. Born has been an offensive
threat for the (Cardinal this season and is currently the

team's all-time leading scorer.
"Hedy's absence will definitely be felt this weekend.
She is someone we can consistently l(x>k for to score
goals. We are going to have to adjust as a team — oth
ers are going to have to step up," said senior co-captain
Rachel Gallagher.
The Cardinal will benefit this weekend from there
turn of freshman goalkeeper Rachael Neumann who
missed two games over the weekend when she was
sidelined with a concussion. Neumann, the team's
only goalkeeper, was replaced at the last minute by
Catherine Hunt, who had never before played goal
keeper.
Despite the loss of its goalkeeper, Stanford put forth
a remarkable effort and lost by two and three goals, re
spectively, against Denver and UC-Davislast weekend.
"Our defenders were blocking shots off the eight
meter, we were double teaming all over the place and
our sh(K)ting percentage was as high as it's been all sea
son," Connor said.
Stanford is currently tied for second in its confer
ence and will likely qualify as one of the four teams
from the conference to compete in the WWLL playoffs
held on April 29. The playoffs will, in turn, determine
the two teams 112 rom the northern region to compete in
the WWLL Final Four.
The tournament this weekend will serve as prepa
ration for this postseason competition.
"It's a good opportunity to start a comeback. If we
set a higher standard of play in the games we play this
weekend, then we can set the tone for the rest of the
season," said senior co-captain Christina Cilyutin.
The Cardinal will compete at 9am, 10am, and
12pm on Saturday. Based on these games, the Cardi
nal will be seeded for its play on Sunday. All divisions'
