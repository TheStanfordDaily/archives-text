### PATRICK C. CROSETTO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The prank caller known to his
victims as "Oscar" was sentenced
yesterday to one year in prison and
five years of probation by a Santa
Clara County judge.
The man, a Menlo Park resdint
whose real name is Simon Posada,,
had made lewd phone calls to fe
male undergraduates over much of
the past decade. He had no appar
ent connection with the University.
Though various newspaper re
ported the investigation lasted
from two to four years, Lt. Del

Bandy, investigations commander
with the Stanford Police, said that
in reality the police "had been get
ting reports of' Oscar phone c alls
for six, seven, eight years."
Over the last several years, Posa
da made at least 400 calls to female
students on campus, in what Bandy
deems a "very conservative esti
mate." The San Francisco Chroni
cle also noted that some female stu
dents were so traumatized that they
had to leave Stanford.
Bandy said that an investigation
team led by Detective A 1 James was
able to break the case last year, rely
ing on the use of new technology
and a few mistakes made by Posa
da.
"We started looking at some of
his most recent calls," Bandy said.
"We were noticing certain patterns
developing as fill as location from
where he was calling."
I he police put traps on the
phones of all of the females in a cer
tain dormitory.
"We waited for someone fioin
the dorm to call and say they got
an obscene phone call from
'()st ar,'" said Bandy. "We got that
in a couple situations, from the
same number, and we discovered
that phone number belonged to
Mr. Posada."
When Posada was arrested in
March, he was arraigned on 17
felony counts of electronic eaves
dropping and two counts of mak
ing threatening phone calls. I le was
released from the San |ose main jail
alter posting a $200,000 bond, ac
cording to l lie San Francisco
(Chronicle.
Though lie had no prior crimi
nal record, Posada had been or
dered l>\ Superior Court Judge
( diai les I layden to undergo coun
seling while he awaited sentencing
and was out on bail, The Chronicle
also reported.
Bandy noted that Posada's
phone ( alls often came in spurts fol
lowed In long periods of inactivity.
He said he believed that "[Posada]
knew lie had a problem and he
couldn't stop; that's why we
wouldn't hear from him. I hen he
got out of n>ntrol."
Sophomore Kristin Jensen was
one of the last victims of "Oscar"
and one of two or three varsity
g\ mnasis who were harassed.

" I fe called like at eight o'clock on
a Saturday morning, he asked tor
me, I wasn't very awake. I was like,
'Who is this?' I couldn't under
stand, and he said some weird stuff.
I hung up the phone," she said.
"When I realized it was Oscar I
was like 'Oh my God!'" Jensen said.
"I told my RA, and he made me call
the police."
Jensen said she wasn't very wor
ried by the phone call, but "was just
happy they finally caught some
one."
Some recipients of Posada's calls
didn't consider him to be very dan
gerous. "I didn't think he was a
threat ever," said Renaka George,
another victim. "I le was just a lone
ly pervert."
Both George and Jensen agreed
that the sentence was appropriate.
Bandy said that he was "hoping
tor two to three years, but for some
one without a prior criminal history
that's something like what the court
puts out." It he had lieen given the
maximum sentence, Posada could
have faced 19 years in prison and a
$170,000 fine.
Posada also will have to pay resti
tution to some of his victims and
must register as a sex offender for
the rest of his life.
"No matter where he lives in
California, he must register with
the local police agency ever) Janu
ary and say 'Hey, I'm living
[here],'" Bandy explained. "Every
other jurisdiction will know where
he is."
Bandy also noted that if in a
year, Stanford students begin to
start getting phone calls again, "We
could say, 'I ley, where's Simon liv
ing?'"
