With the prices of some course readers exceeding
SIOO at the Stanford Bookstore, many professors
have turned to outside printing sources in search of
lower costs and better customer service. About 20
percent of the course readers used in Stanford c lass
es are now produced by local print and copy stores.
"The price is somewhat lower than the Bookstore,
so the students benefit," said Sociology Prof. Mark
Cranovetter, who has ordered his readers through
Field Copy and Printing for the past two years.
"They also have a very good reputation for quality in
my department. The Bookstore is doing so many
[readers] that it is hard to maintain quality."
However, according to Field Copy and Printing
General Manager Danny Castle, price is not the
main advantage that outside printers offer.
"Sometimes our prices are lower [than the Book
store]. Sometimes they are higher. It's not a con
stant," he said. " They turn to us because our service
is second to none."
Castle said that Field Copy and Printing made it

easier 011 both professors and students by picking up
the materials lor the reader from the professor's of
fice and delivering the finished reader to the class
room.
Other local companies offer very competitive
