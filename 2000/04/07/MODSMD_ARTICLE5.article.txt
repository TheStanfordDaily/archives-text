# Local copy stores print more readers

### KEITH ITO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the prices of some course readers exceeding
SIOO at the Stanford Bookstore, many professors
have turned to outside printing sources in search of
lower costs and better customer service. About 20
percent of the course readers used in Stanford c lass
es are now produced by local print and copy stores.
"The price is somewhat lower than the Bookstore,
so the students benefit," said Sociology Prof. Mark
Cranovetter, who has ordered his readers through
Field Copy and Printing for the past two years.
"They also have a very good reputation for quality in
my department. The Bookstore is doing so many
[readers] that it is hard to maintain quality."
However, according to Field Copy and Printing
General Manager Danny Castle, price is not the
main advantage that outside printers offer.
"Sometimes our prices are lower [than the Book
store]. Sometimes they are higher. It's not a con
stant," he said. " They turn to us because our service
is second to none."
Castle said that Field Copy and Printing made it

easier 011 both professors and students by picking up
the materials lor the reader from the professor's of
fice and delivering the finished reader to the class
room.

reader prices. Copy Source, a Palo
Alto printing company, is selling
an 478 page course reader for the
Encounters and Identities I
HUM class for $23.31, or about
4.8 cents per page. Bookstore
readers, on the other hand, cost 5
cents per page plus processing
and permission costs.
1 lowever, in the case of Copy
Source, there may be a trade-off
between cost and convenience.
"It was nice that the reader was
cheaper than it would have been
at the Bookstore, but getting all
the way to the copy store was
somewhat of a hassle because it
was all the way across Palo Alto,"
said freshman Nick Sydow, who
purchased his Encounters and
Identities I-HUM reader from
Copy Source.
Instructors have a history of
using outside printing companies.
According to Castle, Field Copy
and Printing has been producing
course readers for Stanford class
es for about 15 years. However, in
the past four years, the number of
readers published by the compa-

Ny has risen from approximately
35 per quarter to 100.
The Stanford Bookstore, how
ever, is still the largest producer of
course readers, currently publish
ing about 400 every quarter. Book
store sales of course readers have
not declined in recent years, ac
cording to Lela Rinehart, the Book
store's custom publishing manager.
"We did the same number of ti
tles that we did this quarter last
year," Rinehart said.
Even if the Bookstore's course
reader market share were to fall
significantly, it would not have a
large financial impact on it. "We
have low margins on the readers,"
said Jef Friedel, the Bookstore's
events specialist. "It's really pro
vided as more of a service to stu
dents."
According to Rinehart, one of
the major advantages that the
Bookstore has is convenience.
Students "can get [readers] at the
same time as their textbooks," she
said.
Rinehart also said that the
Bookstore's experience in pro
ducing readers helps them in se
curing reprint permissions. "It's a
very involved process in
requesting permissions and pay
ing royalties. We've been doing it
for a long time and that makes it
easier for us," Rinehart said.
Castle, however, insists that such
connections are not necessary for
securing reprint permissions.
"Other than contacting the publish
er or a copyright clearinghouse, 1
don't see what connections you
would need," said Castle. "You can
even do it online at Copyright.com."
Rinehart questioned the ability
of outside sources to produce
course readers for significantly
less than the Bookstore does.
"Production is not a big part of
the reader costs. Permissions

are," said Rinehart. " The only
way they can [sell readers] for
much cheaper is if they are not
paying the royalties."
Castle said Field Copy and
Printing is careful to get permis
sion for every work they reprint,
and publication does not begin
until they have heard back from
all of the original publishers.
The Bookstore also has plans
to make it easier for instructors
to print their course readers
there. It is in the process of
developing a Web site where
professors will be able to order
readers and send bibliographical
information via the Internet to
speed the process of securing
permission to use various works
in their course readers.
" The printing is the part that
takes the shortest amount of
time," Friedel said.
