### MILLS SCHENCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Tlit* participants of (he Stan lord Islamic So
ciety's Panel on Terrorism urged (heir audi
ence to think of terrorism as a global problem
not related to the Islamic faith.
Wednesday's panel in Kresge Aulitorium,
which included Hoover fellows and a former
ambassador, convened as part of the Islamic
Society's Islam Awaremess Week. I lie week is
designed to promote cross-cultural under
standing and dispel negative stereoh pes aboui
Muslims at Stanford.
" The panel is important because (lie Muslim
community at Stanford obviously feels this is an
important issue that should be debated," said
Ebrahim Moosa, a visiting professor in the Re
ligious Studies Department and the moderator
of the panel discussion. "Muslims are often tar
nished by c harges of terrorism and violent e."
junior Mm ad Akhter, the Islam Awareness
Week coordinator, emphasized that "Islam

does not condone violence."
"This is often confused in the media and in
people's general perception of Muslims. The
stereotypes are as prevalent at Stanford as they
are oil 'campus," he said.
Kacli panelist addressed specific problems
related to international terrorism. Most lot used
on a specific region in the Muslim world.
Among the legions discussed were Chechnya,
Kashmir and Indonesia.
However, some common themes emerged.
Several panelists described the exploitation of
the* Islamic faith In terrorists who seek to mask
their political ambitions.
Salani Marayati, executive director of the
Muslim Public Affiiii s (onncil, spoke of this ex
ploitation as an "unholy relationship" between
Islam and certain governments that created "a
sense-ol paranoia lor Muslims everywhere."
I he panelists also discussed in detail the ori
gins of terrorism. Most of them identified
poveriv .ind political turmoil in many Muslim
counti ies as causes of terrorism.
Mai a) ati said (his turmoil was tooled in gov
ernmental problems in (lie Middle Kast and
Asia." I he problems fac ing the Middle Kast are
< oinplex and global in nature,' lie said.
I )i inald I in met son, a sen itÂ» fellow at the In
stitute loi International Studies, c ited Itidone

sia as an example of a country whose govern
ment had been able to tope with its diversity
and achieve relative peace without terrorism.
"Indonesia has the largest population of
Muslims in the world," Emmerson said. "Its
peace is rooted in its history."
Panelists also focused on the meaning of the
word jiluul, a term widely considered to mean a
holy war condoned by Muslims and thus seen as
partly responsible for the prevalence of terror
ism in the Middle East and Asia.
Emmerson argued that this connotation is
false and is an example of terrorists' exploita
tion of the Islamic faith to mask their political
ambitions.
Marayati also rejected the importance of the
jiluul as an explanation for world terrorism.
"The roots of terrorism in the Middle East are
illiteracy, poverty and tribal conflict," he said.
In addition to Emmerson and Marayati, the
panel included Prof. Thomas VV. Simons, a
I loover Fellow and former U.S. ambassador to
Pakistan, who discussed the ongoing conflict in
Afghanistan, and Prof. John B. Dunlop, a se
nior I loover Fellow, who spoke on the conflict
in (Ihechnya.
"All of our events have been going well,"
Akhter said. "We are helping to create a better
understanding 011 these issues."
