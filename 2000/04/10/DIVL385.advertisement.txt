Three out of four Stanford
students either do not drink
at all, or drink lightly. Some drink
moderately to party and relax.
Others are heavy drinkers, and
some may develop problems.
Here's information to help you
choose wisely.
Alcohol and Health
Small amounts of wine may
protect against heart disease, but
people who drink more are at
increased medical risk. Pro
longed, excessive use damages
the brain, liver and heart. We
recommend not drinking, or
drinking lightly.
Know Your Limit
Avoid alcohol if you are:
■ On certain medications (check
labels) or have health condi
tions (e.g., diabetes)
■ Aware of chemical depen
dency in your family, or are in
recovery
■ In need of full mental or physical
functioning (e.g., driving)
Alcohol effects differ for each
person and vary with circum
stances. Here are tips:
■ Consider your mood - drink
only in comfortable situations
■ Eat first - food slows absorption
■ Sip drinks - this allows you to
monitor the effect it's having
■ Learn to calculate your blood
alcohol content (BAC) - the
lower the BAC, the less risk of
problems
■ Avoid drinking games
■ Know how much pure alco
hol you're consuming (alco
hol content varies widely
from drink to drink)
■ Don't mix alcohol with medi
cines and other drugs (e.g.,

when the State of California forbad

a half of campus. Today three
quarters of Stanford students drink
lightly, or not at all.
marijuana)
■ Attention women: you may get
drunk more easily (the same
amount of alcohol results in a
higher BAC for you)
Tips for Party Hosts
■ Provide "EANABS" - Equally
Attractive Non-Alcoholic
Beverages
■ Serve food (starches are good;
avoid salty foods which make
you thirsty)
■ Have a completely sober host,
bartender and designated
driver so all your guests will be
safe
■ Do not serve alcohol during
the last hour of the party
Problems
A hangover is not your most
serious problem with alcohol.
At Stanford, 1 in 5 drinkers
experience:
■ Diminished academic per
formance
■ Regretted and unprotected sex
■ Accidents and injuries
■ Alcohol dependency
■ Trouble with the University
and police
Other students may find them
selves "baby sitting" drunks,
being insulted or assaulted, or
having their studies or sleep
disrupted.
Causes for Concern
■ Frequent/deliberate drink-ing
until intoxicated
■ Drinking as an immediate
reaction to a problem
■ Drinking and driving
■ Mood swings
■ Hanging out with heavy users
■ Feeling ill when drinking is
stopped
Too Much Alcohol
It takes about as many hours to
sober up as the number of drinks
you consume. For a hangover,
drink plenty of water (avoid coffee
- it's dehydrating). Advil can help;
avoid Tylenol and aspirin (they
irritate the liver and stomach).
Drinking too much alcohol can
kill you. Death most frequently
occurs by asphyxiation when
people inhale their own vomit.
Call 9-911 if a person has passed
out and can't be woken up.
Check frequently to make sure
the person can be awakened. Do
not leave someone alone to
"sleep it off."
Getting Help
CAPS (Counseling and Psycho
logical Services) counselors can
help you, or those you care about.
Call 723-3785. For more informa
tion on alcohol, call 723-3429.
Reminder
There can be legal consequences
for drinking under the age of 21,
and for what you do when
intoxicated (e.g., driving with a
BAC >0.08). Q
