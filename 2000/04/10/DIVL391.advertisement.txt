you sweaty masses..
Traditional IRAs: Income invested in
a traditional IRA ($2OOO max for indi
vidual, $ t.OOO per couple) is tax deduct
ible. More liberal rules for withdrawing
funds make this a good choice for those
who want to save on taxes now. With
drawn funds will be taxed according to
the tax bracket you are in at the time of
withdrawal
Roth IRA: Invest after-tax dollars in a
Roth IRA and earnings are tax-free.
Penalty-free too when withdrawn accord
ing to any of the following scenarios:
Funds are held for at least five years, AND
(1) you are at least age 59 1/2, or (2) you
become disabled, or (3) the funds will be
used for a first-time home purchase. Funds
can also be withdrawn after five vears for
education, however the funds will not
be tax-free il used for this purpose.
Education IRA: After tax dollars
are invested and earnings will be tax-
Irec il used to pay tor qualified higher
education expenses.The maximum
contribution is $500 per dependent
child per year Both parents and
grandparents can take advantage of
education IRAs if the combined
income is less than $ 150,000 or filing
singly, the income is less than $95,000.
(>ot all that? He sure to consult your
tax advisor (since I'm just some schmo
who likes to tell people what to do) to
see which IRA is best for you.
Most importantly, check the IRA
options at SFCU.
