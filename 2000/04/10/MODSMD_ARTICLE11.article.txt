### PATRICK C. CROSETTO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I he weekend began with a performance of a vagi
na monologue, a guitar song on female empower
ment through baseball, a flute song dedicated to one
woman's mother and folk songs about another
woman's sexual identity.
These performances, by psychology doctoral stu
dent Julie McCuire, sophomore Meredith King, se
nior Camellia Rodriguez and senioi Diet In? Blake
marked the beginning of the Women's Leadership
Conference, held this past weekend at the Women's
Center and Bechtel International Center.
l he Women's Leadership (Conference is an annu
al event organized by members of the Women's Cen
ter staff with the purpose of developing leadership
skills for Stanford women. I "his year's theme was
"leading through empowering."
In her opening speech Saturday morning, the
head of the conference's planning committee, senior
Wallace Adelman, explained that "so often women
are expected to follow role models that aren't women.
We will provide skill-building workshops aimed at ad
dressing those skills specific to women.''
I lie weekend included a mixture of speeches and
skill workshops in small group settings.
I he number of people who attended the week
end's events varied from 10 to !i(). Although most of
the participants were female, some of the events had

as many as four male attendees.
Senior Margaret Duden, the president of tlie
Women's Coalition, said she felt it was important that
the Women's (Center has events like the conference to
pull campus women together.
"Not enough stuff like this gets done here at Stan
ford," she said. "There are a lot of women's groups on
campus, but there is still a need for more outlets for
women."
Adelman and a staff of six others, including junior
lolake Oguntebi, organized the event. Oguntebi said
she got involved with the group because, "1 haven't
had a lot of involvement with the Women's Center in
the past, and I just recently got into women's issues."
I he event began on Friday night with a dinner and
performances by a number of campus women. 1 hen
Kathleen Lankasky, an activist for people with dis
abilities, gave a speech on overcoming barriers.
Lankasky was born with cerebral palsy, but was
able to overcome the malady thanks to the "can-do"
attitude adopted by her parents and herself.
Lankasky eventually went to Yale University and
graduated Magna (aim Laude.
I'lie conference reconvened the next morning in
Bechtel, and the skill-building seminars began with a
presentation on public speaking by interim Women's
Center Direc tor Lauren I'opell, a former college de
bate champion.
I'opell had every person at the conference deliver
two short speec lies and critiqued each one. She made
general suggestions to the participants about dressing
comfortably, hiding nervousness and avoiding awk
ward physic al movements to help improve their pub-
lie speaking skills.
Nadinne Cruz, interim director
of the Haas Center for Public Ser
vice, gave the next presentation,
on service learning and activism.
In her speech, she revealed that
her connection to activism dates
back to witnessing her father's
brutal murder by a hitman or
dered by the Filipino government
when she was only four years old.
"Leadership is not about being
the best scholar," Cruz told the au
dience. "It's about being able to
cross many borderlands and feel
comfortable."
During lunch, Donna Wood
Ciraves, an investment banking ex
pert, gave a speech on investment
tips for women, emphasizing the
need to buy quality and hold onto
it through the ups and downs of
the market.
After lunch, Rabbi Patricia kar
lin-Neumann and Lutheran Min
ister Kelly Denton-Borhaug, both

associate deans of religious lite,
gave a talk on introspection, en
couraging the women to look into
themselves and question what
mattered to them and why.
"It was mind-opening in terms
of just thinking about issues you
never really get a chance to think
about here at Stanford," said
sophomore Shirley Delaleu, a
member of the Women's Center
staff. "A lot of the attendees wished
that they could have more oppor
tunities to talk about things like
that in a group setting."
The day ended with a discus
sion lead by Tina Gridiron, a doc
toral student in the School of Edu
cation. Gridiron helped the
women to discuss the processes of
becoming a woman on Stanford's
campus.
Though those that did attend
said they got a lot out of the con
ference, the large majority of Stan
ford's female population on cam
pus did not attend.
Nonetheless, maintained Adel
man, it was the quality of the expe
rience, not the quantity of atten
dees, that mattered.
