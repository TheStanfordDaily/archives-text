# Internet education for alums?
## University may join with Princeton, Yale for distance-learning program 
### EILEEN CHAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford, Princeton and Yale are currently in the
midst of discussing the development of a joint dis
tance-learning program for alumni. According to
Vice Provost for Institutional Planning Geoffrey
Cox, the three universities plan to pool their re
sources to make educational materials in the arts
and sciences, such as courses and intellectual discus
sions, available through the Internet.
"We began to think whether it would be advanta
geous to work with other universities [in providing
distance learning]," Cox said. "We concluded that
maybe some interesting things could come out of
[this collaboration]."
So far ideas are still "really in the talking stage
with Princeton and Yale," Cox said. He added that
no programs have been created yet.
"[We wanted to start the program for] two rea
sons: examine the possibility of providing high-qual
ity educational material to our alumni and to get
more experience in the use of technology for teach
ing and learning," Provost John Hennessy said.
Issues such as funding, which professors will be
involved and exactly what materials will be offered
have not been determined. According to Hennessy,
the program will begin "probably in sometime in the
fall - slowly at first."
"The discussions have included consideration of
some form of joint effort among our institutions,"
the schools said in a statement. "As we continue to
meet, we will be consulting widely with our faculty
members, administrators and trustees on each
campus before undertaking any collaborative pro
jects."
Materials offered on the Web will be in the arts
and sciences departments, and not from any profes
sional schools. Although some complete courses may
be offered, Cox said that officials were "thinking
about non-credit." The budget and funding for this

program have not been finalized.
Alumni Association President Bill Stone is very
enthusiastic about the prospect of the program.
"This program is a very exciting thing for alumni.
It broadens our capacity to offer to an audience
who's very excited to stay in touch with their school,
Stone said. "We allow them [to learn] in the time and
place most convenient for their individual lives.
Stone said he believes that these distance learning
programs can be very successful and cited a religious
studies seminar that Religious Studies Prof. Bob
Gregg taught this past winter. Regular students
went to lectures while alumni signed on and ob
tained materials and notes from the Web. I he class
ended with a trip to Israel during spring break.
" This class was an interesting model [for distance
learning]," Gregg said. "It shows what technology
can do to reach beyond the campus. It creates a great
deal of richness for graduates."
Not everyone is wholly optimistic about the joint
alliance in distance learning.
" The real question is what they can deliver," said
Janet K. Poley, president of the American Distance
Education Consortium, in a Harvard Crimson arti
cle. Cornell University, Pennsylvania State Universi
ty and Rutgers University are some of the universi
ties affiliated with ADEC. According to Poley, any
school will offer distance learning to those who are
willing to pay for it.
Harvard decided not to participate in the joint al
liance because its Dean, Harry Lewis, believed it
would detract from the teaching resources dedicat
ed to undergraduate education.
"I am not against these ideas - if we approach
them analytically in terms of the deployment of our
resources," Lewis said in the Harvard Crimson. "1
haven't heard anyone say lately that the undergrad
uate college which is our core business has a surplus
of faculty time unused by our undergraduates, so 1
am very cautious about exciting ideas for other ways
<nn faculty could be spending their time."
Cox, however, assures that the program will not
have a negative effect on current Stanford students.
"We wouldn't do anything to undermine the un
dergraduate education," Cox said. " That is always
our first priority."
