# Students face global challenge
## International startups to compete this summer for $250K 
### ELISABETH PRESSER 
Entrepreneurship organizations from five conti
nents will send about 200 representatives to Stanford
this June for the Global Entrepreneurship Challenge.
Contestants in the week-long event will have the
chance to win $250,000 in prizes, according to student
organizers for the event.
Several local venture capital firms are sponsoring
the challenge, including Accel Partners, Mohr, David
ow Ventures and Silicon V alley Networks Project.
The older, more established firms are interested in
"nurturing" younger companies, according to Ed
ward Ac worth, a doctoral student in mechanical engi
neering and one of the conference's organizers.
"The event is being held mostly to get these peo pie
in front of the venture capitalists," said Robert Kotur
bash, a master's student in electrical engineering also
helping with the event.
Along with Stanford's own Business Association of
Stanford Engineering Students, organizations from
universities located in Hong Kong, Beijing, Mexico,

Singapore, Spain, Cambridge and elsewhere will send
the winners of their own entrepreneurship competi
tions to Stanford.
"We've been combing the world for the best orga
nizations to invite," Ac worth said.
The conference will be the most costly student-or
ganized event ever to take place at Stanford, accord
ing to Acworth.
The event is the brainchild of Acworth and fresh
man Travis Tan . The two met at an information ses
sion for BASES in the fall. After talking with other
BASES members, Acworth said they produced their
"vision statement" and realized that the conference
was "worth devoting a great amount of energy and re
sources."
The motivation for the conference, said its orga
nizers, is to provide opportunities for networking and
education to new companies that may not otherwise
have access to the knowledge and experience available
in Silicon Valley.
"Entrepreneurship is a wonderful engine of [eco
nomic] growth," Acworth said. "We feel a social re
sponsibility to extend this model worldwide."
Koturhash believes that increasing global competi
tiveness a benefit to all.
"The feedback we've gotten so far is that this is a
fantastic idea," he said.
