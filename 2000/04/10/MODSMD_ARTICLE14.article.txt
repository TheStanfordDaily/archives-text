## Nineteen U.S. Marines killed when aircraft crashes 
### 
MARANA, Ariz. (AP) — A Marine Corps aircraft
attempting to land din ing a nighttime training mis
sion crashed Saturday night and burst into flames,
killing all 19 aboard and adding to a checkered his
tory for a new breed of hybrid plane that can take off
and land like a helicopter.
Ihe MV-22 tilt rotor Osprey, which looks like a
turboprop, is part of a new generation of aircraft
scheduled to eventually replace all of the Marines'
primary troop-transport helicopters. The military
began flying the aircraft six months ago.
A Pentagon spokesman said the names of the
Marines killed in the crash — 15 passengers and four
crew members — would not be released until their
families were notified, which could take until today.
The four crew members were from a task force
headquartered in Quantico, Va.. and the 15 passen
gers were from 3rd Battalion, 3th Marines based at
Camp lVndleton, Calif., according to the Pentagon.
Yesterday, investigators were reviewing the crash
site at Marana Northwest Regional Airport west of
Tucson. Pew details were released.
Carol Ward, who lives about five miles from the
airport, said she watched the plane fly by from her
porch. It disappeared behind a mountain and a few
second later "I saw the smoke and this big old pool."
she said.
I lie dust from the crash "just eliminated the sky,"
she said.
A heap of twisted, c harred metal was visible at the
scene and aerial footage showed a large blackened
patch on the airport grounds.
Military officials said the downed aircraft had
been attempting to land at the airport when it

crashed. It was one of two Ospreys simulating the
evacuation of civilians.
Firefighters said witnesses reported seeing the
plane head straight clown and become engulfed in
flames after it crashed.
"Our sympathies go out to the families of these
Marines," said Marine Ft. Mark Carter, a spokesman
for the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma, where the
flight originated.
President Clinton called the units' commanding
officers and asked tlieni to "pass condolences to the
families and tell them of the importance of their ser
vice," White House press secretary Joe Lockhart
said.
1 lie crash is again raising questions about the
safety of the aircraft that has been over a decade in
the making.
Former President Bush's administration tried to
scuttle the project after early safety concerns, but
builders sav modifications from the original design
make today's Ospreys lighter and safer.
I he Marine Corps lists two other Osprey crashes,
both early in the aircraft's development: One, in
1991 in Delaware, was blamed on gyro wiring prob
lems; and the other, in 1992 in Virginia, killed all
seven people on board after an engine caught fire.
Jointly produced by Bell Helicopter Textron of
Fort Worth, Texas, and Boeing Co., in Ridley Park,
Pa., the ()sprey can achieve speeds of more than 400
niph and an altitude of 25,000 feet. It is designed to
carry up to 24 troops or external loads of 15,000
pounds.
I he hybrid airc raft flies at twice the speed, has
twice the range and carries twice the payloacl of the

Vietnam-era CH-40 helicopters it is expected to
replace. I he Marines have ordered 360 Ospreys to
be delivered by 2014 at a cost of $44 million each,
said Capt. Rob Winchester, a Pentagon spokesman.

Military planners see the aircraft as a means of
getting more U.S. troops and pilots safely out of dan
ger zones and enhancing drug interdiction, human
itarian and civilian rescue capabilities.
