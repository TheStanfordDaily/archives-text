RIYADI I, Saudi Arabia (AP) — The United
States, which has come under criticism for
maintaining military forces in Saudi Arabia
nine years alter the Gulf War, is moving some
of its 4,000 airmen out of the desert kingdom,
a U.S. military official said yesterday.
It was not immediately clear if the change
was linked to a growing unease in the Saudi
government about hosting U.S. troops,
besides Saudi Arabia, other C lull states such as
Kuwait have been criticized by their own peo
ple and by oilier Middle Eastern nations for
hosting U.S. military bases.
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, who
is on a regional tour, discussed the logistics of
the move with American commanders at the
Prince Sultan Air Base in the Saudi desert, said
the official, who is based in Saudi Arabia and
spoke on condition of anonymity.
fhe official did not say how many airmen
will be moved or when. Both countries made
the decision, the official said, adding that the
details had yet to be discussed.

Besides the 4,000 airmen, there are anoth
er 1,000 U.S. troops based in Saudi Arabia.
In 1996, then-U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry said the United States intended
to move between 3,000 and 4,000 troops sta
tioned in Saudi Arabia for monitoring the "no
fly zone" over Iraq. But it was never publicly
announced that such a movement actually
took place.
The latest troops move, however, is not like
lv to whittle the strong military commerce
between the I nited States and the region,
which owns mostK I'.S.-made weapons. In
1998, Saudi Arabia was the number one buver
of U.S. arms in the region, with 52.7 billion in
new sales.
Cohen met with Saudi King Eahd, Defense
Minister Prince Sultan and other senior offi
cials in the Red Sea port citv of Jiddah later
yesterday. Cohen and Sultan discussed the
planned downsizing of the U.S. force and a
$504 million deal for the sale of more than a
dozen E-15 fighters to Saudi Arabia to replace

older ones, a Western diplomatic source said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
1 lie presence of troops and bases is critical
for the United States in the oil-rich Cull
region, which also plays host to large U.S.
investments.
I lie presence also is a response to a per
ceived military threat to the region from Iraq
and Iran.
During a stop in Qatar earlier in the week,
Cohen discussed the possibility of using a base
there for an air expeditionary unit that could
help defend the area in a military crisis.
He implied that some U.S. forces could be
transferred there from elsewhere in the
region.
"We have had discussions in Qatar about
the possibility of using a base in times of crisis
for an air expeditionary type of unit so that we
could in fact have access to help defend the
area in times of militarv c risis. But we have not
talked about any expansions in the region,"
Cohen said.
