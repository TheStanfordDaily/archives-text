# Vijay Singh captures the green jacket
## 
### 
AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — No
one ever came farther to get a
green jacket than Vijay Singh.
I lie final leg was an uphill
climb to the 18th green yesterday
at Augusta National, where
Singh completed his troublesome
journey around the world to
claim the most prestigious prize
in golf.
He won the Masters by meet
ing every challenge from the
biggest stars in (lie game, ( losing
with a 3-under 09 for a three
stroke victory over Krnie 1 Is.
Singh rolled in an 18-foot
birdie putt on the last hole,
kissed the ball as he removed it
from the cup and embraced his
family. His 9-year-old son,
taped a message to his bag that
said, "Poppa, Trust Your
Swing."
He did, following those direc
tions better than anyone else.
Singh ignored an early ( barge
by I'iger Woods, and watched
David Duval self-destruct.
At .H7, he has now won two of
the last six major championships,
which validates him as one of the
game's top players.
Once a teaching pro in the
jungle of Borneo, Singh played
tours on five continents and was
banned from two of them, one
for a cheating allegation that he
has long denied but has haunted
him throughout his career.
Singh, who won the PGA
Championship at Sahalee in

1998, plaved with composure in
the face of many challengers.
And that might be enough to
finally shift the attention to a
game that weathered «i wicked
weekend at Augusta.
I le finished at 278 and earned
$828,000 for what was his eighth
career victory.
Kls, a two-time l .S. Open
champion, couldn't get a birdie
putt to fall on the last three holes
and was at 281.
I he biggest threat came from
Duval, in contention on the back
nine yesterday at Augusta for the
third straight year.
Mis dreams died with a risky
shot that wound up in Rae's
('.reek, a bogey on the par-.") I .'sth.
A bogey on the final hole gave
Duval a 70, and he finished in a
lie for third with Loren Roberts.
Woods, trying to pull off the
greatest IHi-hole comeback in
Masters history, got to within
three of the lead but played even
par on the back and finished
fifth, six strokes back.
Singh set the tone for his vic
tory yesterday morning. With
frost melting into dew, he
returned to the course to com
plete his third round and made
two critical par putts that enabled
him to maintain his three-stroke
cushion over Duval.
That paid dividends on the
back nine yesterday, w hen Singh
managed to escape danger twice
without losing his lead.
