### 
LIMA. Peru (AP) — In elec
tions overshadowed by allega
tions of fraud, Peruvians voted
yesterday 011 whether to give
iron-handed President Alberto
Fujimori a controversial third
five-year term.
Fujimori, 61, popular for
years for having crushed leftist
insurgencies and ending eco
nomic chaos, was fighting for
his political life against 54-
year-old Alejandro 1 oledo, a
U.S.-trained economist.
Moments after the voting
ended yesterday afternoon, an
exit poll bv the independent
polling firm Apoyo gave Tole
do 45.2 percent of the votes to
Fujimori's 43.6 percent. The
rest of the vote was split
between other candidates.
Hut the poll did not take
into account isolated rural
areas not accessible by road,
where Fujimori is expected to
be strong.
If the numbers hold up it
would mean a runoff will be
necessary, since a candidate
needs to obtain more than 50
percent of valid votes to win
outright.
Apoyo director Alfredo For
res said the exit poll figures
were based on interviews with
35,000 voters from 3.500 vot
ing tables in 70 provinces
around the country.
I here were more than
SO,OOO Noting tables in all. For
res said the margin of error
was 5 percentage points.
Apoyo's exit polls have
proved highly accurate in p.isi
elections.
But Forres said last week
llicy would not include sam
ples from the remote rural
areas where 10 to 15 percent of
the voters live.
I oledo, who grew up in
poverty, has capitalized on the
country's deep two-year reces
sion and high unemployment
to cut into Fujimori's support
among the poor.
"People don't know much
about him, but we know who
we're not supporting. He is
sure to be better than Fuji
mori,'' Fduardo Vasquez, 24,
one of Peru's many unem
ployed, said after voting at a
school set amid shack-covered

desert hills on Lima's southern
outskirts.
But Fujimori still enjoys
widespread support and had a
'lead of 6 to 7 percentage points
in several public opinion sur
veys going into the election.
"He has done so much that
appeared impossible," said
Antero Pasos, a 72-year-old
retired auto mechanic who
voted at the same school as
Vasquez. "No other govern
ments have accomplished what
he did. Now we have roads,
electricity, health care."
Fujimori, who says he has
proven to Peruvians that he
keeps his promises, had
appeared on his way to an eas\
victory, but in recent weeks
Toledo bolted from a pack of
eight opposition candidates
and was breathing down Fuji
mori's neck.
At a breakfast meeting with
reporters before voting, Fuji
mori defended the cleanliness
of the elections and said warn
ings from international moni
tors did not bother him.
"We pay no heed to threats
from other countries." he said.
" I he possibility of fraud does
not exist."
Before leaving his house to
vote, Toledo called the cam
paign "tremendoush unfair"
and "dirty" but reminded
Peruvians that the voting pro
cess is secret.
He said he was going to
await the election results out
side the Palace of Justice and
hoped there would be "justice
for the will of the women and
men of Peru."
International election moni
tors are upset with Fujimori's
blatant attempts to manipulate
yesterdav's vote to guarantee
his re-election.
Critics accused Fujimori
and Ins allies in military intelli
gence of a systematic, illegal
campaign financed by public
funds to discredit and intimi
date leading opposition candi
dates.
More than 14 million Peru
vians were registered to vote.
