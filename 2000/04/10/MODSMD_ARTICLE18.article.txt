## The 						Stanford Daily Campus to feel loss of American Studies House 
### 
Published Since JS9I

In the last year, the Committee on
Undergraduate Education
reviewed all academic theme hous
es in light of concerns that those
houses lacked academic rigor.
The committee determined that,
according to guidelines recently set by
a sub-committee for residential educa
tion, the American Studies House did
not meet the criteria for an academic
theme house. It was the only house to
lose its academic theme status.
An important contributing factor to
this decision was the continued detach
ment that the American Studies
Department has shown towards the
house.

According to Russell Fernald, chair
of the committee, the American Studies
Department was the only one that did
not respond to correspondence
regarding the academic theme house
review.
All of the other departments contact
ed in regard to the academic theme
houses gave the stipulation that theme
houses should include an academic
component. American Studies students
have also not been sufficiently motivat
ed to live in Am Stud. Currently, there
is only one American Studies major liv
ing in the house.
The hope from the committee was
that Am Stud could, in the future,

become a focus house. Focus houses
differ from academic theme houses in
that focus houses do not have manda
tory events or integrate academic
requirements.
Academic theme houses, therefore,
are designed to provide an environ
ment for more in-depth learning of an
area of academic interest, while focus
houses do not necessarily provide pro
gramming to that effect.
The lack of interest shown by both
the American Studies Department and
its students has deprived the campus
community of this valuable theme
house. Am Stud could have benefitted
from support in programming from

both professors and students.
The responsibility to encourage
American Studies majors to live in the
house and to actively support house
programming lies with the department.
Through the house, knowledge of this
interdisciplinary major can spread.
The American Studies Department
should moticate its students and inspire
more interest in the field. Ihe estab
lishment of the American Studies house
was the perfect opportunity to begin
that process.
Unfortunately, as the house will
revert to its original name of Murray
House, this is one more example of a
missed opportunity.
