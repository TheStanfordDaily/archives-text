# WHAT THE HECK I'M TALKING ABOUT
## Life without cars 
### 
Poor, poor incoming freshmen.
No parking permit's for you! No
driving home on the weekends!
Need a break from your pesky
roommate? A long drive down Alpine
Road pel haps? Tough luck!
Starting next year, Stanford Irosh
are going to have to leave their tars ;tt
home, unless they want to pay the
"unofficial" permit price of $25 .1 day
for parking tickets. (Lan you imagine

lilt' at Stanford with
out access to a car? ()i
worse yet, maybe you
can. Maybe you, like
me, can painfully
ret ail the days before
you had wheels or a
friend itli heels. I
am sure this memory
can only evoke fur
ther sympathy for the

little pedestrian newbics who will come
to the farm in Septembei with nothing
but their walkin' shoes and a bike.
I he Daily article on Friday ("Frosh
car plan unveiled") noted that H5 per
cent of Stanford freshmen come in
with cars and by June, that rate is up to
50 percent.
Doesn't that prove some sort of
learning curve? Doesn't that mean hav
ing access to a car as a freshman is pret
ty darn important? Doesn't it say some
where in the Kill of Rights, "the right
to own and park your car someplace?"
Facilities Operations is hoping that
freshmen will be so wrapped up iu
their on-campus experience that they
won't "notice" that they have no car.
You've got to admit it's an interesting
theory.
Correct me if I'm wrong in thinking
that college isn't meant to be like one,
long, sleep-away camp. And don't
Stanford kids seem to have enough
trouble getting out of the "bubble"
already?
At least the Marguerite will have
more stops, like the Menlo Park Safe
way. I hank goodness for Safeway, the
only thing in the I ri-Valley area that's
open past I I p.m., besides Denny's and
I iappy Donuts.
I'his new stop seems like just one
more way to assure students of gaining
that nasty freshman 15.
I mean, raise your hand if you've
even eaten an entile loaf of Safeway
Irene h bread by yourself because you
lived in Wilbur and you were up until
3:00 a.m. and you were starving, and
someone was going to Safeway, so you
bought a loaf of bread and ate it all.

Okay, so maybe that was just me. And
yes, I suppose I could have purchased
carrot sticks.
But there is definitely something to
he said about getting off campus at
night for a coffee break or a late-night
snack (or dinner in the city ... 1 could
go on for hours). Kspecially during
finals week. Usually, by then, I've had
my lill of every potential study spot on
campus. And what il 1 don't want to
drink Starbucks coffee at the Coffee
House? Whatever happened to con
sumer's choice?
And then there are the kids who live
within an hour or two of their house. II
they want to go home for the weekend
for a little free laundry or home
cooked food, their parents are going i<>
have to come and pick them up. And il
tlicit parents are anything like my par
ents, they'd probably rather fedKx
(heir kids some lupperwared lasagna
than make a three or four-hour drive
twice in one weekend. (Just kidding,
Mom!)
Someone mentioned that the park
ing permit restriction would be a good
way to forge friendships between the
incoming freshmen and upperclass
inen with cars. I'm not so sure that the
juniors and seniors in four-class dorms,
already bitter about their bad luck with
the Draw, will give a very cheerful
reception to a freshman knocking at
their doors asking for a ride.
11 you are one of the kind souls who
would oiler to shuttle the freshmen
around in such fashion, then you
deserve a firm handshake and a pat on
the back. But I believe you might be in
the minority.
I'm sure that there are several peo
ple who can attest to a wonderful fresh
man year in which they hardly stepped
foot out of their dorm, let alone the
campus. But I do think that some peo
ple need a little time away to think.
Whether that means watching the
sun set on the shore of a beach in Half
Moon Bay or watching it sink behind
the 1 ransAmerica building on a night
in the c ity, it's a way of getting some
perspective of the outside world again.
We should be making that easier, not
harder, for students to obtain. Not to
mention that if they want carrot sticks
or Safeway bread at 4 a.m., they should
be able to get them.
