# Med Center gets grant
## NIH gives $9M grant to collect genedrug data, maintain database on patient response to medications 
### CHRIS DRAKE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The National Institutes of Health has awarded
Sta nfbrd Medical Center a $9 million grant over the
ne> ;t live years to establish a national pharmacogenet
ics c latabase. The database, known as the l'hannaco
genitics Knowledge Base, or PharmCKß, will contain
infbinnation gathered from around the country and
will Sierve as a resource tor medical researchers seek
ing k > improve patient treatment.
Ah hough Stanford will house the database, none of
the (1; ita will be collected here. Instead, sites around
the co untry will gather various types of data based on
differe nt types of research.

sity Medical Center, UCSF,
UCLA, Vale University, the Uni
versity of Chicago, the University
(>f Houston Law Center, Brigham
frnd Women's Hospital in Boston,
and the Mayo Foundation in
Rochester, Minn, will soon begin
10 pour into Stanford's database.
\ Russ B. Altman, associate pro
fessor of medicine of the Stanford
Informatics Laboratory
and the principal investigator for
Stanford's new database, provided
$ome insight into what the re
search will entail.
"Pharmacogenetics is the study
of how variations in the genes of
people [mirror] variations of
[their] responses to drugs," Alt
man said. "The exciting thing for
us [is that the data will range] 112 rom
DNA and DNA sequences to clini
cal data for patients," he said.
Altman noted that Stanford's
NIH grant has two components.

The first, which Alt man termed
the "service component," will en
able Stanford to "provide data to
the public [and] offer help." The
second, the "research compo
nent," will enable the Stanford
group participating in the study
"to [make] new discoveries our
selves," Alt man said.
The primary purpose of the
database will be to help re
searchers "link people's genetic
makeup to how [they] respond to
medicines," said Michael Rogers,
division director for the Pharma
cology, Physiology and biological
Chemistry Division of the Nation
al Institute of General Medical
Sciences for the NIH. "We were
interested in the fact that differ
ent individuals can respond dif
ferently to the same medicine," he
said.
The data will allow doctors to
find the best medicines and most
effective doses of these medicines,
Rogers said.
Alt man noted that although
certain drugs or certain doses of
drugs may act differently upon dif
ferent people, 99.9 percent of

human genes are the same. I he
remaining 0.1 percent represents
all the variations in human genetic
makeup.
Researchers will eventually use
the data to "individualize the
drugs [administered]," Altman
said. All in all, efforts will be made
to ensure that, with any kind or
dosage of medication, "side ellec ts
go down [and] efficacy goes up,"
lie saicl.
"[1 he] Stanford group's role is
to organize the database so that
people can query it and ... look
for relationships among the data
they might find," Rogers said.
" The exact [method] of how the
data will be collected has yet to be
determined."
I lowever, he added, "generally,
[the collections) will include se
quences of genes [and] patient out
conies put together."
Altman noted that he and the
other PharmGKß creators must
be ethically scrupulous "because
we're involved in studying individ
ual variations and responses."
While patients must give prior
consent to having their data en

tered into the PharmGKß, the
group wants to ensure that there is
"no way anyone's privacy or confi
dentiality will be violated," Altman
said.
"One issue that comes up with
this kind of information is . . . can
you infer who [the patients] are
[based on the data]," said Mildred
Clio, a senior research scholar at
t lie Stanford Center for Biomed
ical Kthics. Since the PharmGKß
h.is vet to be fully established, the
database's creators are still decid
ing how widely available the data
will be.
1 lie NIII steering committee
that will ultimately determine how
the data will be presented and who
gets to use them will seek to "mini
mize identification potential and
limit access to the database," Clio
said.
Altman said that the Phar
mGKß started April 1; the accre
tion of data will take place over the
next six months to a year. Re
searchers will soon have "many,
many gigabytes" worth of pharma
cogenetic data at their disposal, lie
said.
