Bursting the Stanford bubble
While I understand people's objec
tions to Oni Kundu's latest column, 1
believe that they are simply sweeping his
message under the rugvia rhetoric and
ignoring the truth. Kundu's statements
warning President Hennessy of I he prob
lems tbiii he is forced to deal with on a
day-to-day basis are very real.
We live in a Stanford bubble seeming
ly free of human suffering, yet there is
suffering that occurs here daily that
Kuiidu had the courage to reveal. Dis
crimination oc curs at Stanford every day,
whether it be subtle prejudice of a
"K. 0.8." or a minimal wage given to a
dining serviceworker.
Is Stanford unique in this aspect? No.
Stanford is no worse than any other insti
tution of its magnitude in the U.S. I low
ever. we are one of the leading institu
tions on the West Coast, and thus we
should do just that: lead.
Kundu's points are valid. Why not
lead the way by instituting even one Stan
ford in Africa program? Judging by our
sizeable endowment, fiscal issues cannot
be any sort of hinderance to such an
undertaking.
But Stanford in Africa is simply a detail
of Kundu's thesis. I le wants people to put

a stop to the subtle (and often not-so sub
tle) discriminations he sees every day,
whether it be on an administrative level, an
individual level or anything in between.
The Stanford community seems to get
outraged when a sorority obtains another
house or when the Sixth Man Club does
something outrageous. What Kundu is
arguing against is much more serious
than a sorority or a bawdy Sixth Man
chant. Why then can't we treat his argu
ment with the same seriousness?
