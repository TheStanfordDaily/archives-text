### VALENTINE DING CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last Monday night's lecture by literary
theorist Wolfgang Iser marked the end of
the first phase of the series of Stanford
Presidential Lectures and Symposia in the
Humanities and Arts. With a renewed
grant from the President's Office, the lec
ture and symposium series is expected to
resume under new leadership in the next
school year.
[ he two-year lecture and symposium
program was announced in fall, 1997 din -
ing the State of the University Address by
President Gerhard Casper. Along with a
$12 million initiative to add four professor
ships to humanities departments, the series
represented the president's efforts to
strengthen the humanities at Stanford.
Hie program began in March 1998.
Conceived to encourage discourse between
the humanities and other disciplines like
social sciences and engineering, the Presi
dential Lectures have invited to campus
such prominent scholars as paleontologist
Stephen Jay Gould, philosopher Jacques
Derrida and exiled poet Bei l)ao. World
Chess Champion Garry Kasparov also
gave .i speech in a special event during one
of the Presidential Symposia.

"We have had very good turnouts. Most
of them came for an enlightening lecture,"
said Hans Gumbrecht, professor of Com
parative Literature and director of the just
completed series.
Now, after 20 lectures and four sym
posia, tht' program has exhausted its origi
nal funding, which came directly from the
President's Of lice. Last month, Casper
provided a new grant for three more years
of lectures and symposia.
The renewed program will be under the
supervision of the Humanities Center, with
a new director Jo select guest lecturers and
coordinate the process. In the previous
years, the Stanford faculty and the student
body were polled concerning their prefer
ences for speakers. Among the 400 individ
uals indicated in the returned polls, Gum
brecht and Casper selected the final 20-
odd speakers.
" The format and rhythm [of next year's
lectures] will basically stay the same," said
(iumbrecht, "although it might have a dif
ferent intellectual style," Gumbrecht said.
I he series already has a pool of potential
presenters to work with for next year.
"Humanists are always controversial,"
Gumbrecht said. "Although we selected
these people [who gave the lectures] based
on their popularity among ibe students,
they are also the people I like and admire.
In the future, a new director will certainly
have a new taste."
Many students responded positively to
the lecture series.
"Kasparov's talk was pretty cool," said
junior Jim Mender, "you can tell [because]
the room was all packed."
