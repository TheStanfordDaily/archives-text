### BEN ALEXANDER-BLOCH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hillel, a Jewish student organization,
will send HO Stanford students to Israel for
10 days this June thanks to funding from
the Israel Birthright Foundation.
I his is the first time that Hillel has of
fered such a program, designed for Stan
lord students who have never been to Is
rael on a peer group trip.
" I his Hillel trip is a powerful way for
students to study their historical, cultural
and religious heritage. Students will make
new friends and explore their identity in a
comfortable environment," said Debra
Feldstein, executive director of Staniovd's
Hillel Foundation.
This week, Hillel will decide which HO
Stanford students, out of the 140 who ap
plied and were interviewed, will make the
trip to Israel.
According to Rabbi Noa Kushner, 1 fil
lers education and programming director,
most large universities don't receive
enough funding from the Birthright Foun
dation to send as many students to Israel as
Stanford will this year. She said Birthright
is interested in strengthening Stanford's
Jewish community.
Birthright is sponsoring the trip fen Jew
ish students from ages 15 to 20. Hillel is
looking to have a diversified pool of Stan

ford's Jewish community participate. Offi
cials said they want a mixture of observant
and nonobservant Jews to attend, as well as
an even mix of ages and sexes.
"We're looking for a balance of people
who are open to exploring their heritage
and have previously not been that close to
Judaism. Hillel and Birthright have a vi
sion for Jewish youth and Jewish renais
sance," Kushner said.
Students admitted to the program will
explore the city of Jerusalem, hike through
I lie Galilee region, enjoy Tel Aviv's
nightlife, swim in the Dead Sea, climb
Masada and meet with Israeli students,
business and political leaders, all while
learning about Israel and their own Jewish
identity.
Junior Michal Pasternak, who was born
in Isreal, said "For me, the most important
pan of a visii to Israel is being immersed in
the secular culture that was born of a strong
religious base."
"There is not one specific goal for this
trip, but it will be a chance for Stanford stu
dents to have a completely different expe
rience, meet many new people, and open
up many new doors," she said.
Future 1 lillel projects may include simi
lar trips over winter and spring break.
Birthright offered a winter trip this year,
but Stanford could not participate because
winter quarter classes began while the trip
was taking place.
