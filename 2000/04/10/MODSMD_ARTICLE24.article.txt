# RCC position fails to attract enough female applicants
## Amid concern about lack of women RCCs, ResComp staff and students look at explanations for failure of outreach programs 
### EILEEN CHAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Few females apph for the position of resident computer con
sultant, resulting in a noticeable gender gap that lias many stu
dents and stuff'concerned.
Despite increased outreach efforts by the University, this
year's applicant pool for RC( Is — as in past years — is likely to be
predominantly male.
"I fistorically, applicants are dominant!) male despite recruit
ment in the Women's Center," said Jamey Frank, RCC supervi
sor and recruiter for the past four years.
An RCC resides in the dorm, helping students with technical
questions such as computer in-room connections and general
computer problems. According to Frank, 7f> percent to 90 per
cent of R(>Cs in the past were male, despite advertising eflbrts fo
cusing on the female community.
"We contacted all the RFs, [who] encouraged female residents
to apply," he said. "We also try to do panels with the Society ol
Women Fngineers. But the best we had was 30 percent female."
Students point to several reasons for this gender disparity.
Sophomore Julie Leu liner, who is applying to be an RC Xl, says it
could be due to societal views.
"Perhaps it's just because culturally, 1 think guys are expected
to be computer literate more than girls, so they make a point to at
least familiarize themselves with them," Letchner said. "[Also],
girls may tend to be drawn toward more humanist-seeming roles
like that of an RA, so fewer females apply to be RCC."
l he long-standing trend of male majority could also send an
unconscious message to the public, according to sophomore R(,
applicant Frikka limes.
"The sex difference is noticeable, and I think people tend to
tack 011 to that," limes said. "It has the potential to be intimidat

ing, I think. If a male asks a question during the training session
[CSI96], it's no big deal. It could be a brilliant question, it could
be stupid, but it's just a question when he asks because the ma
jority of the room is also male. As a female, it's a little tougher.
There's an immediate difference in a female asking a question
simply because she isn't in the majority."
This potential intimidation could lead females to decide not to
apply, said sophomore Chris Shen.
"The difficulty lies first with the self-selection of those who
want to apply," Shen said." I bey have to feel that they have some
thing to contribute. Also, men have been encouraged to tinker
around and tend to be much more vocal about their activities."
Most RCCs are males simply Ijecause most people who apply
are Computer Science majors, and most (Computer Science majors
are male, according to Frank. This year, (SO percent of Computer
Science majors are male. However, Frank stated that Residential
(Computing encouraged students in the humanities to apply.
"li they have computer experience, then that's the main
thing," Frank said. "They don't have to have the major. They
need to be suited personally — they can teach people and inter
act."
I lines, an English major, agrees with this notion.
"I chose to try out for the position because 1 like helping peo
ple fix their problems," Innes said. "1 have good people skills."
Frank said that more females are becoming involved with
technical assistance on campus.
"It's changing," Franks said. "I supervise the clusters and al
most one-third of the cluster supporters are women. They are
doing repairs, not just consulting."
1 lowever, despite the increase in females, the gender gap con
tinues to be a problem for Residential Computing.
"It's something we've always been concerned about," Franks
said. "We haven't yet been able to find a solution to make it 50/
50."
Innes said that she hopes more females will apply to be RCCs
in the future and emphasized the fact that the job is not biased to
ward one gender.
"Anyone who is qualified and meets the requirements set forth
can be an RCC," Innes said.
