## Undefeated men prove conference superiority Stanford tennis downs UCLA and USC to remain atop Pac-10 and vie for top ranking in nation 
### SAMEER AHMED STAFF WRITER 
Whenever the Stanford and I CIA men's
tennis teams compete against each other, one
thing is for certain: the crowd is in for a treat.
The No. 4 Cardinal (17-0, 5-0 Pacific 10
Conference), the only undefeated team in the
country, knocked off No. 1 UCIA (17-3, 4-1)
in a thrilling 4-3 nail-biter on Fridav afternoon
at the Tail be Family I ennis Stadium. I lie fol
lowing day, the Cardinal had an easier time de
feating No. 18 Southern California, ">-2, to
reestablish itself as the team to beat in men's
collegiate tennis.
Friday's match against the Bruins had the
aura, intensity and excitement as if the two
teams were battling fit »i an NCAA champi
onship. With a 3-3 tie, the match came clou n to
No. 5 singles where freshman David Martin
outlasted I ClA's Lassi ketola, 6-7, 0-3, 6-4.
After losing the first set, Martin rebounded
to win the first five games of the second set and
never looked back to clinch the (Cardinal victo
ry.
Playing in the decisive match against the
No. 1 team in the country could be intimidat
ing for a freshman, but Martin overcame any
anxiety to win the exhausting 2 1/2-hour
match.
"There was obviously pressure, but 1 tried
not to think about it," Martin said. "I just tried
to think of it as one match. Whether you're up
6-0 or down 6-0, you've got to compete the
same way."
The Cardinal also received straight set vic
tories from junior Alex Kim and senior Ceofl
Abrams in singles play.
Kim, ranked third in the nation, defeated

No. 26Jong-Min Lee, 6-4, 7-6, at No. I singles,
while ninth-ranked Abrams overpowered No.
36 Brandon Kramer in a 6-1, 7-5 victory.
However, if Stanford did not win the dou
bles point at the beginning of the match, the
Bruins would have probably come away with
the victory.
After splitting the first two mate lies, the cru
cial doubles point came clown to the No. 3
match where juniors Ali Ansari and Scotty
Scott were in a see-saw battle with Ketola and
Travis Retteninaier. I railing 7-6 and one
game away 112 rom losing, Ansari and Scott came
from behind to win the final three games and
the match, ( .)-7.
Ansari said that the crowd helped Scott and
him put their opponents awav at the end of the
match.
"I want to give credit to all the guys in my
house," Ansari said. "SAF was just incredible
today. These guys pulled us through the dou
bles. They pretty much won the match for us
once again." Although Friday's crowd was the
largest and most vocal of the season, its some
times-inconsiderate behavior disrupted the
match at times.
For example, somebody in the crowd
screamed in the middle of Ketola's serve in the
No. 3 doubles match. I he person's outburst al
most cost the( Cardinal a crucial point when the
match was tied 7-7.
Apparently, some members of the Sixth
Man Club even showed up .it the end of the
match when Martin was facing Ketola. Some
people in the crowd began doingthe infamous
"right-left-rigln" c hant .is Ketola was hobbling
around to pick up the balls iu between points.
"For the most part, the c rowd was great,"
said head coach I )ic k (iould." 1 definitelv want
the ( rowd to be ex( ited and emotionallv into
the mate lies, but ii should not be disruptive
and disrespectful to the opposing team. If I
can't control the crowd, it could cost our guvs
crucial points in their matches."
The Cardinal is now 2-0 against
the Bruins this season, including a
4-3 victory in the finals of the Na
tional Team Indoor Champi
onships on Feb. 27 in Louisville,
Kentucky. The two teams will bat
tit- again on April 22 in Los Ange
les.
"This match proves to ns that
we tan beat the No. 1 team in the
country, but we go down there in
two weeks to play these guys
again," Abrams said. "It's a good
win, but we're not overly ecstatic.
We've still got a job to do the rest
of the season."
Stanford continued to do its job
extremely well the very next day
with a 5-2 win over No. IN USC
(13-7,3-2 Pat-10).
Abrams and Kim, the No. 1
doubles team in the nation, con
tinued their dominating play by
defeating No. (j Ryan Moore and
Nit Raincy, K-4. kini and Abrams
are now 30-3 on the season, in
cluding seven wins over oppo
nents ranked in the top ten in the
country.
After sweeping the doubles, the
Cardinal won four of six singles
matches to seal the victory. Kim,
Abrams, Ansari and Martin all de
feated their opponents in straight
sets.
