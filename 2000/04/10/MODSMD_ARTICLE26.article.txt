with sophomore Margie Din
geldein winning the beginning of
the game sprint, and junior Kris
koblik scoring on the Cardinal's
first possession. Stanford then
cruised ahead to a 4-1 lead by the
end of the first quarter. After es
tablishing its lead, Stanford used
conservative defense and intense
counterattacking to control the
game and dominate the Bears.
Koblik and freshman Julie
Gardner each notched two goals
against California. Junior Anne-
Marie Keenan and Dingeldein
added one a piece.
"It was nice to finally beat Cal,"
said junior Kelly Shouey. "We
wanted to establish ourselves as the
top team before going into nation
als. We also had to prove to our
selves that we could beat Cal"
In Saturday's semi-final game
against UCIA, Gardner lead the
Stanford scoring with three goals.
Keenan and Shouey each con
tributed two.
l he Cardinal manage to stay
ahead of I CLA until the fourth
quarter when an outside shot from
All-Ainerican senior Erin Gola
bosky tied the game. Gardner re

sponded by stuffing the UCLA
goalie from the outside, giving the
Cardinal a one goal advantage. On
the next UCIA possession, Stan
ford stole the ball and ran out the
clock coming away with the victo

"The UCLA game was tough,"
said junior Ali Riddell. "We kept
our composure and played our
game allowing us to come out on
top."
" The top four teams are all
equal in ability," said junior Hilary
Gallogly. "The team who can
maintain control and stick togeth
er is the team that will come out on
top. This is what we managed to do
this weekend."
The "top four teams" refers to
Stanford, California, UCLA and
USC. Before the championship
game, UCIA topped USC 7-4 in
the consolation game.
Redshirt freshman goalie Jackie
Frank showed outstanding play
throughout the tournament.
Against California, Frank made
several key blocks and served as
the foundation for the Cardinal
defense.
For her performance, Frank
was named to the All-Tournament
team along with teammates Din
geldein and Gardner.
"It feels great to take home the
conference title," said junior Dani

Bell. "But our season is not over
and we need to stay focused on
our long term goal of winning na
tionals."
While Stanford's MPSF first
place finish is impressive, it has no
effect on the upcoming national
championships other than serving
as a boost of self esteem. Seeding
for national championships will be
based on the results at the national
qualifying tournament hosted by
California April 22-23. Once at na
tionals, which will be held in Indi
ana, any team has a chance to win.
"Like every other game we've
played, this is just one more step to
Indiana," said Keenan. "If we want
to take home the national title we
need to practice winning champi
onship games. Today we got a
chance to do so."
Since October, Stanford has
been following a well established
plan of conditioning and skill
work. According to the team mem
bers, every practice and every
game is viewed as an opportunity
to learn and grow. Stanford will
continue with this plan until its ul
timate chance to prove itself this
May.
"There are a lot of areas we
need to improve on before May,"
Hiddell said. "But beating Gal and
winning MPSF's was a good step in
the right direction."
