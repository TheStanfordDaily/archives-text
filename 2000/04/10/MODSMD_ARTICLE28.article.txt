Nationals whenever 1 (eel bad about my tennis."
Of course, Heiser doesn't think about tennis
all ilit' time. Unlike most athletes, she doesn't
plan on pursuing her sport professionally.
And, unlike most Stanford students, she
doesn't know what she wants to do when she
graduates — and she's not worried about it.
"I take things as they come," she explains.
"I'm not a good planner. I don't know what 1
want to do. 1 want to try different things. I don't
know what I'm passionate about, but I really
hope to figure it out soon."
1 ieiser's tone may be nonchalant, but just as
her calm on-coiu t demeanor Ix-lies an internal
tire, her carefree words belie a thoughtful mind.
Heiser was born in Stockton, California. Al
though she excelled in several sports, Heiser
drew national attention for tennis. When she was
1(), she won the prestigious National I lard (.ourt
title and finished the year ranked fourth in the
nation. Because she was also a strong student, at
tending Stanford rapidly-became a viable option.
A cornerstone of the Stanford program since
her freshman year, 1 leiser has compiled a formi
dable 86-19 singles record. Her reputation for
consistency is matched only by her reputation for
fairness and sportsmanship. In 1999, she was
honored with both the Arthur Ashe Sportsman
ship Award for the Northwest Region and the
Michelle Weiss Award for courage.
112 leiser has enjoyed her time at Stanford, but
sfie'll be ready to leave by June. While she has rel
ished being a part of the most successful colle
giate tennis program in the nation, she's tired of
the non-stop grind.

"She wouldn't say it,"says Sherbakov, "but
she's worked so hard. She always stays after and
does extra weights or extra running. She's in the
best shape of anyone on the team."
1 feiser's also ready to explore a world outside
the ultra-competitive, ultra-high-strung Stan
ford.
"I've never felt like I fit in academically," she
says. "1 can't get competitive in my classes like
eveiyone else."
That's not to say, of course, that Heiser
doesn't have dynamic academic interests; she's
currently pursuing a degree in Sociology.
A recent trip to Europe made her curious
about alternative cultural options. After growing
up in a traditional American family, surrounded
by traditional American values, Heiser recog
nizes the limitations of her own experience.
"I come from where 1 come from, and I know
what 1 know from the experiences I've had, and
I can't help that," she says."For example, in my
family, there was generally never a lot of discus
sion. 1 never really discussed anything before 1
came to college. But I like discussions like this —
figuring out what 1 think, putting what I think
into words."
1 feiser is not sure how her interests will man
ifest themselves career-wise, but she's willing to
let time solve the problem.
"My family thinks I should get a job," she says.
" They're nervous that I don't know what I want
to do. But I feel like 1 need to figure things out
more for myself rather than just following what is
normal."
Part of Heiser's post-graduate journey in
cludes a return to Europe. The rest is uncertain.
Regardless, however, of what turns her life takes,
the fearlessness that helped her save three match
points at last year's NCAA Championships will
also serve her well as she travels the world, "dis
covering new perspectives and new places."

Nationals whenever 1 (eel bad about my tennis."
Of course, Heiser doesn't think about tennis
all ilit' time. Unlike most athletes, she doesn't
plan on pursuing her sport professionally.
And, unlike most Stanford students, she
doesn't know what she wants to do when she
graduates — and she's not worried about it.
"I take things as they come," she explains.
"I'm not a good planner. I don't know what 1
want to do. 1 want to try different things. I don't
know what I'm passionate about, but I really
hope to figure it out soon."
1 ieiser's tone may be nonchalant, but just as
her calm on-coiu t demeanor Ix-lies an internal
tire, her carefree words belie a thoughtful mind.
Heiser was born in Stockton, California. Al
though she excelled in several sports, Heiser
drew national attention for tennis. When she was
1(), she won the prestigious National I lard (.ourt
title and finished the year ranked fourth in the
nation. Because she was also a strong student, at
tending Stanford rapidly-became a viable option.
A cornerstone of the Stanford program since
her freshman year, 1 leiser has compiled a formi
dable 86-19 singles record. Her reputation for
consistency is matched only by her reputation for
fairness and sportsmanship. In 1999, she was
honored with both the Arthur Ashe Sportsman
ship Award for the Northwest Region and the
Michelle Weiss Award for courage.
112 leiser has enjoyed her time at Stanford, but
sfie'll be ready to leave by June. While she has rel
ished being a part of the most successful colle
giate tennis program in the nation, she's tired of
the non-stop grind.

"She wouldn't say it,"says Sherbakov, "but
she's worked so hard. She always stays after and
does extra weights or extra running. She's in the
best shape of anyone on the team."
1 feiser's also ready to explore a world outside
the ultra-competitive, ultra-high-strung Stan
ford.
"I've never felt like I fit in academically," she
says. "1 can't get competitive in my classes like
eveiyone else."
That's not to say, of course, that Heiser
doesn't have dynamic academic interests; she's
currently pursuing a degree in Sociology.
A recent trip to Europe made her curious
about alternative cultural options. After growing
up in a traditional American family, surrounded
by traditional American values, Heiser recog
nizes the limitations of her own experience.
"I come from where 1 come from, and I know
what 1 know from the experiences I've had, and
I can't help that," she says."For example, in my
family, there was generally never a lot of discus
sion. 1 never really discussed anything before 1
came to college. But I like discussions like this —
figuring out what 1 think, putting what I think
into words."
1 feiser is not sure how her interests will man
ifest themselves career-wise, but she's willing to
let time solve the problem.
"My family thinks I should get a job," she says.
" They're nervous that I don't know what I want
to do. But I feel like 1 need to figure things out
more for myself rather than just following what is
normal."
Part of Heiser's post-graduate journey in
cludes a return to Europe. The rest is uncertain.
Regardless, however, of what turns her life takes,
the fearlessness that helped her save three match
points at last year's NCAA Championships will
also serve her well as she travels the world, "dis
covering new perspectives and new places."
