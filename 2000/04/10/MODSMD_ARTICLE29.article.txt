### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
l he No. 1 1 Stanford men's volleyball team (10-10,9-
8 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) clinc bed a MPSF
playoff berth Saturday night with its 10-1-4, 13-1"), 15-0,
15-7 win over the Pacific Tigers (10-15, 6-1 1). Fhe Car
dinal and Loyola Marymount will now be w ing for the
seventh seed, but wins in its two remaining regular sea
son games will guarantee Stanford lhe higher slot.
For now the squad is pleased to have clinched a pla\ -
oil spot after falling short of playoff ccintention last sea
son. The victory also takes pressure oil next weekend's
games against (IS Northriclge and I ( -Santa Barbara.
"It's nice to go down to L.A. knowing we're in the
tournament,"' head coach Ruben Nievessaid. "We want
to cany the nice momentum we have going now into the
tournament but it's nice that we don't have to worn
about securing a spot."
Ironically it was losses to Pacific that kept Stanford
out of the tournament last season, while this season
Stanford's two wins against Pacific have left the I igers
scrambling for the final plavofl berth.
.After a come-from-behind five-game victory against
No. 1 Long Beach State last weekend, Stanford contin
ued to show its ability to finish strong again on Saturday
by turning a dull start into a dominating finish. Ihe
team's hitting percentage reflects the improvement as
Stanford went from .2-11 and .283 in game two, to .370
and .628 in the final two games.
"We started slow, but got bettei and belter." sopho
more Marcus Skacel said. " I hat's something we've been
doing really well lately. (>ood teams always pull through
in the end."
Integral to Stanford's increasing sue c ess in the match
was its strength off the bench, namely the pla\ of junior
Brett Youngberg and freshmen Billy Stric kland and
Paul Bocage. Despite Youngberg's lingering bat k mjui \
and Strickland's split c hin and broken teeth from Fri
day's practice, both players had a strong perfc >i inane es.
In game one Stanford faced a Pacific game-point .it
14-12 when Youngberg and Strickland came in and
with three quick plavs, brought the team to a tie, and the
squad was able to take the game 16-14.
Stanford saw a similar situation in game two. Al
though Stanford built a 10-4 lead. Pacific turned the
game around and the Cardinal wale heel its lead disap
pear into a 13-1 I chase from behind. Stric kland c atne in
to give the squad a boost and Stanford once
again tied it up, but could not close out the game.
"In game two we mentally let the game slip
away," Bocage said. "We had a big lead, got a lit
tle lax and let them back in the game. We let
them get away with winning."
Pacific carried its momentum into game three
and went up early 4-1, but after Bocage and
Strickland entered the game, Stanford went on
tooutscore Pacific 13-1. Two long serving strings
by Stanford were key to clinching game three.
Strickland served seven straight points tor the
C Cardinal taking the team from 4-5 to 11 -5, while
freshman Curt Toppel served out the match on

a four point run.
Stanford did not let up during game four and
easily put the match away.
"Paul Bocageand Brett Youngberg attacked
and blocked (he ball very well. Their presence at
net really helped us turn things around," Nieves
said. "When they entered the match our offense
was much more complete. Their effectiveness in
the middle opened up Curt [ I oppeljon the out
side."
Despite a slow start for Toppel, the nation's
kill-per-game leader didn't have any errors in
the last two games and led the squad in kills with
38. Skacel followed with 16 kills, while Young
berg recorded 13 and Bocage 11.
"We're getting our whole team into it," Skacel
said of the team effort. "We're showing that we
are a pretty deep team. Any guy can come in off
the bench, step it up and make a difference."
