### SANDRA UPSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The closing of Jim's C Coffee Shop, .1 fixture
on Universal y Avenue since the 19505, marks
t he end of at 1 era for downtown Palo Alto.
According'to new owner Abraham Khali I.
Jim's will reopen this summer after extensive
remodeling a.s Kan Zemau. a full-scale eatery
with a Meditei ranean and Middle Kastern in
fluence. Jim's will remain open until the ren
ovation begins.
I hough so. me Jim's regulars have ex
pressed sadnes:> at the change, Klialil said he
will try to retain the appeal of the popular
landmark.
"People are a fraid of losing the history, but
we're not going to. We're enhancing it, tak
ing the best of it — the doughnuts, the break
fast, the cozy atn losphere — and giving it a
face-lift. We're not changing the history but

rather bringing out thebeaut\ of it."
Some patrons remain wary of the change.
"I'm very worried. Nothing will ever replace
what it is today," Palo Alto resident Bill
Campbell told I he San |ose Mercury News.
Khalil plans to retain previous owner Bar
ney Kang's breakfast menu and doughnut
tradition, but will offer more upscale items in
Mediterranean-style lunch and dinner
menus. I le said he hopes to keep the atmos
phere as warm and friendly as Jim's.
"A lot of the customers are older [and]
come here everyday. It's a habit, a refuge, a
routine. So we can't stay c losed for remodel
ing for too long — where are they going to
go? For many it's the last place on the street
that represents the past," Khalil said.
Although Khalil said he will strive to in
corporate the history of the shop in the
decor, the bar and vintage vinyl booths will be
replaced with Km opean-style tables and
booths. Khalil also said he will lix the walls
while adding a few columns and large plants
to the interior.
Khalil added that Kan Zeman —
Arabic for 'once upon a time' — will
stay open until midnight instead of
closing at ten or eleven like most
restaurants along University Av
enue.
Khalil is hopeful about the
restaurant's prospects.
"1 understand that this place
has a magnificent history and I'm
not going to change that."
