# Hospitals name CEOs
## Hospital veterans Mitchell Dawes new CEOs as UCSF-Stanford split finalized 
### CHRIS DRAKE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Both Stanford Hospital and Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital have
named new Chief Executive Officers, as
the University's two hospitals try to get
back on track in the wake of the failed
UCSK-Stanford medical merger.
1 he new CEOs, both of whom as
sumed their titles immediately, have ex
tensive work experience at Stanford.
Malinda Mitchell took over as the new
CEO of Stanford Hospital last Monday.
She began working for the hospital in
1975 as a clinical nursing coordinator
and in 1989 was named chief operating
officer.
After Stanford and UCSK merged
health care services in 1997, Mitchell
served as senior vice president and chief

operating officer for one segment of the
joint operation. The merger ended last
fall after encountering financial prob
lems.
I he new CEO for the Children's Hos
pital, Christopher Dawes, worked at
Stanford in the late 197()'s as assistant di
rector of nursing. He returned to Stan
ford in 1987, and in 1997 was named ex
ecutive vice president and chief operat
ing officer for the Children's Hospital.
He held the title of senior vice president
and chief operating officer during the
merger.
Mitchell admitted that a great deal of
work remains to be done following the
UCSF-Stanford split. Assets were re
turned to each institution April 1, the
final step in dissolving the merger.
"We have a lot of refocusing to do
after the de-merger," Mitchell said. She
cited several main objectives the Stan
ford Hospital will work on in the coming
months, including "program develop
ment, volume building," and trying to
"bring new services to patients.'
So far, she said, the process is
going well.
"We also are going to refocus
on our customer service,"
Mitchell said. She said the hospi
tal was highly esteemed for its
"technical expertise" two years
ago, but wasn't really recognized
as much for its customer satisfac
tion.
"We are already seeing some
results," she said, adding that the
hospital's goal is to "make every
one's visit or stay really meet [his
or her] expectations."
Mitchell said the hospital will
also work on its cost-effectiveness
now that it has the technology to
do things faster and better. How
ever, she said that following the
UCSF-Stanford split, govern
ment funding for the hospital —
especially Medicare funding —
has decreased.
The hospital's income "isn't
going up nearly enough to ad
just inflation," so the hospital
must be more efficient, Mitchell
said.
While both the Stanford Hos
pital and the Children's Hospital
will operate as separate entities,
they will each "share a lot of the
infrastructure departments,"
Mitchell said.
In addition to what Mitchell
called "shared services," the
boards of both hospitals will have
ten overlapping members, al
though the boards themselves
will remain separate. The chair
of Stanford's board will be
Denise O'Leary, while John Lil
lie will head up the board for the
Children's Hospital.
The new dean of the School of
Medicine will be the tenth joint
board member.
According to Mitchell, a
search team has been formed to
examine candidates for the posi
tion and the process is now "well
underway."
Although there is no timeline
for when the new dean will be
named, Mitchell speculated that
he or she will "probably [be] in
place by the beginning of the next
fiscal year" sometime this August.
