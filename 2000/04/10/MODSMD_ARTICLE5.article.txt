Stanford's RA selection process to
be very effective.

the RA select ion process. I'm meet
inga lot of great people through it,
and the group dynamics of the in

inan year. It makes your whole
Stanford career come fiill circle,
ending with the same energy you
came in with."
"Make sure you're willing to
put in .ill the time and energy that
it takes to the job well," advised
Pearson. "You have to be willing to
set aside a lot of other things to do
the job well, and it's those sacrifices
that makes everything come to
