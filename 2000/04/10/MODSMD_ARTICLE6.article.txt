for religious life, delivered the invocation.
"Jane and Iceland Stanford believed that minds trained
and open would better the world." karlin-Neumann said.
Ihe program continued with a performance by Talisman,
a student a cappella group, and a message from architectur
al historian and Art Prof. Paul Turner.
In a speech titled "'l'he Stanfords' Vision of Their Univer
sity: Was it Appropriate?" Turner said that although the ar
chitects of the University are widely praised, "it was actually
the Stanfords who conceived many of the best ideas, or at
least the innovative ones."
furner said that the highly structured character of the
University, in addition to its large, ornate structures, empha

sized how the University was designed to be a grand memor

Jane and Leland Stanford founded the I niversitx in 1891
in memory of their son Leland, ] r., who died of tvphoid fever

University's first president David Starr Jordan, i> honored in
the annual Founders' Day celebration.

imitated by other universities such as Columbia University

universities becomes submerged as their campuses grow, but
at Stanford "the forces of disorder are mitigated by its frame
work." As the center and a symbol of the University, "the
Quad serves as an antidote to the hectic world outside.
"The Stanfords created a campus that has become better
with time," 'Furner said.

Church, University President Cerhard Casper spoke about
