I lie Edge, Palo Alto's 18-and-over night
club, is growing up.
On April 29 the club will close its doors, re

I'lie new establishment, as yel unnamed, will

currently frequent I lie* club. In other words, the
new c lub will be loi patrons 21 and over.
Act ok ling to jimmy Arceneaux, The Edge's
hooking agent, the changeover is not due to
any troubles with the current dub. He ex
plained, "These tvpe ot venues have t eased to
be much of a challenge. I lie owner just got
tired of it and wanted to trv something new."
In its time, I he Kdge and the other clubs in
the same location that preceded it ( The Key

and Arceneaux proudly said, "we will have a

The run-down establishment will be entire

be used for weddings and corporate events.
Unlike the intimate jazz clubs in San Fran

see the big name artists.
I'lie Edge attracted residents from primari
ly the East Bay, and only about 2 percent from
San Francisco. Arceneaux expects this to
change. "We're going after artists you can't see
in San Francisco, without pay ing for them with
your light arm. James Brown would lie really
key."
I he Edge, by virtue of being an 18-and-over
club, had the reputation of attracting mostly
high school kitls. Senior David Countryman
wondered, "Where are all the 15-year-olds pre
tending to be 18 going to go?"
According to Arceneaux, it is this kind of
reputation that the new club hopes to avoid by
raising the age limit to 21.
For those who are over 21 and love to go
dancing, the new club will continue to hold
dance nights. They will play top forty and tech
no music, "just nothing u>o edgy," said Arce
neaux. unintentional of his pun.

The neighboring businesses are happy
about the change. Ben Tascian, owner of the
Cafe Dolce Vita, across the street from The
Edge, said, "I think its better for the neighbor
hood. We won't have people wandering in here
looking for a restroom anymore. There will be
fewer fights as well, not so rowdy."
As with most nightclubs, the Edge has had
incidents requiring police intervention. How
ever, Palo Alto Police Sgt. John Cobb told the
Palo Alto Daily that he gave the club's manage
ment high marks for working hard to curb such
problems.
Arceneaux agreed, saying, "We have had
fewer problems than any other club I've ever
been to. In my six years here, we have had only
one drug bust, and our security guards caught
the dealer within 15 minutes of his entrance."
Another benefit for the neighborhood busi
nesses is that the jazz club will increase foot traf
fic in the area during business hours.
To some business people on California Ave,
however, the impact is negligible. John Clifton,
manager of Keeble and Shuchat Photography,
grumbled, "I couldn't care less about the Edge,
I'm just trying to run a business."
Palo Alto resident Tom Martin welcomed
the change because " I couldn't relate to most of
the music at The Edge, and I like jazz."
Many will miss hearing rock and roll music
at the Edge, however. Steve "Red" Hewitt, vo
calist with local band Chicken Coupe De Ville
told the Palo Alto Daily, "The last remaining
cool people in the valley are going to miss this
place."
