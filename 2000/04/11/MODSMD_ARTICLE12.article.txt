NEW YORK. (AP) â€” Pulitzer Prize voters
went for little-known artists over old favorites
this year, with playwright Donald Margulies,
fiction writer Jhumpa Lahiri and composer
Lewis Spratlan among the winners announced
yesterday.
Margulies won for his off-Broadway play
"Dinner With Friends," the story of two mar
ried couples and what happens when one
decides to divorce. Lahiri was cited for her col
lection "Interpreter of Maladies" and Spratlan
for "Life is a Dream, Opera in Three Acts: Ac t
Two, Concert Version."
The 47-year-old Margulies, in Seattle for
rehearsals of a new play, called the drama prize
"a pleasant surprise."
"The play emerged out of a particular time
in my lift', a midlife reflection on the pains of
fidelity, friendship and sexual passion," he
said.
I lis competition included past Pulitzer win
ner August Wilson's "King Medley II."
Jahiri was c hosen over past Pulitzer winner
Annie Proulx and current National Book

Award winner Ha Jin. 1 lie fiction prize usual
ly goes to a veteran novelist, making Jahiri an
unlikely winner for three reasons: She's [V2, a
debut writer and an author of short stories.
Few expected her to win, including Jahiri.
1 he New Yorker, whose stories are set in both
India and the United States, had just returned
from Boston yesterday after receiving the
PEN/Hemingway prize for best first fiction.
"We were actually joking about the Pulitzer
Prize yesterday." she said. "A friend of the fam
ily said, 'The Nobel is next.' I la. ha. And some
body else said, 'No, no, the Pulitzers come
before that.' We were just laughing about it.
Historian David M. Kennedy, biographer
Stacy SchifV and poet C.K. Williams were
among the other winners in arts categories.
Fhe Pulitzer f<>r general nonfiction was
awarded to John W. Dower for "Embracing
Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War 11."
He earlier won the National Book Award for
the same work and also won the Bancroft prize,
an historians' award.
"This is astonishing," said Dower, 65, a pro

fessor of history at the Massachusetts Institute
of Fechnology. "I'm going to dance around
with my wife for a few moments."
Fhe music award went to Spratlan for his
composition, "Life is a Dream, Opera in Fhree
Acts: Act Two, Concert Version." Spratlan
composed the opera on a commission from the
New Haven Opera Theater in the 19705, but
the company went out of business and the
opera has never been performed.
He received a commission for a chamber
piece fin a music group in Boston, Dinosaur
Annex Music Ensemble, and wrote Act Two for
a concert version.
Kennedy won the history award for "Free
dom fiom Fear: Fhe American People in
Depression and War, 1929-45."
fhe history teacher also has written books
on the life of Planned Parenthood founder
Margaret Sanger and World War I.
"I gave up wine for Lent, but 1 think I'm
going to give myself a dispensation" said the
58-year-old Kennedy after receiving word of
his win.
