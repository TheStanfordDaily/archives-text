# Conflict over land continues in Zimbabwe
## 
### 
HARARF, Zimbabwe (AP) —
Zimbabwe's attorney general
ruled out using police to oust
black squatters from hundreds of
white-owned farms, saying yester
day that doing so "would be a
match that would ignite the coun
try into a bloody conflagration."
Three more families fled their
farms (lining the weekend. It was
the first time since the farm
takeovers began in late February
that white farmers have moved
into friends' homes in towns after
being confronted by squatters
armed with axes, clubs, spears
and guns.
One farmer, Alex van Leen
liofl, wept as In- told neighbors
that he has no 112 uture in Zimbabwe
after armed squatters forced him
to sign a paper saying he was giv
ing them his nearly 1,000-acre
tobacco limn in Karoi, 125 miles
northwest of I larare.
In the 900 other occupied
fimns across the country, squat
ters were usually encamped out
side of buildings, uneasily coexist
ing with the fanners and their
workers.
In an exchange in the High
Court yesterday, an attorney for
the farmers accused President
Robert Mugabe's administration
of ignoring the rights of white
farmers, who own about a third of
the productive land in this south
ern African country.
"White people in this country
are not entitled to the protection

of the law," said attorney Adrian
de Bourbon, his voice quavering.
De Bourbon, who is white, said
Mugabe's administration has
abandoned the rule of law by fail
ing to heed court orders to evict
the squatters.
Attorney General Patrick Chi
naniasa called the farm occupa
tions a just fight against unfair
laws that allow some people to
own more land than others, and
compared the takeovers to South
Africa's struggle against
apartheid.
I)e Bourbon dismissed the
comparison, saying: "We are not
talking about apartheid or an ille
gitimate government, but abuse
by the state of the supreme law of
Zimbabwe: the constitution."
De Bourbon, who represents
the 4,000 members of the Com
mercial Farmers Union, whose
membership is mostly white,
asked Judge Moses Chinenga to
order the government to evict
farm squatters. He is to rule
Thursday.
A March 17 court order
instructing the government to
evict the squatters was ignored.
And the attorney general indi
cated the government has no
plans to move against the squat
ters now.
"At the end of the day, the land
issue cannot be resolved by court
orders," Chinamasa said.
Critics say Mugabe, who has
ruled Zimbabwe since indepen

dence in 1980, is all<>\\ ing the land
seizures to increase his waning
support among black voters
ahead of parliamentary elections
expected in May.
Chinamasa has said the
nation's 20,000-inembei police
force had neither the manpower
nor equipment to end the occupa
tions of more than 900 farms, and
that the government would not
deploy troops to assist the police.
He described the occupations
as "minor transgressions ol ties
pass'' laws and said the squatters,
led by men c laiming to be veter

ans of Zimbabwe's independence
war, would light lor the land.
"Any successful operation
would trigger a violent reaction
countrywide ... It would be a
match that would ignite the coun
try into a bloody conflagration,"
he told the court.
Last week, several farmers
were forced to sign over land to
occupiers who threatened them
while police looked on, leaders of
the fanners said.
The farmers' union has urged
white landowners to not retaliate
physically or with firearms.
