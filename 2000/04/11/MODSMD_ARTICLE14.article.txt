TBILISI, Georgia (AP) —
Foreign observers sharply criti
cized Georgia yesterday for vio
lations during its presidential
elections, which incumbent
Eduard Shevardnadze won by
an enormous margin.
Shevardnadze denied that
there was tampering with the
count, which showed him with
more than <S() percent of the
vote in this mountainous
republic of 5 million people. "I
didn't need any vote-rigging. I
had broad popular support,"
he said.
But Nikolai Vulchanov, head
of the election observer mission
in Georgia for the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, listed several
grievances.
" There were more ballots cast
than registered," he said at a
news conference. "Also, many
polling stations were located on
the premises of executive bodies
of power. At some of the stations
there were policemen inside —
they should be outside."
Shevardnadze, who is widely
respected abroad for his years
as Soviet foreign minister
under Mikhail Gorbachev, is
eager to move his economically
suffering country closer to the
West. But the criticism of the
elections could cast a shadow on
his aims.
"Considerable progress is
necessary for Georgia to fully
meet its commitments as a par
ticipating state of the OSCE,"
the mission's statement said.
Nonetheless, Shevardnadze
vowed that Georgia would con
tinue its drive to integrate with
Western structures.

"By the end of my second
presidential term in 2005,
Georgia will knock on NATO's
door," he said. "But it is hard to
say whether it will be opened or
if we will be told to wait."
The OSCE also was critical of
the weeks leading up to the
Sunday vote.
"The authorities did not
behave impartially and gave
strong support for the election
campaign of the incumbent,"
said a statement from the
observer mission.
"The state media failed to
fulfill their obligations to pro
vide balanced reports on the
candidates and gave the incum
bent a clear advantage," it
added.
The OSCE called on Georgia
to "vigorously investigate
breaches of the criminal code
related to election violations."
Some of the complaints were
echoed by an observer mission
of the parliamentary assembly
of the Council of Europe, the
continent's leading human
rights watchdog.
" The voting was conducted
in an orderly fashion, albeit
marred by some instances of
massive ballot-stuffing wit
nessed by the delegation," the
Council of Europe said in a
statement.
Although the final count was
not expected until later this
week, Shevardnadze had an
unassailable lead. With 88 per
cent of the ballots counted, he
had 80.4 percent of the vote —
far higher than the approxi
mately 50 percent that pre-elec
t ion opinion polls had forecast
lie would get.
