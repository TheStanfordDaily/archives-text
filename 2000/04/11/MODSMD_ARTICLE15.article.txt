# Cheetah escapes from zoo
## 
### 
CINCINNATI (AP) — Some
visitors to the Cincinnati Zoo got a
closer look at a cheetah than they
probably wanted.
I he 4-year-old cat somehow
escaped from its stone-walled
exhibit Saturday and roamed free
for a while. A zoo visitor told the
zookeepers, who found Casper
within about 15 minutes.
Casper apparently was so

unnerved by the unfamiliar sur
roundings that he waded into a
shallow lake, looking for refuge on
a small island, curator Mike
Dulaney said. The animal was
shot with a tranquilizer dart and
carried off on a stretcher.
After his big adventure, Casper
was confined elsewhere while zoo
workers tried to determine how
he escaped.
