## The 						Stanford Daily Frosh car ban leads to services needed all along 
### 
Published Since J 891

AFTFR 18 MON THS of planning
and negotiations, the Offices of
Parking and Transportation Ser
vices and Student Affairs finally
delivered the ultimatum that many incoming
freshmen had feared was coming: parking
permits will not be sold to freshmen next year,
thereby effectively banning frosh cars.
The oflices attempted to mitigate their
decision by introducing a slew of new pro
grams for next year — all designed to reduce
the need lor personal transportation as much
as possible. I he Stanford Bookstore will open
a car rental service, Webvan.com will have
drop-oil sites on campus, the Marguerite will
expand service to include stops at Safeway
and the San Antonio Shopping Center and
freshman dorms will be provided with funds

to subsidize transportation costs. But, in the
face of all these new services, one is tempted to
ask, "Why didn't we have these before?"
These new alternatives seem to present a
promising way to facilitate students getting off
campus, so perhaps they should have been
instituted before banning freshman cars. It is
no secret that, currently, students face very
limited alternatives w hen deciding how to go
off campus. Without a car, or without know
ing someone who has a car, taking the Cal-
Train all the way to San Francisco is about the
only way to get off campus. Not too helpful
when one just needs to go to Safeway.
Many students initially come to Stanford
without a car, but, after a couple quarters of
depending on generous friends and limited
Marguerite service, many decide to bring a

car from home. Similarly, many students visit
ing Stanford for the first time, perceiving a
clear lack in transportation services here,
choose to bring a car when they might not
have given different circumstances. If the new
transportation services had been instituted
before deciding to limit the number of cars on
campus, perhaps there would not have been a
need to make a decision about frosh cars.
With better options and more ways to get
off campus, students might have alleviated the
problem themselves by deciding not to bring
cars to campus or by leaving the cars they did
have on campus at home the next quarter. A
car can be a hassle to maintain on campus, so
many students might welcome a chance to rid
themselves of the extra responsibility.
However, since the additions to public

transportation were made at the same time as
the decision to ban frosh cars, there is little to
be done at this point. But the administration
should remain open to changing the car poli
cy (and allowing freshmen to have cars on
campus) if students at all levels seem willing to
use these services in the upcoming years.
Both offices involved in this decision obvi
ously have the students' interests at heart, so
they should be willing to revert to the old
policy if, once the new transportation
options become established, these options
prove successful with the entire student pop
ulation. Such success would indicate that,
even if frosh cars were again allowed, stu
dents, given the new transportation services,
would likely choose to leave their cars at
home regardless.
