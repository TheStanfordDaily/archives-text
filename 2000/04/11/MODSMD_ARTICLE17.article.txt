## Oh brave new post office 
### 
It 11 ill k the time has come for me lo
write on the most trite ol any ol I he
Daily's opinions topic s — the Stan
ford post office. My reasoning is
(hat, despite the vast amount ol negative
press — from IheDailv to The San Fran
cisco Chronicle to the local news — 1 per
sonally have no issues with the post office
as ol late. Am I alone on that one?
I guess I must be liv ing in an alternate
Stanford I inverse (and I think some of
inv with-nolhing-bettcr-10-do critics

would agree), bill since
the- post office's Big
Move, things have basi
callv improved when H
< tunes to ( In is' "Post
()1 1 i( e Lxpei iencc."
For starters, I love
the kev filing. I was a
combo |icrson back in
flic cla\ sol the old post
office, having to spin

ill.ii dam dial around and around and
sometimes, no matter how main times I
thought I'd put in m\ combo, the thing
still wouldn't open. I bus, with the advent
of mv new silver box, I get to add a beau
tiful gold kev (with very sharp teeth —
seriously, (bet k yours out; you could kill
someone with that thing) to mv ever
growing collection. No more combo has
sle, .ind I have a self-defense weapon on
those dark nights at 2 a.m. when I just
have to see il I have mail.
And. now, tu\ actual new box. Okay,
granted the number ( hanging was a huge
pain (and I still can't figure out win we
had to do that — couldn't thev have just
kept the old numbers?), but it was worth
it. Willi mote space than most one bed
room apartments in Palo Alto, the new
boxes are < lean and shiny and private.
No window where everyone can look
inside to see if I have mail, and now it's a
big surprise when I put in m\ key, turn
the lo( k. and open the box to see if there's
something behind door number 15402
sometimes I'm lucky, and sometimes
I'm not. I lie box iiself is huge compared
to the old ones — even big enough for a
(yl) from cdnow.com! I hat makes lilc
good. It's something to be happy about.
As lor servite, that's where I get most
ton I used with all the recent criticism. As a
recent discoverer of eßay and an Kast
Coaster with parents who feel compelled
to send me boxes of food in what they
in list perceive to be a fdodless California,
I have packages to pick up almost twice a
week. This is the weird part: no line. Seri
ously, I in a bit frightened to go into the
post office now. I'm so alone. It doesn't
matter if it's lunch time oi just before 5
p.in. — rarely is there anyone in line.
I he scene is nothing like the commit

nist-era bread lines that used to wrap
around White Plaza like a photo from the
1994 elections in South Africa. 1 actually
miss watching professors crumble as they
were yelled at by angry postal people
(well, one in particular), or the meek little
freshman who, only trying to buy a
stamp, broke down into tears because she
had to go to fhe end of the line (which
was near |amba Juice) and fill out a form.
I've even hit the jackpot three times in
the past three weeks— I opened my box
lo find ,i key to an even bigger locker with
inv parcel. And not even a line!
Like an Kcon 1 problem set, efficiency
rules at the Postal lent nowadays. Kssen
fialh non-existent lines if anyone remem
bers the bad old days, postal people who
actually are chill with their customers,
and big shiny boxes with sharp gold keys
.ill make the post office better.
Still, continuing with efficiency —
granted n is a federal offense and all, but
apparently some allege that the post
office even selects which mail I need to
receive. Now, I guess they think I don't
need m\ Kconomist this week, but thank
goodness they made sure to include my
copy ol Link; forget about my voter's reg
istration stuff, but here's an important
birthday card from Aunt Clarice.
And they even pose for pictures! I had
no idea Big Brother was so nice. I hope
he likes the cookies my dad sent last week
.md in.ikes good use of the passport that
I sent out for \isa stamps a month ago.
lie knows what's better for us;. I guess
he'll dec ide if I'm not supposed to go on
that research trip this summer after all.
In post-Cold War America (where con
spiracy is met with disdain), the post
office should be a little more careful.
Admittedly, the post office is an insti
tution we love to hate; I don't think that
the consensus of University opinion
towards the post office would change
even if we had free express mail, a lounge
with foit\ working stamp machines and
I x»\cs the size of a Lagtmita double.
I do not condone the selective mail dis
posal service that the post office seems to
be providing at no extra charge, but I clo
note the other changes. 1 guess I'm one of
the lucky ones who gets his mail on time
and (rarely) has an issue. It's ac tually kind
of sad that going to the post office is no
longer the event it used to be, but the off
road biking area in the mud by the pines
nearby is a definite plus.

Presently, he's enjoying the sun try the new
Robinson third floor pool while working on
econometrics and enjoying, as Stroke 9 would
say, certain people's "nasty little thoughts."
