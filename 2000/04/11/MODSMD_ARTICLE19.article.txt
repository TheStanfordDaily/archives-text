Recent graduate supports Senior Gift
I am writing in response to Rachel Sal
berg and Alix McCown's recent letter
regarding the Senior Gift campaign.
Ms. Salberg and Ms. McCown are
upset by the Senior Gift. They are horri
fied that people they knew have called
them asking them to give money back to
the University. They are appalled that the
Senior Gift is symbolic, and that the
money given to the Senior Gift is actually
a "cleverly disguised" gift that goes to The
Stanford Fund — used to fund under
graduate education, URO grants, finan
cial aid, student groups and more. 1 hope
they don't know that a gift of $20 is
quadrupled by generous donors. I'm sure
that would upset them too.
I like to go out to eat with friends.
When we do go out, at the end of the
meal, we like to say thanks to our server
and the restaurant for an enjoyable din
ing experience. How do we say thanks?
We tip.
We know we have to pay our bill, but we
also always like to give a little extra. It's a
common courtesy. We think 15 percent is
a good tip to give (18 percent for parties of
eight or more). This is just our way of say
ing thanks for the service, thanks for caring
about us, thanks for giving me something I

wanted. Thanks for a great time.
I look at the Senior Gift the same way.
It's like a tip. Sure, 1 don't have to tip
Stanford, but I want to. I want to say,
"thanks." Stanford clearly served a party
of eight or more (closer to 1,600 in the
class of 2000) and, as a common courtesy,
a tip of 18 percent would be appreciated.
But in this case, you aren't asked to tip 18
percent, instead you each are asked to tip
.017 percent (or about $20). That sounds
pretty good to me. Stanford served me a
great meal, and this is just a very small
way to say thank you.
When 1 tip at a restaurant, there is one
thing I never do. I never say, "Excuse me,
Chris, thanks for being our server. You
did a great job. Here is a tip of .017 per
cent for you. Oh, and by the way, don't
spend it all in one place. And, you know
what, I'd prefer if you didn't spend it on
plates, better food, a fresh coat of paint or
use it to reduce the bill of your next cus
tomer. I don't want them to have any
more than I did." I don't want to be that
customer.
But, then again, I really don't know my
server, so who cares if I tip or not? Heck,
I paid for my meal, why give more?
Unlike my relationship with my server,
however, I do know Stanford. If someone
I know calls me and asks me to give back,
1 will.

If someone I don't know asks me to
give back to Stanford, I will. Salberg and
McCown said that if anyone from the
Stanford Fund called them and asked for
money they would, "be irritated and most
likely refuse to give." When one of their
friends calls from Senior Gift and asks
them to tip Stanford, they lose "a lot of
respect for [that] senior."
Maybe we should have someone who
they don't know and who is not affiliated
with Stanford call them and ask them to
reach into their pockets and just give a bit.
A homeless man would be good. Oh wait,
maybe that would just upset them too.
What if someone actually approached Sal
berg and McCown on the street and
asked them for .017 percent of what they
had in their pocket? I'm sure they would
fly off the handle. Maybe they would even
write a letter.
As you're coming to the end of your
meal, take a moment to think about leav
ing a tip for Stanford. Maybe your meal
had some low points — that is under-!
standable and expected, but I encourage
you to leave a tip in hopes that those who
come after you have the opportunity to
make the most out of their meal.

Class of 1999-
Senior Gift student chairs
respond to criticism
As the student chairs of the Class of
2000 Senior Gift Campaign, we would
like to respond to Rachel Salberg and
Alix McCown's letter, published on April
6 ("Seniors disappointed with Senior
Gift campaign"). While we appreciate
and understand the feedback, we must
wholeheartedly disagree with many of
the points raised by the letter. Fortu
nately, we believe that it will be relative
ly easy to solve the miscommunications
responsible for Salberg and McCown's
negative reaction to the campaign.
First, solicitation for Senior Gift is in
no way a "cleverly disguised contribu
tion to The Stanford Fund." While it is a
contribution to The Stanford Fund, it is

by no means a ruse or a trick, as the
authors imply. All committee members
are instructed to explain outright that
the gift goes through The Stanford
Fund, the organization designed to pro
vide for financial aid and undergraduate
education through donations like Senior
Gift.
We simply feel that the most effective
and efficient way for seniors to support
our school is by giving back to our
undergraduate community. Let us be
clear: all of the money goes to under
graduate education — ethnic communi
ty centers, URO grants and new teach
ing initiatives — and financial aid for
students who cannot afford all that Stan
ford has to offer.
Second, many students mistakenly
believe that Senior (lift is a physical
object like a bench or a statue. It is not;
it is a monetary donation to The Stan
ford Fund. This is also made clear in the
solicitation process. More often than not,
seniors agree that providing need-blind
admissions through financial aid pro

grams and improving the quality of
undergraduate education are more ben
eficial to Stanford than erecting another
statue. The gift is not "purely symbolic;"
it is the best gift that we could hope to
give back to our school.
Third, Senior Gift is a complicated
fundraising venture, and it demands
large-scale communication efforts on
our part. This means telephone calls,
mailings and a presence in White Plaza
that may seem overwhelming. Believe
us, if there was an easier way to do it, we
would sign up.
The authors also take affront to us
calling our old frosh dorms, calling it an
insulting and disappointing tactic. Please
keep in mind that we are students driv
ing this campaign. We would simply pre
fer calling our friends and people we
know to calling strangers. We realize
that the system has its cracks and that
our actions may not be sharpened to
perfection, but, with insightful criticism,
we strive to improve the process.
Finally, one fact that the letter brings

to light is the extremely negative regard
in which many students hold The Stan
ford Fund. Nobody likes being asked for
money, and most folks don't much like
asking for it either.
But the Senior Gift campaign is
unique in that it is driven by your fellow
classmates. It is a Stanford tradition, and
a worthwhile one. It is meant to establish
a tradition of giving back to our school,
which, like it or not, is a necessity for a
major research University to be able to
maintain excellence in undergraduate
education.
We hope that this response clears up
any misunderstandings about Senior
Gift. We are open to feedback about
improving the campaign and we invite
seniors to contact us with further con
cerns.

that would upset them too.
I like to go out to eat with friends.
When we do go out, at the end of the
meal, we like to say thanks to our server
and the restaurant for an enjoyable din
ing experience. How do we say thanks?
We tip.
We know we have to pay our bill, but we
also always like to give a little extra. It's a
common courtesy. We think 15 percent is
a good tip to give (18 percent for parties of
eight or more). This is just our way of say
ing thanks for the service, thanks for caring
about us, thanks for giving me something I

wanted. Thanks for a great time.
I look at the Senior Gift the same way.
It's like a tip. Sure, 1 don't have to tip
Stanford, but I want to. I want to say,
"thanks." Stanford clearly served a party
of eight or more (closer to 1,600 in the
class of 2000) and, as a common courtesy,
a tip of 18 percent would be appreciated.
But in this case, you aren't asked to tip 18
percent, instead you each are asked to tip
.017 percent (or about $20). That sounds
pretty good to me. Stanford served me a
great meal, and this is just a very small
way to say thank you.
When 1 tip at a restaurant, there is one
thing I never do. I never say, "Excuse me,
Chris, thanks for being our server. You
did a great job. Here is a tip of .017 per
cent for you. Oh, and by the way, don't
spend it all in one place. And, you know
what, I'd prefer if you didn't spend it on
plates, better food, a fresh coat of paint or
use it to reduce the bill of your next cus
tomer. I don't want them to have any
more than I did." I don't want to be that
customer.
But, then again, I really don't know my
server, so who cares if I tip or not? Heck,
I paid for my meal, why give more?
Unlike my relationship with my server,
however, I do know Stanford. If someone
I know calls me and asks me to give back,
1 will.

If someone I don't know asks me to
give back to Stanford, I will. Salberg and
McCown said that if anyone from the
Stanford Fund called them and asked for
money they would, "be irritated and most
likely refuse to give." When one of their
friends calls from Senior Gift and asks
them to tip Stanford, they lose "a lot of
respect for [that] senior."
Maybe we should have someone who
they don't know and who is not affiliated
with Stanford call them and ask them to
reach into their pockets and just give a bit.
A homeless man would be good. Oh wait,
maybe that would just upset them too.
What if someone actually approached Sal
berg and McCown on the street and
asked them for .017 percent of what they
had in their pocket? I'm sure they would
fly off the handle. Maybe they would even
write a letter.
As you're coming to the end of your
meal, take a moment to think about leav
ing a tip for Stanford. Maybe your meal
had some low points — that is under-!
standable and expected, but I encourage
you to leave a tip in hopes that those who
come after you have the opportunity to
make the most out of their meal.

Senior Gift student chairs
respond to criticism
As the student chairs of the Class of
2000 Senior Gift Campaign, we would
like to respond to Rachel Salberg and
Alix McCown's letter, published on April
6 ("Seniors disappointed with Senior
Gift campaign"). While we appreciate
and understand the feedback, we must
wholeheartedly disagree with many of
the points raised by the letter. Fortu
nately, we believe that it will be relative
ly easy to solve the miscommunications
responsible for Salberg and McCown's
negative reaction to the campaign.
First, solicitation for Senior Gift is in
no way a "cleverly disguised contribu
tion to The Stanford Fund." While it is a
contribution to The Stanford Fund, it is

by no means a ruse or a trick, as the
authors imply. All committee members
are instructed to explain outright that
the gift goes through The Stanford
Fund, the organization designed to pro
vide for financial aid and undergraduate
education through donations like Senior
Gift.
We simply feel that the most effective
and efficient way for seniors to support
our school is by giving back to our
undergraduate community. Let us be
clear: all of the money goes to under
graduate education — ethnic communi
ty centers, URO grants and new teach
ing initiatives — and financial aid for
students who cannot afford all that Stan
ford has to offer.
Second, many students mistakenly
believe that Senior (lift is a physical
object like a bench or a statue. It is not;
it is a monetary donation to The Stan
ford Fund. This is also made clear in the
solicitation process. More often than not,
seniors agree that providing need-blind
admissions through financial aid pro

grams and improving the quality of
undergraduate education are more ben
eficial to Stanford than erecting another
statue. The gift is not "purely symbolic;"
it is the best gift that we could hope to
give back to our school.
Third, Senior Gift is a complicated
fundraising venture, and it demands
large-scale communication efforts on
our part. This means telephone calls,
mailings and a presence in White Plaza
that may seem overwhelming. Believe
us, if there was an easier way to do it, we
would sign up.
The authors also take affront to us
calling our old frosh dorms, calling it an
insulting and disappointing tactic. Please
keep in mind that we are students driv
ing this campaign. We would simply pre
fer calling our friends and people we
know to calling strangers. We realize
that the system has its cracks and that
our actions may not be sharpened to
perfection, but, with insightful criticism,
we strive to improve the process.
Finally, one fact that the letter brings

to light is the extremely negative regard
in which many students hold The Stan
ford Fund. Nobody likes being asked for
money, and most folks don't much like
asking for it either.
But the Senior Gift campaign is
unique in that it is driven by your fellow
classmates. It is a Stanford tradition, and
a worthwhile one. It is meant to establish
a tradition of giving back to our school,
which, like it or not, is a necessity for a
major research University to be able to
maintain excellence in undergraduate
education.
We hope that this response clears up
any misunderstandings about Senior
Gift. We are open to feedback about
improving the campaign and we invite
seniors to contact us with further con
cerns.

Recent graduate supports Senior Gift
I am writing in response to Rachel Sal
berg and Alix McCown's recent letter
regarding the Senior Gift campaign.
Ms. Salberg and Ms. McCown are
upset by the Senior Gift. They are horri
fied that people they knew have called
them asking them to give money back to
the University. They are appalled that the
Senior Gift is symbolic, and that the
money given to the Senior Gift is actually
a "cleverly disguised" gift that goes to The
Stanford Fund — used to fund under
graduate education, URO grants, finan
cial aid, student groups and more. 1 hope
they don't know that a gift of $20 is
quadrupled by generous donors. I'm sure
that would upset them too.
I like to go out to eat with friends.
