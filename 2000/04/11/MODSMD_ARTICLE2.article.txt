which are priceless to both the

that the I niversitv's lands are

The letter called for Stanford to "act with integrity for the
long-term good of the community, exemplifying the values it
seeks to impart to its students."

The University's draft plan allocates approximately two
million square feet for new housing units targeted to accom
modate the burgeoning demand for graduate and faculty
housing.
The plan also apportions land for more than a million
square feet of "academic space," including a new basketball
arena that would seat 12.000 fans and a possible Palo Alto-
Stanford performing arts center..
In total, Stanford plans to increase its physical plant by
about 4 million square feet over the next decade, which trans
lates to a one-third increase of its current size. I his increase
would be equivalent to three Stanford Shopping (Centers.

Alliance spokesman Peter
1 )rekineicr said the organization's
primal \ <>1 > jit tion to the draft ol

the (leneral I se Permit was the
la< k of permanent open-space
protection.
Stanford's current land use
proposal would reclassify the
Stanford Foothills as "Academic
Reserve," meaning that they
would be open to future develop
ment.
I he alliance requests that "all
the lands southwest of (unipero
Sena Boulevard — the Foothills,
which are priceless to both the
I niversity and the region—as
permanent open space."
"II the Trust is believed not to
permit permanent dedication,"
the letter continues, "a 99-year
commitment would be a good
start."
I he alliance also calls for the
I niversit) to protect as much
open space as possible in other
areas of the campus, "recognizing
that open space is not a 'frill' in
comparison with the 'basics' of
bigger labs and spoi is facilities."
Casper's statement maintains
that Stanford "welcomes the opin
ions ol its alumni in issues til im
portance to the university" and
recognizes that the Foothills area
is "an important habitat for
w ildlilc and an area of great rustic
beauty."

However, Casper regrets that
"it is disheartening to see Stan
lord's position on the Foothills
and the Ceneral I se Permit so
thoioughlv distorted b\ our crit
ics."
Casper's statement points out
that the I niversitv's lands are
held in trust to further its academ
ic mission, and "to permanently
designate an\ lands for any other
purpose would be contrary to the
Stanfords' Founding (.rant.
"Stanford has been a more re-'
sponsible steward of its lands than
virtually anvbody else on the
Peninsula," Casper said. "The
preservation of open spacedid not
happen bv act ident; ii results from
careful planning."
However, Drekmeiei accuses
the University of renaming areas
that they want to develop in order
to dupe the public.
"Caspei says that there will be
no development in the Foothills
area, Drekincier explains. "But
what he does not mention is that
the region that is termed the
Foothills keeps on decreasing
every year."

of the Ceneral I se Permit for
putting their short-term interest
