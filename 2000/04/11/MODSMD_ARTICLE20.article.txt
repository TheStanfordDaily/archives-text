with the I niversity, the book de

campus architecture, landscap
ing and planning.
Architectural historian
Ric hard | oncas, I niversity Archi
tect David Neuman and Art Prof .
Paul I tuner collaborated on the
book, which presents the arc hi
tectural features of each campus
building and disc usses their sig
nificance to the overall plan.
I he book begins with an inlro
duction by President (•erhard
(laspei <uid a brief introduction
by (oncas. It also includes an essay
by l ui tier on the c ampus's place
in architectural historv and a
piece by Neuman on campus
wide planning in the 21st ccntu
ry.
Seven sections, each detailing
a different time period, comprise
the rest of the book. Kacli sec lion
includes several photographs of
the significant buildings con
strue ted during that era as well as
;i map of c ampus developments.
I he book lonised 011 "to what
extent the I niversity c ampus was
a realization ol the Stanfbrds'
original dream," said (oncas.
"| We looked at | the planning, the
landscaping and the buildings."
Leland and Jane Stanford
worked c losely with the architects
,ind designers of the Main Quad,
ordering the architects to change
the plans because they were un
satisfactory.
"We were surprised In how
consistently the I niversitvdid ir\
to replicate the Quad, said (on
cas. "There appears to be a
hodgepodge ol buildings and ar
c hitet lure, bin undei l\ ing that,
there is an ok lei ilial | isn't | ap
parent."
According lo Jonc as, the Main
Quad is a "t(>ugh" struc lure lo

complement architecturally be
cause the design is formal, well
articulated and aesthetically com
plete, He explained that ii was
often too cosily or difficult lo ex
actly replicate the Quad in later
buildings, although the designers
tried.
"Subsequent buildings are in
terpretations of the Quad," Jon
cas said.
linnet's earliet book, "The
Founders and the Architects,"
served as one inspiration for this
project.
"The Founders and the Arc hi
tects" details the architecture of
the I niversiiy's founding build
ings and describes the extended
debate between the Stanlbrds
and the arc hitec Is w ho designed
the campus.
Neuman began to research
the rest of Stanford's arc hitec tur
al history. Ile and |oik as li.kl
planned to publish a small guide
b( )ok.
I inner then linked then pro
ject with Princeton I Diversity
Press, which had published simi
lar guides for Yale University and
the I niversity of Virginia. Ihe
three began a more ambitious
project will) the publishei.
According to (oncas, 11 u-\ per
formed most ol ilic it research in
the I niversity archives. "We
looked ,n leilcrs, old Dailies and
everything thai was accessible,"
he said.
