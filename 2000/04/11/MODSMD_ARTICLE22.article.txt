## Track dominates relays 
### CHRISTOPHER LYLE contributing; WRITER 
The Cardinal relied oil strong
performances in the relays and
field events to produce high marks
at the Hayward Relays in Eugene,
Ore.
Over 4,000 spectators turned
out to watch Stanford, Colorado
State, Colorado, Washington, Ore
gon, and others compete in the city
with the nickname "Tracktown,
USA." Eugene is home to several
important running events
throughout the year, including the
Pacific 10 Outdoor Championship
Meet in May.
"The meet was a great success
for us," head coach Vin Lananna
said. "We got to run several relays
and compete in the same place that
the Pac 10s will be held. It was a re
ally good opportunity."
The Hayward Relays were not
scored, so no team placement is
available, but Stanford athletes
produced very strong individual
results.
Sophomore Danielle Spurhxk
turned in a NCAA qualifying time
and one of the meet's best perfor
mances in the 400-meter interme

diate hurdles. Spurlock recorded a
time of 1 minute, 1.82 seconds in
her first place finish. I lei time was
also a personal record. Sophomore
Robin Woolfblk also scored in the
event with a fourth place finish in
1:03.51.
The women also got some help
in the sprints from juniors Jayna
Smith and Wilsa Charles. The duo
finished third and fourth, respec -
tively, in the 200-meter dash.
Smith recorded a time of 24.40 sec
onds, and Charles a 24.09.
The distance relays provided
further stimulus for the women's
effort. The 4xBoo-meter relav fin
ished first in a time of 8:43.07.
Freshman Malindi Elmore led oil
the relay with a very strong 2:09.80
split. The relay time also broke the
previous meet record. I he
women's distance medley relay fin
ished second with a time of
I 1:26.65 behind (Colorado.
The Stanford women were es
pecially productive in the field
events, producing two first place
and two second plat e finishes. Se
nior Summer Pierson earned one
of the firsts with a throw of 17;i.23
feet in the discuss. Freshman Kim
Stone gathered the other first in

the high jump with her jump of
;>. / 4.
I'll the pole vault, freshman
Kathleen Donoghue vaulted a
strong 12.47 to finish second. Se
nior Chi-Chi Onyeagbako threw
the hammer 172.05 to earn a sec

I lic men exhibited similar suc -
cess. Hie distance relays were a
source of great success lor the (lar
dinal. Sophomore (labe Jennings
and juniors Michael Stemher and
Ryan Carroll led both the 4xBoo
- relav and the distance med
ley relay to first place finishes. In
both events, Stanford significantly
outpaced the competition. I lie
