### MATT MCQUINN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The N0.6 Stanford Women's golf team finished
sixth on Sunday at the Ping/Arizona State Invita
tional in Tetnpe, AZ. The Cardinal, coming oil two
stellar second-place finishes, posted its worst finish of
the Spring season.
The team finished with a three-day 897, twenty
five strokes behind the victor, No. I Arizona. I he host
team, Arizona State, came in as the runner-up with an
875.
This tournament convened all the Pacific 10 Con
ference teams except Washington State, along with a
few other competitive Division I schools across the na
tion.
"We are all disappointed," freshman Kim Rowton
said. "We could have done much better."
In the last several tournaments, every member on
the Cardinal team has proved capable of producing
the scores necessary for the team to advance deep into
postseason play.
juniors Hilary Homeyer and Stephanie Keever
are ranked No. 1 1 and No. 17 in the nation, respec
tively. These two players have led the team in the past
and will be the foundation for any future Cardinal
success.
Still, Homeyer and Keever need support from the
rest of the team for the Cardinal to be competitive.
The potential performance of the entire team was
demonstrated last weekend at the par-72 Karsten golf
course when every Cardinal player posted at least one
score that was no higher than a 75.
This includes senior JaeJean Ro's team-leading 72
on Friday. Ro has demonstrated her ability to be a
lethal scoring threat in the past, as witnessed in her
second place finish in the Stanford-SJSI Desert Dual
