### MATT LONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sunday morning in the heat of Madera, the
No. 21 Stanford men's golf team demonstrat
ed just how potent it can be when all facets of
its game come together.
Flie University of Pacific floated in the C Car
dinal's wake as the squad waltzed around the
Tiger's home course. Five of eight Stanford
duffers shot under par in the first round of the
36 hole dual match, leading the way to a 31.5
to 4.5 victory at River Bend golf course.
Dominating River Bend not only provided
the Cardinal with a match play win, but also
built the team's confidence as the course will

serve as the site <>l ilie NCAA Wesi Regional.
May 18-20.
Stanford has already qualified lor ilie Re
gional, where it will face I K oilier teams in u y -
ing to gain its Hi si berth in the NCAA Nation
al Finals since 1991).
"In the first round we played as good as we
have played all year," said junior Alex Aragon.
"Everyone's been playing well in practice
rounds and qualifiers but then at the t <>illl la
ments we don't score well. I his definitely
gives us some momentum."
Freshman Jim Seki led the pack at the par
-72 course by shooting a 07 in the morning and
a 70 later in the day.
Also breaking par in I he first I <S holes were

juniors |iunn\ Fee (OS) and Aiagon (7 I), se
nioi captain Dustv Brett (09) and Ireslunan
(leorge Downing (70). Aragon, Seki and
Downing each finished undei par on Ihe day,
a remarkable accomplishment for two rounds
with the narrow fairways and tlii< k roughs.
"I thought I played vers well, said Seki.
"Before I was not reall\ slumping, but had a
down time. | I his weekend] I hit the ball well
and my pulling really improved.''
Now thai springtime weather seems to have
come to slay and day light savings is in full ef
fect, the team has been able to prad ire without
the rain and cold deterring its development.
"We really put the business to
them out there," said head coach
Walk (•oodwiu.
I was very impressed with our
improvement now that we've got
a chance to practice a hit more. It
looks like our prat tites are paying
oil."
While driving and the long
irons have never seemed to both
er the team ninth, the quality ol
Stanford's short game was recent-

Iv questioned as a result of last
weekend's putting mishaps at the
Far West Intercollegiate in Santa
Cruz.
This weekend the Cardinal
squad finally Ibund its elusive
putter.
"Our short game was picking
up," Goodwin said. "We're
putting much better and we'll
continue to work on that. But
the key when we get to the re
gional will be driving, because
you have to hit the ball in the
fairway [at River Bend), because
the rough is so bad you can't gel
out of it."
Aragon concurred.

"Personally, I've been hitting
the ball well this quarter, but
everyone's short game needs
work," Aragon said.
Saturday the Cardinal will face
BYU, ranked sixth nationally, in
Provo, Utah.
1 he last dual match of the sea
son tor Stanford should give the
freshmen another chance to play
against top competition, as well as
allow the team to find the consis
tency it needs to fare well in the
NCAAs.
"We had great play Sunday
with some excellent scores,"
Coodwin said. "Hi it we're not as
good as we're gonna be.*
