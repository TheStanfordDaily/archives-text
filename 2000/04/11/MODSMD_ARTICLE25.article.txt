Now, 11i;it s more like it!
I lie No. 9 Stanford Softball
team deserves .ill the glory, pomp
and circumstance home on the
Farm this week alter daring to
beat the "unbeatable" Sunday in
front of a thunderous crowd of
1,200 Arizona fans.
Wildcats supporters watched
in disbelief as Stanford bulldozed
their No. 2 Arizona team, winning
l-!l in .m eight inning, head-split
ting, nail-bitting, downright in
tense sofiball dual.
Stanford (3,' M), 2-0 Pacific 10
Conference) slashed its live-game
l'ac-10 losing streak in the match
up and tai nished Arizona's previ
ously perfect conference record.
I he weekend, however, didn't
start out as positive!) .is it finished.
Before its big win on Sunday,
the (lai (linal chopped a i lose one
in No. 1 Arizona State Friday
evening in I cnipc. 3-2, and lost its
first game against No. 2 Arizona
Saturday, <S~4.
I)cspite its promisingearl\ lead
and two solid doubles by sopho
more short-stop Robin Walker in
Friday's contest, Stanford just
couldn't seem to sti ing together a
set ics of hits in a single inning.
Freshman Dana Sorensen (10-
5) pitched the bulk of the game,
striking out lour and allow ing one
earned run, until freshman Fori
Nyberg came in in the sixth.
Initially, Saturday's game
seemed reminiscent ol the five-in
ning blow-out by No. I ('.FA List
weekend.
I his time a proud and deter
mined Stanford squad refused to
throw in the towel and lay down
and take the first-inning four-run
beating.
Arizona dominated the first
half of the game, scoring lour in
the first, two in the second, and
one in both the fourth and fifth.
"I was very impressed with
their patience of their hitters,"
said Sorensen who pitched Sun
day's game against the Wildcats.
"The) are just a tremendous of
fensive power."
Just as .Arizona's bats started to
quiet clown, Stanford finally de

cided to make some noise and
post two runs in the fifth.
Sophomore center-fielder Jes
sica Mendoza sparkled at the plate
with two singles and two doubles,
going four-for-f'our on the day.
In the seventh, Stanford
threatened again with two addi
tional runs on an Arizona error
and two runners in scoring posi
tions.
I fowever, Arizona pitcher Jen
nie Finch, arguably the top pitch
er in the conference with an un
blemished record of 20-0,
squelched any chance at a Stan
ford comeback, ending the game
with two strike-outs.
"I was most proud of our team
during that game," said Rittman.
"It was very similar to the UCLA
match-up as far as how many runs
thev were scoring, but this time we
fought back. That is very encour
aging to see as a coach."
Stanford refused to go home
with three more losses under its
belt, but it was not easy to squeeze
a win out of the No. 2 team in the
country, whom it has only beaten
once before in the twenty-two
times it has played Arizona.
Sorensen pitched again for the
Cardinal and gave up two runs in
the first.
But, the Stanford offense
w hic h had been struggling signifi
cantly prior to this weekend put it
together in the fourth with a
three-run homer by sophomore
first-baseman Sarah Beeson.
In the fifth, Arizona tied it up at
three with two outs, taking the
game to extra innings.
Walker walked to lead the top
of the eighth and was replaced by
pinch-runner Deborah Splansky.
Another walk and several fielder's
choice hits moved Splansky
around the bases and scored the
winning run.
"It was an awesome team ef
fort." said Sorensen. "Beeson's
three-run homer gave us the con
fidence we needed. The night be
fore we scored four in one inning,
land) I think we all realized,
'Who's to say they are a better
team? We can beat them.'"
Mendoza was named l'ac-10
player of the week after her in
credible effort at the plate this
weekend in Arizona, hitting (i for 7
Saturday and Sunday and tallying
l<(in doubles, two singles, and one
run scored over the course oft.be
two days.
kill man was very impressed
with his entire team's offensive
come-back considering the slumps
and struggles tb.it have inflicted
the line-up over the past couple of
weeks.

"We have a lot to build on after
this weekend," said Rittman.
"We've been working extra hard
on offense, going back to the ba
sics. I think we hit the ball rela
tively well, although our defense
let us down a bit.'"
"But Arizona plays a tough
short game, with team speed,
ships, and bunts. It puts a lot of
pressure on the opposing de
fense."
I lie team is currently l-;i in
one-run conference games. Still,
as head coach John Rittman point
ed out, if one or two of those close
games had ended up in Stanford's
favor, the team's conference

record would look a whole lot
more impressive.
In other words, the difference
between a conference record of 2-
6 or T4 is sometimes just a matter
of a little luck, a couple errors and
a few swings of the bat.
After soaking up all the fanfare
of beating N0.2 Arizona, Stanford
will be back in practice Tuesday,
preparing to face-off with Oregon
and Oregon State this next week
end.
"In this conference there are no
let-down games. No time off.
Kvery game is a battle. But, I'm
confident we're up to the chal
lenge."
