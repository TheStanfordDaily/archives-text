W hat a difference a month makes.
I he last time the No. ~> Stanford base
ball team faced San Jose Slate, it hadn't
scored ten inns since the lit si game of the
season. But tonight, the( Cardinal travels to
San Jose's Municipal Stadium in the midst
of an ollensise explosion that lias put dou
ble-digit runs on the scoreboard in Stan
ford's lasi lour games.
Stanford ('J.')-!), (">-!? Pacific 10 Confer
ence) has left its woes at the plate behind to
regain the form that made ii one of the na
tion's most feared atta< ks in the preseason.
( her ihe weekend, the (Cardinal tallied 41
inns against conference opponent W ash
ington State.
After Friday night's win over the
Cougars in Pullman, Wash., head coach
Mark Marquess was encouraged by the
suddenly potent Stanford lineup.
"I hope we can continue to swing the
balsas well as we have been lately," he said,
offeriugan understated compliment toliis
squad's recent barrage on opposing piu h
ing si.tils.
I lie talented ni<> ol seniors John (>all
and Kdinund Muth and junioi Joe Bor
c hard lias < ombined lor '24 home runs and
I 10 KB Is 111 is season. Call earned Pa< -10
Player ol the Week honors fbi billing 12-
lor-18 with three homers and 1 I KBIs in
four games last week. I le leads the team in

batting average (.!ib2) and RBIs (42).
While Marquess led his team to victo
ries in eight of its last 10 ballgames,
tonight's opponent has done the same.
I he Spartans (25-1 I, I 1-4 Western Athlet
ic Conference) lead their conference on
the strength of theit pitching staff, which
carries eight hurlers with KRAs less than
4.00.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, tonight's
probable San Jose State starter is not one
of them. Junior Chris Sherman has com
piled a 15-4 record on the season in I 1 ap
pearances.
However, Sherman's seven starts for
San Jose State this season rank third on
the team and in bis last outing one week
ago, Sherman impressed with 2/'i in
nings of scoreless relief against I lawaii-Pa
c i tic.
After a weekend in which Stanford re
ceived 2.'i out of 27 innings from its stall
ing pitchers, Marquess will have plenty of
arms to choose from tonight. As he usual
ly does, the head coach should be expec t
ed to employ a handful of (lardinal relies -
ers to give each of them more work on the
mound.
In six mid-week games ibis season, at
least lour Stanford pitchers have ap
peared on live occasions, and tonight's
match-up at Municipal Stadium should
not prove to be any different.
Sophomores Jason I.uker and Mike
Wodnic ki are two candidates out of the

bullpen thai should expect to see some in
nings and attempt to keep the Spartan of
fense in cheek.
Fellow sophomore Dan Rich nia\ not
be the most popular choice to work lor
Marquess, as hall of the eight runs he has

allowed to date tame at the hands ol Spar
tan junior John Fagan.On Feb. 29, lagan
blasted a grand slam oil a 1-0 Rich fastball
to win the Spartans' earlier meeting with
the (Cardinal at Sunken Diamond.
F.ven if the same ineffectiveness

plagues one or two Cardinal pitchers
tonight, the lively Stanford offense is
poised to deliver a much improved offen
sive performance from last meeting and
overcome any pitching issues Stanford
may encounter.
