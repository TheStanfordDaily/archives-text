Domination isn't usually a word to be taken
Ii 14111J\. ()ii(scoring a team 11 -0 o\er a three-game
span, as was the rase last weekend up in Pullman,
would not he taking it lightly.
Harked l>\ strong pitching perlormances from

liain, the (Cardinal (2. r >- ( .), 0-!t Pacific-10 (ionference)
throttled the ( ougai s (I 1-22, 2-7) in a three-game
sci us, sweeping .ill three games to hump its Pac-10
record to ('•-!» and jump i ight hack into the race for
the conference title.
I he ( ardinal is now tied l<>i third with Ari/.ona
State, with I S( in set ond place and I ( \ A at the
topwith one game separating Sianlord from first
place.
I is hard to deride who looked more impressive
ovei the weekend, the pit< liing or the hitting, hut
the vole here is lot the pitching, junior righthander
|»istill Wavne. coining oil a week in which he was
named Pac-10 Pitehei ol the Year, showed he
wasn i going I.ill oil Iroin the aina/ing form he has
sin>w n all \eai.
Wavne went eight solid innings, allowing three
runs and striking out 10 W'Sl hitlers, as Stanford
won I lie opeilei I 1:1. Even on a da) when hew asn't
bringing his hest heal lo the plale, Wax lie was able
to rel\ on his slide i and ( urve to Muster the Cougar
hittei s.
I adualh didn'i have a great last hall today,"
said Wayne. "However, I knew that I could get
these gll\s out on oil speed pin lies and that's what
I was able lo do.
lor Sianlord head coach Mark Marquess, ii was
jusi typical Justin W.ivnc, regardless ol whether he
bad his best stuff.
| list in W a\ lie was phenomenal, but thai doesn't
sin prise me be< ause lie's pitched that way all year,"
said Marquess. 11 was nice to give him a little bit of
i mi support ioda\."
Not surprisingly, most of that ollctise canie from
the bat ol senioi third baseman John Call, yvho has
been hilling ilie cover oil the baseball recently. Call
went :Übr-:> on die niglii with a double and two
RBI, helping Sianlord put up seven runs in the lifth
inning alone while knoc king overman lied YVSIJ
siarlei I odd Mehdahl out of die game.
Score: 10-'i, and an\ douhl ol (he game's out
come had conipleteh been removed by the Cardi

nal. Freshman Jason Cooper added a pinch-hit
three-i un double in the eighth in his first ret urn to
his home stale- as a member of the (lardinal.
Alter watching Wayne's performance from the
dugout Friday. Jason Young look to the hill Satur
day apparently primed to out-do his teammate.
Young went <S innings as well, but struck out a
whopping I") halters as Stanford took the second
game of die series I l-.'i. Young's 15 k's are a season
high for the Cardinal pitching staff, but was three
short of the all-time Stanford record of I<S, set by
Sieve 1 hiiining in 1970.
"This wasjason Young's best ouiingol die year,"
s;lid XTarquess. "I think it's obvious he is back in
good health. 1 le had an excellent fastball today."
"I was happy with my performance," added
Young. "I had all of my pitches going and was lo
cating the ball well."
Stanford's offensive explosion on Saturday was
led by senior centerfielder Edmund Muth, who
went 3-tbr-5 on the day with a double, a homer and
an RBI.
Joe Bore hard also continued his hot hitting of
late with a three-run homer in the first inning, his
eighth ol the year and fifth in l'ac-10 play.
WSU's supposed ace, Matt ()'Brien, entered the
game with a 0-1 record and 2.51 ERA, only to be
buried under an avalanche of 10 hits which ac -
counted lor six (Cardinal runs and sent liiin to the
showers alter die sixth inning, giving him the loss.
Scoring I 1 runs two consecutive games must
have gotten old for the Stanford offense, because on
Sunday' the Card topped itsell by scoring 10 unan
swered runs as freshman Tim Cunningham
blanked W'Sl' for seven innings, giving Sianlord a
I f>-0 win and a sweep of the series.
Mike Cosling and |efl' Bruksch added scoreless
innings of their own in the eighth and ninth as the
pitching stall threw its second shutout ol the year.
I'yson I honipson attempted to stop the Stan
lord hitters and failed miserable, giving up eight
runs-ill only two innings of work for the loss.
For what seems like the millionth time this sea
son, Call's bat did most of the damage from the
plate. I he senior from f'ortola Valley dropped a '.\-
for-4 day with a homer and three RBI on the
Cougars, an eflort when capped a phenomenal
week lor Call and earned him Pac-10 Conference
Player of the Week honors. During the week,
against WSU and Sacramento Stale, Call went 12-
for-18 (.007) with three doubles, three home runs,
and 1 I runs batted in.
Stanford next takes on San Jose State in a non
conference battle 1 uesday before Washington
comes to Sunken Diamond for a three-game set
starting Friday night.
