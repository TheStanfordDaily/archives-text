Google is a leading Internet search en
gine. Its Page Rank technology allows it to
return relevant search results b\ assessing
each page's "importance." As opposed to
Yahoo!, Google is not a portal. Google
doesn't intend to add additional services
and features to the site such as chat and e
mail like most portals.
"All we do is search." said Sergey Brin,
Google co-founder and president.
Searching, however, is not as easy as it
seems. Google has .'5,000 servers and adds
30 per day in response to growing usage.
Moreover, the technology that drives
Google is the result of years of research.
lit in and fellow co-founder Larry Page

began their work in 1995 when they were
at Stanford pursuing doctoral degrees in
Computer Science. Page had an interest in
the Internet, and Brin was researching
data mining, or processing large amounts
of information. They decided to combine
their interests and create a new technology
to search the Internet.
This interest became their doctoral re
search, and it continued as such until the
summer of 1998. At that time, they decid
ed to leave their doctoral work and turn
their research into a company To do so.
they needed substantial equipment.
"Larry and 1 used to hang out on the
loading docks to watch where the PC ship
ments were going in the Computer Sci
ence Department," Brin said. "Then we
would go ask the people who got the com
puters if we could use them."
The two co-founders began working in
a friend's garage. These arrangements,
however, proved insufficient as Google
grew, and they soon got funding from two
top venture firms, Kleiner Perkins Cau
fielcl Byers and Sequoia Capital.
Since then, Google has grown to
around 100 employees, and executes 13
million searches per clay. At around a
penny per search, Google is generating a
lot of money.

Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page built the company out of their doctoral research in computer science at Stanford.
"It has been quite an extraor
dinary experience," Brin said. "I
started out in an almost purely
technical role, [which] has now
become more managerial. Tradi

tional careers
progress through
this over decades,
this has all hap
pened over
months."
Brin said that al
though he is pas
sionate about his
work at Google, he
misses the scientific
work. His current

schedule consists primarily of
meetings, and he can commonly
be found working at Google until
midnight during the week.
Google employees work hard
and long hours. To offset this,
the company offers many perks,
including a full-time masseuse
and scheduled hockey breaks on
top of the two gourmet chefs and
a well-stocked kitchen.
The busy founders make

hockey a priority. At least twice a
week, employees compete in
scheduled hockey matches in the
parking lot outside their offices.
When the parking lot was under
construction, Brin and Page
rented out a nearby hockey rink
so the matches could continue.
Stanford remains an impor
tant part of the co-founders' lives
â€” both plan on returning to fin

ish their doctoral
degrees. They
have incorporated
their interest in the
University into an
expanding sector
within Google:
Google University.
Soon, they will
provide extensive
searching capabili

ties for any univer
sity for free. Already, Google has
created a search for Stanford
University, located at
http://www.google.com/stanford.
They plan to make the Stan
ford search even more powerful
in the near future.
