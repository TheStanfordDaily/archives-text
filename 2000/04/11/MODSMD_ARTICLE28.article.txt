Google is a leading Internet search en
gine. Its Page Rank technology allows it to
return relevant search results b\ assessing
each page's "importance." As opposed to
Yahoo!, Google is not a portal. Google
doesn't intend to add additional services
and features to the site such as chat and e
mail like most portals.
"All we do is search." said Sergey Brin,
Google co-founder and president.
Searching, however, is not as easy as it
seems. Google has .'5,000 servers and adds
30 per day in response to growing usage.
Moreover, the technology that drives
Google is the result of years of research.
lit in and fellow co-founder Larry Page

began their work in 1995 when they were
at Stanford pursuing doctoral degrees in
Computer Science. Page had an interest in
the Internet, and Brin was researching
data mining, or processing large amounts
of information. They decided to combine
their interests and create a new technology
to search the Internet.
This interest became their doctoral re
search, and it continued as such until the
summer of 1998. At that time, they decid
ed to leave their doctoral work and turn
their research into a company To do so.
they needed substantial equipment.
"Larry and 1 used to hang out on the
loading docks to watch where the PC ship
ments were going in the Computer Sci
ence Department," Brin said. "Then we
would go ask the people who got the com
puters if we could use them."
The two co-founders began working in
a friend's garage. These arrangements,
however, proved insufficient as Google
grew, and they soon got funding from two
top venture firms, Kleiner Perkins Cau
fielcl Byers and Sequoia Capital.
Since then, Google has grown to
around 100 employees, and executes 13
million searches per clay. At around a
penny per search, Google is generating a
lot of money.
