Tired of pricey phone bills? lor
get those annoying pink envelopes
and pick up a microphone! With di
alpad.com, you can call anywhere in
the United States for free.
Dialpad.com is the phone com
pany's worst nightmare and a col
lege student's dream come true. Ii
uses "Java-based technology" to
offer free long-distance calling
through the Internet. All it takes is a
microphone, speakers, an Internet
connection and of course someone
for you to call.
After registering on the site by
providing two pages of demograph

ic information, you'll be able to
make calls from your computer to

any regular phone in the coun
try. As the site explains, "When
you use dialpad.com, your call is

transmitted over the In
ternet to third-party In-

ternet Protocol (IP)
telephony gateways,
then automatically re
layed to the telephone

number you're call
ing." When the dial
tone sounds, you
merely type in the

phone number and
wait lor the i ing.
I low can ibis pos
sibly be free? Just like

with television and
radio, it's all about

partners, and more
blatantly, i»<ls. As yon

chat away , banner .ids
rotate in the top of the di-

alpad.com Java applet.
Your roommate might fall
over laughing the first time he
or slit* walks in the room to find
von sitting in front of the com
puter wearing a headset, hut
this time you're among the
trendsetters. I)ialpad.com

claims that ovei 5 million
people have been using
their service to account
for more than 300 mil
lion ( ailing minutes since

the Silicon Valley company
launched in October. They now are
teaming up with other companies
such as eVoice and C »TK to offer free
voice mail and to utilize a Voice
over-IF network.
Thequalitv isn't quite to the level
of a phone-to-phone conversation.
It seems to vary by Internet connec
tion and how much traffic is on the
site. If the site is busy, you might get
"no channel available" instead of a
dial tone. When vou finalh do get
through, sometimes your voice will
sound a bit choppy, but you can
usually hear the other person with
out am problems.
I here's also a slight delay. The
first few times I tailed home my

mom hung up on me because she
didn't hear an answer to her
"I lello?" in the appropriate amount
of time.
If you don't use headphones,
vou might get some complaints
about echoing. This is due to your
microphone picking up the other
side of the conversation and send
ing it back with a minor delay. You
can fix that with headphones or,
even better,a headset.
At this point, dialpad.com looks
like the best of its type. Another
company called Net2phone.com of
fers free PC-to-P( 1 calling and voice
e-mail, but it charges for PC-to
phone calls. The going rate for PC
to-phoneisonlya penny per minute

if you've put S3 into your account.
That's cheaper than phone rates,
but the quality also won't be as good.
It also requires that you give credit
card information or deal with bills
— two things that dialpad.com
won't bother you with.
Dialpad.com is ideal for college
students. For a free conversation, it's
worth it to call at less popular times
of the day and deal with mom hang
ing up on you the first feu times.
You won't want to use dialpad.com
to talk business with your summer
employers, but for mom, dad and
grandma it does the job. Just be
careful who you tell — now you
have no excuse when you don't call
home.
