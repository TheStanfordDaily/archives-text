"It came as a very pleasant surprise," said
Kennedy, who has published nine other
books on different aspects of American his
tory.
l liis book "is certainly the work that I in
vested in most deeply," Kennedy said. "It's
the book that I made the biggest commit
ment to."
I listory Prof James Sheehan agreed that
this book is "particularly rich" among
Kennedy's works. I le said'that "The subject
of the Second World War is always particu
larly interesting. This book is really worthy of
that great subject."
History Prof. Jack Rakove, who teaches a
class on World War II with Kennedv and is

a member of the selection jury for the
Pulitzer Prize, said of the book, "It works at
every opportunity to try to explain what [the
1930s and 40s] meant. It's quite tricky to do
that."
Provost John Hennessy commented that
"the b(K)k has very interesting insights into
FDR's New Deal legislation, especially how
the initial legislation was crafted from
Hoover's proposed legislation."
The Pulitzer Board awards a prize each

history of the United States." Kennedy is the
fifth Stanford history professor to receive the
prize in American History.
"When I won the prize three years ago,
David commented that he was the only pro
fessor who had held the doe Chair in Amer
ican History and not received a Pulitzer,"
said Rakove. "David was feeling badly about
being the only Coe not to have won — this
will be an enormous weight off him."
Kennedy agreed that he had upheld a
Coe Professor tradition in winning the prize.
"We've made the world complete again," he
said.
Rakove said that "Freedom from Fear" is

exceptional for both its informative
aspects and its clarity of expression.
"It's a snap, crackle and pop narra
tive from beginning to end," he
said. "It's very engagingly written
and accessible to any reader."
Hennessy agreed. "The book is
beautifully written and a joy to
read." he said. "[It] kept me awake,
yielding only four hours sleep last

I hnrsday night!"
Kennedy's writing li.is "verve

is what everybody wants."

(.cntnry." said that the award came
as no surprise to him. "Yon knew
that he was going to get it some
time."
Kennedy's response was less
blase. "I'm feeling a little heady, to
be honest," said Kennedy. "But I'm
trying not to let it go to my head."
