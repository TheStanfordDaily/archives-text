No show on television lias more
scientific wonders to dissect than
"Star Trek" (which is why I saved
"Star Trek" columns for when I ran
out of ideas). Through four TV
show incarnations and eight
movies. Star I'rek has remained
popular due to its last-pac ed action,
wild alien sex and Utopian depic
tion of a universe where not only
crime and disease have been elimi
nated, but where common, ordi

nary 21st century problems can be
solved with superior. 25th century
technology. Some examples are:
Twenty-first century problem:
You owe your best friend of 20
\ ears $5,000, and he's becoming in
creasingly agitated. You haven't
got the money, but you don't want
to destroy the friendship.
Twenty-fifth century solution:
Money doesn't exist in the 25th
century. You become the only t iii
zen on fai th that figures out that
you can sit on yen r butt watching
"X'aboss in Charge" reruns all clay
while still maintaining a comfort
able existence. You have a sordid
affair with your best friend's wife
while he is stuck for SO years in the
Delta Quadrant.
Twenty-first century problem:

Despite vour Ix-si efforts to .11
test them for the break-in at the ol'
Kawlings place, tfiose denied Duke
boys keep escapin'.
Twenty-fifth century solution:
li\ varying t lie phase emission of
the frequency generator in your
AM radio, you should he able to
create .1 directed tachyon pulse. II
von amplify this pulse with the
blind guv's visor, it should be
enough to set off a cascade reaction
in the (ieneral Lees warp core,
causing <1 total systems failure.
That'll teach 'em not to mess with
Boss I logg.
Twenty-first century problem:
You have trouble communicat
ing with members of the opposite


Dr. Spock and Captain Kirk propose solutions to technological quandaries, not fashion debates
sex.
Twenty-fifth century solution:
Yeah right. Try again in 300
years.
Anyways, probably tlie most
accessible piece of cool technolo
gy showcased in the Star Trek se
ries is the holodeck, that magical
room that creates virtual envi
ronments in which the Star Trek
c haracters can dress in 18th cen
tury costumes and generally look
stupid. II you look at the ad
vances in computer graphics and
realism that have been made in
the last 20 years, ii seems entirely
possible thai we will see fully im
mersive, 31) environments in the
near future. In fact, there are
projects going on all over the
country to produce realistic, 3D
holographic depictions of real
world objects.
One promising project is the
haptics project at the Media Lab at
Mi l . I sing a holographic projec
tor and a force-feedback pen devel
oped at Sens Able Technologies, re
sea rc lici s at M 1 I have been able to
i reate a rotating holographic cylin
der. When the user presses the spe
cial pen into the 31) image of the
cvlinder, the cylinder deforms (the

process is similar to using a wood
lathe) and the user actuallyfeels the
pen push into the hologram.
Still a far cry from the complicat
ed environments portrayed on Star
Trek, but it's a start.
This week's brainteaser:
Bob the cow and Joe the cow al
ways walk in straight-line segments
and at the same speed. When they
do turn, the turn is always an exact
90 degree turn.
From the same point some
where on the inner edge ol Round
Field (a perfect fenced-in circle, of
course), Bob and Joe both start
walking at the same time. Bob walks
due north, and Joe walks in a direc
tion between north and east. After
an hour, Bob hits the edge of the
field and turns right — simultane
ously, Joe turns right (even though
Joe is not at the edge of the field).
After another half-hour, Joe hits
the edge of the field and stops. Fif
teen minutes later, Bob hits the
edge of the field. Now that Joe has
had 15 minutes to rest, he wants to
exercise by walking (without turn
ing) the longest possible distance
without hitting a point on the edge
of the field.
Which way should he go (in de
grees — 0 is due east, 90 due north,
ISO due west, 270 due south).
