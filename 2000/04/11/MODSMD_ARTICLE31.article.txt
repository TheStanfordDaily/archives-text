# Entrepreneurship moves toward social initiatives

### NINA CANN-WOODE 
Stanford is situated at. the heart of'a ver
itable gold mine.
Silicon \ alley is, and can be proven to
be, the most entrepreneurial region in the
United States. In 1998 for example, $99.9
billion in revenues were earned In top
technology firms in the valley — 70 per
cent ofthe total earned by the top 100 tech
nology companies. I wenty-one valley In
ternet IPOs completed in 1997-99 coin
prised 50 percent ofthe national total, ac
cording to the Stanford I ethnology Ven
tures Program.
Hut that is not to say everything is al
ways about money. However fast-paced
Silicon \ alley's tec hnological sector may
be, it still fosters a spirit of fluid social inter
action, networking and collective learning.
Stanford has been as instrumental in
the evolution of Silicon Valley as the region
has been on the University.
Established the 19505, Stanford's In
dustrial Park created a hub of high tech
nology facilitating academic and entrepre
neurial cooperation. And in perhaps one
of the most well known partnerships be
tween the university and a corporation,
Electrical Engineering Prof . Ered Terman
in the 1940s arranged a bank loan for Bill
Hewlett and Dave Packard, providing
them with initial funds to support the be
ginnings of what would become a thriving
industry.
Stanford has for a few years now begun
to transfer this Silicon Valley model to a
new arena of social entrepreneurship. ()n
Saturday, Kids With Dreams and the Busi
ness Association of Stanford Engineering
Students hosted a conference in Ten nan
Auditorium with the purpose of educating
Stanford students and Northern Califor
nia attendees on the subject of social entre
preneurship. Social entrepreneurship is
somewhat distinct from community ser
vice in that proponents of the idea "take
innovative approaches to solving social is
sues, using traditional business skills to cre
ate social rather than private value," ac
cording to the conference Web site.
Kids With Dreams is a community ser
vice organization dedicated to social ser
vice through this type of in novation.
"What attracted me most about Kids
with Dreams was its focus on adopting en
trepreneurial ideals in striving lor its mis
sion," said junior Melissa Miao, executive
director of the group."()ur purpose is not
to just help but to empower disabled cliil
dren with the belief that thevcan make sig
nificant contributions to the world."
By forming partnerships between Stan
ford and community organizations. Kids
With Dreams creates a venue for college
students to educate and motivate children
with a wide range of mental and physical
disabilities. Volunteers fulfill a diverse
array of capacities, which include working
as assistants at special schools, as mentors
to high school students and as swimming
and basketball coaches.
"Kids with Dreams takes pride in being
founded upon the principles of philan
thropy and social entrepreneurship," said
Miao. "In diversifying our funding base
and in initiating unique projects, [our or
ganization] strives to uphold the ideals of
s(k ial entrepreneurship."

BASES, the othei host of Saturdays
conference, is a student-run organization
within the School of Engineering that
seeks to cultivate the entrepreneurial and
business skills of Stanford's engineers.
"By connecting the entrepreneurial
vigor of Stanford students with the vast
business support structure of BASES spon
sors and Silicon \ allev," the group's Web
page states, "BASES aims to c reate tlieop
portunit\ for Stanford Engineering sin
dents to bring their ideas to fruition."
I o fulfill its mission, BASI S itself spon
sors contests, seminars and a job fair lor
stirt-upcompanies in Eebruarv. In partic
ular, BASES collaborates closelv with the
Stanford lechnologx Ventures Program,
to achieve mutual objectives. Both seek to
accelerate entrepreneurship education lor
engineers at Stanford and ultimately
worldwide, with the belief that engineers
themselves need entrepreneurial skills to
be great engineers, according to the
BASES Web site.
loin Byers, an associate professor in
the Industrial Engineering Department
(now c alled Management Science and En
gineering), is the program director for
S I VP and sits on the BASES Board of Ad
visors. lie is also director ol the Mayfield
fellows Program,a new program in which
a select group of seniors take a class in the
spring, spend a summer interning with a
start-up company and then return lor an
other quarter of coursework on the wax to
a master's degree in engineering.
" I his is stuff vou normally don't teach,"
said Byers. "But it is absolutely critical lor
success in the entrepreneurial economy."
Since the companies at which the se
niors intern are relatively new themselves,
it may be a while before one becomes suc
cessful on a large sc ale.
"This is an experiment. We don't know
all the answers." Byers said of the pro
grain. "We'll see five or 1 0 years clow n the
road w hat impact it's had. I do know it will
enhance the students' chances for success,
because know ledge is power. But being an
entrepreneur is a mindset. It's a wa\ of liv
ing vou i life. It's being obsessed with think
ing about opportunity. And it's under
standing what it lakes to go from an idea to
a business."
So then, what one reall) sees in social
entrepreneurship is an intermingling be
tween the tec linical and the social — an al
liance between business firms and engi
neering groups like S I \ Panel BASES and
organizations like Kids with Dreams. Al
though these three organizations strive to
wards iheir goals in diffeicut and continu
ally innovative ways, the essential point re
mains that service and entrepreneurship
are not concepts that preclude but rather
strengthen one another.
"Entrepreneurship is not about making
money, but rather a wax of thinking," said
Miao. "It is about finding and passionateh
pursuing new opportunities to do things
better. An entrepreneui is innovative and
breaks traditional boundaries of thought.
"Many students feel, as 1 did, that their
serv ice interests are an aside to their ac ad
emic or business interests," she said. "But
social entrepreneurship shows just how
these two interests can coincide and how
the principles of each can reinforce each
other."

Hut that is not to say everything is al
ways about money. However fast-paced
Silicon \ alley's tec hnological sector may
be, it still fosters a spirit of fluid social inter
action, networking and collective learning.
Stanford has been as instrumental in
the evolution of Silicon Valley as the region
has been on the University.
Established the 19505, Stanford's In
dustrial Park created a hub of high tech
nology facilitating academic and entrepre
neurial cooperation. And in perhaps one
of the most well known partnerships be
tween the university and a corporation,
Electrical Engineering Prof . Ered Terman
in the 1940s arranged a bank loan for Bill
Hewlett and Dave Packard, providing
them with initial funds to support the be
ginnings of what would become a thriving
industry.
Stanford has for a few years now begun
to transfer this Silicon Valley model to a
new arena of social entrepreneurship. ()n
Saturday, Kids With Dreams and the Busi
ness Association of Stanford Engineering
Students hosted a conference in Ten nan
Auditorium with the purpose of educating
Stanford students and Northern Califor
nia attendees on the subject of social entre
preneurship. Social entrepreneurship is
somewhat distinct from community ser
vice in that proponents of the idea "take
innovative approaches to solving social is
sues, using traditional business skills to cre
ate social rather than private value," ac
cording to the conference Web site.
Kids With Dreams is a community ser
vice organization dedicated to social ser
vice through this type of in novation.
"What attracted me most about Kids
with Dreams was its focus on adopting en
trepreneurial ideals in striving lor its mis
sion," said junior Melissa Miao, executive
director of the group."()ur purpose is not
to just help but to empower disabled cliil
dren with the belief that thevcan make sig
nificant contributions to the world."
By forming partnerships between Stan
ford and community organizations. Kids
With Dreams creates a venue for college
students to educate and motivate children
with a wide range of mental and physical
disabilities. Volunteers fulfill a diverse
array of capacities, which include working
as assistants at special schools, as mentors
to high school students and as swimming
and basketball coaches.
"Kids with Dreams takes pride in being
founded upon the principles of philan
thropy and social entrepreneurship," said
Miao. "In diversifying our funding base
and in initiating unique projects, [our or
ganization] strives to uphold the ideals of
s(k ial entrepreneurship."

BASES, the othei host of Saturdays
conference, is a student-run organization
within the School of Engineering that
seeks to cultivate the entrepreneurial and
business skills of Stanford's engineers.
"By connecting the entrepreneurial
vigor of Stanford students with the vast
business support structure of BASES spon
sors and Silicon \ allev," the group's Web
page states, "BASES aims to c reate tlieop
portunit\ for Stanford Engineering sin
dents to bring their ideas to fruition."
I o fulfill its mission, BASI S itself spon
sors contests, seminars and a job fair lor
stirt-upcompanies in Eebruarv. In partic
ular, BASES collaborates closelv with the
Stanford lechnologx Ventures Program,
to achieve mutual objectives. Both seek to
accelerate entrepreneurship education lor
engineers at Stanford and ultimately
worldwide, with the belief that engineers
themselves need entrepreneurial skills to
be great engineers, according to the
BASES Web site.
loin Byers, an associate professor in
the Industrial Engineering Department
(now c alled Management Science and En
gineering), is the program director for
S I VP and sits on the BASES Board of Ad
visors. lie is also director ol the Mayfield
fellows Program,a new program in which
a select group of seniors take a class in the
spring, spend a summer interning with a
start-up company and then return lor an
other quarter of coursework on the wax to
a master's degree in engineering.
" I his is stuff vou normally don't teach,"
said Byers. "But it is absolutely critical lor
success in the entrepreneurial economy."
Since the companies at which the se
niors intern are relatively new themselves,
it may be a while before one becomes suc
cessful on a large sc ale.
"This is an experiment. We don't know
all the answers." Byers said of the pro
grain. "We'll see five or 1 0 years clow n the
road w hat impact it's had. I do know it will
enhance the students' chances for success,
because know ledge is power. But being an
entrepreneur is a mindset. It's a wa\ of liv
ing vou i life. It's being obsessed with think
ing about opportunity. And it's under
standing what it lakes to go from an idea to
a business."
So then, what one reall) sees in social
entrepreneurship is an intermingling be
tween the tec linical and the social — an al
liance between business firms and engi
neering groups like S I \ Panel BASES and
organizations like Kids with Dreams. Al
though these three organizations strive to
wards iheir goals in diffeicut and continu
ally innovative ways, the essential point re
mains that service and entrepreneurship
are not concepts that preclude but rather
strengthen one another.
"Entrepreneurship is not about making
money, but rather a wax of thinking," said
Miao. "It is about finding and passionateh
pursuing new opportunities to do things
better. An entrepreneui is innovative and
breaks traditional boundaries of thought.
"Many students feel, as 1 did, that their
serv ice interests are an aside to their ac ad
emic or business interests," she said. "But
social entrepreneurship shows just how
these two interests can coincide and how
the principles of each can reinforce each
other."
