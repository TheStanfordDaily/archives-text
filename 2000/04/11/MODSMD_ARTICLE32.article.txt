## I-banking provides the big picture for high tech Stanford alumna tells why I-banking isn't just for old hats Focal point 
### 
1 hear from friends who are seniors
this year that investment banking is out
and startups are in. When ! was graduat
ing from Stanton I in 1998, investment
banking was hyped up and interviews
were very competitive. 1 followed the
trend at the time and got a job at a tech
nology focused investment bank. I've
been there tor almost two years now. I
started out as an analyst, similar to other
students coming straight out of college. A
year later, I moved into equity research

as an associate fol
lowing the stocks
of Internet secu
rity software com
panies.
Working in in
vest nient bank
ing <11 icl focusing
on technology
companies and
technology deals,

especially IPOs,
have given me a different and very • valu
able perspective into technology and In
ternet businesses as well as venture capi
tal firms and the culture of Silicon Valley
than actually working inside one of those
technology companies. Without ques
tion. there are certain things you can
only learn by working for a technology
company or startup and by actually
bcin ; on i he job. 1 iowever, there are nu
inerons valuable things that you can only
learn and see by being outside and ana
l\ /ing these businesses in the big picture.
I laving an experience with both is prob
ably ideal.
Certainly, I am a little envious of se
niors today because it seems like they
have more job choices than I did, but 1
wouldn't want seniors now to disregard
careers in investment banking because
it's the old fad. Certainly I admit that
there was a lot of hype surrounding in
vestment banking; it sounded glamorous
to be spending time with CK( )s at expen
sive restaurants and private jets (which
turned out to be pretty true).
However today after my experience
in investment banking, I realize that it of
fers not only glamour, but also a lot of
learning and training about business for
someone coming straight out of college.
Almost everyone in Silicon Valley knows
w hat " 1 1'()" stands for; it's amazing to see
how those three letters made their way
into advertisements around the valley
for sleek new phones or cars.
For main. 1 P( )s have become synony
mous with instant wealth creation for
twenty something year-olds, but work
ing in investment banking shows you
what goes on behind the scenes, what it
takes fbi a successful IPO. Also, it teach
es you not only the hard work that goes

behind it, but also that not ever) start-up
goes public successfully, or goes public at
all, and it takes almost more work to be
successful after a company goes public
than before it went public. And of course,
next to the glamour of investment bank
ing is a lot ol non-glamorous, tedious
hard work for an analyst, all-nighters
and working on weekends when your
friends are skiing ;ii Tahoe.
1 am currently a research associate in
equity research at the investment bank in
which I started almost two years ago as
an investment banking analyst with 40
other students straight out of college.
1 he reason I left banking to go into
research was because 1 had a great op
portunity to learn a really exciting space
in-depth while working with a great
mentor. In research, junior people like
me get a chance to locus on a spec ific
space more than they can do in invest
ment hanking.

For many, IPOs have become

I oday, I follow Internet security
stocks, publish research on them and an
swer questions from large investors
about these stocks. Being an equity re
search associate is a great way to learn
about analyzing.business models, w hat it
takes for a technology company lo be
successful on Wall Street and get a lot of
exposure to top company management
and investors w ho are managing billions
of dollars and are focused on investing in
technology and Internet stocks.
Asa research associate, 1 spend a large
part ol m\ time estimating how much a
certain company's sales will grow in the
next year or two, how much ilie\ are
spending and on what and how much
they w ill spend in the future.
I also estimate when a non-profitable
Internet or software startup can be ex
pected to turn profitable, its potential
stable long-term business models, its
competitive position, how large its po
tential addressable market size is and il
the management seems capable of exe
cuting the business model. In order to do
all this, 1 read other market research, talk
to people at the companies who are in
charge of finance, engineering, sales and
marketing, talk to their customers and
competitors, and follow their press re
leases about what they are doing with

their c ustomers, partners and products
or services.
In the rest ol my time, ! write and
publish research notes w hen acompam
I follow has news, such as a significant
customer acquisition, that could affect
the stock, a strong new partner or an ex
citing new product or service announce
ment. I also talk to institutional invest*n s
on the phone, and ti\ to answer their
questions and hesitations they have
about the stocks that I cover. I also write
research theme pieces covering new
trends in the space that I cover, such as
how the emergence of the wireless mar
ket will affect the Internet security soft
ware companies that I follow.
Working at a startup is not the only
wa\ of getting exposure to technology
and Internet companies. Investment
hanking, both an investment banking
analyst job or a research associate posi
tion, c an give one a lot of exposure to a

breadth of business models and compa
nies in technology and the Internet, a lot
more than working loi a single technolo
gy company. being on the outside shows
you the bigger pic ture and helps you ap
proach these companies from a third
person perspective rathei than "us and
the competitors." Phis allows you to real
ly learn about the strengths and weak
nesses of each company and consequent
ly what it takes to run a successful tech
nology company.
Again. I wouldn't want seniot s now to
disregard c areers in investment banking
because its the old fad ot because they
have been told that they need to go work
for a technology start-up to learn about
technology businesses. I believe when
pic king,i career, seniors should reallv re
search what ihe\ will be able to learn on
the job and not simph accept or reject a
certain job offer because it's the new
