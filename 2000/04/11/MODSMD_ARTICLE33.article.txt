## Sonicnet brings radio to Web 
### SALAS SARAIYA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
1 don't have a car. So whenever 1 leave my
dorm room, I habitually call shotgun. Practice
makes perfect. But 1 don't especially relish the
unique ability ofthe passenger seat to recline, the
extendable leg space or even the feeling of abject
superiority I get when I gloat over the sardines
packed four wide in the back seat. Okay, maybe
I do. But the ultimate reason I like sitting in the
front is tluit 1 like being able to choose the sta
tions. Surprisingly enough. 1 have vet to meet
anyone else 011 (iod's green earth that shares my
love for good music. Especially radio DJs, which
is why 1 make the packed lisli in the back dizzy
constantly scanning stations. ()i so I'm told. I low
listening to different stations can make one dizzy
beats the heck out of me.
As a card-tarrying member ofthe Ml':? gen
eration, I live by the slogan: so much music, so lit
tle time. As Ml'lisare pushing radio stations and
compact discs the way ofthe Stanford post office,
sonicnet.com is trying to pull Internet radio back
from the land ofthe doomed. To discover how
I I ley're doing this, let's revisit our old frietid. I>ig-
Money Salsa. bigMotieySalsa loves music, but he
is out of hard drive space for MP3s because he
bought his throwbac k computer back in the by
gone age of 1999, when an 8 CB hard drive was
thought to be more than enough.

First bigMoneySalsa selects what genres of
music he wants to listen to (ie. rap, country, pop,
rock). Then he selects what categories within
those genres to listen to (ie. West Coast Rap, 80s
Pop, Ska, .Alternative, Country) and how often
lit- wants to hear them. Voilu, he's got himself a
station. Now let's say bigMotieySalsa is listening
to his radio station and up comes some Celine
Dion. Instead of feeling ashamed that his affinity
fix the soli soothing sounds of Phil Collins led to
such appalling music being integrated into his
music list, bigMotieySalsacan just hit the more/
less button and eliminate the offending Canadi
an entirely from his list.
Current law prohibits Internet radio stations
112 rom publishing their plavlists because otherwise
the motivation for a user to buy the CDs would
be greatly reduced. Radio.sonicnet threads the
loophole by just listing the subcategories with ex
amples of popular artists, not the actual songs
that they have 011 their databases.
Sonicnet is a great way to discover new artists.
Since there are more unpopular artists than
popular artists within a given genre, most of the
artists will not be those played on the radio. II
you do not like an artist, however, you can just
remove them from your list. ()f course, if you are
of the opinion that unpopular artists are unpop
ular for a reason, radio.sonicnet probably isn't
the service lor you.
Like many free services offered through the

Internet these days, your radio.sonicnet is being
paid for by advertising. The service puts a cook
it- on your computer that traces where you surf ,
so their advertising can be directed. The adver
tisements come up between a random number
of songs.
The functions available on the radio.sonicnet
are rather primitive. For example, you can't fast
forward during songs or past advertisements,
only between songs, and you can never rewind.
Radio.sonicnet, in my opinion, is much better
than typical radio stations. You only get the
artists you want, you can read the artist and song
names at all times and there are less commercials
than on traditional radio stations. Even though
the songs on sonicnet take up no hard drive
space and are legal, I'd still rate them lower than
pirated MP3s, because you can't pick which
songs on Radionet you want to listen to at any
given time.
Of course, a big disadvantage for both MFSs
and radio.sonicnet is that they're only available
on the computer, not in the car. And radio.son
icnet, 1 dare say, is damn near dangerous for
anyone in the backseat. Ever since 1 got
radio.sonicnet, 1 know what I know what 1 want
to hear, and 1 know it's available. I've been
changing car radio stations so fast, that the fish
have spun into a frenzy. Whatever, they haven't
seen the* light.
Shotgun riders wanted.
