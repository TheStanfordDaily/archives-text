## Stanford doctor leads implantable lens investigation 
### CINDY LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Imagine never having to
worry about the ritual of putting
in and taking out your contacts
every day. These daily inconve
niences may soon become a
thing of the past for people with
extreme nearsightedness, as
medical doctors ac toss the coun
try are performing I DA clinical
trials on implantable intraocular
lenses.
Stanford is one of 10 sites
across the country that are evalu
ating the eflec tiveness and safety
of the Artisan brand lenses, man
ufactured by the company Oph
tec BV, for correcting nearsight
edness.
Asst. Prof, of Opthalniology
Edward Manche at the Stanford
Medical Center is leading the in
vestigation at Stanford.
"I'd like to get involved with
the clinical trial because ol the
safety and effectiveness seen with
these lenses in the early clinical
trials as well as the excellent track
record in Europe," Manche said.
The lenses have been used in
Europe for over a decade and
only began investigation for safe
ty and effectiveness ol use in the
U.S. in ()c toiler of 1997.
I he implantable lenses are
currently being tested only on
patients with extremely high my
opia between the ages ol 18 and
50.
"I tend to recommend the
lenses for patients who want to

get out of glasses and contact
lenses and have extreme levels of
nearsightedness that can't be
helped with laser eye surgery,
which is -10 to -20 diopters of
nearsightedness," Mane he said.
According to Stanford Eye
Laser Center Clinic Assistant
Chelsea Barnes, the lenses are
dear, oblong, and made of the
same plastic as dial lor a cataract
lens or a rigid, gas permeable
contact lens.
Manche performs the im
plant surgery in a sterile operat
ing room in the Stanford I lospi
tal to reduce the risk ol infection.
Ihe surgery itsell takes onlv
about 20 minutes. Ihe eye is
numbed with anesthetic drops.
Patients also usually receive a
mild sedative to reduce anxietv.
A small incision is made to the
cornea and the lens is inserted
and centered over the pupil.
I he cornea is the part ol the eye
that focuses incoming light rays
to lorm an image on the retina. A
small lobster claw-like clip is
used to delicately ( lamp the im
plant to the iris to keep the lens
permanently immobilized. I lie
iris controls the amount of light
entering the eye.
Barnes states that once im
planted, the lenses are perma
nent and never need to be re
placed or cleaned. The same
plastic has been tested for use in
cataract patients and found to be
inert and well tolerated by the
human body.
"The lenses can be removed il

there are problems," Karnes
said. "lUil it is rare that ;i person
would expei ience ;i dec line in vi
sion. unless due to trauma, I hat
would require a new lens pre
scription."
In the Kuropcan Clinical In
vestigation, which started in
1991, the most wiclck reported
adverse event to the intraocular
lens was the li.ilo 01 ring and
glare eflec t (hiring night dri
ving. It was also lound that 92
percent ol patients gained vision
of 20/30 or hettei within a month
alter implantation surgerv.
According to Mane lie, along
with lifestyle needs, people
should consider the costs of the
intraocular lens versus a lifetime
of (ontad lenses or glasses.
"The cost of the surgical im
plantation procedure is approx
imately $3,500 per eve," Mane lie
said. "Contact lenses can run
anywhere from $300 tos7">o per
year depending on the t\ pe and
number of fittings."
Some people with extreme
nearsightedness cautiously wel
come a procedure that would
eliminate the daily ritual ol
wearing contact lenses and
glasses.

"The daily constancy of tak
ing tare of lenses, having to
wort) if they rip or fall out is a
hassle," s;iid sophomore Beverly
Chung. "It is also scary to take
oil mv glasses and not be able to
distinguish colors clearlv be
cause it is so bluriA .
" I liese new procedures are
exciting, but .ilso not something
to jump into. It is very cutic ing,
but it is important to weigh the
consequences."
()thers are still hesitant to trv
out a new procedure until it is
proven to be effective and safe in
the long term.
" I lie whole idea of cutting
into your eye is frightening,"
said sophomore Brendan
Dixon. "Also, being part part of a
c linical ti ial implies that they are
still not yet sure if it is safe."
Mane lie states that approval
from the FDA for use of this lens
in the L .S. should occur within
the next 18 to 24 months.
Patients are still needed to
participate in the clinical trial
held at Stanford. Contact Leslie
