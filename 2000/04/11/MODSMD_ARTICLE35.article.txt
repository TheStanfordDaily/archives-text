# Students neglect the importance of 'social health'
## HEALTH BEAT 
### MARGAUX SNIDER 
I sually when vou read I lealth Beat, it is
tilled with helpful hints and advice about re
sources lor what to do if you're sick, tired 01
ihiuk you have a S I D.
for this week, though, I'd like to extend
what we think ol as traditional health be
yond just physical, mental or emotional
health to include social and communis
health as well.
Ac cording to the World I lealth ()rgani
/ation, health is not just the absence of dis
ease or infirmity but "a stale ol complete
physic al, mental and social well-being."
Although it initially may seem strange t< >
include such concepts as socioeconomic

level, equity, discrimination, educational
opportunities and even one's environment
in a definition of health, the\ are, in lac I, as
significant as exercise and nutrition to
health.
We simply cannot be healthv in a place
w here we are subject to the stresses and pain
of injustice, (list riinination and ignorance.
We may not reali/e it, but u ithin our own
Stanford community we can be just as af
fected by these social aspe< ts of health as ,i
person living in povert\ ot under an op
pressive government. Even Stanli»t<l stu
dents ma\ be subjec ted lo racism, sexism < >i
discrimination due to our beliefs, sexual ori
entation or age, and ibis not onl\ huiis feel
ings but can also hurt om well-being.
Despite the nickname "The Stanford
bubble," Stanford and students are not im
mune to the eflects ol these social problems
that plague the world over.
Not only is it dillic ult but it is also physi
cally and emotionally draining to earn tin*
strain of injustice and disc riininatic >n. It can

-1 uiri self-esteem and personal happiness
.uid even create stress that can have long
lenn phvsical ramifications.
You need onl\ stop In I'm!. Sapolsky's
human behavioral biology c lass to hear the
long ranging detrimental physical eflects of
stress, fi(tin increased risk < »l heart disease to
diabetes. I i not it >nal health < an also be put in
jeopardy iI social health is not maintained.
('.ollege students may become lonely, de
pressed oi I eel (lit oil from theii communi
ty and peers as a result of disc i imination and
ignorance.
Students (an come into contact with so
(ial in jiisli( call the time, from inappn ipriate
comments made l>\ a professor oi (lorni
ni.ite to feelings ol embarrassment or in
equality when that student is the onl\
woman or minority present in a class.
Social injustice, lack of c(|iiit\ and dis
(i imination (an eflect physical health direct
l\ but i.in even ellect ac c ess to and quality of
health cue we receive.
Studies have shown that women and ini

iun itics nia\ receive less ade(]iiate care and
may receive that care less frequently than
other people, a situation that mav be due to
unconscious discrimination by doctors or
otliei health practitioners.
So, this week, fc»r help in preventing
these problems, rather than refer readers to
a doctor or free sen ice, I refer you primari
ly to yourselves. We are the best treatment
for these ills.
By fostering a community at Stanford
that promotes awareness of these issues, a
diii\ to find solutions to them and accep
tance' of people and beliefs that are not our
own, we can be the penicillin for many of
these diseases.
I alk to friends and family about these is
sncsand speak up when \ou are in the pres
ence of inequality or injustice.
Additioiudly, although a medical doctor
ma\ be unable to help, victims of social in
justice and discrimination do have some re
sources.
(lanipus groups such as the ethnic com

munitv centers, religions groups and oilier
community centers can provide a place of
empathy and refuge. Places like the BCSC,
campus ministry, IXIBCC and Women's
Outer are just a few of the many wonderful
groups that can help.
All Stanford students also receive a limit
ed number of free counseling sessions
through (lowell's counseling service, (IAPS.
Beyond C low ell, there are also the dedicated
students at I lie Bridge who are always w ill
it to listen and discuss problems.
Probably, whether you realize it or not,
you know someone who has been the victim
of hurtful words, people or situations here
at Stanford. I urge you to think of these
problems not only as a threat to our com
munity hut as a threat to the health and well
being of many Stanford students, some of
whom may be your friends.
