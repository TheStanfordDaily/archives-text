# Panel agrees risk of nuclear attacks grave
## Discussion concludes that Americans often under-estimate risk 
### PETER STAIR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The end of the Cold War did
little to reduce the danger of nu
clear weapons, according to the
participants in a panel discussion
sponsored hy the Center lor Inter
national Security and Anns Con
trol.
In the discussion titled "So You
Think Nuclear Weapons Went
Away With the Cold War?,' live
experts agreed that the political
deterioration in Russia and nu
clear proliferation in the 1990s
probably make the threat of nu
clear attack greater than ever.

lit a panel preceding ABC's live
remake of the movie "Fail Safe,"
former Senator Alan Cranston;
Radiology Prof. Herb Abrams;
George Bunn, a former general
council for the I S Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency; Sumit
Ganguly, visiting fellow; and Scott
Sagan, co-director of the Stanford
Center for International Security,
agreed that the risk of an attack
was greatly underestimated by the
general public, that the United
States and Russia should take
their nuclear missiles off am sort
of hair-trigger alert and that
American pursuit of a missile de
fense system would be foolish.
They disagreed in their assess
ment of more specific issues, in
cluding (lie possibility of the Sen
ate reconsidering its 1999 rejec
lion of the (Comprehensive Test
Bail 1 reaty and the risk of nuclear
attack in the conflict between
India and Pakistan.
11 ley emphasized that human
ity's goal should be complete nu
clear disarmament. "We must
mend our ways and change pre
sent policy to gel rid of the
weapons before they get rid of us,"
said Senator Cranston. "If they're
around forever, sooner or later
I hey will be used."
According to Cranston, of the
thousand or so fiilse signals of nu
clear attack between the United
States and Russia or (he Soviet
Union, experts have usually real
ized the mistake quickly, as when
the moon or a flock of geese were
misread as missiles.
But on one occasion, the chief
of the National Security Agency
was awakened in the middle of the
night and informed that the Unit
ed States was "under massive at
tack" before officials realized that
a training simulation had acciden
tally been inserted into the missile
detection system.
On another occasion, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin was awak
ened and told a U.S. missile was
approaching. l ie later found that
it was a Russian-authorized Nor

wegian test missile. Russia's Em
bassy in Norway had neglected to
tell the military.
Such false warnings are fright
ening, said moderator Sagan, par
ticularly because the United States
and Russia have the ability to re
taliate so quickly. "The major dif
ference between nuclear weapons
and [other types of weapons] is
not the number of people they
would kill, it's the speed by which
we could kill," he said.
In the name of deterrence and
the strategy of "mutual assured
destruction," wherein one side
would launch all of its missiles be
fore any landed on its territory, we
have created a world where we
"take decisions out of politicians
hands" and "cooler heads may not
prevail."
Ihe risk of false attack or alarm
has increased beause Russia has
not allocated enough money to
maintain the safety of its missile
detection and launching equip
ment, according to Cranston.
That it has also not regularly paid
its military officials and nuclear
scientists has increased the chance
that terrorists "with no compunc
tion about using them to attack
us" will be able to steal or bribe
their way to nuclear capability.
Claiming, to uncomfortable
laughter from the audience, that
Stanford University was one of the
eight targets in the Bay Area,
Abrams described the aftermath

of a nuclear attack. The effects of
superfires, radioactive craters,
overwhelmed hospitals, toxic air
and opportunistic epidemics
would be so great, he said, that "an
attack, even if accidental, might
prompt retaliation."
"We must take all missiles off
high alert, remove the capability
of rapid launch, and fulfil our
obligations to .... the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty," he
said.
According to Bunn, the non
nuclear countries who have
signed this treaty agreed not to
develop nuclear weapons with the
understanding that the admitted
nuclear powers — the United
States, Russia, France, Britain and
China — would negotiate in good
faith towards reducing and elimi
nating their weapons. "Most do
not believe they have," he said,
which raises doubts about their
continued commitment to the
treaty.
A specialist in nonproliferation
issues, Ganguly called the Non
proliferation Treaty and the Com
prehensive Test Ban Treaty
"disingenuous," or unfairly slant
ed towards the existing nuclear
powers.
He defended India and Pak
istan's decision not to sign either
treaty before asserting themselves
.is nuclear powers in l ( .) ( .)S. I hev
objec led to I lie I real it's on I lit*
grounds that thev "only exhort
ed nuclear weapons powers to
lake sieps toward disarm.iineni
and thai the) prevented the pro
tection of their national security.
According to (iangulv, (lliair
inan Mao Ise-lung of nearhv
China said "he could cntireh
conceive ol inn lear war because
enough ( Chinese would survive
that ils civilization as we know ii
would si ill survive."
Furthermore, according to
(•auglily, although the global en
vironment is more dangerous
than before, the risk of nuclear
attack in India and Pakistan is
"considciabl\ exaggerated." Mi
said. "there is a much greater

likelihood of conventional war,
even as early as ibis summer."
Assessing future prospects,
the panelists were varyingly
hopeful. If ratification of the
C otnprehensive I est Ban Treaty
is a lirst step in the right direc
tion, Ceorge Bunn was pes
imistic.
A two-thirds majority, which is
necessary to ratify the treaty, is dil
ficnit to assemble and too many
Senators have committed them
selves .to a position opposing the
I reals . Bunn believes. "You have
to wake up the American people
[on this issue], . . . and I don't see
that happening."
Senator Cranston disagreed.
"I'm convinced the treaty is not
dead," he said. I he Senate's re
jection of the treaty was highly
partisan — with Republicans vot
ing against it and Democrats vot
ing for it — and "that's not the
way people think in the Senate."

There were "a good number of
Republicans who were unhappv
with the outcome."
All agreed that an anti-ballistic
missile defense system would be
inadequatel) effective and desta
bilizing.
According to Abrams, equip
ment deterioration and unrelia
bility, t he massive amount of com
puter code required, the difficul
ty of discriminating missiles from
noise, the difficulty of testing the
system and its inability to prevent
smuggling weapons into the
country are all reasons not to in
vest billions of dollars in a missile
defense system.
Moreover, since the United
States has signed the Anti-Ballis
tic Missile Treaty, which prohibits
such a defense system for fear of
destabilizing the balance con
structed by the doctrine of "mutu
al assured destruction," construc t
ing the defense system would pro

voke Riissiii and (iliina.
"II we do it in defiance of Rus
sia and (lliina, 1 see no hope in the
near future of controlling nuclear
weapons," Abrains said.
According to Cranston, by re
fusing to pursue complete disar
mament, we risk billions of lives,
"(kvery day we keep our nuclear
weapons] we put the people of the
world at risk under the fleeting
notion of our national security,"
he said.
Reading to the panelists after
ward, freshman Creg Wientjes
said, "It seemed at the time of
World War 11 we had to make the
bomb, because there was evidence
Hitler was put suing it....and
there are still people out there
who believe it's actually saving
lives."
He said, "it seems like the an
swer is to abolish, but that seems
impossible. It's the kind of stuff
nightmares are made of ."
