# Many psychiatric studies shun neediest patients, experts say
## 
### MARK BOUCHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A recent siucly found that guidelines meant to
narrow t lie pool of subjects for psychiatric studies
often unintentionally exclude African Americans,
the poor and others with severe problems. Ironi
cally, this problem occurs even though the treat
ments being tested are used to help precisely those
groups.
Asst. Psychiatry Prof. Keith Humphreys and
Constance Weisner, a psychiatry professor at
I CSF, conducted the study, which will be pub
lished in the April issue of American Journal of Psy
chiatry.
Humphreys and Weisner say that the exclusion
of so many subjects also explains why many treat
ments that are successful in controlled studies fail in
real-world settings. I he treatments have not been
proven effective for the people who most often
come to hospitals and psychiatric clinics.
Kxclusionary guidelines attempt to simplify the
researcher's job by selecting people likely to com
plete the study and remain available fin follow-up
studies. Criteria can include age, health, place of
residence and medical history.
As a result, "the kinds of people who end up in
research studies aren't the ones who are seeking
care," I lumphreys said.
Psychiatric researchers had long suspected that
studies excluded many potential subjects, he
added. I his study rigorously examined how the
criteria operate.
I'he pair studied 59!* patients in eight alcohol
treatment clinic sin Northern (lalilbrnia. I hey ap
plied eight commonly used exclusionary conditions
and examined the percentage of the patients that
would be excluded from a sludv due to these con
ditions.
Kach c riterion tested eliminated front <S percent
to 7T> percent of the patients. Failure at previous
treatment disqualified the largest number of pa
tients, whereas lack of motivation disqualified the
fewest.
The researchers then analyzed the results lor
public and private clinics, which attract different
types of patients. fhe\ (bund significant difler

entes between the qualified group and the disqual
ified group at both types of clinics.
For example, at public clinics, where 40 percent
of the patients are African-American, 62 percent of
the excluded patients are African-American.
I he pair also found that patients who earned
less than $10,000 were more often excluded at both
types of clinic s. Patients with drug addictions and
severe behavioral problems faced the same prob
lem.
"I don't believe for a minute that this is clone on
purpose," said Humphreys. He said that re
searchers are motivated by concerns such as cost,
convenience and the desire for a successful study.
Consequently, they create guidelines that select
patients who are likely locomplete the study. 1 hese
patients tend to be affluent whites with moderate
psychiatric or alcohol problems.
"The research gives an unrealistically rosy pic
ture of how well the treatment works," I lumphreys
said.
According to him, both ethical and practical rea
sons dictate that psychiatrists change their criteria.
Kthically, ii is unfair to use government funding to
p.iv for research that benefits only a few people.
I le said that the extensive use of exclusions may
unintentionally violate National Institute of 1 lealth
guidelines that require representative minority
and women subjects in any federally-funded study.
For practical reasons, tlie practices must change
because the resulting treatments are ineffective,
s;iid 1 lumphreys.
Many people are treated with methods that are
not known to work for them.
He also noted that researchers should account
for cultural differences in the population. For in
stance, a treatment program designed for wealthy
residents of Boston might not work for rural resi
dents of Montana.
Humphreys suggested that scientists try more
diligently to find subjects who are homeless, poor
or mentally ill. He also proposed that they plan
larger studies, knowing that a percentage of the
participants will quit.
Humphreys acknowledges that, as a result of
larger studies and more extensive patient tracking,
stiidv costs will rise.
