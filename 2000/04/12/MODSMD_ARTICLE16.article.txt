## The 						Stanford Daily Grievance committee a step in the right direction 
### 
PROVOST JOHN lIKNNKSSV'S
announcement at the Faculty Senate
meeting last week ol appointing fac
ulty members to assist the future
provost in addressing faculty grievances on
tenure decisions is a welcome move and a
step in the light direction.
in light of the controversial battles over
tenure in recent years, as well as complaints
about the whole process itself, it is necessary
to evaluate the process.
Clearly, there is a need for a tenure pro
cess that is not only simplified, but one that is
also dearer.
The changes to the current system ol
tenure appeals should onl\ be viewed as a
first step and must be part of a larger process
to alter the entire system.

As Cultural and Social Anthropology
Assoc. Prof. Akhil Cupta, who was the locus
of one of the University's mosl notorious
tenure battles, said. "I'm not sure how much
shorter [the replacement of the grievance
officers| would make the grievance process.
It is still the same kind of investigation, the
same kinds of questions must be asked, and
it's a fairly complicated process."
Still, though there is certainly a long way
to go, the new committee is a necessary
beginning to reforming the grievance proce
dures.
The appointment of standing faculty
members correctly institutionalizes the pro
cess of fact finding.

"investigator" would arise, the provost would
have to contact someone who would then
have to agree to serve in that capacity.
As Molecular and Cellular Physiology
Prof. Richard Aldrich, one of the faculty
members appointed in this new role, states
aptly, "My experience has been that having a
system in place to deal with issues of fairness
in different situations ... is usually superior
to having an ad hoc system.
Bv having a standing pool of faculty from
which to call upon, it serves to make the task
all the more consistent.
Moreover, the role of "fact-finder" will be
somewhat different from that of the
"grievance officers" in the past. Not only will
the new fact-finders comment on the broad
er aspects of cases, they will also be asked to

respond to the "clearly-defined" questions of
I he provost.
While this makes the job of investigating
tenure appeals more case-specific, it also
maintains an essential level of flexibility that
had been accorded to the "grievance offi
cers" of the past.
11 is hoped that the changes to the appeals
system will clarify and shorten the whole
process, changes which serve both the
administration and (acuity.
This shift in policy bodes well for relations
between the new administration and mem
bers of the faculty in the future.
And, perhaps more importantly, the for
mation of this new committee works to affect
changes in a system that has long needed
improvement.
