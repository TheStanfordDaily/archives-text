### 
L.ist spring around tins time, I
made the mistake ol wearing a
Stanford I -shirt. Kven though I
was ;in LPPKRCLASSMAN
going to the l>< ><>kstoi Lto buy an I PI'LR
( LASSMAN course readei lot the
UPPERCLASSMAN seminal I .is tak
ing, the unthinkable happened — I was
accosted l>\ the ever-chippci brand ol
student that Res Ltl makes RAs and < )Ys
"I liiiiee!!! Are you lost???"
"No. (iet the hell out ol my way.' So I
was a little grumpy.

"Shouldn't you be
with yoiu 110-llo???"
Yup. That's right.
She thought 1 was a
pro fro.
Yes, I was wearing
Stanloi d red. Yes, I am
a little shorter than six
feel — about eight
inches shorter. But I
was still slith ketl at her

impertinent e.
Was she blind? (lonic I slu- not read the
fine liilc-s of age < in linmy eves because
of glowing sleep clel >l ? Because of dealing
with financial aid? liecau.se ol MK 101?
Did sin- not see m\ battle scars front
(ireat Works? From freshman Kttglish?
(And I'm not even mentioning the
debilitating embarrassment ol when I
tried to bnv a ticket to see South Park:
"I liiinui — I think I need to see your
ID."
"Why?"
"You have to be 17 to watch an R
rated movie."
"lint I just gave you my student ID.
I'm a student A I S 1 ANK()RD."
"Unimm — It doesn't give your birth
date."
Ibis from a pimply lb-year-old who
probably couldn't even drive.)
This weekend is Pro Fro Weekend (or
Admit Weekend or whatever else they're
(ailing it these days), so while strolling to
(lass, I'll be vceceeery careful to avoid
wearing Stanford paraphernalia.
I hey will, after all, be everywhere. Pro
fros at the bookstore. Pro fros in (lass.
Pro fros at the Clollo. (Sorry, couldn't
resist.)
In fact, walking across campus this
weekend, yon won't be able to avoid the
stray pro fro any more than avoiding the
I risbee golfers or people who think they
can successfully "read" outside.
But while I take offense at being called
a pro fro, I really wouldn't mind going
back in time to become one again.
(lause no matter what they say, high
school was definitely easier.
Back then, it was all about the enve

lope. I hi< k or thin? Big or small? What
(<illege will I attend? I low will I pay for it?
What's the campus like?
Like me, you probably spent about
three years joining the right dubs, wilt
ing the i iglit c*s«a\s, researching the right
research, playing the right sports, study
ing lor the right SA I c|uestions.
Kverything already planned out lor
von. Prescribed lor you, except for a few
<luii k\ hobbies that looked good on your
i esuine.
And to be a lrosh again. And have all
the choices laid out belore you. Sure,
there'd be ( IV (or l-llum or Area One
01 whatever vou kids c all ii nowadays) to
lake again, but even that's preferable to
the dark void ol graduating.
Yeah, yeah. You already saw this
movie, and it's realK not all that wonder
ful .1 life*.
So I guess il any pro fro asks. I II just
share a bit of'cvnical, jaded senior advice:
1. Pick Stanford. Believe me, after hav
ing visited the Last ('.oast, California
(while it won't live up to your Baywatch
expectations) will ccrtainlv be better than
snow in Marc h.
2. Don't (iet RealK Drunk. If you want
to prove your rebelliousness away from
home, wait until freshman year when
v<xi*ll have all year to get a bad reputa
tion. And that way, your RAs won't have
to worry so much about liability laws. II
vou really want to prove your indepen
dence, |ust go to the c itv and gel a tattoo
oi something. But be careful, they check
lor I D. Believe me, 1 know.
!L (io to a c lass. No reason, really. I just
want to see pro Iros in c lass ask really
stupid questions. It makes the rest ol us
UPPKRCIASSMKN look much smarter.
And if the classroom isn't your thing, you
could always c heck out a cool musical.
(Okay, I promise that's my last "Pippin"
plug. 1 lonest.)
Oh yeah. Res Kd will probably mail
you pro fros a brochure about how being
a pro fro will be a magical, enriching
experience. And while it might be for
you, please be careful that you don't
in leel too many of us I 1 PPKR( lASSM KN
with your school spirit.
Remember to keep things the same:
travel around in packs, ask annoying
questions about where the Bookstore is,
and always dress in complete Stanford
attire.
After all, I wouldn't want anyone to
mistake me for a pro fro.

ing lor the right SA I c|uestions.
Kverything already planned out lor
von. Prescribed lor you, except for a few
<luii k\ hobbies that looked good on your
i esuine.
And to be a lrosh again. And have all
the choices laid out belore you. Sure,
there'd be ( IV (or l-llum or Area One
01 whatever vou kids c all ii nowadays) to
lake again, but even that's preferable to
the dark void ol graduating.
Yeah, yeah. You already saw this
movie, and it's realK not all that wonder
ful .1 life*.
So I guess il any pro fro asks. I II just
share a bit of'cvnical, jaded senior advice:
1. Pick Stanford. Believe me, after hav
ing visited the Last ('.oast, California
(while it won't live up to your Baywatch
expectations) will ccrtainlv be better than
snow in Marc h.
2. Don't (iet RealK Drunk. If you want
to prove your rebelliousness away from
home, wait until freshman year when
v<xi*ll have all year to get a bad reputa
tion. And that way, your RAs won't have
to worry so much about liability laws. II
vou really want to prove your indepen
dence, |ust go to the c itv and gel a tattoo
oi something. But be careful, they check
lor I D. Believe me, 1 know.
!L (io to a c lass. No reason, really. I just
want to see pro Iros in c lass ask really
stupid questions. It makes the rest ol us
UPPKRCIASSMKN look much smarter.
And if the classroom isn't your thing, you
could always c heck out a cool musical.
(Okay, I promise that's my last "Pippin"
plug. 1 lonest.)
Oh yeah. Res Kd will probably mail
you pro fros a brochure about how being
a pro fro will be a magical, enriching
experience. And while it might be for
you, please be careful that you don't
in leel too many of us I 1 PPKR( lASSM KN
with your school spirit.
Remember to keep things the same:
travel around in packs, ask annoying
questions about where the Bookstore is,
and always dress in complete Stanford
attire.
After all, I wouldn't want anyone to
mistake me for a pro fro.
