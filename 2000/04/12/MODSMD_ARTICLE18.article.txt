responds to President Casper
In ;i statement released yesterday, I ni
versity President Gerhard Casper states,
"Ii is disheartening to see Stanford's posi
tion on the Foothills and the general use
permit so thoroughly distorted l>\ our
critics in some of their most recent public
statements and advertisements."
I his from the president of a I niversi
ty that plays with words to manipulate the
public into thinking all is well on the
Farm. 1 heir latest trick is to declare that
there will be no development in the Uni
versity's "Foothills District."
I hey don't mention that the "Foothills
District" keeps shrinking as the I Diversi
ty renames sections of this area that it
would like to develop.
In its General Use Permit application
submitted to Santa Clara County, Stan
ford Management Company has
renamed 154 acres of the Foothills, "Uatli
rop," and is attempting to redesignate this
area as "core campus."
I hey are proposing 20,000 square feet
of development over the next 10 years
(41,000 square feet if you include the
Carnegie Institute), and. after that, the
area could be developed as clenselv as t lie
rest of campus.
The Stanford Open Space Alliance
welcomes a public debate with President
(las per to clear the air on these issues.
Let's hope the president will step out
from behind the University's public rela
tions department and enter into construc

tive dialogue with the entire Stanford
community concerning these questions.

President Emeritus responds
to foothills criticism
Flie advertisement placed by a group
of Stanford alumni in Monday's Daily
reflects an unreal view of the University
and its leadership. If there are Stanford
Trustees or administrators who view
open space as a "a 'frill' in comparison
with the 'basics' of bigger labs and sports
facilities," I have not encountered them.
Fven the most self-interested Stanford
official knows as well as any member of the
(oinniittee for (ireen Foothills that a signif
icant part of the charm that draws talented
people to the University derives from the
tremendous attractiveness of the campus
and its immediate surroundings. It is in the
I niversity's interest to concentrate develop
ment in the core campus, as the proposal
before the County Supervisors docs.
Stanford's critics betray a startling lack
of faith in the democratic process when
they assume that it's now or never lor
Foothills preservation. Stanford's land
use permit will require renewal 10 years
hence, and the same process of review
and approval will then be repeated.
Is it to be assumed that the public will
roll over and play dead if the University
tries at that time to cover the Foothills

with "bigger labs and sports facilities" (or
housing for fatuity, staff and students,
carefully omitted, of course, from the
advertisement)?

What makes President Casper a success?
John 1 lennessy's ascent through the
administration hierarchy has been so
rapid that it's hard to know a whole lot
about him, but, even then, there's hope
yet. Please allow me to explain.
I niversity President Gerhard Casper's
administration was notoriously unwilling
to hear any student input, and sometimes
even appeared downright hostile to stu
dents. Casper's appointees include Jane
Camarillo, Heather Dunn, Marc VVais
and Lois Wagner, all of whom are unpop
ular with students, largely because of the
deaf ear that they have consistently
turned to the student voice. Even former
second-in-command Condoleezza Rice
once said that she would never change a
position because of student protest. And
yet no one seems to notice the overall pat
tern; their boss, President Casper,
remains hewilderingly popular.
I his puzzled me terribly for a long
time, but now I think I understand.
Casper is almost a caricature of himself:
the lovable old professor with the funny
accent (which somehow manages to

sound presidential and comical at the
same time) and the knack t<>i a charis
matic performance at (iaities.
Caspei appeals to sta\ above the fray,
as il (iaities and the Commencement
speech were all his job entailed. Mean
while, he appoints subordinates who
make arbitrary, ill-advised decisions that
diminish the quality of student life. But
ultimate responsibility lor tfiose dec isions
nevei seems to work its wax up; Cerhard
(laspei is the teflon president of Stanford.
I le is our answei to Ronald Reagan.
We have no wax ol knowing whether
llennessy will make anv significant
departure from Caspei s policies. Hut il
he does not. I am glad that he has no lov
able exterioi and cute accent to fall back
on. lor il (ierharcl Casper is Stanford's
own Ronald Reagan, then Mennessx risks
becoming oui (ieorge Bush: a one-term
wimp who shared his predecessor s lack
ol compassion, but not his c harisma.

In the end, Bush could not even out
last his defeated arch-nemesis, Saddam
Hussein. But then again, Clinton and
Casper probably won't outlast Hussein
either. Can Hennessy outlive the Mother
of All Dictators? It all may depend on
whether he can finally open the doors of
administrative decision-making to stu
dent input.

Cl/iss of 1999
Losing Whitman is loss of a community
I'm not writing to be critical of choos
ing W hitman as the Pi I'lii house for next
vear. I know next to nothing about the
attributes or culture of Whitman as a
house. However, it is this inability to crit
ic i/e the choice of house which so clearly
allows me to criticize the fact that any
decision was made at all. This, in turn,
allows me to cast criticism and blame on
the decision maker herself.
I would wager that it would take an
appreciable amount of time living in

W hitman to understand tlie social condi
tions. (liven that whomever made this
decision, let's call her |ane Doe, Jane lot
short, most likely did not go to this
length, it would be lair to assume that she
formed either an incomplete or incorrect
picture of Whitman as a house.
I lowever, and this is kev, she could not
have concluded, no matter how shoclch
her research, that it had no culture. I
would argue that, in most circumstances,
it is quite inevitable that a close conglom
eration of people will generate a unique
relationship that is influenced to some
degree In their physical surroundings.
I hope anyone who has lived on c am
pus anywhere, or been involved in any
sort of group, would agree. Whitman,
Ujamaa, the admissions of lice, the Office
of Residential Kducation, (lounterpoint
and the Pi Phis all have a distinctive c ul
ture specifically because thev are a unique
set of people pursuing unique activities in
a common physical en\ iromnent.
So what then is fine's problem? I he
problem is that she and hei office ac tive
ly, and with intent to lend favor, chose
one community over another. I here is no

escaping that conclusion, it is a fact of the
situation. I nfbrtunately, this is an ethical
c hoice with moral consequences.
112 or whatever reason, one community
was deemed more worthy of the benefit
of housing. Whitman will die because, as
a House (capital H), it needs its roof and
walls to survive just as the Pi l'liis need
their charter.To eliminate communities is
wrong; it has been clone in the past, both
in world history and at Stanford, and 1
hope most will agree that the results have
been regrettable.
I don't think that Jane thought about
the issue that deeph before she chose to
choose and that is too bad. Had she real
ized the implications of her actions to the
moral standing of our institution and her
own personal morality perhaps she would
have chosen not to stamp the Pi Phis with
a gold star over Whitman residents.
Instead, the way to most ethically solve
problems of conflicting communities is
through additive rather than destructive
means. No one should suffer to give the
Pi Phis a house. II it is realized by people
of importance that there is no way to
make a decision without causing harm,

no decision should be made. That would
be exercising admirable moral principles.
On the contrary, this recent decision
exhibited poor institutional ethics on the
part of Res Ed and, therelore, Stanford
and Jane Doe are both morally blame
worthy for its results.

the decision maker herself.
I would wager that it would take an
appreciable amount of time living in

W hitman to understand tlie social condi
tions. (liven that whomever made this
decision, let's call her |ane Doe, Jane lot
short, most likely did not go to this
length, it would be lair to assume that she
formed either an incomplete or incorrect
picture of Whitman as a house.
I lowever, and this is kev, she could not
have concluded, no matter how shoclch
her research, that it had no culture. I
would argue that, in most circumstances,
it is quite inevitable that a close conglom
eration of people will generate a unique
relationship that is influenced to some
degree In their physical surroundings.
I hope anyone who has lived on c am
pus anywhere, or been involved in any
sort of group, would agree. Whitman,
Ujamaa, the admissions of lice, the Office
of Residential Kducation, (lounterpoint
and the Pi Phis all have a distinctive c ul
ture specifically because thev are a unique
set of people pursuing unique activities in
a common physical en\ iromnent.
So what then is fine's problem? I he
problem is that she and hei office ac tive
ly, and with intent to lend favor, chose
one community over another. I here is no

escaping that conclusion, it is a fact of the
situation. I nfbrtunately, this is an ethical
c hoice with moral consequences.
112 or whatever reason, one community
was deemed more worthy of the benefit
of housing. Whitman will die because, as
a House (capital H), it needs its roof and
walls to survive just as the Pi l'liis need
their charter.To eliminate communities is
wrong; it has been clone in the past, both
in world history and at Stanford, and 1
hope most will agree that the results have
been regrettable.
I don't think that Jane thought about
the issue that deeph before she chose to
choose and that is too bad. Had she real
ized the implications of her actions to the
moral standing of our institution and her
own personal morality perhaps she would
have chosen not to stamp the Pi Phis with
a gold star over Whitman residents.
Instead, the way to most ethically solve
problems of conflicting communities is
through additive rather than destructive
means. No one should suffer to give the
Pi Phis a house. II it is realized by people
of importance that there is no way to
make a decision without causing harm,

no decision should be made. That would
be exercising admirable moral principles.
On the contrary, this recent decision
exhibited poor institutional ethics on the
part of Res Ed and, therelore, Stanford
and Jane Doe are both morally blame
worthy for its results.

responds to President Casper
In ;i statement released yesterday, I ni
versity President Gerhard Casper states,
"Ii is disheartening to see Stanford's posi
tion on the Foothills and the general use
permit so thoroughly distorted l>\ our
critics in some of their most recent public
statements and advertisements."
I his from the president of a I niversi
ty that plays with words to manipulate the
public into thinking all is well on the
Farm. 1 heir latest trick is to declare that
there will be no development in the Uni
versity's "Foothills District."
I hey don't mention that the "Foothills
District" keeps shrinking as the I Diversi
ty renames sections of this area that it
would like to develop.
In its General Use Permit application
submitted to Santa Clara County, Stan
ford Management Company has
renamed 154 acres of the Foothills, "Uatli
rop," and is attempting to redesignate this
area as "core campus."
I hey are proposing 20,000 square feet
of development over the next 10 years
(41,000 square feet if you include the
Carnegie Institute), and. after that, the
area could be developed as clenselv as t lie
rest of campus.
The Stanford Open Space Alliance
welcomes a public debate with President
(las per to clear the air on these issues.
Let's hope the president will step out
from behind the University's public rela
tions department and enter into construc

tive dialogue with the entire Stanford
community concerning these questions.

President Emeritus responds
to foothills criticism
Flie advertisement placed by a group
of Stanford alumni in Monday's Daily
reflects an unreal view of the University
and its leadership. If there are Stanford
Trustees or administrators who view
open space as a "a 'frill' in comparison
with the 'basics' of bigger labs and sports
facilities," I have not encountered them.
Fven the most self-interested Stanford
official knows as well as any member of the
(oinniittee for (ireen Foothills that a signif
icant part of the charm that draws talented
people to the University derives from the
tremendous attractiveness of the campus
and its immediate surroundings. It is in the
I niversity's interest to concentrate develop
ment in the core campus, as the proposal
before the County Supervisors docs.
Stanford's critics betray a startling lack
of faith in the democratic process when
they assume that it's now or never lor
Foothills preservation. Stanford's land
use permit will require renewal 10 years
hence, and the same process of review
and approval will then be repeated.
Is it to be assumed that the public will
roll over and play dead if the University
tries at that time to cover the Foothills

with "bigger labs and sports facilities" (or
housing for fatuity, staff and students,
carefully omitted, of course, from the
advertisement)?

What makes President Casper a success?
John 1 lennessy's ascent through the
administration hierarchy has been so
rapid that it's hard to know a whole lot
about him, but, even then, there's hope
yet. Please allow me to explain.
I niversity President Gerhard Casper's
administration was notoriously unwilling
to hear any student input, and sometimes
even appeared downright hostile to stu
dents. Casper's appointees include Jane
Camarillo, Heather Dunn, Marc VVais
and Lois Wagner, all of whom are unpop
ular with students, largely because of the
deaf ear that they have consistently
turned to the student voice. Even former
second-in-command Condoleezza Rice
once said that she would never change a
position because of student protest. And
yet no one seems to notice the overall pat
tern; their boss, President Casper,
remains hewilderingly popular.
I his puzzled me terribly for a long
time, but now I think I understand.
Casper is almost a caricature of himself:
the lovable old professor with the funny
accent (which somehow manages to

sound presidential and comical at the
same time) and the knack t<>i a charis
matic performance at (iaities.
Caspei appeals to sta\ above the fray,
as il (iaities and the Commencement
speech were all his job entailed. Mean
while, he appoints subordinates who
make arbitrary, ill-advised decisions that
diminish the quality of student life. But
ultimate responsibility lor tfiose dec isions
nevei seems to work its wax up; Cerhard
(laspei is the teflon president of Stanford.
I le is our answei to Ronald Reagan.
We have no wax ol knowing whether
llennessy will make anv significant
departure from Caspei s policies. Hut il
he does not. I am glad that he has no lov
able exterioi and cute accent to fall back
on. lor il (ierharcl Casper is Stanford's
own Ronald Reagan, then Mennessx risks
becoming oui (ieorge Bush: a one-term
wimp who shared his predecessor s lack
ol compassion, but not his c harisma.

In the end, Bush could not even out
last his defeated arch-nemesis, Saddam
Hussein. But then again, Clinton and
Casper probably won't outlast Hussein
either. Can Hennessy outlive the Mother
of All Dictators? It all may depend on
whether he can finally open the doors of
administrative decision-making to stu
dent input.
