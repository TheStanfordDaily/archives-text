Stanford Open Space Alliance
responds to President Casper
In ;i statement released yesterday, I ni
versity President Gerhard Casper states,
"Ii is disheartening to see Stanford's posi
tion on the Foothills and the general use
permit so thoroughly distorted l>\ our
critics in some of their most recent public
statements and advertisements."
I his from the president of a I niversi
ty that plays with words to manipulate the
public into thinking all is well on the
Farm. 1 heir latest trick is to declare that
there will be no development in the Uni
versity's "Foothills District."
I hey don't mention that the "Foothills
District" keeps shrinking as the I Diversi
ty renames sections of this area that it
would like to develop.
In its General Use Permit application
submitted to Santa Clara County, Stan
ford Management Company has
renamed 154 acres of the Foothills, "Uatli
rop," and is attempting to redesignate this
area as "core campus."
I hey are proposing 20,000 square feet
of development over the next 10 years
(41,000 square feet if you include the
Carnegie Institute), and. after that, the
area could be developed as clenselv as t lie
rest of campus.
The Stanford Open Space Alliance
welcomes a public debate with President
(las per to clear the air on these issues.
Let's hope the president will step out
from behind the University's public rela
tions department and enter into construc

tive dialogue with the entire Stanford
community concerning these questions.

President Emeritus responds
to foothills criticism
Flie advertisement placed by a group
of Stanford alumni in Monday's Daily
reflects an unreal view of the University
and its leadership. If there are Stanford
Trustees or administrators who view
open space as a "a 'frill' in comparison
with the 'basics' of bigger labs and sports
facilities," I have not encountered them.
Fven the most self-interested Stanford
official knows as well as any member of the
(oinniittee for (ireen Foothills that a signif
icant part of the charm that draws talented
people to the University derives from the
tremendous attractiveness of the campus
and its immediate surroundings. It is in the
I niversity's interest to concentrate develop
ment in the core campus, as the proposal
before the County Supervisors docs.
Stanford's critics betray a startling lack
of faith in the democratic process when
they assume that it's now or never lor
Foothills preservation. Stanford's land
use permit will require renewal 10 years
hence, and the same process of review
and approval will then be repeated.
Is it to be assumed that the public will
roll over and play dead if the University
tries at that time to cover the Foothills

with "bigger labs and sports facilities" (or
housing for fatuity, staff and students,
carefully omitted, of course, from the
advertisement)?

President Emeritus
What makes President Casper a success?
John 1 lennessy's ascent through the
administration hierarchy has been so
rapid that it's hard to know a whole lot
about him, but, even then, there's hope
yet. Please allow me to explain.
I niversity President Gerhard Casper's
administration was notoriously unwilling
to hear any student input, and sometimes
even appeared downright hostile to stu
dents. Casper's appointees include Jane
Camarillo, Heather Dunn, Marc VVais
and Lois Wagner, all of whom are unpop
ular with students, largely because of the
deaf ear that they have consistently
turned to the student voice. Even former
second-in-command Condoleezza Rice
once said that she would never change a
position because of student protest. And
yet no one seems to notice the overall pat
tern; their boss, President Casper,
remains hewilderingly popular.
I his puzzled me terribly for a long
time, but now I think I understand.
Casper is almost a caricature of himself:
the lovable old professor with the funny
accent (which somehow manages to
