### JOHN HUETTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I ( )i about an hour last I liursday, Stan
lord students enjovccl a unique fountain
hopping opportunity.
()n April (Â», at about 5:45 p.m., .111 un
named driver in a I oyota Land Cruiser
backed into a lire livdrant outside of Ster
ling Quadrangle 011 Santa I eresa Street.
I I if lire hydrant, and part of the pipe un
derneath it, were knocked completely out
of the street.
Instantly, a jet of water higher than the
tree behind tlie hvdram burst into the
sk\, releasing the liisi of the estimated
hundreds of thousands of gallons lost by
the accident.
Andrew Dimock, director ol Adams,
one of the dormitories in Freshman/
Sophomore (College, was one ol the first
to notice the accident. "It was not a very
loud impact," he said. "What was loud
was the sound of the water."
"1 thought, sounds like a hose," Di
mock said. "I went outside - sounds like a
waterfall!"
At this point, Dimock saw the water
spouting from the ground and reported
it to the authorities.
"I called the cops and said it was about

25 feet high, and they didn't believe it,"
1 )imock laughed.
Meanwhile, a crowd of Freshman/
Sophomore College students quickly
gathered around the geyser of water
spreading down Santa'l'eresa Street.
1 .aughing residents took oil their san
dals and raced them in the rushing
water. Students also danced in the pow
erful spray, waded at the base of the
"fountain" and rushed to photograph
the event.
"I heard this noise, and it sounded like
wind rustling the trees," remembered
freshman Patrick Perez. "I looked out the
window. 1 grabbed my camera and ran
out."
"I came out here after dinner, and it
was raining water down the road," said
freshman Fllie Cettinger. "It was fun."
"I walked up from my practice and
said, 'Whoa!'" said freshman CJwen Am
bler. "You can see [the spray] all the way
from Campus Drive!"
Freshman Matt Cornwell remem
bered thinking, "What the hell? I here's a
giant fountain in FroSoCo!" He also
dashed out to join the onlookers.
"The fountain exploded!" cheered
freshman Sam Brown.
He laughed, "It's a great community
building activity going 011 -a really special
thing.''
(lettinger joked, "Nothing brings peo
ple closer than destruction."
I'lie excitement continued as mo
torists attempted to wash their cars in the
blast of water, and students readied "Big

Bertha" - a giant toboggan-to sled down
the street.
()ther onlookers began to c hant, "Save
water now!"
Meanwhile, three Freshman/Sopho
more College residents threw the Diinock
into the geyser.
About 30 minutes after the incident
began, Stanford police and lire depart
ment officials shut down the streets and
set about solving the problem.
I he incident lasted about an hour,
ending when Facilities Operation worker
Richard Sou/.a drove his truck (ironical!)
sporting a "Save Water Now" bumper
sticker) over the gushing main in an odd
looking, but standard, procedure.
I bis action redirected the spray and
allowed Souza to shut off the flow from an
underground valve.
As the residents cheered and applaud
ed him, lire department men pulled his
truck out (if the hole with chains and
loaded the hydrant onto its bed.
Students returned to their dorms,
some keeping the fun alive with a squirt
gun fight.
As the impact was unintentional, no
legal penalty will be imposed upon the
driver except repair costs generally cov
ered by auto insurance.
Accidents involving hydrant destruc
tion are somewhat common at Stanford,
reported Palo Alto Fire Captain Patrick
Morris. "[ I hev occur] on campus, two to
10 times a year, in common places - near
intersections following accidents, and
near the stadium."
