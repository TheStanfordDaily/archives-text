## Goodwin leaves a legacy At 73, the man who coached Martin, Begay and Woods sees improvements like Raye's as his greatest acheivement 
### MATT LONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For Wally Goodwin, improvement is
the highest form of success. So when
Goodwin retires at the conclusion of this
season, his 13th at the helm of the Stan
ford men's goll team, he will have been
very successful.
When Goodwin reminisces upon the
highlights of his career at Stanford, conspic -
uously absent is the national championship
in 1994, which came coupled with NCAA
Coach of the Year honors. I le fails to talk
much of the nine Ail-Americans he helped
develop into fine golfers.
Instead he humbly boasts of the men that
came to Stanford without a golf pedigree
and of the award for as the most improved
team in the country in 1991.
"You'd think that the national champi
onship would be the big deal," Goodwin
says."For the kids and the University it was,
but really not for me. It was awesome, but as
a coach you have to look at ever) year and
everything that happens.
"One of my favorite years was at the Na
tional Championships in Pebble Beach
when Casey [Martin] was a freshman and we
got the award for most improved team in
America — boy that started it. It was such a
phenomenal thing to happen." Goodwin
says.
"We wound up ninth or 15th in t he coun
try, but we had started from the bottom of
the barrel."
Goodwin took up golf after college,
where he attended the University of Vir
ginia and graduated in 1951 after serving a
tour of duty in World War 11. He started
coaching over 40 years ago, beginning in
Colorado Springs with high school basket
ball, ancl football. Playing golf continuously,
Goodwin took the time to win several ama
teur championships in his home state of
Wyoming.
But coaching is Goodwin's first love, and
his first college position was as an assistant
basketball coach at Stetson College in Flori

da. A six-year stint at Northwestern as the
head golf coach preceded his hiring as Stan
ford head coach in 1987.
"Stanford [golf] seemed to have been de
pressed a little hit," says Goodwin. "There
were great kids when I arrived, wonderful
boys, and we had a big tryout. 112 didn't pay
any special attention to anybody.
"We progressed immensely that first
year. I lie) were receptive to me, and we got
along great and only missed going to na
tional championship by one shot."
I lie next fall, the soft spoken skipper
landed his first top recruit, Christian Cevear
from France. Cevear had played at a high
school in Pebble Beach where Goodwin had
served .is athletic director.
Goodwin once again hit the recruiting
jackpot the year after that, signing Casey
Martin and Notah Begay. I liese three
golfers combined to earn six All-America
honors, and the Stanford golf juggernaut
was rolling in just three short years.
"You get one gu\ like that in your life
time, so it's a rare thing to get two of them in
the same year" Goodwin says. "Then Tiger
showed up |in 19941, and we were off and
running."
Hearing Goodwin tell the tale, it makes
one wonder what played a larger role in the
attendance of the big names — the prestige
and beauty of Stanford or the opportunity to
play for the modern patriarch of Stanford
golf.
Aside from the victories, Goodwin has
formed the men's golf program into a self
sustaining entity.
Kverv golf scholarship, as well as many of
the golf Operations, are privately endowed,
and Stanford hosts two tournaments during
the season.
I he Nelson Invitational is run every fall
and is sponsored l>\ a friend of Goodwin's
from Wyoming. On Ma\ 5, the Stanford In
tercollegiate will bring some of the nation's
top teams to compete at the farm.
" I hat realh helps to put us on the map,"
says Goodwin. "When you have a tourna
ment of vour own and invite top teams out,
then they invite you to theirs' and it works
out great."
Goodwin's program is so organized, in
fact, that when new coach Jeff Mitchell ar
rives, he will have little to do besides meet
the players and continue the legacy.
"My ultimate goal when 1 eventually did

decide to leave was to leave the
golf program so that the next
person could come in sit down
and coach and not have to go
through all that I had to do,"
Goodwin says. "lie's gonna
come in and have a helluva
time."
Mitchell, currently the
women's coach at I'exas lech,
recognizes the scope of Good
win's success.
"Wally Goodwin has clone an
exceptional job, and I look for
ward to continuing that tradi
tion," he said.
Back to improvement, Good
winTcmeni'bers his greatest tri
umph with a golfer, Gonrad
Raye.
"Guys like Gonrad Raye —
unbelievable. Simph because he
came as a 255 pound, (> feet 2
inch first-team all-state nose
tackle from Minnesota. And he
had a set of clubs and wanted to
learn how to play golf.
"In four years he made him
self into an exceptional player.
He' s out playing pro golf now.
He was incessant, dail\ calling
me up, saying, 'Goach, please
come down, you gotta look at
me.' I le made the most progress
of anybody."
And that's exactly what (Good
will has loved about all his years
teaching competition, sports
and life.
"Forty years of coaching, but
I should [retire]. 1 m 7S, the kids
wanted [wife Nancy and 1) to go
back to the ranch in Wyoming,"
he remarks, a lump building in
his throat.
"It's the thing to do, and
when something is the thing to
do, vou do it."
