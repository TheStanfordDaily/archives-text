# Hockey's thugs observe a day of rest
## 
### 
Not even many sports fans
recognized it, but this
weekend saw one of the
most shocking, unbeliev
able events possible in modern sports
take place.
I'm not talking about Griffey's
400 th homer or Tiger Woods actual
ly losing a tournament — and lately,
if he doesn't win, it means he lost —
or the Washington State pitching
staff holding Stanford to a less-than
ten-run margin of victory Saturday.
I'm talking about the first penalty
free game in the National Hockey
League in twenty years. And I'm talk
ing about that game that was played
between the Detroit Red Wings and
the Colorado Avalanche.
At first glance, this event may seem

to have all t he dailv
relevance of. say,
Koko the gorilla's
predictions for the
upcoming presiden
tial elections. Bui
bear with inc.
Anyone from ei
ther Michigan or
Colorado who fol-

lows hockey even casually (which is
probably redundant for the Michi
ganers), as well as most NHL fans,
knows that in the last few years, the
Red Wings-Avalanche rivalry has
been the most dirty and vicious sports
rivalry since Athens and Sparta took
turns throwing each other's babies
into ravines.
Things haven't quite gotten that

bad between these two teams, but in
the last few years, we've seen:
• Bench-clearing brawls that once
involved the two teams' goalies going
at it, gladiator-style, at center ice;
• Both teams' fans chanting slo
gans about the opposing team's bodi
ly parts that would get the full Man
Club thrown off campus faster than
an associate professor filing a labor
lawsuit;
• One game bloody enough to in
spire a "profanity-laced " confronta
tion between the Red Wings' coach
and an Avalanche player in the park
ing lot outside t he game.
And yet we had Sunday a game in
which these two clubs didn't so much
