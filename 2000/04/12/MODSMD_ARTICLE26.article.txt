# Hockey's thugs observe a day of rest
## 
### 
Not even many sports fans
recognized it, but this
weekend saw one of the
most shocking, unbeliev
able events possible in modern sports
take place.
I'm not talking about Griffey's
400 th homer or Tiger Woods actual
ly losing a tournament — and lately,
if he doesn't win, it means he lost —
or the Washington State pitching
staff holding Stanford to a less-than
ten-run margin of victory Saturday.
I'm talking about the first penalty
free game in the National Hockey
League in twenty years. And I'm talk
ing about that game that was played
between the Detroit Red Wings and
the Colorado Avalanche.
At first glance, this event may seem

to have all t he dailv
relevance of. say,
Koko the gorilla's
predictions for the
upcoming presiden
tial elections. Bui
bear with inc.
Anyone from ei
ther Michigan or
Colorado who fol-

lows hockey even casually (which is
probably redundant for the Michi
ganers), as well as most NHL fans,
knows that in the last few years, the
Red Wings-Avalanche rivalry has
been the most dirty and vicious sports
rivalry since Athens and Sparta took
turns throwing each other's babies
into ravines.
Things haven't quite gotten that

bad between these two teams, but in
the last few years, we've seen:
• Bench-clearing brawls that once
involved the two teams' goalies going
at it, gladiator-style, at center ice;
• Both teams' fans chanting slo
gans about the opposing team's bodi
ly parts that would get the full Man
Club thrown off campus faster than
an associate professor filing a labor
lawsuit;
• One game bloody enough to in
spire a "profanity-laced " confronta
tion between the Red Wings' coach
and an Avalanche player in the park
ing lot outside t he game.
And yet we had Sunday a game in
which these two clubs didn't so much


Jeff Cooper
as lift a stick or drop a glove in
anger, the cleanest game since
Jimmy Carter was in the White
I louse.
I his disturbs me. It disturbs
me for a couple of reasons.
Ihe NHL has had perhaps
its most turbulent year in
decades this season, relating to
a series of highly publicized and
increasingly bloody lights, at
tacks and injuries that have left
superstars sidelined and ordi
nary players in comas, on life
support or, in one case, blind in
one eye.
Certainly, the NHL isn't re
sponsible for accidental injury,
although given the severity of
some of the accidents (his year,
one might ask il perhaps the
speed and strength of today's
weight-trained, vitamin-pop
ping skater has begun to exceed
the protective measures of
equipment and rules enforce
ment the league can affect. But
the accidents don't worry me as
much as the assaults and the
culture of violence that increas
ing!) surrounds the game.
I he thing about Sunday's

contest was that it was a terrible
hockey game. Both teams are in
the playoffs already, and both
teams played like they were at a
grade-school ice skating birth
day party. Detroit rested most
of lheir star players for the
game.
Don't get me wrong; 1 don't
begrudge the teams the oppor
tunity to take a break before the
playoffs.
But 1 ask: has vicious assault
and revenge become so much a
part of the NHL that any game
lacking physical violence isn't
worth watching?
Hockey is, by its nature, a
contact sport and a pretty nasty
one at that. But the other hock
ey on television in the last week
was the NCAA championship
between North Dakota and
Boston College.Anyone that
thinks that great hockey games
alwavs involve lighting and bru
tality need only check out a tape
of that game. It was physical,
emotional, and hard-hitting —
but no one went out there look
ing to injure anybody. 1 hey
were looking to win.
My worry is that the new lev
els of injury and blood in the
sport are becoming such a part
of watching a hockey game that
they are dragging the NHL the

way of the NBA. Basketball is a
team sport, but in the last few
years, most people watch NBA
games to watch Jordan, or Ciar
nett, or Carter dominate some
body.
The NHL has done a lot this
year, at least superficially, to
break down the stereotype. But
more needs to be done. Profes
sional hot key will never inspire
the same sort of pure effort as a
college championship game,
not in an 82-game season. But
the league can crack down fur
ther — a lot further — on fight
ing and the oft-twisted code of
hockey ethics that demands a
stick to the temple for a check to
the goalie.
It's an old joke: "1 went to
fight Saturday night and a
hot key game broke out." Sun
day's game, by the very surprise
of its cleanliness, highlights the
problem with modern hockey
more than a brawl would have.
When good hockey can't be
played without beatings, the
NHL has nowhere to go but
down.
After this year, it doesn't
have a lot further to go.

It'll Cooper, <i junior, would like to
thank Marvel Productions for the
magic of the Transformers.
