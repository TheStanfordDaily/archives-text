# Women survive late Bear rally at Taube
## Strong doubles match from Irvin and Ashley quashes Cal threat 
### BILL HANSON STAFF WRITER 
At around three o'clock yester
day afternoon, it seemed as if it
would be another easy day for the
top-ranked Cardinal women's ten
nis team (20-0, 8-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference).
After an hour of play, four of six
singles matches with No. 6 Califor
nia had already been claimed by
Stanford players.
At No. 1 singles, sophomore
Marissa Irvin, ranked third in the
nation, extended her unblemished
singles record to 15-0 with a routine
6-1, 6-3 victory over California's
Anita Kurimay.
"Marissa's always great," said
freshman Laura Granville, the na
tion's fourth-ranked player who sat
out the dual match with torn liga
ments in her ribcage, a tennis-relat
ed injury. "She hasn't lost a match
this year. It's always nice to know
that your No. 1 player is gonna
come out and win the matches."
Sophomores Lauren Kalvaria
and Keiko Tokuda, along with se
nior Jennifer Heiser, also won their
matches in straight sets.
Of course, a team needs five
points in order to secure victory,
and a determined Cal squad dis
played more resilience yesterday
than it had in its previous encoun
ters with the Cardinal.
In fact, once the Bears began to
mount an impressive rally, it
seemed as if they might hand the
Cardinal its first defeat in over a
year. .After all, Cal was the last team
to defeat Stanford — a narrow 5-4
decision in March of 1999.
Suspense grew as senior Teryn

Ashley and sophomore Cabriela
Lastra both lost their singles match
es in three sets.
After claiming the first set in a
tie-breaker, Ashley was over
whelmed by the aggressive net-play
of Cal's Amy Jensen, losing the sec
ond set, 6-2. With a flurry of fore
hand winners, Jensen went on to
take the third, 6-0.
"11 was pretty close," Ashley said.
"I was proud of how I fought at the
beginning of the third set, but then
1 let the frustration of her great play
get to me. But that's the first three
set match I've played in a while."
While Ashley lost, her game
seems intact. She is finally healthy
after struggling to recover from the
tendinitis in her wrist she had suf
fered from throughout the first half
of the season. Over the weekend,
she beat players from both UCLA
and USC.
Lastra seemed out of sorts dur
ing her first loss of 2000, succumb
ing to Cal's Karoline Borgerson, 6-
0,3-6,6-1.
"Borgerson just came out really
hot," Granville said. "Gaby fought
back in the second set, but I think
Borgerson just had a really good
day."
Thus, with Stanford leading 4-2,
the doubles matches became criti
cal. While it seemed unlikely that
Cal could sweep all three doubles
matches, after the Bears leapt to 7-
1 leads at both No. 2 and No. 3 po
sitions, an upset seemed all too fea
sible.
Stanford's top duo of Irvin and
Ashley, however, refused to let the
suspense build any further. ! he na
tion's fifth-ranked squad quickly
over-powered Cal's team of Kuri
may and Borgerson, 8-4.
"I knew 1 owed my team at least
a point," Ashley said. "So I knew
from the start that I was going to
play a great doubles match. It was
good for the team to come through
under pressure.''
Watching from the sidelines, Granville
w«is impressed In her team's tenacity.
"I feel like the whole team has raised the
level of their games," (•ranville said. "I S( 1,
I CIA, C.al — those are some really tough
teams and we took t are ol ;ill ol them.
" l itis year, we haven't had that many
dose matches, so it's always good to win
matches like this."
