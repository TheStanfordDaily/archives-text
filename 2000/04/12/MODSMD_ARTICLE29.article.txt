# 'Nontraditional transfers' enrich the Farm
## Transfer students add wisdom, experience to undergrad mix 
### VALENTINE DING CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I nlike most freshmen who arrive on cam
pus ,i seat aftei graduating from high school,
Shintaro Yamaguchi arrived on the Farm in
winter 1998 from, ironically, a fai in.
I lie institute lie- transferred from is Deep
Springs College in I.astern California. Located
in an isolated high desert valley the si/eof Ma
nhattan, Deep Springs is a two-year, non-de
gree-oflering college where 2(> male students
milk cows, repaii corrals and in igate lands iu
addition to attending c lasses. I pon his trans
fer, Yamaguchi suddenlv found himself living
in a dorm of(>()() students and sitting in lectures
with people he never met before and possibly
would never meet again. I le ac know ledges that
Stanford represents, inothei extreme in his col
lege experience.
"F.ach war we receive between 1,100 and
I ,HOO applications for transfer spots," said Joan
1 .ippnian, Senioi Associate Director of I ntler
graduate Admission. Among these applicants,
usually around 100 are selected.
According to I ippnian, Stan ford has a long
historv of successful transfer students. In re
cent vears, some transfers became Rhodes
s( h<>lars, s< niie < oinpleted their co-terminal de
grees here and niauv others took advantage of
ovei seas studies ,uid honors opportunities.
"Asa transfer student, I know pretl\ much
what I'm choosing fin life," said Yamaguchi.
Insisting Deep Springs was his "formative ex
perience, lie explained that the reason lie
( ame here was academics.
Foi Duncan Atkinson-Hager, who trans
fer red in '99, being at Sianfi >rd means using the
abundant resoun es to acquire* prat tical knowl
edge and skills in at cordanc e with his career as
pirations. I lis long-term plan alter school is to
i un his own business.
Atkinson-Hager has divided his college
vears among San Francisco State I Diversity,
MontercN Peninsula (ollege in Monterey, CA,
112 oothill ( ollege mI os Altos, (!.\ and now Stan

ford. Between SK State, from which Ik* was ex
pelled in 1990 because of poor grades, and
Monterey Peninsula in tall 1997, he worked as
a store manager ai Starbucks Coffee in San
Francisco.
At age 28, Atkinson-Hager is one of the so
called "nonlraditional transfers." Although
there are no such admission quotas, each year
around 259? of the incoming transfers are con
sidered "nontiaditional'-students who are
over the age of 25 and who didn't have chance
to complete college after high school.
"Recently, we have admitted a former ma
rine, a professional ballet dancer, a monk, sin
gle moms, a carpenter, working dads with
wives iu graduate school, working moms with
stay-at-home dads, etc ~" said Lippman.
"I was looking for a school where t can push
myself," said Atkinson-Hager about his deci
sion to transfer. "I need a place that can recog
nize the value of what 1 have done outside
school."
Now a Symbolic System major, he was ad
justing to Stanford's rigorous academic life.
" There's a large assumption of knowledge
|here]," said Atkinson-Hager. "Because of
higher expectations, I have to read more and
hand in more problem sets."
Yamaguchi agreed that Stanford was keep
ing liilll busy. Intending to major in Interna
tional Relations, lie has taken courses in Amer
ican history, a seminar on war and decision
making and popular lectures like Biological
Involution. He also went to various guest lec
tures on campus. Right now he's considering
writing honors thesis on the role of Atomic
Bomb in World War 11.
" I ransfers are usually excited about the op
portunities Stanford has to offer," said Lipp
man. "They appreciate things freshmen nor
mally take for granted."
But going to college is not all about acade
mics. Despite his repeated statement about the
passion for learning at Stanford, Yamaguchi
mentioned the unique c haracteristics of social
life in a comprehensive university.
"I'm anonymous here," he said. "It's noth
ing like Deep Springs, where you are directly
confronted with 25 other men every clay. You
have to respect and accept every one of them.
You become critical in a tight community.

Whereas at Stanford, you can enjoy the variety
of ideas and life styles while not having to im
pinge upon others. I'm happy about this
anonymity."
Atkinson-Hager, in contrast, sees it differ
ently.
"It's the first time in eight years that 1 have a
roommate," he said. "I enjoy the social aspects
[of living in a dorm]. But it also reminds me of
how hard it is to make adjustments from child
hood to early adulthood."
He named financial independence and per
sonal responsibility as two adjustments.
"You make mistakes and have yourself there
to take care of them. That's what it's like to be
an adult," said he.
"Transfers bring different perspectives and
each year we are not disappointed," said L-ipp
man.
In 1998 Stanford admitted 126 transfer stu
dents. However, there were only 31 transfer
spots in 1999, due to the large number of fresh
men who accepted the offer of admission.
According to Lippman, this year Stanford
admitted 300 fewer freshmen and the admis
sion office is meeting later this month to deter
mine how many transfer students to enroll next
fall.
"By all indications, it appears that we will be
looking to enroll approximately 100 new trans
fer students," said Lippman.
But what do transfers miss in their early ex
perience?
"There's no point of comparing Stanford
with Deep Springs," said Yamaguchi. "Howev
er, it's tempting to ask 'Am I making the most
of my life?' In Deep Springs, we do everything
together: academics, labor, self-governance. At
Stanford, everyone does his own thing. The
key is how you justify your existence for your
self."
Atkinson-f lager is missing the age diversity
he saw in Foothill and, to a larger extent, the so
ciety he already knew.
"But I'm glad 1 came back to college," he
said. "I discovered discipline within myself that
1 had not tapped into."
I le also revealed that he's applying to be a
Resident Assistant next year.
"I hope 1 can make some of the transitions
easy," he said.
