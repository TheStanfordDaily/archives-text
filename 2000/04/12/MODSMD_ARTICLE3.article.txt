I lie- Foothills will remain oil
limits to Stanford construction, at
Icasi lot the immediate future, the
Board o! I rustees affirmed in its
meeting litis week.
"We have no plans to develop
am thing west o| Junipero Serra,"
s.iid Robert bass, c hairman of the
hoard. "The reason there's open
space is because Stanford has been
a ver\ responsible steward of its
space."
I lowever. he later clarified that
although there will be no develop
ment now, the board did not rule
out the possibility of future con
struction.

"We do not
know what the
future use of the
land may be,
nor how it will
ailed Stanford's
premiere stand
ing in the
world." he said.
Current de-

bate over Stan
ford's land use stems from the ef
fort made b\ students and alumni
to preserve the foothills from de
velopment. A group called Stan
lord Open Space Alliance rallied
Mondav to preserve the Foothills

from development.
I lie current (iencral I se Per
mit restricts the I niversity to
147,000 leet ol development. I lie
permit should be renewed, with
new limitations set, within the
year. I he permit provides a cap
on building square footage, park
ing spat es ,uid other development
on tlie Stanford central eampus
«md restricts development in the
foothills. Kill within these (ou
st raitits, Stanford has considerable
leeway.
Alumnus Doug Bom n, a ineni
bei of the alliance, is not satisfied.
"As .m alumnus, I enjoyed the
campus the wa\ it was |in the earl)
70s] and having the open spaces
was vei \ therapeutic. I here has to
be a limit to this expansion, and I'd
like to see it set now rat lum than
later."

Mass emphasized that not all de
velopment is detrimental to the
coniinunitx.
"It's arguable whether Silicon
Valle) would be here toda\ had
Stanford not developed the Re
search l'ark on some of its land.
And ill.u has turned out to have
consequences far bevond the
imagination of people at that
lime." I lie board also reiterated ils
approval ol Piovost |ohn I len
ncss\ as the I niversit) s next pres
ident.
"|ohn has demonstrated ver\
sound judgment. I le has the uni
versal admiration of his col
leagues within the I niversitv,"
Bass said.
Noi does he feel that the tran
sition from the position of provost
to president will cause any turbu
lence within the administration.
"lie loves Stanford, lie bleeds
Cardinal. \nd I think that lie will
be able to hit the ground i mining
and make a great deal of progress
towards institutionalizing Stan

ford Introductory Studies and fo
( using on Stanford's uudei gradu
ate program while maintaining
i Stanford's position in engineering
I and the sciences," he said.
Bass was unwilling to discuss
the recent court decision concern
ing former Medical School re
searcher Colleen Crangle. A jur\
recently upheld Crangle's claim
that she was fired in retaliation for
her complaints of gender discrim
ination and ruled that Stanford
must pay $545,000 in punitive and
compensatory damages to Cran
gle.
I lie Labor Department is in
vestigating the discrimination
complaints of (irangle and others.
Stanford stands to lose $500 mil
lion in federal grants and contracts
should the Department find evi
dence of ongoing discrimination.
» "I think the verdict is disap-
I pointing, but beyond that, it's not
appropriate to comment. I he
legal process mav not be at its
end," Bass said.
