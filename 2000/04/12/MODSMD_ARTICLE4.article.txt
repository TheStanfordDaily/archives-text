While some are staunch supporters of Ne/hat's

that his data are lorded and that his work raises seri

Much ol the cont i overs\ started in 1988 with a case

sparked an investigation into the surgeon's past that
followed the brothers to Stanford.
Trouble at Stanford
In 1993 the Stan lord Medical (ienici did not have
a fulK accredited ohsteirics/gynccolog) department,
which harmed thel Diversity's st.uiis. Stanford hired
Caiman and Kan in 1993 iu an attempt to bring
greatei prestige to the department, Ceana joined
them in 199 a.
Camran Ne/hat, who came to the I nited States

from Iran iu 1971, began his career in Vtlanta with a
private practice and a position at Northside I lospital.
I lis brothers soon joined him there, and the three pi

Caiman specialized in treating endometriosis, a

Art goes upright
Workers prepare for the opening of the Undergraduate Research Opportunites art exhibit, which opened last week
and will showcase student art for the rest of the month.
Ed on cancer patients and per
formed heart and brain surgery,
experimenting with their minimal
ly-invasive techniques in all fields.
Spirtos' warnings to the depart
ment in HKM were ignored, ac
cording to I he San Fransico
Chronicle.
Dr. loin Margolis, a former
Stanford Medical School proles
sol, told the Chronicle, " I here are
serious, serious problems going on
at Stanford. Certain people are
covering this up because there is a
licll of a lot of money going to Stan
ford because of the Nezhats."
In the Chronicle, Margolis de
scribes watching Fair Nezhat per
form laparoscopic surgery in
which he severed the patient's
ureter. Margolis assumed that the
cut was an unwelcome but un
avoidable mistake in a complicated
surgeiy, but Nezhat latei said that
the cut was a deliberate attempt to
remove endometriosis on the
ureter. Margolis said he was
shocked, since the pathology re
ports showed no evidence of en
dometriosis on the ureter.
Margolis' complaints went
unanswered and he left Stanford
in 1998. "Ilie data which [the
Nezhats] have published, includ
ing the rectal cversion procedure,
is fraudulent, yet their public ations
are being accepted as standards in

tlit- surgical community. Stanford,
by not auditing this clinical data,
has ignored the concerns of scores
of surgeons," Margolis wrote in a
letter to the chief of staff of the
Medical Center.
The Mullen Case
Stacey Mullen, 28, afflicted with
endometriosis, came to Nezhat for
surgery in 1988, according to the
Chronicle. After a quick proce
dure, she left the hospital, claiming
a near-miraculous recovery and no
side effects. Some months later, the
pain returned and she went back
to Nezhat for what she thought was
going to be a brief surgery to cor
rect the problem. Instead, Nezhat
performed a long and complicated
operation in which he cut loose
Mullen's colon, removed it
through her anus, excised en
dometrial tissue and replaced the
colon.
Following the surgery, Mullen
suffered many painful side effects.
I wo years and $ 1 million in hospi
tal bills later, she received a colosto
my to correct the problem.
" I hose bastards ruined my
life," Mullen told the Chronicle.
When Mullen's lawyer, James
Neal, began to research the
Nezhats, lie discovered an article
in the medical journal Surgical La
paroscope' & Endoscopy in which
Nezhat detailed his use of the
colon-removal procedure on Hi
other women. Mullen's case and
her side effects were not men
tioned.

Nezhat wrote in his operative
notes on Mullen, "There was evi
dence of severe endometriosis of
the rectum." Hut Mullen's patholo
gy reports revealed no en
dometriosis at all. Apparently, the
entire surgery had been unneces
sary.
Neal sent letters to the Nezhats
calling their procedures "barbar
ic." He noted the similarities be
tween their techniques and that of
an older cancer surgery which had
been discredited due to a 50 per
cent complication rate.
Neal requested to see the med
ical records of the other 16 cases,
but Nezhat refused to release
them, citing patient privacy.
Nezhat claimed that Mullen's com
plications were due to her condi
tion, not his surgical procedures.
Neal and Mullen continued to
pursue Nezhat until he released an
affidavit in 1994 claiming that lie
could not provide his other 16
cases because he could not find
them in his filing system. Nezhat
said that his files were not cross
referenced or indexed, and that it
would disturb his practice severely
if he were to search through them
for the 16.
Nezhat's claims raised serious
questions about the accuracy of his
data.
Mai golis said, "I have one ques
tion for Stanford. If they're going
to publicly defend the Nezhats,
then at the least I would assume
that they've taken the time to read
the paper regarding those 16 pa

tients who had their colons re
moved and read the 16 medical
records that correspond to those
patients."
Current conflicts
Camran Nezhat and his broth
ers have many staunch supporters
at Stanford who dismiss charges
against Nezhat as the complaints of
jealous competitors.
"I think he's an excellent sur
geon," said Mary Polan, chief
of Stanford's obstetrics and gyne
cology department. "What is so
special about Camran is he's tech
nically very gifted."
Salli Tazuke, a resident associ
ate for gynecology and obstetrics,
compares watching Camran per
form surgery to watching an
opera: "It's so beautiful."
But Margolis counters the claim
that he is merely a jealous competi
tor by saying that both he and Spir
tos work in different area of exper
tise than the Nezhats.
"If the dean believes this is an
issue of competition, isn't the dean
admitting that they're practicing
outside their areas of expertise?"
Margolis said. "The only fellow
ship they've supposedly clone was
in endocrinology. Ask the dean
how come Dr. Nezhat is not board
specialized in the specialty for
which he did his fellowship. He
only has the certification in gener
al gynecology."
Margolis is one of 50 doctors
who have filed public complaints
against the Nezhats. But their re

quests for information have gone
unanswered.
Tazuke and others at Stanford
Medical Center feel that the recent
investigations of Nezhat are a re
sult of a misinformed public and
bad press. Recent articles in The
San Francisco Chronicle and The
San Jose Mercury News focusing
on Nezhat solicited angry respons
es from members of Stanford's
medical community.
"Dr. Nezhat fully deserves his
excellent reputation as a pioneer in
laparoscopic surgery. He is widely
regarded as one of the finest tech
nical surgeons in the world," wrote
Mark Vierra, Medical School assis
tant professor of surgery, in a letter
to The Mercury News on March
18.
Polan said, "My feeling is that
there was a lot of misinformation in
those news articles, and that misin
formation should be straightened
out."
"Complications can occur dur
ing surgery, and you can walk
down the street and get hit by a
car," said Tazuke, in response to
the Mullen case.According to
Tazuke, Gene Bauer, vice presi
dent of Stanford Hospital and
Clinics, wrote a formal letter to all
the staff in the Medical Center. In
the letter, Bauer clarified issues he
felt were not made clear in the
newspaper articles, including the
allegations that Stanford was help
ing to cover up shoddy medical
practices such as allowing the
Nezhats to perform surgery out

side of their area of expertise.
Bauer's letter states, "Stanford
Hospital has conducted several in
vestigations into allegations
brought against the Nezhats about
the medical care they provide to
patients at Stanford. The hospital
has found no support for the alle
gations that there was any wrong
doing or substandard care at Stan
ford by the Nezhats. Throughout
their affiliation with Stanford, the
Nezhats have provided excellent
care to patients at our hospital, and
they have been cleared of every al
legation to date."
"That information [about un
ethical practices] was all prior to his
coming to Stanford," said Polan.
"He had a general surgeon in the
operating room with him. To my
knowledge, he has never done
cases outside his area of expertise."
Bauer's letter corroborates
Polan's assertion, saying that since
the cases in question were per
formed in Georgia they are outside
Stanford's jurisdiction.
In 1996 a quality assurance
committee reviewed the Nezhats'
procedures and cleared them on
all counts.Bauer said that the Uni
versity is currently reviewing addi
tional information about the
Nezhats, and that a second quality
assurance investigation is under
way. Details of the investigation are
confidential.
Margolis suggested what he fell
the simplest way to solve this con
troversy accurately, "Look at the
charts."
