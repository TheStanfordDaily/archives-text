John Wilson Lewis, William Haas Professor Emeritus of Chinese Politics at
Stanford University, is one the founders of the field of contemporary China studies. After
receiving a doctorate from UCLA, he taught at Cornell University before coming to Stanford
in 1968. He founded and directed Stanford's Center for East Asian Studies, as well as the

still often cited Leadership in Communist China. His edited volumes include: The City in
Communist China, Party Leadership and Revolutionary Power in China, Peasant Rebellion
and Communist Revolution in Asia, and Next Steps in the Creation of an Accidental Nuclear
War Prevention Center. His history of the Chinese nuclear weapons program, China Builds
the Bomb, written with Xue Litai, is published both in English (by Stanford University Press),
and, in Chinese, by the Atomic Energy Press in Beijing. He has also co-authored Uncertain
Partners. Stalin, Mao, and the Korean War and China's Strategic Seapower: The Politics of
Force Modernization in the Nuclear Age.
In addition to his work at Stanford, John Lewis has served on the Committee on
International Security and Arms Control of the National Academy of Sciences, the Joint
Committee on Contemporary China of the Social Science Research Council, and the
National Committee on U.S.-China Relations. He has been a consultant to the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the Department of
Defense, and is currently a consultant to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the
Office of Technology Assessment, U.S. Congress. He has made numerous visits to the
People's Republic of China (PRC), Japan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and
the Soviet Union/Russian Federation.
