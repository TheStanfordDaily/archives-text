## 
### AMY L. KOVAC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Some may call them slackers.
But die several seniors who are not enrolled in
courses while living on campus may beg to differ.
1 hey would most likely c ite their honors theses as
proof that they have plenty to do.
According to Lynn Kaiser, a research analyst at
the Registrar's Office, 80 Stanford students have
registered for "Permit to Attend for Services Only"
status this quarter.
Students with PSO status do not pay tuition and
may not enroll in courses; they pay only a $940 fee
in order to have access to libraries and other facili
ties on campus.
This status is granted only once for students who
are registered to work on an honors thesis or who
are finishing a course in which they had received an
incomplete.
Students who have PSO status are not eligible for
financial aid, but may remain in campus housing.
I he number of PSO students is down from last
spring's total of 93. In spring 1998, 79 students had
PSO status.
Students who are interested in registering as
PSO must fill out a petition with the registrar ex

plaining that they are a registered honors student
or need to finish an incomplete. This petition must
be signed by the student's major advisor.
"It's pretty much a cut-and-dried process. 1 lie
petition describes the stipulations and requires the
major advisor's signature," said Margaret
DeLaCruz, the manager of registration and records
at the Registrar's Of lice. "The degree coordinator
reviews that the University requirements are ful
filled."
While most students have PSO status during the
spring quarter of their senior year, some students
choose to petition for it for winter quarter. This
winter, nine students had PSO status.
Sometimes the last courses a student needs are
only offered during spring, so they petition for win
ter quarter, DeLaCruz said. These petitions are
looked at on a case-by-case basis.
"I think it is a good option for students who have
finished their requirements and need that extra
time," she said.
Megan Tompkins, a senior in History, Literature
and the Arts, is writing an honors thesis and has
I'SO status.
"By doing PSO, 1 could save a whole quarters tu-
ition, which was a \cr\ attractive
option to me," lompkins said.
"Mv advisor approved of m\ plan
and informed me ol the option.
W hen planning lor hei• cours
es during her junior vear, I omp
kins realized that she would fin
ish her re(|uirements early and
that she would be able to petition

for a l\S().
"I think it's a fabulous svstein.
It allows students to he ahle to
complete honors within their
major, hut still have the use ol
I niversitv facilities without hav
ing to pav lull tuition for their last
<iuai tcr wit hot it classes," she said.
Scnioi Barr\ Cooper also has
I'SO status, lie is majoring in
l'ubli< l'olit'N and is using this
<|uarter to finish his thesis.
"During honors college in the
summer, I found out that you

could do I'SO and I planned out
inv schedule so I would he ahle to
do it," Cooper said. "I was done
with my requirements for my
major and inv secondary major
and money was definitely a fac
tor."
"I don't have to worry about
getting problem sets done while I
am writing my thesis," he said.
"For my thesis, 1 need to meet
with ins professors and it is great
to he able to have an open sched
ule," Cooper said.
