## Nap spots abound at the U.N. 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AF) —
I jie United Nations is known for
it's marathon talklests that can
put even the most seasoned
diplomats to sleep. Now there's
hope for an antidote.
, Former French Ambassador
Alain Dejammet lias done a ser
vice to all his colleagues by writ
ing a 14-page, tongue-in-cheek
guide to the best places at U.N.
headquarters to escape the bore
dom and catch a catnap.
"Sleeping at the United
Nations," a pocket-sized guide in
French with a little kitty on the
fo.ver, was one of Dejammet's
parting gifts before departing
IVom his post in March for a new
assignment.
, In the book, the dry-wilted
ambassador ranks 12 lounges,
consultation rooms and sitting
areas around the U.N. complex
on a scale of 1-20 for their com
fort, light, calmness and fre
quency of use.
Dejammet then gives an over
ajl ranking, ranging from "ill
advised," (known by its symbol
of !!!) to "exceptional" (which
gets a ranking).
"Impression of being in an
abandoned monastery, in spite
of, the snores," Dejammet wrote
of the periodical room at the
U.N. library, which got three
stars: very agreeable.
, lhe conference room of the
European Union liaison office
got high marks for comfort:
"Abundance of coffee and deli
cious little cakes."
•. But' it lost- points for calmness.
"Even without meetings, a
nap can be interrupted at any
moment by the sudden arrival of
an Eurocrat demanding details
of the French position concern
ing the promotion of rights of
young girls in crises affecting
landlocked countries," he
explained.
.The U.N. Meditation Room,
which sits across the street from
U.N. headquarters, got the worst
score.
«.. Its bine Chagall windows
evoke a "draculesque crypt,"
while the squeaking sneakers of
tourists allow for little medita
tion, he wrote.
