# Ben and Jerry's sold to Unilever

### 
MONTPELIER, Vt. (AF) —
Ben & Jerry's, the hippie-capital
ist ice cream maker, is selling out
to the corporate suits.
Unilever, the multinational
conglomerate that makes such
products as VVisk detergent, Q
tips and Fopsicles, is paying $326
million for the company started
by two ex-hippies in an old gas
station in 1978.
Unilever, already the world's
largest ice cream maker, is also
making sure all the bases are cov
ered by buying the weight-loss
business Slim-Fast Foods for $2.3
billion.
Ihe Ben & Jerry's deal
announced yesterday would
bring the socially conscious
maker of funky icecream flavors
like Chunky Monkey and Cherry
Garcia under the same corporate
umbrella as Good Humor and
Breyers ice cream.
It was an outcome neither
Ben Cohen nor Jerry Greenfield
favored. But the two founders
were under pressure fi om share
holders to sell to Unilever, which
offered $43.60 per share, or
nearly 25 percent over Ben &
Jerry's closing price Tuesday of
$34.93 3/4.
"While we and others certain
ly would have pursued our mis
sion as an independent enter
prise, we hope that, as part of
Unilever, Ben & Jerry's will con

tinue to expand its role in soci
ety," Cohen and Greenfield said
in a statement.
Unilever gave assurances that
Ben & Jerry's charitable giving
will continue.
And the founders' disappoint
ment may have been assuaged
somewhat by the fact that
Cohen's stock was worth about
$39 million and Greenfield's
about $9.6 million, based on
holdings reported last month to
the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
Ben & Jerry's has played up
its image as a small Vermont
company whose goal is more
lofty than simply maximizing
profits. It has long bragged of
giving 7.5 percent of its pretax
profits to charity. It is one of Ver
mont's most beloved corporate
citizens, and its plant is a big
tourist attraction.
Ben & Jerry's CEO Ferry
Odak said it will continue manu
facturing exclusively in Vermont,
paying a premium tor milk from
the state's dairy farmers and
using milk only from cows not
treated with growth hormone. It
will also continue giving employ
ees three free pints of ice cream
per day.
Unilever plans to use Cohen
and (Ireenfield as "caring capital
ism" ambassadors, preaching the
gospel of social concerns, prod

uct quality and profits, Odak
said. The two men withdrew
from the day-to-day running of
Ben & Jerry's several years ago.
Ben & Jerry's will operate as
an independent subsidiary, with
one Unilever member on its
b< >ard.
Richard Goldstein, president
of Unilever Foods North Ameri
ca, said the plan is to keep up
Ben & Jerry's brand of social
activism.
"Much of the success of the
Ben & Jerry's brand is based on
its connections to basic human
values, and it is our hope and
expectation that Ben & Jerry's
continues to engage in these crit
ical, global economic and social
missions," he said.
Not everyone was buying it.
Leah Poisson, 29, of Bidde
ford, Maine, went on the Ben it-
Jerry's factory tour in Waterbun
yesterday. "After going on the
tour, I was feeling all loyal, think
ing, 'Oh man, wow, these guys
are great, " she said. "But now I
know ibis, I might as well just
buy someone else."
In January, Michael Garrett,
the owner of four Ben & Jerry's
franchises in Connecticut and
New York, had urged fran
chisees to join forces to stop the
sale to corporate interests. Yes
terday, however, Garrett wel
comed the sale.
