# Clinton supports restrictions on gun show sales

### 
DENVER (AP) â€” President Clinton threw his support
behind a ballot initiative for new restrictions on firearms
sales at gun shows yesterday. But the state's Republican
governor boycotted Clinton's appearance even though he
agrees with the president on the issue.
Some Columbine parents also were resentful of the visit,
which came one week before the anniversary of the high
school massacre. I hey feared that the tragedy was being
politicized.
Clinton came here to express support for a state ballot
measure seeking to close a loophole that allows guns to be
purchased at gun shows without a background check. The
lack of a background check allowed a friend to buy
weapons for the two teen-age Columbine killers, who were
among the 15 dead.
Legislation on the matter failed in the Colorado Legis
lature this year. Sane Alternatives to the Firearms Epidem
ic, a group organized after Columbine, has launched a
petition campaign to put the issue on the ballot this
November.
"There is just as much support for this idea among
Republicans as there is among Democrats," said John
Head, a Republican who is co-president of SAFE. "When
the name-calling stops ... 1 have no doubt the voters of

Colorado will approve this measure."
" I I it* country is looking very closely at Colorado," (Clin
ton told a rally staged In SAFK. "We know it's a state with
a broken heart over (lolutnbine. We know it's a state where
people can put aside their partisan differences, and maybe
even their lifetime culture, to look at the facts. ()thet states
will follow your lead. I hope and pray Congress will lbllow
your lead as well."
But Clinton's visit prompted some disma\ in the
(Columbine conununitv.
" There's been enough trauma in im town alreadv. I
think he ought to go home," said Steve Cordova, a gun
lights activist whose daughter escaped unhurt from the
school.
Later, Clinton participated in a town hall meeting tele
vised nationally on MSNBC. Almost immediatelv. state leg
islator Doug Dean told him closing the loophole would not
have stopped the Columbine tragedy because the purchas
er would have passed a background check.
"So it really wouldn't have had any impact." Dean said.
"Our legislative responsibility is to pass legislation that
actually will go to the root of the problem."
Replied Clinton: "You can't refuse to vote lot a law
because it's not perfect and it won't solve even problem."

(llinlon lias regularly (ited the Columbine killings as he
makes his argument for "commonsense gun laws" in
response to a wave of deadly hootings.
Alt hough Republic an Gov. Bill Owerjs, supports the
lot initiative, he stayed away from yesterday's events, say
ing be was leery of the political overtones.
"1 do hope that he doesn't politicize a Colorado issue
and get involved in something that ought to be up to Col
oradans to vote and agree on," Owens said of Clinton on
Tuesday.
In Washington, Republican National Committee Chair
man Jim Nic holson accused Clinton of politicking. "Bill
Clinton and Al Gore have spent the last seven years cam
paigning on the backs of national tragedies," Nicholson
said.
Clinton took to the road yesterday in hopes of turning
up pressure on ('.ongress to take up gun safety legislation.
A I louse-Senate conference committee has been assigned
to reconcile differences between a Senate-passed bill that
would set a 72-hour background check on gun-show sales
and.i I louse bill that shrank the wait to 24 hours.
I he committee has met only once, in August, which the
White Mouse attributes to political maneuvering by the
National Rifle Association.
