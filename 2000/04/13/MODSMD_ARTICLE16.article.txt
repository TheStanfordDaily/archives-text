# Ethiopian drought causes large famine

DENAN, Ethiopia (Al>) —
Sharis Mohammed walked nine
miles with her seven children in
search of help after her family's
livestock died. But when she
reached (his tiny town in south
eastern Ethiopia, she found no
international food aid.
Within a day, her 1-year-old
son had died.
An estimated six children die
each day in this small corner of
the Horn of Africa, where mil
lions of people are suffering
from a three-year drought and
the resulting food shortage.
"We came here because we
were told there was help,"
Sharis, 31, said outside a hut
made of rags and sticks — her
new home in a makeshift camp.
"Now we have nothing, and all
my children are sick."
Sharis is one of 7.7 million
Ethiopians threatened with
starvation. Aid agencies say a
potential human catastrophe
looms.
Ethiopia, mired in a 23-

month border conflict with
Eritrea, has appealed for
920,500 tons of food aid
because it can't muster suffi
cient resources on its own.
Its own food reserves, which
should be at 400,000 tons, are
down to 50,000 tons, regional
government officials say. Only
half the relief food Ethiopia
asked for has been pledged by
donors.
In Denan, 375 miles south
east of the capital Addis Ababa
in Ethiopia's Somali region, as
many as five families arrive
daily at the camp, which is
already home to 6,000 people.
Most are nomads who rely
on cattle, sheep, goats and
camels for food and income.
When their livestock dies, they
have no alternative but to trek
to a town in search of aid.
The U.N. World Food Pro
gram estimates that more than
90 percent of the cattle and 65
percent of the sheep in the
region have died.
