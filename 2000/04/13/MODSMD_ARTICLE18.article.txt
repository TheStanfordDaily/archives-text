## The 						Stanford Daily ASSU needs to publicize group fund policies 
### 
Student groups that do not receive
special tees in the general election,
or who run into grave financial trou
ble, are seemingly faced with few
alternatives other than intense fund-rais
ing efforts, an increase in member-dues or
severe limitations on their programming.
There is however, an alternative, albeit
one which many groups do not know
exists.
The ASSU maintains a fund of surplus
money from previous years that groups
can access in order to remedy such finan
cial difficulties.
Yet, due to a lack of information about
lhis alternative, many groups often are left

to make more drastic decisions.
The ASSU must take more concrete
steps to provide all student groups — and
all students, for that matter — information
about the fund and how its monies can be
used to support student groups.
Here's now the fund works — say the
Underwater Basketweaving Society nas a
$1,000 surplus from its 1999 operating
budget. That money goes into a fund,
accessible only to that organization which it
could use in 2000 if its special fee request
did not pass in the student body election.
As a result, many groups have excessive
amounts of money in tlise 112 unds — money
that is not being put to use.

Many groups, however, are unaware of
the full potential or even existence of such
money.
With many student groups operating
on extremely thin budgets and many pro
viding vital community and student ser
vices which do not bring in any income,
the existence of bail-out funds is of crucial
importance.
it is the ASSU's responsibility to ensure
that all groups have access to their funds
and are knowledgable about the fund
mechanism.
Not only will groups be persuaded to
not frivolously spend potential special fee
surprlus (these circumstances are of

course rare) but also groups will have a
viable alternative to the aforementioned
limitations which exist in times of financial
crisis.
This issue applies more broadly to the
notion of voter education lor the upcom
ing elections.
On a campus that often seems apathet
ic to the issues and politics of the ASSU,
the organization must work to publicize its
guidelines regarding student groups and
special fee elections to the whole campus.
Currently, the rules of special fee elec
tions are published online, but they must
be made more available to students as well
as groups.
