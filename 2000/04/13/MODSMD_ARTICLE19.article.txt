# MODERN LIFE IS RUBBISH
## The 						unholy trinity 
### 
Here s ;i menage a trois we
never wanted to see: George
W. Bush (fortunate son and
presidential hopeful) teamed
with Ralph Reed (Christian Coalition
leader turned political consultant) and
Hill Cates (world's richest dork).
1 he New York I imes recently report
ed that Microsoft has enlisted the aid of
Centurv Strategies, the consulting firm
founded In Reed aftei he <|iiit his post as
spokesman lot America's right-wing
fi inge. Reed's staled purpose is to defend
Microsoft against "lobbying attacks'' in

Washington; i.e., the
present antitrust case,
which has just
slammed the software
behemoth with the
possibility ol a fore ible
breakup.
I his is a little
spook), given that the
only thing Microsoft

and the Christian
(Coalition appeal to share is ,in unbridled
lust loi power. But things gel truly coni
plieated when one realizes that Reed is
eurrenth a senior political eonsultant to
Bush's presidential campaign.
Reed claims to have never talked to
Bush specifically about Microsoft; Centu
i n Strategies released a statement saying
that "there's been no personal lobbying."
I lowever. Century does admit to a grass
roots campaign in which an unnamed
"small number of individuals" were
encouraged to write letters to Bush in
protest of the antitrust ruling.
According to Century, this campaign
was small in scale and since Reed's posi
tion as a Bush advisor could lead to a
"possible inisperception," it has been
discontinued. There was no report on
how many letters were actually written,
though Century assures us that there
were few.
We can hope it ends there. But in an
election year where campaign finance
has emerged as a hot-button issue, the
public and press are understandably
wary of such links between candidate
and corporation — particularly when
the corporation has proved so ruthless
in previous dealings.
If there's one thing Microsoft doesn't
lack, it's resources, and those resources
are doubtless being used to their utmost
in the antitrust case. I'lie company is
fully aware that the next occupant of the
Oval Office will have a say in its eventu
al fate; precedent was set in 1982, when
the Justice Department threw out a 13-
year-old antitrust case against IBM only
a year into the Reagan administration.
Our present campaign finance sys

tem, as pretty much everyone acknowl
edges, is riddled with enough loopholes
that anyone who really wants to make a
sizeable contribution will find a way. It's
a twist on "Who Wants to Marry a Mil
lionaire?" — the new question being
which millionaires, ideologically at least,
want to marry each other.
The ties of Bush's party to big busi
ness are common knowledge. Bill Cates,
however, is an especially appropriate
match for the Texas governor — at least
if you buy the theory that opposites
attract.
Gates represents the new elite; Bush
is a holdover from the old. Personal
qualities aside, the Microsoft chairman
embodies the ultimate software success
story, the kind that the new breed of
local dotcoms can only dream about.
He's the Harvard dropout turned
iibergcek, a textbook example of the
tech economy overturning older stan
dards. These days all of the mansions
.uid private jets are going to skinny guys
with glasses.
Meanwhile, Bush's greatest accom
plishment remains having been born a
Bush. His 1970s foray into business —
the oil company Bush Exploration —
went bankrupt in 1983. It was bought
out by Spectrum 7, a company run by
several staunch Reagan-Bush support
ers, and George W. was allowed to stay
on with a hefty salary.
When Spectrum went belly-up in
198(i, it was in turn bought by Harken
Ktiergy, another corporation with polit
ical connections. Bush came out with a
fortune in stock and a lucrative consult
ing contract, despite the fact that he had
yet to demonstrate any real business
competence.
His current campaign is an awe
inspiring testament to the .enduring
power of privilege in this country. A
man with a track record of embarrass
ing failures, but also with the right rela
tives and friends, can somehow still be a
serious contender for the presidency.
So fat Bush has had little to say about
the Microsoft case, except that he "pre
fer[s] innovation to litigation." It's
unclear what he means by this, unless
it's the grammatical innovation respon
sible for his now-famous gaffe "there is
madmen and there are terror." But it's
a safe bet that no matter who enters the
Oval Office come January, Gates's hired
politicos will be knocking at the door,
ready to innovate a still greater market
share.
