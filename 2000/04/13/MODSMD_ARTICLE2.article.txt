### BARNALI DASVERMA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Admit Weekend 2000 kicks off
today as Stanford courts 1,100
prospective freshmen and the 900
parents who are accompanying
them.
As the weekend commences,
controversy has subsided over a
behavioral contract signed by
prospective freshmen.
The form, titled "Guidelines
for Admit Weekend Participants,"
was developed by the ()ffice of Acl

missions after a 17-year old
prospective freshman went to
Stanford Hospital with alcohol
poisoning last year. The new con
tract emphasizes that alcohol and
drug use is forbidden, though it
was revised after current resi
dence staff members expressed
concern that the original docu
ment would have forced them
into a police role.
Dean of Undergraduate Ad
missions Robert Kinnallv stated,


AAAUREEN FAN/The Stanford Daily
"ll's really alxuit safety .... In gen
eral. we have to be really smart
about risk."
Vice Provost for Student Aflairs
James Montoya issued a statement
about the form.
" I'he form prospective students
were asked to sign fin uses on safety
and personal responsibility. I hope
the prospective freshmen will leave
campus on Sunday with a full ap
preciation 0f... our belief that
Stanford students are able to man
age their own aflairs, including de
cisions and responsibilities around
academic and personal issues."
Kinnally highlighted collabora
tive efforts between Residential Kd
ucalion staff and Admit Weekend
coordinators, stating, "We've
worked very closely ... [Resident
assistants] are the experts here."
Nonetheless. Kinnally firmly
said, "It is not a party weekend. II
you party too much, you may not be
able to [enroll]."
Dean of Students Marc Waissaid,
"I think this year's Admit Weekend
will be one of the Ix-st ever."
I'he stall in the Admissions Of
fice and Residential Fducation, said
Wais, "have done a great job in clar
ifying expectations of 'behavior lor

admitted students and defining the
role ... to follow for staff and cur
rent students involved."
"We're thrilled about the week
end," Kinnally said, describing it as
a time for prospective fresh men to
get a "glimpse of life at Stan lord."
Kinnally said the programs
locus has shifted this year. More
emphasis has been placed on help
ing high school seniors make up
their minds, while the "pi e-orienta
tion slant" has lessened.
junior Ichiro Osumi, an Admit
Weekend coordinator, said, "We're
all very excited ... to have all our
work Ik' fulfilled."
Planned activities include the
traditional A (lappclla concert and
Faculty Night, both scheduled for
Friday evening.
Osumi s;iid of the latter, "We
tried to find a nice balance ... a di
verse panel." Fach professor will
speak for five to 10 minutes, and
answer questions.
A new event will be the "Death
l our," a nighttime walk on Thurs
day led by Anthropological Spi
cules Prof. |olm Rick that will high
light campus spots that are witness
to historical events or burial sites of
Stanford personalities.
Kinnally, who is stepping down
from his post later this year, reflect
ed on this year's Admit Weekend
being his last.
"It is bittersweet. I won't be able

to greet them in September," he
said.
With respect to the weekend's
events, kinnally highlighted Satin
day evening's Cantor Arts Center
open house, saying, "It's an array of
artists — dance, music, theater —
showcasing the arts."
Kinnally also mentioned anoth
er new event — a Saturday night
dance in the Quad.
Residential programming is also
planned. Freshman Julie Forres,
an Arroyo house host, said that her
dorm is co-hosting an HOs-themed
dance with neighboring (ledro.
Forres said safety issues have
been emphasized at house host
preparation meetings.
"We are neither to buy nor sup
ply alcohol or take [the students]
anywhere where alcohol will be
served."
On the alcohol-policy crack
down, Forres said, "It makes good
sense. It protects me and the Uni
versity legally .... [I lowever, the
students] might want a reality
check, and we can't give them that."
Kinnally offered a final word of
advice to bis last admitted class:
"Use the weekend to ask the tough
est questions you can think of.
Where will you feel most valued as
a community member and an intel
lect? Naturally, I think Stanford is
that place. I lowever, it's your deci
sion. Keep youi eyes wide open."
