Admit Weekend 2000 kicks off
today as Stanford courts 1,100
prospective freshmen and the 900
parents who are accompanying
them.
As the weekend commences,
controversy has subsided over a
behavioral contract signed by
prospective freshmen.
The form, titled "Guidelines
for Admit Weekend Participants,"
was developed by the ()ffice of Acl

missions after a 17-year old
prospective freshman went to
Stanford Hospital with alcohol
poisoning last year. The new con
tract emphasizes that alcohol and
drug use is forbidden, though it
was revised after current resi
dence staff members expressed
concern that the original docu
ment would have forced them
into a police role.
