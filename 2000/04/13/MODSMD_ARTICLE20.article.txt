Defending President Casper
In his letter of April 12 ("What makes
President Casper a success?") Jacob Eisen
stein asks "What makes President Casper
a success?" Since he so misses the mark in
providing an answer, permit me to
address the issue.
In his eight years as University Presi
dent, Gerhard Casper: (1) restored the
relationship between Stanford and the
Federal government, by far the largest
provider of research funds on campus;
(2) rebuilt the campus after the devastat
ing 1989 earthquake; (3) instituted the
most far reaching review of undergradu
ate education at Stanford in more than a
generation, and then implemented and
funded a series of reforms that have

transformed the undergraduate experi
ence; (4) created the most innovative
program in the country for funding
graduate education in the sciences and
engineering; (5) spoke out forcefully on
the issue of affirmative action when it
was highly unfashionable to do so; and
(6) greatly increased the participation of
alumni in supporting the University,
and in general, raised a record amount
of gifts. These and a thousand other
smaller things.
Is there ever a president with whom
everyone will agree about everything? By
definition, no. But Casper a "caricature"
of himself? Utter nonsense â€” and a pin
nacle of ingratitude.
