# Stanford students need to hit the road
## 
### 
One Friday last quarter two
Chicago undergrads were hang
ing out in their favorite Wind\
City pub. lor the purposes of
this story, we'll just call them by their real
names: Walker and Kevin. It was cold and
snowing, and these two friends, who had
known each other since tliev were live,
were having a final pint before heading
home. They finished up their beers, put on
their gloves and walked out into the slush.
When they got in Walker's car, they waited
a few moments lot the heal to come on,
and while they were waiting, thev started to
ask each other where the\ should go.
1 lome? Another bar? Silence settled as the\
considered what to do next. Suddenly one
of them spoke out on an impulse, "Let's go
see Douglas." Well. Douglas just happens
to be me ... at Stanford ... in ('.alilor
nia ... 2,000 miles away.
Without debating, they got on the high
way and headed toward the Pacific . They

didn't stop b\ their apartments to pick up
any clothing or other "necessities" — they
simply went.

On Moncla\ night I
c ame back from dinner
to find m\ roommate
talking about me on the
phone. I le turns to me
and s;i\s, " I here are
some people who want
you to show up on the
steps of ('.reen I .ibrarv
right now." Naturallv 1

ask a few questions: "Who is it"-" "What's it
about?" "Am I going to get a bucket of
green paint dropped on me?" You know,
the normal precautionan questions one
asks in such circumstances. Alter repeating
the questions into the phone, im room
mate returns with an abrupt "They won t
s;i\." No, naturalK, I said that I'd be right
over.
At (ireen I w as tackled and hugged, and

there was much shouting and revelry, etc.
What can 1 say — it was fantastic. Of
course, recognizing that my friends had
essentialh (hopped everything (classes,
work, etc.) to tome see me, I too dropped
everything and spent the night showing
them San Francisco: the beach (where we
talked poetry and spirituality and life and
everything over a case of beer), (lity 1 eights,
Vesnvio (the bar where keronac and the
Heats hung), a scenic overlook near Wee
nieville, and on and on through dawn.
So what's my point, you may ask, or
demand, or maybe you've already stopped
reading? Well, 1 suppose if you've ever
tead "On the Road," you already know
what all this is about. But even if you have
read it — well, mavbe things have changed
a bit in nearly 50 years. The reasons that
Kerouac went driving around the country
without a clear destination were his own,
and you can read the book to find out why
another generation needed to get in the car

and just Man di iving. But there might be a
few reasons why this little story should
press us differently.
We at Stanford, we the generation of
FedEx, the Internet, (heap airline tickets,
Starbucks (however much we hate it, it's
part of who we are) and liisi food — we the
over-scheduled, over-booked, over
looked students of Silicon Valley — we
need the open road more than Jack. We
need to embrace our impulses to reach out
to each other, to leap up and head for the
beach, to sing at high volume while doss
ing the Quad, to start a conversation with
a passerby. For us, the generalion-unnain
able, there is no "entering" the rat race,
there is no corporate "ladder," there is no
"Sunday rest '' (Auden). We were born into
an econoim and a pop-culture that wor
ship speed, that are inexti ic ablv corporate,
that leach us that life is a series of appoint
ments, commitments, career choices and
stock options.

I 'm not suggesting that everyone should
up and drive c ross country or even that the
pic ture of our generation that I've offered
is anything but a generalization and my
personal perspective at this time. But 1 am
suggesting — no, I'm lagging you, for
your sanity, for your insanity — follow your
impulses (preferably not your negative
ones), and see for yourself if you agree with
me when I say "We are not just parts of the
machine — if anything we are more
empowered, both individually and togeth
er, than any previous generation in the his
tory of the world — all we need is the
courage to drop everything sometimes
.... and prove to ourselves that we are in
control of our lives." This is not arrogance
— this I define as embracing entirely every
thing that makes us human.
