# Nobel Prize-winning physicist notes common nature of religion, science
## 
### EE HOU YONG 
I C-Berkeley Prof. Charles
I ownes, winner of the 1 1 >(VI Nobel
Prize in Phvsk s, described the par
allels between st ience and religi<>n
in the 20th annual Bunyan Lec
ture at lei man Auditorium yes
terday.
I ownes, who won the Nobel
Prize for his work in the field of
quantum electronics, focused on
the often tenuous relationship be
tween science and religion.
"In m\ opinion, science is man's
attempt to understand the struc
ture of the universe and its work
ing laws, while religion hopes to
understand the meaning and pur
pose of human existence," he said.
I ownes continued, "While sci
ence is alwa\s perceived as c lear
( ut since it is based on experimen
tal facts, religion, with doctrines
and laitli as foundation, is more
open to intepretation."
However, Townes said he be
lieves that science and religion
< (Mild be more closely related than
most people think. " 1 here might
be- quantitative differences be
tween science and religion, but
i here are not inanv qualitative dif
ferences."
I ownes claimed that science ac -
tually depends a lot on fait 11, just
like- religion.
"When physicists conduct ex
periments in the laboratory, they
always have faith that there exist
some universal laws that will gov
ern I he outcome of the experiment.
I bis I,lith is the foundation ol all
theoretical advancement," he said.
I'ownes said that even though
science has bad wonderful success
in the- last lew c enturies, at present,
be thinks that there are still too

many tilings for which we have no
answer.
In particular, lie brought up
the questions of why quantum me
chanics and general relativity are
incompatible when both theories
have tremendous success;
whether we have free will when we
are driven by the laws of nature;
and the nature of consciousness
and how to define it.
On the other hand, Townes
pointed out that there are many
questions that religion seems to be
unable to answer, such as why in
nocent people need to sutler, or
why Cod will let these people sui
ter.
"Indeed, in both science and re
ligion, there exist many inconsis
tencies, but this does not mean we
have to despair. We must continue
to probe into both areas, refining
them constantly and have the fait 11
that the decisions that we make
with our limited understanding
are the best possible," I ownes said.
Michel Orueneberg, a doctoral
student in mathematics, said he
enjoyed Townes' speech, calling
the subject matter "important."
"Science and religion are some
times viewed to be mutually exclu
sive, which I think is wrong. Nor
mally you wouldn't expect a
renowned professor discussing a
sensitive topic like this in a secular
university," he said.
The Bunyan lecture series is or
ganized by the the astronomy pro
gram. It is made possible by James
Bunyan, a former Stanford em
ployee, who donated his life sav
ings to help establish a lecture se
ries that aims to bring distin
guished scientists and scholars to
give talks on astronomy to the gen
eral public.
