## Wiginton's game comes full circle 
### EMILY DRESSEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
She doesn't look like your typical Softball
catcher, those robust, brawny tomboys usually
squatting behind homebase. She's tall, skinny
and blonde, but lor four straight years has com
manded varsity play behind the plate at the Stan
lord Softball Complex like a professional.
In a sentence, the veteran Softball phenome
non from Fresno, Calif., defies convention.
Meet #37, senior kellie Wiginton.
Wiginton grew up in a household with two
parents who loved to play and watch sports, and
the enthusiasm for athletics became contagious.
She credits a neighbor for introducing her to
the game of Softball after she got pegged in the
lip when she was six while tossing a baseball
around with her dad in the front yard.
Unfortunately, the word "softball" is ex
tremely deceptive. There is nothing soft about it.
Wiginton has learned that better than anyone
at the most brutal position in the game, victim to
an infinite number of knicks and bruises behind
the plate.
Nevertheless, as a kid. the young superstar
couldn't get enough of the sport and consistent
ly stayed after practice to get dirty.
"I loved getting dirty. One other girl and I
would stay after practice with our dads and have
them throw lis balls as fin to the sides as possible
so we could dive for them," Wiginton said. "My
dad was coaching me at the time, and every day
I'd beg him to let me catch instead of playing
third. I begged for quite a while."
Finally, Dad caved and Wiginton got her shot.
She never got to play third again.
The aspiring catcher was one of the founding
members of the town's traveling softball club, the
Fresno Force, when she was nine.
She dedicated eight years of her childhood to

traveling with her softball teams, leaving every
weekend during the summers to play in count
less national qualifiers and tournaments.
The five-hour road trip down to Southern
California, a region infamous for the extraordi
nary caliber of its girls' softball teams, became
commonplace for a pack of fourteen girls and
their families.
When Kellie was sixteen, club play reached its
culmination and all the grit, hard work and sac
rifice seemed instantly worthwhile. That year,
the Fresno Force 16 & Under team claimed the
American Softball Association national champi
onship after winning seven games in a double
elimination tournament.
"It was probably one of the best softball mem
ories I have," Wiginton said. "I remember that
whole last inning I didn't even want to take a
breath. I just kept telling myself, even with two
outs and two strikes on the last batter, 'They
could still come back. They could still come
back.' I couldn't believe it when we finally won."
A year or so later, at a UCLA-sponsored soft
ball exposure camp, Stanford recruiters took
note of the high school catcher and liked what
they saw.
Although Wiginton had her sights on Fresno
State, having grown up watching and idolizing
the team, a twist of fate — namely the avid en
thusiasm of the (Cardinal coaches — brought her
to the Farm.
As a freshman, Wiginton came into a pro
gram that was floundering. Stanford softball had
just made the transition from club to varsity com
petition, and Wiginton began her college career
its starting catcher under the direction of new
head coach John Rittman.
From that point on, Wiginton has been the
foundation of a program that has since taken
flight, growing and improving every year to its
current position as the ninth-ranked team in the

nation.
Recruiting has improved, and the school has
established a tradition of excellence in collegiate
Softball. Stanford, once a scrappy, second-rate
club team, has evolved into a force to be reck
oned with in the prestigious Pacific 10 Confer
ence.
"Our sophomore and freshman classes are
just phenomenal. They are all such great athletes
that the program is only going to continue get
ting better," Wiginton said. "1 think prospective
players are becoming more aware of us, and its
motivating them to work harder in school so
they can get in here."
In 1997, Wiginton was named Stanford's
Rtxikie of the Year and went on to lead the team
in her sophomore year with 193 at-bats as a First-
Team All-Fat -10 choice.
Fhe 1999 season marked the third-straight
year that Wiginton started every single game be
hind the plate. Not only did she call the pitches
for the first three perfect games in Stanford his
tory with former pitcher Marcy Crouch, but she
contributed at the plate as well, batting a stellar,
.353. She was named second-team Ail-American
in 1999 and last week shattered the Stanford ca
reer hits record.
After catching for pitchers who were always
older and with more varsity experience, this year
posed a refreshing challenge for the four-year
starter. Stanford added four new freshman
pitchers, each with their own individual style and
set of pitches.
" Fhe freshmen are doing so well this season,"
credited Wiginton. "They are all so composed
and poised, considering how intimidating it
must be for them to go np against some of the
most talented hitters in the country."
"It's been a lot different, though, being the

last season for the Cardinal, she prepares for life after the game.
older one this time around and try
ing to get them to know and believe
how good and capable they really
are."
Rittman anxiously praises his
go-to catcher to let her know just
how talented she is as well.
, "Kellie has caught almost even
inning for us over the course of her
college career. That is almost un
heard of at this level of college soli
ball. And she has the battle-wounds
to prove it."
"Not only is she a phenomenal
catcher and one of the most consis
tent ballplayers in the game, but she
is a great person and leader oil the
field as well. She was here from the
beginning, through the growing
pains of this program and has
meant so much to its overall stabili
ty and success. I just couldn't ask for
a better person or player to coach."
Yet slie is as humble and inno
cently passionate about the game as
that fearless six-year old girl who
once threw the baseball around
with her dad on the front lawn.

She credits all her success to her
family, who sacrificed so much to
trek down to Southern California
every weekend to give her the op
portunity to play against the best.
"I always thought I was going to
play at Fresno State; hut, I've never
questioned it here," Wiginton said.
"I have had the best time. My
friends, teammates, coaches, even
the campus. Sometimes I'm walk
ing through the Quad, and I am
completely overcome with the real
ity that I'm here, at Stanford. It
leaves me speechless thinking how
luck) I am to be here. I have ab
solutely no regrets."
Wiginton is not quite sure what
lies ahead after this season, but it
probably won't involve competitive
softball. Although Wiginton was of
fered a spot to play in the women's
professional league, the star is
ready to look toward other things
that would help constitute a more
normal life.
However, after more than a
decade of breathing and living the
heartbreak, triumph, glory and
guts that make up the game of soft
ball, it's going to be a grievous and
mournful goodbye.
There have been too many

road-trips, night games, one-run
contests and days of catching in
sweltering heat, to count, probably.
Yet, Wiginton cannot remember
a time when she didn't want to go
out on the field and play.
Agood catcher cannot lx- molded
overnight. It takes years of stealthily
learning how to frame a pitch, deli
cately gaging if the curve is on that
day and, of course, figuring out
how to walk around in that bulky,
suctioning, spacesuit-like gear.
It's an art form to perfect. And
Wiginton has mastered the chal
lenge.
She has come full circle. From
the little girl who sat, cheering on
(lie bleachers at the women's colle
giate games to realizing her dream
and accomplishing more in four
years than any coach could ask for.
And as she savors the last breaths
of her college career, she might
even be lucky enough to return the
favor.
To turn around after one of the
games, wipe the dust from her eyes
after raising the mask and wave at a
little girl in red, poised on the Stan
lord bleachers, dreaming whole
heartedly to one day, be in #37's
shoes.
