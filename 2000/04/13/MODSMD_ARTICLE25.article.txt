# Baseball goes deep into bullpen to clinch win
## Gloger, Drew and Bruksh combine to provide solid pitching against Spartans 
### TIM KANE STAFF WRITER 
At about 9 o' clock yesterday
morning, the new Intercollegiate
Tennis Association team rankings
were revealed, declaring the Car
dinal men's tennis team No. 1 in
the nation.
If you talked to the Utah Utes
about 4 o' clock yesterday after
noon, they would have told you
that is exactly the ranking Stan
lord deserves.
By that time, the Cardinal (18-
0, 5-0 Pacific 10 Conference) had
quickly overpowered the 75th
ranked Utes (8-12), sweeping all
six singles matches in straight sets
and taking two out of three dou
bles matches.
Coach Dick Gould was very
pleased with his team's perfor
mance, especially considering
they were facing a relatively weak
opponent on the heels of a highly
competitive weekend in which

Following its annihilation of
Washington State over the week
end, the No. 5 Stanford baseball
team brought its hot bats and
solid pitching down to San Jose
State Tuesday night, and got re
venge for an early season loss to
the Spartans with a 5-2 win.
Junior Brad Drew (1-0)
earned the win for the Cardinal,
which brought Stanford's current
winning streak to a season-high
tying five in a row, and raised the
team's record to 26-9 on the sea
son. San Jose State fell to 25-12
with the loss.
"It was a good game, well
played by both teams. We got to
use like four or five pitchers, which
we wanted to do. I thought we
pitched well, played some good de
fense," said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "I actually thought we hit
the ball better than [the stats
showed]. We hit a lot of balls hard
at people. It was a gcxxl win for us."
Marquess typically uses these
weekday non-conference battles
to get some work for some of the
under-used pitchers in his deep
bullpen, and this game was cer
tainly no exception. No Stanford
pitcher went more than two in
nings, and five pitchers were used
in total on the night.
Freshman Ryan Gloger made
the start for the Card, the first of
his college career. (iloger had not
pitched since a disastrous outing
against Florida State back in Feb
ruary, but made the most of his
opportunity to impress Mar
quess, pitching two innings while
only giving up a homer to San
Jose State's John Fagan, who

smacked a grand slam the first
time the two teams played.
"[Gloger] pitched pretty well,"
said Marquess. "He's pitched well
in intrasquad games and some ju
nior college games we played
during the week. It was good to
get him out here, and he did well.
I'm very pleased with his effort."
In the third, Stanford an
swered back with two runs of
their own off of San |ose State
starter Chris Sherman.
Sherman hit senior first base
man Craig Thompson with a
pitch, and then proceeded to walk
senior shortstop Eric Bruntlett, ju
nior right fielder joe Borchard,
and senior third baseman John
Gall, with Gall earning a run bat
ted in when Thompson was forced
in. Sophomore second baseman
Chris O'Riordan flied out to right
field to bring in Bruntlett and put
Stanford up 2-1.
San Jose State tied the score in
the fifth on a single by Gabe
Duran off of Drew, who pitched
two innings and struck out four in
his first appearance of the year.
In the sixth, the Card went
ahead for good by scoring three
runs off of eventual loser Jared
Sandler (1-2). A single and two
walks loaded the bases for Bor
chard, who is beginning to heat
up after coining out of the gate
slow at the beginning of the year.
Borchard stroked a two-out sin
gle to left field to bring home
Bruntlett and sophomore left
fielder Andy Tophain.
"I think he is swinging the bat
better, both right-handed and lefi
handed, which is a good sign,"
Marquess said. "We're going to
need him as we get into the second
half of the season and as we get
deeper into the conference sched
ule. It'll be good to get him going."
Cvail singled after Borchard to
score Edmund Muth and pro
vide the final margin for the (Car
dinal, earning the senior third
baseman his team-leading 44th
RBI of the year.

Sophomore Jeff Bruksi.li. who
has filled the role of Stanford's
closer for most <>1 the war. went
the final two innings without giv
ing up a hit to eat n his teain-k ad
ing sixth save of the war.

Stanford will next be in at lion

Washington in .1 iliree game se

I luskies are I 1-7 overall and !Mi
