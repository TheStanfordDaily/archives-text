# Two on to Nationals
## 
### KATIE FITZPATRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In lieu of a team performance
at the NCAA Championships this
weekend, the Stanford women's
gymnastics program is sending
two individual performers to
Boise, Idaho, to compete: junior
Jennifer Exaltation in the all
around and sophomore Katy
Herbert on beam.
Both gymnasts qualified
through their performances at
NCAA Regionals two weeks ago
in Corvallis, Ore. Of gymnasts
who did not qualify to Nationals
as part of a team, Kxaltacion was
the third-highest all-around scor
er in the country. Herbert de
fended her Regional beam title
and, by winning the event, se
cured an invitation to compete.
"It was a complete surprise to
win beam," 1 ferbert said.
Kxaltacion and Herbert will
face a radically different environ
ment when they compete in the
preliminary session today. Previ
ously, they have always competed
with the rest of the Stanford team,
which missed a team berth at Na
tionals by a mere two-tenths of a
point.
"It kind of takesawav from the
excitement when I am going as an
individual instead of with the
team, because the goal for the sea
son was to go to Nationals as a
team," Kxaltacion said.
Teammates have remained
supportive v\bile Kxaltacion — af
fectionately known as Fx or Fxey
by teammates — and 1 ferbert —
often called Bert by teammates —
trained for the meet, even coining
in the gym during its two week
post-season vacation from gym
nastics to train with them.
"I think both Bert and Fx will
do marvelously at Nationals.

Bert's beam is terrific. Kxey has
experience and amazing talent. I
think they know we're behind
them," said senior Ail-American
Sarah Harding.
Kxaltacion, a 1996 Canadian
Olympian, will be increasing the
difficulty in her routines for Na
tionals. She plans to perform a
more difficult dismount on both
bars and beam. Upgrading the
difficulty of her routine will make
her performances more competi
tive with other top gymnasts.
"My goal is to be an All-Ameri
can," Kxaltacion said.
I lei bert will be competing the
same routine that won her the
Regional title. Her goal is also to
be an All-American and qualify
for beam finals, to be held on Sat
urday. Finalists comprise the top
four scores in each of the two ses
sions on the event.
"1 just want to keep calm and
compete my routine the way I've
been practicing," 1 ferbert said. "1
know I can go all out for beam
and not worry about conserving
energy."
Both gymnasts have the po
tential to be All-Americans. Kx
altacion is strong on every event
but often shines brightest on
beam, in which she currently
holds the school record. Her
scores should benefit from com
peting in the same rotation as an
extremely strong and talented
I'(;LA team. Herbert will be com
peting with a weaker team from
Penn State.
Senior All-American Larissa
Fontaine has been in the same sit
uation as Kxaltacion and I ferbert,
as she qualified as an individual
all-arounder her freshman year
and as an individual event partic
ipant her sophomore year. While
Fontaine went on to win the vault
title in 1998, there will be no

added pressure on Herbert to fol
low in her footsteps.
"The only advice I gave both of
them was to do what they know
how to do and to have fun. Going
as an individual is less pressure
than going as a team, but it's easy
to get overwhelmed by the hype
of the competition that is focused
on the teams that are competing."
Fontaine said.
As if this year's heartbreaking
loss to Oregon State for the last

berth to Nationals was not moti
vation enough, both Exaltacion
and Herbert plan to use their ex
periences at Nationals as motiva
tion for themselves and the team
next year.
"Jen and Katy will have the op
portunity to give the rest of the
country a look at Stanford and
our level of gymnastics. Stanford
will be at Nationals next year and
will be very competitive,"
Fontaine said.
