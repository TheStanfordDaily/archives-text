# Track splits for weekend
## 
### MINAYO NASIALI 
After last weekend's strong per
formance at the Hayward Relays
in Eugene, Ore., the Stanford
men's and women's track teams
are gearing up for this weekend's
busy schedule, which boasts multi
ple meets in Southern California.
The team will compete in the
Azusa Pacific University hep
tathlon/decathlon and the
Pomona-Pitzer meet, on Friday, as
well as the Mt. San Antonio Col
lege Relays from Friday through
Sunday.
I he Mt. SAC Relays draw the
top competitors in the nation.
Many of the teams that fuel the Pa
cific 10 Conference and NCAA
Championships will be participat
ing. The Cardinal expects the
challenge represented by the com
petition at Mt. SAC will help pro
pel it toward success in nationals.
.Although the team will split be
tween the three competitions this
weekend, the overall focus of the
athletes is to achieve qualifying
times for upcoming Pac-10 Con
ference and NCAA championships
in late May and early June.
"Many of our athletes will be
competing in multiple events this
weekend. It will be a great way for
them to simulate competing in tri
als and finals, which they will need
to do at the Pac-10's and NCAA's,"
said head coach Vin Lananna.
"These meets will provide our ath
letes with excellent opportunities
to achieve qualifying perfor
mances."
Freshmen Jay Goff and John
Darcy are expected to excel at
Azusa Pacific in the decathlon, as
is senior Joy Goff in the hep
tathlon.
The men's team is sending
powerful distance and middle-dis
tance squads to Mt. SAC. All-
American and senior team captain
Jason Balkman will lead the dis

tance runners in the 5000 meters
on Friday, and NCAA Champion
redshirt sophomore Gabe Jen
nings will lead the middle-distance
runners on Saturday. Senior Toby
Stevenson of the men's team will
compete in the pole vault.
The women's team also sends a
strong distance squad to Mt. SAC.
Redshirt junior Sally Glynn will
represent Stanford in the 5000
meters on Friday night. Seniors
Summer Pierson and team captain
Maureen Onyeagbako will lead
the women's throwers in discus
and hammer, respectively, and an
ticipate making a strong impact.
"The Mt. SAC Relays will allow
our athletes to compete with the
best athletes in the country. We
will face our toughest competition,
which will help us prepare for the
Pac-10 Championships in May.
We plan to return home with
many more Pac-10 and NCAA
qualifiers," Lananna said.
The Cardinal will face able coin
petition at Mt. SAC! from such
powerhouse programs as USC,
UCLA, Oregon, Arizona,
Arkansas, and Brigham Young.
Last weekend at Hayward
Field, the site of this May's Pac-10
championships, the team had the
opportunity to master the facilities
in preparation for the competi
tion. This weekend, the Cardinal
will also be competing against
many of the same athletes that will
likely figure into the field at the
Pac-lOs. These previews of the site
and competitors will give the Car
dinal an advantage in its prepara
tion for the competition.
With its long-term goal of na
tional success in mind, the team
anticipates positive results this
weekend.
"Our training has been going
very well, and this weekend will
allow us to capitalize on the great
weather and competition," Lanan
na said.
