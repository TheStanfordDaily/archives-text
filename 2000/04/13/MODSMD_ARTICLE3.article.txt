# ASSU Election season begins as slates, candidates, groups push for next week's votes
## Campaign Kick-off 
### KEITH ITO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Like the morning dew, thousands of brightly
colored campaign flyers materialized on bulletin
boards and traffic bollards across campus
Wednesday morning, marking the start of cam
paigning lot next week's ASSU elections.
"Campaigning is going to be a pretty busy
time," said presidential candidate Ben Liu, a ju

nior. "But it's also one of the most exciting times
of the year. Here's the chance for candidates to
tell people what they are doing and what they
hope to accomplish and have people listen."
Many candidates are seeking to locus their
campaigns on issues in an effort to address the
criticism that ASSU elections in the past have
been mainly based on name recognition.

The birdcage in White Plaza, along with bollards, kiosks and bathrooms around campus, was transformed into
a vehicle for puns, slogans, and a barrage of candidate names, as campaigning for ASSU elections began.
"I was surprised to hear that in
the past everything was catchy
and flyer-based," said I nder
graduatc Senate candidate
Sunaina Sinha, a freslunan. " 1 he
issues are an integral part of a
campaign."
Along the same lines, the
ASSU has done away with a
paper elections handbook, in
stead publishing it exclusively
online at li11p://election.Stan
ford. edu.
The online handbook re
moves the 250-word limit for
candidate descriptions, allowing
candidates to submit their entire
platforms and better express
their views on particular issues.
For the first time, the election
will be condui ted completely on
line at the elections Web site. In
the past, in addition to the Web
site, papei polling sites were
placed around graduate student
areas in an effort to increase
graduate participation.
However, the ASSI Elections
Commission decided that such
funding could be better used in
promoting the election Web site.
"The paper ballots were ex
trernely expensive and they ac
counted for less than one percent
of the vote," said ASSU Elections
Commissioner Jason Rang, a
masters' student in economics.
"We decided we could do a better
job il it was online.
Also new this year is the de
merit svstem for addressing cam
paign rules violations, replacing
the fines that existed in previous
years. 1 lie number of violations
will appear on the ballot next to
the candidate's name. The
change was intended to increase
economic equality in campaign
ing.
"II you're wealthy, what's a
twenty dollar line? I bis levels out
the playing field," Rang said.
Other c hanges to the election
process have been relatively
minor, such .is a new $ 100 spend
ing limit lor special fees campaigns
and approval lor candidates to
post livers in bathroom stalls.
"When people are in the bath
room, they like to read," said Un
dergraduate Senate candidate
Serge Rassardjian, a sophomore.
"It provides candidates a chance
to provide more information."
Most races will be hotly con
tested, with two slates of candi
dates for president and vice pres
ident, two to three slates running
for each of the class presidencies,
and 28 students running for 15
I Indergraduate Senate seats.
"It's going to be a really tough
race," said presidential candidate
Set li Newton, a junior. "And it
u ill be a great opportunity to ad
dress what the ASSI is supposed
to be doing."

1 lie exception is the Graduate
Student Council, with only 11
registered candidates vying for
15 seats on the Council. As a re
sult, at least lour of the seats will
go to write-in candidates.
These races are not the only is
sues on the ballot. There are 35
groups applying for over $1 mil
lion in special fees.
Since the fee system was re
vised several years ago, groups
have placed their request for fees
on either the undergraduate bal
lot or on all student ballots. 1 low
ever, for the first time, the Grad
uate Women's Network is plac
ing their request for fees only on
the graduate student ballot.
In order for a fee request to be
approved, a group needs to get a
"yes" vote from at least 15 per
cent of registered students, and
"yes" votes must outnumber "no"
votes. Groups that are approved
receive their full request, and
those who do not receive noth
ing.
"This system is excellent in
that you can express your sup
port for a group by voting for
special fees, but if you have a fi
nancial hardship, you can re
quest a refund later," said sopho
more Joel Segre, a team leader of
the Solar Car Project, which is re
questing 1,202 in special fees.
The Elections Commission
and Students for Better Educa
tion have planned several events
this week to increase voter aware
ness. Tonight, the ASSU will host
an opportunity for students to
meet their class presidential
slates at Stern Dining Hall from 7
p.m. to 10 p.m.
This Sunday, the two ASSU
presidential and vice-presiden
tial candidates will square off in a
debate at the Coffee House, cov
ered by KZSU and SCBN.
"I hope we can have a sincere
debate based on the differences
in our visions," Newton said. "It's
going to be an opportunity to ad
dress what the ASSU is really
supposed to be doing."
Other campaign trail events in
clude a senate and special fees day
Monday afternoon in White Plaza,
and a party Friday in Roble Half
where students will have a chance
to meet candidates.
Polls will open on the Web at
midnight on Wednesday, April
19 and will remain open for 48
hours.
Rang said he expects that
voter turnout will be lower than
last year, as there are no mea
sures on the ballot that are as
controversial as last year's consti
tutional amendment to split the
ASSU Senate into the Under
graduate Senate and the Gradu
ate Student Council.
"Last year was the highest
turnout we've ever had," said
Rang. "You get a higher voter

nior. "But it's also one of the most exciting times
of the year. Here's the chance for candidates to
tell people what they are doing and what they
hope to accomplish and have people listen."
Many candidates are seeking to locus their
campaigns on issues in an effort to address the
criticism that ASSU elections in the past have
been mainly based on name recognition.

The birdcage in White Plaza, along with bollards, kiosks and bathrooms around campus, was transformed into
a vehicle for puns, slogans, and a barrage of candidate names, as campaigning for ASSU elections began.
"I was surprised to hear that in
the past everything was catchy
and flyer-based," said I nder
graduatc Senate candidate
Sunaina Sinha, a freslunan. " 1 he
issues are an integral part of a
campaign."
Along the same lines, the
ASSU has done away with a
paper elections handbook, in
stead publishing it exclusively
online at li11p://election.Stan
ford. edu.
The online handbook re
moves the 250-word limit for
candidate descriptions, allowing
candidates to submit their entire
platforms and better express
their views on particular issues.
For the first time, the election
will be condui ted completely on
line at the elections Web site. In
the past, in addition to the Web
site, papei polling sites were
placed around graduate student
areas in an effort to increase
graduate participation.
However, the ASSI Elections
Commission decided that such
funding could be better used in
promoting the election Web site.
"The paper ballots were ex
trernely expensive and they ac
counted for less than one percent
of the vote," said ASSU Elections
Commissioner Jason Rang, a
masters' student in economics.
"We decided we could do a better
job il it was online.
Also new this year is the de
merit svstem for addressing cam
paign rules violations, replacing
the fines that existed in previous
years. 1 lie number of violations
will appear on the ballot next to
the candidate's name. The
change was intended to increase
economic equality in campaign
ing.
"II you're wealthy, what's a
twenty dollar line? I bis levels out
the playing field," Rang said.
Other c hanges to the election
process have been relatively
minor, such .is a new $ 100 spend
ing limit lor special fees campaigns
and approval lor candidates to
post livers in bathroom stalls.
"When people are in the bath
room, they like to read," said Un
dergraduate Senate candidate
Serge Rassardjian, a sophomore.
"It provides candidates a chance
to provide more information."
Most races will be hotly con
tested, with two slates of candi
dates for president and vice pres
ident, two to three slates running
for each of the class presidencies,
and 28 students running for 15
I Indergraduate Senate seats.
"It's going to be a really tough
race," said presidential candidate
Set li Newton, a junior. "And it
u ill be a great opportunity to ad
dress what the ASSI is supposed
to be doing."

1 lie exception is the Graduate
Student Council, with only 11
registered candidates vying for
15 seats on the Council. As a re
sult, at least lour of the seats will
go to write-in candidates.
These races are not the only is
sues on the ballot. There are 35
groups applying for over $1 mil
lion in special fees.
Since the fee system was re
vised several years ago, groups
have placed their request for fees
on either the undergraduate bal
lot or on all student ballots. 1 low
ever, for the first time, the Grad
uate Women's Network is plac
ing their request for fees only on
the graduate student ballot.
In order for a fee request to be
approved, a group needs to get a
"yes" vote from at least 15 per
cent of registered students, and
"yes" votes must outnumber "no"
votes. Groups that are approved
receive their full request, and
those who do not receive noth
ing.
"This system is excellent in
that you can express your sup
port for a group by voting for
special fees, but if you have a fi
nancial hardship, you can re
quest a refund later," said sopho
more Joel Segre, a team leader of
the Solar Car Project, which is re
questing 1,202 in special fees.
The Elections Commission
and Students for Better Educa
tion have planned several events
this week to increase voter aware
ness. Tonight, the ASSU will host
an opportunity for students to
meet their class presidential
slates at Stern Dining Hall from 7
p.m. to 10 p.m.
This Sunday, the two ASSU
presidential and vice-presiden
tial candidates will square off in a
debate at the Coffee House, cov
ered by KZSU and SCBN.
"I hope we can have a sincere
debate based on the differences
in our visions," Newton said. "It's
going to be an opportunity to ad
dress what the ASSU is really
supposed to be doing."
Other campaign trail events in
clude a senate and special fees day
Monday afternoon in White Plaza,
and a party Friday in Roble Half
where students will have a chance
to meet candidates.
Polls will open on the Web at
midnight on Wednesday, April
19 and will remain open for 48
hours.
Rang said he expects that
voter turnout will be lower than
last year, as there are no mea
sures on the ballot that are as
controversial as last year's consti
tutional amendment to split the
ASSU Senate into the Under
graduate Senate and the Gradu
ate Student Council.
"Last year was the highest
turnout we've ever had," said
Rang. "You get a higher voter
turnout if there are heated issues
and this year they aren't there."
