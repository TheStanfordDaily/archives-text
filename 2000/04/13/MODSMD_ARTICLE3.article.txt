Like the morning dew, thousands of brightly
colored campaign flyers materialized on bulletin
boards and traffic bollards across campus
Wednesday morning, marking the start of cam
paigning lot next week's ASSU elections.
"Campaigning is going to be a pretty busy
time," said presidential candidate Ben Liu, a ju

nior. "But it's also one of the most exciting times
of the year. Here's the chance for candidates to
tell people what they are doing and what they
hope to accomplish and have people listen."
Many candidates are seeking to locus their
campaigns on issues in an effort to address the
criticism that ASSU elections in the past have
been mainly based on name recognition.

The birdcage in White Plaza, along with bollards, kiosks and bathrooms around campus, was transformed into
a vehicle for puns, slogans, and a barrage of candidate names, as campaigning for ASSU elections began.
