\ M Marchetto is a high-energy, living cartoon — an
M embodiment of some of the world's most famous
K stars. His unique show is a set of about 50 celebrity
m impersonations (although his constantly-evolving
i repetoire includes over 100).
Ennio is no run-of-the-mill impersonator, though.
While many performers have delighted audiences
by impersonating celebrities, Ennio has created a
unique work of art. His performance is unique
mainly because his costumes, wigs, and props are
all made of paper. Within 70 minutes, Ennio trans
forms into over 50 paper characters with simple
changes like the folding over of a Hap and Hipping
of a multi-sided hat. For example, he hilariously
turns from Celine Dion into the Titanic. He trans
forms into a busty Britney Spears from Ricky Mar
tin. The Pope becomes Fidel Castro. All the imper
sonations are set to appropriate music — for pop
musicians he chooses their most popular songs, but
Fidel Castro, for example, dances to "Guantanam
era" while smoking a fat one. Ennio does not speak
a word throughout the show, but manages to pull
off a fast-paced performance that is far more enter
taining than any celebrity impersonation you may
see in Las Vegas.
Surprisingly, Ennio is a quiet, soft-spoken man
when lie is not on stage. In an interview with him
last week, I expected to meet a wildly animated
extrovert who adored the limelight, but he seemed
unaffected by the fame his show has brought him.
That is not to say that he does not love his work —
Ennio plans to continue working with his paper
costumes until his body won't let him. "It is a very
physical show," he explained. "I hope 1 can do the
same show when I am (50, but I

cloth costumes for Carnival in
Venice.
"I had a dream about Marilyn
Monroe dressed in paper. I woke
up and decided to make the cos
tume," Ennio explained. "Then I
kept thinking of other ones that
would be interesting, and made
more and more." After creating an
impressive array of characters,

Ennio opened his show at the Edin
burgh Fringe Festival in 1990, and
immediately became a runaway suc
cess.

Ennio has been nominated for a
wide variety of awards, including
the British Olivier Award for Best
Entertainment, and has won many
prestigious awards as well, includ-

ing Venice's Golden Lion. Ennio
attributes part of his success to the fact
that his show is appealing to a wide
variety of audiences.

"This show is for everybody," he
said. "I like to have a mixed audi
ence. 1 wish I had more young peo
ple, but 1 know young people don't
always have $30 to pay [for a tick
et]. But soon we will be advertis
ing on MTV. Some of the c harac
ters, like Ricky Martin, Alanis
Morrisette, appeal to a younger
audience."

Ennio's influences go as far back as
(he ancient Italian "commedia
dell'Arte," but he attributes his ideas
largely to his childhood in front of the
TV. "As a child 1 watched cartoons, I
watched a lot of Disney movies," he said.
Ennio refuses to call

doubt it. But this is my only show.
If I can do this until I am 60 I
will."
Ennio grew up in Venice, Italy
with a love for theater, and came
up with the idea for his show from

show and it is so different. There is a lot of sur
prise and action in the show, and mime is usually
slow. But of course I do a mime because I don't
use my voice and only my body. It is very visual.
It is in between dance and mime."
I'lie show is mostly made up of internationally
known icons, but Knnio said that lie needs to add
some more culturally specific characters when he
travels to different countries. "I change my show a
lot, although some, like the American characters,
are universally known. If 1 go to France I have to
add characters like Brigilte Bardot, but I have to
always keep the Mona Lisa, Marilyn [Monroe] and
the more well known icons."
When asked whether he prefers performing in
Italy or America, lu- professed that he loves work
ing in America, but that people seem more easil)

offended licit*. "1 recievecl a letter yesterday about
Barbara Streisand saying that in my show she was
offensive to Jewish people because her nose was
huge. But I do the Pope and that doesn't offend
Catholics, I d<> Dolly l'arton and her huge breasts.
Barbara Streisand is famous for her big nose, just
like Dolly l'arton for her breasts."
It is amazing that Knnio can dance and make
onstage changes with his costumes without them
tearing apart, but he works with a costume design
er to make sure they are mobile and functional.
"They don't break. I sweat every night because I
am afraid they will, but there is plastic on the
backs of all of them that helps keep them togeth
er. This particular set of costumes have lasted for
100 shows."
Knnio will only be in San Franc isco until Max 7,
when he will return to Venice for a much-needed
break from performing (he has been working
every night since February ). I highly recommend
catching his show before it leaves town, as the
entire audience left with smiles on their faces. And
at only 70 minutes, it will certainly not test your
attention span.

tin. The Pope becomes Fidel Castro. All the imper
sonations are set to appropriate music — for pop
musicians he chooses their most popular songs, but
Fidel Castro, for example, dances to "Guantanam
era" while smoking a fat one. Ennio does not speak
a word throughout the show, but manages to pull
off a fast-paced performance that is far more enter
taining than any celebrity impersonation you may
see in Las Vegas.
Surprisingly, Ennio is a quiet, soft-spoken man
when lie is not on stage. In an interview with him
last week, I expected to meet a wildly animated
extrovert who adored the limelight, but he seemed
unaffected by the fame his show has brought him.
That is not to say that he does not love his work —
Ennio plans to continue working with his paper
costumes until his body won't let him. "It is a very
physical show," he explained. "I hope 1 can do the
same show when I am (50, but I

cloth costumes for Carnival in
Venice.
"I had a dream about Marilyn
Monroe dressed in paper. I woke
up and decided to make the cos
tume," Ennio explained. "Then I
kept thinking of other ones that
would be interesting, and made
more and more." After creating an
impressive array of characters,

Ennio opened his show at the Edin
burgh Fringe Festival in 1990, and
immediately became a runaway suc
cess.

Ennio has been nominated for a
wide variety of awards, including
the British Olivier Award for Best
Entertainment, and has won many
prestigious awards as well, includ-

ing Venice's Golden Lion. Ennio
attributes part of his success to the fact
that his show is appealing to a wide
variety of audiences.

"This show is for everybody," he
said. "I like to have a mixed audi
ence. 1 wish I had more young peo
ple, but 1 know young people don't
always have $30 to pay [for a tick
et]. But soon we will be advertis
ing on MTV. Some of the c harac
ters, like Ricky Martin, Alanis
Morrisette, appeal to a younger
audience."

Ennio's influences go as far back as
(he ancient Italian "commedia
dell'Arte," but he attributes his ideas
largely to his childhood in front of the
TV. "As a child 1 watched cartoons, I
watched a lot of Disney movies," he said.
Ennio refuses to call

doubt it. But this is my only show.
If I can do this until I am 60 I
will."
Ennio grew up in Venice, Italy
with a love for theater, and came
up with the idea for his show from
a dream he had while making

himself a mime, but his
show does include a wide
variety of performance art
influences. "1 like modern
dance. 1 don't match up with
classical mime. This show is

not a mime, people always think this is a mime
show and it is so different. There is a lot of sur
prise and action in the show, and mime is usually
slow. But of course I do a mime because I don't
use my voice and only my body. It is very visual.
It is in between dance and mime."
I'lie show is mostly made up of internationally
known icons, but Knnio said that lie needs to add
some more culturally specific characters when he
travels to different countries. "I change my show a
lot, although some, like the American characters,
are universally known. If 1 go to France I have to
add characters like Brigilte Bardot, but I have to
always keep the Mona Lisa, Marilyn [Monroe] and
the more well known icons."
When asked whether he prefers performing in
Italy or America, lu- professed that he loves work
ing in America, but that people seem more easil)

offended licit*. "1 recievecl a letter yesterday about
Barbara Streisand saying that in my show she was
offensive to Jewish people because her nose was
huge. But I do the Pope and that doesn't offend
Catholics, I d<> Dolly l'arton and her huge breasts.
Barbara Streisand is famous for her big nose, just
like Dolly l'arton for her breasts."
It is amazing that Knnio can dance and make
onstage changes with his costumes without them
tearing apart, but he works with a costume design
er to make sure they are mobile and functional.
"They don't break. I sweat every night because I
am afraid they will, but there is plastic on the
backs of all of them that helps keep them togeth
er. This particular set of costumes have lasted for
100 shows."
Knnio will only be in San Franc isco until Max 7,
when he will return to Venice for a much-needed
break from performing (he has been working
every night since February ). I highly recommend
catching his show before it leaves town, as the
entire audience left with smiles on their faces. And
at only 70 minutes, it will certainly not test your
attention span.
