rewarded for finishing dinner or visiting the W.C.? Or perhaps
this sophisticated tyke was an enormous fan of composer and lyricist
Schwartz and the swanky look and feel of a Fosse period piece.

Whatever the reason, this little person found himself bawling at the
opening moments of a fog-filled stage in this kinetically charged and high
ly satisfying evening of rather adult theater. And in the following uninter
rupted two hours, our nameless hero witnessed any number of the fbl

We must all hope and pray for the future of this pool child, for

moments of the show lacked much-needed oomph and vir
tuoso quality, the production is nevertheless a treat — for
anyone out of diapers, that is.
"Pippin" follows the tale of the eldest son of ninth cen
tury King Charlemagne (Nathan Bavnard), as he returns
home from college and begins to experiment with the
choices that life oilers him. In many ways, it's "Candide"
on acid, as Pippin (Scott Reilly) searches endlessly for ful
fillment and the best of all possible worlds.
Structured as a play-within-a-play, Pippin gets a great
deal of mileage out of self-referential humor, much of
which is facilitated by the swanky and cunning Lead Play
er (|oh 11 Wright). Ultimately, Pippin is faced with a dec i
sion between a grand suicide promoted by the Lead Play
er and his troupe or a hum-drum marriage to the lovely
Catherine (Kelly Dunagan).
In the talent department, this production offers one of
the most solid casts in any Ram's Head production in
recent memory. Reilly's Pippin is sensitive, strong-willed,
comic and likeable.
Baynard's Charlemagne is a hilarious portrait of the
medieval titling class with dead-oil anachronistic comic
flair. Dunagan, too, is able to pull off the sweet and some

what underwritten role of Pippin's love interest effortless
ly.
Wright's Lead Player deserves special mention. He
glides around the stage with attitude and a devilish ease in
the style of Alan Cuinniings of "Cabaret" fame. Wright
serves in many ways as the anchor of this piece. A work
with so many different styles and devices needs a strong
consistent figure to hold the piece together and Wright
does justice for his eclectic ensemble.
But the real show-stopper of the evening is Adrian
Khactu and his incomparable and frightfully dead-oil drag
performance as Pippin's gradinothei Bertlie. Khac tu has a
presence so big he practically knocks his fellow ac tors oil
the stage. And it's a good thing he only appears in one
downright hilarious musical number, "No Time At All,"
otherwise it might me hard to pay attention to the several
other laudable components of this fine production. When
Khac tu stops his number mid-way through to tell the cho
rus to stop singing in his solo, we're not quite sure if we're
witnessing a real drag diva at work or merely a comic
device. It's a scary moment.
A most talented director, Andrew Leeds leads his
ensemble to greatness, giving the production a unique
look and feel of its own. This critic not only admires the
craft and comic timing of Mr. Leeds, but is also sure this
young man is destined to be a strong voice in American
musical theater if he c hooses to follow that path.
Sara Nell and Rachel Meisels deserve kudos for their
simple but highly functional set, as does Caroline Cliao
and Chad Bonaker for truly fantastic lighting design.
