Wynton Marsalis, the most popular and acclaimed jazz
musician of his generation, has helped bring jazz into the
mainstream of modern American culture. As both an
accomplished classical musician and a masterful jazz impro
viser on the trumpet, Marsalis was the first artist ever to win

Cirammys in both categories in
1983 and again in 1984.
On April 14, Marsalis and the
Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra
(LCJO), will be bringing their
"For Dancers Only" tour to
Stanford. The concert and
swing dance is being presented
by Stanford Lively Arts in
honor of its 30th Anniversary.

the LCJO and artistic director for
the J@LC. On tour with the LCJO for more than half of
each year, Marsalis also conducts educational programs and
hosts the popular 'Jazz for Young People" concerts pro
duced byJ@LC.
Additionally, Marsalis spends a considerable amount of
time composing new works, many of which are premiered
