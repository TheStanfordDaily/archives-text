Wynton Marsalis, the most popular and acclaimed jazz
musician of his generation, has helped bring jazz into the
mainstream of modern American culture. As both an
accomplished classical musician and a masterful jazz impro
viser on the trumpet, Marsalis was the first artist ever to win

Cirammys in both categories in
1983 and again in 1984.
On April 14, Marsalis and the
Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra
(LCJO), will be bringing their
"For Dancers Only" tour to
Stanford. The concert and
swing dance is being presented
by Stanford Lively Arts in
honor of its 30th Anniversary.
Marsalis is perhaps the most
respected teacher and
spokesperson for jazz in the
modern age, making him the
perfect choice as music director of

the LCJO and artistic director for
the J@LC. On tour with the LCJO for more than half of
each year, Marsalis also conducts educational programs and
hosts the popular 'Jazz for Young People" concerts pro
duced byJ@LC.
Additionally, Marsalis spends a considerable amount of
time composing new works, many of which are premiered

by J@LC. One such work, 11 is oratorio
"Blood on the Fields," won the presti
gious Pulitzei Prize in music, making
Marsalis the first jazz artist to win that
award.
Marsalis first came into the musical
spotlight in the 1980s. He led a school
of performance termed "neoclassicism"
that drew on the jazz era of bebop. At
lirst, Marsalis specifically modeled his
music alter the Miles Davis band of the
19605. By the late '80s, Marsalis had
also begun to venture into the blues
.uid Dixieland music.
Ilis traditionalist view ol music runs
counter to the other school of modern
jazz, fusion, which mixes jaz/. with other
genres, such as rock and rap. However,
crowds have shown appreciation for
Marsalis's jazz purism; over the last 17
years, Marsalis has recorded more than
30 jazz and classical recordings, win
ning an impressive eight Orammy
awards, lime magazine named him
one of "America's 25 Most Influential
People" and Life magazine deemed him
one of the "50 Most Influential
Boomers."
For over a decade, Marsalis has led
the Lincoln Outer Jazz. Orchestra, the
resident orchestra of Jaz./ at Lincoln
Center (J@LC). J@l,C is the world's
largest non-profit arts organization. Its
mission is to promote appreciation,
understanding, and preservation of jazz
through performance and education.
I lie ]((/ LC uses L(]JO in all aspects of
its program. The LCJO performs and
leads education events around the
globe in a variety of performance set
tings, with symphony orchestras, ballet
troupes, local students, and an increas
ingly growing number of guest artists.
Annually, the orchestra's programs
reach over 100,000 students, teachers
and general audience members.
Awareness <>l the significant accom
plishments of the ensemble has been
developed through television broad
casts all over the world. ()n April 8 their
performance with the New York Phil
harmonic was viewed by more than 1.4
million households and received an
Kmmy nomination for "Outstanding
(classical Music -Dance .Program."
I he orchestra wasltljo featured in the
1999 WNF/f "C.rAf Performances"
documentary, "Swinging with Duke:

I <*««. I*l •
Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra with
Wvnton Marsalis." Throughout 1999,
they played the music of Duke Elling
ton at every performance, in celebra
tion of The Ellington Centennial."
I hat same year, LCJO also released
three of their eight recordings.
While the orchestra performs a vari
ety of classic jazz compositions, they also
premiere works commissioned from a
variety of modern composers like
Wayne Shorter and Christian Mcßride,
as well as LCJO members Ted Nash and
Wynton Marsalis.
I he event's theme, "For Dancers
Only," takes its name from the tune
recorded by bandleader J immie Lunce
ford in 1937. Early jazz musicians rec
ognized and embraced the unique
bond between jazz and dancing, using
jumping rhythms in their music to get
the crowd dancing. Audience members
couldn't listen to swinging songs like
"lor Dancers Only" without bopping
their heads and stepping out onto the
dance lloor.
1 lowever, as jazz gradually moved
away from dance clubs and into concert
halls, the sacred tie between jazz and
dance was broken. Much like classical
music, jazz became a music that audi
ences respectfulh appreciated from
their seats. Reaching back to the spirit
of swing, LCJO created this tour with
the intent of reviving the original func
tion of jazz music, which was to get the
audience on its feet.
Aiming to inspire modern jazz listen
ers to create their own dance moves,
LCJO musicians wrote new music
specifically for this tour. Using these
new compositions along with classic
swing masterpieces, LCJO is introduc
ing a new generation to the traditional
pairing of jazz and dance.
The Stanford Lively Arts Gala Con
cert and Swing Dance featuring the
Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra with
Wynton Marsalis will take place at the
Gala Pavilion, adjacent to Frost
Amphitheater, on April 14 at 8:00 p.m.
