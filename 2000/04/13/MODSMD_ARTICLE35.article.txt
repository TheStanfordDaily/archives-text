## 'Psycho' is deadly dull 
### ALEX OSIPOVICH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After hacking a friencl to death in the living room of his
stylisli Manhattan apartment, Patrick Bateman (plaved hy
Christian Bale) drags the body outside and dumps it into
the trunk of a waiting cab. To his horror, a neighhoi walks
by and peers into the open trunk. "Where did you get that
overnight bag?" lie asks jealously. "Jean-Paul Caultier,"
Patrick replies without skipping a beat.
Welcome to the world of "American Psycho," a vicious
black comedy set in New York during the late 19S()s. 1 he
title character is Patrick Bateman, a high-powered Wall
Street financier who enjoys fine lotions, upscale restaurants
and sadistic homicidal fantasies. The lilin shows us a series
of highly violent episodes which ma\ or may not be taking

place in Patrick's head.
"American Psycho" is
based on the 1991 novel
by Bret Easton Ellis,
which caused a storm of
controversy because of
its graphic descriptions
of sexual torture. Fortu
nately, the film tones
down the elaborate,
misogynistic violence of
the book, and the mur
ders we see are highly
stylized and much of the
gore takes place off
screen.

Patrick is intensely shallow and materialistic. Ilis yup
pie friends are preoccupied with owning the best design
er suit or the slickest business card. None of them, not
even his fiance Evelyn (Reese Withet spoon), suspect that
Patrick is a brooding psvchopalh.
1 lie point of "American Psycho," which is about as sub
tle as an axe through the skull, is that the "greed is good"
mantra of the Reagan era was shameless and inhuman.
As social satire, it fits squareh in the vuppies-gone-nuts
genre of "Eight Club"and "American Beauty," but com
pared to them ii fails miserablv. Both Kevin Spacey and
Edward Norton played compelling, sympathetic charac
ters. And let's face it movies with zero emotion onl\
woi k if you're Stanley Rubric k.
I lie main weakness of the film is the script, In writer/
director Man llario.n and Cuinevere Turner. Except for

the reality-bending conclusion
— in w hie Ii Pat rick spirals
towards a Raskolnikov-like con
fession — most of the film seems
long and pointless. A string of
homicidal fantasies might make
a good experimental novel, but it
doesn't make a very good movie.
On the plus

. side, "American
Psycho" does a
d e 1 i c i o us 1 y

recreating the
style and tone

I lie photography is excellent, thanks to the technical
supervision of Andrzej Sekula, who is 110 stranger to styl
ized violence — his credits include "Pulp Fiction" and
"Reservoir Dogs."
Christian Bale's acting is commendable, given that his
character lac ks almost any human emotion. Willem Dafbe
as a suspicious detective and Stanford's own Witherspoon
are similarly one-dimensional. Pretty boy JarerJ Leto grad
uates from getting his face beaten into a pulp in "Fight
Club" to being chopped up with an axe in "American Psy
cho."

Finally, you can expect a marketing
blitz for the "American Psycho" sound
track, which is loaded with feel-good
pop from the 'HOs. Psychotic Patrick
likes to play Huey Lewis and the News
while hacking up his friends. Too bad
the movie isn't "Simply Irresistible."
