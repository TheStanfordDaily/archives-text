# Unfocused beauty
## 
### RANDY MANO STAFF WRITER 
The opening few minutes wisely plunge
you immediately into the mind of a blind
individual. "The Color of Paradise," the
latest offering from director-ui itei Majid
Majidi, relies heavily on sensual informa
tion from one's surroundings. At the heart
is an innocent blind bo\ named Moham
mad (Molisen Ramezani), a most unique
film subject. My only gripe is Majidi's lack
of focus.
The meandering look at Mohammad's
life begins at a city school in I ehran. I he
first 15 minutes are highly engaging; we
see him interact with a fallen babv bird
and his classmates. It is also established
that his father 1 lashein (I {ossein Mahjoub)
is a real downer. 1 lashein blames others
(including Cod) for his run ol bad luck —
his wife passed awa\ several years before,
forcing him to take care of both Moham
mad and his mother.
Majidi does an admirable job with the
cinematography, as the rolling vistas of
Iran are a real spectacle. I had no idea that
so much beauty lies virtually undiscovered
in the countryside; likewise, the cultural
intricancies involved in courtship, school
ing and home repair are welcome gusts ol
fresh air.
Where Majidi falters a bit is when the
story tries to turn subtly symbolic.
Mohammad tries to "read" the calls of the
wild and the crops 011 grandma s (aim
with his hands by utilizing the Braille tech
niques learned in school. But lit- had
already been told his hands are a connec
tion to Cod, so sure enough, we see
Mohammad get reborn with his first visit
to the ocean (water as a symbol) and a stint
with a blind carpenter (carpentry as a sym
bol).
Also slightly problematic is.the use of
music to dictate the mood of a scene.
Instead of drowning the audience with
overtly sympathetic notes, the push should
have been for more graceful and calm
ways to back up the situation. For instance,
the inclusion of local animal noises is one
successful way to increase the level of
awareness for the boy's plight.
"The Color of Paradise" is a thoughtful
look at what effect a handicap and a reli
gion can have on one family's lives. For
roughly 90 minutes, we delve into
Mohammad's sensory world, which is
alternatingly painful and uplifting.
Regardless of whether you have seen Maji
di's previous effort, "(children of 1 leaven,"

this for
eign film
deserves
a look
from the
pati en t
and the
curious.
