# Unoriginal plot kills 'Engagement'
## 
### FRED VALLAEYS STAFF WRITER 
Rules <>l Engagement" is an exciting
military thriller but its concept is far
from new. In this film In Academy
Award winner William Fi iedkin, a higli
l\ decorated war hero is set up t'> take
the fall for a rest lie mission gone terribly
wrong. While the acting and the visuals
kf|)t me hooked the entire time, the end
tin lied out to be a real letdown.
I lie film starts in Vietnam, where
Colonel I lodges (Tomin\ I,ee (ones) is in
the middle of .1 battle where his troops
are being slaughtered In the enemy. At
the last possible moment, Colonel

Childers (Samuel E. Jackson) intervenes and saves the life of
the badlv wounded I lodges, whose davs as a warrior are over.
I lodges goes on to become a mediocre military lawyei while
Childers continues leading his troops into combat wherever
he's needed.
Many years later. Childers is sent to protect the I.S.
Embassy in Yemen from an attack by a large crowd of
protesters. When he orders his troops to fire into the crowd,
he is responsible for S.'i kills, including c hildren,/women and
elderly people. When the authorities search the dead for
weapons more than a day aftei the massacre, the\ claim that
the protesters carried no guns. 1 he result is an international
outcry against the l .S. I he Secretary of Defense. Wyatt (Con
rad Baehmaun) responds by claiming the whole fiasco was

Childei s' fault, and consequently. Childers is
charged with 83 counts of murder.
Childers whose life now depends on the
quality of hi", defense lawvet, decides that he
wants I lodges to return his favor fiom Viet
nam by 11 \ ing to save his life in court. I lodges
has nevei won a case of any significance and
is undersiandabh ner\ous about the trial. He
sets out to show that Childers' order to fire

into tht' crowd was justified under t lie "rules of engagement."
If it can he shown that the crowd fired first, Childers would go
free. The problem is that the only American besides Childers
who saw the crowd shooting was killed in action. Moreover, a
videotape that could give the definitive answer is mysteriously
lost by the Secretary of State.
As always, Jackson portrays his character with an inner rage
that is very compelling. He is at his best when he lets loose in
his split-second decision to engage the crowd in battle, and in
his passionate testimony on the stand. Jones deals well with the
shortcomings of his character. While he is supposed to be a
bad lawyer, the things he says in court give little indication of
ihis. lie handles it with grace by gradually transitioning from
ail insecure lawyer to one brimming with confidence.
I he visuals; of this film, particularly the Yemen scenes

(filmed in Morocco) were very captivating
— beautiful and exotic, yet riddled with
ugly violence. The story is a great por
trayal of the events at the embassy as
experienced by different characters.
Unfortunately, the conclusion of the trial
was fairly weak, making the last minutes
of this otherwise good film a real disap
pointment.
