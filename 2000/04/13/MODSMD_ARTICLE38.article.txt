### LUKE MINER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Simply put. "Readv lo Rumble' is
nothing more than a misogynistic
advertisement toi professional
wrestling. With big-breasted women
and even bigger-breasted wrestlers, this
movie is devoid of any substance. But if
yon'ie willing to look past ,ill ibis, it is
still worth ;i watch on a lazy Sunday
afternoon. Fven though "Ready lo
Rumble'' is terribh written, it is saved by
David Arquette's brillianllv frenetic per
formance which begs the <|uestion:
"What drug is lie on and xvliei e can I get
some?"
"Readv lo Rumble" tells the storv of
two die-hard wrestling lans, C.ordie
Boggs and Sean Dawkius (played b\
David Ai(|iiette and Scott (laan), who
can't seem to understand that profes
si(>n.ll wrestling is fiike. \s a result, when
tlicit favorite wrestlei |imm) King
(()li\ei I'latt) is ki< ked out <>l the league,
thex embark upon an epic journev to
find "the King" and return him to his
throne.

I he first hall Of 'the movie unrolls like
one gigantic poop joke, (iordie puts his
hand clown his pants and then waves it
in front of a mini-marl link's face (a
joke which was obviously stolen from
Mallrais). (>ordic and Sean eat ham
burgers while raw sewage drips behind
them, (.oidic and Sean crash their
true k, launching lecal matter into the
faces of some unwilling highway patrol
men. Ciordie and Sean spend twelve
hours in a van with an order of farting
nuns. Sound lamer li most certainly is
â€” and \ei l)a\id Arcpiette's acting din
ing all these scenes is so precise, the
caclence of his dialogues so inspired that
he manages lo rescue these hoirible
jokes. At his best, Ar<|iiclte is like a cat
attached to a car batten: eager and
chattelv, but obvioush lacking several
fundamental brain lunc-

Hons.
"Readx In Rumble"
loses some ol steam
when the\ linalK locate
the King. Although ()liv
er I'latt is a superb actor,
in a movie filled with

"Ready to Rumbled
Warner Bros i
PG-13 /
Playing

overbuilt WGW wrestlers, his pudgy
weakness seems strangely out of place.
Kqually inappropriate is the blatant
misogyny that runs rampant in this
movie. From the extremely curvaceous
Rose McGowan to tlie nasty old woman
with a face like an elephant's tanned ass,
every female that Gordie and Sean meet
is either fantastically attractive or fantas
tically revolting. The only woman who is
treated positively is a fawning ditz who
sleeps with Sean at the drop of a hat.
Martin Landau (of "Grimes And Mis
demeanors" and "Ed Wood") has a
cameo appearance as an old-time
wrestler turned trainer. His perfor
mance ("Press Mil \ou hear the cartilage
snap!") is especially hilarious. Surpris
ingly, the guest-starring wrestlers (espe
cially Goldberg) demonstrate real acting
talent as well. This

may not be the best
movie out in the
aters today but il
you go into it
expecting very little,
you may be pleas
antly surprised.
