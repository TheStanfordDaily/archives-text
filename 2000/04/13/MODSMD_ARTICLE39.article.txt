## So. Cal original sells out to MTV 
### JUNG LAH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"I hate everything, f--k you!" screams
vocalist Jason Navarro on one of the tracks
off of The Suicide Machines' latest self
titled release, their third full length since
forming up in 1996. Hailing from Detroit,
Michigan, the quartet remains on Holly
wood Records, the label that put out their
first two records, but longtime fans may
notice a distinctly different sound this time
around. While their style changed from
horn-heavy ska-punk on their debut album
to a more hardcore sound on their last
album, the band's newest material is unde
niably poppy and more melodic than any
of the previous releases, a change the band
is not afraid to admit.
"We've been evolving since the begin
ning," guitarist Dan Lukacinsky says.
"Shock value is important to keeping your
creativity."
Perhaps this is true, but it's almost hard
to recognize the new Suicide Machines
songs, which are a long way from the gut
ter-punk sound that landed them on the
then-fledgling Warped Tour a few sum
mers back. Nor is it difficult to understand
why Guitar Magazine has labeled them
"the new Blink 182." Their first single off
the new album "Sometimes I Don't Mind,"
apart from receiving significant radio air
play, has the mainstream pop-friendly
sound that catapulted Blink 182 from a lit
tle-known So. Cal trio to an MTV craze.
Is similar success in the works for The
Suicide Machines? Time will tell. But their
new songs certainly have lots of appeal in
terms of catchy melodies and sing-along
choruses, mostly written in major keys to

sound happy and fun.
So what, then, is the
problem with this record?
The timing. A change of
sound to fit just what hap
pens to be popular at this
very moment seems a lit
tle too convenient. "The
Suicide Machines" is a
good record, but not a
great one; its songs do
have a certain range,
expressing sentiments
from the expletive-laced
proclamations of "I Hate
Everything" to ballad-like
slow tempo compositions
like "The Fade Away."
Others, such as the irre
sistible punk anthem
"Green" and the super
produced "Perfect Day"
are your standard fare
punk tunes that are nice
to listen to but do not
offer any original sounds.
Admittedly, the band
has used each album they

have released to seek out different sounds
and styles, which demonstrates a certain
goal-oriented focus in terms of exploring
musical hori/ons.
But from a band that claims to "hate
everything" and who has

in the past been known
for singing politically
charged lyrical thrash, it
is strange to find the
majority of the ny w mate
rial with happy-go-lucky
words to match the

"The Suicide
Machines"
The Suicide

slowed-down pop feel of a record whose
production level seems much more promi
nent than in any of their past efforts.
Try to check out The Suicide Machines as
they open for No Doubt at a sold out show
on April 15 at the Warfield, but be pre-

pareu to get a strong
dose of listener-friend
ly pop from a band
whose name implies a
harder-edged inter
pretation of the genre.
