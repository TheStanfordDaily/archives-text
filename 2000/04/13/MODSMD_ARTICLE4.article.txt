# Slates establish formal alliances similar to political parties in effort to unify campaign platforms
## 
### EILEEN CHAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the first time in several years, formal al
liances similar to political parties have formed be
hind each presidential candidate and his running
mate.
Juniors Ben Liu and Mike Dudas formed "Stu
dents First'' while juniors Seth Newton and Malia
Villegas established the "Platform for Account
ability and Change."
The candidates stress that these groups are not
political parties, but "groups of like-minded stu
dents'' who have come together to support each
slate's cause, according to Liu.
"Neither candidate has expressed an interest
in wanting to make the ASSU a
partisan body," said ASSU Presi
dent Mike Levin, a junior. "PAC
has said that once the elections are
over, the vision will remain, but
the partisan behavior will dissolve.
From speaking to Ben, I know that
the last thing he wants to do is have
the ASSU divided by political par
ties next year."
With their alliances, candidates
can locus on the issues which are
most important to students, ac
cording to I.in. lie said the main
purpose in establishing Students
First was to push significant issues
into the spotlight of the election.
"Ideally, we want to ensure that
we have a strong issue-based cam
paign," Liu said "We really want to
promote issues important to stu
dents and make progress on
things that need a united student
In >dy."
PAC. was formed three months
ago in response to "common senti
ment in numerous communities,"
according to Newton.
"The platform [brings] many
different communities together in
a dialogue to address common
concerns with the ASSU and the
University," Newton said.
The two groups formed by the
presidential slates reveal a di
chotomy of ideas between the op
ponents. Students l-irst is ft>cused
oil the Stanford community, stu
dent life and student groups.
" Flic idea is that it's time lor the
University to start thinking of stu
dents and student life as a priori
ty," Lin said. "[lt's about J putting

students first in every sense of the
word."
PAC, on the other hand, Hocus
es more on student voice, diversity
and students' social responsibility.
"[Principles of the platform in
clude] increasing the power of stu
dent voice in decision making, ac
tively promoting diversity and
being a voice against discrimina
tion," Newton said.
The differences between the
two alliances are also shown by the
backgrounds of the students in
each group. Besides the presiden
tial slate, Students First consists of
many current senators and senate
associates as well as new candi
dates, according to Liu.
"We want to work with people
who think the way we do and also
represent the student body," Liu
said. "Many of Our members have
experience with the ASSU, and we
really hope to continue this year's
productivity in the senate."
PAC! is composed of seven new
candidates running for senate, as
well as the presidential slate. These
students are "leaders with princi
ples and purpose [and] broad ex
perience in student groups" who
promise "something more" than
politics-as-usual, according to the
PAC Web site.
This isn't the first time presi
dential candidates have run on
ideological platforms. According
to Liu, there have been kinds of
political parties in the past, but
they had somewhat "died off."
Levin created a similar alliance
when he ran for president last
year, but it was not as formal as
Students First or PAC.
"[ASSU Vice President] John
Mills and 1 were humbled by the
broad support we received, and

we did have a core group that
shared our ideology," Levin said.
"However, we didn't take the step
of naming the group as a collective
whole, as Ben and Seth have
done."
I,iu said he believes the rise of
Students First and PAC empha
sizes the differences between the
two presidential slates.
"I think both sides have differ
ent views of how the ASSU should
deal with the student body," Liu
said. "It would be interesting to see
how the student body will re
spond."
Newton said he feels that this
disparity would benefit the voters.
"Our platform should have a
significant impact on the elections
because we have introduced a col
lective effort and vision that is sig
nificantly different than opposi
tion candidates," Newton said.
"Attentive students will see drastic
differences in approach to the
ASSU and representing the stu
dent voice at Stanford."
These differences, however
may also deter people 112 rom stand
ing firm on either side, according
to Newton.
"The only potential disadvan
tage is that it might alienate people
who might support the vision, but
who don't want to be seen taking
sides," Newton said.
Levin said he feels the alliances
bring more competition to the
election and encourage discussion
of ideas.
"Forming an alliance of sup
porters is very beneficial in a com
petitive race like the one we have
right now," Levin said. "I look for
ward to a competitive election
where ideas flourish and both can
didates remain positive."
