# Hits run out on Beach Boys' latest

### STEVEN RAPHAEL STAFF WRITER 
Best known for their rich, unique harmonies and happy-go
lucky, fun-in-the-sun songs, The Beach Boys have carved out a
special niche tor themselves in music history. Although they
have not been as prominent in recent years (aside from the 1988
hit "Kokomo," they haven't had a top-ten song in nearly 30

years), there's likely not a single American alive
who doesn't know the words and feel com
pelled to sing along whenever a Beach Boys
song comes on the radio.
Within the last few months, there has been a
resurgence of mainstream interest in the
group. In addition to a TV movie telling their
story, Capitol Records has just released a third
volume of Beach Boys' greatest hits. Entitled
"The Best of the Brother Years," the album
presents the music of the group from 1970-
1986. During this time, they had just left Capi
tol Records and were recording on their own
label in conjunction with Warner Brothers
Records.

The period covered by this collection was
after the commercial peak of the group. Since volumes one and
two have already laid claim to those songs which captured Amer
ica's hearts and ears, including "Surfin' USA," 'California C.irls,"
and "Good Vibrations," to make volume three Capitol was
forced to dip into smaller hits and popular B-sides. Since much
of the appeal of the Beach Boys comes from the recogni/ability
of their songs, this collection of lesser-known times seems to

drag In the end of the album.
Some of the songs on volume three hint at the same formula
of those classic megabits fiom volumes one and two. "It's ()kav"
is an upbeat, catchy number, reminiscent of "I Get Around,"
with harmonized counter-melodies flanking the charging lead
vocal. "Good 1 imin'" is a slightly slower number which still
manages to call images of California to mind.
Yet, on others, the group is almost unrecognizable. " 'Til I Die"

is a melancholy Brian Wilson tune depict
ing I lis growing depression and confusion
with lile, the first "downer" released by
the group. If you didn't know better, you
might be led to believe that other songs,
such as "Surf's l p," were recorded b\
Crosby, Stills, and Nash, another group
legendary for their harmonies. On vari
ous other songs, the group sounds like the
Beatles or the Byrds.
Although the music on "Best of the
Brother Years" may not be the radio c las
sics typically associated with the Beach
Boys, it does showcase a whole new
dimension of the group to people who

on I y
know them from their
biggest hits, li may not
make you want to run to the
beach, but the music is still
great and the amazing har
monies are as sweet and rich
as ever.
