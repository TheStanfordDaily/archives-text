# Shades of the Dead color 'Tracking'

### STEVEN RAPHAEL STAFF WRITER 
In this musical era, with so
many carbon-copies of legendary
bands posing as new develop
ment, the first thing that musi
cians in any genre must declare is
that they don't sound like the pio
neers of their genre. For bands
like The Big Wu, that means
claiming not to sound like Ihe
Grateful Dead. No exception to
the rule, The Big Wu bluntly give
the requisite declaration of
uniqueness in their press release.
Yet, on their debut album,
"Tracking Buffalo Through the
Bathtub," the strong influence of
jerry Garcia's playing on lead
guitarist Chris Castino cannot be

denied. Castillo's phrasing and lyric al
ly flowing lines call Garcia's celebrated
guitar work to mind. Those same pull
ofl's and backtracking, meandering
melodies that defined the Dead for so
many years find their way into this
group's repertoire as well. So, while it
is true that The Big Wu do not sound
like, the Grateful Dead per se, at times
they do sound like they could be a
Garcia side project.
Yet, it would be a disservice to the
album and the band to pigeon-hole

them as such. With "Tracking Buffa
lo," I he Big Wu has produced a fine
album which shows them to be a band
with great skill and creativity and
strong songwriting chops. No empty
vehicles to serve

as excuses for
soloing, 1 he Big
Wu's songs are
concise, catchy
numbers with
memorable cho
ruses and catchy

guitar melodies.
A variety of influences are evi
dent in the group's music. Songs
like "Silcanturnitova" draw from
modern psuedo-hip-hop rhythms
and vocal styles — Beck meets
Sugar Ray, with Garc ia on guitar.
The melody of "Kangaroo"
sounds Caribbean, and the vocals
almost achieve a reggae feel.
While on "Bloodhound," the
group is acoustic and country
twinged, on "Gimme a Raise,"
the) play relatively hard hitting
rock.
"Gimme a Raise," however, is
one of the best examples of the
poor lytic writing ability of the
band. Lines like "Boss better give
me a raise/Give me a two week
holiday" are not ludicrous enough

to fall under the I'hish category of
silly-fun; rather, they are just stupid
enough to sound like Weird Al may
have penned them. Fortunately, the
liig Wu's Hair for vocal melody often
means that a listener

who isn't paying
attention won't notice
the idiocy of the
words. Of course, he
also might not notice
that it's not Jerry Gar
cia playing that guitar.
