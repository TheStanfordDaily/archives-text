# Clash reissues bring conflict back to rock
## 
### ANDREW CURRY EDITORIAL STAFF 
It's been said that the quality of music is directly related to the state of
the economy. Recessions and social unrest seem to drive creative types to
new heights (or depressed, introspective lows, which can be just as artisti
cally valuable) while economic boom times rarely produce anything of last
ing value. Those of us who grew up at the tail end of Generation X remem
ber the wealth of political, anti-corporate anger that dominated the air
waves during the recession of the late 'KOs — brooding bands like Nirvana
and Pearl Jam captivated youth the way sunny, vapid pop enchants kids in
the relentlessly optimistic economic boom we're seeing today.
It's a familiar pattern, and one band did much to make it that way. The
Clash, once tagged by corporate flacks as "the only band that matters,'"
were one of the most successful bands to never give up their principles, a
less serious (and less pretentious) precursor of today's handful of loud,
angry politically aware bands like Rage Against the Machine.
The British band first hit the U.S. in the spiritual low of the post-Vietnam
mid-19705, when the nation was still coming to terms with the realization
that the hippies had all sold cut and were never going back to Woodstock.
Stemming from the same met-in-art-school tradition as the Beatles, they
were angry and loud. And unlike many of their British punk contempo
raries (e.g., the Sex Pistols) they knew how to play their instruments really,
really well.
Perhaps in response to the pathetic musical void that is rock today, the
band recently reissued its eight-album catalog. From their 1977 debut, the
gritty, screaming punk of "The Clash" ("White Riot," "London's Burning")
to tunes that stand today as crucial tracks on any '80s soundtrack ("Should

I Stay or Should I Go," "Rock
the Casbah") the band's histo
ry reflects both a willingness to
experiment and a refusal to
compromise.
Everything about the band
screams conflict. "I was read
ing the newspaper and the
only word that seemed to have
some meaning was 'clash'; a
clash between police and riot
ers or a musical clash or what
ever," bassist Paul Simonon
explains on "Rockers Galore,"
a collection of singles and
interview tracks that is being
given away free with the pur
chase of any two reissued
Clash albums.
Through their brief career —
the band basically split up
after hitting the top of the
charts with "Rock the Cas
bah" in 1982 — they pushed
the political envelope while
still speaking to a mass audi
ence. Even two decades later,
the messages of manv of their

songs still seem fresh. The
early albums are great examples of how punk can be both music and mes
sage, and after their initial success they went on to play with styles as
diverse as funk, reggae and even hip-hop.
Their move from punk to reggae-influenced dub was especially success
ful. producing the classic "London Calling" album in 1979. "London Call
ing" sprawls over a number of diverse styles, and the band's musical talent
mixes with a powerful anti-police message to create hard-hitting songs like
"Guns of Brixton," with its unforgettable chorus: "When they kick out your
front door / how you gonna come? / With your hands on your head / or on
the trigger of your gun?" If not for their heavy working-class British
accents, they could be mistaken for Public Enemy.
If you don't own at least "London Calling," your music collection has a
huge hole. If you're a big fan, go buy two of the reissues and you'll score
"Rockers Galore." Otherwise, go get at least a taste of 1970s anger and
activism that modern bands would do well to imitate.
