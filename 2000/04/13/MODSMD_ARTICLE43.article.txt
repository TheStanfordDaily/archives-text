# Yanni album's great — for your parents

II I had decided to start a career as
;i New Age musician, 1 think I would
have avoided choosing a name that
sounds like "yawning" - for obvious
reasons. Ihe name Yanni has long
been synonymous with lush, mellow,
synthetically driven ballads; the sort
of thing my dad would play to relax;
elevator music.
While there are quite a few songs on
Yanni's two disc album, "Dreaming of
You," that fit this stereotype, the
album occasionally surprised me by
breaking from this mold. It opens
with "Desire," an Arabic sounding
piece that could almost have been

recorded by the
group Dead Clan
Dance. Following
this, Dance With a
Stranger" is a trum
pet led fusion-style
song that is vaguely
reminiscent of late
Miles Davis.

of You: A 2-Disc

Yet this isn't to say that the resem
blance between Yanni and Mu/ak is
gone. Songs like "Dreaming of You"
would not he out of place in an eleva
tor. The lilting piano melody is sup
ported by thick synth, resulting in an
overall dreamv efled. Due to songs
like this. Yanni's music is useful for a

pleasant background; it would sound
pet feet as the accompaniment to a
movie. Without effort, it actually calls
to mind a gallant hero smoothly gal
loping across rolling green hills and
down into a lush meadow where he
will meet his love. As the songs
progress, "Dreaming of You" could
easily be the orchestration of an epic
love story.
If nothing else, with the pro
grammed drum beats and synthetic
instruments, "Dreaming of You" is an
impressive demonstration of how far
synth has come. If I didn't know bet
ter from his liner notes, which credit
only Yanni on keyboards and occa
sionally a percussionist, I might have
thought some of the instruments were
real.

Net, unless you
have musical taste
I ike in v dad, sitting
down with the sole
intent to listen to
Yanni is probably not
a good idea. Maybe
it's the tone, maybe

the lark of development within songs,
maybe the similarity across songs, but
regardless, I found my attention
quickly wandering elsewhere. Yanni
truly is a master at creating New Age
mood music, perfect for relaxation
but nearly worthless for strict music
appreciation.
