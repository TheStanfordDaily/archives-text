# San Jose's 'Swan Lake' just barely adequate
## 
### LAUREN RUSSELL EDITORIAL STAFF 
"Swan Lake" is difficult to pull oil well, pari-,
ly because it is one of the most beautiful and
famous ballets of all time. It holds itself to high
performance standards because it has been
recreated for over 100 years, ever since its first
performance in 1N95. It is worth seeing the
San |ose Cleveland Ballet's version, despite tlie
fact that their performance does not come near
raising the bar from past performances.
I he San Jose Cleveland Ballet's version of
"Swan Lake" would be a mediocre perfor
mance were it not for Karen Gabay, who
dances as Odette, the Queen Swan. The per
formance, which lasts three hours and includes
three intermissions, has a fairly strong cast of
dancers, but the costumes and set design for
many of the scenes are dull and difficult to fol
low.
I he set design in the forest is particularly
notable and contrasts significantly in quality
with the set design within the court scenes. The
mood is set bv a thick fog, lighting that effec-

tively mimics moonlight, and
an elaborate entanglement of
wildly growing tree blanches.
The dancing in these scenes
shares the contrast with the
court scenes. The court scene
dancers are annoying (espe
cially the far-100-peppy jester,

who makes a noticeable amount of mistakes
because of his overzealous dancing). The cos
tumes in these scenes are tasteless, with colors
that clash horrendously and attract way too
much attention.
The famous swan dances are pulled off beau
tifully, however, and Gabay truly makes the
show with her exquisitely expressive body. II
you go to the show, go to see her. I he amount
that a person can communicate with small
movements like the curve <>l their hand and
the arch of their neck is incredible, and Gabay,
who has been performing with this company
since 1080, uses subtle expression to its fullest.
The music in the show is also one of its high
lights, and Tchaikovsky's famous score is
another reason to go to the show. Just as the
body can tell the tragically romantic story of
Queen Odette and I'rince Siegfried, the music
does the other half Of the job in ballet, and con
ductor Pamela Martin commands a talented
group of musicians.
Although it is definitely not the best perfb
mance of "Swan Lake" ever pulled off, the San
Jose Cleveland Ballet is certainly worth seeing,

especially if you have never
seen "Swan Lake." You will
fall in love with the sad tale
and the beauty of Gabay's
expressive dance style. The
show only plays until Satur
day, so pick up your tickets
soon.
