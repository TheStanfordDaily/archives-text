# College portals mostly open onto nothing
## 
### 
From the world of online textbooks,
Nothing but 'Net is now going to make a

smooth segue into college portal sites.
Like the world of online book buying,

the college portal scene is close to being
a complete waste of time. But then
again, this is a guide to procrastina
tion, which is defined by its lack of
productivity, and so we must forge
ahead.

www.collegeclub.com is in the
midst of a vicious mousepad advertis
ing push (check your cluster), and so
deserved at least a cursory look. What
I found turned out to be a typical
college portal. Collegeclub looks
like a wannabe Yahoo — a search

box across the top and "featured
links" littering the rest of the page.
Mainstays on the college portal
scene are auctions of some kind,
news links, social links and educa
tional links.

Collegeclub has working auc
tions that aren't eliay's, and so
scored some points for professional
ism. Also setting the site apart from its
peers were the articles on campus
drugs. I enjoyed reading about
MDMA, as well as student reactions.

CrazygrlOO? felt she had to share her
attitude on ecstasy: "It's great!"
www.college4ll.com is the same
approach, but produced by Stanford grad-

nates, which of course means ii is above and beyond. Kid
ding aside, College4ll is a CollegeClub with an even more
social twist. The site features a Drink of the Day, as well as an
"Around Town" section directed at your zip code that
includes movie times.
The special Stanford links include Telnet, KZSU, The

Stanford Daily, and the Official Athletic site of the Cardi
nal. Appreciated was the section of links labeled "Stop-out,"
which included links to travel agencies and overseas infor
mation. A college portal site should also cater to those that
have had enough.
Another Stanford production, www.steamtunnels.coin,
received some flak last year for attempting to make an online

facebook. The site has mellowed some in its rele
gation to a magazine / portal site for the college
student.
Like College4ll, the site includes links spe
cific to our beloved Farm. Unlike College4ll, the
articles smack of magazine writing and cover
Melinda "My Husband Could Buy Yours" Gates
and Boyd Rice this month.
The only site that actually offered any useful
information was www.pinkmonkey.com. 1 wish
this site had been around during my bout with
CIV - not only does it boast on-line "Mon
key Notes" as well as full on-line textbooks, it
does so for free.
No kidding, freshmen - you can get notes
on books from "Absalom, Absalom" to "Wuther
ing Heights," and you can do so the night
before that paper is due. Another awe-inspiring
discovery was that I could get a full online copy
of the NAFTA agreement with minimal effort
on my part. Now if I only needed that for any of
my classes. . .
Honorable mentions go out to
www.uwire.com and www.college.net. Uwire is
strictly news oriented, but functions well as a col
lege-level AP wire service of sorts.
If you want to read student news from other
campuses, this site is your best bet. If you are still
searching for scholarships, College.net is what
you need. Otherwise, the site is definitely aimed at
incoming freshmen or even juniors in high school.
www.4thestudents.com is an example of a

badly done portal - none of the auctions include any
items, the carpool matcher almost always returns zero
drivers, and the roommate matcher is also dysfunctional.
If you're in the market for a 112 ull-text NAFTA agreement,
there is a home for you in the cold Cyberworld. If you are
solidly hooked up to the Internet intravenous drip, you may
want to visit a college portal for your information. For the
rest of us, my advice is to stay away from the portals.
