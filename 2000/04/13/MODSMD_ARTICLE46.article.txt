Ever see the "Mad About
You" episode with the women
who got off on the washing
machine? A woman would
walk, into the laundry room,
the door swung closed and
locked behind her, and she
was stuck. Since there weren't
any chairs, each one sat down
on the washer to wait for
someone to let her out. The
washing machine was vibrat
ing, of course, so after she sat
down, she got a funny kind of
look in her eyes and you
could tell she was enjoying the
experience a little more than
she expected.
1 think if a man happened
to let that woman out, he
probably got a little surprise!
Guess what, ladies? There's
something real about our

attraction to vibrating objects, be they
washing machines, dishwashers, vacuum
cleaners . . . lawn mowers . . .
Okay, so most of us just stick to the tra
ditional vibrator. But certainly couples can
enjoy rhythmic and vibrating stimuli
together during sex as well . . . such as, for
instance, on a washing machine. Ladies,
it's time for some fun.
The Vibrator
Over the past several decades, hand
held vibrators and dildos (from the Italian
word diletto, "pleasure") have become
much more popular. Half of women who
masturbate have tried a vibrator at least
once. In fact, for some women, vibrators
are necessary for sexual satisfaction. Most
women who use them simply see vibrators
as an effective and harmless device to
intensify erotic pleasure. Of course some
men feel threatened by vibrators.
Really, honey, we don't expect you to be
able to compete with a machine, we're just
enjoying ourselves — Miss Sass thinks she
deserves a little extra pleasure to make up
for all the orgasms men are guaranteed.
Vibrators are certainly a little less
romantic than the real thing, but they can
still be fun. Especially with so many vari
eties to choose from. Vibrators tend to be
priced anywhere from about $10 to almost
$80, and yoti get your choice of colors,
shapes — and sizes.

Some of them are waterproof, so you
can use them in the shower. Others have
design features to increase your pleasure.
For instance, several are shaped exactly
like a penis. Others have nubs or curves
that stimulate the G-spot effectively. The
more expensive vibrators may include
devices that rub the clitoris — such as Miss
Sass's favorite, the pink rabbit ears on the
Rabbit Pearl.
If it's your first time, you probably feel a
little nervous about sticking a random
piece of plastic inside your body. But
please, Miss Sass urges you to just lay back,
spread out, insert and enjoy. The sensa
tion will probably feel a little strange at
first, but you'll get used to it. Pretty soon,
the sound of your orgasms will overpower
the annoying hum of the vibrator.
The Washing Machine
Rhythmic motion is often arousing,
even if the instance when the motion is felt
is not an erotic moment. Waterbeds and
hammocks, with their gentle rocking
motion, may be pleasurable during sex.
Speeding trains, rolling ships and boats
are highly recommended for lovemaking.
But driving and sex (just in case you were
thinking about trying) cannot be safely
combined.
Transport animals like horses, camels
and elephants have all been used to
increase erotic pleasure. Eastern erotic

shows display couples bal
ancing upside down on gal
loping ponies.
In case you don't have any
elephants in your dorm
room and no time in your
schedule for a class on circus
tricks, Miss Sass recom
mends a washing machine
for safe yet outlandish sexu
al forays.

Ladies, you'll find that as
you slide onto the smooth
gyrating surface, a rhythmic
warmth will fill the backs of
your thighs and upward.
You'll probably notice that
this warmth closely resem
bles the warmth you feel
when your body heads in the
direction of an orgasm.
Miss Sass isn't implying

that sitting on the washing
machine alone will do it for you. For some
women it will; for most it will simply be
reminiscent of something that does do it
for them. Basically, you can "trick" your
body into thinking it might be excited even
before the fun actually begins . . . and
honey, that's guaranteed to make the fun
that much more fun.
So stay up late one night and hope that
no one has a late-night craving lot clean
clothes — then close the door behind you
and try it.
Miss Sass recommends one of two posi
tions with the woman on the washing
machine. If you've got lots of leg and arm
space, a traditional missionary position
would certainly work.
However, Miss Sass prefers a position
that allows the ladies to get the most enjoy
ment out of their perch. She should sit on
the edge or even corner of the washer,
holding her legs in whatever position she
wishes (and moving them to experiment
throughout). He needs to find a stable
stool or bench to stand on, unless his waist
is much higher than the top of the washing
machine. Standing up, he can thrust while
she enjoys the good vibrations.
Finally "I'd like to see you in the laun
dry room, baby" can be used as a compli
ment rather than a sexist insult.
