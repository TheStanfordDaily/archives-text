# New scholarship guide is mostly confused lists

### MONYA DE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At ( .M)7 pages, "The Scholarship
Advisor," the newest publication
from The Princeton Review, is a lit
tle imposing. Its size seems to
promise a wealth of scholarship
resources guaranteed to obliterate
debt and put a student in the black,
lint, on closer examination, this
scholarship finder offers little of use
to a high school student, much less a
Stanford student.
The Advisor is written by Chris
Vuturo, a high sch<x)l teacher who
qualified for over $800,000 in schol
arships when he applied to
college. Vuturo has attempted to
write in the snappy, witty voice of
such indispensable Princeton
Review books as "Cracking the
SAT," but falls short. His examples
clarify well, but the lxn>k doesn't
have the user-friendliness of the rest
of the books in The Princeton
Review's library. He can't seem to
decide on a happy medium between
glossing over topics and going
through them in excruciating detail.
For instance, a mention of the Free
Application for Federal Student Aid
is left unexplained, but is followed by
a drawn-out lecture on compound
loan interest and why money you
don't have to pay back is a good
thing.
The lx>ok is geared to high school
students, because the number of
funding sources for high school stu
dents is exponentially larger than
for any other population. Still, The
Scholarship Advisor contains every
thing from college scholarships to
graduate fellowships to postdoctoral
fellowships. While an admirable
effort at one-stop scholarship search
ing, this is also a symptom of the too
wide scope of this lx>ok.
Although mitigated by helpful
search indexes organized by scholar
ship qualification (major, career
path, ethnicity, pastime), the size of
this Ikx)k stems from one thing.
Vuturo realized that, if you list even
scholarship offered by every school
in the country, you're Ixnind to end
up with a lot of pages. The vast
majority of the scholarships are
unexciting, college-spe-

cific entries thai specify

seriousness. ,
■ They serve as mere padding and a
source of frustration for anyone try
ing to find scholarships for which lie
or she is likely to be eligible.
Just to make sure I wasn't judging
the lxw)k too harshly, I spent some
time looking up scholarships for a
student like myself, as well as specif
ic, well-known scholarships I
applied for in high school. The
results were disappointing. There
was no mention of the Target, Ser
vice Merchandise, HOPE or Ray
kroc scholarships. Most appalling,
the book gave no indication that a
student from any state could win a
National Merit Scholarship or a
Robert C. Byrd Scholarship.
Only a few of the state or college
National Merit or Byrd programs
were listed, instead of the umbrella
programs that ensure aid will be
available for every state.
As for scholarships matching my
interests, once I classified myself as a
pharmacy student I found some
biology-related possibilities.
"The Scholarship Advisor" does
have some redeeming qualities. The
essay and interview tips are excellent
and universally applicable, even for
college students. There is a wealth of
scholarship information for some
categories, such as journalism. But
what it does l)est is elucidate the real
need in scholarship searches; an
easy-to-use-, browse-friendly listing
of scholarships with low eligibility
barriers that one wouldn't overlook
just because they were not listed
under a specific major.
With the proliferation of corporate
websites, many companies are hold
ing regular online essay contests and
the like. Cataloging these in a mean
ingful way would give a student a
much better chance at some free
cash.
The continuous references to
"other suggested reading" — name
ly, other TPR publications— makes
the lxx>k come across as some sort of
Princeton Review advertising pam
phlet. Unfortunately, it's an incom
plete pamphlet with a lot of data
that, by definition, is useless to 999?
of the students who open the Ik k »k.
Hopefully lor next year's students,
TPR will

come up
with a lx't

book.
