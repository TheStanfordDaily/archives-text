spec ial fee vote can be make-or-break in terms
of programming for the coming year.
Junior Joey Pritikin, the public relations
director for the Stanford Band, said that the
ASSU spec ial lees are "vital to our existence.''
Pritikin said, "[This is] an important time,
but we advertise for ourselves all year long. By
the time elections start, students shouldn't
need lliers to know they should
vote lor us."

students must vote for the
group's fee.
Concerning the special fees
election, sophomore Tom Liu,
Appropriations Committee co
chair, said, "Students should
look .it each item — they're real
ly approving things themselves."
According to Liu, any group
can apply lor special fees. I his
year's jiew groups on the ballot
include the Graduate Women's
Network and a re
cently-formed group whose pur
pose is "to promote Klectronica
music on campus and to support
Stanford I)| s and artists."
Not all groups who receive
ASSI funding must apply for
ihcil own special fee. The ASSL
also maintains a general fund
used to support groups and
events throughout the year. 1 lu
pin pose for this money is to sup

port events thai "benefit all stu
dents" according to Liu. I his
fund is part of the ASSI' budget,
and must also be approved in
the upcoming elections.
The process for obtaining
general fees was revamped this
year. It is now a rolling process,
where groups submit proposals
to the ASSI lor funding to sup
pott individual events for stu
dents.
Liu said this is a big improve
ment, as the Appropriations
(lommittee "is now able to deter
mine which [applicants] are
most valuable." In the past, all
proposals for eat h quarter were
submitted at the same time,
making it difficult for the Appro
priations Committee to distrib
ute funds well.
Recipients of the general fees
are divided into two main cate
gories: community service and
programming. Last year, the
ASSI approved funding for

groups such as ('in le k and Ip
wartl Bound in the community
service category. Money also
went to campus programming
events, including the recent Art
Affair.
I'lie ASSI also helps to bring
speakers to campus, such as
those who participated in Islam
Awareness Week.
Students who don't wish to
support a particular group can
request a refund of that group's
fee through the ASSL Web site.
Refunds must be requested for
specific organizations; a general
refund of the ASSL fees is not
possible.
Liu cautioned that students
who request a refund of a
group's fee are giving up their
right to part it ipate in t hat
group's at ti\ ities.
