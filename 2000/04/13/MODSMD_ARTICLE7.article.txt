# Reserve funds aid students in need

### SCOTT DORFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When Stanford students find themselves in a bind,
most turn to friends or family for help.
However, in certain situations such help ma) not
he readily available, which is why the I niversih li;is
established two separate emergency funds as "safety
net[s]" of last resort for students in need of assistance.
1 he fust of these emergency funds was established
about si\ years ago through the Dean of Students ()f
-fice. The fund provides money to students "for emei -
gency purposes," subject to very specific contingen
cies, said Dean of Students Mat e Wais.
" I lie emergency money tends to be used bv stu
dents who face serious financial constraints and need
immediate help," Wais said. "An example would be it
there is a death in the- family or a medical emergency
for a loved one, and someone needs airfare from San
Francisco to Florida, we would be there for the stu
dent. We do our best to provide a safety net.
Wais stressed the fact that the emergency fund is
far from a source of free money for students.
"The student must meet first with a I'niversity of
ficer, and sometimes we ask fin documentation," said
Wais. "'l'lie overwhelming majority of money is given
as a loan which must be repaid by students. Fvery
once in a while, money is given .is a grant for very ex
ceptional or compelling cases."
I lie second emergency fund will go into effect at

the beginning of Tall quarter. Initiated by and run
through the Parking and fransporation Office, the
fund will cover emcrgeticv taxicab rides for freshmen
stranded in Palo Alto and surrounding areas.
Although the details of the program have not vet
been finalized, the idea has received support from
Wais and Vice Provost for Student Affairs James
Mont ova, according to Susan 1 .aw, parking and tran
sit coordinator at the Parking and I ran spoliation ()l
fice.
I he fund will first be open only to freshmen, in re
sponse to the decision not to allow freshmen to have
cars on campus beginning next year.
"Wecame up with the idea for the fund less than a
month ago, and we are still working out mam of the
specifics of how it will work," l.aw said. "We will like
1\ work with one cab companv, and freshmen will
have to sign up lor the program. I hex will get a busi
ness card with the name of the cab conipam. and in
the event of an emergencv the\ can pull out the card
and call the company for a ride home."
Like Wais, Law stressed that the fund will be for
emergencies only and subject to spec ific constraints.
"We want this truly to be an emergeno ride pro
gram. We do not want tins to be a substitute for not
getting a shuttle lor Thanksgiving," said Law.
Law specified that cab rides would likely only be
available to each student once per quarter, and would
