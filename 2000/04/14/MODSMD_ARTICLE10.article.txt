# Car plan inconvenient, frosh say
## 
### BEN ALEXANDER-BLOCH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When the new freshman car policy is instituted next
year, current students worry that freshmen will have
even fewer s<xial options than they do now.
In a policy spelled out last Friday, the Offices of Park
ing and Transportation Services and Student Affairs
announced that no on-campus parking permits would
be issued to freshmen, stalling next year.
This year's freshmen acknowledge the severity of the
situation, even though they realize that no cars for next
year's freshmen will mean more parking for next year's
sophomores.
"Upper-class guys will sadly be forced to drive now
helpless, naive freshman girls around the Bay Area,"
joked freshman Erik Wong.
Freshmen joke about the situation, but finally they
also see serious repercussions.
"I understand that parking is scarce, but for those
freshmen who want to take a break from campus life
and experience something else, then cars can give them
a certain freedom," said freshman Chris Diedrich, who
is currently running for sophomore class president.
"I am glad that the ASSU and administration are ex
tending the Marguerite's routes, creating an on-cam
pus car rental program and a discounted gnxery deliv
ery service, but these alternative programs still will not
provide a car's versatility," Diedrich added.
These programs will operate on a trial basis this
spring.
The new car policy was developed because Sum
ford's General Use Permit puts strict limits on the
square fix)tage of new buildings, parking spaces and
traffic going on and off campus.
According to the freshman parking policy, some ex
ceptions will be offered for "students who can demon
strate a compelling need or who would suffer undue
hardship under this policy [WJaivers will be re
viewed by a committee, and will Ix kept to an absolute

minimum."
"I think freshmen should have cars, especially il they
live close to home, because on the weekends 1 like to go
home and relax and without a car I would n< )t Ix 1 able to
do this," freshman Julie Gonzalez said.
Troy Gilbert, assistant to the vice provost for stu
dent affairs, explained that a committee to review ex
ceptions and grant waivers will be formed latei this
year. Members of the committee will be drawn from
staff of the Offices of Student Affairs and Transporta
tion Services.
The ASSU Nomination Committee will also select
some students to sit on the committee, Gilbert added.
"The new car plan is going to put a lot more pressure
on RAs and the few freshman who fall into the excep
tion, but if it forces the administration to improve l<xal
transportation and/or campus facilities such as the stu
dent union. A lot of positive things can come out of it,
said junior Michal Pasternak, a resident assistant in Rin
conada.
She added that upper-class residents in four-class
dorms will also have to deal with many more "car
thirsty" freshman.
"Asanecon major I predict an active black-market in
parking permits," said junior Will 1 lartwell.
The prospective freshmen on campus seem to have
mixed feelings about the car plan.
"Although the new policy will inconvenience incom
ing freshman, the new students will soon learn to adapt.
The presence of rental cars and the increase in shuttle
servicing will make the transition easier, and while it will
take planning to organize trips and run errands, the
new plan shouldn't cause any serious problems, said
Mark McLaughlin, a prospective freshman.
Oscar Brook, another prospective freshman, agreed
that the news policy would not be a huge inconve
nience. "As long as we can go everywhere everybody
else can then we just have something to l<xÂ»k forward to
sophomore year. We can also always rent goll carts, or
suck up to the upperclassmen."
