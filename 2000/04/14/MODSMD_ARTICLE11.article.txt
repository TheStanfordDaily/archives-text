## As deadline passes, demonstrators proclaim victory 
### 
MIAMI (AP) — Thousands of demonstrators dog
ging the humid, narrow streets in Klian Gonzalez's
neighborhood yesterday pumped their lists and
shouted "Victory!" when it became clear the govern
ment would not immediately reunite the boy with his
father.
"Our miracle happened!" Mercedes Franco shout
ed while raising her hands in the air. " That boy is a
miracle. I feel like screaming everything."
The boy's great-uncle Gonzalez took a defi
ant stand against the government's 2 p.m. deadline
for handing the boy over, all but daring officials to
seize Elian from the small white home in Little
Havana.
Protesters surrounded the house in hopes of pi e
venting federal agents from going in. They took up
their usual place at the barricade in front the home
and also poured onto surrounding streets, blocking a
side entrance that they feared marshals would use for
a stealthy approach.
" These people aren't going to leave until some
body says the boy's going to stay," said Maggie Her
nandez, 22, a psychology student at the University of
Miami.
The crowd swelled throughout the day, as the
deadline came and went with the boy still in the
house. By late afternoon, there were as many as
4,000 protesters in the area — some on the roof a
nearby house. Police blocked off several streets.
People packed into the throng chanted "Free
dom!" and thrust their fists into the air. Dozens flew

Cuban and American flags; some brought Argentine
and Colombian flags in a pan-Hispanic show of unity.
"People here would rather die than for Elian to go
to Cuba. Me the first," said Ana Aguilar, 43, who
came to the United States from the communist island
26 years ago.
A plane flew overhead, trailing a banner that read:
"Liberty and Justice for Elian." Protesters propped
up an effigy of Fidel Castro wearing a bra, poked it in
the face and stomach with American flags and then
stomped on it and tore off its head.
Elian's 21-year-old cousin Marisleysis, who consid
ers herself a mother figure for him, walked along a
line of protesters, handing them cups of water. loiter,
Lazaro (ionzalez went along the line, shaking hands
like a politician at a campaign stop.
Elian, wearing baggy green shorts almost to his
ankles and a light green shirt, played in his backyard
and cheerfully chatted inside the house with his
cousin and great-uncle.
Five little girls who left school after lunch pressed
against a fence and held signs for Elian. Second-grad
er Lauren Alatriste, 7, said she didn't like hearing
people saying Elian is too young to decide whether
lie should live in Cuba.
"It's not like he's 3 years old and doesn't know
anything," Lauren said.
Actor Andy Garcia and singer Gloria Estefan, both
Cuban-Americans, pleaded for peace. "I know that
Cubans are very passionate, and we don't want any
one to confuse loud passion for violence," she said
