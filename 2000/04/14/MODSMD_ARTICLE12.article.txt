# Convention puts Clinton on edge

WASHINGTON (AP)
President Clinton heatedly said
yesterday "I'm not ashamed"
about being impeached and
"I'm not interested" in being
pardoned for any alleged
crimes in the Monica Lewinsky
scandal and Whitewater investi
gation.
But Clinton did not say
whether he would accept a par
don if it were offered by his suc -
cessor. Republicans immediate
ly pounced on his failure to
answer the question.
"The answer is I have no
interest in it. I wouldn't ask for
it. I don't think it would be nec
essary," the president told the
convention of the American
Society of Newspaper Editors.
"1 am prepared to stand before
any bar of justice I have to
stand before."
Clinton's appearance
brought forth his most emo
tional outpouring yet about the
impact of the sex-and-lies
Lewinsky case.
"I've paid quite a lot," he
said. "1 struggled very hard to
save my relationship with my
wife and tny daughter .... I
made a terrible mistake of
which I am deeply regretful.
But I think that the average,
ordinary person reviewing the
wreckage left in that would say
that 1 paid for that."
Clinton was obviously irritat
ed that the pardon and
impeachment issues arose in a
question-and-answer session
after he spoke to editors about
the Republicans' $1.83 trillion
budget. Me boasted about the
nation's booming economy and
criticized the COP budget as
"loaded with exploding tax
breaks and untenable cuts in
critical investment."
After his address, the first
question was whether Clinton
would request or accept a par
don. It was a subject Clinton
has never directly addressed,
although his former lawyer
Charles F.C. Ruff, told the
Mouse impeachment hearings
in 1998 that the president
would not pardon himself nor
accept a pardon. Vice President
Al Gore, in what his office said
was a reference to Ruffs com
ment, repeated that assertion in
an appearance before the edi
tors Wednesday.
Clinton remains under a

legal cloud despite being
acquitted of perjury and
obstruction of justice charges b\
the Senate last year after his
impeachment by the Mouse.
Independent Counsel Robert
Ray, who succeeded Kenneth
Stan in the investigation oj the
Whitewater and Lewinsky
cases, has said he has hired
additional prosecutors'atUt was
considering whether to indict
Clinton after he leaves office.
112 he president angrily called
the Whitewater investigation "a
lie and a fraud from the begin
ning" and railed that "no one
has written the full storv vet."
I le snapped at the audience, "1
can imagine win vou wouldn't,
particularly, given the way a lot
of this has been covered."
Clinton ended his answer
with a curt command: "Next
question." Me promptly was
asked if his presidential library
would have a wing to deal with
the impeachment saga of his
presidency.
"We'll have to deal with it,
it's an important part of it."
(llinton said. Hut he then said,
"I am proud of what we did
there because I think we saved
the Constitution of the I nited
States."
Me portrayed his impeach
ment battle as part of a struggle
against the Republican c rusade
that began with the COP
takeover of the Mouse in 1994
and led to the government
shutdown in 1995. "We beat
back the Contract on America
(the CO 1' agenda). 1 lien we
had to beat it in the impeach
ment issue," Clinton said.
"Then we had to beat it when I
vetoed the (OOP) tax cut last
year."
Clinton said voters rendered
their verdict when they re-elect
ed him in 1990 and boosted the
Democrats' strength in the
I louse in 1998.
"But as a political matter, you
have no idea â€” I'm not
ashamed of the fact that the)
impeached me," the president
said. "That was their decision,
not mine. And it was wrong.
"As a matter of law, the C
stitution and history, it was
wrong," Clinton continued.
"And I am glad I didn't quit and
I'm glad we fought it. And the
American people stuck with me,
and I am profoundly grateful."
