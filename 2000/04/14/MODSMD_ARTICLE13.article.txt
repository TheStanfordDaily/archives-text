JERUSALEM (AP) — Caught between a tra
ditional ally and a powerful new friend, Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak made ii clear yes
terday I hat Israel values Chinese market poten
tial too much to risk it by reneging on a defense
deal with (Ihina.
U.S. pressure on Israel to cancel the planned
sale of a surveillance plane to China has over
shadowed President Jiang Zemin's high-profile
visit here, the first by a Chinese president. The
speaker of the Israeli parliament criticized the
sale — just one in a long history of controversial
arms deals — and called on Israel to stop win
ning friends by selling them weapons.
The sensitivity' of' the issVie' was evident at a
Barak-Jiang news conference yesterday evening.
Barak twice intercepted questions about the deal
addressed to Jiang after the two leaders consult
ed at their podiums.
"We relate the highest importance to our
relationship with China and to our credibility,"
Barak said. 1 le added that Israel understood the
concerns raised bv the United States, whom he
referred to as "the main supporter of our
weapons system for our defense."

Barak said he and Jiang discussed the issue
during their 1 1/2-hour meeting. A statement
released by Barak's office quoted Jiang as saying
that he would not intervene in the Israeli-Amer
ican dialogue about the sale.
Israel has already signed a contract to pro
vide a plane to China equipped with a sophisti
cated Israeli-developed airborne surveillance
system known as PHALCON, which provides
capabilities similar to those of the U.S. AWACS
system. Israel TV said the contract obligates
Israel to provide China with three more planes
if China so chooses.
The deal could be worth $2 billion and comes
at a time when unemployment in Israel is high.
Israel Aircraft Industry Director Ceneral Moshe
Keret reiterated yesterday that Israel will not
cancel the sale.
Parliament speaker Avraham Burg, a senior
member of Barak's ruling Eabor party and a
Barak rival, criticized his government for forcing
Israel to choose between China and the United
States.
"It is wrong that Israel bases its relationship
with some of the regions of this world on arms

deals and arms trade. Israel cornered itself, and
Israel should take itself out of this corner," Burg
told reporters shortly after meeting with Jiang
yesterday.
Israel's defense industry, the country's
largest, exports close to HO percent of all of its
products.
Israel has a history of involvement in ques
tionable arms deals, including acting as a broker
for secret U.S. arms sales to Iran in the 1980s.
Questions also have been raised about Israel's
sale of arms to South Africa during the
apartheid era and to various tatin American
militias.
The United States is worried that Israeli
equipment could be used by China against U.S.-
backecl Taiwan. Canceling or even freezing the
deal, however, could ruin Israel's credibility with
China — not just on arms deals but also in high
tech and agricultural technology projects.
The stakes are high. Barak is under pressure
to fulfill campaign promises to improve
Israel's stagnating economy, and he sees in
China a huge market for Israeli know-how
and a powerful partner for Israeli businesses.
