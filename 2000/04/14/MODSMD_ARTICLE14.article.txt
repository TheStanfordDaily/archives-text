# Homeless left on street as shelters close

SAN DIEGO (AP) — Each
spring, San Diego, like other com
munities around the country, dos
es some of its wintertime homeless
shelters and turns hundreds of
people out onto the streets.
This year, though, the home
less may have a harder time than
ever finding a place to live. And
more mothers, fathers and chil
dren will be among those turned
out.
Paradoxically, the economic
boom in San Diego has made
many poor families worse off.
Prosperity is driving up demand
for housing and pushing rents to

record levels.
Tomorrow, San Diego will close
two of its three winter shelters,
forcing out about 150 veterans
and 200 single adults. The city this
week granted a one-month
reprieve for the third shelter,
which houses families — some 200
people in all, 140 of them chil
dren.
Among them is Debbie Stewart,
who holds out hope she will find
housing for her and her six chil
dren, ages 4 to 14, by the May 15
closing of the St. Vincent de Paul
Village shelter. But, she says, "it's
not that easy."

The West's hot technology
market has helped drop San
Diego's unemployment rate to jnsi
2.0 percent, but for someone with
no high-tech skills, or with no abil
ity to read, there is little opportu
nity to be had.
At the St. Vincent de Paul Vil
lage shelter, an average of mote
than 300 men, women and chil
dren — twice the number last year
— sought refuge each night.
" That's a huge increase," says
the Rev. Joe Carroll, the Roman
Catholic priest who leads the city's
largest program to house the
homeless. "Five or 10 percent you

can understand. But doubling?
There's tremendous growth in the
number of families on the streets
all over America, and particularly
in San Diego."
Observers blame a combination
of factors: welfare reform, which
has cut benefits and pushed people
into jobs that pay little; a change in
skills needed for new jobs; and ris
ing rents in a tight housing market.
In San Diego County, the rental
vacancy rate was just 1.8 percent in
March, and the average monthly
rent rose to $887, up from $821 a
year earlier, according to a study
