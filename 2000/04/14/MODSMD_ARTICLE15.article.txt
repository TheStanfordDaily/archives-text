# Peruvian election going to second round

### 
I.IMA, Peru (AP) â€” Opposition activists
were jubilant yesterday after forcing a second
round in Peru's presidential elections, but
experts warned that supporters of President
Alberto Fujimori would step up a campaign of
(lirtv 11 it ks and electoral Iraud to hold on to
power.
Fujimori, (il, known as "The Emperor" for
his bulldozer style of governing, fell a hair
short of the majority he needed and will face
upstart challenger Alejandro Toledo, 54, an
international economist who once worked as a
shoeshine boy to help out his impoverished
family.
"The decision to have a second round is
good. It's the light one because we all want a
change of presidents," said Adrian
Dominguez, a waiter at the Motel Bolivar on
the Plaza San Martin where thousands of Tole
do's supporters cheered the news Wednesday

night.
But experts foresee a rough road ahead for
Toledo. They anticipate a second round even
more tainted In election abuses than the con
troversial first round of voting.
The runoff would bring "more of the same
or worse," said political analyst Fernando
Tuesta. "It's going to be 'lis or them.' Either
you're with Fujimori or you're his enemy."
With 97.68 percent of the ballots tallied,
Fujimori had 49.84 percent compared to
40.31 percent for his challenger. Seven other
candidates split the rest.
The criticism of the election's fairness with
in and outside Peru was so strong that if Fuji
mori had won outright a third five-year term,
his government would most likely have
become an international pariah and a source
of instability in the region, experts said.
"What the government has done yesterday

is not to add up votes. It has been a political
decision to accept a second round," Rafael
Roncagliolo said, director of I ransparencia, a
private citizens' group.
Roncagliolo, whose organization monitored
an unofficial vote count that showed Fujimori
would be forced into a runoff, said the election
tally announced Wednesday night was forced
on the government by the close scrutiny from
foreign governments and monitors.
Fduardo Stein, head of a team of monitors
fiom the Organization of American States,
complained yesterday that Fujimori's govern
ment was still dragging its feet in the investi
gation of charges that his campaign forged
more than I million signatures to register his
candidacy.
"This is only going to accumulate and aug
ment the groundswell of mistrust we saw in
the first count," lie said.
