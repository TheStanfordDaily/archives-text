## The 						Stanford Daily Class of 2004: welcome to Stanford University

P*IW«ISiIHtJS9/

CONGRATULATIONS AND wel
come to the Farm. This weekend you
will have a chance to talk with cur
rent students and faculty, try out
undergraduate life at Stanford and meet
other admits to the Class of 2004. As one of
the prospective freshmen from all over the
world, you have a wonderful opportunity
before you.
Of course, you have to make the big deci
sion first. We know you are going to have a
great time as pro fros, but we also know that
some of you are still weighing your options. As
you consider the Farm, here are some things
to think about:
Focus on Undergraduate Education: Stan-

ford isn't a liberal arts college, but it has devot
ed much time and effort in recent years to the
enhancement of its undergraduate programs.
Thanks to the Stanford Introductory Studies
program, every freshman and sophomore
who wants to do so can take a seminar with a
senior faculty member as an underclassman.
Sophomore College, a three-week program
before the start of fall quarter, provides a
chance for concentrated study in a particular
field with a professor. There is also plenty of
faculty support and funding for undergradu
ate research. At Stanford, lecture classes are
taught by professors. While you may have
large lecture classes here, there are also plen
ty of opportunities to take seminar classes, to

personalize your studies or even design your
own major.
Lifestyle: There's always something to do
on and around the Farm, ranging from ath
letic events to guest lectures and from swing
dances to frat parties. Honestly, where else
can you listen to the school's symphony
orchestra perform on Friday night and watch
athletes in the nation's most successful athletic
program on Saturday? While Stanford has its
share of varsity athletes and virtuosos, you can
pursue athletics and the fine arts recreational
ly. Stanford has countless extracurricular
options and many students participate in
community service projects. Plus, the Stan
ford campus is safe — what other school has

bicycle theft as the most common crime?
Options: This is Stanford's mantra, its
blessing and, at times, its curse. At Stanford
the options are endless, and making choices
can be very tough. Academically speaking,
you can double major, minor, earn a Master's
degree in four years, write a thesis, study
abroad and in some cases choose from any of
20 or 30 different classes to fulfill a distribu
tion requirement. You will have room for a
sizeable number of electives during your Stan
ford career. In addition to all these options,
Stanford provides a variety of housing and
dining options. For example, there are tradi-

members at-large. Signed columns and contributions are the view ol the writer and do not necessarily represent tiie view of the editorial board.
tional dormitories, academic and eth
nic theme houses, co-ops, suites,
apartments and the Greek system.
People: Stanford people are nice.
We are intelligent and inquisitive, but
also very down-to-earth. Our interests
are very diverse, but we all somehow
manage to find our niche here. We
like to work, but we like to have fun,
too. It's all part of the Stanford expe
rience. And although we all study
hard, we aren't openly competitive.
Community: Lots of schools talk
about community, but Stanford really
makes an effort to create it. Life at
Stanford is residentially based, and all
of the houses and dormitories have a
student staff to plan social activities.
Every Wednesday night, all the dor
mitories have house meetings and
dining halls are set up so that you eat
with the students in your house or
dormitory.
While you weigh your options, be
sure to take some quiet time this week
end to think about who you are and
what you want out of your college. Go
for a walk around Lake Lagunita, jog
to the Dish or just browse at the Book
store. If you choose Stanford, we know
you won't regret it.
