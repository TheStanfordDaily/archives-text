# THE 						FLIP SIDE
## A 						sample letter 
### 
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Stanford Fund
Donor, I am writing (and I mean
physically writing. My fourth
grade teacher would Ix- so proud
that I found a use for my cursive writing
skills) to thank you for your contribution to
the Stanfo ... 1 mean ... "The" Stanford
Fund. I'm a senior this year and having
spent four years here at Stanford, I've
come to realize the various ways in which
Fhe Stanford Fund has improved the lives
of our undergraduates. As a generous
do nor . . . oh

wail ... I'm not allowed
to say the word "gener
ous" because for all I
know, you're cheaper
than a Stanford student
on a first date, which
means you probably
only donated like $ 1.50,
and then only because it
got you the free Stan
ford pencil. Kit her way,

as a donor, I'd like to thank you personally
for making my Stanford experience com
plete. Here's how!! :)
Sixty percent of your donation to The
Stanford Fund goes to financial aid. (I
know this might sound like a form letter,
but I swear it isn't. Really! It isn't.) This por
tion of your contribution (that's 90 cents in
case you wanted to keep track) helps to
attract the best and brightest high school
students by offering support for the finan
cial burden of Stanford tuition. I have not
personally seen a cent of your money. My
father's name ends in the letters "M.D." so
I will never see a single cent of anybody's
money. Your 90 cents is helping some
Stanford student somewhere, and I'm glad
I have the privilege of thanking you, in cur
sive writing, for your generosity.
The other 40 percent of your donation
to The Stanford Fund goes to undergrad
uate teaching and special initiatives. (I
promise you, this is not a form letter. Okay,
so it is partially, or should I say closer to
mostly a form letter. Hut don't worry,
there's only eight copies of this particular
letter so there's no chance of you ever
meeting another person with the same
one. Funny how that works.) Now, where
was I? Oh yeah, undergraduate teaching.
You've donated 60 cents to it. Some Stan
ford senior went to Moscow with a URO
grant and was able to buy a Snickers
because of you. You're the greatest.
Finally, the Stanford Fu . .. sorry
.. . "The" Stanford Fund sponsors the
Student Group Partnership. It's this
blessed system where Stanford student
groups provide slave labor to write and
copy fake-ass thank you letters to people
that donate to 'I"he Fund. I'm a member of

the Ultimate Team, Ram's Head Theatri
cal Scxiety, an improv group and a com
munity service organization to save the
whales. That means I get to write 48 letters
this quarter. At about 20 minutes a letter,
that means I've wasted 16 hours of my time
writing fake-ass thank you letters. But
here's the kick. If I forget to capitalize the
" I he"in the " I he Stanford Fund," or if I
make one spelling mistake, or if I even
THINK about addinga hint of personality
and true gratitude to the letter; IT WILL
BE CUT!! So if you're reading this, you
know just how special this letter is.
If all this hasn't convinced you that Fhe
Stanford Fund isn't the greatest thing since
Vanilla Ice Cream, then here are a few
other things this glorious organization
sponsors that'll really flip your lid.
Frosh Thank-A-Thon!!! You get fresh
men (since they don't know any better).
You stick them in a big room with tele
phones. You have them call people and
thank them. What are they thanking them
for? Who cares! Will they donate more
money? Maybe. Will the donors be
annoyed or not at home? Most likely. I
can't think of a more successful sounding
program.
Or what about Senior Gift? lx*t me just
tell you that 1 love my class. And I have
never seen my class bond over something
as much as we've Ixinded over Senior Gift.
There's just something about our fellow
classmates harassing us nonstop for money
that really makes our entire class want to
rip their throats out.
And here I was thinking that we'd be the
first senior class to donate to something
worthwhile. Instead, the senior class will
soon get a letter saying, "Dear Class of
2000, 60 percent of your donation goes to
financial aid. Fourty percent of your dona
tion goes to undergrad teaching. Thank
you for sending my a capella group to
Hawaii. Blah, blah, blah ..." It's amazing,
isn't it?
Sorry, I lost my train of thought again.
Oh yeah, Thank you for donating your
$1.50 to Ihe Stanford Fund. You have
helped to create my Stanford experience.
I hanks to you, I can buy a hamburger and
small fries from McDonalds. Or even a cup
of coffee. Your donation actually is appre
ciated. I'm just not allowed to tell you why
because that might be real and personal,
and we can't have that. So instead I'll say
that .... umm .... oh yeah, "your dona
tion has helped another generation of
Stanford students live the Stanford experi
ence. For that, I am forever grateful."

first senior class to donate to something
worthwhile. Instead, the senior class will
soon get a letter saying, "Dear Class of
2000, 60 percent of your donation goes to
financial aid. Fourty percent of your dona
tion goes to undergrad teaching. Thank
you for sending my a capella group to
Hawaii. Blah, blah, blah ..." It's amazing,
isn't it?
Sorry, I lost my train of thought again.
Oh yeah, Thank you for donating your
$1.50 to Ihe Stanford Fund. You have
helped to create my Stanford experience.
I hanks to you, I can buy a hamburger and
small fries from McDonalds. Or even a cup
of coffee. Your donation actually is appre
ciated. I'm just not allowed to tell you why
because that might be real and personal,
and we can't have that. So instead I'll say
that .... umm .... oh yeah, "your dona
tion has helped another generation of
Stanford students live the Stanford experi
ence. For that, I am forever grateful."
Sincerely,
Abhijit Bhattacharya
