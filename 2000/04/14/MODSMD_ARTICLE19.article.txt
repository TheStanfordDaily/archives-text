Stanford Medical Center responds
The Stanford community has been
stunned by the publication of your April
12 article "Medical Center surgeon's
practices cause controversy."
In this article, you have parroted (he
unsubstantiated allegations of a racist
attorney and a handful of disgruntled
individuals, while ignoring the careful,
reasoned decisions of the Medical Boards
of two states, the courts, the INS, the Jus
tice Department and the independent
Quality Assurance process at Stanford.
While investigation by all of these
authorities might be looked at as a sign of
impropriety, it is important to realize that
repeated, groundless accusations to these
authorities has been a means of intention
al harassment of this family for many
years. You have villainized some of the
most respected and capable members of
our medical community, and you will
have injured many women who may not
seek care by the Nezhats for problems
that only a handful of surgeons in the
world have the skill to help.
A 1998 Court opinion concluded that
the Nezhats have been the victims of a
sustained campaign of malicious, unjusti
fied and unethical harassment. Your
recent article is just the latest element of
this campaign.
At Stanford, the Nezhats have helped
surgeons from General Surgery, Colorec
tal Surgery, Vascular Surgery, Trans

plantation Surgery, Thoracic Surgery,
Cardiac Surgery, Gynecologic Oncology,
Neurosurgery and Urology, as well as
other gynecologists. One of the best
things about Stanford is that at least until
now we have generally enjoyed a trusting
and collegial environment in which sur
geons from many different disciplines
have been able to help each other, and to
ask for help, with a surprising lack of ego.
Everyone, and most importantly our
patients, has benefited from this out
standing cooperation. But Dr. Nezhat's
detractors would have you believe that
this cooperation is an example of undisci
plined and reckless behavior performed
by Dr Nezhat alone. Nothing could be
farther from the truth.
I would challenge you to find a single
instance in which Dr. Nezhat has operat
ed on a patient outside of his discipline
except as an assistant, and at the request
of another surgeon.
He should be thanked for providing
such assistance, not condemned. The last
two weeks for me have been a sobering
lesson about the irresponsibility of our
press. At the least you owe the Nezhats
and Stanford Medical Center a full and
fair investigation and a front-page retrac
tion. For the women whom you have
frightened and will have injured, your
retraction will likely be too late.

Responding to the Stanford Open Space
Alliance
There is no doubt that open space is
a valuable aesthetic and recreational
resource in this area. Fortunately, Stan
ford recognized that fact long before the
Stanford Open Space Alliance came into
being. The University has left thousands
of acres of fields, hills and wooded tracts
free of development as neighboring
communities have built up on all sides.
1 wenty-five years ago, Stanford
placed its outlying lands in academic
reserve, to be held for possible low
intensity educational uses in the future
that respected the environment and left
the hilltops and ridgelines free of struc
tures. I find that to be an extraordinary
policy that well meets SOSA's call for the
University to "act with integrity for the
long-time good of the community."
I hat broad good, by the way,
includes higher education. Indeed, one
could argue that the value of a new
medical, engineering, business school or
linguistic laboratory appropriately sited
and mitigated in the flatlands west of
Junipero Sena Blvd. could exceed the
value of the property as an ever-widen
ing series of ecologically-damaging hik
ing trails.
This is not to dismiss the importance
of open areas. It is basically a call to
keep two important social values in per
spective, without the demand for a free
public park on private lands overriding
the basic lights of a highly-responsible
landowner.

Responding to Senior Gift criticisms
I am writing in response to Rachel
Salberg and Alix McCown's April 6 let
ter ("Seniors disappointed with Senior
Gift Campaign") with regards to the
Senior Gift efforts. I am a member of
the Senior Gift Committee, and I want
ed to respond to your recent letter to
I'lie Daily.
Let me just start by saying that I love
being a part of the Senior Gift Commit
tee. I love the opportunity that it gives
me to reconnect with my classmates and
to explain to them why I think giving to
the Stanford Fund for Undergraduate
Education is important, not just later in
life, but right now, while we are still
undergraduates. I enjoy catching up
with people that I haven't really talked
to in a few months (or years) to find out
what they are studying, what they are

doing next year and what experiences
have stood out for them over the past
few years.
It reminds me of how magical this
place is, how rich and diverse our class
is and what wonderful opportunities we
have shared during our time at Stan
lord. It reinforces my belief in The Stan
lord Fund and its mission to "support
the entire undergraduate experience at
Stanford and target the most pressing
needs in undergraduate education â€”
scholarships, teaching and learning and
student life." 1 have personally felt the
impact of The Stanford Fund in several
ways.
It provided seed funding for the
Stanford Introductory Studies pro
gram, which sponsored the seminar on
"Environmental Ethics" which helped
me to develop my first real intellectual
relationship with a professor during my
sophomore year. In addition, The Stan
lord Fund supported Stanford-in-
Washington, which was, in many ways,
the highlight of my time at Stanford.
The Stanford Fund's student group
partnership has also made exciting
tilings possible for some of the student
organizations in which 1 have been
involved. Finally, the Stanford Fund
helps Stanford to uphold its need blind
admissions policy by supporting finan
cial aid. In fact, GO percent of every gift
goes directly to Financial Aid.
To me, a gift to the Stanford Fund
from the Class of 2000 is the most mean
ingful gif t of all, a lasting legacy that will
help to ensure that future Stanford

undergraduates will receive the same
world-class educationand phenomenal
resources that we received. It is also a
way to say thank you to Stanford and to
the many individuals who have support
ed us during our time here. Yes, it is a
different sort of gift than a tangible
plaque or statue, but ultimately, which is
more beneficial to Stanford?
With regards to your comments about
the methods which the Senior Gift Com
mittee uses to solicit gifts, I can only ask
you to be realistic. There are 1,600 peo
ple in our class. We are trying to reach
each and every person, not only to ask
you to join us in giving a Senior Gift, but
also to educate you about The Stanford
Fund and to correct any misperceptions
that you might have. I'm sorry if you feel
pressured, uncomfortable or resentful. I
really am.
Please realize that if you get multiple
calls, it probably just means that there
are a lot of people on the committee
who want to reconnect with you before
you graduate and who are interested in
sharing their vision of the importance of
giving back. It is the spring of our senior
year. The weather is beautiful. It is a
perfect time to celebrate our collective
accomplishments, our graduation and
the brightness of our future in such a
prosperous time. It is also a great time
to give.
If you give now, your gift of $20 is
matched by a gift from the Parents Advi
sory Board and Peter Bing to be worth
$80. That's a great way to maximize the
impact of your dollar on a student's

budget. To me, Senior Gift represents
the beginning of a lifelong tradition of
giving back to Stanford, both as a donor
and as a volunteer. It helps me stay con
nected to the people who have made
this place so incredible and it gives me
an opportunity to reflect on why it is
important to give back to Stanford. Yes,
money can be divisive, but the collective
power of lots of individuals making a
contribution is absolutely in effect here.
In this time of celebration, I hope you
will consider joining me in contributing
to the Stanford Fund as a way to say
thanks.
