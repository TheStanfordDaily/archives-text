Stanford Medical Center responds
The Stanford community has been
stunned by the publication of your April
12 article "Medical Center surgeon's
practices cause controversy."
In this article, you have parroted (he
unsubstantiated allegations of a racist
attorney and a handful of disgruntled
individuals, while ignoring the careful,
reasoned decisions of the Medical Boards
of two states, the courts, the INS, the Jus
tice Department and the independent
Quality Assurance process at Stanford.
While investigation by all of these
authorities might be looked at as a sign of
impropriety, it is important to realize that
repeated, groundless accusations to these
authorities has been a means of intention
al harassment of this family for many
years. You have villainized some of the
most respected and capable members of
our medical community, and you will
have injured many women who may not
seek care by the Nezhats for problems
that only a handful of surgeons in the
world have the skill to help.
A 1998 Court opinion concluded that
the Nezhats have been the victims of a
sustained campaign of malicious, unjusti
fied and unethical harassment. Your
recent article is just the latest element of
this campaign.
At Stanford, the Nezhats have helped
surgeons from General Surgery, Colorec
tal Surgery, Vascular Surgery, Trans

plantation Surgery, Thoracic Surgery,
Cardiac Surgery, Gynecologic Oncology,
Neurosurgery and Urology, as well as
other gynecologists. One of the best
things about Stanford is that at least until
now we have generally enjoyed a trusting
and collegial environment in which sur
geons from many different disciplines
have been able to help each other, and to
ask for help, with a surprising lack of ego.
Everyone, and most importantly our
patients, has benefited from this out
standing cooperation. But Dr. Nezhat's
detractors would have you believe that
this cooperation is an example of undisci
plined and reckless behavior performed
by Dr Nezhat alone. Nothing could be
farther from the truth.
I would challenge you to find a single
instance in which Dr. Nezhat has operat
ed on a patient outside of his discipline
except as an assistant, and at the request
of another surgeon.
He should be thanked for providing
such assistance, not condemned. The last
two weeks for me have been a sobering
lesson about the irresponsibility of our
press. At the least you owe the Nezhats
and Stanford Medical Center a full and
fair investigation and a front-page retrac
tion. For the women whom you have
frightened and will have injured, your
retraction will likely be too late.

Responding to the Stanford Open Space
Alliance
There is no doubt that open space is
a valuable aesthetic and recreational
resource in this area. Fortunately, Stan
ford recognized that fact long before the
Stanford Open Space Alliance came into
being. The University has left thousands
of acres of fields, hills and wooded tracts
free of development as neighboring
communities have built up on all sides.
1 wenty-five years ago, Stanford
placed its outlying lands in academic
reserve, to be held for possible low
intensity educational uses in the future
that respected the environment and left
the hilltops and ridgelines free of struc
tures. I find that to be an extraordinary
policy that well meets SOSA's call for the
University to "act with integrity for the
long-time good of the community."
I hat broad good, by the way,
includes higher education. Indeed, one
could argue that the value of a new
medical, engineering, business school or
linguistic laboratory appropriately sited
and mitigated in the flatlands west of
Junipero Sena Blvd. could exceed the
value of the property as an ever-widen
ing series of ecologically-damaging hik
ing trails.
This is not to dismiss the importance
