# Search committee left out important presidential candidate
## 
### TOM JACKSON GUEST COLUMNIST 
Provost John Hennessey's recent
appointment as Stanford's 10th president
has been remarkable only in that students
and faculty alike seem to have overlooked
another, more viable candidate. While
Hennessey's contributions as provost and
as a professor in the Electrical Engineer
ing Department are indisputable, 1 feel
that a university such as Stanford
deserves, and in fact requires, the "total
package" in its president.
First of all, few have addressed the

importance of having an alumnus as pres
ident. Henessey is not a Stanford alum
nus, and therefore has no idea what it's
really like to be a student, graduate or
undergraduate, at Stanford. He doesn't
know the student traditions, like Full
Moon on the Quad, and as a techie, he
doesn't understand the importance that
athletics plays on this campus.
Perhaps most astonishing is the fact
that there exists a candidate with all the
above qualifications, and yet he has
received practically zero consideration for
the job. 1 speak, of course, of John Elway.
Elway holds several clear advantages

over Hennessey as a presidential candi
date. As an alumnus ( Class of 1983) he is
certainly familiar with the Stanford under
graduate experience, and his bachelor's
degree in Economics (3.0 CPA) provides a
greater link between Stanford's rival
techie and fuzzie factions than the former
head of the School of Engineering.
All of this is rendered meaningless, of
course, when you consider the huge dis
parities in arm strength and quick release
between the two. Quite simply, Hen
nessey has never been able to spread the
field to beat a man press. He cannot
throw the long ball, so his receivers see

nothing but tight bump-n-run defense,
which leads to a steady diet of safety
blitzes. He gets nervous in the pocket and
before you know it he has thrown two
interceptions, been sacked three times
and signed off on a disastrous hospital
merger with UCSF.
I know what you're thinking, "Hen
nessey can read defenses so well, right?
Shouldn't this, combined with his high
ranking position at Microsoft, give him an
edge over Elway?" Well, in a word, no.
Ask any scout, Hennessey is simply too
short to see over the lineman. Hennessey
may know the game, and he may be able

to recognize the blitz well, but he just
doesn't have the physical tools to exploit it
like Elway does, and in the end, he lacks
the mental toughness of the Comeback
Kid. In 16 years, Elway engineered 48
come-from-behind fourth-quarter drives,
and we're going to go with a guy who
came from Villanova? They're not even
Division 1!
I do hope it's not too late to consider
another candidate for our University's
tenth president: a legend in his own time,
the man of the century, the future of Stan
ford University â€” Hall of Famer John
Albert Elway.
