Guggenheim winners to 140 since
1974. Fellow s are I radii ionall\ free
of normal workloads din ing their
fellowship periods in ordei to do
research.
Stanford's recipients plan to
make good use of both the time
and the financial reward.
"Mostly, 1 1 plan to] sit and
write," said ()i gel, who is woi king
on a book about the bistoi\ <>l the
relationship between Shakespeare
an texts ,ind prodiiclions.
" 1 he plays were w i itten foi pel -
formaucc; ilie\ weren't written to
be books," said ()rgel. " I here's
never been am fixed text, actors
have always revised, changed
tilings, dropped themes ,i<< ording
to what they thought would please
the audience.
"M\ argument is that there's
much more relation between the
performance and the text than we

allow."
Sheehan won the award for his
research on "what ii means to be a
[nation-)siate. My argument is that
it means something very different
to be a state at the end of the 20th
century than .it the beginning."
While most of Ins research lo
nised on Western Furope, Shee
han also took a comparative ap
proach, examining "the growing
dillercnce between what it means
to be a stale in Furope and else
w here in the woi Id."
Afiei teaching at the Stanfbrd
in-lk i tin program in the fall, Shee
han will remain in Furope for the
next several months.
Widoin, an expert in the field of
information representation and
exchange ovei the Internet, will
use liei fellowship to researc It new
wa\s to ciuery and search the
World Wide Web.
I lirough "semistrue tured
dai.i. a hybrid between unstruc
tured text documents and fullv

structured databases, Widom
hopes to blend two traditional
search techniques — information
retrieval and database mecha
nisms.
Bratman, who won the award
for his research on the philosophy
of human action, lias served as
chaii of the Faculty Senate and also
of the Philosophy Department, in
addition to writing extensively on
the logical structure of practical
reasoning.
"[My research deals with] differ
ent models of'human agency. |and|
what features of human agency are
important and distinctive," said
Bratman. Ihese features include
the behavior of humans as both
"planning" agents, who plan activi
ties over time, and "reflective"
agents, who think about what tliev
do.
As an ancient philosophy spe
cialist, Nightingale won the
(iuggenheim for her research on
the conception of wisdom in

fourth-century Athens.
Nightingale, a Phi Beta Kappa
graduate of Stanford, lias devel
oped an ecology course that draws
on humanist perspectives.
Amid celebration over the fel
lowship, one recipient raised ques
tions about Stanford's reliance on
outside funding for research in the
humanities.
While calling Stanford "won
derful" and "very supportive,"
Orgel cited the I Diversity's "un
generous sabbatical svstem" as a
kc\ problem lor the humanities.
"In order toget time for writing,
voli have to get an outside fellow
ship," he said. "And that's self-de
feating. lhe University doesn't
trust its own judgment about its
faculty.
"[Stanford is | not comparable to
other comparable universities," he
continued, citing Johns Hopkins
L ni\ei sit\ as an example of a uni
versity w iib "anenormotisK gener
ous and wonderful sabbatical sys-

tern.
Orgel said that lie doubted re
searchers in the sciences had simi
lar problems secui ing funding for
research.
According to Sheehan, howev
er, "Stanford provides sufficient
help for the humanists — the [Stan
ford] Humanities Center does a
great deal in picking up the slack.
"Scientists who need labs and
equipment need more money that
we do," he continued. "[Humani
ties researchers] need time and the
ability to go to libraries and
art hives."
Stating that it was "really impor
tant for this outside funding to be
available," Bratman emphasized
the significance of having time off
from teaching in order to work on
what he hopes will become a book.
"I love teaching, but I love writ -
ing too, and this is my chance to
write. Sometimes, you need to take
a deep breath and go to the li
brary."
