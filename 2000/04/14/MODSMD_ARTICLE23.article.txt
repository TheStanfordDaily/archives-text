### SAMEER AHMED STAFF WRITER 
Sonic kids dream about be
coming professional athletes.
Others want to be doctors. (leoff
Abrams was more ambitious than
"s< line kids" â€” lit' wanted both.
For Abrams, the* Pith-ranked
collegiate tennis player in the na
tion, captain of the No. 1 Stanford
men's team and a senior human
biolog\ major, both his dreams
are becoming a reality.
(Irowing up in Newport
Beach, Abrams knew he wanted
to be a professional athlete; the
pr< >blein was pic king which sport.
Whether it was soccer, baseball,
swimming, basketball or tennis,
Abrams excelled at prett\ much
everything.
But when he entered high
school. Abrams made a c hoice.
"Baseball and tennis were in\
favorite. I c hose tennis because ol
its athleticism," he said. "I think
baseball is a great sport, and I love
watching it. but vou sit around a
lot. Also, with baseball, vou prettx
much sta\ in the I nited States,
where with tennis, vou get to trav
el the world and see everything."
W hen Abrams finalh dec ided
to focus on tennis in 1992, the ti
tles and achievements rolled in. At
l-f. he earned the No. I ranking
in his age group. I liree vears
later, he won the I S I A National
Indoor 1 <S championship.
F.stablishing himself as one ol

the best junior tennis players m
the nation and maintaining a !V92
(iPA at Newport Harbor High,
Abrams seemed like a perfect
match for Stanford, his dream
school since hew as nine vears old.
Stepping into a team that had
alreach won back-to-back nation
al championships could ha\e in
timidated the freshman. Howev
er, Abrams thrived undei the
pressure. During his first two sea
sons. the team won two more na
tional championships.
Abrams llourished individual
ly as well. As a sophonu>i e.he did
not lose a single dual match all

record, the best in Stanford men's
tennis history.
However. Abrams downplays
his undefeated season because ol
his positi<>n on the team that year.

NCAA tournament.
" The l< >ss against Baylor was dev
astating," Abrams said. "We had
won the doubles point and were up
1-0. We figured that we could win at
least halt of singles. But when we
lost 4-2, it was awful. I never really
recovered from the loss and ended
up losing in the first round in singles
and doubles of the individuals. I hat
was a rough week."
After a setback like die loss to
Baylor, you would expect .1 com
petitor like Abrams to spend his
summer playing in professional
tennis tournaments, like many of
his teammates, to get ready for the
following season. However,
Abrams decided to focus on his
other goal, getting into medical
school.
Therefore, Abrams spent his
summer studying for and taking the
MCA I and working at a cancel re
search facility and a county health
clinic in Newport Beach.
"I would have loved to play ten
nis this summer," Abrams said. "I
didn't reallv need the time off, but I

wanted to get reach for my life after
tennis."
While Abrams' ability to balance
his demanding tennis career with
the academic rigor of being pre
med .it Stanford has been one of his
toughest challenges in his life, it has
also gained the respect of many of
his teammates and coaches.
"GeoH is definitely one of the
people I admire the most for his
suc c ess on and off the court," said
junior Alex Kim, Abrams' doubles
partner. "1 le's been able to be pre
ined at Stanford and do really well
on the court. Not main people can
do that."
Though Abrams did not play
competitive tennis this summer, he
came back to the Karrn as good as
ever. 1 his season, he has been
ranked as high ;is No. -4 in the nation
in singles and No. I in doubles with
Kim. As the captain and onK senior
on the team, Abrams has led the
Cardinal to a No. 1 ranking and a
perfect IH-0 record.
I lowever, Abrams is still waiting
to accomplish his ultimate goal for
the season.
"I'd love to win a singles or dou
bles (I lampiouship individually, but
the main goal would by fill be win
ning the team championship,"

Abrams said. "I love this team. To
share a championship with these
guys and have it in my senior year
would be great."
While Abrams will be sad to leave
I lis teammates and friends at Stan
lord, he knows after the NCAA
championships in May, life at Stan
lord will be over, and he must be
prepared to face the real world.
After applying to medical schools
this summer, Abrams plans to com
pete on the pro tour lor at least a
year.
"I'll see what happens on the
tout and see what happens with get
ting into medical si liool, whichever
seems to work out at the time, that's
probably what I'll follow," Abrams
said.
I lead coach Dick (Could believes
Abrams will succeed in whatever
path he decides to pursue.
"Ceoff has a big enough tennis
game that if he really decides to go
somewhere on the pro tour, he can
do a pretty good job after leaving
school," (iould said. " The fact that
he is pre-med may detract from his
single-niindedness to become a
great tennis player. Ceolf is just a
really good person who is going to
be a success whatever he does."
