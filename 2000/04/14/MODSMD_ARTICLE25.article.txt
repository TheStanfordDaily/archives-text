I he No. 1 Stanford men's tennis team (18-0,5-
0 Pacific 10 Conference) will trv to clinch its third
consecutive Pac-10 title when it visits Arizona and
Arizona State this weekend.
First up, the Cardinal, the onl\ undefeated Di
vision I men's tennis team in the nation, travels to
1 cmpe to face Arizona State (6-10, 1-4 Pac-10)
today at 1:30 p.m.
While the Sun Devils have not performed that
well this year, they have the potential to challenge
the (Cardinal. 1 .ast season, Arizona State advanced
to the third round of the \'( IAA tournament while
finishing the season ranked No. 10 in the country.
Led In senior Alex Osterrieth, ranked No. 85 in
the nation, the Sun Devils are coming off a
upset over No. 26 Washington last Fridav.
Alter playing Arizona State, the team hops in
the van for the two-hour drive to Tucson to face
Arizona (8-7,0-5 Pac-10) on Saturday at noon.
li the Stanford plavers are not exhausted from
their trip the dav before, defeating the Wildcats,
ranked last in the Pac-10, should not be that diffi
i alt. I folding a lifetime record of 43-1, the Cardi
nal lias won :tt> straight mate lies against Arizona.
I his weekend's dual matches are the second
time the Cardinal has faced both Arizona schools
this vear. On the weekend of March 31 -April 1,
Stanford dismantled both Arizona schools with
back to back 7-0 w ins on the Farm. The Cardinal
did not lose a match in singles or doubles against
either team.
I low ever, according to head coach Dick (lould,
the matches this weekend should be a lot more
competitive than the ones earlier this year.
" I he Arizona schools are never easy to beat
down there," Could said. "It's a tough trip for us
and it wears on you. 1 lie guys have got to be ready
to play or we could easily stub our toe."
Yet. il the Stanford players are
mentally and physically prepared to
plav, the Arizona schools should not
|)< )sc a big threat.
Demonstrated In the I I A incli
yidual rankings that came out on
Wednesday, neither Arizona team
has the talent or depth to compete
with the(Cardinal. Stanford has lour

No. I in the country before missing
nearU three months with a ruptured
spleen, picked up his first singles vie

ton since returning when lie defeat

on Wednesday.
()n the doubles side, Abranis and
Kim retained the nation's top rank
ings for the fifth straight month,
while I lippensteel and freshman
David Martin re-entered the top 50
at No. 21.
If the Cardinal sweeps the Ari
zona schools as expected, the team
would finish Pac-10 play undefeated
and clinch its third consecutive Pac -
10 title. Stanford is currently one
game ahead of UCLA, the No. 2
team in the nation, and two ahead of
No. IS I S( in the Pac-10 rankings.
Hut for Gould, securing the Pac
-10 title is not a prioritv.
Winning the Pac-10 title "would
be nice, but that is not what we are
playing for,"he said.

What the team is plaving for is .i
chance to host an NCAA regional
match to better its c hances to win the
NCAA team championship in
Athens, (ia., at the end of Ma).
I o achieve that goal, the ('.ardinal
needs to win as many matches as
possible to gain the highest seeding
possible for the N( \A tournament.
After facing the Arizona sc liools,
the ( ardinal heads back to the farm
to host a very tough Pepperdine
team next I uesdav. I lie Waves,
ranked fourth in the nation, are the
onl\ team in the eotmtn besides
Stanford that has beaten I ( LV.
"We want to go into the Pepper
dine watch with a little bit of a roll
going." Could said. "From that
standpoint, it's a ver\ important
weekend for us. We can't afford to let
down."
