" Realist icall\ we're not going to score 12

coach Mark Marc|uess.
I he 1 luskies (14-17. 3-0 Pac -10) come

son.
W ashington has bounced back well at

the plate this \ear after losing two-thirds of
its hits and RBI production from 1909's
squad. Sophomore left fielder Todd Lin
den has picked up the offensive load and
leads the team in batting (.357) and RBIs
(31).
1111 ii< >1 |ustin Wayne gets the call to stop
the 111 isk\ attack tonight. For the second
time in two vears, his opponent will be ju
niot Jeff (larlsen.
In a seven-inning start last season.
Wavne st niggled at I luskv Ballpark and al
lowed lour runs off seven hits in a no-deci
sion. (larlsen did not factor in the decision
either in their hist meeting, scattering 11
hits and iwo runs over 7 1/3 innings.
Both pitc hers come oil solid out
ings, with Wayne's eighth win pow
ered by his fifth double-digit strike
out game this season.
Carlsen's brilliant complete
game four-hitter last week against
Arizona snapped Wildcat ace Ben
Diggins' eight-game winning streak.

('.arisen "is one of the better pitch
ers in the conference," Marquess
said. "Facing him will be a good test
for us."

Saturday's matinee w ill see junior
Jason Young back on the mound
after striking out a season-high 15
last weekend and extending his w in
ning streak to 10 games.
Young's performance encour
aged coaches after a sore shoulder
kept him out of action for several
weeks.
"lie's throwing hard and he
seems toget better each time he goes
out, so I'm very pleased with his
progress," Marquess said.
I lie third starter role continues
to be a question mark for Marquess,
but one that is not necessarily nega
tive. Both sophomore Mike Gosling
and freshman Inn Cunningham
have performed well on the mound
in recent starts.
"It mas be a situation where it's

never set after Wavne and Young,"
Marquess said.
Sophomore Brian Sager, the
earlv-seasc>ll third starter, has begun
to throw on the side in practice and
come hack from the shoulder injury
that has kept him out of three
straight starts.
(loaches estimate that the hard
throwing right \ will he ready to pitch
within the next few weeks but have
not committed to reinstalling him
into the starting r<nation.
" The good news is [Sager] is line,
hut it'll take him a while to get hack,"
Marquess said.
Stanford currently sits in a four
way tie for second place in the hu
ll), one game back of No. 17 LCI A.
Ihe series kicks (>H with a 6 p.m. start
tonight at Sunken Diamond.
