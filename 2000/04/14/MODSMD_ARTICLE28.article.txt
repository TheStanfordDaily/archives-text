### ELISSA KESZLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I lie lop ranked Stanford women's water polo team trav
els north todav to face No. I 1 I 'C-Davis. This will be the Car
dinal's last dual game before the national qualifying tourna
ment host l>\ California April 22-23.
While the outcome of Friday's game will have no official
effects on the (Cardinal record or national ranking. Stanford
is planning to use the game to hone its skills before the qual
ifying tournament.
" I here is a good chance that we will face Davis in our sec
ond game ol the qualifying tournament," said head coach
John fanner. "We have not played against Davis this year
and todav's game will give us a chance to see how we match
up against them."
I )avis is known for its strong defensive abilities. During a
game the Aggies switch up their defenses with the intention
of confusing the other team. This will give the Cardinal a
chance to work on its offensive adaptability.
" I his game we be good practice," said freshman |ulie
Cardner. "It will give us a chance to try new plavs and play
a phvsical game."
The Davis pool is also the site of Stanford's overtime loss
in the final game of last vear's national championships.
I oda\ will be the first time Stanford w ill be back in that pool
after that memorable game.
"I.ast vear's nationals was the source of a lot of emotions
loi us." fanner said. "We fluctuated between pride and jov
to disappointment. Todav, being at the same pool inay bring
back memories of those emotions."

fanner is also concerned about the effects the crowd may
have on the game. While Stanford is heavily favored to win,
Davis has been known for treating upsets in their home
pool.
"Davis always draws large crowds," Tanner said. "The de
sign ol the pool also places fans close to the* pool. In the past
a lot of top-ranked teams have lost partially due to the ( heel -
ing and emotion. We need to make sure we don't allow our
selves to fall prey to that."
I oday's game will also have special meaning for Stanford
juniors Dani Bell and Kris koblik. Bell's vounger sister,
Catherine, is one of Davis' main weapons that Stanford is
looking to shut down. Both Bell sisters are most known for
their powerful shots and are extremeh dangerous from the
outside.
"It's nice to see my sister and to play for family pride," Bell
said. " I he only people its hard for are my parents who aren't
sure who to cheer for."
Davis is Koblik's hometown. In high school she used to
play water polo and swim for the Davis coach, Jaime Wright.
She also trains with the Davis team during the summer, giv -
ing her an added insight to the Aggie players and their ca
pabilities.
After today's game, Stanford's next challenge w ill come at
the national qualifying tournament. The top seven finishers
of the tournament will qualify for national championships.
With the Cardinal's No. 1 rank it is almost certain that ii will
qualify to go.
Next weekend's tournament will also serve to decide the
seeding for nationals. Stanford is hoping to finish first and
hold on to its top rank to receive optimal seeding.
