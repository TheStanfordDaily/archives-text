exact timetable is still unknown.
The new center is "fabulous,"
raves Marie Karl of the Alumni
Office. I lie first floor will be de
voted completely to alumni with a
cafe, business center and large
hall for alumni functions. On the
second floor there will be offices
for the Alumni Association and
Office of Development.
These two branches, one focus
ing on fundraising and the other
on alumni relations, have been
separated in the past.. Alumni As

sociation officials hope the new
proximity of the offices will en
courage a new level of efficiency.
The CDC and the DRC have
both been in need of a new facili
ty for a long time. The CDC's old
building was considered unsafe
under the Santa Clara County
Un-reinforced Masonry Ordi
nance.
Housing the CDC and the
DRC together, and near the Haas
Center, seemed like the "perfect
plan" according to Joan Bisogno,
head of the DRC], since all three
organizations are geared towards
student services.
According to Robert Thirsk,
director of the CDC, no new pro

grams are being planned for the
new building, but the new space
will "offer more space to do the
programs we do much better."
There will be new conference
rooms and a more interactive set
ting.
"We've had wonderful support
from planning office and facili
ties," Bisogno said. She and other
members of the L)RC are "very
excited and optimistic."
Their current facility, on the
first floor of Meyer Library, is
small and inaccessible, Bisogno
said. She and the staff are looking
forward to "the flexibility of a new
building designed for the people
who are going to use it."
