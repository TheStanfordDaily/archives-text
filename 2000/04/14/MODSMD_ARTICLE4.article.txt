### MARISA PAVLIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
11l light <>rrecent criticism of Dr.
Camran Ne/liat, a voluntary c lini
cal liicultN member at tlie Stanford
Medical Center, and his brother
Dr. Fan Ne/liat, colleagues have
spoken out about the Ne/hats' con
fidence in their etliics and skills.
"People are missing the real
story here. People don't under
stand the dogged persecution of
these physicians In people with ul
terior motives," said Neurosurgery
Assoc. Prof . Lawrence Shuer. "The
hospital has investigated every alle
gation and not found anything to
question [the Ne/hats'| quality of
care."
Dr. Mark Vierra, a Medical
School assistant professor of
surgery, said that the criticism was
"a carefully orchestrated long
standing conspiracy of harass
ment."
Slniei said the Ne/hats were

"some of the most scrutinized sur
geons" who perform procedures
"on big I V screens with multiple
viewers."
Critics of the Ne/hats say the
doctors perform unnecessary pro
cedures and endanger their pa
tients.
Vierra said that the Ne/hats'
surgeiN skills are "the best in the
world. It's as simple as that."
Cam ran Ne/liat emigrated to
the I .S. in 15)7.'$ after graduating
from the I niversity of Teheran
Medical School. Ne/liat completed
a residency in obstetrics and gyne
cology at the State University of
New York at Buffalo. He complet
ed a two-year reproductive en
doc i inolog\ fellow ship at the Med
ical (College of Georgia in Augusta,
according to The San Francisco
(.luonicle.
Ne/liat built a practice specializ
ing in laparoscopic surgery, in
which an instrument is surgically
introduced into the abdomen for
diagnostic, curative or sterilization
purposes, at Atlanta's Northside
Hospital in the 1980's. Fan
Ne/.hat, his brother, is a laparo
scopic surgeon.
Colleagues respond
In response to allegations that
Camran Ne/hat has l>een operat
ing in areas outside his specialty,
Shuer said that in every single case,
Ne/.hat has worked with a surgeon
who specialized in the operation.
Shuer, who participated in the
investigation of Ne/.hat, said the al
legation that Ne/.hat purposefully
cut a patient's ureter, which con
nects the kidney and bladder, is "to
tally without basis."
"In all the investigations, there
was no problem with treatment or
research," he said. "The care ofour
patients is excellent and within the
standard of care."
Vierra said the criticism of the
Nezhats is motivated by profession
al jealousy and racism.
Other doctors "simply cannot
do what [Camran] does," he said.
"If you haven't seen him, you'd
never believe it."
Two of Camran Nezhat's critics

are Dr. Tom Margolis, a former
Stanford Medical School professor
and Dr. Nick Spirtos, another
member of the voluntary clinical
faculty at Stanford Medical Center.
Spirtos, a gynecological oncolo
gist, and Margolis, a gynecologist,
are partners at the Women's Can
cer Center, a private practice in
Palo Alto.
Vierra, who has known Caim an
Nezhat since 1992, has frequently
operated with him and published
two articles with him.
Vierra said the criticism was
"such a shock. Two of the hardest
working, finest physicians I know
are being hounded and hounded
and hounded."
He said Camran Nezhat "has to
operate like a bird has to fly. 1 le's a
true savant. He has a need to [op
erate] that is great and a talent that
is unique."
Vierra said that Camran
Nezhat's talent is evident from his
rise to prominence in Atlanta. "I le
was an Iranian gynecologist with a
thick accent in Atlanta at the height
of the Iran hostage crisis . . . How
much better than everyone else did
he have to be for people to be will
ing to go see him?"
Fugene Bauer, vice president of
the Medical Center, was unavail
able for comment.

Mullen Case
The allegations of controversial
practices originate from a case in
1988, when Camran Nezhat oper
ated on patient Stacey Mullen, who
was diagnosed with endometriosis.
Endometriosis is a painful disease
that occurs when the lining of the
uterus binds with other parts of the
abdominal cavity.
According to The San Francisco
Chronicle, in 1988 and 1991 Cam
ran Nezhat operated on Stacey
Mullen's endometriosis. After the
surgery, which involved pulling
her rectum out through her anus,
"part of her colon dropped out of
her body," according to The San
Francisco Chronicle. Later, Mullen
said she discovered that her pathol
ogy report showed no endometrio
sis on the wall of her rectum at all,
making the surgery unnecessary,
according to The Chronicle.
Walbert said that according to
the nurses' records, only an inch
and a half of Mullen's colon ex
tended through her anus. "It's not
an extraordinary event,"he said.
"It's easily addressed. The true
facts have been hysterically exag
gerated."
Walbert also said that Mullen
suffered fiom a case of infiltrated
endometriosis, meaning that the
damaged tissue was not superficial
and not easily detectable.
He said that Nezliat had "every
reason to l>elieve" that Mullen had
endometriosis. I le said the (I<m tor's
process was like* an appendectomy,
in which a doctor checks lor the
symptoms of the disease and makes
a decision to operate. Liter, the
pathology report shows whethei the
patient had an inflamed appendix.
Walbert added that the Nezhats
no longer conduct the "pull
through" procedure because new
stapling and suturing technological
advances have made it unneces
sary.
Unfounded allegations
James Neal, an Ohio lawyer
representing Mullen, accused the
Drs. Nezliat of several different
kinds of malpractice and miscon
duct.
He urged Stanford administra
tors to launch an investigation of
scientific misconduct inearU 1909.

In a lettei written l<> Neal in
late November 1999, Charles
Kruger, dean of reseat< li and
graduate policy, wrote that these
allegations "were without sub
stance and that a formal investiga
tion by Stanford was not (and is
not) warranted."
Neal also made these allega
tions to the Oeorgia Medical
Board, which initiated an investi
gation ol the I )i s. Nezliat at his re
<|tiesi.
I he board "determined there
was not evidence to support prose
cution for a violation of the Med
ical Practice Act" and closed the
case in Septeinbei 199 N.
A similar investigation per
formed by the Medical Hoard of
California of l)r. I an Nezliat was
also concluded at the same time
after 110 evidence of violation of the
Medical Practice Act was found.
I"he Department of Justice also
found no evidence of the billing
fraud alleged by Neal.

said.

Walbert said that he believes
that the most significant opinions

who know first hand of their prac

world."
Patient support
One recent patient of Caiman
Ne/hat said that after thorough re
seal cli, she decided to have Ne/hat
perform a high risk gynecological
surgery on her.
"Many doctors could not and
would not take this case," the pa
tient, who wished to remain
anonymous, said.
She said she consulted with
mail) nurses and was swayed In
their statements that they would
send themselves and their family
members to Ne/.hal.
She said she found the negative
press on the Ne/hats to be "very
upsetting because some [women |

won't ask to get w hat I got.
" I lie truth is that not a lot of
doctors could have touched me
and none could base done [the
surgei \ | as succ essfulh." said.
Records
Neal continued to request pa
tient records about other "pull
through" surgeries from Ne/hat.
According lo I lie Chronicle,
Ne/hat said it would violate patient
privac\ and disrupt his practice to
locate and turn ovei the records.
Walbert said that it's common foi a
doctor's filing svsteni to be orga
nized alphabetically, not In proce
dure.
Yierra said it would be unethi
cal for Ne/hat to release confiden
tial medical records. "I would
nevei ever turn over patient
records to anyone without ex
pi essed pel inissif >n ol tile patients
involved," he said. " I lie Medical
Board would take- me to task.
"Anvone can report anvone to
the Medical Board and it will be in
vestigated,"' Vierra said.

that for all the investigations,
"nothing lias been found. Kach

Dr. Fan Ne/liat, colleagues have
spoken out about the Ne/hats' con
fidence in their etliics and skills.
"People are missing the real
story here. People don't under
stand the dogged persecution of
these physicians In people with ul
terior motives," said Neurosurgery
Assoc. Prof . Lawrence Shuer. "The
hospital has investigated every alle
gation and not found anything to
question [the Ne/hats'| quality of

Dr. Mark Vierra, a Medical
School assistant professor of
surgery, said that the criticism was
"a carefully orchestrated long
standing conspiracy of harass
ment."
Slniei said the Ne/hats were

"some of the most scrutinized sur
geons" who perform procedures
"on big I V screens with multiple
viewers."
Critics of the Ne/hats say the
doctors perform unnecessary pro

Vierra said that the Ne/hats'

Ne/.hat, his brother, is a laparo

Colleagues respond
In response to allegations that
Camran Ne/hat has l>een operat
ing in areas outside his specialty,
Shuer said that in every single case,
Ne/.hat has worked with a surgeon
who specialized in the operation.
Shuer, who participated in the
investigation of Ne/.hat, said the al
legation that Ne/.hat purposefully
cut a patient's ureter, which con
nects the kidney and bladder, is "to
tally without basis."
"In all the investigations, there
was no problem with treatment or
research," he said. "The care ofour
patients is excellent and within the
standard of care."
Vierra said the criticism of the
Nezhats is motivated by profession
al jealousy and racism.
Other doctors "simply cannot
do what [Camran] does," he said.
"If you haven't seen him, you'd
never believe it."
Two of Camran Nezhat's critics

are Dr. Tom Margolis, a former
Stanford Medical School professor
and Dr. Nick Spirtos, another
member of the voluntary clinical
faculty at Stanford Medical Center.
Spirtos, a gynecological oncolo
gist, and Margolis, a gynecologist,
are partners at the Women's Can
cer Center, a private practice in
Palo Alto.
Vierra, who has known Caim an
Nezhat since 1992, has frequently
operated with him and published
two articles with him.
Vierra said the criticism was
"such a shock. Two of the hardest
working, finest physicians I know
are being hounded and hounded
and hounded."
He said Camran Nezhat "has to
operate like a bird has to fly. 1 le's a
true savant. He has a need to [op
erate] that is great and a talent that
is unique."
Vierra said that Camran
Nezhat's talent is evident from his
rise to prominence in Atlanta. "I le
was an Iranian gynecologist with a
thick accent in Atlanta at the height
of the Iran hostage crisis . . . How
much better than everyone else did
he have to be for people to be will
ing to go see him?"
Fugene Bauer, vice president of
the Medical Center, was unavail
able for comment.

Mullen Case
The allegations of controversial
practices originate from a case in
1988, when Camran Nezhat oper
ated on patient Stacey Mullen, who
was diagnosed with endometriosis.
Endometriosis is a painful disease
that occurs when the lining of the
uterus binds with other parts of the
abdominal cavity.
According to The San Francisco
Chronicle, in 1988 and 1991 Cam
ran Nezhat operated on Stacey
Mullen's endometriosis. After the
surgery, which involved pulling
her rectum out through her anus,
"part of her colon dropped out of
her body," according to The San
Francisco Chronicle. Later, Mullen
said she discovered that her pathol
ogy report showed no endometrio
sis on the wall of her rectum at all,
making the surgery unnecessary,
according to The Chronicle.
Walbert said that according to
the nurses' records, only an inch
and a half of Mullen's colon ex
tended through her anus. "It's not
an extraordinary event,"he said.
"It's easily addressed. The true
facts have been hysterically exag
gerated."
Walbert also said that Mullen
suffered fiom a case of infiltrated
endometriosis, meaning that the
damaged tissue was not superficial
and not easily detectable.
He said that Nezliat had "every
reason to l>elieve" that Mullen had
endometriosis. I le said the (I<m tor's
process was like* an appendectomy,
in which a doctor checks lor the
symptoms of the disease and makes
a decision to operate. Liter, the
pathology report shows whethei the
patient had an inflamed appendix.
Walbert added that the Nezhats
no longer conduct the "pull
through" procedure because new
stapling and suturing technological
advances have made it unneces
sary.
Unfounded allegations
James Neal, an Ohio lawyer
representing Mullen, accused the
Drs. Nezliat of several different
kinds of malpractice and miscon
duct.
He urged Stanford administra
tors to launch an investigation of
scientific misconduct inearU 1909.

In a lettei written l<> Neal in
late November 1999, Charles
Kruger, dean of reseat< li and
graduate policy, wrote that these
allegations "were without sub
stance and that a formal investiga
tion by Stanford was not (and is
not) warranted."
Neal also made these allega

Board, which initiated an investi

I he board "determined there

case in Septeinbei 199 N.

I he Ne/hats "get sent the hard

tremendous results. I'm not sure if
anvone else could do it. Walbert
said.

Walbert said that he believes

who know first hand of their prac

seal cli, she decided to have Ne/hat
perform a high risk gynecological
surgery on her.
"Many doctors could not and
would not take this case," the pa
tient, who wished to remain
anonymous, said.
She said she consulted with
mail) nurses and was swayed In
their statements that they would
send themselves and their family
members to Ne/.hal.
She said she found the negative
press on the Ne/hats to be "very
upsetting because some [women |

won't ask to get w hat I got.
" I lie truth is that not a lot of
doctors could have touched me
and none could base done [the
surgei \ | as succ essfulh." said.
Records
Neal continued to request pa
tient records about other "pull
through" surgeries from Ne/hat.
According lo I lie Chronicle,
Ne/hat said it would violate patient
privac\ and disrupt his practice to
locate and turn ovei the records.
Walbert said that it's common foi a
doctor's filing svsteni to be orga

that for all the investigations,
"nothing lias been found. Kach
