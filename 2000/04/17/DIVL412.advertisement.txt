Woman Changes
Her Name to
"Stanford Fed CU"
to Honor Credit Union
"Its hard to get used to so my
close friends still call me
Ivonne."
The member formerly known as
Ivonne Ortega lias had such positive
experiences with Stanford Federal Credit
Union that she is considering changing
her name. At the age ol IS she got her
first loan from the Credit Union —co-
signed by her mother. After a year of
establishing a good credit pattern, she
refinanced the loan in her own name.
"Credit Unions are so much better
[than banks]' They're non-profit, unlike
banks that try to take your money for fees
and extra charges.The Credit Union is
simple and easy—and they're a great deal!
1 got a really good rate on my new car"
says (the former) Ms. Ortega
She is concerned about the reaction
of others to her new name, however anil
feels that it may be a tough adjustment for
family and friends.
