## Thousands protest IMF meetings in Washington, D.C. 
### 
•WASHINGTON (AP) —
Thousands of marchers failed to
stop world finance leaders from
meeting yesterday, but paraded
through the capital in a show of
celebration and anger that pro
voked one ugly episode — a surg
ing crowd met by a stinging cloud
of irritants fired In police.
Festive street theater with giant
puppets coexisted with pushy
confrontations between police and
protesters agitating about the
plight of the poor and the "deca
dence" of the rich.
At one point, police in riot gear
and 011 motorcycles charged into a
crowd that had surged toward the
police line. Police used pepper
spray and what they said were
smoke bombs to drive back the
protesters, who were convinced
they'd been tear-gassed.
"Coughing, burning, numbness
around the mouth, eyes watering,
skin irritated," said John Hamilton,
one of the protesters. "It was dear
ly a chemical irritant."
But unlike the protests that
overwhelmed police and smashed
windows in rainy Seattle at trade
meetings late last year, the week
end demonstrations were largely
nonviolent —and the sun beamed
on them yesterday.
"I've seen a whole lot less prop
erty damage than after a Bulls
game in Chicago," said Han Shan,
a protest organizer fioni the San
Francisco-based group Ruckus.
Police in America's security
savvy capital accomplished their
No. I objective, sending buses
under the cover of early morning

darkness to pick up world finance
ministers at their hotels — and
using circuitous routes and U-turns
to get them to work.
But some VIPs were stranded:
The finance ministers of France,
Brazil and Thailand were thwarted
. by the crowds arid sat at the Water
gate Hotel five hours after the
meetings started, wondering what
to do. They eventually made it to
the spring meeting of the Interna
tional Monetary Fund.
"I think there is a great misun
derstanding," French Finance Min
ister Laurent Fabius said.
Police, who estimated as many as
1 (),()()() protesters were on the
streets, blocked off about a 50-block
area of downtown but let demon
strators largely have their way out
side the security /one.
Shan credited police with being
relatively restrained, if suffocating
in the size of their force. "Overall,
they maintained their composure
quite a bit," he said. "They have
brutalized a few people without
provocation."
The atmosphere was less tense
than on Saturday, when police
raided and closed the protest head
quarters (luring the day and arrest
ed more than (>()() people in the
evening.
Fewer than 20 were arrested
yesterday, said Terry Gainer, exec
utive assistant police chief. I le said
two police officers were hospital
ized, one with back pain and anoth
er from heat exhaustion.
In a day that began with a driz
zle but turned nice, the protesters
chanted, beat on plastic buckets

and wore big papier-mache puppet
heads cast in the likeness of the
leaders they hold in contempt.
It was all meant to disrupt the
World Bank and IMF meetings
being held yesterday and today.
But the anger sprang from a
bazaar of causes, everything from
human rights atrocities in Ethiopia
to the "prison industrial complex"
and biotechnology in food.
"Keep your genes out of our
beans," said one T-shirt.
"In all your decadence people
die," said a sign.
Protesters were united in accus
ing the World Bank and IMF of
burdening poor countries with
crushing debt payments, unsafe
food, environmental destruction
and sweatshops. They said the insti
tutions let wealthy countries set an
agenda that "saps the poor to fatten
the rich," as Jobs with justice put it.
Responded Michael Moore,
director general of the World
Trade Organization: "Blaming the
World Bank for poverty is a bit like
blaming the Red Cross for starting
World Wars I and II."
Moore, an observer at these
meetings, had witnessed far more
destructive behavior in Seattle late
last year, when bands of demon
strators trashed property and tens
of thousands of marchers over
whelmed police.
While protesters linked arms to
block intersections near the World
Bank and IMF buildings, they
mainly succeeded in keeping out
people such as private security
guard Robert Covington, of
Forestville, Md. "This is ridicu

lous," he said. "All 1 want to do is go
to work."
A group of demonstrators, some
holding sections of chain link fence,
charged toward motorcycle police
and an anti-riot squad dressed .ill in
black.
Police counterattacked with
clubs and six to nine vol lews of irri
tants, according to .Associated Press
radio reporter Ross Simpson, who

was both c lubbed and sprayed.
Stunned demonstrators were
dragged awa\ by their friends and
taken to medical teams standing In
with jugs of water to flush eyes.
Protesters thought they were
tear-gassed but Police Chief
Charles Ramsev said "smoke drag
ons" were used, canisters contain
ing less severe irritants.
I le said homemade versions of

pepper spray were used against
police, and some officers were hit
bv stones and bottles, but none seri
ously hurt.
Washington Mayor Tony
Williams said, "Whenever you're
dealing with a situation like this
you're going to be up on the
boundaiA line in terms of constitu
tional rights. But our police have to
do their job."

World Wars I and II."
Moore, an observer at these
meetings, had witnessed far more
destructive behavior in Seattle late
last year, when bands of demon
strators trashed property and tens
of thousands of marchers over
whelmed police.
While protesters linked arms to
block intersections near the World
Bank and IMF buildings, they
mainly succeeded in keeping out
people such as private security
guard Robert Covington, of
Forestville, Md. "This is ridicu

lous," he said. "All 1 want to do is go
to work."
A group of demonstrators, some
holding sections of chain link fence,
charged toward motorcycle police
and an anti-riot squad dressed .ill in
black.
Police counterattacked with
clubs and six to nine vol lews of irri
tants, according to .Associated Press
radio reporter Ross Simpson, who

was both c lubbed and sprayed.
Stunned demonstrators were
dragged awa\ by their friends and
taken to medical teams standing In
with jugs of water to flush eyes.
Protesters thought they were
tear-gassed but Police Chief
Charles Ramsev said "smoke drag
ons" were used, canisters contain
ing less severe irritants.
I le said homemade versions of

pepper spray were used against
police, and some officers were hit
bv stones and bottles, but none seri
ously hurt.
Washington Mayor Tony
Williams said, "Whenever you're
dealing with a situation like this
you're going to be up on the
boundaiA line in terms of constitu
tional rights. But our police have to
do their job."
