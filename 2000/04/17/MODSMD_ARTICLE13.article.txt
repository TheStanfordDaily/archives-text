# Gore, Clinton attend gathering in Hollywood
## 
### 
PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP)-Al Gore is no Bill
Clinton when it conies to working a crowd and
making political testimonials.
Searching for something nice to say about his
boss. Gore came up with this Saturday night:
"()f all the good things 1 could say about Pres
ident Bill Clinton ... 1 could tell you about the
many, many times when 1 have seen him —
especially in the early years — nearly buckle
under the pressure of this office," Gore said.
"But never do so."
Gore also recalled "all the criticisms of Bill
(llinton that I've heard" and concluded that "the
one that rings the most hollow is that he has
pushed small ideas, little proposals. They just
haven't been paying attention."
It was a pair of strikingly backhanded com
pliments that caught attention on a star-studded
night in Beverly 11 ills.
When ii came his turn to speak, Clinton took
a more effusive approach about Gore. He said

the man who hopes to succeed him as president
is "the most qualified person in my lifetime to
seek ibis job." The president said Gore's election
would validate the direction of Clinton's own
presidency.
Clinton and Gore came together at a glitzy
gathering of 1 lollywood stars for a $2.8 million
Democratic fundraiser. It was their first joint
appearance in more than four months and it
brought out actors Kevin Spacey, Whoopi Gold
berg, Jimmy Smits, Kim Delaney, Rene Russo,
Edward James Olmos and Antonio Banderas.
Singers Sarah McLachlan and Sheryl Crow were
there; so was Jay Leno.
Gore was the leadoff speaker and immediate
ly plunged into a heavy reminiscence of his dis
illusionment with politics as a young man after
Vietnam, Watergate and the assassinations of
Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy. After
years as a reporter, he said, he decided to jump
into the political arena to see if he could make a

difference.
The vice president said lie and Clinton had
faced down special interests, turned huge bud
get deficits into big surpluses and transformed a
recession-scat ted econonn into the strongest
boom in America's history.
Following (.ore to the stage, Clinton put the
audience in his pocket with a quick joke.
Clinton said he bad asked Core if there was
anything special he should say. "lie said, noth
ing special, just get up there and say, 'Washing
ton, Lincoln. Roosevelt, Core."
From his seat, Core reminded Clinton that
he had amended that remark. "He said, 'Ob
yeah, put Clinton in there somewhere," the
president said.
Core has suffered in comparison with Clin
ton before. The vice president conies off as still
in public and wooden in public speaking, a dra
matic contrast with Clinton, who ranks with
Ronald Reagan as a great communicator.
