want te) get in our way."
Angora called on God to
"reduce to ashes" the Castro
government.
Elian played in the sun and
raced with other children. His

ington.
Both sides are waiting lor a
response from a federal appeals
coin! in Atlanta, which issued a
teniporarv injunction Thursday

country. That order defused a
tense standoff when Lazaro
Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle,
refused the government's
•demand to hand over the boy.
I lie government wants the
appeals court lo suspend the
injunction and order Lazaro
Gonzalez, to release Elian so he
can return with his father to
(aiba. fhe relatives want the
court to let them meet with
Elian's father without being
required to let Elian go.

meeting with the boy's Cuban
grandmothers, told ABC's "This
Week" that the family will meet
with the father but is concerned
about t'.uhan influence.
" fhe fiiniih is prepared te> go
anvwhere at this point where
adult members can speak, come
te> grips, if the\ have to yell and
scream, and perhaps end with a
reconciliation and healing."
O'Laughlin said yesterday.
"Holy Week could be the time
to ele> this."
