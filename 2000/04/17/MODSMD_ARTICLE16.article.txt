## The 						Stanford Daily Lower admission rate doesn't solve housing issues 
### 
AT FRIDAY'S FACULTY Senate
meeting, members of the Graduate
Student Council aired complaints
about the University's lack of
progress in addressing the ongoing housing
shortage, including claims that "new" living
spaces have been generated by placing stu
dents in living rooms of existing apartments
and temporary spaces.
President Casper's response that the hous
ing crunch will persist as long as departments
continue to admit master's and doctoral stu
dents at current rates raises important ques
tions about what kinds of considerations are
and should be relevant in admissions.
Casper noted that, over the last several

years, academic departments have created
new master's programs and increased admis
sion rates without considering the broader
effects of bringing more students to Stanford,
which include having to find housing for
them. Given this observation, he stressed the
importance of collaborative efforts between
University administration and academic
departments to ensure that growth does not
worsen the housing problem.
Although Casper's advocacy of greater com
munication and coordination between Univer
sity housing officials and academic depart
ments is sensible, the University should make
efforts to present a more balanced agenda for
addressing the problem of housing graduate

students. Indeed, the University does have a
plan in place to increase housing, but ii must
pursue this plan more vigorously and brain
storm other approaches to create new housing
rather than rely 011 departments to cut back on
graduate admission. Admissions cutbacks
should only be a very short-term solution, if a
solution at all.
It makes little sense for the University to
emphasize decreased admissions as part of a
long-term solution. This would merely shift
the blame for expensive housing from Bay
Area markets to academic departments. While
departments certainly need to take care to
consider a broad range of factors in c reating
new programs, the University should immedi

ately devote time and resources to building
more housing so that academic departments
have the freedom to develop more quality pro
grams as they see fit.
As a University renowned for research, it
would make more sense for Stanford to retain
graduate students, who are at the center of
new research and scholarship. Even though
master's programs are not as research-based as
doctoral programs, tlie University in general
should not look to limiting graduate programs
to handle problems in other domains.
Ultimately, Stanford should work to reach a
point at which the problem of housing stu
dents ceases to hinder the growth of new and
existing graduate programs.
