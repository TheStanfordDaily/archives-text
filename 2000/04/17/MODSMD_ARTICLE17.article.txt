# WHAT THE HECK I'M TALKING ABOUT
## Grade school elections 
### 
Sometime last week I was sitting in
the bathroom stall (keep leading,
keep reading), entertaining myself
with the pretty multi-colored
paper and the catchy slogans of the ASS I'
election flyers adorning the walls in front
of me, when, suddenly, I careened into a
flashback.
I was back in seventh grade, running
for the esteemed (and highly competitive)
position of "Publicity Chair." Second in
popularity only to the "Student Council

President," whose priv
ileges included pound
ing the gavel and dele
gating each council
member's snack day,
publicity chair was in
charge of the pinnacle
of grammar-school
fame — morning
announcements.
Mr. Klee, our

eighth-grade teacher, tried his dat ndest to
he the innovative, power-to-the-peo pie
type. I led come np with the brilliant idea
<>l making the announcements on video
instead of the PA system the next year. It
was to he a tinning point in the history of
St. Anastasia School — something akin to
the millennium, or the dot-coin revolu
tion, if yon will. I wanted to he remem
bered as the publicity ( hair who was there
when the announcements went video.
After what must have been weeks of
primary elections between the slew of kids
who sought the same glory as I, ii nar
rowed down to me and a girl named
Sarah Norton. I enlisted the help of my
best friend Briann as campaign manager.
Focus groups with our classmates proved
that a country-Western, hillbilly theme
was our best bet.
This was partially due to the fact that 1
had mastered the ability to draw Yosemite
Sam — my campaign posters showed him
jumping up and shooting bis pellet gun.
"YII'FF! KRICA FOR PUBLICITY!" was
the official campaign slogan.
When it came to the big day, Sarah and
I shook hands before the big show and
took opposite sides of the stage. (Actually,
our Church doubled as an auditorium so
the "stage" was technically the altar — but
anyway.)
Sarah went first. She was a striking
character with bright red hair and she
wore a long, silky red dress and tiara. The
speaker system started up some back
ground music, Sarah took a deep breath
and belted out a song in high soprano. I
think it was to the tunc of "Keep Your Fye
011 the Crand Old Flag," only she said
"screen" instead of "flag." She brought the

house down. Who knew she'd been taking
voice lessons since she could walk?
Then, it was all me. I stretched out and
leaned over into my practiced hillbilly
horse-handler walk. Briann took the cue
and fired up "Home on the Range." 1
sashayed in front of the altar in my straw
hat, pigtails and overalls, chewing straw.
Altera few lines of introduction, I went
into my own song and dance, significantly
less talented than Sarah's, but peppered
with winning humor. I specifically
remember rhyming something with "dia
per" and something with "dirty teeth."
Second graders were voting, too — toilet
humor was a shoo-in.
But more convincing than my knee
slapping humor and my well-chosen
props (who can forget horse-on-a-stic k),
was my focus on the issues. I promised
entertaining and pertinent morning
announcements, complete with a daily
surf report, a new joke every day and cur
rent events updates (perfect for recess or
lunchtime conversation).
Needless to say, I was voted in In a
healthy majority. We started oil strong the
next year with video announcements. I
c hec ked for the surf report each morning
by phone, found a gracle-A joke every day
and read the paper for top headlines.
I lien, I got to school bv 7:30 a.m. to set
up and did a live broadcast.
Perfection lasted five, maybe seven
clays. Soon, Mr. Klee was reprimanded
for starting class half an hour late every
day because of post-production. We start
ed filming the afternoon before for the
next day's announcements. We lost our
edge. Surf reports weren't ready by then.
I ran out of jokes. Nobody cared about
Boutrous-Boutrous (lliali.
Sigh. Well, in middle school, it was fair
ly acceptable for the issues to get lost in the
haze of operetta and hick renditions.
There wasn't much we could change any
way under the iron fist of our Student
Council moderator, who doubled as the
school principal.
But I've been glad to see a largely
issues-based campaign getting underway
this year in the ASSU elections, especially
in the presidential slates. Everyone likes
good entertainment — myself included.
The author of a fluff column can't say
much against a fluff campaign. But I'm
glad someone's taking Stanford seriously
this time around. Leave the fluff to the
hillbilly publicity chairs of the world.
