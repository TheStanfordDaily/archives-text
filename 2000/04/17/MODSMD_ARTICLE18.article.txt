ASSU leaders support Newton/Villegas
As ASS I officials, past and present, we
know what it takes for a successful ASSU
Presidency. Set 11 Newton and Malia Ville
gas have that and something more.
112 Rom their extensive experience, both
within the ASSU and outside the ASSU in
various student organizations, Seth and
Malia have proven their commitment to
the Stanford student hody. Their ability to
bring diverse groups of students together
has culminated in the Platform for
Accountability and Change (PAC), a truly
grassroots effort that boasts nearly 100
active student volunteers. As ASSU Presi
dent and Vice President, Seth and Malia
will bring these diverse groups of students
into the ASSU, ensuring that as many
Stanford students as possible have a voice
in decision-making at the University.
Throughout the campaign, Seth and
Malia have been honest about their past
accomplishments and cleat about their
vision for the Stanford student body. ()n a
personal level, Seth and Malia are gen
uine people, driven by their values and
not their resumes. They have the proven
ability to take a stand on the issues facing
students, while, at the same time, listening
to and respecting opposing views. They
will bring all of these qualities to their roles
as ASSU President and Vice President.
We urge the Stanford student body to
join us in supporting Seth Newton and
Malia Villegas for ASSU President and
Vice President. On April 19 and 20, cast
your vote for something more — the Plat
limn for Accountability and Change.

Liu and Dudas conducting
dishonest campaign
As someone who has worked closely
with the ASSU for some time, especially
with Maren Norton and Mike Levin, 1 fol
low campus issues quite closely. As I was
browsing the online handbook recently, I
ran across the platform for Ben Liu and
Mike Dudas.
What I read shocked and concerned
me. The items that Liu and Dudas are
claiming to have accomplished in many
cases had nothing to do with either of

them. The items cited are projects and
programs instituted, in some cases, before
Liti and Dudas were even with the ASSL.
For example, if you look at the candi
dates' handbook entry at
http://election.stanford.edu/handbc >ok/AS
SU_President_and_Vice_President/Ben
Liu_and_Mike_Dudas/ and look in the
table about halfway down the page, enti
tled, "What we have accomplished, what
we will accomplish" you will see:
1) Helped launch Stanford After Mid
night. I worked closely with those individ
uals responsible for the creation and
inception of this initiative. Norton and
Levin have been fighting to- improve
Tresidder for two years. Liu and Dudas
have played almost no part, which I can
attest to first hand, other than in one
instance when Dudas booked a concert. 1
believe that does not constitute the claim
that improving Tresidder, according to
Liu and Dudas, is "what we did."
2) Post Office Reform. Steven
Aronowitz arranged the Post Office
Forum, while Ty Clevenger and Mike
Levin were behind the campaign that fol
lowed. Michael Osofsky was responsible
for the discovery of mail being thrown
away. Liu and Dudas did far less than
their platform implies. Again, their c laims
go far beyond their actual involvement.
3) Make ASSU a Resource for all Stu
dent Groups and Improve Student
Group Funding Process. This is a topic
about which 1 sal in on many conversa
tions'between Norton, Levin and a few
others (not including Liu and Dudas) as

far back us winter and spring quarters of
1998. 11 lis was long before Levin was
elected and significantly before l.iu and
Dudas could have been involved. Most of
the implementation of this was completed
by Levin and Mills, and Norton before
them. In terms of meeting 100 percent of
funding requests and shortening turn
around time, Adam Weiss, programming
director, and Nautnan Khan, banking
direc tor, took responsibility and should be
given credit lor this. How can Liu and
Hildas take credit for things that hap
pened belore they were even part of the
student representative bod\?
4) Student Voice. Main of these ideas
were presented In Steven Aronowit/, sen
ate chair, and augmented by the I nder
graduate Senate. I he koble I heater Pro
posal has been driven by Aronowit/ from
the beginning. Liu took it upon himself to
make this an issue of his onlv after
Aronowit/ had laid significant ground
work. In regards to student outreach revi
tali/ation. anvone who has followed the
ASSI and/or I he Hailv for the last two
vears should know without c|iiestion that
Norton, Marroc|iiin, Levin, Mills and
Aronowit/ deserve 99 percent of the credit
lor these actions. As far as lobbying to get
student members on the Presidential
Search Committee, I know for a fact who
initiated this, as I was driving with Levin
;iikl James Montoya to dinner one evening
when the dialogue on this began. Liu and
Hildas have had absolutely nothing to do
with this. Although they did play a role in
helping accomplish some of the overarch
ing goals of ASSL communication. I.in and
Hildas should not take c redit for the ideas
and work the\ had a minimal role in.
.">) Create Stanford I raditions/ Pro
gramming. Hudas played a significant
role in the I rcsidder Concert series,
which proved somewhat unsuccessful.
I lowever, I am a believer in giving credit
when clue, so I include this note. In
regards to working with c lass presidents to
foster class unity, I ;isk 1 .in and Hildas: can
examples be provided? I continual!) hear
complaints from class presidents about
relations with the ASSI . Most believe
l here are none. I he ASSI has made great
strides in representation, but not every
thing is perfect as of yet. (claiming to have
accomplished things that haven't

occurred undermines the candidates'
credibility and that of the ASSU as well.
(')) Improved Housing and Dining and
initiated the Draw Cuicle. Hie Draw
(iuide was the brain child of Rita Leung in
1997-98. I know personally the two indi
viduals responsible for the project in
1998-99. And in 1999-2000, freshman
Henry lowsner worked to improve the
Draw Cuicle. Considering that Liu was
deputv chair of the senate and lowsner
was a senate associate, one would think
Liu would have played a larger role. As
for the Stanford F.ating Clubs, Levin and
Mills worked closely with Keith Gu\ of
Housing and Dining to save the F.ating
Clubs starting over the summer — when
neither Liu or Dudas was even around.
7) New Student Space. The founding
of the Roble Theater Working Croup to
get additional performing arts space was
nearly entirely the work of Aronowit/. As
far as opening meeting space in Tresicl
cler. this was part of the Stanford After
Midnight Program, detailed above.
8) Graduate Student Rights. I know for
a fact that Liu and Dudas have had mini
mal meaningful interaction with the CSC.
Caring about graduate students is not an
option — as Mills especially, and Levin,
Norton and Marroquin have exemplified.
It appalls me that Liu and Dudas take
credit for addressing issues of which the\
have only limited comprehension.
9) More transportation Options. Liu
and Dudas did sit on the Freshman
I ranspoi tation Task Force, although,
from many personal interactions, 1 can
verify Aronowit/ was the driving force.
10) Student Led Review of the Advis
ing System. This was the work of the
I nclergi acluate Senate Academics,
Research and F.val nation (ARK) commit
tee, of which Ashok Redely was chair. The
ASSI Leaching Awards have not even
been given out ibis year, and the process
for selection has not even begun. When it
does begin. Redely will probably lt-iicl the
project as chair of ARF.
I will briefly review the "What we will
accomplish" section of their platform.
1) I lie light for a new student union
was initiated bv Levin and Mills, and, with
the assistance of a Daily editorial, mention
of the new union wound up in the Com
munis Plan. Liu and Hildas should not
hope to claim responsibility for starting
this process, as their platform intimates.
2) Post Office Reform. Again these are
ideas that were brought to the forefront
bv Clevenger, Levin and Osofskv — ideas

lhat many Stanford students before them
have advocated.
IS) Work with SSK to bring ASSU hank
ing online. I am familiar with the current
effort to bring student group banking
online. The ASM has been dealing with
this lor two years. When it is accom
plished, ii would be completely wrong for
Liu and Dudas to take credit for it. The
real credit goes to Financial Managers
Matt (lai linghouse and Sean Lucy, as well
as the ASS I / SSL Web Feam.
4) Further streamline the funding pro
cedure; make the ASSU more accessible;
help support ethnic and community
groups. I would hope that this is some
what obvious for any ASSL leadership.
Their statement on this issue, like so many
others, lacks vision.
5) Student(s) 011 the Board of Trustees.
Though I personally disagree with some
of the former ASSI administration mem
bers ou this issue, Liu and Dudas have
shown (at least to me) ver\ little interest in
regards to this topic prior to election time.
6) Traditions and the Big (lame Bon
fire. Is this Fmily Audi us all over again?
I bis is simplv a sensationalist, reasonably
unaccomplishable goal, especially consid
ering Stanford's commitment to the envi
ronment. Fin all for a fire, but there are
bigger fish to fry than a bonfire, and say
ing this simplv to gather support is some
what sad.
7) Create more campus events to
increase unity and pride. 1 his is very
much the role of class presidents and not
of the ASSU. This is also very vague.
8) 1 lousing and Dining and University
meal plans. Given the failed attempts at
much of this already, and the fact that a
campaign platform should be a general
statement of position, it's interesting that
again Liu and Dudas seem to be pic king
extremelv small things to focus on. Addi
tionally the president and vice president
should not focus on "issues' that don't
affect the whole student body.
9) transportation Options. It seems
strange, as evidenced In the April 7. 2000,
issue of 1 lie Dailv ("Frosli car plan
unveiled"), to set your platform on some
thing that has already been completed
(rental cars, expanded Marguerite).
Again, Liu and Dudas seem to be trying to
use sensationalist tac tic s to get elected.
By campaigning and c laiming to have
done things the) are not at all responsible
for, I believe Liu and Dudas are doing a
great disservice to the ASSU, to the Stan
ford student bodv and to the Stanford

community as a whole. Any candidates
whose platform is based on dishonesty
and a lack of integrity cannot be a good
choice for ASSU leadership in the future.
Both Norton and Levin's administra
tions have done a great job of strengthen
ing the ASSU's ability to represent student
needs in the greater Stanford picture.
Norton, Marroquin, Levin and Mills
understood the great importance and
responsibility of their offices — in many
cases sacrificing their academic careers to
serve the student body. 1 somehow don't
see this coming from Liu and Dudas.
I strongly believe that Liu and Dudas
will undermine much of the progress that
has been made. I cannot believe that c an
didates for such .in important office would
even consider running on such a platform
of inconsistency, misdirection and some
times outright lies.

Insufficient coverage of Cesar Chavez
Commemoration in The Daily
(liven the significance of the seventh
annual Cesar Chavez Commemoration
Fvent and its massive turnout of people
that tilled every seat in Kresge Auditori
um, we were greatly disturbed bv the bad
coverage — or lac k of coverage — of this
event bv The Daily. Although this particu
lar snub by 1 he Daily was highly upset
ting, it is no surprise. Over the course of
the year, this paper has consistently
offended the minority community at Stan
lord University by not providing sufficient
coverage of their most significant events,
t he Dailv failed to give any coverage
whatsoever to the recent Amadou Diallo
rally, where a diverse crowd of more than
200 students, faculty and staff gathered to
protest police brutality.
1 his year, concerning Islam Awareness
Week, Stanford Women's Rugby (the
defending national champions) and Black
Liberation Month, I lie Daily provided
very insufficient coverage. In fact, the only
picture posted for Black Liberation
Month stereotypic ally showed black stu
dents eating fried chicken. Similarly, the
onl) photo printed for the Cesar Chavez
(ominenioration featured two Latino stu
dents on stage crew doing stage work with
no mention of the event in the caption.
I liese incidents serve as an injustice to

all because The Daily has shown the cam
pus that Stanford's own newspaper does
not care about minority issues. liy ignor
ing these issues, The Daily has implied
that minority events are not newsworthy,
when, in fact, 1 he Daily lias the responsi
bility to cover affairs that affect the entire
Stanford community.
We no longer will accept the injustice
that has been done to our minority com
munity by our student newspaper. We
demand more and better coverage of
these events that are certainly newsworthy
enough to grace the pages of The Daily.
