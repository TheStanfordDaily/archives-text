ASSU leaders support Newton/Villegas
As ASS I officials, past and present, we
know what it takes for a successful ASSU
Presidency. Set 11 Newton and Malia Ville
gas have that and something more.
112 Rom their extensive experience, both
within the ASSU and outside the ASSU in
various student organizations, Seth and
Malia have proven their commitment to
the Stanford student hody. Their ability to
bring diverse groups of students together
has culminated in the Platform for
Accountability and Change (PAC), a truly
grassroots effort that boasts nearly 100
active student volunteers. As ASSU Presi
dent and Vice President, Seth and Malia
will bring these diverse groups of students
into the ASSU, ensuring that as many
Stanford students as possible have a voice
in decision-making at the University.
Throughout the campaign, Seth and
Malia have been honest about their past
accomplishments and cleat about their
vision for the Stanford student body. ()n a
personal level, Seth and Malia are gen
uine people, driven by their values and
not their resumes. They have the proven
ability to take a stand on the issues facing
students, while, at the same time, listening
to and respecting opposing views. They
will bring all of these qualities to their roles
as ASSU President and Vice President.
We urge the Stanford student body to
join us in supporting Seth Newton and
Malia Villegas for ASSU President and
Vice President. On April 19 and 20, cast
your vote for something more â€” the Plat
limn for Accountability and Change.

Liu and Dudas conducting
dishonest campaign
As someone who has worked closely
with the ASSU for some time, especially
with Maren Norton and Mike Levin, 1 fol
low campus issues quite closely. As I was
browsing the online handbook recently, I
ran across the platform for Ben Liu and
Mike Dudas.
What I read shocked and concerned
me. The items that Liu and Dudas are
claiming to have accomplished in many
cases had nothing to do with either of

them. The items cited are projects and
programs instituted, in some cases, before
Liti and Dudas were even with the ASSL.
For example, if you look at the candi
dates' handbook entry at
http://election.stanford.edu/handbc >ok/AS
SU_President_and_Vice_President/Ben
Liu_and_Mike_Dudas/ and look in the
table about halfway down the page, enti
tled, "What we have accomplished, what
we will accomplish" you will see:
1) Helped launch Stanford After Mid
night. I worked closely with those individ
uals responsible for the creation and
inception of this initiative. Norton and
Levin have been fighting to- improve
Tresidder for two years. Liu and Dudas
have played almost no part, which I can
attest to first hand, other than in one
instance when Dudas booked a concert. 1
believe that does not constitute the claim
that improving Tresidder, according to
Liu and Dudas, is "what we did."
2) Post Office Reform. Steven
Aronowitz arranged the Post Office
Forum, while Ty Clevenger and Mike
Levin were behind the campaign that fol
lowed. Michael Osofsky was responsible
for the discovery of mail being thrown
away. Liu and Dudas did far less than
their platform implies. Again, their c laims
go far beyond their actual involvement.
3) Make ASSU a Resource for all Stu
dent Groups and Improve Student
Group Funding Process. This is a topic
about which 1 sal in on many conversa

others (not including Liu and Dudas) as
