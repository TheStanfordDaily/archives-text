bate student housing issues and how to give students
more of a voice in University policy.
Juniors Seth Newton, presidential candidate, and
vice-presidential candidate Malia Villegas represent
ed the "Platform for Accountability and Change."
They debated juniors Ben Liu, presidential hopeful,
and vice-presidential candidate Mike Dudas, repre
senting the "Students First" platform.
"We have a vision of a Stanford and an ASSL that
puts students first," said Liu, currently the ASS I cleputx
senate chair. "We have six major priorities to increase
student voice." Liu said his platform plans to create a
better Tresidder Union and create a student resource
center for campus groups.
The group also said they wanted to increase com
munication between student groups, work on post of-

fice reform, im
prove graduate
student life and
strengthen Stan
ford traditions.

Liu and Dudas said tlic-v believe their "experience
and meaningful accomplishments" make them quali
fied to be ASSL president and vice president next
year.
Newton responded bv first explaining whv he and
Villegas decided to run for the presidency.
"Three months ago, student groups came up to us
and s;iid they were unhapp\ with the experience of
the ASSL," Newton said. "We want to increase the
power of the student voice, because it's way under
represented."
Villegas said their platform will use theii experi

dent involvement. She said the
platform was developed by a col
lective group of students with the
goal of increasing accountability
between the ASSI and students.
W'ais then asked each platform
how they would address issues of
undergraduate housing on cam
pus.
"Students don't have enough
voice," Newton said. "You hear.

' I his and that sorority got Whit
man,' but you wonder, 'Where was
ni) voice?' Villegas said she hopes
to "make the ASSI be a voice" for
these issues and "create a new tra
dition of the ASSI on campus."
Hildas responded by saying that
"we need to have more students
than administrators on the Greek
Housing Committee." I.iu added
that "student voices are not heard,
and we want to work on Housing
and Dining Services next year."
On graduate student issues, Liu
said his goals are to "try to tie issues
together that affect all students."

Hildas added lliat, if elected, they
will work on getting health care for
graduate students, possibly subsi
dized In the University.
Newton said that he has alread)
begun working on graduate stu
dent issues by attending a few
(Jraduate Student Council meet
ings. I fe said he hopes to "make a
commitment to jthe graduate stu
dent | voice."
Both slates also talked about
their commitment beyond the
University, focusing on the issue
of whether or not tlu* ASM should
< irate partnerships with organiza
tions outside the University.
" I he.YSSI is about represent
ing the student voice in Ironl of
I lie community and the real
world," said Newton. Villegas
added that "we have to improve
the fundamental role of the
ASM to make each and every
one of your voices heard."
Dudas argued that "we have
major problems at Stanford, and
we need to deal with those before
we go outside Stanford." I.in
added that the ASM "works best
as .1 resource for student groups
who advocate these issues.'
The debate then turned to a
role-playing scenario where each

slate was asked how they would
ust' money given to them by a
alumna.
I.iu and Dudas said they
would use the money as seed
money to build a new student
union and to build a new student
resource center with meeting
rooms for student groups.
But Newton said, "we can ex
pect to have a union from the Uni
versity," and said that he and Vil
legas would use the money to in
crease graduate student stipends
and housing and give more money
to existing community centers.
I lie slates also responded to a
question about what they would
say in a hypothetical meeting
with I'resident-elecl |ohn Hen
nessy.
"We would challenge him to
make this a mote democratic
place and go beyond what Presi
dent Casper has done," Villegas

said. "We would also start laying
the groundwork for getting an
undergraduate and graduate stu
dent oil the Hoard of Trustees."
Liu responded by saying, "We
have a new provost, and we real
ly have a vision to put the student
voice first." Dudas said they hope
to increase student representa
tion on the ASSU Nominations
(Commission.
Finally, each platform talked
about their key differences.
" I he beginning of the plat
form was the collective building
of this process," Newton said.
"We have bold goals and a strong
positive voice."
Liu responded by saying "We
have a concrete plan, and we
don't believe in a fragmented
community."
Both slates expressed interest
in bettering the University's com
mitment to the arts and respond-

Ed to questions about rac ism on
campus.
"Racism is more widespread,"
Newton said. "We will take tangi
ble steps to open pathways to
University decisions."
Liu said "the ASSU will contin
ue to be an enabler on campus,"
and they hope to have more stu
dent voice forums next year.
After the debate, Senator
Nikki Love, a junior, said, "li was
fun; I helped write some of the
questions."
Both slates seemed pleased
with the event.
"I'm really happy; the elec
tions commission did a great
job," Dudas said.
"It was interesting to hear our
opponents verbalize some of
their positions," Villegas said.
"We liked the questions from the
audience; I just hope people get
out and vote."
