# Prof. values Congressional seats through political funding

### SCOTT DORFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Interest groups spend millions
of dollars each year hoping to un
seat members of Congress who
hold viewpoints that oppose their
own. The groups do so by funding
challengers - challengers who are
often defeated.
Timothy Groseclose, assistant
professor at the Graduate School
of Business, looked at this phe
nomenon and wondered if simply
buying out the unruly members
would be a more effective strategy
for interest groups.
Groseclose, whose primary re
search interest is the intersection of
political science and economics in
Congress, stumbled upon what he
described as "incredible opportu
nity for data" regarding the 1992
(Congressional elections.
"In 1992, my colleague, [Grad
uate School of Business Prof.]
Keith Krehbiel, recognized the sig
nificance of the data of the 1992
elections," said Groseclose, who
completed 11is research last week.
"That was the last year that House
members were able to keep their
campaign war c hests for personal
use, which was an inducement for

incumbents to retire. We wrote a
paper testing whether or not this
money had an eflect on retire
ment, and found out that ii did,"
lie said.
Working from the hypothesis
that money would be an induce
ment for members to retire, Grose
close and I lifts University Eco
nomics Prof. Jeff Milyo set out to
find exactly how much money it
would take to provide an incentive
for a member to give up a seat.
"We used some pretty complex
statistical techniques," Groseclose
said. "The basic idea was that we
looked at retirement rates and a
number of variables, and ultimate
ly we found that we could use the
data to estimate the value of a seat
in Congress."
Looking at the data available for
159 members of Congress eligible
to keep their war chests, Grose
close and Milyo calculated it would
take around $3 million to induce
the average member of Congress
to leave. However, amounts var
ied, because members of Congress
differed widely in age and wealth.
"We found that it didn't take
much money to induce poor and
old members to retire," ('.roseclose
said. "Younger members and rich

er members were not nearly as
likely to retire."
Although Groseclose's findings
have yet to published, he has spo
ken to a few of the people who
were the subjects of his research.
"1 talked to a former member of
Congress who retired in 1992, and
he did admit to me that the money
was a significant factor influencing
his decision to give up his seat, as
well as for many other members."
Interest groups are prevented
from pursuing a strategy of simply
buying out members because the
amount money necessary to do so
is far higher than that interest
groups would usually spend on a
given campaign. Also, no guaran
tee exists that an incumbent's re
placement would not take the
same positions as his or bet pre
deccesor, according to Groseclose
and Milyo.
I lie tv\o researchers concluded
that the strategy of funding chal
lengers is the best one available for
interest groups.
Groseclose said the findings
have stimulated his interest in re
searching campaign finance issues.
"I would like to find out [in fu
ture research | what exactly is the
eflect of money on campaigns."
