ington on Friday.
"Any time* you can sweep a se
ries in conference, il's huge," Mar
quess said alter yesterday's 9-4
Stanford win in the series finale.
"We're going to enjoy this heeau.se
they were just huge wins for us."
Behind a solid outing from
freshman I im Cunningham and
another impressive offensive out
put, Stanford took yesterday's
routes! amidst dreary skies and a
consistent dri/./.le,
Washington (14-20, .'<-9) could
not maintain a consistent rally
while the Cardinal exploded in
the fifth. Stanford hatted around
to push six across in the inning
and firmly grasp control of the
game for good.
Friday night's game saw junior
|ustiu Wayne improve l to ( .l-1 this
season despite struggling
through a less-than-stellai perfor
mance on the hill. Wayne allowed
the I luskies to tally II hits and
scattered five runs ovei eight in
nings, hut .i late rally from his of
fense made him the pitcher of
record in the (>-"> win.

Altei Wayne walked off the
mound trailing 5-4 after the top
of the eighth, the Cardinal
charged hack with RBIs from se
nior Kdmund Muth and Call to
take the lead in the bottom half.
Sophomore Jeff Bruksch came
in to record his seventh save of the
season by pitching a scoreless
ninth.
Junior Jason Young tossed a
complete-game six-hitter for Sat -
urday's 7-2 victory in 11is second
complete game of the season.
Young's last I I decisions have
gone in his favor, dating back to
the last six of his 1999 campaign.
"Jason was in command the
entire game," Marquess said. " I It*
pitched a great game today."
Young was the beneficiary of
Call's incessant assault on the
Stanford records, as the senior
finished M-for-4 with a double
and an RBI. Saturday's display
lelt Call within reach of both
marks that he eclipsed the foil
win g day.
I he bulk ol the (iarclinal scor
ing came in the live-run third in
ning after Huskies' junior Matt
Massingale sent clown the first
two batters. |unioi |oe Bore hard
began the barrage with a two-RBI

single to give Stanford the early 2-
0 lead.
Gall and sophomore Chris
O'Riordan followed with an RBI
single and a two-RBI double to
close out the big Stanford in
ning.
"It's unusual to score five runs
in an inning after the first two hit
ters are retired," Marquess said.
"I can't remember the last time
we have done that. We had some
clutch hitting from a couple dif
ferent guys today."
