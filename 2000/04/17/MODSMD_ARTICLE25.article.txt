### MAUREEN MULLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I lit- No. 9 Stanford Softball team (34-
11, 3-8 Pacific 10 Conference) experi
enced <i disappointing weekend of Con
ference play. Alter overpowering No. 14
()regon State (27-115-1, 1-7) in the seventh
inning to win 3-2 on Friday, the Cardinal
posted two frustrating losses to No. 24
Oregon (29-17, 4-0) Saturday and Sun
day.
"We were just pushing to hard," said
head coach |ohn Kidman. "To he com
petitive iu this conference you've got to hit
the hall well, and you < an't make defensive
frrors."
Friday's game was (learly the highpoint
ol the season as Stanford rallied around
ilie defensive pla\ of sophomore shortstop
Kohin Walker. Walker recorded a diving
save in the fifth inning giving Oregon
State three outs. She then led-ofl, gelling
on first base lor the ('.ardinal.
Sophomore Jessica Mendo/.a then hit a
driving bullet grabbing her seventh home
t un on the season, and two runs for the

Cardinal, putting them ahead 2-1.
Freshman pitcher Dana Sorenson was
only one pitch away from winning when
the Beavers responded with a home run of
their own, when Shelly Prochaska tied the
score at two in the top of the seventh in
ning.
However, Stanford responded quickly.
Winginton led-off the inning with a hit to
right-center field. She was able to advance
to second alter Oregon State's Brooke
Kutdisman mishandled the ball. In the
bottom of the seventh inning, freshman
(lassi Brangham hit a single to drive in se
nior kellie Winginton. An out by Walker
pushed Winginton to third before the
freshman batted her in for the win.
At this point, the (Cardinal looked to be
iu good shape. (doming off two conference
wins, the next two home games against
Oregon, arguably the worst team in the
Pac-10, looked to be an ideal opportunity
to establish Stanford in the conference
standings. I nlortunately for the Cardi
nal, I lie 1 )ii( ks proved to he much tougher
than it originally appeared.
In Saturday's game Stanford stranded
14 runners en route to losing 3-1.
"It's not that we can't hit the ball,"
Kilt man said. "It is just that we're unable to
rally successfully. You are going to win
very few games when you leave 1 4 runners
stranded on base."
()regon jumped out quickly with three

runs in the second inning. Freshman Tori
Nyberg opened the inning by walking Tri
awn Cluster. Oregon's Lindsey Welch
reached base on a Cardinal error. Jill
Robinson doubled for the Ducks bringing
in Custer.
With no outs, freshman Maureen
LeCocq came up to the mound to relieve
Nyberg. A single by Oregon's Andrea Vid
lund and another Stanford error left the
Cardinal down by three.
The only Stanford run came in on a
bases loaded walk by LeCocq that brought
in Mendo/.a. While the Cardinal were able
to load the bases several times throughout
the game, they were never able to muster
up tlie critical hit to drive the runners in.
lu Sunday's game the (Cardinal contin
ued to be plagued by defensive errors as
the Ducks overtook Stanford in the sev
enth inning to win the game 3-2.
Freshman Sorenson tied her season
strike-out record with seven in the Stan
ford loss. She only gave up seven hits and
two earned room in the contest.
The Stanford women jumped out to a
two run lead alter rallying in the bottom of
the third. Walker hit a single, then ad
vanced to second 011 a hit by Mendo/.a.
Sophomore Sara Beeson's single brought
in Walker. Beeson and Mendo/.a ad
vanced to second and third ;is Oregon at
tempted to throw out Walker. A sacrifice
fly by Wiginton brought in Mendo/.a for

the second Stanford score.
But the Ducks came back in the- fifth to
score two runs of theirown. ()regon's Vid
lund hit a single to lead-oil the inning. A
Stanford error advanced Vidlund t<> third
011 a bunt by Holly Ray. Oregon's Andrea
(iiistafson singled to bring in Vidlund and
move Ray to third. Ray scored when
(iiistafson tried to steal to second and
Stanford's Wiginton threw the ball to (en
ter field.
()regon scored again in the seventh in

ning to put them up by one.
Stanford attempted to rally in the sev
enth and got two runners on base, before
ending the inning on a controversial Nleii
doza out.
"We have a young team," Rittinan said.
"It's not that they don't know what to do,
we just have problems with execution
sometimes."
Stanford returns to the diamond 011
Wednesday when they travel to Fresno
State.
