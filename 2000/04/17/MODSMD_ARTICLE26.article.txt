### KATIE FITZPATRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
1 Ik* lone Stanford participants in the N( A A (iym
nastics Championships in Boise, Idaho, sophomore
Katy I ierl)ert and junior Jennifer Kxaltacion, rose to the
occasion to turn in some of their most impressive per
formances to date. Herbert hit two near perfect sets to
finish third in the nation on beam and Ik* named first
team All-American on the event. Kxaltacion was named
second team All-American in the all-around and on
!>eatn.
"Katy and Jen did such an excellent job. To go in as
individuals without the entire team and compete so well
shows how prepared and mentally strong they arc. said
senior co-captain Uirissa l-bntaine.
On Thursday, Herbert finished third in the second
session of the two session competition. I ler 9.N75 per
formance qualified her for individual event finals on Sat
urday.
Kxaltacion's performance, also in the second-session
of the competition, featured steady routines on every
event by the internationally experienced competitor.
The 19% Canadian Olympian finished eighth in her
session with a 59.225 all-around store, good enough for
All-American honors.
"Jen has competed so well all year, coining together
in clutch moments as she has done for the past three
years. She deserves to Ik- an All-American," Fontaine
said.
Kxaltacion also gai ned All-American honors by her
seventh place performance in her session on beam with
a 9.85. She is currently the school-record holder on the

event.
I he junior also did well on other events: scoring a 9.8
on vault lor 1 ~>ili place, scoring a 9.75 on bars lor ITili
place, and scoring a 9.825 on floor lor 22nd place.
Exaltation was benefited by competing in a rotation
with UCLA who won the team competition on Thurs
clavancl went on to claim the NCAA team title on Friday.
The Pacific 10 Conference rivals were a familiar group
and the I CLA contingent generated much energy and
excitement.
In beam finals on Saturday, Herbert competed
among a cliflic lilt lield of competitors and held her own.
I ferbcrt's 9.B(>.'i set was c lose behind two strong L (T\
performances: a 9.913 routine by Lena Degteva and a
9.90 set by Mohini Bhardwaj.
Kvent finals are especially nerve lacking because the*
gymnasts compete on one event at time. Thus, in beam
finals, all 10.000 pairs of eyes in the arena are focused on
the one competitor on beam.
" K;it \ is ama/ing - she is so cool under pressure," said
rex >m mate and former teammate Kristen Deri .
Teammates agreed.
"kaly is one of the best beam workers in the eountn
and she proved ii to everyone last weekend. Beam is the
most intense event to compete, especial!) during event
finals of the NCAA Championships. She is a true com
petitor," Fontaine said.
Both gymnasts qualified to the meet based on their in
dividual performances at NCAA Regionals: Herbert
won the- Regional beam title while Exaltation was one of
the highest all-around scores in the nation. This is the
first lime either gymnast had received Ail-American
honors.
