1 he No. 1 Stanford women's
water polo stomped No. 1 1 LC-
Davis Friday (>-3. This marked the
Cardinal's last dual match of the
year as it heads into its post-season
play. Stanford is now 22-4 overall.
Against Davis, Stanford started
out strong and led 3-0 at the end of
the first quarter.
Despite the lead, Davis refused
to give in and rallied to score three
goals against the Cardinal in three
minutes, narrowing the Stanford
lead to 4-3 by the beginning of the
third quarter. Davis' three point
surge proved to be insufficient
however, as Stanford prevented
any further scoring and walked
away with the victory.
Juniors Anne-Marie Keenan
and Kelly Shouev lead the Cardinal
scoring with two goals a piece.
Freshmen Nicole llus/c/ancl Julie
Gardner each put one away.
"We came out strong against
Davis," said junior goalie Alii
Henry. "But we let our guards
down during the second quarter
and allowed them to make a come
back. I his is something we cannot
allow neither at next weekend's na
tional qualifying tournament nor
during national championships."
While the game against Davis
had no official bearing on the ( ar
clinal's record or ranking, the play
ers and coaches still viewed it as an
important step for growth and
practice.
"Fvery game provides an op
portunity to learn and grow as
players," said redshirt freshman
Jackie Frank. "In order to fully gain
from the experience you have to
treat each game as having impor
tance. I hat is our attitude towards
even game, including this one."
Stanford is expected to play
Dav is again this weekend during its
second game .it the national quali
fying tournament. Friday's game
was the first time Stanford played
Davis this season and gave the (lar
dinal a chance to si/.e up the Davis

team before the tournament.
1 his week Stanford will he fo
cusing all of its attention on the
qualifying tournament. I fie qualif
ing tournament decides which
teams will partcipate in this year's
nationals championships in Indi
ana, and how the teams in the tour
nament will he seeded. Stanford's
main goal for the tournament is to
hold on to its No. I ranking by fin
ishing first in order to get the opti
mal seeding spot at nationals.
1 his week the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation announced its
all- conference first and second
teams. Four Stanford players
made the roster. Sophomore
Margie Dingeldein was named to
the all-conference first team, and
junior Kris Koblik, Gardner and
Frank were named to the second
team.
Dingeldein is currently the
team's leading scorer with 48 goals.
1 Ict greatest weapon is her speed,
which she capitalizes on in order to
score from last breaks during coun
terattacks and from front curt dri
ving.
Koblik is one of the team's most
versitile players. Being a left-hand
ed player, Koblik poses a scoring
threat for Stanford from every
angle on the front court. In addi
tion to her offensive skills, Koblik is
one of the teams leading defensive
players due to her tenacity and
awareness.
Second on the team in scoring
with 45 goals, Gardner is an offen
sive threat from both the outside
perimeter and the 2-meter posi
tion. She is also one of Stanford's
top weapons during O-on-5 situa
tions.
Frank took time off from school
last year in order to participate in
the ()lympic Trials for the national
water polo team. Frank shows in
credible talent in blocking shots in
the goal and serving as the base for
the (Cardinal defense.
I lie national qualifying tourna
ment, hosted by C '.alifornia, is a two
day tournament, with Stanford's
first game Friday afternoon.
