"|( '.li risi ina] and Rachel have been a rock in the strut

"I he lacrosse program is in its sixth year of'development
and [they] have been therethrough the good times and

up. It was the sport that everyone wanted to play."
I'x >t 11 plavcrs participated in lac rosse on a competitive
lex el throughout high school, playing in leagues year
round. When ii came time to decide on college, howev
er, lac rosse was not a huge part of either player's dec i
sion.
" I made mv decision to attend Stanford independent
of lacrosse. 1 knew tli.it I wanted to go to here, and the
possibility of playing lacrosse was just a bonus," (ial
lagher said.
Now , instead of just hoping to participate, the lead

tial part of the team dynamic. They were elec ted c ap

tains for the unique qualities ihey have to offer and the
guidance they provide, on and oil the field.
"The team c hose Gily as captain lor a few reasons, the
most significant being her ability to motivate this team.
She is a great leader both in her words and actions.
"Rachel is the voice of reason out there. She is in
tuitive, constructive, in her criticisms and sugges
tions. Rachel understands the game on a level
greater than most people ever will. The younger
team members look to her guidance on a daily basis,"

As c aptains, they have tried to provide leadership and
experience to this young team. With three years of col
legiate lacrosse under their belt, the insight and motiva
tion the duo provides is an important element in the
team's succ ess.
"1 rely so heavily upon these two individuals to keep
the morale of the team up, to solve the minor problems
and to be my line of communication. Without strong
captains, a team would liill apart," (Connor said.
When Gallagher and Gilyutin graduate this year,
they will leave a program in much I letter shape than they
found it four years ago. They leave behind them a
promising future for Stanford lac rosse.
"With their graduation looming in the distance, 1
know that they will be sorely missed both by myself and
this team. I will miss the people who got this team to
where we are today, who know the history and appreci
ate the struggle."
