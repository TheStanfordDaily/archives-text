# Accomplishments of ASSU slate under fire
## 
### MEGAN KNIZE STAFF WRITER 
1 "lie claims of ASS I presiden
tial hopefuls lien Liu and Mike
Oudas have recently come under
scrutiny, with some senators ac
cusing the pair of overstating
their involvement in several key
senate initiatives.
ASSU webmaster Patrick
Coffman wrote a letter to the ed
itor appearing in today's Daily
outlining his complaints against
the slate.
"The items that Liu and
Hildas are claiming to have ac
complished in many cases had
nothing to do with either of
them," Coffman wrote in the let
ter. Coffman said that he is cur
rently volunteering to help with
Newton and Villegas' campaign.
Coffman said the slate is try
ing to take too much credit for
post office reform, the Roble
Theater proposal, improve
ments to I residder Union and
work on graduate student issues.
But Liu defends what he and
Hildas wrote in the elections
handbook.
"I think the ASSU has had a
really productive year and we've
had an active role in most, if not
all of the accomplishments," Liu
said, adding that he "stands by
what we put on our Web site, and
I ( an go through in detail our ac -
complishments."
Open to interpretation
Liu and Hildas say they
played a large role in the ASSU's
efforts this year.
"We have a lot of ideas which
we helped develop," Liu said.
"Mike and I wrote a survey to see
what students wanted," refer
ring to their work on improving
Tresidder.
ASSU Vice President John
Mills said the pair were involved
in the projects they claimed to be
involved in, but that he ques
tioned the extent to which they
were involved in certain projects.

ASSU Appropriations Chair
Kl ist\ Wilson said that when she
read the elections handbook, she
had a different interpretation
from Cofftnan.
"As a reader, this is the stuff
the Senate has done," Wilson
said. "At limes they lead, at times
they support; there's lots of
teamwork in the ASSU."
But Coffman said he still
doesn't buy it.
He said Liu and Dudas "have
played almost no part" because
former ASSL President Maren
Norton and current ASSL Presi
dent Mike Levin "have been
lighting to improve I residder
for two years."
"With the post office, they
show up at a meeting, hear a few
ideas and all of a sudden it's like.
'We contributed sign if ic an 11 \',"
Coffman said. " They've been in
volved. but very minimally."
Wilson, however, said that, if
anything, they've done more
than they included in their elec
tions profile, such as working on
alternatives to the freshman
transportation policy.
"They've done more than
they've said," Wilson said.
"That's not even in the hand
book."
Senate chair and others speak
Lndergraduate Senate Chair
Steven Aronowitz - who is work
ing on Newton and Villegas'
campaign - doesn't agree with
the way Liu and Dudas have rep
resented their accomplishments.
"I think politics is about trying
to make yourself look good;
you're trying to spin every
thing," said Aronowitz, a senior.
"They spun their accomplish
ments and gave i hemselves fancy
titles."
However, Senator Aimer
Khan said that in "90 to 95 per
cent of the things they list, they
either directly or indirectly had a
role."
Khan said Dudas was one ol
the "main proponents" ol the
1 residder concert series and
that he came tip with the idea,
brought student groups to
meetings, and worked with
Levin.
Lill said Dudas "single-hand
edly pushed the I residder con
cert series." I lie concert series
took plate while the (lollee
Mouse was being remodeled.
Dudas added th.it he cai i ied out

iln* (lollee 1 1<>ust' launch party
when Levin needed some extra
help.
('-oilman's letter also states
111 at Liu and Dudas can't claim
to have "held the lust-ever Stu
dent Void' Forum, which led to
the Kohle I heater proposal," as
they do in their elections guide,
because "the Roble I heater
proposal has been driven l>\
Steven Aronovvil/ from the be
ginning."
Aronowit/ added, "1 think
Ben will admit that this is my
project, I pushed this; he was ex
cited but it wasn't his thing."
He also added, "Mike hadn't

done that much, hut Ken is ail
RAin Ruble; what lie was able to
do was he a good communica
tions link for us."
Liu responded by saying "I
did a lot of coordination and re
served room space. I would say
that its equal, but iu terms of'car
rying it through, I had a strong
role."
Credit for group efforts
"People feel that things would
have happened without them,"
Aronowit/. said.
Aronowitz said that lie's heard
concerns from members of the

ASSU that the Liu-Dudas slate
was overstating its own impor
tance, but he admits that "it's
hard to give individual credit be
cause everything we do is a
group effort."
But Kxecutive Aide Michael
Osofsky says that, at least in
terms of the ASSU's work on
the post office, the slate's in
volvement wasn't misrepre
sented.
"Hen's role was as big as any
one else's," Osofsky said. "He
helped create the post office
task force; he was definitely
there from the get go." Khan
agrees.

"Steven and Ben were defi
nitely the leaders of that group
and they worked with [law stu
dent] I'y Clevenger," Khan
said.
Osofsky, who is running for
ASSU Senate, said ih.it il past
performance is any indication,
"they'll keep their promises."
The slate also claims to have
served students this year by
"meeting 100 percent of student
112 unding requests and shortening
turn-around time."
Weiss, a senior, said usually a
registered student group goes to
the ASSU to fill out forms and
then makes an appointment to

meet with the Senate Appropria
tions (Committee.
He said faster turn-around
lime was due largely to his work
with Levin last spring, and noted
that while Liu sat on the appro
priations committee, Dudas did
not.
Kven with these allegations,
Liu and Hildas say they are still
"gratified to see how many of
the senators have supported
IIS."
To find out more about both
slates, the candidates are meet
ing with students Tuesday
evening at a party at Roble from
7 to 9 p.m.
