# Accomplishments of ASSU slate under fire
## 
### MEGAN KNIZE STAFF WRITER 
1 "lie claims of ASS I presiden
tial hopefuls lien Liu and Mike
Oudas have recently come under
scrutiny, with some senators ac
cusing the pair of overstating
their involvement in several key
senate initiatives.
ASSU webmaster Patrick
Coffman wrote a letter to the ed
itor appearing in today's Daily
outlining his complaints against
the slate.
"The items that Liu and
Hildas are claiming to have ac
complished in many cases had
nothing to do with either of
them," Coffman wrote in the let
ter. Coffman said that he is cur
rently volunteering to help with
Newton and Villegas' campaign.
Coffman said the slate is try
ing to take too much credit for
post office reform, the Roble
Theater proposal, improve
ments to I residder Union and
work on graduate student issues.
But Liu defends what he and
Hildas wrote in the elections
handbook.
"I think the ASSU has had a
really productive year and we've
had an active role in most, if not
all of the accomplishments," Liu
said, adding that he "stands by
what we put on our Web site, and
I ( an go through in detail our ac -
complishments."
Open to interpretation
Liu and Hildas say they
played a large role in the ASSU's
efforts this year.
"We have a lot of ideas which
we helped develop," Liu said.
"Mike and I wrote a survey to see
what students wanted," refer
ring to their work on improving
Tresidder.
ASSU Vice President John
Mills said the pair were involved
in the projects they claimed to be
involved in, but that he ques
tioned the extent to which they
were involved in certain projects.

ASSU Appropriations Chair
Kl ist\ Wilson said that when she
read the elections handbook, she
had a different interpretation
from Cofftnan.
"As a reader, this is the stuff
the Senate has done," Wilson
said. "At limes they lead, at times
they support; there's lots of
teamwork in the ASSU."
But Coffman said he still
doesn't buy it.
He said Liu and Dudas "have
played almost no part" because
former ASSL President Maren
Norton and current ASSL Presi
dent Mike Levin "have been
lighting to improve I residder
for two years."
"With the post office, they
show up at a meeting, hear a few
ideas and all of a sudden it's like.
'We contributed sign if ic an 11 \',"
Coffman said. " They've been in
volved. but very minimally."
Wilson, however, said that, if
anything, they've done more
than they included in their elec
tions profile, such as working on
alternatives to the freshman
transportation policy.
"They've done more than
they've said," Wilson said.
"That's not even in the hand
book."
Senate chair and others speak
Lndergraduate Senate Chair
Steven Aronowitz - who is work
ing on Newton and Villegas'
campaign - doesn't agree with
the way Liu and Dudas have rep
resented their accomplishments.
"I think politics is about trying
to make yourself look good;
you're trying to spin every
thing," said Aronowitz, a senior.
"They spun their accomplish
ments and gave i hemselves fancy
titles."
However, Senator Aimer
Khan said that in "90 to 95 per
cent of the things they list, they
either directly or indirectly had a
role."
