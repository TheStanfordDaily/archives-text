Dean of Students Marc Wais
said he was satisfied wit 11 the week
end's events. "I think this Admit
Weekend was ver\ successful in
that it provided a safe environ
ment for students to explore the
academic, residential and soei.il

;is| )c*< I s ol Stanford and to deride
it Stanford is tlit* rij»lit lit." YV'ais
said.
Prospective freshman Mitni

experience. "Admit Weekend is

and Roble Head llonse I lost,
said. "I think threatening to re

excessive, but other than that ii

I he pro I ros are our guests and ii
reflects badl\ on the administra
tion if something happens like ii

did last year."
Manx students and prospective
freshmen said they thought that
the polirv was appropriate foi
Admit Weekend, although some
disagreed.
|av Iyengar, a prospective
freshman, disapproved of the pol
icy. "1 thought that the goal of
Admit Weekend was to give
prospective freshmen an ade
quate impression of what student
life is like at Stanford, and to
change that for one weekend
seems rather counterproductive."
freshman Vince I'liain said the
policy gives prospective freshmen
"an unrealistic impression of Stan
ford."
Resident assistant Chris
Thompson, a junior, explained
the goal of the policy.
"These measures are in place in
order to be proactive and preven
tative rather than reactive and
punitive, and that should be

stressed," Thompson said.
Dobraca said the House Hosts
encouraged tlie* prospective fresh
men not to drink and reminded
them that the University regarded
them as guests.
" I he pro fros then asked l
about Stanford's alcohol policy!
for students and it seemed they!
decided one weekend of drink
ing wasn't worth risking their ad
mission."
