, The Writing and Critical
Thinking Program (WCT) has ex
perienced enrollment problems
stemming from the enrollment of
approximately 1,750 students in
this year's freshman class. A high
yield rate resulted in the class ex
ceeding its anticipated size of
1,600 students.
"These problems arose primar
ily during winter quarter 1999-
2000, but much of them were
solved in time for spring 2000,"
said Lynne Yieth, a lecturer in the
WCT program.
According to Vieth, program
statistics showed that the enroll
ment problems were largely
caused In a chain reaction of three
main factors.
The first was a trend of late re
porting of incoming students' ad
vanced placement scores in fall
1999.
The second was a resulting
shortage of Writing 3s classes (a
one-quarter, four-unit class for
those with AP credit) budgeted for
winter quarter, making it difficult
to accommodate the freshmen
moving in from Writing Is and 2s
(a two quarter, three-unit class for
those without AP credit).
l he third was the University's
Y2K mandate stating that stu
dents who did not show up during
the first week of classes in winter
quarter could not be dropped
from class lists. This extended
WCT's no-show policy to two
weeks, making it difficult for the
department to place upperclass
men on waiting lists before the
third week of classes.
WCT is a mandatory Universi
ty requirement which most stu
dents fulfill during their fresh
man year.
Many freshmen experienced
no significant overcrowding or
scheduling conflicts resulting
from this chain reaction of events.
"With around twelve people,
m\ writing < lass last quarter wasn't
too large," said freshman Kric Lai.
" I Ik- regular limit pet \V( \ ( lass

"My ( lass was perfect in si/e too,

"I petitioned lora< hange in m\
WC. l section winter (|iiarter, and I
had no trouble in getting into an
other time slot th.it lit into mv
schedule. In fact, some people

even came into the class during the

freshman Mark Biaglan.

"(lonsequentlv, we are pleased

applicant, have been appropi iate

said.
However, one freshman re

marked on a severe case of polio
enforcement for late-comers.
"I know a girl who was kicked
out of her WCT assignment w hen
she missed the first class, fheonly
one she could get into then was
one that started at 8:3() a.m.," said
freshman lan Beimel.
Whether this was due to the ap
parent overcrowding of students
signed up for W(IT this vear is un
clear.
However, Yietli emphasized
the W(. I office and staffs utmost
efforts were put in to remedy the
potential overcrow cling and con
flic is dial students may have expe
rienced.
