Monday, April 24 • 7:30 PM
■ Dr. Curtis R. Carlson
President and CEO of SRI International, Dr. Carlson was a
member of the team that won an Emmy for outstanding
technical achievement for his development of digital high
definition television (HDTV) which became the U.S.
Business strategist, futurist, and author
of The Art of the Long View and, most recently, co-author of
The Lonq Boom, Mr. Schwartz is co-founder and chairman
of the Global Business network.
In an informal setting, the two speakers will outline their
rationale for why they believe we are at the beginning of a "long
boom." They are MOT primarily speaking of an economic boom,
but rather a continuing deep transformation in all aspects of life and culture. Mr.
Schwartz will offer his understanding of the forces that will continue to drive a boom
he thinks has just begun and suggest a set of principles that he believes are fundamen
tal to promoting positive rather than destructive manifestations of the boom. Dr. Carlson
will talk about his experiences in creating an enterprise that is responsive to the oppor
tunities of this time and speak about the changes he is actively implementing at SRI to
enable it to become an incubator for innovative and world-changing technologies.
