Lorna Dee Cervantes has been recognized as one of the most talented voices in Chicana/o literature. She was born
in San Francisco's Mission district and grew up in East San Jos6. Cervantes is both Native American and Chicana.
She traces her roots back to the Chumash nation, a group that called the hills and coast of Santa Barbara their home.
In Cervantes, readers can find a perfect marriage between politics and aesthetics; since her first collection, Cervantes
has been critically acclaimed for her mastery of language, but also for her politically engaged poems. In her poetry,
she denounces racism, sexism, discrimination, human rights violations committed unto women, ethnic minorities
here and abroad. She has also been the recipient of numerous awards including: The Lila Wallace Prize;
The National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship Grant for poetry, 1993 and 1978; The Latino Literature Prize
for From the Cables of Genocide; The Paterson Poetry Prize for "best book of poetry published in 1991," for
From the Cables of Genocide; and The American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation for
Emplumada. She is currently professor of creative writing at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
