# Stanford's endowment fares well despite market woes
## Diversified portfolio helps ensure against market fluctuations 
### SCOTT DORFMAN STAFF WRITER 
With the drastic plunge in the
Dow Jones and NASDAQ indexes
last week, many people may won
der whether Stanford's $6.2 bil
lion-endowment is as susceptible
to the rumblings of the market as
Stanford's land is to the rumblings
of the San Andreas Fault.
Last Friday, both the Dow Jones
industrial average and the NAS
DAQ composite index exhibited
their largest one-day losses in his
tory. The technology-heavy NAS
DAQ lost more than 25 percent of
its value during the week.
Not to worry, asserted Lau
rence Hoagland, chief executive
officer of the Stanford Manage
ment Company, the group
charged with allocating assets for
the endowment.
While the recent market losses
may have an effect on the Univer
sity's financial standing, Stanford's

portfolio is diversified to a point
where the University will witness
little overall effect from the market
slide, Hoagland stressed.
"The asset allocation that we
have is much more diversified
than the typical model for the
very reason of dampening the
impact of fluctuations, such as the
one that occurred last week," said
Hoagland. "Around 25 percent
of our assets are allocated to
wards investments in the U.S.
market, while the typical institu
tion will allocate close to f)0 per
cent of its assets towards the U.S.
market."
The Stanford Management
Company, established in 1991,
contributes 5.25 percent of the
value of the endowment in inter
est each year to the University
budget, leaving the rest of the
funds to grow the endowment.
The company is also charged with
hiring the money managers that
oversee the market portion of the
endowment.
While many of the high-tech
nology companies held in the en
dowment fund were founded by
Stanford alumni or faculty, the
fund is not over-heavy in local
stocks. Hoagland said that poten

tial conflicts of interest were re
solved by the use of outside money
managers with little to no connec
tion to the University.
Hoagland stressed that the
company looks for managers who
have long-term, five- to 10-year
outlooks for investments.
" The money managers that we
hire have full discretion over
which stocks they buy and sell,"
said Hoagland. "We deliberately
select outside money managers
who are likely not to invest as heav
ily in Silicon Valley stocks, so as to
achieve a balance in terms of the
assets we hold."
While Stanford's domestic mar
ket investments are generally con
servative and geared toward the
long term, 18 percent of the en
dowment is tied in to alternative
investments, usually partnerships
with venture capital firms.
"We do have significant invest
ments in venture capitalist firms,"
said Hoagland. " These have been
extremely rewarding in recent
years, and we have witnessed sub
stantial gains from them. Howev
er, they are very volatile."
For fiscal year 1998-99, the ven
ture capital partnerships had a re
turn 0f'232 percent.
