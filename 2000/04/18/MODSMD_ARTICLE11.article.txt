Sullivan said, "Weenlisted students in a
broad clis< ussion." I he dialogues that
have ensued, inosth b\ e-mail, have
been, in Sullivan's words, "really excel
lent."
While the\ have participated in the
conversation, students wondei what
the intended end might be. Amber
(>ai /a. Co-president of the 1 .aw Associa
tion, the Law School's lorm ol student
govei nincnt.said that, "we've?been told
that there is a review going oil, but we

don't really know the purpose."
An issue that has received scrutiny in
these conversations is the school's
mandatory average grade for each
dass. So that students do not choose
classes simply because they know they
will receive a higher grade, and so that
students taking the same course from
different professors will receive similar
grades, the Law School currently re
quires a mandatory ( lass average of a
B+,ora 3.2.
I here is no rule, however, defining
the range of student grades, said Sulli
van.
It is possible that every student in
one class receives a 3.2, a B + , or it is
possible that a few students receive the
top grade, 4.3. and a few students fail.
Such a situation provides an incen
tive lot top students to take classes with
professors known as "spreaders," who
will give top grades, and for struggling
students to take classes with
"dumpers," knowing that they will
probably receive at least a B.
Law student Shana Scarlett said in
an e-mail, "Somehow a disproportion
ate amount of women are ending up in
most of the classes where the [clump
ing] penalty is the strongest."
Since students currently depend on
reputation and rumor for differentiat
ing professors, some are requesting
knowledge of which professors are
"spreaders" and "dumpers." Others,
and some professors, would prefer that

the standard be "spreading" the grades
over a normal distribution.
Requiring professors spread out
grades would address some distor
tions, but, Sullivan asked, "what if you
have a class where everyone is at the
high end of the GPA?" Students whose
work is normally at the top of the class
would receive merely an average
grade, leaving their achievements un
rewarded.
"The majority of students are con
cerned about the impact a change
would have upon Stanford's culture, "
said John Malik, the Law Association's
other co-president.
The freedom of tfie current
pass / fail system makes Stanford "a
friendlier, more hospitable place to
pursue a legal education," he said. His
concern is particularly strong because
"student access to internal decision
procedures is very limited."
At next week's meeting of the Stu
dent Cabinet, comprised of representa
tives from the Law Association and
other student organizations, Sullivan
plans to share information from the
faculty's discussion of grading issues.
After further dialogue among stu
dents and faculty, the final recommen
dation of the committee for a change
would not occur until, at earliest, the
beginning of this summer, said Sulli
van.
Right now, she emphasized, "every
thing is on the table."

While the\ have participated in the
conversation, students wondei what
the intended end might be. Amber
(>ai /a. Co-president of the 1 .aw Associa
tion, the Law School's lorm ol student
govei nincnt.said that, "we've?been told
that there is a review going oil, but we

don't really know the purpose."
An issue that has received scrutiny in
these conversations is the school's
mandatory average grade for each
dass. So that students do not choose
classes simply because they know they
will receive a higher grade, and so that
students taking the same course from
different professors will receive similar
grades, the Law School currently re
quires a mandatory ( lass average of a
B+,ora 3.2.
I here is no rule, however, defining
the range of student grades, said Sulli
van.
It is possible that every student in
one class receives a 3.2, a B + , or it is
possible that a few students receive the
top grade, 4.3. and a few students fail.
Such a situation provides an incen
tive lot top students to take classes with
professors known as "spreaders," who
will give top grades, and for struggling
students to take classes with
"dumpers," knowing that they will
probably receive at least a B.
Law student Shana Scarlett said in
an e-mail, "Somehow a disproportion
ate amount of women are ending up in
most of the classes where the [clump
ing] penalty is the strongest."
Since students currently depend on
reputation and rumor for differentiat
ing professors, some are requesting
knowledge of which professors are
"spreaders" and "dumpers." Others,
and some professors, would prefer that

the standard be "spreading" the grades
over a normal distribution.
Requiring professors spread out
grades would address some distor
tions, but, Sullivan asked, "what if you
have a class where everyone is at the
high end of the GPA?" Students whose
work is normally at the top of the class
would receive merely an average
grade, leaving their achievements un
rewarded.
"The majority of students are con
cerned about the impact a change
would have upon Stanford's culture, "
said John Malik, the Law Association's
other co-president.
The freedom of tfie current
pass / fail system makes Stanford "a
friendlier, more hospitable place to
pursue a legal education," he said. His
concern is particularly strong because
"student access to internal decision
procedures is very limited."
At next week's meeting of the Stu
dent Cabinet, comprised of representa
tives from the Law Association and
other student organizations, Sullivan
plans to share information from the
faculty's discussion of grading issues.
After further dialogue among stu
dents and faculty, the final recommen
dation of the committee for a change
would not occur until, at earliest, the
beginning of this summer, said Sulli
van.
Right now, she emphasized, "every
thing is on the table."
