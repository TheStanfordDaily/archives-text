LONDON (AP) — On his first visit to the
West as Russian president, Vladimir Putin
pledged yesterdav that his countn would not
drift back into isolation, hut would seek
friendlier ties with Kurope — despite sharp
differences over (ihcclmva.
I'utin promised to implement economic
reforms, defend propertx ow net sand root out
corruption to attract foreign investment, and
Prime Minister Tony Blair responded In say
ing the newlv elected Russian "talks our lan
guage on reform."
"()f course, one could follow the logic of iso
lation, but I'm entirelv convinced that such
logic is absoluteK inappropriate not onlv in
relations with (ireat Britain but the rest of
Kurope," Putin said .it a joint news conference
with Blair.
I he Russian leader later traveled to Wind
sot (iastle, where he had a Ii()-minute private
audience with Queen Kli/abeth 11. before fix
ing to the I kraine.
Putin's 24-hour stop in London — the cen
terpiece of his first foreign trip — appeared to
signal a strengthening of ties between the two
nuclear powers. Putin already showed signs of
cultivating Britain by inviting Blair to visit him
in St. Petersburg last month.
Blair's aides said Britain is ideallv suited to
provide a bridge not onl\ between Russia and
the Luropean Lnion but also Russia and the
I nited States, whose relations have deteriorat
ed in the past year.
"Some say that because of our concerns

about (hecluiva, we should keep some dis
tance from Moscow," Blair said. "I share this
concern .... but I believe the best wax to get
results is b\ engaging with Russia, not isolating
Russia."
( \ it its argued, however, that Blair was pre
mature in welcoming Putin, a longtime KCiB
s|)\ who never lu-ld elected office until last
month's presidential vote. I he\ reiterated
allegations that Russian troops have used
excessive force and executed civilians in
( hecluiva.
But while demonstrators had promised to
dog Putin's \isit. the number was smaller than
expected. About .">() people carried placards
.md waved ( hcclien flags .is his black, bullet
proof limousine slid out ofMie foreign office
parking lot for a quick sightseeing tour of the
capital.
During the joint news conference with
Blair. Putin strongh defended his troops'
actions in Checlmva and said he hoped his
visii would put Russia's views across more
clearh to the West, which has condemned
with near unaniinitv Moscow's hardline
approac li in the breakawax republic.
Putin also sowed to stabilize his countrv's
unruh econoim iu a bid to lure back badh
needed foreign investment.
During a meeting with British business lead
ers, he acknowledged that Russian instabilitx
had put oil investors, but said he was deter
mined to proceed with reforms of the lax code,
the judicial svstein and the burdensome

bureaucracy.
"Russia is not a shortened map of the ex-
Soviet I tiiou, it is a countr\ which has tremen
dous self-confidence, a self-confidence based
not onh on our experience of reform but on
errors we have committed," Putin told the (ion
federation of British lndustn.
On nuclear cooperation, Putin praised the
ratification of the STAR 1 II treaty on l rida\ In
the Russian Parliament, the Duma, and said he
disc ussed with Blair the I nited States' desire to
amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile I reat\.
Blair said Britain could help bring together
Russian and I'.S. positions on the ABM treats,
which the I nited Slates wants revised to allow
it to establish nationwide anti-missile defenses.
Russia has said if that happens, it will scrap
STAR'I II and other treaties curbing nuclear
and conventional weapons.
"Our role in this is ver\ much to tr\ and
build understanding of the respective points of
view both of Russia and the West and Russia
and the I nited States of America." Blair said.
Yesterday, the White I louse announced that
President ( linton will travel to Moscow in earh
|une lor a lwo-da\ summit will) Putin.

day's brief summit would be followed up will)
