back lo life yesterday, driving
ihe Nasdaq composite index to
a record point gain, as
investors mustered some confi

the w ret kage of last week's sell
ing f'ren/.v.
I lie Nasdaq and the Dow
Jones industrial average each
rose more than 200 points after
alternating between positive and
negative territor\ throughout
the day.
But on the broad market,
most stocks fell again as the bar
gain hunters remained leery of

While we have some bargain
hunters, we have a lot of
investors who were hurt very
badly, so it's not likely that the
market will regain its enthusi

Still, it was encouraging to see
signs of stability, especially since
foreign markets had tumbled
overnight in reaction to Friday's
brutal slide on Wall Street,
which sliced a record 017 points
oil the Dow and a record 355
points off the Nasdaq.
