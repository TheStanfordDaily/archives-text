Fake Air Force Base even exists.
I he 8,000-square-mile base is 75
miles northwest of Fas Vegas, in
the arid, rugged Nellis Range.
Beginning with the 1-2 sp\
plane in the 19505, the base has
been the testing ground for a host
of top-secret aircraft, including
the SR-71 Blackbird and, more
recentlv, the F-l 17A stealth fight
er and B-2 stealth bomber.
I lie base's airspace is restrict
ed; airc raft are not allowed to fly
over it. Satellite overflights, how
