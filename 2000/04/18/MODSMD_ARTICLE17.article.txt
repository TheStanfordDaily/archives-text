## FARM LIFE Oh, that pro fro feeling 
### 
I point to Admit Weekend as being one of the
defining moments in my high school life;
note the words "high school" rather than
"Stanford." I say this because pro fro week
end showed me this whole new world that 1 was
soon going to be a pat t of (1 was early decision so I
knew it was going to be this particular world ahead
of time) and man, I couldn't wait.
It was as if I had been deluding myself all

through high school or some
thing. I had thought I was really
enjoying it and that it really
couldn't gel any better. But
those three days in April 1998 —
the following Monday, back in
AP Calculus, 1 looked around
me and all 1 could think to
invsell was, "1 cannot wait to get
out of here." I had been at the

same school, in the same build
ings, for IS years, with the same 90 people.
Yes, ( hi is had been deluding himself into
thinking he couldn't he happier anywhere else but
the Hackley School. Admit Weekend changed
that; it was like a blinking-eye glimpse of the new
experiences that would be my next lour years. In
that sense, pro fro weekend was the event that pre
pared me more loi bidding a loud liirewell to the

rather than preparing me for coining to Stanford
that would come with Orientation in Septem

Hut this past weekend, well, they were every
where. Bright-eyed and bushv tailed, with the
same reel loldeis and habit oi roving around in
giant packs conducive to making upperc lassinen
think everyone's running with the Band, the pro
fios were übiquitous entities.
At brunch, the line ec hoed not with card swipes
but with c ardboard punching sounds. I heard anx
ious convei sations between u hat I presumed to be
voung-looking l ioSo( o-ers about studying in the
library that afternoon. However, when I listened
closely, the two wanted to siucl\ in (ircen not fin
an Kcon midterm, hut instead lor AP exams.
AIM A sense of nostalgia and leai washed ovei
me. 1 hen I wondered why a senior in high school
visiting Stanford for the weeketid wanted to studv

a clc• lillillg experience, bill ilicv were noisy, and I
was tired. I had work to do. I did not want a piece

of their boundless-energy-happy-joy-fun. Was 1
ever quite that excited about "Cafe Night" at the
French House?
It makes me nervous that two years later 1 feel
this way; I still love it here no matter what, but the
social adventures of pro fro weekend and even
freshman year seem very long ago and disconnect
ed from the present (lln is — and I c an't figure out
why. Perhaps in 10 years when I know, I'll send a
letter to the editor and share the answer.
Pro fro weekend highlights the best parts of
Stanford without the work. 1 think for a more
authentic experience, pro fros should be forced to
go to a le< lure Friday afternoon with their admis
sion contingent upon them completing a problem
set due that Sunday when they leave.
Alt, what a fun weekend that would turn out to
be. No joyous merry-making Saturday night. Oh,
no, the pro fros would be learning another valu
able skill beyond partying — pulling their first col
lege-level all-nighter. What fun! I guess that's why
I got turned down when I applied to be one of the
organizers lor this year's Admit Weekend. ( I hat's
a joke).
It wasn't that I was jealous of the pro fros. lobe
honest, partying nonstop for three days doesn't
sound like a lot of fun anymore. Maybe a little, but
not something I'd be sad I missed out on. I've been
there, done that already. What I remember most
of m\ own pro fro weekend was walking around
and know ing .ill of this would be mine in just four
months'time. Flic Quad. Flicks. Parties. Amazing
lectures. Palm trees. Ihe Foothills by moonlight.
Sun (well, generally sun — more than New Yoi k at
least).
if anvthing, I was jealous that the burgeoning
new-found realization of what was to come I felt
then was now kind of gone. But I felt better look
ing at what I've done so far, and thinking, hey, I'm
oulv at the midway point! And slowly, I shared iu
that same feeling the pro fros were feeling.
In sum, as my pro fro weekend showed me in\
near future encapsulated in three amazing days,
this yeai s .Admit Weekend showed tne just how far
I've come and how much things have changed —
and ( hanged, in my opinion, for the better, hi
evei \ pro fro is a reflection of some part of all of us,
just a few years ago.
We may bemoan three days of an overcrowded
campus, but it's a time that we as official students
can use to c heck our own progress and selves, to
learn about not about what will come, but from
where we've come. And I think that realization is
|iist as important as what the pro fros learned dur
ing these past lew clays: Congratulations — we're
growing up.

the Hackley School. Admit Weekend changed
that; it was like a blinking-eye glimpse of the new
experiences that would be my next lour years. In
that sense, pro fro weekend was the event that pre
pared me more loi bidding a loud liirewell to the
salet) and security of high school and senior year
rather than preparing me for coining to Stanford
that would come with Orientation in Septem
ber.
Hut this past weekend, well, they were every
where. Bright-eyed and bushv tailed, with the
same reel loldeis and habit oi roving around in
giant packs conducive to making upperc lassinen
think everyone's running with the Band, the pro
fios were übiquitous entities.
At brunch, the line ec hoed not with card swipes
but with c ardboard punching sounds. I heard anx
ious convei sations between u hat I presumed to be
voung-looking l ioSo( o-ers about studying in the
library that afternoon. However, when I listened
closely, the two wanted to siucl\ in (ircen not fin
an Kcon midterm, hut instead lor AP exams.
AIM A sense of nostalgia and leai washed ovei
me. 1 hen I wondered why a senior in high school
visiting Stanford for the weeketid wanted to studv
loi a lest fbn 1 weeks awav. I'erhaps the pro Iros
have also been sucked into the jov that is (ireen.
I he words "Biug \\'ing," I am convinced, contain
a magic s| »c-lI that lures students into the "Being
|ohn Malkov i( h-cs<|iic slacks of the "new" Bing
Wing (reineinbei the seven-and-a-liall floor?),
never to relurn.
I will also admit to finding (lie admits annoying.
I know that is conipletelv c allous and mean of me,
seeing as I. too, was once in tlieii shoes and having
a clc• lillillg experience, bill ilicv were noisy, and I
was tired. I had work to do. I did not want a piece

of their boundless-energy-happy-joy-fun. Was 1
ever quite that excited about "Cafe Night" at the
French House?
It makes me nervous that two years later 1 feel
this way; I still love it here no matter what, but the
social adventures of pro fro weekend and even
freshman year seem very long ago and disconnect
ed from the present (lln is — and I c an't figure out
why. Perhaps in 10 years when I know, I'll send a
letter to the editor and share the answer.
Pro fro weekend highlights the best parts of
Stanford without the work. 1 think for a more
authentic experience, pro fros should be forced to
go to a le< lure Friday afternoon with their admis
sion contingent upon them completing a problem
set due that Sunday when they leave.
Alt, what a fun weekend that would turn out to
be. No joyous merry-making Saturday night. Oh,
no, the pro fros would be learning another valu
able skill beyond partying — pulling their first col
lege-level all-nighter. What fun! I guess that's why
I got turned down when I applied to be one of the
organizers lor this year's Admit Weekend. ( I hat's
a joke).
It wasn't that I was jealous of the pro fros. lobe
honest, partying nonstop for three days doesn't
sound like a lot of fun anymore. Maybe a little, but
not something I'd be sad I missed out on. I've been
there, done that already. What I remember most
of m\ own pro fro weekend was walking around
and know ing .ill of this would be mine in just four
months'time. Flic Quad. Flicks. Parties. Amazing
lectures. Palm trees. Ihe Foothills by moonlight.
Sun (well, generally sun — more than New Yoi k at
least).
if anvthing, I was jealous that the burgeoning
new-found realization of what was to come I felt
then was now kind of gone. But I felt better look
ing at what I've done so far, and thinking, hey, I'm
oulv at the midway point! And slowly, I shared iu
that same feeling the pro fros were feeling.
In sum, as my pro fro weekend showed me in\
near future encapsulated in three amazing days,
this yeai s .Admit Weekend showed tne just how far
I've come and how much things have changed —
and ( hanged, in my opinion, for the better, hi
evei \ pro fro is a reflection of some part of all of us,
just a few years ago.
We may bemoan three days of an overcrowded
campus, but it's a time that we as official students
can use to c heck our own progress and selves, to
learn about not about what will come, but from
where we've come. And I think that realization is
|iist as important as what the pro fros learned dur
ing these past lew clays: Congratulations — we're
growing up.
