.nut read .1 fat lualh incorrect attack letter to the editor
authored l>\ Patrick ('.oilman that questioned out
iutcgritv .nul ,K<omplishments. Contrary to (oilman's
assertions, out slate possesses experience working on
YSSI issues that extends hack to our freshman year
with lien's w< >ik .is an ASS I Senate Associate.
I his work has continued this year with Ben's role as
the deputv senate chair and Mike's role as the chair ol
the Student Allans (onnnittee. We have created a plat
fin m. Students first, tli.it is built upon collaboration and
communication with students and student group lead
ers as well as our experience and accomplishments on
this year's ASS I undergraduate senate. We stand by
the record of the ASSI undergraduate senate as well as
out record of involvement and accomplishment as two
verv active members of this bodv.
(tollman's letter tails to convey out true level of par
ti( ipation in this sear's ASSI projects, including:
I) Helped launch Stanford Alter Midnight. Begin
ning last spring, we brainstormed with current ASSI
President Mike Levin as well as his campaign manager,
Josh fried, on ideas which eventually came about as the
Stanford Aliei Midnight program. We drafted, as well
as distributed in White Plaza, tlu- athletics facility survey
that provided the ASSI with the necessary student
input to push lot extensions in the hours of I residder
fitness, Ford ('.enter and deGuerre racquetball courts.
In addition, we l)ooked space and a band for the Stan

lord Aliei Midnight launch party. We were also in
attendance at a follow-up meeting less than two weeks
alter Stanford After Midnight was implemented and
helped secure a commitment from Dean of Students
Marc Wais that the hours of fresidder fitness and
other program participants would not Ik- scaled back.
2) Post Office Reform. I lie first mention of student
concerns about Stanford post office issues in the min
utes ol the undergraduate senate was made by Ben in
his "Report of (he Deputy ('.hair." Ben was one of the
original members of the Post Office Task force, which
collectivelv developed a strategy' to pressure the post
ollice administration into c hange. Mike and Ben Ix>th
attended follow-up meetings with students, administra
tors and postal officials both on and of 1 campus.
3) Make the ASSI a Resource for all Student Croups
and Improve Student (Iroup funding Process. Ben was
one ol the co-authors of the change in by-laws that for
malized the transition to a new funding system. A.s a
member of the Appropriations ('.onnnittee, Ben was
directly responsible for allocating money and imple
menting the new system. Ben and other members of
the Appropriations Committee also developed guide
lines for the funding of student groups not covered by
the by-laws and instituted a formal method to follow' up
on student groups' use of funds. Ben lias been involved
in the ASSI for three years, thus (oilman's claim that
"this was .. . significantly before Liu ... could have
been involved" is baseless, as he was an ex-oflicio mem
ber of the undergraduate senate before the presidential
slates ('.oilman mentions Ixvanie meinlxTs of the Exec
utive Office.

Daily sparks discussion with
gooa election coverage
As a student who lias been very involved in the
ASSI Kleitions this year and last, and as ;i member
of the ASSII was glad to see the letter from senior
Patrick ('.oilman ("Liu and Dudas conducting dis
honest campaign") and the accompanying article by
Megan kni/.e ("Accomplishments of ASSI slate
under lire") in yesterday's edition of 1 he Daily.
So frequentl\ in the last two election cycles have
the races for presidential candidates and slates
become popularity contests, and in some instances,
personally defamatory. It was refreshing as a candi
date and as a politically aware and involved member
of the community, to see Patrick's letter.
I lis letter, along with the article, represent for me
the instigation of an intellectual discourse surround
ing real issues and accomplishments among the can
didates, the sort of which is befitting of students at
Stanford.
Yesterday's edition of I lie Daily provoked
widespread discussion about the ASSI elections and
candidates across the campus. It is this kind of ele
vated disc ussion and debate, not among the candi
dates per se, but, mote importantly, among Stanford
students in general, that really makes the elections of
individuals to these important offices relevant and
best-representing of the diversity of interests existent
at Stanford.
As every Stanford student is a member of the
ASSl 1 , it is our duty to become educated voters as to
the ideas and accomplishments of those we elect
into office. I lie kind of political discussion begun in

The Dailv yesterday is more important than any
(Iyer that goes up or any sticker you might wear into
class.
Few activities and weeks are more important at
Stanford, in my view, than the week of the student
government elections here. Not only does this week
create a forum for promoting student involvement
and activism in all areas, hut it unites the student
Ix>dv in a way that rarely happens at other points
throughout the year.
Most student organizations campaign for special
fees, and students in all classes campaign for class
presidents and undergraduate senate. This week
anually has become very important, not because of
the thousands of fliers that flood White Plaza and
your bathroom stalls, but, rather, due to the
increased awareness and involvement of students
and the discussion around ideas and accomplish
ments of our c andidates.
I respect and applaud the quality and cogency
with which Patrick addressed the facts and issues in
this year's ASSU Elections and applaud The Daily
for giving such an important situation the space it is
due. It is my sincere hope that yesterday's edition of
the paper serves as an example for all candidates,
and indeed .ill engaged Stanford students, of honest,
accurate and forward-looking political discussion as
to who are the best-qualified candidates to run our
student government.
