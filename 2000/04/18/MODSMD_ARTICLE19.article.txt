.nut read .1 fat lualh incorrect attack letter to the editor
authored l>\ Patrick ('.oilman that questioned out
iutcgritv .nul ,K<omplishments. Contrary to (oilman's
assertions, out slate possesses experience working on
YSSI issues that extends hack to our freshman year
with lien's w< >ik .is an ASS I Senate Associate.
I his work has continued this year with Ben's role as
the deputv senate chair and Mike's role as the chair ol
the Student Allans (onnnittee. We have created a plat
fin m. Students first, tli.it is built upon collaboration and
communication with students and student group lead
ers as well as our experience and accomplishments on
this year's ASS I undergraduate senate. We stand by
the record of the ASSI undergraduate senate as well as
out record of involvement and accomplishment as two
verv active members of this bodv.
(tollman's letter tails to convey out true level of par
ti( ipation in this sear's ASSI projects, including:
I) Helped launch Stanford Alter Midnight. Begin
ning last spring, we brainstormed with current ASSI
President Mike Levin as well as his campaign manager,
Josh fried, on ideas which eventually came about as the
Stanford Aliei Midnight program. We drafted, as well
as distributed in White Plaza, tlu- athletics facility survey
that provided the ASSI with the necessary student
input to push lot extensions in the hours of I residder
fitness, Ford ('.enter and deGuerre racquetball courts.
In addition, we l)ooked space and a band for the Stan

lord Aliei Midnight launch party. We were also in
attendance at a follow-up meeting less than two weeks
alter Stanford After Midnight was implemented and
helped secure a commitment from Dean of Students
Marc Wais that the hours of fresidder fitness and
other program participants would not Ik- scaled back.
2) Post Office Reform. I lie first mention of student
concerns about Stanford post office issues in the min
utes ol the undergraduate senate was made by Ben in
his "Report of (he Deputy ('.hair." Ben was one of the
original members of the Post Office Task force, which
collectivelv developed a strategy' to pressure the post
ollice administration into c hange. Mike and Ben Ix>th
attended follow-up meetings with students, administra
tors and postal officials both on and of 1 campus.
3) Make the ASSI a Resource for all Student Croups
and Improve Student (Iroup funding Process. Ben was
one ol the co-authors of the change in by-laws that for
malized the transition to a new funding system. A.s a
member of the Appropriations ('.onnnittee, Ben was
directly responsible for allocating money and imple
menting the new system. Ben and other members of
the Appropriations Committee also developed guide
lines for the funding of student groups not covered by
the by-laws and instituted a formal method to follow' up
on student groups' use of funds. Ben lias been involved
in the ASSI for three years, thus (oilman's claim that
"this was .. . significantly before Liu ... could have
been involved" is baseless, as he was an ex-oflicio mem
ber of the undergraduate senate before the presidential
slates ('.oilman mentions Ixvanie meinlxTs of the Exec
utive Office.

Daily sparks discussion with
gooa election coverage
As a student who lias been very involved in the
ASSI Kleitions this year and last, and as ;i member
of the ASSII was glad to see the letter from senior
Patrick ('.oilman ("Liu and Dudas conducting dis
honest campaign") and the accompanying article by
Megan kni/.e ("Accomplishments of ASSI slate
under lire") in yesterday's edition of 1 he Daily.
So frequentl\ in the last two election cycles have
the races for presidential candidates and slates
become popularity contests, and in some instances,
personally defamatory. It was refreshing as a candi
date and as a politically aware and involved member
of the community, to see Patrick's letter.
I lis letter, along with the article, represent for me
the instigation of an intellectual discourse surround
ing real issues and accomplishments among the can
didates, the sort of which is befitting of students at
Stanford.
Yesterday's edition of I lie Daily provoked
widespread discussion about the ASSI elections and
candidates across the campus. It is this kind of ele
vated disc ussion and debate, not among the candi
dates per se, but, mote importantly, among Stanford
students in general, that really makes the elections of
individuals to these important offices relevant and
best-representing of the diversity of interests existent
at Stanford.
As every Stanford student is a member of the
ASSl 1 , it is our duty to become educated voters as to
the ideas and accomplishments of those we elect
into office. I lie kind of political discussion begun in

The Dailv yesterday is more important than any
(Iyer that goes up or any sticker you might wear into
class.
Few activities and weeks are more important at
Stanford, in my view, than the week of the student
government elections here. Not only does this week
create a forum for promoting student involvement
and activism in all areas, hut it unites the student
Ix>dv in a way that rarely happens at other points
throughout the year.
Most student organizations campaign for special
fees, and students in all classes campaign for class
presidents and undergraduate senate. This week
anually has become very important, not because of
the thousands of fliers that flood White Plaza and
your bathroom stalls, but, rather, due to the
increased awareness and involvement of students
and the discussion around ideas and accomplish
ments of our c andidates.
I respect and applaud the quality and cogency
with which Patrick addressed the facts and issues in
this year's ASSU Elections and applaud The Daily
for giving such an important situation the space it is
due. It is my sincere hope that yesterday's edition of
the paper serves as an example for all candidates,
and indeed .ill engaged Stanford students, of honest,
accurate and forward-looking political discussion as
to who are the best-qualified candidates to run our
student government.

4) Student \ oice. Ben played a major
role in the Roble Theater Proposal. While
Aronowitz initiated the proposal, it would
not have been considered by the Roble stall
and residents without Ben's work in coordi
nating meetings with Roble representatives.
Ben also helped write a draft of the propos
al and attended many meetings in trying to
build consensus around the project. We
also played a leading role in the planning of
the Student Voice Forum; we were integral
in conceiving and planning the Student
Voice Forum. In addition to communicat
ing with Dean Wais to reserve space for the
Forum, we helped create the information
[jacket that was distributed at the Forum,
advertise to students about the Forum and
presented two of the five key reports that
were given during the Forum.
5) Create Stanford Traditions / Pro
gramming. In addition to being responsible
for fully implementing and creating the
11 esidder Concert Series, we worked with
the junior class presidents to provide a band
(Scott Flay and Company) for a Junior
Night at the (loffee I louse. The ASSU also
worked with the senior class presidents to
provide a viewing of the Stanford-Arizona
basketball game in the Tresidder courtyard,
an idea which Mike helped to originate.
These events both helped to foster class
unity.
6) Improved Housing and Dining and
initiated the Draw Cuide. Ben coordinated
efforts with Henry Towsner to put together
this year's thorough version of the ASSU
Draw Guide. On multiple occasions, he
t(x)k pictures of residences and developed
publicity efforts including flyers and e-mails
to get students to fill out the survey and
then use the Draw Guide to make choices.
7) New Student Space. It is totally off
base to claim that, " The founding of the
Roble Theater Working Group .. . was
nearly entirely the work of Steven
Aronowitz." Ben was a member of the
founding group and played a major role in
drafting the proposal and moving it to con
sideration.
8) Graduate Student Rights. As deputy
chair of the undergraduate senate, Ben sat
on the Executive Committee of the ASSU.
He worked to improve communication and
coordination between the CSC and the
undergraduate senate on issues affecting
the student body as a whole. We attended
more than one GUP meeting and helped
convince undergraduates to attend in sup
port of the graduate student efforts.
9) More Transportation Options. Coff
man claims to have had "many personal
interactions" about this subject, yet has
never spoken to either of us about it. We
were very active members of this commit
tee, helping to brainstorm necessary pro
grams such as rental cars on campus,
extended Marguerite service to San Anto
nio Shopping Center and Safeway, Webvan
accounts for dorms, and subsidized safety
rides for students stuck off campus.

10) Student-Ted Review of the Advising
System. While Ashok Redd\ was the leader
of this effort, it is no exaggeration tosa\ that
we were very active participants in this pro
cess. As a member of the Undergraduate
Senate Academics, Resc.tich and Evalua
tion (ARK) committee, we have met with
administrators, including Tori White, the
director of the Undergraduate Advising
Center and F.llen Woods, the associate vice
provost for Undergraduate Education, as
well as spoken with Ashok on multiple occa
sions about advising issues. The ASSI
Teaching Awards will be given out this
spring, and, as (loffrnan claims, Reddv and
the fellow members of the ARF. committee,
will participate in the project.
We also stand bv the "What We Will
Accomplish" section of our platform which
addresses new initiatives as well as a num
ber ol unfinished projects which we plan to
work with the ASSU, SSE and the student
bodv to complete:
I ) New Student Union. We plan to take
the efforts of the past two ASSL presidential
slates a step further In actively soliciting the
input of student groups and students and
drafting a New Student Union Report that
we will use to ensure that the interests of the
students are put first in the creation of a
new student union.
2) Post OH ice Reform. Ben was an active
member of the task force which brought
post office problems to light, and we plan to
continue our work on the post office in the
coining year by appointing a Student Audit
Board to ensure that the post office does
not revert back to its old practices as soon as
it moves back to its old location.
3) ASSU Banking Online. While the
.ASSU and SSE are working to bring ASSU
banking online, this project has still not
been completed. We have spoken with
numerous student groups who have indi
cated that this is an essential step for the
ASSU to take, and we plan to ensure that
this project is followed through to its com
pletion.
4) Further streamline the funding pro
cess; make the ASSL more ac cessible; help
support ethnic and community groups.
While Coffman may feel that these initia
tives lack vision, we feel that they are indica
tive of our vision of an ASSL that truly
serves as a resource for all students and stu
dent groups. We have a plan to accomplish
this vision, which includes more issue-ori
ented Student Voice Forums, more out
reach and regular meetings with ethnic and
community centers. We also plan to create
union.stanford.edu, which will combine
ASSU Banking Online, an online student
group space reservation svstem and a com
plete online calendar for student groups, as
well as mam more student-oriented fea
tures.
5) Student(s) on the Board of Trustees.
Placing student(s) on the Board of Trustees
is in line with our plan to increase student
representation at al levels of Universitv deci
sion-making by increasing the strength of
the Nominations Commission as well as
helping to shape the new University admin
istration's perception of true student repre
sentation.

(')) Traditions and the Big Game Bonfire.
Improving the spirit and excitement sur
rounding Big Game Week and ii it l easing
the amount of all-campus programming
are very accomplishable goals and essential
to fulfilling out vision of helping to build
community at Si ud.
7) All-Campus I.vents. We are certain
that the ASS I Constitution holds no clause
that claims that building campus unity and
community "is ver\ much the role of class
presidents and not of the ASSI." In fact,
class presidents are actualh elec ted officials
<>l \SS hicli indicates that these
is- <ue veiv in.v ii the role of the ASSI'.
S) I lousing am I I )iuing, (iracluate I lous
ing and I'liiversih meal plans. We have
spoken with numerous students who are
not content with the current state of I'ni
versit\ meal plans, the Draw and upper
class and graduate housing issues. While
Coffinan mav believe that these issues
"don't ailed the whole student body," we
whole-heartedly disagree and plan to
address these essential issues in the coming
year.
9) Transportation Options. Contrary to
('.oilman's assertions, the I niversitv has not
yet proven that it will lull) follow through
on the pilot programs that it has begun to
implement. In lad, these pilot programs,
outlined above, were supposed to have
been implemented during fall quarter but
have been dclaved. We plan to ensure that
the I niversit\ follows through on its obliga
tion to provide fieshmen as well .is the
entire student bod\ with essential trans
portation options.
We are frustrated and deepl\ saddened
that our opponents' supporters and cam
paign staff are attempting to turn this pres
idential race into one of smears and lies.
These tactics deprive the student body of a
balanced and objective base lor choosing
their student representation. We encourage
all students to disregard these blatantly
political tactics and base their decision not
on spin but on the valid ideas, issues and
plans upon whic Ii the two presidential slates
have based their campaigns.

Support for Liu and Dudas
We, as members of this year's ASSU
Undergraduate Senate, are concerned with
the implications from Patrick ('.oilman's let
ter to The Daily yesterday. In the letter, he
claimed that Ben Lin and Mike Dudas were
not involved in many of the accomplish
ments that they have claimed responsibility
for. We wholeheartedly disagree with this
opinion.
fhe ASSU Undergraduate Senate is a
collective body; all accomplishments of that
body are equall) shared amongst the mem
bers of the body. Ben Liu, Mike Dudas and
all other members of the Senate deserve an

equal amount of credit for what has l)een
accomplished this year. Although some
members have taken leadership on certain
projects, each member of the senate has
had an integral role in our success this year.
As Liu and Dudas' colleagues, we are
happy to share our accomplishments with
them. In the remaining few days of the
campaign, we hope that the slates and their
supporters locus on the campaign issues
alone. We encourage the voting electorate
to talk to tlie candidates, visit their Web sites
and make their own judgement on which
slate would best fulfill the ollice of ASSU
president / vice president.

As the people who w ill be or hope to be
involved in the ASSU next year, we want
the strongest, most effective leaders possi
ble, and there is no question that Ben Liu
and Mike Hildas fit that description.
In their years with the ASSU, Ben and
Mike have proven themselves strong lead
ers. At times, they have taken the lead in
pushing exciting and significant projects
forward, such as the Tressider Concert
Series and the Student Leader Dinners. At
other times, Ben and Mike have been will
ing to support others in their own pro
grains, contributing their time and energy
to making sure that other people succeed.
Projects like this year's Draw Guide and
the Roble Theater Proposal exemplify
this. We hope to work with Ben and Mike
in the ASSU next year because we can rely
on them to both pursue their own goals
and support us in ours.
Ben and Mike have run a positive,
issue-oriented, campaign in which they
have expressed not only a vision, but a
plan. Their platform contains substantial
but achievable goals, things that will
improve the life of every student on cam
pus without wasting time tilting at wind
mills.
Ben and Mike, in their leadership roles
on the Senate this year, have demonstrat
ed an ability to bring people together,
both within the ASSU and outside it. We

hope that next year, as ASSU president
and vice president, they will have the
opportunity to demonstrate this again.
Join us in voting for Ben Liu and Mike
Dudas and for a strong, united, and, most
of all, effective ASSU.

As members of the Roble Theater com
mittee — two out of the six who consis
tently attended the ongoing meetings for
the project — we would like to clarify and
emphasize Ben Liu's contributions to the
group.
Ben made great efforts in communicat
ing with Roble residents, organizing the
meetings themselves and co-authoring the
final proposal. More so, Ben persisted in
relaying vital information to those most
responsible for any ultimate decisions on
that proposal. Without Ben's efforts, it is
doubtful that the lines of communication
between the ASSU, the Office of Residen
tial Education, the house staff and resi
dents and the performing arts communi
ty would have been sustained or even
achieved.
It is clear that Steven Aronowitz's con
tributions as a member and a leader of the
group were indispensable, however, this
fact should not overshadow Ben's also
substantial efforts.

Daily runs biased article
Your front-page article entitled
"Accomplishments of ASSU Slate Under
Fire" may be the most misleading and
unethical piece that 1 have ever read in
the peninsula's oldest morning newspa
per. While Patrick Coffman is undoubt
edly a valued member of the Stanford
community, he does not deserve five
columns to share his opinion. And even
if his opinions seem more enlightening
than analysis provided by The Daily
staff, you should not dedicate an entire

article to the beliefs espoused by a for
mer Web projects director.
I am neither a former Web develop
er nor a former ASSU Cabinet member.
But I do know that programs initiated
by any government come from commit
tees and teamwork. No one person is
completely responsible for any initia
tive. But we should not be shocked —
and there should not be a front page
expose — when a candidate from with
in the system claims to have contributed
significantly to programs initiated dur
ing his or her term. As readers, we
should be even more suspicious when
other insiders (like Senator Aimer
Khan) cast significant doubt on the alle
gations of Coffman. By running the
story, The Daily created a controversy
in a vacuum.

The election coverage provided on
April 17 reveals, in my opinion, an obvi
ous endorsement of the Newton / Ville
gas ticket. How unfortunate that a col
lege campaign has turned so ugly. I
only hope that next year The Daily bet
ter masks its biased reporting. But, in
the interim, I expect to see five columns
granted to a Liu / Dudas supporter so
that he or she can respond to every alle
gation. And there must be a front-page
article regarding the response.

ASSU election "debacle" irrelevant
I would not feel compelled to write to

The Daily if I wasn't absolutely appalled
by the embarrassing, disgusting ASSU
debacle. To put it bluntly: the world of
ASSI politics is a world of unbridled
self-aggrandizement and laughable self
absorption, and it should be duly
ignored. As a current senator in this
mind-bogglingly ineffectual organiza
tion, 1 should hope to be taken at my
word when 1 say that the debate
sparked yesterday in The Daily was the
result of ugly, behind-the-scenes postur
ing inspired In prideful. bitter people
who use the ASSI to validate their oth
erwise lonely, empty lives.
This is not to sa\ that I either repu
diate or endorse yesterday's indictment
of Liu and Dudas for dishonesty; 1 don't
care to take a public stance on an issue
motivated not by meaningful concern

about the welfare of the student body,
but by manipulative, self-impressed
resume-stuffers. In the end, all I can do
is exhort the student body not to vote
for either presidential slate. Regardless
of who wins, the small concessions (like
Stanford After Midnight) granted to the
students — those that fuel hollow cam
paign banner-waving — are fallout
from the well-meaning, yet tokenistic
condescension of administrators who
generally have far greater things to
worry about than whether you can get
Ramen at 1:45 a.m. at Tressider
Express.
