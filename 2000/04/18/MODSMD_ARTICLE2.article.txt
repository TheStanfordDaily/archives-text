### GREG PAGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Yesterday, President Clinton
addressed the "digital divide,"
speaking to a crowd of ninety
teachers, parents and students
gathered at Plugged In, a tech
nology-access center lor East Palo
Alto residents.
The term "digital divide" de
scribes the technology gap that
exists between wealthy and low
income (it izens.
Alter the President's speech,
Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fio
rina, Covad Communications
President and CEO Robert
Knowling, the Rev. Jesse Jackson
and WNBA star Rebecca Lobo
joined Clinton in a panel discus
sion. They fielded audience ques
tions and offered predictions for
the future of the information age.
Clinton's 15 minute speech
stressed the importance of tec h
nological development in low-in

come communities.
He began bv telling the story
of East Palo Alto, a community
originally known as Ravenswood
that was set to be the last stop of
the transcontinental railroad.

1 lowever, when plans lor the rail
road route changed, the commu
nity now known as East Falo Alto
was bypassed completely.
Drawing a distinction between
the new economy and that of the

19(h century, Clinton insisted,
"No one has to be bypassed this
time around . . . it's going lo take
(lie efforts of government, busi
ness and the communication sec
tor to succeed."

Referring to East Palo Alto,
Clinton said, "1 don't think there
is a better place in the world to
show what can be done."
To show the potential for
growth in the area, Clinton held

up a copy of Sunday's San Jose
Mercury News and stated, "There
are 10,000 technology-related
jobs advertised in this paper."

President Bill Clinton, accompanied by friend Rev. Jesse Jackson, applauds the efforts of Plugged In and surrounding
technology firms for helping to bridge the "digital divide."
Clinton then spoke about the
need for greater technological
training and education which
would allow people to fill those
jobs, thus further driving the
economy.
In the panel discussion, Lobo
opened by saying, "My message
to kids is to follow their dreams . .
.. Now the Internet is the way for
them to be able to . . . pursue
whatever dream that is."
Jackson told the audience,
"YVe are now in a cultural revolu
tion .... We need to shift from
high-tops to laptops." He said, "I
see young America catching on."
Fiorina offered hope for the
future. "Information technology
and the Internet can be a great
equalizer," she said. "It people
have the tools, if people have the
skills, they can have equal access."
knowling, however, observed
that certain communities seemed
to remain "fundamentally dis
connected." Me explained, "I am
a firm believer . . . that this is all
about environment. We still live
in an environment where the
open access is not there" for qual
ified women and minorities.
Clinton concluded the panel
by predicting that technology will
create a "radical alteration" in the
way people work. He emphasized
that his goal was to see high tech
nology as pervasive in American
households as the telephone.

The day's events began with a
speech from Plugged In Director
Magda Kscobar, who introduced
several Plugged In students and
staffers, each of whom gave brief
speeches.
Kast Palo Alto Mayor Sharifa
Wilson spoke next, declaring,

"Today is a wonderful (lav for Last
Palo Alto. We welcome the oppor
tunity to engage in dialogues with
the administration ... to find
ways to bridge the digital divide."
After the opening speeches,
the Castano Middle School c hoir
sang several songs, some of which

included lyrics about tec hnology.
Plugged In, established in
1992, is, according to its literature,
"a community technology center
with a mission to ensure that
everyone in Kast Palo Alto, Cali
fornia has the opportunity to fully
benefit from nil that the infbrma

tion revolution has to offer."
In addition, the center offers
programs that train teenagers in
the latest Web design technology
and a Technology Access C'.enter
which provides community
members with access to comput
ers and the Internet.
