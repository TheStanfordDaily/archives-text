# Role of Nom Com evaluated as Haas search narrows
## 
### SCOTT DORFMAN STAFF WRITER 
The search for a new director for the
Haas Center for Public Service will likely
culminate in a final selection by the end
of May, according to Vice Provost for
Student Affairs James Montoya, the head
of the search committee.
Some controversy has surrounded the
search committee in recent weeks, cen
tering on the decision by Montoya to
choose independently the two student
representatives, seniors Antonia Welch
and Nikki Love, that sit on the commit
tee, rather than going through the ASSU
Nominations Commission handle the
job.
The Nominations Commission is com
prised of six to seven undergraduate and
graduate students. It is "responsible for
interviewing and nominating student
members to positions on the 40 to 45 per
manent University Committees," accord
ing to Stephanie Cheng, chair of the
Nominations (loin mission.

While it is not mandatory to use the
Nominations Commission to c hoose the
student members on search commit
tees, such as the Haas director search
committee, some students feel that
Montoya should have consulted with
the commission before picking Welch
and Love.
"You can't really say you have student
representation on any committee with
out any democratic mechanism lor
choosing the students who sit on a search
committee," said Tim Ly, a junior who
described himself as a concerned student
heavily involved with the Haas Center.
"Without going through Norn Com,
there are students sitting on a commit
tee," said Ly, "but there is not true stu
dent representation in any way."
Montoya said that his decision not to
use the Nominations Commission was
based upon the fact ih.it the commission
is not charged with the responsibility for
choosing members of search committees,
and that his two selections for student
representatives did provide for student

voice in I he I laas director search.
"My choice was to select the ASSU-
Nom-Cotn-appointed representative to
the Haas faculty steering committee,
[Love], recognizing she had been ap
pointed to that position previously by
Nom Com and that she was extremely
knowledgeable about Haas and would
be a tremendous asset," said Montoya.
"My second choice, [Welch], was the
choice of the Haas I nifying Board, a
group with which I have met on an an
nual basis for the past three years to dis
cuss student issues. According to the
I laas Center Web site, 111 B is the official
student voice within the Haas Center.
Therefore, it seemed logical to turn to
HUB and ask that they select a represen
tative to the search committee.
"Since then, it has become evident to
me that the ASSU would have preferred
that both members be selected through
Nom Com. Such an expectation reflects
what would be a change in the official
role of Nom Com. 1 believe strongly in
student voice, and the issue at hand is

how that is implemented, not whether or
not student voice should be heard."
(Cheng said that although she may have
preferred Montoya to utilize the Nomina
tions (Commission, she is satisfied with the
students chosen for the committee.
"There shouldn't be* an antagonistic
relationship between the administration
and the ASSU," (Cheng said. "They both
are working in a cooperative effort to
make sure students' voices are heard,
and just because interests conflict some
times, that does not necessarily signal a
deteriorating relationship. I here is al
ways more than one approach to the
most effective end, and I have faith in the
students chosen to be on the Haas com
mittee."
Montoya said the search for Haas di
rector has now narrowed down the field
to four candidates, and that he will be
meeting with the search committee and
interested students in the next month be
fore a decision is made.
"My hope is to have a new director in
place by mid to late May," he said.
