# Poet Gl√ºck delivers reading of new pieces
## Poet gives the last lecture of this year's Lane Lecture Series 
### DANIEL MOREAU 
Puli tzer-Prize-winning poet
Louise Cluck spoke last night at
Kresge Auditorium, ending tlns
year's Lane Lecture Series in Cre
ative Writing. Ihis series also
brought writers Peter Mathiessen
and l im O'Brien to campus this
year.
Gliick read from a new manu
script of poems to be published
next year under the title "The
Seven Ages."
Eavan Boland, the director of
the Creative Writing Program, in
troduced Gliick, saying, "From
her earliest work, [Gluck] has been
the architect, not just of style, not
just of tone, but of an ()rphic lyric,
so pared down, so pushed back to
the essentials that it has an author
ity which makes it utterly distinc
tive."
In order to describe Cluck's po
etry, Boland quoted from Cluck's
essay "Disruption, Hesitation, Si
lence": "I do not think that more
information always makes a richer
poem. I am attracted to ellipsis, to
the unsaid, to suggestion, to elo
quent, deliberate silence. The un
said, for me, exerts great power."
Boland praised Gliick as "one
of the finest nature poets we
have." Boland also characterized
Gliick's verse as "an eerily accurate
language, a l)eautiful command of

cadence and finally a deep and
memorable truth of feeling."
Alter the reading, Boland said,
"It was wonderful to hear new
work [by Cluck]; it was very pow
erful."
Professor of Knglish and poet
Kenneth Fields said, "It was a very
good reading. I admire Louise
Gliick greatly. It was especially
nice to hear all the poems in a con
tinual flow."
Senior Jenny Leidner echoed
Fields's sentiment that hearing the
poems without interruption was
good: "1 loved it. 1 liked hearing
the poems with few commentaries
in between. For me, it gave the
poems new meaning to hear them
in [Gliick's] voice."
Gliick fielded questions from
the audience after the reading.
She spoke on the trepidation in
embarking upon a new set of
p< )ems.
"The anxiety is always there to
produce work that will match my
last poems. Even at fifteen 1
thought I had written the best
poems I would ever write," she
said.
Gliick has published eight
books of poetry, including "The
Wild Iris" which won the Pulitzer
Prize for Poetry in 1993.
In addition, she has also re
ceived a National Book Critics
Award for"The Triumph of
Achilles" in 1985. In 1999 she was
named Chancellor of the Acade
my of American Poets.
Gluck will hold a colloquium at
the Margaret Jac ks Hall Terrace
Room at 11 this morning.
