## Volleyball ends year with losses Team falls to Cal State-Northridge, UC-Santa Barbara to finish regular season; MPSF playoffs lie ahead 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
If volleyball games went to just
13 points, things might have gone
the right way for the Stanford men's
volleyball team this weekend. Un
fortunately for the (Cardinal, games
go to 15, and a weekend of blown
leads ended in two losses for the
squad.
The No. 1 1 Stanford men's vol
leyball team (10-12, 9-1 I Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) dropped
its final two regular-season matches
last weekend to No. 12 Cal State-
Northridge (12-14, 7-12) and No.
14 U( '.-Santa Barbara (12-13,8-11).
The losses however, have no ef
fect on Stanford's playoff berth, as
the squad had clinched the seventh
seed in the MPSF Tournament
prior to the weekend. The Cardinal
hopes to turn around its two-game
losing streak this Saturday, when it
faces No. 2 Pepperdine on the road
for its first-round match.
"I think we are still better off
going into next weekend than we
were before the matches," head
coach Ruben Nievessaid in spite of
the losses. "We didn't quite make
enough good plays to win the
matches, but we did an excellent job
of not responding to the crowd. It
was an intense environment and
our guys stayed poised and mental
ly tough. It was good practice for
next week."
Looking ahead to next weekend
may have been part of the problem
with this weekend's losses.
"I felt like we were looking past
this weekend, anticipating play

oils." redshirt freshman Seth Ring
said. "We weren't entirely lixnsed
on the match as best we could. That
lakes an entire group effort from
everyone involved in our pro
gram."
Friday night, Stanford fell to the
North ridge Matadors, 15-9, 15-13,
13-15, 15-10. The Cardinal was
(breed to play without its leading
hitter, freshman Curt loppel, who
was suffering from a sore hip flexor.
Without loppel, the starting job
went to junior ('.uriis (ii aham, who
finished the night with 18 kills,
matching his career high, and a sea
son-high seven digs.
In game one the two teams
swapped the lead until Northridge
took oil from an 8-8 tie to a convinc
ing 13-8 lead with five consecutive
points, and Stanford could not re
cover.
In game two freshman Paul
Bocage served Stanford from 10-1 1
to a 13-11 lead. But the promising
lead was just the first of many that
Stanford could not hold during the
weekend as Northridge answered
Stanford's three-point surge with
three stuff-blocks to close out the
game.
Stanford was the first to 13 points
again in game three despite trailing
the Matadors most oft he game. The
squad capitalized on its 13-12 lead
and finished off the game.
"Seth Ring as libero gave us an
emotional lilt to win game three,"
Nieves said. "We were more spirit
ed and played better defense."
I he Cardinal could not cany its
momentum into game four, going
down 5-0,10-4 and 12-9 before sur
rendering the game and the match
to Northridge.
"Marcus [Skacel] had a good of
fensive match and serving match,"
Nieves said of his team-high 25 kills
and season-high two aces. "But
overall we did not have enough fire
