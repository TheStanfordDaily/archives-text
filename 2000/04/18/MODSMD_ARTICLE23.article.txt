No. I Stanford women's rugby team is heading to
the Final Four.
A 37-0 thrashing of No. 16 Smith College in the
round of It) and a hard-fought 17-0 defeat of No. 8
Virginia the following day have propelled the Cardi
nal to the national championships of women's rugby.
The Cardinal women have established them
selves as ,t national powerhouse in the past few years,
capturing the title last year. However, this champi
onship squad graduated nearly its entire starting
lineup, so maintaining last year's success has been a
challenge.
And though this year's team lacks the experience
and depth of last year, experienced coaching and an
excellent freshman class have been keys to this
strong team.
"Everyone stepped up amazingly quickly and we
have become a very strong team this year," said co
captain Veronika Muhlhofer.
Senior co-captain Biasha Mitchell also praises the
team's new members.
"I am blown away by how quickly the rookies
have picked up the game and by their undying ded
ication to the team. These rookies are really what will
carry us," she said.
I his weekend, it was a combination of the coach
ing. experience and energy that led to the victories.
Stanford got on the board early and never looked
back against Smith on Saturday. It was a clean, well
played game for the Cardinal, highlighted by sever
al spectacular plays by the backline.

as she popped up t lie ball, after a breakaway, to
freshman Felicia Gilbert, who ran it in for a try.
Blunt also added a try in the second half.

ner and a big contribution to the
team," said freshman Sonrisa
Lucero.
Sunday's matchup pitted Stan
ford against the Virginia Cavaliers,
who had defeated No. 9 Arizona

State to reach the round of eight.
This game remained intense
and scoreless until halftime and
was dominated by very physical,
tough play. The Cavaliers success
fully silenced Stanford's offense
through the first half and used
their strength and endurance to
stay on the Cardinal's half of the
field. 1 lie Stanford defense, how
ever, kept the match scoreless.

and Stanford took control of the
game, tallying 17 second-half
points.
"We were able to make the nec
essai \ adjustments to the offense,
and kept up the strong, coura
geous defense," Muhlhofer said.
"Stanford showed great heart, pas
sion and courage in this game. At
the end, that is how we managed to
pull out the win."
I lie Cardinal's first points were

converted as a result of a Virginia
penalty, as freshman Sandie Zuni
ga hit the 22-meter goal from c en
ter field.
Ajayi tallied the first try of the
game oil an impressive 55-meter
run, while Stanford's second try
was the result of a team effort, as the
Stanford scrum pushed its way to
ihe goal line and Mitchell touched
the hall down to record the try.
The women used incredible

teamwork on I><>ill offense and de
fense all weekend long.
Kvidence of Stanford's tena
cious defense is in the numbers:
neither opponent scored a single
point all weekend as the team
earned shutouts in both games.
I lie Sweet Sixteen was played at
Stanford, marking the first time
any part of the women's rugby
tournament has ever been held on
the West Coast, and the Cardinal

women were independently re
sponsible to organize (he entire
tournament.
