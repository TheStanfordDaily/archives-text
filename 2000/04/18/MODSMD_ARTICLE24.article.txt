### MATT MCQUINN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Sunday, the Stanford
women's golf team finished a dis
appointing fourth at the Peg
Barnard California Collegiate
Tournament on the Stanlbrd Golf
Course. This competition show
cased 1 1 West Coast teams, four
from the Pacific 10 Conference.
As the host team, the Cardinal
expected a high finish against its
mediocre competition. The only
team ranked above No. 6 Stanford
at the tournament was No. 3
Southern California. None of the
other teams were even ranked in
the top 10.
Despite its confidence going
into the tournament, the Cardi
nal's hopes for a high finish before
the Pac-10 Conference Champi
onships this week were dashed
with a disappointing second-day
score of 308. This score vaulted
them back, from their first-day,
one-stroke lead, into fourth to con
dude the competition (609), one
stroke behind UCLA (008) and
seven back from the victors, Wash
ington (602) and USC (602).
Individually, Amanda Moltke-

Letli ofUCI.A led the tournament
with an even-par 144. Stanford's
two junior stars, Stephanie Keever
and Hilary Homeyer, placed fifth
and ninth, respectively. Other fin
ishers for Stanford were JaeJcan
Ro (13th), Kim Rowton (1 9thj and
Saliniah Mnssani (43 rd).
Still, bad play did not dictate the
Cardinal's poor finish. While the
Cardinal did not play its best,
Washington and (JSC's final-day

scores of 301 were phenomenal
amid the cold and rainy conditions
on Sunday morning .it the always
difficult Stanford (101l C ourse.
"Ii is upsetting. We like to win
