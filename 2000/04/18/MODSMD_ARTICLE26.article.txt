## BYU overpowers reduced squad for easy wins in Provo, Utah 
### MATT LONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Saturday the No. 22 Stanford men's goll
team took a relatively inexperienced group to
brave the mountains ol Provo, I tali, and the
BYI Cougars taught the Cardinal a lesson in
jusi how to attack the elements and emerge vic
torious.
No. 5 BYI won both rounds of the day at
Riverside Coll Course, pulling away in the af
ternoon with .1 matt li-play win by an astounding
29 strokes, ii. which all live storing golfers shot
under par.
I he morning round was a head-to-head
match in whit Ii each team's goiters paired np in
order of theii rankings (Stanford's one and two
vs. BYI s one and two, etc.). I his segment was
(oniplit atetl In ii Hermit tent hail ant I snow cou
pled with heaw winds. BYI took that segment
by a store of 17.5 to 8.5.

"They gave us a pretty good shellacking,"
said head coach Wally Coodwin. "I think they
have a real good chance to win the National
Championship. I liey're a good team with real
gootl depth."
BYI head coach Bruce Brockbank acknowl
edged his team's outstanding ellort, saving "I
hope you're seeing the start ol the finishing
touches ol the season right here. It would be
something else if we can maintain this type of
pla\ through the remainder of the season."
Sophomore Andy Miller, ranked 20th na
tionally let I the field lor BYI with rounds of (Hi
and 70. Stanford's medalist was freshman Jim
Seki, who shot 71 and 12. Seki and junior Eric
Dahlberg, Nos. 3 and 4, respectively, were the
only pair to win in the morning, 6-3.
Senior captain Dusty Brett and junior Jimmy
Lee were Stanford's top two, and lost to Miller
and Billy Harvey, I 1-2. I he Cardinal left some
ol its more experienced golfers behind on the
trip, 11 loosing instead to bring along sophomore
Del tie Windt and junior Rudy Barretto. They
lost their morning match 9-0, but tie Windt
came back out as the sini shone later in the day

to sh(K)t a 74.
"Seki showed his mettle," said Goodwin.
"1 le's coming on strong, which is one outstand
ing positive thing that turned up this weekend.
()thei than that it was a typical mountain outing,
hail and wind in the morning and we came out
of lunch and the sun was out. So we wore shirt
sleeves in the afternoon"
Goodwin is quick to point out that the per
formance in Provo will not serve as an indicator
of the outcome at the Pac-10 championships,
held next week in Tempe, Ariz.
"With our top six [against BYU] it would've
been a different match. But now all the guys will
have an ability to show what they can do."
The Pac-lOs start on Monday, and the ex
tremely competitive field will include Arizona
State, Arizona and UCIA, all ranked in the top
25. In additon, four other Pac-10 schools are in
the top 50.
Brett, who shot a 70 Saturday afternoon, will
play in Tempe, as will Seki and juniors Alex
Ai agon and Jimmy Lee. The other two spots are
up for grabs and will be secured with playoffs
taking place in the next few days.
