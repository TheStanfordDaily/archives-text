It looked like an ordinary group of people
gathered together chatting on an ordinary day.
It was, however, 4 a.m. last Saturday morning,
and the conversation was anything but ordi
nary.
Paul Woodson, the coordinating member of
ilie White House advance team, was keeping
up to speed four Stanford student volunteers.
With the procedures clearly explained and
understood, Woodson proclaimed, "Centle
men, it's time to get the President."
And witli that, a convoy of more than 12 ve
hicles assembled and departed for the home of
the wealthy Silicon Valley executive who was
President (llinton.
Most people consider themselves lucky to
even < atch a glimpse of the Presidential motor
cade as it swiftly moves down the highway.
I ll is past weekend, however, several Stan
ford students were actually driving in the c ara
van.
Seniors Brian Hughes and Steven
Aronowitz, sophomore Nick Larson, freshman
Cynthia Mata and Education master's student
Ben Bolger, all active members of the Stanford
Democ rats, offered their services to the White

I louse this weekend and were considered
members of the advance team that coordinates
President Clinton's numerous trips.
Bolger found himself driving the lead press
van fin the motorcade at a time when most peo
ple were sound asleep.
"The schedule of the President is truly im
pressive," said Hughes. "He lias more energy
than just about anybody I know. (Lan you imag
ine keeping these kind of hours everyday?"
For the students involved in the motorcade,
the experience began Friday night. The stu
dent volunteers met at the Hyatt Hotel, where
they were briefed by Secret Service officials on
intensified procedures and security measures.
Security measures were intense, as the stu
dents were made well aware. "The safety of the
President is the most important concern we
have," said Secret Service Agent Jim Donald
son, the "point man," or head security officer,
for the weekend.
"You should know that the government has
performed extensive background checks on
everyone on the advance team," Donaldson
noted. "()ur check on you was the c leanest one
we have carried out in a while. It appears that
none of you even liacl a traffic violation."
After the meeting, the students drove in the
police-escorted motorcade to Moffett Federal
Airfield to pick up President Clinton. "It is eas
ier to contain activities here than at [the San
Francisco International Airport]," said Donald
son.
Within 10 minutes after Ait Force One land
ed, the convoy was traveling clown a closed-ofl

Highway 280.
By the end of the evening, the President was
delivered to the private home where he would
stay for the night. After returning members of
ihe press to their respective lodgings, most of
the Stanford students were ready for bed.
Bolger, who worked back-to-back shifts on
Friday evening and Saturday morning and af
ternoon, said that the motorcade "is a great way
to see how the pragmatics of American democ
racy play out on a real level. Ihe logistics of get
ting the President from Palo Alto to the Sequoia
National Park for him to talk about environ
mental protectionism are complex. Working
with the motorcade makes you appreciate the
tactical aspects of the President's daily sched
ule."
Bolger and Mata weie also on hand to escort
the President to the Stanford Golf Course for a
round of golf. "Whoa, keeping up with the
President is what 1 call lipi d to do," said Mata.
"Right now, 1 feel really honored to be a part of
all the excitement."
While sitting in the Stanford golf clubhouse,
Bolger said, "I knew it would be a long week
end when 112 signed on. But, it's a great oppor
tunity to help out the President. I did an in
ternship with the President back in 1995, so this
whole weekend brings back really fond memo
ries of public service."
On Monday, the students had photographs
taken with President Clinton, Senator Mark
Bennet of Utah and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
"What a weekend," Aronowitz said. "Now
it's back to the real world."
