University Provost John Hennessy
found himself in a somewhat dilli

Hennessy said he felt an "over-rid

that."

position as an insider represents
both a help and a hindrance.

"Mostly it's a help," he said.
"You know a lot of faculty." The
challenge? "People will have ex

challenges of his current job as
provost, I lennessy leapt to his feet

ments and programs. " The
