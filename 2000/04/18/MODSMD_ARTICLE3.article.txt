# Hennessy reflects on upcoming challenges
## Future president speaks on future projects, goals 
### JESSICA TUCKER-MOHL EDITORIAL STAFF 
As someone who called teach
ing "the best job in the world,"
University Provost John Hennessy
found himself in a somewhat dilli
c iilt position on April 3 — faced
with the question ol whether to ac
cept Stanford's presidency.
" 1 "he job of the president is an
important job," Hennessy said in
an interview with The Daily yes
terday morning, "driven by loyal
ty and commitment to the institu
tion."
At the moment of the decision,
Hennessy said he felt an "over-rid
ing sense of responsibility, and
[the] trepidation that comes with
that."
While current University Presi
dent Gerhard Gasper left the Uni
versity of Chicago to assume the
Stanford presidency in September
1992,1 lennessy has spent years
at Stanford. I lennessy said that his
position as an insider represents
both a help and a hindrance.

"Mostly it's a help," he said.
"You know a lot of faculty." The
challenge? "People will have ex
pectations."
Transitions
While handing over the reins of
the presidency may garner the
most campus attention, Stanford is
in fact fin ing a number of transi
tions within its administration:
Next \ car will bring a new provost,
,i new dean of Admissions and Ki
nancial Aid, a new Medical School
dean, a new dean of Religious I.ife
and a new director of the Haas
Genter for Public Service.
Hennessy is currently launch
ing the search for a new provost,
putting him in the opposite posi
tion he was in last year, when
(lasper chose him fin that office.
When asked to comment on the
challenges of his current job as
provost, I lennessy leapt to his feet
to provide a demonstration,
pulling out the current year's bud
get requests from various depart
ments and programs. " The
provost s job can be overwhelm
ing."
1 le said that the most impor-

ing.
taut aspect of the provost search
was to "find the most talented indi
vidual."
Ideally, that individual would
be a "strong scholar . . . someone
who would balance my exper
tise . . . . We'd like to find someone
from the [School of] Humanities
and Sciences if we could.
" l lie two biggest pieces [of the
provost position] are the budget
piece and faculty appointments
and promotions."
Hennessy expressed excite
ment over the I diversity's most
recent appointment, new Dean of
the School <>l Inclination Deborah
Stipek. "[She's] fantastic," he said.
"A few more brilliant c hoices [for
appointments] will help a lot."
Undergraduate education
An engineering professor by
background, Hennessy has en
dured scrutiny about his commit
ment to the humanities. Yester
day, he responded emphatically
that lie found the humanities im
portant.
"When we think about a Stan
ford undergraduate education,
|it's] the notion of the whole per
son," I lennessy said. "Undergrad
uate education is the foundation
for the rest of life."
"On the llip side," he contin
ued, "technology is inescapable."
for the humanities major, "who
may well go on to a major leader
ship position . . . we have an oblig
ation for them to have enough
grounding in science and technol
ogy.
"We should be able to offer
|that grounding] to all undergrad
uates."
When asked if that grounding
was current!) available, Hennessy
mentioned the Science, Mathe
matics and Fngiileering Core as an
attempt to do that, "with both
good and bad results." I lie pro
gram, which began with three
\ear-long options to till the under
graduate science requirement, was

reduced to one track this year.
In the same light, Hennessy
also cited the Computer Science
Department's offerings for non
majors.
One of Hennessy \s major cru
sades has been to integrate tech
nology into the classroom.
" Technology can he used to
play a number of different
idles .... We've seen examples
where it can help management of
large lectures like [Human Biolo
gy]. Professors can also use it to as
sess student awareness."
Drawing on his professorial ex
perience, Hennessy detailed ways
in which technology, for example
taped classes aired on I V, can be
used to facilitate student learning.
"Some students can just read
the textbook and they're fine," lie
said. "Some need to come to class
and see it again. And some stu
dents are better in a group of two
to three, watching something on
tape, stopping [it] and disc ussing it
amongst themselves."
Faculty issues
Hennessy spoke out on the re
cent controversy surrounding al
leged gender discrimination in
faculty appointments and promo
tions.
He said he would prefer not to
read in the press about gender dis
crimination at Stanford. " The best
thing . . . [is] to see if we can move
the debate back into the institu
tion."
I he U.S. Labor Department's
investigation into gender discrimi
nation at Stanford and recent
court cases, including the verdict
awarding damages to former
Medical Center researcher
Colleen Ctangle, "polarize" the
issue, I lennessy said.
"|\Ve need to] continue the
process we've been on," he said, by
"reaching out to underrepresent
ed communities . . . and being op
portunistic."
Hennessy and Vice Provost for
Faculty Affairs Patricia Jones held
a series of lunches with women fac -
ulty members to discuss the partic -
ular c hallenges they face. "Civen

flic* increasing stresses on families
in this area . . . [you're forced to
be] dual-career."
The "overwhelming" issues, as
I lennessy sees them, are "balance
of family, biological clock[s] and
tenure .... It's become more
stressful than in the past."
He cited on-campus day care
and increased flexibility in hous
ing programs as examples of sug
gestions for improvement.
In another faculty-related con
tern, Humanities Prof. Stephen
Orgel, a recent recipient of the
Guggenheim Fellowship, stated
that Stanford's sabbatical policies
were inadequate for a major re
search university.
Hennessy said that while most
science and engineering programs
contain an implicit research com
ponent, faculty in the humanities
must seek time away from their
regular responsibilities to do re
search. "It's crunch time across
c ampus; faculty have [always] been
busy and driven . . . [but] life has
become a little more frantic."
Student voice
In response to concerns about
the level of student participation in
the administrative decision-mak
ing process, Hennessy said, "I
think there's adequate representa
tion of student voice."
I le offered advice to student or
ganizers, saying, "students repre
sent such a large community with
such a diverse set of interests.
II the student community were
to "say, Here are our top two to
three issues, can we focus on
these?' " he said he feels that stu
dents would achieve better results.
I lennessy said that "the gradu
ate students have done a great job
of this," mentioning that last week
end's joint meeting of the Gradu
ate Student Council and the 112 acul
ty Senate was productive. "The
[undergraduate and graduate]
senate represents a different com
munication path into the faculty."
I lie two slates for the ASSU
presidential election have voiced
their desire to see a student on the
Board of Trustees. Hennessy re

sponded by saying that students
currently sit on the trustee com
mittees, and "that's where the real
work goes on. The Board [of
Trustees] validates the decisions of
the committees."
He said that having students on
the actual Board of Trustees rep
resents a logistical problem, given
that many issues dealt with by the
Board extend over many years
and the typical undergraduate
spends only four years at Stanford.
Vision for the future
"One of the marvelous legacies
of Casper," Hennessy said, "is
striving for a higher quality vision
in terms of architectural space."
Pointing to the Science and En
gineering Quad, he said, "we can
achieve higher density and higher
quality at the same time .... It's a
wonderful space that has open
spaces."
He suggested that the Universi
ty might need to either expand
Tresidder or build a new student
union. •
While housing remains an
issue, Hennessy expects to "deploy
land to combat the housing cri
sis .... It's one of our biggest chal
lenges."
Hennessy stated that his "acad
emic vision" for the future of Stan
ford involved making the under
graduate program "the best it can
be .... We're still in the process."
He said that while Stanford In
troductory Studies represented a
good start, the next step is to make
the program a permanent part of
the culture.
fie also hoped to increase
multi-disciplinary programs, en
gaging the sciences, the humani
ties and the professional schools as
well. "The best opportunities for
new scholarship fall on the bound
aries of [existing] fields."
In his final statement of a vision
for the future of Stanford, Hen
nessy addressed quality of life is
sues, stating that housing more
graduate students will increase the
size of the student community and
create new challenges.

that lie found the humanities im
portant.
"When we think about a Stan
ford undergraduate education,
|it's] the notion of the whole per
son," I lennessy said. "Undergrad
uate education is the foundation
for the rest of life."
"On the llip side," he contin
ued, "technology is inescapable."
for the humanities major, "who
may well go on to a major leader
ship position . . . we have an oblig
ation for them to have enough
grounding in science and technol
ogy.
"We should be able to offer
|that grounding] to all undergrad
uates."
When asked if that grounding
was current!) available, Hennessy
mentioned the Science, Mathe
matics and Fngiileering Core as an
attempt to do that, "with both
good and bad results." I lie pro
gram, which began with three
\ear-long options to till the under
graduate science requirement, was

reduced to one track this year.
In the same light, Hennessy
also cited the Computer Science
Department's offerings for non
majors.
One of Hennessy \s major cru
sades has been to integrate tech
nology into the classroom.
" Technology can he used to
play a number of different
idles .... We've seen examples
where it can help management of
large lectures like [Human Biolo
gy]. Professors can also use it to as
sess student awareness."
Drawing on his professorial ex
perience, Hennessy detailed ways
in which technology, for example
taped classes aired on I V, can be
used to facilitate student learning.
"Some students can just read
the textbook and they're fine," lie
said. "Some need to come to class
and see it again. And some stu
dents are better in a group of two
to three, watching something on
tape, stopping [it] and disc ussing it
amongst themselves."
Faculty issues
Hennessy spoke out on the re
cent controversy surrounding al
leged gender discrimination in
faculty appointments and promo
tions.
He said he would prefer not to
read in the press about gender dis
crimination at Stanford. " The best
thing . . . [is] to see if we can move
the debate back into the institu
tion."
I he U.S. Labor Department's
investigation into gender discrimi
nation at Stanford and recent
court cases, including the verdict
awarding damages to former
Medical Center researcher
Colleen Ctangle, "polarize" the
issue, I lennessy said.
"|\Ve need to] continue the
process we've been on," he said, by
"reaching out to underrepresent
ed communities . . . and being op
portunistic."
Hennessy and Vice Provost for
Faculty Affairs Patricia Jones held
a series of lunches with women fac -
ulty members to discuss the partic -
ular c hallenges they face. "Civen

flic* increasing stresses on families
in this area . . . [you're forced to
be] dual-career."
The "overwhelming" issues, as
I lennessy sees them, are "balance
of family, biological clock[s] and
tenure .... It's become more
stressful than in the past."
He cited on-campus day care
and increased flexibility in hous
ing programs as examples of sug
gestions for improvement.
In another faculty-related con
tern, Humanities Prof. Stephen
Orgel, a recent recipient of the
Guggenheim Fellowship, stated
that Stanford's sabbatical policies
were inadequate for a major re
search university.
Hennessy said that while most
science and engineering programs
contain an implicit research com
ponent, faculty in the humanities
must seek time away from their
regular responsibilities to do re
search. "It's crunch time across
c ampus; faculty have [always] been
busy and driven . . . [but] life has
become a little more frantic."
Student voice
In response to concerns about
the level of student participation in
the administrative decision-mak
ing process, Hennessy said, "I
think there's adequate representa
tion of student voice."
I le offered advice to student or
ganizers, saying, "students repre
sent such a large community with
such a diverse set of interests.
II the student community were
to "say, Here are our top two to
three issues, can we focus on
these?' " he said he feels that stu
dents would achieve better results.
I lennessy said that "the gradu
ate students have done a great job
of this," mentioning that last week
end's joint meeting of the Gradu
ate Student Council and the 112 acul
ty Senate was productive. "The
[undergraduate and graduate]
senate represents a different com
munication path into the faculty."
I lie two slates for the ASSU
presidential election have voiced
their desire to see a student on the
Board of Trustees. Hennessy re

sponded by saying that students
currently sit on the trustee com
mittees, and "that's where the real
work goes on. The Board [of
Trustees] validates the decisions of
the committees."
He said that having students on
the actual Board of Trustees rep
resents a logistical problem, given
that many issues dealt with by the
Board extend over many years
and the typical undergraduate
spends only four years at Stanford.
Vision for the future
"One of the marvelous legacies
of Casper," Hennessy said, "is
striving for a higher quality vision
in terms of architectural space."
Pointing to the Science and En
gineering Quad, he said, "we can
achieve higher density and higher
quality at the same time .... It's a
wonderful space that has open
spaces."
He suggested that the Universi
ty might need to either expand
Tresidder or build a new student
union. •
While housing remains an
issue, Hennessy expects to "deploy
land to combat the housing cri
sis .... It's one of our biggest chal
lenges."
Hennessy stated that his "acad
emic vision" for the future of Stan
ford involved making the under
graduate program "the best it can
be .... We're still in the process."
He said that while Stanford In
troductory Studies represented a
good start, the next step is to make
the program a permanent part of
the culture.
fie also hoped to increase
multi-disciplinary programs, en
gaging the sciences, the humani
ties and the professional schools as
well. "The best opportunities for
new scholarship fall on the bound
aries of [existing] fields."
In his final statement of a vision
for the future of Stanford, Hen
nessy addressed quality of life is
sues, stating that housing more
graduate students will increase the
size of the student community and
create new challenges.
As someone who called teach
ing "the best job in the world,"
University Provost John Hennessy
found himself in a somewhat dilli
c iilt position on April 3 — faced
with the question ol whether to ac
cept Stanford's presidency.
" 1 "he job of the president is an
important job," Hennessy said in
an interview with The Daily yes
terday morning, "driven by loyal
ty and commitment to the institu
tion."
At the moment of the decision,
Hennessy said he felt an "over-rid
ing sense of responsibility, and
[the] trepidation that comes with
that."
While current University Presi
dent Gerhard Gasper left the Uni
versity of Chicago to assume the
Stanford presidency in September
1992,1 lennessy has spent years
at Stanford. I lennessy said that his
position as an insider represents
both a help and a hindrance.

"Mostly it's a help," he said.
"You know a lot of faculty." The
challenge? "People will have ex
pectations."
Transitions
While handing over the reins of
the presidency may garner the
most campus attention, Stanford is
in fact fin ing a number of transi
tions within its administration:
Next \ car will bring a new provost,
,i new dean of Admissions and Ki
nancial Aid, a new Medical School
dean, a new dean of Religious I.ife
and a new director of the Haas
Genter for Public Service.
Hennessy is currently launch
ing the search for a new provost,
putting him in the opposite posi
tion he was in last year, when
(lasper chose him fin that office.
When asked to comment on the
challenges of his current job as
provost, I lennessy leapt to his feet
to provide a demonstration,
pulling out the current year's bud
get requests from various depart
ments and programs. " The
provost s job can be overwhelm
ing."
1 le said that the most impor-

ing.
taut aspect of the provost search
was to "find the most talented indi
vidual."
Ideally, that individual would
be a "strong scholar . . . someone
who would balance my exper
tise . . . . We'd like to find someone
from the [School of] Humanities
and Sciences if we could.
" l lie two biggest pieces [of the
provost position] are the budget
piece and faculty appointments
and promotions."
Hennessy expressed excite
ment over the I diversity's most
recent appointment, new Dean of
the School <>l Inclination Deborah
Stipek. "[She's] fantastic," he said.
"A few more brilliant c hoices [for
appointments] will help a lot."
