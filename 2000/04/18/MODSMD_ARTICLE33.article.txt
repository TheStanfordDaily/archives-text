# Newton-Villegas aim to increase student voice
## 
### DENNIS TYLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I lie grueling elections have
l>egun, and juniors Seth Newton
and Malia Villegas feel more than
qualified to be the leaders of next
year's ASM .
"I think Malia and I are in a
great position because we come
from both within and outside of
die ASSI J," said Newton "Malia
was in the Senate in '98-'99, in
\s hi( h she was also chair of the Ap
propriations Committee lor one
(juartei and co-c hair the other two
quarters. And I have tremendous
experience with coordinating
groups outside of the ASSI J. So it
gives us really good look al stu
dent representation and student
organizing on the campus as a
whole."
Villegas agrees. "It is impor
tant to have a view of how the
ASSI Senate works to know what
your limitations are," she said.
"But to have someone who is not
a part of the ASSI is key because
you can afford an outside view
that someone inside of the ASSI
would not be able to see. Setli has
some amazing visions, and I am
here to show linn how decisions
are normally handled on the
ASSI committees."
Newton and V illegas have al
ready made plans to include Presi
dent-elect |olm Hcnnessy in their
work. Because of llennessy's de
sire to support the student involve
ment, Newton and Villegas said
they feel he can enhance their ide
ologv, the Platform for Account
ability and (lhange.
In addition, acotding to New
ton and Villegas. I lennessy's posi
tion on the tenure process concurs
with their ideas.
"One of our main objectives is
to increase diversity on this cam
pus and one way to do that is
through the tenure process, espe
cially by getting more student in
volvement in the process." said
Villegas. "Since Mennessy has al
readv made significant ( hanges to
the tenure process, we hope to
c (Mitinue on his success."
According to Newton and Ville
gas, iheir peers nominated them .is
the best candidates foi the posi
tion.
"A core gi oup of five or 10 peo
ple on PAt actualh elected ns as
the best representatives for Presi
dent and vice president," said
Newton. "We are running bee ,inse
of the group's dec ision. Malia and
I were formed from PAC, we did
not urate PA(b\ s.uiug that we
wanted to run."

PAC plans to strengthen stu
dent voice at the administrative
level so that students have more
power in Stanford community de
cisions.
"We chose this platform be
cause we definitely want to en
courage student involvement in
decision-making on c ampus," said
Newton.
I lie team says that its biggest
goal for the next term is to increase
student involvement.
"I would like students to be in
volved in decision-making bodies
so that they can have a voice on is
sues that concern tlieni from the
very beginning," said Newton.
According to Villegas, "We feel
we can alleviate student frustra
tions by making [students] more
involved on committees at the ad
ministrative level. Once this hap
pens, all of those other issues like
post office and dining issues will be
a lot easier to deal with."
Villegas supports student rep
resentation on the Nominations
Commission, but believes "those
representatives should be able to
come to the ASSI so that we c an
make sure that their opinions are
representative of a large portion of
the student body."
Communication between the
(Graduate Student Council and
the I ndci graduate Senate is also
of grave concern to the candi
dates.
"()ne thing I would like to |do|
is to actively involve the senators in
the Undergraduate [Senate] and
(iS(I in their vision. A lot of times,
they are doing their own projects
and I think if we find a way to have
more committee work, we will
have better communication," said
Villegas.
When asked how to describe
themselves in one word, both
Newton and Villegas were forth
right in their answers.
"I would say that I am people
oriented," said Villegas. "I am very
much interested in finding out the
interests of other people as well as
sharing my interests with them.
I lie way I learn more about myself
is by learning about other people."
Newton describes himself as "a
listener. I have a very strong need
for pubic service and justice for the
greater community. And in order
to do that, one has to be good lis
tener," said Newton.
Both Newton and Villegas say
tli.it their most memorable Stan
ford experiences have been the
things they are most passionate
about.
"What changed the way I look
al things was the strike al Berke

lev.' said Villegas. I lie hunger
siulsc, in support ol the Berkeley
Kihni< Studies Departnient, took
place May 1999.
" I here was so much dedication
and solidarity between all of us, re
gardless of our Berkeley rivalry or
the lac I that it was Dead Week. It
was I nil v inspii ing. 1 was at a point
where I needed to meet some
beautiful people at Stanford and I
met those Stanford students at
Berkeley."
Newton describes his most
memorable experience as "devel
oping this platfoi m because I had
the chance to show people the im
poi tain eol 111 is (ampaign."
I .ooking back on their Stanford
careers, the candidates sav thev
have few regrets.
"I have taken so much Ire>lll
success and failures that each lias
brought Ine to this point and I
would not like to give it back, said
Villegas. "So 1 real In don 't have
anything that I would do diller
cntly."
()nc suggestion the\ would give
to incoming Ireshnien is to "pace
yourself."
"It is important to do as mam
things as possible w liilc here, but
one must also understand |hisj
commitment to that organiza
tion and w hat that means," said
Newton.
