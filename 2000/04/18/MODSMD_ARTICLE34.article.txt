### DENNIS TYLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Arc the VSSI presidential and vice-presidential
candidates proposing issues that the Stanford coin
innnity is concerned about? Or are there more im
portant issues that should he addressed on campus?
I liese are <|iiestions that students must grapple with
in the elections beginning tomorrow.
I he presidential slates are raising five major is
sues: increased student voice in University decisions,
student involvement in the tenure-granting process,
student membership on the Board of Trustees, in
creased graduate housing and the construction of a
new student center.
Increasing student involvement and representa
tion on campus has long been ;m important issue on
campus.
"I don t feel that administrators completely recog
nize hov\ essential it is for student representatives to
be chosen by students to ensure an accurate repre
sentation of the student body," said ASSU Vice Presi
dent |olui Mills.
1 he presidential candidates are discussing
whether student voice should also extend to the
tenure process. With more professors being denied
tenure, students feel the need to be more involved in
the process of w ho should receive tenure. But how ef
fective will students be in this role?
"Although I support the increase of more student
voice on campus, I am not sure how beneficial it
would be to have students choosing what professors

should receive tenure." s.iid freshman l.vndon (>ill.
I his sort of apprehension has .ilso been expressed
about a possible stuclctit role on the Board ol
I rustees, especially h\ lop administrators.
University President (lerhard (laspei is openh
against the idea of having students on the hoard.
"It would not he beneficial to have students on the
hoard because all the meetings are confidential and
cannot be discussed outside of the meeting." he said.
Another issue ol concern is the lack of graduate
housing.
"If Stanford wants to attract more top graduate
students, they definitely need to find more adequate
housing. ()therwise graduate students will cease coin
ing here and choose to go to Ivy League |schools],
such as Princeton and Yale." said Bio-Psychology
doctoral student Michael M< Manns.
In light of other concerns, students question
whether a new student union is one of the more im
portant issues supported by t he candidates.
"Before allocating more money towards the devel
opment of a student activity center, 1 feel that there
are greater needs to he addressed b\ Stanford, such
as increasing funding lor the ethnic centers on cam
pus," said senior Brian Rikuda, co-chair ol the Black
Student I nion.
Other student representatives have expressed a
similar view. According to Mills, "the ASS I has
reached a point where providing more student ser
vices can only be taken so far. I lie time is right to take
the ASSU to the next level and increase student voice
and involvement," he said.
Added James Jordan, interim director ol the Black
Community Services (Center. "I'm glad that students
are making Stanford a place that better serves their
needs. It is indicative of the positive direction that the
Universitv is taking."
