Student cars, a student union
and student entertainment: 1 lie
slate <>! juniors Ben Liu and Mike
Dudas has big goals lor the ASSL
presidency and vice presidency,
and they say that new Hues in the
University's administration can
only help their plans.
"With a new president, a new
provost .md with our platibrm and
ideas, we c an do a lot â€” more than
we've ever clone," said Liu, who is
majoring in electrical engineering
and who serves as deputy senate
chair.
Dudas, a public policy major
and an ASSL senator, began work
ing with Deputy Senate Chair Liu
t his year. He said he "appreciated
(lie energy" and decided to run
with Liu because he felt "there was
no one else who had more interest
and excitement than Ben." Based
on their work in the ASSL, I hey de
cided to create the platform Stu
dents First.
"We're going to begin working
011 dav one," Dudas said. "We have
the foundation, and we feel like we
can achieve goals we're excited
about because there won't be that
much of a learning curve."
Liu and Dudas said they com
plement each other well: Liu is
more interested in student groups
within the ASSL and Dudas is
more interested in preserving tra
dition.
"We've had a fairly productive

year and both ol lis can lake some
credit for that," Lin said.
The slate's biggest issue is im
proving Tresidder Student I Dion.
This year, Dndas was in c harge of
the 1 residder Concert Series,
which brought several bands to
campus while the Coffee House
was being remodeled.
"We want to make Tresidder a
better student union and start the
drive toward a new Tresidder,"
Lin said. If elected, the duo will
begin In creating a virtual student
union which will include central
ized space for student groups and
an online calendar system. Dndas
and Liu say they will ask students
for ideas about an ideal student
union, and they hope to bring an
architect to campus to give initial
estimates and plans.
"We're going to have forums so
it's actually a student union and
not a community union," Liu said.
"We're going to get a commitment
from the University to get a new
I residder." Dudas added that ne
gotiations are underway to bring a
nationally-known pizza vendor to
campus so students' food selection
will improve. While they empha
size that they do not promise to
build a new I residder, they vow to
c hange to the current area signifi
cantly.
"We want a place where stu
dents have fun, they can do work
and groups can store things," Liu
said. "We waul real options for stu
dents, and real food options."
Liu lias also worked on the

Ruble Theater proposal, which is
;i plan to prov ide more perform
ing space lor theater groups.
Hildas and Liu say they hope to
plate more emphasis on the arts
