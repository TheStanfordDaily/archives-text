I hev've spent ail average of 70 hours a week in the
ASM offices, attended hundreds of meetings, an
swered hundreds of calls and met hundreds ofpeo-
P le -
And in a little more than a month, it will all be
over. ASSU President Mike Levin and ASSU Vice
President |<>lin Mills have live more weeks in office.
I.ooking back at the past 12 months — and ahead
to the upcoming elections — Levin and Mills talk
lieely about all they've learned, the new perspective
on Stanford that 11 icy have gained and the insight
the) now have into what makes good ASSU leader
ship.
"There's not enough time to do everything you've
planned," said Levin. "What's important is the phi
losophy of leadership you bring into office. Your
principles. 1 he way you deal with people."
Mills echoed Levin's words. "The plan is impor
tant. l he approach is more important."
Accomplishments
Levin and Mills say they inherited much of their
underlying philosophy from their predecessors,
Maren Norton and Santos Maroquin. And much of
what they accomplished this year was made possible
l>\ the foundation Norton and Maroquin laid.
According to Levin and Mills, Norton and Maro
quin did an enormous amount to build trust and es
tablish a smoother relationship between students
and administrators.

Because <>l (his, 1 ,e\ in and Mills were able to con
centrate this year on gaining the belief and trust ol
the very students they were elected to represent.
Both leel that the\ have gained the support of the
student body. Levin feels that students either don't
know what the ASM does or have a positive impres
sion of the senate. "1 hardly get any hate mail any
more," he joked.
One way in which the ASSI has gained student
support is In making tangible contributions to im
proving student lift*.
Levin and Mills built their leadership strategy
around three main points: advocacy, initiatives and
programming. "We advocated on behalf of the stu
dents through initiatives and programming," Levin
said.
Both Levin and Mills see theii greatest accom
plishment as making a successful transition to the
new structure of the ASM — the separate graduate
and undergraduate senates. "I think it's turned out
amazingh well — bettei than anyone expected,"
Mills said.
Levin and Mills have spent ;i great deal of time
making sure graduate students receive equal repre
sentation, but Levin s.iid he let the (Iraduate Student
Council operate largely independently. I he lines of
communication remained open, however, and Levin
and Mills are proud of how smooth the transition to
separate senates has been.
"I think it's important that John be the most
knowledgeable graduate student on undergraduate
issues, just as it's important that I be one of the most
knowledgeable undergraduate on graduate issues,"


CAROLINE CONWAY/Stanford Daily File
Levin and Mills call their year leading the ASSU the "experience of a lifetime." The two have five more weeks in of
fice.
Levin said.
"Half of our responsibilit\ is
graduate students," Levin said.
"We're representing 7,500 gradu
ate students and about 0,400 un
dergraduates.
Both Levin and Mills agree that
their most "tangible and substan
tive" accomplishment is the Stan
ford Alter Midnight program.
Through this program they
"proved themselves to students."
Mills said.
Levin is especially proud that
Stanford After Midnight will be
around for a long time — even
after he and Mills have left Stan
ford. "After Midnight increases
the flexibility by which people
act," Levin said.
Another accomplishment in
which Mills in particular takes
pride is the re-organization of the
funding and structure of publica
tions within the ASS I .
A similar achievement was the
re-organization of the process ol
student group funding. Rather
than applying for money for an
entire quarter, student groups c an
now apply for funding for a spe
cific event."It is now much easier
and more convenient for student
groups to get funding," Mills said.
Other accomplishments Levin
and Mills cite are the redesign of

Polio Rev — now called I lie free
house. the initiating of post office
reform and the S;ifci\ 112 irst cam
paign. I he campus lighting initia
tive, too, lias improved the level.ol
safety on campus.
I ,e\ in mentioned the letter lie
w rote to President ol the Board ol
I rustees Robert Bass advocating
placing both an undergraduate
and a graduate student on the
presidential search committee as
one of the things ol which he is
most proud. Dual representation
is an issue to which I .cvin lias de
voted enormous attention.
Levin and Mills have also laid
the foundation not onl\ Ibr a new
student union, but also a new
10,000-sc]uare-fbot Last Campus
student c enter, which w ill be locat
ed between Wilbur and Stern.
Levin and Mills have earned a
reputation as tenacious lighters, a
c|iialit\ which served them well
throughout the hundreds of
hours the\ speni working to save
the Tovon fating ('.lubs.
Regrets
Despite their main successes,
Levin and Mills do wish that they
had focused their efforts on some
other ke\ issues.
"Something we should've done
better is worked on having siu
dent representatives on commit
tees chosen by the students
[through the Nominations Com
mittee],'' Mills said.

For Levin, his biggest regret is
that "I've made no headwav on
c hanging the wav the school looks
at Residential Kducaiion." lie
leels ili.it the I niversitv should
spend more nionev and clfort
working on inter'-department ad
vising and lapping into graduate
students as a resource fbi advis
ing.
On a larger scale, Levin and
Mills have been disappointed in
some ol the things tliev ve learned
about the I niversitv.
"I've been disappointed that
I've found people working here
that care more about their jobs
than students," Levin said. "II
that's the way they feel, tliev
shouldn't be working at a college.
I hev should want to make this a
beltei school. I hev should be
honest about their dec isions and
win t hey made I hem."
Mills discussed the wavs in
which Stanford has changed in his
eves since being in office. " I liings
here aren't perfect, just like any
other organization. | Hav ing led
the ASSI ] brings you down to
earth from your loftv ideals."
Reflections
If there's one thing Levin and
Mills agree on, it's thai this past
year has been an invaluable and
tinfc»i gettablc experience.
" I his past veai has made me a
better person." Lev in said. "It has
forced me lo work harder than

ever before about something 1 was
passionate about. Hi it I've made
so many sacrifices — academic, so
cial and personal."
Mills agreed. "This is the expe
rience of a lifetime," he said. "I've
learned so much about how to
deal with people and met so many
amazing people. It has definitely
been a positive experience. But it
takes so much out of you. Once
vou've had it, von don't want lo re
peat it."
Both Levin and Mills describe
their time as ASSL leaders as "an
eye-opener." It's a "reality check,"
Mills added.
"You see parts oft he school you
wouldn't see reading the
brochure," 1 .ev in said.
I hev are proud of the funda
mental ideals they brought to the
job. most importantly in increas
ing student advocacy. And both
see next year as the year "to take
the ASSL to the next level." Now
that the ASSI has earned the re
spect and trust of both the admin
istration and the student body,
tliev sav the time has come to step
up the fight lor students."
file Levin / Mills team has not
only worked hard — they've
worked hard together. "I've never
fell like I had a vice president,"
Lev in said. John has done just as
much work and cared just as
much as I have. I hope we're re
membered lor having woi keel lor
students and done all we could —
together."

Reflections
If there's one thing Levin and
Mills agree on, it's thai this past
year has been an invaluable and
tinfc»i gettablc experience.
" I his past veai has made me a
better person." Lev in said. "It has
forced me lo work harder than

ever before about something 1 was
passionate about. Hi it I've made
so many sacrifices — academic, so
cial and personal."
Mills agreed. "This is the expe
rience of a lifetime," he said. "I've
learned so much about how to
deal with people and met so many
amazing people. It has definitely
been a positive experience. But it
takes so much out of you. Once
vou've had it, von don't want lo re
peat it."
Both Levin and Mills describe
their time as ASSL leaders as "an
eye-opener." It's a "reality check,"
Mills added.
"You see parts oft he school you
wouldn't see reading the
brochure," 1 .ev in said.
I hev are proud of the funda
mental ideals they brought to the
job. most importantly in increas
ing student advocacy. And both
see next year as the year "to take
the ASSL to the next level." Now
that the ASSI has earned the re

worked hard together. "I've never

And in a little more than a month, it will all be
over. ASSU President Mike Levin and ASSU Vice
President |<>lin Mills have live more weeks in office.
I.ooking back at the past 12 months — and ahead
to the upcoming elections — Levin and Mills talk
lieely about all they've learned, the new perspective
on Stanford that 11 icy have gained and the insight
the) now have into what makes good ASSU leader
ship.
"There's not enough time to do everything you've
planned," said Levin. "What's important is the phi
losophy of leadership you bring into office. Your
principles. 1 he way you deal with people."
Mills echoed Levin's words. "The plan is impor
tant. l he approach is more important."
Accomplishments
Levin and Mills say they inherited much of their
underlying philosophy from their predecessors,
Maren Norton and Santos Maroquin. And much of
what they accomplished this year was made possible
l>\ the foundation Norton and Maroquin laid.
According to Levin and Mills, Norton and Maro
quin did an enormous amount to build trust and es
tablish a smoother relationship between students
and administrators.

Because <>l (his, 1 ,e\ in and Mills were able to con
centrate this year on gaining the belief and trust ol
the very students they were elected to represent.
Both leel that the\ have gained the support of the
student body. Levin feels that students either don't
know what the ASM does or have a positive impres
sion of the senate. "1 hardly get any hate mail any
more," he joked.
One way in which the ASSI has gained student
support is In making tangible contributions to im
proving student lift*.
Levin and Mills built their leadership strategy
around three main points: advocacy, initiatives and
programming. "We advocated on behalf of the stu
dents through initiatives and programming," Levin
said.
Both Levin and Mills see theii greatest accom
plishment as making a successful transition to the
new structure of the ASM — the separate graduate
and undergraduate senates. "I think it's turned out
amazingh well — bettei than anyone expected,"
Mills said.
Levin and Mills have spent ;i great deal of time
making sure graduate students receive equal repre
sentation, but Levin s.iid he let the (Iraduate Student
Council operate largely independently. I he lines of
communication remained open, however, and Levin
and Mills are proud of how smooth the transition to
separate senates has been.
"I think it's important that John be the most
knowledgeable graduate student on undergraduate
issues, just as it's important that I be one of the most
knowledgeable undergraduate on graduate issues,"

Levin and Mills call their year leading the ASSU the "experience of a lifetime." The two have five more weeks in of
fice.
Levin said.
"Half of our responsibilit\ is
graduate students," Levin said.
"We're representing 7,500 gradu
ate students and about 0,400 un
dergraduates.
Both Levin and Mills agree that
their most "tangible and substan
tive" accomplishment is the Stan
ford Alter Midnight program.
Through this program they
"proved themselves to students."
Mills said.
Levin is especially proud that
Stanford After Midnight will be
around for a long time — even
after he and Mills have left Stan
ford. "After Midnight increases
the flexibility by which people
act," Levin said.
Another accomplishment in
which Mills in particular takes
pride is the re-organization of the
funding and structure of publica
tions within the ASS I .
A similar achievement was the
re-organization of the process ol
student group funding. Rather
than applying for money for an
entire quarter, student groups c an
now apply for funding for a spe
cific event."It is now much easier
and more convenient for student
groups to get funding," Mills said.
Other accomplishments Levin
and Mills cite are the redesign of

Polio Rev — now called I lie free
house. the initiating of post office
reform and the S;ifci\ 112 irst cam
paign. I he campus lighting initia
tive, too, lias improved the level.ol
safety on campus.

I rustees Robert Bass advocating
placing both an undergraduate
and a graduate student on the
presidential search committee as
one of the things ol which he is
most proud. Dual representation
is an issue to which I .cvin lias de
voted enormous attention.
Levin and Mills have also laid
the foundation not onl\ Ibr a new
student union, but also a new
10,000-sc]uare-fbot Last Campus
student c enter, which w ill be locat
ed between Wilbur and Stern.
Levin and Mills have earned a
reputation as tenacious lighters, a
c|iialit\ which served them well
throughout the hundreds of
hours the\ speni working to save
the Tovon fating ('.lubs.
Regrets
Despite their main successes,
Levin and Mills do wish that they
had focused their efforts on some
other ke\ issues.
"Something we should've done
better is worked on having siu
dent representatives on commit
tees chosen by the students
[through the Nominations Com
mittee],'' Mills said.

For Levin, his biggest regret is
that "I've made no headwav on
c hanging the wav the school looks
at Residential Kducaiion." lie
leels ili.it the I niversitv should
spend more nionev and clfort
working on inter'-department ad
vising and lapping into graduate
students as a resource fbi advis
ing.
On a larger scale, Levin and
Mills have been disappointed in
some ol the things tliev ve learned
about the I niversitv.
"I've been disappointed that
I've found people working here
that care more about their jobs
than students," Levin said. "II
that's the way they feel, tliev
shouldn't be working at a college.
I hev should want to make this a
