### ALICE BROWN EDITORIAL STAFF 
()vei Ihe past year, the ASSU lias been t heir lives.
I hev've spent ail average of 70 hours a week in the
ASM offices, attended hundreds of meetings, an
swered hundreds of calls and met hundreds ofpeo-
P le -
And in a little more than a month, it will all be
over. ASSU President Mike Levin and ASSU Vice
President |<>lin Mills have live more weeks in office.
I.ooking back at the past 12 months — and ahead
to the upcoming elections — Levin and Mills talk
lieely about all they've learned, the new perspective
on Stanford that 11 icy have gained and the insight
the) now have into what makes good ASSU leader
ship.
"There's not enough time to do everything you've
planned," said Levin. "What's important is the phi
losophy of leadership you bring into office. Your
principles. 1 he way you deal with people."
Mills echoed Levin's words. "The plan is impor
tant. l he approach is more important."
Accomplishments
Levin and Mills say they inherited much of their
underlying philosophy from their predecessors,
Maren Norton and Santos Maroquin. And much of
what they accomplished this year was made possible
l>\ the foundation Norton and Maroquin laid.
According to Levin and Mills, Norton and Maro
quin did an enormous amount to build trust and es
tablish a smoother relationship between students
and administrators.

Because <>l (his, 1 ,e\ in and Mills were able to con
centrate this year on gaining the belief and trust ol
the very students they were elected to represent.
Both leel that the\ have gained the support of the
student body. Levin feels that students either don't
know what the ASM does or have a positive impres
sion of the senate. "1 hardly get any hate mail any
more," he joked.
One way in which the ASSI has gained student
support is In making tangible contributions to im
proving student lift*.
Levin and Mills built their leadership strategy
around three main points: advocacy, initiatives and
programming. "We advocated on behalf of the stu
dents through initiatives and programming," Levin
said.
Both Levin and Mills see theii greatest accom
plishment as making a successful transition to the
new structure of the ASM — the separate graduate
and undergraduate senates. "I think it's turned out
amazingh well — bettei than anyone expected,"
Mills said.
Levin and Mills have spent ;i great deal of time
making sure graduate students receive equal repre
sentation, but Levin s.iid he let the (Iraduate Student
Council operate largely independently. I he lines of
communication remained open, however, and Levin
and Mills are proud of how smooth the transition to
separate senates has been.
"I think it's important that John be the most
knowledgeable graduate student on undergraduate
issues, just as it's important that I be one of the most
knowledgeable undergraduate on graduate issues,"

Levin and Mills call their year leading the ASSU the "experience of a lifetime." The two have five more weeks in of
