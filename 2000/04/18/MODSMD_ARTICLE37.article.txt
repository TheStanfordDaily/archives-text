### MELISSA LAMBERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Lac'h year, the ASSI L'ndergraduate Senate
welcomes new laces who must quickly become
familiar with the wide range ol issues the senate
debates.
1 his year, only three incumbent senators are
up Ibr re-election. I las this leadership turnover
made a difference in what Stanford student
government can accomplish?
Some senators believe the way the ASSI is
organized lessens the effect of the high
turnover rate. "We only had two returning sen
ators this year and it has been a verv successful

year,' said ASSL Senator Tom Liu.
Liu explained thai while over half of the cur
rent senate candidates are freshman, at least live
ol those nominees are ASSI senate associates.
Associates serve on an ASSI committee and
perform all the 112 unctions of senators, hut do not
vote. Hie position is open only to freshmen.
"It's not like other internship programs,"
said Liu, a sophomore. "Our senate associates
are really treated like equals."
Whatever the outcome ol this week's elec
tion, the next senate will he a young group.
While there are six seniors in the senate this
year, only one junior is currently running for
senator.
But many senators who are not graduating
are running for another ASSI position. 1 liree
of the four students running lor the ASSI pres
idency have served as senators.
Incumbent senators said their experience in
the senate will help them if they are re-elected.
Sophomore Serge Kassartljian said, "It took

awhile to learn the system in the ASSU, but next
year I will he able to make more of an impact be
cause now I know which administrators to talk
to, how to go about getting things clone and
what kind of ideas are realistic."
Junior Mike Levin, the current ASSU presi
dent. said that "by no means is prior ASSU ex
perience a prerequisite to getting involved,"
but added that the senate has worked hard to
improve the associate program and give stu
dents more experience before running for sen
ate.
Senate Associate Anna Otieno said the asso
ciates were treated no differently than senators,
wielding substantial influence over committee
decisions.
()tieno served on the Appropriations Com
mittee, helping to decide whether to fund
events of student groups on campus. While
she could not vote in senate meetings, she said
that "usually whatever the committee says,
goes."
