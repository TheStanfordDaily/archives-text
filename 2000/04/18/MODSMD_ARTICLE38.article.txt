### MEGAN KNIZE STAFF WRITER 
As of Monday, the I leurings (lommittee lias
approved three plea agreements as part of new
system of punishment developed lor elections
violations this year.
I he presidential slate for the ('.lass of 2003,
"The Mullet," agreed to a plea bargain lor a
"serious e-mail violation."
Senate Candidate Sunaina Sinha. a fresh
man, and Class of 2003 presidential slate
"We've Cot 4 On It" each agreed to plea bar
gains for minor Hyering violations.
Hearings ()flit er Katie Young, a junior, said
this is the first year the Hearings Committee
has used the plea bargaining system and the
demerit system. These changes were made in
the elections by-laws at the end of last year.
"I believe the new demerit system has great
ly increased the efficiency and fairness of elec
tions violation regulation," said Young, who is
in her second year as hearings officer.
She said the demerit system was created b\ a
committee of students, some of who were on
the ASSU last year, because there were things
the committee felt "could be improved with

campaign enforcement."
When a candidate or slate agrees to a plea
bargain, that person agrees to a certain number
of demerits which will appear next to their
name on the ballot. Kadi name will have ten
green ( ire les next to it, and the demerits will be
indicated In red circles.
I he committee believes the demerit svsteni
is more accessible to voters, because the num
ber ol demerits each candidate lias received ap
pears next to his name on the ballot.
Young said developing the demerit s\stcui
was "a collective effort," adding that she
"helped and a lot of current Senators helped."
Young s.iid she believed that "the svstem of
fines [Ibr campaign
violations) didn't punish people equally. be
cause certain people can jusi w rite a check but
for others it's more of a financial strain."
She said the committee agreed to the de
merit s\stem because "we needed something
that would make the punishment lii thecriine."

hearings process "frustrating" because they
knew they had done something wrong, and
"they were willing to take responsibility lor
what they did right away."

an alternative to those hearings.
Young said that when a candidate or slate
agrees to a plea bargain, they are not admitting
their guilt, but the\ are pleading "no contest" lo
the charge.
Young added the plea bargaining system is
"working very well, and it's definitely more ef
ficient."
She also leels that candidates appreciate
having an option when the) want to take re
sponsibilitv for a violation and avoid appearing
in front of the I learings (lommittee.
