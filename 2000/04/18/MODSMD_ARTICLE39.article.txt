# Past presidents faced a variety of challenges

### MELISSA LAMBERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Over the years, ASSI presi
dents have presented decided!)
different initiatives. From the
Marguerite to the Board of
Trustees, presidential priorities
run the range of student con
cerns.
I here have been four presi
dents since 1996; previously,
students elected councils of
presidents.
In 1996-1997, former ASSL
President Bill Shen crusaded
against the U.S. News & World
Report rankings and organized
a huge "get-out-the-vole" ef
fort.
But Shen exceeded his
$9,250 programming and dis
cretionary budget by nearly
$9,841, a 106 percent over
draft. Three thousand dollars
ol that excess went tor now-infa
mous custom-printed adhesive
notepads.
Levin said that Shen lodised
too much on outside problems,
neglecting issues that "affected
Stanford students because the\
attended Stanford."
Perhaps in reaction to the
previous year's financial extrav
agance, the next ASSI Presi
dent, Fniih Anchus, ran on "a
platform which criticized
[Shell's] administration for
being 'activist' and doing too
much," according to Levin.
"[She] offered a bare-bones,
minimalist alternative."
During Andrus' term as
president, the ASSL persuaded
the administration to release
teacher evaluations, which the
ASSL assembled in a guide.
The 1998-99 ASSL presi

dency of Maren Norton was
marked by the expansion of
Marguerite shuttle service and
the introduction of Midnight
Breakfast and the online course
guide.
Sophomore Serge Kassard
jian, and undergraduate sena
tor, said he believes that this
year's ASSL carried over and
enhanced Norton's initiatives.
In addition, according to
Levin, the ASSL now focuses
more on serving the entire cam
pus — not just undergraduates.
file Senate, formerly con
sisting of lf> graduate students
and 15 undergraduates, split
last spring into separate under
graduate and graduate groups.
1 his year, ASSL Vice Presi
dent John Mills became the first
graduate student to hold that
office (although before 1996,
graduate students served on
presidential councils).
Levin said that this year, the
ASSL is advocating that two
students — one undergraduate
and one graduate — join the
Board of Trustees.
"With all the changes in the
University," Levin said, "it
would be stupid for the ASSL
not toti ) for student represen
tation in the Board of Trustees
next year."
Levin said that President
(ierhard (lasper did not want to
add a student to the board be
cause he worries about stu
dents' abilitv to keep sensitive
information confidential.
Levin hopes that President
John Henness\ will be more
open to the idea.
Levin also began the After
Midnight program, which
keeps student facilities such as
l residder Fitness and the Cof
fee House open until 2 a.m.
