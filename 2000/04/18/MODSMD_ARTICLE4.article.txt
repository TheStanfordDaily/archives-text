### MARK BOUCHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The search for a new dean of the Medical
School is progressing satisfactorily despite ex
ceeding President Clerhard Casper's one-month
time frame, according to Provost John 1 fennessy,
head of the search committee. He expects the
committee will name the new dean before com
mencement in (line.
l he committee is now examining over 100 can

didates from inside and outside the University.
I fennessy said that approximately one-quarter of
these candidates came from within the University.
When President Casper formed the search
committee, he asked it to report a candidate with
in a month of its first meeting. A January letter
from 1 lennessy to Assoc . Prof, of Pediatrics Lorry
Frankel, chair of the Medical School Faculty Sen
ate, indicated the committee would announce its
choice by April 15.
The timeline "should not . .. cause us to sac ri

fice the validity of the search," llenness\ said in
the letter.
Yet I lennessy indicated that it will he up to six
weeks before anyone is named lor the position.
"It's a complicated position," he said. "The cal
iber of candidates is extremely high. [The com
mittee] is doing its work as fast as it can.
So far, the committee has talked to several
groups involved with the search. lis members
have met with the Medical School
faculty, the faculty of the Veteran's
Association Hospital, the chairs of
the basic science and clinical depart
ments and the executive committee
of the Medical School, among other
groups.
They then talked to colleagues at
different universities to solicit nomi
nations. After screening these nom
inees and checking the candidates'
references, they invited some candi
dates for initial visits to the Medical
School.
"We're doing our due diligence
on the candidates," said Tom Bur
don, associate professor of Cardio
thoracic Surgery and a member of
the search committee. "We're using
our contacts and resources [to
check] the characteristics of the indi
viduals on the list."
The committee is looking for a
dean with proven leadership ability
in both basic science and clinical de
partments. The committee's choice
should also demonstrate high moral
integrity and a strong record of
scholarship, said Hennessy.
Twelve people sit on the commit
tee, including Hennessy, two pro
lessors from the natural sciences,
eight professors from the Medical
School and a third-year medical stu
dent. Hennessy and Pathology De
partment Chair Steven Galli are the
committee co-chairs.
"I've been very impressed by the
professionalism of the committee,"
said Burdon. "They are very devot
ed and very loyal to Stanford."
C lasper's January decision to split
the Medical School leadership be
tween an administrative vice presi
dent and an academic dean necessi
tated the search. Former Medical
School Dean Eugene Bauer will as
sume the new position of vice presi
dent when the new dean is named.
I he vice president will oversee
strategic planning, financial affairs
and external relations, while the
dean will supervise the academic
program of the Medical School.
While the dean will primarily super
vise faculty appointments and the
medical curriculum, he will also be
involved with the clinical aspects of
the school, which include Stanford
I fospital, Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital and the University's main
specialized clinics.
Burclon said the new dean will
supervise "education, recruitment
and retention." 112 ie will work closely
with the vice president and the Uni
versity provost.
There will be "tremendous bud
getary overlap" between the clean
and the vice president, said Hen
nessy. " They will have to coordinate
extremely carefully on budgeting
and planning."
