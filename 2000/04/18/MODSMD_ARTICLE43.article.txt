th;ii Setli Newton and Malia Villegas
provide the stronger of the two plat
forms in this year's ASSU presidential election.
I hey combine an original vision tor the role of the
ASSI , while at the same time building on the
strengths of the frameworks left by their predeces
s< »rs.
Alter holding a three month-long series of dia
logues with different student groups on campus,
the\ created their IMatfbrm for Accountability and
Change (PAC). l itis platform thus reflects the con
cerns of students from across Stanford and aims to
instill ,i more participatory and social ethic in the
ASSI by adhering to a set of tour principles.
I hcse principles ate to increase (he power of siu
dents m decision-making at Stanford on an institu
tional level, to address issues of I niversity responsi-

bility that are systematically ignored, to actively pro
mote diversity of all kinds and provide a voice
against discrimination of all types an{l to emphasize
the need for increased accountability, transparency
and dialogue between the administration, ASSU
and students.
The PAC, while ambitious, is also realistic and
reflects a high level of maturity and thought. New
ton and Villegas' goals include attaining two student
positions on the Board of Trustees and laying the
groundwork for a new student union, which would
provide ample room for student groups and the
performing arts. They also plan to support and ini
tiate efforts to improve Stanford's commitment to
diversity by addressing issues such as Stanford's
tenure policies and community center funding and
to serve as a voice for students beyond Stanford by
developing working relationships with students ;it
other universities in the United States and abroad.
In addition, they want to continue building oil
existing programs to bring students together.

Newton and Villegas together have a solid foun
dation of experience that they can use to implement
their goals. Some of Newton's past roles include co
coordinator of Students for Environmental Action
at Stanford, co-coordinator for the Coalition for
Dignity, and Justice as well as being the co
coordinator of Stanford's first exhibit on art for
social change.
Villegas complements him with her experience
in the ASSU. She has served on the frosh council,
has been an ASSU undergraduate senator, has
chaired the ASSU appropriations committee and
has been a member of the special fees committee.
The two also plan to form a cabinet of six to 12
students from different student groups in older to
keep the pair and the ASSU in tune with the stu
dent body.
Though both slates have the experience neces
sary to be successful and both appear to be address
ing many of the same issues, Newton and Villegas
have the vision it takes to make truly innovative

leaders.
Even more importantly, Newton and Villegas
have taken the time to reach out to the student com
munities they would affect as ASSU president and
vice president, ensuring that they are in touch with
the issues facing these communities. It is from this
dialogue that Newton and Villegas have created
their platform, giving those communities that have
traditionally voiced feelings of marginalization by
the ASSU the chance to finally Ik* involved in the
organization's leadership.
This kind of community outreach and proactive
commitment to student voice are clear indications of
how Newton and Villegas have and will take the
ASSU to new heights. At a time when the student
body feels isolated from decision-making processes
at Stanford in general as well as isolated from the
ASSU, the Platform for Accountability and Change
is needed to make the ASSU accessible to the entire
Stanford community and take the organization to
the next level of student representation.
