and blaring sirens, as protesters
and police brayed the elements to
wage a soggy land war oyer inter-

As darkness fell on
the city, some (>()()
demonstrators sat in
custody, arrested
throughout the day for
crossing police lines. In-

World Bank representatives
wrapped tip their semi-annual
meetings on schedule and un
taxed, emerging to tout new
funds to combat AIDS in devel

Newspaper and television re

that deluged the city all morning.
Media attention shifted late
morning to a large group of
demonstrators reported to be
roaming the streets around
Pennsylvania Avenue.
By early afternoon, the rain
had slowed, and the heart of the
capital was left a drizzly ghost
