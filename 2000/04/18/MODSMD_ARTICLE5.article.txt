# WASHINGTON, D.C. SPECIAL REPORT
## Anti-IMF protests create furor in D.C. 
### JIM TANKERSLEY EDITORIAL STAFF 
WASHINGTON, DC.—
The nation's capital woke yester
day morning to pounding rain
and blaring sirens, as protesters
and police brayed the elements to
wage a soggy land war oyer inter-

national trade.
As darkness fell on
the city, some (>()()
demonstrators sat in
custody, arrested
throughout the day for
crossing police lines. In-

ternational Monetary Fund and
World Bank representatives
wrapped tip their semi-annual
meetings on schedule and un
taxed, emerging to tout new
funds to combat AIDS in devel
oping nations.
At times raucous, at times
deathly silent, the clay will un
doubtedly go down as one of
Washington's strangest in recent
memory.
For students at the Stanfbrcl
in-Washington House, it began
with air-raid-decibel sirens an
nouncing an early start to the
trade meetings. Fearing for the
salety of the representatives stav
ing at the Marriott Hotel just
across Connecticut Avenue from
the house in northwest W ashing
ton. police set up a high-volume,
c rac k-of-dawn shuttle service to
the IMF and World Bank build
ings downtown.
Scheduled to commence their
meetings at 9 a.m., IMF and
World Bank officials moved up
the start time to 7:.'10 a.m., a move

to keep the delegates from teach
ing the meetings downtown. The
plan worked.
Officers closed do/ens of
blocks to vehicle traffic; later in
the day, they would block off sev
eral more to pedestrians. City of
ficials issued a plea for all "non
emergency" government work-

ers to stay home, a
proclamation that gave
several Stanford stu
dents a day off their in
ternships in Congres
sional offices or govern
ment agencies.

Newspaper and television re
porters filing earlv stories from
around the city said several thou
sand fewer people than expected
had turned out to protest, proba
ble casualties of the downpour
that deluged the city all morning.
Media attention shifted late
morning to a large group of
demonstrators reported to be
roaming the streets around
Pennsylvania Avenue.
By early afternoon, the rain
had slowed, and the heart of the
capital was left a drizzly ghost
town. Officers in bright orange
overcoats directed the light
downtown traffic, and police ve
hicles outnumbered civilian cars
on several streets.
Onlv a few tourists or profes
sionals ventured into the area.
"Nobody's here today." a recep
tionist at a large office building on
k Street said. "We've had eight
people show up."
Perhaps most telling: On the
last day for Americans to mail
their income tax returns without penalty — a notorious
postal nightmare—the line at the closest post office to the
White I louse was less than five minutes long.
Around the corner from that post office, the steady
thump of drumsticks on tom-toms, buckets and empty
water jugs broke the mid-afternoon silence. As shop
owners watched from behind locked doors—or in a cou
ple cases, from the street, cigarettes in hand —a crowd
several hundred strong moved briskly down the street.
Decked in a rainlxm of parkas, waving wet canvas ban
ners, chanting, "I ley hey, ho ho, the IMF has got to go,"
the protesters wore weaiy smiles. Their signs charged the
trade Ixxlies with promoting environmental degradation
and ignoring the economic plight of poorer nations.
The mood was festive, not angry; one woman
pumped her right hand with the drum beat while strug
gling with her left to contain the black I ahrador Retriev
er walking next to her on a leash.
()ne young man ran up to a reporter and offered him
what appeared to be a credit card application. "1 lave you
signed up for your World Bank Card yet?" he asked. "All
the debt you want — free."
The small parade passed quickly, turning right a few
blocks down the street on its way to a rally in a nearby
square. An hour later, two parka-dacl young man and a
young woman in an M Street coffee shop recounted the
fate of protesters who struck a deal with police, allowing
them to pass though barricades on their march in ex
change for voluntary arrest.
"It was like the cops said, 'here's the deal: We'll let you
through the (fence) line, then arrest you,' " one of the
men said. "And they did it. It was crazy."
