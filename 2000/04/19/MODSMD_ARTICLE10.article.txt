I lie program is designed to
hold 70 sophomores and 100
freshmen, and ;ill dorm activities
are done on a voluntary basis,
without a formal commitment
In mi residents, 112 reshmen have the

option to stay a second year.
"Living here is pretty fun," said
fresh man John (iarfinkel. "There
are not a lot of activities to do and
you do not stay fixed, because
there are lots of places to see. I he
isolation is not too bad either."
Vice I'rovost for Undergradu
ate Fducation John Bravman,
head of the program, said, "I think

students have, in the main, been
pleased. We clearly made more of
an impact on frosh than on sopho
mores, and will work hard to ad
just that next year. Most students
have liked most of what we have
done, and many are very happy
with the program so far."
Many students mentioned that
the Dean Dinners, where the stu
dents meet with professors at
Bravman's house, were the most
appealing part of the program.
"As a sophomore, I found the
Dean Dinner most useful â€” espe
cially because 1 gol to meet profes
sors," said sophomore Michael
Ross. "But I probably got out
much more than the frosh.The ex
perience of sophomores and 112 resh
men are very different."
Andy Dimock, one of the col
lege directors, agreed. "The main
conception of FroSoCo was to
give students access to faculty," he
said. "Many seniors complain
they do not know a professor well
enough to obtain a letter of rec
ommendation. FroSoCo gives
students the opportunity to meet
professors, learn about their re
search and have a level of interac
tion they would not have oilier
wise."
Some students also pointed to
the good living conditions.
