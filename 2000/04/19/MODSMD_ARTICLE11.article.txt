# Scientists outline human chromosomes at center
## 
### ASTA SO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The completion of a draft of three human chro
mosome sequences, announced last week by Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson, brings Stanford into the
spotlight again. 'The Stanford Human Genome Cen
ter collaborated with the Joint Genome Institute in
Walnut Creek, Calif., to outline chromosomes 5, Hi
and 19. Their work is part of the Human Genome
Project, an international effort by scientists to acquire
a record of the entire human DNA sequence.
Genetics Prof. Richard Myers, co-director of the
Genome Center, anticipates the Center will have a
"rough draft" of the entire human genome by May or
June. He predicts they will have a complete draft
"within the next couple of three years."
Researchers at the Center expect great advance
ments in medicine once they successfully map the
human genome.
"The main [task of the Center] is to understand the
structure of the human genome and apply it to peo
ple's health and well-being," said David Cox, co-di
rector of the center and professor of genetics and pe
diatrics.
Cox and Mvers created the Center in 1990 at the
UCSF, moving it to Stanford in 1993. The Center is
located in the Medical School's Department of Genet
ics. Cox and Myers lead the two main branches of the
center, each of which has a different focus.
Myers and his group of about 25 researchers focus
on sequencing the human genome. While Cox stud
ies the more general composition of the genome,

Myers focuses oil the specific order of base pairs
along the length of DNA molecules."
Cox heads a group of .>() technicians, mostly col
lege graduates getting experience in research, in their
ongoing project to map the human genome.
Using an analogy to describe what he and the re
searchers do, Cox compared the bases of a DNA
strand to the pearls 011 a necklace.
"Sometimes, a bead will not have the same color be
tween two individuals' [pearl necklaces], (-ox said.
By looking at such variations among the beads,
or bases, in the DNA of'different individuals, Cox and
his fellow researchers can determine il certain forms
of medical treatment are better for individuals with
particular kinds of DNA. As Cox says, doctors can
"more effectively pair existing treatments to people"
if they are aware of their patients' genetic composi
tions.
I hree months ago, (lox and his fellow researchers
discovered ";i common variation that sin a particular
gene more associated with people of high blood pres
sure than [with people of] low blood pressure, (.ox
said.
lie said this new information will help identify
causes and treatments of heart disease.
Myers recentlv received a $l(>..'i million grant from
the Department of Knergy for the project, titled "Se
quence Finishing of the I luman Cenome.
The grant will begin 011 May 1.
Jane Crimwood, a senior scientist at the center,
said studying the gene sequence is important because
"il we know the genetic codes, it gives us lots of av
enues for treatment and diagnosis of diseases."
