## China asks U.S. to stop arms sales 
### 
BFIJINC (AP) — China called
on the United States to end all arms
sales to the rival Taiwanese govern
ment yesterday, a day alter Wash
ington went part of the way in meet
ing China's demands by deciding
not to sell Taiwan advanced Aegis
destroyers.
Word that President Clinton will
tbrgo the Aegis sale disappointed
Taiwanese leaders, but it brought
hope lor a cooling of tensions with
China. In Washington, it sparked
worries of a light with Congress
over support lor the island.
In Beijing, which has been trying
to isolate Taiwan to pressure it into
unifying with the mainland alter 51
years of separation, Clinton's move
was seen as insufficient.
While denying Taiwan the Aegis
equipped warships, U.S. officials
said they would sell the island long
range radar to detect missile
launches as well as provide training
and technical help.
" The Chinese government urges
the U.S. government... to stop all
arms sales to Taiwan, including the
long-range warning radar and
Aegis, so as not to obstruct the
improvement of China-U.S. rela
tions," Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sun Yuxi told reporters
at a briefing yesterday.
Sun reminded Washington to
abide by an 18-year-old agreement
on limiting arms sales to Taiwan.
1 le said Beijing had "taken note" of
reports on Washington's decision
on Aegis.
Washington's decision to with
hold Aegis marked the first of two
successes for Chinese diplomatic
pressure this week. Rallying devel
oping nations, Beijing also pre
vailed yesterday in blocking the
U.N. Human Rights Commission in
Geneva from discussing a U.S.
motion to censure (Ihina for human
rights abuses.
As part of its pressure campaign
against Taiwan, Beijing in recent
months has stepped up threats to
attack the island if it moved toward
outright independence.
Chinese officials also have
accused Washington of embolden
ing separatist sentiment through
arms sales — an argument Sun
repeated.
Hie destroyers had come in for
particular criticism. At one point, a
senior Chinese official indirectly
hinted that China might attack the
warships if the United States sold
them to Taiwan.
The Arleigh Burke-class destroy
ers are equipped with the Aegis sys
tem, which includes an advanced
radar, the SPY-1, able to search for,
track and engage more than 100
targets simultaneously. The ships
also come with Tomahawk cruise
missiles like those used against Iraq
and Yugoslavia.
China fears the system would
undercut the tactical edge drawn
from its rapidly growing arsenal of
missiles.
In reviewing Taiwan's annual
arms shopping list, the Pentagon
recommended that the administra
tion put off Taiwan's request to buy
four of the billion-dollar apiece
destroyers, as well as submarines
and anti-submarine aircraft, to
avoid angering China.
In Taiwan, Washington's reluc
tance to sell the warships was seen as
a possible lift to strained relations
between China and the island.
Vocal Taiwan backers in
Congress, where support for the
island runs deep, criticized the Clin
ton administration for compromis
ing Taiwan's defense.
A spokesman for Sen. Jesse
I lelms, the conservative North Car
olina Republican who heads the
Senate Foreign Relations Commit
tee, suggested yesterday that the
administration may have violated a
U.S. law requiring Washington help
Taiwan maintain an adequate
defense.
