HARARK, Zimbabwe (AP)
Zimbabwe's president vilified
white farmers as "enemies of our
people" yesterday, hours after
dozens of gunmen besieged a
farm and killed a white rancher
during the worst spasm of vio
lence during the two months of
land occupations.
On the country's 20th anniver
sary of independence from white
rule, Mugabe accused the farmers
of "mobilizing, actually coercing"
workers against his rule and want
ing to return to the colonial era.
Yesterday's violence on several
farms and Mugabe's stepped-up
rhetoric escalated the standoff that
began in February when landless
blacks started occupying white
owned land. Squatters now occu
py more than 000 farms.
Mugabe has backed the squat

ters, saying they are veterans of
Zimbabwe's independence war
protesting against inequitable
land distribution in a countn
where 4,000 white farmers own a
third of the productive farmland.
But many of the squatters, who
have begun wearing ruling part)
T-shirts in recent days, are far too
young to have fought in the war.
Opposition politicians sa\ the
occupations are an effort l)\
Mugabe to scare white fanners
and their workers into abandon
ing the opposition Movement for
Democratic Change, which could
pose a major challenge to
Mugabe's 20-year rule in parlia
mentary elections expected to be
called next month.
"Violence and intimidation are
being orchestrated by Mugabe
and his party hierarchy," said

David Coltart. ;i partv official.
"They are going for the MDC
support base" in rural areas.
Farly yesterdav, -10 to 100
attackers armed with AK-47
assault lilies drove onto a farm in
western Zimbabwe and besieged
the home of cattle rancher Martin
Olds. The 42-year-old rancher
was killed in a three-hour gunhat
tle, Coltart said. The attackers
then burned down his house.
Olds' death was the fourth
killing linked to political violence
since Saturday, when two MDC
members were killed in a fire
bombing and farmer David
Stevens, a known MDC support
er, was slain by ruling party sup
porters. Five of Stevens' neighbors
were also severely beaten.
Also yesterday, attackers weal
ing ruling party T-shirts ram

paged across a white-owned limn
25 mill's north ol Harare, torch
ing tobacco barns and workers'
dwellings. Thc\ also Hashed and
looted the hilltop lai nihouse of
I)a\ iil Stobart and his wile,
(iillian, who lied to the capital.
Neighbors ol ()lds and Stohart
were evacuating to nearb\ towns,
said the Commercial Farmers
I nion, which represents most of
the white farmers.
Ihe president accused white
farmers of working to defeat a
failed constitutional rclerenduin
that aimed to speed up the sei/ure
of white litrtns lor distribution to
landless blacks. lie s;iid white
opposition "exposed them as our
enemies, not just political ene
mies, but definite enemies in
wanting to reverse out revolution
and our independence.
