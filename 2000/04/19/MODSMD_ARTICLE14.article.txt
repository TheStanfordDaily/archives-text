## 
### 
MOM PKUER, Vt. (AP) — A
bill that would create the closest
thing in America to gay marriage
won preliminary approval in the
state* Senate yesterday after a
dehate watched by people wear
ing either white ribbons or pink
stickers to show where they stood.
The 19-11 vote came after the
Senate defeated two proposed
constitutional amendments
designed to outlaw same-sex mar
riage. 1 lie bill will be up for final
approval in the Senate today.
A similar measure has already
passed the House, but that cham
ber will have to consider changes
made by the Senate. Democratic
(iov. Howard Dean has said he
will sign the bill.
I lie measure would enable gay
c ouples to form "civil unions" that
would entitle them to all 300 or so
rights and benefits available under
state law to married couples.
No other state has gone as far
as Vermont to give gay couples
something approximating mar
riage.
However, Vermont's gay cou
ples would still not be entitled to
the federal benefits available to
married couples in such areas as
taxes and Social Security.
And, unlike marriage, civil
unions would not confer portable
rights; other states would proba
blv not recognize such unions.
Hie state Supreme Court set
the stage for the legislation with
its unanimous December ruling
that same-sex couples were being
unconstitutionally denied the
benefits of marriage.
I lie legislation would create a
status parallel to marriage by
allowing gay and lesbian couples
to obtain a license from their
town clerks. They would then
have their unions certified by a
judge or member of the clergy.
Same-sex couples then would
qualifx for the wide array of ben
efits available to married couples
such as being able to make med
ical decisions on behalf of their
partners to qualifving for certain
tax breaks.
