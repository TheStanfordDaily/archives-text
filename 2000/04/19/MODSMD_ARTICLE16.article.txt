# U.S. approves first new type of antibiotic in 35 years

### 
(AP) — Doctors are getting an
important new weapon in the
growing battle against drug-resis
tant infections: The government
approved a long-awaited drug
called Zyvox yesterday, described
as the world's first entirely new type
of antibiotic in 35 years.
Zyvox seems to cure some infec
tions impervious to all other antibi
otics, even that longtime drug of
last resort called vancomycin. Con
sequently, Zyvox could help pre
vent hundreds, perhaps even thou
sands, of life-threatening infections
even year.

"It comes at a time when we
were literally running out of antibi
otics," said Dr. Robert CI. Moeller
ing Jr., physician-in-chief of
Boston's Beth Israel-Deaconness
I lospital.
Plus, it is being made in both
oral and intravenous forms —
meaning when hospitals discharge
infected patients, they might go
home with pills instead of a trou
blesome IV unit, said Dr. Dennis L.
Stevens of the Veterans Affairs
Medical Center in Boise, Idaho.
"Zyvox is just a superb drug,"
said Stevens, who helped test it.

"It's good .... to treat some pret
ty nasty infections with an oral
drug."
But he stressed that doctors
should reserve Zyvox for only the
worst infections and those suspect
ed of being antibiotic-resistant, or
bacteria will <|iiickl\ evolve to make
Zyvox useless.
"It's my wish that Zyvox is used
primarilv in hospitals," not when
primal} care physicians just hand
out a routine antibiotic prescrip
tion, he said.

medicine — a true surprise attack.
It slops bacteria from making pro

growth so the body's immune sys

Moellering said.
