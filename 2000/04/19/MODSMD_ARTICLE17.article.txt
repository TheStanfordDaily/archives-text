## The 						Stanford Daily Get out and vote in today's ASSU election 
### 
Published Since 1891

Lei's be honest here. Even with all
the talk about voting in this
week's ASSU eleetion, you still
have a lot of reasons not to vote.
Maybe you're cynical about the ASSU,
tired ol electing representatives who
promise to change the way student gov
ernment runs — to make it work for you
— and then watching as the new year
progresses and nothing seems to change.
You're sick of senators who don't show up
for meetings and of meetings that don't
seem to accomplish anything.
Perhaps you're weary ol the election
process, of posters and slogans and of

"meet the candidate" forums and presi
dential debates that don't attract enough
spectators.
Most likely you're busy, maybe even too
busy to take a l()-minute break from e
inail, lire up a Web browser and vote. It's
spring quarter, and the week is sunny,
and you have better things to be doing
with your time than bothering with an
institution that never seems to affect you.
This is why you should bother.
You should vote because over 30 spe
cial-fee groups are asking for your money
this year, more than a million dollars
worth, and you should take care to

ensure that your funds are spent wisely.
You should vote because the ASSU
Senate does important, but often not-so
glamorous, work that affects you directly.
It appropriates funds to student groups,
nominates students to University commit
tees and lobbies the University on student
issues. You should take care in electing
representatives who can handle these
responsibilities.
You should vote because two presiden
tial slates are running and the one that's
elected will be a representative of "stu
dent voice." But how can any slate repre
sent your voice if you don't take the time

to look at the issues at hand and make
your voice heard at the start — in the
election? You should take care to choose a
slate that best addresses what matters
most to you at this University.
Most of all, you should vote because by
doing so, you show the University that
you care. In a time when students are
calling for more say in the tenuring pro
cess and a permanent seat on the Board
of Trustees, it is easy for administrators to
write off students who don't even bother
to turn out for their own elections.
Empower yourself, lake the time to
vote today or tomorrow.
