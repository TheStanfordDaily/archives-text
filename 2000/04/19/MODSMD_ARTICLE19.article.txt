Error in Daily commentary
on Electrolytes
I would like to call into question I lie
Daily's special Ice endorsements. I lie edi
torial board claims to have spent the last
two weeks researching cvei y group that is
requesting special lees. II this is true,
maybe the\ should have spent several
months, because they obvioush did not
do a good job.
I hey write that Electrolytes has "no
offic i.il <)Hi<eis yet." Anyc>ne even vagucl)
familial with the ASM and ()SA's proce
dures knows that a school group must
have ollicers to be oHit ialh recogni/ed.
II the editorial board can make sikh a
basic mistake about Electrolytes, bow well
do the\ realh know the group? I low well
do tliev know an\ school group or candi
date? Keep these questions in mind when
you log on to vole during this year's
ASM elections.

SEAS responds to Daily endorsements
While l lie Dail\'s description oI'SKAS,
Students lor Environmental Action at
Stanford, was mostly accurate, your state
ment that SKAS does not "teach out to
the campus mainstream" is misleading.
SKAS makes every cllbrt to involve as
broad a base of students as possible and is
especially focused on building connec
tions with other campus groups.

l-oi example, last fall, we worked close
l\ with MEdliA .ind SEAC. in the Cloali
lion for Eaboi l)ignit\ and Justice, help
ing to put on Worker Appreciation Week
and other programs — all of which
focused 011 connec ting with every individ
ual student.
Rigln now, we are co-sponsoring Earth
Week, a week-loug celebration including
a major speaker Tuesday night, a festival
Wednesday in White I Ma/a and movie
s( 1 ceilings, all <>pcn and publici/.ed to the
entire campus. Ne\i week we are bring
ing Winona KaDuke, Native American
a<ii\isi and (iieeti I'artv vice-presidential
candidate, to speak on campus, with the
help of the Stanford American Indian
Organization (SAIO) and llerstory. And
we do .ill this with one of the lowest spe
c i.il fee requests ol any group.
II The Daily — or anyone else — has
•in\ suggestions as to how we might reach
out to even more students, we would def
initely appreciate them. I lovvever, we leel
that we have made and continue to make
considerable eflorts in that area.

"Satisfaction Guaranteed"
responds to "BonaFide"
Recently, the "BonaFide" class presi
dent slate began a negative ad campaign
against "Satisfaction Guaranteed" and
our proposed budget for the senior ( lass,
while still refusing to offer a budget of
their own.
They claim this is an attempt to "limit
the effects of misinformation on this
years' ASSU elections." They claim our
figures are incorrect, and the budget is
inadequate. While we appreciate their
good intentions, we'd like to take this
opportunity to set the record straight. In
short, here's why their attacks are wrong:
1) Weekly Pub Nights. The attacks
claim that it costs $3,50 to hire the Mar
guerite per Senior Pub Night, and, as a
result, our budget could only fund two
Pub Nights per quarter. On the contrary,
working from the budget Mike Kass and
Brandon Maughan used this year as
junior class presidents, we know that ade
quate transportation service with the
Marguerite can be scheduled for only
$120. This provides enough money for
six to seven pub nights per quarter — one
each week, when we do not have other
events (formal, tailgate, etc).
2) Class I rip to Tahoe / Reno. Accord
ing to BonaFide, given our budget, "even
if only half of the ( lass came, there would

only be a $1.25 subsidy per person." Our
plans are to organize group packages
with huge discounts. We've already
looked into group discounts in the way of
casino hotel stays and lift tickets. On lift
tickets alone, we can easily save the class
between 15 and 30 percent. We currently
have estimates being processed at Cae
sar's Tahoe, Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe,
Harrah's, and Harveys Resort Hotel 8c
Casino — four of the largest hotel/casi
nos in the Lake Tahoe area. We are
awaiting (alls from their sales managers
with their offers for group rates and on
which dates they would have enough
availability to support us. The $ 1,000 we
budgeted was never intended as a sub
sidy. Rather, we plan to use it to organize
a class dinner or series of happy hours
over the course of the weekend.
3) Spring Formal. We budgeted
$14,000 for this event. Can we spend
more money than this? Certainly. How?
Well, that all relates to the next item . . .
4) Ticket sales. The attacks claim that
the Satisfaction Guaranteed's budget
depends too much on revenues from tick
et sales. We planned to charge between
$15 and $20 for the Fall Senior Formal
and $25 for the Spring Senior Formal.
BonaFide says this is excessive. Keep in
mind, tickets to this year's Spring Senior
Formal will run $40 to $50, and, accord
ing to the organizers of this year's Spring
Senior Formal, nearly the entire cost of
the event will be paid for by ticket sales.
Should we find, next year, that $25
doesn't cover all of the elements we're
looking for in such an event, we will work,

with heavy input from the Class of 2001,
to find a ticket price that meets our needs
and works with student budgets.
We appreciate BonaFide's challenges
to the Satisfaction Guaranteed budget —
after all, it gives us this opportunity to
support our research. However, we
believe it is hypocritical and improper for
them to attack our budget while refusing
to release one of their own.
Instead of taking the time and effort to
do so, they prefer to make lofty claims
about "raising money through estab
lished connections" and the benefits of
working with the Alumni Association, the
Off ice of Student Activities (OSA) and the
Office of Development.
As for these "established connections,"
who are they, and what can they provide?
L)o the candidates plan to pay for these
events by themselves? If we're talking
about corporate sponsorships, it should
be known that Mike Kass and Brandon
Maughan worked with a number of com
panies this year, including Silicon Graph
ics, to look into the feasibility of corporate
sponsorship. It is by no means an easy
thing to secure, given strict University
guidelines on external fundraising.
To quote the OSA's Guidelines for
External Fundraising by Student ()rgani
zations, "Registered Voluntary Student
Organizations (VSO's) are eligible to seek
approval for external fundraising.
Activities are expected to be education
al ones which complement the academic
mission of the University. Such activities
may include those that provide or aug
ment a service to students, or offer stu
dents chances to learn leadership and
organizational skills."
In order to secure outside funding,
BonaHde would have to make the Spring
Senior Formal an educational experi
ence. Perhaps it's a good thing they don't
plan on charging much for tickets.
In terms of working with the Alumni
Association, the Office of Student Activi
ties and the Office of Development, as
junior class presidents, Mike Kass and
Brandon Maughan worked closely with
these three organizations.
We have close contacts at each — Vic
tor Madrigal in the Alumni Association,
Nanci Howe in the OSA and Suzanne
Mendoza in the Stanford Fund Office of
Development — and plan to continue to
work with these individuals next year, if
granted the opportunity.
Again, we think it is unfortunate that
BonaFide has elected to lower the level of
their campaign to baseless attacks and the
mispresentation of facts. We think it is
unfortunate that they are unwilling to
take the time necessary to research and
draft a budget of their own. Satisfaction
Guaranteed stands by its budget and is
committed to representing the best inter
ests of the (Mass of 2001. Hold us to this.
We will deliver.

Daily endorsements biased
In its annual tradition, The Daily edi
torial board has decided to help the Stan
ford campus make an "informed" deci
sion about the upcoming ASSU election
through Special Fee Endorsements.
Unfortunately, these endorsements need
to be taken at face value because, at their
core, they are biased.
Consider the following scenario: The
Daily gives MEChA a two (out of five) as
their endorsement. Suddenly, the entire
Latino community is angry at The Daily
and, consequently, The Daily is seen as
bigoted or even racist. I'm not saying that
MEChA deserves a two out of five (in fact,
The Daily gave it a four this year, which it
most likely deserves).
The endorsements speak for them
selves: every group associated with a
minority, women, or community service
was not given a recommendation lower
than a four.
Groups that are easy targets such as
SCBN, The Mind's Eye and the Stanford
Jazz Orchestra can be given (and are
given) lower recommendations because it
doesn't hurt The Daily to give these
groups a negative endorsement. They
might anger a few students in those
groups, but they won't take any heat from
vocal minority groups. Very few groups
not affiliated with minorities or commu
nity service received a recommendation
above a three.
Would the Stanford community take
The Daily endorsements seriously if they
gave every group a four or five (even if
every group deserved to be highly rec
ommended)? No, so they give the groups
that are less controversial targets lower
scores and demand more from these
groups.
In our politically correct Stanford bub
ble, I he Daily special fee endorsements
are biased and there is no way to fix this
problem. Since The Daily can't truly give
an informed and unbiased opinion on
special fees, they should stop their annu
al endorsement charade.

The Daily needs to cover
GSC elections, too
I applaud The Daily for its Elections
2000 supplement in yesterday's paper.
However, I was disappointed at the
almost complete lack of coverage of the
Graduate Student Council elections.
If The Daily is to run comprehensive
elections coverage, something approach
ing equal space should be devoted to cov
ering graduate student elections and
issues as is devoted to undergraduate
elections and issues.
Granted, candidates for the GSC may
not run high-profile campaigns and
poster every blank space on campus the
way other candidates do. Grad students
do comprise half the total student popu
lation at Stanford, though, and, given
that, it would be a mistake for The Daily
to ignore this year's GSC elections.

The Daily ignores Queer Awareness Days
l'lease add Stanford's Queer Aware
ness Days to the list of minority commu
nity events which have received insuffi
cient coverage in The Daily. Over the past
two weeks, we organized five events
which, together, drew more than 500
people. We discussed the impact of the
Internet on gay lives, we laughed with
nationally known comedian Kate Clinton,
we examined the institution of gay mar
riage from a queer feminist perspective,
we watched a documentary made by a
Stanford graduate about gay Lutherans
who would like to preach and we heard
from Elizabeth Birch, the executive direc
tor of the Human Rights campaign, the
largest national gay and lesbian political
organization.
Not one of these events was deemed
important or interesting enough for cov
erage in The Daily. This complete lack of
interest, especially given The Daily's
recent history of ignoring such events (see
the letter "Insufficient coverage of Cesar
Chavez Commemoration in The Daily ")
is both worrying and offensive. It raises
the question of just who The Daily is for?
At the bottom left of each edition, you
write that The Daily has "been serving the
Stanford community continuously since
1891." Are you sure tHat shouldn't be
changed to "serving some of the Stanford
community continuously since 1891"?

ASSU leaders encourage voters
This year's ASSU campaign season has
been filled with the usual (laziness, as
well as a little added controversy. Hut, in
all of this fanfare, we sincerly hope that
you keep in mind the complexity of the
ASSU and the importance of these elec
tions. Your vote will determine the future
of ASSU leadership, representation and
resources.
The Elections Commission has worked
extremely hard to provide opportunities
for candidates to run meaningful cam
paigns, but the rest is up to you. You can
choose to be swayed by flashy posters and
emotion-filled rumors. Or you can choose
to invest a little bit of thought and
research in order to make a wise vote.
This year, we are very fortunate to
have two strong slates for the ASSU pi es

idency, along with the numerous (lass
president, senate and GSC candidates
and special lee groups.
Please do not allow yourself to cast a
thoughtless, minimally-informed vote.
Instead, please sit down, read through
the Election Handbook at http://elec
tion.stanford.edu and carefully consider
what you hope tor the future of your stu
dent government and your University
when you cast your vote.

Women's rugby team members
clarify election incident
Yesterday, a "concerned student" and
apparent member of the Stanford
women's rugby team wrote an e-mail
statement regarding the alleged misrep
resentation ol die women's rugby team in
the campaign of one of the ASSL under
graduate senate candidates, Alana Aldag.
Unfortunately, since the original letter
was written, the e-mail has been lot ward
ed with several comments to one dorm
list and from that list forwarded In anoth
er person (not a member of the rugbx
team) tor several lists across campus.
I'he final e-mail, which was sent to
these lists, was, in fact, not sent by a mem
ber of the women's rugby team and sev
eral comments were added to the effect
that one should not vote for Alana due to
her alleged misrepresentation. 1 his creat
ed a scathing e-mail debate that lias hurl
both Alana and the original person who
forwarded the e-mail to her dorm list.
E-mail is a completely inappropriate
and.in fact, illegal place in which to dis
cuss and debate ASSL) campaign issues
and candidates.
Unfortunately, for Alana Aldag and
the women's rugby team, miscommunica
tion and misjudgment on both sides (and
the phenomenon of e-mail) has blown
this thing out of proportion. Alana was
certainly part of the women's rugby team
at one point. She has since left the team,
but remains supportive of women's
rugby.
Thus, Alana's use of the team in her
campaign is of debatable validity. I lowev
er, without addressing the ethics of polit
ical campaigns and misrepresentation, we
fully regret that this issue ever turned into
campaign slander. We wish Alalia Aldag
the best of luck in her campaign lor ASSI
senate.

Senior Gift Committee tactics at issue
Melora Krebs-Carter's response to
McCown's and Salberg's letter regarding
the Senior Gift Committee completely
misses the point. She totally ignores the
real issue of McCown's and Salberg's let
ter, which was the unnecessary and rude
tactics the Senior Gift Committee uses to
pester our classmates.
1 don't know where the Senior Gili
Committee learned that relentless!)
accosting people yields greatest results; in
reality it only embitters people. Contran
to what Krebs-Carter attests, she and
other members of the committee are not
"reconnecting" with their beloved masses
of senior classmates, they are alienating
and annoying others with abrasive tac tic s
(a bullhorn in White Plaza comes to
mind) and the phone barrage.
How DARE Krebs-Carter sav that she
and her fellow Senior Gift Committee
members are calling "to reconnect." We
all know why they're calling —
and most ol us are happy and willing to
give Senior (Jilts. Willingness to give, con
trary to assertions in Krebs-Cbarter's letter,
is not the point of contention.
Many of us have treasured our Stan
ford experience, support the goals ol the
Stanford Fund and appreciate the aim of
the Senior Gift Committee. We are, how
ever, disgusted by the ladies used. When
one's true motives are couched behind
saccharine superficiality, it only makes
people less willing to donate. I his is best
exemplified bv Krebs-Carter - 's insulting
fallacy that if you have received a greater
number of calls it is only because that
many more people want to reconnect
with you. Please.
Many of us have personalty fell the
impact of The Stanford Fund in a varietv
of ways, and for this we are grateful.
However, many of us have also been
affected by the Senior Gift Committee's
superficial and relentless coercion. Mem
bers of ilie Senior (>ilt (Committee, please
rethink your strategies and know that vou
will likely have greater success reconnec t
ing with people bv demonstrating sincer
ity and respect — both sadly lacking in
the current campaign.

I'lie Rani's Head production of "Pip

It was as dose lo a professional show as

the S7T» ticket cost for "Fosse" in San

"Pippin," a wacky look at Everyman's

But the students' singing, dancing, acting,

Plunkett, not Elway, for president
I am writing in response to Tom Jack
son's preposterous suggestion that John
Elway be named the 10th president of
Stanford University. Facetious though it
may have been, I'm appalled. Frankly, it's
columns like Mr. Jackson's that popular
ize the stereotype of Stanford students as
apathetic , listless and ignorant.
Does Mr. Jackson really think that
John Flway as president would be in the
best interests of the student body? Does
he really think that John Flway would be
able to effectively run this school on a
day-to-day basis? Does he really think
|olm Flway is a more viable candidate
than the choice of conventional wisdom,
Jim Plunkett?
Flway had an illustrious Stanford
career, but how many Rose Bowls did he
win? Not a one, while Plunkett led the
Indians to their first Rose Bowl in 19
years, an upset of heavily-favored Ohio
State, 112 lway, I need not point out, never
led the (lard to a bowl game, nor did he
ever win a Heisman trophy or an NFL
Rookie o! the Year — Plunkett did. Plun
kett also won two Super Bowls, and he
didn't need five tries or Terrell Davis.
Sure, Mr. Jackson is right on the ball
when he says that arm strength and the
ability to read defenses are important
characteristics for our next president to
have, and Flway may hold the advantage
over Plunkett in pine talent. But Flway
was non-existent in the big games until of
I I) showed up in Colorado — just com
pare Flwav's ■}-(> combined Big Game /
Super Bowl Record with Plunkett's 4-2.
And what about decision making off the
field? Need Mr. Jackson be reminded of
Flwav's disastrous Coots Light commer
cials?
All I've got to sav is that if we're going
up against an overmatched Atlanta Fal
cons team over an overrated Packers
team, bv all means, Flway is our man. But
we need a I niversitv president who will
come up big in the clutch, and, to that
end, neither John Hennessey nor John
F.lwa\ can match |im Plunkett.
