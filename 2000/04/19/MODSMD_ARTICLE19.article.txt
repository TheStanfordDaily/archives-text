Error in Daily commentary
on Electrolytes
I would like to call into question I lie
Daily's special Ice endorsements. I lie edi
torial board claims to have spent the last
two weeks researching cvei y group that is
requesting special lees. II this is true,
maybe the\ should have spent several
months, because they obvioush did not
do a good job.
I hey write that Electrolytes has "no
offic i.il <)Hi<eis yet." Anyc>ne even vagucl)
familial with the ASM and ()SA's proce
dures knows that a school group must
have ollicers to be oHit ialh recogni/ed.
II the editorial board can make sikh a
basic mistake about Electrolytes, bow well
do the\ realh know the group? I low well
do tliev know an\ school group or candi
date? Keep these questions in mind when
you log on to vole during this year's
ASM elections.

SEAS responds to Daily endorsements
While l lie Dail\'s description oI'SKAS,
Students lor Environmental Action at
Stanford, was mostly accurate, your state
ment that SKAS does not "teach out to
the campus mainstream" is misleading.
SKAS makes every cllbrt to involve as
broad a base of students as possible and is
especially focused on building connec
tions with other campus groups.

l-oi example, last fall, we worked close
l\ with MEdliA .ind SEAC. in the Cloali
lion for Eaboi l)ignit\ and Justice, help
ing to put on Worker Appreciation Week
and other programs — all of which
focused 011 connec ting with every individ
ual student.
Rigln now, we are co-sponsoring Earth
Week, a week-loug celebration including
a major speaker Tuesday night, a festival
Wednesday in White I Ma/a and movie
s( 1 ceilings, all <>pcn and publici/.ed to the
entire campus. Ne\i week we are bring
ing Winona KaDuke, Native American
a<ii\isi and (iieeti I'artv vice-presidential
candidate, to speak on campus, with the
help of the Stanford American Indian
Organization (SAIO) and llerstory. And
we do .ill this with one of the lowest spe
c i.il fee requests ol any group.
II The Daily — or anyone else — has
•in\ suggestions as to how we might reach
out to even more students, we would def
initely appreciate them. I lovvever, we leel
that we have made and continue to make
considerable eflorts in that area.

"Satisfaction Guaranteed"
responds to "BonaFide"
Recently, the "BonaFide" class presi
dent slate began a negative ad campaign
against "Satisfaction Guaranteed" and
our proposed budget for the senior ( lass,
while still refusing to offer a budget of
their own.
They claim this is an attempt to "limit
the effects of misinformation on this
years' ASSU elections." They claim our
figures are incorrect, and the budget is
inadequate. While we appreciate their
good intentions, we'd like to take this
opportunity to set the record straight. In
short, here's why their attacks are wrong:
1) Weekly Pub Nights. The attacks
claim that it costs $3,50 to hire the Mar
guerite per Senior Pub Night, and, as a
result, our budget could only fund two
Pub Nights per quarter. On the contrary,
working from the budget Mike Kass and
Brandon Maughan used this year as
junior class presidents, we know that ade
quate transportation service with the
Marguerite can be scheduled for only
$120. This provides enough money for
six to seven pub nights per quarter — one
each week, when we do not have other
events (formal, tailgate, etc).
2) Class I rip to Tahoe / Reno. Accord
ing to BonaFide, given our budget, "even
if only half of the ( lass came, there would

only be a $1.25 subsidy per person." Our
plans are to organize group packages
with huge discounts. We've already
looked into group discounts in the way of
casino hotel stays and lift tickets. On lift
tickets alone, we can easily save the class
between 15 and 30 percent. We currently
have estimates being processed at Cae
sar's Tahoe, Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe,
Harrah's, and Harveys Resort Hotel 8c
Casino — four of the largest hotel/casi
nos in the Lake Tahoe area. We are
awaiting (alls from their sales managers
with their offers for group rates and on
which dates they would have enough
availability to support us. The $ 1,000 we
budgeted was never intended as a sub
sidy. Rather, we plan to use it to organize
a class dinner or series of happy hours
over the course of the weekend.
3) Spring Formal. We budgeted
$14,000 for this event. Can we spend
more money than this? Certainly. How?
Well, that all relates to the next item . . .
4) Ticket sales. The attacks claim that
the Satisfaction Guaranteed's budget
depends too much on revenues from tick
et sales. We planned to charge between
$15 and $20 for the Fall Senior Formal
and $25 for the Spring Senior Formal.
BonaFide says this is excessive. Keep in
mind, tickets to this year's Spring Senior
Formal will run $40 to $50, and, accord
ing to the organizers of this year's Spring
Senior Formal, nearly the entire cost of
the event will be paid for by ticket sales.
Should we find, next year, that $25
doesn't cover all of the elements we're
looking for in such an event, we will work,

with heavy input from the Class of 2001,
to find a ticket price that meets our needs
and works with student budgets.
We appreciate BonaFide's challenges
to the Satisfaction Guaranteed budget —
after all, it gives us this opportunity to
support our research. However, we
believe it is hypocritical and improper for
them to attack our budget while refusing
to release one of their own.
Instead of taking the time and effort to
do so, they prefer to make lofty claims
about "raising money through estab
lished connections" and the benefits of
working with the Alumni Association, the
Off ice of Student Activities (OSA) and the
Office of Development.
As for these "established connections,"
who are they, and what can they provide?
L)o the candidates plan to pay for these
events by themselves? If we're talking
about corporate sponsorships, it should
be known that Mike Kass and Brandon
Maughan worked with a number of com
panies this year, including Silicon Graph
ics, to look into the feasibility of corporate
sponsorship. It is by no means an easy
thing to secure, given strict University
guidelines on external fundraising.
To quote the OSA's Guidelines for
External Fundraising by Student ()rgani
zations, "Registered Voluntary Student
Organizations (VSO's) are eligible to seek
approval for external fundraising.
Activities are expected to be education
al ones which complement the academic
mission of the University. Such activities
may include those that provide or aug
