interviews, Hie Daily has com hided
that Seth Newton and Malia Villegas
provide the stronger of the two plat
forms in this year's ASSU presidential election.
I hey combine an original vision lor the role of the
ASSU, while at the same time building on the
strengths of the frameworks left by their predeces
sors.
After holding a three month-long series of dia
logues with different student groups on campus,
they created iheii Platform for Accountability and
C lhange (I'AC). I his platform thus reflects the con
cerns ol students from across Stanford and aims to
instill a more participatory and social ethic in the
ASSU by adhering to a set of font principles.
These principles are to increase the power of stu
dents in decision-making at Stanford on an institu
tional level, to address issues of University responsi-

bility that are systematically ignored, to ac tively pro
mote diversity of all kinds and provide a voice
against disc rimination of all types and to emphasize
the need for increased accountability, transparency
and dialogue between the administration, ASSU
and students.
I he PAC, while ambitious, is also realistic and
reflects a high level of maturity and thought. New
ton and Villegas' goals include attaining two student
positions on the Board of Trustees and laying the
groundwork fora new student union, which would
provide ample room for student groups and the
performing arts. They also plan to support and ini
tiate efforts to improve Stanford's commitment to
diversity by addressing issues such as Stanford's
tenure policies and community center funding and
to serve as a voice for students beyond Stanford by
developing working relationships with students at
other universities in the United States and abroad.
In addition, they want to continue building on
existing programs to bring students together.

Newton and Villegas together have a solid foun
dation of experience t hat they can use to implement
their goals. Some of Newton's past roles include co
coordinator of Students for Environmental Action
at Stanford, co-coordinator for the Coalition for
Ixibor, Dignity, and Justice as well as being the co
coordinator of Stanford's first exhibit on art for
social change.
Villegas complements him with her experience
in the ASSU. She has served on the fiosh council,
has been an ASSU undergraduate senator, has
chaired the ASSU appropriations committee and
has been a member of the special fees committee.
I he two also plan to form a cabinet of six to 12
students from different student groups in order to
keep the pair and the ASSU in tune with the stu
dent body.
Though both slates have the experience neces
sary to be successful and both appear to be address
ing many of the same issues, Newton and Villegas
have the vision it takes to make truly innovative

leaders.
Kven more importantly, Newton and Villegas
have taken the time to reach out to the student com
munities they would affect as ASSU president and
vice president, ensuring that they are in touch with
the issues facing these communities. It is from this
dialogue that Newton and Villegas have created
their platform, giving those communities that have
traditionally voiced feelings of marginalization by
the ASSU the chance to finally be involved in the
organization's leadership.
I his kind of community outreach and proactive
commitment to student voice are clear indications of
how Newton and Villegas have and will take the
ASSU to new heights. At a time when the student
body feels isolated from decision-making processes
at Stanford in general as well as isolated from the
ASSU, the Platform for Accountability and Change
is needed to make the ASSU accessible to the entire
Stanford community and take the organization to
the nexi level of student representation.
