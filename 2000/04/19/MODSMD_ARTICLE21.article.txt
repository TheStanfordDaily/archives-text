RETURNING GROUPS
Alternative $21,300
Spring Break (UO $1.11)
12 3 4 5
ASB is a strong program that provides over
150 students with the opportunity to explore
social issues, service learning and communi
ty action through various programs operat-

ing during spring break. ASB definitively
serves a need that would otherwise go unmet
and would he missed should it not exist on
campus. The program needs its special fees
to continue operating and has made exten
sive efforts this past year to fundraise outside
of special fees. Since the program must limit
itself to a certain number of trips and stu
dents, ASB could increase its programming
in the spring quarter, such as holding
forums or dorm talks, so that participants
and leaders can share their service experi
ences with other students.

Asian American $28,569
Students (UO $1.48)
Association
12 3 4 5
AASA is an umbrella organization that pro
vides resources and support lor 10 Asian-
American student groups. Its tluee-pronged
locus, 011 social, cultural and political issues, is
a well-executed one, making it a group that
would definitely be missed il it didn't exist.
AASA also makes an admirable ellbrt to
lundraise and bring in money lor its groups
outside of the monies il receives from special
lees, and it could focus on this more for the
upcoming year. AASA's programming is stay
ing balanced next year and will not increase to
any great extent, in conjunction with only a
I.(') percent increase in special lee requests
from last year.
ASSU $89,770
Legal Counseling (B $2.18)
12 3 4 5
I lie ASM Legal Counseling Olfice has pro
vided liee legal advice to Stanford students
lor many years. Although the IXX) cannot
represent students in court, their stall attor
neys locus on "preventative law" and will
answer questions about parking tickets,
bankruptcy, and divorce, among other
issues. This past year, the IXX) advised
about 700 graduate students and 400 under
graduates. Although their special fee request
is large, the service they provide is a huge
asset to the student body. However, it is
important that the IXX) increase its publici
ty efforts dramatically since many students
are completely unaware that this invaluable
service even exists.
ASSU $121,901
Speakers Bureau (B $2.93)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student-run
organization that brings well-known speak
ers to campus, organizes debates and panel
discussions on current events and co-spon
sors other student groups' speaking events
and discussions. The group increased their
budget by 3.1 percent in order to increase
the amount of money they have available to
advertise their events and to have more
money available to attract world-renowned
speakers to campus. Part of the ASSU Speak
ers Bureau special fee is used to pay the
salaries of its two officers. Providing free lec

tures by famous figures and assisting other
groups in doing the same makes the ASSU
Speakers Bureau a valuable organization on
campus whose presence would be missed.
Barrio $21,299.84
Assistance (UO $1.11)
1 2 3 4 5
I his group has tutored school-age children
for 2H years, and they have a lot to show for
it, having used that time to build a presti
gious and effective program lor area youth
who would have no exposure to a university
like Stanford otherwise. Their budget is
meticulously and efficiently organized and
they work very hard to establish outside
funding. They provide a strong link between
children in Fast Palo Alto and Stanford stu
dents. Barrio Assistance, in providing a stim
ulating experience of Stanford lor young
children who return year after year, is truly
an invaluable asset to the community.
Black $27,270
Student Union (UO $1.41)
12 3 4 5
I he Black Student Union, a vital part of the
African-American community at Stanford, has
demonstrated a clear sense of purpose and
constituency as well as a broad range of pro
gramming designed to benefit not only the
Stanford community, but also, local areas.
Special lees provide funding for events such as
the Kwanzaa celebration, a welcome reception
for black freshmen during orientation, the
Soul Food Dinner and the BSU's high school
conference which is an important outreach
into Bay Area communities. In addition, the
BSU cosponsors many events with other cam
pus organizations such as the Kevin Powell
lecture this year, and the group plans to focus
on attracting a prominent speaker to campus
in the coming year.
Club Sports $154,440
(B $3.75)
12 3 4 5
The Club Sports special fee provides fund
ing for the 18 Club Sports teams ranging
from squash to mountain biking. These
teams receive little funding from the Athlet
ic Department, and the special fee is used to
cover the costs of equipment, travel and
other expenses. Stanford's Club Sports
teams enjoy unparalleled success around the

country with teams such as women's rugby
and women's ultimate Frisbee capturing
national titles last year. The special fee is cru
cial to the continuation of the hugely suc
cessful Club Sports program.
International $9,791.30
Undergraduate (UO $0.51)
Community
12 3 4 5
As the only on-canipus group serving Stan
ford's population of international students
through events such as International Stu
dent Orientation, dinners, workshops and
cultural activities, lUC fulfills a vital function
that would otherwise go unmet. However,
despite this apparent focus on international
students, the organization is open to every
one and attempts to reach out to students
from all backgrounds in its programming.
Moreover, this year's special fee request rep
resents only a small request increase from
last year's fee.
Kids with $9,134.39
Dreams (UO $0.47)
12 3 4 5
Kids with Dreams is a community service
organization whose primary goal in previous
years has been outreach to developmentally
handicapped children in the Bay Area. In the
last year, this organization has been successful
in also hosting a large, extremely successful,
and very well-organized conference introduc
ing the idea of "social entrepreneurship,"
demonstrating the group's commitment to the
campus community at large. Along with a
decrease in this year's special fee request, their
budgets reflect an efficient use of funding, and
they have been diligent in seeking alternate
sources of funding.
KZSU $84,944
(UO $2.06)
12 3 4 5
As a student-run radio station featuring sev
eral types of programming, including news,
sporting events, and music, KZSU provides
a valuable service to the campus. However,
the station could be more active in its overall
publicity efforts to make others more aware
of its presence. Furthermore, the organiza
tion has run into some problems with debt in
recent years that it must attempt to rectify
immediately.
