In an effort to make informed specitd-fee
endorsements, members of The Daily's editorial
board spent numerous hours during the fast two
weeks reviewing the budgets and ASSU Elections
Handbook statements submitted by student gionfis
requesting special fees to the , 1.5.57 The members
of the editorial hoard also met with representatives
of each of the groups and asked them about the
group's goals, its an oiiiplisliineiits during the past
year, plans for expansion or improvement in the
taming academic year and how special-fee funds
would he spent.
liased on the submitted information ami
interview discussions, the board readied an
endorsement decision for each group based on a
majority vole wiJhhi the hoard. The board has
tried to unhide as much information about each
group as possible in the explanation of its
endorsements. The Daily encourages all students
to obtain a copy of tin■ A SSI' I lections Handbook
anil read each group's statement and budget to
reach then own conclusions.

group on a I to 5 scale that assesses the
group's ellectiveness and its value.
In evaluating the groups, the editorial
hoard closely examined the achievements
of the lee groups during the past veaiand
the viability ol the group's plans lor the
upcoming year.
Student groups that are requesting a

RETURNING GROUPS
Alternative $21,300
Spring Break (UO $1.11)
12 3 4 5
ASB is a strong program that provides over
150 students with the opportunity to explore
social issues, service learning and communi
ty action through various programs operat-

ing during spring break. ASB definitively
serves a need that would otherwise go unmet
and would he missed should it not exist on
campus. The program needs its special fees
to continue operating and has made exten
sive efforts this past year to fundraise outside
of special fees. Since the program must limit
itself to a certain number of trips and stu
dents, ASB could increase its programming
in the spring quarter, such as holding
forums or dorm talks, so that participants
and leaders can share their service experi
ences with other students.

Asian American $28,569
Students (UO $1.48)
Association
12 3 4 5
AASA is an umbrella organization that pro
vides resources and support lor 10 Asian-
American student groups. Its tluee-pronged
locus, 011 social, cultural and political issues, is
a well-executed one, making it a group that
would definitely be missed il it didn't exist.
AASA also makes an admirable ellbrt to
lundraise and bring in money lor its groups
outside of the monies il receives from special
lees, and it could focus on this more for the
upcoming year. AASA's programming is stay
ing balanced next year and will not increase to
any great extent, in conjunction with only a
I.(') percent increase in special lee requests
from last year.
ASSU $89,770
Legal Counseling (B $2.18)
12 3 4 5
I lie ASM Legal Counseling Olfice has pro
vided liee legal advice to Stanford students
lor many years. Although the IXX) cannot
represent students in court, their stall attor
neys locus on "preventative law" and will
answer questions about parking tickets,
bankruptcy, and divorce, among other
issues. This past year, the IXX) advised
about 700 graduate students and 400 under
graduates. Although their special fee request
is large, the service they provide is a huge
asset to the student body. However, it is
important that the IXX) increase its publici
ty efforts dramatically since many students
are completely unaware that this invaluable
service even exists.
ASSU $121,901
Speakers Bureau (B $2.93)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student-run
organization that brings well-known speak
ers to campus, organizes debates and panel
discussions on current events and co-spon
sors other student groups' speaking events
and discussions. The group increased their
budget by 3.1 percent in order to increase
the amount of money they have available to
advertise their events and to have more
money available to attract world-renowned
speakers to campus. Part of the ASSU Speak
ers Bureau special fee is used to pay the
salaries of its two officers. Providing free lec

tures by famous figures and assisting other
groups in doing the same makes the ASSU
Speakers Bureau a valuable organization on
campus whose presence would be missed.
Barrio $21,299.84
Assistance (UO $1.11)
1 2 3 4 5
I his group has tutored school-age children
for 2H years, and they have a lot to show for
it, having used that time to build a presti
gious and effective program lor area youth
who would have no exposure to a university
like Stanford otherwise. Their budget is
meticulously and efficiently organized and
they work very hard to establish outside
funding. They provide a strong link between
children in Fast Palo Alto and Stanford stu
dents. Barrio Assistance, in providing a stim
ulating experience of Stanford lor young
children who return year after year, is truly
an invaluable asset to the community.
Black $27,270
Student Union (UO $1.41)
12 3 4 5
I he Black Student Union, a vital part of the
African-American community at Stanford, has
demonstrated a clear sense of purpose and
constituency as well as a broad range of pro
gramming designed to benefit not only the
Stanford community, but also, local areas.
Special lees provide funding for events such as
the Kwanzaa celebration, a welcome reception
for black freshmen during orientation, the
Soul Food Dinner and the BSU's high school
conference which is an important outreach
into Bay Area communities. In addition, the
BSU cosponsors many events with other cam
pus organizations such as the Kevin Powell
lecture this year, and the group plans to focus
on attracting a prominent speaker to campus
in the coming year.
Club Sports $154,440
(B $3.75)
12 3 4 5
The Club Sports special fee provides fund
ing for the 18 Club Sports teams ranging
from squash to mountain biking. These
teams receive little funding from the Athlet
ic Department, and the special fee is used to
cover the costs of equipment, travel and
other expenses. Stanford's Club Sports
teams enjoy unparalleled success around the

country with teams such as women's rugby
and women's ultimate Frisbee capturing
national titles last year. The special fee is cru
cial to the continuation of the hugely suc
cessful Club Sports program.
International $9,791.30
Undergraduate (UO $0.51)
Community
12 3 4 5
As the only on-canipus group serving Stan
ford's population of international students
through events such as International Stu
dent Orientation, dinners, workshops and
cultural activities, lUC fulfills a vital function
that would otherwise go unmet. However,
despite this apparent focus on international
students, the organization is open to every
one and attempts to reach out to students
from all backgrounds in its programming.
Moreover, this year's special fee request rep
resents only a small request increase from
last year's fee.
Kids with $9,134.39
Dreams (UO $0.47)
12 3 4 5
Kids with Dreams is a community service
organization whose primary goal in previous
years has been outreach to developmentally
handicapped children in the Bay Area. In the
last year, this organization has been successful
in also hosting a large, extremely successful,
and very well-organized conference introduc
ing the idea of "social entrepreneurship,"
demonstrating the group's commitment to the
campus community at large. Along with a
decrease in this year's special fee request, their
budgets reflect an efficient use of funding, and
they have been diligent in seeking alternate
sources of funding.
KZSU $84,944
(UO $2.06)
12 3 4 5
As a student-run radio station featuring sev
eral types of programming, including news,
sporting events, and music, KZSU provides
a valuable service to the campus. However,
the station could be more active in its overall
publicity efforts to make others more aware
of its presence. Furthermore, the organiza
tion has run into some problems with debt in
recent years that it must attempt to rectify
immediately.

MEChA $34,911
(UO $1.81)
12 3 4 5
MEChA is a well-organized, strong group that
provides programming lonised on addressing
the needs ol Chicano/a and l.alino/a students
on campus, as well as bringing the culture to
the greater Stanford community. MEChA
does very well in fundraising and is active in
the community, providing students with the
chance to he involved in activism surrounding
issues ranging from Webb Ranch to the
grapes boycott. The group holds a variety of
different programs during the year, from
Caesar Chavez Commemoration Week to Dia
de los Muertos, and it serves an important role
in the community.
Mind's Eye $13,146
(UO $0.68)
12 3 4 5
I he Mind's Eye publishes two issues a year of
student photography, poetry, short stories,
and painting. As (he only literary magazine on
campus, the Mind's Kye serves an important
need that would otherwise go unmet. While
these students strive to produce a high-quality
journal of expression, a much larger effort at
publicity is necessary for this group to serve
the larger campus most effectively.
NAACP $15,395
(UO $0.80)
12 3 4 5
Requesting a special lee lor the second year, the
Stanford chapter of the NAACP has done a
good job of re-organizing its budget to address
problems noted in its first year of using spec ial
fees with only a modest increase in its special lee
request. The group has a strong sense of its
constituency, serving it in many ways, including
through the co-sponsorship of events with
other organizations. I n addition, given the role
of the NAACP across the nation, it is important
for Stanford to have its own chapter of this
prestigious organization.
Project $6,153
Motivation (UO $0.32)
12 3 4 5
Project Motivation works to expose at-risk
youth to the benefits of college by bringing
them to Stanford in.in eflort to put them on
the track to success. I he group organizes
events like "A Day with an Undergrad," pro
vides information [jackets on applying to col
lege, and has even seen its own graduates go
on to attend Stanford. This 20-year-old pro
gram decreased its special fee request by 11
percent this year, spending their its efficiently
in addition to serving an important purpose
in a creative and committed way.
SCBN $19,195
(B $0.47)
12 3 4 5
The most impressive thing about this group is
the lact that they have managed to reduce this
year's special fee request by 14 percent. How
ever, the rest of their goals for next year seem
a bit hazy and unrealistic. The group is defi
nitely a plus lor students as it provides the
campus with free cable, but the actual number
of people who choose to use this service is
unclear.
Stanford $30,251
American Indian (U051.57)
Organization
12 3 4 5
SAIO serves as the social, political and cultur
al center for the American Indian, Alaska
Native and Native Hawaiian communities at
Stanford. The group is responsible for the

Stanford Powwow, as well as a number of
other campus cultural events to reflect the
diverse traditions of Native American culture.
The group has demonstrated a clear sense of
its own constituency, but SAIO events do
reach the entire campus, not just the Ameri
can Indian population. SAIO is the primary
organization responsible for the Native Amer
ican community and is a valuable asset to a
culturally diverse Stanford campus.
Stanford Axe $ 10,185
Committee (UO $0.53)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Axe Committee was founded
to maintain the traditions of the University
and its Athletics Department. Its responsibil
ities include annual Big Came week activi
ties, the protection of the Axe when it is on
campus and the distribution of a handbook
for freshmen containing the history and tra
ditions of Stanford. The group has minimal
sources of funding and relies almost entirely
on its special fee to continue its operation.
Axe Comm currently serves an important
function but could make more of an effort to
be active outside of the football season.
Besides occasional attendance at some sport
ing events and the sponsoring of the frisbee
golf tournament in the spring, the group is
not visible on campus after fall quarter. Axe
Comm needs to address the above issues
before it can become a wise investment for
the Stanford Community.
Stanford Band $59,980
(LSJUMB) (UO $3.11)
1/ 3 4
A»«.. Vw/
The LSJUMB wears a number of hats — from
performing all-campus rallies to inspiring
sports teams at home and on the road. Mem
bership in the Band is open to all students,
regardless of musical ability and Band events
serve the entire campus. Every time you've
run with the Band at midnight or jumped in
the middle of "All Right Now" at a sporting
event, you see your spec ial fee dollars at work.
The Band is a vital part of Stanford spirit.
Stanford $20,060
Chamber Chorale (B $0.49)
12 3 4 5
I his group has taken on the lofty goal of
improving Stanford's reputation in the arts
and lias clone an admirable job. All members
of the group must tryout again each year in a
sort of self-enforced re-evaluation process that
contributes to the strength of the group.
Approximately 3,(300 people attend their on
campus performances each year, and the
group tours nationally and internationally on
an amazingly efficient budget. This group lias
worked to increase its visibility on campus
and, in continuing this process, will do Stan
lord's music program a great service.
Stanford $ 17,700
Chaparral (UO $0.92)
12 3 4 5
I laving just completed its 100 th year of publi
cation, the Stanford Chaparral (The (ihappie)
is the campus' oldest humor publication.
Instantly recognizable with its door-to-door
delivery, The Chappie is known for its annual
()i ientation issues and "fake Dailies" as well as
a number of other publications throughout
the year. The group has asked fora nominal
increase in special lee and seeks to publish an
additional issue next year, making better use
of special fee funds. In addition, The ('.happie
has greatly increased its advertising campaign,
drawing in new sources of revenue to sup
plant special lee funding.
Stanford Community $6,196
Carnival (UO $0.32)
123 4 5

Stanford Community Carnival brings 500 to
1000 elementary school children and their
families to Stanford every spring quarter to
enjoy a day of free, safe fun put on by Stan
lord undergraduates from all across cam
pus. Dorms sponsor booths at the Carnival,
as do many clubs, sports teams, and other
student organizations. This year, without
increasing its special lee request, the Carni
val is expanding to invite the children of
Stanford workers and faculty, as well as
those who have been invited in the past —
children from East Palo Alto, East Menlo
Park, and the surrounding community. The
Community Carnival brings together Stan
ford students from across years, majors and
interests, particularly through its appeal to
students who may not necessarily consider
themselves "activists," to reach underprivi
leged children and provide them, as well as
their families and Stanford stall and faculty
families, with meaningful connections to
Stanford.
Stanford Conceris72,67o
Network (B $1.76)
12 3 4 5
Stanford Concert Network both organizes
and co-sponsors a variety of events through
out their year in an effort to provide quality
entertainment to Stanford students at little
or 110 cost. This year, the Concert Network
programs included the Coffee House series,
tiie Sir Mix-A-l.ot show at the Mausoleum,
and the Roots show. They have a salaried
staff and have introduced an unpaid intern
ship program. The group plans to increase
its programming in the coming year, .is well
as the caliber of the artists it brings to the
University, which, in part, is responsible for
the large increase in their special lee request
this year. The group reaches the entire cam
pus through its co-sponsorships of a wide
range of events with a diverse group of orga
nizations who could not produce their
events without the support of the Concert
Network.
Stanford Film $31,980
Society (UO $ 1.66)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Film Society is the only group
on campus devoted to the promotion of film
as an art, educational and entertainment
medium. Its free film screenings and assis
tance to undergraduates in the production of
lilms fills the void left by the lack of an under
graduate film studies curriculum at Stanford.
Though the group has decreased its special
lee request this year, it could make more of an
attempt to seek outside sources of funding. It
could also better advertise its events to the
Stanford community in an effort to serve the
campus more effectively.
Stanford in $22,838
Government (UO$1.18)
12 3 4 5
Through fellowships, speakers series, election
drives and other activities, Stanford in Cov
erninent provides an invaluable political set
vice to Stanford students. The group has done
extensive outside lundraising and consistently
spends the majority of their special lee money
each year. I his is the only non-partisan politi
cal group on campus, is efficiently run and
works to expand their programming each
year.
Stanford Jazz $20,130
Orchestra (U051.04)
12 3 4 5
I'he Stanford Jazz Orchestra is the only siu
dent-run group focusing on jazz, and there
fore provides a potentially valuable service to
this campus. However, the organization's
biggest shortcoming is that its performances
do not draw much of a student audience. Fur
thermore, up till now, it has sought very little
outside funding and instead relies heavily on
special lees.

Stanford $15,195
Mock Trial (UO $0.79)
12 3 4 5
Stanford Mock Trial aims to increase knowl
edge of the American legal system through
participation in events held by the American
Mock I rial Association. I lie groups has
increased its special lee request this year by
(i.71 percent in order to decrease the amount
of money that each student must contribute in
order to attend the regional and national coin
petitions that they have qualified lor. Though
the group lias dcme an excellent job ol seeking
outside sources of funding and of ellicienth
using their money, they only reach a very
small portion ol the Stanford community.
They should make more of an attempt to
reach out to the Stanford community in the
future.
Stanford Project $4,531
On Nutrition (UO $0.24)
12 3 4 5
For 11 years SPOON lias been collecting
unused I bod from campus residences lor dis
tribution to area food pantries lor the hungry .
SPOON is requesting a larger spec ial lee, Inn
lias planned some increases in programming
to necessitate this rise. They have a good sense
of their constituency and have consistently
found outside sources of funding, the best
example of which is their efficient use of left
over campus I bod to alleviate hunger in the
communities surrounding Stanford.
Stanford Solar $31,202
Car Project (UO $1.62)
12 3 4 5
I lie Stanford Solar Car Project comprises
graduate and undergraduate students with an
interest in engineering who design and build
a solar car which is then used in races and dis
played at events. Most of the group's funding
comes from outside donations ol product
materials from companies, but given the
heavy cost of such a project the group should
do more to attract corporate monetary spon
sorship. Furthermore, .is it is alreadv limited
to a particular campus constituency, the
group needs to strengthen its campus out
reach ellbrts, so that more students are aware
of its presence.
Stanford's $24,098.80
Women (UO $1.25)
Coalition
1 A
4
I lie Women's Coalition is a strong umhrella
group that coordinates the needs and activi
ties of the various women's groups on campus.
The Coalition serves an important purpose, as
many of the groups under the (oalition could
not operate without special lees and benefit by
having connections to other women's groups.
The Coalition also evaluates groups consis
tently, and has streamlined its budget this vear
so that its.special lee request is a decrease from
last year's.
Students for $9,085.76
Environmental (UO $0.47)
Action at Stanford
12 3 4 5
SFAS is an activist group working on environ
mental justice issues. I his year, the group has
made ellbrts to educate the campus about local
environmental justice campaigns, in addition
to bringing speakers to campus and panic i pat -
ing in the annual Dis-Orientation Conference
in the fall. Although SFAS oilers .in impoi t.inl
space lor student activists with broad interests,
the group could benefit the coiiiuuinilv more
In reaching out to the campus mainstream.
Without the support ol SFAS. however, main
smaller environmental groups would not exist,
making ils presence essential.

NEW GROUPS
ASSU Online $16,500
Course Guide (UO $0.86)
12 3 4 5
The ASS I Online Course Guide lias under
gone a dramatic transformation over the last
three vears, ending in its current iteration —
.( site lh.it iiu hides all tlx- information of both
the lime Schedule and the Bulletin in lull)
searchable form. Although the site provides
an invaluable service from which many stu
dents would benefit greatly, it is woefully
under'public'i/ed, making improved publicity
a top priority tor this group next year.
Electrolytes $5,250
(UO $0.27)
12 3 4 5
I he Electrolytes were formed recently to pro
mote Electronica music on campus in safe
environments that can act as alternatives to
raves. The group is still a new one and does
not yel have a strong sense of constituency —
most of its 50 to 60 members participate in the
group through an e-mail list. The Electrolytes
need to make stronger ellbrts in the coming
year to solidify its internal organi/atic>n and, in
promoting their organization, the Electrolytes
should consider carefully how best to reach
the larger student community, specifically
those who would not regularly attend events
like those the Electrolytes sponsor.
Graduate Women's $14,340
Network (GO $0.65)
12 3 4 5
l he Graduate Women's Network acts as an
academic, support, information and ac tivities
network, formed and led by graduate women
of all disciplines. It seeks to bring graduate
women together in a supportive and collabo
rative environment to foster academic
achievement and personal wellness. It also
reaches out to the wives of graduate students
and to undergraduate women in the hopes of
providing a mentoring relationship. The
group did not apply fora special fee last year,
but it does receive outside sources of funding
in an attempt to reduce the amount it needs to
seek from special fees. I hrough multiple pro
grams held in the past two years, the Gradu
ate Women's Network has proven itself to be
deserving ola spec ial lee.
Muslim Students $13,087
