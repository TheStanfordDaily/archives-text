# New form simplifies financial aid
## New 'master promissory note' further clarifies aid application process 
### KARI LUNDGREN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A master promissory note will be
available for the 20(M)-2001 academic
year, part of a plan announced in May
which aims to make the financial aid sys
tem more efficient and user-friendly.
The master promissory note allows
students who are renewing their finan
cial aid requests to simply update the in
formation they provided the previous
year.
Because the financial aid document is

,i promissory note, I lit* government re
quires a written signature, heme it still
must be primed and mailed.
Prior to this improvement, the plan
attempted to make the financial aid ap
plication process easier by allowing stu
dents with a Stafford Loan to complete
their applications online. Though these
applications still had to be printed,
signed and posted to the Northwest Ed
ucation Loan Association, making them
available online simplifies the process for
students away from home dining the
summer months.
I'ntil 1998-1999, the forms had been
available fora period of 15 days via the
Web and then were mailed to students'
homes.
Cynthia Hartley, director of student
awards at the financial Aid Office, ex

plained, "Stiidcnts arc eligible for the
amounts authorized by the FAO — ac
cording to federal regulation — which
are $2,025 for freshmen; ">()() for
sophomores; 55,500 each undergradu
ate year thereafter, (iraduatc students
mav borrow a maximum of $18,500 per
academic year in subsidized and unsub
sidized Stafford Loan funds."
I lie process was time-consuming for
students to increase or decrease their
loans each following year. !■ very year a
student applied for aid, all the basic
promissory information, stub as par
ents' name and address, had to be resub
mitted with signatures. I'nder the new
system, that information will be resub
mitted automatically.
