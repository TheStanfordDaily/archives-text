Hoover Fellow Joseph McNamara discusses the current U.S. drug policy as part of a panel opposed
to current trends in the war on drugs.
Military action would not de
crease demand on the streets of
America, according to Lindsay-
Polland, hut would undermine
peace negotiations between the
government and rebel groups,
lie believes the lighting would
also result in the displacement of
many Colombians from their
homeland.
"1 have to wonder why are
sending guns to that area," Lind
say-Polland said. "People in Con
gress believe you have to go to the
source to eliminate the drug
problem. Kven if you believe this

strategy is effective, which is
doubtful, it's disturbing because it
suggests that our victims are more
important than the victims in
Colombia."
As policy alternatives, McNa
niara and Rosenbaum advocate
decriminalizing marijuana and
regulating it like alcohol. All pan
elists favor a redistribution of the
current budget into efforts aimed
at prevention and rehabilitation.
l here was consensus among
the panelists that public awareness
of the drug war's costs is key in re
forming policy.
"The drug war is un-American,
but there's a lot of room fora re
form movement," said McNama
ra. "What's needed most is discus
sion and debate about this issue."
