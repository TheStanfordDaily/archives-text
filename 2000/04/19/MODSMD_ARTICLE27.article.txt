## Objectivity out the door 
### 
I try hard not to be a homer when the N FL draft
rolls around each year. Objectively, 1 know
that I roy Walters does not have the height to
he a first-round prospect. Reasonably, Todd
Husak does not have the tools to

be an NFL starter. Tim Smith
probably wouldn't stand a chance
against, say, Randy Moss.
But every year, there's a little
voice that says to me, "What does
Mel Riper, Jr. know? What do
any of those guys know?" You all
know the voice. Everyone that
has ever rooted lor their home
town or their school < >r the closest

major metropolitan area knows that voice.
It's the same voice that says, "(»o ahead, put Stan
ford in the Final Four. C.o put Arizona in there, too;
they beat the hell out of us, so they must he good."
It's the same voice that says, "Yeah, plunk down fifty
bucks on the women's water polo national champi
onships. Sure, you haven't ever seen a game, but
we've gotta be good at it." You hear it whispering at
night, "C'tnon, you can pick up Tim Young for your
fantasy NBA team — have some pride!"
This voice is extremely dumb, for the most part.
It expresses the sort of irrationality that maddens
people who don't watch ESPN, the sort of irrationality
