## Objectivity out the door 
### 
I try hard not to be a homer when the N FL draft
rolls around each year. Objectively, 1 know
that I roy Walters does not have the height to
he a first-round prospect. Reasonably, Todd
Husak does not have the tools to

be an NFL starter. Tim Smith
probably wouldn't stand a chance
against, say, Randy Moss.
But every year, there's a little
voice that says to me, "What does
Mel Riper, Jr. know? What do
any of those guys know?" You all
know the voice. Everyone that
has ever rooted lor their home
town or their school < >r the closest

major metropolitan area knows that voice.
It's the same voice that says, "(»o ahead, put Stan
ford in the Final Four. C.o put Arizona in there, too;
they beat the hell out of us, so they must he good."
It's the same voice that says, "Yeah, plunk down fifty
bucks on the women's water polo national champi
onships. Sure, you haven't ever seen a game, but
we've gotta be good at it." You hear it whispering at
night, "C'tnon, you can pick up Tim Young for your
fantasy NBA team — have some pride!"
This voice is extremely dumb, for the most part.
It expresses the sort of irrationality that maddens
people who don't watch ESPN, the sort of irrationality


Jeff Cooper
that you're supposed to burn out
of yourself as an objective sports
journalist. Real journalists will
have you believe that lack of objec
tivity in sports was directly re
sponsible for the L.A. Clippers,
the U.S. national men's soccer
team, Watergate, the Spanish-
American War and the way your
professor never tucks his shirt in
all the way.
Fortunately, I am not a real
journalist, and 1 sat and listened to
that voice all weekend as round
after round went by with nary a
block "S" logo to be seen.
"Do you believe this?" the voice
said. "Look at some of these stiffs
that at e going before Troy? Den
nis Northcutt, Danny Farmer, J. R.
Redmond? He played all those
guys. I'm pretty sure one of those
guys carried his team to the Rose
Bowl, and it wasn't any of these
fools."
"fie reasonable," I suggested to
myself. "Troy's too little. Can you
see him out there against Deion?

He's five inches taller, twenty
pounds heavier."
"And? It's not like they left him
open every play this year. I saw
that man drag down balls in dou
ble coverage that most people
would need Indiana Jones to find.
All this 'durability' question? Man,
Troy can go over the middle lull
speed and still put a move on
that'll break ankles like that
woman in 'Misery.' I le's had more
people try to bring him down than
Bob Knight and Bill Gates put to
gether,and he's still moving." The
voice rested, expectant.
"Listen," I argued, "an Nil.
wide receiver today needs to block
downfield, give a big target, and
light off bumps from defensive
ends who are twice their si/e. I le's
just not the prototype."
"Oh, of course, forgive me," the
voice replied. "Kind of like Ki-Jana
Carter was the running back of the
future? And Mike Mamula was the
defensive end of the future? Kind
of like how all those guys picked in
front of Terrell Davis ended up
Super Bowl MVP also?"
And there's the rub. The voice
is right. Because the fact of the
matter is, the draft guys and the

bookies have a pretty good sense of
what ii takes to play in the NIL.
But not a perfect sense.
And that's what keeps the irra
tional voice alive: sports are irra
tional, if they're any fun at all.
Sometimes you get a seventh
round pick turn into a superstar.
More often, you get a guy with
most — not all — of the tools just
find his niche; these ate the Glyn
Milburns of the world.
Is the four inches and twenty
pounds that Walters gives up to
Peter Warrick enough of a differ
ence to justify millions of dollars in
contract money and guaranteed
playing time? Probably. 1 can force
myself to make that concession.
But you just don't know, because
Walters — and Husak, and Smith
— have pulled stranger finishes
out of their collective behinds be
fore. Walters will get a chance to
make the Minnesota Vikings,
where his father is an assistant
coach; that much is certain. Be
yond that, we'll just have to wait
and see.

)eff Cooper, a junior, /'.s pretty sure he
could take I)eion, if the Patriots would
just give him a trxout.
