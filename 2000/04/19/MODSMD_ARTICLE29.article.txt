### KATIE FITZPATRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
One of the greatest last names in
Stanford Athletics, junior gymnast
Jennifer Exaltacion, achieved one
of the great distinctions in colle
giate athletics last weekend when
she became a two-time Ail-Ameri
can.
Before even arriving on the
Farm, the 4" 10 Exaltacion had ac
complished big things as one of the
top gymnasts in Canada. Exalta
cion, a nine-time CCanadian Nation
al ('.hampion and three-time World
Championships team member,
placed high enough individually at
World Championships to qualify
Canada fora team berth at the
Olympics. She went on to achieve
the goal of every young gymnast's
dreams when she qualified to be a
member of the 1996 Canadian
Olympic Cynmastics 1 earn.
She credits her parents as the
most influential people in her life
for their contribution to her
Olympic experience.
"My parents allowed me to make
my dreams happen by putting faith
in me and sacrificing their own
lives," Exaltacion said. "I get my
stubbornness from my dad who
taught me that if you want some
thing you really have to go after it."
She went after the C)lympics and
led the Canadian team.
"The Olympics was a pretty

overwhelming experience. 1 had
been working towards it for so long
and had made so main sacrifices, I
wanted to make it the greatest ex
perience."
After achieving the pinnacle of a
gymnastics career by age 1(5, Jen Ex
— as she is known to teammates —
decided to focus on her academics
and chose Stanford over other top
gymnastics programs. But even
with her focus on academic s, the ju
nior hasn't lost her drive for her
sport.
"I knew coining here that ac ade
mics would be a priority but 1
wasn't expecting to be focusing as
hard on gymnastics as 1 do now.
I lie program is moving in the right
direction and the expectations for it
have grown," Exaltac ion said.
"She has been a contributor
since the day she got here. Ex is a
hard worker and a consistent per
former," said assistant coach
Wayne Wright.
Named "Most Outstanding
Gymnast" with classmate |enny
Wilson and claiming the school
record on beam as a sophomore,
Exaltacion has also found her ac ad
emic niche, recently deciding to
change her major from Psychology
to Product Design.
"Freshman year was a challenge
academically but I've found what 1
want to clo, the motivation to do it,
and where 1 fit in," Exaltacion said.
Despite her intensity in the gym

and on her academics, the junior
has another side to her.
"She's quiet and well-mannered
but there is a wild side," Wright
said.
Her off-court personality is
much more lively than the focused
performer spectators have grown
accustomed to at Burnham Pavil
ion.
"Everything is more fun with Ex
around," said senior teammate
Earissa Fontaine who first met her
at the 1994 World Championships
in Dortmund, Germany.
" 1 lie most distinguishable thing
about her is her laugh," agreed
sophomore teammate Becky Mel
druin. "You walk into a party and
there's the short Canadian in the
center of a group of people, squeal

ing and slapping her leg."
Exaltacion's laughter and
screams of delight can be so loud as
to (ill the room often leaving one to
wonder such a little person can
make so much noise. But, Exalta
c ion seems to always direct all her
energ) into each and every task.
"Ex is always carrying around
this 111 (iE book bag — it's serious
ly at least equal to her si/.e and
weight if not more. She just scurries
from one place to the next, always
with a destination and a purpose, al
ways having something to do that's
really important," said sophomore
teammate Katy Herbert.
"She's one of the few people that
never procrastinates. She knows
