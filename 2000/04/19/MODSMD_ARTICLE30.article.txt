# No reprieve for Stanford softball
## Women head to No. 5 Fresno State for a non-conference battle 
### MAUREEN MULLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Looking at the 3-8 Pacific 10 Conference
record of the Stanford softball team ('54-1 1) one
would think that they had to be struggling.
However, while ibis statistic is disappointing
even to the most ardent of supporters, ii cer
tainly does not tell the entire story.
Despite I he struggle in conference play, Stan
ford is doing extremely well in its other contests.
Fifteen straight non-conference wins have sky
rocketed the Cardinal to the No. 9 position in
the country and to the status of a national con
tender.

"What I kcc'i > mentioning to everyone is the
lough nature of our conference," said head
coach John Rittman. "Last year the last placed
team in the I'ac-10 went on to go to the ('.ollege
World Series."
I he team is going to gel a sneak peak at a
possible post-season opponent when it travels to
Fresno State fora double-header against the
fifth-ranked Bulldogs (42-9) today.
"These games are important because we get
a chance to check out a diamond we might see
again in a couple of weeks in the post-season,"
Rittman said. "We get the opportunity to famil
iarize ourselves with two All-Americansand play
against a really good ball club."
Not fin from the Cardinal's mind is un
doubtedly its 5-2 loss to the Bulldogs in the sec
ond round of the NCAA regionals down in Fres
no last year. Fresno went on to make its l()th
consecutive appearance in the College World

Scries.
Both teams are looking to continue winning
streaks of a kind. While Stanford looks to extend
its 15 non-conference wins, the Bulldogs have
won l ( .) straight games including Hawaii this
past weekend and hope to sweep through
tonight in similar fashion.

teams this season posting a 1-8 record, its sole

challenge to the Bulldogs.
Stanford will once again rely on its chorus of
freshmen pitchers at the mound. With the
