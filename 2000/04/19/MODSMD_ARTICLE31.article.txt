At the Mt. San Antonio College Relays this past
weekend, freshman Lauren Flesnman led her team
to victory in the 5,000 meters. Fleshman's time of
15 minutes, 50 18 seconds was a personal best
and qualified her for the national championships.

In the final regular-sea son home match of his Stan
ford career, senior Geoff Abrams handily defeated
his Pepperdine opponent 7-5, 6-2. The squad's
lone senior is currently riding a 15 match win streak
in singles play.
