# How they line up
## What to look for in an Internet phone service 
### SALAS SARAIYA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Back in the clays of 'yore, Jerry Yang and his crew
graduated from Stanford, invented ;i Weh browser and
decided to make it public access. First, it was free Web
browsers, then free e-mail and now free phone calls.
I he idea of free services on the Internet has pro
gressed to such a degree that if yon charge people for
using your service, you are going to sell as many copies
as Vanilla Ice did with his hard core rap album. Serious
ly, he had one — I saw it on "VIII Real Stories."
There are three different methods of free interactive
vocal communication available on the Internet : I'C-to-
PC (America Online Instant Messenger, Phone Free, vis
italk), PC-to-Phone (Dialpad), and Phone-to-Phone (I-
Link, Freeway).
Before you check out of any of the PC l-to-P(. or P( l-to
phone services, you should go to visitalk.com and get
your free headset (with swivel microphone attached).
Let's start by discussing PC-to-PC voice conversa

lions. Sa\ one user, bigMone\Salsa, decides to send a
message to another user, purple Hair. First, big-
Money Salsa lias to make sure purplel lair is in his (on
tatt List. 1 hen he clicks on purple Hair, says "establish
connection," and voila, they are connected.
Although they're free, I'C-to-PC. sen ices have their
faults. Most of these Internet services only allow you to
call people who have the same service. With some (i.e.
AOLim), you should not talk with anyone you don't
know because they can see vour computer's IP address
when vou connect.
1 he conversations through these sen - ices are often
echoed, muddled and noisy because most users don't
have good microphones. 1 he connection also has a ten
dency to delay speech.
Since AOLim has a large built-in user base from its
text-based chats, it is a good service to use for talking to
a friend or coworker. I here are some limitations on the
service, however. For example, you can only talk to one
friend at at ime — no teleconferencing.
PhoneFree's service, which is billed as bringing Iree

telephone calling to the people, is more sophisticated
than AOLim's voice communication function. Phone-
Free allow s teleconferencing, where up to 12 people can
be on the line at one time.
Obviouslv, all 12 would need to have the service
downloaded onto their computer. I'honeFree also pro
vides video conferencing if the user has his own video
camera and has a voice mail feature that is similar to the
voice message feature on ICQ. I'honeFree has a l'C-to
phone service similar to Dialpad's, but PhoneFree's ser
vice costs $29 a month.
Visitalk's service is very similar to PhoneFree's. The
biggest difference is that I'honeFree has a bigger follow
ing. Since both users have to share the same service to
communicate, the amount of people using a given ser
vice has a big impact on how useful the service is.
Dialpad and I-l .ink's Talk Free avoid the problem of
both users needing to be on tlie same service because
they route \<>m calls to telephones rather than to com-
