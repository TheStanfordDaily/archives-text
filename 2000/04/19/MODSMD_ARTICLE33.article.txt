# How they line up
## What to look for in an Internet phone service 
### SALAS SARAIYA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Back in the clays of 'yore, Jerry Yang and his crew
graduated from Stanford, invented ;i Weh browser and
decided to make it public access. First, it was free Web
browsers, then free e-mail and now free phone calls.
I he idea of free services on the Internet has pro
gressed to such a degree that if yon charge people for
using your service, you are going to sell as many copies
as Vanilla Ice did with his hard core rap album. Serious
ly, he had one — I saw it on "VIII Real Stories."
There are three different methods of free interactive
vocal communication available on the Internet : I'C-to-
PC (America Online Instant Messenger, Phone Free, vis
italk), PC-to-Phone (Dialpad), and Phone-to-Phone (I-
Link, Freeway).
Before you check out of any of the PC l-to-P(. or P( l-to
phone services, you should go to visitalk.com and get
your free headset (with swivel microphone attached).
Let's start by discussing PC-to-PC voice conversa

lions. Sa\ one user, bigMone\Salsa, decides to send a
message to another user, purple Hair. First, big-
Money Salsa lias to make sure purplel lair is in his (on
tatt List. 1 hen he clicks on purple Hair, says "establish
connection," and voila, they are connected.
Although they're free, I'C-to-PC. sen ices have their
faults. Most of these Internet services only allow you to
call people who have the same service. With some (i.e.
AOLim), you should not talk with anyone you don't
know because they can see vour computer's IP address
when vou connect.
1 he conversations through these sen - ices are often
echoed, muddled and noisy because most users don't
have good microphones. 1 he connection also has a ten
dency to delay speech.
Since AOLim has a large built-in user base from its
text-based chats, it is a good service to use for talking to
a friend or coworker. I here are some limitations on the
service, however. For example, you can only talk to one
friend at at ime — no teleconferencing.
PhoneFree's service, which is billed as bringing Iree

telephone calling to the people, is more sophisticated
than AOLim's voice communication function. Phone-
Free allow s teleconferencing, where up to 12 people can
be on the line at one time.
Obviouslv, all 12 would need to have the service
downloaded onto their computer. I'honeFree also pro
vides video conferencing if the user has his own video
camera and has a voice mail feature that is similar to the
voice message feature on ICQ. I'honeFree has a l'C-to
phone service similar to Dialpad's, but PhoneFree's ser
vice costs $29 a month.
Visitalk's service is very similar to PhoneFree's. The
biggest difference is that I'honeFree has a bigger follow
ing. Since both users have to share the same service to
communicate, the amount of people using a given ser
vice has a big impact on how useful the service is.
Dialpad and I-l .ink's Talk Free avoid the problem of
both users needing to be on tlie same service because
they route \<>m calls to telephones rather than to com-

puters. Neither of these services
rt'(|iiires a download. Dialpad is
the more widely used service
(currently the #1(H) website), but
Talk Free (currently I-Link is
#4871) is more appealing to the
traditional phone user. The
biggest negative for both services
is that they only have a certain
number of phone wires accessible
to them. II too many people are
using their service, you won't be
able to. Another huge negative is
that these services severely limit
your calling options. While PC
to-PC services allow you to call
from anywhere in the world to
anywhere else in the world. Dial
pad requires that calls are made
to the United States and Talk-
Kree requires that you call from
the United States and to the Unit
ed States.
So let's say bigMoneySalsa is
sitting at his desktop with his mi
crophone up and ready and
wants to call Money Shah at
home. So he opens up his Dial

pad account, and up pops the
Java Applet where he can enter
Mr. Shah's home number. After
typing it in or referencing it from
the address book, he waits for Mr.
Shah to pic k up his phone. Then
the\ have their conversation, and
then they go on their merry way.
This conversation may last longer
than usual because of time delay.
If bigMoneySalsa wants to call
Mr. Shah on I-I.ink, however, he
first goes to the i-link.net Web silo
and clicks on Talk Free. Then he
enters his own phone number
and Mr. Shah's phone number
and Talk Free calls them both.
Then, voila, they are having a
phone conversation. After much
effort, we have finally gotten big-
Money Salsa off the Internet. big-
Money Salsa is having a domestic
phone call for free. I-I.ink is one
of the few sites that actually has a
business plan. Talk Free is more
like shareware than a finished
product. They want you to use
Talk Free and be so astounded
that you decide to use their V-
Link long distance program,
which is actually cheaper than
regular long distance and has
more functionality. It's worth

checking out.
Freeway (broadpoint.com)
also provides free telephone call
ing within the United States.
They don't really have any super
technology to speak of, though.
Just by going to the 13 road point
site and signing up fora Freeway
card, you are given access to two
free hours of calling a month.
Freeway will send you a card with
a PIN number in the mail, and
you just use it when making long
distance calls. The only catch?
For every two minutes of time
you anticipate talking, you have
to listen to one ten second com
mercial before the conversation
begins.
So what's the best service? It
depends. If you want to talk to
more than one person at a time,
get them all to join PhoneFreeor
Visitalk and use that service. If
you don't want to be a sales per
son and just want to talk to one
friend, get the newest version of
AOLim. If you like phones, use
Talk Free. If you like headsets,
but are calling someone who likes
phones, use Dialpad. Whatever
your preference, the option is
there. And it's free.

that you decide to use their V-
Link long distance program,
which is actually cheaper than
regular long distance and has
more functionality. It's worth

checking out.
Freeway (broadpoint.com)
also provides free telephone call
ing within the United States.
They don't really have any super
technology to speak of, though.
Just by going to the 13 road point
site and signing up fora Freeway
card, you are given access to two
free hours of calling a month.
Freeway will send you a card with
a PIN number in the mail, and
you just use it when making long
distance calls. The only catch?
For every two minutes of time
you anticipate talking, you have
to listen to one ten second com
mercial before the conversation
begins.
So what's the best service? It
depends. If you want to talk to
more than one person at a time,
get them all to join PhoneFreeor
Visitalk and use that service. If
you don't want to be a sales per
son and just want to talk to one
friend, get the newest version of
AOLim. If you like phones, use
Talk Free. If you like headsets,
but are calling someone who likes
phones, use Dialpad. Whatever
your preference, the option is
there. And it's free.
Back in the clays of 'yore, Jerry Yang and his crew
graduated from Stanford, invented ;i Weh browser and
decided to make it public access. First, it was free Web
browsers, then free e-mail and now free phone calls.
I he idea of free services on the Internet has pro
gressed to such a degree that if yon charge people for
using your service, you are going to sell as many copies
as Vanilla Ice did with his hard core rap album. Serious
ly, he had one — I saw it on "VIII Real Stories."
There are three different methods of free interactive
vocal communication available on the Internet : I'C-to-
PC (America Online Instant Messenger, Phone Free, vis
italk), PC-to-Phone (Dialpad), and Phone-to-Phone (I-
Link, Freeway).
Before you check out of any of the PC l-to-P(. or P( l-to
phone services, you should go to visitalk.com and get
your free headset (with swivel microphone attached).
Let's start by discussing PC-to-PC voice conversa

lions. Sa\ one user, bigMone\Salsa, decides to send a
message to another user, purple Hair. First, big-
Money Salsa lias to make sure purplel lair is in his (on
tatt List. 1 hen he clicks on purple Hair, says "establish
connection," and voila, they are connected.
Although they're free, I'C-to-PC. sen ices have their
faults. Most of these Internet services only allow you to
call people who have the same service. With some (i.e.
AOLim), you should not talk with anyone you don't
know because they can see vour computer's IP address
when vou connect.
1 he conversations through these sen - ices are often
echoed, muddled and noisy because most users don't
have good microphones. 1 he connection also has a ten
dency to delay speech.
Since AOLim has a large built-in user base from its
text-based chats, it is a good service to use for talking to
a friend or coworker. I here are some limitations on the
service, however. For example, you can only talk to one
friend at at ime — no teleconferencing.
PhoneFree's service, which is billed as bringing Iree

telephone calling to the people, is more sophisticated
than AOLim's voice communication function. Phone-
Free allow s teleconferencing, where up to 12 people can
be on the line at one time.
Obviouslv, all 12 would need to have the service
downloaded onto their computer. I'honeFree also pro
vides video conferencing if the user has his own video
camera and has a voice mail feature that is similar to the
voice message feature on ICQ. I'honeFree has a l'C-to
phone service similar to Dialpad's, but PhoneFree's ser
vice costs $29 a month.
Visitalk's service is very similar to PhoneFree's. The
biggest difference is that I'honeFree has a bigger follow
ing. Since both users have to share the same service to
communicate, the amount of people using a given ser
vice has a big impact on how useful the service is.
Dialpad and I-l .ink's Talk Free avoid the problem of
both users needing to be on tlie same service because
they route \<>m calls to telephones rather than to com-

puters. Neither of these services
rt'(|iiires a download. Dialpad is
the more widely used service
(currently the #1(H) website), but
Talk Free (currently I-Link is
#4871) is more appealing to the
traditional phone user. The
biggest negative for both services
is that they only have a certain
number of phone wires accessible
to them. II too many people are
using their service, you won't be
able to. Another huge negative is
that these services severely limit
your calling options. While PC
to-PC services allow you to call
from anywhere in the world to
anywhere else in the world. Dial
pad requires that calls are made
to the United States and Talk-
Kree requires that you call from
the United States and to the Unit
ed States.
So let's say bigMoneySalsa is
sitting at his desktop with his mi
crophone up and ready and
wants to call Money Shah at
home. So he opens up his Dial

pad account, and up pops the
Java Applet where he can enter
Mr. Shah's home number. After
typing it in or referencing it from
the address book, he waits for Mr.
Shah to pic k up his phone. Then
the\ have their conversation, and
then they go on their merry way.
This conversation may last longer
than usual because of time delay.
If bigMoneySalsa wants to call
Mr. Shah on I-I.ink, however, he
first goes to the i-link.net Web silo
and clicks on Talk Free. Then he
enters his own phone number
and Mr. Shah's phone number
and Talk Free calls them both.
Then, voila, they are having a
phone conversation. After much
effort, we have finally gotten big-
Money Salsa off the Internet. big-
Money Salsa is having a domestic
phone call for free. I-I.ink is one
of the few sites that actually has a
business plan. Talk Free is more
like shareware than a finished
product. They want you to use
Talk Free and be so astounded
that you decide to use their V-
Link long distance program,
which is actually cheaper than
regular long distance and has
more functionality. It's worth

checking out.
