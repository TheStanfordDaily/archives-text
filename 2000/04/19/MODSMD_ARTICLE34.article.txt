## 'Garage' sale Alum reflects on starting tech companies with a psych degree 
### CHRISTOPHER LYLE RAVI YANG SARIN CONTRIBUTING WRITERS 
Guy Kawasaki walked out of
Stanford with a degree in psy
chology in 197(i and no idea what
he wanted to do.
He decided to try Law School
at UC-Davis, a pursuit that only
lasted 10 days. After dropping
out, Kawasaki went to Hawaii to
work for the government.
"I never thought I'd be an au
thor, public speaker or fi-

nancier," said Kawasaki,
now CEO of a Palo Alto
startup, Garage.com.
Today, Kawasaki is all
of these.
His startup is boom
ing and quickly joining
the ranks of other suc
cessful companies.
Ciarage.com is a bttsi
ness-to-business market
place to finance early
stage startups. Kawasaki
says that Garage.com
"helps young companies
realize their dreams."
Entrepreneurs look
ing for capital and help
in getting their company
off the ground submit a
short summary of their
business to Garage.com
online.

Reviewers at Garage.com take
a quick glance at these summaries
and determine the next steps.
If they like the company, they
ask the entrepreneurs to submit a
n«mr«r<ietaiicd business plan.
Oiw a small percentage of the
uitfifcsuHrmssions reach this step.
IfGarage.com likes what they
see in the business plan, they set
up a formal meeting with the en
trepreneurs.

A select few of these companies
are then funded by Garage.com
or by the corporate investors,
venture capitalists and angel in
vestors who are part of the
Garage.com marketplace.
Garage.com also extends its
support to these early stage star
tups by helping with recruiting,
business development and mar
keting.
Even though Garage.com
helps startups, they, too, experi
enced the difficulties of starting a

company.
"We certainly had our share of
rejections when we were trying to
raise our first round of funding,"
Kawasaki said.
Kawasaki was working as the
chief evangelist at Apple Com
puter when he first got involved
with Garage.com.
After his time in Hawaii,
Kawasaki returned to California
and got his MBA at UCLA.
After this, Rich Karlgaard, the
editor of Forbes ASAP at the time
and current publisher of Forbes,
approached him with an idea for
an Internet startup.
The company was very differ
ent than it is now. Initially, it was
to be a content provider for

major economic centers of the
world such as Silicon Valley, New
York and London.
The team that approached
Kawasaki only consisted of two
people, Karlgaard and Geoff
Baum, both Stanford alumni and
employees at Forbes.
Kawasaki decided to leave
Apple, and the three then ap
proached Craig
Johnson, a Stanford Law
School alumnus and the founder
of Venture Law Group. Johnson
suggested that the company redi
rect its focus to become the mar
ketplace for financing that it is
today.
(iarage.com helps to democra
tize the funding process for star
tups.
Today, many venture capital
ists will only fund companies that
are personally referred to them
because they do not have the
manpower to look at all the sub
mitted business plans.
Garage.com, however, looks at
all of the business plans, and a re
ferral is not required, a fact that

might be useful to the growing
number of people involved in
starting companies.
"It seems like everyone now is
involved in a startup," Baum
said. "When 1 was at Stanford,
people were much

less involved in Sili
con Valley business.
So many students are
trying to get involved
in this economy."
One of the prob
lems that students
may face in starting a
business is develop
ing a full-time team.
Baum said that
an idea without a
dedicated manage
ment team is unlikely
to be funded.

Garage.com is cur
rently running a na

competition for ex-

actly this audience.
In Garage.coin s PLANedu, a
team of students can win up to
$ 150,000.
Kawasaki has some advice for
Stanford students based on his
own experience.
"It doesn't matter what you
think you're going to do. You're
probably not going to end up
doing it anyway. You don't need
to worry so much about your first
job."
Also, for students interested in
Silicon Valley, Kawasaki says that
one doesn't need to be an engi
neer to do business in the tech
nology sector.
Kawasaki himself admits he
has never taken a computer sci
ence class, despite working at
Apple and starting three technol
ogy companies.
