# Gravity Probe B to test Einstein's work
## 
### SALAS SARAIYA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Albert Einstein was a bright
man. He had poofy hair and good
ideas. But lie had his faults. 1 le had
no scissors, couldn't keep his first
marriage together and couldn't
prove his theories.
There are bright men working
on the Gravity Probe B experi
ment at Stanford. They can't give
Mr. Einstein a scissors, but they can
take a shot at proving (or disprov
ing) his theories.
The GPB aims to test Einstein's
theory of General Relativity by
sending gyroscopes into orbit. The
project was conceived forty years
ago by Stanford scientists William
M. Fairbank, Prof. Emeritus
Robert Cannon and Leonard
Sell iff. NASA has supported the
GPB project monetarily to some
degree since 1904.
I he GPB project at Stanford in
cludes mostly engineers and physi
cists. Around two hundred scien
tists take part in the project, most
of them at Stanford.
led Ac worth, a graduate stu
dent in mechanical engineering, is
the project manager for the .Artifi
cial Star 3 project, which, in re
sponse to the fiiil-

ure of the
Hubbell tele
scope, gives (lie
project's tele
scope a full end
to-end test be
fore it exits the
laboratory. He
says the most ex
citing part of the
project has been
working with the
twenty two stu
dents that make
up the AS3 pro-

gram in such fields as isystem op
tics, lasers, and mechatronics.
Fifty-nine doctoral disserta
tions, 20 master's degrees and six
undergraduate engineering de
grees at nine different universi
ties have resulted from the CiPB
project. The date of the GI'B
launch has been pushed back sev
eral times — at one point it was
scheduled to be launched in Oc
tober of this year; now the pro
jected date is April 2002 — but
when the launch finally takes
place, it will be a gravitationally
moving day for science.
Many of the project's setbacks
have been unforeseen. Just recent
ly, the launch date had to be
pushed back several months be
cause the windows that block the
heat from the dewer vessels (ther
mos-like vessels) were not ftmc

tioning properly. In two previous
satellites, the windows had not
been a problem.
No one is quite sure what the re
sults of the project will be. Physics
Prof. Francis Everitt, principal in
vestigator for the launch, said he
does not even want to venture a
hypothesis. It is his feeling that one
should not be biased when doing
something as important as evaluat
ing Einstein's theories. He does
say, however, that just as Newton's
gravitational theories have their
limitations, it is very possible that
Einstein's theory is limited for
some cases.
A condensed taste of Einstein
According to Newton's general
ly accepted laws of gravitation, the
gravitational force between two
objects is proportional to the mass
es of the objects divided by the
square of the distance between the
objects. Einstein added a corollary
to this theory, saying that a gravi
tational field alters the rules of
geometry in space-time, effective
ly giving a curved nature to the
space-time field.
Space-time can be considered a
fourth dimension, lime is a man-

made concept that is measured In
the passage of events. Without the
rising of the sun or the falling of
sands in an hourglass, there is no
time. Space is similar. Space is rela
tive to the recorder of information.
While Newton's laws of gravi
tation hold on earth, the galaxy
and outer space pose an interest
ing problem. Let's take two stars
that are millions of light years
apart.
According to Newton's laws of
gravitation, if one of the stars be
came an explosive supernova and
converted much of its mass intoen
ergv, the other star would instant
ly be repelled. But a question
posed bv hinstein was, how can the
star be instantly repelled if nothing
in the universe travels faster than
the speed of light?
Using the example on the

GPB's einstein.sianfbrd.edu web
site that symbolizes Kinstein's theo
ry, pretend tlie space-time dimen
sion is a fishing net and the earth
(or an)' gravitational field) is a bas
ketball. Ihe basketball creates a
bend in the fishing net, depending
on where it is placed and where it
moves. The space-time warp af
fects the* light and electromagnetic
fields that pass through it. While
ihe warp of the space-time as such
can not be measured, the warp of
the light and electromagnetic
fields can be.
How does the GPB plan to mea
sure the warp of the space-time di
mension? The GPB will send four
perfectly shaped gyroscopes into
orbit four hundred miles above the
earth's atmosphere, and take pre
cise measurements of the rotation
of the gyroscopes as they spin. The
measurements will determine
whether Kinstein's theory is cor
rect.
Gravity Probe spinoffs
TheGPB project has had many
obstacles that needed to be con
quered, which have led the physi
cists to specialize in different areas.
As a result of this specialization,
there have been many spin-offs to
the project. For example, the CiPB
uses ihe military's Global Position
ing System to make accurate mea
surements of the position of its gv
roscopes in space. The GPS re
search expanded too much for
GPB and was spun off into its own
group.
In 1995, a company called Inte
griNautics spun off from the GPS
research group, just recently,
Andy Barrows, a graduate student
in Aeronautics and Astronautics
who joined the CiPB program at
Stanford in 1993, spun off a new
companv from IntegriNautics.
Barrows' company, Nav3l),
builds systems that combine GPS,
3D computer graphics and user in
terfaces for moving objects.
The vision oft he Nav3D is to re
place the instrument panels found
in airplane cockpits with virtual re
ality displays that show what the
topology of the real world should
look like. With this technology, the
pilot will be able to see a "tunnel in
the skv" through which he should
land, even in bad weather.
The CiPB has also led to tech
nology that automates trac tors, im
proves bonding in optoelectronics,
precision optics, laser optics, laser
crystal augmentations, general op
tomechanical applications and cre
ation of optical system, and a tech
nology that can control the tem
perature of liquid helium.
