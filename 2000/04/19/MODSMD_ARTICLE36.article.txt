# Justifying the rewards of an engineer's education
## 
### 
First oft, let me just say that I hope
this column does not come oft as a
bunch of academic, high minded,
social dribble about myself and my limit
ed view of the world. My intent is to dis
cuss some thoughts that have been kic k
ing around inside my head fora while
about what I am going to do when I
graduate someday.
Oh, and I'm young and idealistic, so
here we go.
I am a co-terminal student in electri
cal engineering, and 1 have socialist ten
dencies. When I get out of school, there
will probably be a pretty fat c heck wait
ing for me every couple of weeks from
my employer. But 1 have to ask myself:
Why? Why do I deserve this check?
All throughout my life I have had
good parents who have encouraged me
to excel academically and have had
enough money to provide me with books
and opportunities. I could just as easily
have been born to someone with more
meager means and less emphasis on ed
ucation and have wound up mowing

lawns instead of here at this beautiful
school. Or I could have found myself in
an impoverished nation just trying to
survive.
When I think about my life this way, it
just doesn't seem very fair — it seems
lucky. If you know me, you know that I
work very hard to lake advantage of the
opportunities presented to me, so it is
not quite like all this has just fallen into
my lap. But regardless of how 1 got
where I am today, 1 live a very privileged
life.
So, knowing that I am one of the priv
ileged ones in this world, what have I
chosen to study in college? Engineering.
And electrical engineering at that. Why
not study medicine and be a doctor so I
can help those around me and give back
to the community I live in? I could even
focus on the health of the most needy
around us. How about going into social
work and trying to change some of the
unfair laws and social situations in this
country? Or I could become a teacher at
a public school and try to give less privi
leged students the same encouragement
I received growing up.
All these things have immediate im
pact on the lives of those around me and
are socially responsible ways to use the
privileged knowledge I have gained.

But the problem is, I don't want to do
these things. I really love EK and don't
think that 1 should sacrifice what I like to
do to become a social worker or even a
doctor (and the capitalist side of me
emerges again). Besides, I don't really
have the stomach for all the politics in
volved in some of these things. So the
question for me becomes this: How is
what I am going to do socially responsi
ble and mindful of the fact that I sit in the
privileged position of knowledge?
I could go to work building the next
top of the line lighter jet. Some c an make
convincing arguments that this is an im
portant task, but I don't want to have any
part of it. Or I could go to work lor a local
palm-organizer-type company. Every
one is goo-goo gaa-gaa over these gizmos
these days, but why are tliev important?
After thinking over the various op
tions fora while, I am leaning towards
going to go into the communications in
dustry: either optical communications or
wireless communications. I'm still sitting
on the fence and have a little while left
before 1 have to fall to one side or the
other.
So let me tell you why I think these
two areas fit my ideological constraints.
These two technologies have some of the
greatest potential to better people's lives

across the globe. Maybe not in our gen
eration, but eventually, no one on this
planet will have to live in ignorance of
the 1 est of the world if they choose not to.
Communication technologies will see
to this. Someday, there will be no part of
the world thai is unreachable b\ wireless
communication. Someday, you will be
able to call someone on the other side of
the world and not only hear their voice,
but see c lean, c risp video of their face as
well — all possible through the use of op
tical liber technology. Among other
things, these technologies will create a
generation of people who think of their
lives on a global scale and not so much in
selfish national 01 racial ways.
1 know I know, there are some of you
out there reading ibis that are saying, yes
Mike, some people will be able to benefit
from this technology, but some are just
too poor and will never benefit. And to
these people 1 say: "You are right.
Today." Even if both of these tec hnolo
gies were in place today, not everyone
across the face of the planet would be
able to use them.
Sooner or later, these kinds of tec h
nologies will become ubiquitous, and this
is a very good thing. Besides, this kind of
technology does not have to be an every
day part of every person's life in order to

lu- a good thing (although 1 think that
someday von will be hard pressed to find
someone whose life is not affected in
some fashion b\ communication tech
nology, even in the poorest places in the
world today). Access to information is
tearing down borders and opening
minds to new wa\s of thinking.
Being an engineer isn't about ( hang
ing an individual's life like a doctor
might. Nor is it about coming up with
some miraculous solution to all the
world's problems. However, as an engi
neer. I can work on projects that I see as
beneficial to more than just inv wallet.
I hese projects can have long term,
lasting effects on millions of people. As
an educated individual, I have a respon
sibility to handle this powei in a way that
can help those who will otherwise not
have as many chances as I did.
Future technologies have the poten
tial to bring access to knowledge and dif
ferent ways of thinking to everyone on
this planet. It would be exciting and at
the same time responsible to help devel
op these tec hnologies.
