## How do you feed a world full of hungry people? Scientists decode the rice genome, further implications to follow 
### KATHARINE MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
What's (lit* most important food staple in the
world? You guessed it: lice. So when Monsanto
Corporation announced last week that it had a
breakthrough in decoding I he l ice genome and will
share its data with researchers around the* world,
there was a murmur of excitement in the plant ge
netics world.
Although the decoding of rice is not complete,
Monsanto has prepared a "working draft" that,
when shared with other researchers, will greatly
speed up the final decoding.
Rice is tlie first major food crop to be decoded to
this level of detail. I he Monsanto announcement is
important for two reasons: (1) the importance of
rice as a food staple; and (2) the precedent set by a
private corporation sharing its genomic data.
Making better rice
According to Monsanto, the decoding of the rice
genome may enable i he accelerated development of
new, improved varieties of rice.
Over the last 35 years average rice yields have in
creased by 72 percent and total l ice production lias
doubled since 1966. This rale of improvement is im
pressive but has not been expected to keep up with
world population growth.
Recent population projections indicate that the
world needs about 758 million tons of l ice per year
by 2025 — or 70 percent more rice than is con
sumed today.
Mow much more increased rice production can
be anticipated based on (he rice genome informa
tion? According to Stanford plant geneticist Vir
ginia YValbot, this question cannot be answered.
"It is not obvious what can happen from here,"

says YValbot. The rice genome will, however, be
helpful to crop breeders who seek to increase pro
duction by c rossing various rice plants to try to pro
duce better varieties.
YViili the rice genome data available, breeders
will select plants for breeding based on genetic
markers dose to desirable genes. I his is far easier
than the traditional method of looking for desirable
plant trails in growing plants — traits that may or
may not reflect the desired cluster of genes.
Sharing genome information
Monsanto's announcement that it will share its
rice genome data with researchers around the
world lias been met with much applause from the
research community.
In a press release to the general public, a
spokesman for the International Rice Genome Se
quencing Project (IRGSP) stated that this is the first
lime a private enterprise will share a large volume
of genome information globally.
In 1997, I RGSP predicted that completing the
rice genome would take ten years and cost more
than U.S. $200 million. With the l ice genome se
quencing data shared by Monsanto, the IRGSP is
expected to achieve their goal much sooner at lower
cost.
"The use of this data by the international consor
tium [of rice genome sequencers] will significantly
accelerate decoding [of the entire lice genome],"
said the I R(iSP spokesman.
Monsanto states that it will charge no fees to sci
entists for the use of the rice genome data.
" This is a concrete example of our support for
global agricultural research," stated Monsanto's
President, Ifendrik Verfaillie.
Lest this sound overly generous, ii should be
noted that Monsanto does stand to benefit from the

sharing of its data: if researchers patent inventions
based on direct use of Monsanto's sequence data,
the company is given an early opportunity to nego
tiate non-exclusive licenses to such patents.
Monsanto will also benefit from the decoding of
the entire rice genome — which can best be clone
using a combination of Monsanto's working draft
and the work clone by the so-called 'public' genome
researchers — i.e., researchers funded by public
monies.

The two groups — public and private — have
tended to use different approaches to decoding.
Private researchers have often relied on what is
called the 'shotgun' approach — chopping up the
chromosomes into tiny bits, sequenc ing the order of
the four possible nucleotides (A,T,(I,C) in each
piece, and then using high-powered computers to
find the overlap between the segments — thereby
creating a map of the entire genome.
This approach is very successful, inexpensive
and fast, but it often leaves gaps where pieces of

DN'A were simply not seen or where pieces have
repetitive sequences whose overlap cannot be de
termined.
Public researchers have taken a different ap
proach: first building a backbone of larger segments
with known locations on the chromosome and
known overlaps with neighboring segments before
determining the sequence of nucleotides in each
segment.
The two approaches are complementary —they
each fill in the gaps in the other. The public re
searchers' genomic 'backbone' allows us to figure
out where to put the pieces that have been se
quenced by the private company's shotgun ap
proach.
The future of plant genomics
The genomes of corn, wheat, legumes, and other
crop plants are all being decoded by various re
searchers around the world. What are the costs?
What are the benefits?
As Virginia Walbot notes, "Plant genetic engi
neering is already 20 years old and has produced a
laughably small number of products."
The rice genome is costing us $200 million. How
many more species will we decode before we say:
that's enough?
Walbot's own research involves corn. She is in
volved in the Mai/e Gene Discovery Project, which
is perhaps the first genome project that is not trying
to decode the entire genome.
Instead, they are trying to sequence only the
genes—and omit the lengthy regions of DNA that
the plant never uses to produce proteins.
Walbot projects that the mai/e project will cost
only $() million. At this cost, 30 more plant genomes
could be decoded for the same price as the rice
genome. Will that be enough? Only time will tell.
