1 11 I his era of I lie I nternct, you can order gro
ceries, c lothing and even prescription drugs on
line and find tliein at your doorstep the next day.
Now von can add photo processing and sharing
to the list of online services.
cmetuories.com, ;i year-old Internet company
from Santa Monica, California, allows visitors to
its Wei) site to create online photo albums and
process film without leaving home.
1 he photo album feature lets you share pho
tographs with friends and family across the coim
tr\ without worrying about postage fees or dam
aged pictures — provided, of course, that those
photographs are already saved as files on your
computer.

After setting up an account with a screen name
and password on t he company Web site, you cre
ate a virtual photo album l>\ uploading picture
files from your computer to the Web site.
I hose files can come from a scanner, digital
camera or photo CI). If you lac k the necessary
equipment, you can still put pictures in your
photo album by sending the film to ememo
ries.com for processing.
Add .i title, description, background and cap
tions to your creation and you are finished. You
can c hoose from one of three privacy levels: pub
lic — allows all visitors to the site to view your pic
tures, private — allows only those whom you
have invited to view the album or private with
password — allows only those who type the cor
rect password to view the photos.
I he tec hnologic al know-how required to cre
ate an album is minimal, and the site takes users
through the process step-by-step. I here is no
FAQ or help page, however, for confused users.
When traffic is high, some pages can also take a
while to load or come up with error messages.

1 he appeal of the site seems to he mainly lor
those who want to create private albums for
friends to enjoy. 1 here is an open gallery, which
allows visitors to see albums that other users have
made public. I hese range 112 rom spring break pic -
tures to landscapes. Most are uninteresting; a few
are beautiltil.
For those who do not have access to a digital
camera or don't feel like heading to the drug
store lot photo processing, ememories.com
promises to develop pictures cheaply and make
them available to place in an online photo album.
Io use this service, customers can request a
postage-paid mailer online. When it arrives in
the mail, they |>ut their tolls of film (up to four)
in the envelope and mail it to the company's
headquarters to be processed.
l he pictures are then posted on the compa
ny's Web site, and users can access them with a
screen name and password. At this point, they
can transfer any of the pictures into a photo
album. I hey can also order prints of pictures
they like online and find tliein in their mailboxes
a few days later.
I he twist, as the company loudly proclaims on
its Web site, is that photo processing is free. Cus
tomers decide which prints they want only after
viewing the pictures on the Web and then pay
only fort hose pictures.
I lie prices, though not as c heap as the Web
site would have you believe, are reasonable, at
$0.99 plus postage for 24 prints ($.29/ print). For
those who routinely pick up packages of pictures
filled with under or overexposed photos, this ser
vice saves both money and frustration.
Everybody else c an probably depend on his oi
lier neighborhood Costco to process the film at
similar or lower rates and in less time.
For students with friends at schools across the
country, einetnories.com can be a good, c heap
way to share pictures of that significant other en
camping trip to Yosemite without having to wait
for the summer or sending dozens of e-mail at
tachments.
Without access to a digital camera or photo
CI), though, use of the service is pretty impracti
cal. A visit to the site is worthwhile for those who
already own the technology or who want to im
press their families with their technological
prowess. For others, next-day processing re
mains a viable option.
