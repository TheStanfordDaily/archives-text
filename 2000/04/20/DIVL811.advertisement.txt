WHAT PEOPLE WEREN'T
LOOKING FOR ON THE
FIRST EASTER.
Instead they vere looking for a body, a
corpse. The inan, Jesus of Nazareth, was
publicly beaten, whipped, tortured to death
by crucifixion, confirmed dead by a final sword
thrust, and securely buried three days earlier.
Not only that, but because of his notoriety, an
entire guard of Roman soldiers was guarding his
tomb, with an official Roman insignia on the two
ton boulder which sealed its entrance. This was a
special precaution because Jesus stated that after
his crucifixion, he would come back to life on the
third day.
On that day, the boulder was found up a
slope, away from the tomb. The guards had fled.
And inside the tomb, Jesus' body was not there.
But the cloths which had been mixed with gummy
spices and wrapped around his body were still in
the tomb, caved in like an empty cocoon. An
official report was circulated stating that Jesus'
disciples took the body while the guards slept.
The disciples, who had been in hiding fearing
for their lives, were now out and about claiming
that Jesus had risen from the dead—and had
even physically (not spiritually) appeared to
them on several occasions. Were the disciples
indeed hiding the body of Jesus? If so, then it's
hard to explain why each of them independently
traveled to other countries, eventually dying a
martyr's death. Who would give up their life for
what they knew was a lie?
Paul, who had been one of the most vicious
persecutors of the disciples and the early
Christians, later became convinced that Jesus'
resurrection was true. He was eventually
beheaded for his faith in Jesus. How important is
it if Jesus was raised from the dead or not? Paul
put it this way: "If Christ has not been raised, our
preaching is useless and so is your faith."
During his life, Jesus healed people of
diseases and disabilities and performed many
miracles to verify his deity. Then he offered the
biggest proof of all—he predicted that he would
be crucified and come back to life three days
later. That's why the Roman soldiers were
guarding the tomb. Simple, straightforward. It's
like saying, "You'll know if everything I've said to
you is true by this: I will come back to b'fe three
days after they crucify me."
By the end of the first century, nearly one
million Jews were followers of Jesus. Vhat
caused such an instant, explosive following? first.
Jesus' body was indeed missing. If anyone could
have produced the body, that would have put an
end to it. Second. Jesus must have lived an
amazing life to cause so many, so quickly after
his death, to worship him as the Messiah. Third,
as with the disciples, Jesus must have physically
appeared to many people, confirming to them the
reality of his resurrection, because individual
after individual willingly endured persecution.
This Easter, investigate the evidence yourself.
