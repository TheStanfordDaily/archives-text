### EILEEN CHAO STAFF WRITER 
By summarizing features and locations of
different houses and dorms, the ASSU Draw
Guide attempts to help students out in the
sometimes chaotic and confusing housing lot
tery.
"With close to (30 dorms in the Draw, it is im
possible to visit even dorm on campus," said
freshman Senate Associate Henry lowsner,
head designer of the Draw Guide. " I he Draw
Guide makes it very easy to narrow your inter
ests down to a few."
1 his year, the guide features information
such as pictures of every housing complex, rat
ings of facilities, food quality and draw statistics
showing the cut-off draw number students
needed to get in during previous years.
There are also several student comments on
each facility and a description of the general at
mosphere.
ASSU President Mike Levin, former Web
Projects Designer Patrick ( oilman and I)eputy
SenateGhair Ben 1 .in helped guide thee rcation
of this website. The students used many re
sources in gathering their information, accord
ing to Levin.
"Senate Associates look over 100 digital pic
tures for each of the nearly (">() residences in the
Draw," Irvin said.Towsner and I also met with
Roclgei Whitney from Facilities, and he met alone
with I odd Benson from I lousing Assignment
Services, to provide more accurate and compre
hensive data than had Ixvn offered before."

The Draw guide has not always been this
comprehensive. The draw guide was estab
lished for 1997-98 school year by then-Senator
Rita Leung when she realized students had no
idea about various housing options available to
them. Levin and Goffman improved the origi
nal site to form last year's guide.
" I'he guide included information for nearly
all of the residences in the 1 )raw, but it still wasn't
comprehensive enough," Levin said. "Also, we
weren't able to include pic tures of residences as
we wanted to."
Levin said that t his year's Web site is greatly
enhanced and has generated much student in
terest and positive feedback.
"I thought the pictures of each place was re
ally helpful," said freshman I)ave (iuilfoyle. "As
a freshman, 1 don't really know much about the
housing facilities so every bit of information was
useful."
I lowever, the guide could he improved fur
ther, according to sophomore Amit Prasad. In
many houses, only a small percent of its resi
dences responded to survey questions, there
lore skewing the overall results, according to
Prasad..
"I found the comments pretty detached
from reality," Prasad said. "I've seen a lot ol
comments contradictory to what my friends
w ho live there know |aboni the house]."
lowsner acknowledges this problem and
hopes it can be corrected in he future. Accord
ing to him, there is about one respondent for
every four visitors.
"It's a veiy short survey, and I would appre-

Despite this drawback, Towsner said he feels
the guide has been very successful.
"Almost 1,900 people have visited the Draw
Guide, close to half the total people in the
Draw," he said. "I hope that next year whoever
does the project comes in with a lot of ideas. I've
used up mine, but I'm sure there are plenty of
helpful things that could be added."
