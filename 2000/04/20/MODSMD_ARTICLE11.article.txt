### DEENA SKOLNICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last Wednesday, Provost John Hennessy an
nounced that the Stanford University Press is now
under the management control of University Li
brarian Michael Keller, part of a general restruc
turing of the Press.
"The idea was to assemble under me [the Press']
support and commitment to scholarship," Keller
said. "We're expanding the possibilities."
As a result of the restructuring, the current di
rector of the Press, Norris Pope, will return to his
position as editorial director of the Press' scholar
ly imprint after 10 years as general director.
Two new publishing lines will be added, one for
trade books and one for Internet and digital pub
lishing.
Additionally, the Press' scholarly publishing di
vision will expand into publishing books about
business, economy and technology.
"In effect, the approach of the press to its read
ership will be tripled," Keller said.
Keller is also the founder and publisher of
High Wire Press, an Internet publishing service.
High Wire produces the online editions of over
180 scientific journals.

Keller's connections to High Wire were impor
tant considerations in his appointment.
"The most important factor [in the change in
leadership] was the opportunity to take advantage
of some of the energies the Press has with Mike
Keller's appointment, and the opportunity for
electronic publishing," said Vice Provost for Bud
get and Auxiliaries Management Timothy Warn
er, who oversaw the Press before Keller.
Keller was chosen by the Press' Board of Gover
nors, which is chaired by Warner and draws its
members from Stanford faculty, University offi
cers and members of the outside community.
Warner said he does not predict that the change
will cause any problems with the Press.
"There will be a transition period to go
through, but I think it's a'positive transition peri
od, and we're all optimistic about the future," he
said.
According to Keller, "Publishing is a craft or an
art form or a business that moves fairly slowly. It's
not like a dot-com company . . . The full realiza
tion of these lines of business will be some years in
coming."
The Press is an auxiliary institution, which
means that it is financially independent from the
University.
The Press prints an average of 110 scholarly
books a year, the majority of which are by non-
Stanford authors.

publish.
