# Deadline looms for housing Draw
## 
### EILEEN CHAO STAFF WRITER 
As the deadline for the spring
housing Draw approaches, stu
dents are scrambling to figure
out which friends they want to
live with next year, which houses
they prefer and which area of
campus they want to reside in
next year.
This year's Draw deadline is
Sunday, May 7 at 1 1:59 p.m., al
though Housing and Dining Ser
vices officials encourage students
to apply earlier because Axess
tends to become overwhelmed
on the day of the deadline. The
deadline for students to apply in
groups is Sunday, April 30.
Housing Assignment Services
Manager Todd Benson under
scored the importance of adher
ing to the deadlines. If students
miss the deadline, they run the
risk of not being housed the fol
lowing year because housing as
signments will first be assigned to
everyone who has applied on
time.

"Students who submit their
housing applications late receive
a very high draw number—even
higher than students who were
applying unguaranteed, but who
submitted their application by
the deadline," Benson said.
"We will try to Ik mse those stu
dents in the waitlist and walk-in
rounds if we can, but our ability
to do so depends on the total
housing demand — so it is possi
ble a student who submitted their
application late would not be
housed,"
According to Benson, stu
dents who follow the deadline are
willing to live anywhere on cam
pus and have a guaranteed year
remaining will always be assigned
an undergraduate house, con
trary to some rumors.
"No students are assigned to
graduate housing, or to the cot
tages outside Yost in the
Draw," Benson said. "The only
possible time that such an as
signment would be made
would he in the housing walk
ins t hat occui at i lie beginning of
every quarter."
Benson said the only time un
dci graduate students would be
put in graduate housing is "in the
unlikel\ event that at the time ol
walk-ins, there are more students
with a guaranteed yeat remaining
than there are undergraduate
spaces available."'

However, be emphasized that
this is only in emergency situations
and is very unlikely.
Students who live off campus
this year but want to move back on
campus will have to go through
the* same process as everyone else
in the Draw. I he) w ill enter the
Draw and receive a Draw number
based on whether or not they are
using a preferred year.
"This won't necessarily take
away spaces for incoming students
any more than an application from
a student living on-campus
would," Benson said.
