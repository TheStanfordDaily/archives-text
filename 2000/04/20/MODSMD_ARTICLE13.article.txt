## Russian parliament ratifies START II 
### 
MOSCOW (Al>) — The Rus
sian parliament finished ratify
ing the START II nuclear arms
reduction treaty with approval
by the upper house yesterday,
giving President Vladimir Putin
a significant foreign policy
achievement less than a month
after his election.
The ratification comes after a
seven-year period when the
treaty, which would halve both
U.S. and Russian warhead stock
piles, languished in the Russian
legislature.
New amendments to START
II still must be approved by the
U.S Senate before it takes effect,
but Russian ratification sets the
stage for talks on further arms
cuts. The U.S. and Russia have
begun discussing a possible
START 111 treaty, and Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov is
to leave for the United States this
weekend for meetings on arms
control issues.
I'titin pushed strongly for rat
ification, and the lower house,
the State Duma, approved the
treaty last Friday. Approval is
likely to boost Moscow's ties with
Washington, which have been
strained by Chechnya and other
disputes.
It may also soften the image
of Rutin, whose call to restore
Russia as a great power has
alarmed some Western officials.
Communists and their allies
in the lower house had blocked
the treaty for years, saying its
terms of halving each side's
nuclear arsenals to 3,000-3,500
warheads would deal a big blow
to Russia's strategic strength at a

time when its conventional
forces are underfunded.
But the Communists lost
their dominance of the Duma in
last December's election and
were unable to muster enough
votes to continue blocking the
treaty. The Federation Council,
which generally respects the
government's wishes, quickly
followed suit. It approved the
treaty by a 122-15 vote.
"We call on other countries to
join us in reducing weapons
arsenals," Federation Council
Speaker Yegor Stroyev said dur
ing the session yesterday.
START II was ratified in the
U.S. Senate in 1996, but Russia
and the United States later
worked out amendments that
include extending the time for
Russia to meet the reduction tar
gets to 2007.
The Senate must now
approve those amendments.
But some U.S. analysts have
said putting the amendments up
for approval could raise the pos
sibility of conservative U.S. sena
tors trying to scuttle another
U.S.-Russian pact that has
caused tension of late: the Anti-
Ballistic Missile treaty.
The United States wants to
amend the treat) to allow con
struction of a limited missile
defense system.
Russia objects, saying that
would make its own forces inef
fective and trigger a new arms
race.
Washington insists the system
would not be able to counter a
major attack and does not pose
a threat to Russia.
