VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP)
— A year after David Sanes
Rodriguez was killed by stray
bombs from a U.S. warplane,
mourners yesterday laid flowers
at his grave and demanded the
Navy's eviction from a live-fire
range on this Puerto Rican island.
Fists raised, do/ens of people
shouted: "Out with the Navy!
Long live a free Vieques!"
Sanes, a security guard, was
killed on April 19, 1999, when
two 500-pound bombs dropped
by a Marine Corps F-14 missed
their target on the Vieques island
live-fire range.
Elsewhere in Puerto Rico,
protesters held vigils and church
services.
About 25 activists, who on
Tuesday occupied San Juan's
16th-century Fort Sail Felipe del
Mono, a U.S. national historic
site, left peacefully yesterday after
taking down an American flag
and leaving a Puerto Rican flag at
half staff. There were no arrests.
lu Washington, protesters
urged President Clinton to close
the range permanently.
Sanes' death was also remem
bered with a church service and a
minute of silence at Roosevelt
Roads, the sprawling U.S. Naval
Station in Puerto Rico which
administers the Vieques range. At
noon, all vehicles and all ships in
the harbor came to a stop, the
airstrip was closed and the base
c hapel bells tolled.
Sanes "died while serving in
the defense of our nation and we
honored him with an appropriate
ceremony," said Navy spokesman
l.t. Jeff Gordon.
The Navy suspended its exer
cises on Vieques after Sanes'
death. Protesters occupied the
range and set lip five camps amid
beaches and scrubby hills littered
with unexploded bombs and

craters.
l he militants have refused to
leave despite an agreement
between Clinton and Puerto
Rican Gov. Pedro Rossello to
allow the Navy to resume exercis
es using inert ammunition for
three months of the year, com
pared to six months before Sanes'
death.
Under the agreement,
Vieques' residents will decide in a
referendum whether the Navy
can resume live fire training or
abandon the island.
"The history of Vieques is
going to change because of
David," ex-Mayor Radames I ira
do said. "In our sorrow, we can
be happy because his death has
given us a year of peace."
I'he Navy warns that without
Vieques — used to prepare for
every U.S. military conflict since
World War II — lives could be
lost in today's world of precision
bombing.
l he island off Puerto Rico's
eastern tip is the only place where
tlie Atlantic Fleet can hold simul
taneous air, land and sea opera
tions with live munitions.
Islanders charge that decades
of bombing have led to a high
cancer rate among Vieques' 9,300
residents — a charge the Navy
says hasn't been proven. Bomb
ing has stunted tourism,
destroyed fishing grounds, coral
reefs and mangroves, and
harmed endangered species such
as the peregrine falcon and
hawksbill turtle, residents say.
Protesters also say the Navy
has used Vieques in a way that
would not be unacceptable else
where in the United States
because Puerto Rico is a Spanish
speaking U.S. territory.
"This is definitely a case of
environmental racism," said
activist Roberto Rabin.
