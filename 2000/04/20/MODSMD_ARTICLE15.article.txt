PARIS (AP) â€” St it'inists have
cracked one of France's most
enduring mysteries, saying an ail
ing boy who died in a Paris prison
more than 200 years ago was the
son of King Louis XVI and
Marie-Antoinette and heir to the
French throne.
lhe fate of Louis XVFs 10-
year-old son had long intrigued
France. Some historians declared
the dead hoy to be Louis XVII;
others said the royal heir escaped
and another child died in his
place to save official face during
the unstable days of the French
Revolution.
Hnt now science has come to
the aid of history.
Scientists from two European
universities compared DNA from

the long-preserved heart of the
dead bov to DNA from hair cut
from Marie-Antoinette when she
was a child in Austria. They also
compared the heart DNA to DNA
from Marie Antoinette's sisters
,ind two living members of the
Bourbon family.
Philippe Delorine, the French
historian who organized the tests,
said they laid the riddle to rest at
last.
"It was Louis XVII. It was the
last little king of France who died
in the Temple prison," Delorine
said. "It's definitive."
Flie official version of the story
has long gone like this: After his
parents were beheaded in 1793,
Louis XVII was imprisoned in
the Temple, a fortified monastery

in Paris, where he died of tuber
culosis at age 10 on June 8, 1795.
But until now, that version was
contradicted by rumor, legend
and simple royalist hope,
strengthened by some fabulous
tales from that turbulent time.
Some said the body in the
Temple could not have been
Louis XVII as it seemed to belong
to an older child. Others claimed
Louis XVII had been drugged
with opium and a dead boy sub
stituted for the living one in the
coffin.
One guard at the time said he
had seen many bathtubs being
carried out of the prison.
When the porters carrying one
stumbled, he heard a c hild's cry
from within, he said.
