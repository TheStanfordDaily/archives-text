MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — Bobbi YVhitacre and
Sandi Cote are already making plans for a small cer
emony sanctifying their 33-year relationship. Ihe
women are just disappointed they won't be consid
ered "married."
A hill that passed the Vermont Senate yesterday
gets as close to gay marriage as any place in Ameri
ca, but it still reserves "marriage" for opposite-sex
couples.
"It's a bittersweet victory, I think, lor a lot <>l us.
Cote said. "To have to stop short ol the goal, it's dis
appointing."
On a 19-11 vote, the Senate passed a bill d ealing
"civil unions," a legal structure parallel to marriage
for gay and lesbian couples.
The landmark proposal would grant to same-sex
couples some 300 state benefits of marriage, inc hid
ing medical decision-making, tax breaks and inheri
tance. No other state has conferred more than jusi a
handful of the benefits.

"It's great that ii passed, said Beth Robinson,
one of the law vers who sue i essfiilK argued before
the Vermont Supreme Court that ga\ and lesbian
couples were being unconstitutionalh denied the
benelits of marriage.
I he court lefi the decision to the I .egislature how
to provide those l ights. I he House voted 70-(H) in
March to provide civil unions.
Ihe Senate laigeh agreed with the Houses
approach to the issue, but c hanged some ol the lan
guage in the bill and also moved up the efleclive
date h\ two months lo |ul\ I.
Now the I louse will have to \ole on whethei to
accept the Senate's changes. I louse Speakei Michael
Obuchowski said he did not believe anvone would
back oil fi'om his or her original vote.
(iov. I toward Dean lias promised to sign the bill.
"Ii has not been an eas\ journey," said Senate
