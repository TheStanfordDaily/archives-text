# Montreal police charge boy with hacking

### 
MONTREAL (AP) — A 15-year-old boy
working under the computer name Mafi
aboy has been charged with two counts of
mischief for disabling the (INN Internet site
for four hours, police said yesterday.
I he Feb. 8 attack was one of several on
major international Web sites in recent
months that highlighted the security risks of
the high-tech age.
The young suspect — arrested Saturday
in a joint investigation with the FBI —
boasted in Internet chat rooms frequented
by hackers that he was responsible for a
number of the attacks, Inspector Yves Rous
sel of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
said. But despite his on-line boasts, he so far
has only been charged in the attack on
CNN.
fhe boy's name cannot be disclosed
under Canadian law. As a youth offender,
he could be sentenced to up to two years in
prison if convicted. Roussel said the joint
investigation continues and more arrests are
possible.
Cyber-attac ks in February against CNN.

Yahoo!, eßay, Amazon.com, ETrade and
other major Web sites inconvenienced mil
lions of Internet users. Called "denial of ser
vice," the attacks involved flooding a site
with so much traffic that legitimate cus
tomers were unable to get through.
The ease and extent of the attacks, which
effectively shut down major Web sites for
hours at a time, generated new business for
many Internet security firms. Internet sites
that believed their operations were already
secure found themselves helpless against the
flood of attacks.
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno
praised the joint U.S.-Canadian investiga
tion that led to the arrest and called it a sig
nal for hackers to beware.
"1 believe this recent breakthrough
demonstrates our capacity to . . . track
them down wherever they may be," Reno
said.
Industry leaders, however, said the arrest
would do little to erase security fears. Vul
nerabilities will remain until all members of
the Internet community take responsibility

for securing their own gateways to the Inter
net, said William L. Schrader, chairman and
chief executive of Internet access company
PSINet.
"I don't think the FBI can ever control all
the doors to the Internet," Schrader said.
Jed Pickel, technical coordinator at the
U.S. Defense Department-funded CERT
Coordination Center at Carnegie Mellon
University, noted that hackers can look on
the Internet itself to find the sophisticated
"tools" needed to launch cyber-attac ks.
"It really doesn't take anyone with a com
puter science degree to launch a sophistic at
ed attack," he said.
Mafiaboy's attack on CNN also affected
hundreds of other sites hosted by the CNN
site, police said.
Chris Painter, deputy chief of the U.S.
Justice Department's computer crime sec
tion, said the FBI and RCMP found Mafi
aboy using a combination of traditional and
cyber investigative techniques. An RCMP
investigator said the boy was tracked through
traces he left of his computer ac tivity.
