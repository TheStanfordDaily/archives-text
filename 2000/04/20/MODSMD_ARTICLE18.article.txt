In the case ol the I laas director, Vice Provost for

Students cannot l)c left out of the process that decides
who will lead them and their student groups, in a
veiy direct and interactive way, in the coming years
— at least not solely on the basis of maintaining past
policy constraints that are questionable at Ix-st.
1 lowever, Montoya, in defending his choices and
his own commitment to student voice, said, "My
choice was to select the ASSU-Nom-Com-appointed
representative to the Haas faculty steering commit
tee, recognizing she had l)een appointed to that posi
tion previously by Nom Com ... My second choice
was the choice of the I laas Unifying Board, [which] is
the official student voice within the Haas Center."
I hough many would argue that this rationale was
,i sound one, students like Tim Ly, a student heavily
involved with the I laas Center, would disagree. "You
can't really say you have student representation on
any committee without any democratic mechanism
lor ( boosing the students who sit on a search (om

niittee," said Ly, bitting on the crux ol the matter.
Simply having students on the search committee
does not equal student representation, particularly
when discussing a position with si k I i great bearing on
students' daily lives and ability to act upon their con
cerns. I here must bean established process, rooted
in the recommendations ol students — as Nom ( oin
is — for appointing student committee members and
ensuring true student representation.
These issues come at an important time, with the
University in the process ol forming a Provost search
committee. In evaluating the necessit\ and/or choices
of student representatives on that committee, the
University should consider careliilly whether stu
dents will actual!) feel represented in the decision
process and, il not, how best to change that. We
alreach have a mechanism in place to ensure student
representation — namely, Nom Coin — we simply
have to solidifv its role and use ii consistently.
