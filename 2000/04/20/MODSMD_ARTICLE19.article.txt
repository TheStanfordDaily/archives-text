# THERE IS NO SPOON
## Grad student legends 
### 
Sitting ai Moonbeams tlx- other
day, I rail into an old friend wlio
happens to be a math grad stu
dent. (And yes, he's actually quite
normal.) What with taxes, pro Iros,
upcoming midterms and the encroach
ing real world, 1 expressed a great desire
to well . . . er . . . hit something.
That's when he told me the I .egcncl ol
the Ball-Been Hammer Murder. Now,
I've heard lots ol collegiate urban leg-

ends before: hook m
the car door, frosh gets
straight As when
roommate dies, party
animal wakes up to
find blood s( rawlecl on
her wall. But I'd never
heard this one.
I'he story goes like
this: 011 one late spring
quartet afternoon

about 20 vears ago, a
very disgruntled grad student in was
linking in the Mathematics Department.
Upset over Ins inability to push Ins thesis
through .ind to protest how Stanford
treats students, he walked into .1 profes
sor's office and killed him with a hall
peen hammer.
He later tried to ac<|iiit himself in
court with the Ricc-a-roni Defense (pre
sumably, .1 variation ol the Iwinkie
Defense in the llarvey Milk murder).
And lie said that the professor had
made fun of his shoes. He got some jail
time, refused psychiatric services 111
prison and was paroled some time ago.
I o this day, according to in\ In.ltlt insid
er, the secretaries of the math depart
ment have his picture on .1 wall to iden
tify him il he cvei conies In again. And
my math li iend thinks lie now works lor
BAR I (which actualh does make some
sense.)
Ap| )arently, the murclerei had been .1
19-year graduate student who just
couldn't get his thesis approved. Having
taken a bit longet than the prescribed
four years to complete tin own under
graduate degree here (let's |ust call it the
scenic route), I have a sin,ill bit ol empa
thy for his frustration. Not that I'm belit
tling 01 condoning a murder, but I've
taken Math at Stanford. And I can
understand being angr\ at the Math
Department.
It's most interesting that this guy was
killing .1 professor to protest how Stan
lord treats its students. (And the Nation
al Guard thought that the IMF
protestors were getting out of hand.) I'm
sure we all have complaints about how
Stanford treats students, but to use it as a
justification lot murder?
Maybe there's some big grad student

threat on campus that we undergrads
don't realize. Maybe that's how they
stored Schwab — did you know that

extended Marguerite stops. What if the
administration is really held in (heck by
threats of graduate student violence?
("C'inon, guys, if we don't give the grad
students extra housing, they'll firebomb
()ld Union!").
Now bcloic I get deluged with angry
letters from grad students, let me jnsi sav

realized the hidden danger of grad
school violence. At least that's what I II be
telling my parents.
