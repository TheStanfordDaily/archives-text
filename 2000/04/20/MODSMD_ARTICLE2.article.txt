Many students on campus
complain that the Stanford Shop
ping Center, which houses the
latter stores, does not cater to stu

Rosemary McAndrews, director
of the shopping center from the
late l ( .)7()s to the early 19905, this
is not the main goal of the shop
ping center.
"If it is going to he a successful
shopping center, they can't have
students as first on their list, he
cause they would go broke,"
McAndrews said.
The shopping center was
opened in 1950 and was created
in order to help financially main

number of students during
World War II and die high taxes

land that was not in use con

"The income stream from the
shopping (enter goes entirely
into the University's general fund
totally unrestricted funds. I his
way they could raise salaries lor
professors and provide things for
the students that they would oth
erwise not he able to do," she
added.
At its opening, the shopping
center had 4'i small shops, includ
ing "mom-and-pop" stores, and
two large department stores. At
one point in time, YVoolworth's
was located in the shopping center
and there was also a hardware
store.
Under McAndrews's direction,
the shopping center conducted
demographic studies to match
their merchandise to the market.
As the population in the sur
rounding area became more

wealthy, different stores were
brought in to catei to this popula
tion.
"Students were included in
these demographic studies, but in
an area of about a million people,
the students were a very small
component," Mc Andrews said.
"While the shopping center
does not cater to students, it does
help to finance their education
and I think that's more impor
tant," she added.
Bill Phillips, managing director
of real estate lor the Stanford
Management Company, said, "I
think the linkage with the I Diver
sity is one ol really just having a
very strong investment which also
serves the community in a very
positive and strong way."
Despite the benefits that the
shopping center brings to the I Hi
versity, students have expressed
concerns about it. Main students
complain about the kinds ol stores
in the shopping center.
Senior Dan Francis said, "1
can't buy a single thing iu that
place. It's overpriced and not

aimed at college students."
Randy I ish. a senior, said, "I
would rather drive 20 miles to a
different mall than to try to find
parking and walk around the
Stanford Shopping Center. And,
the two stores that I actually like,
Nordstrom and The Sharper
Image, are so far apart that it isn't
worth it."
In addition to concerns about
prices, some students feel that
they are not made to feel welcome
by the stores and their salespeo
ple.
Senior Drew Arballo said he
conduc ted a personal experiment
with ;i friend at the shopping ( en
ter to explore the friendliness of
the salespeople at Pottery Barn.
I lis friend was dressed in formal
clothing and Arballo was more in
formally dressed.
After the two students entered
the store, Arballo said his friend
was greeted with a friendly and
helpful attitude.
"When I walked in, nobody
spoke to me, and when I had a
question, all the salesperson said

was, 'It's over there' and he point
ed to what I had asked for," Ar
ballo said.
Ethan Mannick, a sales associ
ate at bebe, a women's clothing
store, said that he has heard stu
dents say, "We don't like coming
to the mall because the clothes
don't cater to students."
But, Mannick said that he has
not heard those kinds of com
plaints about his own store, which
lie attributed to bebe's personable
staff and because, "()ur clothing is
geared towards a younger crowd."
"I would say that at least !i() per
cent of our customers are affiliated
with the University and are stu
dents for the most part," Mannick
said.
"This mall is in a great location
and it has an appeal to it than no
other mall has," he added.
During her time as director,
Mc Andrews said she was aware of
the concerns of students: "I think
that is natural for students to com

Bloomingdale's is one of the many stores at the Stanford Shopping Center that is out of the price range of most
students; officials admit, however, that students are not the mall's target customers.
quilt' a selling job to do with the
trustees," she said.
"The income stream from the
shopping (enter goes entirely
into the University's general fund
totally unrestricted funds. I his
way they could raise salaries lor
professors and provide things for
the students that they would oth
erwise not he able to do," she
added.
At its opening, the shopping
center had 4'i small shops, includ
ing "mom-and-pop" stores, and
two large department stores. At
one point in time, YVoolworth's
was located in the shopping center
and there was also a hardware
store.
Under McAndrews's direction,
the shopping center conducted
demographic studies to match
their merchandise to the market.
As the population in the sur
rounding area became more

wealthy, different stores were
brought in to catei to this popula
tion.
"Students were included in
these demographic studies, but in
an area of about a million people,
the students were a very small
component," Mc Andrews said.
"While the shopping center
does not cater to students, it does
help to finance their education
and I think that's more impor
tant," she added.
Bill Phillips, managing director
of real estate lor the Stanford
Management Company, said, "I
think the linkage with the I Diver
sity is one ol really just having a
very strong investment which also
serves the community in a very
positive and strong way."
Despite the benefits that the
shopping center brings to the I Hi
versity, students have expressed
concerns about it. Main students
complain about the kinds ol stores
in the shopping center.
Senior Dan Francis said, "1
can't buy a single thing iu that
place. It's overpriced and not

aimed at college students."
Randy I ish. a senior, said, "I
would rather drive 20 miles to a
different mall than to try to find
parking and walk around the
Stanford Shopping Center. And,
the two stores that I actually like,
Nordstrom and The Sharper
Image, are so far apart that it isn't
worth it."
In addition to concerns about
prices, some students feel that
they are not made to feel welcome
by the stores and their salespeo
ple.
Senior Drew Arballo said he
conduc ted a personal experiment
with ;i friend at the shopping ( en
ter to explore the friendliness of
the salespeople at Pottery Barn.
I lis friend was dressed in formal
clothing and Arballo was more in
formally dressed.
After the two students entered
the store, Arballo said his friend
was greeted with a friendly and
helpful attitude.
"When I walked in, nobody
spoke to me, and when I had a
question, all the salesperson said

was, 'It's over there' and he point
ed to what I had asked for," Ar
ballo said.
Ethan Mannick, a sales associ
ate at bebe, a women's clothing
store, said that he has heard stu
dents say, "We don't like coming
to the mall because the clothes
don't cater to students."
But, Mannick said that he has
not heard those kinds of com
plaints about his own store, which
lie attributed to bebe's personable
staff and because, "()ur clothing is
geared towards a younger crowd."
"I would say that at least !i() per
cent of our customers are affiliated
with the University and are stu
dents for the most part," Mannick
said.
"This mall is in a great location
and it has an appeal to it than no
other mall has," he added.
During her time as director,
Mc Andrews said she was aware of
the concerns of students: "I think
that is natural for students to com
plain. If they know that it is owned
by the University, they wonder
why it isn't catering to them."
