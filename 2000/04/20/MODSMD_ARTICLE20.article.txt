# MODERN LIFE IS RUBBISH
## America's new political activism 
### 
Ah, these kids today. I hey can't
even do political activism right.
I hey listen to Rage Against the
Machine instead of John
Lcnnon, read Judith Butler instead of
Noam Chomsky, take Fcstasy instead of
I .SI). Don't they understand there's a wa\
these things are supposed to be done?
At least, that's the situation according
to Vladimir Budney, a grizzled protester
from the I9()0s who was in Washington,
D.C. on Sunday, holding a one-man
counter-demonstration against a throng
of younger activists protesting the IMF
and World Bank. "This is not a demon
stration," he said. "This is a roc k concert
held at the expense of the local popula
tion .... it has a bunch of kids like this
walking around, having fun with each
oilier, shouting, screaming."
Budney, w ho in bygone clays protested
tin civil rights and against Spanish fas-

Cis in, carried a sign
demanding that
protesters stop the
"anarchy" and lectured
them on how his gener
ation did things. "You
get a bunch of peo pie
together,' he savs, "and
you influence a mem
ber of Congress, and

you get a bill introduced."
One protester angrily responded
" That's liberalism!" turning the discus
sion into the kind of vague semantic quib
ble that Chomsky would doubtless find
entertaining. Another tried to set Bud
tiey's sign on fire.
You can't help wondering what Bud
ney hoped to accomplish in trying to set
guidelines for something as anarchic as a
political demonstration. For better or
worse, the freak flag has been passed to a

new generation; in>w it's up to I lie college
kids to storm the capital, wave signs and
wear rubber clown noses.
I his last item was sported In a young
man who explained "I wanted to commu
nicate the message 'Who are these clowns
running the world?'" It's political protest,
(ien \ style; even il the slacker generation
is more jaded about saving the world than
its 1960s counterpart, you can at least
count on tliein to be ironic about it.
After all, student protest could be a lot
worse, lake Guatemala, where the com
ing of faster is marked by public beat
ings. In recent years the traditional Muel
ga de Dolores parade has taken a violent
turn, as students don red and black exe
cutioner's hoods and find men suspected
of crimes. I lie putative criminals are
stripped to their underwear and
