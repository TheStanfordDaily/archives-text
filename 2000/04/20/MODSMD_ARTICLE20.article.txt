# MODERN LIFE IS RUBBISH
## America's new political activism 
### 
Ah, these kids today. I hey can't
even do political activism right.
I hey listen to Rage Against the
Machine instead of John
Lcnnon, read Judith Butler instead of
Noam Chomsky, take Fcstasy instead of
I .SI). Don't they understand there's a wa\
these things are supposed to be done?
At least, that's the situation according
to Vladimir Budney, a grizzled protester
from the I9()0s who was in Washington,
D.C. on Sunday, holding a one-man
counter-demonstration against a throng
of younger activists protesting the IMF
and World Bank. "This is not a demon
stration," he said. "This is a roc k concert
held at the expense of the local popula
tion .... it has a bunch of kids like this
walking around, having fun with each
oilier, shouting, screaming."
Budney, w ho in bygone clays protested
tin civil rights and against Spanish fas-

Cis in, carried a sign
demanding that
protesters stop the
"anarchy" and lectured
them on how his gener
ation did things. "You
get a bunch of peo pie
together,' he savs, "and
you influence a mem
ber of Congress, and

you get a bill introduced."
One protester angrily responded
" That's liberalism!" turning the discus
sion into the kind of vague semantic quib
ble that Chomsky would doubtless find
entertaining. Another tried to set Bud
tiey's sign on fire.
You can't help wondering what Bud
ney hoped to accomplish in trying to set
guidelines for something as anarchic as a
political demonstration. For better or
worse, the freak flag has been passed to a

new generation; in>w it's up to I lie college
kids to storm the capital, wave signs and
wear rubber clown noses.
I his last item was sported In a young
man who explained "I wanted to commu
nicate the message 'Who are these clowns
running the world?'" It's political protest,
(ien \ style; even il the slacker generation
is more jaded about saving the world than
its 1960s counterpart, you can at least
count on tliein to be ironic about it.
After all, student protest could be a lot
worse, lake Guatemala, where the com
ing of faster is marked by public beat
ings. In recent years the traditional Muel
ga de Dolores parade has taken a violent
turn, as students don red and black exe
cutioner's hoods and find men suspected
of crimes. I lie putative criminals are
stripped to their underwear and

inarched through crowded streets, then pum
meled as the onlookers c heer.
"They steal your purse," one local enthusi
astically explained, "they rob you — then they
get beaten until they bleed." I he official stance
is to look the other way; the University of San
Carlos explains that it is not their place to
interfere with tradition and not one beating
has been prosecuted. The only people cur
rently documenting the incidents are
Guatemala's tabloid newspapers, who mark
Faster week by sending out photographers to
camp downtown on "beating watch."
American students have enough time on their
hands to think global; their Guatemalan coun
terparts, frustrated with crime, opt to act local.
For our current generation of angi» young men
and womyn, this does raise questions about how
best to go about lighting 1 lie Man.
We're understandably disinclined to go
about protests in a sober Vladimir Budney
style, but also too well-bred to strip World
Bank leaders clown to their Calvin Kleins and
flog them on the Washington Mall. The mid

die ground, at Stanford anyway, seems mostly
to involve setting up l\\ systems in White l'la/.a
and putting up flyers in campus bathrooms.
Many people dismiss this as self-const ions
posturing, the logic being: how angry can you
really be when vour patents are forking over
$120,000 fi>r vour education? It's a criticism to
take note of, and one that inevitably damages
grassroots credibility at this and similar institu
tions. KspecialK from the outside, activism
here can look a lot like a rich kid's hobby.
Still, one can't deny that our activis do
believe in what they're doing, (.ranted, most
of the erstwhile I l .)(i0s radicals have since taken
jobs in insurance and accounting, and there's
110 reason to expect our generation will turn
out dillerently — especially as we're smack in
the middle ol the most rampantly capitalistic
part of the country.
But then there are the few Vladimir llud
nevs ol the world, the ones who never quite
gave up. I'.veil il the) seem hopelessly
anachronistic, at least they're still tr\ing. And il
the rest of us are doomed to eventual!) join
the establishment, it's not a bad reason to cele
brate our angr\ young years while thev last.
