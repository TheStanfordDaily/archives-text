BonaFide responds
I'liree months ago, four members of
the (dass of 2001 began to meet with a
common goal of working towards a
senior year that would provide diverse
representation of the interests and goals
of our class. To this end, BonaFide
sought to locus our eflbrts into these lour
c ategories: social, c areer, service and ac a
demic. While we're all down lor Pub
Night, the Tub Crawl and an infamous
Senior Formal, we realize that there are
other members within the class who
desire more.
In response to our opponents' criti
c isms regarding a budget, please allow us
to explain. In discussions with the same
contacts that Satisfaction Cuaranteed has
a relationship with, it was made clear to
us thai a budget for the senior year is not
developed until August, given the
tremendous amount time it takes to plan
and allocate the funds. In a slate that con
tains the director of the Stanford Direc to
ry, a founding father of AKl'si â€” the first
Stanford business fraternity â€” and a
recruiter lor a local startup, we feel confi
dent we can deliver the funds to pay for
events such as Tub Night, thus using the
saved funds to defray the costs of the
Senior Formal.
Satisfaction Cuaranteed wrote yester
day that only educational events may be
sponsored. 'This is untrue. The current
senior c lass has used sponsorship to offset
the cost of different pub nights, and we
will clothe same. We are well aware that
last year's Senior Formal cost $'16,000,

and this year's tickets are $40. But,
through our connections, we have
already begun to secure funding and will
continue to this summer as three mem
bers of BonaFide will be in the area. Also,
in the hope of getting more people
involved, we want to cooperate with oilier
classes and organizations, bringing co
sponsored events that will add to the
Stanford community at large.
Finally, we wish to defend the integri
ty of the members of this slate: Yi llang,
Travis Neal, Sharon I'ieczenik and Scot
Strube. We have run a campaign that
only seeks to speak to I lie interests ol the
class. Any discussion of Satisfaction Cuar
anteed's budget was in good faith and
with a concern for the lads. Senior year
should be spent on the dance floor, not
arguing in the page of The Daily â€” let's
have some fun together.

M.F.Ch.A.) receive their funding.

zine that publishes the poetry, art, stories,
essays and photography of our communi

comnmnitN service, a sense of familv, aca
demic excellence and cultural awareness.
Nuestra (iracluacion is the ( liicano/
