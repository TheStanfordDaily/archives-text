BonaFide responds
I'liree months ago, four members of
the (dass of 2001 began to meet with a
common goal of working towards a
senior year that would provide diverse
representation of the interests and goals
of our class. To this end, BonaFide
sought to locus our eflbrts into these lour
c ategories: social, c areer, service and ac a
demic. While we're all down lor Pub
Night, the Tub Crawl and an infamous
Senior Formal, we realize that there are
other members within the class who
desire more.
In response to our opponents' criti
c isms regarding a budget, please allow us
to explain. In discussions with the same
contacts that Satisfaction Cuaranteed has
a relationship with, it was made clear to
us thai a budget for the senior year is not
developed until August, given the
tremendous amount time it takes to plan
and allocate the funds. In a slate that con
tains the director of the Stanford Direc to
ry, a founding father of AKl'si — the first
Stanford business fraternity — and a
recruiter lor a local startup, we feel confi
dent we can deliver the funds to pay for
events such as Tub Night, thus using the
saved funds to defray the costs of the
Senior Formal.
Satisfaction Cuaranteed wrote yester
day that only educational events may be
sponsored. 'This is untrue. The current
senior c lass has used sponsorship to offset
the cost of different pub nights, and we
will clothe same. We are well aware that
last year's Senior Formal cost $'16,000,

and this year's tickets are $40. But,
through our connections, we have
already begun to secure funding and will
continue to this summer as three mem
bers of BonaFide will be in the area. Also,
in the hope of getting more people
involved, we want to cooperate with oilier
classes and organizations, bringing co
sponsored events that will add to the
Stanford community at large.
Finally, we wish to defend the integri
ty of the members of this slate: Yi llang,
Travis Neal, Sharon I'ieczenik and Scot
Strube. We have run a campaign that
only seeks to speak to I lie interests ol the
class. Any discussion of Satisfaction Cuar
anteed's budget was in good faith and
with a concern for the lads. Senior year
should be spent on the dance floor, not
arguing in the page of The Daily — let's
have some fun together.

Addressing Clinton's remarks
on technology and society
I his Moikl.in . in his speech ai Mugged
In in Kasi I'alo Alio, Fresideni ( iinion
said, "No one has to he bypassed iliis time
around."
I his (|uote came .it the end of a stor\
that the President told about how Kast
Halo Alto's social and economk problems
began over 100 years ago with the rerout
ing ol the transcontinental railroad. I lie
assumptions and insights th.it are implic-
it in this story raise fundamental issues
about the relationship between technolo
gy and society.
Since we attend school in the hotbed of
this new technological revolution, it is
important to be aware ol what people
expect the Information Age to accom
plish and to be realistic about purely te< h
nological approaches to solving soc i.il
problems.
One problem I have with Clinton's
story is that it does not address the fact
technology itself (distinct from the ideo
logues that get a hold of it), is often neu
tral within the realm of social relations.
There is nothing inherently wrong with
railroad technology. Historically, it is not
the inventor, but the business person who
seeks personal profit, who turns a benign
technology into a way of entrenching
whatever ideology they believe.
I he transcontinental railroad itsell is
not to blame lor the horrific story of its
creation, rather the people who built it
and oversaw its construction. In other
words, technology is a tool and a reflec -
tion of social oppression, not the source.
We here at Stanford I diversity must real
ize exactly this, that technology is a tool,
and that we can use it to light against
social oppression. But this requires more
than just producing and disseminating
technology.
Our country has a long history of
oppressing certain groups of people.
Many individuals feel that the wrongs
that our government has inflic ted and the
injustices it has allowed to exist can never
be fully recompensed. Others, like Presi
dent Clinton, are relying on the tec hno
logical revolution taking place at Stanford
University and throughout Silicon Valley
to go back and right some of these
wrongs. "No one has to be bypassed this

time."
I his is an overwhelming challenge to
us, the c reators and disseminators of this
technology, 112 or proof one need look no
further than fuesdav's Daily. Isn't ii odd
that President Clinton himself c ites that,
"There are 10.000 technology related
jobs," in I he San |ose Mercur) News
while failing to point out that povertv and
uncmplovnieiit still devastate communi
ties that are walking distance from our
campus?
And what about the rest of the world
where there aren't 10,000 technology
related jobs? Rather than shy awa\ from
this responsibility we need to take action
because we are repeating history's mis
take, that of allowing old ideologies to
attach themselves to new technologies.
Clinton needs to have more ambitious
goals for the future of our country than,
"seeing high technology as pervasive in
American household as the telephone."
What about people who don't have hous
es? It is our job to declare broader goals
lor out revolution and to demand that
the) be actively pursued.
The technological revolution is
unstoppable, and we are playing a major
role in expanding the limits of what can
be accomplished with technology. We
need to take the same attitude, that of
relentless sti i\ ing, to destroy any ideology
that tries to attach itself to our new tec h
nology. I he only way, il any, to keep
inventions that are in and of themselves
benign, is to use them and disseminate
them in ways th.it promote the welfare of
all people.
Stanford University cannot be a micro
cosm of social inequity, it must be a
paradigm lor w hat technological empow
erment can achieve. It is unacceptable for
people at this school to abuse technology
by sending racist emails to the entire cam
pus, and it is even more disgraceful for
the administration to take a lac kadaisical
approach to racial and social issues on
campus. We must be conscious of the

examples we create and behave in a wax
thai is in accord with the power that we
have.

Axe Comm responds to
Daily endorsements
In its annual attempt to "make
informed special-fee endorsements." I he
Daily has misrepresented the- Stanford
Axe Committee and failed to justify the
rating which was given to the Axe Com
mittee.
Among its criticisms. The Daily
claims that tlu- Axe Committee "has
minimal sources of funding and relies
almost entirely on its special fee." In
fact, spec ial fee accounts for only a frac
tion of the committee's total annual
budget. I lie Axe Committee also
receives funding by: staffing Flicks
every week, manning llag responsibili
ties at home football games, sec uring .1
multitude of sponsorships for annual
events atid landing alumni contribu

tions fdi special projects such as the
.'>.ooo loam axes wliic It were distributed
to the student bod\ at the 1999 Big
(lame. I he onlv thing "minimal" is the
cents per quarter which the commit
tee asks from each undergraduate —
one ol the smallest lee requests on the
ballot.
Another priman criticism which
I lie Dail\ makes ol the Axe (lonunittee
is thai "the group is not visible after fall
quarter. In fact, the committee makes
itself visible not onl\ through athletic
games and the annual Frisbee golf
tournament. but also b\ staffing Flicks
even week, all year long. I low "\ isible
are any of the other special fee groups
who have received higher ratings than
the Axe Committee? besides, we are
the Axe Committee, and the Axe is a
trophy centered around the big
FOOTBALL game, li shouldn't come
as am surprise 01 disappointment that
the niajot itv of our events take place in
fall quarter.
Having settled those errors, the pri
man issue left to address is the rating
which Flic Daily lias given the Axe
Committee. The special fee rating
guide asserts that a rating of "2" shall
be given to a group if: it "has met few
of the previous year's goals," its plans
lot the coming year do not "clearly
reflect effort to fulfill unmet goals 01
does not seem viable," its "sense of con
stituency is hazy" and its "ability to
effectively and efficiently use funds is
unclear."
In no way has the Axe Committee
faltered 011 am ol these terms. In the
last year, we have met all of our goals —
exceeding tliein in many cases. We
threw a Big Came rally last fall that saw
its largest attendance since the bonfire
rally in Lake Lag back in 1992. Our
"sense of constituency" is far from ha/\
— at 70 members, we have the largest
membership in the history ol the com
mittee! As far as our "ability to effec

tivelx and efficientlx use funds." we
clearlx do not have a problem there —
we are one of onl\ eight special fee
groups whose request has decreased
Irom last vear. I he Daily has failed to
provide sufficient reason as to why it
gave the Axe (lommittee a rating of "2."
I lie only reason I can figure that
fhe Dailv would give such a low. illog
ical rating to the Axe ( onnnittee is for
lack of another group to give a low rat
ing. Bill the Axe ('.ommittee, a group
which fhe Dailx called "the
quintessential special fee group" just
three years ago, should not he pun
ished for this. Our group has made
solid advancements in the past vear,
expanding our coverage of, and
involvement in, a number of campus
events, fhe Axe Committee has put in
countless hours of behind-the-scenes
work which directlx benefits the under
graduate bodv at Stanford and seeks
nothing hut to earn the torch of Stan
ford traditions to another generation.

words, technology is a tool and a reflec -
tion of social oppression, not the source.
We here at Stanford I diversity must real
ize exactly this, that technology is a tool,
and that we can use it to light against
social oppression. But this requires more
than just producing and disseminating
technology.
Our country has a long history of
oppressing certain groups of people.
Many individuals feel that the wrongs
that our government has inflic ted and the
injustices it has allowed to exist can never
be fully recompensed. Others, like Presi
dent Clinton, are relying on the tec hno
logical revolution taking place at Stanford
University and throughout Silicon Valley
to go back and right some of these
wrongs. "No one has to be bypassed this

time."
I his is an overwhelming challenge to
us, the c reators and disseminators of this
technology, 112 or proof one need look no
further than fuesdav's Daily. Isn't ii odd
that President Clinton himself c ites that,
"There are 10.000 technology related
jobs," in I he San |ose Mercur) News
while failing to point out that povertv and
uncmplovnieiit still devastate communi
ties that are walking distance from our
campus?
And what about the rest of the world
where there aren't 10,000 technology
related jobs? Rather than shy awa\ from
this responsibility we need to take action
because we are repeating history's mis
take, that of allowing old ideologies to
attach themselves to new technologies.
Clinton needs to have more ambitious
goals for the future of our country than,
"seeing high technology as pervasive in
American household as the telephone."
What about people who don't have hous
es? It is our job to declare broader goals
lor out revolution and to demand that
the) be actively pursued.
The technological revolution is
unstoppable, and we are playing a major
role in expanding the limits of what can
be accomplished with technology. We
need to take the same attitude, that of
relentless sti i\ ing, to destroy any ideology
that tries to attach itself to our new tec h
nology. I he only way, il any, to keep
inventions that are in and of themselves
benign, is to use them and disseminate
them in ways th.it promote the welfare of
all people.
Stanford University cannot be a micro
cosm of social inequity, it must be a
paradigm lor w hat technological empow
erment can achieve. It is unacceptable for
people at this school to abuse technology
by sending racist emails to the entire cam

Axe Comm responds to
Daily endorsements
In its annual attempt to "make
informed special-fee endorsements." I he
Daily has misrepresented the- Stanford
Axe Committee and failed to justify the
rating which was given to the Axe Com
mittee.
Among its criticisms. The Daily
claims that tlu- Axe Committee "has
minimal sources of funding and relies
almost entirely on its special fee." In
fact, spec ial fee accounts for only a frac
tion of the committee's total annual
budget. I lie Axe Committee also
receives funding by: staffing Flicks
every week, manning llag responsibili
ties at home football games, sec uring .1
multitude of sponsorships for annual
events atid landing alumni contribu

tions fdi special projects such as the
.'>.ooo loam axes wliic It were distributed
to the student bod\ at the 1999 Big
(lame. I he onlv thing "minimal" is the
cents per quarter which the commit
tee asks from each undergraduate —
one ol the smallest lee requests on the
ballot.
Another priman criticism which
I lie Dail\ makes ol the Axe (lonunittee
is thai "the group is not visible after fall
quarter. In fact, the committee makes
itself visible not onl\ through athletic
games and the annual Frisbee golf
tournament. but also b\ staffing Flicks
even week, all year long. I low "\ isible
are any of the other special fee groups
who have received higher ratings than
the Axe Committee? besides, we are
the Axe Committee, and the Axe is a
trophy centered around the big
FOOTBALL game, li shouldn't come
as am surprise 01 disappointment that
the niajot itv of our events take place in
fall quarter.
Having settled those errors, the pri
man issue left to address is the rating
which Flic Daily lias given the Axe
Committee. The special fee rating
guide asserts that a rating of "2" shall
be given to a group if: it "has met few
of the previous year's goals," its plans
lot the coming year do not "clearly
reflect effort to fulfill unmet goals 01
does not seem viable," its "sense of con
stituency is hazy" and its "ability to
effectively and efficiently use funds is
unclear."
In no way has the Axe Committee
faltered 011 am ol these terms. In the
last year, we have met all of our goals —
exceeding tliein in many cases. We
threw a Big Came rally last fall that saw
its largest attendance since the bonfire
rally in Lake Lag back in 1992. Our
"sense of constituency" is far from ha/\
— at 70 members, we have the largest
membership in the history ol the com
mittee! As far as our "ability to effec

tivelx and efficientlx use funds." we
clearlx do not have a problem there —
we are one of onl\ eight special fee
groups whose request has decreased
Irom last vear. I he Daily has failed to
provide sufficient reason as to why it
gave the Axe (lommittee a rating of "2."
I lie only reason I can figure that
fhe Dailv would give such a low. illog
ical rating to the Axe ( onnnittee is for
lack of another group to give a low rat
ing. Bill the Axe ('.ommittee, a group
which fhe Dailx called "the
quintessential special fee group" just
three years ago, should not he pun
ished for this. Our group has made
solid advancements in the past vear,
expanding our coverage of, and
involvement in, a number of campus
events, fhe Axe Committee has put in
countless hours of behind-the-scenes
work which directlx benefits the under
graduate bodv at Stanford and seeks
nothing hut to earn the torch of Stan
ford traditions to another generation.

BonaFide responds
I'liree months ago, four members of
the (dass of 2001 began to meet with a
common goal of working towards a
senior year that would provide diverse
representation of the interests and goals
of our class. To this end, BonaFide
sought to locus our eflbrts into these lour
c ategories: social, c areer, service and ac a
demic. While we're all down lor Pub
Night, the Tub Crawl and an infamous
Senior Formal, we realize that there are
other members within the class who
desire more.
In response to our opponents' criti
c isms regarding a budget, please allow us
to explain. In discussions with the same
contacts that Satisfaction Cuaranteed has
a relationship with, it was made clear to
us thai a budget for the senior year is not
developed until August, given the
tremendous amount time it takes to plan
and allocate the funds. In a slate that con
tains the director of the Stanford Direc to
ry, a founding father of AKl'si — the first
Stanford business fraternity — and a
recruiter lor a local startup, we feel confi
dent we can deliver the funds to pay for
events such as Tub Night, thus using the
saved funds to defray the costs of the
Senior Formal.
Satisfaction Cuaranteed wrote yester
day that only educational events may be
sponsored. 'This is untrue. The current
senior c lass has used sponsorship to offset
the cost of different pub nights, and we
will clothe same. We are well aware that
last year's Senior Formal cost $'16,000,

and this year's tickets are $40. But,
through our connections, we have
already begun to secure funding and will
continue to this summer as three mem
bers of BonaFide will be in the area. Also,
in the hope of getting more people
involved, we want to cooperate with oilier
classes and organizations, bringing co
sponsored events that will add to the
Stanford community at large.
Finally, we wish to defend the integri
ty of the members of this slate: Yi llang,
Travis Neal, Sharon I'ieczenik and Scot
Strube. We have run a campaign that
only seeks to speak to I lie interests ol the
class. Any discussion of Satisfaction Cuar
anteed's budget was in good faith and
with a concern for the lads. Senior year
should be spent on the dance floor, not
arguing in the page of The Daily — let's
have some fun together.

Addressing Clinton's remarks
on technology and society
I his Moikl.in . in his speech ai Mugged
In in Kasi I'alo Alio, Fresideni ( iinion
said, "No one has to he bypassed iliis time
around."
I his (|uote came .it the end of a stor\
that the President told about how Kast
Halo Alto's social and economk problems
began over 100 years ago with the rerout
ing ol the transcontinental railroad. I lie
assumptions and insights th.it are implic-
it in this story raise fundamental issues
about the relationship between technolo
gy and society.
Since we attend school in the hotbed of
this new technological revolution, it is
important to be aware ol what people
expect the Information Age to accom
plish and to be realistic about purely te< h
nological approaches to solving soc i.il
problems.
One problem I have with Clinton's
story is that it does not address the fact
technology itself (distinct from the ideo
logues that get a hold of it), is often neu
tral within the realm of social relations.
There is nothing inherently wrong with
railroad technology. Historically, it is not
the inventor, but the business person who
seeks personal profit, who turns a benign
technology into a way of entrenching
whatever ideology they believe.
I he transcontinental railroad itsell is
not to blame lor the horrific story of its
creation, rather the people who built it
and oversaw its construction. In other
words, technology is a tool and a reflec -
tion of social oppression, not the source.

which Flic Daily lias given the Axe
Committee. The special fee rating
guide asserts that a rating of "2" shall
be given to a group if: it "has met few
of the previous year's goals," its plans
lot the coming year do not "clearly
reflect effort to fulfill unmet goals 01
does not seem viable," its "sense of con
stituency is hazy" and its "ability to
effectively and efficiently use funds is
unclear."
In no way has the Axe Committee
faltered 011 am ol these terms. In the
last year, we have met all of our goals —
exceeding tliein in many cases. We
threw a Big Came rally last fall that saw
its largest attendance since the bonfire
rally in Lake Lag back in 1992. Our
"sense of constituency" is far from ha/\
— at 70 members, we have the largest
membership in the history ol the com
mittee! As far as our "ability to effec

tivelx and efficientlx use funds." we
clearlx do not have a problem there —
we are one of onl\ eight special fee
groups whose request has decreased
Irom last vear. I he Daily has failed to
provide sufficient reason as to why it
gave the Axe (lommittee a rating of "2."
I lie only reason I can figure that
fhe Dailv would give such a low. illog
ical rating to the Axe ( onnnittee is for
lack of another group to give a low rat
ing. Bill the Axe ('.ommittee, a group
which fhe Dailx called "the
quintessential special fee group" just
three years ago, should not he pun
ished for this. Our group has made
solid advancements in the past vear,
expanding our coverage of, and
involvement in, a number of campus
events, fhe Axe Committee has put in
countless hours of behind-the-scenes
work which directlx benefits the under
graduate bodv at Stanford and seeks
nothing hut to earn the torch of Stan
ford traditions to another generation.

BonaFide responds
I'liree months ago, four members of
the (dass of 2001 began to meet with a
common goal of working towards a
senior year that would provide diverse
representation of the interests and goals
of our class. To this end, BonaFide
sought to locus our eflbrts into these lour
c ategories: social, c areer, service and ac a
demic. While we're all down lor Pub
Night, the Tub Crawl and an infamous
Senior Formal, we realize that there are
other members within the class who
desire more.
In response to our opponents' criti
c isms regarding a budget, please allow us
to explain. In discussions with the same
contacts that Satisfaction Cuaranteed has
a relationship with, it was made clear to
us thai a budget for the senior year is not
developed until August, given the
tremendous amount time it takes to plan
and allocate the funds. In a slate that con
tains the director of the Stanford Direc to
ry, a founding father of AKl'si — the first
Stanford business fraternity — and a
recruiter lor a local startup, we feel confi
dent we can deliver the funds to pay for
events such as Tub Night, thus using the
saved funds to defray the costs of the
Senior Formal.
Satisfaction Cuaranteed wrote yester
day that only educational events may be
sponsored. 'This is untrue. The current
senior c lass has used sponsorship to offset
the cost of different pub nights, and we
will clothe same. We are well aware that
last year's Senior Formal cost $'16,000,

and this year's tickets are $40. But,
through our connections, we have
already begun to secure funding and will
continue to this summer as three mem
bers of BonaFide will be in the area. Also,
in the hope of getting more people
involved, we want to cooperate with oilier
classes and organizations, bringing co
sponsored events that will add to the
Stanford community at large.
Finally, we wish to defend the integri
ty of the members of this slate: Yi llang,
Travis Neal, Sharon I'ieczenik and Scot
Strube. We have run a campaign that
only seeks to speak to I lie interests ol the
class. Any discussion of Satisfaction Cuar
anteed's budget was in good faith and
with a concern for the lads. Senior year
should be spent on the dance floor, not
arguing in the page of The Daily — let's
have some fun together.

Addressing Clinton's remarks
on technology and society
I his Moikl.in . in his speech ai Mugged
In in Kasi I'alo Alio, Fresideni ( iinion
said, "No one has to he bypassed iliis time
around."
I his (|uote came .it the end of a stor\
that the President told about how Kast
Halo Alto's social and economk problems
began over 100 years ago with the rerout
ing ol the transcontinental railroad. I lie
assumptions and insights th.it are implic-
it in this story raise fundamental issues
about the relationship between technolo
gy and society.
Since we attend school in the hotbed of
this new technological revolution, it is
important to be aware ol what people
expect the Information Age to accom
plish and to be realistic about purely te< h
nological approaches to solving soc i.il
problems.
One problem I have with Clinton's
story is that it does not address the fact
technology itself (distinct from the ideo
logues that get a hold of it), is often neu
tral within the realm of social relations.
There is nothing inherently wrong with
railroad technology. Historically, it is not
the inventor, but the business person who
seeks personal profit, who turns a benign
technology into a way of entrenching
whatever ideology they believe.
I he transcontinental railroad itsell is
not to blame lor the horrific story of its
creation, rather the people who built it
and oversaw its construction. In other
words, technology is a tool and a reflec -
tion of social oppression, not the source.
We here at Stanford I diversity must real
ize exactly this, that technology is a tool,
and that we can use it to light against
social oppression. But this requires more
than just producing and disseminating
technology.
Our country has a long history of
oppressing certain groups of people.
Many individuals feel that the wrongs
that our government has inflic ted and the
injustices it has allowed to exist can never
be fully recompensed. Others, like Presi
dent Clinton, are relying on the tec hno
logical revolution taking place at Stanford
University and throughout Silicon Valley
to go back and right some of these
wrongs. "No one has to be bypassed this

time."
I his is an overwhelming challenge to
us, the c reators and disseminators of this
technology, 112 or proof one need look no
further than fuesdav's Daily. Isn't ii odd
that President Clinton himself c ites that,
"There are 10.000 technology related
jobs," in I he San |ose Mercur) News
while failing to point out that povertv and
uncmplovnieiit still devastate communi
ties that are walking distance from our
campus?
And what about the rest of the world
where there aren't 10,000 technology
related jobs? Rather than shy awa\ from
this responsibility we need to take action
because we are repeating history's mis
take, that of allowing old ideologies to
attach themselves to new technologies.
Clinton needs to have more ambitious
goals for the future of our country than,
"seeing high technology as pervasive in
American household as the telephone."
What about people who don't have hous
es? It is our job to declare broader goals
lor out revolution and to demand that
the) be actively pursued.
The technological revolution is
unstoppable, and we are playing a major
role in expanding the limits of what can
be accomplished with technology. We
need to take the same attitude, that of
relentless sti i\ ing, to destroy any ideology
that tries to attach itself to our new tec h
nology. I he only way, il any, to keep
inventions that are in and of themselves
benign, is to use them and disseminate
them in ways th.it promote the welfare of
all people.
Stanford University cannot be a micro
cosm of social inequity, it must be a
paradigm lor w hat technological empow
erment can achieve. It is unacceptable for
people at this school to abuse technology
by sending racist emails to the entire cam
pus, and it is even more disgraceful for
the administration to take a lac kadaisical
approach to racial and social issues on
campus. We must be conscious of the

examples we create and behave in a wax
thai is in accord with the power that we
have.

Axe Comm responds to
Daily endorsements
In its annual attempt to "make
informed special-fee endorsements." I he
Daily has misrepresented the- Stanford
Axe Committee and failed to justify the
rating which was given to the Axe Com
mittee.
Among its criticisms. The Daily
claims that tlu- Axe Committee "has
minimal sources of funding and relies
almost entirely on its special fee." In
fact, spec ial fee accounts for only a frac
tion of the committee's total annual
budget. I lie Axe Committee also
receives funding by: staffing Flicks
every week, manning llag responsibili
ties at home football games, sec uring .1
multitude of sponsorships for annual
events atid landing alumni contribu

tions fdi special projects such as the
.'>.ooo loam axes wliic It were distributed
to the student bod\ at the 1999 Big
(lame. I he onlv thing "minimal" is the
cents per quarter which the commit
tee asks from each undergraduate —
one ol the smallest lee requests on the
ballot.
Another priman criticism which
I lie Dail\ makes ol the Axe (lonunittee
is thai "the group is not visible after fall
quarter. In fact, the committee makes
itself visible not onl\ through athletic
games and the annual Frisbee golf
tournament. but also b\ staffing Flicks
even week, all year long. I low "\ isible
are any of the other special fee groups
who have received higher ratings than
the Axe Committee? besides, we are
the Axe Committee, and the Axe is a
trophy centered around the big
FOOTBALL game, li shouldn't come
as am surprise 01 disappointment that
the niajot itv of our events take place in
fall quarter.
Having settled those errors, the pri
man issue left to address is the rating
which Flic Daily lias given the Axe
Committee. The special fee rating
guide asserts that a rating of "2" shall
be given to a group if: it "has met few
of the previous year's goals," its plans
lot the coming year do not "clearly
reflect effort to fulfill unmet goals 01
does not seem viable," its "sense of con
stituency is hazy" and its "ability to
effectively and efficiently use funds is
unclear."
In no way has the Axe Committee

last year, we have met all of our goals —
exceeding tliein in many cases. We
