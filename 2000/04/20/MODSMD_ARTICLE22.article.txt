# All I needed to know — I learned in my dining hall
## 
### JENNIFER WESKELBAUM GUEST COLUMNIST 
Stanford, huh? What do you study
there? Its the same question every time.
And every time, 1 hesitate to answer. It's
not that 1 don't have a major. It's just
that most of what I've learned here has
nothing to do with that major.
So what have I learned about at Stan
find? One wortl: power. And I didn't
even have to leave the comforts of my
freshman dorm to learn it.
It started just as an uncomfortable
feeling, the recognition that there was a
division between the community of peo
ple who worked in the dining halls and
that of the students who ate in them. For
a year 1 dreaded the twice daily ritual of
smiling to the woman who swiped my 11)
card, waiting in line for food, asking the
woman behind the counter for a grilled
cheese sandwich. It wasn't the food that
got me down, but the contact — or lack
thereof — with the people who cooked
and served it.
Why couldn't I make contact?
Because I was ashamed. Embarrassed. I
knew that most of the people who
worked in food service did not make a
living wage, and yet I was complicit in
supporting this business. How could I
look the woman working the grill in the
eye? Every action in that dining hall was
a hypocrisy. We'd sit around the tables
in Stern North and pick apart the great
philosophers' views on ethics, all the
while trying not to see the people who

pushed around tarts lull of our dirty
trays for $7 an hour.
We tame into that cafeteria talking
about respect, scooped up the food that
someone had made at 6 a.m., made fun
of it, left ii half-finished on our plates.
We'd discuss our $8.25/ hour jobs at
the library while we stood in line waiting
for mashed potatoes from someone who
made $5.75 — and had to support a fam
ily. Kven worse, we'tl stand in those lines
and discuss how we were going to fix the
inequalities of the world, ignoring the
injustice we were participating in.
So it was time to find out, what it is
like to work at Stanford? Just asking the
people who work on campus can get you
a long way. Many of the kitchens at Stan
lord are hostile places to work. People
are harassed when they call in sick,
talked-down to, have their schedules
shuffled around to cut costs.
Stanford uses temporary employees
for much of the kitchen work because
they are low-paid and do not receive
benefits. And none of the workers at
Webb Ranch, a farm on Stanford land,
have health benefits at all.
janitors on this campus earn as little
as $6.75 per hour. The SO union janitors,
however, earn an average of $8.04 per
hour, and do have health benefits, albeit
at an exorbitant price. But neither of
these wages is a livable one. Among the
5,500 union janitors in the Bay Area, the
average household income is ;57 percent
below a basic, "no-frills" family budget.
Thirty-eight percent of households must

take in relatives or strangers in order to
pay the rent.
Angeles Eigueroa, Stanford janitor of
three years, puts it well, "Our children
are not vegetarians for health reasons,
but because we can't afford to bin them
meat."
So how can this go on? I low can hard
working people be kept in poverty? It's
simple.
Who has the money? Stanford. Who
has the buildings that need cleaning?
Stanford. Who has the power to hire or
fire or call in the INS? Stanford.
What power do workers have? More
than you might think. Since April
8,500 janitors in the Los Angeles area
have put their jobs on the line and gone
on strike, demanding justice. Most of
these janitors make around $6.80 per
hour and are demanding a $1 per hour
annual pay raise for the next three years.
Seventy percent of all the commercial
building space in LA is left without its
regular janitors!
To show solidarity, the Sanitation
workers are refusing to pick up trash
from affected buildings and the I'cani
sters are refusing to deliver packages to
these locations. Numerous rallies show
widespread community support for the
janitors.
A strike is a pressure tactic, designed
to leverage collective power to gain
improvements in workers' lives. But it is
also an educational weapon. Since April
many of the people in those IA offices
have had to take out their own trash, vac

uum their own floors and clean their
own toilets.
It's an unofficial "Janitor Appreciation
Month." A not-so-subtle reminder that
janitorial work is hard labor that is \ it;il
to the functioning of society.
At Stanford, too, we could use a little
education. After all, that's what we're
here for. As the second largest employer
in Santa ( lat a County, Stanford tall ies a
lot of weight in the local economy. And
as a world-renowned institution of high
er learning, Stanford can lead the wa\ in
putting morality into practice.
Now Stanford will try to absolve itself
of responsibility. A top administrator will
say that because Stanford contracts out
its janitorial work to companies like
American Building Maintenance (ABM),
the Lniversiiy has no responsibility lor
the wages paid.
But if we do our homework we will
know that the University is ultiinatel)
holding the purse strings, and has the
power to tell ABM that its workers
deserve respect. So we can slop feeling
guilt\ and ashamed and instead use what
power we have to support the janitors
and other workers on ibis campus in
their organizing efforts.
1 lie Stanford janitors' contract is up
for renegotiation in May, and between
now and then we need to get the word
out that students tare. Together with
janitors we can organize. We can sign
petitions, talk with administrators, hold
rallies and use the resources available to
us to do research on the issues. We can

hold our administrators accountable for
their decisions.
In a sense, we hold the purse strings
of this I diversity. We can give the
administrators of Stanford a little school
ing in social justice. Or just in common
sense: Who can truly benefit when peo
ple are being paid less than they need to
survive?
Most importantly, we can break
down the barriers that have been built
between students and workers on this
campus. Granted, students and workers
have different kinds of power, and we
shouldn't just sweep this issue under
the rug.
We need to address why our power is
so different, what circumstances led to
our different roles in this University, and
how we can go about equalizing those
roles. I hat way administrators will do
something to benefit "the Stanford com
munity," together we can make sure that
includes the WHOLE community. Like
the) say on the admissions tour at Stan
ford. yon learn more from the people in
sour dorm than from any professor in
dass. And it's true. So, mavbe 1 should
take this moment to applaud Housing
and Dining Services for fulfilling their
mission of enhancing the educational
experience at Stanford. Because all 1
really need to know about the world I
learned in Stern North Dining.

are harassed when they call in sick,
talked-down to, have their schedules
shuffled around to cut costs.
Stanford uses temporary employees
for much of the kitchen work because
they are low-paid and do not receive
benefits. And none of the workers at
Webb Ranch, a farm on Stanford land,
have health benefits at all.
janitors on this campus earn as little
as $6.75 per hour. The SO union janitors,
however, earn an average of $8.04 per
hour, and do have health benefits, albeit
at an exorbitant price. But neither of
these wages is a livable one. Among the
5,500 union janitors in the Bay Area, the
average household income is ;57 percent
below a basic, "no-frills" family budget.
Thirty-eight percent of households must

take in relatives or strangers in order to
pay the rent.
Angeles Eigueroa, Stanford janitor of
three years, puts it well, "Our children
are not vegetarians for health reasons,
but because we can't afford to bin them
meat."
So how can this go on? I low can hard
working people be kept in poverty? It's
simple.
Who has the money? Stanford. Who
has the buildings that need cleaning?
Stanford. Who has the power to hire or
fire or call in the INS? Stanford.
What power do workers have? More
than you might think. Since April
8,500 janitors in the Los Angeles area
have put their jobs on the line and gone
on strike, demanding justice. Most of
these janitors make around $6.80 per
hour and are demanding a $1 per hour
annual pay raise for the next three years.
Seventy percent of all the commercial
building space in LA is left without its
regular janitors!
To show solidarity, the Sanitation
workers are refusing to pick up trash
from affected buildings and the I'cani
sters are refusing to deliver packages to
these locations. Numerous rallies show
widespread community support for the
janitors.
A strike is a pressure tactic, designed
to leverage collective power to gain
improvements in workers' lives. But it is
also an educational weapon. Since April
many of the people in those IA offices
have had to take out their own trash, vac

uum their own floors and clean their
own toilets.
It's an unofficial "Janitor Appreciation
Month." A not-so-subtle reminder that
janitorial work is hard labor that is \ it;il
to the functioning of society.
At Stanford, too, we could use a little
education. After all, that's what we're
here for. As the second largest employer
in Santa ( lat a County, Stanford tall ies a
lot of weight in the local economy. And
as a world-renowned institution of high
er learning, Stanford can lead the wa\ in
putting morality into practice.
Now Stanford will try to absolve itself
of responsibility. A top administrator will
say that because Stanford contracts out
its janitorial work to companies like
American Building Maintenance (ABM),
the Lniversiiy has no responsibility lor
the wages paid.
But if we do our homework we will
know that the University is ultiinatel)
holding the purse strings, and has the
power to tell ABM that its workers
deserve respect. So we can slop feeling
guilt\ and ashamed and instead use what
power we have to support the janitors
and other workers on ibis campus in
their organizing efforts.
1 lie Stanford janitors' contract is up
for renegotiation in May, and between
now and then we need to get the word
out that students tare. Together with
janitors we can organize. We can sign
petitions, talk with administrators, hold
rallies and use the resources available to
us to do research on the issues. We can

hold our administrators accountable for
their decisions.
In a sense, we hold the purse strings
of this I diversity. We can give the
administrators of Stanford a little school
ing in social justice. Or just in common
sense: Who can truly benefit when peo
ple are being paid less than they need to
survive?
Most importantly, we can break
down the barriers that have been built
between students and workers on this
campus. Granted, students and workers
have different kinds of power, and we
shouldn't just sweep this issue under
the rug.
We need to address why our power is
so different, what circumstances led to
our different roles in this University, and
how we can go about equalizing those
roles. I hat way administrators will do
something to benefit "the Stanford com
munity," together we can make sure that
includes the WHOLE community. Like
the) say on the admissions tour at Stan
ford. yon learn more from the people in
sour dorm than from any professor in
dass. And it's true. So, mavbe 1 should
take this moment to applaud Housing
and Dining Services for fulfilling their
mission of enhancing the educational
experience at Stanford. Because all 1
really need to know about the world I
learned in Stern North Dining.

Stanford, huh? What do you study
there? Its the same question every time.
And every time, 1 hesitate to answer. It's
not that 1 don't have a major. It's just
that most of what I've learned here has
nothing to do with that major.
So what have I learned about at Stan
find? One wortl: power. And I didn't
even have to leave the comforts of my
freshman dorm to learn it.
It started just as an uncomfortable
feeling, the recognition that there was a
division between the community of peo
ple who worked in the dining halls and
that of the students who ate in them. For
a year 1 dreaded the twice daily ritual of
smiling to the woman who swiped my 11)
card, waiting in line for food, asking the
woman behind the counter for a grilled
cheese sandwich. It wasn't the food that
got me down, but the contact — or lack
thereof — with the people who cooked
and served it.
Why couldn't I make contact?
Because I was ashamed. Embarrassed. I
knew that most of the people who
worked in food service did not make a
living wage, and yet I was complicit in
supporting this business. How could I
look the woman working the grill in the
eye? Every action in that dining hall was
a hypocrisy. We'd sit around the tables
in Stern North and pick apart the great
philosophers' views on ethics, all the
while trying not to see the people who

pushed around tarts lull of our dirty
trays for $7 an hour.
We tame into that cafeteria talking
about respect, scooped up the food that
someone had made at 6 a.m., made fun
of it, left ii half-finished on our plates.
We'd discuss our $8.25/ hour jobs at
the library while we stood in line waiting
for mashed potatoes from someone who
made $5.75 — and had to support a fam
ily. Kven worse, we'tl stand in those lines
and discuss how we were going to fix the
inequalities of the world, ignoring the
injustice we were participating in.
So it was time to find out, what it is
like to work at Stanford? Just asking the
people who work on campus can get you
a long way. Many of the kitchens at Stan
lord are hostile places to work. People
are harassed when they call in sick,
talked-down to, have their schedules
shuffled around to cut costs.
